00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,800
Good googly Mowgli.
Hello everybody.

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,890
Welcome back.
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:12,891
podcast is brought to you by tank.
Ting is one of my favorite sponsors on 

4
00:00:12,891 --> 00:00:17,601
the podcast because I have heard nothing
but positive responses from people that 

5
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:22,641
have used ting and have saved money.
It's a no bullshit and mobile service 

6
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:25,830
and what they mean by no bullshit is 
they have no contracts,

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,010
no early termination fees,
no ridiculous bundling or ride along 

8
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:34,290
services,
the way they set up their rates.

9
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,190
You use what you use and you pay for 
what you use.

10
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,770
No overage charges,
no penalties,

11
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,640
no add on charges,
no mysterious line items on your bill.

12
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,240
They decided to put together a mobile 
service the way mobile really should 

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,280
have been done from the beginning with 
no nonsense and good service.

14
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:58,281
They use this sprint backbone,
so you have a major provider that's 

15
00:00:58,281 --> 00:00:59,700
providing your bandwidth,
providing your,

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,750
your cell phone service,
and you can get the top end android 

17
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:04,830
devices.

18
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,460
When you buy a device from Ting,
if you go to Tim's website,

19
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:10,440
if you go to [inaudible] dot [inaudible]
dot com,

20
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:13,410
you can actually save $25 off one of 
these android devices,

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,530
but if you see the range of devices that
they have,

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,800
they have all the cool new gadgets like 
the Samsung galaxy s three,

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,530
the Samsung Galaxy s four actually is 
the new one,

24
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,920
the Samsung Galaxy note three,
which is what I have.

25
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,390
The htc one.
I mean they have all the really cool,

26
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,710
interesting new android phones,
so you get the high end phones,

27
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:41,160
you get sprint service.
It's exactly the same as sprint.

28
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:46,190
It's not some weird mom and pop company 
that's giving you some rinky dink cell 

29
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,451
phone service and you can do it and save
money and do it in a way where you don't

30
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:53,360
feel gross at the end of the month like 
that.

31
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:57,570
Got Me.
These fucking creeps to kindle team will

32
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:02,571
also give you credit for $25 of your 
early termination fee up to $75 per 

33
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:03,780
device.

34
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,210
Twenty five percent rather.
I'll say that again.

35
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,910
Tim will give you.
It's.

36
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,790
They call it their early termination fee
relief program,

37
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,480
which is kind of sweet.
They will give you credit for 25 percent

38
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:19,560
of your early termination fee up to $75 
per device.

39
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:24,590
So if you're getting fucked by your 
other company when you leave and go to 

40
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:27,411
tank,
they'll try to give you a little bit of 

41
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:29,181
relief.
It's a really cool way to get your 

42
00:02:29,181 --> 00:02:32,721
mobile service.
It's really cool way that they've 

43
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:33,240
decided to provide mobile service.
Just no nonsense.

44
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:35,970
And it's ethical.
It's clean,

45
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,740
it's a better way to do it.
Um,

46
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,480
we have friends that use it and it's 
been nothing but positive.

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,640
We've had nothing but excellent 
responses.

48
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,760
So go to [inaudible] dot ting.com.
Saved money and better manage your 

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,021
mobile service using ting.
So that's Rogan.ting.com.

50
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,690
And save some money.
Well you were also brought to you by 

51
00:02:59,690 --> 00:02:59,690
[inaudible] dot com.

52
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,080
That's o n n I t and very excited that 
we have Dr Rhonda Patrick on the podcast

53
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,560
today because she can explain some of 
the shit that's on it.

54
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:13,250
That confuses me.
All the baffling stuff about what,

55
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,210
what antioxidants are necessary.
What about,

56
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,110
what about digestive enzymes,
when did they come into play?

57
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,830
All these things are very,
very crucial for health and very 

58
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:26,290
confusing,
so we're going to get to that today,

59
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,270
but on it.com
carries,

60
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,310
we essentially try to carry everything 
that we find beneficial and everything 

61
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,630
that I use.
Everything that arbor uses,

62
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,790
everything that our friends use,
athletes,

63
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,370
mixed martial arts fighters,
Jujitsu people,

64
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:43,120
things that things that would benefit 
your physical conditioning,

65
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,390
things that would benefit your cognitive
function,

66
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,660
things that benefit your immune system,
your endurance,

67
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,720
what we sell,
whether it's our strength and 

68
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:54,720
conditioning equipment like kettlebells,
battle ropes,

69
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,510
steel,
maces,

70
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,540
those things along those lines,
or whether it's the nutritional 

71
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,340
supplements like hemp force protein 
powder or new mood or Alpha brain.

72
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,550
We just try to sell you the very best,
most high quality supplements that are 

73
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:11,530
available in the world.
Whatever we can find.

74
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,620
If we find stuff that's beneficial,
we try to sell it to you and because 

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,400
some of the stuff that we sell at onnit 
is controversial.

76
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,950
We're in the process of running many 
tests.

77
00:04:20,951 --> 00:04:25,951
We just got back the results where we 
actually just started publishing the 

78
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:28,210
results of the double blind placebo 
tests that we did on Alpha brain.

79
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,320
If you go to the audit website,
you can see the results of that test.

80
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:36,220
It was a pilot program of 20 people out 
of those 20 people,

81
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,340
a few dropped out.
So we were left with I think 16 or 17 

82
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,641
people.
But we got positive results from two 

83
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:46,300
categories,
from memory and from execution.

84
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:52,220
The execution of a,
I think it's actually verbal execution 

85
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:52,220
was the,
um,

86
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,160
you can learn on a.com.

87
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,370
The idea behind it is what you're doing 
when you're taking something like a 

88
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,541
nootropic is you're giving your brain 
the building blocks to produce human 

89
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,670
transmitters.
The nutritional aspects of,

90
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,760
of,
of thought.

91
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,520
And when you take,
you know,

92
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,980
if you're,
if you're just getting that stuff 

93
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,531
through food man,
you'd have to take a lot of weird food 

94
00:05:16,531 --> 00:05:19,290
and you could take,
you have to take a lot of it in like 

95
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,240
really high doses while mosses and 
grasses and weird shit that you're not 

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,930
going to want to eat.
All of it is very controversial,

97
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:26,350
so we're in the process of continuing 
even more studies.

98
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:31,351
If you go to the website,
you can see the Alpha brain clinical 

99
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:32,800
trial results.
We have them all posted and we're in the

100
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:37,801
process of a much larger test right now.
We're also in the process of tests on 

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,980
several of the other supplements because
they're controversial even though we 100

102
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:45,880
percent back them and support them,
we offer a 30 pill,

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
90 day 100 percent money back guarantee 
on anything that you buy from on it and 

104
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,240
either supplements.
If you try them,

105
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,840
you don't like them.
You feel like Alpha brain didn't make 

106
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,790
your brain work any better.
You get 100 percent of your money back.

107
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,230
You don't even have to send in the 
pills.

108
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,090
We don't want anybody feeling ripped 
off.

109
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:04,550
We just want to sell you the best shit 
that's available currently.

110
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,060
So go to [inaudible] dot com o n n I t 
use the Codeword Rogan and save 10 

111
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,670
percent off of any and all supplements.
All right,

112
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:14,420
that's it.
Boom,

113
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,190
boom.
Dr Rhonda Patrick's here.

114
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:16,880
Cue The music.

115
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,740
I'm just dying to ask you,
so what's in Alpha brain,

116
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,000
the Joe Rogan experience?

117
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:29,230
Joe Rogan podcast all day?
That's a good question.

118
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,900
What's an APA?
Brandon?

119
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,210
We could read it all off,
but it would sound like another 

120
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:37,210
commercial on top of a commercial.

121
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:41,710
It's essentially you said a transmitter 
or somebody can serotonin.

122
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,930
I'm looking.
I'm looking.

123
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,250
Doo Doo,
Doo Doo Doo.

124
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,410
I should give it to you so you could 
read it.

125
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,110
Yeah.
Because,

126
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,130
uh,
if trip to fans in there,

127
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:53,150
that's actually a really.

128
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,760
Hold on a second,
but this is just one.

129
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:00,640
This has alpha brand that has a lot of 
different shit in it.

130
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,780
It is the stuff that we take.
Um.

131
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:03,650
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

132
00:07:03,651 --> 00:07:05,870
Okay.
That's A.

133
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,310
Okay.
Here's the actual ingredients.

134
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,610
Read that right there.
Here's the actual ingredients.

135
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,940
Dr Rhonda Patrick reached out to me,
um,

136
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:19,150
because she had some things to say about
some of the things that other podcast 

137
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,570
guests said about nutrition,
about health,

138
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,750
and tell the folks what your credentials
are,

139
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,310
what you do,
who you are,

140
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,370
why you are uniquely qualified to 
explain nutrition and health to his 

141
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:30,370
phone.

142
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,690
Absolutely.
So my name is Rhonda Patrick,

143
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,750
I have a phd in biomedical science.
I did my undergraduate work in 

144
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,710
biochemistry,
chemistry,

145
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,210
um,
and now I'm doing a postdoctoral 

146
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:45,210
fellowship,
um,

147
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,100
nutrition and metabolism.
So I,

148
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:51,101
uh,
started out with synthesizing peptides 

149
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:54,850
and doing organic chemistry and I got 
really bored with that and I was a 

150
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:58,010
undergraduate student research and 
research and intern.

151
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,460
So then I decided to try biology out and
I went to the Sulk Institute for 

152
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:08,110
Biological Sciences in La Jolla and I 
did some research on aging using worms 

153
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,660
as a model because they haven't really 
short lifespan.

154
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:13,661
And so it was really cool to do a lot of
genetic manipulation and see how that 

155
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,660
changed our lifespan.
And from there I was like,

156
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,310
oh my God,
I freaking love this.

157
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:20,090
I want to get my phd in biology.
And I decided to go to Memphis,

158
00:08:20,091 --> 00:08:25,091
Tennessee because a,
I wanted to do research on cancer.

159
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,650
And a St Jude Children's Research 
Hospital is located in Memphis,

160
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:32,651
Tennessee.
So I ended up going to University of 

161
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:32,870
Tennessee to get my phd,
but I did all my research at St Jude.

162
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:36,080
Absolutely fantastic place.
And then,

163
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,370
uh,
so I was doing a lot of research using 

164
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,031
mice and um,
some human cells and then I decided I 

165
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:46,961
wanted a moment,
people just glossing over that I did 

166
00:08:46,961 --> 00:08:49,241
research with mice and human cells and I
mean I could go on and on about my 

167
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,810
actual research mice people.
No,

168
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:53,540
no,
I didn't make,

169
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:56,250
I've been most people.
But um,

170
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:02,260
I,
I did a lot of work on Mitochondria and 

171
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,071
mitochondrial metabolism and how that 
relates to cancer and how cells die and 

172
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:05,370
how they don't die and what,
you know,

173
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:10,610
what's going wrong with cancer.
And I got a really awesome publication 

174
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:10,610
out of it and uh,
nature.

175
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,640
And um,
then I decided that I was really wanting

176
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,710
to move on to something,
you know,

177
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:18,600
during your phd you like dig,
dig,

178
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:18,990
dig,
dig,

179
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,830
dig deep deep mechanism,
you know.

180
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,370
And finally you got to get,
you just keep digging deeper.

181
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:28,371
And I felt like I was lost from like 
what everything meant and what was the 

182
00:09:28,371 --> 00:09:28,770
significance of it,
you know?

183
00:09:28,771 --> 00:09:33,771
And so,
and you kind of have to do that in Grad 

184
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:33,771
school because you're learning the 
tools,

185
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:34,620
you know,
how to use tools to answer questions,

186
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:36,640
what kind of questions and how you 
answered them.

187
00:09:36,641 --> 00:09:37,630
And so,
uh,

188
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,010
I did really a lot of that and,
um,

189
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,580
then I decided I wanted to kind of take 
a step back and look at the big picture 

190
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:46,580
and,
uh,

191
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,960
do some clinical research and apply the 
tools that I learned in graduate school 

192
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,710
and try to learn some things using,
you know,

193
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:53,600
looking at,
you know,

194
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,830
people.
Um,

195
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,230
so now I'm at the Children's Hospital 
Oakland Research Institute.

196
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:03,231
We're working with Bruce Ames,
a WHO's pretty famous for his aims test 

197
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,560
carcinogenicity test where he basically 
made this test.

198
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,760
I could help you figure out whether or 
not a chemical was a Mutagen,

199
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:11,490
meaning it caused cancer.
Um,

200
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,640
and so I'm working with him and I'm 
actually looking at,

201
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:19,641
um,
what causes the amount of looking at a 

202
00:10:19,641 --> 00:10:21,570
lot of things.
But I'm actually a fundamentally looking

203
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:26,571
at people that are obese and how obesity
accelerates the aging process of people 

204
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:28,150
that are obese,
die,

205
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,870
have all sorts of age related diseases 
sooner.

206
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,610
Cardiovascular disease,
type two diabetes,

207
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,990
cancer by the age of 40.
They like there's a 14 year,

208
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,200
a reduction in their lifespan,
which is I think even greater than 

209
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,991
smoking cigarettes.
So I'm trying to understand fundamental 

210
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:49,190
fundamental mechanisms like why these 
people are accelerating their aging 

211
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,640
process.
And so I'm actually looking at something

212
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,290
specifically.
I'm looking at their DNA.

213
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,520
So,
um,

214
00:10:53,521 --> 00:10:58,521
I'm taking blood cells so we draw blood 
from people that have a bmi of 30 or 

215
00:10:58,521 --> 00:11:01,050
above or 25 and below which are 
considered normal or lean,

216
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,370
which is body mass index.

217
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:07,930
And you know,
it's just problems with like using body 

218
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:08,550
mass index as a marker for,
you know,

219
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,720
obesity,
because,

220
00:11:09,721 --> 00:11:10,680
you know,
some people,

221
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,370
some people are,
you know,

222
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,580
lean and anyways,
it's,

223
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,880
it's kind of marquee,
but I'm not going to go into that.

224
00:11:17,881 --> 00:11:21,600
So I'm actually looking at a.
So I take their,

225
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,350
their blood cells and I,
I look at their DNA.

226
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,900
Um,
and how much damages in their DNA,

227
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:29,910
and I kinda want to get into that a 
little later.

228
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,300
I'm kind of explain what that is,
but that's Kinda what I'm doing.

229
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:38,510
Um,
I'm also doing some research on vitamin 

230
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:40,671
D and I have a paper that's actually 
coming out in six days.

231
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,870
It's going to hit the press.
Um,

232
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,450
I found that vitamin D actually regulate
Serotonin,

233
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,950
so it's really cool.
That makes sense for people in Seattle.

234
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,980
Don't get any vitamin D,
they don't get any sun.

235
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:55,600
They're all bummed out.
It ain't no thing.

236
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:57,910
Every winter people in northern 
latitudes,

237
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,260
a lot of,
a lot of people are,

238
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,570
uh,
having adequate levels of vitamin D.

239
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,710
So it's,
it's a really important finding to.

240
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,950
So that can actually affect your mood.
Supplementing with vitamin D when you 

241
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,190
live in a place where it doesn't get 
sun.

242
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,430
No,
I'm not going to talk about the details 

243
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,430
of this paper because there's like an 
embargo and all that,

244
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,531
but I will talk about absolutely 
serotonin affects mood behavior,

245
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:25,310
you know,
so that's why I was asking if Tryptofan 

246
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:27,030
was in your Alpha brain because trip to 
fan is a rare amino acid that occurs in 

247
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:30,460
protein and most people think that,
oh,

248
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,960
I eat Turkey,
I'm getting my trip to fan.

249
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:35,920
But the thing is is that trip to fan,
in order to get converted into Serotonin

250
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,800
has to get transported into your brain 
through this transporter.

251
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,780
It converts to five htp,
correct.

252
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:45,840
It does convert to convert to that we 
have five htp and then it converts into 

253
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,150
Serotonin.
Yeah.

254
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:49,300
That's one of the principle of 
ingredients and knew mood knew mood is a

255
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:54,330
five htp and defend the idea being that 
there's a sort of a slow release effect.

256
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,480
The ultra defend converts to five htp 
and then five htp convert to Serotonin.

257
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,770
Five htp can actually cross the blood 
brain barrier so that can already get 

258
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,140
converted into Serotonin in your brain 
and and Tryptophan.

259
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:12,150
So tryptophan actually competes with 
other branch chain amino acids like 

260
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,150
Leucine,
leucine,

261
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,260
to get transported into the brain and it
loses.

262
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,350
So losing these branched chain amino 
acids they're at and protein.

263
00:13:18,351 --> 00:13:23,351
So what ends up happening if you're not 
taking something like five htp or 

264
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:23,351
something else,
is that um,

265
00:13:23,351 --> 00:13:27,740
most of the time you're not getting 
enough tryptophan transport into your 

266
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:27,740
brain.

267
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,070
Now certain things can help alleviate 
that competition like exercise.

268
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:35,071
So exercise.
You take up a bunch of branch chain 

269
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,171
amino acids to make muscle.
So exercise actually boost Serotonin in 

270
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:39,220
your brain by allowing Tryptofan to get 
transporting to brain.

271
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,490
Alleviating some of that competition 
from other branch chain amino acids.

272
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,250
Yeah,
and actually it's really interesting.

273
00:13:45,251 --> 00:13:48,460
They've done,
you can actually deplete someone's brain

274
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,480
tryptofan by giving them a big bolus 
shake of branch chain amino acids 

275
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:57,631
because then it really out competes all 
the trip to fan that you've from your 

276
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,711
diet and within like four or five hours,
you can deplete like 90 percent of 

277
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,960
someone's brain serotonin.
And then they do all these like 

278
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,360
behavioral tests to see what,
you know,

279
00:14:07,361 --> 00:14:08,680
what the,
what the results are,

280
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,190
what,
how,

281
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,060
how not having Serotonin in your brain 
impacts behavior and cognitive function.

282
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,750
And they found that it really,
there's a lot of things that are sort of

283
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:18,730
messed up if you're not making 
Serotonin,

284
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,400
you become impulsive,
impulsive behavior.

285
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,650
Your longterm thinking kind of,
you know,

286
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,390
shuts down.
Um,

287
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:28,090
some of your method.
He actually,

288
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:33,091
there's a study,
there was a study where they compared 

289
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,270
methamphetamine users,
cocaine users,

290
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,160
and then they depleted just normal 
people.

291
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:41,161
They depleted their trip fan by that 
method I just told you about and 

292
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:44,641
depleting the trip to fan.
So basically depleting the Serotonin in 

293
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:47,611
your brain.
You were your do your scoring just as 

294
00:14:47,611 --> 00:14:50,761
bad as a meth user.
And Actually Meth Amphetamine Does 

295
00:14:50,761 --> 00:14:50,980
Deplete Your Sarah Tone.
Isn't that frightening?

296
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:54,440
Wow.
So that's wild wild.

297
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,210
You know,
Sarah,

298
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,270
the fact that serotonin's affecting our 
behavior and that it's basically,

299
00:14:59,271 --> 00:15:04,271
you know,
Tryptophan and vitamin D are important 

300
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:04,700
for that.
People don't realize,

301
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:05,810
you know,
nutrition effects,

302
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,310
effects the way your brain works.

303
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,130
It does.
And it's so confusing.

304
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,160
And when you're a regular person that's 
trying to go online or read books about 

305
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,320
health and nutrition and what you need,
what you don't need,

306
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,630
there's so much contradictory 
information.

307
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,180
There's so many people that tell you you
don't need anything.

308
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,530
Just a balanced diet.
Well,

309
00:15:24,531 --> 00:15:26,560
what's a balanced diet?
Well then that gets squirrely.

310
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,640
You know,
the balanced diet includes grains.

311
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:29,360
Whoa.
No,

312
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:32,000
don't eat gluten.
Gluten's bad,

313
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,620
you know,
stay away from eggs,

314
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,020
eggs contain,
you know,

315
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,910
it just gets so weird.
There's so much information.

316
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:41,300
It's so hard to separate the wheat from 
the chaff.

317
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,320
That's the expression,
right?

318
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,100
Wheat from the chaff.

319
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:46,480
Totally agree.
So much noise out there.

320
00:15:46,481 --> 00:15:48,710
And it's very confusing.
Um,

321
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,780
you know,
and it's,

322
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,910
yeah,
you get getting your nutrition from your

323
00:15:51,911 --> 00:15:53,140
diet.
Well that would be ideal.

324
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:55,220
But the reality is we have,
you know,

325
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,240
the National Institute of Medicine that 
we're conducting these surveys every 

326
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,121
five years.
They call them the nutrition and 

327
00:16:03,121 --> 00:16:03,820
examination health surveys.
And hanes is very notorious.

328
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:04,830
Um,
you know,

329
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:08,410
in the nutrition field there,
we consider n hanes surveys to be pretty

330
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,920
accurate in determining what people are 
getting from their diet.

331
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,410
And you know,
these surveys are telling us no,

332
00:16:14,411 --> 00:16:16,900
people are not getting what they need 
from their diet.

333
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,900
The majority of Americans are not 
getting what they need in terms of,

334
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,910
you know,
micronutrients.

335
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,030
Yeah,
it's really hard to do so.

336
00:16:24,031 --> 00:16:28,740
And to do so on a daily basis requires 
you to really eat clean and healthy.

337
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:31,290
Mean you can get what you need from your
diet.

338
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:36,291
But boy,
you have to really mind what you're 

339
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:36,291
eating.

340
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:37,040
You have to really work at it.
And it's,

341
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,120
yeah,
it's a lot of effort.

342
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,020
Um,
you know,

343
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:40,350
it's,

344
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,500
and there's also the difference between 
the idea of you just surviving and not 

345
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,820
getting a disease and you being at 
optimal health.

346
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,400
Absolutely,
absolutely.

347
00:16:49,401 --> 00:16:52,670
That's something that our lab works on,
you know,

348
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:56,240
but where we've got this sort of theory 
that it,

349
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:00,950
it's hard to do aging studies in people 
and particularly looking at different,

350
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:05,951
you know,
vitamins and minerals and what effects 

351
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:05,951
they have longterm.
Um,

352
00:17:05,951 --> 00:17:10,090
but that's,
that's one of the theories in our lab 

353
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,220
that we've shown some evidence of it,
um,

354
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:13,000
is that,
you know,

355
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:14,990
the,
a lot of vitamins and minerals,

356
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:19,970
there are cofactors for many different 
biochemical pathways in your body.

357
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:23,300
Like if you were just gonna go buy a 
biochemical pathways,

358
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,010
you'll see this massive image come up 
and it's just like holy crap,

359
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:33,011
like,
and vitamins and minerals are cofactors 

360
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:35,711
for enzymes,
meaning they need to be there for the 

361
00:17:35,711 --> 00:17:39,011
enzyme to work optimally in enzymes and 
proteins in your body are doing 

362
00:17:39,011 --> 00:17:39,080
everything.
I mean,

363
00:17:39,081 --> 00:17:41,700
that's what's right and what's doing 
everything everybody's doing.

364
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,970
Um,
and so if you don't have,

365
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:49,030
you know,
there's certain proteins that are 

366
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:49,270
important to survive right now,
like your sodium potassium atpase know,

367
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,630
you want to make sure your heart's 
getting the right signals you want.

368
00:17:51,631 --> 00:17:52,950
I mean,
if that shuts down,

369
00:17:52,951 --> 00:17:54,240
then you're dead,
you know.

370
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,530
So I mean,
some of these,

371
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,620
some of these functions are more 
important.

372
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:01,860
So that's the biochemical pathways.
I'm talking about these.

373
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,920
And that's just a snapshot,
that's just a snapshot.

374
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:05,370
So,
I mean,

375
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,420
all these different pathways,
they require vitamins and minerals,

376
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,610
essential fatty acids.
I mean,

377
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,070
these things,
it's complicated.

378
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,410
And so cheeseburgers don't,
don't give that everything it needs.

379
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,210
No,
they don't.

380
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,800
No,
they don't.

381
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,870
They don't.
And what,

382
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,680
you know,
what is it,

383
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:32,090
what is it that someone should 
absolutely supplement with on a daily 

384
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,980
basis?
You know,

385
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,990
I would say definitely most people are 
not getting enough vitamin D and that 

386
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,490
is,
it's a steroid hormone.

387
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:47,210
It's a hormone that controls the 
expression of over a thousand different 

388
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,471
genes in our body,
which is literally like 24th of our 

389
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:51,780
human genome,
many of them in our brain.

390
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:56,070
Um,
so what that means is without vitamin D,

391
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:59,070
so vitamin D is so important that we can
make it from the sun.

392
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,360
Problem is,
we're not,

393
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,960
we're not doing that anymore.
Most of us aren't out in the sun a lot,

394
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:05,070
you know,
I know I'm not,

395
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:07,120
I'm always at my computer inside.
Um,

396
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,050
and when I'm out I'm,
you know,

397
00:19:09,051 --> 00:19:12,480
we're worried about skin aging if you're
a female or skin cancer,

398
00:19:12,481 --> 00:19:14,760
you know,
and so I'm bring sunscreen of course.

399
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,150
Um,
and as a majority of the people from the

400
00:19:18,151 --> 00:19:18,900
surveys,
you know,

401
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:24,050
if you look at people that supplement 
and don't supplement in the United 

402
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:27,320
States,
about 70 percent don't get adequate 

403
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,301
levels of vitamin D and actually the way
we determine what's adequate is based on

404
00:19:29,821 --> 00:19:33,350
vitamin D's classical function of bone 
homeostasis,

405
00:19:33,351 --> 00:19:38,351
you know,
so we know vitamin D is important to 

406
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:38,351
make sure that our bones don't,
don't start breaking down,

407
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:43,520
but in fact there's a thousand other 
things it's doing and we don't know how 

408
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:43,530
much vitamin D we need to do those other
things,

409
00:19:43,531 --> 00:19:46,410
but to at least maintain that,
that's considered adequate.

410
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:51,410
And that's like 30 nanograms per 
milliliter of the precursor vitamin D 

411
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,360
called 25 Hydroxyvitamin d,
which is what most people,

412
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,520
when you get your levels measured,
that's what they measure.

413
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,670
So what should you take on a daily 
basis?

414
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,980
I would say,
you know,

415
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,660
definitely you should probably be taking
a vitamin D supplement.

416
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,420
And what dose do you think?
So here's the thing,

417
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,560
you know,
a lot of different things regulate 

418
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,350
vitamin D,
absorption and bioavailability.

419
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:14,190
Body fat,
for one,

420
00:20:14,191 --> 00:20:18,570
it is a fat soluble vitamin.
So the more body fat you have,

421
00:20:18,571 --> 00:20:23,571
the more it's stored in that fat and the
less of it can be released in the 

422
00:20:23,571 --> 00:20:27,591
bloodstream to be circulated and brought
to different organs in your body and 

423
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,720
then get into the cells to do its thing.
Um,

424
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:33,830
so people that are obese actually 
require much higher levels of vitamin D 

425
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,230
because it will be,
you know,

426
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:39,570
it's been shown that vitamin D 
bioavailability is reduced by up to 50 

427
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,200
percent and like severely obese people.

428
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,160
So that's one thing to consider is how 
much per body fat,

429
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,370
body,
fat.

430
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,430
Um,
I think generally a good marker is like 

431
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:51,580
a thousand I use per 25 pounds,
but like I said,

432
00:20:51,581 --> 00:20:54,700
25 pounds.
You can be 25 pounds of muscle.

433
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:55,300
And so,
you know,

434
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:59,860
I think the best way to really gauge how
much vitamin D you need is to just get a

435
00:20:59,861 --> 00:21:01,330
test.
Just go,

436
00:21:01,331 --> 00:21:01,950
you know,
if you,

437
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,240
if you have health insurance,
health insurance pays for it.

438
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:09,510
Um,
there's other places that you can get 

439
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,500
vitamin D levels tested cheaply,
very cheaply and it's just so worth it.

440
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:16,501
Like,
I get mine tested routinely because I 

441
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:16,501
just want to make sure that my,
you know,

442
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:18,820
dosing is pretty good.
Like I personally take 4,000

443
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:21,610
Ius a day.
Is that a lot?

444
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,920
Um,
I think that's pretty,

445
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,540
pretty standard for an adult.
Uh,

446
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:26,800
that's,
you know,

447
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:29,650
normal weight and in pretty good shape.

448
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,370
Uh,
yeah,

449
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:35,371
I think that's pretty standard,
but I can't say that everyone should go 

450
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:35,680
out and take 4,000.
I use a day.

451
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:41,180
It can say that you should definitely 
make sure that you have levels in your 

452
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,400
blood that's higher than 30 nanograms 
per milliliter,

453
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,280
which is above the adequate status.
And actually,

454
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:48,160
if we look at studies where they've 
looked at,

455
00:21:48,161 --> 00:21:50,350
for example,
all car cause mortality,

456
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,160
lowering,
lowering,

457
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:52,270
all calls,
mortality,

458
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,530
they've shown that,
um,

459
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,620
you know,
huge like large cohort studies.

460
00:21:56,621 --> 00:22:01,621
They've done,
they've looked at the levels of vitamin 

461
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:01,990
D and then looked at mortality,
dying of different,

462
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:02,830
you know,
diseases,

463
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:08,380
uh,
people with levels of vitamin D between 

464
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:11,641
40 and 60 nanograms per milliliter and 
their blood had the least amount of all 

465
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:16,681
cores caused mortality.
So basically they were living the 

466
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:16,681
longest.
Um,

467
00:22:16,681 --> 00:22:16,900
so,
you know,

468
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:21,901
maybe you want to have between 40 and 60
nanograms per milliliter or based on 

469
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:21,980
that study,
uh,

470
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:22,780
you know,
it's,

471
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,690
it's,
it's important to get the levels tested.

472
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,370
That's,
that's Kinda what I like to,

473
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,800
uh,
advocate because it's so cheap and easy 

474
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:32,800
use

475
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,220
and why not very few people ever get the
body tested for their vitamin levels.

476
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,270
It's,
it's,

477
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,170
it is kind of unusual that we think 
about health and nutrition,

478
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,900
but how few people actually get their 
blood tested.

479
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,710
It's the future really.
I mean we're going to start to do that.

480
00:22:48,711 --> 00:22:53,711
It preventative medicine,
being able to know if we have adequate 

481
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:56,311
amounts of vitamin minerals,
it's gonna get easier and easier the 

482
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:57,670
next couple of decades.
I think you reached out to me because of

483
00:22:57,671 --> 00:23:02,671
people on the podcast saying things that
you didn't think were accurate and you 

484
00:23:02,671 --> 00:23:03,680
got upset and sent me some videos and 
some,

485
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,970
some different things.
So the sort of describe what 

486
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,100
disinformation these people were 
releasing more erroneous information,

487
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:14,700
right?
Like,

488
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,020
give us some specifics.
So what thing will,

489
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,100
let's just talk about what bugged you.
One of the erroneous facts were that 

490
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,110
most people,
most Americans,

491
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,450
get all the micronutrients they need 
from their diet.

492
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,280
That was Brian Dunning.
That was Brian.

493
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:31,770
Denny is not proportionately based on,
you know,

494
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,660
the National Institute of Medicine doing
these surveys.

495
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,720
We know that's not correct.
And in fact they've even done surveys 

496
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:39,720
where they've,
you know,

497
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,580
looked at people that supplement versus 
people

498
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,580
that don't supplement and people that 
supplement have much more adequate 

499
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,900
levels of these certain vitamins and 
minerals.

500
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,100
So,
you know,

501
00:23:49,101 --> 00:23:49,790
that's,
that's,

502
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,070
that's already the first thing that's 
not true.

503
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,560
Um,
and the,

504
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:55,280
you know,
the,

505
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,320
this recent editorial that came out in 
the annals of internal medicine was 

506
00:24:02,931 --> 00:24:07,931
really upsetting because they were 
basically saying that multivitamins do 

507
00:24:07,931 --> 00:24:09,230
nothing and not only do they nothing,
do nothing,

508
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,390
they're bad for you.
And you mentioned that,

509
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:15,140
you actually mentioned that on that 
podcast that you had with dunning.

510
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:16,370
Yeah.
That's,

511
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:19,610
that research that they.
First of all,

512
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:24,611
I think it's one of most irresponsible 
studies or the most irresponsible press 

513
00:24:24,611 --> 00:24:28,931
releases I've ever read because if you 
actually read what the studies were in 

514
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:31,850
comparison to what they're saying,
they're saying vitamins don't work,

515
00:24:31,851 --> 00:24:36,851
case closed,
but the studies that they did were on 

516
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,380
Alzheimer's patients not showing a any 
sort of improvement.

517
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:43,280
People over 65 that had heart attacks 
not showing any improvement.

518
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:47,810
I mean just those two things were two 
out of the three tasks that they did at.

519
00:24:47,811 --> 00:24:52,811
They're saying that vitamins don't work 
when you're talking about a generic 

520
00:24:52,811 --> 00:24:55,530
multivitamin to synthetic multivitamins,
one of those centrum ones,

521
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,670
those ones that they find in the bottom 
of Porta potties.

522
00:24:58,671 --> 00:25:00,020
By the way,
when they clean out,

523
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:05,290
they find them.
They find those little blue pills still 

524
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,470
like intact,
like they pass through people's back.

525
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,160
Allegedly that might not be true.
I've never learned.

526
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,080
What do I know if I even looked online 
to research.

527
00:25:12,081 --> 00:25:14,900
Now I'm just parroting it like little 
minor bird,

528
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:19,040
but the studies themselves were were 
really shocking.

529
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,410
I mean,
I'll read you the the three things.

530
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,740
A male physicians over 65 showed no 
improvement in cognitive decline using a

531
00:25:27,171 --> 00:25:30,230
generic multivitamins supplementation 
like they're dying.

532
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,040
Oh God.
Can I please just tell me that?

533
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,440
So that study was so infuriating because
they were giving these,

534
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,090
these guys six.
Okay.

535
00:25:38,091 --> 00:25:43,091
This was supposed to be a high dose 
multivitamin and they were giving him 

536
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:43,100
six pills a day.
Six pills a day.

537
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:44,750
Okay.
I take a high dose multivitamin.

538
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:46,310
It's one pill a day.
Okay.

539
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:49,820
And their,
their total vitamin D levels were,

540
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,880
were like 100.
I use like 100 I use a vitamin D won't 

541
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,570
do anything and that was considered a 
high dose.

542
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,690
And their compliance meaning.
Okay,

543
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,960
you're asking someone to take six pills 
a day for like 10 years.

544
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,420
And then you,
you call them up every three months.

545
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:07,880
And did you take your six pills?
Well,

546
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:09,230
I took it yesterday.
So,

547
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:10,180
you know.
Yeah,

548
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:13,820
I took it for the last three months.
They didn't measure any,

549
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:16,820
there was no quantitative like 
biochemical analysis,

550
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,680
meaning they didn't measure any,
uh,

551
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,220
any vitamins like choose one vitamin 
that's in that your,

552
00:26:22,221 --> 00:26:27,221
your multivitamin concoction and see if 
what you're giving them actually raises 

553
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:27,221
the level of that,
you know,

554
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:30,140
to show that they're a compliance,
be that you're giving them a dose that's

555
00:26:30,141 --> 00:26:31,220
actually doing something.

556
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:34,450
So you're leaving it up to the person to
take it as well.

557
00:26:34,451 --> 00:26:35,680
And especially when you're doing the 
study,

558
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:36,360
they did.
Yeah,

559
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:37,810
that's,
that seems pretty faulty.

560
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,670
And also you say that you take 4,000
units and they had 100.

561
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,210
That's not so good.
The other aspect of the study was that 

562
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,300
high dose multivitamins had no effect on
the progression of heart disease and 

563
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:51,750
heart attack survivors.
Again,

564
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,910
they're dying,
right?

565
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,030
These are dying people.
I mean this is not people who.

566
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,420
Preventative medicine is what.
One of the things you talked about 

567
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:02,420
earlier about testing blood.
And I,

568
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:07,180
I really think that that is the key.
It's not about catching you when you're 

569
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,911
falling apart.
It's about making sure you don't fall 

570
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:13,701
apart.
Giving your body the natural building 

571
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,260
blocks to repair cells to keep your body
healthy from the jump.

572
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:21,770
And that's what we should be doing.
We should be doing in intelligently 

573
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:23,670
thinking ahead while you're healthy,
while you're young.

574
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,160
It's so true.
I mean,

575
00:27:25,161 --> 00:27:30,161
I'll give you an example.
So 45 percent of the US population 

576
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,390
doesn't have adequate levels of 
magnesium and you know,

577
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I think,
I think most people in the fitness 

578
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:39,400
community are concerned with magnesium 
because they're always like,

579
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,250
oh my God,
I sweat it out.

580
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,490
I got to replace my magnesium.
You know,

581
00:27:42,491 --> 00:27:46,070
I think that's their major concern or 
muscle cramping and things like that.

582
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:51,071
But magnesium is an essential cofactor 
for a DNA repair enzymes.

583
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,320
So let me explain what that is,
because poorly,

584
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,150
what's DNA repair enzymes.
So,

585
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,400
you know,
uh,

586
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,250
everyday just normal metabolism.
So our mitochondria are there,

587
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:06,170
they're taking food that we eat in,
whether it's carbohydrates or protein or

588
00:28:06,171 --> 00:28:11,171
fat,
and they're generating what's called 

589
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:11,810
electron reducing equivalents through 
this whole krebs cycle.

590
00:28:11,811 --> 00:28:16,811
If you ever learned in biochemistry and 
those electron reducing equivalents are 

591
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:19,370
really important because they have a 
hydrogen which has an electron.

592
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:23,330
And a proton and these electrons get 
passed along inside your Mitochondria,

593
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:28,331
these various proteins,
and they shoot out protons at the same 

594
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:32,351
time and this is basically the way it 
generally generates energy to then take 

595
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:36,521
the oxygen you breathe in and reduce it 
to water and couple that to making ATP 

596
00:28:36,521 --> 00:28:40,610
anyways so these electrons get passed 
around and what happens is they often,

597
00:28:40,611 --> 00:28:45,611
because you're taking oxygen,
you breathe in and making water to 

598
00:28:45,611 --> 00:28:46,370
generate the energy you need to make 
atp.

599
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:49,940
You start making super oxide and on and 
you start making reactive oxygen species

600
00:28:49,941 --> 00:28:52,520
in your Mitochondria.
Everyday we're doing this,

601
00:28:52,521 --> 00:28:57,521
we're doing it right now.
I mean that's the major source of 

602
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:57,860
reactive oxygen species.
I'm sure you've heard of that.

603
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,040
And your body.
I'm in these reactive oxygen species.

604
00:29:01,041 --> 00:29:02,210
They react.
That's what they do.

605
00:29:02,211 --> 00:29:04,880
They react with your DNA,
the react with liquids.

606
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:10,270
Your cell membranes erected the proteins
and the damage and what happens when 

607
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:11,420
you're doing,
it's called DNA damage.

608
00:29:11,421 --> 00:29:13,680
When it reacts with Your Dna,
you know,

609
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:15,860
sometimes you get like an,
a,

610
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:21,690
you know,
a bulky Adec that's attached on or 

611
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,450
sometimes you get like an oxide of 
product which then can cause a break.

612
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,550
Your DNA is double stranded and cause a 
break.

613
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,230
And what happens is,
you know,

614
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,640
the cells in your,
in different organs like your kidneys 

615
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:33,640
and your liver,
these cells have a limited lifespan.

616
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,130
And so they have to replicate,
you know,

617
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:40,150
I'd have to synthesize their DNA 
replicate in order to replace their 

618
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,670
limited lifespan.
So,

619
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:45,910
um,
when the cell then tries to replicate 

620
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:45,910
its DNA and there's just like funny 
stuff there,

621
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:46,960
it doesn't,
it's like what is this?

622
00:29:46,961 --> 00:29:48,880
And then sometimes it puts another 
nucleotide,

623
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:52,900
what's not supposed to be there and it 
causes a mutation and then you have this

624
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:53,440
mutation.

625
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:53,980
It's like,
okay,

626
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:55,660
well you can't go back once you have a 
mutation,

627
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:57,310
it's there.
So,

628
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,500
you know,
if it's a mutation in a coding region of

629
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:02,800
a gene that does something important,
then you could really screw stuff up.

630
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,330
And so,
um,

631
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,720
in order to prevent that from happening,
we have what's called DNA repair 

632
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:09,720
enzymes.
Okay,

633
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:13,441
and they basically take this damage 
that's there and they repair it and 

634
00:30:13,441 --> 00:30:16,570
those DNA repair enzymes require 
magnesium without magnesium.

635
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,880
They do not work,
did not work well.

636
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:24,010
They're very inefficient.
And so if you're not getting enough 

637
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:28,171
magnesium,
your DNA repair isn't going well and 

638
00:30:28,171 --> 00:30:28,630
you're probably getting more damaged.
But the thing is that this is,

639
00:30:28,631 --> 00:30:33,631
this is a decade,
it takes decades for this to rear its 

640
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:33,631
head.
You know,

641
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:34,780
you've got a bunch of you and we've got 
DNA damage,

642
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,180
but you can't look in the mirror and be 
like,

643
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,510
oh,
I have DNA damage today.

644
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,730
You know,
it's like,

645
00:30:39,731 --> 00:30:40,870
well,
you can look in the mirror and be like,

646
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:43,180
oh my gums are falling apart.
I probably have scurvy.

647
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,680
So it's like,
you know,

648
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,410
this is something you can't see and what
happens is over a year,

649
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:53,610
over decades of getting this DNA damage,
because it happens at random places in 

650
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,691
your genes.
Eventually you get it into place that 

651
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:00,181
you don't want.
You get it in a gene that's important 

652
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:02,761
for controlling cell cycle or stopping 
bad cells from dividing and 

653
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:07,771
proliferating.
These are called tumor suppressor genes 

654
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:10,680
and when you get it in one of those,
you're screwed because now you got some 

655
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,161
funky cell that doesn't pass those 
checkpoints that usually our genes and 

656
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,800
making sure they don't pass the 
checkpoint if they're funny,

657
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:23,130
and then they'll pass it and they start 
dividing and proliferating and now 

658
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,600
you've got this clonal population of 
cancer cells,

659
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,000
but you know,
that takes decades to happen.

660
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,330
So if you're walking around with not,
you know,

661
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:35,450
not sub adequate levels of magnesium,
you're not going to know anything until 

662
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,760
you're in your fifties or sixties and 
you know,

663
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,960
you come down with cancer.
Wow.

664
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:45,390
So that's intense.
So now when you read something like 

665
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:45,390
this,
uh,

666
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:45,880
you know,
vitamins don't work,

667
00:31:45,881 --> 00:31:50,881
case closed and you find out this is the
research that they did and this is the 

668
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:51,760
conclusion that they came to from the 
research.

669
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,180
That's so irresponsible and so 
infuriating.

670
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,500
I agree.
It's,

671
00:31:56,501 --> 00:32:01,501
you know,
there's a lot of studies out there that 

672
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:02,140
I've done Meta analyses and shown just 
the opposite.

673
00:32:02,141 --> 00:32:07,141
You know,
it's not like this is the only research 

674
00:32:07,141 --> 00:32:07,240
that's been done on vitamin and mineral 
supplementation.

675
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,750
The thing that's really infuriating is 
the big overgeneralizations they did 

676
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:13,690
here,
you know,

677
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:18,691
for example,
there there is an important case were 

678
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:23,341
taking some vitamins and minerals can be
bad and that is when you have cancer and

679
00:32:24,461 --> 00:32:29,461
you know,
these people had the opportunity to 

680
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:29,461
point that out instead of just saying,
oh,

681
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:31,840
vitamins or bad meaning like everyone 
shouldn't take vitamins.

682
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,280
They have,
you know,

683
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,980
in my opinion they have,
they should,

684
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,830
they should be educating people on,
okay,

685
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:41,510
well you already have cancer.
This can happen to you.

686
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:44,290
So you know,
the perfect example is full eight.

687
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,810
Okay.
Full eight isn't essential b vitamin and

688
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,040
it's mostly fortified in a lot of our 
breads and even junk food like chips and

689
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,110
I've seen it in chips and crackers and 
stuff,

690
00:32:54,111 --> 00:32:58,710
so I'm not that many people in the 
United States are deficient in anymore.

691
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,530
I think like 14 percent of the 
population.

692
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:02,510
So it's not a huge,
huge problem.

693
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:07,511
Like it was.
However I'm full eight is it's essential

694
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,690
to make one of your nucleotides in your 
DNA timing,

695
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,770
which means without full eight you're 
not making mean and you have to.

696
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,900
You need full eight to basically make 
new DNA for these new cells that you're 

697
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:21,000
making in your body every day.

698
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,130
Okay,
so when you don't have full eight,

699
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:28,450
that can actually cause a single strand 
break in your DNA and it can do the 

700
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,141
stuff I was telling you about by causing
mutations and leading to cancer 

701
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:32,480
eventually.
However,

702
00:33:32,481 --> 00:33:35,330
if you already have cancer,
everything that's good for you,

703
00:33:35,331 --> 00:33:37,160
cancer,
it's like cancer drugs on crack,

704
00:33:37,161 --> 00:33:37,700
man.
That's like,

705
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:38,780
oh,
it's good for you.

706
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:39,770
Yeah,
it gave me some of that.

707
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:40,590
You know,
it's,

708
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,710
it's like they,
they just take over everything that's 

709
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:45,950
good and because well,
you know,

710
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:47,630
they want to keep that.
That's their goal,

711
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,910
propagate.
I want to propagate and take over.

712
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,540
So with fall late because cancer cells 
are,

713
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,870
they're dividing,
they're trying to replicate themselves.

714
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:02,170
They love fully.
They love it because that's what they 

715
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,410
need to make more DNA to make more of 
their cancer cells.

716
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,950
So someone that already has cancer 
shouldn't be taking high levels of Foley

717
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,610
and really I think these people that 
wrote this editorial had an obligation 

718
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,790
to educate them and specifically point 
this out.

719
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,820
There's a mechanism why,
let's talk about it instead of making 

720
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,630
this huge overgeneralization saying 
multivitamins are bad.

721
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:26,110
What do you think the motivation behind 
the study or the conclusion like that 

722
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:29,510
since it seems kind of unscientific,
it's confusing,

723
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:34,511
like I don't understand why they would 
be motivated to say that based on the 

724
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:38,141
findings of the got,
unless putting out that sort of 

725
00:34:38,141 --> 00:34:41,051
salacious headline would get people 
thinking or get people responding and 

726
00:34:41,051 --> 00:34:42,950
cause attention to their work.
Absolutely.

727
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,690
It's,
it's attention grabbing,

728
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,120
negative negative things like that get 
press,

729
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,220
they get attention.
I don't know what their motive was.

730
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,280
Honestly.
I F I kind of feel like that's part of 

731
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,370
it.
I think another part of it is that a lot

732
00:34:58,371 --> 00:35:03,371
of medical doctors,
they aren't trained in nutrition and 

733
00:35:03,371 --> 00:35:04,280
they aren't trained in preventative 
medicine.

734
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,640
They aren't trained to understand the 
importance of all these vitamins and 

735
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,791
minerals and essential fatty acids and 
how their cofactors for these proteins 

736
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:13,820
and what they're doing longterm versus 
short term.

737
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,170
They're not.
That's,

738
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,430
you know,
when they're trained,

739
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:21,431
they're.
They're actually trained to understand 

740
00:35:21,431 --> 00:35:22,070
how different pharmacological drugs act 
on certain receptors.

741
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:22,470
How that,
you know,

742
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,840
it's,
it's kind of a different training.

743
00:35:24,841 --> 00:35:29,360
So I think in some cases when you start 
talking about nutrition and preventative

744
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,950
medicine,
a lot of people,

745
00:35:30,951 --> 00:35:34,610
if you don't know about it and you get 
kind of threatened and you feel like,

746
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,390
oh,
it must be wrong,

747
00:35:35,391 --> 00:35:37,320
I don't know about this,
you know,

748
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,030
kind of like one of those responses and 
I.

749
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:43,800
and I think that may also have something
to do with the fish.

750
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,290
A lot of the physicians that are,
we're involved in the,

751
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:49,010
there's a lot of people that want to be,
there's this,

752
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:53,790
this is need to be like a no nonsense 
person Ho come on and all that.

753
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,700
Who,
that's a bunch of Hooey,

754
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,890
you know,
need any of that so complicated.

755
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Is that a response to not wanting to 
delve into the incredibly deep waters of

756
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:06,710
nutrition and figure out what all these 
mechanisms are?

757
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,860
Is it just the sort of a knee jerk 
reaction to,

758
00:36:09,861 --> 00:36:11,300
oh,
it's a bunch of bs.

759
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:14,910
I think there's two.
I think there's two reasons.

760
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,410
I think.
One is absolutely,

761
00:36:16,411 --> 00:36:21,411
it's a visceral response because there 
is a load of crap out there and it's 

762
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:24,861
hard.
It is hard to differentiate between 

763
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:25,560
what's the noise in the signal.
And so some people are just like,

764
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:26,340
oh,
it's all crap,

765
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:31,360
you know,
but I think there's also people that 

766
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:31,360
just,
it's just too much work.

767
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,490
Like,
you know,

768
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:37,491
I want to keep eating what I'm eating 
and I want to believe it's fine and 

769
00:36:37,491 --> 00:36:37,491
that's what I want to believe in.
So I'm going to believe it.

770
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:41,370
I think that's another really mindset 
that needs to be changed.

771
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,920
And I think,
you know,

772
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,150
personally,
I would love to see people eating more,

773
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,730
more Greens.
Um,

774
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,850
you know,
more more of these dark green leafy 

775
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:57,180
vegetables which are rich and many 
different micronutrients like vitamin K,

776
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,210
folic acid and magnesium.
Um,

777
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,470
I can talk about that in a minute,
but I think for people that are just,

778
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,370
that aren't going to do that,
you know,

779
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,380
at least give them a vitamin that's 
going to give him some of these trace 

780
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:12,741
elements and minerals and vitamin D and 
some of these important micronutrients 

781
00:37:12,741 --> 00:37:14,850
that they really do need.
Magnesium.

782
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,490
You know,
so at the very least it's just,

783
00:37:17,491 --> 00:37:19,590
it's an easy way to do it,
you know,

784
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,790
it's an easy way to do it.
Yeah.

785
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Some,
it seems to me that in order to really 

786
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,210
get a grasp on what is required,
what is necessary for your body,

787
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,890
it takes an incredible amount of study.
I mean there's,

788
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,740
there's so much information that you 
have to get,

789
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:43,790
not just as far as dietary information,
but supplemental information is,

790
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:49,250
there's just so much.
It's almost feels you feel a little 

791
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:53,600
hopeless.
Like trying to absorb it all and figure 

792
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,211
out what,
what you actually need and what you 

793
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:56,211
don't need.
And when you read a study like that,

794
00:37:56,211 --> 00:37:56,790
vitamins don't work.
Case closed.

795
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,020
Good.
Now I can not think.

796
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:03,270
Let me push that aside and just fucking 
have an apple and feel like I'm doing my

797
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:03,660
job.

798
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,910
You know,
one of the reasons why I made a video to

799
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:07,770
this,
you know,

800
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:10,990
responds to this editorial was because,
you know,

801
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:15,991
a,
because I could have done some 

802
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:15,991
scientific paper and gone through peer 
review and,

803
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:16,170
but,
but you know,

804
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,690
I want to get it to the people and it's 
like at some level,

805
00:38:19,691 --> 00:38:21,130
you know,
this other scientists,

806
00:38:21,131 --> 00:38:24,220
they don't really care.
I want the people to realize that,

807
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:25,180
you know,
because these people,

808
00:38:25,181 --> 00:38:30,181
like my dad,
my dad takes a multivitamin and he 

809
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:30,880
listens to the news.
He gets his information from the TV like

810
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,180
that generation does and you know,
it's just,

811
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,270
it's so upsetting.
Like all of a sudden my dad could stop 

812
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,090
taking his vitamin and I don't want them
to stop taking his vitamin because it's,

813
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:45,390
you know,
it's important that he does take his 

814
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:45,390
multivitamin.
Uh,

815
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:45,390
there,
there are certain,

816
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:50,160
you know,
think components in that multivitamin 

817
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,160
that I know he's not getting from his 
diet,

818
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,480
so at least let them get it from his 
multivitamin.

819
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,060
So I this,
this study,

820
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:00,330
there was a Meta analysis that included 
like 30 different studies and I really 

821
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:04,000
read through them all and there were a 
lot of methodological errors and I point

822
00:39:04,001 --> 00:39:05,590
them out in the video where people were 
just,

823
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,580
they weren't measuring levels of any 
vitamins and minerals and saying they're

824
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,630
there were measuring some outcome like 
cardiovascular disease or cognitive 

825
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,190
function without any biomarkers.
Like there was no biomarkers saying,

826
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,360
oh look,
we gave him this,

827
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,800
this changed,
you know,

828
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:22,900
that's important when you're doing 
nutrition research.

829
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,030
Um,
and that's a really important thing.

830
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:26,860
And if you look at some of the studies 
that did do that,

831
00:39:26,861 --> 00:39:28,990
for example,
when they were giving them vitamin D,

832
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,580
they gave him vitamin D to a severely 
deficient population,

833
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,850
which is like 12 nanograms per mil.
That's severely deficient.

834
00:39:36,851 --> 00:39:41,851
We're talking like rickets deficient.
And then after their supplementation 

835
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:41,851
they were still deficient.

836
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,180
They were still less than 20 nanograms 
per mil,

837
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:45,190
which is considered deficient.
So it was like,

838
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:50,191
okay,
well you're trying to look at this 

839
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:50,191
outcome.
And yet the vitamin D supplement,

840
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:54,811
you know,
the dose that you gave these people was 

841
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:54,811
inadequate.
They didn't,

842
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:54,811
you didn't raise their levels to 
anything,

843
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:58,240
you know,
that was considered adequate by,

844
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:02,500
by the National Institute of Medicine.
Now when when people take vitamin D,

845
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,100
which is the exact vitamin D,
they're supposed to take it,

846
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:06,760
they're supposed to take like d,
Two,

847
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:07,450
d,
three,

848
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,650
d,
three,

849
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,420
d three.
You can take d two,

850
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:14,350
but it's just less efficient to get 
converted into the active hormone.

851
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:16,810
T three is optimal.
D three is optimal.

852
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,030
Yeah.
T three is optimal and you know,

853
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:24,031
like I said,
I personally can't tell people how much 

854
00:40:24,031 --> 00:40:24,460
to take.
I can tell them what I take,

855
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:30,030
which is $4,000
a day and honestly I can tell them that 

856
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:33,291
they should have levels of vitamin D in 
their blood greater than 30 nanograms 

857
00:40:33,291 --> 00:40:37,801
per mill and we should also tell them,
if you're not familiar with taking 

858
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,370
vitamins and minerals,
vitamins need to be taken with food.

859
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,180
Yeah,
I mean you can definitely get nauseous 

860
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,401
if you're,
if you're taking your vitamins on an 

861
00:40:47,401 --> 00:40:48,280
empty stomach,
plus some vitamins like vitamin B 12.

862
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,190
If you're a.
If you have a.

863
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,740
If you don't have an acidic environment 
in your stomach,

864
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,180
you know,
you,

865
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,210
you basically,
if you have to have aesthetic of an 

866
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:00,820
environment than you can't absorb it.
So it's like there's,

867
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:05,821
there is factors that come into play.
I mean it's complicated and also your 

868
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,400
gut bacteria also play a role in what 
you're absorbing,

869
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,610
particularly in minerals and.
And so when you take vitamins on an 

870
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:18,631
empty stomach,
if they're not attached to fats and 

871
00:41:18,631 --> 00:41:19,670
proteins and carbohydrates,
do they absorb as easily?

872
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,670
It seems that,
wow,

873
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,510
I think there's been research done that 
shows that your,

874
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:29,511
your,
your body doesn't really exactly know 

875
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:29,511
what to do with vitamins and vitamin 
form.

876
00:41:29,511 --> 00:41:32,680
If you take them on an empty stomach 
with no food attached to them.

877
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:33,740
I

878
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:35,720
mean,
I think it depends on what,

879
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,390
if it's a mineral,
what vitamin.

880
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:40,340
I mean,
I'm not exactly sure,

881
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,570
but some things you're supposed to take 
on an empty stomach,

882
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:44,500
like amino acids,
some amino acids.

883
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,930
You take it on an empty stomach.
I'm not exactly sure about that.

884
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:48,800
Yeah,
sorry.

885
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:50,420
So complicated.
Even for Rhonda,

886
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:56,530
I'm saying that's what I'm saying.
It's like there's so much to know about 

887
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,040
what to take away to my friend Dr Mark 
Gordon.

888
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:03,041
Every time I talked to him he fills my 
head up with shit that I'm never going 

889
00:42:03,041 --> 00:42:05,511
to remember the newest information,
Glutathione and this and that and just,

890
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:08,180
it's hard.
It's hard to keep up with it.

891
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:11,640
It is hard.
Things do get complicated and,

892
00:42:11,641 --> 00:42:13,540
and you know,
I,

893
00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:15,650
I don't have all the answers,
but I do.

894
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:18,680
I do dig pretty deep and try to get some
information out there to people.

895
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:23,300
That's why these folks who are inclined 
to be of the no nonsense group,

896
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,640
uh,
they find it so easy to dismiss this.

897
00:42:25,641 --> 00:42:27,610
I have a friend who's one of those,
you know,

898
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,800
he,
he and I were talking and he goes,

899
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,190
he was like,
he had this smug look on his face,

900
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:36,440
see that thing they said about vitamins,
they don't work.

901
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,820
And I said,
did you read it?

902
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,050
And he said,
look,

903
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,490
I glossed over it.
I go,

904
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:42,520
did you fucking read it man?
He goes,

905
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,210
well,
they say vitamins aren't working.

906
00:42:44,211 --> 00:42:47,120
I go to some what they say and then I 
showed him what they actually said.

907
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:48,560
He was like,
get the fuck out of here.

908
00:42:48,561 --> 00:42:49,610
That was the test.
And I go,

909
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:50,630
yeah,
that was the test.

910
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,080
Old people with heart attacks and they 
gave him a pill.

911
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:56,690
Oh,
they didn't fucking die in a a longer.

912
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,550
They didn't live any longer.
Crazy.

913
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:03,830
And how do you even measure cognitive 
decline in people over 65 with cognitive

914
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:06,740
decline by a phone call,
by the way isn't real.

915
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:10,670
Was by phone call,
by a phone call.

916
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,230
So they called them up.
How you feeling?

917
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:15,260
Okay.
No improvement,

918
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,020
no improvement by a phone call that,
that was.

919
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,310
That was,
that really got me.

920
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,460
Wow.
The specific.

921
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,280
You were reacting to Brian dunning.
Who uh,

922
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:30,330
what specific things was he saying that 
you got so fired up about that you had 

923
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,580
to contact me?
Um,

924
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:32,750
well,
one was that,

925
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,360
that everyone gets there.
It's there.

926
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:40,420
Yeah.
And the other thing was he was saying 

927
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,800
that was the vitamin C thing that was 
getting to me too.

928
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,260
He,
he was going on about not needing a 

929
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,390
thousand milligrams of vitamin C and 
then I looked up some of his stuff and 

930
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,511
he was also talking about vitamin C,
napping important or not doing anything 

931
00:43:55,511 --> 00:43:59,081
for immune function,
and then he started talking about some 

932
00:43:59,081 --> 00:43:59,081
Linus Pauling's.

933
00:43:59,081 --> 00:44:02,150
I can tell you what's wrong with that 
guy and it a bunch of things,

934
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:06,260
but one of the main reasons he does what
he does is that he grew up Mormon,

935
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,680
very strict Mormon background and then 
refuted it and now he's an adult and 

936
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,601
he's just not gonna take any nonsense.
He grew up with all nonsense and now 

937
00:44:16,601 --> 00:44:21,341
he's no nonsense and I have a unique 
insight into this because I have some 

938
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:23,930
friends that grew up Mormon and now they
are.

939
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:29,260
They abandoned it actually in their 
forties and it's really interesting 

940
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,680
because they're like children in a lot 
of ways.

941
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:31,920
They really

942
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,070
are.
They're the fundamentalists lifestyle 

943
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:37,830
like growing up in a fundamentalist 
religion where everything is spelled out

944
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:42,831
for you and everything is preposterous,
but you've accepted that your whole 

945
00:44:42,831 --> 00:44:45,240
life.
You've accepted and you were told not to

946
00:44:45,241 --> 00:44:48,510
question and you're told to follow the 
rules of this,

947
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,080
this ideology,
when you get away from that and you need

948
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:54,120
to try to like figure the world out on 
your own.

949
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,370
You're thinking and developed in this 
incredibly fucked up way,

950
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:04,640
the way you make your connections to 
things like you have this black and 

951
00:45:05,371 --> 00:45:10,371
white sort of connection thing going on 
in your head and that's his 

952
00:45:10,371 --> 00:45:14,790
fundamentalism translated to a 
fundamental skepticism.

953
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:20,150
So his skepticism is fundamentalism now 
he automatically is skeptical of 

954
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:26,511
anything that might require additional 
thinking or curiosity or or something 

955
00:45:27,181 --> 00:45:32,181
that's going to counter what like a,
a lot of people think like intuitively 

956
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:39,621
think to be true.
Like anything that is a bizarre or 

957
00:45:39,621 --> 00:45:42,360
weird.
Anything that like doesn't seem like you

958
00:45:42,361 --> 00:45:46,380
think about someone and then the phone 
rings and it's them nonsense nonsense.

959
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,430
Immediately try to stop that.
You know,

960
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:50,670
he doesn't want anything to be weird.

961
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:55,080
Can wipe it out from,
from a scientific perspective,

962
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:00,110
a sciences so often so often gray,
so often not black and white.

963
00:46:01,771 --> 00:46:04,900
I mean there are so many.
There are so many gray areas and there's

964
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:08,220
so many trade offs.
Trade offs are really another thing.

965
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:08,720
You know,
where you're,

966
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,970
you're doing something,
you're,

967
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:15,020
you have this certain Diet and you think
it's like going to give me best 

968
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:18,591
performance,
it's going to give me best cognitive 

969
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:18,591
function and make me live longer.
And it's like,

970
00:46:18,591 --> 00:46:22,581
well there's some trade offs here for 
getting all these things and I think 

971
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:23,430
actually a,
that's a really important.

972
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:28,820
It's not black and white and so people 
that have that type of thinking that 

973
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:29,550
have been trained that way and it just,
like you were saying,

974
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,120
you know,
they've,

975
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,270
they've built up these connections 
where,

976
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:32,820
you know,
it is,

977
00:46:32,821 --> 00:46:35,250
it's black and white and if it's not 
black it's definitely white.

978
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,800
And it's like that's just not how it,
how it

979
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,800
works.
Their religion becomes just this 

980
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,220
skepticism and instead of it being an 
open minded objective analysis of what's

981
00:46:43,221 --> 00:46:48,080
at hand and instead until they just want
to stuff it into this skepticism box,

982
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,270
you know,
and immediately debunk things.

983
00:46:50,271 --> 00:46:54,320
People love to debunk things.
It becomes like a badge of honor.

984
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,420
It becomes like they get a checkmark 
right in there,

985
00:46:56,421 --> 00:46:57,270
Carlo.
Yeah,

986
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:58,220
they do.
Well,

987
00:46:58,221 --> 00:47:03,221
I mean,
and when you're talking about science 

988
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:03,221
being gray,
of course oftentimes it's not.

989
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:04,370
They're not,
but often times it is,

990
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:09,550
but the reality of the science of 
biology is what's really important to 

991
00:47:10,191 --> 00:47:15,191
kind of drive home human beings very so 
much.

992
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:17,180
If you get a phone,
okay,

993
00:47:17,181 --> 00:47:18,560
look,
this phone that I have here,

994
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,440
I have a good one.
It works great,

995
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:26,710
but you could get a same manufacturer,
the same Samsung Galaxy note three.

996
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,980
You can get it from somebody else or 
from from a provider.

997
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,560
It's the same components.
It's built the same way.

998
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:35,830
It weighs the same thing on a scale and 
your sucks.

999
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:37,060
It fucking breaks,
right?

1000
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,680
It failed.
Let me give you a perfect example,

1001
00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:41,420
so I was talking about Foley,
right?

1002
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,500
It's important to make timing,
timing it.

1003
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,780
Nucleotide,
it's also important to when you eat 

1004
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,780
protein and amino acid protein,
it gets converted into homocysteine and 

1005
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,920
you need.
You need fall late because it's a methyl

1006
00:47:54,921 --> 00:47:59,921
donor that then gets methylated and 
reconverted back in any because you 

1007
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:03,731
don't want too much homocysteine around 
and you're in your body because it does 

1008
00:48:03,731 --> 00:48:03,731
bad things.
Um,

1009
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,760
you know,
basically makes protein started 

1010
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:08,760
aggregating and it causes vascular 
disease and cognitive decline.

1011
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,730
And anyways,
10 percent,

1012
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,170
no,
actually 10 percent,

1013
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,320
40 percent of North Americans have a 
polymorphism in a gene called the 

1014
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,120
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase,
also known as the mth empty t hfr or the

1015
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,220
motherfucker gene basically,
but 40 percent of North Americans have 

1016
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,080
this polymorphism in this gene that 
doesn't make it work correctly.

1017
00:48:33,081 --> 00:48:38,081
And so what ends up happening is they 
can't read methalate this homocysteine 

1018
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:41,090
to convert it back into mining.
So they end up having elevated levels of

1019
00:48:41,091 --> 00:48:46,091
homocysteine in your blood and unless 
they take more folic acid to sort of 

1020
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:51,611
compensate from that,
they're going to have higher levels of 

1021
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:51,611
homelessness in their blood and you 
know,

1022
00:48:51,611 --> 00:48:54,050
which will lead to vascular problems and
cognitive decline.

1023
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:56,870
So yeah,
exactly what the perfect thing.

1024
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:59,240
It's like how much full at I take versus
how much you take.

1025
00:48:59,241 --> 00:49:00,500
Or if I'm from Canada,
you know,

1026
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,580
who knows,
I mean,

1027
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,060
you may have this polymorphism and have 
to take,

1028
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,820
you know,
five times more fully than I do.

1029
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,480
Well,
there's also the variables like how many

1030
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:14,080
people grow up and uh,
you're,

1031
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:16,960
you're in an environment that your 
biology is not accustomed to.

1032
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:22,470
People who come from other countries and
then they're in a specific country 

1033
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:25,670
that's unique to their biology,
like if they're like what,

1034
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,800
what the native Americans experienced 
when they were introduced to alcohol,

1035
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:35,100
like this is not something that their 
biology was accustomed to and they 

1036
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,350
really didn't have the ability to deal 
with it.

1037
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:40,560
Whereas the Europeans who had been 
drinking alcohol for untold years,

1038
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:46,530
they were so accustomed to it,
it was a normal part of their existence 

1039
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:49,980
that their bodies have adapted to it.
Whereas the native Americans just 

1040
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,461
hadn't.
Your body adapts to what it needs to 

1041
00:49:53,461 --> 00:49:53,980
adapt to.
Your body adapts to its environment.

1042
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:58,981
Your body adapts to its diet.
Your body adapts to the genes that have 

1043
00:49:58,981 --> 00:50:00,970
been passed down for your ancestor to 
ancestor of epigenetics are attached.

1044
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,890
It's just,
there's so much.

1045
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:05,050
So for someone to say,
you know,

1046
00:50:05,051 --> 00:50:07,870
you don't need this and you do,
or it's like,

1047
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,310
it's,
there's so much.

1048
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,720
So there's so many variables.
There's so many components.

1049
00:50:13,721 --> 00:50:15,580
There's so it's so complicated.

1050
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,270
Absolutely.
I mean,

1051
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,490
even your gut microbiome like adapts 
like within 24 hours,

1052
00:50:22,491 --> 00:50:24,110
like if you're eating,
you know,

1053
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:29,260
mostly a protein diet,
the different like interior types that 

1054
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:29,650
are in your gut,
you know,

1055
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,130
or are there,
they've,

1056
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,890
they've shown that people that eat 
mostly meat and fat,

1057
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:39,110
there are bacteria,
they have bacteria that's like geared 

1058
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:39,830
towards breaking down amino acids,
breaking down lipids,

1059
00:50:39,831 --> 00:50:42,470
metabolizing glutamine because you're 
given it,

1060
00:50:42,471 --> 00:50:45,250
a ton of it.
But people that mostly,

1061
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:46,550
you know,
vegetable,

1062
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:48,830
fiber and carbohydrates,
um,

1063
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:53,570
they have a lot of bacteria that is 
involved in amino acid synthesis,

1064
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,940
synthesizing these things because 
they're not getting as much.

1065
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,960
But you can take that person that's had 
this longterm diet and give them,

1066
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:03,440
you know,
meat and within 24 hours to start to get

1067
00:51:03,441 --> 00:51:06,980
that bacteria that starts to break down 
the amino acids.

1068
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:11,981
So your,
your body is very plastic and it does 

1069
00:51:11,981 --> 00:51:13,100
adapt to different dietary changes.

1070
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:15,220
Do you take probiotics?
Um,

1071
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:16,400
I do.
So,

1072
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:18,470
uh,
yeah,

1073
00:51:18,471 --> 00:51:21,500
I do take probiotics.
I'm there.

1074
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:25,160
The whole gut is so,
it's so fascinating.

1075
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:30,180
Um,
I work with someone that's doing a lot 

1076
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:30,180
of research on the gut and so,
you know,

1077
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,410
I get to learn just just from their 
research and reading on my own,

1078
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:35,450
uh,
about the complexities of it,

1079
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:40,451
but it's fascinating like how important 
important that bacteria is in our gut 

1080
00:51:41,721 --> 00:51:43,510
and how important certain types are.
Um,

1081
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:47,810
and how that affects the way we respond 
to disease the way we age.

1082
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:50,390
Um,
so it,

1083
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,680
you know,
it's,

1084
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,840
it's complicated,
it's very complicated.

1085
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,360
It is complicated in the,
um,

1086
00:51:57,420 --> 00:52:02,240
the environment that's inside your gut.
It actually can contribute to your mood.

1087
00:52:02,270 --> 00:52:05,600
It can contribute to depression and 
attribute to all,

1088
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:08,420
all sorts of various aspects of your 
immune system.

1089
00:52:08,450 --> 00:52:10,070
Absolutely info.
Like if you're.

1090
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,360
So you know,
if your,

1091
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,940
if your gut is,
you know,

1092
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
if you have basically your innate immune
systems being active down there because 

1093
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,510
it's unhappy,
uh,

1094
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:25,511
you know,
causing inflammation and things like 

1095
00:52:25,511 --> 00:52:25,790
having high c reactive protein has been 
correlated to depression.

1096
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,310
I'm like,
that's actually a biomarker that you 

1097
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:35,111
know,
I think can be used with depression is 

1098
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:36,860
actually c reactive protein instead of 
just this vague kind of,

1099
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:37,910
okay,
I feel this,

1100
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:42,911
I feel that will,
let's measure your c reactive protein 

1101
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:42,911
levels.
Okay.

1102
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:42,911
Yeah.
Wow.

1103
00:52:42,911 --> 00:52:43,390
They're really high.
Um,

1104
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,710
they've even done some studies where 
they've,

1105
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:49,830
they've found they've gotten depressed.
Patients found that they had highest 

1106
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:52,280
direct protein,
gave him like two grams of EPA.

1107
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:55,730
EPA is the omega three fatty acid that's
important for.

1108
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,580
It's like anti-inflammatory as opposed 
to Dha,

1109
00:52:58,581 --> 00:52:59,420
which is most,
you know,

1110
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:03,920
most of your brain lipitor a Dha,
but two grams of EPA day,

1111
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:09,250
I forgot for how long,
but they lowered their c reactive 

1112
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:09,710
protein and helped with her depression.
Um,

1113
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:13,580
so that's pretty profound.
That's very profound.

1114
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:18,610
The,
the connection between the human body 

1115
00:53:18,610 --> 00:53:20,780
and depression is such a weird one 
because for so many folks,

1116
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:23,030
the go to a doctor,
they don't feel good.

1117
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:25,380
The doctor gives them an antidepressant,
they feel better.

1118
00:53:25,381 --> 00:53:26,160
And then that's

1119
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,560
it.
But there,

1120
00:53:27,561 --> 00:53:31,620
there could have been so many other 
factors that could have been manipulated

1121
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,590
either their diet,
their exercise routines,

1122
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,450
hydrating.
I mean,

1123
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,590
how many people are fucking just 
dehydrated.

1124
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:39,480
They'd feel like,
Shit,

1125
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:41,700
how many people get out of a bad 
relationship?

1126
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:42,420
And they feel like,
Shit,

1127
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:44,490
how many people have a bad job?
I mean,

1128
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:48,820
consider what people considered to be a,
you know,

1129
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,230
depression.
Uh,

1130
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:51,280
you know,
you're,

1131
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:53,310
you're moody,
you're down the dumps,

1132
00:53:53,311 --> 00:53:54,120
you're not,
you're not,

1133
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,820
you're not feeling good,
you're,

1134
00:53:55,821 --> 00:54:00,390
you have bad thoughts all the time.
And then consider what's the stimulation

1135
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:04,050
that your brain is receiving everyday 
while you driving and traffic in fucking

1136
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:09,051
pollution to a cubicle where you sit and
do shit that you don't want to do all 

1137
00:54:09,051 --> 00:54:13,460
day.
You get home and then you force feed 

1138
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:13,460
yourself,
you know,

1139
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:14,760
some terrible foods because you're 
depressed and you're,

1140
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:16,770
you know,
just sort of indulging,

1141
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:21,980
giving yourself some pleasure and 
fucking shitty macaroni and cheese or 

1142
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:25,791
whatever.
You're stuffing down your face and then 

1143
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:25,791
you wonder why you're depressed.
Right?

1144
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:25,791
Right.

1145
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,440
Absolutely.
This reminds me of a study where,

1146
00:54:26,441 --> 00:54:27,160
um,
they're,

1147
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:32,470
they're using telomere length.
So telomeres are like caps at the end of

1148
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:37,470
your chromosomes that prevent your DNA 
from degrading and from getting damaged.

1149
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:42,670
Um,
people often refer to like the tips of 

1150
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:43,180
shoelaces like telomeres because they 
prevent your shoelaces from fraying.

1151
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,430
And these telomere length,
they're really,

1152
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,410
they're there when you're young.
They're long,

1153
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,860
but each time,
each time your cell divides,

1154
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:55,890
they get shorter and shorter.
Like with each year they're getting 

1155
00:54:55,890 --> 00:54:58,320
shorter.
I think you lose like 22 nucleotides a 

1156
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,350
year off your telomeres and it's a 
biological marker for aging.

1157
00:54:59,351 --> 00:55:02,200
So the shorter your telomeres are a,
you know,

1158
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:07,230
the shorter your life is basically,
if you look at lingers for a young 

1159
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,661
person versus an old person,
you can see dramatic differences and 

1160
00:55:09,661 --> 00:55:13,560
stress.
Stress has been correlated with taking 

1161
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:13,930
like five years off your team length.

1162
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,580
And uh,
the opposite has been true.

1163
00:55:15,581 --> 00:55:17,260
Meditation,
they've shown that meditation,

1164
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,380
there's actually an enzyme that can 
rebuild your telomeres,

1165
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:22,480
but we didn't,
we don't express it in high levels,

1166
00:55:22,481 --> 00:55:27,481
it's called telomerase.
But Meditation can actually boost the 

1167
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:31,570
expression of telomerase and,
and cause your telomeres to get longer.

1168
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:33,940
So there's really something to that.
You know,

1169
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,820
having a more relaxed,
being able to meditate,

1170
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:38,900
not having a lot of stress,
uh,

1171
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:41,710
you know,
affecting the way you age literally.

1172
00:55:41,711 --> 00:55:44,380
And we have a biological marker for it.
Um,

1173
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:45,700
yeah,
it's really interesting.

1174
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,650
It's another thing,
vitamin D I wanted to,

1175
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:50,080
vitamin D affects the telomere length 
also.

1176
00:55:50,081 --> 00:55:51,460
Um,
if you,

1177
00:55:51,461 --> 00:55:56,461
if you google vitamin D receptor mice 
and pull up this image with the mice.

1178
00:55:57,221 --> 00:56:02,221
I'm aging mice,
so vitamin D actually does affect the 

1179
00:56:02,221 --> 00:56:02,560
way we age.
Um,

1180
00:56:02,561 --> 00:56:06,550
and they did this study on twins where 
they looked at their vitamin D levels,

1181
00:56:06,551 --> 00:56:09,790
they measured their vitamin D levels and
they looked at their telomere length and

1182
00:56:09,791 --> 00:56:14,110
they found that those twins with the 
highest levels of vitamin D also had the

1183
00:56:14,111 --> 00:56:19,111
longest telomeres that corresponded to 
actually five years being five years 

1184
00:56:19,111 --> 00:56:20,290
younger,
even though they were twins.

1185
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,020
They're same chronological age.
Their team members looked,

1186
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:25,990
they were five years younger if they had
higher levels of Vitamin D.

1187
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:27,490
Wow.
Yeah.

1188
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:31,750
So what do you know anything about t a 
65.

1189
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:37,170
I saw sort of a supplement that's 
supposed to enhance your telomere 

1190
00:56:37,871 --> 00:56:40,750
lengths.
I haven't heard of it.

1191
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:45,830
I'm now so,
but vitamin D exercise is another one 

1192
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,940
that does,
they've done studies showing a,

1193
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,530
again in twins,
uh,

1194
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:54,540
those,
that exercise the most actually had two 

1195
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,720
of them are length that corresponded to 
being 10 years younger.

1196
00:56:56,120 --> 00:57:01,120
And those,
that exercise sort of like average 

1197
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,120
compared to those that didn't have an 
average of like,

1198
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:02,770
I think four years.
So,

1199
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:03,490
you know,
there's,

1200
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:08,550
there's,
there's things that affect the way you 

1201
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:08,550
age and we have markers for that 
biological markers like Taylor,

1202
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,090
my length that,
that proves your lifestyle is indeed,

1203
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:15,400
you know,
affecting the way you age you.

1204
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,400
I'd read this telomere study and I'd 
seen this with this supplement.

1205
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:21,580
Whoa,
okay.

1206
00:57:21,581 --> 00:57:24,770
So let's check this out.
So those two minds on that decay,

1207
00:57:24,771 --> 00:57:27,630
these are the same age mouse said the 
top panel,

1208
00:57:27,631 --> 00:57:32,631
um,
these mice are about four and a half 

1209
00:57:32,631 --> 00:57:34,050
months old and the one on the left is a 
vitamin D receptor knockout,

1210
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:39,300
knockout mouse,
which means it can't respond to vitamin 

1211
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:39,300
D.
So it's like,

1212
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,270
it's like not having any vitamin D.
If you look at the lower panel,

1213
00:57:40,271 --> 00:57:42,520
those are the same age,
four months later.

1214
00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:47,040
Look how rapidly that mouse aging 
without having vitamin D.

1215
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,510
I mean,
there's lots of things going wrong.

1216
00:57:49,511 --> 00:57:54,511
I mean,
I told you that vitamin D's regulating 

1217
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:54,511
over a thousand different genes in your 
body.

1218
00:57:54,511 --> 00:57:56,260
So inflammation,
I mean cognitive function.

1219
00:57:56,261 --> 00:57:57,580
I mean there's,
there's a lot of things,

1220
00:57:57,581 --> 00:57:59,620
but look at that.
It's pretty striking.

1221
00:58:00,070 --> 00:58:02,740
Have you ever thought about going into 
business,

1222
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,880
like where you provide some sort of a 
service where people get tested and then

1223
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:13,570
they develop a specific vitamin 
protocols for each individual person?

1224
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:14,270
Yeah,
I know.

1225
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,920
We're like my,
my,

1226
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,550
my boss and I were,
we talk about that all the time.

1227
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,510
Why didn't you do it?
It sounds like I've got this asset where

1228
00:58:22,511 --> 00:58:27,511
I can actually measure DNA damage in 
your body from your blood and that's 

1229
00:58:27,511 --> 00:58:29,950
also a marker for age because the older 
you are,

1230
00:58:29,951 --> 00:58:33,370
the more DNA damage you have and I can 
measure that clinically.

1231
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,390
So what we're thinking is like giving 
people magnesium and seeing if we can,

1232
00:58:37,391 --> 00:58:42,391
you know,
less than that damage because there are 

1233
00:58:42,391 --> 00:58:42,670
DNA repairs working better.
Um,

1234
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,880
but that would be really cool.
Another thing would be vitamin D,

1235
00:58:46,270 --> 00:58:48,400
uh,
measuring during the vitamin D,

1236
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:48,910
magnesium.
Yeah.

1237
00:58:48,911 --> 00:58:51,820
I think there's,
there's a few,

1238
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:57,060
um,
micronutrients that we know of that are 

1239
00:58:57,060 --> 00:58:57,220
really important for longterm effects.

1240
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,790
You know,
like,

1241
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:01,060
like I was saying,
there's often this tradeoff where,

1242
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:02,600
okay,
let's say you,

1243
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:07,640
you've got,
you're getting some vitamin K but you 

1244
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:07,640
don't have enough.
In fact,

1245
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:08,110
35 percent of the US population doesn't 
get enough.

1246
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:13,170
Vitamin K,
vitamin K is found in plants because 

1247
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:14,080
it's a part of their,
they need it for photosynthesis.

1248
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,720
So if you're not eating a lot,
a lot of green plants,

1249
00:59:16,721 --> 00:59:18,160
then you know,
you're,

1250
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,290
you might not be getting enough vitamin 
K.

1251
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,860
um,
but you know,

1252
00:59:21,861 --> 00:59:25,060
vitamin K is often known for being part 
of coagulation,

1253
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,990
being important to make your blood clot,
right?

1254
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:30,980
And that's an essential function.
So I'm sure any vitamin K you're getting

1255
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:33,170
is going towards that because you want 
your blood to clot,

1256
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:38,171
right?
You don't want to bleed out and have a 

1257
00:59:38,171 --> 00:59:38,171
hemorrhage rate.
But there's other important functions of

1258
00:59:38,171 --> 00:59:42,431
vitamin K.
Vitamin K also prevents the 

1259
00:59:42,431 --> 00:59:42,431
calcification of the arteries.

1260
00:59:42,431 --> 00:59:46,330
And so if all your vitamin K is going 
towards the proteins that are important 

1261
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:50,741
for clotting than the proteins that are 
important for not having calcification 

1262
00:59:50,741 --> 00:59:51,020
in your arteries,
aren't getting any,

1263
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:51,770
and then,
you know,

1264
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,380
two,
three decades later and you start to see

1265
00:59:54,381 --> 00:59:58,580
this calcification in the arteries and 
in fact people that are given Warfarin,

1266
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:02,630
which is a really common,
a drug for inhibiting vitaminK ,

1267
01:00:03,290 --> 01:00:08,290
um,
they ended up having problems with 

1268
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,330
calcification of arteries and stuff.
So,

1269
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,960
you know,
there's,

1270
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:17,470
I think there's a lot to understanding 
how these micronutrients work that we 

1271
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:22,571
don't know yet and you know,
we're starting to try to be able to do 

1272
01:00:22,571 --> 01:00:23,760
some experiments to understand them.
But the,

1273
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,020
the bottom line is that,
you know,

1274
01:00:26,510 --> 01:00:30,230
your body's smart and if you don't have 
enough of a certain vitamin or mineral,

1275
01:00:30,231 --> 01:00:32,180
it's going to,
it's going to shunt it to the one that's

1276
01:00:32,181 --> 01:00:35,590
going to help you survive now and help 
you reproduce because that's the,

1277
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:37,460
that's what he wants to do.

1278
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:39,350
And these other things like,
you know,

1279
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:43,010
in Dna repairing damaged DNA or you 
know,

1280
01:00:43,011 --> 01:00:48,011
having to brain work optimally.
You don't have to be that smart to 

1281
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:48,011
survive,
you know,

1282
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:48,350
these things,
they probably get the short end,

1283
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:51,020
you know,
so it's kind of like,

1284
01:00:51,021 --> 01:00:56,021
it's a vitamins in my mind is sort of 
like a long longterm thinking when 

1285
01:00:56,021 --> 01:00:56,070
you're thinking long term.
It's like,

1286
01:00:56,071 --> 01:00:56,660
yeah,
okay,

1287
01:00:56,661 --> 01:00:59,660
well I'm not walking around with the 
acute deficiencies,

1288
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:01,550
which is what most people think when 
they're thinking,

1289
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:06,670
oh,
have enough vitamins and minerals 

1290
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:06,670
because I don't have very buried.
I don't have,

1291
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:06,670
you know,
these,

1292
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,810
these problems that are severe 
deficiencies.

1293
01:01:08,811 --> 01:01:10,760
That's like if you're severely 
deficient,

1294
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:13,070
you're going to have some symptoms that 
you'll notice,

1295
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:15,710
but most of these symptoms you're not 
going to notice and they,

1296
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:18,230
they're insidious damage.
It's happening,

1297
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,710
you know,
little bit at a time over decades.

1298
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:27,300
It's amazing to me that there,
there's not a lot of these like a center

1299
01:01:27,301 --> 01:01:32,301
where you could go and get a full workup
done and they provide you with like a 

1300
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,850
recipe for your vitamin supplementation 
needs

1301
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,620
the future.
That is what we want.

1302
01:01:37,621 --> 01:01:42,621
Like we want to get it to where we can 
just get a finger prick of blood and 

1303
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:45,240
will know different proteins.
We can measure that are we know,

1304
01:01:45,241 --> 01:01:50,241
are involved in longterm functions 
versus a short term functions of these 

1305
01:01:50,241 --> 01:01:51,460
vitamins and we can say based on,
you know,

1306
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,510
having looking at these proteins,
we can say okay,

1307
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:59,511
you need more of this and this and this 
vitamin like that's going to be the 

1308
01:01:59,511 --> 01:01:59,511
future.

1309
01:01:59,511 --> 01:02:00,520
It would seem like,
you mean you'd go to the dentist,

1310
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:05,700
the dentist is a normal common thing.
They're everywhere to repair your teeth 

1311
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:07,190
and that's such a basic thing,
you know,

1312
01:02:07,210 --> 01:02:12,210
but the idea of going to someone who 
measures your blood and finds out what 

1313
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:15,480
you're lacking in your diet,
that's not

1314
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:20,740
normal.
I think instead of going to a doctor to 

1315
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:21,030
try to find a quick fix to get some,
you know,

1316
01:02:21,031 --> 01:02:22,950
you're depressed.
So they gave you an Ssri.

1317
01:02:22,951 --> 01:02:25,410
Well you know,
we don't know what these,

1318
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,440
what the longterm effects of some of 
these pharmaceutical drugs are in our 

1319
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,021
brain.
Like they just had this study that came 

1320
01:02:33,021 --> 01:02:33,021
out a couple months ago on anti 
psychotics,

1321
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:38,030
which they give routinely,
gave people with schizophrenia and they 

1322
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:41,811
found that these anti psychotics in a 
dose dependent manner cause brain 

1323
01:02:41,811 --> 01:02:42,600
atrophy.
So.

1324
01:02:42,601 --> 01:02:44,520
And they followed these people for 15 
years,

1325
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:49,550
this is the first time,
this is the first longterm effect of 

1326
01:02:49,550 --> 01:02:52,881
Anti psychotics that came out that it 
was a really big study and they showed 

1327
01:02:53,371 --> 01:02:58,371
that these skits,
schizophrenia patients like the higher 

1328
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:01,191
the dose of Anti Psychotic,
they were on the more brain atrophy and 

1329
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:01,191
you know,
it's like,

1330
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:05,180
so here you are giving these people anti
psychotics and you know,

1331
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:10,580
15 years from now their brain is like 
literally it's an atrophying at a rapid 

1332
01:03:10,580 --> 01:03:10,580
rate.

1333
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:14,460
So that's just a classic example of us 
not knowing what some of these long term

1334
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:16,890
effects of some of these pharma logical 
drugs that we're doing.

1335
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:20,400
Especially when it comes to the brain.
There's so many feedback loops.

1336
01:03:20,401 --> 01:03:25,401
Like if you're,
if you're inhibiting serotonin from 

1337
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,651
being metabolized or re uptake,
I mean you've got serotonin sitting 

1338
01:03:27,651 --> 01:03:30,801
around your body,
starts to downregulate serotonin 

1339
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:31,410
receptors,
which is how your body responds to Sarah

1340
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:31,560
Tony.
You know,

1341
01:03:31,561 --> 01:03:36,561
it's like there's feedback things going 
on that I don't think we even 

1342
01:03:36,561 --> 01:03:36,750
understand.
And you know,

1343
01:03:36,751 --> 01:03:40,680
one out of 10 Americans is taking an 
Ssri so crazy.

1344
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:41,580
It's crazy.

1345
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:45,010
And I know that they have benefited some
people,

1346
01:03:45,011 --> 01:03:47,380
I know people that they,
sure,

1347
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:52,510
but it's,
it's have they exhausted all the other 

1348
01:03:52,510 --> 01:03:56,041
possible options.
I have a friend who's on an SSRI and he 

1349
01:03:56,041 --> 01:04:00,271
recently found out that he had been 
taking propecia and he recently found 

1350
01:04:01,541 --> 01:04:04,140
out that propecia actually caused 
depression on,

1351
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,060
in some people it can cause depression 
and some people.

1352
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:07,950
And uh,
he,

1353
01:04:07,951 --> 01:04:12,951
he quit,
he quit taking propecia and he's 

1354
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:14,620
starting to feel like maybe that was the
cause of the depression the first place.

1355
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:17,890
But he's unnecessarily now.
So now he has to figure out what to do.

1356
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:18,850
You know,
is it,

1357
01:04:18,851 --> 01:04:21,430
was it the propecia that caused his 
depression?

1358
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:25,540
Was it going to happen anyway?
Is it the SSRI that he needs?

1359
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:30,810
But he also eats a lot of candy and 
doesn't take care of his body and 

1360
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:30,810
doesn't,
doesn't really exercise.

1361
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:32,380
And you know,
has a shitty diet.

1362
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:37,860
All those things can factor into a,
a low production of Serotonin in your 

1363
01:04:37,860 --> 01:04:40,330
mind.
All those things can factor into,

1364
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:45,450
you know,
just a clogging of the pathways of 

1365
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:45,450
neurotransmitter.

1366
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:48,110
I mean to omega three fatty acids.
Um,

1367
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:51,630
you know,
30 percent of your brain is made up Dha,

1368
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:56,631
which is an omega three fatty acid and 
they've shown that actually Dha affects 

1369
01:04:56,631 --> 01:04:58,260
the way dopamine signaling in your 
brain.

1370
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:03,261
So you know,
and in terms of like back to the 

1371
01:05:03,261 --> 01:05:03,840
schizophrenia,
people with schizophrenia,

1372
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:08,870
you ha,
you make dopamine in this frontal part 

1373
01:05:08,870 --> 01:05:09,960
of your cortex and the dopamine that you
make there negatively feeds back on,

1374
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:12,210
on this dopamine that you make in the 
back part of your brain.

1375
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,790
And if you don't have that negative 
feedback,

1376
01:05:14,791 --> 01:05:18,160
what happens is you start making more in
that back part of your brand,

1377
01:05:18,180 --> 01:05:23,180
you start to have like negative things 
like hallucinations and paranoia and 

1378
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:23,180
things like that.
Yeah.

1379
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:28,170
And so they,
they've shown that Omega three that 

1380
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:28,170
they've actually given omega three fatty
acids,

1381
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:32,971
Dha to schizophrenia and shown that it 
actually elevates the dopamine and the 

1382
01:05:34,181 --> 01:05:37,300
frontal part of the brain and helps 
regulate some of that negative feedback,

1383
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,720
you know.
And so it's like how many people are 

1384
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,380
getting their eating fish every single 
day are getting their omega three fatty 

1385
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:46,750
acids for the brain every single day.
I mean,

1386
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,380
I know I am,
but I'm pretty much an exception,

1387
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:52,120
you know,
a lot of people that are depressed.

1388
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:53,410
Uh,
like I said,

1389
01:05:53,411 --> 01:05:58,411
the EPA is another big thing because 
inflammation has been shown to be 

1390
01:05:58,411 --> 01:05:58,870
correlated with depression.

1391
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,200
I'm a huge fan of omega three fatty 
acids,

1392
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:03,900
especially in fish oil form.
All right.

1393
01:06:03,901 --> 01:06:05,200
Lily,
they make such a huge,

1394
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:09,700
a difference in how my joints feel.
The inflammation,

1395
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,790
anti inflammation qualities of them are 
really incredible.

1396
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:18,480
It's one of the few things that I always
recommend to anybody if they tell me 

1397
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:18,810
they have knee pain or elbow pain or.

1398
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:23,060
Yeah,
I've seen studies on how EPA like giving

1399
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,500
even higher doses of EPA to people with 
arthritis,

1400
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:27,490
you know,
they're,

1401
01:06:27,491 --> 01:06:32,491
they're inhibiting some of the 
production of like arachidonic acid and 

1402
01:06:32,491 --> 01:06:33,070
some of these prostoglandins and things 
that are involved in inflammation,

1403
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,880
which a lot of people are getting 
because they're reading,

1404
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,640
you know,
they're getting a lot of omega six fatty

1405
01:06:36,641 --> 01:06:38,440
acids too.
So yeah,

1406
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,500
it,
I've seen studies where it like it's 

1407
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:43,500
been shown to improve it.
You know,

1408
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,250
you were looking at this mct oil over 
here and you were saying that it's 

1409
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:47,250
lacking something.

1410
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:50,380
Oh yeah.
So it's interesting because,

1411
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:51,610
um,
you know,

1412
01:06:51,611 --> 01:06:54,160
I,
I actually cook with coconut oil and I,

1413
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:55,140
uh,
at some,

1414
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:57,940
some periods of my life I'd put it in my
coffee,

1415
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:59,800
um,
and uh,

1416
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:03,790
but coconut oil has lower gas.
It's got medium chain triglycerides,

1417
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:08,791
which basically is 12 carbons are less,
lipids are just like long chains of 

1418
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:11,140
carbons,
you know,

1419
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:13,990
that are bound together with hydrogens.
So,

1420
01:07:13,991 --> 01:07:18,991
um,
the way your body processes long chain 

1421
01:07:18,991 --> 01:07:19,600
fatty acids is very different from short
chain fatty acids.

1422
01:07:19,601 --> 01:07:22,690
The way it,
as long chain fatty acids for one,

1423
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,280
I should probably get to that in a 
minute.

1424
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:26,170
Okay.
Let me start with a chain fatty acids.

1425
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:28,030
Basically you get your paper and pen 
ladies.

1426
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:30,970
Shit's going to go computer then it's,
it's,

1427
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,260
it's pretty awesome.
You know,

1428
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,020
your,
the way you digest,

1429
01:07:34,040 --> 01:07:36,130
it's different.
It goes straight to your portal vein and

1430
01:07:36,131 --> 01:07:37,810
it goes to your liver.

1431
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:39,400
Uh,
and then it gets,

1432
01:07:39,490 --> 01:07:42,400
goes into the Mitochondria without 
having to go through this like transport

1433
01:07:42,401 --> 01:07:47,401
system.
And it sort of slightly uncouples the 

1434
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:47,401
Mitochondria.
It's thermogenic and you know,

1435
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:49,480
it has all these great benefits for 
Mitochondria.

1436
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:55,350
But I'm an interesting thing with Laura 
[inaudible] acid is that it's also been 

1437
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:55,990
shown to be an appetite suppressant.
Um,

1438
01:07:56,170 --> 01:08:00,370
it's through a couple of these different
appetite suppressing hormones.

1439
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:03,070
I think CCK is one,
I can't remember what that stands for,

1440
01:08:03,071 --> 01:08:04,570
but you know,
uh,

1441
01:08:04,571 --> 01:08:06,860
and it's also antimicrobial,
so it,

1442
01:08:06,861 --> 01:08:09,460
it's been shown to kill off Candida 
Albicans,

1443
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:14,461
which is like a yeast.
So is 12 carbons and it's a lot of mct 

1444
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:16,100
oils

1445
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:21,100
don't have work acid and I don't,
I just can't figure out why they 

1446
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:23,120
wouldn't want lower gas had because when
I take coconut oil I'm like,

1447
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:24,560
you know,
lord acids,

1448
01:08:24,561 --> 01:08:26,540
like the thing that I'm really excited 
about.

1449
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,800
So it's not naturally in coconut oil or 
coconut oil,

1450
01:08:30,801 --> 01:08:34,690
but these mct oils that people put 
together some,

1451
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:37,740
a lot of them don't have acid in it 
because they'll,

1452
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:41,390
they'll have like less than 12 carbon.
So [inaudible] acid is a 12 carbon,

1453
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:45,050
a medium chain fatty acids and medium 
chain triglycerides.

1454
01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:48,440
How were they exactly extracted from 
coconut oil?

1455
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:53,441
Do you understand the process?
I don't know how they do that and 

1456
01:08:53,441 --> 01:08:53,441
haven't read about it.
Yeah,

1457
01:08:53,441 --> 01:08:55,340
there is some process that allows it to 
have this.

1458
01:08:55,341 --> 01:09:00,270
Laura and I spell it l a l a U R I c 
Lorac acid acid.

1459
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:01,220
It's awesome.
Well,

1460
01:09:01,221 --> 01:09:04,190
I want to make sure that on it starts 
making mct oil,

1461
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,560
mct oil with Lauren.

1462
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,040
And what are the benefits of Lorac acid,
again,

1463
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:14,041
specifically for,
for combining it with mct oil or making 

1464
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:17,681
sure that it is an mct,
but it's the benefits is one is that 

1465
01:09:17,681 --> 01:09:18,920
appetite appetite suppressing.
And two,

1466
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:21,980
it's a very strong antimicrobial,
so it's like good for your gut.

1467
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:24,710
It's,
it's killing off like yeast.

1468
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:28,340
It's been shown to kill off know 
Albicans Candida Albicans.

1469
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:33,710
Um,
it also has the same thermogenic 

1470
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:33,710
properties.
All the eight chain,

1471
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,910
a fatty acid tab.
They'll do some mct oils,

1472
01:09:36,911 --> 01:09:37,910
have it,
if you've seen it.

1473
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:42,240
A lot of mct now haven't done a survey.
I just look at this one.

1474
01:09:42,270 --> 01:09:43,260
I see that it says,
um,

1475
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,960
it says a eight carbon,
medium chain triglycerides from coconut 

1476
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:54,630
and palm kernel.
To me that says it's not having the 12 

1477
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:55,380
carbon,
which is lower acid,

1478
01:09:55,390 --> 01:09:57,620
but you know,
I don't know.

1479
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:04,690
Another thing that someone said to me 
that they were concerned about was that 

1480
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:08,650
it's stored in plastic.
Is there an issue with plastic leaching 

1481
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:13,570
chemicals into things like mct oil?
I mean they've shown that certain 

1482
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:15,290
chemicals,
you know,

1483
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:20,350
especially in presence of heat can leach
chemicals into whatever is in the 

1484
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:24,701
plastic container.
So if like that plastic container sits 

1485
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:28,001
in the back seat of your car and you'll 
lose your roll down or something along 

1486
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:30,791
those lines.
I always try to keep oils at 44 degrees 

1487
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:33,671
in the frigerator because it slows that 
obviously the oxidation process and all 

1488
01:10:33,951 --> 01:10:34,580
those,
the heat,

1489
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:36,590
you know,
slowed down.

1490
01:10:36,591 --> 01:10:41,591
So ideally though,
which should be stored in it shouldn't 

1491
01:10:41,591 --> 01:10:43,880
ideally be stored in plastic.
Should it be in a metal?

1492
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:45,820
Should it be in a class?
You know,

1493
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:51,280
it's not a real big concern of mine is I
haven't really put any thought into it 

1494
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,200
and as long as it's just not allowed to 
be exposed to heat and long as you're 

1495
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,620
reasonably sure that the process from 
the storage in the plant,

1496
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:58,130
you know,
the,

1497
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,450
the canning,
the bottling,

1498
01:10:59,451 --> 01:11:03,010
whatever it is to storage to store that 
you're,

1499
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:03,680
you know,
you're not,

1500
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:05,120
it's not sitting out in the sun.

1501
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:10,550
Yeah.
I mean is that something that people 

1502
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,370
were really concerned with Riley with 
plastic bpa.

1503
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,790
BPA,
which can leach into water and stuff.

1504
01:11:14,820 --> 01:11:15,660
Yeah.
A friend,

1505
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,150
his girlfriend went to drink a bottle of
water that was in the car that had,

1506
01:11:20,151 --> 01:11:21,570
she had sitting in the back seat.
He's like,

1507
01:11:21,571 --> 01:11:22,740
don't drag it,
you know,

1508
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:27,741
like it's a fucking bomb.
Mom did that to be really the same 

1509
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:27,741
reason?
Right.

1510
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:29,860
But the plastic,
is that something you.

1511
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,380
I mean,
if you have a bottle of water in sitting

1512
01:11:31,381 --> 01:11:36,381
in your car and it's a hot day,
should you not drink that bottle of 

1513
01:11:36,381 --> 01:11:36,480
water because it's been sitting in your 
car,

1514
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,450
it's probably not going to kill you to 
drink it once,

1515
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:41,700
but you know,
I wouldn't do it all the time.

1516
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:47,150
So what happens to the,
the bottle like heats up and then the 

1517
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:50,700
plastics leach out into the water and 
then it affects hormones in some sort of

1518
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:52,860
a way that,
you know,

1519
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I'm not an expert on.
I've done a little bit of reading on 

1520
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:58,620
that so I'm not going to claim to be an 
expert here.

1521
01:11:58,621 --> 01:12:03,621
But yeah,
they've shown that BPA can have some 

1522
01:12:03,621 --> 01:12:05,340
estrogen mimicking effects and know 
that's particularly,

1523
01:12:05,341 --> 01:12:06,780
I think a concern,
especially in,

1524
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:07,920
you know,
developing males.

1525
01:12:07,921 --> 01:12:12,921
And I'm going to email you this ta 65 
stuff because I want you to check it 

1526
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:15,320
out.
Please check the number,

1527
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:17,850
but it's about the tele telomere.

1528
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:25,440
Um,
so I'm gonna I'm emailing you that right

1529
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,320
now because I,
I had a friend who asked me about it and

1530
01:12:28,321 --> 01:12:31,560
I didn't know and I felt like you were 
the perfect person to throw this by.

1531
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:35,290
And then laura acid going to with,
like I said,

1532
01:12:35,730 --> 01:12:39,990
I don't ever buy mct oil myself.
Like I just use coconut oil.

1533
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:43,320
So is there a benefit of using coconut 
oil over mct oil?

1534
01:12:43,770 --> 01:12:45,330
Well,
only if the lord,

1535
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:49,620
I think lorich acids in a benefit,
but at the mct oil has lower acid in it.

1536
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:52,200
What's the benefit of mct oil or coconut
oil?

1537
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,360
I think they just let not having the 
other long chain fatty acids in there.

1538
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:02,290
And that's also in coconut oil would be 
those long chain fatty acids.

1539
01:13:02,310 --> 01:13:06,800
Beneficial.
It's just fat bad.

1540
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:09,570
So you know,
bad fat,

1541
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:12,050
good fat.
Debatable,

1542
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:13,320
right?
It's debatable.

1543
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,810
Yeah,
I think so.

1544
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,180
When it comes down to eating a lot of 
fat,

1545
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:20,110
you obviously need fat.
I mean fat,

1546
01:13:20,111 --> 01:13:23,070
it's important.
Need cholesterol for your brain.

1547
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:28,100
Sixty percent of your brain dry weight 
is that your cell membranes here that 

1548
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,440
the vegans out there,
you need cholesterol,

1549
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,720
you need cholesterol.
I say that in my act,

1550
01:13:33,750 --> 01:13:38,750
like as a joke about vs that they say 
things because they don't get 

1551
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:38,750
cholesterol.
Dude,

1552
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:43,850
this is what I'm talking about.
So I've done a little bit of research 

1553
01:13:43,850 --> 01:13:45,750
and I plan on doing more and actually 
coming out with a report on this,

1554
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,110
but I'll just talk about what I've done.
So like I planned,

1555
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:54,140
I like to dig,
really dig and make sure I'm 

1556
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,140
comprehensive,
but some of the,

1557
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:54,900
when you digest fats,
a,

1558
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:59,910
you have to make bile acids and in order
to make bile to basically be able to 

1559
01:14:00,331 --> 01:14:05,331
absorb them.
And some of these bile acids that you 

1560
01:14:05,331 --> 01:14:06,870
make when you digest fat are 
carcinogenic.

1561
01:14:06,871 --> 01:14:11,680
So a d deoxycholic acid dca

1562
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:12,400
is,
uh,

1563
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:14,170
is one that I'm talking about in 
particular.

1564
01:14:14,171 --> 01:14:15,120
So that's kind of like,
you know,

1565
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:20,130
every time you're eating fat,
your body's making this dca which 

1566
01:14:20,130 --> 01:14:23,791
damages Dna Damage Dna in your eps,
your epithelial cells lining your 

1567
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:23,791
intestine.
Um,

1568
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,590
so you know,
that's the sort of a drawback,

1569
01:14:26,591 --> 01:14:28,690
but it doesn't mean you should stop 
eating fat,

1570
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:33,710
just means you should be aware of your 
eating 60 or 70 percent fat diet that 

1571
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:38,341
you might want to consider some of these
longterm effects that could rear their 

1572
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:42,211
head later in life.
I'm also a eating fat increases igf one 

1573
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:48,740
a because igf,
igf one is a growth factor and you 

1574
01:14:48,740 --> 01:14:53,201
probably have heard of it because in the
fitness community it's sort of like a 

1575
01:14:53,201 --> 01:14:56,221
downstream mediator or growth hormone 
and people are always really excited 

1576
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:57,170
about having more igf one because it's,
you know,

1577
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:01,900
helps you bulk on muscle and on and 
things like that.

1578
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:06,930
But also it's,
if you have too much of it that you're 

1579
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:06,930
making over a lifetime,
it can.

1580
01:15:06,930 --> 01:15:08,700
It's a growth,
a signal that tells,

1581
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,440
tell cells to overcome the checkpoints I
was talking about earlier where,

1582
01:15:12,550 --> 01:15:17,550
where you have these checkpoints where 
if you have some damaged DNA that has a 

1583
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,040
mutation,
then the cell goes,

1584
01:15:18,041 --> 01:15:18,910
okay,
it's time to die.

1585
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,920
But lots of igf one there says,
oh,

1586
01:15:20,921 --> 01:15:22,270
I don't have to die.
I'm gonna keep going.

1587
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:25,630
So you know,
it's highly correlated with cancer.

1588
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:30,490
One Igf,
one being in high doses,

1589
01:15:30,491 --> 01:15:35,491
igf one being like what,
like what doses are correlated with 

1590
01:15:35,491 --> 01:15:35,590
cancer?

1591
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:36,810
Yeah,
that's a great question.

1592
01:15:36,811 --> 01:15:38,610
Yeah.
So basically people with cancer,

1593
01:15:38,611 --> 01:15:40,010
they have like,
it's just out of here.

1594
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,560
So people of gigantism,
they must have an issue with this,

1595
01:15:43,561 --> 01:15:48,561
right?
Like that's people that have like they 

1596
01:15:48,561 --> 01:15:48,600
have to,
like we've,

1597
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:53,620
we've,
we've had a few of those guys in mixed 

1598
01:15:53,620 --> 01:15:56,331
martial arts that had cancer of the 
pituitary gland and then they had the 

1599
01:15:56,331 --> 01:15:57,660
tumor removed so that they can compete 
in the United States.

1600
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,310
They were competing overseas and other 
and other organizations.

1601
01:16:01,311 --> 01:16:06,311
I can pry these to allow these guys to 
fight and they would be fucking these 

1602
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:08,340
literary giants.
We have a guy in the,

1603
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:11,100
in the UFC right now,
his name is bigfoot Silva,

1604
01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:12,510
Antonio bigfoot Silva.
He's,

1605
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:17,400
he has that disease and he had the tumor
removed from his pituitary gland and now

1606
01:16:17,401 --> 01:16:22,401
he functions on a normal basis,
but he has to supplement his hormones 

1607
01:16:22,401 --> 01:16:24,360
because of that.
And is that a similar thing?

1608
01:16:24,540 --> 01:16:29,540
I mean,
when you're talking about like high igf 

1609
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:29,540
one is that.

1610
01:16:29,540 --> 01:16:33,240
Yeah,
well if you're making a lot of growth 

1611
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:36,691
hormone from your pituitary,
I mean are they make these pds people 

1612
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:37,960
are making a lot of growth hormone?
Yes.

1613
01:16:37,980 --> 01:16:39,220
Yeah.
I would assume that me,

1614
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,070
that's why they're heads are so big and 
their,

1615
01:16:41,071 --> 01:16:44,410
their bodies are so distorted.
That's what he looks like now.

1616
01:16:44,890 --> 01:16:48,190
That's after the tumor removed.
It's,

1617
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:48,790
you know,
it's,

1618
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:53,810
it's really a fascinating situation 
because you look at the guy and it's 

1619
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,990
quite obvious that his body's gone 
haywire.

1620
01:16:56,450 --> 01:16:58,810
Skulls enormous.
His hands are enormous.

1621
01:16:58,811 --> 01:17:00,430
I mean there's.
You get to see what it looks like.

1622
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:02,540
I mean,
he has all the classic,

1623
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:03,640
very good fighter.
Yeah.

1624
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:07,020
Actually some people that are making 
when your,

1625
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:12,050
when your pituitary makes growth hormone
and then stimulates the liver to make 

1626
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:15,740
igf one that igf one negatively feeds 
back on the pituitary to shut it off,

1627
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:21,010
but people that have that sort of 
problem don't have that negative 

1628
01:17:21,010 --> 01:17:22,190
feedback and they ended up having all 
sorts of problems for one,

1629
01:17:22,370 --> 01:17:27,050
even though igf one can actually make 
your muscle cells insulin sensitive,

1630
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:32,110
which is good growth hormone,
can cause insulin insensitivity in like 

1631
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:34,280
your liver.
So they ended up getting,

1632
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:35,150
you know,
having,

1633
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:37,670
you know,
insensible insulin,

1634
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:42,671
insensitive liver cells and that's,
that's a major problem with a it with 

1635
01:17:42,671 --> 01:17:47,410
that.
And aren't there certain amino acids 

1636
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:49,901
that you can take before you go to sleep
that will stimulate your body's 

1637
01:17:49,901 --> 01:17:50,570
production of growth hormone?
I don't know.

1638
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:56,650
I know that I'm take protein and fat,
stimulate the production of igf one.

1639
01:17:58,160 --> 01:18:03,160
Um,
but I don't know about certain amino 

1640
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:03,160
acids you can take to stimulate growth.
I do know.

1641
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,730
So there's,
you know,

1642
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:09,410
growth hormone can be increased from 
exercise and also from the sauna.

1643
01:18:10,070 --> 01:18:11,360
The Sauna.
Oh yeah,

1644
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:14,450
the sauna.
There's this can increase growth hormone

1645
01:18:14,451 --> 01:18:16,400
to massive levels.
The Sauna.

1646
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:17,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1647
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:22,510
So like,
it's a good thing to go into a sauna 

1648
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:24,341
after your workout.
It's a great thing to go into the sauna 

1649
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:24,350
after you work out and it's also a good 
thing to go in the sauna when you're not

1650
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:29,351
working out if your muscle,
if you're injured because that prevents 

1651
01:18:29,351 --> 01:18:29,870
a atrophying of muscles.
Yeah.

1652
01:18:29,871 --> 01:18:32,780
So definitely.
That's incredible.

1653
01:18:32,781 --> 01:18:34,700
I've never heard that before.
My husband and I,

1654
01:18:34,701 --> 01:18:37,700
we did some,
I have a report coming out on this,

1655
01:18:37,701 --> 01:18:39,170
um,
and probably in a couple of weeks,

1656
01:18:39,171 --> 01:18:44,171
so I can't,
a friend of yours or I think his might 

1657
01:18:44,171 --> 01:18:45,040
publish it on their site,
so I'm not going to mind.

1658
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:50,170
Yeah.
So I'm not going to give Tim Tim 

1659
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:50,200
Ferriss.
Oh,

1660
01:18:50,210 --> 01:18:50,720
okay.
Cool.

1661
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:55,721
So I'm not,
I don't want to let the cat out of the 

1662
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:55,721
bag,
but I did.

1663
01:18:55,721 --> 01:18:58,130
My husband and I did a lot of 
experimentation with,

1664
01:18:58,460 --> 01:18:59,060
with,
uh,

1665
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,750
the sauna because we used to live next 
door to a why MCA,

1666
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,960
which had a sauna and so we would just 
go use the sauna like all the time.

1667
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,680
And aside from all the research that I,
that I did to write this article,

1668
01:19:09,681 --> 01:19:13,580
I'll just talk about my experience and 
like when I was injured,

1669
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:18,970
um,
I had some injuries and I couldn't work 

1670
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:19,490
out for like a month and I would do the 
sauna every day and I did not.

1671
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:22,220
I was not losing my muscle mass.
Like I would've,

1672
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:23,930
um,
if I wasn't injured.

1673
01:19:24,190 --> 01:19:27,020
Um,
and also it helped me deal with stress.

1674
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:32,210
Um,
and you just know Kayla and stress and 

1675
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:32,210
being able to focus.

1676
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:32,250
Yeah.
It's incredible.

1677
01:19:32,251 --> 01:19:37,251
And I'm so glad I talked to you today 
because I thought the sauna was 

1678
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:37,251
nonsense.
No.

1679
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:40,730
Was the other day I went to a spa and I 
got a little massage and then they had a

1680
01:19:40,731 --> 01:19:42,590
Jacuzzi and a sauna.
I was like,

1681
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,560
who goes in that stupid fucking song?
That shit ain't doing nothing.

1682
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,500
No hot in there.
It's doing so much.

1683
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:50,900
Why is it doing something?
It was just getting you hot.

1684
01:19:50,901 --> 01:19:52,700
I don't understand what's happening.
Yeah,

1685
01:19:52,701 --> 01:19:54,320
there's,
there's a lot of things going on.

1686
01:19:54,321 --> 01:19:55,400
But like,
uh,

1687
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:56,180
I'll,
I'll,

1688
01:19:56,420 --> 01:19:58,820
I'll tweet you the link.
Please do.

1689
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:03,850
Yeah.
Because email to me and then I'll tweet 

1690
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:05,180
it because I'll email it to you could go
right to the abyss.

1691
01:20:05,181 --> 01:20:08,280
There's too many people doing.
Sometimes I refresh my feed

1692
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:13,280
and I,
I can't find something that somebody 

1693
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:13,320
sent me because it's just too much.
But um,

1694
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:18,540
but the sauna,
it's a fascinating thing to me that 

1695
01:20:18,540 --> 01:20:18,960
because there's infrared Saunas as well 
now.

1696
01:20:19,140 --> 01:20:21,070
What's the benefit of that?
Yeah.

1697
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:26,160
So I haven't done a ton of research on 
like the differences between just a 

1698
01:20:26,160 --> 01:20:27,030
normal dry sauna,
which most of the studies that I read,

1699
01:20:27,240 --> 01:20:30,150
they're using normal dry dry sauna is 
awesome.

1700
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:31,250
Yeah.
Dry Sauna.

1701
01:20:31,251 --> 01:20:33,620
I'm just just elevating your core body 
temperature basically.

1702
01:20:33,630 --> 01:20:34,740
I think,
you know,

1703
01:20:34,741 --> 01:20:39,741
the infrared is somehow can heat you up 
without some of the damaging effects of 

1704
01:20:39,741 --> 01:20:41,550
the heat or something.
I'm not exactly sure.

1705
01:20:41,551 --> 01:20:43,620
I'll just say that I haven't done a lot 
of research on that,

1706
01:20:43,621 --> 01:20:45,540
but um,
my,

1707
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:48,300
you can get infrared saunas and just 
like put them in your garage.

1708
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:53,301
My inlaws have one in their garage.
We have one that my wife loves and she 

1709
01:20:53,301 --> 01:20:53,940
climbs into it.

1710
01:20:53,940 --> 01:20:56,040
It's like a bag.
It's like a.

1711
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:58,600
it's one of those bags.
I've seen those.

1712
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,600
She looks so stupid there with her.
She's got her ipad and she's watching 

1713
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:07,680
breaking bad and she's in this fucking 
sleeping bag.

1714
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:10,170
It's so ridiculous.
I'm not sure if that's.

1715
01:21:10,171 --> 01:21:15,171
I think to get some of the benefits.
You have to kind of push it a little 

1716
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:15,171
bit.
I'm not sure if you're gonna.

1717
01:21:15,171 --> 01:21:15,860
She's pushing.
She okay.

1718
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,970
She gets out of there.
It's like she swam in the ocean.

1719
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:18,940
She said,
oh,

1720
01:21:18,950 --> 01:21:20,610
okay.
I've seen those on Amazon,

1721
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:25,611
but I was always curious if that's a 
different one than the image shows a 

1722
01:21:25,611 --> 01:21:25,710
different one.
The one that she has,

1723
01:21:25,711 --> 01:21:27,480
she.
She actually lives down in it.

1724
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:29,780
It's so silly looking,
which is.

1725
01:21:29,781 --> 01:21:33,300
I thought it was horseshit and food.
It has benefits on the brain.

1726
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,150
Think about when you exercise,
you know?

1727
01:21:36,151 --> 01:21:41,151
Yeah.
It's like you're elevating your core 

1728
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:41,151
body temperature,
which is.

1729
01:21:41,151 --> 01:21:42,310
That's exactly what she has.
She clemson that goofy fucking thing and

1730
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:45,540
not expose their head is out.
Yeah.

1731
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:46,920
She,
she needs to get her head in there.

1732
01:21:46,921 --> 01:21:51,921
Right.
I'm going to tell her fucking bag over 

1733
01:21:51,921 --> 01:21:51,921
your head lady.

1734
01:21:53,880 --> 01:21:58,880
Well,
I mean it sounds like there's a great 

1735
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,040
benefit to having one of those things.
Your House if you have room.

1736
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:00,000
Yeah,
totally.

1737
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:01,210
You know,
if you've got a garage,

1738
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,030
I,
they don't take up a lot of space.

1739
01:22:03,180 --> 01:22:05,340
I did not know.
That's incredible.

1740
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:10,640
I'm so glad I talked to you.
I mean I just went last week to get a 

1741
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:11,280
massage and just looked at that stupid 
thing.

1742
01:22:11,281 --> 01:22:11,930
I was like,
Ugh,

1743
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:17,270
but hot box wish my gym had one.
Like my gym now doesn't have one and I 

1744
01:22:17,270 --> 01:22:19,560
miss it so much.
Wow.

1745
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:22,740
So how does it stimulate human growth 
hormone?

1746
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:24,930
What does it do?
Know how it does.

1747
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,310
Um,
but they've measured it,

1748
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:31,610
you know,
they've measured growth hormone after 

1749
01:22:31,610 --> 01:22:33,261
people have been in the sauna.
And is it a temporary benefit of the 

1750
01:22:33,261 --> 01:22:34,170
hours after?
It's just like if you were to,

1751
01:22:34,280 --> 01:22:36,450
you know,
Jackson growth hormone,

1752
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,930
I don't think it lasts more than a 
couple of hours either.

1753
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,570
Wow.
That is unbelievably fascinating.

1754
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,760
It is fascinating.
But there's an interesting,

1755
01:22:44,761 --> 01:22:46,150
and I,
I did write a post on this,

1756
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:50,610
this tradeoff on growth hormone and igf 
one a tradeoff and that is,

1757
01:22:50,611 --> 01:22:53,000
you know,
growth hormone and igf one are,

1758
01:22:53,020 --> 01:22:58,020
you know,
they're considered really good anabolic 

1759
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:58,020
there,
help you bulk on muscle.

1760
01:22:58,120 --> 01:22:59,670
They're also good.
It's good for your brain,

1761
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:04,690
you know,
it helps with neurogenesis in your 

1762
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:04,690
brain,
but there's a tradeoff.

1763
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:06,160
They've shown that reducing igf

1764
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,160
one signaling in lower organisms like 
worms and flies and also in mice extends

1765
01:23:11,651 --> 01:23:14,470
their lifespan.
So if you take a mouse and you knock out

1766
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:19,000
growth hormone receptor,
it can live 50 percent longer.

1767
01:23:19,150 --> 01:23:22,960
Why 50 percent longer,
like huge increase in lifespan.

1768
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:28,020
That doesn't seem to make any sense 
because you would think that growth 

1769
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:28,020
hormone would be repairing the muscle 
tissue,

1770
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,860
would you would.
Um,

1771
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,790
and,
and so when people actually in people,

1772
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:38,791
people that have polymorphisms in the 
igf one receptor that it's associated 

1773
01:23:39,401 --> 01:23:40,630
with,
like centenarians,

1774
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:43,730
like living to be 92 in 100.
Yeah.

1775
01:23:43,731 --> 01:23:45,040
So,
and that's,

1776
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,430
that's mostly mediated through.
I'm not getting cancer.

1777
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,830
But,
uh,

1778
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:51,460
there,
there,

1779
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:53,290
there is an interesting trade off and I 
think that,

1780
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,690
uh,
in,

1781
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:58,730
in lower organisms,
the reason is that having that reduced a

1782
01:23:58,820 --> 01:24:01,220
insulin signaling helps them deal with 
stress like their,

1783
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:05,800
they have an increase in gene expression
for various different genes that are,

1784
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:08,470
you know,
antioxidant genes like jeans,

1785
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:10,780
like glutathione reductase and things 
like that.

1786
01:24:11,030 --> 01:24:16,030
Um,
and also in genes that help them take 

1787
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:17,140
care of proteins and increasing 
neurotrophic factors.

1788
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:22,390
I'm not sure if the same benefits are 
true in humans and humans.

1789
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:23,380
Mostly.
I think it's a,

1790
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,980
they're not getting cancer because 
because of having lower igf one,

1791
01:24:27,450 --> 01:24:32,450
well,
here's the answer about a amino acids 

1792
01:24:32,450 --> 01:24:33,860
and a growth hormone.
Apparently there was a,

1793
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:36,050
there's a pub med study on it.
Um,

1794
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:41,270
and they,
they're saying that a specific amino 

1795
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:42,080
acids such as Arginine,
lysine and aura,

1796
01:24:42,090 --> 01:24:47,090
thien orthodox orphanage can stimulate 
growth hormone release when infused 

1797
01:24:47,191 --> 01:24:52,191
intravenously or administered orally.
A many individuals consume amino acids 

1798
01:24:52,191 --> 01:24:56,070
before strength training workouts,
believing that this practice accentuates

1799
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,410
the exercise induced growth hormone 
release,

1800
01:24:58,411 --> 01:25:01,290
thereby promoting greater gains in 
muscle mass and strength.

1801
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:06,240
That growth growth hormone response to 
amino acid administration is a.

1802
01:25:06,270 --> 01:25:11,270
has a high degree of inter individual 
variability into it.

1803
01:25:13,410 --> 01:25:15,360
That's the first time I ever read that.
I'm 46.

1804
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:17,100
I've never read that.
Read that word.

1805
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,800
Inter individual.
That's a great word though.

1806
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:24,880
Into it individually for individual 
variability and may be altered by 

1807
01:25:25,051 --> 01:25:26,220
training status,
age,

1808
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:31,221
sex and diet.
Although a parental administration 

1809
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:34,800
consistently leads to.
No,

1810
01:25:34,801 --> 01:25:37,110
not parental parent.
Turell.

1811
01:25:37,170 --> 01:25:38,730
Parenteral.
Parenteral.

1812
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:43,200
What does that word?
P A r e n t e r a l what does that word?

1813
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:47,220
Parenteral administration considering

1814
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:49,700
tineal.
Is it?

1815
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:51,150
Is it parents?
Lineal.

1816
01:25:52,010 --> 01:25:53,070
Okay.
A R

1817
01:25:53,070 --> 01:25:57,750
e n t e r a l any?
Oh No,

1818
01:25:57,751 --> 01:26:01,140
it's not per ren tr.
Oh,

1819
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:05,900
let's Google that motherfucker.
Lists Is this golden age of information.

1820
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,850
Okay.
Let's look up in dictionary.

1821
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:12,880
Here we go.
It is administered by or occurring 

1822
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,901
elsewhere in the body than the mouth and
elementary canal.

1823
01:26:18,830 --> 01:26:21,020
What's the elementary corral?
God dammit.

1824
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:25,670
Fucking confusing shit.
Okay.

1825
01:26:25,671 --> 01:26:30,671
Anyway,
a Blahblahblahblahblah leads to 

1826
01:26:30,671 --> 01:26:33,251
increased circulating growth hormone,
a concentration oral doses that are 

1827
01:26:33,651 --> 01:26:38,651
great enough to induce significant 
growth hormone release are likely to 

1828
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:42,491
cause stomach discomfort.
And diarrhea booms on during exercise 

1829
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:45,680
intensity is also a major determinant of
growth hormone release.

1830
01:26:45,950 --> 01:26:49,760
Although one study showed that arginine 
infusion can heighten the growth hormone

1831
01:26:49,761 --> 01:26:54,761
response to exercise,
no studies found that pre exercise oral 

1832
01:26:54,761 --> 01:26:58,460
amino acid supplementation augments 
growth hormone release further,

1833
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,400
no appropriately appropriately 
conducted.

1834
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:06,401
Scientific Studies found that oral 
supplementation with amino acids which 

1835
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:10,661
are capable of inducing growth hormone 
release before strength training 

1836
01:27:10,661 --> 01:27:14,231
increases muscle mass and strength to a 
greater extent than the strength 

1837
01:27:14,231 --> 01:27:14,231
training alone.

1838
01:27:14,540 --> 01:27:16,160
Hmm.
That's interesting.

1839
01:27:16,580 --> 01:27:18,950
How that doesn't.
That seems to be contradictory,

1840
01:27:18,951 --> 01:27:19,830
doesn't it?
A little bit.

1841
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:21,360
Yeah.
I.

1842
01:27:21,430 --> 01:27:26,430
I'd have to take a look at the study.
If it says that the administration 

1843
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:29,351
consistently leads to increasing 
circulation of growth hormone 

1844
01:27:29,351 --> 01:27:33,401
concentration.
World doses that are great enough to 

1845
01:27:33,401 --> 01:27:37,451
induce significant growth hormone 
release are likely to cause stomach 

1846
01:27:37,451 --> 01:27:39,350
discomfort and diarrhea.
So that means that if you do do that,

1847
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,620
you will get more growth hormone.
You will also get diarrhea,

1848
01:27:42,621 --> 01:27:45,300
but doesn't that mean it works?
Sounds like it means it works.

1849
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:50,301
If you're looking at growth hormone,
circulating growth hormone as an 

1850
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:50,301
endpoint.
Yeah.

1851
01:27:50,301 --> 01:27:51,390
So how would they know that's where it 
gets confusing,

1852
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:56,391
whether they know that it increases 
strength or muscle mass to a greater 

1853
01:27:56,391 --> 01:28:00,351
extent than the strength training alone,
because a lot of that is variable 

1854
01:28:00,351 --> 01:28:00,351
individually,
individually as well,

1855
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:05,500
like what have to do a baseline you have
to do with the person itself and do 

1856
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:05,500
their.

1857
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:08,490
Do their baseline and then what they 
would do without the amino acid and then

1858
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:13,491
do their what they do with it.
So you'd have to compare each person to 

1859
01:28:13,491 --> 01:28:13,491
their own self.
Yeah.

1860
01:28:13,491 --> 01:28:14,100
That's the only way to do it,
right?

1861
01:28:14,140 --> 01:28:19,140
Because I've had friends that can just.
I know I have a friend who just can't 

1862
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:21,390
fucking pack on muscle.
The guy will lift weights all the time.

1863
01:28:21,391 --> 01:28:23,850
He lifts heavy tries,
he can't gain weight.

1864
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:26,430
It gets a little stronger,
but he just can't pack on muscle.

1865
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:31,580
And then I have other friends that they 
just look at waits and it will just 

1866
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:31,580
grow.
It's crazy.

1867
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:36,081
It's like some people,
they just have that mesomorphic body 

1868
01:28:36,081 --> 01:28:38,601
structure and they start lifting weights
and their muscles just start expanding 

1869
01:28:38,601 --> 01:28:42,051
and growing and they just start getting 
bigger and other people that they have 

1870
01:28:42,051 --> 01:28:42,120
that ectomorphic thing going on and they
just can't,

1871
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:47,240
they can't pack it on.
So how would you weight those factors 

1872
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:50,010
mean you'd have to know exactly who 
you're doing.

1873
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:55,011
You didn't really have to judge it 
intensely by the individual alone.

1874
01:28:55,430 --> 01:29:00,430
Yeah,
I think that's the best way to do it is 

1875
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:00,480
comparing each person to them their 
baseline self.

1876
01:29:00,820 --> 01:29:02,120
Uh,
you

1877
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:03,840
know,
so that's crazy though.

1878
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:08,841
That growth hormones in mice allow them 
to live longer than the converse is 

1879
01:29:08,841 --> 01:29:08,841
true.
Also,

1880
01:29:08,841 --> 01:29:13,191
if you overexert,
if you make a transgenic mouse and 

1881
01:29:13,191 --> 01:29:13,650
overexpress the growth hormone,
like third expressing lots of it,

1882
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:17,220
they live 50 percent shorter.
Wow.

1883
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:18,270
So it's,
um,

1884
01:29:18,510 --> 01:29:20,070
it's a,
it's an interesting.

1885
01:29:20,130 --> 01:29:21,450
It's an interesting trade off,
you know,

1886
01:29:21,451 --> 01:29:26,451
because oftentimes growth hormones 
except associated with where you want 

1887
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:31,791
more of it because your growth hormone 
levels go down as you age and it causes 

1888
01:29:31,791 --> 01:29:33,630
muscle atrophy and you know,
your brain,

1889
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:36,350
you know,
brain atrophy and incense too.

1890
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,980
So,
um,

1891
01:29:38,730 --> 01:29:39,600
it's,
I,

1892
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:44,790
I think it,
it has to do with more of super 

1893
01:29:44,790 --> 01:29:48,560
physiological levels of growth hormone,
like people that are injecting growth 

1894
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,651
hormones,
like people that are bodies that are 

1895
01:29:51,651 --> 01:29:53,991
taking 10 units day that may be a trade 
off and they get those big bellies from 

1896
01:29:53,991 --> 01:29:53,991
it.
Yeah.

1897
01:29:53,991 --> 01:29:54,450
So,
you know,

1898
01:29:54,451 --> 01:29:55,770
like I said,
if you're,

1899
01:29:56,490 --> 01:29:57,350
if you're,
uh,

1900
01:29:58,110 --> 01:30:03,110
when you make growth hormone from your 
pituitary and then that stimulates igf 

1901
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:06,861
one to be tomato and liver,
that then inhibits the production of 

1902
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:06,861
more growth hormone,
him and that,

1903
01:30:06,861 --> 01:30:09,960
that feedback is there for a reason.
And so if you just keep injecting it,

1904
01:30:09,961 --> 01:30:12,060
you're sort of overcoming that feedback 
because,

1905
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:13,650
well,
your body,

1906
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:15,900
you're giving it growth hormone.
It's not making more.

1907
01:30:15,901 --> 01:30:17,400
Even though there's igf one there 
saying,

1908
01:30:17,401 --> 01:30:18,390
shut it off,
you're saying,

1909
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:19,140
no,
I want more.

1910
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:22,740
If there's ever been any studies on 
people like bodybuilders that are taking

1911
01:30:22,741 --> 01:30:26,160
massive amounts of growth hormone over 
long periods of time because,

1912
01:30:26,161 --> 01:30:27,390
um,
I read this thing,

1913
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,490
I'm Dorian.
Look at that guy.

1914
01:30:29,550 --> 01:30:31,390
Oh my God,
that's a.

1915
01:30:32,430 --> 01:30:34,140
Oh my God,
it's monster.

1916
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:36,150
Isn't that?
Um,

1917
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,580
what's his name?
The uh,

1918
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:39,090
Ronnie Coleman.
Ronnie Coleman.

1919
01:30:39,091 --> 01:30:44,091
Yeah.
He's a former Mr Olympia and I think he 

1920
01:30:44,091 --> 01:30:47,901
probably takes a truck load of 
pharmaceutical drugs every day in order 

1921
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,410
to achieve that physique,
but his stomach,

1922
01:30:50,030 --> 01:30:55,030
that's like apparently one of the things
that happens when you take massive 

1923
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:58,341
amounts of growth hormone is they 
literally bulge out like they're 

1924
01:30:58,341 --> 01:30:59,070
pregnant.
Wow.

1925
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:04,200
I would love to see someone study that 
to see what happens to those guys when 

1926
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,730
they do that over long for that to be a 
really interesting study.

1927
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:10,880
Well,
the bodybuilding industry or the 

1928
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,220
bodybuilding as a sport is so 
fascinating to me because essentially 

1929
01:31:13,220 --> 01:31:15,150
you're dealing with these chemical 
projects because that's what they are.

1930
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:17,310
They're chemical projects.
They're not humans.

1931
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:22,590
I mean,
when you look at a guy like Ronnie 

1932
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:22,620
Coleman,
you don't get that big.

1933
01:31:22,670 --> 01:31:25,500
A normal guy doesn't get that big.
I mean,

1934
01:31:25,501 --> 01:31:27,020
you can get big.
I,

1935
01:31:27,030 --> 01:31:30,540
I had a friend who was a total natural 
bodybuilder.

1936
01:31:30,541 --> 01:31:33,450
There's photos of him in his gut.
That's so crazy.

1937
01:31:34,170 --> 01:31:36,030
It's so bizarre.
And you know,

1938
01:31:36,031 --> 01:31:38,370
I used to think that that was just big 
stomach muscles.

1939
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:40,050
I used to think that he did a lot of 
ABS,

1940
01:31:40,051 --> 01:31:45,051
so stomach muscles are huge until I 
actually read that their organs grow 

1941
01:31:45,051 --> 01:31:48,780
because of all the hormones at their own
fucking grass.

1942
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:52,020
It looks pregnant.
Look at how pregnant he looks.

1943
01:31:53,100 --> 01:31:54,810
It's so strange.

1944
01:31:55,430 --> 01:31:56,120
Yeah.
Like I said,

1945
01:31:56,121 --> 01:31:58,400
I,
I know I can cause insulin resistance in

1946
01:31:58,401 --> 01:31:59,540
the liver.
Well,

1947
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,400
people get diabetes

1948
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:02,500
from it,
from over use of growth hormone.

1949
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:08,100
Now the,
the idea that there's a whole support 

1950
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:11,161
dedicated to shooting as many chemicals 
into your body and turn you into some 

1951
01:32:11,161 --> 01:32:11,610
freak of science.
That's a strange sport.

1952
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:12,520
Strange.

1953
01:32:12,860 --> 01:32:13,790
But you know,
there's,

1954
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:15,360
there's,
there's a bit of a tradeoff.

1955
01:32:15,410 --> 01:32:20,410
These people are bulking up and they're 
lifting lots of weight and know they're 

1956
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,520
at the trader,
at the expense of a,

1957
01:32:22,670 --> 01:32:24,440
you know,
a few years in their life.

1958
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:25,290
So I think

1959
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:26,310
they'll say,
fuck it.

1960
01:32:26,311 --> 01:32:28,890
I'd rather be huge.
It'll be huge.

1961
01:32:31,200 --> 01:32:33,730
What do you think about,
um,

1962
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:34,450
the,
the,

1963
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:36,210
the,
well that's not a bodybuilder.

1964
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:39,390
What do you think about the studies that
had been done on,

1965
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:40,770
um,
what is that?

1966
01:32:40,771 --> 01:32:41,380
Uh,
the,

1967
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,130
the thing that happens to cows?
God,

1968
01:32:44,131 --> 01:32:46,390
I'm trying to remember the,
the,

1969
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:51,420
the exact function.
There's something that happens to 

1970
01:32:51,420 --> 01:32:52,900
whippets and it happens to cows.
It's a,

1971
01:32:52,940 --> 01:32:56,100
uh,
an accidental aspect of,

1972
01:32:56,101 --> 01:33:01,101
uh,
of breeding that causes them to 

1973
01:33:01,101 --> 01:33:01,101
Myostatin inhibitors.
You did,

1974
01:33:01,101 --> 01:33:02,520
do you know about all that?
Oh,

1975
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:07,610
great.
I'm going to educate you on the 

1976
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:07,610
fantastic.
Something happens.

1977
01:33:07,610 --> 01:33:10,470
Pull up miles.
Staten Inhibitor dog.

1978
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
It's a whippet.
Apparently it occurs like quite 

1979
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,400
frequently amongst these dogs and they 
don't look real.

1980
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:20,550
They look like incredible hulk dogs and 
what it is.

1981
01:33:20,551 --> 01:33:21,460
Is there something?
Oh,

1982
01:33:21,470 --> 01:33:26,470
what does my Stenton do?
I'll tell you right now my own staten 

1983
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:30,300
inhibitor dogs it tour dog.
Look at that dog.

1984
01:33:30,910 --> 01:33:32,830
That's real.
Holy Crap.

1985
01:33:32,890 --> 01:33:33,850
Holy Crap.
Indeed.

1986
01:33:34,330 --> 01:33:37,420
Yeah.
I'm double muscled cattle.

1987
01:33:37,421 --> 01:33:42,421
It happens in cows all the time.
A mile stat misfortunes that actually 

1988
01:33:42,421 --> 01:33:44,140
occasionally takes place in human 
beings.

1989
01:33:44,141 --> 01:33:46,880
There was a boy in Germany that had,
uh,

1990
01:33:46,900 --> 01:33:48,180
an issue,
uh,

1991
01:33:48,181 --> 01:33:48,690
with,
uh,

1992
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:50,980
a milestone and inhibitors.
Like I'll pull that up.

1993
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,960
Boy in Germany,
boy,

1994
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,830
Germany and he,
that's a cow that has it.

1995
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,280
And um,
they've done it in mice.

1996
01:34:00,430 --> 01:34:05,430
And the fascinating thing about them,
I'm inducing this in mice is that the 

1997
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:07,720
mice lived longer.
They didn't just live longer.

1998
01:34:07,721 --> 01:34:10,960
They were fucking huge.
They were like super mice.

1999
01:34:11,110 --> 01:34:11,740
Yeah.
Look at this,

2000
01:34:11,741 --> 01:34:13,210
boy,
this is a baby.

2001
01:34:13,211 --> 01:34:15,610
Look at the fucking muscles on this kid.
Look at his legs.

2002
01:34:16,820 --> 01:34:18,750
Wow.
He looks like an athlete.

2003
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,690
You pulled up a mouse study.
What was that?

2004
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:21,680
Yeah,
look at the mice.

2005
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:26,740
Look at them ice.
It's a double muscle mass that lives 

2006
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:26,740
twice as long.

2007
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:27,960
That is fascinating.
Yeah.

2008
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:33,600
Yeah.
I'm definitely gonna have to look into 

2009
01:34:33,600 --> 01:34:35,281
that,
but I still don't know exactly what my 

2010
01:34:35,281 --> 01:34:35,281
dad does.

2011
01:34:35,281 --> 01:34:35,760
Um,
I'll pull up the thing about the mice.

2012
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:40,800
Yeah.
I'm pretty sure they live longer.

2013
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:45,060
This is hard to do while you're actually
trying to do a podcast at the same time.

2014
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:47,370
This is how we rock it here though.
We do it live

2015
01:34:47,390 --> 01:34:48,300
because usually,
uh,

2016
01:34:48,301 --> 01:34:50,460
you know,
being bulking up like that is associated

2017
01:34:50,461 --> 01:34:52,880
with living shorter life.
Yeah.

2018
01:34:52,930 --> 01:34:54,660
So that's fascinating.

2019
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:56,570
Yeah.
Um,

2020
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:01,130
I'm here as a Mario Staten.
Yeah.

2021
01:35:01,131 --> 01:35:01,930
There's,
um,

2022
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:07,060
apparently there's quite a few studies 
that have been done not just on the mice

2023
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:11,840
but also on dogs and cattle to try to 
figure this stuff out.

2024
01:35:13,340 --> 01:35:18,320
This is fascinating.
If you do a wikipedia,

2025
01:35:18,321 --> 01:35:19,120
just like what

2026
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,200
the Myostatin I'm okay.
Yeah,

2027
01:35:24,201 --> 01:35:26,130
I'll,
I'll just do it on wikipedia here.

2028
01:35:26,240 --> 01:35:26,780
Um,
okay.

2029
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,790
A abbreviated,
um,

2030
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,120
milestone and also known as growth 
growth.

2031
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:37,180
Differentiation factor eight of 
abbreviated GDF eight is a protein that 

2032
01:35:38,271 --> 01:35:40,820
in humans is encoded by the m,
s,

2033
01:35:41,090 --> 01:35:46,090
t e n gene.
Milestone is a secreted growth 

2034
01:35:46,090 --> 01:35:49,991
differentiation factor that is a member 
of the Tgf Beta protein family that 

2035
01:35:50,300 --> 01:35:55,300
inhibits muscle differentiation and 
growth in the process known as 

2036
01:35:55,300 --> 01:35:59,680
myogenesis.
Myostatin is produced primarily in 

2037
01:35:59,680 --> 01:36:03,851
skeletal muscle cells,
circulates in the blood and acts on 

2038
01:36:03,851 --> 01:36:07,630
muscle tissue by binding a cell bound 
receptor called the active in type two 

2039
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:12,491
receptor and animals lacking myostatin 
or animals treated with substances that 

2040
01:36:12,921 --> 01:36:17,921
block the activity of Myostatin have 
significantly larger muscles and this 

2041
01:36:18,891 --> 01:36:21,410
could be of economic benefit to the 
livestock industry.

2042
01:36:21,411 --> 01:36:26,411
However,
these animals require special care and 

2043
01:36:26,411 --> 01:36:29,021
feeding with ofs,
which offsets the potential economic 

2044
01:36:29,021 --> 01:36:29,021
advantage.
Look at that boy

2045
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,060
so it doesn't say anything about their 
lifespan.

2046
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,850
Look at that boy's body.
What the fuck is going on there?

2047
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:40,940
That boy is yoked.
I do not want to go to school with that 

2048
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:40,940
kid.
Can you imagine a bombed out?

2049
01:36:40,940 --> 01:36:42,870
You'd be if you were both 10 and you're 
like,

2050
01:36:42,871 --> 01:36:47,400
why is billy have a fucking 12 pack?
And I looked like a girl.

2051
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,380
It was ridiculous.
I mean,

2052
01:36:52,381 --> 01:36:53,340
what does that kid.
I mean,

2053
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:57,330
I wonder if they're going to allow him 
to like wrestle and do athletics.

2054
01:36:57,540 --> 01:37:01,320
That seems unfair.
Kids going to take other kids,

2055
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:06,380
just fucking hurl them across the room.
He's going to be the Hawk live fire.

2056
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,390
That is fascinating.
I'm going to,

2057
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:11,670
I'm going to have to dig into that 
because that's really interesting.

2058
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:13,740
I'd like to understand some of the 
mechanisms.

2059
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:18,810
Yeah.
So the gene encoded Myostatin was 

2060
01:37:18,810 --> 01:37:21,081
discovered in 1997 by geneticists doctor
say Jim Lee and Alexander Mcferrin who 

2061
01:37:22,531 --> 01:37:27,070
also produced a strain of mutant mice 
that lack the gene and there's,

2062
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:30,480
these mice have approximately twice as 
much muscle as normal mice.

2063
01:37:31,260 --> 01:37:31,950
Incredible.

2064
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:34,060
Yeah.

2065
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:38,270
But I don't know why it happens all the 
time and whippets that dog,

2066
01:37:38,271 --> 01:37:40,700
that one whip it,
but it does happen in humans.

2067
01:37:42,140 --> 01:37:43,640
Really,
really amazing stuff.

2068
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,620
Very interesting.
Yeah.

2069
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,480
But these,
these sort of things,

2070
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:48,570
um,
it,

2071
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:53,600
it,
it makes you wonder what is that the 

2072
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:53,600
mouse is body.
Would they killed it?

2073
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,260
They killed it just to show us its 
muscle,

2074
01:37:55,290 --> 01:37:57,800
but how can we kick off the skin?
Yeah.

2075
01:37:57,870 --> 01:38:01,170
How rude could have just taken a 
picture.

2076
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:06,100
You don't have to forget fucking crazy.
The,

2077
01:38:06,101 --> 01:38:07,950
uh,
the ones who,

2078
01:38:07,951 --> 01:38:10,410
uh,
the mile staten dogs,

2079
01:38:10,411 --> 01:38:15,411
apparently they sucked as runners,
but their appearance with significantly 

2080
01:38:15,541 --> 01:38:16,470
more muscular.
Yeah.

2081
01:38:16,471 --> 01:38:18,060
They still fucking,
you know,

2082
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:21,090
that's the thing about muscle and it's 
an issue that comes up and mixed martial

2083
01:38:21,091 --> 01:38:26,091
arts all the time and I talk about all 
the time in commentary is that you can't

2084
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:31,520
just pack on all that muscle and not 
have sort of A.

2085
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:33,210
There's a point of diminishing returns.

2086
01:38:33,450 --> 01:38:36,360
It's good to have some muscle,
but the more muscle you have,

2087
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:41,420
the more you have a muscle that's 
demanding fuel and you have the same 

2088
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:45,981
heart and the lungs.
It's pumping out two more tissue and it 

2089
01:38:45,981 --> 01:38:46,410
just.
It's just a matter of resources.

2090
01:38:46,740 --> 01:38:51,300
You have only a finite amount of oxygen 
that you can take in a single breath and

2091
01:38:51,301 --> 01:38:53,460
it's distributed through all this 
tissue,

2092
01:38:53,490 --> 01:38:58,490
all this extra muscle and it.
It really has a significant factor on 

2093
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:02,520
people's in endurance,
especially in athletics.

2094
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:08,110
We got that guy.
Is that a real human that's not photo 

2095
01:39:08,110 --> 01:39:10,110
shopped at all?
I don't know.

2096
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:14,040
It might not be mad what?
There might not be photoshop man.

2097
01:39:14,041 --> 01:39:16,500
What they can do today is just really,
really,

2098
01:39:16,501 --> 01:39:19,160
really bizarre.
I don't think they live longer.

2099
01:39:19,860 --> 01:39:22,470
They don't live long.
That's not a milestone guy.

2100
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:27,800
That's just a guy taking drugs.
I don't think that's a milestone and 

2101
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:27,800
guy.

2102
01:39:27,800 --> 01:39:31,190
Right.
I don't think there's ever been a human 

2103
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:31,190
that's lived.
I think it's a really recent thing.

2104
01:39:32,920 --> 01:39:37,920
I Dunno.
Just talking interesting to see what 

2105
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:37,920
their mitochondria are doing.
You know,

2106
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:39,900
your Mitochondria or when you're 
exercising,

2107
01:39:39,901 --> 01:39:44,901
when you're bulking up muscle,
you're inducing mitochondrial 

2108
01:39:44,901 --> 01:39:44,901
biogenesis.
That's not really,

2109
01:39:45,140 --> 01:39:46,940
definitely not real.
Not Real.

2110
01:39:47,180 --> 01:39:47,630
Um,
you.

2111
01:39:47,660 --> 01:39:52,660
There's been a couple cases where 
they've documented children have it in 

2112
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:56,790
2004 German boy who was diagnosed with a
mutation in both copies of the milestone

2113
01:39:56,791 --> 01:40:01,791
and producing gene,
making him considerably stronger than 

2114
01:40:01,791 --> 01:40:02,310
his peers.
His mother has a mutation in one copy of

2115
01:40:02,311 --> 01:40:07,311
the gene and in then in 2005 and 
American boy was diagnosed with 

2116
01:40:07,311 --> 01:40:09,990
clinically similar condition,
but with somewhat different cause.

2117
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,890
His body produces a normal level of 
functional milestone,

2118
01:40:12,900 --> 01:40:16,590
but because he is stronger and more 
muscular than most others his age,

2119
01:40:16,591 --> 01:40:21,330
the doctors believed that a defect in 
his milestone and receptors prevents his

2120
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:24,480
muscle cells from a responding normally 
to mild staten.

2121
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,960
And that is what I've heard,
that they are trying to develop a 

2122
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:34,161
milestone and inhibitor and that mile 
staten producing stat and regulating the

2123
01:40:34,801 --> 01:40:39,801
size of your muscle tissue.
If they could come up with a mile stat 

2124
01:40:39,801 --> 01:40:42,471
inhibitor,
it would increase the size of your 

2125
01:40:42,471 --> 01:40:43,650
muscles.
I don't know if that's a good thing.

2126
01:40:43,651 --> 01:40:48,651
I mean it doesn't seem like it as well.
It seems like it would help some people 

2127
01:40:48,651 --> 01:40:53,451
if they're,
if they have like wasting disease or 

2128
01:40:53,451 --> 01:40:56,091
something along those lines.
But it's going to be really interesting 

2129
01:40:56,091 --> 01:41:00,541
though that when they start coming up 
with like gene doping for that and they 

2130
01:41:00,541 --> 01:41:04,591
start giving it to wrestlers or football
players or things along those lines 

2131
01:41:04,591 --> 01:41:08,610
because it seems like anything that 
affects the body so significantly as you

2132
01:41:08,651 --> 01:41:11,470
see those mice or those,
those dogs,

2133
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:13,970
someone's going to take that shit.
There is some online.

2134
01:41:14,250 --> 01:41:19,250
Absolutely.
There's a guy with lining up right now 

2135
01:41:19,250 --> 01:41:22,020
with is we willie and his pants and he's
ready to just shoot that in there and 

2136
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:24,250
make up for everything and there's a 
trade off.

2137
01:41:24,251 --> 01:41:26,050
But you know,
he cares.

2138
01:41:27,400 --> 01:41:32,400
Well.
Do you follow genetic manipulation or 

2139
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:33,820
studies on genetic manipulation and the 
potential for what they're,

2140
01:41:33,821 --> 01:41:36,060
where they're figuring out these days 
because it,

2141
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:41,370
it seems incredible and it seems that 
the future is going to be so bizarre 

2142
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:45,510
when you deal with the idea that,
you know,

2143
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,060
the exponential increase in the uh,
ability to,

2144
01:41:48,180 --> 01:41:53,180
to change things and to alter the human 
body is just going to continue as long 

2145
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:57,370
as society allows this research to 
continue as long as society allows,

2146
01:41:57,640 --> 01:41:59,680
you know,
long as we don't blow ourselves up.

2147
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:03,310
This work is gonna continue to go on,
there's going to be more breakthroughs.

2148
01:42:03,311 --> 01:42:07,570
There's going to be more significant 
increases in the capacity for change and

2149
01:42:08,410 --> 01:42:11,410
know who knows what the fuck is going to
be like just a decade,

2150
01:42:11,411 --> 01:42:12,400
two decades from now.

2151
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:13,810
Yeah.
I'd like to see some,

2152
01:42:13,811 --> 01:42:18,811
um,
we've already made some major advances 

2153
01:42:18,811 --> 01:42:20,891
in the stem cell research,
which to me is one of the most 

2154
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:20,891
important,
you know,

2155
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:24,311
because if you can,
if we can get to the point where we can 

2156
01:42:24,311 --> 01:42:25,580
replace our damaged motor neurons or you
know,

2157
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:28,850
make sure we're not getting Parkinson's 
disease.

2158
01:42:28,851 --> 01:42:30,470
I mean,
I think that's a huge,

2159
01:42:30,910 --> 01:42:31,760
uh,
you know,

2160
01:42:32,430 --> 01:42:33,640
that's,
that's a huge thing in,

2161
01:42:33,641 --> 01:42:37,670
in helping us extend the quality of our 
life.

2162
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:39,260
Um,
you know,

2163
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:41,570
because you don't want an urge to 
interrupt disease.

2164
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:42,560
No,
that's,

2165
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:45,950
that's something that you don't,
I mean there's certain things you can do

2166
01:42:45,951 --> 01:42:48,770
and you're in your lifestyle to try to 
not get one.

2167
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:49,940
Uh,
but it'd be,

2168
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:53,270
it'd be pretty sweet to have some 
genetic breakthroughs in these stem cell

2169
01:42:54,170 --> 01:42:56,210
therapies and,
and we're making progress.

2170
01:42:56,211 --> 01:42:57,410
We just,
we're not there yet.

2171
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:04,240
I would like to see a study on someone 
who follows the exact protocol that 

2172
01:43:05,301 --> 01:43:10,301
science that someone like you would 
prescribe to him or her and that they do

2173
01:43:10,701 --> 01:43:13,800
it over a long period of time and they 
have a twin that doesn't.

2174
01:43:14,030 --> 01:43:15,230
Right.
You know,

2175
01:43:15,650 --> 01:43:20,650
they do.
And they do some of those studies where 

2176
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,451
they're looking at specific things like 
specific vitamins or exercise or things 

2177
01:43:22,451 --> 01:43:27,071
like that.
But a long term study where you're 

2178
01:43:27,071 --> 01:43:28,160
looking at multiple changes.
I would love to see that as well.

2179
01:43:28,320 --> 01:43:29,450
Yeah.
One person drinks,

2180
01:43:29,451 --> 01:43:33,230
one person doesn't one person's fault.
They did this study they did in monkeys,

2181
01:43:33,260 --> 01:43:38,260
you know,
and it was like a 27 year experiment I 

2182
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:38,260
think,
um,

2183
01:43:38,260 --> 01:43:43,240
where they,
so caloric restriction is known to 

2184
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:46,571
extend lifespan in lower organisms and 
also in this monkey monkeys they did,

2185
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,260
um,
where if you give a,

2186
01:43:49,610 --> 01:43:52,460
give a monkey 30 percent food than it 
would normally eat.

2187
01:43:52,461 --> 01:43:56,870
So you basically let the monkey decide 
what it would eat and then you say,

2188
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:57,410
okay,
I'm going to,

2189
01:43:57,650 --> 01:43:59,300
I'm going to give them 30 percent less 
of that,

2190
01:43:59,330 --> 01:44:00,230
you know,
every day.

2191
01:44:00,260 --> 01:44:02,180
And they did this for like 27 years.

2192
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:03,650
Um,
can you pull it?

2193
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:07,130
Can you do a google search on caloric 
restriction monkeys?

2194
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:10,260
And just like pull up the image that 
compares them a big impact.

2195
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:14,630
So it has a huge impact on the way they 
age these monkeys are.

2196
01:44:14,631 --> 01:44:18,200
They get age related diseases,
less cardiovascular disease.

2197
01:44:18,201 --> 01:44:23,201
Last cancer brain atrophy,
nurse of diseases less with a 

2198
01:44:23,201 --> 01:44:27,460
significantly smaller.
I'm the monkeys were not significantly 

2199
01:44:27,460 --> 01:44:29,060
smaller,
but they looked significantly better.

2200
01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:33,320
So it's cruises worked better.
Yeah.

2201
01:44:33,321 --> 01:44:34,430
Okay.
There's one picture,

2202
01:44:34,431 --> 01:44:39,431
I think there's one where they're like 
for Pam was on one of the writers obese 

2203
01:44:39,431 --> 01:44:40,340
though.
Okay.

2204
01:44:40,341 --> 01:44:45,341
Yeah,
there had picked up that one with the 

2205
01:44:45,341 --> 01:44:45,341
four panel.
Yeah,

2206
01:44:45,341 --> 01:44:45,341
that one.
So yeah,

2207
01:44:45,341 --> 01:44:49,811
these monkeys are actually the same age 
here and that monkey on the left a 

2208
01:44:49,811 --> 01:44:53,740
monkeys.
It's in its old age 27 and a half years 

2209
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:53,740
and it's had a normal day.

2210
01:44:53,740 --> 01:44:57,440
Like it's just eaten what its normal 
amount of food and that monkey on the 

2211
01:44:57,440 --> 01:45:01,211
right has been given 30 percent less 
food everyday for like it's 27 point 

2212
01:45:01,211 --> 01:45:01,460
five years.
I mean it's incredible.

2213
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:02,990
It's incredible.
Way Better.

2214
01:45:02,991 --> 01:45:05,750
I mean you can just tell by the way,
looks he's aging better,

2215
01:45:05,930 --> 01:45:08,720
but he also seemed body.
It's actually he looks more muscular.

2216
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,230
Yeah.
So it's.

2217
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,210
He looks like he's lost less muscle,
less much muscle atrophy.

2218
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:16,160
I mean,
so what they found,

2219
01:45:16,161 --> 01:45:20,000
they've done like these gene profiling 
expression arrays where they can measure

2220
01:45:20,001 --> 01:45:25,001
like thousands of different genes at 
once and they've seen that caloric 

2221
01:45:25,001 --> 01:45:27,140
restricting actually change the 
expression in like thousands of genes.

2222
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,560
So it helps like genes that are involved
in protein degradation,

2223
01:45:33,261 --> 01:45:38,261
protein synthesis,
like all these things are changed and 

2224
01:45:38,261 --> 01:45:38,480
these caloric restriction monkeys,
genes that are involved in like,

2225
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:40,700
you know,
growth factors in the brain,

2226
01:45:41,150 --> 01:45:44,240
those are upregulated at inflammatory 
genes are downregulated.

2227
01:45:44,240 --> 01:45:45,040
So it's like,
you know,

2228
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:48,590
27 years left less have constant 
inflammation going on.

2229
01:45:48,980 --> 01:45:52,700
And so there's,
it's very interesting how,

2230
01:45:52,701 --> 01:45:57,701
and there's a couple of theories as to 
why these monkeys age better or why 

2231
01:45:57,701 --> 01:45:57,701
calorie restriction,
you know,

2232
01:45:57,701 --> 01:45:59,930
is can,
can help the way you age.

2233
01:46:00,120 --> 01:46:01,940
Um,
and one of the big theories out there is

2234
01:46:01,941 --> 01:46:06,941
that this,
they're sort of like a hormetic 

2235
01:46:06,941 --> 01:46:08,441
response.
So hormesis is basically where you have 

2236
01:46:08,441 --> 01:46:08,990
like a low level of stress,
like a little bit of stress,

2237
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,580
and that stress then helps you,
uh,

2238
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:15,560
changes the expression of genes that are
involved in stress.

2239
01:46:15,561 --> 01:46:17,570
And so you basically can then deal with 
stress later.

2240
01:46:17,571 --> 01:46:22,571
So it's Kinda like conditioning your 
body to deal with stress by giving it a 

2241
01:46:22,571 --> 01:46:22,571
little bit of stress.
Um,

2242
01:46:22,571 --> 01:46:26,520
and this is kind of the same thing with 
a lot of like xenobiotics like plant,

2243
01:46:27,390 --> 01:46:29,000
polyphenols,
catechins,

2244
01:46:29,001 --> 01:46:30,050
these sorts of things.

2245
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:32,210
That's how they work.
They actually,

2246
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:37,900
they induced this hormetic response 
where they increase the expression of 

2247
01:46:37,900 --> 01:46:40,870
stress resistant genes that we have in 
our body that help us deal with protein 

2248
01:46:40,870 --> 01:46:41,510
stress with,
you know,

2249
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:43,160
reactive oxygen,
species,

2250
01:46:43,161 --> 01:46:44,870
stress with all this different types of 
stress.

2251
01:46:44,930 --> 01:46:49,930
And because we're increasing the 
expression of those genes were dealing 

2252
01:46:49,930 --> 01:46:51,210
with stress better every single know 
every single day in that,

2253
01:46:51,260 --> 01:46:52,170
in that case,
you know,

2254
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:54,240
for 27 years.
Um,

2255
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:56,890
and so it's very,
uh,

2256
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:02,120
this whole idea of hormesis is very 
interesting where you're sort of giving 

2257
01:47:02,120 --> 01:47:05,391
your body a little bit of stress,
like exercise is stress and it's a 

2258
01:47:05,391 --> 01:47:05,391
little bit of stress and it does the 
same thing.

2259
01:47:05,391 --> 01:47:09,440
But that whole field of epigenetics is 
just so fascinating how you know,

2260
01:47:09,450 --> 01:47:14,450
things that you eat,
what you do can actually change the 

2261
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:17,931
expression of genes.
And this actually affects the way you 

2262
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:17,931
age.

2263
01:47:17,931 --> 01:47:19,530
And really what's interesting,
not only does it affect the way you age,

2264
01:47:19,531 --> 01:47:22,920
it affects the way your children that 
you haven't had yet age,

2265
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:28,280
you know,
so are you familiar with what 

2266
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:28,280
epigenetics is?
Okay.

2267
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:28,680
So basically it's explaining it for 
people that might not be.

2268
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:33,710
So epigenetics is basically causing a 
change in your and your gene.

2269
01:47:34,980 --> 01:47:37,050
Are there factors that sit on top of 
your genes?

2270
01:47:37,051 --> 01:47:40,440
Basically to give you a very simplistic 
topical view,

2271
01:47:40,441 --> 01:47:44,730
they sit on top of your jeans and like 
methyl groups are acetylation groups and

2272
01:47:44,731 --> 01:47:47,040
they turn,
they activate your genes.

2273
01:47:47,041 --> 01:47:49,110
Then when they activate your genes,
they turn them on.

2274
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:51,450
And so the genes become what's called 
express.

2275
01:47:51,451 --> 01:47:53,970
They're expressing the genes when they 
are expressing the genes,

2276
01:47:54,210 --> 01:47:59,210
they're doing what they're supposed to 
do and other factors can sit on top of 

2277
01:47:59,210 --> 01:48:00,180
them and turn them off.
And even though the gene is still there,

2278
01:48:00,181 --> 01:48:03,330
it's like it's not there because it's,
it's not being expressed.

2279
01:48:03,880 --> 01:48:08,880
But these epigenetic factors don't 
actually alter the DNA nucleotide 

2280
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,080
sequence like a mutation would.
So that's the difference.

2281
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:12,630
And mutation changes the DNA nucleotide 
sequence,

2282
01:48:13,050 --> 01:48:15,480
epigenetic factor.
This thing can be modulated.

2283
01:48:15,660 --> 01:48:17,870
And it doesn't change the sequence,
it just,

2284
01:48:17,910 --> 01:48:21,120
it changes how much of that gene is 
being active or not active.

2285
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:24,270
And,
and these epigenetic marks are regulated

2286
01:48:24,271 --> 01:48:26,040
by what we eat,
by stress,

2287
01:48:26,041 --> 01:48:31,041
by exercise,
by all these various factors in our 

2288
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:31,041
environment.
Um,

2289
01:48:31,041 --> 01:48:35,750
and so that's,
that's one study where they've changed 

2290
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:35,750
in gene expression from calorie 
restriction.

2291
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:36,300
They've done.
Uh,

2292
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:39,300
and I heard someone on your podcast,
I talk about this study.

2293
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:44,570
I'm the sweetest Swedish study that was,
there's been a few of them that have 

2294
01:48:44,570 --> 01:48:45,240
been done,
um,

2295
01:48:45,490 --> 01:48:49,980
where in Sweden they keep like extensive
records of people's,

2296
01:48:50,250 --> 01:48:51,230
um,
you know,

2297
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:54,450
there,
there's records of what they eat,

2298
01:48:54,600 --> 01:48:56,130
what diseases they've had throughout 
their life,

2299
01:48:56,131 --> 01:48:57,990
when they were born and if they were 
depressed,

2300
01:48:57,991 --> 01:48:58,680
what they died of.

2301
01:48:58,680 --> 01:49:01,290
I mean,
they're very extensive records on people

2302
01:49:01,291 --> 01:49:04,170
and also they have extensive like 
agricultural records.

2303
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:06,180
So they can say like,
during this part of,

2304
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:11,480
you know,
the country at this time of the year 

2305
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:11,480
there was a lot of famine or there was a
lot of,

2306
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:13,020
you know,
there was a great crop harvest.

2307
01:49:13,370 --> 01:49:16,330
And so particularly this northern part 
of Sweden called nor buttons.

2308
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:18,570
Sweden,
back in,

2309
01:49:18,571 --> 01:49:21,450
I think it was like the 18 hundreds,
they looked back,

2310
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:26,640
uh,
during this period of time for whatever 

2311
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:26,640
reason,
it was hard to get in and out of there.

2312
01:49:26,640 --> 01:49:28,890
And so people really dependent on the 
crops that were there.

2313
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:31,680
So if there was good a lot of crops and 
it was good harvest,

2314
01:49:31,681 --> 01:49:34,110
people really gorge themselves,
the eight they overeat.

2315
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:36,840
And if people,
if the harvest was bad,

2316
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:38,640
um,
there was a famine and people really,

2317
01:49:38,641 --> 01:49:40,200
they sort of are calorie restricted.

2318
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:45,260
They,
they basically didn't get to eat as 

2319
01:49:45,260 --> 01:49:48,111
much.
And so a lot of these Swedish sciences 

2320
01:49:48,111 --> 01:49:48,550
have looked.
Scientists decided to look back and see,

2321
01:49:48,551 --> 01:49:51,130
well what effects did that have on 
future generations?

2322
01:49:51,131 --> 01:49:56,131
So it's Kinda like is there a 
transgenerational epigenetic effect on 

2323
01:49:56,321 --> 01:50:01,321
longevity?
So let's look at these people that grew 

2324
01:50:01,321 --> 01:50:04,501
up during the famine versus feast years 
and let's look at their children and 

2325
01:50:04,501 --> 01:50:04,960
their grandchildren,
see what diseases they had or what,

2326
01:50:04,990 --> 01:50:06,940
how long they lived.
And you know,

2327
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:10,240
it's not like incredibly,
it's not like a controlled study.

2328
01:50:10,241 --> 01:50:15,241
I mean,
it's very correlative and there's a lot 

2329
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:15,241
of factors missing,
but it's still very interesting.

2330
01:50:15,241 --> 01:50:15,850
Um,
what they found is that,

2331
01:50:16,240 --> 01:50:19,360
um,
males that were between the ages of nine

2332
01:50:19,361 --> 01:50:21,760
and 12,
and if they lived during the,

2333
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:24,280
if they were nine and 12 during the 
famine years,

2334
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:29,700
they had children and grandchildren that
lived on average about seven years 

2335
01:50:29,700 --> 01:50:32,800
longer than the grandchildren of those 
that grew up during the,

2336
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:37,180
the abundance years and when they 
corrected for socioeconomic status,

2337
01:50:37,181 --> 01:50:37,870
meaning,
okay,

2338
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:39,940
rich people kind of well,
no matter what,

2339
01:50:40,180 --> 01:50:45,180
when you correct for that,
when you have people from the same 

2340
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:45,180
socioeconomic status,
those,

2341
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:49,360
those are grandchildren of the men that 
were between the ages of nine to 12 

2342
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,050
during the famine,
years lived 32 years longer,

2343
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:54,190
which is like crazy,
a increase in lifespan.

2344
01:50:54,490 --> 01:50:59,490
And they also,
they had more studies coming out where 

2345
01:50:59,490 --> 01:51:01,231
those grandchildren had were one fourth 
less likely to get a type two diabetes 

2346
01:51:01,231 --> 01:51:03,430
and also cardiovascular diseases.
So I was like,

2347
01:51:03,431 --> 01:51:06,580
why?
Why do you have to be between the age of

2348
01:51:06,581 --> 01:51:09,370
nine and 12 and a male to,
you know,

2349
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:13,000
why growing up during that part of the 
famine,

2350
01:51:13,030 --> 01:51:16,450
how does that affect your,
your grandchildren's lifespan?

2351
01:51:17,080 --> 01:51:18,820
And we can't,
we can't really tell you why,

2352
01:51:18,821 --> 01:51:20,530
but there's some sort of theories as to 
why.

2353
01:51:20,531 --> 01:51:22,240
And uh,
during that time period,

2354
01:51:22,241 --> 01:51:23,020
there's something,
you know,

2355
01:51:23,021 --> 01:51:24,520
your pre pubescent,
right?

2356
01:51:24,521 --> 01:51:28,050
Right before you actually get,
get that growth spurt and uh,

2357
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:33,070
the,
they think there's something to do with 

2358
01:51:33,070 --> 01:51:33,070
the sperm DNA that gets changed.
A little bit of stress,

2359
01:51:33,070 --> 01:51:34,860
that little bit of Hormesis Po possibly.
Um,

2360
01:51:35,050 --> 01:51:38,460
a little bit of stress changes the 
expression in your genes,

2361
01:51:38,500 --> 01:51:40,900
sperm genes and that gets passed on.

2362
01:51:41,320 --> 01:51:46,320
So it's fascinating.
I'm so much to learn still about the 

2363
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:50,881
human body.
I feel like we're in a great time in 

2364
01:51:50,881 --> 01:51:54,901
comparison to other civilizations when 
you look back and what they used to do 

2365
01:51:55,151 --> 01:51:57,370
for medicine,
what we're aware of now,

2366
01:51:57,670 --> 01:52:00,610
but I feel like 100 years now they're 
going to be laughing at us,

2367
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:01,870
right?
Yeah.

2368
01:52:01,871 --> 01:52:02,830
No,
it's um,

2369
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:08,880
you know,
I think the future is preventative 

2370
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:08,880
medicine,
you know,

2371
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:11,820
and there's gonna be some breakthroughs 
eventually and things like stem cell 

2372
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:11,820
therapy,
but I think diet,

2373
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:13,900
nutrition and these things are what we 
can do now.

2374
01:52:13,930 --> 01:52:18,930
That's what we can do now we have 
control over and it absolutely has been 

2375
01:52:18,930 --> 01:52:21,490
shown to affect the way we age period.
And so we know this.

2376
01:52:21,790 --> 01:52:23,140
So let's,
let's implement it.

2377
01:52:23,141 --> 01:52:24,490
Let's educate people.
Let's do it,

2378
01:52:24,491 --> 01:52:29,491
you know,
as opposed to waiting around for some 

2379
01:52:29,491 --> 01:52:30,520
scientific breakthrough that may or may 
not happen in your child's,

2380
01:52:30,850 --> 01:52:32,830
you know,
during your child's lifetime.

2381
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:37,831
So there,
there's just no telling you know what's 

2382
01:52:37,831 --> 01:52:41,071
going to happen.
But we do know right now that we can 

2383
01:52:41,071 --> 01:52:41,071
control certain things,
you know,

2384
01:52:41,071 --> 01:52:43,240
and the way we age through,
through our diet and our lifestyle.

2385
01:52:43,241 --> 01:52:44,230
And,
and that's,

2386
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:46,010
that's what we need to start

2387
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:47,280
focusing on.
Um,

2388
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:50,240
I want to mention another really cool 
thing about this epigenetic.

2389
01:52:50,780 --> 01:52:52,190
Turn the microphone a little bit more 
towards you.

2390
01:52:52,191 --> 01:52:53,300
It'd be a little bit.
Sorry.

2391
01:52:53,410 --> 01:52:54,290
Yeah.
All right,

2392
01:52:54,291 --> 01:52:56,720
so this,
I'm back to the epigenetics.

2393
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:01,770
A study,
something even as complex like learning 

2394
01:53:01,770 --> 01:53:03,980
and memory can be modulated by,
by your environment.

2395
01:53:04,320 --> 01:53:09,320
And this was a mouse study where they 
took mice that were transgenically a 

2396
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:10,970
modulator to get neurodegenerative 
disease.

2397
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:16,570
And uh,
so they put these mice usually when we 

2398
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:17,660
work with mice,
they're in this cage has bedding,

2399
01:53:17,661 --> 01:53:19,800
it has some food and water and that's 
about it.

2400
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:22,430
There's not a lot of stimulation,
a lot of exercise.

2401
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,350
Um,
it's really kind of sad,

2402
01:53:24,351 --> 01:53:29,351
but they took these mice and they put 
them in what we call an enriched 

2403
01:53:29,351 --> 01:53:32,621
environment.
So they give them all these toys that 

2404
01:53:32,621 --> 01:53:32,621
stimulated various regions in their 
brain,

2405
01:53:32,621 --> 01:53:33,770
like the cognitive region,
motor region,

2406
01:53:33,950 --> 01:53:35,720
um,
Somata sensory regions.

2407
01:53:36,200 --> 01:53:41,200
And what they found was that these mice 
scored better on learning and memory 

2408
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:44,351
tests.
And not only did they score better on 

2409
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:44,351
learning memory tests,
they,

2410
01:53:44,351 --> 01:53:48,810
they had increased the expression of a 
gene that's involved in longterm 

2411
01:53:48,810 --> 01:53:51,610
potentiation.
Longterm potentiation is that signal 

2412
01:53:51,610 --> 01:53:52,730
that you're making when you're learning.
You need to remember things,

2413
01:53:52,731 --> 01:53:57,731
you know.
But the really interesting thing about 

2414
01:53:57,731 --> 01:53:59,951
this study was that these mice that were
genetically engineered to get 

2415
01:53:59,951 --> 01:54:03,491
neurodegenerative disease had offspring,
mice that were also genetically 

2416
01:54:03,491 --> 01:54:07,421
engineered to get an urgent or disease,
but we're not put in an enriched 

2417
01:54:07,421 --> 01:54:10,511
environment.
So they were putting that boring cage 

2418
01:54:10,511 --> 01:54:12,881
where they had no stimulation,
but they had still increased that 

2419
01:54:12,881 --> 01:54:15,680
longterm potentiation gene,
that epigenetic factor was passed on.

2420
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:18,290
Um,
in this case it was through the egg,

2421
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:21,050
through the female line to the offspring
mice,

2422
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:24,780
which had the same learning memory 
benefits even though they didn't really,

2423
01:54:24,781 --> 01:54:26,000
they weren't exposed to that 
environment.

2424
01:54:26,570 --> 01:54:27,290
So I mean,
just,

2425
01:54:27,291 --> 01:54:32,291
just having cognitive stimulation,
just using your brain more and 

2426
01:54:32,291 --> 01:54:34,070
exercising more can affect the 
expression of your genes.

2427
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:38,300
And that can actually get passed on.
It is so fascinating.

2428
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:44,510
One of the reasons why athletes tend to 
develop athletes for children is that 

2429
01:54:44,510 --> 01:54:48,041
one of the reasons we're really 
intelligent people tend to have 

2430
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:50,441
intelligent children,
like is possibly not just environmental 

2431
01:54:50,441 --> 01:54:51,410
and educational,
but epigenetics as well.

2432
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:56,440
Right.
I mean certainly in the environment 

2433
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:56,440
plays a component and those things.
But,

2434
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:57,260
you know,
the epigenetics,

2435
01:54:57,261 --> 01:55:02,261
we're just,
we're just sort of starting to 

2436
01:55:02,261 --> 01:55:02,261
understand epigenetics and how it works 
and it's complicated.

2437
01:55:02,330 --> 01:55:03,770
It's not easy to study,
but,

2438
01:55:03,800 --> 01:55:04,490
you know,
it's,

2439
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:07,460
yeah,
there's certainly a role for,

2440
01:55:07,461 --> 01:55:09,020
for epigentics and that.
So it's,

2441
01:55:09,770 --> 01:55:12,020
it's fascinating.
So fascinating.

2442
01:55:12,980 --> 01:55:17,980
It's very fascinating and it's so 
fascinating when you stop and think 

2443
01:55:17,980 --> 01:55:18,700
about how much we're going to learn,
you know,

2444
01:55:19,010 --> 01:55:21,110
what we know now and what we're going to
learn.

2445
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:24,590
It's incredible.
It's just incredible.

2446
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:29,180
You just think of the potential for 
reengineering the human body.

2447
01:55:29,690 --> 01:55:30,140
I mean,
that's,

2448
01:55:30,141 --> 01:55:32,840
it seems like we're going to be able to 
do all these things we're doing to mice,

2449
01:55:32,870 --> 01:55:36,050
given them double muscles,
making them fucking smarter,

2450
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:37,880
where we're going to be able to do that 
to people.

2451
01:55:38,240 --> 01:55:41,330
We're going to make a doctor Manhattan 
number from that movie,

2452
01:55:41,331 --> 01:55:43,260
the watchman.
We're going to make a document and going

2453
01:55:43,261 --> 01:55:43,740
to happen.

2454
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:48,270
There's going to be a guy one day that's
omnipresent super being that,

2455
01:55:48,271 --> 01:55:50,100
uh,
that becomes a God.

2456
01:55:50,580 --> 01:55:51,870
We're going to fuck up and make a god.

2457
01:55:53,340 --> 01:55:53,920
You know,
I'm,

2458
01:55:53,930 --> 01:55:58,930
I'm trying to,
I try to do what I can to make myself 

2459
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:00,120
work better and you know,
cognitive wise and you know,

2460
01:56:00,930 --> 01:56:05,670
and also tried to basically age better 
so you know,

2461
01:56:05,671 --> 01:56:06,890
it's,
it's certainly like we,

2462
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:08,850
we can do things like now.
Um,

2463
01:56:09,060 --> 01:56:10,320
but just yeah,
like you were saying,

2464
01:56:10,321 --> 01:56:12,990
genetically changing someone's like 
literally like,

2465
01:56:13,330 --> 01:56:14,670
you know,
making,

2466
01:56:14,880 --> 01:56:17,690
making someone's muscle grow like that 
by like giving them an inhibitor of this

2467
01:56:17,691 --> 01:56:21,900
certain milestone and receptor.
I mean that's like hardcore stuff that,

2468
01:56:22,740 --> 01:56:27,740
you know,
we don't really know what the effects 

2469
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:27,740
are going to be doing.
Things like that.

2470
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:29,820
Longterm comes down army of super 
beings.

2471
01:56:30,160 --> 01:56:32,050
That's what it's going to be.
There's Dr Manhattan,

2472
01:56:32,051 --> 01:56:37,051
that's what we're going to have.
That guy's going to be running shit 100 

2473
01:56:37,051 --> 01:56:37,051
years.
That's our new president,

2474
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:40,460
you know,
as long as he's really intelligent,

2475
01:56:40,461 --> 01:56:42,350
let's make his brain like super awesome.

2476
01:56:42,590 --> 01:56:45,200
Dr Manhattan was really intelligent,
unfortunately to intelligent,

2477
01:56:45,470 --> 01:56:48,290
so intelligent that he sorta like 
factored in a lot of things like,

2478
01:56:48,291 --> 01:56:48,800
well,
you know,

2479
01:56:48,801 --> 01:56:50,270
people live,
people die,

2480
01:56:50,440 --> 01:56:55,440
you no remorse and guilt and all these 
things are really just byproducts of 

2481
01:56:55,490 --> 01:56:58,870
human culture and our correlation to,
you know,

2482
01:56:58,950 --> 01:57:02,070
a cause and effect and our reactions to 
each other.

2483
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:04,940
They mean it.
It took away all the joy and fun.

2484
01:57:04,941 --> 01:57:07,310
The zest of life.
You've got a little bit too intelligent.

2485
01:57:08,210 --> 01:57:10,430
That problem's a problem.
Absolutely.

2486
01:57:10,431 --> 01:57:13,250
I would make people just smart enough,
but not too smart.

2487
01:57:13,251 --> 01:57:15,290
Whether they realize what's the fucking 
point.

2488
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,490
You live,
you die.

2489
01:57:16,491 --> 01:57:18,800
You're just a finite organism and even 
if you live forever,

2490
01:57:18,801 --> 01:57:21,080
the planet doesn't live forever.
So what do you.

2491
01:57:21,081 --> 01:57:23,730
What are you going to do here?
Yeah,

2492
01:57:24,030 --> 01:57:24,860
yeah.
I mean,

2493
01:57:24,861 --> 01:57:26,780
I've had conversations with really 
intelligent people.

2494
01:57:26,781 --> 01:57:28,550
They talk about the futility of life and
I'm like,

2495
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:33,880
you probably might be.
You're too fucking smart and you think 

2496
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:33,880
it too much,
or maybe not even too smart,

2497
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:38,501
but you're thinking too much about stuff
that really you can't control and maybe 

2498
01:57:38,501 --> 01:57:40,970
you got to be smart enough to realize 
that this is all silly.

2499
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:46,430
Yeah.
Thinking about the things you can't 

2500
01:57:46,430 --> 01:57:46,470
control sometimes that that overlap.
Like I get these,

2501
01:57:46,471 --> 01:57:48,060
what I call it,
OCD spikes where it.

2502
01:57:48,540 --> 01:57:53,540
If I'm driving on the highway,
I start to imagine all the possibilities

2503
01:57:53,911 --> 01:57:55,770
that can happen.
Like all the things that can happen with

2504
01:57:55,771 --> 01:58:00,771
all the cars and it liked those.
There's moments where it's so 

2505
01:58:00,771 --> 01:58:03,450
overwhelming where I just can't do.
I can't drive like it's too much.

2506
01:58:05,210 --> 01:58:10,210
It's like somebody's husband ends up 
driving me around a lot on the freeway 

2507
01:58:10,420 --> 01:58:12,190
drive.
True story and it's like,

2508
01:58:12,590 --> 01:58:16,290
so what I often do is I like to live 
five minutes from where I work.

2509
01:58:16,291 --> 01:58:21,291
That way I don't ever have to get on the
highway because I don't have to think 

2510
01:58:21,291 --> 01:58:21,291
about all the things that can happen.
When I'm on the highway.

2511
01:58:22,820 --> 01:58:25,260
It's,
wow,

2512
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:26,820
you're too smart to drive.
Well,

2513
01:58:26,821 --> 01:58:31,290
I don't know if it's that I sometimes 
obsess over what I can't control and the

2514
01:58:31,291 --> 01:58:33,330
fact that there's like all these people 
and I'm like,

2515
01:58:33,630 --> 01:58:38,630
they're doing all these things and all 
this could happen and all these 

2516
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:38,630
possibilities and you know,
then it's like,

2517
01:58:38,630 --> 01:58:38,850
okay,
it's like overload.

2518
01:58:39,090 --> 01:58:42,250
I had a moment when my

2519
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:46,980
first daughter was born,
where when I was in the hospital in the,

2520
01:58:47,110 --> 01:58:52,110
the moment she came out of the box,
I was thinking like how many different 

2521
01:58:52,271 --> 01:58:57,070
people are being born right now 
simultaneously all around the world.

2522
01:58:57,250 --> 01:59:00,100
And if you could see that on a giant 
screen,

2523
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:03,370
I mean it would look like an invasion of
babies.

2524
01:59:03,371 --> 01:59:08,371
If you could see the millions of people,
no doubt being born all over the world 

2525
01:59:08,371 --> 01:59:08,371
at the same moment,
just,

2526
01:59:08,700 --> 01:59:11,800
ah,
just shooting out of Vaginas,

2527
01:59:12,050 --> 01:59:12,400
Bang,
Bang,

2528
01:59:12,401 --> 01:59:12,680
Bang,
Bang,

2529
01:59:12,681 --> 01:59:12,970
Bang,
Bang,

2530
01:59:12,971 --> 01:59:13,260
Bang,
Bang,

2531
01:59:13,270 --> 01:59:13,540
Bang,
Bang,

2532
01:59:14,700 --> 01:59:15,320
Bang.
Just,

2533
01:59:15,560 --> 01:59:18,190
it would be so in the.
I got over it,

2534
01:59:18,280 --> 01:59:23,280
I got over it.
Glad we have that ability to get out 

2535
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:24,940
some of that stuff because yeah,
it's overwhelming.

2536
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:27,520
It's overwhelming,
it's very overwhelming.

2537
01:59:27,700 --> 01:59:30,480
It's sort of the issue with,
um,

2538
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:30,920
what,
what,

2539
01:59:30,921 --> 01:59:35,921
what one of the main issues with paying 
attention too much to bad things in the 

2540
01:59:36,911 --> 01:59:39,280
news,
and I've talked about this many times,

2541
01:59:39,281 --> 01:59:44,281
I think we have a real problem with 
digesting 7 billion people's worth of 

2542
01:59:44,281 --> 01:59:49,021
problems because anytime something 
spectacular or horrific comes up from 

2543
01:59:49,691 --> 01:59:54,691
all over the world,
we get it and we absorb it and it sort 

2544
01:59:54,691 --> 01:59:55,840
of alters our idea of what the world is.

2545
01:59:55,840 --> 02:00:00,840
Oh,
the world is a scary place and it's 

2546
02:00:00,840 --> 02:00:02,671
filled with evil.
The really the numbers are pretty 

2547
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:04,800
against that.
The numbers,

2548
02:00:04,810 --> 02:00:09,810
like throughout your day,
you experience very little violence 

2549
02:00:09,810 --> 02:00:13,830
throughout your day.
You experienced very little horrific 

2550
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:13,830
crime.
It's very,

2551
02:00:13,830 --> 02:00:17,251
very rare in most parts of America,
unless you live in a terrible 

2552
02:00:17,251 --> 02:00:21,451
neighborhood to experience the kind of 
shit that you see on your news feed or 

2553
02:00:21,451 --> 02:00:25,591
your twitter feed all day everyday.
It's not an accurate expression because 

2554
02:00:25,591 --> 02:00:28,690
it's based on such an insane number that
you're not supposed to be correlated.

2555
02:00:28,691 --> 02:00:31,450
You're not supposed to be looking at a 7
billion people number,

2556
02:00:31,600 --> 02:00:34,150
supposed to be looking at a tribe of 150
people.

2557
02:00:34,300 --> 02:00:39,300
I mean,
that's what our brain that's with the 

2558
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:39,300
Dunbar's number is,
that's,

2559
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:39,300
you know,
we don't,

2560
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:43,711
we don't really know what the fuck to do
with 7 billion people's worth of 

2561
02:00:43,711 --> 02:00:47,581
information.
So we become these paranoid messes when 

2562
02:00:47,581 --> 02:00:50,200
we start thinking about all this 
horrible shit that's happening.

2563
02:00:50,230 --> 02:00:53,110
But you're talking about a fucking 
planet worth.

2564
02:00:53,500 --> 02:00:56,890
I mean literally a planet worth of 
information now.

2565
02:00:57,080 --> 02:00:59,360
And it's like that's the same sort of 
thing.

2566
02:00:59,361 --> 02:01:04,361
This just freaking out.
Thinking about all the variables that 

2567
02:01:04,361 --> 02:01:04,361
you can control.
We were not designed for that.

2568
02:01:05,230 --> 02:01:10,230
Is it possible that we will,
that the epigenetics of living in this 

2569
02:01:10,301 --> 02:01:15,301
life will alter our genes and our 
expression of our genes so that we can 

2570
02:01:15,370 --> 02:01:20,370
accept this kind of information?
Is that something that we're gonna like 

2571
02:01:20,370 --> 02:01:20,370
will start to adapt?
Yeah,

2572
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,610
yeah,
absolutely.

2573
02:01:22,030 --> 02:01:27,030
I mean,
they've shown that stress does 

2574
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:27,030
epigenetically changed expression of our
genes.

2575
02:01:27,030 --> 02:01:30,480
So tabloids are fucking us up,
right?

2576
02:01:31,080 --> 02:01:32,650
You know,
I don't listen to tabloids,

2577
02:01:32,651 --> 02:01:33,340
but uh,
yeah,

2578
02:01:33,341 --> 02:01:36,030
I'm sure there are even just 
fearmongering,

2579
02:01:36,130 --> 02:01:38,830
you know,
just going on at the Alex Jones website,

2580
02:01:38,831 --> 02:01:41,990
just paying attention to all these 
people that are doom and gloom,

2581
02:01:41,991 --> 02:01:43,070
new world order.

2582
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:48,070
They're fucking chem trails.
They're putting caskets out in the fema 

2583
02:01:48,070 --> 02:01:50,450
camps and getting ready to mass kill 
people.

2584
02:01:50,650 --> 02:01:55,650
It is,
it's definitely changing the expression 

2585
02:01:55,650 --> 02:01:57,641
of your genes shed stress distress is 
doing something bad shit and it's also 

2586
02:01:57,641 --> 02:01:59,780
shortening your telomeres don't need 
that.

2587
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:02,450
But I got a problem too.
I fucking eat like a pig.

2588
02:02:02,780 --> 02:02:04,740
That's a real problem on a die young.
I,

2589
02:02:04,741 --> 02:02:06,680
I eat enough for like two or three 
people.

2590
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:09,050
Like what do you eat?
I eat everything.

2591
02:02:09,051 --> 02:02:10,910
I eat whatever's in front of whatever 
you want.

2592
02:02:11,020 --> 02:02:14,180
I've got a problem.
I work out a lot and because of that I'm

2593
02:02:14,181 --> 02:02:19,181
always hungry but I eat a lot.
I eat so much sometimes waitresses don't

2594
02:02:19,581 --> 02:02:21,160
believe me.
Like when we go,

2595
02:02:21,161 --> 02:02:23,930
like after shows,
like if we'll do like two or three shows

2596
02:02:23,931 --> 02:02:28,931
a night,
I'll order two entrees and then a bunch 

2597
02:02:28,931 --> 02:02:30,620
of appetizers and I've had people say 
that's too much.

2598
02:02:30,620 --> 02:02:31,550
Oh,
that's a wager soul.

2599
02:02:31,560 --> 02:02:34,070
Say That's too much.
Like just keep it coming.

2600
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:35,930
Don't worry about it.
I'm putting it down.

2601
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:37,610
Wow.
That's a lot of food.

2602
02:02:37,611 --> 02:02:40,610
Two entrees regularly.
Two entrees.

2603
02:02:40,640 --> 02:02:44,150
And that's after having two other meals 
usually.

2604
02:02:44,210 --> 02:02:46,760
Yeah.
But it's just if I'm working out,

2605
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,310
if I'm working out in our work at the 
same time,

2606
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:52,550
two things happened in the day,
my appetite is just insane.

2607
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,980
It just,
it's a pit that just can't be filled.

2608
02:02:55,510 --> 02:02:57,650
Well,
I mean your body needs the uh,

2609
02:02:58,010 --> 02:03:03,010
I'm gonna die younger.
I'm not going to be like the cool older 

2610
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:06,671
mouse,
cool older monkey that's got his shit 

2611
02:03:06,671 --> 02:03:06,760
together.
Fuck it.

2612
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:11,830
Take it down a notch that they're trying
to do some of these caloric restriction 

2613
02:03:11,830 --> 02:03:12,600
studies in humans to see,
you know,

2614
02:03:12,601 --> 02:03:15,380
what if it's the same,
if it's the same and you know,

2615
02:03:15,381 --> 02:03:18,320
of course doing the longevity studies 
going to take forever.

2616
02:03:18,320 --> 02:03:23,320
So that's hard.
So they're doing kind of like a year 

2617
02:03:23,320 --> 02:03:26,351
long study and looking at specific end 
points and they're finding some things 

2618
02:03:26,351 --> 02:03:27,350
are a little different actually from,
from,

2619
02:03:27,560 --> 02:03:32,560
from the mice and monkeys.
All I'm sure there's gotta be a 

2620
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,030
difference between monkeys and human 
beings are pretty profound difference as

2621
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:39,410
far as what our needs are nutritionally.
And also the,

2622
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:40,090
the,
the,

2623
02:03:40,091 --> 02:03:40,770
the,
uh,

2624
02:03:40,771 --> 02:03:45,771
the idea of stress because we can sort 
of conceptualize stress in a way that 

2625
02:03:45,771 --> 02:03:47,750
they can mean they're dealing with the 
immediate threats only.

2626
02:03:48,290 --> 02:03:49,670
They're not conceptualizing,
man,

2627
02:03:49,671 --> 02:03:50,660
I'm not going to live forever.
Man.

2628
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:53,030
Asteroid hits me,
man.

2629
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:55,060
That's not.
It's not there.

2630
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:56,490
I don't want to die of cancer.
Hurt.

2631
02:03:56,510 --> 02:03:58,700
Oh Man,
what if my wife's cheating on me?

2632
02:03:58,940 --> 02:04:03,940
He didn't.
They're not thinking about any of these 

2633
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:03,940
things.
What if I get fired?

2634
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:03,940
They're not thinking about any of these 
things.

2635
02:04:03,940 --> 02:04:05,750
They don't have anything other than 
immediate concerns,

2636
02:04:05,900 --> 02:04:08,450
which is kind of what we're designed 
for.

2637
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:09,530
Right?
I mean,

2638
02:04:09,590 --> 02:04:14,120
when you look at the genes of human 
beings and the amount of time that we've

2639
02:04:14,121 --> 02:04:19,121
been in this particular type of a 
society and the amount of time that 

2640
02:04:19,121 --> 02:04:20,460
we've been essentially hunter gatherers 
and it's,

2641
02:04:20,710 --> 02:04:25,710
there's no comparison.
We have a long stretch of time where we 

2642
02:04:25,710 --> 02:04:30,161
were just living a very specific way and
then over the last couple of hundred 

2643
02:04:30,161 --> 02:04:34,331
years things radically shifted.
It's very strange and new direction and 

2644
02:04:34,331 --> 02:04:36,920
then we find ourselves where we are now 
from the invention of the printing press

2645
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:38,280
to the fucking twitter feed.

2646
02:04:39,590 --> 02:04:41,450
Oh,
three printers freaked me out,

2647
02:04:41,451 --> 02:04:46,451
man.
People are just going to start making 

2648
02:04:46,451 --> 02:04:46,451
guns.
They're actually.

2649
02:04:46,451 --> 02:04:48,650
Nasa was funding a study.
I'm trying to three d print,

2650
02:04:48,710 --> 02:04:53,710
non living biomolecules like wood chips 
and like dental enamel and I know it's 

2651
02:04:55,251 --> 02:04:56,990
kind of cool.
Very cool.

2652
02:04:57,050 --> 02:04:58,210
Yeah.
So,

2653
02:04:58,270 --> 02:05:01,130
so that's,
that's Kinda Nasa is funding some really

2654
02:05:01,131 --> 02:05:04,250
cool stuff and other really cool study I
saw recently where they took,

2655
02:05:04,700 --> 02:05:09,680
they took cancer cells and they cultured
them in space because they wanted to see

2656
02:05:09,920 --> 02:05:14,920
if space could epigenetically change the
expression of genes and if this would 

2657
02:05:14,920 --> 02:05:15,410
have any effect.
And they found it,

2658
02:05:15,411 --> 02:05:20,411
did that gravity,
did it affect actually genes that are 

2659
02:05:20,411 --> 02:05:20,900
involved in metastasis and when you kill
culture,

2660
02:05:20,901 --> 02:05:25,901
these cells in space,
it downregulates genes involved in 

2661
02:05:25,901 --> 02:05:26,150
metastasis and those cancer cells become
less aggressive.

2662
02:05:26,720 --> 02:05:28,370
So then they took these cells and like,
okay,

2663
02:05:28,371 --> 02:05:31,040
well there's a million different things 
that could be happening in space.

2664
02:05:31,040 --> 02:05:33,740
Is it the gravity or is it like cosmo 
raise or something?

2665
02:05:34,070 --> 02:05:36,410
And so they like culture them in the 
centrifuge,

2666
02:05:36,411 --> 02:05:41,411
them meaning they spin and they spun on 
a certain rotation per minute to like 

2667
02:05:41,411 --> 02:05:43,200
copy or mimic this microgravity.
And they had,

2668
02:05:43,310 --> 02:05:47,150
they found the same effect.
So literally like the gravity change,

2669
02:05:47,151 --> 02:05:49,640
the expression of these genes involved 
in metastasis.

2670
02:05:50,090 --> 02:05:51,230
Uh,
so yeah,

2671
02:05:51,650 --> 02:05:56,650
so if you have cancer or maybe go to 
squarespace or the very top of a 

2672
02:05:58,371 --> 02:06:03,371
mountain,
I'm just wondering where they're going 

2673
02:06:03,371 --> 02:06:03,371
to go with that next.
I mean,

2674
02:06:03,371 --> 02:06:03,371
it's like,
okay,

2675
02:06:03,371 --> 02:06:04,670
well that's interesting finding,
but so what do we do?

2676
02:06:04,680 --> 02:06:07,220
Are we going to rotate for,
you know,

2677
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:09,600
if you have cancer,
it's,

2678
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:10,550
it's,
it's just,

2679
02:06:10,551 --> 02:06:11,420
uh,
some interesting.

2680
02:06:11,730 --> 02:06:16,730
Well then there's also the issue where 
you can't really go to space for very 

2681
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:17,620
long anyway because if you do go to 
space,

2682
02:06:17,621 --> 02:06:22,621
your body doesn't really.
The body's really not designed to be in 

2683
02:06:22,621 --> 02:06:23,900
a zero gravity environment.
We had a Dr Chris,

2684
02:06:23,901 --> 02:06:26,440
our commander Chris Hadfield on the 
podcast,

2685
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:28,680
one of the guys.
How long did he go to space for?

2686
02:06:28,681 --> 02:06:30,700
One hundred 60,
six days or something crazy like that,

2687
02:06:31,150 --> 02:06:36,150
and he came back and he was describing 
the horrific moments where he first 

2688
02:06:36,700 --> 02:06:38,080
stepped out of the,
the,

2689
02:06:38,160 --> 02:06:43,160
the,
the pot or whatever it is that you 

2690
02:06:43,160 --> 02:06:45,400
landon and was walking on the ground for
the first time getting nauseous and 

2691
02:06:45,641 --> 02:06:50,641
throwing up and your body's just so not 
used to being in gravity and standing on

2692
02:06:51,161 --> 02:06:56,161
the ground.
You just been floating around for so 

2693
02:06:56,161 --> 02:06:58,780
long that your body's just totally 
baffled and he said it was horrific.

2694
02:06:58,781 --> 02:07:03,781
I,
I thought it had been a wonderful 

2695
02:07:03,781 --> 02:07:05,761
experience.
Like what was it like when you finally 

2696
02:07:05,761 --> 02:07:05,761
touched them?
The ground you'd been up in space for so

2697
02:07:05,761 --> 02:07:05,761
long.
He's like,

2698
02:07:05,761 --> 02:07:08,170
it is unbelievably awful.
Wow.

2699
02:07:08,230 --> 02:07:08,680
Yeah.
Your,

2700
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:10,840
your,
your body's just in chaos.

2701
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:13,090
It doesn't know what you've been doing 
this whole time.

2702
02:07:14,220 --> 02:07:15,660
Yeah,
it's pretty crazy.

2703
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:18,560
The body's crazy.
It is very crazy and it's very.

2704
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:20,490
It does adapt.
I mean there's things that are.

2705
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,630
No,
it does adapt.

2706
02:07:22,670 --> 02:07:25,900
It's so endlessly fascinating.
It's so endlessly fascinating.

2707
02:07:25,901 --> 02:07:28,630
When you find out what has been learned 
about the body,

2708
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:30,520
how many studies have been done,
what,

2709
02:07:30,540 --> 02:07:34,600
what information is out there and then 
yet how much we need to learn,

2710
02:07:34,810 --> 02:07:37,390
how there is to know how much there is 
to discover.

2711
02:07:37,391 --> 02:07:39,970
It's just we're not even close.
Not even close.

2712
02:07:39,971 --> 02:07:42,490
We're just learning,
which is again,

2713
02:07:42,491 --> 02:07:44,530
why it's so infuriating when you read,
you know,

2714
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:46,180
vitamins don't work.
Case closed.

2715
02:07:46,540 --> 02:07:47,830
Fuck you.
No,

2716
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:49,480
it's not.
It's not that simple.

2717
02:07:49,630 --> 02:07:54,630
A lot of vitamins do work and there's 
been a lot of studies showing that they 

2718
02:07:54,630 --> 02:07:55,120
work well.
It's not an accident that we've isolated

2719
02:07:55,121 --> 02:08:00,121
vitamin C,
it's not an accident that we know that 

2720
02:08:00,121 --> 02:08:00,121
vitamin B 12 gives you energy.
I mean these are.

2721
02:08:00,121 --> 02:08:03,010
This is science that created all this,
so all these no nonsense people.

2722
02:08:03,250 --> 02:08:05,710
There is a lot of fuckery when it comes 
to vitamins.

2723
02:08:05,711 --> 02:08:07,540
There's a lot of fuckery when it comes 
to nutrition,

2724
02:08:07,541 --> 02:08:07,930
you,
you,

2725
02:08:07,931 --> 02:08:09,740
you're always reading about some,
you know,

2726
02:08:10,040 --> 02:08:14,320
false claims that you know,
this company has or that company has,

2727
02:08:14,321 --> 02:08:16,140
are these pills.
However though you're,

2728
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:18,430
you,
we hear about things all the time and it

2729
02:08:18,431 --> 02:08:22,330
comes to nutrition and supplementation,
especially when it comes to athletics,

2730
02:08:22,331 --> 02:08:26,050
supplementation,
things that are purported to deliver,

2731
02:08:26,070 --> 02:08:28,350
you know,
amazing muscle growth or you know,

2732
02:08:28,420 --> 02:08:31,990
they've found that a lot of those things
that are purported to give muscle growth

2733
02:08:31,991 --> 02:08:35,230
or erection pills.
Here's a perfect example.

2734
02:08:35,231 --> 02:08:39,400
You know what those things are.
When there's a cialis and Viagra,

2735
02:08:39,580 --> 02:08:42,550
they just sell that.
They sell it as some herbal supplement,

2736
02:08:42,551 --> 02:08:45,160
but they put in pharmaceutical drugs.
They get,

2737
02:08:45,190 --> 02:08:48,670
they buy that shit in bulk and they sell
it and it actually does work,

2738
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:53,880
but their pharmaceutical drugs,
but because of the fact that the 

2739
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:58,230
restrictions are so small and the band 
or the punishment of doing that is so 

2740
02:08:58,361 --> 02:09:01,660
small.
We had a aubrey marcus in from on it who

2741
02:09:01,661 --> 02:09:06,661
was describing the whole process of one.
One of these companies gets caught 

2742
02:09:06,661 --> 02:09:09,070
selling Viagra as one of these herbal 
sexual stimulants.

2743
02:09:09,490 --> 02:09:11,350
They just get a,
like a little fine.

2744
02:09:11,500 --> 02:09:16,500
So they changed the name,
they open up and under a different 

2745
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,751
company and go right back at it and they
just have the rocket dick or whatever 

2746
02:09:18,751 --> 02:09:19,330
the fuck they call it.
I mean,

2747
02:09:19,420 --> 02:09:20,420
there was a study that

2748
02:09:20,470 --> 02:09:24,770
it came out not long ago.
They showed that like 70 percent of like

2749
02:09:24,910 --> 02:09:28,420
herbal supplements on the market aren't,
aren't actually what you think they are.

2750
02:09:28,780 --> 02:09:33,780
So in a lot of cases people are just 
putting some other plane in there and 

2751
02:09:33,780 --> 02:09:33,780
it's like,
you think you're getting,

2752
02:09:34,210 --> 02:09:36,170
you know,
Achalasia or you know,

2753
02:09:36,180 --> 02:09:39,230
and it's like some other crap.
And so that's like,

2754
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:41,470
I think there's a whole,
you know,

2755
02:09:41,490 --> 02:09:46,490
uh,
an opening for people to actually do 

2756
02:09:46,490 --> 02:09:47,050
like some DNA barcoding where you can 
actually test,

2757
02:09:47,051 --> 02:09:52,051
you know,
what's in a supplement and start a 

2758
02:09:52,051 --> 02:09:52,051
company where it's like,
I've,

2759
02:09:52,051 --> 02:09:55,340
I've tested these supplements and 
they're actually what they're saying 

2760
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:55,340
they're supposed to be,
you know,

2761
02:09:55,340 --> 02:09:59,941
because it's like you've got a huge 
problem when people are trying to buy 

2762
02:09:59,941 --> 02:10:03,901
certain supplements.
And then they're not even getting what 

2763
02:10:03,901 --> 02:10:03,901
they think their body,
regardless of whether or not there's any

2764
02:10:03,901 --> 02:10:05,950
science to back up with what they think 
they're buying.

2765
02:10:05,951 --> 02:10:07,800
Is he doing anything?
I mean the point is they should,

2766
02:10:07,930 --> 02:10:09,390
they should be getting what they think 
they're getting.

2767
02:10:09,450 --> 02:10:12,990
And then of course there's a huge issue 
of homeopathic cures,

2768
02:10:12,991 --> 02:10:17,130
which are mostly nonsense.
There's a huge homeopathic industry.

2769
02:10:17,131 --> 02:10:21,390
There's essentially selling you sugar,
you total bullshit.

2770
02:10:21,600 --> 02:10:26,600
They've.
There was a recent study on homeopathic 

2771
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:28,900
the,
the actual ingredients and some 

2772
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:28,900
homeopathic cures and

2773
02:10:28,900 --> 02:10:32,210
a lot of it was sugar.
So like they're literally selling sugar 

2774
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:32,210
pills.
Yeah.

2775
02:10:32,210 --> 02:10:33,920
There's a difference between,
you know,

2776
02:10:34,220 --> 02:10:39,220
not having certain vitamins and minerals
and fatty acids in your diet and things 

2777
02:10:39,231 --> 02:10:40,100
that can,
you know,

2778
02:10:40,101 --> 02:10:42,710
if it affects your immune system and 
affects cognitive function,

2779
02:10:42,711 --> 02:10:46,340
it affects all these different things.
And then taking all this other crap that

2780
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:51,560
I don't know,
people like the I the idea of some 

2781
02:10:51,560 --> 02:10:51,590
exotic thing isolated from somewhere and
it's like,

2782
02:10:51,591 --> 02:10:54,470
oh,
it does this because it's exotic and you

2783
02:10:54,471 --> 02:10:55,350
know,
the reality is,

2784
02:10:55,351 --> 02:11:00,351
is people,
they should be focusing on what they're 

2785
02:11:00,351 --> 02:11:00,351
not getting.
That's essential for,

2786
02:11:00,351 --> 02:11:01,430
you know,
things that we know that's essential for

2787
02:11:01,431 --> 02:11:04,060
the proteins in their body to work.
Um,

2788
02:11:04,130 --> 02:11:06,950
and so that a lot of that homeopathic 
stuff,

2789
02:11:06,990 --> 02:11:09,350
it gets mixed in with the vitamins and 
minerals to.

2790
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:12,050
And that's really irritating because 
it's really.

2791
02:11:12,080 --> 02:11:15,420
There are two different things.
Yeah.

2792
02:11:15,470 --> 02:11:18,430
Nutrition and homeopathic.
Yeah.

2793
02:11:19,370 --> 02:11:21,800
There's a lot of nonsense if you're 
interested in that.

2794
02:11:21,860 --> 02:11:26,860
Just Google a homeopathic medicine,
sugar pills and there's all of studies,

2795
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:30,880
there's a lot of different stuff on,
on sugar pills actually.

2796
02:11:30,890 --> 02:11:35,450
They've shown they've done a placebo 
effects studies using sugar pill pills,

2797
02:11:35,970 --> 02:11:37,300
um,
where they've published.

2798
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:42,520
They've given someone a placebo.
I mean the whole point of the study was 

2799
02:11:42,520 --> 02:11:44,630
not for the person conducting it to not 
know who had the placebo.

2800
02:11:44,631 --> 02:11:45,170
It was,
okay,

2801
02:11:45,171 --> 02:11:49,010
let's see if the placebo effect is real.
And it absolutely is real.

2802
02:11:49,011 --> 02:11:50,540
I mean there are people,
people,

2803
02:11:50,930 --> 02:11:53,900
if they think they're getting something,
they will experience something,

2804
02:11:53,930 --> 02:11:54,920
you know,
and it's real to them.

2805
02:11:54,921 --> 02:11:58,100
And then actually they,
they don't get sick as much or they feel

2806
02:11:58,101 --> 02:11:59,210
better,
you know.

2807
02:11:59,211 --> 02:12:04,211
So there's,
there's definitely something to be said 

2808
02:12:04,211 --> 02:12:06,671
for a sugar pill.
And maybe that's part of the success of 

2809
02:12:06,671 --> 02:12:06,920
things like homeopathy.
That's really confusing,

2810
02:12:06,921 --> 02:12:11,921
isn't it?
The placebo effect is absolutely 

2811
02:12:11,921 --> 02:12:13,310
fascinating that you can send the mind a
signal or,

2812
02:12:13,311 --> 02:12:18,040
or instill it in a mind by taking a pill
and then the mind believes that medicine

2813
02:12:18,050 --> 02:12:23,050
is there and then conducts business as 
if this new found healing property 

2814
02:12:23,050 --> 02:12:23,050
exists.

2815
02:12:23,060 --> 02:12:23,630
Yeah.
No.

2816
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:24,620
And it's,
it is real.

2817
02:12:24,621 --> 02:12:26,420
The placebo effect is real,
but we don't know why.

2818
02:12:26,421 --> 02:12:27,800
Right.
I mean,

2819
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:30,590
I haven't really done a ton of research 
and understanding why,

2820
02:12:30,591 --> 02:12:31,490
but yeah,
it's,

2821
02:12:32,090 --> 02:12:34,700
it's,
it's interesting how your brain can,

2822
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:36,050
you know,
make your,

2823
02:12:36,140 --> 02:12:41,140
make yourself think that something's 
working and you actually can force 

2824
02:12:41,140 --> 02:12:41,840
yourself to be healthier.
I mean,

2825
02:12:42,410 --> 02:12:45,290
so it's fascinating.
It is very,

2826
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:46,610
very,
very fascinating.

2827
02:12:46,640 --> 02:12:47,840
Endlessly,
endlessly.

2828
02:12:47,841 --> 02:12:48,640
So,
I mean,

2829
02:12:48,650 --> 02:12:53,650
the human being is like a human body is 
to me essentially like the most 

2830
02:12:53,650 --> 02:12:58,241
incredibly complex computer ever.
And we don't have a guidebook for it 

2831
02:12:58,241 --> 02:13:02,170
right now.
We're just talking about the physical 

2832
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:02,210
aspects of it.
Forget about managing your mind,

2833
02:13:03,370 --> 02:13:07,280
your thought process,
which also can lead to a lot of ailments

2834
02:13:07,281 --> 02:13:10,330
and incorrect thinking and thinking 
apps.

2835
02:13:10,590 --> 02:13:11,810
I mean,
when I started getting,

2836
02:13:11,811 --> 02:13:14,900
when I started researching these studies
on the effects of,

2837
02:13:14,990 --> 02:13:19,990
you know,
depleting trip to fan from your brain 

2838
02:13:19,990 --> 02:13:19,990
and how like normal people all of a 
sudden become like,

2839
02:13:19,990 --> 02:13:21,540
impulsive,
impulsive,

2840
02:13:21,541 --> 02:13:22,250
like,
you know,

2841
02:13:22,400 --> 02:13:24,890
violence and impulsive behaviors and 
recidivism.

2842
02:13:24,891 --> 02:13:25,460
So they,
like,

2843
02:13:25,970 --> 02:13:30,970
they'll do these tests were they 
punished for doing something wrong and 

2844
02:13:30,970 --> 02:13:33,661
they'll.
And they'll keep repeating the same 

2845
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:33,661
thing.
I mean,

2846
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:33,661
I was like,
I can't believe

2847
02:13:33,661 --> 02:13:35,070
you can change someone's behavior by 
depleting trip to fan.

2848
02:13:35,071 --> 02:13:37,140
Like that's,
that was really,

2849
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:38,910
you know,
amazing to me.

2850
02:13:38,911 --> 02:13:43,911
And,
and the way that nutrition affects your 

2851
02:13:43,911 --> 02:13:46,821
brain function in general and behavior 
is really interesting to me because it 

2852
02:13:46,821 --> 02:13:49,380
suggests that we have to some degree,
some control over our cognitive function

2853
02:13:49,381 --> 02:13:51,390
behavior.
And I think that we should be optimizing

2854
02:13:51,391 --> 02:13:54,330
that as much as we can to,
you know,

2855
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:59,540
perform better to have better cognitive 
skills and to also better society by 

2856
02:13:59,540 --> 02:13:59,760
behaving better.
You know,

2857
02:13:59,761 --> 02:14:00,780
so,
you know,

2858
02:14:00,781 --> 02:14:05,781
they've,
they've done studies with like school 

2859
02:14:05,781 --> 02:14:07,651
children where they've giving them like 
omega three fatty acids and 

2860
02:14:07,651 --> 02:14:08,150
multivitamins and it's absolutely,
you know,

2861
02:14:08,380 --> 02:14:10,020
how effected their,
their,

2862
02:14:10,021 --> 02:14:13,950
um,
Iq scores in some cases by like dramatic

2863
02:14:13,951 --> 02:14:16,650
effects and even affected juvenile 
delinquency and juvenile.

2864
02:14:16,651 --> 02:14:17,990
Yeah,
it's effected,

2865
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:21,630
effected juvenile delinquency.
There's been studies showing that giving

2866
02:14:21,631 --> 02:14:24,660
these people a multivitamin and omega 
three fatty acids.

2867
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:26,760
So it's hard to pinpoint what 
specifically in it,

2868
02:14:26,820 --> 02:14:31,820
but I think it's a combination of 
everything because these pathways are 

2869
02:14:31,820 --> 02:14:32,820
all working together,
but it's affecting their.

2870
02:14:33,360 --> 02:14:34,680
What I think is happening is,
you know,

2871
02:14:34,681 --> 02:14:36,630
it's also affecting their serotonin and 
so they're,

2872
02:14:36,860 --> 02:14:37,500
you know,
they're not,

2873
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:39,850
they're not as impulsive,
they're there,

2874
02:14:39,851 --> 02:14:42,410
you know,
it's more like long term thinking there.

2875
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:45,210
It's,
it's absolutely fascinating that you can

2876
02:14:45,211 --> 02:14:50,211
actually,
through nutrition affects someone's 

2877
02:14:50,211 --> 02:14:52,071
behavior.
There was another study where they had 

2878
02:14:52,071 --> 02:14:54,441
given prisoners omega three fatty acids 
and it affected their aggressive 

2879
02:14:54,931 --> 02:14:57,010
outbursts.
Um,

2880
02:14:57,590 --> 02:14:58,490
you know,
because that's another,

2881
02:14:58,520 --> 02:14:59,760
that's a whole other topic.
You know,

2882
02:14:59,761 --> 02:15:04,761
you've got a population of people that's
incarcerated and knows what they're 

2883
02:15:04,761 --> 02:15:09,660
getting fed,
probably deficient in multiple 

2884
02:15:09,660 --> 02:15:12,411
micronutrients,
including omega three fatty acids and 

2885
02:15:12,411 --> 02:15:12,411
Vitamin D.

2886
02:15:12,411 --> 02:15:15,290
Guy on recently is kid war machines,
have a MMA fighter,

2887
02:15:15,620 --> 02:15:17,540
John Copa neighbors,
his real name war machines,

2888
02:15:17,550 --> 02:15:19,320
his fighting name,
pretty cute,

2889
02:15:20,240 --> 02:15:23,390
and he was talking about a year that he 
did in prison where they.

2890
02:15:23,391 --> 02:15:28,391
They gave him 1500 calories a day and it
was horrible nutrition and just how his 

2891
02:15:28,391 --> 02:15:29,570
body just felt like it was wasting away 
because of it.

2892
02:15:29,990 --> 02:15:30,530
Yeah.
See,

2893
02:15:30,531 --> 02:15:32,120
this is,
I would like to see,

2894
02:15:32,570 --> 02:15:37,570
you know,
we're spending money to keep people in 

2895
02:15:37,570 --> 02:15:37,570
prison.
You know what,

2896
02:15:37,570 --> 02:15:41,560
why not give them,
give their brain the proper nutrients 

2897
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:42,770
they need to try to heal itself,
to try to make it work better.

2898
02:15:42,771 --> 02:15:43,090
You know,

2899
02:15:43,250 --> 02:15:48,250
you're talking silly because you're 
talking about a person wants to fix 

2900
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:48,250
people.
They're just trying to make money.

2901
02:15:48,250 --> 02:15:52,310
I mean they don't really care,
but when you're dealing with privatized 

2902
02:15:52,310 --> 02:15:54,791
prisons and you're also dealing with 
prison guard unions that are trying to 

2903
02:15:55,671 --> 02:16:00,671
keep people in prison,
so they have prison guards that have 

2904
02:16:00,671 --> 02:16:00,671
jobs.
I mean,

2905
02:16:00,671 --> 02:16:04,850
you're,
you're not dealing with a whole system 

2906
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:05,720
where the entire system is dedicated to 
actually rehabilitating people.

2907
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:08,660
That sort of bullshit.
They pretend it is there.

2908
02:16:08,860 --> 02:16:09,890
It's just a system.

2909
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:12,790
Someone can start a company,
you know that,

2910
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:14,120
that,
that donate.

2911
02:16:14,121 --> 02:16:16,130
That basically is a charity that we give
them to.

2912
02:16:16,131 --> 02:16:19,140
These people donate money and we give 
people these vitamins,

2913
02:16:19,141 --> 02:16:22,040
these Omega three and vitamin D and 
multivitamins in prison.

2914
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:22,760
People are not gonna.

2915
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:24,460
They're going to say,
listen,

2916
02:16:24,461 --> 02:16:26,740
if you want to give people nutrients and
vitamins,

2917
02:16:26,741 --> 02:16:31,741
give it to poor people.
Give it to poor people that haven't 

2918
02:16:31,741 --> 02:16:31,741
committed crimes,
don't ever

2919
02:16:31,741 --> 02:16:32,170
give it to prisoners.
Don't try to fix presidents.

2920
02:16:32,171 --> 02:16:34,930
I see what you're saying.
I see your point of view,

2921
02:16:34,931 --> 02:16:36,910
but I,
I see how people are going to say,

2922
02:16:36,911 --> 02:16:41,911
if you're going to start somewhere,
don't start with people that have 

2923
02:16:41,911 --> 02:16:41,911
already fucked.
We should definitely start with.

2924
02:16:41,911 --> 02:16:43,150
We should definitely give him the poor 
people also.

2925
02:16:43,210 --> 02:16:44,140
I mean,
you know,

2926
02:16:44,141 --> 02:16:49,141
we need to make sure that,
that these people that can't afford to 

2927
02:16:49,141 --> 02:16:53,370
eat all these greens and fish every day,
we can at least give them a fish oil 

2928
02:16:53,370 --> 02:16:57,961
pill and you know,
a vitamin D pill and multivitamin to 

2929
02:16:57,961 --> 02:16:57,970
help give,
give him some of those micronutrients,

2930
02:16:57,971 --> 02:17:02,971
particularly the children that are not 
doing well and on their cognitive tests 

2931
02:17:02,971 --> 02:17:06,421
and having behavioral problems and it's 
like people don't want to ever think 

2932
02:17:06,421 --> 02:17:06,610
about the fact that nutrition plays a 
role in that.

2933
02:17:06,611 --> 02:17:11,160
It's not just all genetics,
it's not all environment and you know,

2934
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:14,050
in terms of being abused or.

2935
02:17:14,050 --> 02:17:17,980
I mean that definitely plays a role for 
sure that there is,

2936
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:23,280
there is a component of nutrition that 
we can control to some degree and it's 

2937
02:17:24,110 --> 02:17:25,630
cheap.
It's a cheap solution.

2938
02:17:25,900 --> 02:17:28,120
Vitamins aren't that expensive.
I mean,

2939
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,920
relatively speaking you can,
you can get a Omega three pill,

2940
02:17:31,940 --> 02:17:32,950
vitamin D,
pill,

2941
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:37,210
multivitamin,
and it's not that much money a month.

2942
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:40,150
Now there was something else that you 
said that you wanted to talk about.

2943
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:42,010
The Dave asprey had said that was 
incorrect.

2944
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:44,110
That was the epigenetic tests.
Uh,

2945
02:17:44,111 --> 02:17:44,420
they,
uh,

2946
02:17:44,421 --> 02:17:49,421
the Swedish study I had listened to the 
podcast that you'd had some time ago and

2947
02:17:50,410 --> 02:17:51,730
you know,
he's got good information,

2948
02:17:51,731 --> 02:17:54,670
I don't want to say otherwise,
but it was just,

2949
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:57,130
I wanted to correct that because he had 
said that the,

2950
02:17:57,410 --> 02:18:01,390
the children from the well fed,
uh,

2951
02:18:01,450 --> 02:18:04,420
the ones that were grandchildren of the 
well fed children lived,

2952
02:18:04,900 --> 02:18:06,530
got type two diabetes less.

2953
02:18:06,880 --> 02:18:08,510
That was completely wrong.
It was,

2954
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:10,150
it was the opposite.
Yeah.

2955
02:18:10,151 --> 02:18:13,510
He's a collector of interesting ideas 
and uh,

2956
02:18:13,530 --> 02:18:18,530
although I liked the guy,
he gets shit wrong and I don't know if 

2957
02:18:18,530 --> 02:18:22,561
he's always that good about recognizing 
when he has done that and correcting 

2958
02:18:22,751 --> 02:18:23,970
themself.
We,

2959
02:18:24,130 --> 02:18:27,590
we've had a real issue with him as of 
lately because of microtoxins.

2960
02:18:27,610 --> 02:18:29,970
I don't know if you're aware of the 
whole issue of micro topics.

2961
02:18:30,020 --> 02:18:31,330
A little bit about it.
Um,

2962
02:18:31,870 --> 02:18:36,870
yeah.
I'm not concerned about mycotoxins and 

2963
02:18:36,870 --> 02:18:39,601
coffee.
I'm more concerned about not getting my 

2964
02:18:39,601 --> 02:18:42,400
Omega three and all the other 
micronutrients and involved in.

2965
02:18:42,890 --> 02:18:45,880
I mean aflatoxins certainly something I 
don't want,

2966
02:18:45,881 --> 02:18:50,881
but that's peanuts.
So mycotoxins in peanuts are a real 

2967
02:18:51,311 --> 02:18:52,930
issue as well.
And corn,

2968
02:18:52,990 --> 02:18:54,430
that's a.
that's another real issue.

2969
02:18:55,240 --> 02:18:59,770
Here's the issue.
This guy is selling coffee and now we're

2970
02:18:59,771 --> 02:19:04,771
selling this coffee through on it.
That was supposed to be the cure to this

2971
02:19:05,141 --> 02:19:07,270
issue.
Is this the coffee microtoxins?

2972
02:19:07,271 --> 02:19:12,271
No,
you're actually drinking Hawaiian Kona 

2973
02:19:12,271 --> 02:19:15,241
coffee that I started drinking.
I started drinking right after we got 

2974
02:19:15,241 --> 02:19:17,560
our results back on the mycotoxins 
tests.

2975
02:19:18,270 --> 02:19:21,880
So his.
His contention was that 70 plus percent,

2976
02:19:21,881 --> 02:19:26,881
whatever it was of all coffee,
is infected with mycotoxins and they 

2977
02:19:26,881 --> 02:19:27,520
make you sick.
That make the coffee tastes bitter.

2978
02:19:27,540 --> 02:19:28,150
They make it tastes

2979
02:19:28,180 --> 02:19:33,180
bad and then make you feel bad.
I took too much of this at face value 

2980
02:19:33,180 --> 02:19:36,761
and parotid,
a lot of the things that he said and 

2981
02:19:36,761 --> 02:19:36,770
then we decided to start looking into it
ourselves.

2982
02:19:36,771 --> 02:19:41,771
Well,
they've known about mycotoxins and 

2983
02:19:41,771 --> 02:19:44,381
coffee for a long time.
There's a pub med study from 1980 about 

2984
02:19:44,381 --> 02:19:44,870
mycotoxins and coffee.
It's always been an issue,

2985
02:19:45,080 --> 02:19:48,640
but they've been able to resolve that 
issue with wet processing,

2986
02:19:48,950 --> 02:19:50,180
wet processing.
The.

2987
02:19:50,181 --> 02:19:55,181
They know how good coffee providers know
how to eliminate this from coughing.

2988
02:19:55,940 --> 02:20:00,830
We tested for random coffees to random 
one starbucks,

2989
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:05,120
one random bag from whole foods,
one coffee that we sell,

2990
02:20:05,210 --> 02:20:08,180
which is the upgraded coffee that Dave 
produces,

2991
02:20:08,540 --> 02:20:10,520
which is good coffee,
good single source coffee,

2992
02:20:10,521 --> 02:20:15,521
and another one called caveman coffee.
None of them tested positive for 

2993
02:20:15,521 --> 02:20:18,791
mycotoxins and so we'll have 70 percent 
of all co coffee as mycotoxins and we 

2994
02:20:18,791 --> 02:20:21,140
had three bags other than the upgraded 
coffee.

2995
02:20:21,710 --> 02:20:26,150
None of them are taking is upgraded,
quote unquote bulletproof process,

2996
02:20:26,840 --> 02:20:27,960
which you won't resolve.
You know,

2997
02:20:28,040 --> 02:20:30,500
he won't reveal what this process is 
publicly.

2998
02:20:30,980 --> 02:20:35,980
And so I kind of feel like it might.
There's some bullshit there for sure.

2999
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:41,830
It's not,
there's no way we're going to find four 

3000
02:20:41,830 --> 02:20:44,420
bags of coffee and test them.
So our friend Tate,

3001
02:20:44,421 --> 02:20:49,421
who runs bulletproof coffee,
he tested two bags and his coffee and 

3002
02:20:49,701 --> 02:20:54,701
this upgraded coffee and allegedly he 
found below threshold levels of 

3003
02:20:54,701 --> 02:20:58,220
mycotoxins in Dave's coffee.
So I didn't know.

3004
02:20:58,310 --> 02:21:00,650
I didn't conduct that test.
I wasn't a part of that test.

3005
02:21:00,651 --> 02:21:03,590
I don't know if it's right,
but what the fuck,

3006
02:21:03,650 --> 02:21:08,210
you know,
like I feel like when you're a guy who's

3007
02:21:08,270 --> 02:21:13,270
running on and doing these kinds of 
interviews and spewing out all these 

3008
02:21:13,270 --> 02:21:15,170
facts,
you have to be really fucking careful.

3009
02:21:15,560 --> 02:21:17,440
You know,
you have to be really fucking careful to

3010
02:21:17,450 --> 02:21:18,290
what you're saying is true.

3011
02:21:18,290 --> 02:21:23,290
And if what you're saying turns out to 
not be accurate and I find out that 

3012
02:21:23,290 --> 02:21:24,530
you're profiting from what you're 
saying,

3013
02:21:24,890 --> 02:21:27,500
it becomes,
it becomes bad.

3014
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:30,490
It becomes a real problem.
And we,

3015
02:21:30,500 --> 02:21:32,750
that's where we are with this upgraded 
coffee thing.

3016
02:21:32,990 --> 02:21:34,430
Um,
we still sell it at,

3017
02:21:34,431 --> 02:21:39,080
on it because it is really good coffee.
But we've removed all of our,

3018
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:41,870
all the literature on the mycotoxin 
issue,

3019
02:21:41,871 --> 02:21:45,200
all of the literature on that.
Because when you talk to the people that

3020
02:21:45,201 --> 02:21:48,320
are in the know in the coffee industry,
coffee growers,

3021
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:53,560
people who grade coffee and rate coffee,
they actually have a rating system that 

3022
02:21:53,931 --> 02:21:54,920
is a,
you know,

3023
02:21:54,921 --> 02:21:57,950
like you'd get a 94 and 95 and you have 
excellent coffee.

3024
02:21:58,100 --> 02:22:03,100
Well,
your coffee loses points of a test 

3025
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:03,100
positive for mycotoxins.
They test it,

3026
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:03,300
you know,
so he's,

3027
02:22:03,420 --> 02:22:06,320
he's sort of created this issue and you 
know,

3028
02:22:06,321 --> 02:22:11,321
and made this issue out to be like,
there's a reason why you have bitter 

3029
02:22:11,321 --> 02:22:11,321
coffee.

3030
02:22:11,321 --> 02:22:11,321
It's a mycotoxin.
Well,

3031
02:22:11,321 --> 02:22:12,500
no it's not.
It's fucking burnt coffee,

3032
02:22:12,501 --> 02:22:14,310
man.
Things are better.

3033
02:22:14,320 --> 02:22:15,010
And coffee.
Yeah,

3034
02:22:15,020 --> 02:22:20,020
you,
if you leave it on the pot and then he 

3035
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,020
stays heated,
it gets,

3036
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,020
it gets bitter.
I mean,

3037
02:22:20,020 --> 02:22:20,540
that's,
they've known that for years.

3038
02:22:20,541 --> 02:22:25,541
There's,
there's no studies out there that show 

3039
02:22:25,541 --> 02:22:28,210
that coffee with mycotoxins in it.
Test bidder and you also like this shit 

3040
02:22:28,210 --> 02:22:32,631
of him saying that all these different 
coffees have tested positive for 

3041
02:22:32,631 --> 02:22:32,631
mycotoxins.
There's no tests.

3042
02:22:32,631 --> 02:22:37,490
He's got no results.
Like you can't just go around saying 

3043
02:22:37,490 --> 02:22:37,830
that without producing the data 
publicly.

3044
02:22:37,831 --> 02:22:39,590
You have to have to.

3045
02:22:41,960 --> 02:22:42,780
I've never,
I mean,

3046
02:22:42,781 --> 02:22:43,620
I certainly,
like I said,

3047
02:22:43,621 --> 02:22:45,430
aflatoxins one thing where,
you know,

3048
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:47,880
that certainly can cause cancer.
Um,

3049
02:22:48,180 --> 02:22:53,180
I've never really been that concerned 
about mycotoxins in my coffee being a 

3050
02:22:53,180 --> 02:22:58,041
carcinogen.
I'm more concerned about my own 

3051
02:22:58,041 --> 02:22:59,130
metabolism generating reactive oxygen 
species because that's generating more,

3052
02:22:59,600 --> 02:23:01,050
you know,
reactive oxygen species.

3053
02:23:01,051 --> 02:23:04,650
Then in some micro toxins in coffee.
And that's,

3054
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:05,970
that's,
you know,

3055
02:23:06,150 --> 02:23:07,170
well,
mycotoxins,

3056
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:09,240
most certainly existed.
They existed.

3057
02:23:09,241 --> 02:23:10,770
Human breast milk,
how about that?

3058
02:23:11,470 --> 02:23:15,930
I'm sure they exist.
I mean I've gotten mycotoxin loopy after

3059
02:23:15,931 --> 02:23:20,931
all.
They're starting to read the different 

3060
02:23:20,931 --> 02:23:23,730
areas where mycotoxins have been found 
or aspects of mycotoxins that can affect

3061
02:23:23,731 --> 02:23:25,770
human health.
But the coffee one,

3062
02:23:25,771 --> 02:23:28,230
they seem to have licked.
They know what the fuck it is,

3063
02:23:28,380 --> 02:23:30,560
they know what causes it and they know 
how to deal with it.

3064
02:23:30,561 --> 02:23:35,561
It's called wet processing.
They know how to not store beans where 

3065
02:23:35,561 --> 02:23:35,561
they can get moldy.

3066
02:23:35,561 --> 02:23:37,140
They know how to prevent these things 
from happening.

3067
02:23:37,590 --> 02:23:39,570
So this guy,
they have incentive to do that.

3068
02:23:40,700 --> 02:23:42,570
So this guy is sort of,
you know,

3069
02:23:42,610 --> 02:23:47,610
he used my platform in a way that I 
don't think is totally ethical and you 

3070
02:23:47,991 --> 02:23:52,991
know,
he claims that he's telling the truth 

3071
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:52,991
and he claims that,
you know,

3072
02:23:52,991 --> 02:23:54,290
if you sign a nondisclosure agreement,
he'll show you always,

3073
02:23:54,540 --> 02:23:56,180
you know,
all his testing methods like.

3074
02:23:56,690 --> 02:23:58,950
But it's,
it seems to be bullshit.

3075
02:23:58,951 --> 02:24:02,550
And I feel bad because I liked the guy 
and I think that,

3076
02:24:02,910 --> 02:24:04,220
first of all he's not.
I mean,

3077
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:09,260
he's a collector of ideas.
He doesn't have a formal education in 

3078
02:24:09,260 --> 02:24:09,330
education,
in nutrition.

3079
02:24:09,510 --> 02:24:12,990
This is not something that he's got a 
phd and he's not,

3080
02:24:12,991 --> 02:24:14,820
you know,
essentially is what I'm saying.

3081
02:24:15,150 --> 02:24:15,960
So,
you know,

3082
02:24:15,961 --> 02:24:20,961
when I talked to you about it,
I'm getting it from someone who went to 

3083
02:24:20,961 --> 02:24:24,171
really good schools and you do research 
every day for a fucking living with 

3084
02:24:24,171 --> 02:24:24,171
that's what you do.

3085
02:24:24,171 --> 02:24:24,510
I do.
Um,

3086
02:24:24,590 --> 02:24:25,860
and,
and like I said,

3087
02:24:25,861 --> 02:24:30,210
I'm not an expert in microtoxin,
but I've sort of not really been worried

3088
02:24:30,211 --> 02:24:35,211
about it and coffee,
just based on the little bit of reading 

3089
02:24:35,211 --> 02:24:35,580
that I've done,
I haven't,

3090
02:24:35,710 --> 02:24:40,710
it hasn't,
seems like it can be an issue if you 

3091
02:24:40,710 --> 02:24:40,710
have mycotoxin infested,
infected coffee.

3092
02:24:40,710 --> 02:24:41,210
But if,
if it does take,

3093
02:24:41,220 --> 02:24:42,930
it's really infected.
We're talking like,

3094
02:24:42,931 --> 02:24:43,710
you know,
if it's like,

3095
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:46,130
if there's a trace amount of it,
you know,

3096
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:48,510
I don't really think it's,
that's the,

3097
02:24:48,540 --> 02:24:50,670
well that's what we found.
Well that's not what we found.

3098
02:24:50,970 --> 02:24:53,100
What we found is the zero.
But what tate,

3099
02:24:53,101 --> 02:24:58,101
my friend tate and caveman coffee found 
in his is below threshold levels of two 

3100
02:24:58,101 --> 02:25:00,180
different types of mycotoxins.
Which is not gonna Affect you at all?

3101
02:25:00,420 --> 02:25:01,140
Well,
not only that,

3102
02:25:01,141 --> 02:25:06,141
they say that anything that's gonna 
increase the expression of genes that 

3103
02:25:06,141 --> 02:25:09,291
are involved in stress resistance can 
have a little bit of a hormetic effect 

3104
02:25:09,291 --> 02:25:09,291
possibly.
That's interesting.

3105
02:25:09,291 --> 02:25:09,810
Yeah.
Well,

3106
02:25:09,811 --> 02:25:14,550
the other thing was that the actual 
process of roasting the beans destroys a

3107
02:25:14,551 --> 02:25:18,010
huge amount of the microtoxins.
A huge amount of the mold gets.

3108
02:25:18,011 --> 02:25:23,011
It's,
gets killed 70 to 80 percent in some 

3109
02:25:23,011 --> 02:25:23,011
cases.
It's reminds me,

3110
02:25:23,011 --> 02:25:24,130
there's this whole linkedin thing

3111
02:25:24,130 --> 02:25:25,900
is another thing when you're saying he,
you know,

3112
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:28,120
that someone destroys the roasting 
process,

3113
02:25:28,121 --> 02:25:29,830
destroys the microtoxin.
Well,

3114
02:25:30,250 --> 02:25:31,720
this whole thing with lectins.
Two,

3115
02:25:31,721 --> 02:25:32,770
that's a big,
uh,

3116
02:25:33,810 --> 02:25:34,610
I don't know who,
you know,

3117
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:37,120
who started this linkedin thing,
I think maybe Mercola,

3118
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:39,160
Mark Macola,
but I think he,

3119
02:25:39,190 --> 02:25:40,420
he talks about it all.
So,

3120
02:25:40,720 --> 02:25:42,850
um,
and it's like,

3121
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:47,880
oh,
you can't eat beans because beans have 

3122
02:25:47,880 --> 02:25:48,010
lectins and lectins cause an immune 
response in your gut.

3123
02:25:48,011 --> 02:25:51,460
And this is going to cause leaky gut.
And that's not the whole story.

3124
02:25:51,490 --> 02:25:52,870
It's,
it's a little more complicated.

3125
02:25:52,871 --> 02:25:55,330
For one,
lectins are activated by heat.

3126
02:25:55,331 --> 02:25:58,540
And so unless you're chewing raw kidney 
beans or lentils,

3127
02:25:58,541 --> 02:26:02,170
you're probably not activating an immune
response in your gut.

3128
02:26:02,171 --> 02:26:07,171
And actually beans are really high in 
fiber and fiber gets broken down into 

3129
02:26:07,171 --> 02:26:11,911
short chain fatty acids,
which actually prevents the immune 

3130
02:26:11,911 --> 02:26:12,430
response in your gut.
So it's actually doing the opposite.

3131
02:26:12,770 --> 02:26:14,210
Um,
you know,

3132
02:26:14,230 --> 02:26:15,490
so there's,
there's people,

3133
02:26:15,491 --> 02:26:18,560
some people have good information,
but they also have some bad information.

3134
02:26:18,561 --> 02:26:20,930
And Yeah,
I agree with you.

3135
02:26:21,050 --> 02:26:23,500
You gotta be careful.
I mean anyone that's offering you like a

3136
02:26:23,501 --> 02:26:24,660
magic bullet,
like this is,

3137
02:26:24,880 --> 02:26:26,260
this is it,
this is the cure.

3138
02:26:26,261 --> 02:26:28,330
This is,
there's,

3139
02:26:29,080 --> 02:26:30,430
it's complicated and they're straight 
up.

3140
02:26:30,680 --> 02:26:33,740
And I should be clear when I say that my
roasting,

3141
02:26:33,741 --> 02:26:36,920
the roasting process supposedly 
eliminates mycotoxins.

3142
02:26:36,921 --> 02:26:40,120
It's just destroys the mold that causes 
the Mycotoxins,

3143
02:26:40,190 --> 02:26:42,830
which is the source upstream of it.
Yeah.

3144
02:26:42,890 --> 02:26:45,230
You're roasting doesn't actually destroy
mycotoxins,

3145
02:26:45,231 --> 02:26:50,231
but it does destroy the mold.
The 70 to 80 percent of it in some 

3146
02:26:50,231 --> 02:26:51,080
cases.
So it's another one of those cases where

3147
02:26:51,081 --> 02:26:52,910
there's too much to know.
There's too much to learn.

3148
02:26:52,911 --> 02:26:57,911
And I have a guy on,
he says he's an expert in some of the 

3149
02:26:57,911 --> 02:27:00,551
things that he says seemed to be 
bullshit and that's the big one that 

3150
02:27:00,551 --> 02:27:01,790
everyone has mold in their coffee except
me.

3151
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,660
I know how my super secret way of 
getting rid of him,

3152
02:27:04,760 --> 02:27:09,230
but I fucking bought it.
So here we have a problem that uh,

3153
02:27:09,260 --> 02:27:11,270
we've allowed to be created,
but I don't,

3154
02:27:11,271 --> 02:27:12,630
I'm not drinking anymore.
Um,

3155
02:27:12,700 --> 02:27:17,700
because of that,
just at a general principle will 

3156
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:17,990
probably eventually stop selling it.
It is good coffee.

3157
02:27:17,991 --> 02:27:19,340
It's good.
Single source coffee.

3158
02:27:19,341 --> 02:27:21,920
There's nothing wrong with the coffee.
Just for me.

3159
02:27:21,921 --> 02:27:24,650
I prefer the coffee from Hawaii.
I love Kona coffee.

3160
02:27:24,651 --> 02:27:27,350
It has a really great taste to it.
So I just started drinking that.

3161
02:27:28,160 --> 02:27:29,090
Upgraded coffee.
Yeah.

3162
02:27:29,710 --> 02:27:30,410
Well,
not only that,

3163
02:27:30,411 --> 02:27:35,411
a lot of people would buy it based on 
this premise that has not been proven 

3164
02:27:35,411 --> 02:27:37,820
that most coffee has mold in it with no 
fucking evidence whatsoever to back that

3165
02:27:37,821 --> 02:27:38,060
up.

3166
02:27:39,010 --> 02:27:42,430
I haven't seen any evidence that most 
coffee has microtoxin and I haven't seen

3167
02:27:42,690 --> 02:27:46,480
evidence that it has levels of micro 
toxins that are harmful.

3168
02:27:47,470 --> 02:27:49,050
So,
you know,

3169
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:53,290
there was one test that showed that in 
the bitterness area,

3170
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:55,600
there was one test that showed that 
mice,

3171
02:27:55,660 --> 02:27:58,780
when they were given saccharin infused 
with Mycotoxins,

3172
02:27:58,810 --> 02:28:01,720
tended to avoid that Saccharin with,
uh,

3173
02:28:01,750 --> 02:28:02,930
with microtoxins.
But,

3174
02:28:03,170 --> 02:28:05,650
but saccharin sweet thing,
I mean,

3175
02:28:05,651 --> 02:28:10,651
it's a sweet product.
I who knows why they're avoiding the 

3176
02:28:10,901 --> 02:28:15,901
taste of the Mycotoxins,
who knows if their bodies have figured 

3177
02:28:15,901 --> 02:28:16,080
out that it's fucking poison.
I mean,

3178
02:28:16,090 --> 02:28:21,090
I don't know,
but running around saying that the 

3179
02:28:21,090 --> 02:28:23,120
reason why coffee is bitter is because 
of just stating it as fact.

3180
02:28:23,240 --> 02:28:26,120
Tenants the same thing that's in the 
Canon.

3181
02:28:26,270 --> 02:28:27,120
So that's what,
that's,

3182
02:28:27,130 --> 02:28:30,130
that's why that's the bitter part.
Coffee and,

3183
02:28:30,200 --> 02:28:32,530
but he causes that.
Uh,

3184
02:28:32,600 --> 02:28:33,920
no,
they're naturally in,

3185
02:28:34,180 --> 02:28:37,070
in,
in the plants and it gets burned.

3186
02:28:37,220 --> 02:28:38,650
That burnt taste,
you know,

3187
02:28:38,740 --> 02:28:43,740
I don't know.
That burnt taste hasn't been done 

3188
02:28:43,740 --> 02:28:46,271
enough.
Research to know what the he does to 

3189
02:28:46,271 --> 02:28:46,271
that process.

3190
02:28:46,271 --> 02:28:46,271
It's possible.
Yeah.

3191
02:28:46,271 --> 02:28:50,560
Well that's what they say mean.
The coffee experts say when I fucking 

3192
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:54,491
read more about coffee over the last 
three weeks than I've ever wanted to 

3193
02:28:54,491 --> 02:28:55,620
read or thought I would ever have to.
Um,

3194
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:01,000
but coffee experts,
here's where it gets pretty clear all 

3195
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:03,140
call bullshit,
all of them call bullshit.

3196
02:29:03,141 --> 02:29:08,141
And what are you saying?
They all clapped bullshit across the 

3197
02:29:08,141 --> 02:29:08,141
board,
not just coffee providers,

3198
02:29:08,141 --> 02:29:09,800
not just coffee growers with coffee 
tasters,

3199
02:29:09,801 --> 02:29:13,580
coffee experts across the board think 
that what he's saying is horseshit.

3200
02:29:14,300 --> 02:29:19,300
That's usually a good sign.
This one guy who's not even a fucking 

3201
02:29:19,300 --> 02:29:21,290
nutrition expert and he's not,
it doesn't have a phd in nutrition.

3202
02:29:21,560 --> 02:29:26,560
He comes along with these incredible 
claims and also has this incredible 

3203
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:28,490
method to alleviate this ailment.
I mean,

3204
02:29:28,491 --> 02:29:31,130
it's one of those classic examples,
you know,

3205
02:29:31,131 --> 02:29:34,370
create a problem and then offer a 
solution profit,

3206
02:29:34,880 --> 02:29:35,360
you know?

3207
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:36,080
And that's,
that's,

3208
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:39,710
it seems to be what's been done here.
Whether or not it's intentional or not,

3209
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:44,860
I don't even think it was intentional,
but I think that he's one of those guys 

3210
02:29:44,860 --> 02:29:48,731
that once he goes down a path to say he 
was wrong or two to try to win some 

3211
02:29:49,670 --> 02:29:54,670
other product on something,
it's hard to then say you were wrong 

3212
02:29:54,670 --> 02:29:55,780
situation where it's.
Yeah,

3213
02:29:55,800 --> 02:29:58,460
it's,
it's tricky because it's not bad coffee.

3214
02:29:58,461 --> 02:30:00,320
It's good coffee.
It tastes good.

3215
02:30:00,380 --> 02:30:01,340
It's,
you know,

3216
02:30:01,370 --> 02:30:03,620
from our testing,
it's mycotoxin free.

3217
02:30:03,800 --> 02:30:06,830
It's single source coffee.
If he just sold it as that,

3218
02:30:06,831 --> 02:30:09,170
it would be a really good product.
There's nothing wrong with it.

3219
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:14,480
The other thing about coffee experts is 
they want to know when it was,

3220
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:16,490
when it was roasted,
they want to know.

3221
02:30:16,491 --> 02:30:20,390
They want to know like it's like there's
a time between when the coffee's roasted

3222
02:30:20,391 --> 02:30:23,450
and how long you should keep it while 
it's still fresh.

3223
02:30:23,720 --> 02:30:25,670
The he doesn't offer that.
It doesn't have any of that.

3224
02:30:25,671 --> 02:30:27,310
So they're calling bullshit on that too 
though.

3225
02:30:27,550 --> 02:30:32,550
If you really cared about coffee,
you would let let us know when it's 

3226
02:30:32,550 --> 02:30:35,141
roasted.
Should have an on a roasted by date or 

3227
02:30:35,141 --> 02:30:35,141
roasted on date.
Yeah,

3228
02:30:35,141 --> 02:30:35,730
yeah,
yeah.

3229
02:30:36,230 --> 02:30:38,420
It sounds like it's pretty fricking 
complicated.

3230
02:30:38,660 --> 02:30:43,660
It's too complicated.
I have children and jobs and things to 

3231
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:47,561
do.
I don't have time to deal with this 

3232
02:30:47,561 --> 02:30:47,561
shit,
but I've,

3233
02:30:47,561 --> 02:30:51,040
you know,
I am obligated now because I got thrust 

3234
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:53,510
into this situation.
It's nice to talk to someone like you to

3235
02:30:53,750 --> 02:30:58,750
clear up some of the misconceptions of 
health and nutrition and to find out 

3236
02:30:58,750 --> 02:31:01,100
what's real and what's not and what what
are issues.

3237
02:31:01,220 --> 02:31:03,290
When I talked to a guy like Brian 
dunning was like,

3238
02:31:03,291 --> 02:31:05,750
you don't need vitamin C.
You don't need this.

3239
02:31:05,751 --> 02:31:07,220
You don't need that,
but look at him.

3240
02:31:07,221 --> 02:31:11,920
He's fucking totally shaped as fat and 
just not taking care of his body.

3241
02:31:11,921 --> 02:31:16,050
He's a no nonsense guy who got fucked 
because he was a kid and he was raised a

3242
02:31:16,051 --> 02:31:19,010
Mormon and now he's trying to counteract
that by being a skeptic I.

3243
02:31:19,170 --> 02:31:20,640
that's really essentially what's going 
on,

3244
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:24,600
but that guy can fuck with people's 
heads because he's not an expert.

3245
02:31:24,930 --> 02:31:28,290
He's clearly not an expert in a lot of 
things,

3246
02:31:28,340 --> 02:31:33,340
so he really shouldn't be reviewing 
scientific literature in my opinion,

3247
02:31:33,600 --> 02:31:37,250
like he needs to get some people that 
really know how to do that.

3248
02:31:37,400 --> 02:31:40,460
If he's going to start trying to 
critically analyze science.

3249
02:31:40,820 --> 02:31:45,820
That's my opinion because I've read some
of his stuff where he's trying to 

3250
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:45,820
critically analyze it.
For example,

3251
02:31:45,820 --> 02:31:47,000
um,
this,

3252
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:52,030
this linus pauling,
he's got something on his website 

3253
02:31:52,030 --> 02:31:54,281
talking about how a vitamin C can't,
has no effect on cancer incidents or can

3254
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:58,820
help if you already have cancer,
can help,

3255
02:31:58,970 --> 02:32:00,320
you know,
kill the cancer cells.

3256
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:05,560
And He puts up these studies by the Mayo
Clinic that couldn't repeat these early 

3257
02:32:05,901 --> 02:32:09,590
studies that were done by Linus Pauling 
and cameron,

3258
02:32:09,591 --> 02:32:12,770
I forgot his name anyways,
I'm in the late seventies,

3259
02:32:12,771 --> 02:32:17,771
but you know,
anyone that's scientists will look at 

3260
02:32:17,771 --> 02:32:17,771
that and go,
oh,

3261
02:32:17,771 --> 02:32:20,930
pauling and cameron gave their patients 
who are cancer patients,

3262
02:32:20,931 --> 02:32:25,931
vitamin C intravenously.
And they did that for a reason because 

3263
02:32:25,931 --> 02:32:30,130
you can only orally absorbed so much 
vitamin C and we'll get into your 

3264
02:32:30,130 --> 02:32:30,130
bloodstream.

3265
02:32:30,130 --> 02:32:30,580
But intravenously you can like,
you know,

3266
02:32:30,860 --> 02:32:33,710
raise it to like millimolar 
concentrations.

3267
02:32:34,040 --> 02:32:35,170
And so,
uh,

3268
02:32:35,420 --> 02:32:40,420
the two mio clinic studies that repeated
it repeated it in quotations gave him 

3269
02:32:40,420 --> 02:32:41,510
orally.
And so,

3270
02:32:41,511 --> 02:32:42,410
you know,
you can't,

3271
02:32:42,740 --> 02:32:47,740
you can't repeat a study and change the 
method of administration from oral to 

3272
02:32:48,320 --> 02:32:49,640
intravenous and say,
Oh yeah,

3273
02:32:49,641 --> 02:32:51,140
we repeated the study.
It didn't work.

3274
02:32:51,410 --> 02:32:54,230
So when your credit,
when you're critically analyzing data,

3275
02:32:54,231 --> 02:32:57,170
you need to focus on those sort of 
details because they are actually really

3276
02:32:57,171 --> 02:33:02,171
important.
And a recent study just came out like 

3277
02:33:02,171 --> 02:33:04,781
two weeks ago where they took patients,
female patients,

3278
02:33:05,061 --> 02:33:10,061
I had ovarian cancer and they gave them 
vitamin C intravenously and they're 

3279
02:33:10,061 --> 02:33:12,650
doing their standard chemo.
It's really hard nowadays to do any sort

3280
02:33:12,651 --> 02:33:13,120
of,
um,

3281
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:17,030
unconventional cancer treatment that's 
not,

3282
02:33:17,031 --> 02:33:18,910
you know,
because it's like you don't want to just

3283
02:33:19,310 --> 02:33:20,240
kill someone.
I mean,

3284
02:33:20,690 --> 02:33:21,590
it's,
it's hard.

3285
02:33:21,591 --> 02:33:23,660
So anyways,
they did it with the chemotherapy and it

3286
02:33:23,661 --> 02:33:28,661
actually killed it.
They killed the cancer cells better and 

3287
02:33:28,661 --> 02:33:30,410
it also alleviated a lot of the negative
symptoms associated with the chemo.

3288
02:33:30,590 --> 02:33:33,410
And this was to study published in 
science,

3289
02:33:33,411 --> 02:33:38,411
translational medicine,
which is a pretty good journal for 

3290
02:33:38,411 --> 02:33:38,411
translational research.
In fact.

3291
02:33:38,411 --> 02:33:38,411
So

3292
02:33:38,411 --> 02:33:43,380
Brian,
Brian has several problems with some of 

3293
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:43,380
the things he puts out,
you know,

3294
02:33:43,380 --> 02:33:47,590
he's accused me of being a pseudoscience
shill and even after the podcast,

3295
02:33:47,620 --> 02:33:52,620
even after the podcast where he came on 
and had all these really ridiculous 

3296
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:57,280
accusations that he,
he threw at me,

3297
02:33:57,510 --> 02:33:58,840
uh,
on his website.

3298
02:33:58,841 --> 02:34:03,841
And we talked about them one by one,
what I believed and what I actually 

3299
02:34:03,841 --> 02:34:03,841
didn't believe,
what I said and what I didn't say,

3300
02:34:03,970 --> 02:34:07,180
and he ran after basically just

3301
02:34:08,610 --> 02:34:12,480
tapping them out mentally for three 
hours just over and over and over again.

3302
02:34:12,540 --> 02:34:14,040
You're wrong here.
You're wrong there.

3303
02:34:14,041 --> 02:34:15,570
This is silly.
This is dumb.

3304
02:34:15,720 --> 02:34:20,720
This is poor thinking.
He went and wrote this really distorted 

3305
02:34:20,720 --> 02:34:21,550
thing on his website.
This is really bizarre account.

3306
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:22,860
I mean,
he was very kind to me,

3307
02:34:22,880 --> 02:34:24,490
said he was.
I was nice and funny,

3308
02:34:24,491 --> 02:34:25,600
but here's why.
Thanks.

3309
02:34:25,601 --> 02:34:30,601
I still promote dangerous pseudoscience,
but if you look at the videos that that 

3310
02:34:30,601 --> 02:34:35,521
guy puts out himself,
he's got this video on fracking and how 

3311
02:34:35,521 --> 02:34:39,160
safe fracking is and how not no need to 
worry about fracking.

3312
02:34:39,161 --> 02:34:44,161
And he's got this really hilarious smug 
video on the reality of fracking or 

3313
02:34:44,711 --> 02:34:49,711
hydraulic fracturing or fracking fucks 
up environments permanently.

3314
02:34:50,111 --> 02:34:55,111
All threads with.
It's been over a thousand instances of 

3315
02:34:55,111 --> 02:34:57,400
poison wells in this country because of 
fracking documented,

3316
02:34:57,580 --> 02:35:00,640
documented instances of poisoned wells.
I mean,

3317
02:35:00,641 --> 02:35:05,641
they fucked up huge parts of this 
country pretty much forever because of 

3318
02:35:05,641 --> 02:35:07,540
fracking.
So what is fracking day like?

3319
02:35:07,541 --> 02:35:08,490
How do they?
Well,

3320
02:35:08,491 --> 02:35:10,750
it's a very complicated process of 
getting a,

3321
02:35:10,840 --> 02:35:15,840
getting this stuff out of the ground,
getting oil and natural gas out of the 

3322
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:16,720
ground,
mostly oil right?

3323
02:35:16,840 --> 02:35:20,050
And it involves water,
hydraulic fracturing,

3324
02:35:20,290 --> 02:35:25,290
and they pump water in and I'm not the 
guy to be describing is this his thing 

3325
02:35:25,290 --> 02:35:25,810
on fracking here?

3326
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:31,750
Why Marvel and Fox blamed the fact that 
fracking was used in the area and 

3327
02:35:32,020 --> 02:35:33,510
investigation into this family.

3328
02:35:33,560 --> 02:35:35,870
First of all,
your music makes me want to kill babies.

3329
02:35:35,930 --> 02:35:40,930
Discovered that their wells had been 
drilled directly into a shallow natural 

3330
02:35:40,930 --> 02:35:41,890
gas deposit.
This is common.

3331
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:44,290
It's not a problem with the wells.
Properly vented.

3332
02:35:44,830 --> 02:35:47,650
There's wasn't so gas got into their 
water.

3333
02:35:48,970 --> 02:35:51,130
How do we know it had nothing to do with
fracking?

3334
02:35:51,490 --> 02:35:56,490
Water wells range in depth from a few 
meters to a few hundred at the very 

3335
02:35:56,490 --> 02:36:00,511
deepest,
but fracking takes place kilometers 

3336
02:36:00,511 --> 02:36:02,410
deeper.
Past numerous layers of bedrock years of

3337
02:36:02,411 --> 02:36:05,170
study have proven what geologists have 
always known.

3338
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:10,560
There's just too much distance of solid 
rock between the two regions for any 

3339
02:36:10,560 --> 02:36:11,350
seat,
but just to take place.

3340
02:36:11,840 --> 02:36:14,260
Stopped at this camera right here.
That's such total horse shit.

3341
02:36:14,660 --> 02:36:19,660
He's just parroting the words of the 
people that have been paid by these 

3342
02:36:19,660 --> 02:36:23,120
companies that are making fucking 
trillions of dollars to say.

3343
02:36:23,121 --> 02:36:24,370
I mean that's what he's doing.
These,

3344
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:26,600
these piss-poor studies,
these,

3345
02:36:26,860 --> 02:36:31,860
these people that have been documented 
on all these various documentaries like 

3346
02:36:31,860 --> 02:36:31,860
there's.
There's,

3347
02:36:31,860 --> 02:36:34,820
there's the two ones on the gas land,
one and gas land too,

3348
02:36:34,821 --> 02:36:38,480
but then there's also people that have 
done interviews and showing how they can

3349
02:36:38,481 --> 02:36:41,760
light their fucking water on fire now 
and showing how their,

3350
02:36:41,761 --> 02:36:45,470
their wells are poisoned.
People who have been really made deathly

3351
02:36:45,471 --> 02:36:48,230
ill by drinking what they thought was 
filtered water,

3352
02:36:48,231 --> 02:36:53,231
but it's not filtered enough because 
some of the chemicals from fracking got 

3353
02:36:53,231 --> 02:36:56,861
into the water,
proven that those are the specific 

3354
02:36:56,861 --> 02:36:58,910
chemicals that are in their water that 
got there from fracking and this is.

3355
02:36:58,940 --> 02:37:02,000
He's just one of those fucking guys.
There was no nonsense.

3356
02:37:02,001 --> 02:37:03,380
Guys,
don't worry.

3357
02:37:03,530 --> 02:37:06,090
The government says it's okay,
we're fine,

3358
02:37:06,200 --> 02:37:08,810
but even his tone that's such an 
affected tone.

3359
02:37:09,050 --> 02:37:12,560
That's like a fake way of talking.
He's talking like this,

3360
02:37:12,561 --> 02:37:17,270
like reassuring you.
That's such nonsense fucking talk,

3361
02:37:18,150 --> 02:37:23,150
you know,
I don't know much about fracking but I 

3362
02:37:23,150 --> 02:37:24,520
can tell you just from reading his 
trying to criticize science,

3363
02:37:24,700 --> 02:37:28,230
he's got a very topical understanding of
it and you know,

3364
02:37:28,480 --> 02:37:31,810
when I was reading some of his stuff,
like I was just like,

3365
02:37:31,811 --> 02:37:33,550
this guy shouldn't be doing this.
Like,

3366
02:37:33,551 --> 02:37:34,630
you know,
it's very,

3367
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:37,840
very naive understanding and so if 
you're gonna try to criticize,

3368
02:37:38,020 --> 02:37:40,150
criticize something and turn and say 
it's not true,

3369
02:37:40,420 --> 02:37:45,420
then you really need to know what you're
talking about or get some frequent 

3370
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:45,420
experts that are really new.

3371
02:37:45,420 --> 02:37:46,990
He's got some real problems with this 
thinking and I think he knows it.

3372
02:37:46,991 --> 02:37:49,720
He sent me an email asking me about 
psychedelics,

3373
02:37:50,020 --> 02:37:52,450
asking me about psychedelics in mind.
Expanding.

3374
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:54,880
I think he knows he's fucked up.
I really do.

3375
02:37:55,050 --> 02:37:58,480
He saw also indicted by the you mean 
he's going to jail?

3376
02:37:58,710 --> 02:37:59,220
He's,
he's,

3377
02:37:59,221 --> 02:38:02,800
he's involved in an Ebay scam.
Scam them from millions of dollars.

3378
02:38:03,010 --> 02:38:04,660
I didn't want to talk about it on the 
podcast,

3379
02:38:04,661 --> 02:38:06,640
but after you talk shit about me and go 
fuck himself,

3380
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:07,800
he,
he's,

3381
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:10,690
he was involved in this Ebay scam where 
they were,

3382
02:38:10,691 --> 02:38:12,010
uh,
they were cookie stuffing,

3383
02:38:12,580 --> 02:38:13,620
stuffing cookies.
You,

3384
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:16,290
you'd go to use an application and I 
don't,

3385
02:38:16,300 --> 02:38:18,350
I don't know the full details of it,
but it,

3386
02:38:18,460 --> 02:38:21,400
he's in real trouble.
And you pleaded guilty and he's a felon.

3387
02:38:21,570 --> 02:38:23,590
She was asking you about psychedelics.
It's,

3388
02:38:23,640 --> 02:38:24,780
it's very

3389
02:38:24,910 --> 02:38:29,910
well.
I think he wants to try to figure out 

3390
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:29,910
what the fuck's wrong with his thinking.
Well,

3391
02:38:29,910 --> 02:38:34,540
I just,
I really think that it has to do with 

3392
02:38:34,540 --> 02:38:34,540
growing up Mormon.
I really think that there's,

3393
02:38:34,540 --> 02:38:38,640
there's,
it's not a small amount that it fucks 

3394
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:41,851
your head up when you grow up in a 
fundamentalist mindset when you were 

3395
02:38:41,851 --> 02:38:45,181
told that there's a man in the sky that 
Joseph Smith told his disciples about 

3396
02:38:46,360 --> 02:38:51,360
and that there's golden tablets at the 
last work of Jesus and this guy found 

3397
02:38:51,360 --> 02:38:54,931
him when he was 14.
I mean all the shit that you have to 

3398
02:38:54,931 --> 02:38:55,240
believe to be a mormon.
This guy bought into that hook,

3399
02:38:55,241 --> 02:38:57,460
line and sinker,
and that's how he grew up.

3400
02:38:57,490 --> 02:39:01,180
That's how he grew up as a child.
That's how he grew up as a teenager.

3401
02:39:01,181 --> 02:39:03,350
That's how we grew up as a man,
until he refuted it and,

3402
02:39:03,400 --> 02:39:05,320
and your thought process.

3403
02:39:05,350 --> 02:39:07,590
Now he just doesn't believe anything.
It's like,

3404
02:39:07,591 --> 02:39:08,010
okay,
well,

3405
02:39:08,160 --> 02:39:10,650
everything that I was told throughout my
life is wrong.

3406
02:39:10,651 --> 02:39:11,580
So then everything else,

3407
02:39:12,520 --> 02:39:17,520
if you just googled dangers of fracking,
there is a tremendous amount of 

3408
02:39:18,431 --> 02:39:21,790
information out there about fracking,
about what's bad,

3409
02:39:21,791 --> 02:39:23,470
about fracking,
about the dangers.

3410
02:39:23,710 --> 02:39:26,020
And we had Peter Schiff on the podcast 
who's,

3411
02:39:26,021 --> 02:39:26,530
uh,
you know,

3412
02:39:26,531 --> 02:39:28,270
economic genius,
very smart guy,

3413
02:39:28,570 --> 02:39:33,570
but also owns fracking companies.
And he was talking about it and when I 

3414
02:39:33,570 --> 02:39:35,170
brought it up to him,
he didn't deny the dangers of it.

3415
02:39:35,210 --> 02:39:36,490
What he said was,
look,

3416
02:39:36,491 --> 02:39:39,340
those people got money and they got 
millions of dollars because of that.

3417
02:39:39,570 --> 02:39:40,840
Like,
that's a great thing for them.

3418
02:39:40,841 --> 02:39:45,841
Like in his mind,
millions of dollars is okay to poison 

3419
02:39:45,841 --> 02:39:46,390
places forever.
I mean,

3420
02:39:46,600 --> 02:39:48,610
it's,
I'm no fracking expert.

3421
02:39:48,611 --> 02:39:53,611
I don't claim to be a fracking expert,
but if one fraction of what is said 

3422
02:39:53,611 --> 02:39:58,351
about fracking,
the negative aspects of fracking is 

3423
02:39:58,351 --> 02:39:58,351
true.
It's a tricky thing.

3424
02:39:58,351 --> 02:39:59,020
It's a very tricky thing.
Yes,

3425
02:39:59,170 --> 02:40:00,940
we could use the natural resources.

3426
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:01,990
Yes.
You know,

3427
02:40:01,991 --> 02:40:06,991
uh,
it would be nice to not be dependent on 

3428
02:40:06,991 --> 02:40:06,991
foreign oil.
However,

3429
02:40:06,991 --> 02:40:08,740
if you really are destroying thousands 
of wells,

3430
02:40:08,770 --> 02:40:13,770
if that's really is documented,
if really people are getting sick from 

3431
02:40:13,770 --> 02:40:17,731
drinking water that's contaminated with 
a very chemicals that they use for 

3432
02:40:17,731 --> 02:40:18,120
fracking,
you know,

3433
02:40:18,180 --> 02:40:23,180
that doesn't seem like it's good.
That seems like that's something that 

3434
02:40:23,180 --> 02:40:24,780
most people are not aware of.
And when you find out who are the people

3435
02:40:24,781 --> 02:40:29,781
that are,
that are funding these studies that are 

3436
02:40:29,781 --> 02:40:29,781
saying it's safe and where's the money 
coming from?

3437
02:40:29,781 --> 02:40:31,350
A lot of it's coming from these oil 
companies.

3438
02:40:31,351 --> 02:40:34,230
A lot of it is coming from these oil 
companies and the reason why these,

3439
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:39,350
these,
these laws are in place in the first 

3440
02:40:39,350 --> 02:40:41,451
place.
A lot of it is because people have been 

3441
02:40:41,451 --> 02:40:41,451
greased,
a lot of is people been paid off.

3442
02:40:41,451 --> 02:40:45,411
They understand that there's a lot of 
money to be made in this and they've 

3443
02:40:45,411 --> 02:40:48,021
allowed the doors to be open for these 
companies to come in and fuck up giant 

3444
02:40:48,021 --> 02:40:48,930
parts of the country forever.

3445
02:40:50,700 --> 02:40:53,630
Not according to Brian Dawning,
don't worry.

3446
02:40:53,780 --> 02:40:57,590
Hydraulic fracturing takes place 
kilometers into the earth.

3447
02:40:57,720 --> 02:41:00,470
Right.
Sleep tight.

3448
02:41:01,010 --> 02:41:03,960
Don't worry about Ebay.
Poor bastard.

3449
02:41:04,760 --> 02:41:06,260
Poor bastard.
I liked him.

3450
02:41:06,290 --> 02:41:07,870
He's not a bad guy too,
but you know,

3451
02:41:08,600 --> 02:41:13,600
he said after the podcast,
he said he would remove me from his 

3452
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:13,600
list.
He said,

3453
02:41:13,600 --> 02:41:14,570
you've convinced me.
I'm going to remove you from my last.

3454
02:41:14,750 --> 02:41:17,750
Then from just getting crushed by people
online,

3455
02:41:17,751 --> 02:41:22,751
the poor,
poor guy got destroyed on twitter 

3456
02:41:22,751 --> 02:41:25,990
because people listened to the podcast.
We're so frustrated by him and the 

3457
02:41:25,990 --> 02:41:26,990
ridiculous way he thinks and the 
ridiculous things that he was saying.

3458
02:41:27,050 --> 02:41:28,340
Yeah,
just the same pod.

3459
02:41:28,370 --> 02:41:30,240
It must have been the same one.
I had only been online.

3460
02:41:30,290 --> 02:41:30,870
Sorry.
Okay.

3461
02:41:30,940 --> 02:41:32,600
That was so infuriating.
Yeah.

3462
02:41:32,840 --> 02:41:33,840
Yeah.
That's.

3463
02:41:35,810 --> 02:41:36,430
You know,
I,

3464
02:41:36,431 --> 02:41:38,360
I,
I haven't seen all your podcasts,

3465
02:41:38,361 --> 02:41:43,361
but I can tell that you're.
You don't seem to be a promoter of 

3466
02:41:43,361 --> 02:41:46,670
pseudoscience.
You seem to be an inquisitive person 

3467
02:41:46,670 --> 02:41:49,481
that likes to critically think about 
things and you're also very open minded.

3468
02:41:49,671 --> 02:41:50,570
So it's like,
well,

3469
02:41:50,571 --> 02:41:51,650
what if this is,
you know,

3470
02:41:51,651 --> 02:41:56,651
let's think about,
let's think about how this could be 

3471
02:41:56,651 --> 02:41:56,651
working in.
What if it is true?

3472
02:41:56,651 --> 02:41:56,651
It's not,
you know,

3473
02:41:56,651 --> 02:42:01,170
there's,
there's a difference between thinking 

3474
02:42:01,170 --> 02:42:02,681
like that and,
and pseudoscience where you're just 

3475
02:42:02,681 --> 02:42:02,681
like,
you know,

3476
02:42:02,681 --> 02:42:04,280
you're just crazy and like you're 
thinking,

3477
02:42:04,300 --> 02:42:05,740
oh,
there's the.

3478
02:42:06,350 --> 02:42:08,650
I don't think he can see the reference.
Yeah,

3479
02:42:08,660 --> 02:42:13,660
the differentiate between someone that's
actually just inquisitive and open 

3480
02:42:13,660 --> 02:42:16,380
minded and doesn't see things as okay,
it's either this or that and you know,

3481
02:42:16,400 --> 02:42:18,890
maybe there's something that we don't 
understand and you know what,

3482
02:42:18,891 --> 02:42:20,450
there is a lot that we don't understand.

3483
02:42:20,450 --> 02:42:25,040
Like it's even even for just back to 
nutrition,

3484
02:42:25,041 --> 02:42:26,090
you know,
like taking,

3485
02:42:26,240 --> 02:42:29,750
eating a plate full of green vegetables,
what we think we're getting vitaminK and

3486
02:42:29,751 --> 02:42:34,751
folic acid and magnesium,
but there's a whole bunch of crap in 

3487
02:42:34,751 --> 02:42:34,751
there.
We don't know what it's doing.

3488
02:42:34,751 --> 02:42:36,680
We don't know what's in there and what 
it's doing and how it's affecting,

3489
02:42:36,980 --> 02:42:38,320
you know,
you know,

3490
02:42:38,330 --> 02:42:43,330
processes in our body and we do know 
that there's good stuff going on in 

3491
02:42:43,330 --> 02:42:43,610
there and things that we don't even 
understand.

3492
02:42:43,611 --> 02:42:45,280
So yeah,
there's a lot of stuff that we just,

3493
02:42:45,390 --> 02:42:47,900
we can't explain yet.
We're trying to.

3494
02:42:48,740 --> 02:42:49,410
I'm not sure

3495
02:42:49,620 --> 02:42:53,570
a concern would look like a fool.
So if something comes up and I go,

3496
02:42:53,571 --> 02:42:55,160
where is that possible?
Is that true?

3497
02:42:55,180 --> 02:42:56,900
[inaudible] let's,
let's think about if that's possible.

3498
02:42:56,990 --> 02:43:01,990
There's a lot of people that are very 
concerned about looking like fools that 

3499
02:43:01,990 --> 02:43:05,111
won't go down those roads.
They won't say something absolutely 

3500
02:43:05,111 --> 02:43:05,111
ridiculous,
you know,

3501
02:43:05,111 --> 02:43:09,191
like,
do you think the CIA really did kill 

3502
02:43:09,191 --> 02:43:09,191
Kennedy?
Let's think about it.

3503
02:43:09,191 --> 02:43:09,191
You think it's possible for them to kill
Kennedy?

3504
02:43:09,191 --> 02:43:10,030
The,
a lot of people that go,

3505
02:43:10,031 --> 02:43:11,320
oh,
come on now,

3506
02:43:11,440 --> 02:43:14,110
look,
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

3507
02:43:14,140 --> 02:43:16,630
Case closed.
We're done here.

3508
02:43:16,800 --> 02:43:18,760
You know,
they want to be that no nonsense guy.

3509
02:43:18,761 --> 02:43:23,761
That doesn't look like a fool.
But the problem is there's a lot of 

3510
02:43:23,761 --> 02:43:27,120
nonsense in the world and if you really 
look into things openminded,

3511
02:43:27,130 --> 02:43:32,080
you find that there's some gray and 
everything in almost every subject.

3512
02:43:32,081 --> 02:43:33,430
There's some fucking weirdness.

3513
02:43:34,090 --> 02:43:39,090
I agree 100 percent for Brian dunning.
All I have to say to him is I'm hired 

3514
02:43:43,201 --> 02:43:45,180
some people that like know how to,
you know,

3515
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:50,760
read science and critically analyze it.
If you're going to call yourself a 

3516
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:50,760
science writer for God's sake,
you know?

3517
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:55,760
Yeah.
Well the people like that along with 

3518
02:43:55,760 --> 02:43:57,170
people like Dave Asprey,
who got the information on the,

3519
02:43:57,171 --> 02:43:57,980
uh,
the study,

3520
02:43:58,040 --> 02:44:03,040
the dietary study incorrect.
There is a real problem with those guys 

3521
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:04,700
because they're not a guy like me who's 
not a fucking expert in anything.

3522
02:44:04,880 --> 02:44:09,880
Look,
if you asked me questions about martial 

3523
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:11,801
arts,
if you ask me questions about standup 

3524
02:44:11,801 --> 02:44:11,801
comedy,
I can give you the opinion of an expert.

3525
02:44:11,801 --> 02:44:14,210
I am a true expert in those very small 
areas.

3526
02:44:14,240 --> 02:44:16,370
That's it.
When you talk to me about anything else,

3527
02:44:16,371 --> 02:44:18,290
I'll go,
I fucking read some shit online.

3528
02:44:18,760 --> 02:44:20,450
I read a book.
I'm not an expert,

3529
02:44:20,451 --> 02:44:23,690
but when people start spouting shit out 
as fact,

3530
02:44:24,080 --> 02:44:29,080
I'm learning on this podcast that there 
is a big responsibility that I'm 

3531
02:44:29,080 --> 02:44:29,890
learning how,
how the,

3532
02:44:29,891 --> 02:44:34,891
the pitfalls of having people spouting 
things as fact that aren't necessarily 

3533
02:44:35,781 --> 02:44:36,380
factual

3534
02:44:36,660 --> 02:44:40,100
and you know what?
I know a lot about nutrition and science

3535
02:44:40,101 --> 02:44:40,580
and there is a

3536
02:44:40,850 --> 02:44:42,480
hello,
have a law that I do not know.

3537
02:44:42,510 --> 02:44:44,050
Well,
I love that you're honest about it.

3538
02:44:44,060 --> 02:44:47,040
Know like when I asked you about amino 
acids in India,

3539
02:44:47,041 --> 02:44:48,960
taking them without water,
you're right away.

3540
02:44:48,961 --> 02:44:51,000
I don't know,
but that's great.

3541
02:44:51,180 --> 02:44:54,140
That's how the world should be.
The guys like Dave Asprey,

3542
02:44:54,141 --> 02:44:59,141
you ask them,
they come up with a fucking answer 

3543
02:44:59,141 --> 02:45:00,921
because they don't want to look stupid 
and that answer might be a wise was 

3544
02:45:00,921 --> 02:45:01,410
coffee bitter mycotoxins.
Are you fucking sure?

3545
02:45:01,880 --> 02:45:04,740
Where's your task that show Mycotoxins,
make coffee bitter.

3546
02:45:04,920 --> 02:45:07,440
You don't have anything man.
You gotTa stop doing that.

3547
02:45:07,820 --> 02:45:10,080
You've got to stop.
You're confusing the fuck out of me.

3548
02:45:10,170 --> 02:45:15,170
And then I parrot what you're saying.
I confused the fuck out of a bunch of 

3549
02:45:15,170 --> 02:45:15,490
people and that happens a lot.
Like I said,

3550
02:45:15,490 --> 02:45:16,320
you know,
he,

3551
02:45:16,321 --> 02:45:19,900
he also talks about the lectins and the 
beans and it's like and recall it as the

3552
02:45:19,901 --> 02:45:21,310
same thing where it's like,
you know,

3553
02:45:21,311 --> 02:45:23,200
these,
they have some good information,

3554
02:45:23,230 --> 02:45:24,190
you know,
these people have,

3555
02:45:24,191 --> 02:45:25,900
there are some good things that they 
say,

3556
02:45:26,410 --> 02:45:31,410
but there's also some information that's
totally wrong and the problem is people 

3557
02:45:31,410 --> 02:45:35,730
think because they have one good piece 
of information that everything they say 

3558
02:45:35,730 --> 02:45:36,520
is right and it's not,
you know,

3559
02:45:36,521 --> 02:45:39,610
and that's where you get this parenting 
where it's like,

3560
02:45:39,611 --> 02:45:40,750
well there's a meme now.
It's like,

3561
02:45:40,751 --> 02:45:45,751
I don't know who started it,
but someone started it and it's not 

3562
02:45:45,751 --> 02:45:45,751
accurate.
Right.

3563
02:45:45,751 --> 02:45:49,140
They didn't dig deep enough.
They don't understand enough of the 

3564
02:45:49,140 --> 02:45:51,451
science behind it.
And so then you get everyone following 

3565
02:45:51,451 --> 02:45:51,451
this,
this big following and it's like,

3566
02:45:51,790 --> 02:45:54,010
you know,
like how do you come in and say,

3567
02:45:54,011 --> 02:45:55,870
okay look,
this is how it's really happening.

3568
02:45:55,871 --> 02:46:00,871
And that's kind of what I'm trying to do
in some degree it's not easy and I'm 

3569
02:46:01,541 --> 02:46:04,120
doing it in my spare time because I'm 
also still doing research.

3570
02:46:04,480 --> 02:46:09,480
So I'm like,
on weekends I'm like writing articles 

3571
02:46:09,480 --> 02:46:09,860
and making videos instead of going out 
and the bay area,

3572
02:46:09,861 --> 02:46:11,840
you know,
but I freaking love doing it.

3573
02:46:11,841 --> 02:46:12,230
So.

3574
02:46:12,290 --> 02:46:14,180
Well listen,
I've really enjoyed this conversation.

3575
02:46:14,181 --> 02:46:19,181
I think you've opened up a lot of 
people's eyes and you've educated a lot 

3576
02:46:19,181 --> 02:46:19,280
of people and provide a lot of 
information.

3577
02:46:19,281 --> 02:46:24,281
Almost too much information is.
I'm definitely seeing people writing 

3578
02:46:24,281 --> 02:46:25,400
down all these different things in 
googling all these different things that

3579
02:46:25,401 --> 02:46:30,401
you've said,
but I think we could have this 

3580
02:46:30,401 --> 02:46:30,401
conversation 100 times.
I really do.

3581
02:46:30,401 --> 02:46:31,910
And if you ever want to come on again,
I would love to have that again and tell

3582
02:46:31,911 --> 02:46:33,100
people what,
you know,

3583
02:46:33,440 --> 02:46:35,180
your videos,
where can they find them

3584
02:46:35,590 --> 02:46:39,400
tube.
So if you go to my page,

3585
02:46:39,401 --> 02:46:44,401
found my fitness.com
and really just kind of ski down the 

3586
02:46:44,401 --> 02:46:44,401
social media slopes,
you know,

3587
02:46:44,401 --> 02:46:46,390
I've got really there's three ways 
people can help me.

3588
02:46:46,510 --> 02:46:51,510
One is by,
by subscribing to my podcast or my 

3589
02:46:51,510 --> 02:46:54,451
itunes and my youtube channel to really 
help me keep going and also at found my 

3590
02:46:55,841 --> 02:46:57,520
fitness,
my podcast,

3591
02:46:57,521 --> 02:46:59,530
the name of the podcast.
That's the name of my,

3592
02:46:59,531 --> 02:47:01,420
that's my twitter name,
that's the name of my podcast.

3593
02:47:01,580 --> 02:47:04,450
I also have a patrion campaign they 
could help me with.

3594
02:47:04,840 --> 02:47:06,940
That's kind of like a kickstarter,
but it's,

3595
02:47:07,060 --> 02:47:12,060
you can contribute like twenty five 
cents a month and that's to help me pay 

3596
02:47:12,060 --> 02:47:14,701
for my podcasting,
like to host my podcasting and it's 

3597
02:47:14,701 --> 02:47:18,211
really just to help me continue doing 
what I'm doing like on weekends and in 

3598
02:47:18,211 --> 02:47:19,580
my free time.
Um,

3599
02:47:19,620 --> 02:47:21,610
and lastly is signing up for my 
newsletter.

3600
02:47:21,611 --> 02:47:26,611
I know that's not that cool these days,
but I actually put a lot of good 

3601
02:47:26,611 --> 02:47:26,611
information.
My newsletter,

3602
02:47:26,611 --> 02:47:27,790
I'm going to put it this link to this 
new study on,

3603
02:47:28,090 --> 02:47:33,090
on the sauna that I was talking about 
that it's coming out in a couple of 

3604
02:47:33,090 --> 02:47:33,090
weeks.
That's awesome.

3605
02:47:33,090 --> 02:47:36,570
Yeah.
So I would love to come back and talk 

3606
02:47:36,570 --> 02:47:36,570
about,
you know,

3607
02:47:36,570 --> 02:47:39,991
absolutely everything and this paper on 
Serotonin's coming out and a couple of 

3608
02:47:39,991 --> 02:47:40,000
weeks,
actually six days.

3609
02:47:40,180 --> 02:47:42,580
So look for that and I'll probably send 
you a link going.

3610
02:47:42,600 --> 02:47:42,730
Okay,

3611
02:47:42,950 --> 02:47:44,930
send me anything.
I'd be happy to tweet it.

3612
02:47:44,931 --> 02:47:49,931
It's so important to me to have people 
like yourself that are actual experts 

3613
02:47:49,931 --> 02:47:54,251
with legitimate credentials that can 
separate and clear the fog on a lot of 

3614
02:47:54,251 --> 02:47:55,910
these issues and I'm,
I'm,

3615
02:47:55,911 --> 02:48:00,911
I'm fucking not tolerating this anymore.
If someone comes in and they have all 

3616
02:48:00,911 --> 02:48:05,051
these clams,
they don't have information to back up 

3617
02:48:05,051 --> 02:48:05,051
the clients.
I'm just going to fucking keep.

3618
02:48:05,051 --> 02:48:05,770
Hit me up anytime we have a question.
I will.

3619
02:48:05,771 --> 02:48:10,771
I will dig into it.
Like I'm going to look into some of the 

3620
02:48:10,771 --> 02:48:10,771
stuff you talked about today that I 
didn't know about.

3621
02:48:10,771 --> 02:48:10,771
Beautiful.

3622
02:48:10,771 --> 02:48:10,771
And so,
um,

3623
02:48:10,771 --> 02:48:12,750
so thank you very much.
It's really is.

3624
02:48:12,760 --> 02:48:17,760
It's so important to have someone like 
yourself who's an expert that's willing 

3625
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:18,680
to take the time to come on a podcast 
and educate us.

3626
02:48:18,681 --> 02:48:23,681
So I really appreciate it.
So you can follow Rhonda on twitter.

3627
02:48:24,071 --> 02:48:29,071
It is found my fitness on twitter and 
that is also the name of the podcast 

3628
02:48:29,771 --> 02:48:32,470
found my fitness.
Anything else you want to say to people?

3629
02:48:32,800 --> 02:48:37,800
Yeah,
let's just what I said the three ways 

3630
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:37,800
they can help me out,
man.

3631
02:48:37,800 --> 02:48:37,800
I would really be great.
Go help her out.

3632
02:48:37,880 --> 02:48:42,880
Help her out.
This was a hugely entertaining and 

3633
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:42,880
educational podcasts.
You're really good at this.

3634
02:48:42,880 --> 02:48:45,100
You should have your own podcast.
Oh,

3635
02:48:45,101 --> 02:48:50,101
you do.
It's found my fitness and it's on
