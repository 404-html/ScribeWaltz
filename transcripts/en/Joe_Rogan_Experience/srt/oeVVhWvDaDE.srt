1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,680
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,010
I was listening to this thing.

3
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:05,850
It was a talk once that
this guy was giving about,

4
00:00:05,851 --> 00:00:06,600
um,

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:06,841
uh,

6
00:00:06,841 --> 00:00:10,170
all sorts of different psychological
disorders in one of them was a theory that

7
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,600
they had had at one point
in time about schizophrenia,

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,040
schizophrenia being,

9
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,903
um,

10
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,150
having something to do
with smells and that

11
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:19,920
will,

12
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
that you give off certain that it's a
form for mono will issue that you give off

13
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:28,470
a certain smell and then people
respond to that smell and they go,

14
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:28,621
oh,

15
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:29,520
this guy's weird.

16
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,480
And then you go,

17
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:30,931
wow,

18
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,890
I'm fucking weird.

19
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:34,950
And then it starts this chain
reaction that makes you weird,

20
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,970
that makes you yourself
pheromones upset someone else.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,271
Yeah.

22
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:39,841
Because your,

23
00:00:39,841 --> 00:00:44,490
your reality becomes defined by people
avoiding you and freaking out by you and

24
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:47,690
you can get kind of crazy
because of the successive right.

25
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,050
People even more secure in who they are.

26
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:49,890
Whoa,

27
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,330
look at you fucking take that.

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:51,781
Hey,

29
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,230
we all,

30
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,730
we all start from different places.

31
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:54,180
Allows us,

32
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,120
last year some people had shitty homes
without organized parents like you.

33
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,170
I,

34
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,003
fair enough.

35
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,940
I think the schizophrenia,

36
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,500
I think the pheromone thing is huge.

37
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,671
I have dated,

38
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:03,870
I did remember dating someone.

39
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,640
We didn't really have anything in common,

40
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:09,200
but we couldn't stop
smelling each other well,

41
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,930
went to a bar and I just buried my
face in his neck and I just like,

42
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:13,501
I can't stop.

43
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,280
There was something,

44
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,470
some people just smell
like home for some reason.

45
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,641
Not necessarily your home,

46
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,410
but like you get a very
comfortable feeling.

47
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,603
He's turned out to be,

48
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:21,360
you know,

49
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:21,990
a nightmare.

50
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,110
But the,

51
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,570
on a pheromone level,

52
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,320
it was so,

53
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,173
he was a nightmare.

54
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,040
Nightmare psychologically.

55
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,821
I mean it was,

56
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:31,170
we just didn't work out and that's fine,

57
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,000
but I remember just sitting
there and I was just like,

58
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:34,440
I cannot stop doing this.

59
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,860
Was He the nightmare where you uh,

60
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,651
we'll talk about off the air.

61
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:38,484
It was definitely,

62
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,540
it's definitely not me.

63
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,180
I don't want to say what it was because
I wasn't listening to happens to know

64
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:42,630
and we'll be like,

65
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,410
I know that was right.

66
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:44,611
Right,

67
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:44,880
right.

68
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,800
I will share with you a
story if you want to please,

69
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:47,634
please.

70
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,740
Because this is failing everything.

71
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:51,990
And I share this for the first time in
Tampa this weekend and I hadn't told the

72
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:53,280
scoot on up to the microphone,

73
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:54,114
let us know.

74
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,613
Um,

75
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,061
I,

76
00:01:57,061 --> 00:01:58,500
this is just a quick
not wearing headphones.

77
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:59,490
That's why I'm letting people know,

78
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,470
like when you move away,

79
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:03,120
left and to the right of these things,

80
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,350
it changes the volume.

81
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,390
Do you think it really matters
if you put it left to right?

82
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:06,471
Like,

83
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:06,870
no,

84
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,703
that doesn't matter.

85
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,860
But if we look looking for blanche,

86
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,850
I was looking for the volume.

87
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,690
It's up here.

88
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,110
Oh,

89
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:13,710
that's fine.

90
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,850
Next to the salt.

91
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,350
That is a salt rock.

92
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,963
We're hippies here.

93
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,691
We have,

94
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:19,110
um,

95
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,410
look,

96
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,880
I have a lava lamps.

97
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,703
Salt rocks.

98
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,280
Yeah.

99
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,113
Jimi Hendrix.

100
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,850
I couldn't eat looking
at the Predator thing,

101
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,160
like if I had a sandwich or won't
be able to look at that and eat,

102
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,023
it grosses me out.

103
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,410
It's just a mask.

104
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:35,220
Halloween costumes gross me out with
the smell of latex and that's actually

105
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:35,760
hard.

106
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,401
That's like a,

107
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:39,540
a model that was made by special
effects guy was looking at,

108
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,440
cause he's so scary,

109
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:42,120
but like that thing couldn't eat you.

110
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,550
Uh,

111
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:44,383
you short could,

112
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:45,843
it would rip you apart.

113
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,400
It's small now.

114
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,620
Yeah.

115
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,790
But it would chew chunks of you.

116
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,120
Let's,

117
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,240
and those other things act as teeth
to just pulls hunks of meat off you.

118
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,570
But it depends on how
it can articulate it.

119
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,500
Just trying to make them human.

120
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,430
I think he would appreciate that.

121
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:57,600
Okay.

122
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,781
Okay.

123
00:02:57,781 --> 00:02:59,070
So here's my story please.

124
00:02:59,410 --> 00:02:59,591
Okay.

125
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:00,970
Cause we were talking about
relationship at the beginning.

126
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,740
So I went through a breakup
like a month and a half ago,

127
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,610
maybe two months ago.

128
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,450
I feel like you'll have you of all
people were appreciate the story and I'll

129
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,560
give you the abridged version.

130
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,610
Um,

131
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:12,720
me,

132
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,553
the juicy details.

133
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:16,480
So basically I met this guy a year,

134
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,410
two years,

135
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:18,131
not this thanksgiving,

136
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,990
the last one on the plane.

137
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,440
And we hit it off and he told me his
name and he said he went to Yale and he

138
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,240
worked in,

139
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:28,571
we'll say,

140
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:28,661
well,

141
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,471
he worked in finances,

142
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,304
we'll just leave it at that.

143
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,990
And so I knew him for a year,

144
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,400
never wanted to date him.

145
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,650
And eventually we dated,

146
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,480
we dated for for three months.

147
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,340
And during the time we were dating,

148
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,480
um,

149
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,440
before we'd started dating,

150
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:44,320
he told me he bought a house and I
never wanted to see the house because I

151
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,051
whatever,

152
00:03:45,051 --> 00:03:45,671
it wasn't dating him,

153
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:46,504
I didn't care.

154
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,580
So we start dating and the
whole time we're dating,

155
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,930
things start getting weird.

156
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,360
Like we get along perfectly,

157
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:55,750
but there are certain aspects of his
personal life that are like not checking

158
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,584
out.

159
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,930
Like I told my mom,

160
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,261
I was like,

161
00:03:59,261 --> 00:03:59,650
Oh hey,

162
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,210
this is his name and
this is where he works.

163
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,100
So she googled him because
that's what moms do.

164
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,030
And his work bio says
that he graduated from,

165
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,360
uh,

166
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,830
from a different college,

167
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,550
not he's anyone to Yale is
that he'd graduates around.

168
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,071
So I call him,

169
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:12,281
I'm like,

170
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:12,881
why does it say that?

171
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:13,121
He's like,

172
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:13,954
Oh my God,

173
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,880
they've cut and pasted the wrong bio.

174
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:16,481
It's a mess up.

175
00:04:16,481 --> 00:04:17,291
My company's a mess.

176
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:17,501
I'm like,

177
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:17,861
okay,

178
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:18,341
I get wrong.

179
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,151
Bio's all the time.

180
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:20,080
Like I totally get it.

181
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:20,711
And I was like,

182
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,670
I want to send you a present.

183
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,660
What's your address?

184
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:23,351
He was like,

185
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:23,411
oh,

186
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:24,370
just send it to my work.

187
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,241
And I was like,

188
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:25,391
no,

189
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,380
I want to send it to your house.

190
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,000
So he gives me this address.

191
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:29,710
So I sent him a gift and he gets it.

192
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,360
And then one day I'm out
with my friend Laura,

193
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,300
we're at lunch and we start to build a
case about why we think this guy is a

194
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:37,600
liar as a joke at first
cause nothing's checking out.

195
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,441
So Laura's like,

196
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,460
let's drive by his house.

197
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,400
And I remember what the house looked
like from the picture he'd sent me,

198
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,140
cause like six months
before we were dating,

199
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:44,621
he was like,

200
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:45,640
check out this house that I bought.

201
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,770
So we go to the house
and it's not a house,

202
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:48,604
it's an apartment.

203
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,480
And Laura goes up to the door and she's
like looking in and all of a sudden the

204
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,880
girl opens the door and I'm just,

205
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,050
I'm just,

206
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,880
I was paralyzed and the girl looks at me,

207
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,714
she goes,

208
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,081
she was like,

209
00:04:59,081 --> 00:04:59,201
hi,

210
00:04:59,201 --> 00:04:59,890
can I help you guys?

211
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,191
And we're like,

212
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,281
oh,

213
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,800
we're just looking for
the guy we're looking for.

214
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:03,340
And she was like,

215
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:03,401
Oh,

216
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:04,151
you're Eliza.

217
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:04,900
And I was like,

218
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,111
fuck,

219
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:06,190
do you know who I am?

220
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,030
And she was like,

221
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,361
Oh,

222
00:05:07,361 --> 00:05:08,290
I'm his roommate.

223
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,760
And I was like,

224
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,211
okay,

225
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:10,991
well that's fine.

226
00:05:10,991 --> 00:05:12,040
Like I'm just not a cheating thing.

227
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:12,431
But I was like,

228
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:14,140
so I call him and I'm like,

229
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:14,831
why do you have a roommate?

230
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:15,251
And he goes,

231
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:15,980
well,

232
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,813
um,

233
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:21,640
my mom is sick and she moved to La
and she lives at my house and I,

234
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,270
I,

235
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,670
she lives there and I live with
my friend to give my mom privacy.

236
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:25,541
And I was like,

237
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:25,811
all right,

238
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:26,441
well that's weird.

239
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:29,170
But like I still want
to know where you live.

240
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,533
Oh God,

241
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,770
this guy should just change his
number and run away from you.

242
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:32,951
Oh,

243
00:05:32,951 --> 00:05:33,401
it gets better.

244
00:05:33,401 --> 00:05:33,940
Yeah.

245
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,773
So,

246
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,051
okay.

247
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:35,771
So it was like,

248
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:35,951
all right,

249
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:38,500
so I let it go and when we're together,

250
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:39,240
everything's great.

251
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,460
Like,

252
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,060
perfect.

253
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,410
You're not thinking about it at all.

254
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,670
Well that part I was like,

255
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:43,504
okay,

256
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:44,830
his mom has cancer.

257
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,873
That's when he told me,

258
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:46,601
and he's like,

259
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:47,500
she's wants privacy.

260
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:47,801
So I'm like,

261
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:48,071
okay.

262
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:51,040
And I fell in love with him in the first
place because he told me she had cancer

263
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:51,640
and I got,

264
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,840
I wanted to take care of him.

265
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,550
And like that really like
tugged on my heartstrings.

266
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:55,661
So I was like,

267
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:56,020
okay.

268
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:59,090
I met them on once and every
single time after I met her once,

269
00:05:59,091 --> 00:06:02,060
like the first week we started dating
and every time after that I'd be like,

270
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:02,690
let me take,

271
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,261
if you're at work,

272
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm like,

273
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,161
I've got free time.

274
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,030
Let me take your mom to lunch.

275
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,050
Let me take your mom to the movies.

276
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,190
Can we go to like anything?

277
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,900
Could never make it happen.

278
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,520
Let's go to brunch with your mom.

279
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,181
Let me do something.

280
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,080
Let me take her somewhere.

281
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,220
No one you met the mom.

282
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:15,530
Did her illness ever
come up in conversation?

283
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,360
Because I thought that would
be tactless for me to be like,

284
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:19,700
how's your cancer if she brought it up,

285
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,610
she brought her up.

286
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:21,441
No,

287
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,070
nothing.

288
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,310
They came with me to the craft store.

289
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:24,500
I had to buy stuff for Christmas party.

290
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,580
Um,

291
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,413
we didn't say much,

292
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,650
but I never,

293
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,150
so weeks are going by and I'm like,

294
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,201
I just want to hang out.

295
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,190
Like if you love me.

296
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,750
And he always talked
about getting married,

297
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:33,111
stuff like that.

298
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:33,291
I'm like,

299
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,150
I should probably meet
this woman more than once.

300
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,250
So he gives me,

301
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:38,420
so I go to that.

302
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:38,751
So it's not,

303
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:39,584
it's I call him and he's like,

304
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,070
uh,

305
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,060
my mom is living alone.

306
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:42,080
I intend to give her privacy.

307
00:06:42,081 --> 00:06:42,381
And I was like,

308
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:42,531
okay,

309
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:43,364
that's fine,

310
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,900
but you need to tell me where you live.

311
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,580
You gave me that and I was like,

312
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,211
why are you being weird?

313
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,940
You gave me the address like six
months ago before we were dating.

314
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,523
And he was like,

315
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:52,670
um,

316
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:53,350
I,

317
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:53,540
uh,

318
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,110
he is your guy.

319
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:54,441
He's like,

320
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:55,070
I just,

321
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,370
I,

322
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,450
my mom's asked for privacy.

323
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,261
I'm just trying to give that to her.

324
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:57,921
He kept saying that,

325
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:58,281
so I'm like,

326
00:06:58,281 --> 00:06:58,910
all right.

327
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,451
So finally,

328
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,081
eventually he goes,

329
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,100
here's the address and he gives me,

330
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:02,660
this address is five to five Kilkia.

331
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,381
So I'm like,

332
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:03,680
all right,

333
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,513
that's not the real addresses.

334
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,470
So I have this address.

335
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:06,741
I'm like,

336
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:07,400
okay.

337
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,791
Thinking,

338
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:07,971
wow,

339
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:09,020
that took a lot for you to give.

340
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:09,854
That to me,

341
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,350
like this is clearly like an issue
in everyone's got their boundaries,

342
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,340
everyone's got their baggage,

343
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:15,200
and I was trying to be respectful of that.

344
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,580
A couple of weeks go by,

345
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,040
my mom calls the yells registered,

346
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,251
you know,

347
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,780
registrar's office because
it's such a me out,

348
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,780
no record of this guy ever graduating.

349
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,060
Oh your mom's awesome as everybody says.

350
00:07:26,061 --> 00:07:27,170
So I call him and I'm like,

351
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,360
and I'm trying to be cool
about it because again,

352
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:32,810
like this is someone that I love and we
traveled together and you don't want to

353
00:07:32,811 --> 00:07:33,644
push it.

354
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,400
And he's like,

355
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,330
I don't know.

356
00:07:35,331 --> 00:07:37,130
I was only on campus
for this amount of time,

357
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:37,420
did it.

358
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,000
Ah,

359
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,690
he'd already invited me to go to England
with him for a skull and bones reunion,

360
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,281
like a whole thing.

361
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:43,521
And we,

362
00:07:43,521 --> 00:07:45,140
it got cancelled because
his mom had cancer.

363
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:45,651
So like,

364
00:07:45,651 --> 00:07:46,670
I'm like letting all this go.

365
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,200
So he goes out of town,

366
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,720
I go to five to five cookies,

367
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,520
it doesn't exist.

368
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,060
So I call him and I'm like,

369
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,950
what are you fucking doing?

370
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:00,690
And he goes and he launching a store.

371
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:00,891
He goes,

372
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:02,630
when I lived in the city
he lived in before he goes,

373
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:03,770
I had this crazy ex girlfriend,

374
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:04,940
everyone's got a crazy ex.

375
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:05,721
He was like,

376
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:10,040
and basically she wreak havoc on my
social life and my personal life with my

377
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,510
family and I'm just
very protective of that.

378
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:14,240
And my mom's sick and I'm just
trying to like keep her out of that.

379
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,621
So I was like,

380
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,454
okay.

381
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:16,881
And I was like,

382
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:17,870
you need to give me your address.

383
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:19,580
This is the last time I'm
going to ask you for this.

384
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,410
And I'm trying not to like push something.

385
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:21,951
So he comes over,

386
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:23,060
he gives me the address,

387
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,230
his mom's number and his email.

388
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:24,620
He's like,

389
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,341
I'm an open book,

390
00:08:25,341 --> 00:08:26,210
whatever you want to know.

391
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,100
So I took that as a sign of like,

392
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:28,341
wow,

393
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,480
that was really hard for you.

394
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:31,760
Gail registrar comes back,

395
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,200
no record of him.

396
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,070
Uh,

397
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,990
none of my friends that
went to Yale know who he is.

398
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,000
And every time I ask him anything,

399
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:39,260
like the answer is super simple.

400
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,100
Like if I asked you where you live,

401
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:41,570
you just tell me to just
roll off your tongue.

402
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,180
And that's everything was
so I go to that house,

403
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,410
like I let a couple of weeks go by.

404
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:46,490
My birthday happens.

405
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:47,091
We had Christmas,

406
00:08:47,091 --> 00:08:47,924
my birthday,

407
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,740
and it's a day before I'm leaving for
San Antonio to go to play this comedy

408
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:52,070
club,

409
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,150
and I go to his house and my friend,

410
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,590
and it's not his house,

411
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:56,730
it's like some other woman lives.

412
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:57,810
They're like an old woman lives there.

413
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,280
It's not as mom's house.

414
00:08:59,281 --> 00:09:00,480
And he sees like my mom,

415
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,180
he's like you.

416
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,540
My mom bought the house from
me to keep my cash liquid.

417
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,530
The title's not in her name.

418
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,420
I call him and I was like,

419
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,130
I'm walking out of your life because
you're lying about something.

420
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:14,100
And it all came crashing
down at 7:00 AM he texts me,

421
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:14,880
he goes,

422
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,713
I never went to Yale.

423
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,950
I never bought a house.

424
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,080
I've been lying to you for over a year.

425
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,560
And so it was just one of those like,

426
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,760
and then so you start going back and
then you start wondering if you're crazy

427
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:27,661
and then you're like,

428
00:09:27,661 --> 00:09:29,880
does your mom even if cancer did you,

429
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,650
are you really in the small of cancer?

430
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,270
I'm going to say she does,

431
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,470
but I think it's really weird that I
met her once and then like I was like,

432
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:39,720
what's the name of the doctor
at the hospital where she is?

433
00:09:39,721 --> 00:09:39,961
He's like,

434
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:40,794
I don't know,

435
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,140
like very like wouldn't
give any information.

436
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,003
This is,

437
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,620
and so yesterday I wrote an email,

438
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:47,610
I don't know why I'm sharing all of this,

439
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:48,690
but this is very funny to me.

440
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:49,861
I wrote everybody,

441
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:50,970
when you break up with someone,

442
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,860
depending on how tactful you are,

443
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,280
you hold back on what you want to say.

444
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:56,941
Like we all say,

445
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:57,140
look,

446
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,631
you're an asshole.

447
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:58,050
I hate you.

448
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,150
But like then there's like the
dark shit that you don't write.

449
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,640
And I wrote an email that I almost,

450
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,150
I won't do it,

451
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:07,260
but I almost want to post online as like
a template for any girl that ever wants

452
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,060
to like enraged her next boyfriend.

453
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,940
And I just lost my shit
and it felt so good.

454
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:12,901
Like fuck.

455
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:13,734
Having tact.

456
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,660
Like it just was the best thing ever.

457
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,670
Well it sounds like you
gave him every possible,

458
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,510
every possible scenario
for him to be truthful.

459
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,900
Like you gave him every possible like,

460
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:32,930
well maybe he's this and maybe it's that
you gave a lot of leeway so much so and

461
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:34,471
then every day I'd be like,

462
00:10:34,471 --> 00:10:34,981
if you're lying,

463
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,530
please just tell me or just tell anyone
to look me in the eye and be like,

464
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,364
I'm not lying.

465
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:41,550
Which makes me think if we ever got
married we would go on a boat and he would

466
00:10:41,551 --> 00:10:42,360
kill me.

467
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,350
But the whole never know.

468
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:43,680
Right.

469
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,240
You never know how that shit happens.

470
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:49,080
You find out he's got a life insurance
policy on you and I and I accidentally

471
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:49,650
signed it.

472
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,940
Did you find out where he worked?

473
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,440
Did he actually have the job that he had?

474
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:54,390
He had left the company and
all of these things are weird.

475
00:10:54,391 --> 00:10:58,110
Like he left the company and like a
weird way and he started his own so that

476
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,680
like I just at some point it's not up
to you to piece together what's real and

477
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:02,490
what isn't.

478
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,980
I told this story on the radio in
Tampa and when I got off the air,

479
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,690
all of these people that sent me tweets
with Hashtag Yale and somebody sent me a

480
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:12,330
picture of someone running the Boston
marathon in a Yale shirt and they're like,

481
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:14,220
is your ex boyfriend
running the Boston marathon?

482
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,710
Oh the poor bastard.

483
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,860
I'm glad you don't say his name publicly
shame him because the poor fuck is

484
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:20,640
already a mess.

485
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,750
I told him he's fucking lucky.

486
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:23,730
I'm like you're I think on
that show I did but I didn't.

487
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
I've never say the last name.

488
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,780
Well he is lucky you could make them a
part of your act with his actual name.

489
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:32,590
It's so little bit.

490
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,780
If I could think of unrelatable the
whole like that amount of lying,

491
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,460
like cheating is one thing I thought
meant you meant like as a bit right.

492
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,140
I think it's very relatable.

493
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,250
I think I will get around to it.

494
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,170
I think eventually it'll stop.

495
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:48,000
I'll stop being cause I'm not sad anymore,

496
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:52,820
but my email pretty much included cause
like obviously you know if you break up

497
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:55,070
with someone don't want to hear
about people are sleeping with right.

498
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,810
He got upset because I posted a picture
when I was in Saint Martin of Mian

499
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,140
Topless beach with two friends in
front of me so he can't see anything.

500
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:02,981
And he was like,

501
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:05,350
I felt that you posted that
picture and it was directed at me,

502
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,450
which it wasn't like I
posted it like a hot picture.

503
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,120
And so I just unleashed on
this email and I was like,

504
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,140
it's none of your fucking business.

505
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:11,621
What I do.

506
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:12,101
And by the way,

507
00:12:12,101 --> 00:12:12,940
when I was in Saint Martin,

508
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,210
I hooked up with a guy and he went down
on me for 20 minutes and it was fucking

509
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,073
awesome.

510
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,590
I will never talk to him.

511
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,650
Whoa,

512
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,120
that's dark.

513
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,953
It felt so good.

514
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,030
Oh that makes you cringe.

515
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:29,260
But the idea of the act
doesn't make me cringe at all.

516
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:31,640
The writing that email and say,

517
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,500
oh look,

518
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,311
that was a guy and he went down.

519
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,144
He ate my pussy.

520
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,890
I didn't say anything.

521
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:37,090
Same thing you said it.

522
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,170
Here's the question though.

523
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,250
At what point are you as a human being
allowed to just unleash and be like,

524
00:12:42,251 --> 00:12:43,084
that's it.

525
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,233
This,

526
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,381
honestly,

527
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:47,120
I don't think that
guy's worth your effort,

528
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:47,930
you know,

529
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,570
making more tension with him.

530
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:50,920
I mean,

531
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,200
that's a crazy person that
guys fabricating in existence.

532
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,680
He fabricated as education.

533
00:12:55,681 --> 00:12:56,300
He fabric.

534
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,760
He may have fabricated
his mother being sick.

535
00:12:58,761 --> 00:13:02,510
He fabricated where he
lived twice or three times.

536
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,583
Three times.

537
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:03,980
Yeah.

538
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,813
I mean he's,

539
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,490
he's probably pathological.

540
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:07,971
You know,

541
00:13:07,971 --> 00:13:10,010
there are people that
just can't stop lying.

542
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:10,731
You know,

543
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:11,930
I've seen it before.

544
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,230
When you're living in Hollywood,

545
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:15,501
you know,

546
00:13:15,501 --> 00:13:16,580
if you live around here,

547
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:16,880
you,

548
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,230
you'll meet people that are,

549
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:18,680
you know,

550
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,800
fake it til you make it type people that
will tell you stories that just don't

551
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,730
add up.

552
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,330
And in the old days used to just have to
kind of accept people at those stories.

553
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,660
But now your mom can just Google
them and find out anything

554
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,480
thing and she got on it.

555
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,071
Wow.

556
00:13:34,071 --> 00:13:35,000
Your mom's awesome.

557
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:35,720
Good for her.

558
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,553
Well,

559
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,761
let me ask you this,

560
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:38,340
cause this is,

561
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,173
um,

562
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,850
this is the difference between a man and
a woman because you could tell me that

563
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:48,380
you went to pierce college or you went
to a high school and you dropped out when

564
00:13:48,381 --> 00:13:49,370
you're 16,

565
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,480
and if you're,

566
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:51,800
you and I like you,

567
00:13:51,801 --> 00:13:52,760
I don't care at all.

568
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,080
It doesn't mean anything to me.

569
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,940
I don't care if you a nurse,

570
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,560
I don't care if you're a doctor.

571
00:13:57,561 --> 00:14:01,940
I don't care if you're a brain surgeon
or a girl who works in a clothing store.

572
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,370
It doesn't matter to me if I do not care.

573
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,610
I do not care if someone's
fun and nice to be around.

574
00:14:07,611 --> 00:14:08,480
I do not care.

575
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,290
I really don't.

576
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:09,981
I never have.

577
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:10,814
I never will.

578
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,750
Um,

579
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,070
obviously it's,

580
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,150
it's a,

581
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:16,700
there's a difference
between a man and a woman,

582
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,810
like women desire men to be successful.

583
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,451
Sure.

584
00:14:21,451 --> 00:14:22,260
And that's a whole,

585
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,430
that's an illusion thing.

586
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:24,480
And that's a protective thing.

587
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:25,230
And that's,

588
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,063
I get that.

589
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,830
Obviously I don't want a
date like a homeless person.

590
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,693
Right.

591
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,810
What killed nor does,

592
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,500
nor do I,

593
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:31,771
yeah.

594
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,160
I mean,

595
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,650
I don't want someone who
can't feed themselves.

596
00:14:34,651 --> 00:14:35,484
Does.

597
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,680
You know what kills me is that those
things genuinely don't matter and he chose

598
00:14:41,431 --> 00:14:42,300
to judge me ahead of time,

599
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:46,290
or maybe he's got a chemical imbalance
from the day I met him on the plane.

600
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,124
I went to Yale.

601
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,590
Nothing wrong with lying to a
stranger or a pretty girl on a plane.

602
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:51,880
I don't care where there is
something wrong with you,

603
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:52,170
man.

604
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:52,670
There's no,

605
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,250
there's no ramifications for lying to
a stranger if you never see them again.

606
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,470
Right.

607
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,303
Okay.

608
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,371
That doesn't bother me.

609
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,450
I don't care if you own a house,

610
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,800
so it irks me.

611
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,780
It's a shame because you
lied about two things.

612
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,710
Let's say it's just too,

613
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,960
and you ruined a perfectly
good relationship.

614
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:07,790
If it's just those two
things in your insecure,

615
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,991
I didn't go to Harvard.

616
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:09,801
I'm not a road scholar.

617
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:10,880
I don't care if you went to Yale,

618
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,450
how long did you guys date for?

619
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:15,050
I knew him for over a year and
we dated for about three months.

620
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,220
And what was it about his personality
that was attracted to you?

621
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:23,120
Does a whizzer a unique
thing that you could define?

622
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:23,983
Truthfully,

623
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,700
I mean as friends,

624
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:26,534
he was very smart.

625
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,060
I,

626
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,681
I really,

627
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:29,870
for me intelligence is
a huge thing and very,

628
00:15:29,871 --> 00:15:31,220
and a little like funniest,

629
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:31,970
snobby way,

630
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,760
like a little con and I kind of
liked that and he's very smart,

631
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:35,001
very,

632
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:35,810
very smart,

633
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:36,591
a little Dorky,

634
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:37,424
very smart.

635
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,230
But when he,

636
00:15:39,231 --> 00:15:41,420
when we were friends and when
he called me and was like,

637
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:44,690
we can't go on this trip to the skull and
bones thing because my mom has cancer.

638
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:45,981
I got a chance.

639
00:15:45,981 --> 00:15:46,641
This is going to be weird.

640
00:15:46,641 --> 00:15:47,120
I don't know.

641
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,960
I think only women will relate to this
for the whole time we knew each other.

642
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,340
He put me on this pedestal,

643
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,650
always asking,

644
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,201
can you please,

645
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:54,921
can we please date?

646
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:55,581
Can I have the kids?

647
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,480
Will you be my girlfriend?

648
00:15:56,481 --> 00:15:56,901
And I were like,

649
00:15:56,901 --> 00:15:57,591
we would hang out.

650
00:15:57,591 --> 00:15:58,041
And I was like,

651
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:58,521
stop it.

652
00:15:58,521 --> 00:15:59,354
Like I'm not into this.

653
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,270
So no one wants to be on a pedestal
because there's nothing for you to do.

654
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,441
His mom had cancer.

655
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:03,770
I was like,

656
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:04,760
I can take care of you now.

657
00:16:04,761 --> 00:16:06,320
Like you've been nothing but sweet to me.

658
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,880
Now let me take care of you.

659
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:09,380
And in getting to take care of him,

660
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:13,130
I started to like him cause
I had like an active role.

661
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,390
That's so crazy.

662
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,610
Um Wow.

663
00:16:16,611 --> 00:16:17,390
That's so crazy.

664
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:17,571
But yeah,

665
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:18,740
those things didn't matter.

666
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,770
So is that like the maternal instincts
that you have is like the taking care of

667
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,850
instincts,

668
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:25,041
you know,

669
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,920
because some women have those
instincts sort of built in those?

670
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:28,401
I think so.

671
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:29,900
But I think it was also just,

672
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:34,250
there was nothing for me to do to have
an active role in our relationship as

673
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:34,641
friends.

674
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:39,350
Like he had a lot of money and a lot of
time and he could do nice things like he

675
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:39,680
would,

676
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,930
did he really have a lot of money
because you'd have a lot of money.

677
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,081
Well,

678
00:16:42,081 --> 00:16:42,741
how's that possible?

679
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:43,790
He has a fucking roommate.

680
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,141
So the roommate,

681
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:45,380
if,

682
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,460
if the answer was he goes,

683
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:46,671
I have,

684
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:47,900
my lease was up in Santa Monica.

685
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,711
I was going to buy a house.

686
00:16:48,711 --> 00:16:50,120
But then I decided I thought
it was going to move.

687
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,660
He goes again.

688
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,530
Then you and I started dating.

689
00:16:51,531 --> 00:16:52,310
I didn't wanna move.

690
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,820
I moved in with a friend to help her pay
her rent cause he's never home and he's

691
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:55,911
like,

692
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:56,960
so I just leave my stuff there,

693
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,150
but how can they even
trust that I couldn't,

694
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,960
he did send me a picture of his bank
account to like why use a human being?

695
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,771
Come on,

696
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:04,604
I didn't ask for it.

697
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,260
He sent you the numbers in his bag.

698
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,000
Can you send me like a screen grab of it?

699
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,950
This motherfucker doctored his bank.

700
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,770
He might've shot the shit
out of his bank account.

701
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,150
I,

702
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:13,460
you know,

703
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,230
I saw the way he lived in the way he,

704
00:17:15,231 --> 00:17:18,260
I mean I do think the money thing is real.

705
00:17:18,261 --> 00:17:18,651
We did,

706
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:19,520
maybe it may,

707
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,230
I may or may not have
done a background check.

708
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:24,110
So I definitely know when he came from.

709
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,873
Um,

710
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,450
but the answer your question
to the House and the,

711
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,030
the college and like he
lied about weird things.

712
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,793
What is that?

713
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,930
That's a weird thing man.

714
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,720
Like that saying you went to Yale,

715
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,910
like the Harvard,

716
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:41,744
Yale,

717
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,040
Ivy League.

718
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:43,700
Like that's like,

719
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,260
Ooh,

720
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:44,830
like,

721
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,800
like I don't,

722
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,761
and then he would sit,

723
00:17:46,761 --> 00:17:49,620
my cousin went to Yale and they would
have a conversation and he would talk

724
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,410
about it.

725
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,000
What?

726
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,833
Yeah.

727
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,040
Oh my God.

728
00:17:53,041 --> 00:17:54,460
Poor bet you're ripping paper over there.

729
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:57,800
If you hear that and
she's going crazy fucker.

730
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,290
No,

731
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:58,380
no,

732
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:58,891
not even that.

733
00:17:58,891 --> 00:17:59,611
Every time we think about it,

734
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,510
I go back and I'm like,

735
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:00,781
what?

736
00:18:00,781 --> 00:18:02,070
What clues did I miss?

737
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:02,671
What am I?

738
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:02,941
And like,

739
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:03,774
what,

740
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:05,100
what am I realizing now?

741
00:18:05,101 --> 00:18:06,760
Like I'm trying to like put the dots,

742
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,683
connect the dots.

743
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,030
The day I met him,

744
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:14,220
I went on Twitter and I followed him
and his Twitter handle hadn't had a Yale

745
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:15,054
reference in it.

746
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,321
And I asked him,

747
00:18:16,321 --> 00:18:16,441
look,

748
00:18:16,441 --> 00:18:16,861
when we broke up,

749
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:17,071
I was like,

750
00:18:17,071 --> 00:18:18,600
keeping your Twitter was about Yale.

751
00:18:18,601 --> 00:18:18,991
And he was like,

752
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:20,610
I made up my Twitter
account the day I met you.

753
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,170
Whoa.

754
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,950
Just because he met you and he wanted,

755
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,390
oh my God,

756
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:26,580
good.

757
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:26,911
He didn't,

758
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:27,481
maybe he lied.

759
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,560
Maybe change the name.

760
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:29,850
Uh,

761
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:30,300
wow.

762
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,140
What a psycho.

763
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,220
And every time I tell the story,

764
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:34,230
like I think about different
things that I've missed.

765
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,690
So Jesus Christ,

766
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:39,450
the good news is when something
that weird happens to you,

767
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,400
there's no lesson to be learned.

768
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:42,234
It's not like,

769
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,440
oh I thought he was cheating.

770
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,460
Like that's a normal thing.

771
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,980
Like this is not something I'll
take into another relationship.

772
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,720
Well you kind of do because you guys
do lie about their past to become more

773
00:18:52,971 --> 00:18:54,230
impressive to a girl.

774
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:54,741
You know?

775
00:18:54,741 --> 00:18:55,550
I mean it is really,

776
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,600
it's super common,

777
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,553
right?

778
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:02,590
And now you'll sort of recognize those
sort of bullshit signs maybe quicker.

779
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,850
Well maybe it's like when a guy throws
that out there like makes a big deal out

780
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:08,031
of it.

781
00:19:08,031 --> 00:19:09,320
Like maybe that's when you look.

782
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,483
Maybe,

783
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,840
maybe.

784
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,350
I mean some people like
it wasn't really online.

785
00:19:15,351 --> 00:19:17,530
Some people take pride in not
really being online a lot that,

786
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,383
I mean the Internet helps.

787
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,190
Like even if you can,

788
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,960
I went on a date last night and you
could Google the guy and everything about

789
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:22,041
them.

790
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,290
Is there an,

791
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,483
and you're like

792
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,000
me and this guy had no friends in common.

793
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,030
Like the email I wrote him
was so I guess so pointed.

794
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,090
We forward it to me.

795
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:35,631
I'll send it.

796
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:36,560
I'll show it to you right after this.

797
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,020
I went online and he had
deleted his Twitter account.

798
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:39,381
Like,

799
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:41,660
I think I made this
motherfucker leave cyberspace.

800
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,211
Well you should.

801
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:45,800
I mean that's for him.

802
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:49,860
It's gotta be some people just do that
over and over and over again though.

803
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:54,020
I'm my friend Eddie met
this guy and this guy,

804
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:54,913
um,

805
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,490
ah,

806
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:57,350
he was working on,

807
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,690
he wanted to put him in some project.

808
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:04,220
He was doing some television project
and he claimed that he had these studios

809
00:20:04,221 --> 00:20:07,130
and he was working with all
these networks and this and that.

810
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,800
But where we found out
that he was full of Shit,

811
00:20:09,801 --> 00:20:11,360
I thought he was full of Shit right away.

812
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,011
I told Eddie,

813
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:12,321
I like,

814
00:20:12,321 --> 00:20:13,640
I don't like the way Scott talks.

815
00:20:13,641 --> 00:20:14,780
He named jobs too much.

816
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:14,991
I go,

817
00:20:14,991 --> 00:20:15,950
I think he's a bullshitter.

818
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:19,340
I think there's a certain
thing that people do when
they bullshit when they talk

819
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:20,030
about like,

820
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,160
I've got a project going on
with Steven Spielberg and this,

821
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:24,770
there's just no fucking way Tom
Cruise is passing on the project.

822
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,551
We want to bring it to you.

823
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:26,384
Like,

824
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,080
you know,

825
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,491
you know what I mean?

826
00:20:28,491 --> 00:20:29,480
It's like one of those things.

827
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:29,811
Sure.

828
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:30,650
So I,

829
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:31,071
you know,

830
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,060
I was peripheral,

831
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:32,721
I wasn't,

832
00:20:32,721 --> 00:20:33,554
you know,

833
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,451
interacting with sky,

834
00:20:34,451 --> 00:20:35,470
but Eddie was interacting.

835
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:35,781
This guy,

836
00:20:35,781 --> 00:20:37,060
I'm like any of that guy's a bullshitter.

837
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,933
He smells,

838
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,361
I go,

839
00:20:38,361 --> 00:20:38,810
I just,

840
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:39,643
he just smells.

841
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:40,470
So,

842
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,910
um,

843
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,700
then the guy starts taking Jujitsu class.

844
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,390
Okay.

845
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,390
I mean zero experience in Jujitsu and
then calls Eddie after doing Jujitsu for

846
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:50,590
like,

847
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,011
I dunno,

848
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:51,910
like a day,

849
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,170
maybe two days and is talking
about catching people and
triangles and all these

850
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,520
different submissions that he pulled off,

851
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,130
which is never going to happen.

852
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,200
It's just not going to happen unless,

853
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:06,190
unless you're doing it with someone who's
absolutely physically and competent.

854
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,060
When you,

855
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,200
when you first start out,

856
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:09,220
you don't know what you're doing,

857
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,330
you don't learn that day one,

858
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:10,811
we'll also,

859
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:11,800
he's not a stud.

860
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:12,910
The guy wasn't like,

861
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,470
there's certain guys like
you could tell a guy,

862
00:21:14,471 --> 00:21:18,160
he's like a pro basketball player who's
just a fucking athlete and maybe he

863
00:21:18,161 --> 00:21:21,070
loves MMA and maybe he's never
taken the Jujitsu classes life.

864
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:25,000
But he's seen a few fights and if he
recognizes the position that you teach it

865
00:21:25,001 --> 00:21:25,420
to him,

866
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,620
he could maybe pull it off on someone
who sucks but it's an advanced move like

867
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:30,730
setting up a triangle,

868
00:21:30,731 --> 00:21:31,361
finishing it.

869
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:33,280
It's an advanced move
and this guy was like,

870
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,280
I got three triangles today and practice
and to armbars when we were like,

871
00:21:36,281 --> 00:21:36,611
wait,

872
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,300
what?

873
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,781
And I go,

874
00:21:37,781 --> 00:21:40,000
I told you he's a bullshitter.

875
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,140
And then he go,

876
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,840
well he did actually go to class.

877
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,570
He did not ever tap anyone ever.

878
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,310
He is physically and competent.

879
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:48,851
Like if you,

880
00:21:48,851 --> 00:21:49,780
if you see him,

881
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,860
you look at his body is like this guy
is lucky if he can brush his teeth like

882
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,230
this isn't a fucking athlete at all.

883
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,063
I mean he was just like,

884
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,630
it was a gumby.

885
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:02,140
He was a guy who essentially had never
worked out his whole life and then all of

886
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:04,180
a sudden he's claiming he's
tapping people out in Jujitsu.

887
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,580
But that was just confirmation.

888
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,911
Then ed,

889
00:22:05,911 --> 00:22:06,744
he looked into his,

890
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
his whole situation and found out the
guy was just a total complete liar and

891
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,500
broke it down with them over the phone.

892
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,880
There's another one I've got,

893
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,900
there's a guy,

894
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,230
he,

895
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,063
his name,

896
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:20,470
his real name was Ralph and he was
telling us that his name was Rafael Tori.

897
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:21,930
And um,

898
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,290
he was saying that he was
a black belt in Jujitsu,

899
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,350
but just as friends or like how did you,

900
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,970
well this guy I'm telling us.

901
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,690
Okay.

902
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,430
He was at his friend and
he was a journalist for a
mixed martial arts magazine,

903
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,930
an online magazine.

904
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,260
And so he would go to these events and uh,

905
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:39,910
and he would do,

906
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:40,571
Eddie was a,

907
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,310
one of the commentators
for the king of the cage,

908
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:44,170
which is a smaller mixed martial arts,

909
00:22:44,171 --> 00:22:44,460
uh,

910
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,140
organization familiar with are,

911
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,063
you know,

912
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,280
and uh,

913
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:48,850
anyway,

914
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,850
Rafael Tory actually had a fake fight.

915
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,570
I mean he,

916
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,430
he said that he was a
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

917
00:22:54,431 --> 00:22:55,600
He was not at all.

918
00:22:55,601 --> 00:22:56,500
Eddie rolled with them.

919
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,820
And Eddie is a black belt.

920
00:22:57,821 --> 00:22:58,361
And at the time,

921
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,171
I don't think Getty was a black,

922
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,570
but I think Eddie was a brown
belt and then he just smashed him,

923
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:02,590
just tapped him left and right.

924
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,180
And he was like confused.

925
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:04,511
He was like,

926
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:04,631
well,

927
00:23:04,631 --> 00:23:05,100
maybe they didn't.

928
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,400
Maybe it wasn't really trying.

929
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,620
Like I don't get it because
he was a bigger guy too.

930
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,930
It was like way too easy
for Eddie to tap them.

931
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,811
So Eddie there,

932
00:23:11,811 --> 00:23:14,770
there was a few like red
flags that popped up there.

933
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:15,670
Anyway,

934
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,870
long story short,

935
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,520
the guy never digits before it was
a complete fake would disappear.

936
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,570
And here's a good one.

937
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,560
Went away.

938
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,230
Okay.

939
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,780
Told his friend to drop him off.

940
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,090
Like pulled up to this a wooded area,

941
00:23:28,091 --> 00:23:29,050
told his friend to drop off.

942
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,280
He had a duffle bag with them,

943
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,870
filled with some shit.

944
00:23:31,871 --> 00:23:32,350
Right?

945
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,150
He says,

946
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,030
drop me off here.

947
00:23:34,031 --> 00:23:35,350
I'm going to fight in this,

948
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:35,710
uh,

949
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,550
no rules.

950
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:39,400
Karate tournament out in the woods and uh,

951
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,780
I'll be back in two days.

952
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:41,651
Okay.

953
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:45,170
So his friend comes back in two days
and now he doesn't have the duffle bag

954
00:23:45,171 --> 00:23:45,400
anymore.

955
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,830
Buddy has a trophy that's the same
size as the fucking duffle bag.

956
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:49,121
And he said,

957
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:49,420
God,

958
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:51,890
I won this no rules karate tournament.

959
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:52,420
I mean,

960
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,211
and everybody's like,

961
00:23:53,211 --> 00:23:53,601
wait,

962
00:23:53,601 --> 00:23:54,434
what the fuck?

963
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:55,100
Okay,

964
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,910
so the guy completely made up is martial
arts background completely made up.

965
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,140
He also went to Thailand for a
fight and got a guy in a twister.

966
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:08,390
A twister is a very complex move that
involves not just getting on top of Oh

967
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:09,191
God,

968
00:24:09,191 --> 00:24:11,300
but getting on top of guy inside control,

969
00:24:11,301 --> 00:24:15,970
lacing one leg with your two
legs rolling on your shoulders.

970
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:17,120
So you go behind him,

971
00:24:17,121 --> 00:24:17,954
take his bath,

972
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,150
you wrap his arm around your head,

973
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,910
grab his head and Torque his spine.

974
00:24:22,911 --> 00:24:25,280
It's an incredibly complex maneuver.

975
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,770
This guy had just learned it and he
started pulling it off on people in,

976
00:24:28,771 --> 00:24:30,500
in a fucking no holds barred fight.

977
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:31,940
So there was all these things.

978
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:32,631
So Eddie,

979
00:24:32,631 --> 00:24:33,950
Eddie cuts the guy off and he's like,

980
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:34,784
listen man,

981
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,840
you're bullshit artists.

982
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:36,920
I know you're full of shit.

983
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,210
You're not a fucking black belt.

984
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:40,550
You're not fighting in
these fucking fights.

985
00:24:40,551 --> 00:24:41,570
He's wanting to be near it.

986
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:41,840
Yeah,

987
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,141
he goes,

988
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:43,160
I know that your fight.

989
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,640
But Eddie had been friends with this
guy for months and months and months and

990
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,450
just slowly piled on the bullshit,

991
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:47,871
you know,

992
00:24:47,871 --> 00:24:49,520
just not trying to investigate a guy,

993
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,050
just thinking he's a cool guy.

994
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:53,060
He was already in the mix
before Eddie got there.

995
00:24:53,061 --> 00:24:55,700
He was already deepen with
these mixed martial arts guy.

996
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,620
So he just assumed that a guy's legit.

997
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,140
Turns out as the time goes on,

998
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,510
he murdered a guy,

999
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,000
murdered a guy who was married
to a girl that he was fucking,

1000
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:14,150
he got close to the guy and I guess he
had like some sort of karate school that

1001
00:25:14,151 --> 00:25:18,050
he was teaching that with his
fake fake martial arts and uh,

1002
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,640
got the guy to come to his school,

1003
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:20,510
strangled him,

1004
00:25:20,511 --> 00:25:21,344
killed him,

1005
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,480
and then was driving the guy's car,

1006
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:24,231
Rau witnesses,

1007
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,980
saw him drive the guy's car around and um,

1008
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,470
had a gun that he gave to my friend
Gerald and told Gerald to hide it.

1009
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,430
And then Gerald,

1010
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:34,971
you know,

1011
00:25:34,971 --> 00:25:37,280
calls me up and tells
me the whole situation.

1012
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:37,851
And I was like,

1013
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:38,390
what?

1014
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:39,530
What the fuck happened?

1015
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,370
The Guy,

1016
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,203
what he kills him.

1017
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,830
And then Gerald goes to the cops.

1018
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,431
Okay.

1019
00:25:43,431 --> 00:25:47,510
And then the cops called me
because Gerald had apparently been,

1020
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,403
um,

1021
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:52,640
they had wiretapped him while all this
was going down because they suspected

1022
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,511
that this guy,

1023
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,081
Raphael,

1024
00:25:54,081 --> 00:25:55,800
his real name was Ralph is,

1025
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:56,960
it wasn't Brazilian.

1026
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,280
That's the worst part of the line.

1027
00:25:58,281 --> 00:26:00,550
You said he was Brazilian
and he wasn't resilient.

1028
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,590
It'd be he just faked his ethnicity.

1029
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:05,960
He faked his martial arts background
and now he's in jail for life.

1030
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,591
I mean,

1031
00:26:06,591 --> 00:26:07,011
he's a,

1032
00:26:07,011 --> 00:26:09,380
he's in jail for murder in
a lot of twisters in jail.

1033
00:26:09,381 --> 00:26:11,500
That's what you're saying there.

1034
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:12,860
Is that not,

1035
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,750
that's the ultimate bullshit.

1036
00:26:14,751 --> 00:26:15,980
Ours fake black belt,

1037
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:16,910
fake ethnicity,

1038
00:26:16,911 --> 00:26:17,780
fake name.

1039
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,580
Everything is fucking amazing.

1040
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:20,450
It's hilarious.

1041
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:22,010
That story is so crazy.

1042
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,210
It makes you sound crazy
when you're telling.

1043
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,310
Yes it does.

1044
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,121
Well,

1045
00:26:26,121 --> 00:26:27,050
you can look the guy up.

1046
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:27,621
Google the guy,

1047
00:26:27,621 --> 00:26:28,161
Rafael,

1048
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:28,670
Tori.

1049
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,181
I mean it's,

1050
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:29,510
uh,

1051
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,470
it's an incredible story that gets
passed back and forth through the mixed

1052
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:34,304
martial arts world.

1053
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,820
But the point is that before the Internet,

1054
00:26:37,821 --> 00:26:38,331
I mean this was,

1055
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:41,420
there was websites back then and
there was martial arts websites.

1056
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:44,730
It was like 2000 I want to say like
two or three or something like that,

1057
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,830
but you couldn't like Google the guy
you could like find out the guy's

1058
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:50,664
background.

1059
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,180
Like if you Google Eliza
slouching anger that I sat,

1060
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:54,451
I say,

1061
00:26:54,451 --> 00:26:54,750
all right,

1062
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,310
there's no sugar in the middle.

1063
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,730
[inaudible] hi said No.

1064
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,460
How do you say it's it?

1065
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,293
Right?

1066
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,570
Well,

1067
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,280
I've been saying slush,

1068
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,400
ginger forever.

1069
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:06,030
Slessinger Schlesinger slashing
Sleshinger Schlesinger,

1070
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,170
Schlesinger,

1071
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,760
I'll never say it wrong again.

1072
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,653
Eliza slash

1073
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:10,210
you said it,

1074
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,260
you're going to say it wrong every time.

1075
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,590
Every time from that one.

1076
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:13,121
It will be wrong.

1077
00:27:13,121 --> 00:27:14,290
Just as it's been in the past,

1078
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,550
and I'm just going to call you a liar
because that's your Twitter handle.

1079
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,960
That's who you are to me.

1080
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,850
But if I Google you,

1081
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:22,680
I find out about last comic standing,

1082
00:27:22,681 --> 00:27:26,130
I see pictures of you topless on the beach
with two guys holding their arms over

1083
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:26,880
your titties.

1084
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,780
I see a lot of things.

1085
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,381
I've seen it.

1086
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:29,340
It's on my message board.

1087
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,090
Yeah.

1088
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:30,811
This is Raphael,

1089
00:27:30,811 --> 00:27:31,290
Tori,

1090
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,470
the guy in the left hand side with the
guy on the right hand side with the

1091
00:27:34,471 --> 00:27:37,050
glasses is Tito motherfucking Ortiz,

1092
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,360
former world champion of the UFC.

1093
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,253
So this guy,

1094
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,161
this guy,

1095
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,510
but this guy got in deep,

1096
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,860
that guy on the left,

1097
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,500
not the guy without the red in his jacket.

1098
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,000
The guy on the detail,

1099
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,590
it's his left.

1100
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:49,861
Right.

1101
00:27:49,861 --> 00:27:51,420
You know you are right.

1102
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,440
This is so complicated.

1103
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,730
I'm still is the one,

1104
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:53,881
yeah,

1105
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:55,900
the guy on the right hand
side of the photograph.

1106
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,040
The guy with the mustache.

1107
00:27:57,041 --> 00:27:57,240
Yes.

1108
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:57,541
Thank you.

1109
00:27:57,541 --> 00:27:58,000
There we go.

1110
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,980
The guy without the glasses.

1111
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,150
That's Rafael Torres.

1112
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,270
He's in jail for murder and he's
a fake black belt and he's uh,

1113
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,950
you know everything about his fake,

1114
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:05,850
his names fake.

1115
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,940
And that guy like got deep,

1116
00:28:08,941 --> 00:28:09,181
deep,

1117
00:28:09,181 --> 00:28:10,560
deep in the martial arts world

1118
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,253
as a fraud.

1119
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,520
That's so crazy.

1120
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,413
Fascinating.

1121
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:14,990
Also,

1122
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,201
I mean,

1123
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:16,430
I guess you,

1124
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:18,740
and you want to ask Kevin
as I asked the ex boyfriend,

1125
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:18,981
I was like,

1126
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:20,630
what was your end game here buddy?

1127
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:23,750
Did you have a conversation with him
after this or was it just email and that's

1128
00:28:23,751 --> 00:28:23,930
it.

1129
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:24,591
Did you talk,

1130
00:28:24,591 --> 00:28:24,891
talk,

1131
00:28:24,891 --> 00:28:25,640
he texted and he,

1132
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,060
I mean,

1133
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:26,870
he apologize.

1134
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,160
This wasn't like Poof,

1135
00:28:28,161 --> 00:28:28,461
I'm gone.

1136
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:29,121
Like there's a lot of,

1137
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:29,421
you know.

1138
00:28:29,421 --> 00:28:32,430
But did you think about like
keeping the Moran couldn't,

1139
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,900
couldn't because like you
have to take yourself,

1140
00:28:35,901 --> 00:28:36,200
I mean,

1141
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,531
I even,

1142
00:28:36,531 --> 00:28:37,040
I knew this,

1143
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,090
you have to take yourself out of like you,

1144
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,730
your hurt and your heart's broken.

1145
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,200
You're allowed to let that heal.

1146
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,270
But getting back with
someone like that is not,

1147
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:44,631
first of all,

1148
00:28:44,631 --> 00:28:46,820
I lose respect from my
all my friends and family.

1149
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,410
And then also like,

1150
00:28:48,411 --> 00:28:49,400
you can't trust that person.

1151
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,800
The end game for you is that you'd
be dating someone you couldn't trust.

1152
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,460
However.

1153
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,240
Um,

1154
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,721
but I asked,

1155
00:28:53,721 --> 00:28:53,871
you know,

1156
00:28:53,871 --> 00:28:55,060
when he just never,

1157
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,731
that's the other thing.

1158
00:28:55,731 --> 00:28:56,750
And I said in the email,

1159
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,291
I was like,

1160
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:57,451
I'm,

1161
00:28:57,451 --> 00:28:59,000
I don't have all the answers from him.

1162
00:28:59,330 --> 00:28:59,601
I said,

1163
00:28:59,601 --> 00:29:04,280
I'm willing to trade my lack of closure
for the privilege of never having to

1164
00:29:04,281 --> 00:29:05,114
talk to you again.

1165
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,830
So I will write my own closure.

1166
00:29:06,831 --> 00:29:07,880
I'll draw my own conclusions.

1167
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,110
I won't defend you to anyone.

1168
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,020
And he went down on me for 20 minutes.

1169
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,600
Ah,

1170
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:14,490
yes.

1171
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,910
So funny outside is outside too,

1172
00:29:16,911 --> 00:29:17,720
Huh?

1173
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,140
Danger,

1174
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,561
danger,

1175
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:19,394
pussy.

1176
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,473
Um,

1177
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,080
that's so crazy that did that.

1178
00:29:22,081 --> 00:29:23,850
The lack of closure thing is a big thing,

1179
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:24,031
right?

1180
00:29:24,031 --> 00:29:26,520
Cause you'll stay up late
to try to figure it out.

1181
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,980
Do you like find yourself
like during the day,

1182
00:29:28,981 --> 00:29:31,010
like just driving around
trying to piece it together?

1183
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,170
Yeah.

1184
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:31,870
Where did it,

1185
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,930
I was sitting on the plane
yesterday and like you're here,

1186
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,590
especially when you just
go through a breakup,

1187
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:35,950
like you're,

1188
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:36,101
you know,

1189
00:29:36,101 --> 00:29:37,210
you think about that person,

1190
00:29:37,211 --> 00:29:38,044
whatever.

1191
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,070
And the hard thing is not,

1192
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,070
I'm past that phase.

1193
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:40,830
Like there's no,

1194
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:41,651
the blocked,

1195
00:29:41,651 --> 00:29:42,910
like I can't call him or anything,

1196
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:43,961
but yeah.

1197
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:46,480
You sit there and you go back
over things and then I start like,

1198
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:49,120
here's a weird piece of the puzzle if
you want to know what I was thinking.

1199
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,573
Um,

1200
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,150
when before we were dating,

1201
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:55,350
he invited me to go to England for the
skull and bones thing and obviously not

1202
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:55,821
in skull and bones.

1203
00:29:55,821 --> 00:29:56,654
You didn't go to Yale.

1204
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,030
And even after this all happened,

1205
00:29:58,031 --> 00:29:58,211
he goes,

1206
00:29:58,211 --> 00:29:58,301
well,

1207
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:59,680
my dad was in skull
and bones and I'm like,

1208
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,480
your dad went to Yale Grad school,

1209
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,380
what's his name?

1210
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,670
What's Your Dad's name?

1211
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,110
But Dad's dead in real life.

1212
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,040
That's what I mean that for.

1213
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,450
But uh,

1214
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,680
he invited me to go to England,

1215
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,770
so I was going to go separate rooms and
I went out to dinner with a friend who

1216
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:15,580
has a body that I really liked.

1217
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:19,900
So I took a picture of my drink and in
the background was my friend's body.

1218
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,890
He's like a big guy.

1219
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,600
So the point of the
picture was to be like,

1220
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:23,650
look at this hot thing.

1221
00:30:23,651 --> 00:30:25,390
I'm having a drink was not so much to me,

1222
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:25,491
like,

1223
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:26,290
look at the drink.

1224
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:26,980
Right.

1225
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,700
I think he saw that picture because I
don't remember if it was before or after,

1226
00:30:30,701 --> 00:30:32,860
but that was the night
he called me and said,

1227
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,701
we can't go to England.

1228
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:34,534
My mom has cancer.

1229
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:37,930
I think he saw that picture
on Instagram and he was like,

1230
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:40,500
I got to do something to
shake this up if the mom,

1231
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,800
if the mom doesn't have cancer.

1232
00:30:41,801 --> 00:30:43,600
It's odd that that was
the night of all nights.

1233
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,170
So you were friends only
up until that point.

1234
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:47,890
Yeah.

1235
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:48,790
Let me tell you something.

1236
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,820
There's friends and there's friends with
an agenda and you and I are friends.

1237
00:30:54,341 --> 00:30:55,690
We will never have sex.

1238
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,620
I'll tell you that right now.

1239
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,310
I'm married,

1240
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,060
we're friends.

1241
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,590
I'm not going to let it happen.

1242
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,690
Eliza just stop with those eyes.

1243
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,601
But you know what I'm saying?

1244
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,920
Like we're legitimate friends,

1245
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,000
Amy Schumer's and other ones.

1246
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,160
She's my legitimate friends and I,

1247
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:09,730
you know,

1248
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:13,450
I think it's very important to
like have men and women like that,

1249
00:31:13,451 --> 00:31:14,470
that are friends like that.

1250
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:16,810
There's like a line that
will never be crossed.

1251
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,830
It's like you can't,

1252
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:21,190
but there's guys who are really
never your fucking friend.

1253
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,761
Never,

1254
00:31:21,761 --> 00:31:22,121
ever,

1255
00:31:22,121 --> 00:31:22,481
ever,

1256
00:31:22,481 --> 00:31:22,841
ever,

1257
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:23,201
ever.

1258
00:31:23,201 --> 00:31:23,890
It's done.

1259
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,780
The whole thing was a
lie from the beginning.

1260
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,750
Like I knew that like I'm not dumb.

1261
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:30,850
And he had said that to me is like
goes over your friend but you,

1262
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:32,070
he was someone that I,

1263
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:32,460
we had,

1264
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,790
we hung out and we had a really nice
like relationship his friends and

1265
00:31:35,791 --> 00:31:37,830
definitely I would get drunk
once in a while and I'd be like,

1266
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:38,611
let's make out.

1267
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:39,660
Like that's like a girl thing.

1268
00:31:39,661 --> 00:31:40,494
But it was never,

1269
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,030
oh,

1270
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,620
what,

1271
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,453
hold on.

1272
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:43,860
You would get drunk and say,

1273
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:44,730
let's make out.

1274
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,400
Like I would kiss him and
like go inside a big deal.

1275
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,050
Well kiss him like tongue and everything,

1276
00:31:49,051 --> 00:31:49,740
the whole deal.

1277
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,341
Like a drunk,

1278
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:52,590
make out kiss fully clothed
and then like go inside.

1279
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,610
Whoa.

1280
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,610
That's so girl.

1281
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,000
It's so crazy.

1282
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:56,701
I also said,

1283
00:31:56,701 --> 00:31:57,534
I would say to him,

1284
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:57,961
I'm like,

1285
00:31:57,961 --> 00:31:59,340
look at any point,

1286
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,330
and I'm very upfront,

1287
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:00,720
honest.

1288
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,510
I'd say at any point we
can stop hanging out.

1289
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:03,781
I go,

1290
00:32:03,781 --> 00:32:04,830
I'm never going to date you.

1291
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:05,910
You need to know that.

1292
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:06,991
And He,

1293
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:09,090
meanwhile you dated him eventually,

1294
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,540
but that's not my point is
the whole time we were dating,

1295
00:32:12,541 --> 00:32:13,171
I was honest.

1296
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:13,441
I was like,

1297
00:32:13,441 --> 00:32:14,700
I have no intention of dating you.

1298
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:14,940
Yeah.

1299
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,590
But you kissed him tongue.

1300
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,820
You can walk away.

1301
00:32:17,821 --> 00:32:20,070
I didn't chain him to
the wall and I was like,

1302
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,300
I'm going to date other guys.

1303
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,070
I'm going to have other guys be my boy.

1304
00:32:23,071 --> 00:32:24,540
Like not when I was kissing him,

1305
00:32:24,541 --> 00:32:25,110
but I was like,

1306
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,340
I'm probably never going to date you.

1307
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,293
Right.

1308
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:28,320
And he hung around.

1309
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,681
Well,

1310
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:28,920
I,

1311
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,000
I understand that.

1312
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:30,863
I mean,

1313
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:31,471
well,

1314
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,660
he's definitely a silly
man for hanging around,

1315
00:32:33,661 --> 00:32:35,550
but not because he
eventually got to fuck you.

1316
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,570
So he wins,

1317
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,043
I guess.

1318
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,153
I don't think furlough.

1319
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:39,411
Oh,

1320
00:32:39,411 --> 00:32:39,710
neat.

1321
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,230
Well listen

1322
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,090
to you because you're a girl.

1323
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:41,661
Listen,

1324
00:32:41,661 --> 00:32:42,440
you kissed him.

1325
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:42,711
You,

1326
00:32:42,711 --> 00:32:45,830
you tongued him and he
eventually got in there.

1327
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,890
But you're telling me that every girl
you've brought prior to being married,

1328
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:51,290
ever girl you ever like drunkenly made
out with that meant something to you?

1329
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:51,551
No,

1330
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:51,710
no,

1331
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:51,951
no,

1332
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:52,430
but it's,

1333
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,280
I think there's a difference
between you saying to someone,

1334
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:55,670
look,

1335
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,181
first of all,

1336
00:32:56,181 --> 00:32:56,750
I'm a man.

1337
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,700
When a man drunkenly
makes out with a girl,

1338
00:32:58,701 --> 00:32:59,990
he absolutely wants a fucker.

1339
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,480
If a girl drunkenly makes out with a guy,

1340
00:33:02,481 --> 00:33:03,171
she can do it.

1341
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:03,981
Just to be silly,

1342
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:04,461
I guess.

1343
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:05,810
And then just shut the door and go in.

1344
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,530
Yeah,

1345
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,670
guys don't ever do that.

1346
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,240
That's okay.

1347
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,190
If a guy drunkenly makes out with a girl,

1348
00:33:10,191 --> 00:33:13,700
it's almost always because he eventually
ultimately wants to have sex with her.

1349
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:14,820
But,

1350
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,180
but um,

1351
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:16,070
but that's what hasn't,

1352
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,060
that's how guys are and
that's not how girls are.

1353
00:33:18,061 --> 00:33:20,490
And I think all any girl
would relate to that.

1354
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:20,701
Like,

1355
00:33:20,701 --> 00:33:21,271
you know,

1356
00:33:21,271 --> 00:33:22,104
or you're just,

1357
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,840
I mean you're drunk and you want it.

1358
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,170
Sometimes you just want to make out
with someone and that's the God's honest

1359
00:33:28,171 --> 00:33:28,411
truth.

1360
00:33:28,411 --> 00:33:30,680
Like we all get horny and I don't
feel like having had those expo.

1361
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,100
Here's my point though.

1362
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,130
No matter what relationship
you're conducting,

1363
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,300
even like,

1364
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,860
even if you feel I'm
throwing mixed signals,

1365
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,810
you at any point are allowed to walk away.

1366
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,010
And at no point was I like,

1367
00:33:41,011 --> 00:33:41,461
I love you.

1368
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:42,330
Please stay.

1369
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,080
It was me being like,

1370
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,310
I'm going to make out with you.

1371
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,390
Maybe I'll take my shirt off.

1372
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,380
I'm not going to date you.

1373
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:47,560
Maybe I'll go anyway.

1374
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,610
But this one,

1375
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,060
the whole time they will,

1376
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:56,250
I started from day one side isn't as
if like they came into play later,

1377
00:33:56,251 --> 00:33:57,540
like the whole time.

1378
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,490
And then I think what he was like,

1379
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:01,500
what happened is I lied
and I know what to do.

1380
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:01,741
He's like,

1381
00:34:01,741 --> 00:34:02,551
I didn't think we would date.

1382
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:03,250
You always told us,

1383
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:03,931
told me we wouldn't.

1384
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:04,561
And then we did.

1385
00:34:04,561 --> 00:34:04,801
He's like,

1386
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:05,760
I didn't know what to do.

1387
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:06,594
And I'm like,

1388
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,171
hold on,

1389
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:08,004
it's on you.

1390
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:11,090
Well that's definitely on him
and the lies are unacceptable.

1391
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:11,600
I just,

1392
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,600
all I'm trying to do is as your friend
breakdown though the mindset and try to

1393
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:20,150
figure out like how someone says,

1394
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,450
I'll tongue you and kiss
you and take my shirt off,

1395
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:25,640
but we're never going to have
sex for a guy that's like,

1396
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:26,930
if we're getting that close,

1397
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,330
if your tits are coming out
and my tongue's in your mouth.

1398
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,193
Okay.

1399
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,250
I was joking about the shirt thing.

1400
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:31,970
Okay.

1401
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:32,803
Uh,

1402
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,321
I don't think,

1403
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,740
I think everybody's been there words for
like a drunk make out to the end of the

1404
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,730
night and you're just like,

1405
00:34:37,731 --> 00:34:38,091
whatever.

1406
00:34:38,091 --> 00:34:39,530
I feel like making out.

1407
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,870
And so you do like you like I know this
person and this is fine and they're like

1408
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,330
I ever totally support your,

1409
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,680
your right to make out with people
and you're drunk and have like a very

1410
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:52,140
specific boundary where it's not
going to go any further than this.

1411
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:53,430
We're never going to date,

1412
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:54,570
but if you want to make out,

1413
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,590
I'll make out with you right now.

1414
00:34:55,591 --> 00:34:56,161
But that's it.

1415
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:56,760
And then that's it.

1416
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,200
That's your,

1417
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,170
your your prerogative.

1418
00:34:58,171 --> 00:34:59,640
100% is on your show.

1419
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,350
We did,

1420
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,810
I mean like a long time ago where I will,

1421
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:03,260
if I'm like,

1422
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:05,540
let's say I'm seeing someone and
let's say it's like the second date or

1423
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,020
something,

1424
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,670
I will straight up say to a guy,

1425
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,710
I'm not going to sleep with you just yet.

1426
00:35:09,711 --> 00:35:10,400
Like I don't,

1427
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,270
I'm not going to do that.

1428
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,980
But if you wanna go upstairs,

1429
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,440
we can make out among touch your wiener,

1430
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,611
I'll take my shirt off.

1431
00:35:16,611 --> 00:35:17,444
That is a treat for you

1432
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:22,430
tomorrow you'll buy me breakfast
and no one has ever said no.

1433
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,850
When you give men certain boundaries
or parameters ahead of time,

1434
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,370
right.

1435
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:26,580
They,

1436
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,460
and then I'm giving you
the option to say I'm good,

1437
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:29,151
or I'm tired,

1438
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:29,721
or I think I'm gonna,

1439
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:30,530
I'm gonna go home.

1440
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,460
Whatever you want.

1441
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,930
That way you're not disappointed.

1442
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:33,980
No one's ever pushed it.

1443
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,830
No one's ever tried to get me
to do more than wanting to do.

1444
00:35:36,831 --> 00:35:37,800
And one's ever said no.

1445
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,040
Well,

1446
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,630
you're a very strong personality,

1447
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,170
you know?

1448
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,980
And if you say that a guys,

1449
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,400
I'm not saying every guy would respect it,

1450
00:35:44,401 --> 00:35:45,630
but most guys who go,

1451
00:35:45,631 --> 00:35:47,700
she's not fucking around
like this is what she wants.

1452
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:50,360
And it's better than nothing
for a lot of guys that like,

1453
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:50,821
well yeah,

1454
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:51,610
it's better than nothing.

1455
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:51,780
Yeah,

1456
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,610
I'll go make out and squeeze some titties.

1457
00:35:53,611 --> 00:35:54,444
And we like date.

1458
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,170
Yeah,

1459
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:55,740
yeah.

1460
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,090
And then eventually we'll fuck.

1461
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:58,343
So it's like,

1462
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:58,740
yeah,

1463
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,710
well there's nothing wrong with
that because also we're talking to,

1464
00:36:00,711 --> 00:36:04,260
if I was a girl also it would
be really difficult for me,

1465
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,453
I assume,

1466
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:07,170
to just trust a man.

1467
00:36:07,171 --> 00:36:08,220
Like physically,

1468
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,620
like there's the physical thing like,

1469
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:11,040
look,

1470
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,120
you had this guy,

1471
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,920
you knew him for a fucking year,

1472
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:17,490
you data for three months and he turned
out to be a complete total bull sharks.

1473
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,720
What if it was,

1474
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,280
you knew him for a year,

1475
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,310
you dated him for three months and he
turn out to be a fucking psychopath and

1476
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:24,590
you didn't know the whole
time you were dating.

1477
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,390
Well sort of,

1478
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,970
but what if it's the whole
time you were dating?

1479
00:36:26,971 --> 00:36:28,770
He was raping girls
while you weren't around?

1480
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:33,000
I mean that's just as
possible as him faking Yale.

1481
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,210
He could have been a serial
rapist or with a gun.

1482
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,470
Like he could be a total fucking,

1483
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,403
yeah.

1484
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,181
Did he have a key?

1485
00:36:39,181 --> 00:36:40,290
I don't at any point in time,

1486
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:43,020
but he did like from the only thing that,

1487
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,670
because we'd known each other for a year.

1488
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:46,980
So when you know someone
for a year and then date,

1489
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,180
it's a little,

1490
00:36:48,181 --> 00:36:50,610
you could take it a little bit faster
because it isn't like you just started

1491
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,380
dating I've nowhere but like a month.

1492
00:36:52,381 --> 00:36:52,741
And he was like,

1493
00:36:52,741 --> 00:36:53,760
I'd love to move in.

1494
00:36:53,761 --> 00:36:53,970
Like,

1495
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:55,200
what can we move in together?

1496
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,410
I've definitely dated guys that liked
to go fast and you got to like pump the

1497
00:36:58,411 --> 00:36:59,880
brakes and now

1498
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,180
you're the guy alive.

1499
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,063
I always,

1500
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,350
I'm out because I'm like,

1501
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:07,471
yeah,

1502
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:08,460
let's be fucking intense.

1503
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:08,720
Let's,

1504
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,440
let's sit in Nancy this into the ground.

1505
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,981
Yeah.

1506
00:37:10,981 --> 00:37:15,660
But if you really enjoy life and you
really enjoy the person fucking why not?

1507
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:18,300
Who gives a shit for
this one in particular?

1508
00:37:18,301 --> 00:37:19,770
I was like relaxed with the,

1509
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,940
with the moving in thing.

1510
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:21,923
Right.

1511
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,250
And now and now it's even weird.

1512
00:37:23,251 --> 00:37:23,850
I'm like,

1513
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,271
so what,

1514
00:37:24,271 --> 00:37:25,170
so what was your plan like?

1515
00:37:25,171 --> 00:37:28,200
You were going to reveal all this
then you'd be living with me.

1516
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:28,571
God,

1517
00:37:28,571 --> 00:37:31,560
could you imagine if you were living
with this fucking guy and all that stuff

1518
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:32,394
came out?

1519
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:32,970
Uh,

1520
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,571
it would have been,

1521
00:37:33,571 --> 00:37:36,930
I mean I would have had to
take my mortgage from afar.

1522
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:37,591
Yeah.

1523
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:38,610
What would you do?

1524
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,980
Jesus Christ physical thing.

1525
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,690
I always kind of like test.

1526
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:43,531
If I'm dating someone,

1527
00:37:43,531 --> 00:37:44,281
like I'll be like,

1528
00:37:44,281 --> 00:37:45,000
let's,

1529
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,130
I'm going to try to get past
you and see if you can stop me.

1530
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:47,861
Are you serious?

1531
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:50,610
I was just trying to see
like physically where we are.

1532
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,140
I definitely almost beat a
boyfriend in a wrestling,

1533
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,230
an arm wrestling match one time.

1534
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,663
Yeah.

1535
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,950
Not everybody works out
and not everybody's angry,

1536
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,260
but I definitely was saying
I work out in them angry.

1537
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,810
So we were trying to say I did
not implies and comparative.

1538
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:04,471
Uh,

1539
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:06,120
but the physical thing I definitely,

1540
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,590
but it really works on that.

1541
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:08,281
Everybody's angry.

1542
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:09,450
That's not what I meant for me.

1543
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:09,991
I know I'm saying,

1544
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,550
I mean I was paying,

1545
00:38:11,610 --> 00:38:12,120
I'm,

1546
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,140
I work out and I'm angry.

1547
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,213
You just,

1548
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,220
you just gotta Know How to sling it.

1549
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:17,821
You know,

1550
00:38:17,821 --> 00:38:18,430
bullshit.

1551
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,250
It does work on occasionally,

1552
00:38:20,251 --> 00:38:21,084
even with smart.

1553
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,490
I mean that's what's the most impressive
thing about his accomplishment.

1554
00:38:23,491 --> 00:38:24,324
You are,

1555
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,193
you know,

1556
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,670
you're one of my smartest friends.

1557
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,330
You're smart.

1558
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,051
You're very smart.

1559
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:28,884
You're very quick.

1560
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,770
And for a god,

1561
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:32,910
a tricky like that and a trick you over
a long period of time with a lot of,

1562
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:33,691
you know,

1563
00:38:33,691 --> 00:38:36,430
a lot of questions along
the where you hit some bumps

1564
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:36,941
I guess.

1565
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:37,691
But here's the other thing.

1566
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,020
I mean,

1567
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:38,350
I,

1568
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,880
I don't even know if the
word is trick and I'll,

1569
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,181
I mean,

1570
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:41,020
I totally fell for it.

1571
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:42,123
The shit out of you.

1572
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,930
I feel like,

1573
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,430
I guess it is tricky,

1574
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,050
but it's also the ones he's like,

1575
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:48,670
why would I question that in my life?

1576
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,950
No one's ever lied about where
they went to school that I knew of.

1577
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,580
Right.

1578
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:54,610
These are not lies that in society
we're told to look out for.

1579
00:38:54,611 --> 00:38:55,780
It'd be one like everyone's like,

1580
00:38:55,781 --> 00:38:56,650
does he have another family?

1581
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,170
I would even think about like your school,

1582
00:38:59,171 --> 00:38:59,821
like who cares?

1583
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:01,020
It's like lying about your blood type.

1584
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:01,431
Well,

1585
00:39:01,431 --> 00:39:02,120
not just his,

1586
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,100
he lied about where most likely,

1587
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:04,770
let's be honest,

1588
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,300
most likely a about his mom having cancer
because you were dating a big heart

1589
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:08,930
guy,

1590
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:09,381
you know,

1591
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:11,080
and he most likely lied.

1592
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:11,271
Well,

1593
00:39:11,271 --> 00:39:14,630
he definitely lied about the
skeleton bones part about England.

1594
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,880
He lied about his house twice.

1595
00:39:16,881 --> 00:39:17,481
He lied about,

1596
00:39:17,481 --> 00:39:17,960
you know,

1597
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,840
he sounds like a guy who just lies at a d.

1598
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,470
It means probably gotten laid
doing that his whole life.

1599
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,800
I don't think he's gotten late enough.

1600
00:39:25,801 --> 00:39:26,760
I think that's what it was.

1601
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,340
And I'm just thinking about it.

1602
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,060
No,

1603
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,990
because I don't think it's,

1604
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:31,893
he's not like,

1605
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,040
I'll look,

1606
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,170
I totally got tricked.

1607
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:35,580
I'm not above admitting that.

1608
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,590
I'm also not above admitting that.

1609
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:38,970
I think when you love someone,

1610
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,320
you're judgment is clouded.

1611
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,213
And I didn't,

1612
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,590
I didn't know the scope
of what that could be.

1613
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:44,430
I didn't in a billion years,

1614
00:39:44,431 --> 00:39:46,060
I wouldn't have thought
that that was real.

1615
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:47,310
Like I thought it was a joke that like,

1616
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,521
oh,

1617
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:48,660
we can't find is the diploma,

1618
00:39:48,661 --> 00:39:49,494
whatever,

1619
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,100
but you won't.

1620
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,300
You almost don't want it to be true.

1621
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:01,270
Okay.
