1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,133
Sure.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,441
Boom.

3
00:00:10,441 --> 00:00:11,730
And we're live fight companion.

4
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,190
Motherfucking Bravo,

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:15,900
Brandon,

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,820
mother fucking sharp.

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,450
We're here.

8
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:23,450
Fight Companion Darren till versus Donald
Cowboy Cerrone is the main event and

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,080
Ebi tomorrow.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:25,890
Uh,

11
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:26,670
Eddie Bravo,

12
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,220
invitational Jujitsu tournament tomorrow.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,900
Is that at the Orpheum again
at the Orpheum downtown La.

14
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:36,090
You can get tickets@ebiofficial.com.

15
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,070
You can watch it on UFC fight pass.

16
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:42,840
And you also have a choice now to
watch it on paper view@inchbyinch.tv.

17
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,000
That's cool.

18
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,883
That's a great,

19
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:45,691
it's a good move.

20
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:47,520
So if you don't have fight
pass you can still get it.

21
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:47,910
Yup.

22
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,121
Yup.

23
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:48,954
That's my company.

24
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,030
But if you don't have five paths,

25
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,120
you usually get bypass.

26
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,200
Bypass is the shit.

27
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:54,210
And we're watching this fight
on fight pass right now.

28
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,150
And I'm not just saying five passes
a shit cause I mean UFC employee,

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
if you're a fan of the sport,

30
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,590
there's fucking everything on fight pass.

31
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:04,050
You will go down a God damn rabbit hole.

32
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:06,260
Pride fights for thing.

33
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,000
If we could watch so many fights.

34
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,810
And there's also like a bunch of like
organizations that you never heard of

35
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,150
before that have awesome fights,

36
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:15,380
height and just the fact,

37
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:17,480
just the fact that you could watch any of,

38
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:18,900
see if I ever just,

39
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,270
that alone is worth it.

40
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,830
It's amazing live just that alone.

41
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,401
Just boom.

42
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,780
You could just remember that fight.

43
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:25,021
Boom.

44
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:25,750
You could watch it.

45
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,740
Remember that five boom,

46
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:27,321
you could watch them.

47
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:29,340
Demand demands and the pride fights.

48
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,361
Fights.

49
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:31,194
That's what I like.

50
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,131
That alone.

51
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:33,450
It doesn't even need anything else.

52
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,680
We should do some,

53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:34,950
uh,

54
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,870
fight companions for old pride fights.

55
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:38,060
The Best Lens Electron,

56
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,311
Cro,

57
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:42,630
cop versus a fade or
Vandelay nog versus fate or,

58
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,340
yes.

59
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,450
PSAP.

60
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,070
Nogueira you know,

61
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:47,621
come on.

62
00:01:47,621 --> 00:01:51,900
[inaudible] question is how long after
UFC do they put the individual fights on

63
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,561
bypass?

64
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,394
That's a good question.

65
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,360
And you were saying too,

66
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,190
they upload them.

67
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,770
Yeah.

68
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,250
There's a lot of people on this before we,

69
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,640
we can see this fight on fight pass.

70
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,940
Well this class,

71
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,850
this is on fight pass right now.

72
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:03,990
I mean archived.

73
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,261
Oh,

74
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:05,640
there'll be I crop right afterwards.

75
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,930
How long does it take?

76
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,300
100% it's right afterwards.

77
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,330
Uploads right away.

78
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,150
I don't think so because I've
tried to check fights out.

79
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,110
That just happened.

80
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,940
Maybe they were Fox fights.

81
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,810
If it's FX or f or Fox
sports one or Fox sports two.

82
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,644
They own those.

83
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,880
True or Fox.

84
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,953
They own those.

85
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,280
They can't put those on bypass.

86
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,270
I don't know,

87
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,320
but I don't think so.

88
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,041
I think you're right.

89
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:26,874
Joe Fox.

90
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,390
Yeah,

91
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,223
I think they do.

92
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:28,740
That's part of the,

93
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,340
the sun.

94
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,320
You don't pay all that
money on clothes or money.

95
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,730
They don't want to pay fuckloads of money.

96
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:35,430
So you could just not have Fox
and just watch it on fight pass.

97
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,380
But the one,

98
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:37,230
I mean they should own it.

99
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:37,501
I mean,

100
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,101
they're paying for,

101
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:39,030
what are they doing with it?

102
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:39,864
They ain't doing shit.

103
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,490
They replay them all the time.

104
00:02:41,491 --> 00:02:41,910
Again,

105
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,000
like replaced one last night
was Cain Valasquez risk,

106
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,863
big foot.

107
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,781
And I watched that.

108
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:47,070
Damn,

109
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,930
they're starting and replay them on
Fox and tonight I have it on my DVR.

110
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:52,711
So,

111
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,544
uh,

112
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:54,180
uh,

113
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,820
not because of my GPO or I'm a
hipster Olin because business,

114
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,310
I'm too busy to too lazy

115
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,690
to turn on the TV.

116
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,890
UFC fight night.

117
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,970
On the DVR,

118
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,570
like automatically set to record and
it always is recording old fights,

119
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,850
always school ones constantly.

120
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,350
So anything that has been on fight
at on fs one or any fox venue,

121
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,650

122
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:15,461

124
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,400
I have fucking access
TV fights on that bitch.

125
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:21,860
Yeah.

126
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,330
Amen.

127
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:22,961

00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:25,480
I love of lion fight.

131
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:25,940
Yes.

132
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,590
Fight fighters.

133
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,640
They got some fucking amazing Moitai
of some PVC box and on there and shit.

134
00:03:30,641 --> 00:03:31,121
I've everything.

135
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:33,280
So these dudes who are fighting right now,

136
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:37,720
p p p Chada and Wilson,

137
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,750
um,

138
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,010
I'm assuming patrol does
the guy in the red and yeah,

139
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:45,510
the little thing on the bottom that
Wilson dude has a sick left kick man.

140
00:03:45,511 --> 00:03:45,891
He's thrown,

141
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,631
thrown some nasty,

142
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,010
a hard left kicks to the body.

143
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,120
But I don't know these dudes,

144
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,780
I heard there was some good
fights on the prelims are above.

145
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,450
I heard was good.

146
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,071
You know who won that?

147
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:54,401
Jamie,

148
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,030
do you guys know?

149
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,361
No.

150
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:56,140
Who did he fight?

151
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:56,441
I don't know,

152
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,400
but got head kicked.

153
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,100
Rm did and then I'm not sure,

154
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:04,090
but Connor was there and he was trying
to corner him and the ref had to stop the

155
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:04,600
fight.

156
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,320
Andre Fili.

157
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,950
Why him?

158
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,491
Why did the ref,

159
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,490
I have to stop because Connor was an
official corner man and was yelling out

160
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:10,750
instructions and the ref was like,

161
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,530
hold up,

162
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,520
you got to chill man.

163
00:04:12,521 --> 00:04:14,110
Be Professional and
kind of was like my bad.

164
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,950
My bad.

165
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:15,420
Really?

166
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,120
Yeah.

167
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,610
You can't yell out when from
your outside of the cage.

168
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:18,881
Well,

169
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:23,500
he was cage side and he walked up to
the cage and was yelling instructions.

170
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,220
Oh,

171
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,701
homeboy was like,

172
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:24,881
Yo,

173
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,800
you're not an official corner
me and you'll get three.

174
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:27,870
Not For let's,

175
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,691
it's a title fight.

176
00:04:28,691 --> 00:04:29,800
So he was too close.

177
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:30,430
I'm just,

178
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,750
it was a distraction and he's like,

179
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:32,584
you gotta chill man.

180
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,880
That's a good rule.

181
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,500
There really is a great rule.

182
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:35,801
Yeah.

183
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:39,910
You can't have crowds of dudes
that are your friends yelling,

184
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,260
calling you a faggot.

185
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:42,600
There you go.

186
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:42,970
Yeah,

187
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,250
look at him because he made,

188
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,920
he just shows up everywhere with
cuff links and a beautiful suit.

189
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,830
He just walking around
like he owns the place.

190
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:54,100
He does well cause he does.

191
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,480
He puts his hands at me.

192
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:58,060
So it's Mark God or to
mark is a motherfucker.

193
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,953
It is a motherfucker.

194
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,070
He's not taking any bullshit.

195
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,221
Oh,

196
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:03,280
this dude's got the choke
standing rear naked.

197
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,140
So I watched Bella tour last night.

198
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,400
Right?

199
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:05,861
That a,

200
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:06,760
what is that dude?

201
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:07,870
That Gracie dude,

202
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,231
uh,

203
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,150
halls son hall a son.

204
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,970
Do you know?

205
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,803
Uh,

206
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:12,480
uh,

207
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,390
I am in Gracie.

208
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,601
Yes.

209
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:13,930
Yes.

210
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,890
Bad motherfucker.

211
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,020
That motherfucker serious
to just some dudes out.

212
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,883
How about that?

213
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,340
No.

214
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,671
Yeah,

215
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:19,071
seven.

216
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:19,300
I know.

217
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,440
Seven submissions.

218
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,270
He's a,

219
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,571
he's a,

220
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,530
he's a bad motherfucker.

221
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,420
Submissions.

222
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,391
Neiman Gracie.

223
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,930
And who's his father?

224
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,860
Hall's holes.

225
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,610
How do you say it?

226
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,930
Holes.

227
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:29,400
The holes.

228
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,130
The dining it.

229
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:30,620
Yes.

230
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,460
Hang Glider accident.

231
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,200
Yeah.

232
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,441
Dude,

233
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,940
you should have seen
this neck crank Eddie.

234
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,920
I thought he's gonna bake
this motherfucker's neck.

235
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,400
Yeah,

236
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,330
the dude looked every bit of 44
but I guess he's only 32 minutes.

237
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,581
Great.

238
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:39,851
Here.

239
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,780
Like the guy who fought.

240
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:40,990
Yeah,

241
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,920
it looks like Luke Thomas.

242
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:42,790
But look right here.

243
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,670
Yeah,

244
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:43,990
he,

245
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,190
he was young son,

246
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,030
but he had gray hair.

247
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,200
But if you take away the gray hair,

248
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,350
I can't take ripped and look good.

249
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:50,831
For sure.

250
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,850
Defense to men.

251
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,820
He had him on his back the whole
first round and it fought him off.

252
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:55,654
But then,

253
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,240
um,

254
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,860
Neiman's switched to a net crank.

255
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,430
It just,

256
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,050
it looked like it hurts so bad.

257
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,210
Are you going to lunch
in and we sent this.

258
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,841
Oh yeah,

259
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:03,680
there it is right there.

260
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:04,551
No,

261
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,270
that's not it.

262
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,690
That was his fight at mass square garden.

263
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,860
He won that one choke to last night.

264
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:11,540
He had the dude's neck side.

265
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,950
It hurts so bad.

266
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:14,940
Musashi did look great Brock.

267
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,070
So to sync this up,

268
00:06:16,071 --> 00:06:17,510
we're at 25 seconds.

269
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:18,201
The first round,

270
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:19,100
23,

271
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,510
2121 and uh,

272
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,420
put Pete Chota.

273
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,030
I don't know how to say his
name is on the back of Wilson.

274
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,810
He's getting worked.

275
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,380
Oh Shit.

276
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,213
He's got the choke.

277
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,260
Uh Oh shit.

278
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,483
Oh Shit.

279
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,490
Oh Shit.

280
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,060
I said no,

281
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:33,190
no,

282
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,261
no,

283
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:33,440
no,

284
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,190
not much time.

285
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,850
Not much time.

286
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:35,683
I think you can hang on.

287
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,110
It's tucked under the chin.

288
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,310
Oh,

289
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,701
hang on.

290
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:38,391
Powerful.

291
00:06:38,391 --> 00:06:39,380
He's going to hang on is out.

292
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,630
He's good dad.

293
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,483
That's the bell.

294
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,581
But last night and belt,

295
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:43,700
where was Saucy d look,

296
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:44,451
lethargic,

297
00:06:44,451 --> 00:06:45,230
kind of take off.

298
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,070
I had to go to the comedy store.

299
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:46,904
I missed it.

300
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,710
He definitely won the first round.

301
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:49,310
But then,

302
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:49,900
uh,

303
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,320
uh,

304
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,850
show Manco shut a,

305
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,281
yeah,

306
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:52,911
it's a tough one.

307
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,150
No.

308
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:53,960
What is his name?

309
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,793
What's his name?

310
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,480
She'll minko right.

311
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,160
Sly Manco Manco

312
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,880
he hit him with a,

313
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,370
uh,

314
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,050
overhand left and closed up his ride.

315
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:03,861
I like his whole ride.

316
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:06,020
I kind of like Etsy and then the sec,

317
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,900
I thought she'll make a one
the second round and the third.

318
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,590
But the gift of [inaudible] Resource,

319
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,260
he did not look like a world beater.

320
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,280
No Shit.

321
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,113
No.

322
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,631
Interesting.

323
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:16,580
Maybe they're UFC got
rid of them just in time.

324
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,800
It's too bad because
against Chris Weidman,

325
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,000
he looked like a bad mother fucker.

326
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:20,571
That Joe,

327
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,250
I don't think Beltmore
gets enough respect.

328
00:07:22,251 --> 00:07:24,320
Their guys are fucking
tough at the top level.

329
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:24,821
Like that's true.

330
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:27,980
So Maaco hasn't lost the fight and
how long yet spend for steroids,

331
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,210
but he's won like six in a row.

332
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,170
He's a motherfucker.

333
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,063
He is a motherfucker.

334
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,330
Do you see when you knocked out Melvin?

335
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:32,840
Yeah.

336
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,673
Like those,

337
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,131
look at that.

338
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:37,850
I boom Bella towards going to
be a tough going for everybody.

339
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:38,840
I think that's true.

340
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,771
I think that's true.

341
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:43,670
And that also highlights how fucking
good Rory Macdonald actually is.

342
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:44,180
Look at.

343
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,310
Look at Larkin not doing well.

344
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:46,551
Yeah,

345
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,830
well Lauren's got owed by Paul Daley is,

346
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,760
you know when you stand
in front of Paul Daley,

347
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,860
Paul Daley throws bad.

348
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:53,300
I talk in bombs.

349
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,520
That left hand is just
a ridiculous weapon.

350
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,080
We'll look at Ben Henderson.

351
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,090
He's struggling.

352
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,900
Ben Henderson was on down sod.

353
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,820
He was on the downside
when he went there though.

354
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,181
True.

355
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:03,430
But the struggle city then.

356
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:04,264
That's just rough.

357
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,950
Dave's trying to go one 70 ah,

358
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,971
that was not a gun.

359
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,260
The guy fought nightmare.

360
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,340
Phil Davis did well,

361
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,230
but you know a Ryan Bader beat him.

362
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:16,760
You know Ryan Bader who was probably
never going to be the champ in the UFC

363
00:08:16,761 --> 00:08:17,660
light heavyweight division.

364
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,590
Now you never know.

365
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,430
You never know.

366
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,180
Jon Jones.

367
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,590
Jon Jones in,

368
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,690
he was really not.

369
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,720
It was everyone though.

370
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,060
They nobody can.

371
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:27,140
That title John was there.

372
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:27,771
You know,

373
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:28,770
you gotta wonder man.

374
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,260
You got to wonder what the fuck.

375
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:33,830
Actually happened when it
came to this steroid stuff.

376
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:34,290
I was,

377
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,110
I talked to Novitsky like a lot of these,

378
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:36,741
these,

379
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:37,310
um,

380
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:42,310
websites were posting that if John Jones
could provide a supplement that had

381
00:08:43,551 --> 00:08:44,570
that stuff in it,

382
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,460
he wouldn't get a suspension.

383
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,320
It is possible that he
wouldn't get a suspension.

384
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,440
Novitsky said they just totally took
me out of context and that's not what I

385
00:08:51,441 --> 00:08:52,040
said at all.

386
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,221
Yeah.

387
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:57,221
I listened to what he was actually is it
is possible to have tainted supplements

388
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,740
and people have proven in the past.

389
00:08:59,741 --> 00:09:02,670
So there's something in a supplement
and if you can prove that you took it

390
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,870
completely accidentally,

391
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:04,770
which guys have,

392
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,410
you know who did that is um,

393
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:06,900
uh,

394
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,733
10 means,

395
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,011
yeah,

396
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:08,731
the dirty bird,

397
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:11,220
but he got suspended for a
few months even even though,

398
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,260
but a few months for John would be a win.

399
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,100
Yeah.

400
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,340
That wouldn't be shit with him.

401
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,380
With his history.

402
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:17,370
It's tough to believe.

403
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:18,000
It's just,

404
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,631
I want to believe,

405
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:20,070
I want to believe too so bad.

406
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:20,970
I won't back so bad.

407
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,510
And I think the UFC needs them so,

408
00:09:22,511 --> 00:09:24,180
so they need them so bad right now.

409
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:26,100
What are you excited for these days?

410
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,233
See,

411
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,020
go ahead.

412
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,853
Go ahead Eddie.

413
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,420
I'm finally saw that documentary.

414
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:31,254
ICARUS.

415
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,501
Oh,

416
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:32,031
it's fucking him.

417
00:09:32,031 --> 00:09:32,790
Holy Shit.

418
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,571
Fucking amazing.

419
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:33,840
Right?

420
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,860
That's the Russian doping.

421
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,610
Yes.

422
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,320
Didn't know anything about that movie.

423
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,020
And let's say Alex
Jones said the Russians,

424
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,520
they're sneaking into
the laboratories there

425
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,920
in the middle of the night and
they're switching the urine.

426
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:47,461
The Asian,

427
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:47,851
the beach.

428
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,361
I'm telling you,

429
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:48,781
I know this,

430
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,230
that I have an inside sources.

431
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,021
How could they do that?

432
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:52,770
It's impossible.

433
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,400
Yes.

434
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,180
I believe that would be the
end of Alex Jones right there.

435
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,783
Maybe

436
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,920
that sounds crazy that they were
like breaking into the opposite.

437
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,940
Switching the pisses.

438
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:09,061
Well,

439
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:10,290
they did it in Russia though.

440
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,730
It was in Sochi.

441
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:13,560
They won 13 gold medals,

442
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,940
gold medals.

443
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,690
Everyone was dirty to do ted.

444
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,580
Everyone was dirty.

445
00:10:17,581 --> 00:10:19,440
That guy's in serious hiding right now.

446
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,011
Hell yeah,

447
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:20,461
he is.

448
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:24,420
He's like fucking Nigga got him tucked
away and homeboy who was worried about

449
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:24,511
them,

450
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:24,960
right?

451
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,440
Oh yeah,

452
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:25,591
yeah.

453
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:29,580
He was saying he has that he's had like
depression before and then try to commit

454
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:33,000
suicide before that scandal first broke
out in Russia when he was freaking out.

455
00:10:33,001 --> 00:10:34,580
He was in Russia and he
was on the phone going,

456
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,230
they're going to kill it
because I need to get,

457
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:38,640
I need a plane ticket out here.

458
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,640
I was shocked that he was
able to leave the country.

459
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,390
Yeah.

460
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:45,390
What did you think that they were like
they would have someone on his ass.

461
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,811
Well,

462
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,860
Bryan Fogel,

463
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:48,090
who was the director of it,

464
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:51,420
was on my podcast and he explained to
me how they didn't think that he was a

465
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:53,090
flight risk and they,

466
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,190
cause he was such the
mastermind of the program,

467
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,050
they never thought that
he was going to take off.

468
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,140
There's a bunch of reasons why he cited
on the podcasts that I can't totally

469
00:11:01,141 --> 00:11:03,870
recall why they didn't think
that he was going to take off,

470
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,310
but obviously they fucked that one up.

471
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,690
Super fucked up.

472
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,870
He was all see CEO.

473
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,190
Well,

474
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,240
you know what's crazy dude?

475
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:13,470
How Wada the world antidoping agency and
the International Olympic Committee are

476
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:14,610
all in bed together.

477
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:15,930
They're not policing each other.

478
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:17,550
Why does not policing the IOC?

479
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:18,570
It's bullshit.

480
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:20,520
That's why they let the Russians in.

481
00:11:20,521 --> 00:11:22,770
Even though they knew the
Russians cheated in Sochi,

482
00:11:22,771 --> 00:11:25,890
they had irrefutable proof
that they cheated like that.

483
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,970
All the stuff that you've seen,

484
00:11:26,971 --> 00:11:28,170
that Netflix documentary,

485
00:11:28,171 --> 00:11:29,610
ICARUS is 100% true.

486
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,890
They still let him compete in Rio.

487
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,480
All they did is they throw him a bone.

488
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:33,751
They said,

489
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:33,961
yeah,

490
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:35,820
we're going to take out
the track and field team.

491
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:36,030
These.

492
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,440
This track and field team has to go,

493
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,540
so they took the track and field team out.

494
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,590
They left wrestling.

495
00:11:40,591 --> 00:11:42,720
Gymnastics all is a dirty,

496
00:11:42,721 --> 00:11:43,111
dirty,

497
00:11:43,111 --> 00:11:44,130
dirty athletes.

498
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,250
They probably rush,

499
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:45,651
probably say,

500
00:11:45,651 --> 00:11:46,500
hey listen guys,

501
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,960
if you guys have my back,

502
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,690
we're going to go after you
because everybody's doing.

503
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:52,411
Everybody's doing it.

504
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:56,130
That's all we'll say else you
got sign is 100% doing it.

505
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,730
This degree has been
busted a little bit though.

506
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,680
We busted.

507
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,230
Yeah.

508
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,250
American Olympian.

509
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,383
How?

510
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,410
How come on hundred percent a hundred
percent all by all the possible like

511
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:08,380
Russia?

512
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:08,681
No,

513
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:10,630
not like Russia because
it's not state sponsored.

514
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:12,130
But if you don't think
a lot of them are on it,

515
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,570
the amount of money that you can meet.

516
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,210
He was,

517
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,070
Brian was explaining it.

518
00:12:15,071 --> 00:12:15,310
It's like,

519
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,810
think about someone like Phelps,

520
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:17,051
right?

521
00:12:17,051 --> 00:12:17,884
Michael Phelps,

522
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,440
because he won because
he won the gold medal.

523
00:12:20,441 --> 00:12:22,210
You know how many gold
medals you want to shit load.

524
00:12:22,211 --> 00:12:22,480
Right.

525
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,970
Most of us.

526
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:25,960
That guy is a huge celebrity.

527
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:27,190
He's wealthy.

528
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,450
Whose phone was that?

529
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,240
That's a us.

530
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,330
The Russian hack on it.

531
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:32,164
He's fine.

532
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,243
The Russians.

533
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,360
The Russians got Eddie.

534
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:34,871
Um,

535
00:12:34,871 --> 00:12:36,430
so because of that,

536
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,361
because of that,

537
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:39,550
that guy makes fucking
millions of dollars a year.

538
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,410
But now go to the silver medalist.

539
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,550
Who is that guy?

540
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,990
Who fucks that guy?

541
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:44,531
Ryan Lochte.

542
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:44,820
Yeah,

543
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,400
but who,

544
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,120
who is he?

545
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,750
No one knows.

546
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,460
He's a liar.

547
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,700
No one.

548
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,533
The blue here.

549
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,600
That's the guy that got

550
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,640
Rio pretending that they were robbing him.

551
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:56,381
Yeah,

552
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:56,741
he was like,

553
00:12:56,741 --> 00:12:58,180
the police had me at gunpoint.

554
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:58,690
They did.

555
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,100
You broke a bathroom door.

556
00:13:00,101 --> 00:13:00,934
You piece of shit.

557
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:01,660
Yeah.

558
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,021
He was like,

559
00:13:02,021 --> 00:13:02,351
Dad May,

560
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:03,340
I can point that told me,

561
00:13:03,341 --> 00:13:03,950
get on the floor.

562
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,660
And I said,

563
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,950
fucking make me

564
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:07,720
like,

565
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:07,931
Bro,

566
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:09,010
you up white jeans on a few.

567
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,910
If you got on the ground,

568
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:10,810
why don't they dirty at all?

569
00:13:10,811 --> 00:13:11,644
He's like,

570
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,521
I don't know,

571
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:13,354
clean ground,

572
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,081
you know,

573
00:13:14,081 --> 00:13:14,914
Brazil and

574
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,350
now he's just like fucking
laughing stock of all times.

575
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,790
It's just a big old liar when possible
to win the hundred meters without being

576
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:25,624
on juice.

577
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,870
You know that guy a Victor
Conte from the ball scandal,

578
00:13:28,871 --> 00:13:33,130
that guy that hooked up Barry bonds and
all those people with the in detectable

579
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,720
ultimate snitch of all time.

580
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,160
The ultimate snitch cause he,

581
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:40,610
he got out of jail and then immediately
started stitch to niche away.

582
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,591
Snitch,

583
00:13:41,591 --> 00:13:45,520
snitch darn says the entire track
and field sport is a dirty sport.

584
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,450
He said all of them.

585
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:47,230
He's like,

586
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:47,450
dude,

587
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,220
he was like,

588
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,053
think about Jamaica.

589
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,440
Jamaica wins all these gold medals.

590
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,573
He's like,

591
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,623
what's going on?

592
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,200
Why?

593
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,621
Why do they,

594
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:55,030
why are they winning gold medals?

595
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:55,691
Like what's happening?

596
00:13:55,691 --> 00:13:55,891
He said,

597
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:56,740
let me tell you what's happening.

598
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,170
They have a very
sophisticated drug program.

599
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,050
Jamaica,

600
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,330
like they're not known for being,

601
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,250
they've never been known
for being sprinters.

602
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:04,031
Like,

603
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,140
that's not their thing.

604
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:09,730
It's kind of knew that that's their
thing and that the best ever at it do we

605
00:14:09,731 --> 00:14:12,430
just think it's the fucking plantation?

606
00:14:12,431 --> 00:14:13,450
Like what do you think it is?

607
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:13,881
Well,

608
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:15,700
what do you think they're eating?

609
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,080
One of the things that Fogel pointed out,

610
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:17,321
it's like,

611
00:14:17,321 --> 00:14:20,650
we remember when Ben Johnson got
tested positive when he fought,

612
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,101
when he,

613
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:21,490
uh,

614
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:22,930
actually raced against Carl Lewis.

615
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,560
Remember that?

616
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,520
He's kind of a big deal.

617
00:14:24,521 --> 00:14:26,800
He was Super Jack Jack Gold chain.

618
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,630
Apparently Carl Lewis tested positive too.

619
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,051
You have,

620
00:14:30,051 --> 00:14:31,900
they're all doing it all
over tested positive.

621
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:36,400
It's just that Ben Johnson's levels
were so off the fucking charts.

622
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:37,601
They were like Jesus.

623
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:39,550
But that was the first year
that they were testing.

624
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,860
It's like pride data before,

625
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,193
it's like pride days.

626
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:42,730
Yeah,

627
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,563
like pride days.

628
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:44,523
And that makes you think,

629
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,543
I hate to say this,

630
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,710
but it really makes you think about fate.

631
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:49,240
Or there's Ben Johnson
back in the day sign.

632
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,231
That's a good picture.

633
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,160
But get a picture of him mid sprint.

634
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,551
Jamie,

635
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,260
you can see how fucking Jack,

636
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:54,850
I'm a fight.

637
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,683
He was,

638
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,470
he was so fucking fast.

639
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:58,453
Look that

640
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,310
he's so big.

641
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,320
It was so big for a track and field.

642
00:15:03,321 --> 00:15:04,880
Carl Lewis looks he has aids back then.

643
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,500
Look at how jacked Ben John,

644
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,970
he looks like Melvin Manhoef.

645
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:08,631
That's correct.

646
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:08,790
Like,

647
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,710
like that kind of build.

648
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,700
Take Adrian Peterson.

649
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,420
So these,

650
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,253
these,

651
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,370
these guys are all,

652
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,350
but they're all freshmen.

653
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,770
They're all on something.

654
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,150
Every one of them's on something.

655
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,250
No white guys got ahold of some good shit.

656
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,120
Go to that one.

657
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,990
Go to that one.

658
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,050
The one above that.

659
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:25,220
Jesus Christ rock.

660
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:25,971
Yeah.

661
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,810
Love sitting in the fucking sprint.

662
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,390
The 100 meter dash.

663
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:31,893
It's not hard.

664
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,560
We get juice to the gills.

665
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,563
Not thing.

666
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,990
Where's the white stores?

667
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:40,761
Yeah,

668
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:41,360
it's not,

669
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,180
we're not spraying.

670
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,670
Guys aren't willing to go that deep.

671
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,890
We just don't know what
we got to go full bane.

672
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,671
I wonder.

673
00:15:46,671 --> 00:15:48,440
I wonder what it is and get his eyes.

674
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,070
First of all,

675
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,770
what the fuck was he taking
over his eyes turn yellow.

676
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,790
That's what they had said.

677
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:56,660
That his liver was struggling to deal
with all the steroids in the system and it

678
00:15:56,661 --> 00:15:58,460
was making the whites of his eyes yellow.

679
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:58,761
Damn.

680
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:01,250
He still beat the record
with that Timex watch on.

681
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,160
That's some powerful shit.

682
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,720
Why is it a Timex slow you
down that heavy ass basic.

683
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:11,360
Watch that though.

684
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,610
But that wouldn't really
hold your aerodynamics.

685
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,620
My man's not a bad pen.

686
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:16,670
The gold chain.

687
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,770
The fucking Rick Ross gold chains.

688
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,431
Gold chains,

689
00:16:19,431 --> 00:16:20,180
a big one.

690
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,690
He went,

691
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,300
I'm going to go to star coaches.

692
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,490
Try to have an intervention.

693
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,730
Say Dude fix bro.

694
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,870
No bitches like gold.

695
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,700
I know bitches.

696
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:32,880
And I know that arguments.

697
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,561
So powerful.

698
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:38,050
G Shock Watch and how you shooting it?

699
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,440
Watch that fun.

700
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,040
He does have yellow eyes.

701
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:44,270
Many looks like a leopard.

702
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,510
Like he's ready to leap on you
and no one said anything like Bro,

703
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:51,650
your eyes and that watcher
giveaway going on with your eyes.

704
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,130
Oh,

705
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,800
it's gotta be the first of all time.

706
00:16:54,801 --> 00:16:55,620
And this kind of tracking.

707
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,300
Who's that guy?

708
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,133
Ben Johnson.

709
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,210
That's Ben Johnson for a while.

710
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:02,270
He was sending both farm maybe?

711
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:02,870
Yeah.

712
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,920
Is that Ben Johnson there?

713
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:06,050
Jack Know Hussein ball was another child.

714
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,360
Who were the fees the
older guys of all time,

715
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,010
like you said,

716
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:09,710
false number one.

717
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,460
Carl Lewis over whenever you saying
ball has the best time of all time.

718
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:16,840
Then at the Ben Johnson Bolt Lewis,

719
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:17,930
how many can you get?

720
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,310
How many sprinters can you name?

721
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:20,990
Well,

722
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,310
it was seen bullying Jones.

723
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:22,910
Yeah,

724
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,451
females.

725
00:17:23,451 --> 00:17:24,081
But again,

726
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:24,914
she came out,

727
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,780
she snitched on herself.

728
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,490
You ever seen a snitch on yourself?

729
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:28,960
Why?

730
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,140
Why she a snitch on herself?

731
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,030
Because I think there was
some rumors and she was like,

732
00:17:32,031 --> 00:17:33,470
I can't handle this anymore.

733
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,940
It was Jews to the gills.

734
00:17:34,941 --> 00:17:35,550
I got a dick,

735
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,383
Joe man,

736
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,511
Hussein bolt.

737
00:17:38,511 --> 00:17:39,141
Hussein bolt.

738
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:39,800
We'll same bolt.

739
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,530
Tyson gay.

740
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:40,730
Ooh.

741
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:40,971
Oh,

742
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:41,691
Justin Gatlin.

743
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:42,241
Tyson gay.

744
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:42,641
I know those.

745
00:17:42,641 --> 00:17:43,520
That's a rough name.

746
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:44,751
It's a rough name.

747
00:17:44,751 --> 00:17:45,380
Tyson gay.

748
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,750
There ain't a white guy
and fucking now Compton

749
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:50,940
comp.

750
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,151
Wow.

751
00:17:51,151 --> 00:17:53,460
Look how far down you got
to go to get to somebody,

752
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,020
you know.

753
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,180
Hussein bolt number 34
like more each green.

754
00:17:57,181 --> 00:17:59,370
Like when do you get down to Ben Johnson?

755
00:17:59,371 --> 00:18:01,200
Did they have them on there
or did they take it off?

756
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,490
Yeah,

757
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,530
they took him off yet pushing Coleman.

758
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:06,240
I bet that they shouldn't take them off.

759
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,511
I mean,

760
00:18:06,511 --> 00:18:07,440
if you want to punish him,

761
00:18:07,441 --> 00:18:07,951
punish him,

762
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,030
but you can't take them off.

763
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,680
It's like what they did with the,

764
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,280
um,

765
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,540
with the Tour de France,

766
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,710
they uh,

767
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,300
they took all the ones that
Lance Armstrong one there,

768
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,040
they removed him as a winner.

769
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,210
He won like eight times,

770
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,340
but everybody was dirty.

771
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,500
I had to go down to 15th
place to find a guy.

772
00:18:25,501 --> 00:18:26,400
18 was it 18?

773
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,243
Anything was eight.

774
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,440
How about in the Mit guy who didn't test,

775
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,410
but how about a major league baseball?

776
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:31,771
Like,

777
00:18:31,771 --> 00:18:31,981
no,

778
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:32,491
barely budge.

779
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:35,160
Can't be in the hall of fame
because you got tested positive,

780
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,940
stupid.

781
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,110
Who the fuck you think was stolen?

782
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:37,650
The pitches,

783
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,420
their juice to the gills to you fucks.

784
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:44,100
And what happens with like Sammy Sosa
and mark McGwire will have you seen Sammy

785
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,270
Sosa?

786
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,103
That's a

787
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,320
great angle.

788
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,141
Well he had locked it up.

789
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:51,240
Nice professional triangle right there.

790
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,530
He knew exactly what he was doing.

791
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,071
Yeah,

792
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:53,904
that's pretty deep.

793
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,500
It took a while to cinch it in,

794
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:56,334
but

795
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,483
it's a wrap.

796
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,280
Oh No,

797
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,100
shit.

798
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,933
He looked up.

799
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:02,361
Oh,

800
00:19:02,361 --> 00:19:03,150
the rounds over.

801
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,990
No Way.

802
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,160
Tighten the end of the round.

803
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,600
I think that's why I
went for that arm bar.

804
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,380
Wait,

805
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,410
did he tap that on?

806
00:19:09,411 --> 00:19:10,230
But I really wasn't him.

807
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,680
Was it?

808
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,513
I don't know.

809
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:12,660
No,

810
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,493
the ring.

811
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:13,880
The ring?

812
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,713
Yeah.

813
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,860
That was a good ending.

814
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,131
Oh,

815
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:18,210
so it was the end of the round.

816
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,290
Okay,

817
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,123
so we got one more.

818
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,620
But if you want to see what happens
when you don't make the hall of fame,

819
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:23,400
look at,

820
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,580
have you seen Sammy Sosa lately?

821
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,630
Why is the referee checking him
his eyes after awhile he got,

822
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,190
he took some punches when he was down.

823
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:30,360
Uh,

824
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:30,571
yeah,

825
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:31,680
I've seen Sammy Sosa lately.

826
00:19:31,681 --> 00:19:32,910
Like if something went crazy,

827
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:33,690
became a white guy.

828
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:34,170
Crazy.

829
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:34,320
Yeah.

830
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,210
He just went from the back to triangle.

831
00:19:36,211 --> 00:19:36,540
Dude,

832
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,800
that's totally pro.

833
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,040
Oh,

834
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,030
this guy's really good.

835
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,660
Oh Dude.

836
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,500
He fucked him up with that.

837
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:40,681
Right?

838
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:41,790
This guy's good dude.

839
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,600
Sammy Sosa is a different human being.

840
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,880
I need to acknowledge this.

841
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,870
What did he do?

842
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:46,800
Look at his skin.

843
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,030
He looks like Michael Jackson.

844
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,301
Yeah.

845
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:48,960
What happened?

846
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,980
What the fuck?

847
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,720
I'm not sure if he's talking about it.

848
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,860
Has He talked about Jamie?

849
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:53,700
It looks like you just went,

850
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:54,091
fuck it.

851
00:19:54,091 --> 00:19:54,924
I want to be white.

852
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,320
Go the one in the pink hat.

853
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,581
Go to pink hat,

854
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:00,150
sir.

855
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:00,660
Okay.

856
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,270
That's the greatest baseball player
of all time off for a second.

857
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:05,650
That's what happens.

858
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:06,630
We don't like isn't the whole thing.

859
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:06,901
Well,

860
00:20:06,901 --> 00:20:09,720
he might've fucked his body
up with all the steroids.

861
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,340
Mcguire's he gay.

862
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,213
Are you saying he's gay?

863
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:13,741
Is that what you say?

864
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:14,160
Open.

865
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,320
That's what happened when you don't like
gays in the hall of fame that we just

866
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:16,620
said.

867
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,610
Daphne didn't say that.

868
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,690
I don't think he's gay.

869
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,460
I think Sammy Sosa still lays pipe.

870
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,690
I even though he's weighing both.

871
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:22,470
Heard gay?

872
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:22,760
No.

873
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,460
Fuck No.

874
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,293
He just said,

875
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,473
hey,

876
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,060
let's just be real clear.

877
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:35,490
None of us have a problem with gay people.

878
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,230
I love,

879
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,410
I don't know if gay people

880
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,650
wearing a pink hat because he's gay.

881
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,630
I'm cool with it.

882
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:42,331
I don't pink shoes.

883
00:20:42,331 --> 00:20:43,020
I don't give a fuck.

884
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,490
Who was you guys talking to Dick?

885
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm looking at this though.

886
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,481
Yeah.

887
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:50,350
What happened?

888
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,030
So what does he say happened to him like,

889
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,660
because it's weird.

890
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,393
He just,

891
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,540
okay,

892
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,440
that's a white guy.

893
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,161
Yeah,

894
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:00,641
it's crazy.

895
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:01,710
And he was so dark.

896
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,920
He was dark black.

897
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,310
Yeah.

898
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,430
He was out with a Tan.

899
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,240
Maybe you got it was in the tanning.

900
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:06,520
Not,

901
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:06,601
no,

902
00:21:06,601 --> 00:21:06,710
no,

903
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,781
no,

904
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:07,614
no.

905
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,820
Everything's changed.

906
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,833
You know what?

907
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,010
There is cream.

908
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,460
There's cream that uh,

909
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:16,450
some women do use to lighten their skin.

910
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,141
Oh,

911
00:21:17,141 --> 00:21:17,831
he had his over.

912
00:21:17,831 --> 00:21:18,490
What happened?

913
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,230
He admits he bleaches the skin.

914
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:21,350
Oh,

915
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:22,840
humidity bleaches the skin.

916
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,160
Oh Wow.

917
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,180
That's weird.

918
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,390
I wonder why he wants to do that too.

919
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,320
That's really just the
second Michael Jackson.

920
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:29,551
No,

921
00:21:29,551 --> 00:21:29,650
no,

922
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:29,831
no,

923
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,450
because Michael Jackson had what I have.

924
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:32,500
He had to his condition,

925
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,880
but he did bleach your skin though.

926
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,743
He did

927
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,400
it out.

928
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:36,880
Yeah,

929
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,070
but that's not what Sammy Sosa's doing.

930
00:21:39,071 --> 00:21:41,260
Sammy Sosa just decided to
be able to wipes to be white.

931
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,633
People have done that.

932
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,310
Or maybe Michael Jackson's
just wanting to be white,

933
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:46,700
but he used that as an excuse.

934
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:46,840
No,

935
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,480
he legit and had like a skin thing and
it started to spread and he's like,

936
00:21:49,481 --> 00:21:49,751
fuck,

937
00:21:49,751 --> 00:21:50,620
I don't want to look like this.

938
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,120
And just went full spectrum.

939
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,160
Have you seen some models who have it?

940
00:21:54,161 --> 00:21:56,080
They're gorgeous and
they're just rocket that.

941
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,120
I think it's sexiest.

942
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:58,923
Harlow.

943
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,490
I called the zebra models.

944
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,950
They're sexy as fuck.

945
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,333
They got like a cool,

946
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,470
can we see them Jamie?

947
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:05,261
Well,

948
00:22:05,261 --> 00:22:07,980
it's only one role model
is there's any Harlow,

949
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,870
well I call him z.

950
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:10,391
Here's the triangle.

951
00:22:10,391 --> 00:22:10,601
Right?

952
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:12,010
But this is not the end of the fight.

953
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:12,150
Well,

954
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:13,180
like how did this fight end?

955
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,120
Maybe he gave up at the corner
and the car was the last round.

956
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,140
I think that was the
third to decision homeboy.

957
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,670
We're doing the worst job of
paying attention to this fight.

958
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,900
Dan Hardee with a beautiful green jacket.

959
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:27,430
Powerful joker colors.

960
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,663
Um,

961
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,740
so Sammy Sosa just decided to be a white.

962
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:37,030
Just fuck it and say enough is
this now I can do a white guy.

963
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:37,900
Go Black.

964
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,680
No,

965
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,000
I mean you can be a Tanner

966
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:47,140
tape gets Tate Tate
did a movie and Tahiti.

967
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,300
Well you don't get black features.

968
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,711
Well no,

969
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:52,030
but you don't get black skin.

970
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:53,830
You get like 10 super dark.

971
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,720
Take got so fucking dark.

972
00:22:55,721 --> 00:22:55,901
No,

973
00:22:55,901 --> 00:22:56,350
Bro.

974
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,900
I'm talking about going straight black,

975
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,560
black,

976
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,140
black,

977
00:22:59,140 --> 00:22:59,920
black fit.

978
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,080
There was a Maurice Povich.

979
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:03,770
That was Maurice poppage.

980
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,530
What's his name?

981
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:05,363
Maurice.

982
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:07,991
Mcgriff morning.

983
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:08,201
Right?

984
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:08,591
Black.

985
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:09,424
You'd be more ready.

986
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,683
Exactly.

987
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,163
Publix.

988
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:14,470
There was a girl,

989
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,300
some white girl who wants to be black.

990
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,120
Oh,

991
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,953
you seen this?

992
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:18,191
Oh,

993
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,120
she said cash me outside,

994
00:23:19,121 --> 00:23:19,630
girl.

995
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:19,781
No,

996
00:23:19,781 --> 00:23:19,961
no,

997
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:20,081
no,

998
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:20,231
no,

999
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:20,351
no,

1000
00:23:20,351 --> 00:23:20,501
no,

1001
00:23:20,501 --> 00:23:20,621
no.

1002
00:23:20,621 --> 00:23:21,071
She's like,

1003
00:23:21,071 --> 00:23:22,000
really wants to be black.

1004
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,560
It's a white woman who,

1005
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,310
who uh,

1006
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:27,070
and the audience is all black and
they fucking can't stand there.

1007
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:28,680
And they're just baring.

1008
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:31,030
Or is that the home girl
who got fired from her job?

1009
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,511
Look at this.

1010
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:32,590
What Sammy Sosa says.

1011
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,400
What happened was that I had been using
the cream for a long time and that

1012
00:23:36,401 --> 00:23:40,210
combined with the bright TV lights made
my face look wider than it really is.

1013
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,190
I don't think I look like Michael Jackson.

1014
00:23:42,191 --> 00:23:42,880
He added,

1015
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,710
apparently Sosa has kept up,

1016
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:46,250
has used cream over the years,

1017
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:51,140
which has led him to appear even wider
than he did in 2009 so he's been just

1018
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:53,750
getting wider and wider and wider.

1019
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,260
Okay.

1020
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,580
Go higher there.

1021
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,450
It's a bleaching cream that I applied
before going to bed and widens my skin

1022
00:23:59,451 --> 00:23:59,781
tone.

1023
00:23:59,781 --> 00:24:01,550
Social said during the
appearance of Univision's,

1024
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:01,701
blah,

1025
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:01,821
blah,

1026
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:01,941
blah,

1027
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:02,061
blah,

1028
00:24:02,061 --> 00:24:02,690
blah.

1029
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,390
It's a cream that I have that
it used to soften my skin,

1030
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,950
but it has bleached me some.

1031
00:24:06,951 --> 00:24:08,060
I'm not a racist.

1032
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,770
I live my life happily.

1033
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,390
What bleached me some sir,

1034
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,920
you were completely a light man.

1035
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,781
Racist.

1036
00:24:14,781 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm not a racist.

1037
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,300
Maybe like there was like a super racist
white check that he was trying to fuck

1038
00:24:20,570 --> 00:24:20,991
and he's like,

1039
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,220
there's only one way and say,

1040
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,040
hey guys,

1041
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,420
I got to be,

1042
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,170
you never know you never go full
white unless she was just bad.

1043
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:28,004
She just was like,

1044
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,200
like Taj Tennessee racist
but with big old titties,

1045
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:37,850
big plump pink titties and now he's
just flocked to take any little waist.

1046
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,930
But I just put on a bleaching cream.

1047
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,660
I don't know that Michael Jackson cream.

1048
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,511
It's no big deal.

1049
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:46,760
I put a little bit on before
I go to sleep at night.

1050
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,960
It's a little bleaching cream.

1051
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,650
What's the ideal kind
of see what the problem.

1052
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,500
Meanwhile he said he's even lighter
than he was in 2009 I mean he's talking

1053
00:24:54,501 --> 00:24:56,120
about something that
happened eight years ago.

1054
00:24:56,121 --> 00:24:57,230
He's lied to than that now.

1055
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,090
He's also a little mentally unstable
cause he also has white man here now he's

1056
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,930
like the straight white like
fuck God damn dark Tate.

1057
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:06,290
God.

1058
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,990
Jesus Christ takes a savage.

1059
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,153
Yeah.

1060
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,520
I mean he's Tan,

1061
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,440
but you wouldn't confuse
him for being black.

1062
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,930
Well you would if he had
black features and black hair.

1063
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,710
No,

1064
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,221
for sure.

1065
00:25:19,221 --> 00:25:20,090
If he had an Afro,

1066
00:25:20,091 --> 00:25:21,770
you would say that's a
light skinned black guy.

1067
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:22,430
You think,

1068
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,180
fuck yeah,

1069
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,013
100%.

1070
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,860
Like a dark.

1071
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,910
Come back to that picture again.

1072
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,300
Look at that.

1073
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,780
Got My IA as dark as fuck.

1074
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,600
And we get Photoshop Steve to put,

1075
00:25:32,601 --> 00:25:33,290
uh,

1076
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,090
um,

1077
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,470
I mean if you change is Eric Curl on?

1078
00:25:35,471 --> 00:25:36,380
It's probably already on it.

1079
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,131
Yeah,

1080
00:25:37,131 --> 00:25:37,964
he's probably right.

1081
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,650
Probably all be blank.

1082
00:25:39,651 --> 00:25:40,484
Better than others.

1083
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:46,610
My favorite meme a online is that
one black dude is going like this.

1084
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,893
Oh yeah.

1085
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,973
Yeah.

1086
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,960
You never get in the eye.

1087
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,800
It looks like the Reading Rainbow Guy.

1088
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,030
I don't know who that guy is.

1089
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,470
Derek Brunson.

1090
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,420
Machida back.

1091
00:25:59,660 --> 00:25:59,871
Yeah.

1092
00:25:59,871 --> 00:26:01,670
Against Derek Brunson
can help for a minute.

1093
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,693
The,

1094
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:06,200
you can't get if you don't
get into a relationship.

1095
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,530
He looks like Ben Johnson a little bit.

1096
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,470
There's an animated Gif of him.

1097
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:13,011
Do it at two.

1098
00:26:13,011 --> 00:26:13,844
It's even better.

1099
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:14,720
And animated one.

1100
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,910
I haven't seen that one.

1101
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,440
Yeah,

1102
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:16,591
the,

1103
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:16,940
that,

1104
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:19,300
that's a part of them under the,

1105
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,410
there he is.

1106
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,610
That's the animated one.

1107
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,541
Who is this?

1108
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:27,374
Just some dude.

1109
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:27,561
Oh,

1110
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:28,394
it's amazing.

1111
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,930
He's a rapper.

1112
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,120
Do you know our problem?

1113
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,200
He's a Jamaican rapper.

1114
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,161
Did you know that?

1115
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:39,020
They have me cards now and
people like they have like games.

1116
00:26:39,021 --> 00:26:43,320
They play with meme cards and he's one
of the meme cards and there's always the

1117
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:43,810
one,

1118
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:44,190
there's

1119
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:46,620
the one where I forget who it is,

1120
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:49,100
some another rapper while
he's standing like this.

1121
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,943
Like what?

1122
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,960
Like that picture.

1123
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,660
Awesome.

1124
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,380
And then there was the,

1125
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:52,651
you know,

1126
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:52,741
the,

1127
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:56,750
the black lady with the Hump
for neck and two or what

1128
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,261
have you seen?

1129
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:04,530
The one of the kitties like in school
and he's like this and there's other,

1130
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,360
and it's like vegans when they haven't
talked about being a Vegan for a minute.

1131
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,880
That's hilarious.

1132
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:13,870
Yeah.

1133
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:14,491
See The meme,

1134
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:15,081
the Games,

1135
00:27:15,081 --> 00:27:15,230
see,

1136
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:15,571
look at this.

1137
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:16,650
It's a fucking game.

1138
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,990
You played this game like in the,

1139
00:27:18,991 --> 00:27:19,830
I don't know how it works,

1140
00:27:19,831 --> 00:27:22,590
but you deal these things
out like these popular memes.

1141
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,153
It's hilarious.

1142
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,800
Guy gets laid for that,

1143
00:27:25,801 --> 00:27:26,430
ma'am.

1144
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,950
Probably Damien Maia
versus Colby Covington.

1145
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,281
Ooh,

1146
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,114
that's an interesting,

1147
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,220
that's an interesting fight.

1148
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:32,851
You know what,

1149
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,031
man?

1150
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:33,870
I just switched Damien.

1151
00:27:33,871 --> 00:27:37,590
Why Maya was younger
because without this sauce,

1152
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,420
without the special sauce,

1153
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,310
you know he's like 40 years old now.

1154
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:41,971
Yeah,

1155
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,160
but I mean he said even when he was young,

1156
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:44,994
he was a beast.

1157
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:45,840
He's a beast,

1158
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,320
like to remember he went on the whole
kind of tear and then fly to Anderson.

1159
00:27:49,321 --> 00:27:50,670
Terrible fight back down,

1160
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,470
cut to 79 he's a beast again.

1161
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,410
He's still a beat.

1162
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:53,880
He's still,

1163
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,410
he's 100% of beach when she was young.

1164
00:27:55,411 --> 00:27:55,860
Why?

1165
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,230
Because I love the idea of a specialist.

1166
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm always fascinated by a specialist,

1167
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,390
by a guy who just does one thing
better than everybody else.

1168
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:07,020
Can he do it to somebody that's
been Estrin the fight I would do.

1169
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,390
It's been asking Damien Maia,

1170
00:28:08,391 --> 00:28:11,010
I wish Ben didn't retire
because I want that fight.

1171
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,810
Ben's never going to get in the UFC.

1172
00:28:12,811 --> 00:28:14,220
He talked way too much shit about,

1173
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,500
about Dana white like that.

1174
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,190
Those are those days still there.

1175
00:28:17,191 --> 00:28:19,860
I feel like Dana White didn't give
a fuck anymore that much money.

1176
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:20,930
Like what Ben asking me,

1177
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:21,930
I let them know don't give a fuck.

1178
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:22,830
I don't know man.

1179
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:25,350
Why have a men then what if
he talks more shit about you?

1180
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,270
You,

1181
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,103
we need ratings.

1182
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,590
Ben Asked her and doesn't give a f uh,

1183
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,140
he's,

1184
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,901
he's retiring,

1185
00:28:30,901 --> 00:28:31,200
right?

1186
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:31,860
Yeah.

1187
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,611
It's a bummer.

1188
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:33,444
Undefeated,

1189
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,351
retiring,

1190
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:34,950
undefeated.

1191
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,950
But it's interesting because the only
one who gave them any problems really was

1192
00:28:40,081 --> 00:28:45,081
a j here on j Iran got him to a split
decision a long time ago though.

1193
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:45,750
Yeah.

1194
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,561
But it doesn't matter.

1195
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:50,610
It was like a wrestler who could strike
a guy who was good enough to keep you

1196
00:28:50,611 --> 00:28:51,444
away,

1197
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,050
you know,

1198
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,750
good enough wrestling to keep it from
being a wrestling match and he could

1199
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,230
strike.

1200
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,390
But Ben evolved from there cause Ben with,

1201
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,201
with Woodley,

1202
00:28:58,201 --> 00:28:59,340
with all these old guys,

1203
00:28:59,341 --> 00:29:00,600
like he evolved his game.

1204
00:29:00,601 --> 00:29:01,800
So he talked to people and they're like,

1205
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:02,011
dude,

1206
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:02,490
he's dead.

1207
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,450
We can handle the stress.

1208
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,860
One guy that gave us some trouble,

1209
00:29:04,861 --> 00:29:09,861
some Russian Daggett Stan type of
wrestler guy who claimed it was on one FC,

1210
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,590
he was calling Ben outside.

1211
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:12,351
I could out Russell,

1212
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:12,441
you,

1213
00:29:12,441 --> 00:29:13,870
I'm gonna take you down real.

1214
00:29:13,871 --> 00:29:15,870
And he did and he was on them for awhile,

1215
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,980
but Ben still beat him.

1216
00:29:16,981 --> 00:29:17,641
He got him an arm.

1217
00:29:17,641 --> 00:29:18,361
Such a shame.

1218
00:29:18,361 --> 00:29:21,930
He never gotten the UFC man fucking
judge track except for that guy.

1219
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Everybody that he gets his mitts on as
soon as Ben like holds you or grabs you,

1220
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:31,890
his clinch is so high level that
you just can't break free of his,

1221
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,860
his clan,

1222
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,031
you know,

1223
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,380
it's a bummer is one of the reasons,

1224
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,580
obviously you talk shit to Dana,

1225
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:39,270
but that style for a lot of people
isn't going to sell paper views or get

1226
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,980
ratings because of that on wrestling,

1227
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:41,380
holding,

1228
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,213
holding people down.

1229
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,670
He hears he's getting good at summit.

1230
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:44,830
So many guys now too.

1231
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,121
She doesn't care,

1232
00:29:46,121 --> 00:29:46,954
but they're not going to.

1233
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,490
Here's the problem with that logic.

1234
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:52,120
Floyd Mayweather style of boxing
is not fan friendly either,

1235
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,050
but Floyd,

1236
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:55,870
major superstar before that
he did knock people out,

1237
00:29:55,871 --> 00:29:58,870
became the guy you'd either
pay to watch him lose or win.

1238
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,320
Huge draw [inaudible] not a big draw.

1239
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,350
Introduce him wasn't,

1240
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,890
he was not a huge drop before he
started talking shit to people.

1241
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,920
It wasn't a huge draw until
he became money Mayweather.

1242
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,630
I became the bad guy.

1243
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:11,880
That's when he became a huge drum.

1244
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,431
A bad guy,

1245
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:13,600
but also fought Oscar,

1246
00:30:13,601 --> 00:30:14,381
Dela Hoya,

1247
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:14,741
all the,

1248
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:17,670
all the superstars spend Africans that
come in the UFC and then go night.

1249
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,070
Here's,

1250
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,090
here's Connor Mcgregor,

1251
00:30:19,091 --> 00:30:20,480
some superstar there.

1252
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:21,670
The UFC is not going to do that.

1253
00:30:21,671 --> 00:30:22,780
He doesn't have the style either,

1254
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,880
but if he did that would be very,

1255
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:25,780
very interesting.

1256
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,140
Yeah,

1257
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:32,050
but but what I'm saying is that's the
only way that this guy could become famous

1258
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,340
is by shit talking.

1259
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,410
The shit talking is what's
going to make them famous.

1260
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,840
Like people wanting to see him lose.

1261
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,350
That's what makes a guy like that famous
because his style is very appealing to

1262
00:30:41,351 --> 00:30:42,520
guys like us that are like,

1263
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,640
I want to see if he can do is,

1264
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,260
you know what?

1265
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:48,280
It takes a while to evolve
and and be a good finisher.

1266
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,400
And at first for awhile they were just
taking people down and just owning them

1267
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,340
and controlling of John.

1268
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,120
But he's good at submitting
people now he gets,

1269
00:30:55,121 --> 00:30:56,830
he gets a great grappler overall.

1270
00:30:56,831 --> 00:30:57,251
It's great.

1271
00:30:57,251 --> 00:30:57,911
So now,

1272
00:30:57,911 --> 00:31:00,860
so now the w the Ben asks,

1273
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,910
can we have now you can't
compare them to the Ben.

1274
00:31:02,911 --> 00:31:04,120
Ask him from five years ago.

1275
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:05,290
That's gone.

1276
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,333
That's gone.

1277
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,580
There's a Ben ass grin that's going
to take you down and choke you out.

1278
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,121
Now Eddie,

1279
00:31:10,121 --> 00:31:10,960
that whole different,

1280
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,680
that's gone.

1281
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,030
He's retired and money will be,

1282
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:14,230
there's also the other,

1283
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,190
nobody's really return fc allowing him
to use knees to the head on the ground.

1284
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:18,820
What'd you say?

1285
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:21,160
One FC allowed him to use knees
to the head on the ground.

1286
00:31:21,161 --> 00:31:21,430
Right.

1287
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:21,941
It's a good point.

1288
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:22,150
Yeah.

1289
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,920
That's a big weapon and didn't kicks.

1290
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,470
You see Brett,

1291
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,900
what Brandon and bear did over there?

1292
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,520
Kicking dudes in the face,

1293
00:31:27,521 --> 00:31:29,110
kick him in the back of
the head and they're down.

1294
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:32,000
It's like a champion.

1295
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,893
Yeah.

1296
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,753
You think he's on the Jews?

1297
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:35,410
They took off.

1298
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,640
They took out the soccer kicks.

1299
00:31:36,641 --> 00:31:37,850
Now you have seen,

1300
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:38,740
well the,

1301
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,551
did you see,

1302
00:31:39,551 --> 00:31:40,030
um,

1303
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:44,630
a homeboy Roger Huerto
get SAS that was raw.

1304
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,360
That's why you can't have soccer kicks.

1305
00:31:46,361 --> 00:31:51,190
He was fighting a Brazilian who was a
big fella who was cutting to make one 70

1306
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:52,570
and Roger's not really a one seven.

1307
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,950
He was one 55 in the UFC decided to fight
one 70 and he was getting beat up and

1308
00:31:56,951 --> 00:32:00,790
then you went down and this dude's soccer
kicked him into the next fucking can't

1309
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:03,370
have that and be a professional sport.

1310
00:32:03,371 --> 00:32:04,190
It's just too,

1311
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,023
it's too brutal.

1312
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:05,771
I don't know,

1313
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:06,160
man.

1314
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:06,730
I mean,

1315
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:07,930
he hasn't really,

1316
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,710
he didn't go back on the trial.

1317
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,663
Yeah.

1318
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,490
I mean it was a brutal,

1319
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:13,240
brutal knockout.

1320
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,230
They're tough to watch.

1321
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:17,470
That one was particularly
that you see when cro,

1322
00:32:17,471 --> 00:32:18,730
cop kicked run waterman.

1323
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:19,481
I mean,

1324
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,281
it's fucking hard.

1325
00:32:20,281 --> 00:32:21,190
It's hard to watch.

1326
00:32:21,191 --> 00:32:23,470
But why is it harder to watch
than a regular head kick?

1327
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,580
That's my question.

1328
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:27,370
Is it because there's a lot of head kick,

1329
00:32:27,371 --> 00:32:31,870
you kind of move more with it and the
soccer kick you lying down already Carter

1330
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,610
to defend when you're lower.

1331
00:32:33,611 --> 00:32:36,220
I think it can generate power,

1332
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,240
right?

1333
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:37,660
Yeah,

1334
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,493
for sure.

1335
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:39,980
Like Charlie Brown kick someone in

1336
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,840
the face.

1337
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:44,870
I think I could kick someone
just as hard to the body.

1338
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:46,130
I don't know.

1339
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,390
I think you'd be surprised.

1340
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,730
You mean Dan kick harder on the ground?

1341
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,690
Fuck yes.

1342
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,460
Like think about an NFL kicker.

1343
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,170
Yeah,

1344
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,120
I like kicking like straight like that.

1345
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:56,451
No,

1346
00:32:56,451 --> 00:32:57,350
I don't think so dude.

1347
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,500
I'm pretty sure that I could kick just
as hard to the body as I could to the,

1348
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,100
to the ground.

1349
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,761
I don't think so.

1350
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:02,090
Joe.

1351
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,250
I think just kept question is up high.

1352
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,641
I don't,

1353
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:06,290
I think up high would lose something.

1354
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
I lose a little bit up high
just from like the leverage,

1355
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,120
but I think I did because I think your
leg going straight like this and low.

1356
00:33:14,121 --> 00:33:16,400
I think that's where the most
of the power is going to be.

1357
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,413
Right.

1358
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,270
And guaranteed all shit
and guaranteed all shit.

1359
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,350
Depends on what kind of kick,

1360
00:33:21,351 --> 00:33:23,330
cause here's the thing
you could spinning back,

1361
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:25,070
kick someone in the face
when they're down too.

1362
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,450
That's another thing to think about.

1363
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:27,943
Think about

1364
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,810
God attorney sign yours.

1365
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,661
Not all of them,

1366
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,330
but think about that like a dude gets hit.

1367
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,860
He goes down on one knee
and you flogging Jj.

1368
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,230
Gay People are gonna die.

1369
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:41,301
We're gonna die.

1370
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:41,540
Yeah,

1371
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,840
I mean if your face is right there and
you took a full power turning side kick

1372
00:33:44,841 --> 00:33:45,674
to the face,

1373
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:46,730
he'll get Brandon.

1374
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,930
He's so jack now.

1375
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,250
He's so thick.

1376
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,460
This is a,

1377
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,450
this is the one when he came the dude
and kicked him to the head when he was on

1378
00:33:53,451 --> 00:33:54,260
the ground,

1379
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,220
remember when he beat frank man,

1380
00:33:55,221 --> 00:33:55,491
it was like,

1381
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,920
I'm taking light heavyweight
and heavyweight over.

1382
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,080
Well you know what happened with him?

1383
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,260
Oh beautiful.

1384
00:34:00,261 --> 00:34:00,910
Straight left.

1385
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:04,430
He's looking at this soccer
kicks to the back of the head.

1386
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,390
That's shit's rough.

1387
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,300
Those kind of kicks to
the back of the header.

1388
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,010
Forget that noise.

1389
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:10,791
Brandon Pharaoh,

1390
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:11,451
he's a good guy,

1391
00:34:11,451 --> 00:34:11,750
man.

1392
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:11,841
Oh,

1393
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,820
he's a good guy.

1394
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:13,560
Great Guy.

1395
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,393
Good guy.

1396
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,800
I was always a fan of his,

1397
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:16,491
but you know,

1398
00:34:16,491 --> 00:34:19,640
he started out as a heavyweight and then
dropped down the light heavyweight with

1399
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:23,300
the big thing that happened to him in
the UFC was he went to this big prolonged

1400
00:34:23,301 --> 00:34:25,190
contract negotiation wanting to get paid.

1401
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,280
He wants to get paid and when he came
back to tremendous amount of pressure on

1402
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:28,401
him,

1403
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,500
he just didn't perform
the same as he did before.

1404
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,350
Then he fought Fabricio
for breeze over doom,

1405
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:36,650
got on top of him and put the squished
down on him and beat the shit out of him.

1406
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,090
Fabrizio was Mount,

1407
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,143
oh,

1408
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:41,720
this should be interesting.

1409
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,400
Like yawn,

1410
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:42,750
Blah.

1411
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,820
[inaudible] Mark Goddard again
in the motherfucking house.

1412
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,020
Who is the gentleman that,

1413
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:48,530
uh,

1414
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:48,821
the whole,

1415
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:49,654
which is fighting

1416
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:55,400
Devon Clark and Clark
do not know Mr Clock.

1417
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,350
There's the golden
snitch right to the left.

1418
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:57,621
Oh,

1419
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:58,454
I didn't see him.

1420
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,350
He ran a parents checking
piss right things.

1421
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:02,000
He's got a little magnifying glass.

1422
00:35:02,001 --> 00:35:02,201
Right?

1423
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:03,310
He doesn't have a hit out on you.

1424
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,213
Vials,

1425
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,450
shaking the files.

1426
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,520
Anybody should have a hit on him.

1427
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:09,770
It should be IMG or WME rather.

1428
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:11,590
Right people that bought an EOC,

1429
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,433
EOC.

1430
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:13,101
Dude,

1431
00:35:13,101 --> 00:35:14,660
you're fucking up our business.

1432
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,330
They should find that Russian
dude that they got in hiding.

1433
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,333
Bring him,

1434
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,660
bring him in June promotion.

1435
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,830
Give no Wicki Sona position and say,

1436
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,271
Look Jeff,

1437
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:26,150
you did a great job,

1438
00:35:26,151 --> 00:35:27,350
but we're going a different direction.

1439
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,030
They're going to give to,

1440
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:28,280
right.

1441
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,550
We've got a different job for you.

1442
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,880
Kick rocks and you're

1443
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:32,930
no,

1444
00:35:32,930 --> 00:35:33,763
keep them on.

1445
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,710
You don't want to fire him because
then they'll talk some shit.

1446
00:35:35,711 --> 00:35:36,111
Oh Jeff,

1447
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:36,560
we uh,

1448
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,170
you got a new,

1449
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,010
you actually in marketing.

1450
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:38,980
Yeah.

1451
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,500
You make amazing marketer.

1452
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:40,740
Yeah.

1453
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,720
We need you to run the social
media and shut the fuck up.

1454
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:43,121
Dump his.

1455
00:35:43,121 --> 00:35:46,420
Does he have them run the
UFC performance institute?

1456
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,220
Hey piss boy.

1457
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,053
You're just stating,

1458
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:48,990
hey piss boy,

1459
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:51,330
you stay at the UFC institute now
and just keep your mouth shut.

1460
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:51,721
You know what?

1461
00:35:51,721 --> 00:35:54,390
You're going to make your make shakes
now you're making shakes for the UFC.

1462
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:54,671
No,

1463
00:35:54,671 --> 00:35:54,871
no,

1464
00:35:54,871 --> 00:35:54,991
no.

1465
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:56,880
You got to give him a
prestigious position.

1466
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,270
No,

1467
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,631
we call,

1468
00:35:57,631 --> 00:35:58,680
we say it's prestigious,

1469
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:01,440
but you just do that and we pay you
out the ass to shut the fuck up.

1470
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,740
How would you make some hemp
protein shakes and shut the fuck up.

1471
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:05,791
Yeah.

1472
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,810
Just have a monitor.

1473
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,700
The dudes that are on
the treadmill job guys.

1474
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:09,543
There you go guys.

1475
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,230
That hose in your mouth
when they run with the hose,

1476
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,900
you know like what are you
fucking rocky cold towel.

1477
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,750
You guys need [inaudible]
that should be as Gig.

1478
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,500
Ultimate piss boy.

1479
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,533
Oh,

1480
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,443
that's hilarious.

1481
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,510
That UFC performance
institute is fucking amazing.

1482
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,620
I'm seeing it come alive.

1483
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,281
You know,

1484
00:36:27,281 --> 00:36:28,950
I'm the next UFC in Vegas.

1485
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:29,970
You should come with me and we'll,

1486
00:36:29,971 --> 00:36:30,804
we'll take a trip.

1487
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,730
I went cold.

1488
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:32,160
I went there.

1489
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,820
Did you?

1490
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,280
A couple of weeks ago you had a
meeting there about fight pass,

1491
00:36:35,281 --> 00:36:37,640
right about a ebi and combat Jujitsu.

1492
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,023
How'd that go?

1493
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:39,870
Good,

1494
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,703
good,

1495
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:41,543
good.

1496
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:41,950
You know,

1497
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:42,783
uh,

1498
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,483
did it or

1499
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,450
we're still in the code
for negotiations about

1500
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,850
Combat Jujitsu,

1501
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,440
which is in three in three weeks.

1502
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:56,843
But um,

1503
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:57,960
uh,

1504
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,860
it's looking good.

1505
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,430
And so then it's like they've
been doing a lot of promotion.

1506
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:05,040
I know of Ebi on fight pass,

1507
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,110
like during the fights total,

1508
00:37:07,111 --> 00:37:08,610
we've had some tough times promotion.

1509
00:37:08,611 --> 00:37:09,480
They sat us down,

1510
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,130
they sat us down and said,

1511
00:37:11,131 --> 00:37:11,490
listen,

1512
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:11,700
look,

1513
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,720
well look what we do for you.

1514
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,400
They put all the presentation goes every
time we mentioned you guys on this show

1515
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,080
or that show up when you
know how much that's worth,

1516
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,760
they broke it down for us.

1517
00:37:20,761 --> 00:37:21,091
And we're like,

1518
00:37:21,091 --> 00:37:21,924
fuck,

1519
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:22,980
that's pretty bad ass

1520
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,010
contract negotiations with them.

1521
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:26,844
That's what's going on.

1522
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,570
Could Combat Jiu Jitsu is a new,

1523
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,483
it's a,

1524
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,450
it's an offshoot.

1525
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:32,250
It's a spin off from Ebi.

1526
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,840
It's a hundred percent combat.

1527
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:37,640
You get to two strikes and you're
trying to sell that to we're,

1528
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:42,690
we're putting on the show and
the UFC wants to be part of it.

1529
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,180
And I just really can't
explain exactly how,

1530
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,021
but we're,

1531
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:47,790
we're gonna figure it
out within the next week.

1532
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,450
Gotcha.

1533
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,290
And um,

1534
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:50,423
but

1535
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,290
uh,

1536
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,790
if you don't know what combat get is,

1537
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:57,600
it's basically in between
sub only Jujitsu and MMA.

1538
00:37:57,601 --> 00:37:58,021
It's not,

1539
00:37:58,021 --> 00:37:58,770
I'm in May,

1540
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,910
but it's not sub only.

1541
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:00,511
It's right there.

1542
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:00,900
It's,

1543
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,260
it's for Jujitsu fanatics who
are just interested in seeing,

1544
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:04,831
you know,

1545
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:05,070
there's,

1546
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:08,790
there's like guys that are really into
kickboxing and they know everything about

1547
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:09,301
kickboxing,

1548
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:10,710
but they'll watch MMA a little bit,

1549
00:38:10,711 --> 00:38:11,220
you know what I mean?

1550
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,020
But they're there.

1551
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,800
They're in the kickboxing
there in the business.

1552
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,660
And then there's guys like that unboxing.

1553
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:15,880
Sure.

1554
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,070
We'll watch a little lemon mag.

1555
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,430
Well there's guys like that and
Jujitsu to a lot of guys in Jujitsu.

1556
00:38:20,431 --> 00:38:21,840
Do not watch the UFC.

1557
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:22,711
You know why?

1558
00:38:22,711 --> 00:38:23,790
Because they're showing,

1559
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,490
did you do,

1560
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,830
did they want to see Jujitsu?

1561
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,540
The watch did Jujitsu again,

1562
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,640
but they're not interested in kickboxing.

1563
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:33,000
Just like a kickboxing guy's not
interested in watching digital matches.

1564
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:36,460
So there's a lot of
different genres and um,

1565
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:37,061
combat.

1566
00:38:37,061 --> 00:38:37,894
You'd get this for the,

1567
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,960
the Jujitsu freak that
wants to watch Jujitsu.

1568
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:44,110
Competition with a little more realism,

1569
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:45,820
a little bit closer to MMA.

1570
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,200
When you add palm strikes,

1571
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,980
the importance of each
position changes tremendously.

1572
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,910
Like in the suburban gangs in this way.

1573
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:53,620
Well,

1574
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:53,950
well,

1575
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:54,790
in the sub only game,

1576
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,571
that's one aspect.

1577
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:56,830
And the sub only game.

1578
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:58,090
Uh,

1579
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:01,180
the full guard is not important at all.

1580
00:39:01,181 --> 00:39:02,830
If you never want to play full guard,

1581
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:03,551
that's on you.

1582
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:04,061
You don't have to,

1583
00:39:04,061 --> 00:39:07,630
you could win Abu Dhabi in the point
system without ever playing full guard.

1584
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,613
You could win.

1585
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:11,650
Full guard is so not
important in some the only,

1586
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,000
and in point grappling,

1587
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:17,150
he supplied what you're allowed to do
when you allowed to do and come back.

1588
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,400
He tries,

1589
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,233
he punched it all.

1590
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,011
No,

1591
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:20,890
yet it's palm strikes.

1592
00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:23,380
It's aunt when standing,

1593
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,430
it's just wrestling.

1594
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:25,923
It's not MMA.

1595
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:27,123
It's not a mimic.

1596
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,660
It's extreme Jujitsu.

1597
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:29,500
You got to look at it.

1598
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,970
So wrestling is just standing.

1599
00:39:30,971 --> 00:39:31,571
It's just wrestling.

1600
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:32,920
But as soon as someone hits the ground,

1601
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:34,660
you can start throwing palm strikes.

1602
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,360
Right.

1603
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:35,870
You know,

1604
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,240
but no elbows to the body,

1605
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,074
no elbows,

1606
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,831
no punches.

1607
00:39:38,831 --> 00:39:39,341
Just pause.

1608
00:39:39,341 --> 00:39:40,630
Helps rights to the body's,

1609
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:41,260
nothing.

1610
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,011
Just palm strikes.

1611
00:39:42,011 --> 00:39:42,844
And so it's like,

1612
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,650
remember the old Gracie in action videos?

1613
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,200
All those challenge matches in Brazil.

1614
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:47,881
They had rules.

1615
00:39:47,881 --> 00:39:48,340
They're like,

1616
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,810
they were just palm strikes in Jujitsu.

1617
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,160
Those were rules.

1618
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,120
So after we did the first combat Jujitsu
tournament at Ebi 11 that's when I

1619
00:39:55,121 --> 00:39:56,080
first introduced it.

1620
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:59,020
Horian Gracie calls me,

1621
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,580
I never talked to Horian Gracie,

1622
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,330
however,

1623
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,400
he called Rhodes Gracie to get my number.

1624
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,370
He wanted to call me and Pam on the phone
with Horian Gracie and he's thanking

1625
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:07,780
me for putting together combat.

1626
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:08,830
Jujitsu is Eddie.

1627
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,480
This is how we used to do it in Brazil.

1628
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:11,740
I wanted had it to do this,

1629
00:40:11,741 --> 00:40:12,021
but hell,

1630
00:40:12,021 --> 00:40:12,791
he could not do this.

1631
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,170
This is what we want to thank you.

1632
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,700
This is the real Jujitsu,

1633
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,241
you know?

1634
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:16,541
And I'm like,

1635
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,351
Holy Shit.

1636
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:19,700
The guy who invented the UFC correct.

1637
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:20,840
Calls me up.

1638
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,190
And what happens is when God
consequently makes a fifth,

1639
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,233
it's a foul.

1640
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,760
It's like a foul and get taken away.

1641
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:27,930
Like,

1642
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:28,950
like how many can fulfill?

1643
00:40:28,951 --> 00:40:29,501
It's still,

1644
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,700
it's still no points.

1645
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,850
We call this finish only
because in the first 10 minutes,

1646
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:36,100
if there's not a submission or a Tko,

1647
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,120
I mean,

1648
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,750
or the,

1649
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,740
that's the only way he could finish.

1650
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:39,730
Then we go into overtime,

1651
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:40,780
like Ebi overtime,

1652
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:42,730
but there has to be a finish.

1653
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:43,590
So we call it finished.

1654
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:44,950
I wouldn't get knocked out.

1655
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,990
People can not done yet.

1656
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:47,620
We did two,

1657
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,270
we did two four man tournament.

1658
00:40:49,271 --> 00:40:53,860
We did a girl won the last show and we
did a at Ebi 11 like six months ago.

1659
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:54,551
We did the first one.

1660
00:40:54,551 --> 00:40:57,310
Now we're doing a whole show combat.

1661
00:40:57,311 --> 00:40:58,270
You did two worlds.

1662
00:40:58,271 --> 00:40:59,860
One a whole show.

1663
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,821
Jay and Gary.

1664
00:41:00,821 --> 00:41:01,840
Tony is going to be in it.

1665
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,240
Vagner Rocha is going to be in it.

1666
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:08,170
So tomorrow you're going to see Gary
Tone and in Vagner Rocha going at at Ebi

1667
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:11,080
Style and then three weeks later you're
going to see them going at it with palm

1668
00:41:11,081 --> 00:41:11,650
strikes.

1669
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:12,070
Wow.

1670
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,903
How cool is that?

1671
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,180
Palm strikes is interesting because you
remember when boss Rutan burst onto the

1672
00:41:16,181 --> 00:41:20,680
scene and in pancreas was lightened
motherfuckers on firewood.

1673
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:21,311
Palm strikes.

1674
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:21,930
Yes.

1675
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:22,630
Yes.

1676
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,610
Instead of swinging like a bitch,

1677
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:28,360
when he figured out it's you pull
the palm strikes and throw punches,

1678
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,740
just you throwing punches,

1679
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,730
all that hand.

1680
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:32,780
A lot of it.

1681
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,710
So no,

1682
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,011
no.

1683
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:34,970
That was the rules.

1684
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:35,301
Yeah,

1685
00:41:35,301 --> 00:41:35,690
I know.

1686
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:35,961
I know.

1687
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:36,590
But he was saying,

1688
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,790
but even when he went to MMA,

1689
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:41,000
he said he would keep the same
thing even if it was a rule or not.

1690
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:42,200
Consider you wouldn't break his hand.

1691
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,500
Well you definitely can keep
through a lot of punches for sure.

1692
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:47,780
But he would still throw hooks
and stuff with open hand.

1693
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:48,411
It's not,

1694
00:41:48,411 --> 00:41:48,680
look,

1695
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:48,980
it's,

1696
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,980
it's the thing about the palm is it's
not much softer and punching somebody.

1697
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,940
But you don't hurt your hand at all.

1698
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,810
Like if you got a guy like Bas Rutten
who really knows how to do it well,

1699
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,760
like boss has weird wrists.

1700
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,070
He could pull his hand
way further than I can.

1701
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,170
Like he pulls his hand way back,

1702
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,690
like he gets his hand like back there.

1703
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,150
So he's basically just
fucking palm some words on it.

1704
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,410
I bet he does.

1705
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:14,210
That's embarrassing.

1706
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,043
Yes.

1707
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:20,710
So what happens with college Jujitsu is
the importance of the positions change.

1708
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,290
Like all of a sudden when
there's palm strikes,

1709
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:25,810
full guard is garde.

1710
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:26,870
Yeah.

1711
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:27,890
Garde would be trouble.

1712
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:30,170
You can't be half card like necessary.

1713
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:31,250
And all of Jiu Jitsu.

1714
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,000
There's guys that when Abu Dhabi multiple
times never put anybody in there full

1715
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:35,480
guard.

1716
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,680
It's so unnecessary.

1717
00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:38,840
But when there's palm strikes,

1718
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,550
it's the most important.

1719
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,130
So it's better to prepare
for MMA with that.

1720
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:43,880
That's what's,

1721
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,930
that's another reason.

1722
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,960
So aspiring grapplers that want to start
working on like MMA type Jujitsu and

1723
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,380
Jujitsu positions and focus
on the positions that are
going to translate to MMA.

1724
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,850
Better Combat Jujitsu.

1725
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,070
We'll get their fee sites,

1726
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,140
they'll get to practice,

1727
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,850
you'll get to practice and
then made Jujitsu without
worrying about getting head

1728
00:43:04,851 --> 00:43:05,631
kicked or something.

1729
00:43:05,631 --> 00:43:06,200
You know what I mean?

1730
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,980
That's what it's for.

1731
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,790
It's for the,

1732
00:43:07,790 --> 00:43:09,500
the Jujitsu fanatics.

1733
00:43:09,501 --> 00:43:10,330
Did they,

1734
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:12,800
they like to see MMA when there's Jujitsu.

1735
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,080
Well with combat you did,

1736
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,470
it's going to be mostly Jujitsu.

1737
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:16,423
Well you know when,

1738
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:18,980
whenever they like move rules
around and combat sports,

1739
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:19,731
it makes it interesting.

1740
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:23,030
Like that's what they did with k
one they took Moyie Thai and I said,

1741
00:43:23,031 --> 00:43:23,430
you know what,

1742
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:25,040
there's clinch you guys
clinched two months.

1743
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:26,420
The elbows cut people up,

1744
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:26,991
you know,

1745
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:27,740
needs to the fee.

1746
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,620
Let's cut all the fucking clench
with the needs to the face.

1747
00:43:30,621 --> 00:43:34,010
Like holding in knee and let's
just have it turn into kickbox.

1748
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:34,310
Yeah,

1749
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,070
try to make it better.

1750
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:35,280
Yeah,

1751
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,980
they just tried to make it more exciting.

1752
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,560
Yeah.

1753
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:40,730
There's going to be for guys that like
MMA when there's the Jujitsu in it.

1754
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:44,690
Now we're going to get pure or animate
style Jujitsu and we don't have to worry

1755
00:43:44,691 --> 00:43:45,411
about the striking.

1756
00:43:45,411 --> 00:43:46,340
We love [inaudible].

1757
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:47,450
We love all that,

1758
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:50,270
but this is just for the
hardcore Jujitsu guys.

1759
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:50,960
We're going to get some,

1760
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,800
a lot of data on what leg lock
positions are going to go out the door.

1761
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,570
It's in the sub only game.

1762
00:43:56,571 --> 00:43:56,901
Shit.

1763
00:43:56,901 --> 00:43:58,940
You can go for any goddamn
light leg lock you won,

1764
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,680
but when they're striking,

1765
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:04,040
we're gonna now at that one
and that one's too risky.

1766
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:07,430
Let's just stick with these right here
and that's what we're going to find that

1767
00:44:07,431 --> 00:44:12,080
guys working their ground and pound like
are guys like getting a bag and just

1768
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:14,360
fucking Bam cheese tomorrow.

1769
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:15,620
Fuck,

1770
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,130
can I,

1771
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:16,700
can I like,

1772
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:17,210
you know,

1773
00:44:17,210 --> 00:44:18,740
if I'm in guard and I'm on top,

1774
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,910
can I posture up?

1775
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,520
Yes.

1776
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,490
If as long as the guys on the
ground you could stand up,

1777
00:44:22,491 --> 00:44:23,960
you can be in a horse
stance and throw pumps.

1778
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:28,961
Just tomorrow it tomorrow at Ebi 13 it's
a regular sub only 16 man tournament,

1779
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:32,080
but we're also having a

1780
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,293
four.

1781
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,600
We're having a Forman combat Jujitsu
tournament would Richie Martinez.

1782
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,520
We just missed the knockout blow,

1783
00:44:38,521 --> 00:44:42,480
but it's just knock somebody out
and showing what's Bobby's up too.

1784
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:45,240
He's a real vet with
a body of he's jacked.

1785
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,440
He's a very wide,

1786
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:46,891
yeah,

1787
00:44:46,891 --> 00:44:47,724
he is.

1788
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,571
It's a little cold.

1789
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:50,070
Was watched what happened in the replay.

1790
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,240
Might've missed a couple of leg days,

1791
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:52,074
whatever.

1792
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,700
It just stopped to fight for some reason
and then it came back like right away.

1793
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,260
Knocked him out or something.

1794
00:44:58,510 --> 00:44:59,161
They stopped it.

1795
00:44:59,161 --> 00:45:00,450
Then we're like go and he knocked him out.

1796
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,710
I missed why you stopped it.

1797
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,300
I was trying to reset the
clock and I look back up.

1798
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:04,693
It's over.

1799
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:05,370
Well,

1800
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,690
we'll get a look at the replay here.

1801
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,493
Um,

1802
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:10,843
here we go.

1803
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:12,191
Oh,

1804
00:45:12,191 --> 00:45:15,450
left hook counter that wobbled on.

1805
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:17,520
Oh,

1806
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,353
oh.

1807
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,141
Oh you got,

1808
00:45:19,141 --> 00:45:20,430
I'm going to standing chuck.

1809
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:21,443
Wow,

1810
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:23,783
that's pretty dope.

1811
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,710
It's better than a knockout
right there I come.

1812
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,593
Sweet.

1813
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,390
He's all messed up and the chokes and
I'm way more dramatic than a knockout

1814
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:33,303
right there.

1815
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,820
He got sent to rear naked,

1816
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:37,110
choke against the fence.

1817
00:45:37,111 --> 00:45:37,830
No hooks.

1818
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:41,580
Somebody had some ridiculous
elbow knockout yesterday.

1819
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,983
I don't know.

1820
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,280
How about Heather Hardy?

1821
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,930
Oh,

1822
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:47,090
have you seen this Eddie?

1823
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:49,140
So she was ridiculous box.

1824
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:50,880
I mean one of the best
female box of all time.

1825
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:51,211
He's like,

1826
00:45:51,211 --> 00:45:51,361
Hey,

1827
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:52,350
I want to try MMA.

1828
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:53,580
She had a good first fight.

1829
00:45:53,581 --> 00:45:54,414
Matt Square Garden.

1830
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,560
She fought last night.

1831
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,120
This girl had three fights,

1832
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:58,060
but you know,

1833
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,200
I know the girl had zero MMA,

1834
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:00,841
MMA fight,

1835
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:05,750
three amateur amateur mn
pro debut in in Bella Toby.

1836
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,240
But she was a kickboxer and she
kicked this girl's fucking Faisal.

1837
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:13,680
Heather rolled like Heather rolled
like to do inbox and that girl went,

1838
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:14,813
Hey Kim.

1839
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,460
Oh well the girl was
beating her ass before that.

1840
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:18,850
Did you see her elbows?

1841
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:19,050
Yeah.

1842
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:19,883
Like Heather was like,

1843
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:21,271
yeah,

1844
00:46:21,271 --> 00:46:22,380
she didn't know what to do.

1845
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,230
She thought she was in a safe position
and also the girl was lighting her up

1846
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:26,400
from the outside with kicks.

1847
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,990
She was a kickboxing champion,

1848
00:46:27,991 --> 00:46:29,310
undefeated and kickboxing,

1849
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:30,660
undefeated in taekwondo,

1850
00:46:30,661 --> 00:46:32,760
I think undefeated in boxing.

1851
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,040
So the girl like knew how to strike.

1852
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:35,971
I root for Heather.

1853
00:46:35,971 --> 00:46:36,151
Man,

1854
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:36,990
you hear a story,

1855
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:38,840
it's fucking fascinating story.

1856
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,530
Well she was living with her,

1857
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,580
I think her mom,

1858
00:46:41,581 --> 00:46:44,880
her grandma and she had a daughter and
they're all living like a one bedroom

1859
00:46:44,881 --> 00:46:46,530
place in New York and she was like,

1860
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,100
I'm going fucking crazy.

1861
00:46:48,101 --> 00:46:49,050
Be in the house with the baby.

1862
00:46:49,051 --> 00:46:49,171
All the,

1863
00:46:49,171 --> 00:46:50,760
I just need an hour to go work out.

1864
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:51,361
So it was like,

1865
00:46:51,361 --> 00:46:52,890
oh there's a boxing gym down the street.

1866
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,640
She goes,

1867
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,870
walks in the boxing gym,

1868
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,280
starts to work out and they're like,

1869
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:56,461
damn,

1870
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:57,480
you're not bad at this.

1871
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:58,600
Boom.

1872
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,433
Next thing you know,

1873
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,990
you know monster,

1874
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,540
cause she didn't run
into that chick monster.

1875
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,740
We'll box and I think Heather would that
fucking fight man and be a different

1876
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:08,071
story.

1877
00:47:08,071 --> 00:47:08,400
Yeah.

1878
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,890
I don't know about all
that super high level box.

1879
00:47:10,891 --> 00:47:11,724
She is.

1880
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,260
That girl can box too.

1881
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:15,360
She's an undefeated
kickboxing record as well.

1882
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:16,920
No,

1883
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,753
Jay here you,

1884
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,480
Heather's a monster.

1885
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,700
But her control of distance
was what's important.

1886
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,200
And when she was standing in front of her,

1887
00:47:22,201 --> 00:47:24,980
she would kick and then she'd move
to another angle and mix it up.

1888
00:47:24,981 --> 00:47:25,621
John Stop.

1889
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:28,530
And Heather's wanted to kind of getting
close and play that dirty boxing game.

1890
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,050
Well,

1891
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,370
big thing was the distance.

1892
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:31,240
You know,

1893
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,000
Christina Williams was
fighting completely outside.

1894
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:37,510
I mean if you've got to close the
distance and you can't throw kicks,

1895
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:41,350
like if you're a boxer and you can't
throw kicks and the other person can box a

1896
00:47:41,351 --> 00:47:43,810
little and they can
kick good like his girl,

1897
00:47:43,811 --> 00:47:44,140
Ken,

1898
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,040
you're fucked man.

1899
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,130
Those kicks hit you a couple of times
and the arms and all of sudden those arms

1900
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,270
don't work so good anymore.

1901
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:49,871
You know,

1902
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:50,321
and then you're,

1903
00:47:50,321 --> 00:47:51,330
you're Super Turkey.

1904
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:51,931
No rhythm.

1905
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:52,721
Then you see Heather,

1906
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:56,470
then she tried rolling like you do from
a left hook or something like that and

1907
00:47:56,471 --> 00:48:00,220
that fucking kick hit her so
hard man Shin right to the face.

1908
00:48:00,221 --> 00:48:01,740
And your nose is just destroyed.

1909
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:03,880
Like she's never going
to look the same again.

1910
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:05,560
It was pretty girl to,

1911
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:05,771
yeah,

1912
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:06,790
they're going to have to redo her.

1913
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,180
It's a bummer cause you know the or
belters bank on her to kind of be the next

1914
00:48:10,181 --> 00:48:13,690
big thing to care that
women's division kills her.

1915
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,920
But that kind of loss is a tough one
because you get your face caved in again.

1916
00:48:17,921 --> 00:48:20,440
Your face cave did is not just
loose on about cyborg style.

1917
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:21,820
Michael Bennett page.

1918
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,600
It's just,

1919
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,110
yeah,

1920
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,960
the face is so fucked up like that.

1921
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:26,361
Like you,

1922
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,080
you just got to wonder like how long
would it take before that girl could even

1923
00:48:29,081 --> 00:48:29,680
fight again?

1924
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:32,200
Did you see Michael Venom page
professional boxing debut?

1925
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,920
Granted the fuck he fought
was foreign 70 whatever.

1926
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:38,500
He murked that dude and
he did it in a weird way.

1927
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,620
Hands Down,

1928
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:41,110
leaped for the straight right,

1929
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,990
blasted him and then just stepped
on the ropes and looked away.

1930
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:44,910
How exciting is that?

1931
00:48:45,050 --> 00:48:45,641
He's fun,

1932
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:46,360
man.

1933
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:51,360
He would be a big star in
the UFC and Bella Bella tour.

1934
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,060
They just,

1935
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,640
they just do not get the
credit that they deserve.

1936
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,910
I mean,

1937
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:56,321
I agree.

1938
00:48:56,321 --> 00:48:57,550
No one gets the credit they deserve,

1939
00:48:57,551 --> 00:48:58,600
but you know he's a big star,

1940
00:48:58,601 --> 00:48:59,440
but they're like in London,

1941
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,720
he's a big Kim and Paul
Daley is going to happen.

1942
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:02,500
Oh yeah.

1943
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:03,610
Well I hope it happens.

1944
00:49:03,611 --> 00:49:04,444
It's going to happen.

1945
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:05,860
It is a video.

1946
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:06,790
Jamie,

1947
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,690
you find a video of the pumps.

1948
00:49:08,691 --> 00:49:09,040
It is.

1949
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,030
It's kind of crazy.

1950
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:11,440
Watch how he does this,

1951
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:14,591
his style,

1952
00:49:14,591 --> 00:49:14,980
so,

1953
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,030
oh

1954
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:20,681
yeah.

1955
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:22,680
He's kind of comical that.

1956
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:27,250
That's a serious right hand
holds so much stepping into it.

1957
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:28,510
So much momentum behind that.

1958
00:49:28,511 --> 00:49:31,630
Rory Macdonald's on my showtime at how
you'd like to fight him eventually.

1959
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,930
Yeah.

1960
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:32,740
It'd be a fun fight.

1961
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,350
Although if we're just taking the
mantle him wrestling shoes with,

1962
00:49:35,351 --> 00:49:36,370
just pick them apart.

1963
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,330
He would dismantle them.

1964
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,340
The problem is Roy is not easy to hit.

1965
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:39,791
He's,

1966
00:49:39,791 --> 00:49:40,210
he's,

1967
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:41,380
he's very good on his feet.

1968
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,000
Stay behind the jab if he wants it.

1969
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:44,920
He got ahold of Michael
and Michael's fucked,

1970
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,313
which used to do.

1971
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:46,571
Yeah,

1972
00:49:46,571 --> 00:49:47,770
he's just too high level.

1973
00:49:47,771 --> 00:49:50,650
Rory has just one of the
most comprehensive games,

1974
00:49:50,651 --> 00:49:52,410
the hundred 70 pound
division in the world.

1975
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:53,530
He's the best welterweight in the world.

1976
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,700
He very well could be jail.

1977
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:56,951
He beat Woodley.

1978
00:49:56,951 --> 00:49:57,670
Yeah,

1979
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,330
but then last,

1980
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,163
you know,

1981
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,120
I think you know what man?

1982
00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:03,790
Hofeld dose on Joe's
fighting Robbie Lawler.

1983
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:04,511
God Damn,

1984
00:50:04,511 --> 00:50:05,410
that's a good fight.

1985
00:50:05,411 --> 00:50:06,010
The good fight.

1986
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,810
They were going to learn
a lot about dose on.

1987
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:11,260
Joe said one 70 Dosantos at one 70
it looks like a fucking murderer.

1988
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:16,090
It looks like the same guy at one 55 I
think when when he was making that mad

1989
00:50:16,091 --> 00:50:19,750
Ron at one 55 you know when he got
to the end and he lost the Alvarez,

1990
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,100
he was just cutting too much way.

1991
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:22,120
He couldn't do it anymore.

1992
00:50:22,121 --> 00:50:25,630
Too much weight and now you see him
at one 75 it looks more comfortable.

1993
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:28,850
It's got more power and he's
beating the fuck out of people.

1994
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:30,770
And then she ate Neil magni though.

1995
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:31,940
Fuck ate a mom.

1996
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,140
I'm a grand through him.

1997
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:35,780
Like it was like a world
champion fighting a journeyman.

1998
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,630
That's what it was like.

1999
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:37,880
I wouldn't have been a journeyman.

2000
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:38,714
I was like,

2001
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,201
listen,

2002
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:39,861
I love you Neil.

2003
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:42,290
But it looked like fucking amateur hour.

2004
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,640
He smashed him.

2005
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:44,200
Well,

2006
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,880
Neil's always going to have problems
with the real elite guys on the ground.

2007
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:48,710
Grapplers is just,

2008
00:50:48,711 --> 00:50:49,760
that's his downfall.

2009
00:50:49,761 --> 00:50:50,600
That's an Achilles heel.

2010
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,400
Everyone else he influx
with tell them gas slim.

2011
00:50:53,401 --> 00:50:54,950
He's beat top level guys,

2012
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:55,850
but if they're really,

2013
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:56,750
really good on the ground,

2014
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,460
but let's be honest about why beat Calvin.

2015
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,850
Calvin was overweight and he came in and
he tried to cut too much weight and he

2016
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:02,810
was just diminished.

2017
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,320
I think Calvin in shape is
just way too much for him.

2018
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:07,280
That's my opinion.

2019
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,990
I just think Calvin's one
of the best in the world.

2020
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,250
I'm not saying he's not,

2021
00:51:10,251 --> 00:51:14,710
I'm saying but matchup lies
that Stephanie's can be
a tough fight for Calvin.

2022
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,420
Calvin can do things to him
that he can't do to Calvin.

2023
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,700
Calvin knocks people dead and he doesn't.

2024
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:24,510
Neil is like got incredible
cardio Longreach but he
just kind of picks guys upon

2025
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:25,363
range.

2026
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:26,510
Deep arounds.

2027
00:51:26,510 --> 00:51:30,740
Most impressed with him was
when he fought a tester.

2028
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,920
Hector Lombard Lombard had him dead.

2029
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:35,750
He had in my queer streaming pizza.

2030
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:36,441
What you want about Neil,

2031
00:51:36,441 --> 00:51:37,730
but he'd be Tiger Lombard,

2032
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:39,950
Johnny Hendricks and Kelvin Gas.

2033
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:40,480
Yup.

2034
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:40,900
Yup.

2035
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,160
We're up class and he's
definitely a world class fighter,

2036
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,020
but that's how good dose Angelo says.

2037
00:51:45,021 --> 00:51:49,100
Dos Anjos kicked him one time to Alexis
his legs when he took him for him to

2038
00:51:49,101 --> 00:51:51,350
these fucking took them down with a leg,

2039
00:51:51,351 --> 00:51:52,400
kick his ass up.

2040
00:51:52,790 --> 00:51:54,140
Hey leg kicked him to the ground.

2041
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:56,740
Have you seen a size of dulse?

2042
00:51:56,741 --> 00:52:00,740
San Angelo says legs at one
72 she shows so much bigger.

2043
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,560
It's just so much healthier
for him to all these.

2044
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,393
I just,

2045
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:08,600
Dina said something recently that he
doesn't think that a more weight classes

2046
00:52:08,601 --> 00:52:10,250
are the solution to weight cutting.

2047
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:11,370
I disagree.

2048
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:14,480
The solution wherever we're doing is not
working because there's no one misses

2049
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:15,171
more weight than that.

2050
00:52:15,171 --> 00:52:17,600
55 and 70 well how about Kevin Lee?

2051
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,201
I mean,

2052
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:18,430
Kevin,

2053
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:18,600
if,

2054
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,280
if they're,

2055
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,720
if they've got everything locked down,

2056
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:25,250
how does Kevin Lee barely make it to one
55 it looks like he's on death's door

2057
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,290
and he's 19 pounds over two days.

2058
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:28,340
Who has it locked down?

2059
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:29,174
You're saying?

2060
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:31,920
I'm saying they don't
have it locked fuck sets.

2061
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:33,170
It's the biggest issue.

2062
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:35,000
Well besides some other things,

2063
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:37,880
but it's one of the biggest issues
in our sport and now Kevin has said,

2064
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:39,380
Kevin has said he can't do it anymore.

2065
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:39,830
He's gonna,

2066
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,640
he's gonna move up.

2067
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,510
He said this weight cut.

2068
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:42,413
Damn.

2069
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:42,560
Yeah,

2070
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:43,220
he's got to move up.

2071
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,180
That's staffing helping.

2072
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:45,803
Yeah,

2073
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:46,750
it's going to one seven.

2074
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:47,583
Yeah.

2075
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,680
You just got to do same day when yeah,

2076
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:50,290
he,

2077
00:52:50,290 --> 00:52:51,380
nobody will take a chance.

2078
00:52:51,381 --> 00:52:54,440
No one would kill themselves if it's same
day when they wouldn't take a chance.

2079
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,200
That's why like Ibj Jab does that.

2080
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,940
Ebi does that same day.

2081
00:52:58,941 --> 00:52:59,900
You're going to take a chance.

2082
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:00,741
You can't take a chance.

2083
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:04,950
You just got to compete at what you're
really at all understanding covered.

2084
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,020
They go,

2085
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:06,321
damn,

2086
00:53:06,321 --> 00:53:06,770
I got a date.

2087
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:08,840
We can cut all this and kill myself.

2088
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:10,700
I'll have 24 hours to recover.

2089
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,980
And you don't have like I'd be dead jam.

2090
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,930
They make you weigh in and then you fight.

2091
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:15,823
Right.

2092
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:16,810
Looking at him there,

2093
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:18,170
but you know,

2094
00:53:18,171 --> 00:53:19,310
I love Kevin.

2095
00:53:19,311 --> 00:53:19,701
He knows,

2096
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:22,490
but you know Tony cut a bunch of weight.

2097
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:23,211
He figured it out.

2098
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:23,391
Yeah.

2099
00:53:23,391 --> 00:53:26,790
But Tony was like three pounds
over like a couple days out.

2100
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,121
Yeah.

2101
00:53:27,121 --> 00:53:29,940
But like two weeks before
Tony and Tony goes down,

2102
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:31,090
he has it down to us.

2103
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,190
He's a soldier dude.

2104
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:32,850
I mean,

2105
00:53:32,850 --> 00:53:33,683
but they don't fucking know.

2106
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:34,440
But it also,

2107
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:35,251
if you're Dana,

2108
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:35,880
you,

2109
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,280
you need more weight classes
cause it's fucking your,

2110
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:38,640
your,

2111
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,770
your business up because it could be,

2112
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:41,640
I mean,

2113
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,690
we can't put any money on them.

2114
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,670
You can congress never going fight him.

2115
00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:45,930
He's not fighting Tony next.

2116
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,740
Tony don't want to fight him.

2117
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:46,940
Like,

2118
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:47,100
dude,

2119
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:47,700
you can't even make it.

2120
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:47,950
Wait.

2121
00:53:47,950 --> 00:53:50,490
Barboza maybe who's
going to type our buzzer?

2122
00:53:51,410 --> 00:53:52,370
Beep is,

2123
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,213
it can be

2124
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:55,433
a Bentley.

2125
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,500
He's got according to Cormier and
he's got a new nutritionist and the

2126
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,760
nutritionist has got him on point.

2127
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:00,360
Look,

2128
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:01,500
it's a discipline issue.

2129
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:02,370
It's got to keep the Tiramisu.

2130
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:03,781
Tiramisu.

2131
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:04,680
I don't give a fuck if,

2132
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:05,610
you know,

2133
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,810
it's definitely a discipline issue,

2134
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,280
but it's also a psychological issue.

2135
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,510
You think Tony is going to fight.

2136
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,300
Conor,

2137
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,160
you think that's going down?

2138
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,890
I asked to make us host.

2139
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,090
Conor made that post to Tony Today.

2140
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,760
He made an instrument.

2141
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:18,630
The GTA post.

2142
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:18,970
Yeah.

2143
00:54:18,970 --> 00:54:21,570
Grand theft auto with him
holding a gun or driving a boat.

2144
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,433
Cause Tony did it.

2145
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,970
Cause Tony had at first,

2146
00:54:23,971 --> 00:54:24,390
right?

2147
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:25,730
Well Tony was talking shit about him.

2148
00:54:25,731 --> 00:54:27,110
He called the mcnugget and all this stuff.

2149
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,690
Tony Post,

2150
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:28,523
he's a shit,

2151
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:33,060
but didn't Tony originally posted the
GTA meme and then Connor responded with

2152
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:34,380
his or vice versa.

2153
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,580
I think it's vice versa.

2154
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:36,930
I think Connor went out.

2155
00:54:36,931 --> 00:54:37,201
Tony,

2156
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:37,470
look,

2157
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:38,303
Connor Smart,

2158
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:41,850
he realizes that Tony's a
unusual eccentric character.

2159
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,713
Yeah,

2160
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:43,813
he wrote Tony.

2161
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,330
Conor is an unusual [inaudible]
has got a bag of cash in the back.

2162
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,730
Connors and unusual Accenture care.

2163
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,400
Tony's and unusual
Accenture character too.

2164
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,180
And Tony,

2165
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:54,870
look,

2166
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:57,220
Tony has the longest
winning streak in the UFC,

2167
00:54:57,221 --> 00:54:58,680
has 155 pound division.

2168
00:54:58,681 --> 00:55:01,620
He is the interim champion
and he's the logical one.

2169
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,300
10 in a row for God's sakes.

2170
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,800
And the toughest division in the world.

2171
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,000
He's a bad motherfucker.

2172
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:06,450
No doubt.

2173
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,800
Here's the problem at champion.

2174
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:08,663
Here's the problem with that,

2175
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:09,503
and I,

2176
00:55:09,810 --> 00:55:12,630
I 100% think Connor
has to fight Tony next.

2177
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:14,580
If you want to be taken
serious and your legacy,

2178
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:15,810
you have to fight Tony.

2179
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,010
But if you're tall,

2180
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:20,430
if you're Connor's
business decision makers,

2181
00:55:20,431 --> 00:55:22,740
you're going look at Tony's
draw for paper view though.

2182
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,300
This can be tough for
us to sell this thing.

2183
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:24,870
Well,

2184
00:55:24,870 --> 00:55:25,351
yes,

2185
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:27,030
but not with Connor.

2186
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,230
Like Connor cells,

2187
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,760
like fucking crazy and controversies
Tony cells because Tony's a legit threat.

2188
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:34,920
Connor versus my mom sells.

2189
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:35,370
Right?

2190
00:55:35,370 --> 00:55:37,560
But Connor verses a legit threat.

2191
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:38,910
Cells like Connor fighting,

2192
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:39,744
someone sells.

2193
00:55:39,810 --> 00:55:43,290
But Connor verses a legit threat is where
it gets interesting is the big fight.

2194
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,240
That's the big fire.

2195
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:44,690
All.

2196
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:45,181
I agree.

2197
00:55:45,181 --> 00:55:45,841
It's only Julio.

2198
00:55:45,841 --> 00:55:46,321
You kidding?

2199
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:47,400
He's arrived everybody.

2200
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:48,420
He's a character.

2201
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:49,021
Yeah,

2202
00:55:49,021 --> 00:55:49,741
but Eddie,

2203
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:50,574
that's right.

2204
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,860
But the paper view numbers
were fucking terrible.

2205
00:55:52,861 --> 00:55:53,340
Awful.

2206
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,173
They're terrible.

2207
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:54,930
Well,

2208
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:55,763
well,

2209
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,360
but don't get me wrong.

2210
00:55:57,361 --> 00:55:58,320
It takes two to tango.

2211
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:01,160
It does Connor.

2212
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:02,390
But you're Kevin within reason,

2213
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,840
the biggest name on the planet.

2214
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,141
He said,

2215
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:06,480
everybody respects him in the game
because they know he's a beast.

2216
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,890
He's coming up fucking people up,

2217
00:56:07,891 --> 00:56:09,420
choking people out left and right.

2218
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,191
They know he's a beast,

2219
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:12,210
but the world really didn't know him yet.

2220
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:12,600
Correct.

2221
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,230
You know what I mean?

2222
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:14,340
The world doesn't know either of them.

2223
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,860
And there was a lot of concerning.

2224
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,010
Now the world knows Tony.

2225
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,230
There was a lot of customers,

2226
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,120
a lot of controversy.

2227
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,450
Penn,

2228
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,283
Kevin's,

2229
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:22,380
Tony for sure.

2230
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:23,680
The whole world doesn't know Tony,

2231
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:25,660
but the MMA world knows Tony for sure.

2232
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,210
But the regular people,

2233
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,630
the people that you need to get ahold of,

2234
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:31,360
nor to really buy paper views
because the world knows nay.

2235
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:32,111
And that's where,

2236
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:33,190
that's a businessman,

2237
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:34,630
Doug WMS go,

2238
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:34,931
well,

2239
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:35,651
let's do Nate,

2240
00:56:35,651 --> 00:56:37,210
which if you look at any poll,

2241
00:56:37,211 --> 00:56:39,310
I did a poll or Hawaii to pull him away,

2242
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:39,820
junkie.

2243
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:40,391
Everyone goes,

2244
00:56:40,391 --> 00:56:40,541
no,

2245
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:41,121
Tony First,

2246
00:56:41,121 --> 00:56:41,980
since the fucking fight,

2247
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,810
you're talking hundreds
of thousands of votes.

2248
00:56:43,811 --> 00:56:44,120
People go,

2249
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:44,650
Tony Ferguson,

2250
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:45,483
the next fight.

2251
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,420
But WME is going,

2252
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:46,571
yeah,

2253
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,950
put the money's over here.

2254
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:50,050
But the nae fights not going anywhere.

2255
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:54,340
And how long are you gonna let Connor
play this kind of weird makeup,

2256
00:56:54,341 --> 00:56:56,080
a fight game thing with Nate.

2257
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:00,580
Nate made 4 million bucks over two
fights and he don't give a fuck.

2258
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:01,241
He's like,

2259
00:57:01,241 --> 00:57:02,680
pay me.

2260
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:03,730
You gotta pay me.

2261
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:05,940
But he's gone pay for what you're,

2262
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,480
you've lost four the last seven.

2263
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:08,470
You know what I'm saying?

2264
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,771
Yeah.

2265
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:11,020
But he beat Conner and
then the second fight,

2266
00:57:11,021 --> 00:57:13,030
he arguably how to draw with Connor,

2267
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:13,983
but he lost.

2268
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,200
He lost a decision based on
a couple of people's opinion,

2269
00:57:17,380 --> 00:57:19,270
but I think if you went
and saw the attars Joe,

2270
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:20,170
but it doesn't matter.

2271
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:21,040
It doesn't.

2272
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,360
Public opinion means a lot.

2273
00:57:22,361 --> 00:57:25,210
If you went online and you ask
people who you think won that fight,

2274
00:57:25,211 --> 00:57:28,240
I bet you would get very
close to 50 58 versus Connor.

2275
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,090
Doesn't matter.

2276
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:32,350
But then when Lassi does matter in
terms of how you sell the fight,

2277
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:34,420
it doesn't because to sell the fight,

2278
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:34,700
if,

2279
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,190
if Nate would have won,

2280
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:38,290
if those three people and have a winning,

2281
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,430
you don't have a third fight

2282
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:47,290
fight after he beats twice in a
row after you beat Eddie Alvarez,

2283
00:57:47,291 --> 00:57:48,580
you absolutely could have a third fight.

2284
00:57:49,210 --> 00:57:49,721
He absolutely,

2285
00:57:49,721 --> 00:57:51,010
especially not if they beat them twice.

2286
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:51,910
That's not true.

2287
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:52,721
Not True.

2288
00:57:52,721 --> 00:57:55,210
Especially if he beat
him by the same decision.

2289
00:57:55,330 --> 00:57:58,060
If the had the exact same fight
and Nate one that decision,

2290
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,890
which was entirely feasible,

2291
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,430
right?

2292
00:58:00,430 --> 00:58:03,610
The second fight was so close that you
could easily have given it to Nate.

2293
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:05,590
If Nate winds that second fight,

2294
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:07,060
she's beaten them twice in a row,

2295
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:07,511
you know,

2296
00:58:07,511 --> 00:58:10,780
think to after condor knocks out
Eddie Alvarez the way he did.

2297
00:58:10,781 --> 00:58:11,830
If Connor fought Alvarez,

2298
00:58:11,831 --> 00:58:12,664
knocked him out.

2299
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,880
You don't think you could sell a third
fight because it was so god damn razor

2300
00:58:15,881 --> 00:58:16,714
close.

2301
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:17,081
God.

2302
00:58:17,081 --> 00:58:17,301
Oh,

2303
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:17,891
and to,

2304
00:58:17,891 --> 00:58:20,070
I guess here you're
looking at the numbers.

2305
00:58:20,170 --> 00:58:24,340
You see the problem with decisions is
these decisions are solidified by three

2306
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:27,400
people that oftentimes don't even
have a fucking background in MMA.

2307
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,620
Correct decisions off all the time.

2308
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:31,240
That doesn't mean a lot to me.

2309
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,760
What it means a lot to me
is how close to fight was.

2310
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,200
That's what means a lot to me.

2311
00:58:35,201 --> 00:58:36,580
If a guy goes over to see me,

2312
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,600
touch somebody on the trilogy,

2313
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,220
what do we get more cards from that fight?

2314
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,671
Yeah,

2315
00:58:39,671 --> 00:58:44,671
474748474847 that's his
fucking close as it gets.

2316
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:46,270
It's a majority decision.

2317
00:58:46,271 --> 00:58:48,250
One guy scored it a draw.

2318
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:49,570
Glenn Trowbridge.

2319
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,970
I do not remember what I thought,

2320
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,620
whether I thought it was uh,

2321
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:54,250
uh,

2322
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,170
went to Connor or went to,

2323
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,531
you know what?

2324
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,270
I don't think I've watched it again.

2325
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,070
I'm pretty sure I only watched that fight.

2326
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,020
It was a close fucking fight.

2327
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:03,670
Very super razor close.

2328
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:08,790
We've seen decisions like in fights
that weren't as close go to the other,

2329
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,660
but no one got robbed in that fight.

2330
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,870
I wouldn't say Nate got robbed.

2331
00:59:13,871 --> 00:59:17,200
I would say that it's a controversial
decision because anytime you have a

2332
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:18,130
majority decision,

2333
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,110
there's some controversy to it.

2334
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,990
But my point is you could
easily sell that fight,

2335
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,010
even if Connor,

2336
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,240
even if needed one.

2337
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,240
I think there's other sites,

2338
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,633
bigger fights,

2339
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,500
if you know what is,

2340
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:33,500
what does a bigger fight
if Nate fought Conor,

2341
00:59:33,501 --> 00:59:33,920
you don't.

2342
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,440
You think there's a
bigger fight than that.

2343
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:37,130
If you're saying,

2344
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:37,491
hold on,

2345
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:37,850
Joe,

2346
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:38,450
what do you say?

2347
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:38,901
Trying to fight you.

2348
00:59:38,901 --> 00:59:40,880
So you're saying if Nate beat them twice,

2349
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,160
the third fights can be the big fight.

2350
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:44,810
Right now you see this beat?

2351
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:45,261
I'm stuff.

2352
00:59:45,261 --> 00:59:46,460
It's the same exact fight.

2353
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:46,701
Okay.

2354
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:48,170
The same exact fight takes place.

2355
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:48,981
God Damn Man.

2356
00:59:48,981 --> 00:59:51,200
When they lose the same exact fight,

2357
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,610
the same exact fight,

2358
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,860
those three random fucking people,

2359
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:55,851
they decide,

2360
00:59:55,851 --> 00:59:56,301
you know what,

2361
00:59:56,301 --> 01:00:01,301
this 47 47 I'm going to go 48
47 Diaz and then the 48 47 goes,

2362
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:03,350
you know what?

2363
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:04,940
I think it's the opposite.

2364
01:00:04,941 --> 01:00:09,230
I think it's 48 it's not a make believe
world cause it's entirely feasible that

2365
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,520
that could have done that ever happen.

2366
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:11,071
And Tony,

2367
01:00:11,071 --> 01:00:12,620
Jesus Christ and you listening to me,

2368
01:00:12,621 --> 01:00:15,950
it's entirely possible that that could
have happened in the exact same fight.

2369
01:00:16,100 --> 01:00:17,330
It's still the same fight.

2370
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:19,100
The see the fight was very close.

2371
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:20,900
Those guys were rivals,

2372
01:00:20,901 --> 01:00:23,160
man in Nate choked him the
fuck out and the correct,

2373
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:23,570
right.

2374
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:24,890
That's always going to be there.

2375
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:28,800
So even if Connor like
got real close Connor,

2376
01:00:28,801 --> 01:00:31,790
such a superstar that if
he lost a close decision,

2377
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:32,624
the second fight,

2378
01:00:32,690 --> 01:00:34,670
you get absolutely make an
argument for a third fight,

2379
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:38,580
especially with one or two spectacular
performances like the Eddie Alvarez.

2380
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,910
So if we're going off
that we can do any fight.

2381
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,540
Let's,

2382
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,710
let's do Joseph Aldo.

2383
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:43,041
He could say,

2384
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:44,120
Oh that was a freak accident.

2385
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:44,841
13 seconds.

2386
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:45,674
Let's run that back.

2387
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:49,340
That's a huge aspect for sure.

2388
01:00:49,341 --> 01:00:50,780
And then that's when Eddie Alvarez back,

2389
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:53,590
if you'd be stressing the thing
about a yard and he stops,

2390
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,940
he beat the shit out of Eddie
Alvarez and then knocked him out.

2391
01:00:55,941 --> 01:00:57,260
Eddie was never in that fight.

2392
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,260
All the spring Chatman
is back cause he did it.

2393
01:01:00,261 --> 01:01:01,580
He took it on a six week,

2394
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:03,410
six day notice on a bad idea.

2395
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,230
But Chad [inaudible] one 45
you know what I'm saying?

2396
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,010
Joe,

2397
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,110
you saying like why?

2398
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,110
I don't understand what you're saying.

2399
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,890
I'm just saying and the,

2400
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:11,601
the Nate fight,

2401
01:01:11,601 --> 01:01:13,550
it could've went either way
but that it didn't happen.

2402
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:16,190
So you can make common
in any fights can be big,

2403
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,230
but losing does matter.

2404
01:01:18,231 --> 01:01:19,064
It then today to the,

2405
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,270
to the general population,

2406
01:01:20,271 --> 01:01:20,930
it does matter.

2407
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:21,681
It does matter.

2408
01:01:21,681 --> 01:01:25,040
But when the fights are the exacts
and you could easily see the,

2409
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,570
the decision go one way or the other,

2410
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:26,920
like,

2411
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,381
you know,

2412
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:28,700
there's fights that you've watched.

2413
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:29,511
We say,

2414
01:01:29,511 --> 01:01:30,051
you know what,

2415
01:01:30,051 --> 01:01:31,070
the guy got the decision,

2416
01:01:31,071 --> 01:01:31,521
but man,

2417
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,211
I don't agree with it.

2418
01:01:32,211 --> 01:01:34,630
You just said that with Musashi for sure,

2419
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,070
man.

2420
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:36,020
It happens all the time.

2421
01:01:36,350 --> 01:01:37,250
That's part of the game.

2422
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:37,971
I look at that.

2423
01:01:37,971 --> 01:01:38,271
If I,

2424
01:01:38,271 --> 01:01:39,410
if I look at a fight like that,

2425
01:01:39,411 --> 01:01:41,000
I absolutely want to see that fight again.

2426
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,290
I don't care if one guy got a decision
from three people that I don't agree

2427
01:01:45,291 --> 01:01:45,710
with.

2428
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,310
That's fine.

2429
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,143
And it,

2430
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:52,280
I guess we're kind of saying the same
thing I'm saying Amy fight Conor does is

2431
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:52,821
going to be big.

2432
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:52,941
Well,

2433
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:53,330
the heat,

2434
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,920
any fight contract and you can be big,

2435
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:58,020
but I think we both agree that the
big money's in the Nate Diaz fight.

2436
01:01:58,070 --> 01:01:58,790
Correct.

2437
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:02,270
And I think the smart thing to do the big
money would be in the Nate Diaz fight.

2438
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:03,980
Even if they beat him in the second fight.

2439
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:04,873
I really think that,

2440
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,773
I disagree with you.

2441
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:08,330
I do because I think Conor
is a giant superstar.

2442
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:10,790
He's not going to be less of a superstar
and I think Nate would be a bigger

2443
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:11,150
star.

2444
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:15,110
How many times in calculus two worth
more money if Nate beat him in the second

2445
01:02:15,111 --> 01:02:15,944
fight?

2446
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,010
I think Holly,

2447
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,620
I think Nate would be a bigger star.

2448
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:23,040
Tony and Conor is about as big biggest
fight you can get in the lightweight

2449
01:02:23,041 --> 01:02:24,600
division in the UFC history,

2450
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,780
Tony in UFC history and UFC history.

2451
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:31,490
Tony Against Carter and
that's like Duran vs Leonard.

2452
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:32,970
I don't think it's the biggest fight,

2453
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:35,460
but I think it's not like it's up there.

2454
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,120
It's what the among the best
lightweight a unification.

2455
01:02:40,170 --> 01:02:42,930
Connor's coming off of the
Floyd Mayweather hundred people.

2456
01:02:42,940 --> 01:02:43,773
No.

2457
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:44,813
Let's say if Nate,

2458
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,141
first of all,

2459
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:47,520
any before you rip my head off,

2460
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:48,450
I agree.

2461
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:49,560
Tony and Conor,

2462
01:02:49,620 --> 01:02:51,000
100% on these topics.

2463
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:52,800
He's a star in our world,

2464
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,580
in the pot,

2465
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:54,960
in the big world.

2466
01:02:54,961 --> 01:02:55,560
He's not.

2467
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,710
He's a star dog.

2468
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:58,930
Let's say.

2469
01:02:58,930 --> 01:02:59,610
Hold on a second.

2470
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,470
You think you can go to the
gas station right now and go,

2471
01:03:01,471 --> 01:03:02,304
hey man,

2472
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,420
who's Tony Ferguson?

2473
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,040
Depends on the guy who's there.

2474
01:03:06,020 --> 01:03:06,853
They'll know

2475
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,140
WWE shirt,

2476
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:11,590
shirt on.

2477
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:12,423
It all depends.

2478
01:03:12,430 --> 01:03:15,090
You go to the average
person and asked them who?

2479
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:16,170
Nate Diaz is.

2480
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,060
Way more people going to know who he is.

2481
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,080
Then Tony now,

2482
01:03:19,110 --> 01:03:19,681
now hear me out.

2483
01:03:19,681 --> 01:03:20,514
Joe.

2484
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:22,790
Nate Floyd Mayweather.

2485
01:03:22,791 --> 01:03:23,940
Is it still a bigger name?

2486
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,770
Then they could do that.

2487
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,410
They could do a rematch and have
another bid five bigger than Kukui,

2488
01:03:28,411 --> 01:03:30,120
but I'm talking about for the UFC.

2489
01:03:30,121 --> 01:03:31,800
Fuck everyone outside the UFC.

2490
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:35,130
UFC has millions and millions of fun
dates of bigger name all over the world.

2491
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:36,330
All over the world.

2492
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:38,050
There's,

2493
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:39,570
he has the interim belt.

2494
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,520
He has to fight him.

2495
01:03:41,670 --> 01:03:42,700
I know you're,

2496
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,890
why is there a discussion?

2497
01:03:44,310 --> 01:03:47,040
There's a discussion in
terms of like as a purist,

2498
01:03:47,041 --> 01:03:47,580
correct,

2499
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:48,080
but Joe,

2500
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,160
what if this was another fight?

2501
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:50,941
Ufc Fan?

2502
01:03:50,941 --> 01:03:51,301
I'm right.

2503
01:03:51,301 --> 01:03:52,730
As your average UFC fan,

2504
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:56,370
what if Nate fought Barboza
or Khabib and beat them?

2505
01:03:56,371 --> 01:03:58,680
Think how big that Nate
fight would be with Connor.

2506
01:03:58,681 --> 01:03:59,970
Then that's a big if though,

2507
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:01,520
the problem with that is Nate's lost.

2508
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:02,250
We're talking about it.

2509
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:02,731
If world,

2510
01:04:02,731 --> 01:04:04,690
right now we're talking
with Connor lost it,

2511
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:07,770
but we're not right now because we're
talking about what the pieces are in play

2512
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:08,460
right now.

2513
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:08,970
Like what?

2514
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:09,211
Wait,

2515
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:10,170
what do we have right in front of,

2516
01:04:10,171 --> 01:04:10,981
so we're going to do right now.

2517
01:04:10,981 --> 01:04:12,450
So if you're doing it right now,

2518
01:04:13,290 --> 01:04:13,651
well,

2519
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:15,840
if you're going by what
the fans have voted,

2520
01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:18,250
Tony would be the fight
that the purists want.

2521
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,210
But this is the fans that
listen to Ariel Helwani or you.

2522
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,970
These are hardcore people do.

2523
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:24,360
In order to make money,

2524
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,750
you have to get those people and then
you've got to get the people who know it

2525
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:28,440
peripherally.

2526
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,360
Well then Nate Diaz,

2527
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,110
we polyman nauseas the next fight.

2528
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,190
They don't even know
Paulie Mala noche here.

2529
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:36,370
They don't until he fights it.

2530
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:38,040
Unless Connor fights in boxing.

2531
01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:39,013
That's what I'm saying.

2532
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:40,830
But I mean,

2533
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:41,540
well look,

2534
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,370
they've taken all that out of context.

2535
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:45,630
Nate is the bigger fight,

2536
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,100
no matter how we paint this picture,

2537
01:04:47,820 --> 01:04:49,560
the re the fight you should do.

2538
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,520
Is Tony though,

2539
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:54,570
do you think that Paulie Malignaggi
versus Conor is a big to get Tony new

2540
01:04:54,571 --> 01:04:55,170
sunglasses?

2541
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:58,950
Do you think that Pauline mile and
algae versus Connor is a bigger fight in

2542
01:04:58,951 --> 01:05:02,700
boxing then Nate versus Connor is an MMA?

2543
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:08,580
I think whatever Connor
does is as big as big,

2544
01:05:08,581 --> 01:05:09,510
but I think doesn't matter.

2545
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:14,460
I think Nate versus Connor is bigger
in MMA then Paulie versus Connor is in.

2546
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,133
Yeah,

2547
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:18,850
because cause Paul is not
like a Floyd Mayweather

2548
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:20,920
where he's going to get
all those boxing fans.

2549
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:23,140
Paul was good and he's
a big names on showtime,

2550
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,670
but he's not Floyd Mayweather a big,

2551
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:25,360
yeah.

2552
01:05:25,360 --> 01:05:26,020
Yeah.

2553
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,690
The whole Nate fricking fan base.

2554
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:29,800
You got the Connor fan base,

2555
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,040
then you have dubby WME behind
that with the hype machine.

2556
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:33,370
Yeah.

2557
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:35,430
And they've severely lightened that.

2558
01:05:35,470 --> 01:05:36,850
What a sanctions on weed.

2559
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:37,730
Yeah,

2560
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:37,920
but,

2561
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:38,440
but,

2562
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:40,030
but if you're WME,

2563
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,900
you're going,

2564
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:41,990
what are we going to make the most?

2565
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:42,581
Or I'm sorry,

2566
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:42,750
knife.

2567
01:05:42,750 --> 01:05:43,241
You're WME.

2568
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:45,830
If you're Connors business planners,

2569
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:46,420
you're going,

2570
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:47,620
how do we make the most money?

2571
01:05:47,621 --> 01:05:50,140
It's a McGregor promotion in boxing.

2572
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,580
We're gonna make more money doing that.

2573
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:52,414
Fighting Polly.

2574
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,400
It's safer than fighting Nate.

2575
01:05:54,401 --> 01:05:54,750
Refining.

2576
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:55,600
Totally true.

2577
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:58,630
But if Connor loses two
in a row and boxing,

2578
01:05:58,910 --> 01:06:02,460
that's severely diminished
as a star in MMA come.

2579
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:03,440
What's mmn?

2580
01:06:03,490 --> 01:06:04,001
And by the way,

2581
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:07,280
they'll strip him of his belt if he
fights another and we got a strip,

2582
01:06:07,370 --> 01:06:08,740
they ain't doing shit to him.

2583
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:10,740
He did the USC.

2584
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:11,583
Who's going to do it.

2585
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,350
He doesn't want every once
you might find it heavyweight,

2586
01:06:14,351 --> 01:06:15,101
if you want to do that,

2587
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:15,881
I can do shit to him.

2588
01:06:15,881 --> 01:06:16,750
He's too much of a drawl.

2589
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:20,320
But Tony or Nate is a dangerous fight.

2590
01:06:20,350 --> 01:06:20,891
Either fight.

2591
01:06:20,891 --> 01:06:21,724
Is it Tony?

2592
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:22,390
Tony,

2593
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:24,730
Tony and Nate are more
dangerous than fighting poly.

2594
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,030
One of the,

2595
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:26,630
Oh,

2596
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,900
they did his own GTA post.

2597
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:29,850
What does it say?

2598
01:06:29,850 --> 01:06:30,610
Does it say anything?

2599
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:31,271
There's no comment.

2600
01:06:31,271 --> 01:06:32,410
I don't think monument.

2601
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:34,360
What does that count?

2602
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,360
Yeah.

2603
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,040
Oh,

2604
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:36,873
just that.

2605
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:39,041
I mean,

2606
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:41,620
regardless of what was the Tony Ferguson,

2607
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:42,730
Tony has his,

2608
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,753
uh,

2609
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:44,151
can,

2610
01:06:44,151 --> 01:06:45,760
I told him have been
the first one to do it.

2611
01:06:45,761 --> 01:06:46,594
I think

2612
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:50,800
Tony Ferguson didn't see,

2613
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:52,823
I don't see one.

2614
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:53,430
Oh,

2615
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,263
there it is.

2616
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:56,040
Snapdown city.

2617
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:56,791
No,

2618
01:06:56,791 --> 01:06:57,481
that's not it.

2619
01:06:57,481 --> 01:06:57,820
Is it?

2620
01:06:57,820 --> 01:06:58,501
It is right there.

2621
01:06:58,501 --> 01:06:59,670
It's a video or something.

2622
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,250
He's running with bears
and big bear looking at,

2623
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:04,393
ah,

2624
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:05,303
that's funny.

2625
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:06,871
I'm like,

2626
01:07:06,871 --> 01:07:08,160
did he trains up there man?

2627
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:09,031
It's really interesting.

2628
01:07:09,031 --> 01:07:11,660
Does he always rent the same place up
there is you rent different places,

2629
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:12,494
different houses.

2630
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:15,090
So he just goes like airbnb or something
like that for a month and a half.

2631
01:07:15,091 --> 01:07:15,780
Exactly.

2632
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:17,190
How many weeks did you stay up there?

2633
01:07:17,970 --> 01:07:18,960
Six weeks.

2634
01:07:19,050 --> 01:07:19,883
Something like that.

2635
01:07:19,980 --> 01:07:21,570
Guy's got phenomenal cardio.

2636
01:07:21,900 --> 01:07:22,900
He was so common.

2637
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:23,611
That fight too.

2638
01:07:23,611 --> 01:07:26,220
It's like he knew that Kevin was
just going to eventually fade out.

2639
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,413
Did he know,

2640
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:29,370
did he know about Kevin staph infection?

2641
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:30,481
No,

2642
01:07:30,481 --> 01:07:32,520
but I noticed it right
when he got in the octagon.

2643
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:33,540
As soon as he got in the octagon,

2644
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:33,900
I'm like,

2645
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,440
dude has staff out his chest PSE.

2646
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,150
That wanes the way Tony responded to it.

2647
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:39,451
They said,

2648
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:40,770
did you know he had stopped because yeah,

2649
01:07:40,771 --> 01:07:43,500
I was trying to punch
it using it as a target.

2650
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:48,510
I noticed that I was
cold calling it on the,

2651
01:07:48,511 --> 01:07:49,650
I can't believe you said something.

2652
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,790
What did you think about the fight?

2653
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,740
Why didn't you think are,

2654
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:52,681
why did you think?

2655
01:07:52,681 --> 01:07:53,330
I wouldn't say,

2656
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:53,910
I don't know.

2657
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:54,601
I do cause I,

2658
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:56,130
if you didn't know with staff,

2659
01:07:56,131 --> 01:07:56,581
I was like,

2660
01:07:56,581 --> 01:07:57,330
oh fuck.

2661
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,410
I knew it was staff.

2662
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:02,450
I like that looks like staff and I
said to DC staff enough times to not.

2663
01:08:02,451 --> 01:08:02,720
Yeah.

2664
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,470
Just say it twice.

2665
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:04,980
Yeah,

2666
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,090
I know what staff looks like.

2667
01:08:06,091 --> 01:08:06,421
I'm like,

2668
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:07,230
that ain't good.

2669
01:08:07,230 --> 01:08:08,070
That's a bad boy.

2670
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:09,301
Yeah.

2671
01:08:09,301 --> 01:08:11,850
When he saw staff Mikko
he's super screwed already.

2672
01:08:11,851 --> 01:08:12,790
It was a tough matchup.

2673
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,100
May Have Staff [inaudible]
he didn't on antibiotics.

2674
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:17,211
He said he did.

2675
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:18,140
I know he said he didn't.

2676
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,750
He said he didn't take the antibiotics
cause he didn't want it to wreck his

2677
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:21,440
cardio.

2678
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,400
But the staff itself.

2679
01:08:22,401 --> 01:08:22,940
Rex You,

2680
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:24,900
I thought Tony looked amazing though.

2681
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:25,641
He did look amazing.

2682
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:26,480
But here's the thing.

2683
01:08:26,481 --> 01:08:28,820
When I was saying it
and I said to d c I go,

2684
01:08:28,821 --> 01:08:29,211
hey man,

2685
01:08:29,211 --> 01:08:29,391
I go,

2686
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:30,410
that looks like staff to me.

2687
01:08:30,411 --> 01:08:30,911
Is that what works?

2688
01:08:30,911 --> 01:08:32,480
Tap and dcs like yeah.

2689
01:08:32,481 --> 01:08:33,080
That looks at the tip.

2690
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,270
Someone was in dcs ear saying,

2691
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:36,380
don't say anything.

2692
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,540
Someone was telling them in the production
like don't talk about the staff.

2693
01:08:41,541 --> 01:08:42,580
Don't talk when the new skill,

2694
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:43,990
that staff though.

2695
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:46,033
No,

2696
01:08:46,420 --> 01:08:46,940
no,

2697
01:08:46,940 --> 01:08:47,060
no,

2698
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:47,201
no,

2699
01:08:47,201 --> 01:08:47,660
no.

2700
01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:48,830
This is before.

2701
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,120
Before anybody.

2702
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:50,851
Oh,

2703
01:08:50,851 --> 01:08:52,400
I noticed it before anybody.

2704
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:53,750
I noticed it immediately.

2705
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:54,590
He took his shirt off.

2706
01:08:54,591 --> 01:08:57,880
He rented the Octagon and Mike
that so the truck salt the drawer,

2707
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,210
the truck was saying to DC,

2708
01:08:59,211 --> 01:09:00,620
don't say anything in DC is like,

2709
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:01,461
yeah,

2710
01:09:01,461 --> 01:09:02,294
that looks like staff.

2711
01:09:02,330 --> 01:09:03,200
He said it anyway.

2712
01:09:04,300 --> 01:09:05,133
What are you going to do?

2713
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:05,401
Well,

2714
01:09:05,401 --> 01:09:07,820
he did an interview where he
said that they brought it up.

2715
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:09,560
Like someone said it to him and he's like,

2716
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:09,711
no,

2717
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:10,730
I'm going to talk about it anyway.

2718
01:09:12,410 --> 01:09:12,981
You have to.

2719
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:15,140
We're just going to ignore fucking staff.

2720
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,130
That's huge.

2721
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:17,630
But it's also a huge issue.

2722
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:20,280
Did Tony like wash themselves
with bleach and shit afterwards?

2723
01:09:20,810 --> 01:09:21,680
Jumped in the shower.

2724
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:22,520
Yeah man.

2725
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,600
Did he have to defense soap?

2726
01:09:24,530 --> 01:09:25,363
I don't know.

2727
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,240
I hope so.

2728
01:09:26,240 --> 01:09:26,661
Defense.

2729
01:09:26,661 --> 01:09:28,550
So it makes these little
wipes too and it's fun.

2730
01:09:28,580 --> 01:09:29,560
You can put them on stat.

2731
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:32,240
Look at this size of that
fucking staph infection.

2732
01:09:32,660 --> 01:09:33,860
I forgot he had them mounted

2733
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:35,780
to,

2734
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:37,640
I forgot to enter the first round.

2735
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:38,510
He escaped though.

2736
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:39,300
Yeah.

2737
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:41,060
Kevin's a talented fucking dude.

2738
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,290
Talented young.

2739
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:44,330
Look at the size of that
staph infection though.

2740
01:09:44,331 --> 01:09:45,210
Jesus Christ.

2741
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:46,220
We're stuff I've ever seen.

2742
01:09:46,250 --> 01:09:47,210
That's a huge,

2743
01:09:47,270 --> 01:09:48,380
huge pause.

2744
01:09:48,381 --> 01:09:48,950
Filled.

2745
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:49,783
Fucking Ho.

2746
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:51,350
How bodied up is that dude?

2747
01:09:51,351 --> 01:09:52,130
By the way.

2748
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:53,630
For real jacked.

2749
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:54,801
How would a fuck,

2750
01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:56,570
did he make one 55 too?

2751
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,170
Cause he looks all of one night.

2752
01:09:58,190 --> 01:09:59,810
He looked dead on the scale.

2753
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:00,231
Yeah.

2754
01:10:00,231 --> 01:10:01,520
You look like the crypt keeper.

2755
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:02,840
He looked very bad,

2756
01:10:03,590 --> 01:10:05,540
but that's a terrible staph infection.

2757
01:10:05,690 --> 01:10:06,990
I'll tell you what a Tony Evers,

2758
01:10:07,060 --> 01:10:08,450
Connor's a fun match up man.

2759
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:08,780
Sure.

2760
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:09,800
That's a great fight.

2761
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:12,320
Tony has survivability.

2762
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:14,990
He's got crazy and he's great.

2763
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:16,610
He has crazy and in a good way.

2764
01:10:16,611 --> 01:10:17,271
He was crazy.

2765
01:10:17,271 --> 01:10:18,051
Where are you going to have to kill him?

2766
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:20,330
He can get things off from everywhere.

2767
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:21,980
He can beat you from the ground.

2768
01:10:21,981 --> 01:10:23,030
He could beat you standing.

2769
01:10:23,031 --> 01:10:23,900
He knock you out.

2770
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:26,390
He throws these weird off angle punches.

2771
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:27,680
He's got a great chin.

2772
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:30,440
The super durable elbows from the guard.

2773
01:10:30,441 --> 01:10:31,410
That was what changed.

2774
01:10:31,420 --> 01:10:32,253
So town together.

2775
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:33,800
That's where Kevin was in trouble.

2776
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,180
Most fighters don't know this.

2777
01:10:35,181 --> 01:10:36,014
They think that,

2778
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,810
you know in the mount
12 to six is illegal.

2779
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:39,110
Right?

2780
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,250
These straight down,

2781
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,900
but not in the upside.

2782
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:43,940
Down Mountain is full guard.

2783
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:48,020
Six to 12 there's still the 12
to six was a or on their back.

2784
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,190
Those are totally legal.

2785
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:50,790
Mullins fighters still don't know that.

2786
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:51,440
And that'll drone,

2787
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:52,101
which is strange.

2788
01:10:52,101 --> 01:10:52,730
They don't throw them.

2789
01:10:52,730 --> 01:10:53,231
But you know who,

2790
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:54,740
who was the master of that shit?

2791
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:57,800
Jose Palae land be oh gee.

2792
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,780
He was the first Anderson
Silva at shoot box.

2793
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:00,680
That was the first one.

2794
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:02,930
Anderson Silva was like
his little protege.

2795
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:04,203
Holy pay.

2796
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:04,790
Uh,

2797
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:09,470
Jose paid Landy when he [inaudible]
back in the late nineties and valid Tuta

2798
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:10,680
Mecca and all that stuff here.

2799
01:11:10,690 --> 01:11:13,130
Knuckle in high school gyms,

2800
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:14,160
they had a rivalry.

2801
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:14,850
Macaca was up.

2802
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,560
He still fights now a Macaca was,

2803
01:11:16,561 --> 01:11:17,060
um,

2804
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:19,380
a Jujitsu guy and Palae
was the Muay Thai guy.

2805
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:23,340
But anytime a cocker would take him down
and full guard Paly would put his feet

2806
01:11:23,341 --> 01:11:27,870
on his hips and throw those 12 to six
from the guard and fucking would brutalize

2807
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:28,704
mutts on power.

2808
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,340
It's like you didn't want to take
this if that's all you focused on.

2809
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,870
Isn't the full bars train a lot of it.

2810
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:35,320
W W W there's,

2811
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,630
it's hard to train those,

2812
01:11:36,631 --> 01:11:37,110
but we,

2813
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,381
you know,

2814
01:11:37,381 --> 01:11:38,340
in full guard would say,

2815
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,210
remembering always,

2816
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:39,770
always.

2817
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:40,603
You're looking at Benson,

2818
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:41,663
it's part of the game.

2819
01:11:41,790 --> 01:11:42,900
Rubber guard and elbows.

2820
01:11:42,901 --> 01:11:46,410
They work hand in hand and
Jason Day fought Alan Belcher.

2821
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:47,244
Exactly,

2822
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,353
exactly.

2823
01:11:48,690 --> 01:11:50,610
Jason Day versus Alan Belcher.

2824
01:11:50,670 --> 01:11:55,050
He threw like 22 elbows
from mission control trucks.

2825
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,520
It's part of the system.

2826
01:11:56,521 --> 01:11:57,720
If you can't get,

2827
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:01,840
you can't get them in a position where
you want them just get to Michigan drone

2828
01:12:01,841 --> 01:12:02,640
and throw elbows.

2829
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,730
But in that situation in Tony's fight,

2830
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:08,700
Kevin Lee didn't want to stay on his,

2831
01:12:08,701 --> 01:12:10,110
but he wanted Tony on the ground.

2832
01:12:10,111 --> 01:12:12,980
So when you have a situation like
that where Tony's winning the standup,

2833
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:13,920
he wants to stand up,

2834
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:16,890
but you got a restaurant topic
now you can put your feet,

2835
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:21,980
you can put your feet on the hips
because if Kevin wanted to keep the fight

2836
01:12:22,591 --> 01:12:22,951
standing,

2837
01:12:22,951 --> 01:12:24,780
let's say he was beating Tony Standing,

2838
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:28,200
then Tony putting his feet on the hips
would be bad because then Kevin would

2839
01:12:28,201 --> 01:12:30,330
stand up and now we've got to
drag them to the ground again.

2840
01:12:30,450 --> 01:12:32,040
But since Kevin didn't want to stand,

2841
01:12:32,190 --> 01:12:36,480
now you're free to throw those
12 to six from the bottom.

2842
01:12:36,481 --> 01:12:38,610
You put the feet on the hips and cause he,

2843
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,770
cause Kevin has to put the
pressure so it's perfect.

2844
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:45,780
You just hold yourself up and you can't
even fire back when you got your feet on

2845
01:12:45,781 --> 01:12:47,970
the hip where your knees
are blocking the shoulders.

2846
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,800
So dudes can't even fire back.

2847
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,870
And if you set the pace first,

2848
01:12:51,990 --> 01:12:54,960
he's got a block he doesn't have time to
throw cause you're coming straight with

2849
01:12:54,961 --> 01:12:55,710
those elbows.

2850
01:12:55,710 --> 01:12:56,543
You watch that fight.

2851
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:57,210
Uh,

2852
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,290
Kevin was,

2853
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,620
he was confused with the elbows
that threw everything else.

2854
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:01,760
Let's set up the submission.

2855
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:05,970
I'll tell you what's interesting is in
the fight with Tony and Conor say that's

2856
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:06,690
next.

2857
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:07,770
If Tony Goes,

2858
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:08,401
you know what,

2859
01:13:08,401 --> 01:13:09,450
I'm gonna do my weird movement,

2860
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,260
but I'm just going to
grapple the fuck out of here.

2861
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:13,800
I don't know how good of a fight you have.

2862
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:15,900
Cause Tony's amazing wrestler.

2863
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:19,020
People don't realize how good of a
restless so he could fight for Conor.

2864
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:20,320
I'll tell you that if Todd,

2865
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,020
if Tony doesn't want to be good fight,

2866
01:13:22,021 --> 01:13:22,561
if Tony Goes,

2867
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:22,920
you know what?

2868
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:24,000
You think of the best standing up.

2869
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:24,960
I think I'm the best.

2870
01:13:24,961 --> 01:13:25,794
Watch this.

2871
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,010
You have a classic on,

2872
01:13:27,420 --> 01:13:28,260
but if Tony Goes,

2873
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:29,520
I'm just going back to my wrestling days,

2874
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:30,354
you're fucked.

2875
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:31,990
It's not great for Connor.

2876
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:34,130
I will say the finishes him.

2877
01:13:34,131 --> 01:13:36,150
It's great if he gets Connor to ground,

2878
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,520
beats him up and striving for Conor,

2879
01:13:39,030 --> 01:13:39,451
for Tony.

2880
01:13:39,451 --> 01:13:39,690
It's great.

2881
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:39,960
No matter.

2882
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:40,220
Well,

2883
01:13:40,220 --> 01:13:42,150
I think it's a dangerous fight for Conor.

2884
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:44,040
I think it's a very early
stage for both guys.

2885
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,300
Super Dangerous Rocana.

2886
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,920
Tony's the most dangerous guy.

2887
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,500
I mean that division by far.

2888
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:50,040
You know,

2889
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:50,580
he's,

2890
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,670
he doesn't do anything to
add about judging about,

2891
01:13:53,671 --> 01:13:55,680
we were talking about the
arbitrary three people.

2892
01:13:56,090 --> 01:13:56,570
I thought.

2893
01:13:56,570 --> 01:14:00,240
I think that's a very flawed system
and I think it's completely unnecessary

2894
01:14:00,241 --> 01:14:00,930
today.

2895
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:05,760
I think today with access to
voting and online and vote,

2896
01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:06,900
not a fan vote,

2897
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:08,430
a vote of experts,

2898
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:09,780
a panel of experts.

2899
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,730
You get a bunch of Jujitsu,

2900
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:12,100
black

2901
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:13,030
belts that are,

2902
01:14:13,031 --> 01:14:13,660
you know,

2903
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:16,750
also a MMA journalists,

2904
01:14:17,090 --> 01:14:20,980
a different referees and
judges have a panel of like,

2905
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:21,291
you know,

2906
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:23,260
I guess who know what's going on.

2907
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:24,700
How does the Academy Awards work?

2908
01:14:24,701 --> 01:14:25,630
I don't know how it works,

2909
01:14:25,750 --> 01:14:28,570
but I would assume it's a bunch of
people that are experts business.

2910
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,351
We're in the business.

2911
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:29,870
Good idea,

2912
01:14:29,870 --> 01:14:30,690
Joe.

2913
01:14:30,690 --> 01:14:32,320
That's a great idea though.

2914
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:36,880
That's different in the
Weinstein case sizes.

2915
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:37,900
Oh man,

2916
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,291
it's crazy,

2917
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:38,530
right?

2918
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,750
Documentary an open secret.

2919
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:41,910
Watched that show.

2920
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:43,450
I keep hearing about that secret.

2921
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,970
It's would good,

2922
01:14:46,010 --> 01:14:46,630
right?

2923
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:49,480
Hollywood managers who manage kids.

2924
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:50,860
It's a racket.

2925
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:51,430
Ma'Am.

2926
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:54,630
Did you hear the term
kid from strange dude?

2927
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:56,650
Strange things,

2928
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,900
strange stranger,

2929
01:14:57,940 --> 01:14:58,770
stranger things.

2930
01:14:58,770 --> 01:15:00,430
He Day just left.

2931
01:15:00,431 --> 01:15:03,040
He just left his manager and
they're alleging sexual abuse.

2932
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,510
They just left their agency.

2933
01:15:04,511 --> 01:15:05,290
If you can find that.

2934
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:05,441
Oh,

2935
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:06,610
and Ben Shirley here,

2936
01:15:06,611 --> 01:15:06,870
kid.

2937
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:07,260
Oh,

2938
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,650
he's in Benjamin.

2939
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:13,740
Just put it on his Instagram today
because Olin is been taking a lot of heat

2940
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:17,860
online because he said that a three
year old kid shouldn't be fucking

2941
01:15:17,861 --> 01:15:20,340
transgender and people giving him
a hard time seeing he's a bigot.

2942
01:15:20,350 --> 01:15:23,160
Like are you out of your fucking
mind when your top three trends,

2943
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:28,710
stranger things act or dropped agent
because of sec accused of sexual assault.

2944
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:30,460
Disney star fall suit.

2945
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,780
Jesus Christ.

2946
01:15:32,470 --> 01:15:33,221
This is nuts.

2947
01:15:33,221 --> 01:15:35,410
Watch an open secret and
they tell they go through,

2948
01:15:35,540 --> 01:15:38,290
do they pick their people?

2949
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:40,870
It's for free I think on Vimeo.

2950
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:41,111
Yeah.

2951
01:15:41,111 --> 01:15:43,970
You can go watch it for free
on youtube or something.

2952
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:46,150
You know what a Sturgill Simpson told me.

2953
01:15:46,270 --> 01:15:48,310
He said the same thing exists in music,

2954
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:49,601
in music.

2955
01:15:49,601 --> 01:15:52,400
There's a bunch of pedos
and pet rap music as well.

2956
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:58,050
Business all the way through music that
this is about music and movies and TV.

2957
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:00,970
It's about the whole women,

2958
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,920
women and kids.

2959
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,560
Most of the beers and sometimes dudes,

2960
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:05,891
you know,

2961
01:16:05,891 --> 01:16:07,780
Terry Cruz said that he was attacked,

2962
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,501
well not attacked.

2963
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:09,200
Some dude grabbed,

2964
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:12,070
grabbed his dick in front of this
white famous dude grabbed his dick.

2965
01:16:12,340 --> 01:16:13,480
You know who I sold that?

2966
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:14,051
Um,

2967
01:16:14,051 --> 01:16:17,560
who was that fucking big time football
player that was in that weird movie with

2968
01:16:17,561 --> 01:16:18,430
John Travolta.

2969
01:16:18,820 --> 01:16:19,653
Howie long,

2970
01:16:19,660 --> 01:16:21,980
Howie Long said the exact same
shit was happening to him.

2971
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:22,890
Wrapped he lungs.

2972
01:16:22,890 --> 01:16:25,740
Dick guys were coming after
how we long guys were,

2973
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:27,130
were propositioning him,

2974
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,840
trying to tell him this is what you have
to do to make it in the movie business

2975
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:31,330
suck Dick or folk who else?

2976
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:33,580
It happened to haul Cogan same thing.

2977
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:34,470
Play.

2978
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:34,900
Yes.

2979
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:35,470
Coating up.

2980
01:16:35,470 --> 01:16:40,470
Last call the Logan got proposition by
high level movie person that told him

2981
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:44,020
this is how the game is
played and did he do it?

2982
01:16:44,021 --> 01:16:47,130
I mean that's why he's not in
movies or why are you using today?

2983
01:16:47,131 --> 01:16:48,700
What you look at guys who are killing it,

2984
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:49,720
super skeptical.

2985
01:16:49,730 --> 01:16:52,480
Hip had been coming out.

2986
01:16:52,481 --> 01:16:54,010
Now Donald Sterling,

2987
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,570
look at these beautiful black bodies.

2988
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:56,060
What does that,

2989
01:16:56,060 --> 01:16:58,970
it's something that I heard about before
he got in trouble that this is why a

2990
01:16:58,971 --> 01:17:02,690
lot of players didn't want to play for
him because he was known to bring people

2991
01:17:02,691 --> 01:17:05,780
down in the locker room to look at
his players showering and whatnot.

2992
01:17:09,150 --> 01:17:10,010
Why is everyone so

2993
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:10,940
fucking creepy?

2994
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:13,010
Why can't people be cool?

2995
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:14,330
Be Cool man.

2996
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,120
But him and my idea about B,

2997
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:16,560
go back.

2998
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,393
Watch your kids.

2999
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:18,410
Watch your motherfucking.

3000
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:21,000
Don't let your kids be around
weird fucking agents and take,

3001
01:17:22,310 --> 01:17:24,710
don't let your kids get into acting.

3002
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:26,840
Do not let your kids get in position.

3003
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:27,860
But it worked out well.

3004
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:31,050
You know the other thing is like
look at what happened with that uh,

3005
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:32,420
Sandusky guy.

3006
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:34,520
That guy was taking care of kids.

3007
01:17:34,521 --> 01:17:35,570
Like his whole thing was like,

3008
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:35,811
hey,

3009
01:17:35,811 --> 01:17:37,430
I do charitable work with children.

3010
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:38,361
You know,

3011
01:17:38,361 --> 01:17:41,150
I do charitable work and
I take care of your kids.

3012
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:41,481
Yeah.

3013
01:17:41,481 --> 01:17:42,080
I'm just,

3014
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,820
I'm just all about helping kids.

3015
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:44,750
It's all about helping kids.

3016
01:17:44,751 --> 01:17:45,590
They're our future.

3017
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:46,970
How about Calvin went to summer camp.

3018
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:48,800
Does Dick Sucked my counselor.

3019
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:50,780
I think he got jacked
off his friend guys dig.

3020
01:17:50,830 --> 01:17:51,663
So

3021
01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:54,740
it's funny cause it's,

3022
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:56,800
I'm not advocating any of that.

3023
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:57,920
It's that famous guys,

3024
01:17:57,921 --> 01:18:02,080
a famous dude in the UK who died and
then they found out what does that,

3025
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:02,923
what's that guys name?

3026
01:18:03,180 --> 01:18:04,280
Jimmy Seville.

3027
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:08,110
What he do was like,

3028
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,470
he was super famous,

3029
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:10,700
super famous.

3030
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,830
He had a big talk show in,

3031
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:13,713
in England.

3032
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:15,690
Benny Hill.

3033
01:18:15,790 --> 01:18:16,070
Yeah.

3034
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:16,903
That's the guy.

3035
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:18,321
No Shit.

3036
01:18:18,321 --> 01:18:20,090
He fucks look at the picture above him.

3037
01:18:20,120 --> 01:18:22,940
Look at that picture above with the
red glasses above with the crazy hair.

3038
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:23,521
One more the,

3039
01:18:23,521 --> 01:18:25,400
Oh my God.

3040
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:27,980
With that fucking guy.

3041
01:18:27,981 --> 01:18:29,180
You should be slapped.

3042
01:18:29,330 --> 01:18:31,100
Imagine that guy putting
his dick in your mouth.

3043
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,780
Is there a documentary on him?

3044
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:33,270
Yeah.

3045
01:18:33,270 --> 01:18:33,980
Yeah.

3046
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:34,813
What's that call?

3047
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:35,670
Cause Hey,

3048
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:39,740
she kept this a secret for a long
time because this guy was like a,

3049
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:40,191
uh,

3050
01:18:40,191 --> 01:18:42,170
a big star over there.

3051
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,110
Look at his mother fucking secret.

3052
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:45,770
Like the media,

3053
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,330
the people that occurred with him,

3054
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,740
like everyone knew that.

3055
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:49,573
Like,

3056
01:18:49,710 --> 01:18:51,830
what about the rose that go back to that.

3057
01:18:51,831 --> 01:18:53,870
What about law enforcement in the UK?

3058
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:54,710
You know what I mean?

3059
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:56,510
The roos knew Jimmy Seville.

3060
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:57,650
Seville is that,

3061
01:18:57,651 --> 01:18:58,371
I say it's Seville.

3062
01:18:58,371 --> 01:19:00,470
Documentary is a horrible misstep.

3063
01:19:00,530 --> 01:19:01,363
Oh,

3064
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:02,930
Louis Theroux is awesome.

3065
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:04,580
I doubt that he fucked anything up.

3066
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,940
That guy makes some of the best fucking
documentary's going and he's a month.

3067
01:19:07,970 --> 01:19:09,410
It's probably some,

3068
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:10,101
yeah,

3069
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:10,934
someone was a hater.

3070
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:11,910
Exactly.

3071
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:13,910
That is so heavy haters out there.

3072
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:14,661
Think about that.

3073
01:19:14,661 --> 01:19:19,320
Think about Donald Donald sub.

3074
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:19,531
No.

3075
01:19:19,531 --> 01:19:20,364
Ne.

3076
01:19:20,660 --> 01:19:21,120
Yeah.

3077
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:26,120
Suddenly there is a lot of re Jimmy
Savile gropes teenager in newly released

3078
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:27,500
Louis Theroux footage.

3079
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,950
Oh powerful show.

3080
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:32,300
Have you seen the stuff that Joe Biden,

3081
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:33,141
Joe Biden,

3082
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:35,120
the former vice president do?

3083
01:19:35,121 --> 01:19:38,270
There's videos on him like at the White
House and taking pictures with kids.

3084
01:19:38,271 --> 01:19:39,280
Did you know looking at,

3085
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:39,920
we've seen that.

3086
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:40,131
Really?

3087
01:19:40,131 --> 01:19:40,850
I haven't seen,

3088
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:41,780
have you seen that shit?

3089
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,370
He's like groping them and shit.

3090
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,530
It just think he's super
awkward with this guy's running.

3091
01:19:45,531 --> 01:19:46,550
When you're untouchable,

3092
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,980
when there's no way you're going
to get busted for anything.

3093
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:50,720
Murdered child molestation.

3094
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:51,770
Did he don't give a fuck.

3095
01:19:51,771 --> 01:19:52,210
He just,

3096
01:19:52,210 --> 01:19:54,170
and I don't give a fuck who you are.

3097
01:19:54,171 --> 01:19:56,810
You grabbing my kid anywhere appropriate.

3098
01:19:56,870 --> 01:19:58,190
There's a lot and he's like,

3099
01:19:58,580 --> 01:19:59,360
dude,

3100
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,590
I got sick bastard.

3101
01:20:00,620 --> 01:20:02,930
It looks like we said that there
muffs there and just told her secret.

3102
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:06,220
The problem is you've
taken like a screenshot.

3103
01:20:07,930 --> 01:20:08,130
I've

3104
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:08,851
heard the audio.

3105
01:20:08,851 --> 01:20:09,570
You could hear that.

3106
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:10,470
What he says to these,

3107
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:11,433
what does he say?

3108
01:20:11,670 --> 01:20:12,810
Creepy ass shit.

3109
01:20:12,930 --> 01:20:13,741
Like get like what?

3110
01:20:13,741 --> 01:20:14,640
Like do they just keep,

3111
01:20:14,641 --> 01:20:15,360
just keep,

3112
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,081
he's taking pictures.

3113
01:20:16,081 --> 01:20:17,220
All these kids and he's just like,

3114
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:17,390
ah.

3115
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:19,230
I just whispering in their ear and Oh,

3116
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,064
you're beautiful.

3117
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:21,840
You of a big government creep.

3118
01:20:21,930 --> 01:20:23,010
Oh,

3119
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:25,621
studio of this.

3120
01:20:25,621 --> 01:20:26,251
These are stills,

3121
01:20:26,251 --> 01:20:27,870
but there's actually video of this shit,

3122
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:29,160
and this is by the way,

3123
01:20:29,161 --> 01:20:30,330
what you're seeing in public,

3124
01:20:30,331 --> 01:20:30,990
right?

3125
01:20:30,990 --> 01:20:31,291
Yeah.

3126
01:20:31,291 --> 01:20:31,891
He don't care.

3127
01:20:31,891 --> 01:20:33,050
They don't give a shit not to,

3128
01:20:33,051 --> 01:20:33,990
not to deals and care.

3129
01:20:33,991 --> 01:20:34,291
It's just,

3130
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:37,590
that's a small version of probably
what he's like behind closed doors.

3131
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:37,861
If you're,

3132
01:20:37,861 --> 01:20:42,000
if you're a big Hollywood act or maybe
you're not and you didn't get sexually

3133
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:44,540
harassed or pissed off right now,

3134
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:45,160
know what I'm saying?

3135
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:45,960
Like what the fuck?

3136
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:48,490
If you're an actress and you
worked with Harvey Weinstein,

3137
01:20:48,491 --> 01:20:50,010
he never tried to suck his dick.

3138
01:20:50,010 --> 01:20:50,720
You're like,

3139
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,553
what

3140
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:54,030
the fuck is wrong with my face?

3141
01:20:55,390 --> 01:20:56,820
They're really going after him.

3142
01:20:56,821 --> 01:20:57,654
That seems weird.

3143
01:20:58,130 --> 01:20:58,980
It doesn't seem weird,

3144
01:20:58,981 --> 01:20:59,131
dude,

3145
01:20:59,131 --> 01:20:59,701
but hell yeah.

3146
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:02,040
You're going after a
guy's entire business.

3147
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:02,910
Here's the thing.

3148
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:04,080
He's one of many.

3149
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:07,680
There's gotta be like a bunch of
people that ran their business.

3150
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,990
That one Weinstein there.

3151
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:11,070
They say like in Hollywood,

3152
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:11,910
like my age,

3153
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:12,240
just like,

3154
01:21:12,240 --> 01:21:12,571
oh no.

3155
01:21:12,571 --> 01:21:12,811
Yeah,

3156
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:14,040
it's about time you got kind of like,

3157
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:14,940
what the fuck?

3158
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:17,930
Everyone knew this one new contract.

3159
01:21:18,150 --> 01:21:19,500
It was in his contract.

3160
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:24,450
The way he had his contracts set up was
like they had a certain amount of money

3161
01:21:24,451 --> 01:21:28,140
that he would have to pay if he had a
sexual harassment claim against him.

3162
01:21:28,530 --> 01:21:29,041
It was like,

3163
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:29,874
it was a thing for him.

3164
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:33,900
Like he had so many claims that's like
first offense was a hundred thousand

3165
01:21:33,901 --> 01:21:34,501
second offense.

3166
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:38,750
My 250003rd offense
with $750,000 for third,

3167
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:40,050
fourth offense was a million.

3168
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:42,630
Who would get it written
into his fucking contract?

3169
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:43,623
Miramax,

3170
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,710
his contract with the Weinstein
company like Merrimack.

3171
01:21:47,620 --> 01:21:48,720
Explain that contract.

3172
01:21:48,721 --> 01:21:49,440
Like they'd have to,

3173
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,780
he'd have to pay a hundred thousands yes.

3174
01:21:51,890 --> 01:21:52,100
Could,

3175
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,310
they're protecting themselves,

3176
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:54,691
show Ras.

3177
01:21:54,691 --> 01:21:55,680
When they sacked him,

3178
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:55,951
they go,

3179
01:21:55,951 --> 01:21:56,101
okay.

3180
01:21:56,101 --> 01:21:59,110
The first time he fucked with one of
these guys going to be 100,000 second time

3181
01:21:59,111 --> 01:22:00,780
and see it's not just shit.

3182
01:22:00,781 --> 01:22:01,200
Yes.

3183
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:01,711
I mean he was,

3184
01:22:01,711 --> 01:22:02,760
it was so prominent.

3185
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:03,300
Yes.

3186
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:03,871
It was such a,

3187
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:04,150
she,

3188
01:22:04,150 --> 01:22:06,690
it was so known of what he would do.

3189
01:22:06,691 --> 01:22:07,081
And look,

3190
01:22:07,081 --> 01:22:09,610
even Quentin Tarantino said that
he did it to his ex girlfriend.

3191
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:10,650
Quiet Taryn.

3192
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:11,760
Tito said he knew about it.

3193
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:11,881
Yeah,

3194
01:22:11,881 --> 01:22:13,770
he did it to Mira Sorvino dude,

3195
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,620
and could Harvey Weinstein
get any fucking uglier?

3196
01:22:17,940 --> 01:22:18,860
He's a kid.

3197
01:22:18,870 --> 01:22:20,120
He's got a young ass wise,

3198
01:22:20,121 --> 01:22:21,480
so he looks like a troll.

3199
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:25,230
He know what he looks like is a sexual
Predator in a Harvey Weinstein movie.

3200
01:22:25,260 --> 01:22:25,710
Correct?

3201
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,750
Like it was a shitty lifetime movie.

3202
01:22:27,751 --> 01:22:28,080
Like,

3203
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:28,411
come on,

3204
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:30,510
let's do a little bit of
that legs unrealistic.

3205
01:22:30,511 --> 01:22:31,231
He's hideous.

3206
01:22:31,231 --> 01:22:31,551
I think.

3207
01:22:31,551 --> 01:22:31,871
You know what?

3208
01:22:31,871 --> 01:22:35,910
I think he's so bad looking at the
girls that he's harassing them.

3209
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:38,700
Most of them bitches are
fucking trash anyways.

3210
01:22:38,701 --> 01:22:39,160
You know what I mean?

3211
01:22:39,160 --> 01:22:39,250
No,

3212
01:22:39,250 --> 01:22:39,361
no,

3213
01:22:39,361 --> 01:22:39,571
no.

3214
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:41,640
Here's the crisis and distracted.

3215
01:22:41,641 --> 01:22:42,480
What about the kids?

3216
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:43,350
Fuck them bitches.

3217
01:22:43,351 --> 01:22:44,470
What about the kids that's going on?

3218
01:22:44,471 --> 01:22:45,271
I don't focus on that.

3219
01:22:45,271 --> 01:22:46,104
Those girls are trash,

3220
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:46,951
just actress.

3221
01:22:46,951 --> 01:22:47,760
But here's the question.

3222
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,140
Here's the problem was what
Whitney told me when he says yes,

3223
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:51,601
she,

3224
01:22:51,601 --> 01:22:52,530
she knows her shit.

3225
01:22:52,590 --> 01:22:53,710
What she said is she,

3226
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:58,380
there's a lot of girls that aren't saying
a word because they did fuck them and

3227
01:22:58,381 --> 01:22:59,760
they caught them for parts.

3228
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,710
They fucked him for like editing,

3229
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:02,161
of course,

3230
01:23:02,161 --> 01:23:05,050
fucked him for a lot of
things that Donald Trump.

3231
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:11,860
But that this is like a standard thing
that Weinstein would do and women agreed

3232
01:23:11,861 --> 01:23:15,810
to it because he was a power from mother
fucker that could get them the world

3233
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,673
hold up.

3234
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:17,501
However many,

3235
01:23:17,501 --> 01:23:20,020
whatever 50 girls are coming
out with claims against him,

3236
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,560
he's probably fucked 5,000
who aren't coming out.

3237
01:23:23,590 --> 01:23:27,130
I think that's probably a real number
and ridiculously hot girls we all know

3238
01:23:27,131 --> 01:23:28,030
about now what?

3239
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:29,710
I suck his dick to be the next Batman.

3240
01:23:30,010 --> 01:23:30,490
Yeah,

3241
01:23:30,490 --> 01:23:31,001
probably,

3242
01:23:31,001 --> 01:23:31,834
man,

3243
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,011
Donald's,

3244
01:23:33,011 --> 01:23:33,281
Ronnie,

3245
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:34,810
Darren's you to focus on the kids.

3246
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:35,883
Here we go.

3247
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,590
Well that's,

3248
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:37,423
that's certainly an issue,

3249
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:40,990
but that's fuck for parts.

3250
01:23:40,991 --> 01:23:41,560
You know what I mean?

3251
01:23:41,560 --> 01:23:41,681
Well,

3252
01:23:41,681 --> 01:23:43,180
don't you remember Brian Singer?

3253
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,460
Remember that guy who is the x men guy?

3254
01:23:45,461 --> 01:23:49,060
That guy got busted because some 17 year
old boy was saying that he got used by

3255
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:52,330
him at a party and they would pass them
around to all their friends and had all

3256
01:23:52,331 --> 01:23:52,960
these buoys.

3257
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:53,560
What guy?

3258
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:55,120
Bryan singer and the guy goes,

3259
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:55,461
no,

3260
01:23:55,461 --> 01:23:55,541
no,

3261
01:23:55,541 --> 01:23:56,380
no x men.

3262
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:57,243
Oh my bet.

3263
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:01,870
X files is talking about the
guy with x files x men away.

3264
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:02,980
The famous director.

3265
01:24:03,010 --> 01:24:03,340
Oh yeah,

3266
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,030
that's the guy.

3267
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:04,870
He's in the movie.

3268
01:24:04,930 --> 01:24:05,081
Oh,

3269
01:24:05,081 --> 01:24:05,861
an open secret.

3270
01:24:05,861 --> 01:24:06,694
I'm sure it's about,

3271
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:07,570
it's about him.

3272
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:08,081
Hold up.

3273
01:24:08,081 --> 01:24:10,300
He would that he was just some dude like

3274
01:24:12,370 --> 01:24:12,880
here he goes,

3275
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,330
look at that.

3276
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:13,841
It's sad.

3277
01:24:13,841 --> 01:24:16,810
Turn behind La Party scene
that took down Brian Singer.

3278
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:21,490
Like he would have all these like young
boys with them and there's a picture of

3279
01:24:21,491 --> 01:24:22,330
them at a pool.

3280
01:24:22,331 --> 01:24:23,680
It is fucking high.

3281
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:24,543
Larry's.

3282
01:24:24,640 --> 01:24:25,473
There's like,

3283
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:25,960
let's drop,

3284
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:26,650
scroll back up.

3285
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:29,980
Look at this picture like look at him
and all these young boys that Tim on the

3286
01:24:29,981 --> 01:24:30,380
right,

3287
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:33,400
that's him above with the glasses or no,

3288
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:36,140
the one with the arm wrapped
around like yellow bass.

3289
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:38,650
The glasses see him with
his arm wrapped around.

3290
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,910
You've got you wrapped around that boy.

3291
01:24:39,950 --> 01:24:40,741
Put his hand on that guy.

3292
01:24:40,741 --> 01:24:41,530
The kid's chest.

3293
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,191
What the kid looks like.

3294
01:24:42,191 --> 01:24:43,270
He's off 16 right?

3295
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:47,170
So there's a picture of him at a
party that he threw at his place.

3296
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:52,500
That is hilarious because that party
has all these young twinks in a pool and

3297
01:24:53,651 --> 01:24:55,450
the pool's lights are red.

3298
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:55,960
Like,

3299
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:59,260
like they butt fuck so much
that they just bled out.

3300
01:24:59,261 --> 01:25:01,380
And the whole pool became red right there.

3301
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:02,763
Look at that.

3302
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:03,820
Tell me it doesn't look like that.

3303
01:25:03,821 --> 01:25:04,540
Fuck man.

3304
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,440
That's party a brown

3305
01:25:08,050 --> 01:25:09,070
Jesus guys.

3306
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:10,450
Are they all under age?

3307
01:25:10,990 --> 01:25:11,321
No,

3308
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:12,160
probably not.

3309
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:13,660
But nothing's wrong with if,

3310
01:25:13,670 --> 01:25:15,010
does anyone know how many of them were,

3311
01:25:15,011 --> 01:25:16,680
but some of them
apparently were under age.

3312
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:17,740
Holy Shit.

3313
01:25:17,741 --> 01:25:19,660
It just seems like that's a cock fest.

3314
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:24,310
If you're a young boy and you're trying
to be an actor in Hollywood or a singer,

3315
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:26,380
how are you going to avoid that shit?

3316
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,270
Look at these fucking parties.

3317
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:30,010
All these guys that hands on each other.

3318
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:30,521
Well,

3319
01:25:30,521 --> 01:25:32,230
if the thing about gay guys,

3320
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:32,591
right?

3321
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:37,591
It's like a lot of gay guys
like guys that look younger,

3322
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:40,510
they like like cute God.

3323
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:41,861
Twinks he don't,

3324
01:25:41,861 --> 01:25:42,491
they call them twinks.

3325
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:43,300
You don't have a lot of hair.

3326
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:46,480
Which really funny because a nd
what the fuck's his name from?

3327
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:47,343
Uh,

3328
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:48,840
the guy from a,

3329
01:25:49,360 --> 01:25:50,560
that runs bravo.

3330
01:25:50,590 --> 01:25:51,110
What was I gonna say?

3331
01:25:51,110 --> 01:25:51,280
Oh,

3332
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:51,880
Andy Cohen.

3333
01:25:51,880 --> 01:25:52,121
Yeah,

3334
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:52,660
that guy.

3335
01:25:52,660 --> 01:25:54,610
He got in trouble for
saying twink and he's gay.

3336
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,060
Really?

3337
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:55,301
Yeah,

3338
01:25:55,301 --> 01:25:56,051
he's King Shit.

3339
01:25:56,051 --> 01:25:56,884
He's awesome.

3340
01:25:57,540 --> 01:25:57,991
Everything.

3341
01:25:57,991 --> 01:26:00,130
Twink is like a thin,

3342
01:26:00,490 --> 01:26:01,420
hairless,

3343
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:03,100
like grew young,

3344
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:03,621
young,

3345
01:26:03,621 --> 01:26:04,130
skinny

3346
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,070
on Jake.

3347
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:08,390
Sorry Darren till
walking into the octagon.

3348
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:10,310
Let's actually watch this fight cause he,

3349
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:11,121
I get creeped out.

3350
01:26:11,121 --> 01:26:13,380
We all have kids and I
feel sick after all that.

3351
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,900
It makes it makes me sick.

3352
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,010
Jesus Christ,

3353
01:26:16,011 --> 01:26:16,640
man.

3354
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:17,420
Yeah.

3355
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:20,110
Well Corey Feldman apparently has
been talking a lot about it too.

3356
01:26:20,910 --> 01:26:22,070
That was crazy.

3357
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:23,930
It's crazy,

3358
01:26:24,110 --> 01:26:25,850
but the question is why is he crazy?

3359
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,860
Is he crazy because he was molested.

3360
01:26:27,930 --> 01:26:28,200
He meet.

3361
01:26:28,200 --> 01:26:30,890
It hasn't say he doesn't name names,

3362
01:26:30,891 --> 01:26:31,790
but maybe he will.

3363
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:36,940
If someone said 80% of kids in Hollywood
or in the entertainment business have

3364
01:26:37,881 --> 01:26:41,270
had some kind of run in with
someone trying to molest him,

3365
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:42,080
would you believe it?

3366
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:42,650
Yes.

3367
01:26:42,650 --> 01:26:43,370
80% yes.

3368
01:26:43,370 --> 01:26:44,203
I would say,

3369
01:26:44,640 --> 01:26:45,260
I don't know.

3370
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,880
I don't want to give out crazy numbers.

3371
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:48,680
I would say a large number.

3372
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:53,830
I wouldn't be cycling Olympic team wrap
up because I think there's legitimate

3373
01:26:54,351 --> 01:26:58,160
agents is the legitimate managers and I
think Disney has a pretty great record.

3374
01:26:59,770 --> 01:27:00,650
They're probably legit,

3375
01:27:00,651 --> 01:27:01,910
but those ones don't get any work.

3376
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,310
It seems like it celebrates,

3377
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,990
like they just hook each other
up and they're just looking for,

3378
01:27:06,140 --> 01:27:06,600
uh,

3379
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:07,550
they're only going to,

3380
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:08,570
some of them do.

3381
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:10,760
There's definitely predators
that are organized.

3382
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:13,340
Definitely no one ever
made any advances that you,

3383
01:27:13,341 --> 01:27:14,090
Joe.

3384
01:27:14,090 --> 01:27:14,630
No,

3385
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:14,991
never.

3386
01:27:14,991 --> 01:27:15,710
Nothing.

3387
01:27:15,710 --> 01:27:16,071
Not like,

3388
01:27:16,071 --> 01:27:16,251
Hey,

3389
01:27:16,251 --> 01:27:17,450
come give me a better comic.

3390
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:21,480
Alex John said he got molested in
Hollywood when the Alex Jones did.

3391
01:27:21,481 --> 01:27:25,220
Alex Jones talked about that probably
roofing himself walked into a party and I

3392
01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:27,860
remember he was in that
movie with Keanu Reeves.

3393
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:30,050
He was in the movie with Kiana re yes.

3394
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:30,231
Yeah.

3395
01:27:30,231 --> 01:27:30,890
That one.

3396
01:27:30,890 --> 01:27:32,060
Animated Yay.

3397
01:27:33,080 --> 01:27:34,040
Wake or something.

3398
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:35,181
Life.

3399
01:27:35,181 --> 01:27:35,830
Waking life.

3400
01:27:35,830 --> 01:27:35,990
Yeah.

3401
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:36,870
It was a great mood.

3402
01:27:36,871 --> 01:27:38,270
He was in that he was driving.

3403
01:27:38,271 --> 01:27:41,750
This was before anybody knew who Alex
was and I was friends with him even back

3404
01:27:41,751 --> 01:27:42,350
then.

3405
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:42,891
But he,

3406
01:27:42,891 --> 01:27:43,101
uh,

3407
01:27:43,101 --> 01:27:44,900
they animated him ranting,

3408
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:47,210
driving down the street and see
you play some of that place.

3409
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:48,403
There it is.

3410
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:53,320
Rolling across the picket line,

3411
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:54,273
lay down,

3412
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:55,660
lay down Gi.

3413
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:59,200
We saw it all through the 20th
century and now the 21st century.

3414
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:02,740
It's time to stand up and realize that
we should not allow ourselves to be

3415
01:28:02,741 --> 01:28:04,180
crammed into this rat maze.

3416
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,890
We should not submit
the him and I station.

3417
01:28:07,120 --> 01:28:08,200
I don't know about you,

3418
01:28:08,201 --> 01:28:10,100
but I'm concerned with what's happening.

3419
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:12,280
I'm concerned with the structure.

3420
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:14,640
I'm concerned with the
systems of controls.

3421
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:18,640
Oh my life and those to
control it even more.

3422
01:28:19,210 --> 01:28:20,170
I want freedom.

3423
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,220
That's what I want.

3424
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:21,851
And that flips.

3425
01:28:21,851 --> 01:28:22,684
You should want

3426
01:28:23,850 --> 01:28:24,930
my favorite all time.

3427
01:28:24,931 --> 01:28:25,800
Alex Jones Club,

3428
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:27,930
he keeps getting mad swearing and he says,

3429
01:28:27,931 --> 01:28:28,764
I apologize,

3430
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:30,313
I shouldn't have said that.

3431
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:31,800
And he just can't easily like a hole,

3432
01:28:31,801 --> 01:28:33,630
but a compilation of him frequently.

3433
01:28:33,631 --> 01:28:37,200
So he did that one movie
and got molested instantly.

3434
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,820
Even even though he was animated,

3435
01:28:38,821 --> 01:28:39,654
they molested his,

3436
01:28:41,220 --> 01:28:42,390
that's what he said on his show.

3437
01:28:42,391 --> 01:28:46,890
He said it was during that movie
bus is at least 10% crazy though.

3438
01:28:46,891 --> 01:28:47,251
You agree?

3439
01:28:47,251 --> 01:28:48,084
Right?

3440
01:28:48,300 --> 01:28:48,780
What was that?

3441
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:50,010
He's at least 10% crazy.

3442
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:53,600
He's a but on the stuff
that he reports about,

3443
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:54,530
uh,

3444
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:56,250
85% correct.

3445
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:57,420
That's probably a good number.

3446
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:58,980
At least 80 right?

3447
01:28:59,310 --> 01:29:01,910
80% he's talking about
some that's probably legit.

3448
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,900
Occasionally he goes off the
rails and that hurts them.

3449
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,710
But that's okay.

3450
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:07,260
You can't be 100% right.

3451
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:11,430
But the problem is he's always looking
for conspiracies that might not exist and

3452
01:29:11,431 --> 01:29:14,040
then people can discredit
it because of the misses.

3453
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,830
You gotta take some
swings and hit a home run.

3454
01:29:15,831 --> 01:29:16,680
You know it's true.

3455
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,530
When you're making all these accusations,

3456
01:29:19,531 --> 01:29:19,861
you know,

3457
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:21,000
against criminals,

3458
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,740
a couple of them are not going to stick.

3459
01:29:22,741 --> 01:29:23,101
You know,

3460
01:29:23,101 --> 01:29:25,680
and you might be wrong about a
couple of murders here and there,

3461
01:29:25,681 --> 01:29:26,880
but they're still murderers.

3462
01:29:27,150 --> 01:29:30,720
So we should focus on the fact
that Alex Jones on Info wars,

3463
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:31,620
if you,

3464
01:29:31,620 --> 01:29:34,950
if you'd think that's a
fake news station to get,

3465
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:38,970
then you've been brainwashed because
that's where most of the truth is coming

3466
01:29:38,971 --> 01:29:39,211
from.

3467
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:40,410
It's coming from Info wars,

3468
01:29:40,411 --> 01:29:42,090
my man and the mainstream media,

3469
01:29:42,120 --> 01:29:45,960
the mainstream media is trying to
convince you that info wars is a hundred

3470
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,640
percent fake news when
they're the fake fakeness,

3471
01:29:47,670 --> 01:29:47,881
bro.

3472
01:29:47,881 --> 01:29:48,540
My man,

3473

A little bit.

3477
01:29:51,421 --> 01:29:52,170
It looks like is his,

3478

01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:54,923
You'll see it.

3481
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,500

3482
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:01,240
I love cowboy got messed up hair.

3483
01:30:02,460 --> 01:30:04,010
I like to see a cowboy part of that.

3484
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:04,883

3485
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:05,730

01:30:05,730 --> 01:30:06,563
See Ya.

3487
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:10,890
Oh maybe no one has a
receding hairline like that.

3488
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:11,721
I do my shit.

3489
01:30:11,721 --> 01:30:12,554
It's way worse.

3490
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:13,231
Look at mind.

3491
01:30:13,231 --> 01:30:14,380
No it is not.

3492
01:30:15,210 --> 01:30:17,430
I like the new a hairstyle you rocking.

3493
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:18,773
I like that.

3494
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,140
Shaved on the stock.

3495
01:30:21,110 --> 01:30:23,100
You look like you look
like a guy from fury.

3496
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:23,980
You seen that movie?

3497
01:30:23,980 --> 01:30:25,650
You copy freshly haircut.

3498
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:28,620
I do this all the time but when you
see me at grows out a little bit.

3499
01:30:28,621 --> 01:30:30,870
But once every two months I cut my hair.

3500
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:32,040
We've got a big day tomorrow so yeah,

3501
01:30:32,050 --> 01:30:32,883
cause you're here.

3502
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,790
Hell yeah.

3503
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:35,430
I still have no Denny's doing combat.

3504
01:30:35,490 --> 01:30:36,270
Get to tomorrow.

3505
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,103
Oh Shit.

3506
01:30:37,110 --> 01:30:38,000
Is He really who we are?

3507
01:30:38,280 --> 01:30:39,660
I put together a special match.

3508
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:43,590
It's an alternate match for the four
man tournament that boogey man's doing.

3509
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:44,910
Boogie man is doing combat.

3510
01:30:44,911 --> 01:30:46,190
You'd get to Oh shit.

3511
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,033
Think about that shit.

3512
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:50,790
And then Denny is fighting another
black belt and just an alternate single

3513
01:30:50,791 --> 01:30:51,061
match,

3514
01:30:51,061 --> 01:30:53,430
which is going to be like
a little super fight.

3515
01:30:53,460 --> 01:30:56,460
So let me tell you what Vinny shoreman

is a very high on him.

3517
01:30:58,190 --> 01:30:58,381
You know,

3518
01:30:58,381 --> 01:30:59,790
Vinny is a big time,

3519
01:30:59,970 --> 01:31:00,390
uh,

3520
01:31:00,390 --> 01:31:01,680
Moitai commentator.

3521
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,600
He knows a lot of shit about Moitai tills.

3522
01:31:03,601 --> 01:31:08,160
A monster till was beating men at 15
years of age rent to Romanian one an eight

3523
01:31:08,161 --> 01:31:08,994

a broken foot at 17.

01:31:12,330 --> 01:31:13,260
Started training odor.

3526
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,980
There are Collin heroin from Kabuni.

3527
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:16,350
Uh,

3528

Lived in Brazil too.

3531
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:28,410
And he's a real rags to riches story.

3532
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:28,771
He got,

3533
01:31:28,771 --> 01:31:29,581
he got stabbed,

3534
01:31:29,581 --> 01:31:31,920
he had to go to Brazil
because he got stabbed twice.

3535
01:31:31,921 --> 01:31:32,754
Guy Right here,

3536
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:34,830
he got stabbed in Liverpool.

3537
01:31:34,890 --> 01:31:35,611
His coach was like,

3538
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:35,881
Yo man,

3539
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:36,840
if you want to be successful,

3540
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:37,890
you need to move to Brazil.

3541
01:31:37,891 --> 01:31:38,730
Move to Brazil.

3542
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,170
One undefeated there.

3543
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:41,190
Just cause it's so much shit.

3544
01:31:41,191 --> 01:31:42,900
And Liverpool stabbed another party.

3545
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,640
People are so fucking crazy.

3546
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:44,941
Yeah,

3547
01:31:44,941 --> 01:31:45,211

3548
01:31:45,211 --> 01:31:45,520

3549
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,400

lot of stabbings going on.

3550
01:31:47,401 --> 01:31:47,551
There's,

3553
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,440
And no one's banner nine
when it has a lot of stuff.

3554
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:54,780
Get stabbed and shot.

3555
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:55,231
Well,

3556
01:31:55,231 --> 01:31:55,921
if you ban knives,

3557
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:56,880

3558
01:31:57,030 --> 01:31:57,271

3559
01:31:57,271 --> 01:31:58,104
here we go.

3560
01:31:58,710 --> 01:31:59,730
Darren cowboys.

3561
01:32:00,490 --> 01:32:01,240
Here we go.

3562
01:32:01,240 --> 01:32:01,631
Here we go.

3563
01:32:01,631 --> 01:32:06,631
Scissors wrap people big till is first
of all he's the legit welterweight and

3564
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:12,550
Donald just swung and miss with a leg
kick and Donald's a slow starter man.

3565
01:32:12,890 --> 01:32:14,670
Tills it's a trouble fight tells.

3566
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,450
Got some good deals.

3567
01:32:15,450 --> 01:32:17,020
Oh Donald went for the take down.

3568
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,220
Tilt it down.

3569
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:18,670
Defenses.

3570
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:19,090
Good.

3571
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:19,870
Very good.

3572
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:21,790
Till defended such a dangerous,

3573
01:32:21,791 --> 01:32:23,020
we could have pulled guard right there.

3574
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:25,750
It tells a super high level kickboxer.

3575
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:28,870
You see good distance control already.

3576
01:32:29,650 --> 01:32:30,700
Oh Shit.

3577
01:32:30,701 --> 01:32:31,540
He just tagged him.

3578
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:33,033
He clipped him.

3579
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:33,371
Not,

3580
01:32:33,371 --> 01:32:34,050
not clean.

3581
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:34,330
You're here.

3582
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:34,451
How?

3583
01:32:34,451 --> 01:32:35,284
Till got the,

3584
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,310
Oh my God.

3585
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:38,243
Whoa.

3586
01:32:38,510 --> 01:32:39,700
Got To come forward at Donald.

3587
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:40,421
If you're going to beat him.

3588
01:32:40,421 --> 01:32:40,840
Katelyn,

3589
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,100
sit back and get comfortable.

3590
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:43,210
Well,

3591
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:45,250
he's a bigger fight or to look up.

3592
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:46,390
Oh Shit Dude.

3593
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:47,470
Oh Shit.

3594
01:32:47,471 --> 01:32:48,700
Just Dang them this.

3595
01:32:48,701 --> 01:32:49,630
This is a bad thing.

3596
01:32:49,960 --> 01:32:51,490
He's got to shoot and pull guard here.

3597
01:32:51,640 --> 01:32:51,851
Yeah,

3598
01:32:51,851 --> 01:32:53,580
this is a bad fire guard.

3599
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:54,350
Oh my God.

3600
01:32:54,350 --> 01:32:55,210
Something tagged.

3601
01:32:55,770 --> 01:32:56,890
He doesn't move his head,

3602
01:32:56,891 --> 01:32:57,724
man.

3603
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:01,270
The cowboys firing back
cowboys not out of it.

3604
01:33:01,271 --> 01:33:03,970
You got to remember all the times
cowboys been in trouble in the past.

3605
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,760
He's a slow start and then once
he gets going he's trouble.

3606
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:09,010
This guy legitimately
might be the best striker.

3607
01:33:09,011 --> 01:33:11,050
He falls and there is chance right here.

3608
01:33:11,230 --> 01:33:12,063
Jump on his back.

3609
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:12,911
Ooh,

3610
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:14,060
we've got a good fee.

3611
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,073
Get ups,

3612
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:17,133
Hillman.

3613
01:33:17,140 --> 01:33:17,741
You know what I'm saying?

3614
01:33:17,741 --> 01:33:19,660
Like you felt the in
some weird Brazil fights.

3615
01:33:19,661 --> 01:33:21,250
I'm sure it's been taking down a bunch.

3616
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:23,830
Could defense back up to his feet.

3617
01:33:24,640 --> 01:33:26,170
I don't know anything about this guy.

3618
01:33:26,171 --> 01:33:29,980
Fuck I d I didn't either at first
and I talked shit about him.

3619
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:30,821
He lashed out at me.

3620
01:33:30,821 --> 01:33:31,750
I did my research like,

3621
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,100
Oh fuck,

3622
01:33:33,370 --> 01:33:34,360
this kid is an oh,

3623
01:33:34,370 --> 01:33:35,680

3624
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:36,990
I was talking shit about them.

3625
01:33:37,010 --> 01:33:37,843
Could tell you the body.

3626
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:39,610
What's his name again?

3627
01:33:39,610 --> 01:33:41,410
Darren till Darren till.

3628
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,490
Fascinating story.

3629
01:33:42,890 --> 01:33:46,810
[inaudible] pull stories like Donald
has been doing a lot of other shit too.

3630
01:33:46,811 --> 01:33:48,190
Hasn't he been doing a movie?

3631
01:33:48,790 --> 01:33:49,660
A movie?

3632
01:33:49,750 --> 01:33:50,460
Yeah,

3633
01:33:50,460 --> 01:33:51,720
we clipped him TV show,

3634
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:53,740
low co from my upper cut there.

3635
01:33:54,610 --> 01:33:57,100
And then you got young till
who's a monster who's just,

3636
01:33:57,101 --> 01:33:59,710
this is all he's thinking
about the biggest options life.

3637
01:33:59,830 --> 01:34:00,421
Nice Jab.

3638
01:34:00,421 --> 01:34:04,210
I tell it's looking very good and good.

3639
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:06,010
Good distance control on the feet.

3640
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:07,180
How relaxed he is first.

3641
01:34:07,181 --> 01:34:09,280
First main event is
crazy and he's fucking,

3642
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:10,690
I can't get over how big he is.

3643
01:34:11,470 --> 01:34:12,191
Oh Dude.

3644
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:13,750
He's tuning cowboy up

3645
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,970
and he just doesn't
respect cowboys stress.

3646
01:34:18,971 --> 01:34:19,601
Hammonds are low.

3647
01:34:19,601 --> 01:34:21,550
Look at how low his hands or
he doesn't really give a shit.

3648
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:24,100
Well you gotta think cowboy
striking is good for MMA,

3649
01:34:24,340 --> 01:34:29,340
but at the level that you know you're
talking about like glory or you know,

3650
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:32,080
lion fight like real high
level Moyie Thai guy.

3651
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:32,950
How far did he go?

3652
01:34:34,430 --> 01:34:38,350
Well Darren Walker was just saying
what I miss that tournament in Romania.

3653
01:34:38,380 --> 01:34:39,370
Oh fuck that.

3654
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:42,810
Vinny shoreman who's a bit,

3655
01:34:42,820 --> 01:34:44,890
I'm trying to watch this
and talk at the same time.

3656
01:34:44,891 --> 01:34:47,140
Vinny shoreman oh that's a
good kick to the body cowboy.

3657
01:34:47,530 --> 01:34:49,060
Vinny shoreman is very high on this guy.

3658
01:34:49,061 --> 01:34:51,550
He says he's a very
legit Moy Thai fighter,

3659
01:34:51,850 --> 01:34:52,350
like the,

3660
01:34:52,350 --> 01:34:56,320
the people who were in the know and the
business are super hundred until super,

3661
01:34:56,321 --> 01:34:56,930
super.

3662
01:34:56,930 --> 01:35:00,260
You're seeing it here just from this
distance control and his footwork and

3663
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:00,531
movement.

3664
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:01,291
Like every time cowboy,

3665
01:35:01,291 --> 01:35:01,971
he's trying to kick him.

3666
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:03,590
He's a slide in a way at,

3667
01:35:03,640 --> 01:35:04,580
he's beautiful,

3668
01:35:04,581 --> 01:35:05,301
right jab too.

3669
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:06,650
And he's a southpaw too.

3670
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:07,910
And his,

3671
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:09,320
oh shit.

3672
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:11,570
He's landed straight left and he sat up,

3673
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,470
land that upper cut.

3674
01:35:12,471 --> 01:35:14,520
He's done that twice to cowboy cowboy.

3675
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:18,440
She's ducking down cowboys getting lit up.

3676
01:35:18,441 --> 01:35:19,274
Man,

3677
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:21,801
he's getting lit up,

3678
01:35:21,801 --> 01:35:23,360
but he's not having much success.

3679
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:23,780
You know,

3680
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,340
if you're the UFC though and you're,

3681
01:35:25,370 --> 01:35:26,330
you're looking for,

3682
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:26,661
you know,

3683
01:35:26,661 --> 01:35:28,040
fresh stars and new blood,

3684
01:35:28,041 --> 01:35:29,090
this is what you do and that,

3685
01:35:29,240 --> 01:35:29,571
yeah,

3686
01:35:29,571 --> 01:35:30,260
it is what you do.

3687
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:34,280
And Cowboy is the guy that will fight
anybody anywhere flies to fucking Poland

3688
01:35:34,281 --> 01:35:35,114
to find this kid,

3689
01:35:35,690 --> 01:35:35,961
you know,

3690
01:35:35,961 --> 01:35:36,860
and said,

3691
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,930
I didn't watch any footage on them.

3692
01:35:38,990 --> 01:35:39,950
I don't know shit about him.

3693
01:35:39,951 --> 01:35:41,180
I heard he's a good standup.

3694
01:35:41,181 --> 01:35:41,391
Good.

3695
01:35:41,391 --> 01:35:42,201
I love to strike,

3696
01:35:42,201 --> 01:35:43,520
which is why we love cowboy,

3697
01:35:43,550 --> 01:35:44,840
but it's a double edge sword in.

3698
01:35:44,841 --> 01:35:45,170
Yeah,

3699
01:35:45,170 --> 01:35:47,770
well especially is when you're
a big name like cowboys,

3700
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:48,770
a huge name.

3701
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:50,480
So for cowboy to fight,

3702
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:53,990
this guy who is arguably one of the best
strikers he's ever fought and he didn't

3703
01:35:53,991 --> 01:35:55,340
really look into a much,

3704
01:35:55,460 --> 01:35:56,740
but it does nothing for cowboys.

3705
01:35:56,741 --> 01:35:57,441
So you beat them to go?

3706
01:35:57,441 --> 01:35:57,561
Yeah,

3707
01:35:57,561 --> 01:35:59,030
he'd be the guy we'd never heard of.

3708
01:35:59,150 --> 01:36:00,070
You lose whole.

3709
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,860
We just got hurt.

3710
01:36:00,860 --> 01:36:01,693
He just got hurt.

3711
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:03,710
Darren just lit him up.

3712
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:05,173
This fuck it.

3713
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,750
Oh Bro.

3714
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:12,190
This kid cowboys trouble knees
till cowboys in big trouble.

3715
01:36:13,910 --> 01:36:14,391
Oh Shit.

3716
01:36:14,391 --> 01:36:14,800
This is,

3717
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,310
that's it.

3718
01:36:15,310 --> 01:36:15,800
That's it.

3719
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,250
How I just got stopped
first round smashed.

3720
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,170
Ran through what?

3721
01:36:21,171 --> 01:36:26,171
A story down this got ran
through a story on tender here.

3722
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:29,270
He just ran through cowboy.

3723
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:30,770
Just about ran through him.

3724
01:36:31,550 --> 01:36:32,060
Through him?

3725
01:36:32,060 --> 01:36:32,570
Yeah.

3726
01:36:32,570 --> 01:36:33,470
Just smashed him.

3727
01:36:33,471 --> 01:36:34,750
Smashed early.

3728
01:36:35,370 --> 01:36:35,840
Last.

3729
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,740
Just smashed him.

3730
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:38,870
This guy has the ability to maybe,

3731
01:36:39,790 --> 01:36:40,623
you know,

3732
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:41,690
contend for the belt.

3733
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:42,250
Oh,

3734
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:44,430
hunter hunter is taken out of his side.

3735
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:49,810
His only 24 it's 24 with that extensive
of a striking and he just made,

3736
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:52,460
he just turned into a fucking star,

3737
01:36:52,461 --> 01:36:54,890
at least in our small group of MMA.

3738
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,060
This is on fight pass.

3739
01:36:56,390 --> 01:37:00,890
There might prop 40,000 people watching
less talking about it might not even be

3740
01:37:00,891 --> 01:37:04,130
40,000 but this is bigger than that.

3741
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:05,180
Like however,

3742
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,380
watching this,

3743
01:37:06,410 --> 01:37:08,180
you put a youtube video taking a piss.

3744
01:37:08,181 --> 01:37:08,370
What is,

3745
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:09,160
it gets more beautiful.

3746
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,150
We have 40,000 watching on here.

3747
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:11,290
Yeah,

3748
01:37:11,290 --> 01:37:12,123
we're beating them.

3749
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:12,620
Yeah,

3750
01:37:12,620 --> 01:37:13,340
we're beating them.

3751
01:37:13,340 --> 01:37:16,730
But then when it sits for
10,000 remember those days?

3752
01:37:16,780 --> 01:37:17,071
Yeah,

3753
01:37:17,071 --> 01:37:19,910
115 hundred but when it
can look at that elbow,

3754
01:37:19,911 --> 01:37:20,630
we landed on him.

3755
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:21,620
Jesus Christ.

3756
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:22,731
Oh Dude.

3757
01:37:22,731 --> 01:37:24,470
He t tuned cowboy up.

3758
01:37:24,770 --> 01:37:24,951
I mean,

3759
01:37:24,951 --> 01:37:26,630
that is just an absolute beating.

3760
01:37:27,200 --> 01:37:28,580
I hate seeing it for cowboy like,

3761
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:30,560
and this is the reason why Kelby so big,

3762
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:31,850
but then it's also like it,

3763
01:37:31,851 --> 01:37:32,601
you're fucked you man,

3764
01:37:32,601 --> 01:37:34,640
because you're never going to be
world champion fighting like this.

3765
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:34,941
Well,

3766
01:37:34,941 --> 01:37:35,451
it's also,

3767
01:37:35,451 --> 01:37:38,090
cowboy has had a few of
these fights recently.

3768
01:37:38,091 --> 01:37:39,650
Mosfet all beat the shit out of him.

3769
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:40,680
You know,

3770
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:41,690
the Robbie Lawler fight,

3771
01:37:41,691 --> 01:37:43,100
his last fight was a rough fight.

3772
01:37:43,220 --> 01:37:43,910
Well some people,

3773
01:37:43,910 --> 01:37:44,180
you know,

3774
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:45,320
I don't think Calvin win that fight,

3775
01:37:45,321 --> 01:37:47,960
but it was a controversial
fight to get back to the judges.

3776
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:48,860
You know,

3777
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,420
some people think Calloway Roseville,

3778
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,011
I think cal,

3779
01:37:51,011 --> 01:37:51,890
they lost that fight.

3780
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:55,620
I think he'd lost too because especially
like Robbie really came on strong in

3781
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:56,311
that last round.

3782
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:56,851
The first round.

3783
01:37:56,851 --> 01:37:58,590
If you have ten eight it'd be a draw.

3784
01:37:58,650 --> 01:38:00,630
But cowboy is shaking his head,

3785
01:38:01,020 --> 01:38:03,450
his nose is smashed and we
lost three in a row brother.

3786
01:38:03,510 --> 01:38:03,980
Yeah,

3787
01:38:03,980 --> 01:38:04,360
that's a,

3788
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:05,101
that's a rough go.

3789
01:38:05,101 --> 01:38:08,730
And your cowboys age lost three in a
row and just got marked by a young kid.

3790
01:38:08,970 --> 01:38:11,130
A 24 year old kid just lit him on fire.

3791
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:13,550
24 year old stud though.

3792
01:38:13,551 --> 01:38:15,060
This is not just some random fucking,

3793
01:38:15,061 --> 01:38:15,510
yeah,

3794
01:38:15,510 --> 01:38:17,310
well that's why you don't fight
randoms and Poland though,

3795
01:38:17,550 --> 01:38:17,940
right?

3796
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:20,860
Well as it should be a 55 he's a 55 or,

3797
01:38:21,020 --> 01:38:24,090
I mean he's one of those guys that
went up to one 70 like design hills.

3798
01:38:24,091 --> 01:38:26,130
And generally that doesn't work though.

3799
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:27,240
It doesn't work though.

3800
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:27,601
Not,

3801
01:38:27,601 --> 01:38:27,811
I mean,

3802
01:38:27,811 --> 01:38:28,560
not that often.

3803
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:32,130
How you were just talking about Kevin
leak like cobble has killed himself at 55

3804
01:38:32,160 --> 01:38:36,060
but he was dominated at
55 cowboy never champion.

3805
01:38:36,060 --> 01:38:39,990
He got close to a belt
at 70 they did 55 well,

3806
01:38:40,010 --> 01:38:41,790
I mean he lost the belt at 55

3807
01:38:43,290 --> 01:38:47,640
we have to worry about how the cowboy
show ends because cowboy getting stopped

3808
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:50,870
like that and this fight like you gotta
wonder how many more of those we're

3809
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:51,870
going to see and what,

3810
01:38:51,900 --> 01:38:52,500
what does that,

3811
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:56,220
what tolls that going to take on cowboy
because of that style that he has.

3812
01:38:56,490 --> 01:38:56,671
You know,

3813
01:38:56,671 --> 01:38:59,370
because of the fact that he's willing
to fight anybody and because of the fact

3814
01:38:59,371 --> 01:39:00,900
that he spends his money like water,

3815
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:02,150
you know,

3816
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:02,341
game,

3817
01:39:02,341 --> 01:39:03,051
you play the law,

3818
01:39:03,051 --> 01:39:03,721
it's cowboy.

3819
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:05,840
Like that's the persona he has your cow.

3820
01:39:05,841 --> 01:39:08,800
We fighting went anywhere
and then once I stop,

3821
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:09,210
I know,

3822
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:11,970
that's what I'm saying is you
got to worry about how this,

3823
01:39:12,060 --> 01:39:13,170
how this story ends.

3824
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:15,420
Because when you 34 you don't get younger,

3825
01:39:16,410 --> 01:39:17,243
you just get older.

3826
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:18,240
But he's still a name.

3827
01:39:18,241 --> 01:39:19,800
So how many more fights
will they give them?

3828
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:20,011
Ooh,

3829
01:39:20,011 --> 01:39:20,844
look at this.

3830
01:39:20,920 --> 01:39:21,753
Look at that.

3831
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:23,550
That fucking right left Combo.

3832
01:39:23,551 --> 01:39:24,480
He just landed on him.

3833
01:39:25,860 --> 01:39:28,950
We should back this up and watch
it again because he tuned you.

3834
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:30,360
I'd love to hear what Tim is saying.

3835
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,253
Look at this.

3836
01:39:33,220 --> 01:39:34,240
Oh no,

3837
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:34,851
that was it.

3838
01:39:34,851 --> 01:39:35,100
Right?

3839
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:35,990
Those wicked.

3840
01:39:36,090 --> 01:39:38,570
I can't get over how
fucking big this kid is,

3841
01:39:38,571 --> 01:39:38,841
man.

3842
01:39:38,841 --> 01:39:39,890
For that weight class.

3843
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:41,930
Yeah.

3844
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:42,770
Gimme some volume.

3845
01:39:42,771 --> 01:39:43,190
Jeremy.

3846
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:45,050
He's given Cowboy Lotta love.

3847
01:39:53,450 --> 01:39:54,980
He's amazing for that as well.

3848
01:39:56,890 --> 01:39:58,510
Dan Hardee speaks English too.

3849
01:39:58,690 --> 01:39:59,560
He knows what he's saying.

3850
01:40:01,260 --> 01:40:01,931
You know English,

3851
01:40:01,931 --> 01:40:03,430
English from England.

3852
01:40:08,350 --> 01:40:09,470
Mike Perry,

3853
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:13,960
he'll jump in that fucking cage.

3854
01:40:13,961 --> 01:40:15,770
She will fuck my guy.

3855
01:40:16,070 --> 01:40:17,130
Perry platinum.

3856
01:40:17,131 --> 01:40:17,571
Mike Perry,

3857
01:40:17,571 --> 01:40:18,420
he's a tough guy.

3858
01:40:18,421 --> 01:40:19,470
He's a knockout artists.

3859
01:40:19,740 --> 01:40:20,580
He knocked out,

3860
01:40:20,581 --> 01:40:21,130
um,

3861
01:40:21,130 --> 01:40:21,900
uh,

3862
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:22,830
Jake Ellenberger,

3863
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:26,240
the Joanne Jo band.

3864
01:40:26,241 --> 01:40:26,910
I'm out.

3865
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:28,920
Struck him till would piece him up,

3866
01:40:28,921 --> 01:40:29,754
I think.

3867
01:40:30,270 --> 01:40:31,103
No,

3868
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,820
he's crazy man.

3869
01:40:34,970 --> 01:40:35,751
He is crazy.

3870
01:40:35,751 --> 01:40:36,920
But skill wise,

3871
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:38,173
he's nowhere near.

3872
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:40,040
Not even on the same planet.

3873
01:40:40,070 --> 01:40:42,950
Not even the same part of the
yard he does is really box.

3874
01:40:42,951 --> 01:40:43,310
Yeah.

3875
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:44,270
Well he's an animal.

3876
01:40:44,420 --> 01:40:44,781
I mean,

3877
01:40:44,781 --> 01:40:46,130
Mike Perry is a fucking animal.

3878
01:40:46,160 --> 01:40:46,580
No doubt.

3879
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:49,330
Found them all because he
or she is a strong guy.

3880
01:40:49,331 --> 01:40:50,570
He's got some serious power.

3881
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:51,170
He's from here.

3882
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:52,100
Paris from Florida.

3883
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:52,640
Yeah.

3884
01:40:52,640 --> 01:40:54,340
Strong with serious power.

3885
01:40:54,341 --> 01:40:56,680
But he's in he's way out class.

3886
01:40:56,681 --> 01:40:59,920
When he fights like a really good
striker like job answer was foot work.

3887
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:00,220
They just,

3888
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,740
they just avoid the big shot
and just pick them apart.

3889
01:41:02,830 --> 01:41:03,131
Yeah.

3890
01:41:03,131 --> 01:41:05,800
But if you play that game you
will not get a fucking Pluto.

3891
01:41:05,830 --> 01:41:07,420
This is a different guy though.

3892
01:41:07,570 --> 01:41:08,720
This Darren till is it?

3893
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:09,730
This is a different guy.

3894
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:11,903
Shoreman was saying,

3895
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:12,221
you know what?

3896
01:41:12,221 --> 01:41:13,930
I wish the remote right here.

3897
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:15,303
Run that bench.

3898
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:15,551
Yeah.

3899
01:41:15,551 --> 01:41:16,390
Run that bitch back.

3900
01:41:16,420 --> 01:41:17,320
Let's watch this again.

3901
01:41:17,410 --> 01:41:19,010
I wish they would a enough,

3902
01:41:19,060 --> 01:41:21,370
they can't cause you need
the fight on fight pass by.

3903
01:41:21,371 --> 01:41:25,240
I wish they would air it like tomorrow
on Fox sports so you can so till he gets

3904
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:28,210
like more recognition because how many
people are going to see this beat down?

3905
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:29,111
That's a good question.

3906
01:41:29,111 --> 01:41:31,690
But the thing is like if
they aired on Fox sports,

3907
01:41:31,691 --> 01:41:32,231
Fox sports,

3908
01:41:32,231 --> 01:41:32,591
own it,

3909
01:41:32,591 --> 01:41:33,520
then how does that work?

3910
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:36,550
You do got a Brazilian
flag with his English flag.

3911
01:41:36,670 --> 01:41:36,851
Yeah.

3912
01:41:36,851 --> 01:41:38,350
That's him there for a while.

3913
01:41:38,351 --> 01:41:38,770
Training.

3914
01:41:38,770 --> 01:41:39,970
That's why eight years,

3915
01:41:39,971 --> 01:41:42,040
I think allow man total eight years.

3916
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:44,080
So he was like a little
kid when he went over that.

3917
01:41:44,081 --> 01:41:45,010
It's so nuts.

3918
01:41:45,340 --> 01:41:50,340
These 24 years old and this
is already this good God damn.

3919
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,270
Which this dome.

3920
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:53,410
Come on man,

3921
01:41:53,411 --> 01:41:54,490
that was so crisp.

3922
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:55,810
What show did he come up on?

3923
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:56,681
All right,

3924
01:41:56,681 --> 01:41:57,071
I'll ask me.

3925
01:41:57,071 --> 01:41:57,904
I don't know.

3926
01:41:58,090 --> 01:41:59,080
It's only going back to this,

3927
01:41:59,110 --> 01:42:00,210
if any just texted him.

3928
01:42:00,211 --> 01:42:00,551
He says,

3929
01:42:00,551 --> 01:42:01,930
I told you he is special.

3930
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:03,093
Well,

3931
01:42:03,110 --> 01:42:06,310
but a lot of odds makers barely
had Calloway is the favorite.

3932
01:42:06,311 --> 01:42:09,670
Callo was like a minus one 20
so there's a reason for it,

3933
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:10,450
you know?

3934
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:10,781
Yeah,

3935
01:42:10,781 --> 01:42:13,420
but people in the know no
tills a fucking monster.

3936
01:42:15,330 --> 01:42:16,120
Boom.

3937
01:42:16,120 --> 01:42:17,170
Crazy shit man.

3938
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:20,540
It's inserting call out
Mike Perry after that.

3939
01:42:20,541 --> 01:42:21,790
Maybe just once he another wind,

3940
01:42:21,791 --> 01:42:24,020
but my career is ramped in Jujitsu.

3941
01:42:24,770 --> 01:42:25,251
I don't know.

3942
01:42:25,251 --> 01:42:26,084
It's a good question.

3943
01:42:27,790 --> 01:42:28,550
Okay.

3944
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,610
Take down the fence.

3945
01:42:29,990 --> 01:42:30,823
Brazil.

3946
01:42:30,980 --> 01:42:31,191
Yeah,

3947
01:42:31,191 --> 01:42:31,970
he's there alone.

3948
01:42:31,970 --> 01:42:33,380
He also speaks Portuguese.

3949
01:42:33,740 --> 01:42:34,573
I'm sure.

3950
01:42:34,580 --> 01:42:35,900
So have them fight Brazil.

3951
01:42:37,650 --> 01:42:38,460
That'd be interesting,

3952
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:38,880
right?

3953
01:42:38,880 --> 01:42:39,420
Yeah.

3954
01:42:39,420 --> 01:42:41,730
I think the Brazilians
would totally love them.

3955
01:42:41,970 --> 01:42:42,571
Look at this shit.

3956
01:42:42,571 --> 01:42:44,910
You could just put up some
stuff from your phone.

3957
01:42:44,911 --> 01:42:45,744
Yeah.

3958
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:50,261
Let's,

3959
01:42:50,261 --> 01:42:50,560
uh,

3960
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:51,790
let's watch the fight again.

3961
01:42:52,240 --> 01:42:52,870
I'm trying to rewind.

3962
01:42:52,870 --> 01:42:55,320
Fucking cowboys knows everyone.

3963
01:42:56,550 --> 01:42:57,400
I think you don't want to,

3964
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:58,150
you can.

3965
01:42:58,150 --> 01:42:58,421
Yeah,

3966
01:42:58,421 --> 01:42:58,871
you can.

3967
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:02,920
But you have to use the remote and
click on it and then scroll backwards.

3968
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:04,383
Just doing that.

3969
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:05,950
Is it because it's streaming?

3970
01:43:05,980 --> 01:43:06,141
Yeah,

3971
01:43:06,141 --> 01:43:06,974
I think so.

3972
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:08,620
Cause it's still going on.

3973
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:09,933
It's not really.

3974
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:11,833
Yeah.

3975
01:43:12,050 --> 01:43:13,810
Tell boys nose looks fucked.

3976
01:43:13,870 --> 01:43:14,703
It looks fucked.

3977
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:15,071
Yeah.

3978
01:43:15,071 --> 01:43:16,930
Knows I feel for the dude.

3979
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:17,261
Yeah,

3980
01:43:17,261 --> 01:43:17,740
me too.

3981
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:18,573
Is it my phone?

3982
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:18,971
Yeah,

3983
01:43:18,971 --> 01:43:19,804
it is my phone.

3984
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:21,243
I love cowboy.

3985
01:43:23,060 --> 01:43:24,250
Just fight like that,

3986
01:43:24,520 --> 01:43:24,970
you know.

3987
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:25,840
But it's what we were saying.

3988
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:27,550
It's like how does that story end?

3989
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:28,710
How does anyone's story?

3990
01:43:28,920 --> 01:43:29,120
Yeah.

3991
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:33,160
But how does this story and
is very different than how's
the George Saint Pierre

3992
01:43:33,160 --> 01:43:37,480
Story and George St Pierre retires now
he's coming back to fight and Bisping the

3993
01:43:37,481 --> 01:43:42,481
cowboy stories different because cowboy
was never the champion and he loves this

3994
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:44,110
rough and tumble life.

3995
01:43:44,111 --> 01:43:44,510
You know,

3996
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:46,210
he loves the fact that he can just,

3997
01:43:46,510 --> 01:43:46,841
you know,

3998
01:43:46,841 --> 01:43:51,500
get on a flight and fight in Poland
and gotten kicked this young kid's ass.

3999
01:43:51,501 --> 01:43:51,980
But

4000
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,660
when it doesn't work out like this,

4001
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,040
like you just made a star,

4002
01:43:55,490 --> 01:43:57,890
like he led a dude become a star off them.

4003
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:02,240
Like for guys like us and people that a
visit the websites look at that fucking

4004
01:44:02,241 --> 01:44:03,110
straight one,

4005
01:44:03,111 --> 01:44:05,960
two man and that elbow in the clinch,

4006
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:10,220
he is setting them up with a lot of shit
to like throw in the straight left but

4007
01:44:10,221 --> 01:44:11,720
then turning it into an upper cut.

4008
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,033
Yeah.

4009
01:44:13,460 --> 01:44:14,930
Ooh God damn.

4010
01:44:14,940 --> 01:44:16,210
It's wrapped it on him too.

4011
01:44:16,260 --> 01:44:17,810
I wish we had another angle of that.

4012
01:44:18,020 --> 01:44:18,820
Ooh,

4013
01:44:18,820 --> 01:44:19,840
it's weird cause it's fights.

4014
01:44:19,841 --> 01:44:21,960
Before this you would see a stamp.

4015
01:44:22,030 --> 01:44:23,080
Sannup is good,

4016
01:44:23,081 --> 01:44:25,750
but he was winning by decisions
who want a split decision.

4017
01:44:25,751 --> 01:44:27,120
He had a draw really

4018
01:44:28,810 --> 01:44:32,170
maybe maybe knocking
people's socks off early on.

4019
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:33,303
Maybe

4020
01:44:34,120 --> 01:44:38,100
cowboy had a terrible training camp or
maybe the jet lag is fuck thing is just

4021
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:39,820
realizing he's just that comfortable.

4022
01:44:39,821 --> 01:44:40,210
Yeah,

4023
01:44:40,210 --> 01:44:40,901
he's that good.

4024
01:44:40,901 --> 01:44:42,850
He's 24 and he's also realizing,

4025
01:44:42,851 --> 01:44:43,011
look,

4026
01:44:43,011 --> 01:44:45,010
you're just watching his movement in this.

4027
01:44:45,011 --> 01:44:46,990
I'm not saying cowboy
had a bad training camp.

4028
01:44:46,991 --> 01:44:48,280
I'm saying this kid's a motherfucker.

4029
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,170
The way he landed that uppercut,

4030
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:51,161
the way he landed,

4031
01:44:51,161 --> 01:44:52,180
that one too,

4032
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:55,180
that jab left like my Perry.

4033
01:44:55,181 --> 01:44:56,260
Ask him for this fight.

4034
01:44:56,261 --> 01:44:57,094
It's like,

4035
01:44:57,160 --> 01:44:58,360
I guess he's there.

4036
01:44:58,610 --> 01:45:00,160
It'll still called him out.

4037
01:45:00,280 --> 01:45:00,850
I know.

4038
01:45:00,850 --> 01:45:02,000
It's just once a year item.

4039
01:45:02,290 --> 01:45:02,471
No,

4040
01:45:02,471 --> 01:45:06,570
because he's a name Mike Perry's name
God from Calloway to Perry though.

4041
01:45:07,060 --> 01:45:07,893
Good fight.

4042
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:08,710
Fun Fight.

4043
01:45:08,710 --> 01:45:09,560
Let him like,

4044
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:10,750
he's going to fight a brawler.

4045
01:45:10,990 --> 01:45:12,370
Let him show his skills.

4046
01:45:13,150 --> 01:45:13,391
I mean,

4047
01:45:13,391 --> 01:45:14,830
I would think that's a good fight for him.

4048
01:45:14,831 --> 01:45:15,130
Look,

4049
01:45:15,130 --> 01:45:16,870
this dude dude's just standing
up credit matchup for him.

4050
01:45:16,871 --> 01:45:17,041
Yeah,

4051
01:45:17,041 --> 01:45:18,160
it's a great matchup for her.

4052
01:45:18,161 --> 01:45:18,621
It has a,

4053
01:45:18,621 --> 01:45:19,510
a fight already though.

4054
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:20,060
Who's he?

4055
01:45:20,060 --> 01:45:20,893
Gotta fight?

4056
01:45:21,010 --> 01:45:22,180
Um,

4057
01:45:22,810 --> 01:45:23,643
I forget,

4058
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:24,990
but I'm pretty sure he has a,

4059
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:25,990
a matchup already.

4060
01:45:28,090 --> 01:45:28,923
Interesting.

4061
01:45:28,930 --> 01:45:29,770
Very interesting.

4062
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,010
Just a difference in
the level of technique.

4063
01:45:33,070 --> 01:45:35,230
You know what till can do,

4064
01:45:35,231 --> 01:45:36,070
he can do everything.

4065
01:45:36,340 --> 01:45:36,551
You know,

4066
01:45:36,551 --> 01:45:39,370
he's not just a guy that just
wades in and throws haymakers.

4067
01:45:39,700 --> 01:45:39,941
I mean,

4068
01:45:39,941 --> 01:45:40,751
he's like very,

4069
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,770
very technically proficient besides him.

4070
01:45:43,771 --> 01:45:44,450
But as you look,

4071
01:45:44,450 --> 01:45:45,400
you could get killed.

4072
01:45:45,430 --> 01:45:47,020
He could get fucking knocked out.

4073
01:45:47,260 --> 01:45:51,080
Mike Perry can knock out anybody you
fuck up and you zig when you should have

4074
01:45:51,100 --> 01:45:52,080
that fight.

4075
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:52,921
That's it.

4076
01:45:52,921 --> 01:45:54,610
Fucking tough fight for him too.

4077
01:45:54,670 --> 01:45:56,920
That's a great Santiago and no Byo.

4078
01:45:56,921 --> 01:45:58,070
Is Doug just speed?

4079
01:45:58,080 --> 01:45:58,840
Uh,

4080
01:45:58,840 --> 01:45:59,260
uh,

4081
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:00,130
Gunnar Nelson.

4082
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,840
It was with the finger poked with still.

4083
01:46:01,870 --> 01:46:02,261
Yeah.

4084
01:46:02,261 --> 01:46:03,360
That was a fucked up.

4085
01:46:03,780 --> 01:46:05,260
It was more than one finger poke.

4086
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:06,430
Well you beat them by finger.

4087
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:07,070
Yeah.

4088
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:08,840
Knocked when they be
on by finger poke boy.

4089
01:46:08,850 --> 01:46:09,683
He stopped him.

4090
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:10,911
Yeah.

4091
01:46:10,911 --> 01:46:12,510
The fingers were so fucked.

4092
01:46:12,730 --> 01:46:13,031
Yeah.

4093
01:46:13,031 --> 01:46:13,900
So fucked up.

4094
01:46:13,901 --> 01:46:16,330
And when you see the
replay of the finger pokes,

4095
01:46:16,331 --> 01:46:16,631
you're like,

4096
01:46:16,631 --> 01:46:19,300
wait a minute and almost looks like he
threw it as a part of his combination

4097
01:46:19,490 --> 01:46:20,520
four times in that fight.

4098
01:46:20,600 --> 01:46:21,760
Gunner ever get him to the ground.

4099
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,380
No Gun.

4100
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:25,310
I got fun early on from the eye posts.

4101
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:27,080
If you don't watch it,

4102
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,071
like in slow Mo,

4103
01:46:28,071 --> 01:46:28,581
if you just watch it,

4104
01:46:28,581 --> 01:46:29,061
oh my God.

4105
01:46:29,061 --> 01:46:29,781
Kevin looks like shit.

4106
01:46:29,781 --> 01:46:30,441
He's getting rocked.

4107
01:46:30,441 --> 01:46:31,274
What's going on here?

4108
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:31,881
You go back.

4109
01:46:31,881 --> 01:46:36,260
Watch in slow mo and it's just
I poke poke against the cage.

4110
01:46:36,350 --> 01:46:38,930
Poke motherfuckers doing
upper cut like that.

4111
01:46:40,220 --> 01:46:41,780
Fucking poke both eyes.

4112
01:46:41,781 --> 01:46:42,920
Here's the stoppage again.

4113
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:43,580
Dang.

4114
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:43,911
Dang.

4115
01:46:43,911 --> 01:46:44,510
Dang.

4116
01:46:44,510 --> 01:46:45,350
Oh Man.

4117
01:46:46,160 --> 01:46:47,420
The elbow already did it.

4118
01:46:49,180 --> 01:46:49,890
Did it.

4119
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:49,980
I

4120
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:52,740
mean he just beat the shit out of
a man and cowboy just crumpled.

4121
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:54,540
When was the last time you
saw cowboy and do this?

4122
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:57,030
And this is like dos Anjos days maybe.

4123
01:46:57,031 --> 01:46:57,864
Yeah.

4124
01:46:57,940 --> 01:46:58,773
Dosa doubled.

4125
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:00,360
Pedis was just a kick to the body,

4126
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:01,351
but he crumbled.

4127
01:47:01,351 --> 01:47:01,831
You know what I'm saying?

4128
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:03,810
Like I see my competition Raf man,

4129
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:04,793
Ralph.

4130
01:47:05,010 --> 01:47:05,843
Heartbreaking.

4131
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:06,511
Yeah,

4132
01:47:06,511 --> 01:47:07,950
I'm fucking real heartbreaker man.

4133
01:47:09,420 --> 01:47:11,010
But for that kid,

4134
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:13,320
you know that's a god
who was a great story.

4135
01:47:13,321 --> 01:47:14,280
Good kid too.

4136
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:16,590
And obviously you've got to build stars.

4137
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:17,700
That's how you do it.

4138
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:18,361
I mean,

4139
01:47:18,361 --> 01:47:19,470
not a fight path with yes.

4140
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,161
That's what happened.

4141
01:47:20,161 --> 01:47:20,431
Right?

4142
01:47:20,431 --> 01:47:21,270
Not on $5.

4143
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:23,170
That's not the way to do it.

4144
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:25,050
Give out the numbers on five paths.

4145
01:47:25,051 --> 01:47:26,100
Like did they tell you?

4146
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:26,461
Nope.

4147
01:47:26,461 --> 01:47:27,260
They didn't even tell you.

4148
01:47:27,260 --> 01:47:28,093
They're like

4149
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:30,270
no numbers.

4150
01:47:30,270 --> 01:47:30,950
Smart mode.

4151
01:47:30,950 --> 01:47:31,290
Right.

4152
01:47:31,290 --> 01:47:33,600
Why give it up when you
don't have to give it out?

4153
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:34,470
If you killing it.

4154
01:47:34,770 --> 01:47:35,071
So,

4155
01:47:35,071 --> 01:47:35,461
okay,

4156
01:47:35,461 --> 01:47:36,750
let's look at this man.

4157
01:47:36,990 --> 01:47:37,823
I mean,

4158
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:38,970
Shit Dude.

4159
01:47:38,971 --> 01:47:40,620
Bisbing versus GSP.

4160
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:44,850
Now I'm hearing that
that's not selling well.

4161
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:47,160
Like the square garden
from what I've heard too.

4162
01:47:47,161 --> 01:47:48,330
It's not doing great.

4163
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:49,603
Hmm.

4164
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:51,600
That's unfortunate.

4165
01:47:51,601 --> 01:47:52,890
It doesn't make it less and it just,

4166
01:47:52,930 --> 01:47:53,390
you know,

4167
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:54,101
I just went,

4168
01:47:54,101 --> 01:47:56,690
it's not doing great
GSP GSP versus Bisping.

4169
01:47:56,700 --> 01:47:57,750
He's not doing great.

4170
01:47:57,780 --> 01:47:59,120
Not like you'd think though.

4171
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:00,420
Here's the thing though,

4172
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:03,150
if you really stop and think about it,

4173
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:06,270
that was four years ago was the last
time you fought Johnny Hendricks.

4174
01:48:06,570 --> 01:48:11,570
The people that are into the UFC now
diff post Ronda Rousey and post Conor

4175
01:48:12,450 --> 01:48:12,451
Mcgregor,

4176
01:48:12,451 --> 01:48:14,730
like the casual fans hosts Lesnar the hot,

4177
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:16,260
the hardcore fans like you and I,

4178
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:17,011
we're gonna go,

4179
01:48:17,011 --> 01:48:18,240
we're gonna Watch that fight for sure.

4180
01:48:18,241 --> 01:48:18,570
Like,

4181
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:19,140
okay,

4182
01:48:19,140 --> 01:48:20,880
I'm gonna see what Bisping looks like.

4183
01:48:21,180 --> 01:48:21,870
You know,

4184
01:48:21,870 --> 01:48:24,840
fighting a guy like George St
Pierre was smaller than him.

4185
01:48:25,020 --> 01:48:26,580
God has taken four years off.

4186
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,980
Bisping's got this opportunity
to make a shitload of money.

4187
01:48:29,640 --> 01:48:31,050
And then George George,

4188
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,490
how's George going to look?

4189
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:34,290
It's a tough moment for years.

4190
01:48:34,291 --> 01:48:35,071
It's a tough sell.

4191
01:48:35,071 --> 01:48:37,460
Even for the hardcore
fans like pulling all,

4192
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:38,620
that's a great fight.

4193
01:48:39,140 --> 01:48:39,820
Fight.

4194
01:48:39,820 --> 01:48:41,790
Bisping and GSP is going
to be a great fight.

4195
01:48:41,970 --> 01:48:43,500
I'm looking forward to it for sure.

4196
01:48:43,501 --> 01:48:44,520
Keep even,

4197
01:48:44,521 --> 01:48:45,930
even now people keep,

4198
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,760
they don't give Bisping the respect.

4199
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,570
I agree.

4200
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:49,231
He keys,

4201
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:50,100
he's not going to get it.

4202
01:48:50,101 --> 01:48:51,180
Even if he beats GSP,

4203
01:48:51,181 --> 01:48:52,110
that's the problem.

4204
01:48:52,390 --> 01:48:53,400
He took four years off.

4205
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:53,740
He,

4206
01:48:53,740 --> 01:48:54,600
he's a seven year.

4207
01:48:54,660 --> 01:48:55,980
He might and it doesn't matter.

4208
01:48:55,981 --> 01:48:58,680
It doesn't sell 2 billion.

4209
01:48:58,681 --> 01:48:59,910
Fuck that dude's that.

4210
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:00,900
The casual fans,

4211
01:49:00,901 --> 01:49:01,411
fuck them.

4212
01:49:01,411 --> 01:49:02,020
Just,

4213
01:49:02,020 --> 01:49:03,390
just we got enough.

4214
01:49:03,450 --> 01:49:04,920
You can't run a business like that Eddie.

4215
01:49:04,980 --> 01:49:05,131
No,

4216
01:49:05,131 --> 01:49:05,964
you don't care.

4217
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,130
All we care about is the matchups.

4218
01:49:08,131 --> 01:49:09,120
That's a good matchup.

4219
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:09,331
No,

4220
01:49:09,331 --> 01:49:10,164
you don't know it.

4221
01:49:10,390 --> 01:49:11,320
Not work like,

4222
01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:12,780
but we don't run the business.

4223
01:49:12,781 --> 01:49:13,531
So for us,

4224
01:49:13,531 --> 01:49:14,250
Eddie's right.

4225
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:15,083
I agree with Eddie.

4226
01:49:15,180 --> 01:49:16,620
As long as they're putting
in these fights on,

4227
01:49:16,650 --> 01:49:17,580
I think it's a great fight.

4228
01:49:17,610 --> 01:49:17,830
Right.

4229
01:49:17,830 --> 01:49:19,570
So you'd have to,

4230
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:23,880
would rather watch a GSB has taken four
years off fight for the middleweight

4231
01:49:23,881 --> 01:49:26,790
title than him fight a guy
who's an actual champion,

4232
01:49:26,791 --> 01:49:28,020
85 like I don't mind,

4233
01:49:28,021 --> 01:49:28,854
I'm in no hurry.

4234
01:49:28,890 --> 01:49:29,730
That's not what I'm saying.

4235
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:30,451
First of all,

4236
01:49:30,451 --> 01:49:33,240
Whitaker's injured and you can't fight
right now with her care as a pretty

4237
01:49:33,241 --> 01:49:34,890
serious tear his knee ligament.

4238
01:49:35,130 --> 01:49:36,840
So that's one thing.

4239
01:49:37,080 --> 01:49:40,950
This is also an opportunity for Bisbing
who's been in the game forever to make a

4240
01:49:40,951 --> 01:49:41,671
shitload of money.

4241
01:49:41,671 --> 01:49:42,504
I liked that.

4242
01:49:42,840 --> 01:49:43,680
I liked Michael.

4243
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,890
I liked the fact that Michael is an
opportunity to make a fuck load of money

4244
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:47,380
here.

4245
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:48,213
I like this.

4246
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:49,520
No,

4247
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,890
don't need it to sell him old man.

4248
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:52,090
That's why you do what you wanted to make.

4249
01:49:52,570 --> 01:49:53,650
But if you wanted to make money,

4250
01:49:53,651 --> 01:49:54,150
it has said,

4251
01:49:54,150 --> 01:49:54,221
yeah,

4252
01:49:54,221 --> 01:49:55,950
but I'm not in the business
of selling paper views.

4253
01:49:55,960 --> 01:49:57,910
Well I'm in the business
so we don't want to speak.

4254
01:49:57,911 --> 01:49:59,770
You just said you wanted
him to make a lot of money.

4255
01:50:00,070 --> 01:50:00,221
Well,

4256
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:01,001
he's going to make a lot of money.

4257
01:50:01,001 --> 01:50:03,220
Either way he's going to make
more money in this fight.

4258
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:06,880
I'll guarantee there's some sort of a
guarantee like pay view points where you

4259
01:50:06,881 --> 01:50:10,720
make your money like your re your life
changing monies paid for viewpoints as

4260
01:50:10,721 --> 01:50:11,321
mighty mouse.

4261
01:50:11,321 --> 01:50:13,420
As Jon Jones asked Connor Mcgregor,

4262
01:50:13,421 --> 01:50:14,254
I'm sure,

4263
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,520
but don't you think that George Saint
Pierre is at least going to do half a

4264
01:50:18,520 --> 01:50:20,560
million pay per view buys maybe more.

4265
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,610
I like to think so.

4266
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:22,541
Heartbreaking.

4267
01:50:22,541 --> 01:50:23,250
If he doesn't.

4268
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:25,570
I like to think he's going to
do at least a half a million.

4269
01:50:25,570 --> 01:50:28,450
Make sure this thing
about 700 stuff's weird.

4270
01:50:28,451 --> 01:50:28,841
Me Out,

4271
01:50:28,841 --> 01:50:29,080
man.

4272
01:50:29,080 --> 01:50:30,250
This weird shit that he's doing,

4273
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:33,820
whether they're touching things with
moving things and touch things with his

4274
01:50:33,821 --> 01:50:34,150
feet.

4275
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:35,590
Have you seen how Jack d looks?

4276
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:36,400
Looks jacked.

4277
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,800
He looks super swollen.

4278
01:50:37,801 --> 01:50:38,720
What if he pisses hot?

4279
01:50:38,920 --> 01:50:39,220
He'd,

4280
01:50:39,220 --> 01:50:40,120
I don't think he cares.

4281
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,790
I think if he's just one and done,

4282
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:43,011
he's like,

4283
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:43,610
hey,

4284
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:45,040
I fought whenever I'm gone.

4285
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:45,640
See Ya.

4286
01:50:45,640 --> 01:50:46,780
I did not know.

4287
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:47,710
And when you,

4288
01:50:47,710 --> 01:50:49,180
when you get popped again after money,

4289
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:50,380
when money taken away,

4290
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:51,820
25% yeah.

4291
01:50:51,821 --> 01:50:53,950
They take some of your
mind only 25% though.

4292
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:54,993
Even if you won.

4293
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:55,391
Yeah.

4294
01:50:55,391 --> 01:50:58,630
Look it Lesnar my bat
hunt 25% here you go.

4295
01:50:58,990 --> 01:50:59,823
Gimme this.

4296
01:50:59,980 --> 01:51:00,790
Yeah.

4297
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:01,091
I'm,

4298
01:51:01,091 --> 01:51:03,010
I'm very curious about this fight.

4299
01:51:03,040 --> 01:51:04,000
Very curious.

4300
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:05,280
Yup.

4301
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:06,113
I'm listening.

4302
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:07,050
I'm balls deep in me.

4303
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:07,691
I think it's a,

4304
01:51:07,691 --> 01:51:08,670
it's a fun fight.

4305
01:51:08,740 --> 01:51:09,650
Not The fight that

4306
01:51:11,560 --> 01:51:13,000
take people down these days too.

4307
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:13,480
It is.

4308
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:15,730
The GSP was taken everyone
down five years ago.

4309
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:16,600
This means it's up.

4310
01:51:16,601 --> 01:51:17,520
Damn tough to take.

4311
01:51:17,590 --> 01:51:19,630
The dance gets it.

4312
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:21,220
It's going to be a little harder.

4313
01:51:21,700 --> 01:51:22,240
I don't,

4314
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,330
I'm not sure the GSP is going to be able
to take people down like you did five

4315
01:51:25,331 --> 01:51:25,661
years ago.

4316
01:51:25,661 --> 01:51:26,494
I'm not sure.

4317
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:28,040
I'll be right there.

4318
01:51:29,170 --> 01:51:30,250
This matchup.

4319
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:33,970
It's all rights by nowhere near
the best fight on the card.

4320
01:51:34,060 --> 01:51:34,811
You look at that card.

4321
01:51:34,811 --> 01:51:36,430
It's a fucking heater.

4322
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:38,320
Do you think that's a
recent picture of George?

4323
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:39,730
No,

4324
01:51:39,730 --> 01:51:40,420
not at all.

4325
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:40,840
No,

4326
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:41,673
not at all.

4327
01:51:41,770 --> 01:51:44,550
I think it is because I
think he looks like his gun.

4328
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,670
It's a little soft.

4329
01:51:46,040 --> 01:51:46,310
Oh,

4330
01:51:46,310 --> 01:51:46,871
that's fair.

4331
01:51:46,871 --> 01:51:47,201
Yeah.

4332
01:51:47,201 --> 01:51:47,741
All right.

4333
01:51:47,741 --> 01:51:48,880
A little bit like,

4334
01:51:48,881 --> 01:51:49,151
look,

4335
01:51:49,151 --> 01:51:50,380
we just saw Kevin Lee.

4336
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:52,090
He's thicker than a snickers down their,

4337
01:51:52,120 --> 01:51:52,540
yeah,

4338
01:51:52,540 --> 01:51:54,190
Jesus Christ thick.

4339
01:51:54,470 --> 01:51:56,520
That's Johnny Hendrickson.

4340
01:51:56,530 --> 01:51:59,860
That big kind of heavy,

4341
01:51:59,890 --> 01:52:00,910
like around the middle.

4342
01:52:00,970 --> 01:52:01,510
Yeah.

4343
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:02,380
Eating a lot,

4344
01:52:03,160 --> 01:52:03,941
but there's a,

4345
01:52:03,941 --> 01:52:06,490
there's a big difference
between that and Kevin Lee.

4346
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:06,880
Right.

4347
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:07,730
Kevin leave was g,

4348
01:52:07,731 --> 01:52:08,530
g G.

4349
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:08,530
G.

4350
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:08,530
G.

4351
01:52:08,530 --> 01:52:12,010
G jacked jacked Rick when he was on top
of that picture of him on top of Tony

4352
01:52:12,011 --> 01:52:13,090
when he was dropping bombs on them,

4353
01:52:13,091 --> 01:52:13,924
jacked,

4354
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:14,860
jacked.

4355
01:52:14,860 --> 01:52:16,210
George does not look that good,

4356
01:52:16,330 --> 01:52:18,130
but then again if he's clean,

4357
01:52:18,190 --> 01:52:19,390
which she kind of has to be,

4358
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:20,260
have to be,

4359
01:52:20,260 --> 01:52:21,820
I think he's 35 now.

4360
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:22,803
He's not young.

4361
01:52:22,900 --> 01:52:23,800
How old was George?

4362
01:52:25,450 --> 01:52:30,450
I mean he's 35 you can be in great shape
at 35 but really it completely helps if

4363
01:52:31,691 --> 01:52:33,370
you were super active for a long time.

4364
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:35,440
Are we looking at the tip
of his Dick in that picture?

4365
01:52:35,500 --> 01:52:36,250
What's that all about?

4366
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:37,490
He has a fat take if that,

4367
01:52:37,491 --> 01:52:40,780
so why don't you guys
Photoshop that out please.

4368
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,490
I want to look taking that picture.

4369
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:46,310
That's all I can see you Mike Perry here.

4370
01:52:46,340 --> 01:52:47,173
First of all,

4371
01:52:47,240 --> 01:52:51,230
send that fucking jacket in a time
machine back to the eighties have that

4372
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:51,680
jacket,

4373
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:54,950
but crank the volume up and this Jamie,

4374
01:52:54,951 --> 01:52:55,940
let's hear what he has to say.

4375
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,290
He's going to drop some f bombs again.

4376
01:52:57,370 --> 01:52:58,203
It good

4377
01:52:58,580 --> 01:52:59,000
is,

4378
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:01,840
and we got assigned to paperwork
and we're going to make it happen.

4379
01:53:01,841 --> 01:53:03,940
I'm pretty sure that
it's going to go down.

4380
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:05,080
I look forward to it,

4381
01:53:05,081 --> 01:53:08,710
but I got work to do first with
Santiago positive you in Winnipeg,

4382
01:53:08,711 --> 01:53:09,544
Canada.

4383
01:53:10,990 --> 01:53:12,250
He sounds like a rapper.

4384
01:53:12,480 --> 01:53:13,030
Yeah.

4385
01:53:13,030 --> 01:53:14,800
Well it's got a tattoo above his eyebrow.

4386
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:16,810
It feels like it's about
to drop some sick beat.

4387
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:18,520
Yeah.

4388
01:53:18,520 --> 01:53:21,880
You look good against
Donald Donald Cerrone,

4389
01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:23,130
Donald,

4390
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:23,963
the cowboy,

4391
01:53:24,180 --> 01:53:26,560
the cowboy that that wins fights.

4392
01:53:26,980 --> 01:53:29,620
That was Donald that that shows up at.

4393
01:53:29,910 --> 01:53:30,743
And uh,

4394
01:53:31,270 --> 01:53:31,870
I wasn't,

4395
01:53:31,870 --> 01:53:33,640
I wasn't happy with Donald's performance.

4396
01:53:35,380 --> 01:53:36,080
What is it?

4397
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:36,913
American

4398
01:53:37,810 --> 01:53:39,520
Darrin didn't get a tough finder tonight.

4399
01:53:39,970 --> 01:53:41,930
He got someone who gave
up in the first round,

4400
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:42,773
but that doesn't,

4401
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:44,490
you know,

4402
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:45,630
that that's not what was done.

4403
01:53:45,970 --> 01:53:46,291
Donald.

4404
01:53:46,291 --> 01:53:47,000
Did it look great.

4405
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,590
They should keep Mike Perry off.

4406
01:53:48,591 --> 01:53:49,850
Microphone from now on.

4407
01:53:49,990 --> 01:53:50,180
Go.

4408
01:53:50,180 --> 01:53:51,013
Hey.

4409
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:54,873
I love it.

4410
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:56,700
Enjoying limp biscuit.

4411
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:57,700
What does that mean?

4412
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:57,930
Well,

4413
01:53:57,930 --> 01:53:59,420
it sounds like a white rapper.

4414
01:54:08,520 --> 01:54:13,520
Do you feel like that one towards the
top 10 do you want an even playing field

4415
01:54:14,271 --> 01:54:14,631
with your,

4416
01:54:14,631 --> 01:54:16,170
did you still feel like
you're ahead of him?

4417
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:18,890
My parents got a great record.

4418
01:54:18,891 --> 01:54:19,880
I'm number 15.

4419
01:54:19,881 --> 01:54:21,620
I don't know where that
puts him on the rankings,

4420
01:54:21,621 --> 01:54:22,820
but rankings don't matter then

4421
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:24,530
it never mattered since I've got here.

4422
01:54:24,710 --> 01:54:25,543
That's fair.

4423
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:26,510
My right,

4424
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:27,080
my left hand,

4425
01:54:27,080 --> 01:54:27,801
he wants to box.

4426
01:54:27,801 --> 01:54:30,530
I look forward to any MMA
fighter that won a box with me.

4427
01:54:30,830 --> 01:54:33,590
Santiago punks in Libya was going
to be the first example of that.

4428
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:36,043
Right.

4429
01:54:36,580 --> 01:54:37,510
What's that guy's name?

4430
01:54:37,511 --> 01:54:38,470
The guy with the bow tie.

4431
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:38,831
I know,

4432
01:54:38,831 --> 01:54:39,820
but he seems scared.

4433
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,800
I'm scared to say anything.

4434
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:43,930
This makes me uncomfortable.

4435
01:54:47,770 --> 01:54:48,970
He's heavy handed as well.

4436
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,190
Yeah.

4437
01:54:56,190 --> 01:54:59,380
I'll get myself and my
deep in my training camp.

4438
01:54:59,890 --> 01:55:00,723
Focus on,

4439
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:01,240
on,

4440
01:55:01,240 --> 01:55:01,960
uh,

4441
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:02,471
the things,

4442
01:55:02,471 --> 01:55:06,160
the aspects of Santiago's game
and do what I gotta do to,

4443
01:55:06,460 --> 01:55:06,711
to,

4444
01:55:06,711 --> 01:55:07,544
uh,

4445
01:55:07,660 --> 01:55:10,030
focus on him and beat him.

4446
01:55:10,600 --> 01:55:11,800
And very similar.

4447
01:55:11,950 --> 01:55:12,980
I'll get there until,

4448
01:55:13,320 --> 01:55:14,420
what's that face?

4449
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:15,870
Very similar style.

4450
01:55:16,440 --> 01:55:17,131
Similar at all,

4451
01:55:17,131 --> 01:55:17,940
sir.

4452
01:55:17,940 --> 01:55:19,140
Guess they both throw punches.

4453
01:55:19,141 --> 01:55:19,974
Correct.

4454
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:21,300
I look forward to a man.

4455
01:55:21,301 --> 01:55:22,320
I can't wait to do it.

4456
01:55:22,321 --> 01:55:23,154
And I looked up,

4457
01:55:23,190 --> 01:55:26,580
skyrocket myself off this
kid undefeated record.

4458
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,770
I'm ready to take that on from that board.

4459
01:55:28,970 --> 01:55:31,490
It's weird talking about that
fight when you have a huge fight

4460
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:33,833
for

4461
01:55:36,420 --> 01:55:36,920
him.

4462
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:37,760
Rocking back and forth.

4463
01:55:38,220 --> 01:55:39,053
I like him.

4464
01:55:39,890 --> 01:55:42,980
That mother fucker hits a haul truck.

4465
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:43,883
He's like,

4466
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:45,950
he reminds me a lot of limits.

4467
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:48,270
He's just a fucking nightmare
if you get hit by him.

4468
01:55:48,570 --> 01:55:49,650
But if you can avoid it,

4469
01:55:50,170 --> 01:55:51,420
it's an easy game plan.

4470
01:55:51,450 --> 01:55:53,040
Jake Ellenberger fight man.

4471
01:55:53,850 --> 01:55:55,650
When he caught Jake
with a big fucking deal.

4472
01:55:55,651 --> 01:55:57,030
But that November 4th garde,

4473
01:55:57,060 --> 01:55:57,691
first of all,

4474
01:55:57,691 --> 01:55:59,040
Cody Garbrandt dill shawl,

4475
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:00,570
fucking ridiculous.

4476
01:56:00,571 --> 01:56:00,991
Fiery.

4477
01:56:00,991 --> 01:56:01,824
Very interesting.

4478
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,020
[inaudible] rose.

4479
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:04,230
Ridiculous,

4480
01:56:04,231 --> 01:56:05,220
ridiculous dude.

4481
01:56:05,221 --> 01:56:07,190
Wonderboy Mazda doll fun.

4482
01:56:07,740 --> 01:56:08,250
Love it.

4483
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:08,881
Love it.

4484
01:56:08,881 --> 01:56:09,714
Love it.

4485
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:12,000
Then the big rates back,

4486
01:56:12,030 --> 01:56:13,800
big rigs back near the steakhouse.

4487
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:15,150
He might make weight.

4488
01:56:15,180 --> 01:56:16,080
I can't promise you,

4489
01:56:16,081 --> 01:56:16,914
but he's back.

4490
01:56:17,480 --> 01:56:18,750
He's at Jackson's now.

4491
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:20,220
That's like,

4492
01:56:20,220 --> 01:56:22,020
that's like don't move into
Florida when you're older.

4493
01:56:28,930 --> 01:56:30,620
It's just what people
do when they get older.

4494
01:56:30,700 --> 01:56:31,130
Tired.

4495
01:56:31,130 --> 01:56:31,500
I'll be like,

4496
01:56:31,500 --> 01:56:33,230
I'll try out Jackson
Jackson's go to Albert shirt.

4497
01:56:33,240 --> 01:56:34,410
I'm going to try real camp.

4498
01:56:34,440 --> 01:56:34,621
Yeah,

4499
01:56:34,621 --> 01:56:35,610
let's try this out.

4500
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:36,451
It was an interesting,

4501
01:56:36,451 --> 01:56:38,880
listen to what Johnny Hendricks
was saying about training in Texas.

4502
01:56:38,881 --> 01:56:39,420
He was like,

4503
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:43,140
I gotta be careful when I spar with
people cause if I go do ho too hard then

4504
01:56:43,141 --> 01:56:47,310
they won't come back to you
got to find a real camp.

4505
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:47,611
Yeah,

4506
01:56:47,611 --> 01:56:48,930
per watt can.

4507
01:56:48,931 --> 01:56:49,310
He can't,

4508
01:56:49,310 --> 01:56:50,310
but everybody go too hard.

4509
01:56:50,311 --> 01:56:51,420
You're fucked up.

4510
01:56:51,421 --> 01:56:53,280
But he saying Aka and let
me know how that goes.

4511
01:56:53,281 --> 01:56:54,061
So that's what he was saying.

4512
01:56:54,061 --> 01:56:57,030
He was saying finally I can go to
Jackson's and I'm getting pushed.

4513
01:56:57,210 --> 01:56:57,541
He's like,

4514
01:56:57,541 --> 01:56:58,560
where I am in Texas,

4515
01:56:58,561 --> 01:56:58,890
I'm,

4516
01:56:58,890 --> 01:56:59,950
I'm just not getting pushed.

4517
01:56:59,980 --> 01:57:00,600
He left,

4518
01:57:00,600 --> 01:57:02,100
he left that team take down.

4519
01:57:02,101 --> 01:57:03,810
Remember they had some gnarly dudes there.

4520
01:57:03,810 --> 01:57:04,410
He left them.

4521
01:57:04,410 --> 01:57:06,060
There was a lot of shit
going on with that though.

4522
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:06,930
You know how that worked?

4523
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:07,210
Yeah.

4524
01:57:07,210 --> 01:57:09,930
He had a weird deal when they're
like 20% of all the shifts.

4525
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:11,760
Oh yeah.

4526
01:57:12,190 --> 01:57:13,800
They took like the game,

4527
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:16,200
a salary and then they
took like half as money.

4528
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:17,400
Like they,

4529
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,830
but the thing is the guy put
a lot of money in everything.

4530
01:57:19,831 --> 01:57:21,330
So I see his perspective too.

4531
01:57:21,510 --> 01:57:23,640
It's like they put together
a training facility.

4532
01:57:23,641 --> 01:57:23,950
They put,

4533
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:25,230
they hired all these coaches,

4534
01:57:25,470 --> 01:57:26,880
they had all this stuff going on.

4535
01:57:26,881 --> 01:57:27,810
They paid for everything.

4536
01:57:27,811 --> 01:57:30,330
They gave him a salary and
then when it came time,

4537
01:57:30,350 --> 01:57:32,670
you know to for that
investment to pay off,

4538
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:35,550
they wanted half the money
and I don't know how they,

4539
01:57:36,120 --> 01:57:38,370
how they worked it out.

4540
01:57:38,660 --> 01:57:39,500
Johnny Hendricks on,

4541
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:41,970
you're a national champion from
Oklahoma state and someone's like,

4542
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:42,121
hey,

4543
01:57:42,121 --> 01:57:42,770
we're going to vet.

4544
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:44,460
You wouldn't take 50% right?

4545
01:57:44,460 --> 01:57:45,540
Fuck you man.

4546
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:48,420
Well I think what happened was,

4547
01:57:48,421 --> 01:57:48,661
you know,

4548
01:57:48,661 --> 01:57:51,450
once you started getting that
world championship money,

4549
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:52,050
you know,

4550
01:57:52,050 --> 01:57:55,920
that's probably one of the 5% then
he opened the big rig steakhouse,

4551
01:57:55,980 --> 01:57:57,840
which God blesses the problem.

4552
01:57:57,900 --> 01:57:59,130
That's the bigger problem.

4553
01:57:59,131 --> 01:58:02,640
Opening a restaurant is like notoriously
one of the worst investments you could

4554
01:58:02,641 --> 01:58:03,091
ever make.

4555
01:58:03,091 --> 01:58:04,980
Restaurant Lodge celebrities go under.

4556
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:06,090
Jim's are bad,

4557
01:58:06,091 --> 01:58:06,331
right?

4558
01:58:06,331 --> 01:58:09,420
But gyms don't have the same kind of
overhead that a restaurant does and the

4559
01:58:09,421 --> 01:58:10,480
dynamics of arrest,

4560
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:12,300
they just don't go well.

4561
01:58:12,301 --> 01:58:13,800
And if you get a couple of bad reviews,

4562
01:58:13,860 --> 01:58:17,040
you don't bounce back unless
it's a Mexican restaurant.

4563
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:18,810
You don't have to have a clean restaurant.

4564
01:58:18,811 --> 01:58:19,660
If it's Mexican food,

4565
01:58:19,661 --> 01:58:20,371
not making marine,

4566
01:58:20,371 --> 01:58:21,570
you don't have to be nice.

4567
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:24,720
You know like we show up to El Torito.

4568
01:58:26,030 --> 01:58:28,410
What was that place on
Fairfax and is it not?

4569
01:58:28,411 --> 01:58:30,410
El Torito is that place and lost.

4570
01:58:30,411 --> 01:58:32,120
Bonnie knows Benito Benito.

4571
01:58:32,230 --> 01:58:36,300
Benito burritos show up and it's like
little Taco shop and there's a Mexican guy

4572
01:58:36,301 --> 01:58:36,781
in the back.

4573
01:58:36,781 --> 01:58:38,850
He's making a burrito and you said hey.

4574
01:58:38,970 --> 01:58:40,230
And he looks over and he goes,

4575
01:58:40,260 --> 01:58:40,441
hey,

4576
01:58:40,441 --> 01:58:42,190
can I get two the sodas?

4577
01:58:42,340 --> 01:58:46,390
And the guy just kind of looks at Unis
like waves at you kind of just nods at

4578
01:58:46,391 --> 01:58:47,590
you and you're like cool,

4579
01:58:47,591 --> 01:58:48,640
there's going to be a great place.

4580
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:50,380
That was a white guy that did that.

4581
01:58:50,560 --> 01:58:51,251
They'd be shut down.

4582
01:58:51,251 --> 01:58:51,851
If it's good,

4583
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:52,684
I'll put up with it.

4584
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:55,900
So with photos is 24 hours a day.

4585
01:58:55,930 --> 01:58:57,040
Oh is it on Beverly?

4586
01:58:57,580 --> 01:58:59,170
On Beverly and Fairfax Him.

4587
01:58:59,240 --> 01:58:59,770
I'm hungry.

4588
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:00,591
So going,

4589
01:59:00,591 --> 01:59:01,470
he called me cracker.

4590
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:02,310
Make my breed on.

4591
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:03,143
Ah,

4592
01:59:03,550 --> 01:59:04,420
it's so good.

4593
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:07,990
That place is off the charts
girly and it's a 24 hour joints.

4594
01:59:07,991 --> 01:59:09,910
So it's like a late night comedy store.

4595
01:59:10,120 --> 01:59:11,000
Chicken burritos.

4596
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:13,660
You'll go there at one
o'clock in the morning.

4597
01:59:13,661 --> 01:59:16,210
You might wait 20 minutes in
line cause he's a bare ass line.

4598
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:18,430
There's a Mexican
restaurant in the valley.

4599
01:59:18,550 --> 01:59:22,690
They'd close down for a week because
they got shut down for a rodent

4600
01:59:22,720 --> 01:59:23,860
infestation,

4601
01:59:24,070 --> 01:59:25,630
frozen the newspaper and everything.

4602
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:31,480
As soon as they were when we were waiting
in line backstreet boys tickets or

4603
01:59:31,481 --> 01:59:31,751
something.

4604
01:59:31,751 --> 01:59:32,584
You know what I mean?

4605
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,370
Can we ate there like yesterday?

4606
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,200
We don't give a shit.

4607
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:37,320
Yeah,

4608
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:39,250
they closed down the kitchen
cause they had too much.

4609
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,360
Too many rodents.

4610
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:40,750
Amen.

4611
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:41,830
If it's good food too,

4612
01:59:41,831 --> 01:59:42,611
I'll put up with it,

4613
01:59:42,611 --> 01:59:42,821
man.

4614
01:59:42,821 --> 01:59:43,840
I'll put up with a lot of stuff.

4615
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:44,711
Chinese food,

4616
01:59:44,711 --> 01:59:45,490
same thing.

4617
01:59:45,490 --> 01:59:46,450
They don't have to be nice.

4618
01:59:46,700 --> 01:59:48,700
You know when you go to
Chinese food and there's like,

4619
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:51,540
there's a big group you guys
are like mean and shit then,

4620
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:57,760
but if it's white all you can't do it.

4621
01:59:57,780 --> 01:59:59,320
Why you gotta be high?

4622
01:59:59,470 --> 02:00:02,490
Of course you have to be
really nice if you're white,

4623
02:00:02,491 --> 02:00:02,741
you know what?

4624
02:00:02,741 --> 02:00:03,680
I need to get back to it.

4625
02:00:03,681 --> 02:00:07,660
There's a fucking Thai place that
rob came and took me to in Thai town.

4626
02:00:07,661 --> 02:00:08,860
You know where Thai town is?

4627
02:00:08,860 --> 02:00:12,580
I guess it's on Hollywood or
sunset sunset or Hollywood.

4628
02:00:12,730 --> 02:00:13,510
Hollywood,

4629
02:00:13,510 --> 02:00:14,171
Hollywood.

4630
02:00:14,171 --> 02:00:15,490
When you go east,

4631
02:00:15,910 --> 02:00:17,050
if you go east on Hollywood,

4632
02:00:17,051 --> 02:00:20,530
there's a whole section of lets you know
where Trump is right across the street

4633
02:00:20,531 --> 02:00:21,850
from jumbos clown room.

4634
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:24,610
You know that's strip club jumbos that's,

4635
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:25,810
everybody was making fun of it.

4636
02:00:25,930 --> 02:00:27,150
I don't know anything
about cerebral palsy.

4637
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:28,030
I hear you.

4638
02:00:28,030 --> 02:00:28,630
Me Neither.

4639
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:29,470
But that's what I hear.

4640
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:34,880
But it's right across the street and
it's like legit late sonic Thai food.

4641
02:00:35,661 --> 02:00:36,500
So good.

4642
02:00:36,830 --> 02:00:38,050
So good.

4643
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:39,280
Legit.

4644
02:00:39,280 --> 02:00:40,450
I know you've eaten there Eddie.

4645
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:42,300
I know we've eaten there to
get the Hollywood boulevard.

4646
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:42,701
Oh,

4647
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:43,534
you a toy?

4648
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:44,531
No,

4649
02:00:44,531 --> 02:00:45,360
not that place.

4650
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,240
That's on sunset.

4651
02:00:46,520 --> 02:00:47,161
You're talking about,

4652
02:00:47,161 --> 02:00:48,280
you're talking about the good spot too.

4653
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:49,553
Which what street?

4654
02:00:49,800 --> 02:00:50,381
Further down.

4655
02:00:50,381 --> 02:00:51,330
I'd been Hollywood and it's,

4656
02:00:51,340 --> 02:00:53,140
it's on Hollywood patio.

4657
02:00:53,800 --> 02:00:55,730
Maybe it's on the [inaudible] side.

4658
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:58,330
Hollywood boulevard on the north side.

4659
02:00:58,540 --> 02:00:59,051
You know what it is,

4660
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:01,000
you know when you go down
Hollywood and it goes,

4661
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:04,090
you almost have like that arch that you
pass through that takes you into like

4662
02:01:04,091 --> 02:01:06,640
Thai town arch.

4663
02:01:06,970 --> 02:01:07,840
Isn't there an arch?

4664
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:12,610
My imagination are Thai town sounds off.

4665
02:01:13,330 --> 02:01:14,290
That's the lunch.

4666
02:01:14,320 --> 02:01:15,250
The one with the yellow.

4667
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:16,173
Look at this.

4668
02:01:16,570 --> 02:01:17,403
Fuck.

4669
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:19,450
This chick wants to be black,

4670
02:01:20,010 --> 02:01:21,670
white chick from Maury.

4671
02:01:21,671 --> 02:01:22,300
Povich steady.

4672
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:23,230
Eddie was talking about her.

4673
02:01:24,380 --> 02:01:25,120
Fuck her.

4674
02:01:25,120 --> 02:01:25,840
Want to be black?

4675
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:25,951
Well,

4676
02:01:25,951 --> 02:01:27,380
look at them today.

4677
02:01:27,790 --> 02:01:29,320
Is that video of this?

4678
02:01:29,321 --> 02:01:30,400
Can you play a video called

4679
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:34,333
nonsequitor?

4680
02:01:34,510 --> 02:01:34,901
By the way,

4681
02:01:34,901 --> 02:01:35,830
Jamie just pulled it up.

4682
02:01:35,831 --> 02:01:36,770
Both Jamie said,

4683
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:39,770
give me some volume.

4684
02:01:40,250 --> 02:01:41,330
Does she talk black?

4685
02:01:41,410 --> 02:01:41,760
Yeah,

4686
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:42,860
the Maury Povich show.

4687
02:01:42,861 --> 02:01:45,200
Can you change your race to take a look?

4688
02:01:45,350 --> 02:01:46,160
He's still killing it.

4689
02:01:46,160 --> 02:01:46,781
My next guest,

4690
02:01:46,781 --> 02:01:47,301
Martina,

4691
02:01:47,301 --> 02:01:49,520
when she was a quietly making millions,

4692
02:01:49,700 --> 02:01:51,500
this is Martina,

4693
02:01:51,501 --> 02:01:54,260
desperately wanted it to
look like Pamela Anderson.

4694
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:54,980
Oh,

4695
02:01:54,980 --> 02:01:55,500
okay.

4696
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:56,120
So Apple,

4697
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:58,310
here's in several cosmetic surgeries.

4698
02:01:58,610 --> 02:02:01,460
Martina transformed her lumps and do this.

4699
02:02:02,380 --> 02:02:03,213
Oh,

4700
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:06,950
the crowd in jars

4701
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:07,550
go.

4702
02:02:07,550 --> 02:02:09,800
Martina made worldwide headlines,

4703
02:02:10,700 --> 02:02:12,230
shocking transformation,

4704
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:15,860
chemical injections and body modification.

4705
02:02:16,250 --> 02:02:19,910
Martina now considers
herself a black woman.

4706
02:02:29,230 --> 02:02:30,940
I want it to look like a Barbie.

4707
02:02:31,220 --> 02:02:31,370
Oh,

4708
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,380
she's not American aids

4709
02:02:32,530 --> 02:02:33,790
and what beautiful body.

4710
02:02:33,900 --> 02:02:34,650
Look at that like.

4711
02:02:34,650 --> 02:02:35,530
The Barbie was long,

4712
02:02:35,531 --> 02:02:36,980
blonde hair and long necks,

4713
02:02:37,240 --> 02:02:38,560
but we got breasts.

4714
02:02:39,790 --> 02:02:42,470
Martina began to dream about
having plastic surgery.

4715
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:43,570
Do look like her idol.

4716
02:02:43,630 --> 02:02:44,590
Pamela Anderson.

4717
02:02:44,830 --> 02:02:45,640
Oh my God,

4718
02:02:45,640 --> 02:02:46,473
that's crazy.

4719
02:02:48,070 --> 02:02:49,630
Nothing like that.

4720
02:02:49,830 --> 02:02:50,950
We'll look at those.

4721
02:02:50,951 --> 02:02:53,290
Fucking basketball began.

4722
02:02:53,620 --> 02:02:54,453
That's what it is.

4723
02:02:54,460 --> 02:02:54,581
Well,

4724
02:02:54,581 --> 02:02:55,630
the teeth makes sense.

4725
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:56,500
Wow.

4726
02:02:57,910 --> 02:02:58,743
Whoa.

4727
02:02:59,440 --> 02:03:00,730
I got married,

4728
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:02,890
so the biggest titties I've ever seen,

4729
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:04,090
they're so stupid.

4730
02:03:04,091 --> 02:03:05,320
Look and chest to sit down.

4731
02:03:05,710 --> 02:03:07,230
I also had delightful sec.

4732
02:03:07,650 --> 02:03:08,710
It gets long.

4733
02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:13,880
Bobby [inaudible] thousands
of dollars on plastics or two.

4734
02:03:14,620 --> 02:03:17,190
Martina was ready for her
most shocking transformation.

4735
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:21,700
I got three injections in the
valley to change my skin color.

4736
02:03:21,820 --> 02:03:22,091
What?

4737
02:03:22,091 --> 02:03:25,630
Snow and the broker owner of a skin

4738
02:03:26,110 --> 02:03:26,680
today.

4739
02:03:26,680 --> 02:03:27,550
Martina says

4740
02:03:29,620 --> 02:03:31,080
she is black.

4741
02:03:32,200 --> 02:03:33,033
Black,

4742
02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:34,250
black.

4743
02:03:34,250 --> 02:03:35,010
Look at her hair.

4744
02:03:35,010 --> 02:03:38,230
Do you think that's fake
Tan to just went over it?

4745
02:03:38,231 --> 02:03:38,740
Didn't did it

4746
02:03:38,740 --> 02:03:39,250
a lot of fake.

4747
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:40,660
I've never seen him fake Tan.

4748
02:03:41,260 --> 02:03:42,093
Look at her.

4749
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:44,110
Look at those stupid tits.

4750
02:03:44,260 --> 02:03:47,170
Those tits are distro preposterous.

4751
02:03:47,710 --> 02:03:47,981
God,

4752
02:03:47,981 --> 02:03:48,814
we are sick

4753
02:03:51,800 --> 02:03:52,470
people.

4754
02:03:52,470 --> 02:03:53,400
Some white face.

4755
02:03:53,680 --> 02:03:54,610
Does she use the n word?

4756
02:03:55,250 --> 02:03:57,340
I've heard of people doing
fake things on Maury before.

4757
02:03:57,990 --> 02:03:58,481
Tricking them.

4758
02:03:58,481 --> 02:03:59,680
Just making up a story,

4759
02:03:59,681 --> 02:04:00,514
so hold on.

4760
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:02,130
But those chicks can't be fake.

4761
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:02,980
What is she saying?

4762
02:04:02,980 --> 02:04:03,310
Hold on.

4763
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:04,143
Maybe they can be okay.

4764
02:04:04,210 --> 02:04:04,770
Myself.

4765
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:06,270
What I also liked to do.

4766
02:04:06,271 --> 02:04:07,920
Photos work on the photos.

4767
02:04:07,921 --> 02:04:10,910
I didn't see if you have the
cuffs of Pamela Anderson.

4768
02:04:11,080 --> 02:04:11,913
Yeah,

4769
02:04:12,330 --> 02:04:13,960
photos would be much more.

4770
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:14,560
That's awesome.

4771
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:18,430
So you want her to look like Pamela
Anderson because you like her curves.

4772
02:04:18,440 --> 02:04:19,273
Yeah.

4773
02:04:19,510 --> 02:04:24,510
And so then you became what you thought
was Pamela Anderson and little bit more,

4774
02:04:24,580 --> 02:04:25,480
but now

4775
02:04:28,460 --> 02:04:30,250
it goes over our shoulders and arms.

4776
02:04:30,400 --> 02:04:31,690
That's how they do it in movies.

4777
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:32,793
Yeah.

4778
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:33,740
Think could be.

4779
02:04:34,030 --> 02:04:34,301
Sure.

4780
02:04:34,301 --> 02:04:35,020
It doesn't look like it.

4781
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:36,120
Was it Sandra neck,

4782
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,620
black girls,

4783
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:38,821
rock black.

4784
02:04:38,821 --> 02:04:39,654
God's wrong.

4785
02:04:39,830 --> 02:04:40,461
Black slacks,

4786
02:04:40,461 --> 02:04:40,831
girls,

4787
02:04:40,831 --> 02:04:41,760
rock girl.

4788
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:42,623
Oh girl.

4789
02:04:42,790 --> 02:04:43,630
Plots of land when he's,

4790
02:04:43,650 --> 02:04:43,940
I'm like,

4791
02:04:43,940 --> 02:04:44,340
yes.

4792
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:44,670
Yes.

4793
02:04:44,670 --> 02:04:46,460
I get my first look at that.

4794
02:04:46,510 --> 02:04:51,510
So dark that somehow I got
the liposuction as a form.

4795
02:04:52,230 --> 02:04:53,400
I want to see her boyfriend.

4796
02:04:53,730 --> 02:04:54,563
Right.

4797
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:55,793
Fucks

4798
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:00,240
retirees.

4799
02:05:00,430 --> 02:05:01,960
Browse forward to the boyfriend.

4800
02:05:02,450 --> 02:05:03,940
Maybe there's a boyfriend in there.

4801
02:05:03,970 --> 02:05:04,141
No,

4802
02:05:04,141 --> 02:05:04,901
there is no boyfriend.

4803
02:05:04,901 --> 02:05:05,631
Are you sure?

4804
02:05:05,631 --> 02:05:06,464
Look Darker.

4805
02:05:06,760 --> 02:05:07,780
There's no what?

4806
02:05:07,870 --> 02:05:08,703
She says,

4807
02:05:08,830 --> 02:05:09,760
there's no boyfriend.

4808
02:05:09,790 --> 02:05:14,050
Three injections in the belly and after
the first boyfriend shown his face shot.

4809
02:05:15,070 --> 02:05:16,320
But today's security,

4810
02:05:16,700 --> 02:05:17,533
Martina,

4811
02:05:18,850 --> 02:05:19,690
what the fuck you're,

4812
02:05:20,110 --> 02:05:20,943
Yup.

4813
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:24,221
Oh No,

4814
02:05:24,221 --> 02:05:24,551
no,

4815
02:05:24,551 --> 02:05:25,384
no.

4816
02:05:25,390 --> 02:05:26,260
Oh No.

4817
02:05:27,350 --> 02:05:28,830
I know you have to learn a lot.

4818
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:29,670
Yeah,

4819
02:05:29,670 --> 02:05:30,503
I see

4820
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:32,853
your skin is black,

4821
02:05:33,380 --> 02:05:34,720
but you're not a black person.

4822
02:05:34,930 --> 02:05:35,830
But here's the thing.

4823
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:38,230
All people came from Africa originally,

4824
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:40,660
like the only reason why people have
white skin at all because he moved to

4825
02:05:40,661 --> 02:05:41,441
colder climates.

4826
02:05:41,441 --> 02:05:43,480
It was more cloudy and
we didn't have vitamin D.

4827
02:05:43,660 --> 02:05:43,981
So you're,

4828
02:05:43,981 --> 02:05:47,110
you basically like a
solar panel for vitamin D.

4829
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:48,460
That's what white people are.

4830
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:51,880
That's why people in England
are so fucking Pale because
it's always raining and

4831
02:05:51,881 --> 02:05:53,140
that's exactly what it is.

4832
02:05:53,141 --> 02:05:54,940
Like everyone came from Africa.

4833
02:05:54,941 --> 02:05:56,830
All human beings came from Africa.

4834
02:05:57,670 --> 02:06:01,600
So she's not really black because
that's not really her natural skin color

4835
02:06:02,110 --> 02:06:02,471
sheet.

4836
02:06:02,471 --> 02:06:02,921
But dude,

4837
02:06:02,921 --> 02:06:05,260
that is the greatest thing
you've ever said for mankind.

4838
02:06:05,740 --> 02:06:07,360
She's not applying to a lot of reasons.

4839
02:06:07,750 --> 02:06:10,030
It's a Turd giant
problem that people have.

4840
02:06:10,090 --> 02:06:11,380
This idea of race,

4841
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:13,750
like the only reason why
people look different,

4842
02:06:13,751 --> 02:06:15,580
it's because we moved
to different climates.

4843
02:06:15,850 --> 02:06:18,220
Like everyone comes out of the same thing.

4844
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:20,500
Sort of like all dogs come from wolves.

4845
02:06:20,501 --> 02:06:22,090
All humans come from Africa,

4846
02:06:22,120 --> 02:06:22,953
all of them.

4847
02:06:23,350 --> 02:06:24,790
Everybody originated there.

4848
02:06:24,791 --> 02:06:25,630
That's the motherland.

4849
02:06:26,050 --> 02:06:30,010
So like the only reason why they look
different than you is because of natural

4850
02:06:30,011 --> 02:06:30,850
selection.

4851
02:06:30,880 --> 02:06:33,490
Because the people that
live there that you know,

4852
02:06:33,491 --> 02:06:34,390
you're obviously,

4853
02:06:34,391 --> 02:06:37,030
you need that melon in your skin
to protect you from the sun.

4854
02:06:37,060 --> 02:06:38,140
That's how people evolved.

4855
02:06:38,141 --> 02:06:41,290
And then as soon as people started going
to all these colder climates and all

4856
02:06:41,291 --> 02:06:43,360
these climates that have
a lot of cloud cover,

4857
02:06:43,720 --> 02:06:47,320
the people's body started changing and
their body started changing to try to

4858
02:06:47,321 --> 02:06:48,520
absorb more vitamin D.

4859
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:50,680
That's exactly why people have white skin.

4860
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:52,810
Can they,

4861
02:06:52,810 --> 02:06:55,720
can they take hyenas and breed
them to be like miniatures?

4862
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:56,321
They could.

4863
02:06:56,321 --> 02:06:56,620
Yeah,

4864
02:06:56,620 --> 02:06:57,210
for sure.

4865
02:06:57,210 --> 02:06:58,160
I saw a guy with a pet,

4866
02:06:58,161 --> 02:06:58,540
honey,

4867
02:06:58,540 --> 02:06:58,810
you know,

4868
02:06:58,810 --> 02:07:00,280
they did it with foxes.

4869
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:04,600
They've done it with foxes and take it
foxes in really quickly within 10 years.

4870
02:07:04,780 --> 02:07:08,710
Turn them into a completely different
thing with a weak jaw and like floppy

4871
02:07:08,711 --> 02:07:09,544
ears.

4872
02:07:09,550 --> 02:07:10,383
Like to be pets.

4873
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:10,840
Yeah,

4874
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:11,673
well they did.

4875
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,680
What they did was they took foxes and
when they had a Fox that exhibited any

4876
02:07:17,350 --> 02:07:18,220
aggression at all,

4877
02:07:18,221 --> 02:07:23,221
the killed it and so then they would
breed them again and then any fox that it

4878
02:07:23,380 --> 02:07:24,580
showed any aggression at all,

4879
02:07:24,581 --> 02:07:28,300
killed it and then they kept doing this
and they were doing this to generation

4880
02:07:28,301 --> 02:07:33,280
after generation to try to see how many
generations it would take to turn a Fox

4881
02:07:33,550 --> 02:07:36,400
into like a really
docile sort of house pet,

4882
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:38,170
sort of a stupid study.

4883
02:07:38,200 --> 02:07:42,100
It's not stupid because it's fascinating
to find out how long it takes because

4884
02:07:42,101 --> 02:07:44,860
we thought it would take like hundreds
of years for an animal to change.

4885
02:07:45,130 --> 02:07:47,010
It's essentially it's appearance like its,

4886
02:07:47,011 --> 02:07:50,260
its physical appearance is very
different than a regular fox changed.

4887
02:07:50,261 --> 02:07:52,450
Their coloration changed how their ears,

4888
02:07:52,451 --> 02:07:53,620
their ears don't stick up anymore.

4889
02:07:53,621 --> 02:07:55,660
They flopped down and show submissiveness.

4890
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:56,800
Same with dogs,

4891
02:07:56,801 --> 02:07:57,310
right?

4892
02:07:57,310 --> 02:07:59,020
Like all dogs come from wolves.

4893
02:07:59,580 --> 02:08:00,760
In the original wolves,

4894
02:08:01,580 --> 02:08:03,070
the people kept as pets.

4895
02:08:03,071 --> 02:08:04,270
They would just get closer.

4896
02:08:04,271 --> 02:08:07,150
They're the ones you get closer to the
people by the campfire that people would

4897
02:08:07,151 --> 02:08:09,790
feed those wolves and then
they would use those wolves.

4898
02:08:09,791 --> 02:08:12,060
Still alert them to other
animals are coming nearby.

4899
02:08:12,130 --> 02:08:15,370
The wolves stayed close to the campfire
because the wolves knew that people were

4900
02:08:15,371 --> 02:08:16,204
going to give him food.

4901
02:08:16,300 --> 02:08:18,180
Then the wolf started protecting
those people cause they,

4902
02:08:18,181 --> 02:08:21,130
that's where their food source
was and the people worked out.

4903
02:08:21,131 --> 02:08:22,520
This relationship with wolves.

4904
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:23,380
What country?

4905
02:08:23,380 --> 02:08:25,490
This is the human race
before there was country,

4906
02:08:26,020 --> 02:08:27,010
this is probably,

4907
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:27,251
you know,

4908
02:08:27,251 --> 02:08:29,020
we're talking more than 10,000 years ago.

4909
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:31,421
Very recently,

4910
02:08:31,421 --> 02:08:32,560
I think it was in Russia.

4911
02:08:32,590 --> 02:08:34,160
I think that's where they
did this folks doing that.

4912
02:08:34,240 --> 02:08:39,240
American Fox was in the 1950s
and so they is ruthless study,

4913
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:43,360
but they found out pretty
quickly that you can,

4914
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:44,620
you can select,

4915
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:48,670
you can change the way these things
look based on which ones you breed with

4916
02:08:48,671 --> 02:08:49,504
which ones,

4917
02:08:49,570 --> 02:08:52,900
and you've got to think
when people migrated out of
Africa and they moved across

4918
02:08:52,901 --> 02:08:55,660
Asia and move through the Bering
strait and into North America,

4919
02:08:55,690 --> 02:08:55,941
they may,

4920
02:08:55,941 --> 02:08:57,490
they're dealing with brutal cold.

4921
02:08:57,700 --> 02:09:00,640
A lot of times they're completely
covered up because it's so fucking cold.

4922
02:09:00,930 --> 02:09:04,060
Or is that the boxes are more
naturally stubborn than dogs.

4923
02:09:04,120 --> 02:09:04,900
Oh Cutie face.

4924
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:05,830
They're very playful.

4925
02:09:05,831 --> 02:09:06,431
There's a little guys,

4926
02:09:06,431 --> 02:09:08,110
even in the wire lock to the pet,

4927
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:11,230
you ever see a grizzly man with
the dude made friends with Fox,

4928
02:09:11,320 --> 02:09:14,110
like a wild Fox in grizzly man,

4929
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:16,210
like stole his hat and
was playing with him.

4930
02:09:16,210 --> 02:09:17,440
He's tourism as the that died,

4931
02:09:17,441 --> 02:09:17,621
right?

4932
02:09:17,621 --> 02:09:17,920
Yeah.

4933
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:18,230
Yeah.

4934
02:09:18,230 --> 02:09:18,810
Got fucked up.

4935
02:09:18,810 --> 02:09:20,300
I'm fails flying foxes.

4936
02:09:20,350 --> 02:09:22,870
What the fuck is up with
that flinch girls mean of

4937
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:25,840
flying foxes?

4938
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:28,360
No fines.

4939
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:33,900
There's these weird gigantic Fox looking
vulture bat things in Australia that

4940
02:09:34,001 --> 02:09:36,100
just a city that just like in the city,

4941
02:09:36,101 --> 02:09:36,940
you could just see them in there.

4942
02:09:37,150 --> 02:09:39,490
They're senior system kind of bat a bat.

4943
02:09:39,550 --> 02:09:39,911
Oh yeah,

4944
02:09:39,911 --> 02:09:41,170
they have like a Fox face.

4945
02:09:41,171 --> 02:09:41,491
Yeah.

4946
02:09:41,491 --> 02:09:42,324
They look like Fox.

4947
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:45,310
Either scary as fuck and they're just
like right there and this things are

4948
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:46,180
swimming Australia.

4949
02:09:46,181 --> 02:09:48,820
So radical Adam Green tree
was sending me videos.

4950
02:09:48,821 --> 02:09:49,441
He took these salt,

4951
02:09:49,441 --> 02:09:50,320
saltwater crocodiles.

4952
02:09:50,390 --> 02:09:50,810
Whoa.

4953
02:09:50,810 --> 02:09:51,670
A regular bat.

4954
02:09:51,810 --> 02:09:53,380
Australian flying foxes.

4955
02:09:53,381 --> 02:09:54,570
It just sometime Fox.

4956
02:09:54,590 --> 02:09:55,423
Yes,

4957
02:09:55,930 --> 02:09:57,040
flying flats area.

4958
02:09:57,050 --> 02:09:57,370
Right.

4959
02:09:57,370 --> 02:09:58,420
Is it crazy as that?

4960
02:09:58,421 --> 02:10:01,680
Is it actually a flying fox or is that
what they call a bat that they call it

4961
02:10:01,681 --> 02:10:04,600
that everything looks
like it looks like a Fox.

4962
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:08,650
The Fox with winning Shin in
soldier and just in Sydney.

4963
02:10:08,651 --> 02:10:10,330
Just hanging on the tree thing is sick.

4964
02:10:10,331 --> 02:10:11,164
That is insane.

4965
02:10:11,200 --> 02:10:11,321
Well,

4966
02:10:11,321 --> 02:10:12,031
you know how like we,

4967
02:10:12,031 --> 02:10:12,701
we always look good.

4968
02:10:12,701 --> 02:10:13,930
Another pterodactyls.

4969
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:17,170
You know how we look at care doctors and
we always assume that they have wings

4970
02:10:17,171 --> 02:10:18,004
like a bat.

4971
02:10:18,010 --> 02:10:19,030
That's what everybody was thought.

4972
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:22,600
But now they're finding out that so
many dinosaurs had feathers that it's

4973
02:10:22,601 --> 02:10:25,030
entirely possible that
Tara doctors were birds.

4974
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:27,760
Did they think the t rex were
covered in feathers to write?

4975
02:10:27,761 --> 02:10:28,594
Very possible.

4976
02:10:28,690 --> 02:10:29,980
There's not a lot of evidence.

4977
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:32,770
There's some evidence that some,

4978
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:35,750
well there's definitely evidence
that some dinosaurs had feathers.

4979
02:10:35,780 --> 02:10:38,230
They found fossilized
dinosaurs with feathers and,

4980
02:10:38,231 --> 02:10:40,940
but this is all recently like
over the last few decades,

4981
02:10:41,240 --> 02:10:43,200
they're starting to find more
and more of them like it.

4982
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:43,410
There's,

4983
02:10:43,410 --> 02:10:48,230
there's a museum that I went to in
Montana and they mocked out a velociraptor

4984
02:10:48,260 --> 02:10:50,800
with feathers because look birds like,

4985
02:10:51,050 --> 02:10:52,580
like you look at it like an owl.

4986
02:10:52,640 --> 02:10:53,790
That's a fucking dinosaur.

4987
02:10:53,791 --> 02:10:54,050
Me.

4988
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:56,240
The closest thing to the
closest thing to a dinosaur.

4989
02:10:56,270 --> 02:10:56,931
They're ruthless,

4990
02:10:56,931 --> 02:10:57,071
dude.

4991
02:10:57,071 --> 02:10:59,890
Did I tell you about the fucking the
wars that I'm having in my backyard?

4992
02:10:59,930 --> 02:11:01,220
That's what dude,

4993
02:11:01,340 --> 02:11:02,420
there's Fox war.

4994
02:11:02,490 --> 02:11:03,261
Not Fox wars.

4995
02:11:03,261 --> 02:11:05,330
There's a hawk wars going on in my yard.

4996
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:06,470
They're killing each other.

4997
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:10,190
Birds are killing other
birds and they behead them.

4998
02:11:10,400 --> 02:11:13,750
So I started going online and reading
about it and they eat their head and I'm,

4999
02:11:13,751 --> 02:11:14,121
I'm like,

5000
02:11:14,121 --> 02:11:15,890
what the fuck eats a hawk's head?

5001
02:11:16,100 --> 02:11:16,251
Well,

5002
02:11:16,251 --> 02:11:19,640
apparently when birds of
prey will kill other birds,

5003
02:11:19,790 --> 02:11:21,560
one of the things they
do is eat their head.

5004
02:11:21,830 --> 02:11:22,730
They eat the headache,

5005
02:11:22,731 --> 02:11:24,250
they pull the head of show like dominant.

5006
02:11:24,251 --> 02:11:25,100
I don't know man.

5007
02:11:25,101 --> 02:11:25,761
I don't know what's going on,

5008
02:11:25,761 --> 02:11:26,900
but Jesus Christ.

5009
02:11:26,930 --> 02:11:29,730
But one of my neighbors saw um,

5010
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:33,230
a hawk eating a hawk baby like
right up the street from me.

5011
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:36,950
And I watched these hawks like swooped
down and one of them slammed in my

5012
02:11:36,951 --> 02:11:37,784
chicken coop.

5013
02:11:37,970 --> 02:11:40,190
Like there's like these juvenile hawks.

5014
02:11:40,370 --> 02:11:44,240
And I think one of the things that's
going on is I have a fence in my backyard

5015
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:45,170
and it's a,

5016
02:11:45,170 --> 02:11:48,200
we just put up a glass fence
and these birds just fucking,

5017
02:11:48,590 --> 02:11:50,530
we've murked like 15 birds.

5018
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:51,050
Dude.

5019
02:11:51,050 --> 02:11:52,110
Did you pick a class fence?

5020
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:53,003
It looks beautiful.

5021
02:11:53,010 --> 02:11:54,830
You could see the whole
view with these birds.

5022
02:11:54,860 --> 02:11:59,600
They don't understand that it's a fence
and they swooped down clang and they get

5023
02:11:59,601 --> 02:12:00,440
k that fuck,

5024
02:12:00,500 --> 02:12:01,333
oh,

5025
02:12:01,670 --> 02:12:05,070
just had traveling when
she had a video camera.

5026
02:12:05,460 --> 02:12:06,320
A little security,

5027
02:12:06,500 --> 02:12:08,960
a lot of wasted footage because
it only happens like once a month.

5028
02:12:10,110 --> 02:12:13,390
It's happened quite a few times
where birds have flown down.

5029
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:16,820
We found them just like drunk
wandering around the backyard.

5030
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:20,600
Ct just hammered the fuck up.

5031
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:24,200
Blood coming out of their nose like a fag
and him with blood coming out of their

5032
02:12:24,201 --> 02:12:24,620
nose.

5033
02:12:24,620 --> 02:12:25,453
Yeah.

5034
02:12:25,790 --> 02:12:26,300
Yeah.

5035
02:12:26,300 --> 02:12:27,133
They get kol.

5036
02:12:27,860 --> 02:12:31,460
So I think we've killed a
bunch of hawks this way.

5037
02:12:31,461 --> 02:12:32,294
Hawks have died.

5038
02:12:32,870 --> 02:12:33,531
We haven't killed him.

5039
02:12:33,531 --> 02:12:34,191
They killed themselves.

5040
02:12:34,191 --> 02:12:34,820
Yeah.

5041
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:35,653
Evolution Bitch.

5042
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:37,580
But these other hawks,

5043
02:12:37,610 --> 02:12:41,490
these juvenile hawks are now like
kind of taken over because of that.

5044
02:12:41,491 --> 02:12:43,190
And I think one of the
ones that got killed,

5045
02:12:43,520 --> 02:12:44,570
one of the hawks that got killed,

5046
02:12:44,571 --> 02:12:45,404
look at that fucker.

5047
02:12:45,930 --> 02:12:46,221
Look at him.

5048
02:12:46,221 --> 02:12:47,000
And he's eaten.

5049
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,040
Eaten a bird to decapitated a hawk.

5050
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:49,371
Yeah,

5051
02:12:49,371 --> 02:12:49,791
there it is.

5052
02:12:49,791 --> 02:12:51,020
He's decapitating a hawk.

5053
02:12:51,320 --> 02:12:52,280
Jesus Christ.

5054
02:12:52,490 --> 02:12:54,170
They are fucking monster.

5055
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:55,033
Do this.

5056
02:12:55,550 --> 02:12:58,780
Ruthless owls are so God damn ruthless.

5057
02:12:58,790 --> 02:12:59,361
So cool.

5058
02:12:59,361 --> 02:12:59,810
Don't they?

5059
02:12:59,810 --> 02:13:00,591
They do look cool.

5060
02:13:00,591 --> 02:13:05,591
But it's weird that we've made these
things out to be these wise cute creatures

5061
02:13:05,661 --> 02:13:06,920
that like give a hoot.

5062
02:13:06,921 --> 02:13:08,660
Don't pollute the tootsie roll.

5063
02:13:08,661 --> 02:13:09,050
Pop.

5064
02:13:09,050 --> 02:13:09,680
Yeah.

5065
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:10,560
The tootsie roll pops.

5066
02:13:10,770 --> 02:13:12,050
There's owls everywhere.

5067
02:13:12,770 --> 02:13:14,540
The ruthless man there too.

5068
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:16,640
I'd ever seen straight up predators.

5069
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:17,031
Really?

5070
02:13:17,031 --> 02:13:17,410
What do you mean?

5071
02:13:17,410 --> 02:13:18,560
Every time I see him all the time,

5072
02:13:19,300 --> 02:13:20,970
oh look at this bird.

5073
02:13:21,270 --> 02:13:23,320
He trying to get away like not today.

5074
02:13:23,330 --> 02:13:26,990
Pitch birth the fucking day to Dow.

5075
02:13:26,991 --> 02:13:29,330
Ho do you an eat your head.

5076
02:13:30,080 --> 02:13:30,800
But um,

5077
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:31,970
so I've found a

5078
02:13:31,980 --> 02:13:36,330
decapitated bird in my yard and I posted
a picture of it on Instagram and then

5079
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:37,650
started reading up on it.

5080
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,990
Apparently it's when
birds kill other birds,

5081
02:13:40,320 --> 02:13:40,891
they'll do that.

5082
02:13:40,891 --> 02:13:44,100
They literally bite their fucking
head off like a territory war thing.

5083
02:13:44,101 --> 02:13:45,000
Like a gang thing.

5084
02:13:45,330 --> 02:13:46,980
I think when these Bert,

5085
02:13:47,010 --> 02:13:47,701
my theory,

5086
02:13:47,701 --> 02:13:51,180
it's a shitty theory cause I'm not really
qualified to have a theory on this,

5087
02:13:51,181 --> 02:13:55,650
but I think that these birds slamming
into that fence and a few of them dying

5088
02:13:55,830 --> 02:13:57,590
have kinda upset the,

5089
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:00,060
the gang situation in my neighborhood,

5090
02:14:03,920 --> 02:14:04,753
bird Fuller's,

5091
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:06,413
dude,

5092
02:14:06,570 --> 02:14:09,870
owls are so ruthless and they
ain't shit compared to eagles.

5093
02:14:10,200 --> 02:14:11,430
Eagles of the most ruthless.

5094
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:16,530
Have you ever seen those Harpy Eagles
that are they huge shy and they're just

5095
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:21,210
how big huge kills monkeys.

5096
02:14:21,211 --> 02:14:23,100
They go after monkeys
and they eat a lot of,

5097
02:14:23,101 --> 02:14:23,670
um,

5098
02:14:23,670 --> 02:14:24,780
what are those little slow things?

5099
02:14:24,780 --> 02:14:25,613
Sloths.

5100
02:14:25,770 --> 02:14:26,760
Who's talking?

5101
02:14:26,761 --> 02:14:27,321
Sloths.

5102
02:14:27,321 --> 02:14:27,690
Man.

5103
02:14:27,690 --> 02:14:28,570
Harpy Eagles.

5104
02:14:28,571 --> 02:14:32,130
That's fucked up because
Google Harpy Eagles eat sloths.

5105
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:34,640
I think Thursdays official sloths day.

5106
02:14:34,840 --> 02:14:35,673
If you're a slot,

5107
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:39,750
I think Harpy Eagles of the
biggest eagles in the world.

5108
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:41,880
I'm pretty sure that thing is Jack.

5109
02:14:42,450 --> 02:14:42,990
Oh yeah,

5110
02:14:42,990 --> 02:14:43,820
they're ruthless.

5111
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:43,911
Oh,

5112
02:14:43,911 --> 02:14:45,510
get this motherfucker swoops down.

5113
02:14:46,170 --> 02:14:47,130
What about vultures?

5114
02:14:47,131 --> 02:14:47,760
Man,

5115
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:48,593
they're big.

5116
02:14:48,630 --> 02:14:49,100
They're big.

5117
02:14:49,100 --> 02:14:52,200
The scary cause they're
not predators like that.

5118
02:14:52,201 --> 02:14:54,100
Sloths are gone or so that's a bummer.

5119
02:14:54,120 --> 02:14:55,710
That's a wrap like a sloths man.

5120
02:14:55,740 --> 02:14:58,140
But nature just made them
like real easy to eat,

5121
02:14:58,770 --> 02:15:01,860
but they really don't get fucked with
doe because they're not out in the open.

5122
02:15:01,861 --> 02:15:02,100
I the,

5123
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:03,600
when they are to get the cat monkey,

5124
02:15:04,140 --> 02:15:05,520
she'll goddamn slow.

5125
02:15:05,521 --> 02:15:06,960
These these Harpy Eagles,

5126
02:15:06,961 --> 02:15:08,280
they eat monkeys like crazy.

5127
02:15:08,460 --> 02:15:10,320
He swooped down and Jack monkeys in,

5128
02:15:10,321 --> 02:15:14,970
one of the things they found
on ancient primate skulls,

5129
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:20,130
they fell out all these weird scratches
and all this evidence of predation and

5130
02:15:20,220 --> 02:15:21,480
now they think that that,

5131
02:15:21,570 --> 02:15:21,870
Ooh.

5132
02:15:21,870 --> 02:15:22,703
He's like,

5133
02:15:22,940 --> 02:15:23,773
oh,

5134
02:15:24,140 --> 02:15:24,491
it's doing,

5135
02:15:24,491 --> 02:15:28,230
it's a little left and right now they
think that that scratching is probably

5136
02:15:28,231 --> 02:15:30,300
some sort of an ancient eagle.

5137
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:34,220
There was preying on ancient
hominids Jesus Christ.

5138
02:15:34,250 --> 02:15:34,680
Yeah,

5139
02:15:34,680 --> 02:15:35,810
birds are real PELICO.

5140
02:15:35,840 --> 02:15:36,930
They film this and put this in,

5141
02:15:36,931 --> 02:15:37,830
edited this together.

5142
02:15:38,740 --> 02:15:40,110
That's not going happen like this.

5143
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:42,780
It's all taken in different years.

5144
02:15:42,960 --> 02:15:45,630
But she got her license
disbelief just to watch him.

5145
02:15:45,631 --> 02:15:46,500
Jack a monkey

5146
02:15:48,020 --> 02:15:48,351
do what?

5147
02:15:48,351 --> 02:15:51,810
What's the big ass bird that grabs
the goats and drops some Feagles.

5148
02:15:51,870 --> 02:15:53,160
Those are Golden Eagles.

5149
02:15:53,220 --> 02:15:54,990
You're seeing that shit without guns.

5150
02:15:55,050 --> 02:15:56,860
What about the small notes?

5151
02:15:56,870 --> 02:16:00,030
Such Muslim guys with that falconry?

5152
02:16:00,031 --> 02:16:00,301
Yeah.

5153
02:16:00,301 --> 02:16:01,350
They use them to hunt.

5154
02:16:02,190 --> 02:16:05,310
They hunt rabbits and shit with them at
that bird that picks up a straight up

5155
02:16:05,311 --> 02:16:05,790
guy,

5156
02:16:05,790 --> 02:16:07,230
flies him up and like have fun.

5157
02:16:07,231 --> 02:16:08,040
My Man,

5158
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:09,570
I'm pretty sure those are golden eagles.

5159
02:16:09,571 --> 02:16:09,811
Yeah.

5160
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:11,190
Golden Eagles hunt goats.

5161
02:16:11,460 --> 02:16:12,240
Those are big.

5162
02:16:12,240 --> 02:16:15,090
I think those are the biggest
eagles in North America.

5163
02:16:15,240 --> 02:16:16,470
Those are big ass ego.

5164
02:16:16,560 --> 02:16:17,130
That shit.

5165
02:16:17,130 --> 02:16:18,540
Worst way to die period.

5166
02:16:18,541 --> 02:16:20,490
Where they grab these
goats now come with me.

5167
02:16:20,491 --> 02:16:21,324
Cool man.

5168
02:16:23,280 --> 02:16:23,640
Yeah.

5169
02:16:23,640 --> 02:16:24,900
All they're doing is dragging them down.

5170
02:16:24,930 --> 02:16:28,170
And the goats sometimes drag
the eagles down to the Eagle.

5171
02:16:28,171 --> 02:16:29,004
Takes a hit too.

5172
02:16:32,780 --> 02:16:33,613
Uhm,

5173
02:16:34,470 --> 02:16:35,710
and then the eagles are Ooh,

5174
02:16:35,711 --> 02:16:36,400
dinner,

5175
02:16:36,400 --> 02:16:40,390
nature fucker videos,

5176
02:16:40,400 --> 02:16:41,340
a bad motherfucker.

5177
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:42,970
And then you're kind of out of it.

5178
02:16:42,971 --> 02:16:44,380
Then you start to eat and your asshole.

5179
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:45,980
I don't think you're kind of out of it.

5180
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:48,490
And how long did he have
to wait for that to happen?

5181
02:16:48,940 --> 02:16:52,360
I know with the camera
that was caught a perfect,

5182
02:16:52,510 --> 02:16:54,430
I know that's a ruthless fucking burst.

5183
02:16:54,460 --> 02:16:55,820
Unless they bring their egos.

5184
02:16:56,560 --> 02:17:00,180
There's just such drug
look chum in the water.

5185
02:17:00,190 --> 02:17:01,720
Bill Cosby up those notes.

5186
02:17:02,430 --> 02:17:03,990
They get them all hungry and shit.

5187
02:17:07,100 --> 02:17:08,920
I got to change the Lens.

5188
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:09,850
The battery's dead.

5189
02:17:10,220 --> 02:17:11,240
Oh Man.

5190
02:17:11,960 --> 02:17:12,621
Do you ever seen them?

5191
02:17:12,621 --> 02:17:15,740
Ones that they use in Mongolia
where they chase down wolves?

5192
02:17:16,480 --> 02:17:16,640
Oh,

5193
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:17,473
is that it right here?

5194
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:18,540
Yeah.

5195
02:17:18,540 --> 02:17:19,100
Oh,

5196
02:17:19,100 --> 02:17:21,080
well they do foxes and even wolves,

5197
02:17:21,290 --> 02:17:21,771
but they,

5198
02:17:21,771 --> 02:17:22,100
uh,

5199
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:23,420
they train these Golden Eagle.

5200
02:17:23,421 --> 02:17:26,120
That's how big fucking bird
look how big that bird is.

5201
02:17:26,270 --> 02:17:27,860
And they put a Gopro on the bird's head.

5202
02:17:27,890 --> 02:17:28,820
Holy Shit.

5203
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,230
And they sent the bird down.

5204
02:17:30,231 --> 02:17:32,990
The bird just put the whacked
down on these poor Fox.

5205
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:33,351
They eat.

5206
02:17:33,351 --> 02:17:34,790
The was just doing it for the coats.

5207
02:17:34,820 --> 02:17:35,653
They kill them.

5208
02:17:35,960 --> 02:17:36,141
Oh,

5209
02:17:36,141 --> 02:17:36,890
the people,

5210
02:17:36,890 --> 02:17:37,940
I don't think they eat them.

5211
02:17:37,970 --> 02:17:38,690
They might,

5212
02:17:38,690 --> 02:17:38,961
you know,

5213
02:17:38,961 --> 02:17:41,270
apparently some trappers in pioneers,

5214
02:17:41,271 --> 02:17:42,081
we're big on eating.

5215
02:17:42,081 --> 02:17:43,460
Eagles are not eagles.

5216
02:17:43,490 --> 02:17:44,120
Um,

5217
02:17:44,120 --> 02:17:44,870
uh,

5218
02:17:44,870 --> 02:17:46,520
wolves they eat,

5219
02:17:46,550 --> 02:17:47,480
they ate a lot of wolves,

5220
02:17:47,481 --> 02:17:48,830
like some famous trappers.

5221
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:50,600
Goals were their favorite food,

5222
02:17:50,630 --> 02:17:52,040
whatever that lady's Eskimo or whatever.

5223
02:17:52,041 --> 02:17:54,470
She is stressed out that this thing
is not going to like catch it.

5224
02:17:54,890 --> 02:17:56,300
I think that's just what she looks like.

5225
02:17:58,400 --> 02:17:59,910
She's living a hard life son.

5226
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:01,100
Look at that.

5227
02:18:01,100 --> 02:18:03,290
The look at the fucking
Fox trying to fight,

5228
02:18:03,500 --> 02:18:04,850
trying to fight back in those clauses.

5229
02:18:06,100 --> 02:18:07,520
It's a vice grip.

5230
02:18:07,550 --> 02:18:10,040
Oh but you can get that beacon
vault soon on that neck.

5231
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:11,960
I think they'd have to
put the chase in later.

5232
02:18:11,990 --> 02:18:12,823
Like they get like,

5233
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:16,310
like train foxes and have
them running and shit.

5234
02:18:16,370 --> 02:18:17,600
The bitch hold a whistle.

5235
02:18:17,601 --> 02:18:18,230
Is that a thing?

5236
02:18:18,230 --> 02:18:19,760
Does that exactly what it is

5237
02:18:21,390 --> 02:18:23,270
that Fox put up like decent fight.

5238
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:25,490
The wolf one is even more disturbing.

5239
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:26,690
Oh the Fox is trying,

5240
02:18:26,691 --> 02:18:26,931
man.

5241
02:18:26,931 --> 02:18:27,381
He's trying,

5242
02:18:27,381 --> 02:18:28,160
but he's just kidding.

5243
02:18:28,160 --> 02:18:29,330
We got ourselves a fight here.

5244
02:18:29,720 --> 02:18:29,991
Yeah.

5245
02:18:29,991 --> 02:18:31,910
Well not really cause the
Fox can't even bite them.

5246
02:18:32,120 --> 02:18:32,990
They're so smart.

5247
02:18:32,991 --> 02:18:35,160
They just grab a hold of all birds.

5248
02:18:35,180 --> 02:18:36,180
Stress me out man.

5249
02:18:36,181 --> 02:18:36,831
Which is weird.

5250
02:18:36,831 --> 02:18:38,930
They figured out how to
train these things man.

5251
02:18:38,990 --> 02:18:41,900
When you call Your Eagle
stand against the wind.

5252
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:42,860
Oh that makes sense.

5253
02:18:42,890 --> 02:18:43,850
So the ego can hear you.

5254
02:18:46,220 --> 02:18:48,170
If you saw one of those
things coming right at you,

5255
02:18:48,290 --> 02:18:48,561
what?

5256
02:18:48,561 --> 02:18:50,730
Strike that overhand knife strength.

5257
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:52,190
I'll just come around at all.

5258
02:18:52,740 --> 02:18:53,900
You got to grapple with an eagle.

5259
02:18:54,380 --> 02:18:55,990
This fucking the problem.

5260
02:18:55,991 --> 02:18:57,200
Have them arms.

5261
02:18:57,350 --> 02:18:58,650
I don't think if you hit him there,

5262
02:18:58,700 --> 02:19:02,060
they're not heavy enough for it to make
like a lot of impact when you hit him.

5263
02:19:02,480 --> 02:19:03,200
You know what I'm saying?

5264
02:19:03,200 --> 02:19:04,580
It's not like you're hitting a dog.

5265
02:19:04,700 --> 02:19:04,881
Right.

5266
02:19:04,881 --> 02:19:06,170
If you punch a dog in the face,

5267
02:19:06,171 --> 02:19:07,380
a dog weighs 70 pounds.

5268
02:19:07,381 --> 02:19:07,511
They're,

5269
02:19:07,511 --> 02:19:09,320
they're both squishing
the stance you're getting.

5270
02:19:09,321 --> 02:19:10,154
You see her coming,

5271
02:19:10,310 --> 02:19:12,140
you get hands out,

5272
02:19:12,160 --> 02:19:12,351
hands,

5273
02:19:12,351 --> 02:19:12,571
handouts,

5274
02:19:12,571 --> 02:19:13,404
trips like this.

5275
02:19:13,580 --> 02:19:15,260
Hands out like this people coming in,

5276
02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:16,110
right?

5277
02:19:16,110 --> 02:19:16,943
Yeah.

5278
02:19:17,210 --> 02:19:19,400
I'm trying to grab shit and
I'm trying to tear it apart.

5279
02:19:19,401 --> 02:19:20,550
Trying to rampage Jackson,

5280
02:19:20,570 --> 02:19:23,630
trying to get my feet on his dick
and I'm trying to pull them legs.

5281
02:19:24,540 --> 02:19:25,040
Yes.

5282
02:19:25,040 --> 02:19:27,830
Tried to make some Kentucky
Fried Chicken drumstick.

5283
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:28,240
Yeah.

5284
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:29,540
You got to pull those legs apart.

5285
02:19:30,140 --> 02:19:30,510
Yes.

5286
02:19:30,510 --> 02:19:32,080
Slam his fucking head into the ground.

5287
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:34,280
The why you got to land on your arms,

5288
02:19:34,281 --> 02:19:34,470
right?

5289
02:19:34,470 --> 02:19:34,830
You're like,

5290
02:19:34,830 --> 02:19:35,130
yes.

5291
02:19:35,130 --> 02:19:35,390
Yeah.

5292
02:19:35,390 --> 02:19:38,640
Lands on your arm for them that
you getting tore up one arm.

5293
02:19:38,690 --> 02:19:39,580
You give them one on one.

5294
02:19:39,590 --> 02:19:42,560
Maybe you take your shirt and then
wrap that bitch around your arms.

5295
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:43,680
Yeah,

5296
02:19:43,680 --> 02:19:44,513
that's it.

5297
02:19:44,730 --> 02:19:45,563
Yeah,

5298
02:19:46,430 --> 02:19:47,120
that's it.

5299
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:47,391
Yeah,

5300
02:19:47,391 --> 02:19:48,260
and you got to grab them.

5301
02:19:48,261 --> 02:19:48,740
Talents.

5302
02:19:48,740 --> 02:19:49,461
Got to grab the speed.

5303
02:19:49,461 --> 02:19:50,270
I don't think they,

5304
02:19:50,270 --> 02:19:53,240
I don't think they attack with a beak as
much as they attack with the towns and

5305
02:19:53,241 --> 02:19:53,860
eat with the beat.

5306
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:55,040
They come feet first.

5307
02:19:55,060 --> 02:19:55,820
Yeah.

5308
02:19:55,820 --> 02:19:57,170
Like when they catch a salmon,

5309
02:19:57,200 --> 02:19:58,450
how are they going to get around this?

5310
02:19:58,520 --> 02:19:59,660
Thinking about how powerful they are.

5311
02:19:59,661 --> 02:20:00,950
What if you had to grab a salmon,

5312
02:20:01,380 --> 02:20:02,600
what did I say wrong?

5313
02:20:02,630 --> 02:20:03,980
You gotta reach in and
grab it with your hands.

5314
02:20:03,981 --> 02:20:07,400
No chance they swimming
down and fly with it.

5315
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:11,450
They snatched it out of the water and
fly away with a standard long lasting

5316
02:20:11,460 --> 02:20:12,210
males.

5317
02:20:12,210 --> 02:20:12,600
Yeah.

5318
02:20:12,600 --> 02:20:14,040
You'd probably be able to grab him to,

5319
02:20:15,390 --> 02:20:16,270
you'd have to have some serious,

5320
02:20:16,540 --> 02:20:17,930
also not very cuddly,

5321
02:20:17,931 --> 02:20:20,570
like they're fucking evil

5322
02:20:22,550 --> 02:20:25,460
tribal cultures that let their nails
grow and they sharpen them and they use

5323
02:20:25,461 --> 02:20:27,680
them as like weapons and war.

5324
02:20:27,890 --> 02:20:29,810
We have bitch nails are nails fall apart.

5325
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:31,073
You know our nails,

5326
02:20:31,180 --> 02:20:32,500
if you get him slammed in the door,

5327
02:20:32,510 --> 02:20:33,410
cause we don't use them.

5328
02:20:33,470 --> 02:20:34,220
Maybe they're supposed to,

5329
02:20:34,220 --> 02:20:35,690
we don't really need caught.

5330
02:20:35,691 --> 02:20:38,240
A salmon are supposed to have claws.

5331
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:39,230
That guy's a beast.

5332
02:20:40,180 --> 02:20:41,030
The water.

5333
02:20:41,470 --> 02:20:42,860
Why this is different,

5334
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:43,041
man.

5335
02:20:43,041 --> 02:20:44,720
These things are males are,

5336
02:20:44,750 --> 02:20:45,640
he's going to eat it too.

5337
02:20:45,700 --> 02:20:46,533
Yeah.

5338
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:47,873
Geez.

5339
02:20:48,270 --> 02:20:49,610
Bare hands and eat it raw.

5340
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:50,450
Ooh,

5341
02:20:50,450 --> 02:20:54,620
you're not supposed to really eat salmon
Sushi even because my Paris like the

5342
02:20:54,621 --> 02:20:55,430
shit out of it.

5343
02:20:55,430 --> 02:20:56,241
It's not smart.

5344
02:20:56,241 --> 02:20:57,074
I feel good.

5345
02:20:57,230 --> 02:20:59,600
You can get parasites
guys going to eat it raw.

5346
02:20:59,690 --> 02:21:00,523
Yeah.

5347
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:01,610
Well a lot of people do,

5348
02:21:02,270 --> 02:21:05,000
but when you talk to like people
that want to play it safe,

5349
02:21:05,001 --> 02:21:06,170
they say you should need anything.

5350
02:21:06,171 --> 02:21:07,490
That's a fresh water.

5351
02:21:07,790 --> 02:21:08,660
Don't eat fresh water.

5352
02:21:09,320 --> 02:21:10,070
Well this guy's,

5353
02:21:10,070 --> 02:21:11,810
do you think it's gross?

5354
02:21:11,811 --> 02:21:12,830
But do you like Sushi?

5355
02:21:12,831 --> 02:21:13,180
You don't need it.

5356
02:21:13,180 --> 02:21:14,030
I hate Sushi.

5357
02:21:14,031 --> 02:21:15,670
You don't like Sushi Joe Eight he's got,

5358
02:21:16,280 --> 02:21:18,500
I used to go to when Eddie
and I would go to restaurants,

5359
02:21:18,530 --> 02:21:20,280
I used to lose my fucking mind cause ed,

5360
02:21:20,281 --> 02:21:21,950
he's like no Cilantro,

5361
02:21:22,450 --> 02:21:23,150
onions,

5362
02:21:23,150 --> 02:21:23,960
Callidus.

5363
02:21:23,960 --> 02:21:24,850
That's how Brian,

5364
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,170
I don't need all that chip.

5365
02:21:27,171 --> 02:21:28,010
The meat's good.

5366
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:29,570
Why do I need onions and shit on it?

5367
02:21:29,870 --> 02:21:30,890
Give me some good meat.

5368
02:21:30,920 --> 02:21:32,810
The best is going to Fogo with him though.

5369
02:21:32,870 --> 02:21:34,100
Then there's no bro Shit.

5370
02:21:34,160 --> 02:21:34,531
You know,

5371
02:21:34,531 --> 02:21:38,810
you just get this on this flip that pinch
over what's happening with the Fogo de

5372
02:21:38,810 --> 02:21:38,840
Chao.

5373
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:39,710
We went in Vegas,

5374
02:21:39,740 --> 02:21:40,870
we've chatted up con.

5375
02:21:40,871 --> 02:21:41,210
Yeah,

5376
02:21:41,210 --> 02:21:42,990
we gained like fucking 10 pounds.

5377
02:21:43,980 --> 02:21:44,621
We feast.

5378
02:21:44,621 --> 02:21:45,890
It sounds nice.

5379
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:46,701
Oh so good.

5380
02:21:46,701 --> 02:21:47,840
I hadn't been there in forever.

5381
02:21:48,200 --> 02:21:49,100
We had a good time.

5382
02:21:50,240 --> 02:21:51,140
Well you don't really have,

5383
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:52,280
I was going to say munchies,

5384
02:21:52,310 --> 02:21:53,143
but when you get the high,

5385
02:21:53,320 --> 02:21:54,170
you get high so much.

5386
02:21:54,171 --> 02:21:55,040
He probably doesn't fuck with you,

5387
02:21:55,041 --> 02:21:57,170
but since you're not got
the munchies from pot,

5388
02:21:57,171 --> 02:21:58,580
man probably never know.

5389
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:01,160
I mean not get hungry like normal,

5390
02:22:01,190 --> 02:22:01,791
but pot was,

5391
02:22:01,791 --> 02:22:06,470
it never gave me munchies cause now
you're off the hot food tastes way better

5392
02:22:06,471 --> 02:22:06,770
though,

5393
02:22:06,770 --> 02:22:07,560
that's for sure.

5394
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:08,393
It does.

5395
02:22:09,110 --> 02:22:09,450
Yeah.

5396
02:22:09,450 --> 02:22:11,060
He's smoking a little bit.

5397
02:22:11,090 --> 02:22:12,040
I mean I do too.

5398
02:22:12,370 --> 02:22:13,190
Yeah.

5399
02:22:13,190 --> 02:22:14,023
Do you use it to write?

5400
02:22:14,570 --> 02:22:14,990
No,

5401
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:15,231
you don't,

5402
02:22:15,231 --> 02:22:15,650
right?

5403
02:22:15,650 --> 02:22:16,280
No.

5404
02:22:16,280 --> 02:22:17,113
He should try to.

5405
02:22:17,130 --> 02:22:17,790
Right?

5406
02:22:17,790 --> 02:22:18,140
Yeah.

5407
02:22:18,140 --> 02:22:19,190
Since you're doing stand up,

5408
02:22:19,191 --> 02:22:20,310
you should definitely write hi.

5409
02:22:20,360 --> 02:22:20,800
Yeah,

5410
02:22:20,800 --> 02:22:21,410
I did.

5411
02:22:21,410 --> 02:22:22,141
That's the day.

5412
02:22:22,141 --> 02:22:24,350
That's where you know
what I do don't I do both.

5413
02:22:24,380 --> 02:22:26,010
I write sober and I write hi.

5414
02:22:26,370 --> 02:22:27,930
I do both and sometimes I break.

5415
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:30,300
Listen to George Carlin talk about that
once he was saying that he likes to

5416
02:22:30,301 --> 02:22:32,630
write sober and then
he touches everything,

5417
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:34,170
not punches it up when he's high.

5418
02:22:34,500 --> 02:22:34,591
Well,

5419
02:22:34,591 --> 02:22:35,400
that makes sense.

5420
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:35,830
Yeah.

5421
02:22:35,830 --> 02:22:37,900
Like smoke a little weed and
then go over the material back.

5422
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:38,940
But what's funny about it?

5423
02:22:38,941 --> 02:22:39,390
Yeah.

5424
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:40,223
Yeah.

5425
02:22:40,230 --> 02:22:41,280
I like both men.

5426
02:22:41,370 --> 02:22:42,360
I like writing,

5427
02:22:42,720 --> 02:22:44,460
writing sober and riding high,

5428
02:22:44,461 --> 02:22:45,780
but when I write high it's like,

5429
02:22:45,781 --> 02:22:47,250
are you just get these gifts?

5430
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:49,350
It's like the universe
gives you these gifts.

5431
02:22:49,380 --> 02:22:49,891
Like where is this?

5432
02:22:49,891 --> 02:22:51,270
Even comedies as it funny too.

5433
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:51,970
When you're highly,

5434
02:22:51,970 --> 02:22:53,130
you look back over when you're sober,

5435
02:22:53,131 --> 02:22:53,341
that guy,

5436
02:22:53,341 --> 02:22:54,930
what the fuck was definitely that?

5437
02:22:54,931 --> 02:22:55,950
I used to have a bit about it,

5438
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:59,670
but I literally wrote down a Unicorn as
a donkey from the future and then I went

5439
02:22:59,671 --> 02:23:00,540
down and looked at my notes and,

5440
02:23:00,550 --> 02:23:00,670
well,

5441
02:23:00,670 --> 02:23:02,430
what the fuck does that even mean?

5442
02:23:02,460 --> 02:23:03,050
Exactly.

5443
02:23:03,050 --> 02:23:03,883
The

5444
02:23:06,060 --> 02:23:09,870
funny thing about it that you didn't write
down exactly and you forgot it was so

5445
02:23:09,871 --> 02:23:10,410
high,

5446
02:23:10,410 --> 02:23:13,110
but I wrote it down and then I went
over it two days after the fact.

5447
02:23:13,111 --> 02:23:13,501
It was like,

5448
02:23:13,501 --> 02:23:15,030
what the fuck is wrong with me?

5449
02:23:15,280 --> 02:23:16,410
I wrote that down,

5450
02:23:17,540 --> 02:23:19,170
I bring a bunch of shit down.

5451
02:23:19,470 --> 02:23:22,380
Like I have to see every now and then
cause a lot of what I write down,

5452
02:23:22,381 --> 02:23:25,290
if I'm high I'll write down some shit
like at the comedy store or something like

5453
02:23:25,291 --> 02:23:25,740
that.

5454
02:23:25,740 --> 02:23:27,750
And then I have to go over
my notes when I'm sober.

5455
02:23:27,900 --> 02:23:28,733
I'm like,

5456
02:23:29,270 --> 02:23:30,010
Eh,

5457
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:30,843
I do not.

5458
02:23:31,270 --> 02:23:32,970
I do on your phone and do it physically.

5459
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:38,190
Well physically like with a computer
and then I write notes on the computer.

5460
02:23:38,461 --> 02:23:39,300
What does that mean?

5461
02:23:39,420 --> 02:23:43,260
I mean it's a tiny the
computer like physically,

5462
02:23:43,261 --> 02:23:44,094
right?

5463
02:23:44,190 --> 02:23:44,970
Like uh,

5464
02:23:44,970 --> 02:23:46,950
I thought physically was like with a pen.

5465
02:23:47,100 --> 02:23:47,551
No,

5466
02:23:47,551 --> 02:23:50,010
but this is what I would
probably wrong way to say it,

5467
02:23:50,011 --> 02:23:51,690
but I have three stages,

5468
02:23:51,691 --> 02:23:52,080
right?

5469
02:23:52,080 --> 02:23:53,670
I write with a computer,

5470
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:55,980
but then I write things down on paper.

5471
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:57,690
Like if I have to like do a set,

5472
02:23:57,750 --> 02:23:59,610
I write a set list out with paper.

5473
02:23:59,730 --> 02:24:01,980
I'm really interested
in this new Samsung man.

5474
02:24:02,220 --> 02:24:03,720
The Samsung note eight.

5475
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:03,961
Yeah,

5476
02:24:03,961 --> 02:24:04,771
because the note eight,

5477
02:24:04,771 --> 02:24:06,240
you write on the lock screen,

5478
02:24:06,510 --> 02:24:08,250
you don't even have to
open up an application.

5479
02:24:08,280 --> 02:24:08,910
I like that.

5480
02:24:08,910 --> 02:24:10,590
Right on the lock screen.

5481
02:24:10,620 --> 02:24:11,640
And you write it with a pen.

5482
02:24:11,641 --> 02:24:15,120
You could write like a hundred pages of
notes just on the lock screen and you

5483
02:24:15,121 --> 02:24:15,954
could save him.

5484
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,033
Have you seen that yet?

5485
02:24:17,340 --> 02:24:18,360
What does an apple do?

5486
02:24:18,361 --> 02:24:18,931
That shit.

5487
02:24:18,931 --> 02:24:19,764
They'll jump on.

5488
02:24:20,220 --> 02:24:21,210
Samsung's got it,

5489
02:24:21,211 --> 02:24:21,680
man.

5490
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:24,750
You apple gets sued left
and right for patents.

5491
02:24:24,930 --> 02:24:26,430
They got sued for these new,

5492
02:24:26,431 --> 02:24:26,700
uh,

5493
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:28,770
animated emojis that are coming out with,

5494
02:24:28,771 --> 02:24:31,230
on the iPhone x 10 whatever it is.

5495
02:24:31,920 --> 02:24:32,341
My phone.

5496
02:24:32,341 --> 02:24:34,530
So fucking rough right now.

5497
02:24:34,531 --> 02:24:38,460
I need one which got
seven plus but gets bro.

5498
02:24:38,490 --> 02:24:39,320
It's horrible.

5499
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:40,800
It's all my wife got the eight.

5500
02:24:40,801 --> 02:24:41,461
It's the shit.

5501
02:24:41,461 --> 02:24:41,901
Is it nice?

5502
02:24:41,901 --> 02:24:42,691
It looks just like this,

5503
02:24:42,691 --> 02:24:44,160
but the camera's way better.

5504
02:24:44,460 --> 02:24:46,770
The camera's wicked and
you can get it right now.

5505
02:24:46,890 --> 02:24:48,390
But the thing about the new one,

5506
02:24:48,570 --> 02:24:49,230
the uh,

5507
02:24:49,230 --> 02:24:50,100
the x,

5508
02:24:50,430 --> 02:24:52,390
the axe is weird man because a,

5509
02:24:52,440 --> 02:24:54,720
it doesn't have a fingerprint
thing where you open it,

5510
02:24:54,721 --> 02:24:55,860
you open it with your Mug,

5511
02:24:56,220 --> 02:24:56,881
with your face.

5512
02:24:56,881 --> 02:24:57,510
Stare at it.

5513
02:24:57,510 --> 02:24:58,470
I don't like the open,

5514
02:24:58,471 --> 02:24:59,304
so I'm like,

5515
02:24:59,730 --> 02:25:00,960
get your phone and just do this.

5516
02:25:01,830 --> 02:25:02,041
Hey,

5517
02:25:02,041 --> 02:25:02,611
what's up man?

5518
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:03,850
I'm like your face and go get,

5519
02:25:03,880 --> 02:25:05,220
you can go get the eight right now.

5520
02:25:05,730 --> 02:25:06,720
The eight yes.

5521
02:25:06,760 --> 02:25:07,680
You get the eight right now.

5522
02:25:07,940 --> 02:25:08,910
I need to get that bitch tomorrow.

5523
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:10,740
Eight is basically this
phone but way better.

5524
02:25:11,160 --> 02:25:12,300
It's exact same.

5525
02:25:12,360 --> 02:25:15,210
This is a seven but the aid
is the exact same phone.

5526
02:25:15,211 --> 02:25:17,700
It has like all the stain
but I'll tell you what man,

5527
02:25:17,701 --> 02:25:19,410
my phone has been fucking up lately.

5528
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:22,770
The old one right to
apple does on purpose.

5529
02:25:23,140 --> 02:25:23,973
Don't get that new one.

5530
02:25:24,330 --> 02:25:28,180
They says you need an update
update cause they play those games.

5531
02:25:28,181 --> 02:25:29,220
They dropped that bug.

5532
02:25:30,070 --> 02:25:30,540
Fuck.

5533
02:25:30,540 --> 02:25:32,230
As soon as you update then you're fucked.

5534
02:25:32,370 --> 02:25:32,740
Fuck.

5535
02:25:32,740 --> 02:25:34,040
I held it off for a while.

5536
02:25:34,620 --> 02:25:35,453
I'm going super,

5537
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:36,641
super strong.

5538
02:25:36,641 --> 02:25:37,121
My phone,

5539
02:25:37,121 --> 02:25:40,900
not only is it freeze but now when I
like say if you sent me a text like today

5540
02:25:40,901 --> 02:25:41,680
it happened.

5541
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:46,060
You sent me a text saying which door
should I go into and I replied to you and

5542
02:25:46,061 --> 02:25:49,660
then I went to look at my phone
and there was no place to reply.

5543
02:25:50,050 --> 02:25:51,160
It didn't exist.

5544
02:25:51,370 --> 02:25:53,400
I couldn't pull it up so I should I,

5545
02:25:53,560 --> 02:25:54,041
I went,

5546
02:25:54,041 --> 02:25:58,570
I hit the home button and then I reopened
the text messages back to the same

5547
02:25:58,571 --> 02:25:58,960
thing,

5548
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:03,700
so I had to physically like swipe up and
close out the text message program and

5549
02:26:03,701 --> 02:26:08,050
then start it up again just to get a
dialogue where I could like press the keys

5550
02:26:08,051 --> 02:26:08,450
in.

5551
02:26:08,450 --> 02:26:09,520
It wouldn't let me press the keys.

5552
02:26:09,540 --> 02:26:10,140
It's apple.

5553
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:10,361
Tony,

5554
02:26:10,361 --> 02:26:11,200
get a new phone.

5555
02:26:12,340 --> 02:26:13,000
You need your cell phone.

5556
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:14,610
The iPhone eight and I think,

5557
02:26:14,890 --> 02:26:16,180
I think I'm at the six still.

5558
02:26:16,181 --> 02:26:17,370
I don't even know what this a dam.

5559
02:26:17,590 --> 02:26:19,480
That's the three c Jamie,

5560
02:26:19,510 --> 02:26:19,751
Jamie,

5561
02:26:19,751 --> 02:26:23,590
see if you could pull up a video
on the Samsung Galaxy note eight.

5562
02:26:24,010 --> 02:26:26,080
This galaxy note eight has got me very,

5563
02:26:26,081 --> 02:26:27,160
I'm very curious,

5564
02:26:27,430 --> 02:26:30,520
but there's a bunch of things that
apple does that keeps you on the tit.

5565
02:26:31,060 --> 02:26:32,440
One of them is that airdrop,

5566
02:26:32,510 --> 02:26:34,270
like if made it forever,

5567
02:26:34,271 --> 02:26:35,120
then once I went to it,

5568
02:26:35,121 --> 02:26:35,954
so easy man.

5569
02:26:35,980 --> 02:26:36,780
It's pretty easy.

5570
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:37,613
So easy.

5571
02:26:38,350 --> 02:26:38,800
Yeah,

5572
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,390
everything's pretty good use that.

5573
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:41,710
I use it all the time,

5574
02:26:41,711 --> 02:26:43,690
but say like if we made
a video right here,

5575
02:26:43,720 --> 02:26:44,830
I would airdrop it to you.

5576
02:26:44,880 --> 02:26:46,690
She can't text it because
the file is so big.

5577
02:26:46,691 --> 02:26:51,280
If you instead of it texting it just goes
through Bluetooth because you're near

5578
02:26:51,281 --> 02:26:52,840
me and it sends it to you in full.

5579
02:26:52,840 --> 02:26:53,890
So this is it right here.

5580
02:26:54,100 --> 02:26:55,720
This is the galaxy note eight.

5581
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:58,360
It's fucking huge and it's all screen.

5582
02:26:58,630 --> 02:27:01,540
They have a little bit of room for like
the speakers on it but the screen is

5583
02:27:01,541 --> 02:27:02,350
gigantic.

5584
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:02,771
I like that.

5585
02:27:02,771 --> 02:27:04,030
And they pulled that pen out.

5586
02:27:04,031 --> 02:27:05,710
That Penn is so dope dude.

5587
02:27:05,890 --> 02:27:07,210
It lets you do all kinds of shit.

5588
02:27:07,211 --> 02:27:08,410
Like if someone sends you a picture,

5589
02:27:08,411 --> 02:27:10,570
you could highlight things with that pen.

5590
02:27:10,571 --> 02:27:10,800
Dude,

5591
02:27:10,800 --> 02:27:12,140
you're selling the fuck
out of me right now.

5592
02:27:12,480 --> 02:27:13,313
Look at them market.

5593
02:27:13,690 --> 02:27:15,520
You could write notes with your hand.

5594
02:27:15,910 --> 02:27:19,120
See this to me is big because then I
don't have to take a notebook with me.

5595
02:27:19,121 --> 02:27:21,000
I don't need a light pad
or anything like that.

5596
02:27:21,090 --> 02:27:22,290
You write it like look at this.

5597
02:27:22,300 --> 02:27:23,860
This guy wants to highlight some shit.

5598
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:24,431
Look,

5599
02:27:24,431 --> 02:27:28,210
you could translate things I guess to
another country like do that and boom,

5600
02:27:28,270 --> 02:27:29,740
it translates shit for you.

5601
02:27:30,010 --> 02:27:31,510
It charges wirelessly.

5602
02:27:32,290 --> 02:27:32,531
Yeah,

5603
02:27:32,531 --> 02:27:32,791
look at it.

5604
02:27:32,791 --> 02:27:34,710
I'm a spokesman from Biloxi.

5605
02:27:34,780 --> 02:27:35,170
Look at that.

5606
02:27:35,170 --> 02:27:35,700
Ooh,

5607
02:27:35,700 --> 02:27:36,040
but Joe,

5608
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:36,641
how's it work?

5609
02:27:36,641 --> 02:27:40,440
If I went from the apple phone that
does all my shit transfer over.

5610
02:27:40,480 --> 02:27:40,760
No.

5611
02:27:40,760 --> 02:27:41,380
Yeah,

5612
02:27:41,380 --> 02:27:43,500
sort of the problem is the real pro.

5613
02:27:43,510 --> 02:27:47,110
I tried it with a Google pips
pixel just for shits and giggles.

5614
02:27:47,350 --> 02:27:47,741
The real,

5615
02:27:47,741 --> 02:27:49,660
we'll get that like he's white
and notes with that thing.

5616
02:27:49,690 --> 02:27:50,081
Come on.

5617
02:27:50,081 --> 02:27:50,590
So on,

5618
02:27:50,590 --> 02:27:51,550
on the lock screen,

5619
02:27:51,940 --> 02:27:53,890
the real problem is,

5620
02:27:53,980 --> 02:27:54,800
uh,

5621
02:27:54,800 --> 02:27:55,810
I messages.

5622
02:27:55,990 --> 02:27:58,770
So like say if someone's like
used to sending you ims does,

5623
02:27:58,790 --> 02:27:59,770
you send them my messages.

5624
02:28:00,190 --> 02:28:01,720
It doesn't want to send you a text.

5625
02:28:02,050 --> 02:28:02,500
It wants,

5626
02:28:02,500 --> 02:28:06,220
it wants to continue to send imessages
and it takes a long time to switch over.

5627
02:28:06,221 --> 02:28:08,500
I actually called up apple and I said,

5628
02:28:08,740 --> 02:28:12,640
I want you to remove me
from the I message database.

5629
02:28:12,670 --> 02:28:14,280
Like remove my email from ims,

5630
02:28:14,281 --> 02:28:14,561
iMessage,

5631
02:28:14,561 --> 02:28:15,394
remove me.

5632
02:28:15,460 --> 02:28:15,881
And they said,

5633
02:28:15,881 --> 02:28:16,220
why?

5634
02:28:16,220 --> 02:28:16,451
I said,

5635
02:28:16,451 --> 02:28:17,281
because I've got a Google phone.

5636
02:28:17,281 --> 02:28:17,501
I said,

5637
02:28:17,501 --> 02:28:18,191
why did you do that?

5638
02:28:18,191 --> 02:28:18,461
And I said,

5639
02:28:18,461 --> 02:28:21,470
that's none of your business
pitch removing me motherfucker.

5640
02:28:21,610 --> 02:28:22,400
So they removed

5641
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:25,850
me from the a I message database
and it still wouldn't work.

5642
02:28:25,880 --> 02:28:27,290
I mean it would work half the time.

5643
02:28:28,010 --> 02:28:29,120
It's a deal breaker for me.

5644
02:28:29,300 --> 02:28:32,000
All the people that had
android phones all work great.

5645
02:28:32,230 --> 02:28:32,630
Like,

5646
02:28:32,630 --> 02:28:32,811
yeah,

5647
02:28:32,811 --> 02:28:34,940
but how many people have android phones?

5648
02:28:34,950 --> 02:28:36,980
I know a few people that
have android phones.

5649
02:28:37,160 --> 02:28:37,993
Yeah,

5650
02:28:38,410 --> 02:28:38,661
he ain't,

5651
02:28:38,661 --> 02:28:39,470
Edwards has one.

5652
02:28:39,470 --> 02:28:39,841
Steve,

5653
02:28:39,841 --> 02:28:40,220
uh,

5654
02:28:40,220 --> 02:28:41,053
Rinella has one.

5655
02:28:41,270 --> 02:28:42,800
I have a few friends that have androids.

5656
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:43,341
Ramey.

5657
02:28:43,341 --> 02:28:45,500
Warren has one but the majority don't.

5658
02:28:45,501 --> 02:28:46,740
So you have ice shoes.

5659
02:28:46,870 --> 02:28:47,210
Yeah.

5660
02:28:47,210 --> 02:28:47,811
And you don't get it.

5661
02:28:47,811 --> 02:28:48,470
You get,

5662
02:28:48,470 --> 02:28:50,090
I get sad when I see a green text.

5663
02:28:50,240 --> 02:28:51,080
I like bling to,

5664
02:28:51,081 --> 02:28:53,260
it bums me out like fuck,

5665
02:28:53,630 --> 02:28:54,410
he's got one of them.

5666
02:28:54,410 --> 02:28:55,490
I judged people.

5667
02:28:56,210 --> 02:28:57,170
People do judge me,

5668
02:28:57,171 --> 02:28:58,020
but somebody,

5669
02:28:58,050 --> 02:28:59,660
some comedian had a bit about it.

5670
02:28:59,661 --> 02:29:02,030
I think what's cool can up
with a girl and you know,

5671
02:29:02,031 --> 02:29:05,570
she's broke when you get a green
text from her broke screen,

5672
02:29:05,590 --> 02:29:05,980
like people,

5673
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:06,620
someone Ah,

5674
02:29:06,620 --> 02:29:06,831
dude,

5675
02:29:06,831 --> 02:29:08,240
your phone bumps and me out of friends.

5676
02:29:08,250 --> 02:29:09,710
Seg is all your phone bums me out,

5677
02:29:09,711 --> 02:29:09,861
man,

5678
02:29:09,861 --> 02:29:10,580
because it's broken.

5679
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:11,331
It's all screens.

5680
02:29:11,331 --> 02:29:12,170
All broke my case.

5681
02:29:13,110 --> 02:29:14,180
You live in your life.

5682
02:29:14,240 --> 02:29:14,391
Yeah,

5683
02:29:14,391 --> 02:29:15,224
you're right.

5684
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:20,390
What's cool about the green tags is the
person you're texting with doesn't see

5685
02:29:20,391 --> 02:29:20,571
that.

5686
02:29:20,571 --> 02:29:20,961
You're like,

5687
02:29:20,961 --> 02:29:21,420
you know,

5688
02:29:21,420 --> 02:29:24,020
you're texting and then
sometimes the bubble,

5689
02:29:24,500 --> 02:29:25,760
sometimes you're not writing anything.

5690
02:29:25,761 --> 02:29:27,220
You're just reviewing the tax,

5691
02:29:27,221 --> 02:29:28,190
your conversation,

5692
02:29:28,490 --> 02:29:31,430
trying to figure out high and they think
that you're writing something and then

5693
02:29:31,431 --> 02:29:31,790
they,

5694
02:29:31,790 --> 02:29:32,330
they,

5695
02:29:32,330 --> 02:29:33,510
then you see the dirt riding seven,

5696
02:29:33,511 --> 02:29:34,344
then they stop.

5697
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:35,440
You know,

5698
02:29:35,440 --> 02:29:36,290
I'm not sure

5699
02:29:41,520 --> 02:29:42,360
that I did.

5700
02:29:42,470 --> 02:29:45,110
I've done that to my wife where
I'm about to text something.

5701
02:29:45,140 --> 02:29:45,973
I don't,

5702
02:29:46,180 --> 02:29:46,940
then I don't,

5703
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:47,630
and then she'll say,

5704
02:29:47,630 --> 02:29:49,040
why were you thinking about something?

5705
02:29:49,180 --> 02:29:50,570
And then you,

5706
02:29:50,730 --> 02:29:52,450
your mind

5707
02:29:54,630 --> 02:29:55,660
about something.

5708
02:29:55,730 --> 02:29:59,360
You were about to write some
shit and then it turned off.

5709
02:29:59,361 --> 02:30:00,171
What were you thinking?

5710
02:30:00,171 --> 02:30:01,004
Tell me.

5711
02:30:06,320 --> 02:30:07,730
Kissy Emoji.

5712
02:30:07,731 --> 02:30:10,500
But I decided it's not
appropriate for the,

5713
02:30:10,510 --> 02:30:12,350
I took off the thing where it says read.

5714
02:30:12,470 --> 02:30:13,101
Oh yeah,

5715
02:30:13,101 --> 02:30:14,330
I was just gonna say that that's,

5716
02:30:14,360 --> 02:30:15,320
that's a bad,

5717
02:30:15,380 --> 02:30:16,100
you might not have,

5718
02:30:16,100 --> 02:30:17,060
you might have that on there.

5719
02:30:17,270 --> 02:30:18,740
When you get a text message,

5720
02:30:19,140 --> 02:30:21,320
if you look at it and you send the thing,

5721
02:30:21,380 --> 02:30:22,340
like if you look at it,

5722
02:30:22,400 --> 02:30:23,810
that person knows you looked at it.

5723
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:24,051
Yeah.

5724
02:30:24,051 --> 02:30:24,530
If you're looking for,

5725
02:30:24,530 --> 02:30:25,610
did I say

5726
02:30:29,830 --> 02:30:31,370
it's like if someone texts me,

5727
02:30:31,371 --> 02:30:33,020
I might just go straight to the texts,

5728
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:33,501
you know,

5729
02:30:33,501 --> 02:30:36,560
just to see like what the messages
because I don't have time.

5730
02:30:36,590 --> 02:30:36,861
Right.

5731
02:30:36,861 --> 02:30:37,131
You know,

5732
02:30:37,131 --> 02:30:38,240
we don't have time for everybody,

5733
02:30:38,290 --> 02:30:39,130
so fucked up.

5734
02:30:39,270 --> 02:30:42,200
The other day I got 39 text messages.

5735
02:30:42,201 --> 02:30:44,720
I counted up from a psycho or
a bunch of people in the day,

5736
02:30:44,810 --> 02:30:46,800
39 I can't keep up with all the time.

5737
02:30:47,060 --> 02:30:48,080
39 different people.

5738
02:30:48,080 --> 02:30:48,920
Text messaged me,

5739
02:30:49,310 --> 02:30:50,600
what is my job?

5740
02:30:50,601 --> 02:30:52,300
Just replying texts that took us up.

5741
02:30:52,301 --> 02:30:53,180
That's my job.

5742
02:30:53,390 --> 02:30:54,770
Then I got to sit down and just,

5743
02:30:54,830 --> 02:30:56,150
and then people go,

5744
02:30:56,151 --> 02:30:56,301
Hey,

5745
02:30:56,301 --> 02:30:56,751
what's up?

5746
02:30:56,751 --> 02:30:57,290
Like those,

5747
02:30:57,290 --> 02:30:58,280
those don't get a reply.

5748
02:30:58,850 --> 02:30:59,031
Hey,

5749
02:30:59,031 --> 02:30:59,510
what's up?

5750
02:30:59,510 --> 02:31:00,021
What's up?

5751
02:31:00,021 --> 02:31:03,650
Call me or my family or our aunt or,

5752
02:31:03,920 --> 02:31:05,660
or answer a non question.

5753
02:31:06,220 --> 02:31:07,370
Maybe I'll get back to that.

5754
02:31:07,371 --> 02:31:11,060
Like for me it's like right now I got
to answer these and I'll try to catch up

5755
02:31:11,061 --> 02:31:11,630
to those.

5756
02:31:11,630 --> 02:31:12,450
You go to one,

5757
02:31:12,450 --> 02:31:15,830
you lock yourself away doing
a podcast for three hours,

5758
02:31:15,831 --> 02:31:17,000
you're going to have a million messages.

5759
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:17,920
You don't have time to,

5760
02:31:18,010 --> 02:31:19,100
you got to get in your car.

5761
02:31:19,230 --> 02:31:23,010
This is one of the few times
that I guarantee that I'm
not going to communicate

5762
02:31:23,011 --> 02:31:24,030
with anybody any other way.

5763
02:31:24,490 --> 02:31:26,490
So one of the few times
like doing a podcast,

5764
02:31:26,590 --> 02:31:26,761
this,

5765
02:31:26,761 --> 02:31:29,820
one of the cool things about
these kinds of conversations,

5766
02:31:29,970 --> 02:31:32,310
like this is the only way
we have these conversations.

5767
02:31:32,590 --> 02:31:33,900
Like even if we eat dinner,

5768
02:31:33,930 --> 02:31:35,460
we don't have these kind of conversations.

5769
02:31:35,710 --> 02:31:36,970
You acted as distracted,

5770
02:31:36,980 --> 02:31:38,310
you checking your phone,

5771
02:31:38,330 --> 02:31:39,030
got to take.

5772
02:31:39,030 --> 02:31:40,170
This is a lot of shit going on.

5773
02:31:40,440 --> 02:31:44,100
Like the art of conversation
is lost a lot of people.

5774
02:31:44,190 --> 02:31:47,280
And one of the ways we practice
it is by doing these podcasts.

5775
02:31:47,281 --> 02:31:47,460
Yeah.

5776
02:31:47,460 --> 02:31:50,790
This is like a real hangout
on your phones are off.

5777
02:31:50,820 --> 02:31:51,540
Yes.

5778
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:53,450
Have you had anyone come
in and try to keep on,

5779
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:54,211
stay on their phone?

5780
02:31:54,211 --> 02:31:54,840
Yes.

5781
02:31:54,840 --> 02:31:55,531
Get the fuck.

5782
02:31:55,531 --> 02:31:57,240
Russell Peters cannot
leave his phone alone.

5783
02:31:57,340 --> 02:31:59,310
I can't be on the show that he
cannot leave his phone alone.

5784
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:00,871
Those like,

5785
02:32:00,871 --> 02:32:01,150
yeah.

5786
02:32:01,150 --> 02:32:01,983
Yeah.

5787
02:32:02,580 --> 02:32:03,001
So,

5788
02:32:03,001 --> 02:32:03,631
uh,

5789
02:32:03,631 --> 02:32:05,940
I was gonna hold on.

5790
02:32:06,450 --> 02:32:07,440
I go Russel,

5791
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:08,593
go Russel.

5792
02:32:08,790 --> 02:32:09,630
Everybody's here.

5793
02:32:09,790 --> 02:32:10,430
We're right here.

5794
02:32:10,430 --> 02:32:12,100
The million people are listening a bit.

5795
02:32:12,101 --> 02:32:12,390
It is,

5796
02:32:12,390 --> 02:32:12,841
you know what?

5797
02:32:12,841 --> 02:32:13,440
It's a bummer.

5798
02:32:13,440 --> 02:32:14,273
Everyone's got,

5799
02:32:14,550 --> 02:32:17,700
everyone's got a phone and everyone's
got a lot of work to do on the God damn

5800
02:32:17,701 --> 02:32:18,120
phone.

5801
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:20,940
It's nice to be able to hang out
with somebody and you're like,

5802
02:32:20,941 --> 02:32:23,610
let's just get on our phones together and
we'll talk every now and then and I'll

5803
02:32:23,611 --> 02:32:26,610
show you a video and we're cool
and we're not offending anybody.

5804
02:32:26,910 --> 02:32:28,230
Everyone's just on your phone.

5805
02:32:28,680 --> 02:32:29,760
There's nothing wrong with that.

5806
02:32:29,790 --> 02:32:30,623
Nothing wrong with that.

5807
02:32:31,590 --> 02:32:31,980
And then,

5808
02:32:31,980 --> 02:32:32,521
you know what I mean?

5809
02:32:32,521 --> 02:32:33,354
It's like we got,

5810
02:32:33,590 --> 02:32:34,800
I want to hang out with you,

5811
02:32:34,890 --> 02:32:37,680
but I got to do business and we could
talk when there's something to talk about

5812
02:32:37,681 --> 02:32:38,071
for sure.

5813
02:32:38,071 --> 02:32:39,720
I got to handle some shit for sure.

5814
02:32:39,721 --> 02:32:42,230
Don't you notice from
doing a lot of podcasts,

5815
02:32:42,330 --> 02:32:44,670
I would like if you have
conversations with some people,

5816
02:32:44,671 --> 02:32:46,650
some people that are just
not really listening to you,

5817
02:32:46,980 --> 02:32:47,880
not in podcasts,

5818
02:32:47,881 --> 02:32:48,714
but in the real world,

5819
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:50,640
like you get good at this.

5820
02:32:50,641 --> 02:32:50,970
Like you,

5821
02:32:50,970 --> 02:32:51,990
you do podcasts a lot,

5822
02:32:51,991 --> 02:32:53,490
so you're really good
at having conversations.

5823
02:32:53,910 --> 02:32:56,490
But when you go out in the real world
and have conversations with people,

5824
02:32:56,491 --> 02:32:58,290
there's motherfuckers are
just aren't listening.

5825
02:32:58,530 --> 02:33:00,510
They're just talking the tracking at you.

5826
02:33:00,930 --> 02:33:02,580
They're not even responding
to what you're saying.

5827
02:33:02,760 --> 02:33:05,310
There's thinking about what they
want to get done and their agenda.

5828
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:06,173
They're in a different,

5829
02:33:06,330 --> 02:33:07,590
in a text,

5830
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:10,230
they're like texting someone else and in
some serious business and they're like,

5831
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:10,531
no,

5832
02:33:10,531 --> 02:33:10,710
no.

5833
02:33:10,710 --> 02:33:13,320
I mean when you're having a conversation
with someone and they're not even like

5834
02:33:13,350 --> 02:33:14,460
tuned in to what you're saying.

5835
02:33:14,610 --> 02:33:16,530
Like there's a lot of people
that are just bad at talking.

5836
02:33:16,531 --> 02:33:17,000
Yeah.

5837
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:19,790
That communicators and those
people are bad at podcast.

5838
02:33:19,791 --> 02:33:22,320
Every now and then I'll get one of those
people on a podcast and you're like,

5839
02:33:22,470 --> 02:33:23,670
are you even here with me?

5840
02:33:24,330 --> 02:33:26,250
You will listen to me like it's work.

5841
02:33:26,340 --> 02:33:26,590
Yeah,

5842
02:33:26,590 --> 02:33:27,050
it's work.

5843
02:33:27,050 --> 02:33:30,330
Cause you're constant trying to come up
constantly and you trying to like bring

5844
02:33:30,331 --> 02:33:30,820
them in.

5845
02:33:30,820 --> 02:33:32,460
So we're trying to get them to hook on.

5846
02:33:32,470 --> 02:33:33,220
Exactly.

5847
02:33:33,220 --> 02:33:34,520
Trying to get them to go to the store,

5848
02:33:34,560 --> 02:33:35,161
connect with me.

5849
02:33:35,161 --> 02:33:35,851
Please come there.

5850
02:33:35,851 --> 02:33:36,510
Come back.

5851
02:33:36,510 --> 02:33:37,343
Oh,

5852
02:33:38,450 --> 02:33:39,211
that a bummer.

5853
02:33:39,211 --> 02:33:39,451
To lose.

5854
02:33:39,451 --> 02:33:41,280
The audience feels it cause they're like,

5855
02:33:41,281 --> 02:33:41,371
oh,

5856
02:33:41,371 --> 02:33:42,780
this guy sucks dude.

5857
02:33:42,781 --> 02:33:43,130
Yeah.

5858
02:33:43,130 --> 02:33:43,330
I've,

5859
02:33:43,330 --> 02:33:45,310
I've talked to people
after I had someone on,

5860
02:33:45,320 --> 02:33:45,481
they go,

5861
02:33:45,481 --> 02:33:46,980
hey that guy something was off,

5862
02:33:46,981 --> 02:33:47,221
right?

5863
02:33:47,221 --> 02:33:47,301
Yeah.

5864
02:33:47,301 --> 02:33:47,640
Yeah.

5865
02:33:47,640 --> 02:33:48,341
It was a little off.

5866
02:33:48,341 --> 02:33:48,840
It wasn't,

5867
02:33:48,840 --> 02:33:49,051
he's like,

5868
02:33:49,051 --> 02:33:50,640
he seemed like he was on
some drugs or something.

5869
02:33:50,641 --> 02:33:54,180
Like that's another thing I'm finding
it's how many fucking people are on speed.

5870
02:33:54,450 --> 02:33:55,283
So

5871
02:33:56,380 --> 02:33:57,213
Adderall,

5872
02:33:57,610 --> 02:33:58,443
Adderall.

5873
02:33:58,550 --> 02:34:03,330
Well that's not technically 100%
crystal meth until Pharaoh is meth.

5874
02:34:03,720 --> 02:34:04,360
It really is.

5875
02:34:04,360 --> 02:34:05,430
Like does the same thing.

5876
02:34:05,431 --> 02:34:05,581
No,

5877
02:34:05,581 --> 02:34:06,570
it does the same thing,

5878
02:34:06,840 --> 02:34:08,220
but when you're on Adderall you're like,

5879
02:34:08,221 --> 02:34:08,941
you've got a prescription.

5880
02:34:08,941 --> 02:34:09,774
You don't feel like you're,

5881
02:34:09,960 --> 02:34:11,220
you don't feel like you're a meth head.

5882
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:12,150
There's a difference between,

5883
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:12,840
you know what I mean?

5884
02:34:12,840 --> 02:34:13,201
Oh yeah.

5885
02:34:13,201 --> 02:34:14,220
This difference between the,

5886
02:34:14,350 --> 02:34:16,950
that are all still have their teeth for a,

5887
02:34:17,230 --> 02:34:18,063
not all of them

5888
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:21,340
before we started the show,

5889
02:34:21,341 --> 02:34:22,180
this is the same guy.

5890
02:34:22,181 --> 02:34:23,860
Tommy caffeine is bad for you.

5891
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:24,821
You told me caffeine,

5892
02:34:24,821 --> 02:34:25,181
same thing.

5893
02:34:25,181 --> 02:34:25,750
His coat.

5894
02:34:25,750 --> 02:34:26,583
Well,

5895
02:34:26,680 --> 02:34:29,500
caffeine is a cousin of coke.

5896
02:34:29,970 --> 02:34:31,600
While they're in the same caffeine.

5897
02:34:31,630 --> 02:34:32,470
They're in the same,

5898
02:34:33,100 --> 02:34:33,540
unless,

5899
02:34:33,540 --> 02:34:35,050
I mean this was mainstream information,

5900
02:34:35,051 --> 02:34:36,110
so maybe it a stimulant,

5901
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:38,253
but it's real.

5902
02:34:38,260 --> 02:34:39,093
It's like,

5903
02:34:39,100 --> 02:34:40,540
cause they used to put
coke and Coke a cola,

5904
02:34:40,541 --> 02:34:40,900
right?

5905
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:41,300
Then they go,

5906
02:34:41,300 --> 02:34:44,560
well they still use coca
leaves to make the flavor of,

5907
02:34:44,590 --> 02:34:45,820
do you know that cocaine,

5908
02:34:46,690 --> 02:34:51,040
like the number one provider of
medical cocaine is Coca Cola.

5909
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,390
Do you know how this works?

5910
02:34:52,570 --> 02:34:54,850
Coca Cola [inaudible] coca leaves,

5911
02:34:54,970 --> 02:34:57,460
they have like cocoa leaves
that you would get cocaine from.

5912
02:34:57,610 --> 02:34:58,450
That's the flavor.

5913
02:34:58,451 --> 02:35:00,340
It's secret to the flavor of Coca Cola.

5914
02:35:00,370 --> 02:35:02,750
Shit's delicious flavor soda.

5915
02:35:02,760 --> 02:35:04,480
It's just better than tap coca cola.

5916
02:35:04,481 --> 02:35:04,740
Forget.

5917
02:35:04,740 --> 02:35:08,350
It's just better than Pepsi
in the can forget that.

5918
02:35:08,380 --> 02:35:11,520
It's just a matter [inaudible] I love it.

5919
02:35:11,521 --> 02:35:12,850
He hit the Mexican sugar.

5920
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:15,310
I love that shit.

5921
02:35:15,370 --> 02:35:18,040
But the way they make
it is with cocoa leaves,

5922
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:21,250
they extract the cocaine from the cocoa
leaves and the company that extracts the

5923
02:35:21,251 --> 02:35:22,420
cocaine from those cocoa leaves.

5924
02:35:22,570 --> 02:35:27,040
They sell it to like they use it as
medical cocaine Escobar enterprises.

5925
02:35:27,080 --> 02:35:28,180
It's fucking crazy,

5926
02:35:28,181 --> 02:35:28,510
man.

5927
02:35:28,510 --> 02:35:29,130
It's crazy.

5928
02:35:29,130 --> 02:35:30,400
Let's say medical cocaine,

5929
02:35:30,401 --> 02:35:31,181
medical cocaine.

5930
02:35:31,181 --> 02:35:31,511
Damn.

5931
02:35:31,511 --> 02:35:32,650
When are they going to legalize that?

5932
02:35:32,740 --> 02:35:32,940
Well,

5933
02:35:32,940 --> 02:35:33,773
medicare,

5934
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:36,340
they use for surgeries and shit.

5935
02:35:36,410 --> 02:35:37,990
Why do medical cocaine?

5936
02:35:37,991 --> 02:35:40,060
You can ignore things
down numbs things like,

5937
02:35:40,061 --> 02:35:41,530
like locally without like,

5938
02:35:41,560 --> 02:35:41,840
you know,

5939
02:35:41,840 --> 02:35:44,440
instead of like Novacane
Novacane by the way,

5940
02:35:44,441 --> 02:35:45,670
related to cocaine,

5941
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:47,530
Lidocaine,

5942
02:35:47,530 --> 02:35:47,531
Lidocaine.

5943
02:35:47,531 --> 02:35:49,330
I had that shit when I had my nose fixed.

5944
02:35:49,630 --> 02:35:50,650
They put the Lidacain in.

5945
02:35:50,650 --> 02:35:53,800
How many doctors are taking
this medical cocaine and and,

5946
02:35:53,801 --> 02:35:55,420
and doing crazy things with it.

5947
02:35:55,480 --> 02:35:57,030
Do you remember Joel Wallach?

5948
02:35:57,460 --> 02:35:58,800
Dead doctors don't lie.

5949
02:35:58,820 --> 02:35:59,830
You turned me onto that.

5950
02:36:00,100 --> 02:36:00,791
You turned me on to that.

5951
02:36:00,791 --> 02:36:01,900
But it was a coke head.

5952
02:36:01,960 --> 02:36:02,351
No,

5953
02:36:02,351 --> 02:36:04,090
he was a doctor who was into minerals.

5954
02:36:04,160 --> 02:36:05,740
He's talking to you about how,

5955
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:10,000
it's weird that people
who are veterinarians know
that if you have livestock,

5956
02:36:10,210 --> 02:36:12,760
you have to supplement the
minerals and the livestock.

5957
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:15,700
But people don't think about
mineral deficiencies in food.

5958
02:36:15,850 --> 02:36:18,190
When you talk about people
that have a regular diet,

5959
02:36:18,370 --> 02:36:21,280
especially when they don't have
a vegetable rich diet there with,

5960
02:36:21,281 --> 02:36:22,330
with animals,

5961
02:36:22,390 --> 02:36:23,320
with livestock,

5962
02:36:23,560 --> 02:36:24,730
you don't have a health insurance.

5963
02:36:24,731 --> 02:36:25,540
So you got to,

5964
02:36:25,540 --> 02:36:26,081
they know.

5965
02:36:26,081 --> 02:36:26,780
Farmers know.

5966
02:36:26,780 --> 02:36:27,110
Yeah,

5967
02:36:27,110 --> 02:36:28,300
give him these minerals.

5968
02:36:28,450 --> 02:36:30,160
Otherwise your livestock's
going to be shit.

5969
02:36:30,610 --> 02:36:32,080
So there's no,

5970
02:36:32,200 --> 02:36:33,580
but when it comes to humans,

5971
02:36:33,581 --> 02:36:34,600
we don't look at it the same way,

5972
02:36:34,810 --> 02:36:37,570
but you know a lot of people do.

5973
02:36:37,570 --> 02:36:40,030
They understand the
importance of more minerals.

5974
02:36:40,031 --> 02:36:41,290
Now with Joel Wallach,

5975
02:36:41,291 --> 02:36:43,750
one of the things he was talking about
and is how we put all our faith in

5976
02:36:43,751 --> 02:36:45,400
doctors when it comes to like health,

5977
02:36:45,550 --> 02:36:49,960
but how little education doctors actually
have a nutrition and then how many

5978
02:36:49,961 --> 02:36:51,550
doctors are doing drugs?

5979
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:54,680
How many doctors are like tons?

5980
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:56,410
I know free pills.

5981
02:36:56,530 --> 02:36:57,310
What are they doing?

5982
02:36:57,310 --> 02:36:58,630
Access to all that.

5983
02:36:58,631 --> 02:36:59,750
You don't think shit.

5984
02:37:00,170 --> 02:37:00,701
You know what?

5985
02:37:00,701 --> 02:37:01,211
What are they doing?

5986
02:37:01,211 --> 02:37:02,044
What's going on?

5987
02:37:02,730 --> 02:37:03,790
The ones that you've heard of,

5988
02:37:03,850 --> 02:37:06,040
the ledger ones that I've
heard of them hung out with.

5989
02:37:06,041 --> 02:37:06,560
I mean they,

5990
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:07,271
they party hard.

5991
02:37:07,271 --> 02:37:08,950
Men that have access to a lot of stuff.

5992
02:37:09,130 --> 02:37:10,240
They make a lot of money.

5993
02:37:10,290 --> 02:37:11,590
You know the party hard.

5994
02:37:12,220 --> 02:37:13,053
The people cope.

5995
02:37:13,210 --> 02:37:16,280
Smart Coke goddamn cocaine

5996
02:37:16,730 --> 02:37:17,610
are totally dope.

5997
02:37:17,620 --> 02:37:17,910
Dope,

5998
02:37:17,910 --> 02:37:18,151
dope,

5999
02:37:18,151 --> 02:37:18,370
dope,

6000
02:37:18,370 --> 02:37:19,110
dope,

6001
02:37:19,110 --> 02:37:19,360
dope,

6002
02:37:19,360 --> 02:37:19,601
dope,

6003
02:37:19,601 --> 02:37:19,910
dope,

6004
02:37:19,910 --> 02:37:20,720
dope dope.

6005
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:23,330
What does that Adderall and Fed Amin,

6006
02:37:23,510 --> 02:37:24,680
amphetamine aspartate.

6007
02:37:24,681 --> 02:37:24,861
Yeah,

6008
02:37:24,861 --> 02:37:25,430
it's functional.

6009
02:37:25,430 --> 02:37:26,820
You're saying you've had people,

6010
02:37:26,840 --> 02:37:30,560
you were saying people that
come on hundred percent on
it had a bunch of people

6011
02:37:30,561 --> 02:37:33,770
that I've asked just flat out
ask because they're just going,

6012
02:37:34,060 --> 02:37:34,350
yeah,

6013
02:37:34,350 --> 02:37:34,910
they take their,

6014
02:37:34,910 --> 02:37:37,030
so they talk so fast and
there's so much going on.

6015
02:37:37,050 --> 02:37:38,750
Like there's no way
this guy's an on speed.

6016
02:37:39,020 --> 02:37:41,600
And then it will come out later in the
conversation that they're on Adderall,

6017
02:37:42,350 --> 02:37:43,310
that they take Adderall,

6018
02:37:43,311 --> 02:37:43,971
they have prescription.

6019
02:37:43,971 --> 02:37:44,360
They always like,

6020
02:37:44,360 --> 02:37:44,511
well,

6021
02:37:44,511 --> 02:37:45,344
I have add.

6022
02:37:45,510 --> 02:37:46,131
Oh,

6023
02:37:46,131 --> 02:37:48,340
is that add I've got add to motherfucker.

6024
02:37:48,350 --> 02:37:49,520
I can go get a prescription.

6025
02:37:49,521 --> 02:37:49,820
Yeah.

6026
02:37:49,820 --> 02:37:50,001
I mean,

6027
02:37:50,001 --> 02:37:50,301
what does it,

6028
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:51,290
have you ever taken Adderall?

6029
02:37:51,380 --> 02:37:51,770
No,

6030
02:37:51,770 --> 02:37:53,470
I took it and didn't shut the fuck up,

6031
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:55,910
but I couldn't focus on anything.

6032
02:37:56,030 --> 02:37:56,721
I took it in college,

6033
02:37:56,721 --> 02:37:58,180
write a paper and sewing.

6034
02:37:58,190 --> 02:37:59,030
Come in by k.

6035
02:37:59,031 --> 02:37:59,840
How's the pizza?

6036
02:37:59,840 --> 02:38:01,700
Had gone a fucking rant about pizza.

6037
02:38:02,120 --> 02:38:03,140
We got nothing done.

6038
02:38:03,320 --> 02:38:04,153
Nothing done.

6039
02:38:04,310 --> 02:38:05,150
That's like speed.

6040
02:38:06,350 --> 02:38:07,910
Speed is supposed to
be good for organizing.

6041
02:38:07,911 --> 02:38:08,240
You know,

6042
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:09,200
growing up I was

6043
02:38:10,920 --> 02:38:11,753
in Sweden,

6044
02:38:12,260 --> 02:38:13,070
uh,

6045
02:38:13,070 --> 02:38:13,903
you lose your teeth.

6046
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:14,571
Well,

6047
02:38:14,571 --> 02:38:15,381
it's not just that,

6048
02:38:15,381 --> 02:38:16,191
I think your heart,

6049
02:38:16,191 --> 02:38:17,540
it's just like overworked.

6050
02:38:17,541 --> 02:38:18,230
Too many beats.

6051
02:38:18,230 --> 02:38:19,430
I think it freaks you out.

6052
02:38:20,540 --> 02:38:22,610
Fast pounding or uneven heartbeats.

6053
02:38:22,611 --> 02:38:24,500
Pain or burning when you urinate,

6054
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:25,761
that's banging.

6055
02:38:25,761 --> 02:38:26,900
Chicks that are on speed,

6056
02:38:27,400 --> 02:38:27,650
uh,

6057
02:38:27,650 --> 02:38:29,030
taken more than usual.

6058
02:38:29,031 --> 02:38:31,550
Feelings of extreme happiness or sadness,

6059
02:38:31,940 --> 02:38:32,720
tremors,

6060
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:34,010
hallucinations,

6061
02:38:34,011 --> 02:38:36,020
unusual behavior or motor tics.

6062
02:38:36,080 --> 02:38:36,913
Big,

6063
02:38:36,920 --> 02:38:38,390
dangerously high blood,

6064
02:38:39,110 --> 02:38:39,531
high blood.

6065
02:38:39,531 --> 02:38:41,840
What not terrible.

6066
02:38:41,841 --> 02:38:42,501
Let's be real.

6067
02:38:42,501 --> 02:38:43,430
Not Awful.

6068
02:38:43,460 --> 02:38:48,350
Well see there is a lot of people that
are on this stuff on a daily basis.

6069
02:38:48,740 --> 02:38:49,980
Dangerously high blood pressure,

6070
02:38:49,981 --> 02:38:50,661
severe headache,

6071
02:38:50,661 --> 02:38:51,441
buzzing in your ears,

6072
02:38:51,441 --> 02:38:52,274
anxiety.

6073
02:38:54,500 --> 02:38:57,460
There's a lot of people that
are on this a lot like theirs.

6074
02:38:57,660 --> 02:38:57,930
Okay.

6075
02:38:57,930 --> 02:38:58,660
And the entertainment.

6076
02:38:58,660 --> 02:38:59,180
Let's take it,

6077
02:38:59,180 --> 02:38:59,961
not just entertainment.

6078
02:38:59,961 --> 02:39:00,531
Journalism.

6079
02:39:00,531 --> 02:39:01,460
Journalism is a big one.

6080
02:39:01,461 --> 02:39:02,630
This guy who was in here,

6081
02:39:02,660 --> 02:39:06,950
who's a professor actually told me that
he knows so many fucking journalist and

6082
02:39:06,951 --> 02:39:09,020
then I started asking journalists
and they confirmed it with me.

6083
02:39:09,021 --> 02:39:09,200
Like,

6084
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:09,440
yeah,

6085
02:39:09,440 --> 02:39:10,273
everybody's on it.

6086
02:39:10,520 --> 02:39:10,910
And I go,

6087
02:39:10,910 --> 02:39:11,571
everybody who was,

6088
02:39:11,571 --> 02:39:14,270
everybody I know that's a successful
journalist has taken Adderall.

6089
02:39:14,540 --> 02:39:14,841
I go,

6090
02:39:14,841 --> 02:39:15,530
why?

6091
02:39:15,530 --> 02:39:15,771
He goes,

6092
02:39:15,771 --> 02:39:16,640
he's got deadlines.

6093
02:39:16,641 --> 02:39:17,151
You can work.

6094
02:39:17,151 --> 02:39:17,821
You don't get tired,

6095
02:39:17,821 --> 02:39:18,471
you get things done,

6096
02:39:18,471 --> 02:39:19,304
you focus.

6097
02:39:19,370 --> 02:39:19,581
He goes,

6098
02:39:19,581 --> 02:39:20,900
you got like laser beam focus.

6099
02:39:20,920 --> 02:39:21,231
And I go,

6100
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:22,390
how many of them were abusing it?

6101
02:39:22,391 --> 02:39:22,610
And he goes,

6102
02:39:22,610 --> 02:39:23,480
they're all abusing it.

6103
02:39:24,590 --> 02:39:25,423
Damn.

6104
02:39:25,580 --> 02:39:27,380
It's like steroids for writing Gat.

6105
02:39:27,381 --> 02:39:27,680
Right.

6106
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:28,670
PD for writing.

6107
02:39:28,790 --> 02:39:29,720
So let me ask you this.

6108
02:39:30,440 --> 02:39:31,340
If you had to guess,

6109
02:39:31,430 --> 02:39:34,880
what's the number of prescriptions every
year for Adderall in the United States?

6110
02:39:35,180 --> 02:39:36,830
Let's guess we'll say that again.

6111
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:39,890
The number of prescriptions every year
for Adderall in the United States has to

6112
02:39:39,891 --> 02:39:41,870
know me to say 5 million.

6113
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:44,240
I'm going with 30 million.

6114
02:39:44,340 --> 02:39:46,700
30 I was going to 20 to 30 million.

6115
02:39:46,750 --> 02:39:47,583
Yeah.

6116
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:50,210
How many right now,

6117
02:39:50,270 --> 02:39:51,360
how many people are on Adderall?

6118
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:52,790
See they don't do it that way.

6119
02:39:52,791 --> 02:39:52,901
They,

6120
02:39:52,901 --> 02:39:54,620
they write prescriptions written.

6121
02:39:54,770 --> 02:39:57,140
So like say if you see three months worth,

6122
02:39:57,560 --> 02:39:59,960
you might use it four times in a year.

6123
02:39:59,961 --> 02:40:01,040
So you would be for,

6124
02:40:01,270 --> 02:40:02,103
right.

6125
02:40:02,120 --> 02:40:02,780
So let's find out.

6126
02:40:02,780 --> 02:40:04,910
I'm saying 30 I'm going to go,

6127
02:40:04,911 --> 02:40:06,990
I'm going to go 2020
let's say a little lower.

6128
02:40:07,250 --> 02:40:08,300
Five when no one,

6129
02:40:08,301 --> 02:40:09,770
when I said you still gonna go with five.

6130
02:40:09,980 --> 02:40:10,960
Five Eddie,

6131
02:40:11,080 --> 02:40:13,230
come on turn 10 which peer pressure,

6132
02:40:13,231 --> 02:40:13,431
Bro,

6133
02:40:13,431 --> 02:40:14,264
don't give him.

6134
02:40:14,470 --> 02:40:15,303
Stick with five.

6135
02:40:15,550 --> 02:40:16,430
Stick with five.

6136
02:40:17,800 --> 02:40:18,511
What'd we got best?

6137
02:40:18,511 --> 02:40:22,860
I could find is from 2012 and it says
roughly 16 million aderol prescriptions

6138
02:40:22,861 --> 02:40:27,861
are written for adults between 20 and
39 well that's not good for 2012 five

6139
02:40:29,281 --> 02:40:30,114
years ago.

6140
02:40:30,140 --> 02:40:31,440
It doesn't include kids.

6141
02:40:31,920 --> 02:40:34,940
A lot of kids took it in school and
then in the college and are now those

6142
02:40:34,980 --> 02:40:39,000
probably reporters today
it's about 25 years ago.

6143
02:40:39,001 --> 02:40:39,990
Those kids are 20 now,

6144
02:40:40,020 --> 02:40:40,550
right?

6145
02:40:40,550 --> 02:40:42,600
It could be 15 now they're 20 yeah,

6146
02:40:42,630 --> 02:40:43,081
well they were,

6147
02:40:43,081 --> 02:40:43,270
yeah.

6148
02:40:43,270 --> 02:40:44,880
This is only started with age 20 or so.

6149
02:40:44,881 --> 02:40:48,360
Kids that were in high school
were 16 1718 up to statistics.

6150
02:40:48,361 --> 02:40:52,080
I just tried to type in 2016 and this
is an article from 2016 use in these

6151
02:40:52,170 --> 02:40:52,591
stats.

6152
02:40:52,591 --> 02:40:53,670
So interesting.

6153
02:40:54,540 --> 02:40:55,440
Very interesting.

6154
02:40:56,070 --> 02:40:56,550
It's just,

6155
02:40:56,550 --> 02:40:58,200
it's crazy cause it is speed.

6156
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:00,000
You can get it prescribed to you.

6157
02:41:00,001 --> 02:41:00,870
All you have to do is say,

6158
02:41:00,871 --> 02:41:04,530
oh just can't focus tired all the
time and just don't know what to do.

6159
02:41:04,920 --> 02:41:05,490
Okay.

6160
02:41:05,490 --> 02:41:09,690
They just write your speed when it help
you in writing to really everything.

6161
02:41:09,720 --> 02:41:14,120
Maybe some people say it doesn't help
you creatively because you're so like

6162
02:41:16,090 --> 02:41:16,361
that.

6163
02:41:16,361 --> 02:41:18,510
It's better for like organizing things,

6164
02:41:19,060 --> 02:41:20,320
moving out loads together,

6165
02:41:20,530 --> 02:41:22,720
painting your house like the late great.

6166
02:41:22,810 --> 02:41:23,740
Robert Schimmel.

6167
02:41:23,770 --> 02:41:25,810
Do you know Robert Sherman
was standup comedian?

6168
02:41:26,650 --> 02:41:27,820
Hilarious dear friend.

6169
02:41:27,850 --> 02:41:28,510
Great Guy,

6170
02:41:28,510 --> 02:41:29,770
died a few years back.

6171
02:41:30,580 --> 02:41:31,670
He acts densely,

6172
02:41:31,690 --> 02:41:32,590
took Adderall.

6173
02:41:32,920 --> 02:41:33,480
He uh,

6174
02:41:33,480 --> 02:41:34,271
was he thought it was,

6175
02:41:34,271 --> 02:41:36,780
he had it actually had
a heart attack and um,

6176
02:41:37,230 --> 02:41:39,880
he went to try to thought he
was taking his heart medication.

6177
02:41:39,881 --> 02:41:44,830
He took the wrong shit and it took
someone else's Adderall because doctor and

6178
02:41:44,831 --> 02:41:45,310
he's like,

6179
02:41:45,310 --> 02:41:45,701
ah,

6180
02:41:45,701 --> 02:41:46,420
what do I do?

6181
02:41:46,420 --> 02:41:46,691
He goes,

6182
02:41:46,691 --> 02:41:47,530
how much did you take?

6183
02:41:47,560 --> 02:41:48,520
And it looks at the bottle,

6184
02:41:48,521 --> 02:41:49,211
tells him the dosage.

6185
02:41:49,211 --> 02:41:49,390
He goes,

6186
02:41:49,390 --> 02:41:50,223
going to be fine.

6187
02:41:50,470 --> 02:41:50,771
He goes,

6188
02:41:50,771 --> 02:41:51,280
you just,

6189
02:41:51,280 --> 02:41:54,280
you're just going to be up for a while
and you're going to be very speedy.

6190
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:55,450
And so he just said,

6191
02:41:55,480 --> 02:41:56,830
I just organize my notes.

6192
02:41:56,980 --> 02:41:57,281
He said,

6193
02:41:57,281 --> 02:42:00,520
I just got in front of my computer
and I couldn't stop organizing,

6194
02:42:00,910 --> 02:42:04,240
just going over my notes and just
pulling out pages after pages and writing

6195
02:42:04,241 --> 02:42:04,870
things down.

6196
02:42:04,870 --> 02:42:05,380
He says,

6197
02:42:05,380 --> 02:42:05,640
he said,

6198
02:42:05,640 --> 02:42:07,000
I've never been more focused in my life.

6199
02:42:07,240 --> 02:42:07,511
Here's what,

6200
02:42:07,511 --> 02:42:08,470
I'm scared to try it again.

6201
02:42:09,130 --> 02:42:10,620
I wonder what it's like working out on it.

6202
02:42:11,110 --> 02:42:12,220
A lot of people working out on it.

6203
02:42:12,730 --> 02:42:15,790
We had a lady in here recently who
said she works out on it since she gets

6204
02:42:15,791 --> 02:42:16,141
pumped,

6205
02:42:16,141 --> 02:42:16,301
right,

6206
02:42:16,301 --> 02:42:17,170
goes nuts.

6207
02:42:19,430 --> 02:42:20,263
When I was nine,

6208
02:42:20,350 --> 02:42:25,180
when I was 19 that was this 23 year old
heavy metal Chicco had some speed and

6209
02:42:25,210 --> 02:42:28,750
she was hot at the time and uh,

6210
02:42:28,810 --> 02:42:33,810
we did a little bit and my Dick
was so god damn small and she was,

6211
02:42:35,950 --> 02:42:39,490
she was determined to blow it up.

6212
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:43,661
I kept saying,

6213
02:42:43,661 --> 02:42:44,141
I'm sorry,

6214
02:42:44,141 --> 02:42:44,681
it won't work.

6215
02:42:44,681 --> 02:42:45,311
It doesn't work.

6216
02:42:45,311 --> 02:42:46,330
It doesn't work because of speaking.

6217
02:42:46,370 --> 02:42:46,960
She goes,

6218
02:42:46,960 --> 02:42:47,793
don't worry.

6219
02:42:48,160 --> 02:42:49,180
I got all day.

6220
02:42:49,181 --> 02:42:49,840
And she was,

6221
02:42:49,840 --> 02:42:53,610
she just went on forever and
she did eventually resurrected.

6222
02:42:53,611 --> 02:42:55,450
God blesses was wicked.

6223
02:42:55,480 --> 02:42:57,130
That's the fucking speed.

6224
02:42:57,131 --> 02:42:58,960
Made her suck on nick all day long.

6225
02:43:02,500 --> 02:43:03,281
She going to give up.

6226
02:43:03,281 --> 02:43:04,114
No.

6227
02:43:04,350 --> 02:43:05,680
Imagine how long it would take.

6228
02:43:05,990 --> 02:43:07,840
I imagine when you do,

6229
02:43:07,960 --> 02:43:10,060
I can only imagine you
had big does not work.

6230
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:11,283
It just,

6231
02:43:12,180 --> 02:43:12,390
just,

6232
02:43:12,390 --> 02:43:13,223
sure.

6233
02:43:13,480 --> 02:43:14,050
Yeah.

6234
02:43:14,050 --> 02:43:14,883
Whoa.

6235
02:43:15,850 --> 02:43:16,870
I was not good man.

6236
02:43:16,871 --> 02:43:17,920
I don't fuck this terrible.

6237
02:43:17,990 --> 02:43:19,720
I don't recommend it to anybody.

6238
02:43:19,721 --> 02:43:20,351
It was terrible.

6239
02:43:20,351 --> 02:43:20,891
I was young,

6240
02:43:20,891 --> 02:43:21,724
I was 19,

6241
02:43:21,940 --> 02:43:22,773
she was hot.

6242
02:43:23,020 --> 02:43:25,540
A lot of pool players used to take speed.

6243
02:43:26,650 --> 02:43:27,790
They said it helped their game.

6244
02:43:28,120 --> 02:43:32,680
I did take a bunch of different kinds
of speed to focus on the ball Jan make

6245
02:43:32,681 --> 02:43:33,630
there cause you know,

6246
02:43:33,670 --> 02:43:34,960
pools a very like,

6247
02:43:34,961 --> 02:43:39,770
it's a lot of intense focus and like tiny
adjustments you're making and you got

6248
02:43:39,771 --> 02:43:43,060
to really like really concentrate on
the angles and what you're trying to

6249
02:43:43,061 --> 02:43:43,571
accomplish.

6250
02:43:43,571 --> 02:43:45,880
It's a very mentally taxing
game and you're gambling.

6251
02:43:46,270 --> 02:43:46,991
So a lot of these guys,

6252
02:43:46,991 --> 02:43:47,980
they gamble for like 10,

6253
02:43:47,981 --> 02:43:48,910
12 hours sessions.

6254
02:43:48,911 --> 02:43:50,770
Here's a question for
your golden snitch friend.

6255
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:52,990
If I have a prescription for Adderall,

6256
02:43:53,010 --> 02:43:55,880
can I fight in UFC one
up if I've crazy upset.

6257
02:43:55,990 --> 02:43:56,741
Tracy crazy.

6258
02:43:56,741 --> 02:43:57,574
Tim Crater,

6259
02:43:57,820 --> 02:43:58,110
uh,

6260
02:43:58,110 --> 02:44:01,420
actually got pulled from a card because
he had a real deficit and he was on

6261
02:44:01,421 --> 02:44:02,020
Adderall.

6262
02:44:02,020 --> 02:44:03,880
They pull them from a car
to way back in the day.

6263
02:44:04,270 --> 02:44:08,530
This was like ultimate fighter
days when he was off the,

6264
02:44:08,570 --> 02:44:08,720
when,

6265
02:44:08,720 --> 02:44:09,990
when it was the wild west.

6266
02:44:10,930 --> 02:44:11,141
Yeah,

6267
02:44:11,141 --> 02:44:11,974
exactly.

6268
02:44:12,520 --> 02:44:13,091
Adderall.

6269
02:44:13,091 --> 02:44:15,390
The new drug of choice
of many major leaguers.

6270
02:44:15,420 --> 02:44:15,760
Wow.

6271
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,680
Meaning baseball though.

6272
02:44:16,690 --> 02:44:17,160
Now one,

6273
02:44:17,160 --> 02:44:17,381
look,

6274
02:44:17,381 --> 02:44:17,831
this is,

6275
02:44:17,831 --> 02:44:18,581
this is football.

6276
02:44:18,581 --> 02:44:19,414
You're saying

6277
02:44:20,710 --> 02:44:21,543
the,

6278
02:44:21,800 --> 02:44:22,320
okay,

6279
02:44:22,320 --> 02:44:24,620
baseball I've always heard they
fuck with that are all non star,

6280
02:44:24,621 --> 02:44:29,200
all his legal and easily obtainable but
also dangerous if abuse use in major

6281
02:44:29,201 --> 02:44:33,050
league has reached absurd
level baseball employee.

6282
02:44:33,090 --> 02:44:33,700
Sir.

6283
02:44:33,700 --> 02:44:35,380
Dangerous have used but yeah,

6284
02:44:35,381 --> 02:44:38,950
but the thing is like also if you use it,

6285
02:44:38,980 --> 02:44:42,100
you might be the best fucking baseball
player alive and make a kajillion

6286
02:44:42,101 --> 02:44:42,934
dollars.

6287
02:44:43,460 --> 02:44:46,090
It does provide you with energy
that you would normally have.

6288
02:44:46,240 --> 02:44:46,931
It's cheating.

6289
02:44:46,931 --> 02:44:49,090
Says Dr. Richard Lustberg,

6290
02:44:49,091 --> 02:44:52,930
New York state licensed psychologist
and member of the American psychological

6291
02:44:52,931 --> 02:44:53,764
association.

6292
02:44:55,810 --> 02:44:56,200
Yeah,

6293
02:44:56,200 --> 02:44:56,580
baseball.

6294
02:44:56,580 --> 02:44:58,510
I tried to make money but yeah,

6295
02:44:58,511 --> 02:45:00,670
it's weird cause the 15 years
to make money in baseball,

6296
02:45:01,140 --> 02:45:01,810
I'm taking,

6297
02:45:01,810 --> 02:45:04,810
I'm injecting Adderall into my veins
if I'm shooting it right into my Dick

6298
02:45:05,260 --> 02:45:07,410
[inaudible] correct one.

6299
02:45:08,490 --> 02:45:09,880
You try and get paid,

6300
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:10,571
but in fighting,

6301
02:45:10,571 --> 02:45:10,871
if you,

6302
02:45:10,871 --> 02:45:12,280
if you legit have a problem,

6303
02:45:12,281 --> 02:45:12,790
yeah,

6304
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:14,020
but what is that problem?

6305
02:45:14,021 --> 02:45:17,230
See that's the problem that to that
it's never been clearly defined to me.

6306
02:45:17,231 --> 02:45:19,960
I've talked to a bunch of psychologists
and psychiatrist about it.

6307
02:45:20,290 --> 02:45:20,561
I'm like,

6308
02:45:20,561 --> 02:45:21,850
what is Adhd?

6309
02:45:21,900 --> 02:45:22,120
Mike,

6310
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:23,230
how do you define it?

6311
02:45:23,530 --> 02:45:26,050
And he defined it by a series of
characteristics that people have.

6312
02:45:26,051 --> 02:45:28,600
But you could just say you have those.

6313
02:45:28,660 --> 02:45:29,440
I mean,

6314
02:45:29,440 --> 02:45:29,980
you could,

6315
02:45:29,980 --> 02:45:33,370
you could complain about all sorts
of things that are on the list.

6316
02:45:33,371 --> 02:45:34,750
It's not like they test you like,

6317
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:35,290
oh,

6318
02:45:35,290 --> 02:45:36,250
you have syphilis.

6319
02:45:36,700 --> 02:45:37,031
Hey Man,

6320
02:45:37,031 --> 02:45:37,864
let me test you.

6321
02:45:38,050 --> 02:45:38,621
Oh Yeah Bro,

6322
02:45:38,621 --> 02:45:39,430
you got a disease.

6323
02:45:39,430 --> 02:45:40,750
It's not like you guys are all in me.

6324
02:45:40,751 --> 02:45:41,710
But even when I was a kid,

6325
02:45:41,711 --> 02:45:42,670
like if,

6326
02:45:42,730 --> 02:45:45,490
if you were distracted
and couldn't sit still,

6327
02:45:45,491 --> 02:45:46,151
you just think like,

6328
02:45:46,151 --> 02:45:49,480
he has a lot of energies needs to play
or go outside more like no one was

6329
02:45:49,481 --> 02:45:50,350
fucking taking it,

6330
02:45:50,470 --> 02:45:50,741
you know,

6331
02:45:50,741 --> 02:45:51,574
medication,

6332
02:45:52,300 --> 02:45:52,721
UFC,

6333
02:45:52,721 --> 02:45:57,040
exact frank mir was not
the denied an Adderall.

6334
02:45:57,400 --> 02:45:57,960
Um,

6335
02:45:57,960 --> 02:46:00,580
there are pubic use exemption
by Nevada Athletic Commission.

6336
02:46:01,560 --> 02:46:02,291
So what did he say?

6337
02:46:02,291 --> 02:46:03,610
He was so he got one.

6338
02:46:03,640 --> 02:46:05,600
So he got one interesting Adderall.

6339
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:07,960
He was granted one by you Sada.

6340
02:46:08,140 --> 02:46:10,070
That's interesting because maybe

6341
02:46:10,070 --> 02:46:11,840
Tim crater could have been granted it,

6342
02:46:13,640 --> 02:46:14,510
but it was public.

6343
02:46:14,511 --> 02:46:16,190
I'm not saying anything that
people don't know about.

6344
02:46:17,270 --> 02:46:18,740
They're all talking about it at the time.

6345
02:46:19,940 --> 02:46:20,773
Um,

6346
02:46:21,260 --> 02:46:21,711
you know what,

6347
02:46:21,711 --> 02:46:25,040
I think that free for the
people who really need it.

6348
02:46:25,520 --> 02:46:28,940
This has got to be very frustrating
to see people like use it and abuse it

6349
02:46:28,941 --> 02:46:30,280
because Brian Callahan,

6350
02:46:30,350 --> 02:46:30,711
I was like,

6351
02:46:30,711 --> 02:46:31,090
you,

6352
02:46:31,090 --> 02:46:33,080
you have add like I've never seen before.

6353
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:36,260
Oh but he's all over the
place and he was like,

6354
02:46:36,261 --> 02:46:38,600
oh for sure I have add
and went to Dr. He's like,

6355
02:46:38,601 --> 02:46:38,871
Nah,

6356
02:46:38,871 --> 02:46:39,704
you're good.

6357
02:46:40,180 --> 02:46:40,610
Rolling.

6358
02:46:40,610 --> 02:46:40,780
Yeah.

6359
02:46:40,780 --> 02:46:41,613
Dot.

6360
02:46:42,320 --> 02:46:43,910
I told him to fire his doctorate wines.

6361
02:46:43,911 --> 02:46:44,744
Not On Adderall?

6362
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:45,540
No he's on,

6363
02:46:45,540 --> 02:46:46,820
he played at Ross on life.

6364
02:46:46,880 --> 02:46:47,900
Fitzsimmons is on it.

6365
02:46:47,930 --> 02:46:48,621
Brian didn't want,

6366
02:46:48,621 --> 02:46:49,590
he was on um,

6367
02:46:49,640 --> 02:46:50,421
he's actually,

6368
02:46:50,421 --> 02:46:52,280
he's on Ritalin for Tim is on Ritalin.

6369
02:46:52,310 --> 02:46:53,000
What's the difference?

6370
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:53,370
I don't know.

6371
02:46:53,370 --> 02:46:53,930
Speed.

6372
02:46:53,930 --> 02:46:54,420
It's speed.

6373
02:46:54,420 --> 02:46:56,930
He does a podcast the other
day and his knee was like,

6374
02:46:57,020 --> 02:46:59,900
he does like does a lot of like movement.

6375
02:47:00,050 --> 02:47:01,790
It's like constantly moving a lot.

6376
02:47:01,791 --> 02:47:04,310
And someone asked him on
Twitter like what's that about?

6377
02:47:04,560 --> 02:47:09,560
And he's like Ritalin where he just
wanted to talk to Beth and first pot.

6378
02:47:09,710 --> 02:47:09,981
No,

6379
02:47:09,981 --> 02:47:10,161
no,

6380
02:47:10,161 --> 02:47:10,341
no.

6381
02:47:10,341 --> 02:47:13,100
He's been on it cause he is legitimately,

6382
02:47:13,101 --> 02:47:14,450
he has legitimate add,

6383
02:47:14,710 --> 02:47:16,640
which whatever the fuck
that was going to say,

6384
02:47:16,641 --> 02:47:18,740
we don't know what led them to add means.

6385
02:47:18,860 --> 02:47:19,670
Okay,

6386
02:47:19,670 --> 02:47:20,503
let's

6387
02:47:21,680 --> 02:47:22,071
excuse me.

6388
02:47:22,071 --> 02:47:22,910
Let's define it.

6389
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:25,010
Like let's try to see if
someone has a definition.

6390
02:47:25,040 --> 02:47:26,030
What is legitimate?

6391
02:47:26,330 --> 02:47:27,250
What do you think it is?

6392
02:47:27,410 --> 02:47:28,370
What do you guys think of this?

6393
02:47:28,400 --> 02:47:31,490
I think it's so who can't focus on
fucking anything and they're distracted by

6394
02:47:31,491 --> 02:47:32,001
everything.

6395
02:47:32,001 --> 02:47:32,801
Well it's also like,

6396
02:47:32,801 --> 02:47:33,021
yeah,

6397
02:47:33,021 --> 02:47:33,890
there's definitely that.

6398
02:47:34,160 --> 02:47:38,180
It's also patterns and the patterns of
behavior that you develop in your life.

6399
02:47:38,180 --> 02:47:40,790
But this also probably people
that have a legitimate disease.

6400
02:47:40,820 --> 02:47:42,860
They were sitting legitimately
something wrong with their brain.

6401
02:47:43,160 --> 02:47:46,610
The question is how many
people legitimately have
something wrong versus how

6402
02:47:46,611 --> 02:47:48,960
many people are just abusing
it cause he's just assholes.

6403
02:47:49,100 --> 02:47:50,390
They just want to you speed,

6404
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:51,260
get,

6405
02:47:51,260 --> 02:47:52,760
get all that energy and get fired up.

6406
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:54,860
Is it possible,

6407
02:47:54,861 --> 02:47:59,861
is there any chance maybe in some cases
add or some kind of brain dysfunction is

6408
02:48:03,051 --> 02:48:04,910
caused by the vaccines?

6409
02:48:04,911 --> 02:48:05,270
Maybe?

6410
02:48:05,270 --> 02:48:06,910
Is there a possibility
that it's a vaccine?

6411
02:48:07,200 --> 02:48:08,350
No dairy?

6412
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:09,080
No.

6413
02:48:09,080 --> 02:48:09,830
I don't know.

6414
02:48:09,830 --> 02:48:11,120
There's definitely side effects.

6415
02:48:11,121 --> 02:48:14,150
Almost every medication that
you take for certain people.

6416
02:48:15,860 --> 02:48:18,890
Adult attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder.

6417
02:48:18,920 --> 02:48:23,420
Adhd is a mental health disorder that
includes a combination of persistent

6418
02:48:23,421 --> 02:48:25,520
problems such as difficulty

growing count,

6427
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:36,530
poor work or school performance.

6428
02:48:36,531 --> 02:48:36,891
Brian,

6429
02:48:36,891 --> 02:48:40,020
Callan and low self esteem brow.

6430
02:48:40,110 --> 02:48:40,611
The doctor went,

6431
02:48:40,611 --> 02:48:40,791
Nah,

6432
02:48:40,791 --> 02:48:41,730
you don't have low self esteem.

6433
02:48:41,780 --> 02:48:42,620
Can't give it to you bro.

6434
02:48:42,740 --> 02:48:43,700
And other problems.

6435
02:48:43,701 --> 02:48:44,481
What are the other problems?

6436
02:48:44,481 --> 02:48:47,690
We don't even want to talk about
those when other problems be specific.

6437
02:48:47,691 --> 02:48:48,201
Motherfucker,

6438
02:48:48,201 --> 02:48:48,890
this is a,

6439
02:48:48,890 --> 02:48:50,390
this is a medical diagnosis,

6440
02:48:50,391 --> 02:48:51,260
but if you read that,

6441
02:48:51,261 --> 02:48:53,210
that's basically every
kid you've ever met.

6442
02:48:53,810 --> 02:48:53,991
Well,

6443
02:48:53,991 --> 02:48:54,824
here's the problem.

6444
02:48:55,220 --> 02:48:56,150
You get kids,

6445
02:48:56,210 --> 02:48:59,510
kids are filled with energy and they
want to play and they want to have fun.

6446
02:48:59,511 --> 02:49:02,660
Then when you want to be stimulated and
then you make them sit in your shit,

6447
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:03,690
talk you,

6448
02:49:03,690 --> 02:49:05,630
they sit in an uncomfortable bullshit,

6449
02:49:05,631 --> 02:49:06,590
plastic chair.

6450
02:49:06,740 --> 02:49:07,140
Listen,

6451
02:49:07,140 --> 02:49:11,630
some monotone asshole who's
teaching them nonsense going wrong.

6452
02:49:11,690 --> 02:49:11,940
Not,

6453
02:49:11,940 --> 02:49:14,310
it's not the kids issue part of it,

6454
02:49:14,460 --> 02:49:17,340
but parents want to give it to their kids
because they just want the kids to pay

6455
02:49:17,341 --> 02:49:18,174
attention.

6456
02:49:18,360 --> 02:49:18,751
You know,

6457
02:49:18,751 --> 02:49:21,810
I had a neighbor who got their kid on
Ritalin and there was nothing wrong with

6458
02:49:21,811 --> 02:49:24,120
this kid and he got the kid on
Ritalin and was just like this,

6459
02:49:24,121 --> 02:49:25,350
all the stupid pants.

6460
02:49:25,650 --> 02:49:26,483
He's just like,

6461
02:49:26,730 --> 02:49:27,070
fuck,

6462
02:49:27,070 --> 02:49:27,903
focus the spot.

6463
02:49:28,210 --> 02:49:28,430
Hey,

6464
02:49:28,430 --> 02:49:29,550
focus focuses father.

6465
02:49:29,880 --> 02:49:32,160
He just listened by
killing video games too.

6466
02:49:32,370 --> 02:49:34,850
Probably get them in front
of Matt and Hell Yeah.

6467
02:49:34,860 --> 02:49:36,660
Can just kind of plays on bitches.

6468
02:49:36,690 --> 02:49:37,170
Yeah.

6469
02:49:37,170 --> 02:49:37,740
Yeah.

6470
02:49:37,740 --> 02:49:38,690
Probably had a lot of friends though.

6471
02:49:38,750 --> 02:49:39,001
It's,

6472
02:49:39,001 --> 02:49:41,250
it's definitely dangerous how
many people are medicated,

6473
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:44,910
but the real question is like how many
people actually could use the medication

6474
02:49:44,911 --> 02:49:48,090
versus how many people are medicated
because doctors are like to meet someone

6475
02:49:48,091 --> 02:49:49,950
really w who has that problem,

6476
02:49:50,160 --> 02:49:52,050
who really has add and figure it out.

6477
02:49:52,080 --> 02:49:56,150
I bet some of them kids were seriously
abused as kids and they just come out

6478
02:49:56,170 --> 02:49:56,491
just in,

6479
02:49:56,491 --> 02:49:57,324
they're all just fucked,

6480
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:58,313
fucked up.

6481
02:49:59,490 --> 02:50:00,690
That's definitely a possibility.

6482
02:50:00,720 --> 02:50:01,830
Not of abuse going on.

6483
02:50:02,250 --> 02:50:02,550
Well,

6484
02:50:02,550 --> 02:50:04,350
there's also like emotional abuse.

6485
02:50:04,351 --> 02:50:05,580
People just yell at their kids,

6486
02:50:05,581 --> 02:50:06,361
beat their kids.

6487
02:50:06,361 --> 02:50:08,400
There's kids that people get ignored.

6488
02:50:08,730 --> 02:50:12,180
Kids don't have friends who grow up
with parents that are just assholes and

6489
02:50:12,181 --> 02:50:12,600
they're just,

6490
02:50:12,600 --> 02:50:13,650
they saw life is like,

6491
02:50:13,860 --> 02:50:15,450
they're constantly walking on eggshells.

6492
02:50:15,510 --> 02:50:18,300
They're all fucked up psychologically
because of its bomber man.

6493
02:50:18,680 --> 02:50:19,260
Yeah,

6494
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:20,051
it's a bummer dude.

6495
02:50:20,051 --> 02:50:20,610
You here,

6496
02:50:20,610 --> 02:50:23,940
I can't read horrible stories but I've
read some story about some guy in Texas

6497
02:50:23,941 --> 02:50:24,940
that he's,

6498
02:50:25,030 --> 02:50:27,210
his three year old daughter
wouldn't drink her milk.

6499
02:50:27,211 --> 02:50:30,830
So he made her stand outside by the
tree and she disappeared brother.

6500
02:50:30,910 --> 02:50:34,330
He went back out 15 minutes and she was
gone and the police went looking for,

6501
02:50:34,350 --> 02:50:35,250
they can't find her.

6502
02:50:35,251 --> 02:50:35,970
She disappears.

6503
02:50:35,970 --> 02:50:37,410
You hear in the interview what he said.

6504
02:50:37,440 --> 02:50:37,880
What'd he say?

6505
02:50:37,880 --> 02:50:40,110
I put her out there and
they do think happening.

6506
02:50:40,320 --> 02:50:40,690
There's,

6507
02:50:40,690 --> 02:50:42,870
there's been a lot of
siding of coyotes in the,

6508
02:50:42,871 --> 02:50:44,220
in the area and they're like,

6509
02:50:44,221 --> 02:50:46,350
what the fuck is wrong with you coyotes?

6510
02:50:46,710 --> 02:50:47,520
I read that.

6511
02:50:47,520 --> 02:50:49,830
I read that exact dark like
couldn't sleep that night man.

6512
02:50:49,980 --> 02:50:52,470
I could not stop thinking
about that has to do with kids.

6513
02:50:52,471 --> 02:50:57,090
It fucks me three year old outside cause
she wouldn't finish her mouth and she

6514
02:50:57,091 --> 02:50:58,110
has a disability.

6515
02:50:59,130 --> 02:50:59,970
She has a disability.

6516
02:50:59,971 --> 02:51:04,971
She went finished your milky like fucking
moron who they've already taken the

6517
02:51:05,220 --> 02:51:07,620
other one in the morning
when it finished her mouth.

6518
02:51:07,710 --> 02:51:11,850
So this morning puts out a tree at two
in the morning and then Dave or child

6519
02:51:11,851 --> 02:51:12,571
custody or he came,

6520
02:51:12,571 --> 02:51:14,160
took the one of the kids way before.

6521
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:15,653
It's

6522
02:51:17,190 --> 02:51:20,640
almost like definitely that kid
getting violent guy with that guy.

6523
02:51:20,820 --> 02:51:22,140
I would fuck up for free.

6524
02:51:22,770 --> 02:51:23,041
Yeah,

6525
02:51:23,041 --> 02:51:23,874
that guy does that guy.

6526
02:51:24,660 --> 02:51:27,150
That guy should be toward the fact
that he could do that to a baby,

6527
02:51:27,300 --> 02:51:28,650
a three and his own man,

6528
02:51:28,651 --> 02:51:29,490
his own daughter.

6529
02:51:29,610 --> 02:51:30,420
And I think about that.

6530
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:33,300
I think of Mike and I think
y'all scared he'd be by the tree.

6531
02:51:33,330 --> 02:51:35,500
It fucks up the world missing Todd.

6532
02:51:35,501 --> 02:51:36,181
She's still missing,

6533
02:51:36,181 --> 02:51:36,640
right?

6534
02:51:36,640 --> 02:51:37,740
There's no update on that.

6535
02:51:37,741 --> 02:51:38,070
No,

6536
02:51:38,070 --> 02:51:38,910
they never found her.

6537
02:51:39,030 --> 02:51:42,330
She probably got eight and
they got deserves the coyotes.

6538
02:51:42,390 --> 02:51:43,710
Jesus Christ.

6539
02:51:44,070 --> 02:51:44,471
Meanwhile,

6540
02:51:44,471 --> 02:51:45,360
I probably killed her.

6541
02:51:45,540 --> 02:51:48,120
I need you that he made that
story up and you might be right.

6542
02:51:48,121 --> 02:51:48,960
You might be right at,

6543
02:51:48,961 --> 02:51:49,794
he might be right.

6544
02:51:50,070 --> 02:51:51,450
Might have like,

6545
02:51:51,451 --> 02:51:52,380
I deserved the death bell.

6546
02:51:52,381 --> 02:51:55,110
And there's the proof that
a story that sounds like a,

6547
02:51:55,200 --> 02:51:55,990
I called him something.

6548
02:51:55,990 --> 02:51:56,970
Did it either way.

6549
02:51:57,170 --> 02:51:58,290
If he just left her outside,

6550
02:51:58,291 --> 02:51:59,460
if he knew this coyotes around,

6551
02:51:59,461 --> 02:52:00,960
he's asking his kid to get anything back.

6552
02:52:01,500 --> 02:52:04,680
He might've wanted the kid to get eaten
by a code because he's a bad person.

6553
02:52:04,681 --> 02:52:06,440
He's a piece of shit and he's,

6554
02:52:06,460 --> 02:52:07,090
you know,

6555
02:52:07,090 --> 02:52:08,890
raising a kid tests you.

6556
02:52:09,070 --> 02:52:09,903
It's like,

6557
02:52:09,940 --> 02:52:10,181
you know,

6558
02:52:10,181 --> 02:52:12,010
there's some people that
are just fucked in the head.

6559
02:52:12,820 --> 02:52:13,061
Damn.

6560
02:52:13,061 --> 02:52:14,670
We should end on this and
definitely shouldn't it.

6561
02:52:14,680 --> 02:52:15,513
What else you guys get?

6562
02:52:15,550 --> 02:52:16,900
What's not in on that bullshit?

6563
02:52:17,300 --> 02:52:17,860
Sad.

6564
02:52:17,860 --> 02:52:18,580
I know.

6565
02:52:18,580 --> 02:52:19,450
Too much sadness,

6566
02:52:19,451 --> 02:52:19,900
ma'am.

6567
02:52:19,900 --> 02:52:20,890
There's a lot of sadness.

6568
02:52:20,890 --> 02:52:21,590
My man.

6569
02:52:21,590 --> 02:52:22,720
Lots of good shit too.

6570
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:23,290
Yeah,

6571
02:52:23,290 --> 02:52:24,970
there's a lot of great shit in the world,

6572
02:52:24,971 --> 02:52:25,750
but content,

6573
02:52:25,750 --> 02:52:28,960
there's a lot of fucking more so
that'll fuck your day and you can't,

6574
02:52:28,990 --> 02:52:32,440
the thing is you can't fix
them like a guy like that.

6575
02:52:32,770 --> 02:52:35,650
Like the once a guide
does that to his daughter,

6576
02:52:36,190 --> 02:52:36,790
what do you,

6577
02:52:36,790 --> 02:52:37,181
you know,

6578
02:52:37,181 --> 02:52:38,260
you're not fixing that car.

6579
02:52:38,261 --> 02:52:39,130
That guy's dead.

6580
02:52:39,160 --> 02:52:39,791
Think about that guy.

6581
02:52:39,791 --> 02:52:40,830
His friends too.

6582
02:52:40,870 --> 02:52:41,471
And if you'd like,

6583
02:52:41,471 --> 02:52:42,360
how was your night last night?

6584
02:52:42,361 --> 02:52:43,181
Oh my fucking kid.

6585
02:52:43,181 --> 02:52:44,110
One finches bottle.

6586
02:52:44,111 --> 02:52:45,100
So I left her outside.

6587
02:52:46,170 --> 02:52:48,730
What the fuck do you hang out with?

6588
02:52:49,000 --> 02:52:50,110
Who else are you hanging out with?

6589
02:52:50,111 --> 02:52:52,300
We can talk like that and
everyone thinks it's all good.

6590
02:52:53,800 --> 02:52:58,540
You know the thing is like you can't
forgive someone for that and you have to

6591
02:52:58,541 --> 02:52:59,374
kill them.

6592
02:52:59,680 --> 02:52:59,921
What?

6593
02:52:59,921 --> 02:53:02,470
How do you forgive someone
for doing that to a baby?

6594
02:53:02,680 --> 02:53:04,600
Like if someone beats a baby to death,

6595
02:53:05,800 --> 02:53:06,633
you don't,

6596
02:53:06,970 --> 02:53:08,290
there's no returning from that.

6597
02:53:08,410 --> 02:53:09,191
Get a torture.

6598
02:53:09,191 --> 02:53:09,911
But then people go,

6599
02:53:09,911 --> 02:53:10,930
it's a mental illness.

6600
02:53:11,230 --> 02:53:13,360
Publicly torture him publicly.

6601
02:53:13,390 --> 02:53:13,841
But does that,

6602
02:53:13,841 --> 02:53:14,880
is that really good?

6603
02:53:14,881 --> 02:53:16,180
Is that fix anything?

6604
02:53:16,570 --> 02:53:17,403
Does it like,

6605
02:53:17,640 --> 02:53:17,990
Yep.

6606
02:53:17,990 --> 02:53:18,760
It'll scare people.

6607
02:53:18,760 --> 02:53:20,260
There's the bigger picture and people go,

6608
02:53:20,261 --> 02:53:22,000
it listened to mental illness issue,

6609
02:53:22,001 --> 02:53:23,350
so we need to fix them.

6610
02:53:23,380 --> 02:53:24,213
And it's like,

6611
02:53:24,220 --> 02:53:24,431
yeah,

6612
02:53:24,431 --> 02:53:28,210
the mental illness issue is a weird one
because I saw something about huffpost

6613
02:53:28,230 --> 02:53:32,470
had some thing about pedophiles and
they eventually took it down I think,

6614
02:53:32,740 --> 02:53:33,580
but this guy was saying,

6615
02:53:33,581 --> 02:53:34,510
I'm not a monster,

6616
02:53:34,511 --> 02:53:35,590
I'm a pedophile.

6617
02:53:35,890 --> 02:53:37,750
And he's basically saying
that he has these thoughts.

6618
02:53:37,751 --> 02:53:38,770
He just doesn't act on them.

6619
02:53:38,771 --> 02:53:39,491
And everybody was like,

6620
02:53:39,491 --> 02:53:39,940
what?

6621
02:53:39,940 --> 02:53:41,110
Holy Fuck.

6622
02:53:41,170 --> 02:53:42,250
What the fuck are you?

6623
02:53:42,280 --> 02:53:43,510
What did they say that for?

6624
02:53:43,511 --> 02:53:43,721
Everything,

6625
02:53:43,721 --> 02:53:43,901
right.

6626
02:53:43,901 --> 02:53:44,591
For if you,

6627
02:53:44,591 --> 02:53:45,940
if you rape kids,

6628
02:53:45,941 --> 02:53:47,170
if you're a child molester,

6629
02:53:47,320 --> 02:53:48,290
if you're uh,

6630
02:53:48,340 --> 02:53:48,760
uh,

6631
02:53:48,760 --> 02:53:49,001
you know,

6632
02:53:49,001 --> 02:53:50,080
if you shoot people,

6633
02:53:50,110 --> 02:53:51,070
it's a mental illness.

6634
02:53:51,070 --> 02:53:53,350
That molesters are running this planet,

6635
02:53:53,410 --> 02:53:56,080
that those are the one that
you opened the door fucked up.

6636
02:53:56,170 --> 02:53:57,130
Those are the real key here.

6637
02:53:57,131 --> 02:53:59,320
The Donald Trump's gonna
open up the JFK dump.

6638
02:53:59,560 --> 02:54:00,393
How about that?

6639
02:54:00,400 --> 02:54:04,540
All the dump of documents from the JFK
that had been sealed up by all the other

6640
02:54:04,541 --> 02:54:07,930
presidents like the JFK
assassination investigation,

6641
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:12,370
they sealed some documents up because
they're too sensitive and like whatever

6642
02:54:12,371 --> 02:54:13,204
those documents,

6643
02:54:13,560 --> 02:54:14,920
they shred those documents.

6644
02:54:15,070 --> 02:54:15,730
How can now,

6645
02:54:15,730 --> 02:54:20,290
why would damning documents B exists?

6646
02:54:20,320 --> 02:54:24,920
These are people from 1962 also Trump for
sure folks on something else and this,

6647
02:54:25,170 --> 02:54:25,361
hey,

6648
02:54:25,361 --> 02:54:27,160
this is not a bad thing to focus on.

6649
02:54:27,550 --> 02:54:30,280
If he show me are the
things we know for sure,

6650
02:54:30,550 --> 02:54:31,540
but first of all,

6651
02:54:31,690 --> 02:54:33,160
no one really can be president.

6652
02:54:33,161 --> 02:54:33,791
Let's be honest,

6653
02:54:33,791 --> 02:54:37,030
there's not a single person that could
focus on the economy and healthcare and

6654
02:54:37,031 --> 02:54:41,150
international relations and
the environment and like
there's no way to do with

6655
02:54:41,160 --> 02:54:42,040
the word job though.

6656
02:54:42,060 --> 02:54:42,440
Yes,

6657
02:54:42,440 --> 02:54:42,550
yeah,

6658
02:54:42,550 --> 02:54:42,971
for sure.

6659
02:54:42,971 --> 02:54:44,910
But there's not enough time in the
world the focus on any of those.

6660
02:54:45,090 --> 02:54:49,300
The Sony should focus on Donald Trump
should focus on the Vegas shooting that he

6661
02:54:49,301 --> 02:54:50,260
hasn't said Shit about it.

6662
02:54:51,220 --> 02:54:52,060
That's how we're ending it.

6663
02:54:52,120 --> 02:54:52,953
You know what I mean?

6664
02:54:52,990 --> 02:54:53,500
Well,

6665
02:54:53,500 --> 02:54:54,640
what do you think?

6666
02:54:54,641 --> 02:54:55,840
There was some shady shit going on,

6667
02:54:56,080 --> 02:54:57,220
but here's the thing about this,

6668
02:54:57,221 --> 02:54:58,960
this Kennedy assassination,

6669
02:54:59,110 --> 02:55:00,730
one of the reasons why if I was him,

6670
02:55:00,790 --> 02:55:03,770
I would focus on the Kennedy assassination
as they might fucking kill him.

6671
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:08,090
Like it's entirely possible that he's
thinking that he could get assassinated

6672
02:55:08,180 --> 02:55:09,890
hundred percent of herself.

6673
02:55:10,650 --> 02:55:14,270
That's why he's opening it would if
I wouldn't think there was any files,

6674
02:55:14,271 --> 02:55:14,781
like why would they,

6675
02:55:14,781 --> 02:55:15,650
are those files exist?

6676
02:55:15,710 --> 02:55:17,600
They should have been
burned a long time ago.

6677
02:55:17,730 --> 02:55:18,050
Yeah,

6678
02:55:18,050 --> 02:55:18,650
you would think so.

6679
02:55:18,650 --> 02:55:20,540
There's no files and also is it,

6680
02:55:21,660 --> 02:55:24,020
it doesn't have the highest
security of all time.

6681
02:55:24,020 --> 02:55:24,361
Like they,

6682
02:55:24,361 --> 02:55:27,350
they pay the most to protect amount of
all time because there's such a threat

6683
02:55:27,351 --> 02:55:28,184
now.

6684
02:55:28,670 --> 02:55:28,821
Oh,

6685
02:55:28,821 --> 02:55:31,910
he has crazy security doors on his limo.

6686
02:55:32,090 --> 02:55:33,560
They had a video of him.

6687
02:55:33,710 --> 02:55:34,543
I was a,

6688
02:55:35,590 --> 02:55:35,870
God,

6689
02:55:35,870 --> 02:55:36,910
I can't stop coughing in there.

6690
02:55:37,670 --> 02:55:38,141
I was going,

6691
02:55:38,141 --> 02:55:40,350
I was looking at this image of,

6692
02:55:40,351 --> 02:55:40,610
uh,

6693
02:55:40,610 --> 02:55:41,443
him.

6694
02:55:41,490 --> 02:55:41,630
Uh,

6695
02:55:41,630 --> 02:55:43,610
there was a video of him getting
out of the limo and I was like,

6696
02:55:43,611 --> 02:55:45,020
look at that door on that fucking limo.

6697
02:55:45,021 --> 02:55:46,880
And then I went to some
images of the limo.

6698
02:55:47,060 --> 02:55:49,160
The Limo door is like that thick.

6699
02:55:49,220 --> 02:55:50,880
Is it different than Obama's though?

6700
02:55:51,340 --> 02:55:53,510
That the standard one I Cadillac makes.

6701
02:55:53,540 --> 02:55:54,530
I never looked at the other one,

6702
02:55:54,830 --> 02:55:55,610
but I mean the,

6703
02:55:55,610 --> 02:55:55,831
the,

6704
02:55:55,831 --> 02:55:57,980
the doors are fucking ridiculous.

6705
02:55:57,981 --> 02:55:59,500
Bombproof yeah,

6706
02:55:59,510 --> 02:56:00,200
they're sick.

6707
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:01,970
That would be the dopest
car to drive around.

6708
02:56:01,971 --> 02:56:02,481
And you'd be like,

6709
02:56:02,481 --> 02:56:05,900
fuck this fire away.

6710
02:56:05,901 --> 02:56:07,850
Burroughs me around that.

6711
02:56:09,040 --> 02:56:10,220
You being there sipping tea.

6712
02:56:10,470 --> 02:56:12,330
We'll add these up whole world.

6713
02:56:12,331 --> 02:56:12,701
Kiki.

6714
02:56:12,701 --> 02:56:13,220
Kiki.

6715
02:56:13,220 --> 02:56:13,700
Yeah.

6716
02:56:13,700 --> 02:56:15,860
They make a car that you can buy.

6717
02:56:16,370 --> 02:56:18,560
There's a company called Dev Rolo,

6718
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:21,310
D v R O l o.

6719
02:56:21,590 --> 02:56:23,660
And they make a car like your truck,

6720
02:56:23,990 --> 02:56:25,220
a Toyota Tundra.

6721
02:56:25,550 --> 02:56:27,740
But they make that
motherfucker bulletproof.

6722
02:56:27,770 --> 02:56:31,340
I used to work for a company that used
to bulletproof vehicles for two weeks.

6723
02:56:31,341 --> 02:56:31,811
It was a fiber.

6724
02:56:31,811 --> 02:56:33,140
Glad they do at fiberglass.

6725
02:56:33,470 --> 02:56:34,250
I couldn't hang.

6726
02:56:34,250 --> 02:56:34,581
Yes,

6727
02:56:34,581 --> 02:56:34,941
I quit.

6728
02:56:34,941 --> 02:56:35,600
It was too hard.

6729
02:56:35,600 --> 02:56:35,841
Oh,

6730
02:56:35,841 --> 02:56:37,030
the fiberglass fumes.

6731
02:56:39,820 --> 02:56:41,480
We were Shitty Gig.

6732
02:56:41,630 --> 02:56:45,860
We made cars for diplomats and for
like a mobile check cashing vans out.

6733
02:56:45,861 --> 02:56:46,840
Those are the big bangs.

6734
02:56:47,000 --> 02:56:47,860
Mobile Sense.

6735
02:56:47,990 --> 02:56:49,040
And then private cars.

6736
02:56:49,041 --> 02:56:49,460
We just,

6737
02:56:49,460 --> 02:56:51,650
you just fill the doors
up with fiberglass.

6738
02:56:51,651 --> 02:56:53,210
Just sheets of fiberglass.

6739
02:56:53,760 --> 02:56:53,991
Yeah,

6740
02:56:53,991 --> 02:56:54,710
that's it.

6741
02:56:54,710 --> 02:56:55,760
But what about the windows?

6742
02:56:56,140 --> 02:56:56,540
Um,

6743
02:56:56,540 --> 02:56:57,373
I dunno.

6744
02:56:57,660 --> 02:57:00,020
I don't remember how the
windows are thick as fuck.

6745
02:57:00,021 --> 02:57:03,350
And I don't think the windows
windows are different.

6746
02:57:03,351 --> 02:57:06,860
Fact down this bulletproof
be bulletproof underneath,

6747
02:57:06,890 --> 02:57:09,620
make it bomb proof from
underneath fiberglass,

6748
02:57:09,621 --> 02:57:11,000
the shit out of the doors.

6749
02:57:11,210 --> 02:57:12,650
But this Dev Rolo Company,

6750
02:57:12,651 --> 02:57:14,360
they do like consumer cars.

6751
02:57:14,840 --> 02:57:15,201
And,

6752
02:57:15,201 --> 02:57:15,680
uh,

6753
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:17,180
I don't know what they do at the window.

6754
02:57:17,210 --> 02:57:17,601
Brazil.

6755
02:57:17,601 --> 02:57:18,410
They're popular.

6756
02:57:18,410 --> 02:57:20,060
Bulletproof cars like shirts.

6757
02:57:20,090 --> 02:57:22,910
Hell yes to Mexicans update new Cadillac.

6758
02:57:22,911 --> 02:57:27,911
Presidential limousine to debut later
in 2017 Cadillac just runs that shit.

6759
02:57:29,280 --> 02:57:31,550
Got your acids Cadillac
called the beast America.

6760
02:57:31,820 --> 02:57:32,070
Oh,

6761
02:57:32,070 --> 02:57:33,380
what a fucking clever name.

6762
02:57:33,730 --> 02:57:34,563
Beast.

6763
02:57:35,440 --> 02:57:35,940
I think.

6764
02:57:35,940 --> 02:57:37,730
Hey that can't be cheap.

6765
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:38,480
Wait a minute.

6766
02:57:38,480 --> 02:57:40,460
They're selling it to anybody.

6767
02:57:42,380 --> 02:57:44,030
How come I can't buy
what the president has?

6768
02:57:44,360 --> 02:57:45,193
Come on Bro.

6769
02:57:46,520 --> 02:57:47,061
What do you think?

6770
02:57:47,061 --> 02:57:49,310
How much one of those limos goes for?

6771
02:57:49,950 --> 02:57:50,783
What's the money?

6772
02:57:52,010 --> 02:57:54,410
I'm gonna say 600,000 oh no,

6773
02:57:54,411 --> 02:57:54,621
no.

6774
02:57:54,621 --> 02:57:56,040
If the taxpayers are paying for,

6775
02:57:56,180 --> 02:57:57,200
that's Tourbillion.

6776
02:58:00,640 --> 02:58:02,790
It's that tax money shit.

6777
02:58:02,850 --> 02:58:03,930
No bid contract.

6778
02:58:03,990 --> 02:58:05,310
A billion dollar limousine.

6779
02:58:06,720 --> 02:58:08,130
Two plus three plus two.

6780
02:58:08,131 --> 02:58:11,700
Layout means it can carry chief
executive and a couple of aides on most

6781
02:58:11,701 --> 02:58:12,450
journeys.

6782
02:58:12,450 --> 02:58:15,960
Pasture compartment was still offer
conference style seating for five and the

6783
02:58:15,961 --> 02:58:20,130
real rear passenger doors will still
be positioned to the front of the rear

6784
02:58:20,130 --> 02:58:20,850
quarter windows.

6785
02:58:20,850 --> 02:58:23,130
They will partially
obscure the two rear seats.

6786
02:58:23,550 --> 02:58:24,241
If I was president,

6787
02:58:24,241 --> 02:58:26,910
I want to have a catholic
like something like that.

6788
02:58:26,911 --> 02:58:30,930
But the front end and be a viper out
the American out of the Punisher War van

6789
02:58:31,370 --> 02:58:33,690
put say fucking white skull
on the side of it too.

6790
02:58:33,900 --> 02:58:35,820
Could do like a big ass long Bronco.

6791
02:58:35,821 --> 02:58:38,880
Just something so fucking American Bronco.

6792
02:58:38,881 --> 02:58:39,480
It'd be sick.

6793
02:58:39,480 --> 02:58:40,410
Maybe a Ram.

6794
02:58:40,411 --> 02:58:41,250
Dodge Ram.

6795
02:58:43,370 --> 02:58:43,860
Yeah.

6796
02:58:43,860 --> 02:58:45,110
Bulletproof a smart car.

6797
02:58:46,070 --> 02:58:47,250
Be a bomber man.

6798
02:58:47,251 --> 02:58:48,810
Those things are so ridiculous.

6799
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:50,360
How many of those do you see a lot of?

6800
02:58:50,970 --> 02:58:52,200
You see a little of them in Hollywood.

6801
02:58:52,900 --> 02:58:54,150
I feel like they're dying out.

6802
02:58:54,660 --> 02:58:55,200
You think so?

6803
02:58:55,200 --> 02:58:55,910
Yeah.

6804
02:58:55,910 --> 02:58:56,730
Yeah.

6805
02:58:56,730 --> 02:58:57,090
Yeah.

6806
02:58:57,090 --> 02:58:59,010
People don't want to save gas that much.

6807
02:58:59,070 --> 02:58:59,341
Again,

6808
02:58:59,341 --> 02:58:59,820
get laid.

6809
02:58:59,820 --> 02:59:00,780
There are so lame.

6810
02:59:00,960 --> 02:59:02,030
There's so many.

6811
02:59:02,970 --> 02:59:03,930
It's like a motorcycle.

6812
02:59:03,931 --> 02:59:04,620
You're dead.

6813
02:59:04,620 --> 02:59:05,410
Yeah,

6814
02:59:05,410 --> 02:59:06,780
but girl riding a Prius with you.

6815
02:59:07,770 --> 02:59:10,440
Like how he's just really
glean Ygrene Vegan Shit.

6816
02:59:10,460 --> 02:59:11,940
He's really into the environment.

6817
02:59:12,110 --> 02:59:14,450
Who is that chat?

6818
02:59:14,460 --> 02:59:17,450
Osho Cinco has a hooked up smart car.

6819
02:59:17,480 --> 02:59:18,000
Yeah.

6820
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:19,380
What is he doing these days?

6821
02:59:20,040 --> 02:59:21,210
That's a big smart car.

6822
02:59:21,211 --> 02:59:22,800
Right at the special one.

6823
02:59:22,830 --> 02:59:26,330
He was rumored or they tried to do
a flag football league him in too.

6824
02:59:26,340 --> 02:59:27,330
And a couple of other players.

6825
02:59:27,331 --> 02:59:30,900
They used to be an NFL and they did like
a pilot game I think to try to see if

6826
02:59:30,901 --> 02:59:31,760
anybody was interested.

6827
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:34,140
But he said he's managed
to stay fairly relevant.

6828
02:59:34,141 --> 02:59:35,160
He's really big on Twitter.

6829
02:59:35,190 --> 02:59:35,890
He plays a,

6830
02:59:35,890 --> 02:59:36,900
he goes around the war,

6831
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:40,050
wound up a world but the United
States and challenges people in FIFA,

6832
02:59:40,110 --> 02:59:41,220
he says we'll play them at their game.

6833
02:59:41,280 --> 02:59:42,620
And He's good.

6834
02:59:42,930 --> 02:59:43,860
He's good at physicals.

6835
02:59:43,920 --> 02:59:44,970
I mean like real soccer.

6836
02:59:44,990 --> 02:59:45,823
Keep his name out there.

6837
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:47,520
But flag football sir.

6838
02:59:47,550 --> 02:59:49,680
Absolutely not the same as that.

6839
02:59:49,681 --> 02:59:50,910
Three on three basketball league.

6840
02:59:50,940 --> 02:59:53,100
He's got a fucking smart car.

6841
02:59:53,160 --> 02:59:54,810
I've never seen a hooked up smart card.

6842
02:59:54,840 --> 02:59:55,900
I don't want to see a map.

6843
02:59:56,020 --> 02:59:59,280
Slack vented roaders no,

6844
02:59:59,281 --> 03:00:00,114
you're not into it.

6845
03:00:00,270 --> 03:00:01,103
You're angry.

6846
03:00:01,380 --> 03:00:02,310
It's just not for me man.

6847
03:00:02,340 --> 03:00:03,173
He look a little angry.

6848
03:00:03,550 --> 03:00:04,383
Just not for me.

6849
03:00:05,430 --> 03:00:05,980
Yeah,

6850
03:00:05,980 --> 03:00:08,580
it looks like it's taken a fence.

6851
03:00:11,670 --> 03:00:11,941
Yeah.

6852
03:00:11,941 --> 03:00:15,600
Those are not the best cars to drive
around and seem super dangerous.

6853
03:00:16,170 --> 03:00:17,990
Prius got cool cause Leonardo Dicaprio,

6854
03:00:18,210 --> 03:00:18,950
you know Bronx,

6855
03:00:18,950 --> 03:00:19,131
him,

6856
03:00:19,131 --> 03:00:19,410
you know,

6857
03:00:19,410 --> 03:00:20,400
he doesn't really rock them.

6858
03:00:20,401 --> 03:00:22,860
He just rocked him where the photo shoot
and he hopped out of that and right

6859
03:00:22,861 --> 03:00:23,670
into his Ferrari.

6860
03:00:23,670 --> 03:00:25,880
Mumble a bit

6861
03:00:27,990 --> 03:00:31,200
while I was getting
blown snorting Adderall.

6862
03:00:31,530 --> 03:00:33,420
Brian still have the Tesla now.

6863
03:00:33,450 --> 03:00:33,960
Oh he had,

6864
03:00:33,960 --> 03:00:34,661
he does have the feds,

6865
03:00:34,661 --> 03:00:35,940
a son and he does have the Tesla.

6866
03:00:36,060 --> 03:00:36,820
It's all fucking,

6867
03:00:36,820 --> 03:00:37,400
you know Brian,

6868
03:00:37,400 --> 03:00:38,940
he doesn't kick out to have a Tesla.

6869
03:00:39,030 --> 03:00:40,410
It's just not as well.

6870
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:42,110
That car man.

6871
03:00:42,710 --> 03:00:43,301
Is that the test?

6872
03:00:43,301 --> 03:00:44,400
The Fisker fits the fish.

6873
03:00:45,030 --> 03:00:45,900
They caught on fire though,

6874
03:00:45,901 --> 03:00:46,410
didn't they?

6875
03:00:46,410 --> 03:00:47,011
Well they did.

6876
03:00:47,011 --> 03:00:49,020
The old ones did when they had that,

6877
03:00:49,021 --> 03:00:51,450
a hurricane that hit the east
coast couple of years back,

6878
03:00:51,660 --> 03:00:56,660
they had all these bitches parked near
some water and the tide came in and they

6879
03:00:57,481 --> 03:00:58,314
all blew up

6880
03:00:59,770 --> 03:01:00,810
when they went under water.

6881
03:01:00,840 --> 03:01:01,960
They just started exploding.

6882
03:01:02,180 --> 03:01:03,013
Can get for cheap.

6883
03:01:03,320 --> 03:01:03,851
If it rains,

6884
03:01:03,851 --> 03:01:04,451
you're kind of fucked.

6885
03:01:04,451 --> 03:01:05,050
But they're cool.

6886
03:01:05,050 --> 03:01:06,550
Well I think they've fixed that.

6887
03:01:06,600 --> 03:01:07,990
Not they're out of business now.

6888
03:01:07,991 --> 03:01:08,510
Their back.

6889
03:01:08,510 --> 03:01:09,190
Are they bad?

6890
03:01:09,190 --> 03:01:09,911
Fiskars damn,

6891
03:01:09,911 --> 03:01:10,450
I want one.

6892
03:01:10,450 --> 03:01:11,260
They have a new car.

6893
03:01:11,260 --> 03:01:12,190
There's all the cars.

6894
03:01:12,191 --> 03:01:12,821
Look at them all.

6895
03:01:12,821 --> 03:01:15,670
They're all just fucking just cinders.

6896
03:01:16,360 --> 03:01:18,340
They've all just blew
up and caught on fire.

6897
03:01:18,341 --> 03:01:19,750
That is fucking hilarious,

6898
03:01:19,751 --> 03:01:19,991
man.

6899
03:01:19,991 --> 03:01:20,824
Look at them all.

6900
03:01:21,670 --> 03:01:22,503
Fuck

6901
03:01:23,760 --> 03:01:25,210
manage the people that own them like,

6902
03:01:25,211 --> 03:01:25,451
hey,

6903
03:01:25,451 --> 03:01:26,650
you fucking piece of shit.

6904
03:01:26,651 --> 03:01:27,910
What if I drive through a puddle?

6905
03:01:28,240 --> 03:01:29,073
Damn.

6906
03:01:29,730 --> 03:01:30,910
That car's gonna blow up.

6907
03:01:30,940 --> 03:01:32,020
That's a sweet ride though.

6908
03:01:32,140 --> 03:01:33,160
That's like a,

6909
03:01:33,190 --> 03:01:33,990
you know,

6910
03:01:33,990 --> 03:01:34,860
that's nothing for chairs.

6911
03:01:35,260 --> 03:01:35,951
Those are the fee.

6912
03:01:35,951 --> 03:01:36,940
It's way cool.

6913
03:01:36,941 --> 03:01:39,570
That's Linaro not Justin Bieber beeps.

6914
03:01:40,080 --> 03:01:40,600
Chrome one,

6915
03:01:40,600 --> 03:01:41,433
the chrome one.

6916
03:01:41,530 --> 03:01:44,830
I think that's the
future is electric cars.

6917
03:01:44,831 --> 03:01:46,560
It's just they're not
quite ready for prime time.

6918
03:01:46,610 --> 03:01:47,443
Right.

6919
03:01:47,480 --> 03:01:48,221
I just can't get it.

6920
03:01:48,221 --> 03:01:49,720
I know for the environment I get it.

6921
03:01:49,721 --> 03:01:50,650
I liked that aspect.

6922
03:01:50,651 --> 03:01:51,790
I just can't get into it.

6923
03:01:51,791 --> 03:01:52,210
Man.

6924
03:01:52,210 --> 03:01:53,130
I can do a test on that.

6925
03:01:53,131 --> 03:01:55,750
Got bums me out there better for the air.

6926
03:01:55,810 --> 03:01:56,110
I know.

6927
03:01:56,110 --> 03:01:56,920
Sure.

6928
03:01:56,920 --> 03:02:00,670
But environmentally there's a lot of
concerns with those things like how they

6929
03:02:00,671 --> 03:02:01,330
extract them,

6930
03:02:01,330 --> 03:02:05,590
the minerals that they use to make
them the batteries and the lithium.

6931
03:02:06,010 --> 03:02:10,750
Lithium comes from a a lot of like the
comp conflict minerals that comes from a

6932
03:02:10,751 --> 03:02:14,530
lot of like really poor areas or
people are forced to mind these things.

6933
03:02:14,531 --> 03:02:15,940
They have no other way to make money.

6934
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:20,470
There had been a bunch of articles read
all shits made pretty much cell phones

6935
03:02:20,471 --> 03:02:21,330
say that about everything.

6936
03:02:21,380 --> 03:02:23,680
Here's the thing is is cell
phones like cell phones,

6937
03:02:23,710 --> 03:02:26,090
like cold Chan that
they use to make sense?

6938
03:02:26,110 --> 03:02:26,800
Is that how you call it?

6939
03:02:26,800 --> 03:02:27,550
Cold Tan?

6940
03:02:27,550 --> 03:02:31,570
I think it's called Cold Tan is a mineral
that they use to make cell phones and

6941
03:02:31,571 --> 03:02:34,660
for the longest time at least it was
like a lot of it was being made in the

6942
03:02:34,661 --> 03:02:39,460
Congo and these people were essentially
almost slaves like minus stuff.

6943
03:02:39,461 --> 03:02:40,480
These little children,

6944
03:02:40,481 --> 03:02:42,870
these child workers to mine this stuff.

6945
03:02:42,970 --> 03:02:44,700
Their stuff though Colton,

6946
03:02:44,890 --> 03:02:46,540
conflict minerals in the Congo,

6947
03:02:46,541 --> 03:02:49,360
there's documentary has been done on this.

6948
03:02:49,361 --> 03:02:50,194
It's horrible.

6949
03:02:50,710 --> 03:02:51,670
So in the Congo,

6950
03:02:51,671 --> 03:02:52,471
this is one place.

6951
03:02:52,471 --> 03:02:55,390
It's particularly rich
with Colton and these poor,

6952
03:02:55,540 --> 03:02:55,991
poor,

6953
03:02:55,991 --> 03:02:56,801
poor people.

6954
03:02:56,801 --> 03:03:00,460
Like a level of poor that you and I just
will never understand and we need that

6955
03:03:00,461 --> 03:03:01,061
for our phones.

6956
03:03:01,061 --> 03:03:01,630
Yup,

6957
03:03:01,630 --> 03:03:01,990
Yup.

6958
03:03:01,990 --> 03:03:06,990
It's a key ingredient in a cell
phones and I think maybe laptops too,

6959
03:03:07,390 --> 03:03:08,620
but definitely cell phones.

6960
03:03:09,710 --> 03:03:10,541
It's fucked up,

6961
03:03:10,541 --> 03:03:11,374
dude.

6962
03:03:11,920 --> 03:03:12,281
You know?

6963
03:03:12,281 --> 03:03:12,730
It's just,

6964
03:03:12,730 --> 03:03:13,690
it's a weird thing,

6965
03:03:13,691 --> 03:03:13,991
man.

6966
03:03:13,991 --> 03:03:14,950
You got a phone,

6967
03:03:14,980 --> 03:03:15,400
right?

6968
03:03:15,400 --> 03:03:18,280
If you get a phone made by
any of these major companies,

6969
03:03:18,310 --> 03:03:23,310
a lot of them get made in China jumping
off the roof or are they just working?

6970
03:03:23,770 --> 03:03:24,001
What it,

6971
03:03:24,001 --> 03:03:24,880
what's going on right here?

6972
03:03:25,380 --> 03:03:26,213
They're getting paid.

6973
03:03:26,260 --> 03:03:28,210
They're getting paid very little money.

6974
03:03:28,480 --> 03:03:29,680
The thing is to us,

6975
03:03:29,681 --> 03:03:33,220
a compared to other people that
have the standard pay out there,

6976
03:03:33,221 --> 03:03:33,820
right?

6977
03:03:33,820 --> 03:03:35,290
Maybe you don't.

6978
03:03:35,300 --> 03:03:36,640
Maybe they're happy to have a job.

6979
03:03:36,820 --> 03:03:38,320
They're probably the
handing of themselves.

6980
03:03:38,321 --> 03:03:39,154
Like in China.

6981
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:42,340
I don't know how to put up a net.

6982
03:03:42,341 --> 03:03:45,820
So many people are jumping on that
were just sifting through the gravel,

6983
03:03:46,130 --> 03:03:48,880
Chilean headphones on
listening to podcast.

6984
03:03:48,881 --> 03:03:50,200
People die doing it all the time.

6985
03:03:50,201 --> 03:03:50,291
Yeah.

6986
03:03:50,291 --> 03:03:52,150
They listening to like how stuff works.

6987
03:03:53,690 --> 03:03:55,590
Just K.

6988
03:03:55,590 --> 03:03:56,423

no,

6992
03:03:58,971 --> 03:04:00,170
this is not how it goes.

6993
03:04:01,050 --> 03:04:01,450
I'm shoes.

6994
03:04:01,450 --> 03:04:04,430
I mean knee deep in mud
right now looking for this.

6995
03:04:04,640 --> 03:04:05,473
Let me call you back.

6996
03:04:07,630 --> 03:04:10,010

6997

I'm going to Piss so bad.

6998
03:04:11,180 --> 03:04:12,230

6999
03:04:12,290 --> 03:04:13,850
