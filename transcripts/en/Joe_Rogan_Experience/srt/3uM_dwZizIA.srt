1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,010
Well,
good experience my day,

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,020
Joe Rogan podcast,
my name is Byrd crusher.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,490
He's a mother fucking world traveler on 
like any other and even if he stops 

4
00:00:22,681 --> 00:00:27,360
doing this travel channel Gig,
he will be more traveled than any of you

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:30,510
folks.
You've essentially,

6
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:35,511
you've traveled way more than the 
average person ever will in their life 

7
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:35,511
just in the last few years

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,210
if you just talk about this stuff I've 
done on a daily basis.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:43,380
We talked about this at one day you 
called me and you said,

10
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:43,990
what are you doing?
I said,

11
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:47,440
I'm driving an old Russian motorcycle 
through rice paddies and Vietnam.

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,990
And you were like,
kind of talk about that on stage.

13
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,490
Like,
yeah,

14
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,650
you do.
I'm annoying as fuck a party if anyone's

15
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:53,830
like,
oh,

16
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:54,880
we went zip lining.
I was like,

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:59,890
fuck fucking zip lining.
I did one 20 on flight lines outside of 

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:00:59,890
Vegas,
almost broke my fucking knees.

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,460
And they're like,
Huh.

20
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,980
So I almost broke your knees,
your knees.

21
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,830
So these,
um,

22
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,790
these flight lines are basically a zip 
lines on steroids.

23
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:14,791
They're massive cables and then massive 
rigs and you have to control your body 

24
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:19,350
in the wind so that you don't go over a 
hundred miles an hour because it's 

25
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,050
really hard to stop you.
However,

26
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,930
if the winds are bad,
they'll cancel them.

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,940
We were already up into the hike.
Six miles.

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,940
You take the hike all the way through 
Ziploc flight line than hike.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You hike for six miles.
You're like all fucking day flight line,

30
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:38,071
a mile and a half and then hiked to the 
next flight line than flight line two 

31
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:38,080
miles.
They're long.

32
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,840
They're fucking gangster there in 
Bootleg Canyon in Vegas.

33
00:01:40,841 --> 00:01:42,070
Go outside and do them.
They're amazing.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,800
How long is the ride?
The rides?

35
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:48,510
Probably a minute and a half minute,
ma'am.

36
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,170
You're flying.
You're fucking flying.

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,600
When a bug hits your face,
it hurts.

38
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,160
It hurts to get hit in the face,
but hidden fucking bugs by bugs.

39
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,210
A walk.
I'm going to use a goose.

40
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,560
I think about that constantly.
Large fucking angry bird having to Fabio

41
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,480
what?
Yeah.

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Fuck.
You don't know if it was riding roller 

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,500
coasters in New Jersey and a fucking 
single hit him in the face and broke his

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:08,500
nose.
No,

45
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:13,710
just type in.
Just type in Fabio Goose fucking 

46
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:13,710
rollercoaster.

47
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,200
God,
my father,

48
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:19,470
God's tired of seeing all of his 
favorite romance novels were fucking 

49
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:19,470
Fabio and the cover.
That's what it was.

50
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,180
Everyone Fabio used to pose for those 
romance covers.

51
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,840
Romance books.
We're so fucking strange because they 

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,770
were like men that didn't truly exist in
nature.

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,920
It's like,
I think that's probably where like 

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:34,920
monitors came from,
the idea of a man.

55
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,440
It was like half worse.
That's mandatory,

56
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:37,140
right?
Yeah.

57
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,330
Where was the house fun be.
Oh,

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,640
you got crushed.
So.

59
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:43,240
Wow.

60
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,460
So yeah,
I think about getting hit by bugs and 

61
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,460
fucking

62
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:48,720
I see it.
There's no actual video of the,

63
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,280
uh,
the goose hitting him in the face.

64
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,710
What are the do just as tired of not 
getting attention.

65
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:55,710
So he just wailed on his own nose 
consumption.

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,690
We all make a deal here.
This is a goose that hit my face smacked

67
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,760
of every fucking anyway.
In any of your.

68
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:08,800
Everyone was no romance novels would be 
this long haired guy who was super 

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,591
romantic.
It was essentially like a morph between 

70
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:16,051
a man and a woman.
It was like a woman's desire for 

71
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:17,140
Amanda's six,
one like beautiful,

72
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,290
handsome and blond man with this long 
luxurious mane of hair and he was always

73
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,440
like holding her.
Like she was like,

74
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,680
she was just going limp and he was 
holding her body weight and that's what 

75
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:31,680
sold the book.
Yeah.

76
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:31,750
Oh fuck.
Yeah.

77
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,760
Because he did other authors.
He didn't just do one author and that 

78
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,190
would sell the book.
Fabio would sell the fucking book and it

79
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,230
wasn't even a picture of it.
It was just a drawing is a drawing of 

80
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:44,731
like a Fabio ass character.
I wonder if he would like Kim 

81
00:03:44,731 --> 00:03:48,300
Kardashians sued because some,
there was some character and some 

82
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,300
commercial that looked like her.
So she sued,

83
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,110
you know,
like I,

84
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,310
I guess they contacted her and she 
didn't want to do it.

85
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Was that a why?
But it was that William shatner 

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,281
commercial.
There was a William Shatner commercial 

87
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,171
where Kim Kardashians comes rolling in 
like a karate martial and has like 

88
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:01,171
leathers on it.
Look,

89
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:06,091
I thought it was Kim Kardashian,
Kim Kardashian video game that she had 

90
00:04:06,091 --> 00:04:07,450
nothing to do with at first.
Uh,

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,270
and then she sued them and now she's 
making shitloads of money off that game

92
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,340
that an app is a little different.
I mean,

93
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,370
this is a,
she sued last year for $20 million 

94
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,150
because there was a woman in a,
in a,

95
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,090
in a commercial.
The chick's name is,

96
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:29,091
it's an old navy commercial.
The woman's name is Melissa Moe and 

97
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:32,240
narrow.
And she sued because they looked like 

98
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,450
his friends with Melissa.
Okay.

99
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,610
Well she's that musician girl.
Right?

100
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,070
I know there's probably a lot of girls 
named Melissa.

101
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,580
I think that's fair.
I don't know.

102
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:42,600
Why don't you google it?
You got it.

103
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,040
It was actually a deck loaded.
Melissa Mayer narrows.

104
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,700
Including a senator's assistant.

105
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:52,190
Yeah.
There's probably quite a few of those 

106
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,190
girls with that name.
Do you know that girl?

107
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,840
She does look like Kim Kardashians.
Yeah,

108
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,890
a little bit.
Yeah.

109
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,300
I mean,
she looks like her a little bit,

110
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:58,320
but how,
I mean,

111
00:04:58,321 --> 00:05:00,240
what.
No girls with dark hair or allowed to be

112
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:01,620
on TV anymore.
Is that what's going on?

113
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,460
We have to pretend that every girl with 
dark hair is pretending to be you.

114
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:07,950
How fucking egotistical.
He's stealing her essence though.

115
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:09,210
But that's insane.
Look,

116
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:12,360
if someone comes along and creates like 
a Bert Kreischer,

117
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:17,361
wild,
crazy guy with a beard who drinks and 

118
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:18,150
gets.
You can't see that guy.

119
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,330
That's like,
that's an archetype that's existed 

120
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:23,330
before the,
the how,

121
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,790
you know,
the simple minded gal who was 

122
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,000
materialists who just wants to take 
photographs.

123
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,980
That's not a,
this isn't a new thing.

124
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,770
You know?
She is actually on a desk squad podcast.

125
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:33,450
I had that same girl.
You got sued?

126
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:34,350
Yeah.
As long ago.

127
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,380
Was this,
this was a three.

128
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,960
19,
2011 with me and Nestor and Melissa Mall

129
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,520
there.
Oh,

130
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,620
so it was before she got sued because 
she got sued.

131
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:48,621
It says here in August of 2012 was crazy
shit.

132
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,550
Yeah,
but it was like what I thought of doing 

133
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:54,550
a.
I thought of a.

134
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,560
We were doing a episode for triplepundit
Ella and I was thinking about getting 

135
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:58,560
um,
look alikes,

136
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,710
like composite person,
like,

137
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,510
like 30 of them and have them at a 
party.

138
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,620
So I was like,
hey,

139
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:06,320
you guys wanting to meet celebrities.
This is Michael Jackson.

140
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,750
And they'd be like,
they would,

141
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,670
I mean like they're from,
they're from Indiana.

142
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:13,020
They wouldn't know for like the first 
five minutes they'd meet like,

143
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,400
like we would start soft,
this is Katie Bell.

144
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,600
And they'd be like,
Whoa,

145
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,760
you know what you do do to get them 
drunk first.

146
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:25,660
Celebrities all come out of a room 
together was like,

147
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:30,530
what if he got Hitler really loaded it 
with ridiculous.

148
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:34,610
You have to give him an acid.
This is Jimmy Hendrix.

149
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:39,670
So anyway,
so he got hit in the nose by doc and 

150
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:39,670
fucked him up.

151
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:43,990
So you,
you were on these things and you're 

152
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:43,990
actually worried about getting hit.
Oh Yo.

153
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,490
Definitely 100% worried about Ken does 
no precautions,

154
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:46,940
right?
You don't wear.

155
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:49,310
I do wear a helmet or anything.
You got your all,

156
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,060
you're in like a big five point harness 
and then you'd just go fly in.

157
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,350
He's pushing a rock your body like 
you're supposed to literally go out like

158
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:58,280
this and for sometimes they'll put a 
parachute behind you to slow you down.

159
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,560
Lord,
the weather changed on us and I was 

160
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,641
getting nervous because it's lightening 
and you're on these big steel platforms 

161
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:06,641
in Vegas,
in the middle of the desert.

162
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,970
And I was like,
I was like,

163
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:08,420
fuck it.
I'm going,

164
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm going,
I'm going right now.

165
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:10,460
And they're like,
well maybe we should.

166
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:11,060
I was like,
fuck it.

167
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:16,061
And I was already locked in and the guy 
sent me of the winds picked up behind 

168
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:16,061
me.

169
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:17,330
So they started pushing me and I came in
hot as fuck.

170
00:07:17,331 --> 00:07:22,331
I mean,
you have like these big stoppers that 

171
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:22,331
are supposed to stop you.
I blew through all of them,

172
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:24,800
blew through the emergency one and went 
up into the rigging.

173
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,570
I just remembered someone at the very 
beginning of the day say,

174
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:33,080
renting passingly when in doubt legs 
out.

175
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,990
And so like when in doubt,
throw your legs out,

176
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,430
looks pretty legs.
And I just,

177
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:42,660
that's what I thought to myself.
I spread my fucking legs and I want to 

178
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,960
put the rigging rack my balls,
like fucking hit my tank.

179
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I thought I broke my Cox's come out and 
then I shoot like here's the worst part 

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,300
is I shoot back because you went into 
the rigging.

181
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,260
I shot back 150 feet into the fucking 
out into the valley.

182
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,300
And I was like,
fucking stuck there.

183
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,700
And the guy had to come out and I'm 
fucking,

184
00:07:58,701 --> 00:08:01,370
oh Jesus.
So I come in and the guy's like,

185
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:02,840
he's like,
man,

186
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:07,930
you have no fucking idea how lucky you 
are that you just had your legs up and 

187
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:07,930
you have no fucking idea.
I was like,

188
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,090
really?
He's like,

189
00:08:08,091 --> 00:08:13,091
yeah,
you would've broken if I'd had them 

190
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:13,091
together.
I would've gone up.

191
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:16,600
My legs would have hit the rigging 
instead of me like straddling it and uh,

192
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,430
and I would have fucking shattered my 
legs easily.

193
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,880
Must have worried that it's going to 
shatter your hip.

194
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:25,460
The way you hit it.
It sounds like that's brutal.

195
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,290
I,
nothing happened to me.

196
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,390
And I know that sounds crazy,
but nothing happened to me,

197
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:33,000
but you just go and went up like this 
instead of like going on in,

198
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:37,130
breaking my legs like this and then pop 
down and then shut all the way back.

199
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,130
Okay.
So what it is is like as you're going 

200
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:42,130
down,
if your legs were in the way,

201
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:45,610
it'd be too much before the solid 
rigging hits the.

202
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,650
If your legs with your legs would've,
you would've hit the rigging.

203
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,100
But before the whole system does.
Yeah.

204
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,810
But instead it sounds ridiculous.
It's uh,

205
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:54,290
there's,
you know,

206
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,360
I look to the level of chance and all 
these things I do,

207
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,420
like,
it's the simplest ones where you get 

208
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,761
hurt.
The only times I've been hurt was on a 

209
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,191
blog and Texas.
It's like a big inflatable kind of 

210
00:09:07,191 --> 00:09:11,220
mattress where they have filled with air
and you lay on the end and then some guy

211
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:14,220
jumps off a 30 foot dock and when he 
lands,

212
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:19,221
it's Einstein's theory of relativity.
Every action there is an opposite and 

213
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:22,941
equal reaction.
And you shoot up equally as high as he 

214
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:22,941
went versus his weight.

215
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:25,500
So if he's more than you,
do you compensate for that and you go up

216
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:27,720
in the air and you go into the water?
Fuck,

217
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,420
it's fucking insane.
But uh,

218
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,570
I didn't,
I felt myself flipping and I'm not like 

219
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:35,970
a natural gymnast so I didn't want to 
flip.

220
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,210
So I started kicking my legs so I kicked
him as hard as I could and I kicked both

221
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,160
my hamstrings out.
Oh my God.

222
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,490
Fucking the most painful thing I've ever
found.

223
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,830
Both of them,
both of my hamstrings out.

224
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,640
Just don't know in the sense that,
uh,

225
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,010
I just didn't walk for like three weeks.
You couldn't walk for three good no walk

226
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,090
for three weeks.
They,

227
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,190
I couldn't.
I was in the water and I was literally 

228
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,940
holding my legs and it's a kids camp.
Always kids around me and I'm just 

229
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:04,940
holding my legs,
like in massive pain.

230
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,510
And they're like,
we need you to go again.

231
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:06,480
I go,
I can't go again.

232
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,600
And like,
they,

233
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,550
it doesn't look dangerous.
Do you need to go a couple of times with

234
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:16,551
these things to make sure that they've 
got the shot and they can get at 

235
00:10:16,551 --> 00:10:16,920
different angles.
So,

236
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:17,400
uh,
I was like,

237
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,750
I can't go.
And they were like,

238
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,751
are you fucking serious?
And they had to carry me to the firmer 

239
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:24,120
at this Christian youth camp.
I go into my bag,

240
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,310
take a handful of tenants because I 
mean,

241
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:27,690
it's,
I've never felt that pain in my life.

242
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Just have travel.
I traveled with nausea medicine and 

243
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
painkillers always because you never 
know if you get hurt and if you get hurt

244
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,290
in the middle of the outback in the 
middle of the Sahara,

245
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,730
you like,
if you get fucking.

246
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,830
So you get attacked by a fucking line 
and you're not going to die.

247
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,260
But you have a fucking six hour bumpy 
car ride in.

248
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,160
I want painkillers and I'm prepared.
Painkiller addiction.

249
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:47,680
No,
I don't know.

250
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,650
You know what?
Telling us about no painkiller addiction

251
00:10:49,651 --> 00:10:50,640
whatsoever.
They scare me.

252
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:52,080
However,
when you are hurt,

253
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:57,270
like when I believe that the hamstrings,
I grabbed two viking in pop them and I 

254
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,740
was manageable until they got me to the 
hospital.

255
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,710
But,
but I just sit and wait.

256
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:02,550
They had to fucking wait forever.
They had a prayer circle around me.

257
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,820
Prayer circle what kind of prayers?
Fucking Jesus being God's counsel 

258
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:12,160
counselor played along with him.
Of course he did write quotes,

259
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:16,970
learning realm because it's like,
look,

260
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,720
this looks like the guy from 30 rock 
that like the white blonde haired,

261
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:21,750
Nerdy Guy,
right?

262
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,380
He like all these kids around my,
around my bed.

263
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,690
And he goes,
are you all thinking what I'm thinking?

264
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:29,490
They were like,
yeah.

265
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,540
And he goes,
Bert,

266
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,100
do you mind if we bury on you?
And I said,

267
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:38,101
uh,
I was fucking out of it if I got into 

268
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:38,101
and hell,
I'm presuming.

269
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:38,101
And I was like,
fuck,

270
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:38,160
bring it.
So they,

271
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,240
they,
uh,

272
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,130
fuck,
bring it up.

273
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,260
I probably said sure,
I'd love that Carson.

274
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,340
So they form a circle so awkward because
I'm out of it and I like,

275
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,920
instead of the kids hands on my 
shoulders.

276
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,921
But I wanted to touch him,
so I grabbed his inner like thigh and 

277
00:11:58,921 --> 00:11:59,770
I'm holding the counselors hand and they
preyed on me,

278
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,130
but then they preyed on me and I prayed 
with them and it was awesome.

279
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:08,570
Dude.
Yeah.

280
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,560
I always have emergency like,
well these days when I've been traveling

281
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:16,561
abroad,
I always bring a little baby bottles of 

282
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,631
Jack Daniel's with me on my,
on the flights because a lot of these 

283
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:18,631
airlines don't serve alcohol.

284
00:12:18,631 --> 00:12:23,300
Do you go to places where alcohol is 
illegal in some Muslim countries where 

285
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,300
alcohol is illegal,
right?

286
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,990
Yeah.
It was just in Zanzibar.

287
00:12:23,991 --> 00:12:26,020
We can get alcohol and I didn't get much
alcohol.

288
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,810
Most Muslim countries,
uh,

289
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,130
even um,
even Dubai,

290
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,170
you can get it.
Yeah.

291
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,970
Get it in bars,
in bars it's like,

292
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,790
because they want to accommodate 
westerners and especially Europeans.

293
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:40,210
Europeans love to drink and they want to
be a tourist location.

294
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,980
That's the,
that's the big killers.

295
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:46,981
A lot of these large Muslim investors 
are going into Muslim countries like 

296
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:49,600
Zanzibar and buying up hotels,
but they're not comfortable with alcohol

297
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:54,601
and new and like bathing suits and some 
of the most beautiful hotels in all of 

298
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,760
East Africa are just Muslim owned and 
they,

299
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,170
they're vacant,
they're dead.

300
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:01,150
There's nothing but lizards.
Wow.

301
00:13:01,151 --> 00:13:02,500
Because nobody wants to go into play.
Well,

302
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:07,501
that's good.
No market dictates your ideas are 

303
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:07,501
stupid.

304
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:10,780
Chicks wear bikinis.
How dare you said no haters.

305
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,390
They had a sports bar and the one we 
were in and I said,

306
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,880
I'll take a heineken and the manager 
came up to me so you know,

307
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,700
we're a Muslim hotel,
we don't serve alcohol.

308
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,380
And I was like,
if it's a sports bar,

309
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,470
you changed the name of it.
Just don't say it.

310
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,250
The sport is.
I thought I read sports bar.

311
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,960
What did they say to that?
She goes,

312
00:13:25,961 --> 00:13:27,790
uh,
she looks at me and goes,

313
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,200
what do you want?
And I said,

314
00:13:29,201 --> 00:13:31,690
I want like appearance goes for the,
for the night.

315
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:32,730
I said,
I want to 12 pack.

316
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,580
She goes,
me,

317
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,550
me in your room,
and 10 came.

318
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,590
Nobody came back to my room,
sec,

319
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,610
don't take them out of your room so she 
can smell that.

320
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,580
He had bought the.
He bought the hotel within,

321
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,290
I would say within weeks of what?

322
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,890
Of US booking the entire trip and so 
they still had a stock of alcohol,

323
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:57,600
so it was just changing over.
Was just changing over to a Muslim 

324
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,720
hotel.
He took the chance though,

325
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,300
Dude.
I've had known that.

326
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,440
I would've never fucking say they're not
in a million.

327
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:02,880
Fuck.
No,

328
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,990
I mean it was empty.
It was like having the place to yourself

329
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,560
is really because no one was at.
No one would go there and if they are 

330
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,990
there and they're Muslim,
they're not in the pool.

331
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,680
So the pool to myself,
it was crazy.

332
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,380
When I was in Japan,
they made me cover up my tattoos.

333
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,450
Japan's fucking weird like that.
Right.

334
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,810
Did you go to any of the big subways in 
Japan or any of the big train stations?

335
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,200
Fucking silent.
It will talk to each other.

336
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,360
Like,
I have a video on my phone.

337
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:30,340
It's probably my computer of me sitting 
at the.

338
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:35,340
At what is their times square in Tokyo 
at rush hour at like 8:00

339
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,550
AM in the morning,
6:00

340
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:36,950
AM,
7:00

341
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,740
AM in the morning,
not a fucking word.

342
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,750
You don't hear a word.
And I,

343
00:14:40,751 --> 00:14:45,751
I was,
it was so eerie and I just kept looking 

344
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:45,751
at my crew and no one's talking to each 
other.

345
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:46,990
Now we're not talking to each other 
because no one's talking.

346
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,520
It's that.
It's that law of,

347
00:14:48,521 --> 00:14:50,080
you know,
whatever dictates.

348
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,430
I heard about it on some podcasts about,
you know,

349
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,790
this guy,
this guy walked into an elevator and 

350
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:57,790
stood with the guy and the other way was
facing the wrong direction.

351
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:01,991
We went and looked at him.
Then it stops and someone comes in 

352
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:01,991
phases while direction again.
He's was like,

353
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:02,810
Huh?
And then after the third person,

354
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,570
when that they face the wrong direction,
the guy who was facing the fucking doors

355
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,320
went fuck it.

356
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,080
And he just turned around because you 
get into that assimilation.

357
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,550
Wow.
Yeah.

358
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,810
But uh,
it was crazy.

359
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,600
Japan was a mind blowing.
I did.

360
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:19,310
You like the toilets fucking blob them.
Why don't they have those everywhere.

361
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:24,080
You actually sent them to me after I 
talked about it.

362
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,380
They're amazing.
You have during your house too?

363
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,290
Yeah.
You can get them.

364
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,070
You can buy them on Amazon.
You get them online.

365
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,850
It was the greatest.
I don't have them everywhere.

366
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,680
I would just wake up in the morning and 
just cleaned my asshole.

367
00:15:36,681 --> 00:15:40,130
Just sit on it and turn it on,
put on some tunes and warming up.

368
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,650
I rented a beach house.
It had one too.

369
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:42,710
It was Gloria,
so I was like,

370
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:47,711
yes they do is they do have one proper 
feels oddly pleasurable.

371
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,430
Yeah.
Yeah,

372
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,040
we did.
We did.

373
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,200
We hung out with the Geisha for the 
night.

374
00:15:55,010 --> 00:16:00,010
Dude,
you've been all over the world like 

375
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:00,010
legitimately these things.
You do.

376
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,091
Those scare the shit out of me when I 
hear your zip lining a hundred miles an 

377
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:04,091
hour.
Oh,

378
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,160
oh yeah.
It's some of it.

379
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:07,970
You know.
Here's the deal.

380
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,600
I do a panic.
Everyone knows that.

381
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:14,601
I've talked about that to everyone,
but it's hilarious that you deal with 

382
00:16:14,601 --> 00:16:16,160
panic and yet you do some truly 
terrifying shit.

383
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:21,230
Oh Dude.
I just jumped off of Moses and the 

384
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,230
stadium.
It's 500.

385
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,720
Take a look at this.
Joe.

386
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,330
This is me jumping off Moses from beetle
stadium and send this to Jamie.

387
00:16:26,331 --> 00:16:28,400
Can we play it on the show?
Just from the.

388
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,120
It's from the show and the show itself.

389
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:31,300
Yeah.

390
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,900
Oh my God.
Yeah.

391
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:34,410
Yeah.

392
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,750
Jesus Christ.
Dude.

393
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:42,610
It's fucking 500 feet.
It's a piece of a fucking jump.

394
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,100
How many different trips like this have 
you gone on since we started this show?

395
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,260
You've been doing the show for like 
what?

396
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,730
Four years now or something?
Four years.

397
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:53,731
Have Gone on those with 14 times four.
So 50 God damn.

398
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,300
60 of them probably 60 plus a crazy 
three adventures a day or two.

399
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,570
I feel like I've done everything there 
is to do when it comes to adrenaline.

400
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,720
So yeah,
each episode you're doing numerous 

401
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:09,720
things sometimes,
right?

402
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,470
Dude,
we've had days where you were like that 

403
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,490
the other day in a Michigan I fucking.
And then you have like these things that

404
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,900
you don't want me to talk about like 
we're missing.

405
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,430
This guy flies us out to a mackinaw 
island.

406
00:17:18,431 --> 00:17:20,250
It's like a hour flight.
It's not that the three,

407
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,800
three hour or an hour flight,
a three minute flight,

408
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:25,290
so it's not that big of a flight.

409
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,300
So real quick jump and we meet the guy 
flying over.

410
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,280
I'd tell them I'm afraid to fly in.
We land.

411
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:34,310
Next morning he comes to pick us up.
We'd spend the night on the islands 

412
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,310
snowplow,
what comes back and he says to me,

413
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,560
hey,
you want to fly?

414
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:37,540
So what?
He goes,

415
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,040
I'm an instructor.
I'll show you how to do it.

416
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,630
I got my two travelers with me.
You're like,

417
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:41,800
no,
don't let perfect get fly.

418
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,480
But in my head I'm like,
now I get the same thing that happens 

419
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,480
with me on these jumps and all that 
other stuff is where you go,

420
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,860
fuck,
I gotta try it like I,

421
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm,
it's there.

422
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,200
This is a once in a life time 
opportunity.

423
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,790
I got to fucking try it.
So I'm like,

424
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:54,450
fuck it,
let's do it.

425
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,510
So we've taxi down the runway and he 
gets us to the position.

426
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,510
He was all right.
I just want to throttle and as we start 

427
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,290
to feel lyft just start pulling back and
we just fucking take off and I've pulled

428
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:09,291
back and I'm like,
he goes and you get up to like 3000 

429
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:09,291
feet,
and he's like,

430
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,081
all right,
2000 piece level it off and you just 

431
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:12,081
start pushing forward and you feel the 
plane land.

432
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:14,940
It was fucking amazing.
But those,

433
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:15,640
uh,
you know,

434
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,890
those are the ones aren't even on the 
show.

435
00:18:16,891 --> 00:18:20,610
That's just getting the special access.
It's been great.

436
00:18:20,611 --> 00:18:25,611
It's been great.
I've been having a hard time talking 

437
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:25,611
about it on stage because it sounds 
alienating.

438
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:27,150
No,
I don't think so at all.

439
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,560
You know,
that's like a,

440
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:32,340
that's a hangup.
Like you're not an alienating guy in any

441
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,110
way,
just you,

442
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:38,150
you feel like it's alienating because 
you're a humble guy because like you 

443
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,700
worry,
that might sound braggy,

444
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,950
but it's just your life,
you know,

445
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,930
you're alive is interesting as fuck 
dude.

446
00:18:42,931 --> 00:18:44,400
I mean,
you're doing some crazy shit.

447
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:46,770
Every time I talked to you like I'm in a
shark tank in the middle of the ocean.

448
00:18:46,771 --> 00:18:47,400
I'm like,
no,

449
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:48,540
you're not.
No,

450
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,220
you're not.
Get out of that fucking thing.

451
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:53,070
We were with great white sharks.
The fuck man,

452
00:18:53,071 --> 00:18:54,210
you can't be doing that itself.

453
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:59,410
Africa and the fucking the visibility we
shit so,

454
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,870
so they were there.
They would draw them in with a big tuna 

455
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:07,590
head and then they would start up here.
The shark would just appear shark attack

456
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,720
attack.
We are simulating real shark attacks in 

457
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:13,720
that.
They just come up on the cage and just.

458
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:18,120
So I got frustrated and I was like,
I wanted to see where the shark was so I

459
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:19,470
could predict it grew,
scare me.

460
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,160
So I was sitting on top of the cage and 
I'm just sitting there.

461
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,560
We're looking for the shark and dude,
just like out of a fucking movie.

462
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,800
The shark leaps at the tuna head above 
the water and right at me and I shit in 

463
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,851
my wet suit.
I went fucking song and I was like 

464
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:35,640
panicked,
but it was an amazing experience.

465
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:38,130
Like 14 foot shark swimming right up on 
you.

466
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,240
You know,

467
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:41,070
dude,
I have a hard time hearing that.

468
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:45,180
I'm squirming in my chair and Shit.
There's a video that I tweeted today.

469
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:46,680
See if you can find it.
Um,

470
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,780
there's a guy who's poking at this roof 
is a leopard that's trapped in the,

471
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,680
in the roof in India.
It looks like it's an India where they 

472
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:57,680
do have a problem with leopards and it 
has.

473
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,730
This guy is trying to open this thing 
up.

474
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:04,731
This fucking leopard head pops out of 
this little hole because it's small and 

475
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:09,470
the leopard burst through the fucking 
roof and starts attacking these people 

476
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:14,270
and they're freaking out and trying to 
run away and they're trying to hit it 

477
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,580
with sticks and it runs into this guy 
and this guy fucking pants.

478
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,910
It's like this crazy leopard running 
around the street.

479
00:20:17,911 --> 00:20:19,300
Here's a video of it,
Charlie.

480
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,250
Shit,
fucking kidding me.

481
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,770
Fucking dude is on the roof.
Okay.

482
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:27,771
So look,
there's holes in the roof and he's like 

483
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:27,771
trying to figure out,
look at this.

484
00:20:27,771 --> 00:20:30,891
Oh,
shut the fuck comes out of the roof and 

485
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:30,891
gets after.
Oh,

486
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:30,891
oh.

487
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:36,460
It looks like a lion,
a leopard to big ass leopard spots on 

488
00:20:38,061 --> 00:20:38,930
it.
God.

489
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:41,240
Holy.
I mean,

490
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:43,490
it's not very high res,
but it appears to be a leopard.

491
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:44,120
Right?
Oh look,

492
00:20:44,121 --> 00:20:48,130
that guy's holding the door shut in my.
Is that a tiger?

493
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,570
It's so hard to tell because it's 
blurry,

494
00:20:52,571 --> 00:20:56,350
but it looks to me like it's small and 
it's fast as fuck.

495
00:20:56,351 --> 00:20:59,980
Which leopards are fast as fuck.
Super aggressive.

496
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:04,030
Leopards are super aggressive.
Got Damn Dude.

497
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,530
Fuck all this.
Right.

498
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:10,710
I mean I react the way that guy did with
the leopard when a mouse in the house 

499
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,630
almost like can't stabilize your fee

500
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:13,980
man.
Yeah,

501
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,750
that's elaborate for sure.
So it's hiding back there.

502
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,260
Is that what it's doing or is it killing
somebody?

503
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,330
I think they trapped it.
I don't know,

504
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,370
man.
It might have somebody in its jaws

505
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:28,060
size,
font size,

506
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,420
looking up.
Fuck all that man back in the house.

507
00:21:32,421 --> 00:21:36,920
What kind of workout comes through?
It's his house man.

508
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,000
As far as he's concerned,

509
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:41,050
give a fuck.
They don't have any idea about like,

510
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,380
Yo,
this guy has a mortgage.

511
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,570
Like that shit doesn't mean anything to 
a leopard.

512
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,530
If he finds a good spot behind a wall,
that's his house,

513
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,160
bitch,
come take it.

514
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,540
You're not a lion.
Get out of here that they're fucking 

515
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,141
terrifying.
There was a crazy video of apparently 

516
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,950
that happens in some parts of India all 
the time and there was a crazy,

517
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:04,060
a video or a series of images rather 
have this,

518
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:06,890
a guy who had a scalp removed by this 
leopard.

519
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,980
This leopard literally clause the dude's
head.

520
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:12,350
His scalp comes off like a flap.

521
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,650
You find that news?
He said he's fine.

522
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,980
He's got all stitched up.
Just got a cool story,

523
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,130
but look at the size of the flap and you
realize,

524
00:22:26,131 --> 00:22:31,131
oh,
these guys have razor blades on their 

525
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:31,131
fingers.
It's like it just sliced them like a,

526
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:34,830
like a fucking perfect meat knife and it
all takes his.

527
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,050
A scent of some perfume they don't like 
or you know what I mean?

528
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,170
Like,
but they're so.

529
00:22:40,171 --> 00:22:41,600
They're so unpredictable.
Yeah.

530
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:44,370
Fuck leopards.
Fuck Jaguars leopards.

531
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,710
I wouldn't mind having a one of those 
big savannah cats.

532
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,850
Well,
it was like,

533
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,950
dude,
just like five of them to run my back 

534
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,950
yard.
He'd growl at you.

535
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,300
I liked that shit.
I just want something to on my chest in 

536
00:23:00,541 --> 00:23:02,520
the morning,
like John Jones,

537
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:06,080
couple of those bangles,
one of those types of cats.

538
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,270
He's he,
he's got them as instagram all times.

539
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,320
He's really big.
He takes him wear them on the road 

540
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,200
because you have to like really like 
bond with them.

541
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,120
You have to bond with them.
So he takes them with him.

542
00:23:17,121 --> 00:23:22,121
Like when he goes to places to train and
we show it goes on like press trips and 

543
00:23:22,121 --> 00:23:23,860
shit like that.
Really took it to his hotel in La.

544
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,750
He brings that thing with them.
John John is eccentric.

545
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:27,420
It's fun.
Fuck

546
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,250
you.
Gotta be.

547
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:34,220
He's eccentric as fuck.
He brings a giant cat with him 

548
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,610
everywhere.
She takes a walk.

549
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,200
And Elise.
Yeah.

550
00:23:37,201 --> 00:23:39,750
This is the guys look at the top of his 
head.

551
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,890
Come on son.
I see that.

552
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,060
Welcome to the world.
Welcome to the world.

553
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,470
Scalped him,
man.

554
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:52,730
I mean that's like some cartoon shit and
so terrifying.

555
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,520
That thing is you ever cut off the tip 
of your finger and then you just kind of

556
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:57,110
push it back on and just hope it just 
stays.

557
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,470
That never happens.
Never happens.

558
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,810
Yeah,
that's the guy.

559
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,410
That's what I would've done.
Just put it back on and be like,

560
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,420
it doesn't happen.
Well,

561
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,620
they stitched that bitch back up,
but who knows if it took,

562
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:11,670
you know,
when you get a cut that big sometimes 

563
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:14,030
like the blood supply is compromised,
you can get infected kind of guy that if

564
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:17,370
you lost the tip of your pinky finger 
that it would affect you or does it just

565
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,270
become who you are and then that's a 
badge of like,

566
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,670
like there's guys like that's like one 
of,

567
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,680
like as far as people,
the last is that some people have 

568
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:29,680
encouraged me.

569
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,160
That's pretty God damn small.
I think you take it like a man and you 

570
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:33,620
just move on and if it comes up and go 
have hell.

571
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,070
My pinky finger tip of my pinky finger,
I'd be like,

572
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:39,250
I'd be fucking heartbroken.
What'd you really?

573
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,810
But yeah,
it'd be get over it,

574
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:43,970
but she live in America.
These people in India,

575
00:24:43,971 --> 00:24:48,971
they're fighting.
Giant cats are popping into the fucking 

576
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:48,971
shitty house.
Their house has holes in it.

577
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:50,700
The cat's claw through.
Those aren't even the cobras.

578
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,510
Cobras,
all over everything,

579
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:54,400
all kinds of shit.
How about tigers?

580
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:58,160
I bought this places in India where over
the last 200 years,

581
00:24:58,161 --> 00:25:00,590
300,000
people had been killed by tigers.

582
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,280
Tigers.
I fuck with lions,

583
00:25:04,281 --> 00:25:07,970
but I wouldn't fuck with tigers.
This is the muscle aries thing to try to

584
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:12,740
save him.
It's so important that we make sure that

585
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:17,741
we keep a healthy population of machines
running to the fucking jungle that eat 

586
00:25:18,891 --> 00:25:23,891
people.
Let's make sure we keep them alive 

587
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,530
there.
Super important because without them 

588
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:26,530
alive,
we will be so sad.

589
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:30,290
We lost the monsters.
Monsters that were fucking crazy like 

590
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:33,941
that.
Do you ever hear a concordance joke 

591
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:33,941
about polar bears?
No.

592
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:38,370
No.
I have already alerted trying to save 

593
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,370
the polar bears.
Polar bears.

594
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:38,690
Are you fucking kidding me?
Let me tell you something.

595
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,000
If a polar bear came to this room,
you'd be throwing.

596
00:25:41,001 --> 00:25:44,250
Your fucking chair is so true.
Horrible.

597
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,660
Quit cop show.
What is it?

598
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:50,240
It's on.
It's on LTV.

599
00:25:50,241 --> 00:25:54,710
I think it's really good.
It is really good.

600
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:56,570
It's Colin Quinn Chapel.
It's a Colin Quinn.

601
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,810
It's a d.
it's like a documentary about a cop show

602
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:02,090
and column.
Quinn plays the lead cop,

603
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,700
but he's.
It's a documentary about his TV show and

604
00:26:04,701 --> 00:26:07,150
it is fucking hilarious.
Oh,

605
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:10,700
so my documentary documentary,
and if you like Colin Quinn,

606
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,790
if you like quantum code a little bit,
you're going to lose your fucking mind.

607
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:16,970
He is so God damn cop show.
It's called cop show.

608
00:26:16,971 --> 00:26:19,860
He's got and he's got guests on.
He had A.

609
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,140
Jerry Seinfeld was one of the ones that 
I saw.

610
00:26:21,141 --> 00:26:24,260
Jim Norton.
I'm Keith.

611
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:27,830
Keith Robinson is on all of them.
You pay to the places buddy.

612
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,590
I think he's like a very 
underappreciated talent.

613
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:33,320
Conklin dude.
I really do.

614
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,870
I think he's like two people that are 
intelligent.

615
00:26:35,871 --> 00:26:40,871
He's fucking brilliant.
But to just really stupid people like 

616
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:41,420
that shit ain't even funny.
Like they,

617
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:46,450
there's,
there's a lot of stupid people that on 

618
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:46,450
his twitter,

619
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:46,880
like they miss all the jokes,
like if,

620
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:49,020
you know his style of humor,
you know,

621
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:52,800
how he's like,
he's observed but barely,

622
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:55,140
you know,
to the point where like he's,

623
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:57,930
he's obviously fucking with you,
but he's doing it cleverly,

624
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,350
you know,
and when he does it's like if you know 

625
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,350
collins type of humor and you're a fan 
of his,

626
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,070
it becomes really,
really funny.

627
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,470
It's like he's patrolling everyone on 
the Internet.

628
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,990
Jay Moore does a fucking fantastic.
Colin,

629
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:13,320
his columns.
Creepy down point.

630
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,650
Collins a unique dude.
He's,

631
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,660
I really feel like he's underappreciated
because he's been around a long goddamn 

632
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,530
time.
He was on tv back when fucking he was on

633
00:27:22,531 --> 00:27:23,940
remote control,
wasn't he?

634
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,660
He was on TV when I was in high school.
Yeah.

635
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:28,800
And I'm an old man.
Yeah,

636
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:33,801
he was on TV when I was an open mic or 
I'm pretty sure I remember him being on 

637
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:35,010
TV.
He's been around a long time.

638
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,090
We did a,
we did an episode but trip flip with 

639
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:42,071
Colin Quinn.
He was on it and what we were going to 

640
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:42,071
have people to stand up and so we said,
what we'll do.

641
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:42,071
I said,
call,

642
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,100
I'll give you the mic and then I'll put 
an ifb and our guys here and then you 

643
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,800
just tell them the jokes to say and 
he'll say I'm right.

644
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,830
I was like,
perfect.

645
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:49,700
So I was like,
all right,

646
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:54,701
let's test it out.
So we put this kid in the room and 

647
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:54,701
calling the other room and I go,
all right,

648
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:58,691
let's go.
And we had completely forgotten that 

649
00:27:58,691 --> 00:27:59,600
Colin Quinn is so fucking funny that 
when you hear him talk,

650
00:27:59,601 --> 00:28:00,940
you'll fall apart laughing.
Right?

651
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,990
So the kid couldn't say anything because
he's just doubled over.

652
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,540
I was like,
what he was doing was making fun of me.

653
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:08,620
He's like,
what's this guy?

654
00:28:08,621 --> 00:28:10,840
An extra wwf wrestler.
What's up with the beard?

655
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:16,650
Just destroying me calling.
I think con tough crowd is one of my 

656
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:16,840
favorite shows ever.

657
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,990
No.
Keith Robinson and I'm rich Vos and 

658
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:25,101
Bonnie Mcfarlane.
We're talking about that the other day 

659
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:25,101
on their podcast,
it was on why?

660
00:28:25,101 --> 00:28:26,850
It might have been their show.
They were on Xm,

661
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,440
but they were,
uh,

662
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:33,560
they were talking and you're taking 
calls and stuff and they were talking 

663
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,190
about how like,
there's a different kind of mentality,

664
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,500
at least in La,
at the clubs,

665
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,530
all the mean comics have died off like 
that.

666
00:28:40,531 --> 00:28:41,900
Fun,
mean Shit.

667
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:42,810
Well,
you don't really mean it,

668
00:28:42,811 --> 00:28:44,520
but it's hilarious just tearing each 
other apart.

669
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,480
That stuff has died off for some reason 
and it's been replaced by.

670
00:28:48,481 --> 00:28:53,481
Bonnie said it best.
She said it was like an acting class 

671
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,920
sort of a vibe that every good to see 
you.

672
00:28:55,921 --> 00:28:58,500
I really enjoyed you on this.
I really thought you were me.

673
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,170
She goes,
it's like this weird alt crowd is coming

674
00:29:01,171 --> 00:29:06,171
over and he's like this air of phoniness
about at all that you get from like 

675
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:10,600
acting class and like acting classes 
filled with people that are trying to 

676
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,370
like posture them.

677
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:13,740
Someone's real actress too.
But you know what I'm saying?

678
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,630
There's a few people in every fucking 
acting class that are trying really hard

679
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:23,631
to become that stereotypical 
prototypical California actor where they

680
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,520
don't say here's one of the things they 
don't say.

681
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,430
They don't say nice to meet you because 
they might already met you,

682
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,860
so they say good to see you.
Oh yes,

683
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,240
yes.
I'll say it.

684
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,240
They all fucking say you.
Listen.

685
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:41,330
You can't say that.
You can't say good to see you unless 

686
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:41,680
you've seen me again.
It's like good to see you again.

687
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,520
Oh again.

688
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,540
What is.
Where's the again?

689
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,550
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

690
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:47,530
It's good to see everything.
It's good and to not be blind.

691
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:49,830
I agree.
Good to see you.

692
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,900
Or you see me for the first time.
How many times you think you've seen me 

693
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,150
before?
How many times we met motherfucker.

694
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:57,060
Do you know me better?
So?

695
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,370
No,
no.

696
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,750
You don't know you're fucking fraud.
Imagine that you said.

697
00:30:01,751 --> 00:30:02,560
Yeah,
we met before.

698
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,780
Fuck.
We have never met before.

699
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,670
Good to see you.
What does that mean you noncommittal?

700
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,330
Fuck Dude.
At my kids' school.

701
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:15,350
They drop off.
I'm talking to my buddy John and some 

702
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,350
guy goes,
hey,

703
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,350
what's up?
Hey Chris.

704
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,510
My Buddy John was just talking to my 
buddy,

705
00:30:16,511 --> 00:30:19,310
John Girl.
Data happens all the time.

706
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,840
I've done that before.
And you go,

707
00:30:20,841 --> 00:30:22,700
oh no.
Did I say Steve File?

708
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,300
Have to tell them I know her.
I fucking hate that on probably think.

709
00:30:29,301 --> 00:30:34,301
I think to Steve,
that's why I call everyone blue for the 

710
00:30:34,301 --> 00:30:37,211
same reason because I'm fucking myself 
over so many times and when you fuck 

711
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:40,271
yourself over the wrong or Comedians,
they're always going to remember that 

712
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:40,820
like motherfucker call me jeff or 
something like that.

713
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,120
You know?
People have a hard time letting go of a 

714
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,120
hard time remembering names.
Yeah,

715
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,900
of course you do.
Well that's the thing.

716
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,590
There's a certain number that you have 
in your head and you get past that 

717
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,000
number and it's called Dunbar's number.
150 people in your head.

718
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,550
That's it.
So you got room for fuck.

719
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,040
You get more than 150 people.
You got to delete names.

720
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,160
Like you can't have like friendships 
with more than 150 people.

721
00:31:04,161 --> 00:31:07,250
You just don't have the data base.
I think I spent those numbers up in like

722
00:31:07,251 --> 00:31:07,880
third grade.

723
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,710
When I look at the yearbook and look at 
the kids older than me,

724
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:14,860
they're still people older than me in 
Berkeley prep high grade school that I 

725
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,470
remember them distinctly.
Sure.

726
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:18,470
I remember looking at those pictures and
seeing the hot girls,

727
00:31:18,471 --> 00:31:20,240
Holly Clifford,
and now I still remember her.

728
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,060
I remember was her picture.
It looked like people that had an impact

729
00:31:23,061 --> 00:31:24,710
on you.
You're going to remember them for sure.

730
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:28,760
You're always going to remember them,
but people that like if you meet a bunch

731
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,920
of people on a daily basis,
like how many people you're meeting,

732
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:35,921
you're talking about you did 60 fucking 
shows and how many people are on each 

733
00:31:35,921 --> 00:31:36,470
show?
That's like 120 people already.

734
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,690
Right?
So that's no way.

735
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:39,950
There's no way you gonna remember all 
them.

736
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,040
It's unfortunate.
Like there's people that were on fear 

737
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,040
factor and I'll meet him again and I'll 
go,

738
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:45,040
what the fuck?

739
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,640
Where do I know?
I try to remember where I know we did 

740
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:49,640
the thing with the bowl and the guy,
oh yeah,

741
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,770
oh hey man,
how are you doing?

742
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,860
And then all of a sudden,
like,

743
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,990
I have access to those files again,
like,

744
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:55,330
like my brain will go,
yeah,

745
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:56,420
yeah.
Let me pull that up here.

746
00:31:56,421 --> 00:32:00,260
It is like in my regular brain,
my regular memory,

747
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:05,470
it just wasn't available.
But your brain will give you access to 

748
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:05,930
these files if you pull them up every 
now and then.

749
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:11,110
Like if you delete certain things,
you could still find them like they're 

750
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:14,891
in your trash but you have an empty your
trash yet saying it gives you a chance 

751
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:20,231
to pull them back.
But I think it gets to a certain point 

752
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,740
and then you no more.
There's no more file does not exist.

753
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:22,550
Yeah,
I'm done.

754
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:25,190
I'm done with the files and now I'm 
dreaming so much,

755
00:32:25,191 --> 00:32:28,700
so intensely that I'm literally like 
going through every morning and I'm like

756
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:32,930
fucking 13 dreams that are remembering.
And that's kind of fucking with my day.

757
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,940
Are you having so many dreams?
I have no idea,

758
00:32:34,941 --> 00:32:37,610
man.
I think I broke my gov with that.

759
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,960
Uh,
with the lucid,

760
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:39,990
like I got really into

761
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:42,500
lucid dreaming and I was lucid dreaming 
constantly.

762
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:45,680
Still am today.
Last night had a dream about I'm getting

763
00:32:45,681 --> 00:32:50,681
arrested at the Hillsborough River Lake 
with a bunch of my friends and I was in 

764
00:32:50,681 --> 00:32:53,371
my underwear and they had the dogs 
putting us down and then I woke up and 

765
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:56,690
they'd thrown tear gas at us and the 
dogs were standing over us and we're 

766
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,891
handcuffed and that's like me and four 
friends spread out and I woke up and I 

767
00:32:59,891 --> 00:33:00,320
went,
I'm not done with that cop because I'm,

768
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,300
I'm wanting to.
I needed to do justice in that dream.

769
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:07,990
And so I went back to sleep and I just 
started dreaming immediately about that 

770
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:11,591
cop.
So this is something that we actually 

771
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:11,591
talked about this.
Did we talk about this?

772
00:33:11,591 --> 00:33:15,560
We have Alpha brain and what I've 
realized is my,

773
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,740
my,
my lucid dreaming is attached to Alpha 

774
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,991
brain in the sense that our would give 
me energy and make me think quicker and 

775
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:22,991
faster.

776
00:33:22,991 --> 00:33:23,600
I don't know if it was caffeine or what 
was in it.

777
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:23,860
Um,
but,

778
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,400
um,
but no caffeine,

779
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,580
it's probably colding.
Acetylcholine is something that people 

780
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:30,580
reported.
If you take it,

781
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,690
it gives you a really intense dreams.
Yeah.

782
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,370
That's,
uh,

783
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:38,380
one of the universal things that people 
said about Alpha brain is the dream 

784
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,130
part.
I've always said it makes,

785
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,640
it feels like I got,
I don't,

786
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:43,610
I'm not a lucid dreamer where I don't 
have any techniques and practice it,

787
00:33:43,611 --> 00:33:48,611
but occasionally I found myself in that 
state and when I find myself in that 

788
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:48,611
state where I realized that I'm 
dreaming,

789
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,810
it feels like it's more,
it's,

790
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,210
it always used to feel like a child's 
bubble.

791
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:54,320
You know,
when you blow a bubble,

792
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,640
like if you touch it,
it pops.

793
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:01,030
It became like a basketball.
Like I could bounce this motherfucker 

794
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:01,790
around like this dream.
I could bounce it around.

795
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,400
I never pursued it.
You pursued it,

796
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,640
you got into the techniques in you,
you got into like getting your mind in 

797
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,060
the right state.
No,

798
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,340
no.
Just blacking out and passing out drunk.

799
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,080
But I mean you said you got in lucid 
dream practicing it.

800
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,620
Right.
The thing is is that I,

801
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,600
I found myself waking up and being able 
to get back into dreams and then I went,

802
00:34:23,601 --> 00:34:28,601
there's something to that.
Then I found myself for a big chunk of 

803
00:34:28,601 --> 00:34:32,081
big,
big chunk being in a dream state for 

804
00:34:32,081 --> 00:34:32,081
almost the entire night without 
sleeping.

805
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,540
Like,
I mean I put this on the sensitivity of 

806
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:37,540
my fitbit watch.
I put it on the sensitivity,

807
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,180
very sensitive when I sleep I'm always 
sleeping really like sleeping like three

808
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:42,620
to four hours a night.
But I'm,

809
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,370
I'm out the whole night.
But I'm having these intense really,

810
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,910
um,
uh,

811
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:51,330
in like all encompassing dreams,
you know,

812
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:51,720
like,
and,

813
00:34:51,721 --> 00:34:56,721
and,
and I was weaving my way in and out of 

814
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:56,721
them.

815
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:56,721
I was having my way with them.
I mean,

816
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:57,950
there were like,
it was like next level.

817
00:34:57,951 --> 00:35:01,300
I talked about it on a podcast.
It was Shane Moss and I ended up.

818
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,860
But he asked me,
I told him and then I ended up crying in

819
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:05,780
the middle of,
this is about buddy who killed himself,

820
00:35:05,781 --> 00:35:08,570
but it was such a surreal fucking dream 
that I,

821
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:10,310
that even telling anyone about it,
they're like,

822
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,810
how the fuck did that?
Like,

823
00:35:11,811 --> 00:35:16,811
are you serious?
Did you ever think about like reading 

824
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:18,530
books on it and getting deep into the 
methods that people use to achieve those

825
00:35:18,531 --> 00:35:19,780
states?
I did,

826
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,910
I did online.
I've read a bunch about dreaming online.

827
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:28,090
Um,
and I even took it as far as how I 

828
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:28,090
became obsessed with it and I wanted to 
do a dream cast right.

829
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:33,000
Bring in like a Zen Buddhist monk to 
relax you and get you to sleep.

830
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,770
And then for like for like seven minutes
we get you to sleep and then give you a 

831
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,321
period of two minutes silent.
And then I am like the dream weaver and 

832
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:42,321
I'm like,
well,

833
00:35:42,321 --> 00:35:42,740
all right guys,
we're in like.

834
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:44,550
And so as you're sleeping,
because it happens to me a lot.

835
00:35:44,551 --> 00:35:47,130
I know I've told you that I'll have 
dreams of you.

836
00:35:47,131 --> 00:35:50,360
I dream of viewing fitzsimmons hanging 
out in my living room talking and I just

837
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,400
was,
you guys all my podcasts and I was 

838
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,400
sleeping and it was just immersing 
itself in my head.

839
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:55,400
Wow.
And it's like,

840
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,910
it was so funny because whatever you 
guys were talking about,

841
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:59,340
I had an opinion and I kept trying to 
interrupt you guys.

842
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:01,050
And you were like,
hold on bird bird,

843
00:36:01,051 --> 00:36:04,180
stop how bizarre.
But yeah,

844
00:36:04,181 --> 00:36:06,990
I,
I'm dreaming for me is like I,

845
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,790
it's if I feel like I need it in life in
order to stay sane because my dreams are

846
00:36:11,791 --> 00:36:16,260
like fucking literally when I say 13 
dreams tonight that I remember sometimes

847
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,070
30 dreams.

848
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,520
Like damn dude,
I remember.

849
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,170
I remember what will happen is I'll tell
you one.

850
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:24,810
And then as I tell you one,
it will untangle all the other ones.

851
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:25,530
Start.
It'll,

852
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,180
it'll start coming out like,
like,

853
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,040
like a braid.
You'd be like,

854
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:29,380
yeah,
yeah,

855
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,060
yeah.
And then.

856
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:31,550
And so,
uh,

857
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:34,530
I called Doug Benson,
remember my dreams are so intense.

858
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:39,531
At one point I was,
Doug Benson asked me to leave them to 

859
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,661
him on his answering machine.
So I leave him on his answering machine 

860
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:42,240
now.
And then he puts them on.

861
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,820
Doug loves minis.
So we put my dreams on Douglas.

862
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,310
Like I came in,
like,

863
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,370
like I had a dream one time.
This is what my funnier dreams as an 

864
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,780
answering machine.
It's his voicemail voicemail,

865
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:59,010
this car phone to call his answering 
machine.

866
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,530
Had a dream one time that,
uh,

867
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:04,100
I'm standing like this.
Okay.

868
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm onstage and I'm standing like this.

869
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,290
Okay.
Hands on the hips,

870
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:11,580
a very feminine,
more flamboyantly gay than feminine.

871
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,410
If a woman did that,
you'd be confused.

872
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,060
So I look and I'm like,
what the fuck?

873
00:37:15,061 --> 00:37:16,290
And there's a curtain right in front of 
me and I'm like,

874
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,440
what is this?
And I looked to the left and I see four 

875
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,870
dudes staggard stance to it with me,
two behind us in Klan outfits,

876
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:30,530
a Klux Klan outfits.
And I look and sometimes there'll be a 

877
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:31,470
mirror on the side of the stages.
I look and I see me,

878
00:37:31,471 --> 00:37:36,471
I'm not in a clean up it,
but I'm hauling white and I've got a 

879
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:37,050
dunce cap on and I'm like,
that's close enough.

880
00:37:37,051 --> 00:37:42,051
That's like,
even if I don't look just like them 

881
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:42,051
people I was in,
I'm in the dream.

882
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:46,041
I thought travel channel's going to be 
pissed when they see that I'm dancing 

883
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:46,041
with,
with like and all of a sudden I hear the

884
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:49,200
curtains start to pull back and I'm 
about to get off stage and I hear ladies

885
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:53,580
and gentlemen put your hands together 
for the click clack cleanse and we start

886
00:37:53,581 --> 00:37:58,581
tap dancing and I've always wanted to 
tap dance and we start tap dancing and 

887
00:37:58,581 --> 00:37:59,000
just fucking hammering it out.

888
00:37:59,020 --> 00:37:59,830
I'm like,
I can't.

889
00:37:59,831 --> 00:38:01,470
CanNot stay.
Just so much fun.

890
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,810
And then I woke up and I was like,
Benson,

891
00:38:03,811 --> 00:38:08,811
I had a dream to be a great sketch.
The click clack clans should write this 

892
00:38:08,941 --> 00:38:11,370
down.
I've lived on Doug Benson's answering,

893
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:15,540
make a sketch out about these guys that 
were in the clan,

894
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,610
but they feel bad.
They don't hate black people anymore and

895
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:20,190
they want to entertain and spread their 
new message.

896
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,740
They clicked so they start,
they start going around the country,

897
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,720
tap dancing and align the way they 
encounter so many black people.

898
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:32,721
They can become racist again.
Turned back around and people get really

899
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,100
mad.
Crowes people

900
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,350
really mad at them because they're used 
to being the clan like fucking bill,

901
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,120
but we're not in the cloud anymore.
I'm telling you we're not racist.

902
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,980
We have a total change of heart.
And we already had the costumes.

903
00:38:44,981 --> 00:38:45,700
That's why we're wearing.
No,

904
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,280
we're just,
we're just being big foods as the class.

905
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,450
By the end of it,
they were like,

906
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:52,390
fuck black people back.
I'm back.

907
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:57,190
I'm moving back to Tennessee.
I moved back to the mountains,

908
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,000
back to deep woods to click clack clams.
There was a period of my dreams,

909
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,110
like a big chunk where they were like 
cyclical and uh,

910
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,930
and had amazing endings like,
and I was just like,

911
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,940
I was blown away and I was telling 
Benson,

912
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:18,950
he was like,
leave me on my thing and I'll put them 

913
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:18,950
on my podcast.
So I started doing it.

914
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:19,450
And then what happens is I'm going 
through this right now as I go through a

915
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:19,840
big period.

916
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:22,570
I was leaving them a lot of malaria 
dreams because they're insane.

917
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:25,030
And then I get,
I'm so.

918
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm so keyed into dreaming.
I'm dreaming obsessively where I am 

919
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:30,610
right now,
where I'm having like fucking 30 to 35 a

920
00:39:30,611 --> 00:39:35,611
night and I can't stop them.
You haven't been able to remember all 35

921
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:36,970
of them?
Yeah,

922
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,450
I mean obviously even if I listen to my 
dreams now,

923
00:39:40,451 --> 00:39:42,370
if I go to doug loves movies and listen 
to my dreams,

924
00:39:42,371 --> 00:39:44,940
put all your dreams on Doug Benson's 
podcast.

925
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,340
Why don't you just because you have 
burt's dreams.

926
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,390
I didn't have a separate podcast or just
inch at a time.

927
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,400
It was just came out organically and I 
was like,

928
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:55,890
people got fucking.
Hate them all.

929
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,080
Throw my podcast.
But does he have commercials on that?

930
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:01,180
Oh yeah.
He's making money off if bird streams.

931
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,880
He's making money off your dreams.
I'm just kidding.

932
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,660
Anyway,
it's Berclov Minis.

933
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,270
It's like a five minute.
Just catch up for the week.

934
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:13,260
Anyway,
it felt pure fucking papers here,

935
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:16,720
Bert and getting fucked over here.
Business Wise,

936
00:40:16,721 --> 00:40:19,770
I feel like you're getting fucked.
Anyway.

937
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,090
Commercials on camera dreams.
Interesting.

938
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,080
Yeah,
I'm thinking,

939
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:24,970
I've been thinking of doing that.
I've been thinking about doing a big,

940
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:27,340
long one of all my dreams for him 
because they're just,

941
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,080
they're just release a podcast where you
wake up and you explain in great detail.

942
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,910
I mean,
you could do 15 minutes,

943
00:40:33,911 --> 00:40:34,720
20 minutes,
whatever,

944
00:40:34,721 --> 00:40:37,300
and just release it as a podcast,
but we would love that.

945
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,170
The,
um,

946
00:40:38,171 --> 00:40:40,330
if you really haven't that many a night 
dream catcher,

947
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,600
make it a cool journey.
Time capture streams.

948
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,640
How about podcasts?
Just real simple.

949
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:48,370
Burt's dreams are you talking about your
dreams?

950
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:50,350
Every single episode is a drain and 
that's it.

951
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:52,210
There's no sports towards your dreams.

952
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:56,170
All your dreams like you could do,
you know,

953
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,910
you could do how they tie in together.
What you did before you went to bed,

954
00:41:00,911 --> 00:41:03,460
what you drank that put you in this 
catatonic state.

955
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:08,830
We believe that you're in a bubble bath.
That's the size of the Philadelphia 

956
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,040
Eagles Stadium floating in there and 
you're naked,

957
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:13,870
but no one could see you because the 
water's so high.

958
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:14,270
I mean,
you,

959
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:19,340
you,
you could have a bunch of different 

960
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:19,340
fucking crazy dreams that you can just 
relay.

961
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:24,450
You could have your kids tell their 
dreams or you could tell their kids to 

962
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,500
have it.
I would burn the boats of dreams.

963
00:41:26,501 --> 00:41:31,501
It usually,
like lately all my dreams had been 

964
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:31,501
comics,
like all my dreams,

965
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:33,890
a bit about comics.
I had a dream about you and Debby Norton

966
00:41:33,891 --> 00:41:33,980
and

967
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,150
bill burn a bunch of guys in a radio 
show like two nights,

968
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,710
two nights ago and so.
But it's like all.

969
00:41:39,711 --> 00:41:42,650
They're all about comics right now.
I have no idea.

970
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,800
I don't know.
I honestly doing the road a lot I think 

971
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,590
because I haven't been doing stand up as
much as I'm able to stand up and so now 

972
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,101
I've started back on stand up and I 
think I'm just inspired by a bunch of 

973
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:54,950
people who I feel like are doing it a 
lot better than me.

974
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:00,610
So.
So when you said you haven't been doing 

975
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:00,610
standup as much as you've been doing 
standup,

976
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,920
I think you probably met when doing the 
show more than doing tv more than.

977
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,930
Yeah.
It's interesting.

978
00:42:05,931 --> 00:42:08,920
You put me in a weird quagmire when we 
had the conversation of Vietnam,

979
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:10,040
as I said.
All right.

980
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:15,041
So I've been very attentive to writing 
material about these things that had 

981
00:42:15,041 --> 00:42:15,560
been doing and I've been going back and 
looking at all the activities.

982
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,030
However,
a few like,

983
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:21,630
um,
I feel like it's really interesting,

984
00:42:21,631 --> 00:42:26,631
you know,
so often you hear comics come on the 

985
00:42:26,631 --> 00:42:28,061
podcast,
they'll talk about writing new material 

986
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:28,061
and Jimmy,
you're getting a beer.

987
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:28,240
Oh,
writing new material and,

988
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,880
and,
and the versus the addiction of killing,

989
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,620
you know.
And uh,

990
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:35,960
and I think I'd always thought because I
write on stage,

991
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:36,920
I'm like,
yeah,

992
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,140
I always right,
I'm not worried about that.

993
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,320
But then this weekend I was in Columbus 
and they noticed that when I would get 

994
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,470
into a spot where it was a genuine new 
bit about scuba diving,

995
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:50,710
80 feet to go see a wrecker or a,
we're riding the top fuel dragster 

996
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,270
jumping off this most of a Meta stadium 
that when it started a bomb,

997
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,730
that's the panic feeling where people 
go,

998
00:42:55,731 --> 00:43:00,731
I need to get out and do an old bit.
And to be able to own that bomb and 

999
00:43:00,731 --> 00:43:04,331
sitting there and trust it and trust it 
that these people are going to get a 

1000
00:43:04,331 --> 00:43:05,270
piece of shit joke right now that I'm 
working on,

1001
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,400
but trust me one day it'll be better.

1002
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,830
Was there for.
It's for writing.

1003
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,700
You got to,
you know,

1004
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:13,700
that's where you should really fuck 
around and try to expand bits,

1005
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,040
trying to come up with new ways to do 
them.

1006
00:43:16,041 --> 00:43:21,041
You take a lot of chances.
And like club Gaffigan and I had a 

1007
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:21,041
conversation about this who was kind of 
interesting.

1008
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,130
He's just like,
I always do new shit,

1009
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:24,140
but I always want to make sure the show 
is good.

1010
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,970
Yeah,
that's the most important thing.

1011
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:29,160
I'm not going to go up there and do a 
new,

1012
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:33,770
like completely new stuff and bomb.
It was like if it's all going bad,

1013
00:43:33,771 --> 00:43:35,840
I will go to old stuff that I know it 
really works.

1014
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,290
He's like the most important thing for 
me is that the show's good,

1015
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:42,380
which makes a lot of sense.
Especially if they're paying high ticket

1016
00:43:42,381 --> 00:43:45,470
dollar prices in theaters,
which is like a lot of stuff he's doing.

1017
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,490
He's got a kind of pretty big obligation
to have a good show.

1018
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,820
People got babysitters.
They came out there.

1019
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,610
That's where the La clubs come in.
That's where [inaudible] comes in here,

1020
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:56,750
you know,
at the store,

1021
00:43:56,751 --> 00:43:59,230
at the Improv,
which is going up and you know,

1022
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:04,290
I'm just going up with a skeleton of a 
joke and trying to figure out what it 

1023
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:04,400
isn't.
Recording it,

1024
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,650
listening to it,
going back over it or record it.

1025
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,590
You record it.
You got an iphone.

1026
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,850
Just use your phone.
I still hard to do.

1027
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,290
Well,
no.

1028
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,050
Yeah,
I don't know it.

1029
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:18,210
I feel like when I recorded,
I actually say it differently than if I 

1030
00:44:18,210 --> 00:44:18,210
feel.
If it's getting lost to the ethos,

1031
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,740
then I feel like it's a,
it's in the,

1032
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:25,770
it's in the spirit.
It's in the moment and it's in live by 

1033
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:25,770
the sword,
die by the sword type shit.

1034
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,850
You like doing that.
There's nothing wrong with that.

1035
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,930
Just takes longer to get a bit better.
Yeah.

1036
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,340
The reality of recording

1037
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:37,340
is if you do it all the time,
you're not going to say it any 

1038
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,261
different.
If you're recording every set that I 

1039
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:41,211
have a record,
so every set is is like when it's 100% 

1040
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:45,291
of your sets,
it's never different because you're 

1041
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:45,990
recording what I'm saying,
like it just becomes doing a set,

1042
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:51,230
so if I say something in the middle of I
don't have to ponder afterwards,

1043
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:52,890
what did I say?
What did I say?

1044
00:44:52,891 --> 00:44:56,340
I a recording because there's a lot of 
times where you're saying things off the

1045
00:44:56,341 --> 00:45:00,420
cuff and that's the line.
That's the line and dude,

1046
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:02,700
if you're not recording that line can 
escape you.

1047
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,940
It can leave you and never return it.
You could take yourself into some 

1048
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:12,801
strange place,
strange headspace because when you're 

1049
00:45:12,801 --> 00:45:16,521
doing a bit something might happen or 
someone might react to it in a certain 

1050
00:45:16,521 --> 00:45:17,790
way and because they react to it in a 
certain way,

1051
00:45:17,910 --> 00:45:18,450
you say,
well,

1052
00:45:18,451 --> 00:45:23,451
you're thinking the and that's the best 
line of the joke and that just came out 

1053
00:45:23,451 --> 00:45:25,200
of that particular moment.
If you don't capture that,

1054
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:28,650
you might not ever be able to recreate 
it in your memory because you're in that

1055
00:45:28,651 --> 00:45:31,740
weird zen state when you're killing too.
That's part of the problem,

1056
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:37,030
like when you're really in the groove,
you're in that zen state where you're 

1057
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:37,030
barely there,
you know,

1058
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:41,601
you like a ride on this thing and when 
you're creating all those new bits in 

1059
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:46,401
that sort of zen state,
a lot of times you can't remember what 

1060
00:45:46,401 --> 00:45:46,401
you said.

1061
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,640
Yeah.
I usually end up saying out loud,

1062
00:45:49,641 --> 00:45:51,050
if I say something new that's really 
good.

1063
00:45:51,051 --> 00:45:52,610
I'll go.
Can someone please tweet that to me?

1064
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:53,780
That works.
Yeah.

1065
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:59,180
So friend tweeted me a Sushi,
your kids sucking Dick.

1066
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,200
I was like,
what the fuck?

1067
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,710
I was like,
by the end of the night I'm hammered.

1068
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,430
It was,
it was the idea that I was,

1069
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:08,480
I don't know how the big goes because I 
said it in the moment,

1070
00:46:08,481 --> 00:46:09,500
but I'll figure it out.
But uh,

1071
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:10,520
that,
um,

1072
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:16,570
two guys,
two guys watching gay porn is like 

1073
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,310
giving your kid Sushi for the first 
time.

1074
00:46:17,311 --> 00:46:18,230
Like,
I don't think I like it.

1075
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:19,190
And you're like,
don't put in your mouth.

1076
00:46:19,191 --> 00:46:19,850
See what you think.

1077
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,640
Maybe you like getting like now and the 
texture is going to freak me out.

1078
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:23,840
I heard it's expensive.

1079
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,190
That's so funny.
Yeah,

1080
00:46:27,191 --> 00:46:27,960
hurting.
Get sick.

1081
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:28,310
Yeah.

1082
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:34,450
People if they get sick,
they always blamed Sushi.

1083
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,560
I got diarrhea.
I eat Sushi,

1084
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,270
Sushi.
Are you sure?

1085
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:44,050
Sure.
How the fuck do you know you eat things 

1086
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:44,050
all day,
Joe?

1087
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:46,931
You know that's what's funny about that 
is that it's almost impossible to get 

1088
00:46:46,931 --> 00:46:49,250
food poisoning from Sushi because in 
United States Sushi is flash frozen.

1089
00:46:49,251 --> 00:46:52,700
It has to be frozen and then I re falled
out,

1090
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:55,280
so it's like almost impossible for you 
to actually.

1091
00:46:55,310 --> 00:47:00,310
That's not totally true.
There's certainly certain ones can get 

1092
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:01,310
parasites rooms,
especially freshwater fish,

1093
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,950
but when people get sick,
it's from the rice.

1094
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:09,630
I bet some people get sick from the 
salmon to certain freshwater fishes.

1095
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:10,910
Parasites,
salt,

1096
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:11,280
water,
fish.

1097
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,740
You don't really have to worry about it 
as much,

1098
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,490
but the freshwater fish drink goat's 
blood with a chief the other day,

1099
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:22,020
like I just have.
I've given up on any of that fucking 

1100
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,160
I've been because I'm nervous eater 
about stuff like that.

1101
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,830
Gross blood cut its throat,
poured it into a horn,

1102
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,540
put some grass in there,
shook it up,

1103
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:29,760
gave it to me like why grass?
It's not disgusting by itself.

1104
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:36,460
Some grass high enough historic mix.
That shit up.

1105
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:41,240
Goldblatt,
who's your go blood Hyena Piss smoothie.

1106
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,090
Irony.
It tasted like a liver was real.

1107
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:50,490
It was real myron.
He could feel it like 10 out of your 

1108
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:50,490
mouth a little bit.
Trying to make sense,

1109
00:47:50,490 --> 00:47:52,450
man.
That's a hard scrabble life.

1110
00:47:52,451 --> 00:47:55,120
Being a goat.
Goats live in places where there's not a

1111
00:47:55,121 --> 00:48:00,121
lot of water right now.
There's no fucking water where we where 

1112
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:00,430
they can survive a long time with no 
water.

1113
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:02,800
Those mountain goats,
they must taste like shit.

1114
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,140
Tastes like it.
Tastes great.

1115
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:07,630
You eat them.
We put them on skewers,

1116
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:10,960
had a fire and then had the skewers 
angled from the fire and just cooked.

1117
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,370
It was interesting.
That's the way they cook.

1118
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,020
I learned to that.
That's where they cooked.

1119
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:19,021
Medium rare too.
Well done is they stick that stick in 

1120
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:19,220
the fire that way and it cooks or 
something.

1121
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:24,250
They'll say,
I found I was meditating with a Zen 

1122
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:26,310
Buddhist priest and in Japan they stick 
to it so that there's a fire.

1123
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:31,921
They stick the stick in this way and 
that's how this is more well done and 

1124
00:48:31,921 --> 00:48:32,530
this is less well done.
So that's how they cook it.

1125
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:35,080
You listened to people that are 
listening to this,

1126
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:37,390
so try to explain this in a way that 
makes sense.

1127
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,600
So if you're confused and I'm right in 
front of you,

1128
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:42,960
you build a fire.
I said,

1129
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,890
look at that on paper.
People are like,

1130
00:48:44,891 --> 00:48:47,250
what the fuck is he saying?
Let's just mark it off to.

1131
00:48:47,251 --> 00:48:51,010
I wasn't listening and I don't know what
the fuck I'm talking about is a stick.

1132
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,890
They stick it in the fire and then put 
the meat on the stick.

1133
00:48:53,891 --> 00:48:55,040
The skewer,
the stick,

1134
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,010
the meat on a small size have this big 
sport that's like fucking this long.

1135
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:02,230
It's fucking sharp shit.
They stay.

1136
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,780
Make it sharpest shit and thin.
So they make a stick.

1137
00:49:04,781 --> 00:49:09,781
They turn into a bar and then they 
basically skewer all the goat's meat on 

1138
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:09,781
a stick,
like,

1139
00:49:09,781 --> 00:49:12,130
like a Kabob and then they shove it 
right next to the fire,

1140
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:14,310
like two o'clock on a,
on a clock.

1141
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,920
They,
we put them all around the.

1142
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:17,590
They put it all around the fire,
really,

1143
00:49:17,591 --> 00:49:19,900
like just like hands one o'clock and 
then,

1144
00:49:19,901 --> 00:49:24,160
but they're angled out.
I still angled pointing away and I said,

1145
00:49:24,161 --> 00:49:25,420
that's interesting.
And he said,

1146
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:30,421
well no,
the top ones aren't as well done in the 

1147
00:49:30,421 --> 00:49:32,611
bottoms that are more well done.
I thought that was really fucking 

1148
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:32,611
fascinating.
I was like,

1149
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:32,611
Holy Shit.
My head,

1150
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:37,531
I'm like,
I can just grill my shit like I could 

1151
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:40,801
actually be.
But then I talked to him about wood and 

1152
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:40,801
it's really specific about what kind of 
wood you use.

1153
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:40,801
Cancers,
use any wood,

1154
00:49:40,801 --> 00:49:42,910
so there's certain different types of 
wood that people will cook with.

1155
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,070
Especially in Africa.
That's in America too.

1156
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:47,950
Like there's like if you watch those 
barbecue contests,

1157
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,100
you ever see those barbecue?
Compress those gates.

1158
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,640
Fascinated those.
Get you wanting to smoke a meet dudes.

1159
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:55,040
Smoke a brisket.
Like a cherry tree.

1160
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,210
Cherry tree do.
We had fucking beal,

1161
00:49:58,510 --> 00:50:03,510
a venison sausage.
I eat venison sausage some.

1162
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,300
I got some in my house is one of my 
favorites.

1163
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:10,660
Delicious.
To mix pork fat into it though.

1164
00:50:10,661 --> 00:50:11,630
It's kind of interesting.
Yeah.

1165
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,510
Yeah.
Most venison sausages.

1166
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:15,160
Not really.
Venison sausage,

1167
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:18,010
it's venison sausage with pork fat,
like,

1168
00:50:18,011 --> 00:50:19,930
um,
I Cook Ground Venison,

1169
00:50:19,931 --> 00:50:24,931
I take ground venison and I cook it and 
I'll use like gluten free pasta or like 

1170
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,070
sprouted grain pasta and I'll mix it all
together

1171
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,890
with like some tomato sauce.
It's fucking fantastic.

1172
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:34,820
But it's one of the rare times where 
people use ground venison by itself.

1173
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:39,850
Most ground venison,
they mix up with pork fat because it's 

1174
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,911
so lean because it's a healthy animal.
I mean it's an animal that's running 

1175
00:50:42,911 --> 00:50:46,331
around eating crops and grass and 
Alfalfa and shit and running all over 

1176
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:48,140
the place.
They don't have much body fat on them.

1177
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,610
So when you,
if you had just,

1178
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,910
just the meat of the deer in the 
sausage,

1179
00:50:52,911 --> 00:50:55,820
it would probably be really dry.
He wouldn't like it.

1180
00:50:57,360 --> 00:50:59,450
Listen,
I've had a bunch of medicine as of late.

1181
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,460
I just fucking love it.
It's really good for you,

1182
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:04,130
dude.
You know what's the best though?

1183
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,890
Elk elks.
Insane.

1184
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,260
I need to get one of those.
I need.

1185
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:11,180
I'm,
I'm going on to Elkanns this fall.

1186
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:12,440
Really?
Fuck.

1187
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:13,820
Yeah.
Yeah.

1188
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:15,290
They have a problem with wolves.

1189
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:18,260
They've killed so many elk that there's 
certain populations,

1190
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:23,440
certain parts of a America where the elk
population has dropped down to 20% of 

1191
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,420
its original size.
What's his name?

1192
00:51:26,421 --> 00:51:27,880
Rinella.
Talking about that on your podcast.

1193
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:30,410
There's places where like,
you know,

1194
00:51:30,411 --> 00:51:32,270
there's,
it's dropped 50%,

1195
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:37,450
but you know,
there's still a lot of elk is a lot of 

1196
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:37,450
elk.
It's just about getting near them.

1197
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,830
There's so many of them.
Like my friend Helen,

1198
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:41,210
Helen Cho,
she's the.

1199
00:51:41,211 --> 00:51:45,920
I'm a woman who works for a 0.0.
She works with Anthony Bordain.

1200
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:49,040
She works with Steve or Noah and his 
show and they,

1201
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:51,560
uh,
they took her hunting for the first time

1202
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:54,470
and she's a,
she's been here a bunch of times hanging

1203
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:58,280
out with us when Ronelle has come on.
And she's like super sweet,

1204
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,000
like,
you know,

1205
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:01,880
grew up in Brooklyn and unreal Nela 
show.

1206
00:52:01,881 --> 00:52:06,881
He took her hunting,
her and another woman who works in the 

1207
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:06,881
office,
they took the,

1208
00:52:06,881 --> 00:52:08,390
both of them with my friend Ryan 
Callahan and Rinella,

1209
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,600
and they took them into Montana.

1210
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,600
That shooting elk.
But you see like these herds developed 

1211
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:14,600
with.
He was like 50,

1212
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:14,600
60,
70,

1213
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,170
80,
or a hundred elk,

1214
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,440
like giant herds of these cow elks,
and so she picks one out and she drops 

1215
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:20,510
it and she,
you know,

1216
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:22,070
they cooked it that night.
It was crazy.

1217
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:24,440
It's crazy watching,
knowing her,

1218
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,660
knowing her as a person that's like,
you know,

1219
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,240
didn't really have a lot of experience 
outdoors at all.

1220
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:34,270
It wasn't like a crazy fitness person or
an extreme athlete is doing naughty 

1221
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:34,810
things all the time.
Like she,

1222
00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:36,650
you know,
as a regular person,

1223
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,720
very nice person,
works in an office,

1224
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,990
you know,
works for Anthony Bourdain and 0.0

1225
00:52:41,991 --> 00:52:46,991
and all of a sudden she's shooting a 
fucking elk in the mountains of Montana 

1226
00:52:46,991 --> 00:52:49,790
and the snow and the woods and it's like
wild shit dude.

1227
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,830
Did you,
did you like cry or anything?

1228
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,670
She was pretty.

1229
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:55,660
Not Cry,
but you could tell she was like real.

1230
00:52:55,661 --> 00:52:57,620
It was like an overwhelming experience.
She was like,

1231
00:52:57,621 --> 00:52:59,660
there's no words for this.
Which is how I felt too.

1232
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,490
The first time I shot a deer.
It's like,

1233
00:53:01,491 --> 00:53:03,290
there's no words for this.
This is wild.

1234
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,450
So it's not like hitting a home run.
Nah,

1235
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,340
Nah.
Hitting a home run.

1236
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:11,330
There's no sense of loss.
There's a weird sense of loss when you,

1237
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:13,820
uh,
when you shoot an animal like a,

1238
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:16,550
you're going to eat that animal so you 
don't feel bad about it.

1239
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,700
Um,
at least I didn't feel bad about it.

1240
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:20,840
I thought about it for so long before I 
actually did it.

1241
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,050
But there's a sense of loss.
When can we hit a home run?

1242
00:53:24,051 --> 00:53:25,080
It's all like,
Yay.

1243
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:25,690
Be

1244
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,920
nothing else to die.
When you're getting an animal and you've

1245
00:53:28,921 --> 00:53:32,280
got your hands inside its body and you 
feel the hot body cavity.

1246
00:53:32,281 --> 00:53:33,970
It's really weird.
Buffalo,

1247
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:38,330
one time we shot it up on crow nation.
It was hard.

1248
00:53:38,331 --> 00:53:39,210
It was,
it was tough.

1249
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:41,940
What show was this trip?
We went hunting with the crow,

1250
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,540
really shut a buffalo buffalo up on the,
up on a perch,

1251
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:50,541
like a sniper was with the whole pack 
and they have to keep the male 

1252
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:54,201
population down because it fucks with it
so they know which one they're shooting 

1253
00:53:54,201 --> 00:53:57,780
and they go out and they pop it back in.
What was really fascinating to me,

1254
00:53:57,781 --> 00:54:00,920
and I was either the small details of a 
story of overwhelming,

1255
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,790
like when like the little thing that you
won't will,

1256
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:04,230
you wouldn't normally talk about the 
story,

1257
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:10,040
but what was funny to me was the kind of
the gallows humor that Crow Indians had 

1258
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,450
as they were gutting the l gutting the 
buffalo.

1259
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:15,960
Like did,
they weren't disrupting disrespectful of

1260
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:20,961
the animal,
but like I guess they cut you cut out 

1261
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:20,961
it's asshole.
Yeah.

1262
00:54:20,961 --> 00:54:24,570
And then they like that.
But they were laughing as they cut up 

1263
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:24,570
the asphalt.
It's kids first time cutting the asshole

1264
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:26,370
out and it was like kind of an 
interesting,

1265
00:54:26,371 --> 00:54:29,370
like almost like morbid humor,
like comics kind of humor.

1266
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,290
Like you couldn't offend anyone in that 
circle.

1267
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,390
And then when they were like,
put your hand in Buffalo.

1268
00:54:33,391 --> 00:54:34,220
And I was like,
oh no,

1269
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,090
and then I can't do it.
Be a man.

1270
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,220
And they had a little kid put his hand 
in there.

1271
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:39,260
You've got to feel it.
It's an animal.

1272
00:54:39,261 --> 00:54:40,440
It was a,
it was just alive.

1273
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,400
So I was like,
fuck it.

1274
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:46,401
So I got to do it.
Put my hand in there and it just Kinda 

1275
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:46,401
took me over.
I was like,

1276
00:54:46,401 --> 00:54:46,800
Oh fuck,
this is,

1277
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:50,640
this is human warm like this is way 
warmer.

1278
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:51,870
But it's like,
yeah,

1279
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:56,490
it was hot and it was really kind of.
I Dunno if blew me away,

1280
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,590
but I always,
when I kept saying in my head I was,

1281
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,640
it was similar to being a comic because 
comics can't get offended.

1282
00:55:02,641 --> 00:55:03,660
So there was no,
like,

1283
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,720
there was no pc police,
they're just killed an animal.

1284
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:09,000
You're all in this together.
So,

1285
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:11,820
uh,
it's like I was overwhelmed.

1286
00:55:11,821 --> 00:55:14,700
And then we ate the buffalo that night.
It was fucking fantastic.

1287
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:19,470
I buffaloes to loose dude the best meat 
for you to leaner than chicken.

1288
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:22,620
And then chicken super high in protein.
It's,

1289
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:25,560
it tastes better than the beef.
It's really good man.

1290
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:29,100
Fuck gses.
But especially if they have a good diet.

1291
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:31,390
Chia seeds,
Chia seeds right now.

1292
00:55:31,391 --> 00:55:34,260
It's the biggest mistake I ever fucking 
made her drink those chia drinks.

1293
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,570
Nobody.
I'm just swallowing the seeds whole like

1294
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:37,770
Taylor swift to that man.

1295
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:41,520
Get to get these cheer drinks.
I forget what it's named,

1296
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:46,850
but it's like Chia and the in between 
there's some juice or something like 

1297
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:46,850
that.
Slips down,

1298
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:51,741
right?
Real easy and it's actually tastes good 

1299
00:55:51,741 --> 00:55:53,500
and it's super healthy for you.
Apparently the reason I was eating and 

1300
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,360
expand in your stomach and so they make 
you feel full faster.

1301
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,330
But uh,
and,

1302
00:55:56,390 --> 00:56:00,270
but then you just shit Bibi's.
I mean you're saying a thousand ants.

1303
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:02,880
You want to lose weight?
Dude,

1304
00:56:02,881 --> 00:56:06,050
this is the only way buddy.
Don't take fucking emailed me this here.

1305
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,220
You got to let this go.
No,

1306
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:10,330
don't say texted me the other night.
I'm like,

1307
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,430
was like,
hey bro,

1308
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:12,720
what's up?
Or on twitter.

1309
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:13,920
I was like,
I'm fat as fuck.

1310
00:56:13,921 --> 00:56:15,810
Can you fix this?
I sent a picture of you fix this,

1311
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,770
fix it.
Let everybody knows how to fix it.

1312
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:21,090
Nobody wants to fix it,
man.

1313
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,090
They all want to talk about fixing it.
Yeah.

1314
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,220
Wants to talk about fixing

1315
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:27,280
it and stay almost exactly the same 
weight pretty much forever.

1316
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:31,390
A few people break loose from the herd 
and become thin and they're like,

1317
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,610
how the fuck did you do it man?
And they're like,

1318
00:56:33,611 --> 00:56:35,050
man,
I just didn't eat bullshit.

1319
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:39,520
That's crazy that you did that.
I just cut back on the Cheetos ice cream

1320
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,680
and soda and fucking melted off me.
Come on.

1321
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:47,190
I want to maintain my lifestyle and 
simply add in more activity and hope 

1322
00:56:47,190 --> 00:56:51,871
that it disappears that way.
You need to burn off insane amounts of 

1323
00:56:51,871 --> 00:56:51,970
calories.
That's what people don't understand.

1324
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,580
If you want to get your body to a point 
where it's burn off fat,

1325
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,540
you got burn off more calories than 
you're taking in.

1326
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:03,680
It's like super simple.
But most people aren't willing to do 

1327
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,601
that.
Is not willing to eat less than your 

1328
00:57:06,601 --> 00:57:06,601
body needs.
What?

1329
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:07,870
No,
I'm still hungry.

1330
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:11,830
What kind of bullshit is this?
Could suck my dick and get crazy.

1331
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:13,780
And he started eating cookies and next 
thing you know,

1332
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,010
die has gone.
Just no know.

1333
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:22,580
Like I get those moments where I see 
like Oreos and I just go to fucking milk

1334
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,490
right next to him is still like someone 
pours a glass of milk and Oreos.

1335
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,400
Like if they're fucking with you have 
the trying to get you to do they do that

1336
00:57:30,401 --> 00:57:30,790
shit.
I'm like,

1337
00:57:30,791 --> 00:57:35,791
the biggest loser they put like kick in 
isn't the biggest loser was the one 

1338
00:57:37,001 --> 00:57:38,530
where they had the big table,
but Faye,

1339
00:57:38,531 --> 00:57:40,270
where they have to go around and they'd 
go,

1340
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:41,100
no,
no,

1341
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:41,830
no,
no.

1342
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,740
Shows positive.
I've been watching the biggest loser all

1343
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:49,741
the time.
They never incorporate unhealthy 

1344
00:57:49,741 --> 00:57:51,040
lifestyle and whatsoever they would ever
tempt them.

1345
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:55,990
With that.
The show was a celebrity,

1346
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:57,550
celebrity,
fat person,

1347
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:58,870
a celebrity,
fat fuck.

1348
00:57:58,871 --> 00:58:01,080
That would be great.
Recession.

1349
00:58:01,570 --> 00:58:02,830
Every fat fuck.

1350
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:11,740
They didn't find out the name of the 
show until the first day when they line 

1351
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:11,740
them all up,
they're like,

1352
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,970
gentlemen are people.
I'd like to welcome you to the celebrity

1353
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:14,630
fat fucking just watch small.
Go,

1354
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:18,600
oh man.
Fuck my agents at as whole.

1355
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:23,930
You know what's interesting about a fat,
this is the reality about diets is that 

1356
00:58:25,751 --> 00:58:29,620
everybody doesn't get an even starting 
point and that's what's not fair.

1357
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,930
Some people just get weird bodies that 
just like,

1358
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:35,080
are you looking at me?
She like little babies,

1359
00:58:35,081 --> 00:58:40,081
like little chubby babies.
Like my daughter was in this dance 

1360
00:58:40,081 --> 00:58:43,711
class.
It's a little girls with her when she's 

1361
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:43,711
little.
She was like,

1362
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:43,711
you know,
two,

1363
00:58:43,711 --> 00:58:44,410
three years old.
There's other little two,

1364
00:58:44,411 --> 00:58:47,330
three year olds with.
Some of them are just fat as fuck.

1365
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:49,220
Some of them,
their parents are fat.

1366
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:52,050
The parents sit down there and they 
struggle to sit.

1367
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,960
They sit down and this kid wattles out 
there and dances.

1368
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,020
You're like,
whoa.

1369
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:02,290
Like this kid doesn't even get a chance.
Like from jump,

1370
00:59:02,291 --> 00:59:07,291
she's overweight,
she's carrying all this body fat food 

1371
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:08,680
that,
that fit kids getting fed.

1372
00:59:08,681 --> 00:59:11,830
I'm sure it also could be whatever the 
parents heating certainly could be,

1373
00:59:11,831 --> 00:59:14,560
but you could feed that to my kid and 
they would burn it right off.

1374
00:59:14,561 --> 00:59:16,330
It's weird.
It's not even,

1375
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:18,960
it's not even my uh,
oldest daughter.

1376
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:22,020
So like super skinny man.
I'm in

1377
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,170
the middle one actually.
She's super skinny.

1378
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:26,870
Like she,
she like is always thin,

1379
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,150
really thin and she eats whatever she 
wants.

1380
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:34,151
She never has to worry about it.
She's always wants another scoop of ice 

1381
00:59:34,151 --> 00:59:34,151
cream and you know,
we don't restrict.

1382
00:59:34,490 --> 00:59:37,970
We give them like mostly healthy food,
but we don't restrict the shit.

1383
00:59:37,971 --> 00:59:42,971
I don't believe in restricting things,
I believe like and also reminding them 

1384
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:44,180
after the ice cream how they feel like 
shit,

1385
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:46,070
you know,
like after the United States.

1386
00:59:46,071 --> 00:59:46,910
I'm like,
that was good.

1387
00:59:46,911 --> 00:59:47,840
Right?
It tasted good,

1388
00:59:47,841 --> 00:59:49,610
but damn,
I feel tired now.

1389
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:50,450
Do you feel tired?

1390
00:59:52,610 --> 00:59:57,610
I don't feel tired when ice cream.
While your body's not supposed to have 

1391
00:59:57,610 --> 01:00:01,481
that much sugar.
Like it sucks because it tastes really 

1392
01:00:01,481 --> 01:00:01,481
good.
It does suck.

1393
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:02,630
I'm like,
yeah,

1394
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:03,980
I know.
It's weird.

1395
01:00:03,981 --> 01:00:05,450
It's a weird trick.
We plan ourselves.

1396
01:00:05,690 --> 01:00:08,390
I want her to know about that trick when
she's six,

1397
01:00:08,391 --> 01:00:13,391
not when she's 26 and she's throwing up 
in the toilet to try to stay thin.

1398
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:18,820
You know?
I want them just like it's good to have 

1399
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:19,340
fatty foods is fun.
Sometimes it's not.

1400
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,250
It's not.
I don't believe it's good to miss out on

1401
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:25,910
all the pleasures in life because some 
people get hooked on them.

1402
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:27,410
I say,
I think that's horseshit.

1403
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:33,100
Like Bacon is fucking delicious.
Now I will never stop eating bacon.

1404
01:00:33,711 --> 01:00:36,350
It's not going to fucking happen.
It's too good.

1405
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:40,370
When I sit there and I'm chewing on a 
crispy piece of Bacon,

1406
01:00:40,490 --> 01:00:42,380
this cooked maybe just a little too 
long,

1407
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:47,620
but it's just crunching on my mouth and 
the saltiness and the sweetness of the 

1408
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:52,310
pig fat that's just warm and melting in 
my mouth as I chew it down,

1409
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:54,070
breaking down the,
the,

1410
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:54,540
the,
the,

1411
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:59,630
the crispy fat.
I'm not stopping now that

1412
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:03,050
tube,
if you bake bacon,

1413
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,530
had like four,
25,

1414
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,990
20,
whatever it is.

1415
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,140
The perfect.
I mean it's translucent and it melts in 

1416
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,901
your mouth and I swear to God of 
dictates like that might not have 

1417
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:13,901
bruised knees.
Like,

1418
01:01:13,901 --> 01:01:16,940
I fucking love Bacon.
I was I telling you today,

1419
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:21,180
I haven't had a bruised knees.
I fucking love that.

1420
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:24,770
Robb Wolf is one of the Paleo Diet 
pioneer guys.

1421
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:29,950
Just sorta genius fitness health guy.
He slow cooks bacon every morning.

1422
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:35,560
He's like ritual.
He gets that fat bacon from whole foods 

1423
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:39,810
and you know those big ass dude and he 
puts on this like fucking slow baking 

1424
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:43,070
cooker and he's like,
as I'm getting ready for my day,

1425
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:45,710
I'm going through my day.
It's smelling the Aromas,

1426
01:01:45,711 --> 01:01:47,340
filling the house.
It's like a,

1427
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:50,060
there's a bunch of experiences going on 
and I'm like,

1428
01:01:50,061 --> 01:01:51,400
God damn,
these poor vegans,

1429
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,230
poor bastard,
my wife,

1430
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:58,231
my wife.
You know how like women have since like 

1431
01:01:58,231 --> 01:02:00,691
a women who have a sense when you start 
dating and relating and showing to 

1432
01:02:00,691 --> 01:02:00,691
smells like strawberry smells like bacon
chick.

1433
01:02:00,691 --> 01:02:02,080
One time that smell like fucking 
Bologna.

1434
01:02:02,081 --> 01:02:07,081
I was like Dana for two years process,
but my wife smells like bacon every 

1435
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:08,710
morning.
She makes the same thing.

1436
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,990
She's southern bacon,
eggs,

1437
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:14,670
biscuits and fruit for the kids.
Every fucking morning could call.

1438
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:16,140
Good call.
That's a good baptist.

1439
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:21,210
My House reeks.
I've even taken my bacon game to the 

1440
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:21,210
next level.
When you

1441
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,560
go to buy your Bacon,
if you buy it like just a regular story,

1442
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:27,561
they have the cut you get.
Don't get the thick cut that spread out 

1443
01:02:27,561 --> 01:02:27,561
like playing cards,
like,

1444
01:02:27,561 --> 01:02:32,000
like fanned out,
get the thick cut that's packed in like 

1445
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,671
dollar bills and then look at this.
You've got to make sure that the 

1446
01:02:34,671 --> 01:02:36,510
beginning to the end of that fit cut is 
even.

1447
01:02:36,511 --> 01:02:39,120
You don't want any dips in it.
Go for fucking straight.

1448
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:41,370
Even that's the most amount of bacon you
can get for your money.

1449
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:47,090
I'm taking my baby.
I'm taking my pink and pretty seriously 

1450
01:02:47,090 --> 01:02:49,370
needs to go to a butcher.
That's when you take him to the next 

1451
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:49,370
level,
right?

1452
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:49,370
When you're really taking the next 
level.

1453
01:02:49,370 --> 01:02:52,110
When you raise your own fucking pigs 
walk,

1454
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:57,170
raise your own pigs,
get friendly with him and shoot him 

1455
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:57,240
right in the head because that's what 
you gotta do.

1456
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:02,980
We had this guy on the podcast name is 
Joel Salitan and he's like a pretty 

1457
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,771
famous farmer for writing books about 
farming and he tries to recreate natural

1458
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:12,171
environments as much as possible and one
of the things he does with his pigs as 

1459
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:14,460
he puts them all inside a movable fence,
so the fence is enormous.

1460
01:03:14,461 --> 01:03:19,461
All the pigs are inside of this and then
he moves the fence and so the fence 

1461
01:03:19,461 --> 01:03:22,710
moves to a new area and the pigs route 
around eat acorns and nuts and all kinds

1462
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:24,900
of shit.
And then after,

1463
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:26,340
you know,
x amount of days,

1464
01:03:26,341 --> 01:03:31,341
they moved the fence to a new area.
So the pigs have a totally new area to 

1465
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:34,581
grace.
He has this enormous plot of land that 

1466
01:03:34,581 --> 01:03:37,161
he does all this on and it's all like a 
little electric fences to keep the pigs 

1467
01:03:37,161 --> 01:03:38,190
in,
but the pigs are more like a wild pig.

1468
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:41,580
They have like a dark texture to me,
but they're super healthy,

1469
01:03:41,581 --> 01:03:46,581
but they maintain the same sort of 
characteristics of domesticated pigs 

1470
01:03:46,581 --> 01:03:50,691
where they're not freaked out by people.
Not like fucking trying to run from me 

1471
01:03:50,691 --> 01:03:54,111
all the time.
I thought I thought what you described 

1472
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,571
as like to remember Daniel Russo's a 
halloween costume and the karate kid 

1473
01:03:56,571 --> 01:04:01,460
shower,
that he could walk around and don't see 

1474
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:01,460
them.
I thought it would.

1475
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:01,460
That was the fence.
Like the pink pigs could move them.

1476
01:04:02,350 --> 01:04:05,490
That's funny.
Look like a three d term tabling.

1477
01:04:05,491 --> 01:04:08,570
The pigs could just keep walking their 
fence around like a walker or.

1478
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:13,580
That's funny and I was like a fucking 
genius and then all of a sudden they 

1479
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:13,620
pigs are in town and they're all on that
fence.

1480
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,860
The guys got to come put a fucking tow 
hitch on the fence.

1481
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:19,970
Do one day they'll the oculus rift for 
pigs.

1482
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,230
They put it on them in the fucking.
What are you doing,

1483
01:04:22,231 --> 01:04:27,231
Jamie?
Danny Lussos costume for the chronic 

1484
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:27,231
kids.
Oh,

1485
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:27,231
Daniel Russo.
Yeah,

1486
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,900
I remember it.
I used to have a joke.

1487
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:31,390
Don't you think at one point,
uh,

1488
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:33,320
at some point Danny Lewis was.
Mom would've been like,

1489
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,970
I think this maintenance man.
I mean this man is trying to fuck my son

1490
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:40,600
spend a lot of times Japanese guys 
making paint his house.

1491
01:04:40,601 --> 01:04:41,880
It comes.
His knees are bruised.

1492
01:04:41,881 --> 01:04:46,881
His hands when he's painting for them.
This is some weird fetish thing.

1493
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,650
Slave wax on,
wax off.

1494
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:54,651
Wait a minute.
You're waxing his car or he's teaching 

1495
01:04:54,651 --> 01:04:57,061
you karate.
It's one of the other people who had 

1496
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,430
this idea that somehow or another like 
painting a fence is going to help you 

1497
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:00,450
fight.
That was the dumbest fucking movie.

1498
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:03,360
His catch fucking flies with chopsticks.
Shit.

1499
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:06,360
That ruined a lot of people with karate 
before it started us.

1500
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:09,760
That's the first movie I ever cried at 
fucking sob.

1501
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:12,930
We were in Taiwan,
chancy old yeller.

1502
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,870
I credit that to.
But that was before that.

1503
01:05:16,290 --> 01:05:21,290
I've a lot of movies cried.
I cried onstage at the Columbus funny 

1504
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,530
bone telling people about my time.
Traveler's wife,

1505
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:25,120
just telling,
I said,

1506
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,380
I said,
I came and talked about it.

1507
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,280
Someone was a fan of the podcast.
I was like,

1508
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:33,830
right if I came and talking about I'll 
start crying if I start telling you 

1509
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:36,820
about the movie or the movie miracle 
about the US hockey team.

1510
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:40,330
I started sobbing uncontrollably.
Which one is more emotional?

1511
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:45,390
One about the guys getting this,
that or the guy goes back in time and 

1512
01:05:45,390 --> 01:05:48,310
they're equal.
What is the premise of time travel?

1513
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,970
I'm not doing this.
Just tell me what it is.

1514
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:53,950
I'm going to google it.
I'll tell you,

1515
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:55,540
don't google it because it's going to 
take forever.

1516
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:59,340
Tell me what it is.
It's a guy who learns how to talk.

1517
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:01,990
He time traveled.
He's totally hit a certain time,

1518
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:06,991
right?
But the day his mom dies who time 

1519
01:06:06,991 --> 01:06:08,221
travels,
and it turns out that in times of 

1520
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:08,221
stress,
he time to travel,

1521
01:06:08,221 --> 01:06:08,800
so he also has a drinking problem 
because when he drinks,

1522
01:06:08,801 --> 01:06:12,490
he doesn't time travel.
So births in relating to this guy.

1523
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,370
Thank you joe.
I'm so glad you see it this way.

1524
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:20,640
And so Eric Bana.
Oh dude loves him and everything else 

1525
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,940
got too high.
Song as the hulk,

1526
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:28,270
like homeboys phone in and not liking 
it.

1527
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,090
I maintained that hamstring does career,
no pun intended.

1528
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:39,510
That hamstring performance for that.
He did that fucking movie where he 

1529
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,970
played that con man or the uh,
the,

1530
01:06:40,971 --> 01:06:45,971
a convict in Australia.
The guy with the tattoos all over his 

1531
01:06:46,941 --> 01:06:49,520
name or the cat tattoos all over his 
body.

1532
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:55,680
Damn it.
I've seen them in some really good 

1533
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:55,680
performances.
Hadn't the fuck up.

1534
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:56,990
Remember that guy?
What's that guy's name?

1535
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,790
Eric Bana.
What was the movie played?

1536
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:02,210
It was like the movie that let everybody
know who the fuck he is.

1537
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,440
Chopper.
That's a Chapa.

1538
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,290
Russell Crowe had romper stomper use 
that one.

1539
01:07:10,020 --> 01:07:15,020
He plays a skinhead watches for.
I was his first movie that kind of send 

1540
01:07:15,081 --> 01:07:16,410
them off.
Um.

1541
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:17,320
Anyway.
Yeah,

1542
01:07:17,390 --> 01:07:19,970
maintain his performance as Bruce 
Banner.

1543
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:25,840
Just fucking hamstringing them.
I watched it on pot brownies or cookies 

1544
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:26,500
or some form of edible and I'm just 
like,

1545
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:29,900
bullshit bullshit.
He was like,

1546
01:07:29,901 --> 01:07:33,380
so like phoning it in.
It's so fake.

1547
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:37,070
There was some scene where the guy and 
the girl are talking and it was so fake.

1548
01:07:37,071 --> 01:07:38,240
I was like,
ah,

1549
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:43,260
I lost it.
I lost the trance of the movie because 

1550
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:43,260
we're not.
We can do that.

1551
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:43,760
Like I think tons of what you can do 
that too.

1552
01:07:43,761 --> 01:07:48,761
You can either dial you in so you get 
things that no one would get or you can 

1553
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:49,900
all of a sudden see the costumes on the 
actors.

1554
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:55,280
That's nice.
Especially animals,

1555
01:07:55,281 --> 01:08:00,281
man.
They make you super sensitive to bad 

1556
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:00,281
acting,
but

1557
01:08:00,281 --> 01:08:01,090
if you go see like that fucking Daniel 
Day Lewis movie,

1558
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:05,080
what was the one where a drink?
My milkshake with the fuck was that.

1559
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:07,060
There will be blood,
there will be blood.

1560
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:10,450
Go see that one when your highest fuck,
it'll lock you in and you'd be like,

1561
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:14,010
Jesus.
Imagine if you knew this fucking guy and

1562
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,740
you actually had a deal with this guy.
We're gonna.

1563
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:22,020
Have to kill this guy.
I drank a milkshake like,

1564
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:24,440
fuck.

1565
01:08:24,540 --> 01:08:29,250
I don't remember any of that movie.
Remember as I'm swimming in like 40 feet

1566
01:08:29,251 --> 01:08:31,900
out in the Pacific,
there was a good fucking movie.

1567
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:34,110
He finds out that his brother,
not his brother,

1568
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:36,400
and he fucking take them back to the 
beach and skill.

1569
01:08:36,490 --> 01:08:37,500
How about,
spoiler alert,

1570
01:08:37,590 --> 01:08:42,590
sorry guys.
Who Listen Christ you haven't fucking 

1571
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:45,171
watched.
If I know a lot of people that haven't 

1572
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:45,171
seen yet,
erase,

1573
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:46,210
erase bad memories.
Race.

1574
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:47,760
Race.
Yeah.

1575
01:08:47,761 --> 01:08:49,380
That guy is just.
He knows how to do it.

1576
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,200
Like whatever it is that acting is.
That guy knows how to do it.

1577
01:08:52,201 --> 01:08:54,420
He's that guy.
Yeah.

1578
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:59,550
Towns with New York's gangs in New York.
That was the first time I realized I was

1579
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:04,551
like,
because I remember seeing the last of 

1580
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:04,551
the Mohicans when I was a kid and I was 
like,

1581
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:04,551
ah,
it's a good movie.

1582
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:04,920
But I thought there'd be more action.
I didn't.

1583
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,660
I couldn't appreciate acting or 
whatever.

1584
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:08,610
And then.
But when I saw games in New York,

1585
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:09,930
I was like,
mother Fucker,

1586
01:09:09,960 --> 01:09:12,660
this guy is that guy.
Like he's.

1587
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,380
He committed.

1588
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:14,050
Yeah.
He's,

1589
01:09:14,051 --> 01:09:19,051
he's in the groove man.
And he does that with a bunch of 

1590
01:09:19,051 --> 01:09:21,631
different characters too,
that I played that Ira guy who was a 

1591
01:09:21,631 --> 01:09:22,240
boxer.
He was called the boxer,

1592
01:09:22,241 --> 01:09:22,560
right?
Yeah.

1593
01:09:22,570 --> 01:09:27,570
I think that was like the best 
performance of an actor pretend to be a 

1594
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:30,961
boxer,
the most realistic because it looked 

1595
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:33,361
like real boxing,
whereas opposed to like a lot of these 

1596
01:09:33,361 --> 01:09:34,300
movies,
like what a lot of people are missing is

1597
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:38,560
the choreography.
It shows one guy teeing off on the other

1598
01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:42,490
guy and that's very rare.
In reality.

1599
01:09:42,491 --> 01:09:44,950
It's usually exchanges like you're 
hitting each other,

1600
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:48,450
like the good guy gets hit to you know,
but if you look at like,

1601
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:50,800
like Marky mark's movie,
was that the,

1602
01:09:50,810 --> 01:09:51,800
the,
the boxer,

1603
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,710
whatever the fuck it was.
What was his movie?

1604
01:09:53,711 --> 01:09:54,850
The fighter.
The fighter.

1605
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,940
Yeah.
Apparently he's boxed before,

1606
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,870
but those,
the choreography of the boxing scenes,

1607
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:02,170
this is very unrealistic.

1608
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:05,020
It didn't look anything like watching 
Mickey Ward fight.

1609
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,870
If you watch mickey ward fight mean he's
taking shots.

1610
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,370
He had this like,
uh,

1611
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:12,610
this ear muff style defense.
He kept his hands up high.

1612
01:10:12,770 --> 01:10:16,030
He would come in and he takes shots and 
throw vicious body punches.

1613
01:10:16,300 --> 01:10:18,690
But you're marky mark.
His hands are down.

1614
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:21,010
It's faces out there.
It's not like a real boxer.

1615
01:10:21,340 --> 01:10:22,810
Daniel Day Lewis,
look,

1616
01:10:22,811 --> 01:10:27,811
the guy had been punched in the face 
like there's a difference between the 

1617
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:27,811
guy who gets punched in the face all the
time,

1618
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:32,340
the way they hold their hands,
the way they're actually aware that 

1619
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,701
that's a possibility,
and then guys who just not thinking it 

1620
01:10:35,701 --> 01:10:35,701
can get.
They can get hit at all.

1621
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:38,350
If you're in a movie,
it's one thing if you're hitting the bag

1622
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,060
or something,
but if you're in a movie,

1623
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:45,061
you're playing boxer.
It's very important that you look like 

1624
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:45,061
someone who might get hit in the face

1625
01:10:45,061 --> 01:10:46,530
as opposed to an actor who knows what 
the cameras

1626
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:51,810
act,
who knows what the camera is and knows 

1627
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:53,271
how to throw the punches together,
but it's unrealistic because the guy's 

1628
01:10:53,271 --> 01:10:55,200
not hitting you back like it doesn't 
look like the guy can't hit you back.

1629
01:10:55,201 --> 01:10:57,420
You're not scared of the guy.
You're not posturing.

1630
01:10:57,421 --> 01:10:59,700
Like Daniel Day Lewis,
he's got his hands up,

1631
01:10:59,730 --> 01:11:01,950
he's moving,
he's throwing punches,

1632
01:11:01,951 --> 01:11:04,170
he's throwing his left hand.
His right hand is here.

1633
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:09,300
When he throws his right hand,
his left hand's here at shoulders are 

1634
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:11,511
hunched.
He's not standing like some fucking 

1635
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:11,511
superhero.
He's standing like a boxer.

1636
01:11:11,511 --> 01:11:14,430
He's like making his target small.
His footwork is excellent.

1637
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:18,400
The Way He's delivering the Jab,
right hand combination.

1638
01:11:18,401 --> 01:11:20,420
The one two combination looks very 
smooth.

1639
01:11:20,430 --> 01:11:23,730
Everything looks real and he boxed for a
full year.

1640
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:28,940
Before he did that role for a full year,
this motherfucker trained every day he 

1641
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:29,610
got up,
he went jogging.

1642
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,920
He lived like a boxer.
He went to the gym,

1643
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:33,760
he hit the mets,
he hit the speed bag,

1644
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,590
hit the heavy bag.

1645
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:39,590
He did rounds.
He put fucking vaseline on his face and 

1646
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:39,590
they.
They sent him out there with a cup on.

1647
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:42,510
They beat the shit out of each other.
He did it for a year.

1648
01:11:42,511 --> 01:11:47,511
Do a year.
He lived like a pro boxer for a fucking 

1649
01:11:47,511 --> 01:11:49,660
year and when that movie came around,
he really looked like a boxer.

1650
01:11:50,030 --> 01:11:52,050
What about,
did you see the movie warrior?

1651
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,180
Which one's the one with the.
Unfortunately I did.

1652
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:00,960
That one made me cry also.
That was a good move.

1653
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,960
It was a good movie,
great movie.

1654
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:06,360
It was poorly executed.
As far as money concerned.

1655
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,190
It was preposterous.
First of all,

1656
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,230
you would never make people fight two 
days in a row.

1657
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:15,260
It would never happen.
You can't do that because two days in a 

1658
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,991
row,
the first day you get beat the fuck up 

1659
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:17,991
everybody.
Even the people who win,

1660
01:12:17,991 --> 01:12:18,900
the next day you're sore as fuck.

1661
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:21,750
Your body's all beat up.
Your head might be,

1662
01:12:21,751 --> 01:12:24,150
you might have internal swelling.
You don't know.

1663
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,180
There's a lot of shit that goes on with 
these guys after a serious emma,

1664
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,040
so you could never do two fights in a 
row where you're going to war like that.

1665
01:12:32,070 --> 01:12:34,800
It's just not happening because this is 
not happening.

1666
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:35,820
And the.
I think the,

1667
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,510
the,
the,

1668
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:39,570
the premise could have been achieved 
with a realistic scenario.

1669
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:42,000
Like you could have people fight more 
than one time at a night.

1670
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:43,740
That's happened.
People have done that.

1671
01:12:43,741 --> 01:12:46,110
They barely limp into the final round 
sometimes,

1672
01:12:46,440 --> 01:12:51,440
but people have done it.
People have fought three times in a 

1673
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:51,440
night that's happened.
You know they did it

1674
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:52,650
in the,
in the.

1675
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:57,730
That Horian Gracie hex hex or hoist 
probably.

1676
01:12:58,520 --> 01:12:58,780
No,
no,

1677
01:12:58,781 --> 01:13:03,781
no.
The one that's in Hickson and that when 

1678
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:03,781
he fought twice in a month.
Yeah,

1679
01:13:03,781 --> 01:13:05,470
that was Japan valley too though.
Yeah,

1680
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:07,360
about three times.
Three times.

1681
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,210
Two or three times,
but three times is not uncommon.

1682
01:13:10,211 --> 01:13:12,070
Back then they used to have those 
tournament.

1683
01:13:12,071 --> 01:13:17,071
They did that recently on glory man.
Joe Showing guy was in here a couple of 

1684
01:13:17,071 --> 01:13:17,950
weeks ago.
He made it to the fucking finals man.

1685
01:13:17,951 --> 01:13:21,670
He fought three times in a night against
killer.

1686
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,790
He's finding killers.
He fought this guy.

1687
01:13:24,820 --> 01:13:29,820
The first guy he fought was undefeated.
He fights him and then he fights another

1688
01:13:30,371 --> 01:13:35,371
guy who had beaten him and then he goes 
to the finals and fights arguably the 

1689
01:13:35,371 --> 01:13:37,150
best middleweight in the world,
so it was fucking ridiculous.

1690
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:38,290
Man.
I have a hard time to.

1691
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,940
A three show nights.
Yeah,

1692
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,400
like I do that in Columbus sometimes.
I was there last week.

1693
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:43,850
I was like,
no,

1694
01:13:43,851 --> 01:13:44,720
three show.
I can't do it.

1695
01:13:45,330 --> 01:13:47,030
I was like,
are those 30 show?

1696
01:13:47,031 --> 01:13:48,800
I'm literally going.
I get on stage.

1697
01:13:48,801 --> 01:13:50,510
I'm like,
I have no idea what I've said so far.

1698
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,640
Yeah,
because you've done two shows already.

1699
01:13:52,641 --> 01:13:54,590
You're getting confused with your jokes.
Also,

1700
01:13:54,591 --> 01:13:56,510
the audience has done.
It's midnight.

1701
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:59,390
Yeah,
it's the fucking 18 and under show.

1702
01:13:59,391 --> 01:14:02,380
Usually those ones and really that's 
what they do it.

1703
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:02,960
Well,
Miami,

1704
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:07,400
Miami was 1800 was chaos.
Fucking God picks wagon chaos.

1705
01:14:07,430 --> 01:14:09,800
Like swaggy dude.
I know I've told you,

1706
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:14,820
but he had a number of times were were 
getting on the stage and showing their 

1707
01:14:14,820 --> 01:14:17,641
dicks like and I was just like,
I made friends with the wrong gang and 

1708
01:14:17,641 --> 01:14:20,840
they showed up on my show and they just 
get on stage and show their dicks and it

1709
01:14:20,910 --> 01:14:22,510
was fucking chaos.
Made friends with them,

1710
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,830
lol.

1711
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:29,010
It was,
it was like,

1712
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:31,400
it was like stepping shit.
Stupidity.

1713
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:36,640
I was doing radio DJ labs in Miami.
He's like the biggest radio guy and 

1714
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,120
there was this gang called.
There was this band called the zoe pound

1715
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:44,660
and I was like,
I'm doing radio with them and I bring in

1716
01:14:44,661 --> 01:14:49,661
Tequila and we're all drinking tequila 
and they're allowed to talk about this 

1717
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:49,661
without getting good enough.
Of course,

1718
01:14:49,661 --> 01:14:49,700
of course.
Of course.

1719
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:51,020
Yeah.
No,

1720
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:56,080
I mean it was on radio.
Every everything was up and up and all 

1721
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:56,780
this was set on radio and so I just 
started doing shots with them.

1722
01:14:56,781 --> 01:15:00,860
It's Kayla and the radio and with Tj 
last and then I invited them to the show

1723
01:15:00,861 --> 01:15:04,220
that night and then halfway through the 
song they were seeing was Amazon,

1724
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:08,930
so Amazon,
so Amazon for life or whatever.

1725
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:10,790
And I went,
you sang along with it.

1726
01:15:10,850 --> 01:15:12,320
I'm fucking,
I'm sure I was,

1727
01:15:12,321 --> 01:15:15,410
I was drunk but the uh,
halfway through I go,

1728
01:15:15,411 --> 01:15:16,550
wait.
So pat myself,

1729
01:15:16,551 --> 01:15:17,900
so familiar and literally

1730
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:23,780
so you guys don't ganglion let's Dj 
Aladdin

1731
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:26,180
losing his mind,
like mother fucker.

1732
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,790
And I had already invited him to the 
show.

1733
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:31,470
So then they came out with the show was 
fucking chaos.

1734
01:15:31,471 --> 01:15:32,030
It was absolutely

1735
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:34,020
djs asking you,
do you know what?

1736
01:15:34,021 --> 01:15:35,310
You're the one who got him in the 
studio.

1737
01:15:35,311 --> 01:15:40,311
Motherfuckers are letting me know that 
he's upset at you,

1738
01:15:40,381 --> 01:15:45,381
that you don't know who they are.
How about you telling me bitch was as a 

1739
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:45,381
secret?

1740
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:45,381
But yeah,
it was.

1741
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:45,381
So,
uh,

1742
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:50,021
and then everyone came to my show that 
night and I had to drink tequila on 

1743
01:15:50,021 --> 01:15:50,110
stage and then next day a bunch of gang 
members came on stage.

1744
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:51,850
Whether Dixon was fun,
chaos,

1745
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:53,110
heart,
or were they just,

1746
01:15:53,111 --> 01:15:55,970
they were soft and they were massive.
They were fucking massive.

1747
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:58,280
They were heckling.
So fucking bad.

1748
01:15:58,281 --> 01:15:59,980
You have no idea.
And I can't,

1749
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:01,370
I can't,
I don't know these three dudes,

1750
01:16:01,371 --> 01:16:06,371
I never met them other than I knew that 
they were armed because that's what the 

1751
01:16:06,371 --> 01:16:06,820
manager said.
The manager told you they were armed and

1752
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:07,740
kick them out.
I could do it.

1753
01:16:07,741 --> 01:16:10,180
They were heckling so bad they had 
leased credo.

1754
01:16:10,181 --> 01:16:14,690
They elected her so bad that she was 
very visibly upset.

1755
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,530
And then the guy goes on next feature 
act and his hair is matt.

1756
01:16:18,531 --> 01:16:21,500
He's like Balding Guy,
a little bit like feathered covered.

1757
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:26,710
But when it comes off it's matted sweaty
to his bald head and he's just fucking 

1758
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:26,710
like,
he's like,

1759
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:27,470
are fucking assholes.
They're ruining the show.

1760
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:31,370
And so I told the manager who's not 
there for a long time now.

1761
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:32,810
I said,
uh,

1762
01:16:33,230 --> 01:16:34,940
can you ask them to leave or tell them 
to be quiet?

1763
01:16:34,941 --> 01:16:36,100
And he was like,
I think there armed.

1764
01:16:36,110 --> 01:16:39,820
I'm not gonna fucking say anything.
Say anything.

1765
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:40,540
Yeah.

1766
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:45,010
I think he just said,
you know,

1767
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:49,170
take one on the Chin and here we go.
That's crazy.

1768
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:53,330
These people just take over their club.
Uh,

1769
01:16:53,530 --> 01:16:58,530
yeah.
The possible potential threat of 

1770
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:01,241
violence.
They're letting these people just 

1771
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:01,241
dictate what goes on in their club.
They're letting these people believe,

1772
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:03,140
believe the club around.
That's what's going on,

1773
01:17:03,141 --> 01:17:03,430
right?
Yeah.

1774
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:04,640
I mean,
but here's the deal.

1775
01:17:04,641 --> 01:17:06,380
Here's the deal.
I'd argue to say this,

1776
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:08,480
that you probably hit up but her 
differently,

1777
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:10,520
but you're very different guy.
Me Or Bobby Kelly,

1778
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:16,000
but like I feel like there's a New York 
vibe and I just know how to deal with 

1779
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:16,730
that bad element where they're not 
getting kicked out.

1780
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:18,770
They've already paid.
They're going to be sitting here.

1781
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:24,170
So I would just ask them questions that 
I already had the answers to that were 

1782
01:17:24,170 --> 01:17:24,230
set up to my jokes or bits I could get 
into.

1783
01:17:24,350 --> 01:17:29,350
And then they were fine.
They don't want to just ruined the shot.

1784
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:33,360
Sometimes people just want to ruin a 
show to have a good time.

1785
01:17:33,570 --> 01:17:36,380
Yeah,
like all hecklers not created equal.

1786
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,510
There's some,
some people heckled shit and it's,

1787
01:17:38,690 --> 01:17:40,340
it's funny.
I think.

1788
01:17:40,341 --> 01:17:40,800
I don't know.
I've,

1789
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:43,490
I've dealt with a number of hecklers and
I had,

1790
01:17:43,690 --> 01:17:46,700
and I feel like starting in New York,
you can,

1791
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:48,200
it's easy.
It's not easy,

1792
01:17:48,201 --> 01:17:50,060
but you just know how to fucking shut it
down.

1793
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:52,040
Well,
you get used to being fucked with.

1794
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,230
You know,
we were talking about that yesterday,

1795
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:55,580
Brennan,
Brian,

1796
01:17:55,610 --> 01:18:00,610
Kaylin and I about actors,
like some actors who take themselves 

1797
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:02,450
super fucking seriously.
You can't joke around with them at all.

1798
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:03,510
They'll just,
they'll,

1799
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:08,610
they'll get fucking furious.
They have no sense of humor and they 

1800
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:08,610
storm off.
You know,

1801
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:10,250
I think people who've been fucked with a
bunch,

1802
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,190
you know what getting fucked with is 
like you walk out,

1803
01:18:13,191 --> 01:18:13,970
they're like,
ah,

1804
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:15,470
it's fucking bro.
What's up guys?

1805
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,150
To get used to it,
you know,

1806
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,880
like what?
Why are you guys giving me a hard time?

1807
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:23,420
When did just accept the way I look.
I have body image issues already because

1808
01:18:23,470 --> 01:18:24,170
you're fucking,
oh,

1809
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:26,420
it's my breasts.
You don't like my breasts,

1810
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,590
okay,
well fuck you.

1811
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:31,820
This is me.
You get on or get off the boat ride.

1812
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,420
Okay,
I'm not changing.

1813
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:38,420
This is who I am.
Like really self indulgent,

1814
01:18:38,421 --> 01:18:39,770
actory type thinking.

1815
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:45,610
Well then you know,
you would have a hard time with 

1816
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:48,041
hecklers,
but if you're a guy that's like a guy 

1817
01:18:48,041 --> 01:18:50,501
who did stand up at the store,
you know the store doesn't have any 

1818
01:18:50,501 --> 01:18:51,350
crowd control.
So I started out there.

1819
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:54,590
No one ever stopped anybody from young 
shit out.

1820
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:59,650
Very similar mentality.
Same as New York that would kick people 

1821
01:18:59,650 --> 01:18:59,650
out though.
Shit get ugly.

1822
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:03,670
They would kick people out.
They were just figuring out a way to do 

1823
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:03,670
it.
See I'm.

1824
01:19:03,670 --> 01:19:06,571
I am the opposite.
I'm the exact opposite of that in that 

1825
01:19:06,571 --> 01:19:08,720
I'm maybe not perfect for hecklers,
but I want everyone to like me.

1826
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:11,600
That's a massive fucking underlying tone
to my personality.

1827
01:19:12,530 --> 01:19:14,330
Even if they say something hurtful or 
mean,

1828
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,440
I don't snap on them,
it takes a lot for me to stop.

1829
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,460
Well,
you should just as a craftsman,

1830
01:19:19,490 --> 01:19:24,490
not snap on them immediately anyway,
unless it's the funny thing to do and 

1831
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:24,490
you've got to know when it is.

1832
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:28,780
It's like a weird sort of.
Sometimes it's funny to just snap on 

1833
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:29,450
someone right away and not as long as 
you don't really mean it.

1834
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:34,490
Like that's the thing too.
Like you can't actually be angry when 

1835
01:19:34,490 --> 01:19:34,820
you snapping.
There has to be a smile there.

1836
01:19:35,050 --> 01:19:40,050
I mean like a real legitimate smile.
You have to be enjoying yourself and it 

1837
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:43,691
has to be that what you're doing is 
you're putting on an improvised 

1838
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:43,691
performance,
dealing with these variables,

1839
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:45,700
these people in the audience,
and if you can do that,

1840
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:47,730
you can manage that.
You can make a like a,

1841
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:52,430
a crazy situation become fun,
but it's like some people can't.

1842
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:54,740
It's not their style.
Some people style is,

1843
01:19:55,460 --> 01:19:57,950
I prepared a performance and if you 
heckled me,

1844
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:02,951
you're ruining what I've prepared and 
what I prepared is not better than 

1845
01:20:02,951 --> 01:20:07,181
dealing with you and you're fucking up 
for all these people around you and 

1846
01:20:07,181 --> 01:20:07,181
they're right to man,
right?

1847
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:11,250
Live performances or weird.
You can't control.

1848
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:13,980
It's a crazy agreement that works most 
of the time.

1849
01:20:13,981 --> 01:20:18,981
I mean,
it is a great testament to how fucking 

1850
01:20:18,981 --> 01:20:21,590
cool people are that stand up works as 
often as it does mean when everybody 

1851
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,040
looks shit like we're talking about the 
news,

1852
01:20:23,041 --> 01:20:28,041
about how the news is always 
highlighting all these negative things 

1853
01:20:28,041 --> 01:20:31,250
because really what the news is an 
entertainment show and the best way to 

1854
01:20:31,250 --> 01:20:33,510
get you to be paying attention is to 
scare you,

1855
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:38,750
not to show you robust views of happy 
people thriving in this world and being 

1856
01:20:40,861 --> 01:20:44,490
loving and successful,
which is a great majority of people,

1857
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:49,610
way more than just small.
That small percentage gets to the news 

1858
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,620
and so you look at the news like the 
world's over run with cons,

1859
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:53,940
but it's.
It's not,

1860
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:58,970
it's not.
It's just that's what they're showing 

1861
01:20:58,970 --> 01:20:58,970
you.
Like that's what's in front of you.

1862
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:00,360
If you look at how many goddamn clearly 
shows go on,

1863
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:03,900
the great majority of people are fucking
amazing.

1864
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:09,260
The great majority.
It's just a very few people that go one 

1865
01:21:09,260 --> 01:21:10,750
out of 300,
maybe 600.

1866
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:15,830
I like the thing that drives me more 
nuts than heckling as those people who 

1867
01:21:15,830 --> 01:21:18,600
talk to other people about something.
That's what drives me nuts as a table of

1868
01:21:18,601 --> 01:21:23,601
eight where a guy's talking across the 
table and you've seen him leaning 

1869
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:23,601
forward,
knowing like,

1870
01:21:23,601 --> 01:21:24,030
hey,
let's say like don't mind heckling.

1871
01:21:24,031 --> 01:21:29,031
I feel like that's the way to.
My buddy was black from him saying that 

1872
01:21:29,031 --> 01:21:32,181
racism is.
I'd rather know you're fucking racist 

1873
01:21:32,181 --> 01:21:32,181
and know where my les than have you do 
it behind my back then.

1874
01:21:32,181 --> 01:21:32,910
Then you're sneaky.
Yeah,

1875
01:21:32,940 --> 01:21:35,340
definitely.
You want to know if somebody who doesn't

1876
01:21:35,341 --> 01:21:38,820
like your son's going to be a problem.
So there's people that talk,

1877
01:21:38,821 --> 01:21:39,930
like just talk like shit.

1878
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:45,350
I just fucking.
That will make me crazy and that'll 

1879
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:45,350
snap.
That'll be weird.

1880
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:49,910
Yeah.
I've seen people talk like not why I've 

1881
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:50,100
been onstage,
but rather while other people,

1882
01:21:50,101 --> 01:21:55,101
but on stage I've seen people like like 
talk shit about the comedians 

1883
01:21:55,101 --> 01:21:59,751
performances like in the front row and 
then I saw what Nick Depalo or 

1884
01:21:59,751 --> 01:21:59,751
something,
Nick Depaulo,

1885
01:21:59,751 --> 01:22:03,000
some guy was like,
he had his arms crossed and nick,

1886
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,280
even though nick was killing with the 
rest of the crowd,

1887
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:08,100
he's like this fucking guy with his arms
crossed like what's going on here?

1888
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:08,900
Like what?
Yeah,

1889
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:12,600
my job's not good enough for you.
Like became like this session with them.

1890
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:17,890
His arms crossed,
the guy had his arms crossed but I've 

1891
01:22:17,890 --> 01:22:20,061
seen people like talk shit about people 
like this guy sucks like in the front 

1892
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:23,271
row and you see the color blue.
How's this guy going to do with the 

1893
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:23,271
comic deal with it?

1894
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:27,140
Like oh I suck sir.
You know like you know what's going on 

1895
01:22:27,140 --> 01:22:28,740
here?
And you always winds up being.

1896
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:31,080
These people were way less clever than 
they think they are.

1897
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:33,730
They think they're going to get you.
And it's almost like,

1898
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:38,900
like when someone throws a haymaker at 
you and you just get out of the way of 

1899
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:38,900
it,
you're like,

1900
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:39,270
what was that supposed to hit me?
And I'm like,

1901
01:22:39,271 --> 01:22:41,880
Oh shit,
now you know you're going to be in for a

1902
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:46,880
long night because now you're actually 
having a conversation with a stand up 

1903
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:46,950
instead of being able to say to your 
friend of this guy sucks.

1904
01:22:47,100 --> 01:22:49,980
Now this guy's gonna focus on you to 
trip up.

1905
01:22:50,350 --> 01:22:53,190
You're just kinda okay.
Unless you're some fucking comedy wizard

1906
01:22:53,191 --> 01:22:54,440
that's undercover,
that's,

1907
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:59,640
you know Kay.
And even then you don't have a 

1908
01:22:59,640 --> 01:22:59,640
microphone.
You're going to,

1909
01:22:59,640 --> 01:23:00,030
you're going to get beaten up by someone
who's a real comic.

1910
01:23:00,030 --> 01:23:02,610
They're gonna be able to chew you up.
But they don't think that.

1911
01:23:02,670 --> 01:23:04,380
They don't think that they think they're
smarter.

1912
01:23:04,381 --> 01:23:09,381
Like when people see people fight.
I can't tell you how many times where 

1913
01:23:09,381 --> 01:23:12,750
people after UFC goes,
why the fuck didn't the guy just do 

1914
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:12,750
this?
Why does he just do it?

1915
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:13,810
Why is he fucking hit them with the 
right hand?

1916
01:23:13,811 --> 01:23:15,250
Like,
what are you talking about?

1917
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,070
Think it's not an easy to punch somebody
like,

1918
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:22,080
what are you crazy?
You don't think he sees the right hand 

1919
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:22,080
coming,
who's right in front of them.

1920
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:22,080
Oh,
okay.

1921
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:26,491
Why don't you go do it?
You don't know what you're talking 

1922
01:23:26,491 --> 01:23:26,491
about.
Were trying to do this.

1923
01:23:26,491 --> 01:23:26,491
This is crazy talk.
When they.

1924
01:23:26,491 --> 01:23:31,410
If they actually got out there,
they would shit their pants and realize 

1925
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:31,410
like,
oh,

1926
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:35,221
this is a moving target that's better at
this than me and they're moving faster 

1927
01:23:35,221 --> 01:23:36,520
than I can move.
I'm going to get hit in the head.

1928
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:38,740
Oh my God.
And then really thinking about getting a

1929
01:23:38,741 --> 01:23:40,030
hit in the head.
He try to throw a punch.

1930
01:23:40,031 --> 01:23:41,890
I.
Yeah.

1931
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,600
That's reality.
Every time you throw a punch,

1932
01:23:43,660 --> 01:23:46,210
Bang,
you get your fucking head knocked back.

1933
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:49,570
That that's reality.
When people are watching shit,

1934
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:52,660
they're ridiculous.
Confidence plus booze.

1935
01:23:52,810 --> 01:23:57,810
They give this stupid distorted idea of 
who they are in the greater spectrum 

1936
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:02,761
thing.
They think they're better at something 

1937
01:24:02,761 --> 01:24:02,761
than you without even ever dealing it,
which is hilarious.

1938
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:06,590
Amazing how fast a real life punch.
Like how you're right.

1939
01:24:06,591 --> 01:24:11,591
You can kind of do.
It's almost like a dance move in your 

1940
01:24:11,591 --> 01:24:11,840
head versus the dance move.
You really do.

1941
01:24:12,050 --> 01:24:14,630
Like I've only done one punch and I 
fucking.

1942
01:24:14,631 --> 01:24:19,631
When I did that cracked my nose on my 
knee because I ducked way too fucking 

1943
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:20,570
hard.
I just went black and fucking was like,

1944
01:24:20,571 --> 01:24:23,480
Holy Shit.
But that's the reality of it is you go,

1945
01:24:23,481 --> 01:24:26,510
I know what to do by just have never 
done the dance myself.

1946
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:28,490
Well,
that's what that Daniel Day Lewis,

1947
01:24:28,491 --> 01:24:28,560
this

1948
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,650
guy did a reason why he looks so good as
a boxer.

1949
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:34,530
He was out there moving with real 
boxers,

1950
01:24:34,531 --> 01:24:35,970
getting hit,
ducking,

1951
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:38,190
bobbing and weaving so that when he was 
in there,

1952
01:24:38,191 --> 01:24:43,191
he had a realistic sense of the 
movements that you would actually be 

1953
01:24:43,191 --> 01:24:45,030
performing while you're fighting as 
opposed to like a lot of guys like,

1954
01:24:45,031 --> 01:24:46,590
yeah,
and then I might hit him with a punch.

1955
01:24:46,591 --> 01:24:51,210
He's going to go falling back to when 
your face is wide open up bob and you're

1956
01:24:51,211 --> 01:24:52,510
not leaving.
It's,

1957
01:24:52,511 --> 01:24:53,460
it's,
you know,

1958
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:58,610
it's unrealistic sense of competence 
without experience is the sign of a 

1959
01:24:59,131 --> 01:25:02,010
fucking idiot.
And that's a really common thing,

1960
01:25:02,011 --> 01:25:07,011
especially with men.
Men with testosterone and alcohol 

1961
01:25:07,011 --> 01:25:08,940
combined with very little,
few,

1962
01:25:08,941 --> 01:25:13,941
very few real live experiences as far as
like really having to pull yourself up,

1963
01:25:14,670 --> 01:25:18,150
really having to dig down deep and find 
out what your character is all about.

1964
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:23,360
There's a lot of guys going through life
that never find out who the fuck they 

1965
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:23,360
really are.
When the going gets rough,

1966
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:24,960
they just don't know.
They've never been there,

1967
01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:30,110
so their idea of what they're capable of
or how they would respond to those 

1968
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:33,711
situations is based on fucking movies.
It's based on like hero bullshit movies.

1969
01:25:34,681 --> 01:25:39,681
You know the Guy Kicks Your Butt Jazz.
That's why I'm fucking door kick her 

1970
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:39,681
buddies.
I saw u two video,

1971
01:25:39,681 --> 01:25:40,920
I know what to do.
I'll kick this guy's ass.

1972
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:44,160
Kicked the reality.
Those that's terrifying.

1973
01:25:44,161 --> 01:25:45,470
There's no rules.
So this is.

1974
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:48,720
This is a wild like no one knows that's 
going to happen here.

1975
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:53,960
This is completely improvisational and 
it involves violence and involves you 

1976
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:58,251
being successful at achieving violence 
on someone who's probably been doing it 

1977
01:25:58,251 --> 01:25:59,220
way longer than you know the way better 
at you.

1978
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:04,400
Just like a comic is way better at 
cracking jokes and a person who's never 

1979
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:04,400
been on cracking jokes.

1980
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,730
When you see actors play comics and 
movies and you go,

1981
01:26:07,731 --> 01:26:08,240
oh,
that's,

1982
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:13,241
you're clearly acting.
You were clearly are because you never 

1983
01:26:13,241 --> 01:26:15,341
did stand up because I know right now,
but if there was a stand up to him that 

1984
01:26:15,341 --> 01:26:19,271
he would simply be doing stand up and 
they'd be filming it as opposed to 

1985
01:26:19,271 --> 01:26:20,740
watching them act as if they're font.
Oh,

1986
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:23,810
it's fucking painful and fucking sally 
field.

1987
01:26:23,811 --> 01:26:27,940
I was just thinking one is awful.
Oh,

1988
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,460
it's painful,
Lord.

1989
01:26:29,530 --> 01:26:31,820
Still fucking one with um,
there was no.

1990
01:26:31,821 --> 01:26:32,200
Yeah,
there was.

1991
01:26:32,260 --> 01:26:33,680
There's more that have been out like 
that,

1992
01:26:33,681 --> 01:26:38,681
but we just watched someone who's 
clearly not a standup in your life like 

1993
01:26:38,681 --> 01:26:39,410
now.
And I think seth Rogan's very funny,

1994
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:41,990
but he's not a stand up stand up.
Maybe he's not.

1995
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,020
How dare you.
He's.

1996
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:48,420
It was.
Have you ever seen this Canadian 

1997
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:49,310
performance he has on his first 
performance in Canada?

1998
01:26:49,490 --> 01:26:50,660
Online.
You should watch it,

1999
01:26:50,661 --> 01:26:51,830
man.
It was a really funny.

2000
01:26:52,090 --> 01:26:55,400
I think he's hilarious in all his 
movies.

2001
01:26:55,401 --> 01:26:57,290
I think he's an amazing writer.
An amazing actor.

2002
01:26:57,291 --> 01:26:59,660
I love watching the guy,
but just when I saw him in that movie,

2003
01:26:59,661 --> 01:27:01,670
I thought it was a great actress in it,
but we did stand up.

2004
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:06,680
I thought he was doing a version of 
someone else that people thought he 

2005
01:27:06,680 --> 01:27:07,130
would be doing as opposed to seth rogen 
the movies.

2006
01:27:07,131 --> 01:27:09,800
I watch the movies I watched when I 
watched him be funny.

2007
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,820
That is not him being funny like that,
that that's not the translation of that.

2008
01:27:13,821 --> 01:27:18,821
You know?
Another problem is what when they have 

2009
01:27:18,821 --> 01:27:18,821
those movies were guys who stand up on 
stage.

2010
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:21,260
The materials never good,
right?

2011
01:27:21,261 --> 01:27:26,261
You know why you're never going to give 
you good material that you could use 

2012
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:26,660
their fucking movie.
Fuck you.

2013
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:31,870
If I come up with a.
If I'm writing for a movie about stand 

2014
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:31,870
up and I come up with a really good 
idea,

2015
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:33,890
I'm not going in that Muslim village 
that's going over here.

2016
01:27:34,100 --> 01:27:39,100
I'm going to store that.
I'm going to give you some mediocre 

2017
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,201
nonsense that you could add.
I always think that about writers for 

2018
01:27:41,201 --> 01:27:41,900
like a productivity shows that started 
up stand up.

2019
01:27:41,901 --> 01:27:43,580
So I'm like,
there's no way I couldn't.

2020
01:27:43,581 --> 01:27:45,110
I could never,
I'd never write for anybody.

2021
01:27:45,111 --> 01:27:46,370
I can never write for anybody that can 
never,

2022
01:27:46,700 --> 01:27:51,700
that's not me.
I could never take material from other 

2023
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:51,700
people.
I need to.

2024
01:27:51,700 --> 01:27:52,640
It all needs to be mine.
It needs to come from you entirely.

2025
01:27:52,820 --> 01:27:54,890
100%.
And it needs to be my words.

2026
01:27:54,980 --> 01:27:57,140
Some guys can't do that.
They don't have the time,

2027
01:27:57,280 --> 01:28:02,280
you know,
they're doing a bunch of movies and so 

2028
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:02,280
they just don't.

2029
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,260
They're terrible writers.
I don't think there's anything wrong 

2030
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:05,260
with hiring writers,
if that's what you want to do.

2031
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:05,990
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with it.

2032
01:28:05,991 --> 01:28:07,510
I don't do it.
Um,

2033
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:09,860
most of my friends don't do it.
I don't know anybody who does it.

2034
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:13,220
I know a guy who does it,
but I don't know him personally,

2035
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:16,560
but it's fine.
I mean,

2036
01:28:16,561 --> 01:28:17,300
it's,
it's a,

2037
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:18,090
it's,
uh,

2038
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:23,100
an honest exchange.
I don't know when Larry the cable guy 

2039
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,980
doing it or Jeff Foxworthy,
your bill angle.

2040
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:30,340
I just think anyone who's not a 
household name in that respect,

2041
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:32,240
uh,
just thought I just fucking tap out.

2042
01:28:33,030 --> 01:28:38,030
1996.
Seth rogen doing standup comedy in 

2043
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:38,030
Canada.
Wow.

2044
01:28:38,030 --> 01:28:38,480
Yeah.
No,

2045
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:40,110
he's a comic.
I heard him on me.

2046
01:28:40,140 --> 01:28:43,470
The company talking about it.
He definitely started out as a colleague

2047
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:46,880
county in a movie.
Again,

2048
01:28:46,881 --> 01:28:49,220
he's probably not doing stand up right 
now under.

2049
01:28:49,221 --> 01:28:51,800
I think he did a little bit for that 
movie to prepare for it,

2050
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,920
but he's not doing it enough to where 
he's got like 20 killer minutes that he 

2051
01:28:56,920 --> 01:29:00,530
could do in the movie and they give him 
some whack ass material.

2052
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:02,390
The good stuff going to use on stage,

2053
01:29:02,640 --> 01:29:07,640
you're going to use it for a special.
You're going to use it like if you're a 

2054
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:10,071
comic especially,
and the guys who were good comics are 

2055
01:29:10,071 --> 01:29:11,130
the guys who are going to be good at 
writing standup comedy.

2056
01:29:11,131 --> 01:29:14,460
If someone's never done standup comedy,
it's just theoretical.

2057
01:29:14,461 --> 01:29:19,461
Whether or not their jokes are good.
There's a lot of people that write for 

2058
01:29:19,461 --> 01:29:21,090
sitcoms that have never done stand up 
and never performed,

2059
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:26,240
and they have some ideas what they think
will be funny in a scene and 

2060
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:26,610
occasionally there.
Right.

2061
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:27,750
Occasionally.
Right.

2062
01:29:27,751 --> 01:29:30,420
But they're wrong is almost as much as 
they're right.

2063
01:29:30,780 --> 01:29:32,700
You know,
unless they're really good writers,

2064
01:29:32,730 --> 01:29:37,730
you know,
on a really good show with we've got a 

2065
01:29:37,730 --> 01:29:39,800
tremendous amount experience.
They've got a good feel of the dynamic 

2066
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,150
of these situations and what's going to 
be funny about the pause and what can be

2067
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:44,730
funny about this line in response to the
pause,

2068
01:29:45,210 --> 01:29:48,750
but a lot of them are just guessing,
guessing like you'll get scripts.

2069
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,200
Dude,
I've read some scripts I've read.

2070
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:52,850
I've read a script recently where I'm 
like,

2071
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:56,800
you gotta be fucking kidding me.
Realize none of this is funny that my go

2072
01:29:56,801 --> 01:29:59,190
on page after page.
Like when does it get to be funny?

2073
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:02,430
You fucking lazy concept like this.
This is shit.

2074
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:06,330
This is like shit writing.
But that's a lot of it out there man.

2075
01:30:06,331 --> 01:30:08,610
Go Watch an episode of fucking two and a
half men.

2076
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:13,620
Charlie Sheen left Jesus Christ though 
you'll have a heart attack.

2077
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:16,400
Who were the jocks?
Why don't you just.

2078
01:30:17,250 --> 01:30:22,250
What are you trying to make me watch it 
when he was still on the show,

2079
01:30:22,561 --> 01:30:26,040
same shit sometimes.
Sometimes they lose half decent

2080
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:30,800
of funny,
you know,

2081
01:30:30,801 --> 01:30:33,330
half decent premises.
That kid,

2082
01:30:33,950 --> 01:30:34,700
the kid,
uh,

2083
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:36,570
passed away.
Harold Harris whittles.

2084
01:30:36,730 --> 01:30:38,060
Uh,
he was,

2085
01:30:38,061 --> 01:30:38,400
uh,
he,

2086
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:42,920
I read that some of his writings from 
Aziz Ansari wrote a blog about him.

2087
01:30:43,220 --> 01:30:45,960
The kid,
his writings were fucking hilarious.

2088
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:47,140
Shit.
That's all.

2089
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:49,550
I think I met him one time in Houston a 
long time ago.

2090
01:30:49,551 --> 01:30:52,480
We worked the door,
but who he is,

2091
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:55,670
that's fun.
It's really hard to translate even being

2092
01:30:55,671 --> 01:30:58,420
funny on stage to writing a script and 
making it funny.

2093
01:30:58,850 --> 01:31:00,410
Really fucking hard.
Yeah,

2094
01:31:00,411 --> 01:31:03,290
it's hard.
It's hard to get a real genuine sense of

2095
01:31:03,291 --> 01:31:08,291
interaction between two human beings 
when you're trying to put in punch 

2096
01:31:08,291 --> 01:31:08,690
lines.
Oh God.

2097
01:31:08,691 --> 01:31:12,110
Some people are so bad at it.
I got fucking really spoiled because the

2098
01:31:12,111 --> 01:31:16,880
writers on news radio were really good 
to have no idea how to play that show us

2099
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,590
no.
Just as an outside wall.

2100
01:31:19,610 --> 01:31:21,980
Someone who watches it,
like you have no idea.

2101
01:31:21,981 --> 01:31:24,620
Like because you had to deal with Andy 
Dick every day.

2102
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:25,660
It was all right.
No,

2103
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:27,800
but I mean like even just working with 
them,

2104
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:31,070
like on the,
from the outside looking in and Dick was

2105
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:35,120
so goddamn hilarious on that show.
It's a real tragedy that,

2106
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:36,060
that character,
that,

2107
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:39,680
that didn't turn him into fucking what 
Ben Stiller is,

2108
01:31:39,681 --> 01:31:41,820
you know,
it's just crazy.

2109
01:31:42,430 --> 01:31:44,480
No,
I mean he got the Andy Dick show and all

2110
01:31:44,481 --> 01:31:49,481
the other stuff and you know,
Andy will tell you himself that it was 

2111
01:31:49,481 --> 01:31:51,821
more battling demons and anything.
He's got a lot of demons thing that he's

2112
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:57,460
talking about on his instagram the other
day I looked at it and it was a him 

2113
01:31:57,460 --> 01:31:57,920
drinking some healthy drink.
He's like,

2114
01:31:57,921 --> 01:32:00,310
thank God I'm addicted to something 
healthy for once.

2115
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:01,890
You know?
I mean that's his,

2116
01:32:01,891 --> 01:32:03,040
his,
his deal.

2117
01:32:03,060 --> 01:32:05,710
It just is always going to be as deal.
But we used to do scenes.

2118
01:32:05,711 --> 01:32:08,500
We had to do it like three or four times
because I couldn't fucking not laugh.

2119
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:09,940
Oh really?
Break,

2120
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:12,400
break.
Because he drove me nuts on this set.

2121
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:13,540
Right.
Sometimes.

2122
01:32:13,630 --> 01:32:15,010
Sometimes it was great.
I mean,

2123
01:32:15,011 --> 01:32:20,011
out of all the times we worked together,
he didn't drive me nuts the majority of 

2124
01:32:20,011 --> 01:32:20,050
the time.
It wasn't that bad.

2125
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:25,110
He,
he became way more out of control after 

2126
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:25,110
he left the show that he was on the 
show,

2127
01:32:25,110 --> 01:32:27,190
like really getting arrested and all 
that stuff.

2128
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,230
That didn't go on while I was on the 
show.

2129
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,510
The.
Did you guys have a set of.

2130
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:36,750
I don't think I've ever asked you this.
Did you have a set next door to 

2131
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:36,750
Geraldo's?
Yes.

2132
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:40,840
That.
Did you guys use to drink beers after 

2133
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:40,840
or?
We would go to a while.

2134
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:42,700
We just drink beer on the set.
We drink beer.

2135
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:45,700
I'm down the street.
There was this bar that we used to go to

2136
01:32:45,820 --> 01:32:48,310
that would be like a lot of different 
shows would go there.

2137
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,920
I hung out with the dude from A.
Everybody loves Raymond.

2138
01:32:50,921 --> 01:32:54,550
The old man.
What's The guy's dad?

2139
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,090
A famous actor to fast,
so no.

2140
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:01,300
Oh Fuck Peter.
Yes.

2141
01:33:01,360 --> 01:33:02,410
Not O'toole.
Peter.

2142
01:33:02,690 --> 01:33:05,020
He was in young Frankenstein oil.
Poured a Peter Boyle.

2143
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:05,890
Yeah.
Peter Boyle.

2144
01:33:05,891 --> 01:33:07,390
Yeah,
he was in young Frankenstein.

2145
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,790
He was in a bunch of movies,
has been around a long time.

2146
01:33:09,791 --> 01:33:14,791
He was cool as fuck.
We got to hang out with a lot of cool 

2147
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:17,491
people back there.
I was wanting to party with the girl 

2148
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:17,491
that was on your show.
Which one?

2149
01:33:17,491 --> 01:33:20,410
Melissa?
The hearing I remember.

2150
01:33:20,411 --> 01:33:23,710
I think I heard for Geraldo say she was 
just fun to party with.

2151
01:33:23,770 --> 01:33:25,120
She liked to drink.
Yeah,

2152
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:27,720
she likes to get fucked up,
but she's hilarious too.

2153
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:29,640
She's very funny.
She's a really good actress,

2154
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:31,360
actor,
whatever you want to call it.

2155
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:36,390
She's so good that sometimes we'd be 
doing scenes and I wouldn't really know 

2156
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,430
that we started doing the scene.
I'd be.

2157
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:38,620
I thought she was just talking because 
you know,

2158
01:33:38,621 --> 01:33:42,490
like she was like so natural the way she
would act as it was really natural,

2159
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:43,300
kind of creepy.

2160
01:33:43,690 --> 01:33:46,630
Like it'd be like woo,
but it's like that's the craft,

2161
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:51,840
the craft of like sliding effortlessly 
into a role with no bullshit about it 

2162
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:57,030
and that's something that's very hard 
for a lot of people to do and it's very 

2163
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,460
hard for a lot of people to write that 
way as well.

2164
01:33:58,060 --> 01:33:59,360
That's the big thing.
Like you've got to,

2165
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,590
for an actor,
like you get a great actor,

2166
01:34:01,591 --> 01:34:03,460
like a Stephen Root,
like Stephen Root,

2167
01:34:03,461 --> 01:34:06,040
like never.
He didn't really add Lib.

2168
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,290
They would write,
he had a very specific,

2169
01:34:08,291 --> 01:34:13,060
very um,
like clear character Jimmy James.

2170
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:15,870
So he's not anything like that guy.
He met him.

2171
01:34:15,930 --> 01:34:17,680
No,
I think the biggest sweetheart,

2172
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:18,670
he's like,
he's like,

2173
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:19,720
you know,
Jimmy James,

2174
01:34:19,721 --> 01:34:22,420
the boss is like the slick talking guy 
and you know,

2175
01:34:22,670 --> 01:34:27,670
it was kind of like,
not dumb but not really interested in 

2176
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:27,670
like he was here.
Yeah.

2177
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:28,570
Dude,
that show was,

2178
01:34:28,750 --> 01:34:33,750
I mean I show was honestly,
and I know you guys always teetered on 

2179
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:33,750
whether or not you're going to get 
renewed.

2180
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:37,480
That shows one of my favorite shows I've
ever seen ever on television.

2181
01:34:37,660 --> 01:34:40,410
Quantum leap number one,
that shone number two.

2182
01:34:40,420 --> 01:34:41,410
I mean like,
Hey,

2183
01:34:41,411 --> 01:34:46,411
we're in love.
The company got moved nine times.

2184
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:48,940
News radio moved nine times before the 
Internet,

2185
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:51,870
so there was no internet back then,
whether it was in internet.

2186
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,460
I guess the Internet sort of started in 
1994,

2187
01:34:54,610 --> 01:34:58,150
but nobody was using it to find out what
time shows were on.

2188
01:34:58,610 --> 01:35:02,120
The amount of people that were on the 
Internet back then was fucking nil.

2189
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:04,490
I mean it was just.
Yeah,

2190
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:06,630
it was during Dialup,
it was during 14,

2191
01:35:06,631 --> 01:35:08,120
four,
but dialogue,

2192
01:35:08,210 --> 01:35:13,210
that's when it started fucking 14 form 
baud modems when everything was slow as 

2193
01:35:17,091 --> 01:35:22,091
fuck.
If you want to download a picture of 

2194
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:22,091
tits,
it would be like chunk,

2195
01:35:22,091 --> 01:35:22,490
chunk,
chunk,

2196
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:25,250
chunk,
and also start off now.

2197
01:35:25,251 --> 01:35:27,510
And then it's a dick.
This will be loaded by the time I come,

2198
01:35:27,511 --> 01:35:30,410
but they get past her tits and she's,
she's jerking off.

2199
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:35,450
She's Kinda tick the um,
but the show moved nine different times.

2200
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,060
So it'd because you guys weren't like a 
definite hit.

2201
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:41,150
Does that mean you guys,
I feel like when it hits,

2202
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,750
it brings the cast closer together.
I don't know.

2203
01:35:44,751 --> 01:35:46,520
I mean we definitely couldn't get a big 
head,

2204
01:35:46,850 --> 01:35:51,850
which is good because there's a lot of 
people that get big heads when they get 

2205
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:51,850
successful.
There's no way around.

2206
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:53,000
It happens.
It happens.

2207
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:58,001
So often.
We're talking about the other day about 

2208
01:35:58,001 --> 01:35:58,001
this,
uh,

2209
01:35:58,001 --> 01:36:01,930
this show where this guy got on it and 
then immediately start acting like a 

2210
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:03,080
cunt.
Like just thought he was.

2211
01:36:03,081 --> 01:36:05,690
Every reality show the whole world 
revolved around.

2212
01:36:05,691 --> 01:36:06,830
It wasn't a reality,
shows us,

2213
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:12,640
the whole world revolved around them and
they wanted to fucking ruining his 

2214
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:15,641
entire career,
but that just happens when things get 

2215
01:36:15,641 --> 01:36:18,551
successful.
Something happens when certain people 

2216
01:36:18,551 --> 01:36:21,401
get successful when especially like 
actors and there's all a part of them 

2217
01:36:21,401 --> 01:36:23,510
that almost like serial killers want to 
get caught.

2218
01:36:25,810 --> 01:36:28,070
This is a part of actors where they're 
act.

2219
01:36:28,071 --> 01:36:33,071
They act so ridiculous that they almost 
want someone to call them on it.

2220
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:34,730
Like they,
they,

2221
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:38,810
they almost want someone to tell them,
hey,

2222
01:36:38,811 --> 01:36:41,000
you're being a fucking cunt.
And they're like,

2223
01:36:41,001 --> 01:36:41,600
yeah,
you know,

2224
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:46,620
ever clearly was like,
there's a comedy movie that my friend 

2225
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:51,161
did with this guy and the guy's a famous
guy and in the middle of the scene he 

2226
01:36:51,161 --> 01:36:52,940
just starts smashing this car.
He can't.

2227
01:36:52,941 --> 01:36:57,941
He fucked up.
So he starts kicking at his car and he 

2228
01:36:57,941 --> 01:37:01,811
breaks the windows and he breaks his 
side mirror off and you just fucking 

2229
01:37:01,811 --> 01:37:02,720
picks up something and smashes it 
against his car.

2230
01:37:02,721 --> 01:37:07,721
Fucks his car up and,
and I don't know it was somebody's car 

2231
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:11,420
over his productions car or what is.
But he felt like he was such a big deal.

2232
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:16,450
He's a very famous guy that at the time 
he just felt like he gets smashed this 

2233
01:37:16,450 --> 01:37:16,450
car.

2234
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:20,480
So just smashed the car on set.
Yeah,

2235
01:37:20,810 --> 01:37:25,810
I mean it's just one of those things.
It's like he kind of went crazy like he 

2236
01:37:25,810 --> 01:37:27,050
but he went crazy because he could get 
away with it.

2237
01:37:27,120 --> 01:37:32,120
They cleaned it all up and he paid for 
whatever the damage was in the car and 

2238
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:32,120
that's where it ended.
And it's like,

2239
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,020
it's,
it's one of those things.

2240
01:37:33,021 --> 01:37:38,021
It's like,
you can't do that if you're in the 

2241
01:37:38,021 --> 01:37:38,021
teamsters,
you can't do the craft service guy.

2242
01:37:38,021 --> 01:37:39,470
The craft service guy can't say,
look,

2243
01:37:39,471 --> 01:37:40,940
I'm going to pay for that car.
I fucked it up.

2244
01:37:40,941 --> 01:37:41,360
Like,
no,

2245
01:37:41,361 --> 01:37:43,550
you're not going to pay for.
You're going to go to jail.

2246
01:37:43,551 --> 01:37:44,990
You asshole.
Yeah.

2247
01:37:44,991 --> 01:37:47,000
Eventually you'll pay for it.
Even if you do pay for it,

2248
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:48,530
fuck you.
You don't work here anymore.

2249
01:37:48,810 --> 01:37:50,330
I don't care how good your egg 
sandwiches.

2250
01:37:50,331 --> 01:37:53,370
You can't smash someone's car because 
you fucking burnt and egg.

2251
01:37:54,290 --> 01:37:59,290
But if you're an actor,
you can get this sense that it's okay 

2252
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:03,261
for you to just smash this fucking car.
Like that kind of makes people go nutty 

2253
01:38:05,310 --> 01:38:07,860
when they get famous.
When things go really well for them.

2254
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,980
We never got famous.
We never went well.

2255
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:14,400
We were on television and it was like 
really hard for people to just enjoy the

2256
01:38:14,401 --> 01:38:17,490
moment of being on television.
Like there was a lot of conversations we

2257
01:38:17,491 --> 01:38:22,491
had on the show.
We're like a balanced perspective was 

2258
01:38:22,491 --> 01:38:25,401
required because they will be like,
I can't believe this show is after 

2259
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:28,761
friends.
This is bullshit that show fucking 

2260
01:38:28,761 --> 01:38:31,011
socks.
And why are they after Seinfeld that 

2261
01:38:31,011 --> 01:38:31,530
show fucking socks and why can't we be 
on Thursday nights?

2262
01:38:31,531 --> 01:38:32,820
And you know,
God,

2263
01:38:32,821 --> 01:38:34,590
this is so frustrating.
And you know,

2264
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,060
I remember we were having this 
conversation.

2265
01:38:36,061 --> 01:38:41,061
I was like,
well last time I checked we're on 

2266
01:38:41,061 --> 01:38:41,061
fucking TV.
We have a TV show,

2267
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,540
you know,
and it's still in the year.

2268
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:44,970
We're in like season three.
Like this is crazy.

2269
01:38:44,990 --> 01:38:49,990
Well,
there's probably no perspective at the 

2270
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:49,990
time that you guys were getting to work 
with Phil Hartman.

2271
01:38:49,990 --> 01:38:51,230
Who is.
It was like a blessing.

2272
01:38:51,260 --> 01:38:53,690
It was definitely a perspective in that 
that,

2273
01:38:53,691 --> 01:38:54,860
you know,
we definitely,

2274
01:38:54,861 --> 01:38:59,060
I definitely recognize Phil and Dave 
Foley equally important.

2275
01:38:59,061 --> 01:39:01,280
Dave Foley was the glue that kept that 
whole.

2276
01:39:01,281 --> 01:39:01,790
He was like,
what?

2277
01:39:01,791 --> 01:39:05,030
I see that guy slot producer.
I see that guy running that Kyle,

2278
01:39:05,120 --> 01:39:08,650
you run into him a wink,
what?

2279
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:14,320
Our kids go to the same school,
but I always want to stop them and I 

2280
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:14,320
always want to stop him and say like,
it's.

2281
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:15,980
I'm never good at meeting celebrities.
So I was like,

2282
01:39:15,981 --> 01:39:17,420
sweetie,
I want to go like,

2283
01:39:17,421 --> 01:39:18,980
hey,
I know Joe Rogan and,

2284
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:20,600
but,
and are just do it.

2285
01:39:20,601 --> 01:39:22,400
I know you have a great conversation 
with them.

2286
01:39:22,401 --> 01:39:23,210
Trust me.
He's a,

2287
01:39:23,211 --> 01:39:25,430
he's a sweetheart of a guy or he'd be 
creeped out.

2288
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:27,350
Like I have creeped out a lot of 
celebrities before.

2289
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:31,460
I think he would deal with it.
He's very intelligent.

2290
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:34,280
No,
maybe I'll start to say how good dude,

2291
01:39:34,281 --> 01:39:36,230
man,
he's a really good dude and he struggled

2292
01:39:36,231 --> 01:39:39,890
with that fucking demon in a bottle to 
you saying,

2293
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:40,940
I didn't mean to interrupt you.
I'm sorry.

2294
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,680
Do you remember who you were saying 
that?

2295
01:39:42,681 --> 01:39:47,681
Uh,
I said Phil Hartman is so talented and 

2296
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:49,930
he was taken away so quick that you 
didn't know you were getting to work 

2297
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:51,920
with like a fuck a guy that's a legend 
at the end of his life.

2298
01:39:51,921 --> 01:39:56,921
We didn't,
we certainly didn't know it was the end 

2299
01:39:56,921 --> 01:39:58,391
of his life,
but we definitely knew he was something 

2300
01:39:58,391 --> 01:39:58,391
special.
You know,

2301
01:39:58,391 --> 01:39:58,391
he,
every time we went anywhere,

2302
01:39:58,391 --> 01:40:01,580
like that's where the people,
they didn't want her to talk to Phil,

2303
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:03,920
like very rarely anybody wanted to talk 
to me.

2304
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,560
Like if they did interviews and stuff 
like that,

2305
01:40:06,570 --> 01:40:08,450
I may occasionally people want her to 
talk to me,

2306
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:11,000
but most of the time it was,
they wanted to talk to Phil.

2307
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:14,180
It was Phil fucking Hartman.
He was always doing big movies,

2308
01:40:14,340 --> 01:40:19,340
you know,
like he had that Sergeant Bilko movie 

2309
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:21,641
that turn out to be like a bomb that 
while we're all together and he did 

2310
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:21,641
another couple of movies while we're all
together.

2311
01:40:21,641 --> 01:40:24,230
He was always,
he was always kicking ass.

2312
01:40:24,231 --> 01:40:26,080
He was always doing.
Was He in Beethoven?

2313
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:29,420
I think he was the dad in Beethoven.
I like the third house.

2314
01:40:29,421 --> 01:40:31,510
I think it was in the third one.
Really.

2315
01:40:31,511 --> 01:40:33,770
There's those Groden who became a talk 
show host.

2316
01:40:33,771 --> 01:40:38,771
Right.
Charles Grodin was in the first one and 

2317
01:40:38,771 --> 01:40:38,870
I think down the line he got weird.
I think I got weird.

2318
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:41,330
I think he just got implants or 
something.

2319
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:45,320
I think I just saw him with hair really 
well.

2320
01:40:45,321 --> 01:40:47,840
He had wigs forever.
Maybe that's how I'm thinking of.

2321
01:40:47,841 --> 01:40:52,841
He might have.
He might have done it all up and then 

2322
01:40:52,841 --> 01:40:52,841
release the hounds.
He seemed like an interesting guy.

2323
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:58,170
He seemed like an interesting guy when 
he's a comic and I think you'd fall off 

2324
01:40:58,170 --> 01:41:00,391
the deep end.
Dudes get older and they just get tired 

2325
01:41:00,391 --> 01:41:04,111
of it too.
The guy was around the 70s by the time 

2326
01:41:04,111 --> 01:41:05,150
you know the year 2015 rolls around.
He's probably like,

2327
01:41:05,151 --> 01:41:06,520
I'm done.
Yeah.

2328
01:41:06,710 --> 01:41:07,780
You know,
it's not going to be me.

2329
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:09,230
It's not.
No.

2330
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,460
What are you going to do?
Joan Rivers it burn out.

2331
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:13,420
No,
I was thinking.

2332
01:41:13,421 --> 01:41:15,790
I don't think he died.
I've been thinking about this lately.

2333
01:41:15,791 --> 01:41:18,110
I don't think you'd die.
You don't think you die?

2334
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,980
I don't think you're done.
Good luck with that idea.

2335
01:41:21,310 --> 01:41:26,310
You probe it theoretically.

2336
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:29,430
I guess it just ends up.
I just feel like there's.

2337
01:41:29,440 --> 01:41:32,650
I don't feel like you keep keep going 
into new parallel universes.

2338
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:37,510
It's just as possible.
The idea of could have done a lot.

2339
01:41:37,570 --> 01:41:39,100
You buy half,
you know,

2340
01:41:39,101 --> 01:41:39,530
and like,
yeah,

2341
01:41:39,531 --> 01:41:42,280
I might have died a million people die 
around you.

2342
01:41:42,281 --> 01:41:43,390
What?
What's that about?

2343
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:48,990
I think that's part of my university,
but it's not part of theirs and my own 

2344
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:52,741
parallel universe.
They die and that is for my journey for 

2345
01:41:52,741 --> 01:41:52,860
them to die.
I remember last year,

2346
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:54,670
dude,
we lost a bunch of guys.

2347
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:57,190
I've lost a ton of friends from suicide,
but.

2348
01:41:57,191 --> 01:41:59,650
Oh well hold on.
Let's not even get into it.

2349
01:42:00,280 --> 01:42:02,680
We lost like foreign college and our 
fraternity.

2350
01:42:04,030 --> 01:42:06,160
Yeah.
Three and three.

2351
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:08,860
Your friends in high school committed 
suicide?

2352
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:13,920
Yeah.
Fuck yeah,

2353
01:42:13,960 --> 01:42:15,130
we lost it.
We lost somebody in our,

2354
01:42:15,190 --> 01:42:16,850
in our fraternity that at one point,
oh,

2355
01:42:16,860 --> 01:42:17,560
the therapist came in.

2356
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:22,560
It's like you guys may not be being good
friends to each other because you guys 

2357
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,490
are killing each other.
Like it was like one or two year span,

2358
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:29,710
the therapist blamed this on a therapist
to talk about,

2359
01:42:30,120 --> 01:42:32,170
to explain loss.
So at a certain point,

2360
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:37,470
I feel like the second suicide,
I think by two years for suicides,

2361
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:38,980
two years,
three years maybe.

2362
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:41,350
Yeah.
So more than one a year.

2363
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:44,770
We had one in the spring and one in the 
summer.

2364
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:46,870
And then uh,
and then we,

2365
01:42:46,871 --> 01:42:49,300
you know,
and so we brought a therapist in because

2366
01:42:49,301 --> 01:42:50,450
we're like,
all right,

2367
01:42:50,510 --> 01:42:55,510
is there,
is there something going on in this 

2368
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:55,510
room?
We're all killing ourselves.

2369
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:58,640
Did a lot sexier than just a bunch of 
fucking homophobic.

2370
01:43:00,041 --> 01:43:02,570
Dick's alcoholics,
homophobic,

2371
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:05,100
racist,
depression.

2372
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,720
And then we blow their brains out.
Drug problems.

2373
01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:10,300
Had no barriers.
How are these guys?

2374
01:43:10,340 --> 01:43:11,980
Iceland themselves?
Um,

2375
01:43:12,040 --> 01:43:15,220
but two guns,
one drugs when hanging.

2376
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:18,580
There was a dude who was one of the 
writers on news radio was a good friend.

2377
01:43:18,610 --> 01:43:21,010
He's a really good guy.
I really enjoyed talking to him.

2378
01:43:21,011 --> 01:43:23,500
He was a comic before the news radio 
days.

2379
01:43:23,501 --> 01:43:24,550
His name is drake.
Say either.

2380
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:27,400
It was a funny comic he'd been on and I 
know that name.

2381
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:30,370
He was a writer on news radio and he 
wrote this thing,

2382
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:35,350
if you ever see that video of me is like
the vh one fashion awards from 1997.

2383
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:40,351
I played this crazy photographer that 
didn't know anything about photography 

2384
01:43:40,351 --> 01:43:42,290
photography to get laid.
He show your bike.

2385
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:48,050
I was naked.
I was naked in front of this model like 

2386
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:48,050
a I.
The question was,

2387
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:48,640
I say,
uh,

2388
01:43:48,700 --> 01:43:51,070
do you have any problem with,
am I going over her portfolio?

2389
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,040
I'm like,
you're very beautiful.

2390
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:53,960
This is excellent stuff.
Do you have any with.

2391
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:54,830
She goes,
no,

2392
01:43:55,010 --> 01:43:55,790
no,
I don't.

2393
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:57,580
Next picture is me naked

2394
01:43:57,850 --> 01:44:02,690
taking a picture of something fatality 
that fashion for these testimonies.

2395
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:08,220
It was so funny.
It was written by drink.

2396
01:44:08,260 --> 01:44:08,520
Yeah.

2397
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:10,620
And dre kill himself.
And um,

2398
01:44:10,690 --> 01:44:12,520
Lucy at Texas comic.
Um,

2399
01:44:12,521 --> 01:44:13,750
he was a Boston comic.
Well,

2400
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:15,610
I don't know where he started,
but he,

2401
01:44:15,611 --> 01:44:19,540
I met him in Boston way back in the day.
Um,

2402
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:22,240
he might've been from Texas originally,
but he was,

2403
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:25,900
he started when I was in 1988 when I was
starting out.

2404
01:44:25,901 --> 01:44:30,901
He was in Boston.
He was doing stand up there and he was 

2405
01:44:30,901 --> 01:44:33,000
more established than me.
He was like a couple of years ahead of 

2406
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,311
me and uh,
somewhere along the line he stopped 

2407
01:44:35,311 --> 01:44:35,710
doing stand up and he had a family and 
the whole deal.

2408
01:44:35,711 --> 01:44:37,390
And one day I don't know what happened,
man,

2409
01:44:37,391 --> 01:44:40,510
some breakup and I don't know,
I don't know what happened,

2410
01:44:40,511 --> 01:44:42,970
but he killed himself while he was on 
the phone apparently.

2411
01:44:42,971 --> 01:44:47,971
But this wife and I that fuck me up and 
that one fuck me up.

2412
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:51,100
That was hard to take because I had been
over their house.

2413
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:54,750
They had a party and I cut to meet 
everybody and it was fun.

2414
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:59,760
It was Harland Williams was there,
so I associated that party and being 

2415
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,961
over their houses like this is fun 
friendly time and just to think that 

2416
01:45:03,961 --> 01:45:07,591
that guy could go from that moment where
we're drinking wine and everyone's 

2417
01:45:07,591 --> 01:45:11,130
laughing and you know,
it's having good times and good friends 

2418
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:13,010
and then so dark that he wants to end 
it.

2419
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:16,250
So,
so fucking funny too man.

2420
01:45:16,251 --> 01:45:20,470
Such a good writer.
Such a clever guy that this guy could be

2421
01:45:20,471 --> 01:45:24,490
so haunted that the lows were too low,
that he was like,

2422
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,650
I can't do this.
I can't,

2423
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:29,590
I can't cope with this frequency.
And he just,

2424
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:30,460
boom.

2425
01:45:31,170 --> 01:45:33,380
Ari was the almost there,
you know,

2426
01:45:33,381 --> 01:45:34,940
a few years ago,
you know,

2427
01:45:34,941 --> 01:45:39,941
and now it's,
I was talking to him about this the 

2428
01:45:39,941 --> 01:45:39,980
other day,
how he's changed.

2429
01:45:39,981 --> 01:45:44,981
So he has a billboard in front of his 
old apartment now of his own face

2430
01:45:46,190 --> 01:45:48,320
podcasts about it,
but already was,

2431
01:45:48,321 --> 01:45:49,130
yeah,
he was very,

2432
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:50,660
very down,
very down.

2433
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:54,320
And uh,
a lot of it was like physical.

2434
01:45:54,380 --> 01:45:59,380
A lot of it was career related.
He thinks a lot of it might have had to 

2435
01:45:59,380 --> 01:46:01,130
do with him taking propecia some and 
some people,

2436
01:46:01,131 --> 01:46:04,580
propecia causes depression because dee 
propecia,

2437
01:46:05,180 --> 01:46:08,620
the way,
if you read the literature on how it,

2438
01:46:08,621 --> 01:46:11,870
what does it inhibits?
Dihydrotestosterone,

2439
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:13,040
which is d,
h d,

2440
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:13,940
which is,
you know,

2441
01:46:13,941 --> 01:46:16,460
just essential part of being a human 
being.

2442
01:46:16,790 --> 01:46:19,670
But that dht is what causes your hair to
fall out.

2443
01:46:20,150 --> 01:46:22,970
And it affects people in different ways.
Some people,

2444
01:46:22,971 --> 01:46:25,460
it kills their boners me killed my 
boilers.

2445
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:28,190
And uh,
I didn't realize until I got off of it,

2446
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:31,550
I ran out of it and also my Dick was 
hard as a rock.

2447
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:36,551
I was like,
what is going on to help tear your hair 

2448
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:36,551
though?
Yes,

2449
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:36,551
yes.
It keeps your hair.

2450
01:46:36,551 --> 01:46:41,180
And as soon as I got off of it and as 
soon as I got off Rogaine to decided to 

2451
01:46:41,180 --> 01:46:44,681
shave my head,
I bailed on everything because I was 

2452
01:46:44,681 --> 01:46:44,681
losing the battle anyway.
And I was like,

2453
01:46:44,681 --> 01:46:48,311
I am going to have to abandon this 
fucking dam and run from the river 

2454
01:46:48,311 --> 01:46:49,040
because like,
I can't hold it back anymore like this,

2455
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:49,980
a bit of Rogaine for like

2456
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:54,650
fucking 22 years.
It holds onto your hands onto your head.

2457
01:46:54,651 --> 01:46:59,651
But as soon as you get off of that shit 
folk who have like fire through bushes 

2458
01:46:59,651 --> 01:47:01,340
baby.
Like if I grew my hair out now like,

2459
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:02,070
oh my God,
dude,

2460
01:47:02,071 --> 01:47:03,480
your bullets.
Fuck.

2461
01:47:03,560 --> 01:47:08,560
Like for three years I've been shaved my
head and I had the exact same hair loss 

2462
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:10,830
when I met you.
You both use the sprinkle stuff and the,

2463
01:47:10,831 --> 01:47:11,880
um,
the uh,

2464
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:14,130
propecia and the,
um,

2465
01:47:14,131 --> 01:47:15,210
what's the other stuff?
Oh,

2466
01:47:15,211 --> 01:47:17,760
I found this stuff that you get online 
that was this,

2467
01:47:17,761 --> 01:47:20,610
um,
this a pump that was,

2468
01:47:20,970 --> 01:47:25,970
it was like as lead acid and retin a and
minoxidil and this company had the shit.

2469
01:47:27,871 --> 01:47:32,871
This was the shit stuff kept your hair,
but for whatever reason it wasn't 

2470
01:47:32,941 --> 01:47:37,941
approved by the FDA.
So the FDA came along and they shut them

2471
01:47:38,251 --> 01:47:43,251
down.
But like I knew a bunch of dudes that 

2472
01:47:43,251 --> 01:47:43,251
were taking this stuff.

2473
01:47:43,251 --> 01:47:43,980
It had retina and it would make your 
hair red,

2474
01:47:44,340 --> 01:47:46,770
like your scalp read if you spray too 
much of it in.

2475
01:47:46,771 --> 01:47:50,850
But the effect was pretty dramatic.
Like it really kept all of your hair and

2476
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:55,880
when that stuff went away I took a hit.
When I got off probation I took a big 

2477
01:47:56,980 --> 01:48:01,980
hit.
You could see like if you watch like 

2478
01:48:01,980 --> 01:48:04,550
episodes of the UFC,
you could see like we started seeing 

2479
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:05,790
hair like light through my hair.
It's like it's going baby.

2480
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
And then finally I had to let it go,
but I should've let it go a long time 

2481
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:11,000
ago.
I love having a shaved head.

2482
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:12,720
It's foolish.
You could do it right now.

2483
01:48:12,721 --> 01:48:13,440
So hold on,
Joe.

2484
01:48:13,450 --> 01:48:13,720
Hope,
fuck,

2485
01:48:13,721 --> 01:48:14,730
I'll help you.
I'll tell you what.

2486
01:48:14,731 --> 01:48:18,420
I'll do anyone tennis to Rogaine.
I will do $1 million commercial.

2487
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:22,890
Like let me give you $1 million to keep 
my head for a million.

2488
01:48:22,890 --> 01:48:24,270
Like you're holding them hostage.
No,

2489
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:26,640
I'll do the opposite.
Is that old time lapse?

2490
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:30,000
Stop using Rogaine and just watch my 
hair fall out.

2491
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:35,860
And then you said all these young kids 
who you want to keep your hair get on 

2492
01:48:35,860 --> 01:48:39,081
this shit right now because I'm 42.
I should arguably be bald as fuck right 

2493
01:48:39,301 --> 01:48:44,301
now.
I've been holding on his hair just with 

2494
01:48:44,301 --> 01:48:44,520
the Rogaine my entire.
Since I was 22 I said this weekend,

2495
01:48:44,521 --> 01:48:49,521
tell me if you agree with this,
but it's a little bit of a stretch with 

2496
01:48:49,521 --> 01:48:52,251
thought.
Men who lose their hair at a young age 

2497
01:48:52,251 --> 01:48:54,020
that you start losing your hair.
That is the first record.

2498
01:48:54,250 --> 01:48:56,760
The first signpost for mortality in a 
person.

2499
01:48:57,120 --> 01:49:00,540
Like you witnessed your mortality at a 
young age when you realize,

2500
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:02,100
fuck,
I'm actually losing my hair.

2501
01:49:02,780 --> 01:49:03,720
See?
Mortality.

2502
01:49:03,721 --> 01:49:07,660
To me it seemed more like,
like you couldn't control something like

2503
01:49:07,670 --> 01:49:12,670
[inaudible],
like going away from you and it's 

2504
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:12,670
something that makes you look better.

2505
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:12,900
It was really confusing for a lot of 
men.

2506
01:49:12,901 --> 01:49:15,450
It's very confusing and it freaked me 
out.

2507
01:49:15,451 --> 01:49:17,490
Bad.
It was just shave your head.

2508
01:49:17,570 --> 01:49:22,570
That's the beautiful thing about it.
Like the solution of shaving your head 

2509
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:22,570
is always there and once you do it you 
go,

2510
01:49:22,570 --> 01:49:23,970
Oh yeah,
why am I.

2511
01:49:23,971 --> 01:49:28,971
What am I going to here for?
I may shave it and then stay on Rogaine 

2512
01:49:28,971 --> 01:49:33,101
or wish I shaved it when I was in my 
twenties instead of going through hair 

2513
01:49:33,101 --> 01:49:33,101
transplants,
all that stupid shit.

2514
01:49:33,180 --> 01:49:36,420
I have just shaved it.
Definitely do that again.

2515
01:49:36,421 --> 01:49:37,530
IfW ,
if I went back,

2516
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:39,330
I would definitely do that differently.
No.

2517
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:41,760
If they said that there was a pill that 
could grow a full,

2518
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,450
a full 18 year old head of hair for you.
I don't want any more here.

2519
01:49:45,451 --> 01:49:46,710
I'm good.
Yeah.

2520
01:49:46,711 --> 01:49:48,100
Like now I will.
The fuck

2521
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:49,630
knows what else that pill's going to do 
to you.

2522
01:49:49,990 --> 01:49:52,720
Like if I just shaved my head,
I'm a fairly happy with it.

2523
01:49:52,721 --> 01:49:55,750
Look,
I could be born in Ethiopia,

2524
01:49:55,990 --> 01:49:58,050
you know,
I could have been an Eskimo.

2525
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:58,770
Not there's anything wrong.

2526
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:04,580
All due respect.
I really think you're supposed to say 

2527
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:10,260
this shit out in an Igloo.
Some guy trying to get a walrus.

2528
01:50:13,351 --> 01:50:18,351
Vagina fence.
PILBARA had red hair.

2529
01:50:19,940 --> 01:50:21,940
There's a lot of things it could've been
way worse,

2530
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:24,710
but like kind of deal with the hand 
you've been given.

2531
01:50:24,740 --> 01:50:28,280
You ain't going to change it and take 
that hand and fucking run with it man.

2532
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:30,740
And sometimes the hand looks just 
devastating.

2533
01:50:30,741 --> 01:50:33,950
Sometimes you got to fucking tools and 
you're like,

2534
01:50:33,951 --> 01:50:34,900
this is it.
You've got A.

2535
01:50:34,910 --> 01:50:37,190
I got a two and a three.
Fuck,

2536
01:50:37,310 --> 01:50:39,440
this is nothing.
His hands dog shit.

2537
01:50:39,800 --> 01:50:42,020
And then you're going down the street to
the guy who was a soap opera.

2538
01:50:42,021 --> 01:50:43,940
Fabio looking motherfucker with the long
hair.

2539
01:50:43,941 --> 01:50:48,830
Like this guy's got all the fucking car 
cut 52 deck card.

2540
01:50:48,831 --> 01:50:51,410
I got two cards is amazing.
I use that.

2541
01:50:51,411 --> 01:50:52,700
And people sometimes you go,
God,

2542
01:50:52,701 --> 01:50:54,800
that guy's got fucking everything.
I realized I got fucking nothing.

2543
01:50:55,280 --> 01:50:57,350
Well that's not true though.
You know,

2544
01:50:57,351 --> 01:50:59,420
it's like the thing about human beings,
it's like,

2545
01:50:59,421 --> 01:50:59,840
what?

2546
01:50:59,900 --> 01:51:01,250
What?
What are you?

2547
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:05,420
You're not just how you look.
The problem is with a lot of people,

2548
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:09,110
you gauge how you look based on how 
sexually desirable you are.

2549
01:51:09,560 --> 01:51:14,560
That's the real issue with people.
You see it with a lot of people as they 

2550
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,711
get older,
they start freaking out and there's 

2551
01:51:17,711 --> 01:51:18,440
fucking photos of Mickey rourke now make
your work much at the UFC this weekend.

2552
01:51:18,441 --> 01:51:21,000
It's like somebody talked to that guy.
He's.

2553
01:51:21,020 --> 01:51:24,710
He's got fake hair and fake lips in his 
face.

2554
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:26,480
Something's going on with his face and 
it's like,

2555
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:28,490
God,
give him a hug.

2556
01:51:28,491 --> 01:51:31,100
You know he's fucking Mickey Rourke.
Does he know he's Mickey Rourke?

2557
01:51:31,130 --> 01:51:35,240
Does he think it looks amazing?
I was mad at this.

2558
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,920
I would love to drink with Mickey 
Rourke.

2559
01:51:37,470 --> 01:51:41,770
She's just crying.
Nothing about old boxing stories for the

2560
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:44,210
first.
First of our two,

2561
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:47,210
he's fighting fake boxing matches.
You see he called.

2562
01:51:47,230 --> 01:51:49,260
He's 62 years old.
He thought some kind of boxing.

2563
01:51:49,261 --> 01:51:52,040
I just think it's total dive.
The guy never punched him in the face.

2564
01:51:52,041 --> 01:51:57,041
Once he hit the guy with a weak punch,
that body and the guy went down like he 

2565
01:51:57,041 --> 01:51:57,260
was like,
someone stole his liver.

2566
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:59,900
It was ridiculous.
It was so dumb.

2567
01:52:00,170 --> 01:52:05,170
It's so pathetic like you look,
this is the guy from nine and a half 

2568
01:52:05,170 --> 01:52:05,170
weeks.
This is the guy from angel heart.

2569
01:52:05,180 --> 01:52:07,520
This is Mickey motherfucking rourke.
Every designer.

2570
01:52:07,521 --> 01:52:12,521
Is there anything about you that you 
don't like that you'd like to change 

2571
01:52:12,521 --> 01:52:12,521
now,
but for bonds,

2572
01:52:12,521 --> 01:52:16,570
man,
you deal with all the prospective deal 

2573
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:17,090
with the perspective of who you are in 
comparison to who you could've been born

2574
01:52:17,091 --> 01:52:21,890
in Ethiopia with no feet.
Your renewals to off the top of them are

2575
01:52:21,930 --> 01:52:26,930
new.
The corn weird right here was just 

2576
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:26,930
smooth that out to be good.

2577
01:52:26,930 --> 01:52:30,460
You're not going to be good.
You can start tweaking it by other 

2578
01:52:30,460 --> 01:52:32,411
things.
There's people that get their shins 

2579
01:52:32,411 --> 01:52:34,250
broken and separated slowly with these 
devices that make them inches taller.

2580
01:52:34,790 --> 01:52:36,380
In China,
it's a big deal.

2581
01:52:36,500 --> 01:52:39,380
There's a lot of guys in China that they
feel like they can't get a woman because

2582
01:52:39,381 --> 01:52:44,381
they're below five feet tall and so 
there is slowly but surely stretching 

2583
01:52:44,381 --> 01:52:48,461
the fucking bones of their legs have 
these bolts that are attached to their 

2584
01:52:48,461 --> 01:52:51,110
bone and they crank it and they slowly 
separate.

2585
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:56,111
They saw it and then they slowly 
separated so it grows a little bit and 

2586
01:52:56,111 --> 01:53:00,281
then they separate it more and it grows 
a little bit and they separate it more 

2587
01:53:00,281 --> 01:53:01,820
and the bone keeps filling in this 
fucking madness.

2588
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:05,120
The mechanics of your body are all out 
of whack because you've got a seven foot

2589
01:53:05,121 --> 01:53:07,910
long shinbone like the whole thing is 
madness.

2590
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:11,960
People are crazy.
I think health and well being is good.

2591
01:53:11,961 --> 01:53:15,770
Maintaining vitality is good,
but he got also have perspective.

2592
01:53:15,771 --> 01:53:20,771
Perspective is big and sometimes people 
they just get mad because they don't 

2593
01:53:20,771 --> 01:53:23,630
look like Lorenzo Lamas in his prime.
They get mad because they're boring.

2594
01:53:23,930 --> 01:53:25,040
You know,
fill in the blank.

2595
01:53:25,041 --> 01:53:28,970
I wish I was Filipino and I'm tired.
We show was black and I'm Asian.

2596
01:53:28,971 --> 01:53:31,550
I wish I was Asian and I'm fucking 
Portuguese.

2597
01:53:31,790 --> 01:53:34,310
People have weird things in their head 
where they they,

2598
01:53:34,540 --> 01:53:39,540
they want to be something other than 
what they are and right now that's 

2599
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:39,540
unavailable.
So you're,

2600
01:53:39,540 --> 01:53:42,920
you're losing resources in your 90 
whatever the fuck it is.

2601
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:46,310
Your ride on this globe.
You have a 90 year ride,

2602
01:53:46,311 --> 01:53:49,790
allegedly also the crusher.
We just die and don't.

2603
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:51,890
You keep going and everybody else thinks
you're dead,

2604
01:53:51,891 --> 01:53:53,420
but you're on another plane of 
existence,

2605
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:58,540
which is possible to get together and 
write a book.

2606
01:53:59,271 --> 01:54:01,160
That'd be awesome.
That'd be fucking working.

2607
01:54:01,330 --> 01:54:02,170
We're team white.
Gold,

2608
01:54:02,171 --> 01:54:04,570
right?
What does that mean to you?

2609
01:54:05,220 --> 01:54:08,320
Awesome article about you.
Is that what you're talking about?

2610
01:54:08,321 --> 01:54:11,140
No,
I'm talking about the dress that's on an

2611
01:54:11,141 --> 01:54:14,920
article that I haven't make me think 
about you as a about the white city.

2612
01:54:14,950 --> 01:54:19,950
The monkey monkey.
God had just found out and I saw it and 

2613
01:54:19,950 --> 01:54:21,640
I thought I saw the thing and it looks 
like your shirt at yours.

2614
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:23,320
So I tweeted it.
That's uh,

2615
01:54:23,321 --> 01:54:24,040
that's crazy.
Crazy

2616
01:54:24,070 --> 01:54:29,070
man.
They found this hidden city in Honduras 

2617
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:33,060
that was legendary up until recently,
and they haven't even disclosed its 

2618
01:54:33,060 --> 01:54:36,631
origin,
but they brought back artifacts like 

2619
01:54:36,631 --> 01:54:38,341
this motherfucker's real like we've 
found a hidden city in Honduras from a 

2620
01:54:38,741 --> 01:54:42,280
long time ago where it's gone.
There's nothing but relics and shit.

2621
01:54:43,530 --> 01:54:47,280
I just think that's so fucking cool.
It's so cool that they.

2622
01:54:47,390 --> 01:54:49,750
They keep finding shit like that in the 
Amazon too.

2623
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,040
They have these satellite images and 
they go away.

2624
01:54:52,041 --> 01:54:53,950
What is that?
Look at this shape of this.

2625
01:54:53,951 --> 01:54:56,020
This is symmetrical.
Then they realize like,

2626
01:54:56,021 --> 01:54:57,190
oh my God,
it's a canal system.

2627
01:54:57,191 --> 01:54:58,500
Oh my God,
this is a fake.

2628
01:54:58,810 --> 01:55:01,000
So fucking city.
They got swallowed by the jungle.

2629
01:55:01,640 --> 01:55:06,640
They have hills that they thought it was
just a hill and they realize it's a 

2630
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:09,631
building.
Like there's some structure underneath 

2631
01:55:09,631 --> 01:55:11,821
this hill and the.
The dirt literally grew over it and 

2632
01:55:11,821 --> 01:55:11,821
trees grew on the dirt.

2633
01:55:11,821 --> 01:55:14,330
So there's this mound in the middle of 
nowhere and you walk up to it.

2634
01:55:14,331 --> 01:55:15,250
You're like,
what's going on here?

2635
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:17,200
And archeologists start digging.
Then they go,

2636
01:55:17,201 --> 01:55:18,970
oh,
this is a fucking building man.

2637
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:21,960
Like Shit.
Well,

2638
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,710
there's,
there's a type of,

2639
01:55:23,860 --> 01:55:28,860
I think it's called a total tax that 
they don't even exactly know what they 

2640
01:55:28,860 --> 01:55:29,800
looked like.
They don't know where they came from.

2641
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,920
They had very African looking faces and 
they live something thousands and 

2642
01:55:35,710 --> 01:55:39,340
thousands of years ago down in Mexico 
and South America and like were like,

2643
01:55:39,341 --> 01:55:44,341
okay,
who the fuck are these people like they 

2644
01:55:44,341 --> 01:55:44,341
don't know.
They have giant heads.

2645
01:55:44,341 --> 01:55:46,500
Have you ever seen those toll tag cans?
Jamie?

2646
01:55:46,501 --> 01:55:48,750
Pull up an image of one of the toll tech
heads.

2647
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,960
They find these enormous blocks of stone
that are cut out to the shape of these.

2648
01:55:54,390 --> 01:55:59,390
These African faces heads.
Real weird man.

2649
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:02,610
There's one over there.
I think there's no one over there.

2650
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:10,270
They don't exist in the world of the 
travel channel.

2651
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:16,200
Jesus lems one other kind of heads.
TOLTEC head.

2652
01:56:18,150 --> 01:56:20,310
Look at that.
That's an African looking face,

2653
01:56:20,311 --> 01:56:22,610
man.
You're talking about the Easter island.

2654
01:56:22,650 --> 01:56:24,240
Okay.
That's a different place.

2655
01:56:25,050 --> 01:56:27,000
This is in Central America,
man.

2656
01:56:27,001 --> 01:56:30,360
They find these fucking things like 600 
tons or something crazy.

2657
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:32,000
How big are those fuckers,
Jamie?

2658
01:56:32,310 --> 01:56:35,070
Google how big those heads are,
but I might have made up that weight,

2659
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:41,630
but look what they look like.
They're fucking cool as shit that looks 

2660
01:56:41,630 --> 01:56:41,700
like an African.
The Lips.

2661
01:56:41,940 --> 01:56:43,620
Yeah.
Some of them are tossed over.

2662
01:56:43,621 --> 01:56:44,670
Some of them are.
Uh,

2663
01:56:45,900 --> 01:56:47,090
some of them are.
Um,

2664
01:56:47,790 --> 01:56:49,950
they're all different sizes and shapes.

2665
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:51,990
Joe,
you never,

2666
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:57,000
I saw you tweet you.
You just didn't even get into the whole 

2667
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:57,850
dress thing that happened the other day.
The way cold blue,

2668
01:56:57,851 --> 01:57:00,090
black thing.
Don't give a fuck about dresses.

2669
01:57:00,130 --> 01:57:00,420
No,
no,

2670
01:57:00,430 --> 01:57:03,490
no.
But do you understand what happened?

2671
01:57:03,491 --> 01:57:04,600
Course.
It's grown,

2672
01:57:04,601 --> 01:57:05,830
man.
Don't you think that's interesting?

2673
01:57:05,831 --> 01:57:08,020
We could both look at the same picture 
and see two different colors,

2674
01:57:08,120 --> 01:57:13,120
but why is that a explained as the run?
Supposedly it's the cones and people's 

2675
01:57:13,361 --> 01:57:14,120
eyes.
Like my,

2676
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:19,150
my eyes are more open circles.
That's what the eye doctor used to 

2677
01:57:19,150 --> 01:57:19,180
always tell me.
He was like,

2678
01:57:19,181 --> 01:57:24,181
you have more of an eye was going by,
but it's,

2679
01:57:25,270 --> 01:57:30,270
I guess how the shape of your cones and 
how you get light,

2680
01:57:30,570 --> 01:57:31,230
but how come it looks?

2681
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:35,480
It's different to different people.
Like sometimes it looks different to the

2682
01:57:35,481 --> 01:57:37,430
same person,
you'll get one image,

2683
01:57:38,150 --> 01:57:40,750
golden cross blue,
mine will look like white and gold,

2684
01:57:40,751 --> 01:57:42,610
and then like an hour later I look at it
and be like,

2685
01:57:42,670 --> 01:57:44,620
it's a completely different picture and 
I would freak out.

2686
01:57:44,621 --> 01:57:49,621
I'm like,
where's the picture I was just looking 

2687
01:57:49,621 --> 01:57:49,621
at?
And then,

2688
01:57:49,621 --> 01:57:51,601
uh,
so I can switch back and forth where I 

2689
01:57:51,601 --> 01:57:52,300
know people that can't switch or people 
that only see blue and black,

2690
01:57:52,301 --> 01:57:52,780
white or gold.

2691
01:57:53,030 --> 01:57:58,030
No,
that's nothing compared to what Phil 

2692
01:57:58,030 --> 01:57:58,030
plait made for slate.
Um,

2693
01:57:58,040 --> 01:58:02,020
pull up a phil plait.
Slate magazine.

2694
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,490
Um,
slate online.

2695
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:07,880
I'm a color.
What would you say?

2696
01:58:07,940 --> 01:58:09,800
Color confusion.
What would you say?

2697
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:13,940
Color illusion.
Optical illusion.

2698
01:58:13,941 --> 01:58:14,810
Color.
Optical.

2699
01:58:14,811 --> 01:58:16,580
Illusion.
That's what you also pull up the dress.

2700
01:58:16,670 --> 01:58:17,750
Look at this.
Look at this one.

2701
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:21,050
This is way crazier.
You see those blues and those Greens?

2702
01:58:21,380 --> 01:58:23,660
That's the same color.
The exact same color.

2703
01:58:24,200 --> 01:58:26,360
Yes it is.
When you look at it in photoshop,

2704
01:58:26,361 --> 01:58:28,850
you realize it's the exact same color.
It's the green.

2705
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:29,840
Scroll back,
Jamie,

2706
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:32,270
scroll down.
When you look at it,

2707
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:37,300
the green has the orange go through it.
But the blue doesn't,

2708
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:39,470
the blue,
the orange turns into purple.

2709
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:41,900
That confuses your eyes.
You got closer

2710
01:58:42,030 --> 01:58:47,030
to the exact same color at Jamie.
Do you have the picture of the dress 

2711
01:58:47,030 --> 01:58:47,030
though?
Uh,

2712
01:58:47,030 --> 01:58:48,730
just to see what I want to see what you 
guys actually see on the dress.

2713
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:52,330
You see how it is when you get it close 
up.

2714
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:56,110
That green is across the board.
I mean how trippy is that?

2715
01:58:56,111 --> 01:58:58,860
Burnt Perc can't deal.
And he's freaking out.

2716
01:58:59,780 --> 01:59:02,440
What's weird about the dresses that 
people were saying?

2717
01:59:02,441 --> 01:59:04,870
It's blue and black and I put it into 
photoshop.

2718
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:08,500
I mean I spent like three hours on this.
Me and Asa Akira or going back and forth

2719
01:59:08,501 --> 01:59:13,501
like how we're like,
we're going to start our own communion 

2720
01:59:13,501 --> 01:59:13,750
somewhere and don't trust blue and black
people and stuff.

2721
01:59:14,110 --> 01:59:17,200
But I took it right now I see white and 
gold.

2722
01:59:17,830 --> 01:59:19,640
Whoa.
You guys are both retarded.

2723
01:59:20,690 --> 01:59:23,690
Do you have the dress was blue and black
and blue and black.

2724
01:59:23,691 --> 01:59:24,490
Joe.
That's white and gold.

2725
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,910
You got an issue with your brain,
right?

2726
01:59:26,950 --> 01:59:27,760
Am I right?
Jamie?

2727
01:59:28,360 --> 01:59:29,180
See the two sensible people

2728
01:59:31,350 --> 01:59:32,650
see blue,
black,

2729
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:34,400
blue and black.
Blue.

2730
01:59:34,410 --> 01:59:35,190
And black dress,
you're,

2731
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:40,250
you're refusing to acknowledge that.
Jamie,

2732
01:59:40,251 --> 01:59:41,810
you're completely missing the point 
here.

2733
01:59:42,060 --> 01:59:44,870
The actual dress was blue and black.
I actually have it on my phone.

2734
01:59:44,871 --> 01:59:46,770
This is what you're seeing right now.
This,

2735
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:51,290
this is not what you stumble.
He's getting very.

2736
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:55,430
No,
this is not what I see right now either.

2737
01:59:55,580 --> 01:59:57,960
But this is what they're saying.
This is a,

2738
01:59:58,190 --> 02:00:00,590
the act that was the actual dress that 
they have.

2739
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:02,510
Um,
but th,

2740
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:02,960
th,
th.

2741
02:00:05,810 --> 02:00:07,670
Well it's a light blue,
so very,

2742
02:00:07,671 --> 02:00:12,671
very light blue.
But there's no point in the gold is 

2743
02:00:12,671 --> 02:00:13,370
like,
like the black is like a gold for sure.

2744
02:00:13,440 --> 02:00:13,890
No,
no,

2745
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,060
that does not look black.
No,

2746
02:00:15,070 --> 02:00:17,090
I see white and gold.
I see white and gold right there.

2747
02:00:17,280 --> 02:00:20,120
Well it's not white because if you look 
at the white beside,

2748
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:25,160
the reason why he can make out the 
outline is because beside it is an 

2749
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:25,160
absence of light,
which we think of as white.

2750
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:25,160
No,
no.

2751
02:00:25,160 --> 02:00:26,260
Jump.
But if you look at that,

2752
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:27,520
you would say,
hey,

2753
02:00:27,521 --> 02:00:32,521
that's a white and gold dress.
But in a shadow or something like kind 

2754
02:00:32,521 --> 02:00:32,521
of annoying.

2755
02:00:32,521 --> 02:00:35,590
No,
I would say it's a light blue and a 

2756
02:00:35,590 --> 02:00:36,760
almost like a brownish gold is dark 
gold.

2757
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,990
So you're seeing white and gold.
You're not seeing this.

2758
02:00:38,991 --> 02:00:40,730
Oh No,
I'm seeing light blue.

2759
02:00:40,731 --> 02:00:44,570
I'm seeing blue.
I'm seeing blue and I'm seeing this.

2760
02:00:44,571 --> 02:00:49,340
Gold is like a like a dark gold,
almost like a milestone.

2761
02:00:49,680 --> 02:00:53,130
Mustard.
It's darker than muster.

2762
02:00:53,170 --> 02:00:58,170
It's darker than most of you are 
actually seeing what people are saying 

2763
02:00:58,170 --> 02:00:58,170
as the white and gold.

2764
02:00:58,310 --> 02:00:58,910
No,
but yeah,

2765
02:00:58,911 --> 02:01:03,911
but it's definitely blue sky blue and 
the blues.

2766
02:01:05,691 --> 02:01:06,470
Difficult to discipline,

2767
02:01:06,480 --> 02:01:07,650
right.
You're not seeing this,

2768
02:01:08,250 --> 02:01:13,080
so you actually are seeing what me and 
Bert are seeing in Jamie's saying this.

2769
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:14,960
Is that what you're seeing,
Jamie?

2770
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:18,410
No,
I don't see this is.

2771
02:01:18,680 --> 02:01:23,680
This is a goofy argument because the 
contrast is very different like which 

2772
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:27,191
you're looking at there.
The contrast between that color and the 

2773
02:01:27,191 --> 02:01:30,581
white behind it is very different than 
when you're looking at there that 

2774
02:01:30,581 --> 02:01:34,440
there's.
This is a different image and because 

2775
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:34,440
it's different image shot in different 
light.

2776
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:35,350
You have a different perspective.
No,

2777
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:40,430
no.
What I'm saying is though there's two 

2778
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:40,430
different ways people are seeing it.
You're seeing it,

2779
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:40,430
the white and what they're saying

2780
02:01:40,430 --> 02:01:45,310
is the white and gold,
so hundred percent because I could see 

2781
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:45,310
both gets white.
You know,

2782
02:01:45,310 --> 02:01:45,700
I see both.
I see white and gold right now.

2783
02:01:45,710 --> 02:01:48,710
See anything other than white and blue 
to you?

2784
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:50,330
Not at all.
Not in the slightest.

2785
02:01:50,331 --> 02:01:55,331
No.
Can we cut to the chase and why is it 

2786
02:01:55,331 --> 02:01:57,461
that I see this?
It's because of the how your eye is 

2787
02:01:57,461 --> 02:01:57,920
shaped and the cones and how your eyes 
precipitate colors and stuff like that.

2788
02:01:57,921 --> 02:02:00,500
You will can actually wear whatever 
color.

2789
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:01,870
Yeah,
proceed.

2790
02:02:02,730 --> 02:02:07,730
Received a love Brian.
Super simple change.

2791
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:19,800
It's just how you're pretty much easy 
way as how your eyes take shadows and 

2792
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:20,570
your brain goes,
all right,

2793
02:02:20,630 --> 02:02:22,850
that shadow is purple or blue,
but you can watch.

2794
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,890
If you look at this,
I keep it on my phone.

2795
02:02:24,950 --> 02:02:27,830
If you look at it like once an hour,
it will change throughout the day.

2796
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:31,330
Obviously will see what golden should 
those,

2797
02:02:32,130 --> 02:02:34,010
but here's the thing that makes it more 
important.

2798
02:02:34,011 --> 02:02:37,310
Show is what else are you seeing 
different than that person?

2799
02:02:37,311 --> 02:02:39,920
Like like if I'm looking at a face,
I'm seeing this face,

2800
02:02:39,921 --> 02:02:42,080
that's beautiful and that person's 
seeing a guy,

2801
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:44,450
you know,
like some people are color blind,

2802
02:02:44,451 --> 02:02:45,080
man.
I'll tell you what,

2803
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:47,300
that some people don't see certain 
colors.

2804
02:02:48,210 --> 02:02:48,980
I'll see.
I was.

2805
02:02:48,981 --> 02:02:50,590
I thought you were talking about.
Nevermind.

2806
02:02:50,600 --> 02:02:53,450
I was on the.
I think socially I see things that other

2807
02:02:53,451 --> 02:02:58,451
people don't see it today.
I was jogging in the park next to our 

2808
02:02:58,451 --> 02:03:02,021
house and these two girls cop pulls up,
parks pulls these two girls that are 

2809
02:03:02,091 --> 02:03:07,091
sitting at the young ladies were sitting
on a park bench to interrogate some of 

2810
02:03:07,091 --> 02:03:09,590
the purses,
cuffs to them and I'm watching this.

2811
02:03:09,591 --> 02:03:14,591
I'm jogging around the park cuffs to 
them and put stars to put them in the 

2812
02:03:14,591 --> 02:03:14,591
back of the car,
but as he cuffs them,

2813
02:03:14,591 --> 02:03:14,990
they kind of one in first.

2814
02:03:14,990 --> 02:03:19,990
Then the other next and I saw that the 
two girls clearly in high school,

2815
02:03:20,301 --> 02:03:22,940
I'm going to say 10th grade and 11th 
grade,

2816
02:03:23,550 --> 02:03:28,550
that they weren't crying and I didn't 
see that as how sad I saw that as 

2817
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:33,190
someone needs to step in and fix these 
girls because if they've gotten 

2818
02:03:33,190 --> 02:03:33,590
handcuffed and thrown in the back of the
car and they're not crying,

2819
02:03:33,710 --> 02:03:35,330
then there's something wrong with this 
picture.

2820
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:40,880
There's clearly something wrong.
These girls need a life lesson changed 

2821
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,830
them because you.
If you cuffed me in 10th grade,

2822
02:03:42,980 --> 02:03:47,980
I probably would've started tearing up 
and freaking out and they just come to 

2823
02:03:47,980 --> 02:03:48,140
me and then this guy that was smoking a 
cigarette,

2824
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:53,141
walking his dog and now I'm trying to.
I got my head buds out so I'm trying to 

2825
02:03:53,141 --> 02:03:53,141
hear what the cop saying.
We're walking right by him.

2826
02:03:53,390 --> 02:03:54,650
He said,
how sad,

2827
02:03:55,900 --> 02:03:56,570
how sad I went.

2828
02:03:57,050 --> 02:03:57,650
I was like,
no,

2829
02:03:57,690 --> 02:03:59,180
these,
these little girls have a problem,

2830
02:03:59,181 --> 02:04:01,610
but that's so true in the way you see 
social,

2831
02:04:02,520 --> 02:04:04,770
like social things you'll see 
differently tonight.

2832
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:08,180
I don't know if it has to do with the 
way you're brought up or the things that

2833
02:04:08,181 --> 02:04:10,190
have gone through your life,
but the black and blue dress,

2834
02:04:10,490 --> 02:04:11,450
you know,
here's.

2835
02:04:11,490 --> 02:04:15,260
Here's the interesting way to show that 
we're all looking at the dress the wrong

2836
02:04:15,261 --> 02:04:20,261
way.
If you take the picture of the dress on 

2837
02:04:20,261 --> 02:04:21,260
your laptop,
go into your preferences and invert your

2838
02:04:21,261 --> 02:04:23,990
screens.
What it does is it reverses the colors.

2839
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:27,230
It stays exactly the same.
If you see it white and gold,

2840
02:04:27,350 --> 02:04:32,350
it's not supposed to stay the same.
Obviously it's supposed to change to a 

2841
02:04:32,350 --> 02:04:32,870
different color.
So yeah,

2842
02:04:32,871 --> 02:04:34,370
it's tricky.
It's a trip.

2843
02:04:34,430 --> 02:04:35,360
I made a video.
I,

2844
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:37,320
if you look on my instagram,
where I it,

2845
02:04:37,321 --> 02:04:38,450
where I reversed

2846
02:04:38,460 --> 02:04:41,040
my colors on my computer and it stays 
exactly the same.

2847
02:04:41,041 --> 02:04:43,320
If you go to instagram.com/red
band,

2848
02:04:43,750 --> 02:04:46,080
fascinating job.
You could pull that out.

2849
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:48,030
It's pretty cool.
So truth is a weird thing.

2850
02:04:48,031 --> 02:04:53,031
It's very weird.
We just guessed that we're seeing the 

2851
02:04:53,031 --> 02:04:56,121
same thing,
but there's some dudes that are into 

2852
02:04:56,121 --> 02:04:56,520
like really weird checks,
you know when you go,

2853
02:04:56,580 --> 02:04:58,060
what does that guy saying?
My,

2854
02:04:58,280 --> 02:05:01,050
my,
my overall three on this whole thing now

2855
02:05:01,080 --> 02:05:05,120
is that time travel was created that day
because it,

2856
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:08,920
that day started off the llamas,
the black and white Lama it.

2857
02:05:09,150 --> 02:05:14,150
Do you remember that?
There was a police chase in Arizona and 

2858
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:14,490
it was seriously everybody was talking 
about on twitter,

2859
02:05:14,491 --> 02:05:19,491
every chance TV channels was on tv and 
it was just a police chase of trying to 

2860
02:05:19,491 --> 02:05:22,760
capture a black and white Lama and they 
ended up capturing the,

2861
02:05:23,150 --> 02:05:25,590
the blue,
the white lama or something like that.

2862
02:05:25,620 --> 02:05:27,360
The black line,
but it was like a race thing.

2863
02:05:27,480 --> 02:05:32,480
It's type thing though.
This is officer all when I say check 

2864
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:33,340
this out,
so here's,

2865
02:05:33,390 --> 02:05:35,790
here's the dress now a.
right?

2866
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:38,040
So that's a,
that's not what I'm talking about,

2867
02:05:38,041 --> 02:05:41,100
but this shows a how it changes colors 
if it goes into a shadow.

2868
02:05:41,530 --> 02:05:43,620
A what?
Yeah,

2869
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:45,120
what I,
what I posted.

2870
02:05:45,130 --> 02:05:47,770
That is weird.
I do see that when you pull it back,

2871
02:05:48,170 --> 02:05:53,170
it goes into a shadow.
It changes color because your eyes are 

2872
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:53,170
to now going in,
you know,

2873
02:05:53,170 --> 02:05:57,300
it's the light.
Just change colors.

2874
02:05:57,370 --> 02:05:58,370
Yeah.
Okay.

2875
02:05:58,390 --> 02:06:03,390
That's fine.
Photographer Jamie explained to us and 

2876
02:06:03,390 --> 02:06:04,390
absorb light reflects it,
and this is a,

2877
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:09,640
it's like a yellow shitty lamp,
shitty camera and it's bouncing it off 

2878
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:12,390
and as soon as you move away from it,
the exposure changes,

2879
02:06:12,391 --> 02:06:14,160
the autofocus changes.
Wait,

2880
02:06:14,161 --> 02:06:15,510
Brian,
you went out and bought a dress.

2881
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:20,730
Not a lot of things at play here and 
people are just ignoring facts.

2882
02:06:20,760 --> 02:06:25,760
I think there's A.
There's trolls also playing into this 

2883
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:25,760
white and gold thing.
What are you talking about,

2884
02:06:25,760 --> 02:06:26,100
Jamie?
There's no talk.

2885
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:31,050
Let them talk through it the whole time.
Like for instance,

2886
02:06:31,100 --> 02:06:32,400
uh,
the black and gold right there.

2887
02:06:32,401 --> 02:06:37,401
Watch it fading away.
I'm holding it like light is now on a 

2888
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:37,401
shit.
It's not a shadow.

2889
02:06:37,401 --> 02:06:41,600
By the way.
I don't know why you're showing this 

2890
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:41,600
video because I'm not even talking about
this.

2891
02:06:41,600 --> 02:06:42,870
Video has not been the same dress.
Hold on dude.

2892
02:06:42,871 --> 02:06:45,720
He's explaining what this effect is.
Let them talk.

2893
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:51,620
This is my opinion.
I suppose I would say what is happening 

2894
02:06:51,620 --> 02:06:52,110
here is I know this is a black and gold 
dress,

2895
02:06:52,111 --> 02:06:54,780
or excuse me,
black and blue dress and what I'm seeing

2896
02:06:54,781 --> 02:06:55,350
it.
I'm just,

2897
02:06:55,380 --> 02:06:56,490
I'm going to go ahead and say,
yeah,

2898
02:06:56,491 --> 02:07:01,491
I know that there's also light here 
affecting the way I'm seeing the black 

2899
02:07:01,491 --> 02:07:05,391
and gold or black and blue dress and 
it's making other people see gold and 

2900
02:07:05,391 --> 02:07:07,800
they're just talking about him,
but let him explain.

2901
02:07:07,820 --> 02:07:10,170
Let me explain.
So why is that?

2902
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:13,410
I think it's a difference with people 
saying what they see and what they know.

2903
02:07:13,411 --> 02:07:18,411
They're seeing like an optical illusion.
Like remember the two faces make a vase 

2904
02:07:18,411 --> 02:07:20,340
like ic two faces,
but someone else can see a vase.

2905
02:07:20,490 --> 02:07:23,010
It's just like,
what do you ever seen the blue and black

2906
02:07:23,011 --> 02:07:23,490
love?
Right?

2907
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:26,760
I can see both of them and I also don't 
think it matters.

2908
02:07:26,761 --> 02:07:29,040
This is a,
this is an optical illusion.

2909
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:30,690
Here's,
here's what I'm talking about.

2910
02:07:30,691 --> 02:07:32,430
Here's proof that that we're seeing it 
wrong.

2911
02:07:32,431 --> 02:07:35,140
Okay.
Go to this video where I opened it up in

2912
02:07:35,141 --> 02:07:38,170
photoshop and I invert the colors of the
screen.

2913
02:07:38,171 --> 02:07:43,171
When you invert a color to the opposite,
it should change right around instagram.

2914
02:07:46,410 --> 02:07:48,230
My twitter,
twitter.

2915
02:07:48,440 --> 02:07:50,530
Yeah.
It's fascinating,

2916
02:07:50,531 --> 02:07:50,880
man.
I.

2917
02:07:50,881 --> 02:07:53,110
It's hard for me to believe that that's 
the same thing.

2918
02:07:53,111 --> 02:07:58,111
It's weird as it moves away,
what's confusing is that I understand 

2919
02:07:58,111 --> 02:07:59,770
what moves away and absorbs light to 
reflects light,

2920
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:01,490
but what am I confused?

2921
02:08:01,500 --> 02:08:04,960
What is it when I see that one picture,
you see it differently.

2922
02:08:05,140 --> 02:08:07,600
If we change sides.
Jamie and the lighting was different.

2923
02:08:07,601 --> 02:08:08,950
What?
I see it the same way Joe sees it.

2924
02:08:10,020 --> 02:08:11,860
No,
because you're looking at an image,

2925
02:08:11,861 --> 02:08:13,690
so it's just our cones are shaped 
differently,

2926
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:18,810
so I pick up different amount of light 
that you seen when that thing started 

2927
02:08:18,810 --> 02:08:19,290
out.
Why don't you say I saw that too.

2928
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,820
I see white and gold saw white gold too.
As it pulls away.

2929
02:08:21,821 --> 02:08:23,680
Do you still see what I see?
Blue,

2930
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:28,450
blue and black enough as it pulls 
closure as they do that again,

2931
02:08:28,540 --> 02:08:31,600
now I see what you're talking about when
you go to light blue and brown.

2932
02:08:31,670 --> 02:08:33,080
Hmm.
Like mustard.

2933
02:08:33,090 --> 02:08:38,090
Now I see.
This is a way more radical change than 

2934
02:08:38,090 --> 02:08:38,090
the other one.
The other one,

2935
02:08:38,090 --> 02:08:39,140
that other image was like a kind of that
kind of.

2936
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:44,270
It's like very light blue like you've.
We've always taken pictures before with 

2937
02:08:44,441 --> 02:08:46,510
like weird lighting on a digital camera 
and you're like,

2938
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:47,270
oh,
was weird.

2939
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:52,380
This doesn't look like,
but it really looked like in real life 

2940
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:52,380
because the colors are all off for 
whatever reason,

2941
02:08:52,380 --> 02:08:57,271
something's too bright like a flash and 
this is where I actually take this into 

2942
02:08:58,331 --> 02:09:03,331
photoshop and I use this thing called a 
color picker where it picks the color 

2943
02:09:03,331 --> 02:09:05,920
and it shows you what the color is.
So what I was clicking on,

2944
02:09:05,921 --> 02:09:08,350
which looked to me immediately,
gold or yellow,

2945
02:09:08,530 --> 02:09:11,140
it was doing brown,
dark brown,

2946
02:09:11,410 --> 02:09:13,810
almost black,
and then when I did it to the,

2947
02:09:13,811 --> 02:09:16,300
the what I thought was white,
it was doing it to a blue.

2948
02:09:16,540 --> 02:09:21,160
So then I decided to reverse in all the 
screens and the colors and watch how the

2949
02:09:21,161 --> 02:09:23,440
pictures six stay exactly the same.

2950
02:09:24,160 --> 02:09:26,200
I don't disagree with what you're saying
here,

2951
02:09:26,201 --> 02:09:30,170
but not all the data in there to 
compress file.

2952
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:35,190
It's not real life color,
but when you reverse colors it will 

2953
02:09:35,190 --> 02:09:35,190
change color.
Right.

2954
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:36,430
Well,
let's see.

2955
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:39,450
Let's see what happens.
See what.

2956
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,170
No,
it's the same colors.

2957
02:09:41,171 --> 02:09:44,710
What I'm saying,
it's white and gold right now.

2958
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:46,810
That's goal kind of a golden white right
now.

2959
02:09:46,870 --> 02:09:50,950
No,
he totally blue and black.

2960
02:09:51,180 --> 02:09:52,760
You see right there,
right there,

2961
02:09:52,930 --> 02:09:54,240
right there.
Frozen screen,

2962
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:57,620
dressed,
different type.

2963
02:09:58,050 --> 02:10:00,490
This is the problem.
That fucking weird.

2964
02:10:00,580 --> 02:10:01,840
Technically I.
Joe,

2965
02:10:01,860 --> 02:10:04,420
I think you know that it's black.
So you're saying it's black?

2966
02:10:04,620 --> 02:10:06,630
No,
no.

2967
02:10:06,660 --> 02:10:07,510
I'm seeing.
First of all,

2968
02:10:07,511 --> 02:10:09,940
the really important one,
the really important one is blue.

2969
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:14,970
The blue's undeniable to me that the 
other one that we're calling black 

2970
02:10:16,180 --> 02:10:18,220
commitment to this class,
it's not gold.

2971
02:10:18,221 --> 02:10:20,920
It's way darker than gold,
but it's not black.

2972
02:10:20,921 --> 02:10:23,080
Have like space,
you know?

2973
02:10:23,140 --> 02:10:27,220
It's more like sort of like a dark,
dark bronze looking sort of a thing,

2974
02:10:27,221 --> 02:10:30,730
but it's not black or gold.
It's sort of disingenuous.

2975
02:10:31,190 --> 02:10:32,740
It's like a creepy,
but the only.

2976
02:10:32,741 --> 02:10:34,280
Yeah.
The only way it could be black

2977
02:10:34,280 --> 02:10:36,710
as if it's blocked.
It's like super overexposed,

2978
02:10:38,210 --> 02:10:40,980
but if you look at it in a more blurry 
way,

2979
02:10:41,010 --> 02:10:44,330
somebody like if you,
if you like that image of behind you.

2980
02:10:44,331 --> 02:10:49,331
Here's what's interesting.
That image behind you on this different 

2981
02:10:49,331 --> 02:10:51,881
television look behind you,
over your left shoulder that looks 

2982
02:10:51,881 --> 02:10:52,670
different than that.
That looks way more black.

2983
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:57,880
The one behind you on a totally 
different television or different 

2984
02:10:57,880 --> 02:11:00,460
lessons.
I seen a better tv that's got more 

2985
02:11:00,460 --> 02:11:01,960
billions of more colors,
which it probably has.

2986
02:11:02,970 --> 02:11:06,010
The four K tv,
four K TV does.

2987
02:11:06,050 --> 02:11:11,050
This is the one that has the most,
has more resolution and might not have 

2988
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:11,050
more colors available.
Oh really?

2989
02:11:11,050 --> 02:11:12,070
Is that true?
Wow.

2990
02:11:12,170 --> 02:11:13,540
Four kids,
lines of resolution.

2991
02:11:13,580 --> 02:11:15,650
Whatever it is.
That one looks better.

2992
02:11:16,130 --> 02:11:18,230
That looks way better than that.
We'll see on both of them.

2993
02:11:18,231 --> 02:11:20,650
I see white and gold right now.
You see a completely different.

2994
02:11:20,660 --> 02:11:21,560
Okay.
Let me ask you this.

2995
02:11:21,740 --> 02:11:23,060
When you're looking at these two 
screens,

2996
02:11:23,061 --> 02:11:26,330
is one of them look clear to you more on
this one?

2997
02:11:26,450 --> 02:11:30,660
This one right here,
it looks brighter and crisper tray,

2998
02:11:30,720 --> 02:11:35,720
so it looks kind of more like dollar.
This looks like we're looking at the 

2999
02:11:35,720 --> 02:11:35,780
same dress through fog.
Where this,

3000
02:11:35,790 --> 02:11:39,390
this podcast.
A factor that people that just listen,

3001
02:11:39,410 --> 02:11:42,620
stop it.
I don't want to stop it.

3002
02:11:42,621 --> 02:11:45,050
I don't want to stop it because it's 
interesting because what you're saying I

3003
02:11:45,051 --> 02:11:50,051
think is important because you 
understand it is from the point of view 

3004
02:11:50,051 --> 02:11:51,600
of someone who understands like 
perspective photography.

3005
02:11:51,740 --> 02:11:54,560
I've seen this happen multiple times.
The photos I've taken,

3006
02:11:54,561 --> 02:11:58,730
I can change through white balance.
I can change the way a whole photo looks

3007
02:11:59,090 --> 02:12:04,090
from green to Brown,
so you take a picture of either you can 

3008
02:12:04,090 --> 02:12:07,730
make them blend like I see blue and 
black that's done that outside,

3009
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:08,530
smoke a cigarette.

3010
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:13,540
I can't deal with this.
You're totally not totally not getting 

3011
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:13,540
the point.
Jamie.

3012
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:17,480
I were both talking about contrast and 
brightness.

3013
02:12:17,481 --> 02:12:22,481
How we can change and make things.
Look I'm saying is me and Joe are 

3014
02:12:22,481 --> 02:12:24,310
looking at the exact same picture and it
looks exactly different.

3015
02:12:25,390 --> 02:12:28,670
Definitely a fact that seems to be going
on other than what you're talking about.

3016
02:12:28,790 --> 02:12:30,680
The thing when you're dealing with two 
totally different issues.

3017
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,350
First of all,
we're dealing with the change of color,

3018
02:12:33,351 --> 02:12:37,580
which was pretty drastic to me when I 
watched it go from white to gold to blue

3019
02:12:37,581 --> 02:12:38,750
and black.
I was like,

3020
02:12:38,751 --> 02:12:40,310
wow,
this is really weird.

3021
02:12:40,311 --> 02:12:41,540
Like,
this is really weird,

3022
02:12:42,050 --> 02:12:47,050
but then we're dealing with a frozen 
image and in that frozen image we see 

3023
02:12:47,050 --> 02:12:50,840
different things to different things.
I think that blows me away a little bit.

3024
02:12:51,200 --> 02:12:56,200
Well,
that makes it yellow cars all of a 

3025
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:56,200
sudden make sense?

3026
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:57,320
Now?
I was looking at yellow car.

3027
02:12:57,321 --> 02:13:02,321
I was like pitch.
Do you know there's a lot of other 

3028
02:13:02,321 --> 02:13:04,061
colors.
What the fuck do you want a yellow 

3029
02:13:04,061 --> 02:13:04,061
corvette?
This is ridiculous.

3030
02:13:04,061 --> 02:13:06,020
Mustard colored man now just like,
oh,

3031
02:13:06,021 --> 02:13:06,950
this one,
why not?

3032
02:13:06,951 --> 02:13:08,410
Black?
Black is like dope.

3033
02:13:08,570 --> 02:13:10,820
My heart pressure,
my blood pressure has gone up.

3034
02:13:10,880 --> 02:13:15,880
If you watch the video and brings it 
down and it makes you still think that 

3035
02:13:15,880 --> 02:13:20,321
time travel was created.
That day started off with Obama video.

3036
02:13:21,860 --> 02:13:23,720
It's just alumni getting away from 
beliefs.

3037
02:13:24,240 --> 02:13:29,240
Cool as the leper.
It's a black one and a white one and 

3038
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:32,040
there's people like trying trick,
like walking next

3039
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:32,970
to it like hey,
how's it going?

3040
02:13:32,971 --> 02:13:34,080
Hooked up.
And then the woman was like,

3041
02:13:34,081 --> 02:13:37,200
get the fuck away from immigrants.
Whether it's like police helicopters,

3042
02:13:37,201 --> 02:13:39,570
it's like news.
Just try not to kill it.

3043
02:13:39,571 --> 02:13:41,430
Right.
Captured.

3044
02:13:42,060 --> 02:13:44,280
I knew I do.
I'd Llamas Paul Barclay,

3045
02:13:44,281 --> 02:13:46,530
the owner of the comedy connection in 
Boston,

3046
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:48,370
one of the original owners.
He had a.

3047
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:53,480
He also owned this club called the rack.
He's a very successful club owner club 

3048
02:13:53,480 --> 02:13:54,980
called the rack member Brian.
We played at that place.

3049
02:13:54,981 --> 02:13:57,020
He was the pool hall that was right next
to the,

3050
02:13:57,030 --> 02:14:02,030
uh,
faneuil hall when we used to do the 

3051
02:14:02,030 --> 02:14:02,030
common connection down there.
Anyway,

3052
02:14:02,030 --> 02:14:03,840
that dude own llamas.
He had a fucking giant spread out in the

3053
02:14:03,841 --> 02:14:06,900
Cape and he had fucking lamas on his 
lawn and shit.

3054
02:14:07,010 --> 02:14:07,490
Yeah,
he wasn't.

3055
02:14:07,491 --> 02:14:09,270
The outback is the Alpac is what you 
want.

3056
02:14:09,610 --> 02:14:11,450
And then you want one lama to be 
dominant.

3057
02:14:11,720 --> 02:14:14,870
Exotic animals graze it on my fucking 
yard.

3058
02:14:16,760 --> 02:14:21,000
That's like the ultimate to have some 
crazy llamas in your front yard.

3059
02:14:21,001 --> 02:14:22,190
Do you smell?
What does that smell?

3060
02:14:22,400 --> 02:14:23,840
My fucking neighbors.
Llamas.

3061
02:14:23,870 --> 02:14:26,660
No,
I live on a farm.

3062
02:14:27,630 --> 02:14:29,810
Mama's been assaulted and raped that 
they had.

3063
02:14:29,811 --> 02:14:32,480
That has not been the sole really driven
through it.

3064
02:14:32,481 --> 02:14:37,481
I've not stopped.
They have this lead a Llama farm where 

3065
02:14:37,481 --> 02:14:37,630
you can just like hang out with a shit 
logo.

3066
02:14:37,631 --> 02:14:38,760
Llamas Dude,

3067
02:14:39,070 --> 02:14:44,070
I entered,
I did an entire TV show about the 

3068
02:14:44,070 --> 02:14:46,941
leaping Lama festival.
You want to know the best part of it is 

3069
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:48,280
the,
the,

3070
02:14:48,281 --> 02:14:48,840
the,
the,

3071
02:14:48,900 --> 02:14:53,070
the crux of the competition is how much 
you can adorn your Llama,

3072
02:14:53,100 --> 02:14:56,760
Llama with gear,
like put stuff on and cover its eyes and

3073
02:14:56,761 --> 02:15:01,761
how you can control it.
And you got to do a sketch in front of 

3074
02:15:01,761 --> 02:15:05,061
the whole [inaudible] for all the 
college high schools around all the 

3075
02:15:05,061 --> 02:15:05,061
parents,
all the kids.

3076
02:15:05,061 --> 02:15:06,210
And I have no,
I'm not producing.

3077
02:15:06,211 --> 02:15:07,980
I'm just host.
And I go,

3078
02:15:07,981 --> 02:15:12,981
so what's it mean?
The llamas skit and they're like rocky 

3079
02:15:12,981 --> 02:15:12,981
three.
I go,

3080
02:15:12,981 --> 02:15:16,761
oh,
it's my favorite rocky cover less than 

3081
02:15:16,761 --> 02:15:16,761
rocky.
I go,

3082
02:15:16,761 --> 02:15:16,761
I'm rocky.
And they're like,

3083
02:15:16,761 --> 02:15:17,160
fuck yeah,
you're going to come out.

3084
02:15:17,161 --> 02:15:18,870
The music will be playing.
You get the Llama,

3085
02:15:18,871 --> 02:15:20,520
Llama is going to look just like mister 
t.

3086
02:15:20,970 --> 02:15:25,190
So we get out.
I get it to the Llama was a white Lama.

3087
02:15:25,210 --> 02:15:29,670
They had to put it in black face,
like red lips.

3088
02:15:31,740 --> 02:15:34,200
And they were like,
let's part of the competition.

3089
02:15:34,580 --> 02:15:36,330
Is it pushing on his face?
I go,

3090
02:15:36,950 --> 02:15:41,950
it's black and gold.
To settle down,

3091
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,630
you breaking glass all neighbor's wall.

3092
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:07,760
It was and I had to dance out and they 
play just some fucking eye of the tiger 

3093
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:08,170
and I didn't take bunches at this 
fucking bike.

3094
02:16:09,650 --> 02:16:14,520
It's a fucking Lama.
Oh my God.

3095
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:19,090
My friend Steve [inaudible] and his 
brother Matt,

3096
02:16:19,100 --> 02:16:21,910
he's llamas.
When they hunt to carry out the meat,

3097
02:16:22,230 --> 02:16:26,710
what are the drug trained llamas trained
llamas.

3098
02:16:26,711 --> 02:16:30,820
They take them into like a cargo van.
They load them up in the back of the van

3099
02:16:30,970 --> 02:16:35,970
and they bring them to like Montana and 
they pull them out of the van and these 

3100
02:16:35,970 --> 02:16:37,900
things are hardy as fuck and they just.
They can just carry shit.

3101
02:16:38,180 --> 02:16:39,820
They don't give a fuck.
They don't get cold.

3102
02:16:39,821 --> 02:16:41,920
They just stand out there in the snow 
and they're like whatever.

3103
02:16:42,150 --> 02:16:47,150
Like it doesn't bother them at all.
Their body temperature is way higher 

3104
02:16:47,150 --> 02:16:49,651
than ours.
Their way sturdier than ours and they 

3105
02:16:49,651 --> 02:16:49,651
use them.
The packout meat.

3106
02:16:49,651 --> 02:16:52,981
It's crazy.
He had a whole show about it and his 

3107
02:16:52,981 --> 02:16:52,981
show about like these llamas going with 
them out in.

3108
02:16:52,981 --> 02:16:57,731
They're like getting an elk and packing 
into the back of these fucking llamas 

3109
02:16:57,731 --> 02:16:59,420
and traveling out of the,
out of the woods with them.

3110
02:16:59,450 --> 02:17:04,450
It's just so weird.
He apparently he had a moose once and in

3111
02:17:04,991 --> 02:17:07,830
carrying the Moose back to his car,
like over and over again.

3112
02:17:07,831 --> 02:17:11,560
And all these trips he fucked his back 
up so he literally couldn't hunt anymore

3113
02:17:11,561 --> 02:17:14,380
because he couldn't carry anything out 
because he had hurt his back so bad.

3114
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:17,590
So he trained.
All these moves are trained all these.

3115
02:17:17,591 --> 02:17:18,350
Um,
uh,

3116
02:17:18,360 --> 02:17:19,480
what other,
what are they called again?

3117
02:17:19,570 --> 02:17:20,550
Nice.
No,

3118
02:17:20,580 --> 02:17:21,850
the thing we were just talking about,
blah,

3119
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:22,610
blah,
blah.

3120
02:17:22,740 --> 02:17:26,500
Most trained all these llamas to carry 
out the world.

3121
02:17:26,501 --> 02:17:27,490
Lose weight.
No,

3122
02:17:27,610 --> 02:17:30,100
it's just that the word law,
I don't use that often.

3123
02:17:30,101 --> 02:17:33,100
It's not on the tip of my tongue.
I'll pocket was there for some reason.

3124
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:34,420
I was like,
that's not it.

3125
02:17:34,990 --> 02:17:35,860
It's a Lama.
But.

3126
02:17:35,861 --> 02:17:39,850
So these fucking things are pissing 
inside this van.

3127
02:17:40,110 --> 02:17:41,980
They'll let the skus thing back in.

3128
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:45,700
It's cargo van and then they pull them 
out and they slept in the van.

3129
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:48,990
They'll spit at.
You just can't,

3130
02:17:49,110 --> 02:17:49,900
you know,
big cat,

3131
02:17:49,901 --> 02:17:50,380
Derek,
right?

3132
02:17:50,381 --> 02:17:55,381
Like,
I've been a Texas that has all the 

3133
02:17:55,381 --> 02:17:55,381
animals.
He has a Llama in and uh,

3134
02:17:55,381 --> 02:17:56,260
he has these.
If you look at his,

3135
02:17:56,261 --> 02:17:58,060
uh,
videos on instagram,

3136
02:17:58,061 --> 02:17:59,120
big cat,
Derek,

3137
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:01,600
he led his Lama in his house the other 
day.

3138
02:18:02,210 --> 02:18:04,480
I don't know why he does this.
I think he just does it to film it,

3139
02:18:04,481 --> 02:18:09,481
but the loss is like breaking shit,
going through his tablets and throwing 

3140
02:18:09,481 --> 02:18:11,530
things and it's just like polaris is his
great guy.

3141
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:16,120
That's fucking rude.
Animal man was rude,

3142
02:18:16,780 --> 02:18:21,780
but they don't give a fuck dude.
They have these things in the mountains 

3143
02:18:21,780 --> 02:18:22,630
in Montana.
It's snowing like crazy.

3144
02:18:22,631 --> 02:18:27,631
She was just standing there like they 
don't give a fuck and it makes you 

3145
02:18:27,881 --> 02:18:32,470
realize like we're so vulnerable when it
comes to the environment that we kind of

3146
02:18:32,471 --> 02:18:37,471
like think of all animals as even though
we know that other animals are more 

3147
02:18:37,471 --> 02:18:41,821
harder than us,
we just don't understand like how could 

3148
02:18:41,821 --> 02:18:41,821
they survive this environment?

3149
02:18:41,821 --> 02:18:42,190
But how did we.
Well,

3150
02:18:42,191 --> 02:18:43,860
we figured out a way.
Nobody.

3151
02:18:43,890 --> 02:18:45,970
I mean,
how did the first couple of generations.

3152
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:51,000
It took awhile.
I'm sure we could only live in places 

3153
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,690
where you can live without any worry of 
like heat heating yourself.

3154
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:57,920
Like that was the big issue.
Like everything started out in the rain 

3155
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:57,920
forest,
right?

3156
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,420
That's what they think.
It all started out in Africa.

3157
02:18:58,780 --> 02:19:02,080
If it all started out in Africa,
Africa is warm as fuck.

3158
02:19:02,081 --> 02:19:07,081
Okay.
The last thing you have to worry about 

3159
02:19:07,081 --> 02:19:08,371
as close,
the last thing you have to worry about 

3160
02:19:08,371 --> 02:19:10,381
is the abundance of life.
The first thing you have to worry about 

3161
02:19:10,381 --> 02:19:10,381
is not becoming food.
That's number one.

3162
02:19:10,381 --> 02:19:15,241
So it's all about getting to the high 
trees have figured out weapons and it 

3163
02:19:15,241 --> 02:19:19,531
starts out.
You're a bunch of super horny monkeys 

3164
02:19:19,531 --> 02:19:22,590
who fucked like crazy because had to 
reproduce as much as you can and 

3165
02:19:22,590 --> 02:19:26,000
everybody fucks everybody so that nobody
gets greedy as far as like a loser 

3166
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,000
motherfucker.

3167
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:26,050
Kids,
your kids can suck my dick.

3168
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:31,380
Everybody's like raising everybody 
because you're just trying to keep away 

3169
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:33,941
from Jaguars and fucking leopards and 
shit and whatever the hell else is 

3170
02:19:33,941 --> 02:19:38,171
trying to eat you.
So that's what we were forever until we 

3171
02:19:38,171 --> 02:19:39,470
slowly but surely figured out weapons,
figured out,

3172
02:19:39,471 --> 02:19:42,440
weapons and shelter.
As soon as we get think we could fuck it

3173
02:19:42,890 --> 02:19:44,590
up,
build something from nothing,

3174
02:19:44,600 --> 02:19:45,710
get in and go,
okay,

3175
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:47,870
how do you want to deal with this 
motherfuckers dude,

3176
02:19:47,871 --> 02:19:48,950
I've been thinking,
you know,

3177
02:19:48,951 --> 02:19:52,280
like you pull a stick and it kinda like 
goes back to the original shape.

3178
02:19:52,370 --> 02:19:57,370
If I tie him fucking string on that 
bench and then have some shit with like 

3179
02:19:57,370 --> 02:19:57,980
a long pointy thing that's sharpen the 
end,

3180
02:19:58,010 --> 02:20:03,010
I think he can fly I think on my 
shooting right at these fucking crazy 

3181
02:20:03,010 --> 02:20:07,001
bear that are eating our babies and 
we're going to figure out how to 

3182
02:20:07,001 --> 02:20:07,001
dominate these woods.

3183
02:20:07,001 --> 02:20:10,870
And then next thing you know,
they started killing things and they 

3184
02:20:10,870 --> 02:20:13,151
started using fire.
They figured out how to knock rocks 

3185
02:20:13,151 --> 02:20:16,361
together to create sparks in the embers 
would blow on it like dried moss and 

3186
02:20:17,331 --> 02:20:19,700
shit that they had saved for this 
occasion.

3187
02:20:19,701 --> 02:20:24,701
They get that little amber crackling and
they stack would upon it and that keeps 

3188
02:20:24,701 --> 02:20:26,180
the animals away from the animals.
Can't believe they can control the fire.

3189
02:20:26,460 --> 02:20:30,080
These motherfuckers that fire in their 
hands and they slowly figured out how to

3190
02:20:30,081 --> 02:20:35,081
stockpile food.
They slowly figured out how to make 

3191
02:20:35,081 --> 02:20:37,781
walls of community.
Like I think like at times like nine 11 

3192
02:20:39,291 --> 02:20:41,000
community becomes tighter because 
there's fear.

3193
02:20:41,260 --> 02:20:46,260
Fear is out there.
Do you think when people were getting 

3194
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:47,030
eaten and they were a community,
do you think community was tighter or do

3195
02:20:47,031 --> 02:20:49,280
you think there are people that talk 
shit behind people's backs?

3196
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:53,150
They think the gossipy shit,
like really like gossipy type,

3197
02:20:53,151 --> 02:20:55,970
like the way people do it today and the 
way people like,

3198
02:20:56,450 --> 02:21:01,450
especially into celebrity gossip.
There's one theory that I found really 

3199
02:21:01,450 --> 02:21:05,141
fascinating was that they think that it 
has something to do with a lack of 

3200
02:21:05,141 --> 02:21:05,540
community.
Like someone was talking about.

3201
02:21:06,170 --> 02:21:11,170
They were talking about communities 
bonding together against an enemy like 

3202
02:21:11,480 --> 02:21:14,900
which is what cities used to be like.
Cities used to bond together.

3203
02:21:14,901 --> 02:21:19,760
They used to have to worry about someone
from outside coming into their meds,

3204
02:21:19,970 --> 02:21:24,970
but now people don't do that anymore 
because they don't really know their 

3205
02:21:24,970 --> 02:21:27,761
neighbors,
so they're not bonded with all the 

3206
02:21:27,761 --> 02:21:30,101
people that they live next to the,
that they live next to her almost 

3207
02:21:30,101 --> 02:21:32,030
inconvenient and instead of it being 
like the best people in the world,

3208
02:21:32,031 --> 02:21:34,130
like they're all like,
everyone's surrounded together.

3209
02:21:34,350 --> 02:21:36,320
No,
you just next to Mr.

3210
02:21:36,320 --> 02:21:41,320
Johnson and he's kind of an asshole and 
his dog shits on your yard and it's 

3211
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:41,320
fuck,
you know,

3212
02:21:41,320 --> 02:21:43,250
there's always like,
there's always some weirdness involved,

3213
02:21:43,251 --> 02:21:45,140
but if there were lions roaming through 
the community,

3214
02:21:45,141 --> 02:21:46,250
we'd all be a lot tighter.

3215
02:21:46,390 --> 02:21:46,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

3216
02:21:46,970 --> 02:21:49,320
If you had to,
if you had to use a title,

3217
02:21:49,380 --> 02:21:52,110
a great idea for a community service 
project,

3218
02:21:52,280 --> 02:21:54,790
just released the line one line,
no,

3219
02:21:55,340 --> 02:22:00,340
probably just going to be somebody who 
doesn't realize that lying can fucking 

3220
02:22:00,340 --> 02:22:00,770
kill you and they'll be really mad if 
you kill the lion.

3221
02:22:01,030 --> 02:22:03,280
You know,
this is people that like they,

3222
02:22:03,320 --> 02:22:06,920
they really do choose animals over 
people and animals.

3223
02:22:06,921 --> 02:22:11,921
Welfare over people.
Like what we were saying before about 

3224
02:22:11,921 --> 02:22:11,921
people working hard to keep the Tigers 
alive.

3225
02:22:11,921 --> 02:22:14,120
Like I get it.
I believe me.

3226
02:22:14,121 --> 02:22:16,370
I got it.
I'm completely joking.

3227
02:22:16,371 --> 02:22:21,080
I don't want tigers to go extinct,
but if I lived in India I would be like,

3228
02:22:21,081 --> 02:22:23,420
fuck in Rambo.
Okay.

3229
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:27,270
I would make an iron man and I'd get 
every fucking wet with tigers.

3230
02:22:27,271 --> 02:22:30,450
Ain't my family dude.
I would go when guns.

3231
02:22:30,730 --> 02:22:33,870
Yeah.
I would just be wandering through.

3232
02:22:33,871 --> 02:22:36,700
The tall grass is gunning down those 
cunty cats.

3233
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:39,570
Imagine v Eight,
your mom in front of you.

3234
02:22:39,720 --> 02:22:41,010
Tiger eight.
Your fucking mother.

3235
02:22:41,011 --> 02:22:43,650
And dragged her off the top of a tree.
Like what?

3236
02:22:44,070 --> 02:22:49,070
What?
What is this world where you're trying 

3237
02:22:49,070 --> 02:22:51,180
to save these things that I'm not 
fucking metal helmet on.

3238
02:22:51,181 --> 02:22:53,910
Like iron man and shit.
All fucking bolted down.

3239
02:22:54,150 --> 02:22:59,150
Just a giant carbon fiber and metal 
outfit with machine guns,

3240
02:22:59,810 --> 02:23:03,390
with like a brilliant writer to watch 
him a backpack filled with ammo.

3241
02:23:04,220 --> 02:23:09,220
Wow.
I just fuck tigers.

3242
02:23:11,080 --> 02:23:14,740
I was 10 feet from a lion about a month 
ago.

3243
02:23:15,190 --> 02:23:19,360
10 feet from ally in the wild.
Just watch it does little.

3244
02:23:19,361 --> 02:23:24,361
Just every little movement of an animal 
is so heightened when it could kill you 

3245
02:23:24,361 --> 02:23:26,170
because it looks at you.
One of those be those supporters.

3246
02:23:26,171 --> 02:23:28,000
Yeah.
Why don't you open air?

3247
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:30,490
Why are they open like that?
Because it's a real.

3248
02:23:30,491 --> 02:23:32,660
It's a real like you.
And it's scary.

3249
02:23:32,661 --> 02:23:34,030
I'd look,
I'd love to be in a van,

3250
02:23:34,330 --> 02:23:39,330
but it's real because you see the will 
to beach running next to you and you're 

3251
02:23:39,330 --> 02:23:39,580
running right next to them and then you 
see the line and you see the hippo.

3252
02:23:39,581 --> 02:23:42,100
Usually the giraffe.
You see everything out there.

3253
02:23:42,101 --> 02:23:43,250
You don't see gorillas.
That's not,

3254
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:44,830
that's the wrong place.
But like,

3255
02:23:44,831 --> 02:23:46,750
uh,
the line was 10 feet from us.

3256
02:23:46,751 --> 02:23:47,270
I mean,
uh,

3257
02:23:47,440 --> 02:23:49,240
for me to that wall right there.

3258
02:23:49,450 --> 02:23:52,240
And I just looked at it and it looks at 
you,

3259
02:23:52,270 --> 02:23:57,270
just like a cat just looks at you,
flaps its tail tail stares and looks off

3260
02:23:58,570 --> 02:24:00,340
and used to waiting for it to make that 
one move.

3261
02:24:00,341 --> 02:24:00,730
Like,
Huh.

3262
02:24:00,760 --> 02:24:02,080
And then go.
It's all fucking over.

3263
02:24:03,220 --> 02:24:05,110
But it was,
it was well worth.

3264
02:24:05,111 --> 02:24:10,111
It is amazing that timelines for an 
episode to Herbert one time here.

3265
02:24:11,660 --> 02:24:14,200
What'd you have to do?
Going around going to a room,

3266
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:17,860
a cage with like for I guess 
theoretically unruly lions,

3267
02:24:17,950 --> 02:24:22,950
boom.
Three to four lions and they call them 

3268
02:24:22,950 --> 02:24:24,200
out and they gave me a two.
I.

3269
02:24:24,220 --> 02:24:29,010
They gave me like a to fanny,
fanny pack full of Sirloin plunger.

3270
02:24:29,020 --> 02:24:32,260
Stick with a nail on it and I liked.
This is called your meat stick.

3271
02:24:32,261 --> 02:24:33,550
Don't lose it.
Don't drop it.

3272
02:24:34,090 --> 02:24:35,710
They respect you.
As long as you have your meat stick,

3273
02:24:35,711 --> 02:24:39,340
put meat on the meat stick and the lions
will respond to the meat.

3274
02:24:39,450 --> 02:24:40,360
Fuck.

3275
02:24:43,610 --> 02:24:48,610
Smell of fear coming off.
You must have been like a like a New 

3276
02:24:48,610 --> 02:24:51,770
Jersey fucking trash dump.
It must've been just wall.

3277
02:24:51,880 --> 02:24:53,380
This guy is terrified.

3278
02:24:53,460 --> 02:24:56,110
It was fucking really scary.
Smell that.

3279
02:24:56,111 --> 02:24:57,230
Do you think they get swole?
Dude?

3280
02:24:57,240 --> 02:24:59,930
Oh,
when you see that animal size you up,

3281
02:24:59,960 --> 02:25:02,210
there's no doubt that is the king of the
jungle.

3282
02:25:02,510 --> 02:25:03,710
I'm.
I'm being dead serious.

3283
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:05,750
He called out.
It's a little bit of it sounds.

3284
02:25:05,810 --> 02:25:10,810
It's gonna.
I'm not going to do the bidding part of 

3285
02:25:10,810 --> 02:25:10,810
it.
What sounds like a bit,

3286
02:25:10,810 --> 02:25:10,810
but like it's very true.
He calls him out.

3287
02:25:11,150 --> 02:25:12,990
He said they all listened to the,
to,

3288
02:25:13,070 --> 02:25:15,250
to the head of the pride,
cost them out and he's like,

3289
02:25:15,260 --> 02:25:19,640
move Fossa and this just comes out.
When you see a lion look at you.

3290
02:25:19,880 --> 02:25:21,310
It's not,
it's not like another,

3291
02:25:21,320 --> 02:25:26,320
it's not like someone walking.
It's like someone walking by you in 

3292
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:26,860
prison.
He sizes you up.

3293
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:29,830
I mean I looked at that thing and he,
his eyes are huge.

3294
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:31,210
His lungs,
as you breathe,

3295
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:32,980
feel like golf bags were being squeezed.

3296
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:36,910
I mean you could hear these brands like,
I mean,

3297
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:39,250
and it just runs up and then it stands 
there,

3298
02:25:39,251 --> 02:25:40,840
but it never keeps a take.
Texas I off you.

3299
02:25:40,841 --> 02:25:42,070
It's never like know what the fuck's 
going on.

3300
02:25:42,071 --> 02:25:44,470
It's just staring at you,
sizing you up.

3301
02:25:45,130 --> 02:25:50,130
He caught up to more lions.
The next one's name was a Simba and the 

3302
02:25:50,130 --> 02:25:52,330
last one's name was like dog or Reggie,
like it was fucking horrible,

3303
02:25:52,331 --> 02:25:54,100
but the,
he calls it over and it just.

3304
02:25:54,250 --> 02:25:57,760
The one last one was truly and just went
right up to me,

3305
02:25:58,350 --> 02:26:01,390
a nose in my junk but not but powerful.
You know,

3306
02:26:01,391 --> 02:26:03,260
when a dog does it and everyone's like,
oh,

3307
02:26:03,261 --> 02:26:05,290
and they hold their but doesn't feel 
like he's in it.

3308
02:26:05,380 --> 02:26:07,420
He put his nose,
my junk and bent me over,

3309
02:26:07,421 --> 02:26:12,421
like,
and I dropped the meat stick and I'm 

3310
02:26:12,421 --> 02:26:12,640
fumbling for my fucking meat.
I'm like,

3311
02:26:12,670 --> 02:26:14,710
it was,
it was intense as fuck.

3312
02:26:14,830 --> 02:26:19,830
Oh my God.
We did this thing called the ring of 

3313
02:26:19,830 --> 02:26:22,251
circle or the tunnel of death where they
stand the lines up for lions and they 

3314
02:26:22,251 --> 02:26:26,850
hang over and they,
and they grow with you as you walk 

3315
02:26:26,850 --> 02:26:29,160
through the door.
Just just like your fucking night.

3316
02:26:29,230 --> 02:26:32,470
Now it's your first night in prison,
mother fucker.

3317
02:26:32,471 --> 02:26:34,660
And it was broader.
It was fucking insane.

3318
02:26:36,410 --> 02:26:37,330
Uh,
for TB.

3319
02:26:37,331 --> 02:26:42,331
So that no one saw that.
The scariest thing you've ever had to 

3320
02:26:42,331 --> 02:26:42,331
do.

3321
02:26:44,500 --> 02:26:46,750
I've done who I.
The scariest thing was getting mauled by

3322
02:26:46,751 --> 02:26:49,960
the bull probably because I really got 
hurt and I could've gotten killed.

3323
02:26:50,350 --> 02:26:52,020
That's probably the scariest thing.
You know,

3324
02:26:53,350 --> 02:26:56,230
you've seen it hit type in Herbert Rodeo
clown.

3325
02:26:56,690 --> 02:26:57,090
Oh,
that's,

3326
02:26:57,150 --> 02:27:00,160
yeah.
I'm sure we have.

3327
02:27:00,660 --> 02:27:05,660
I'm sure we have.
That was probably the scariest guy 

3328
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:05,660
realized,
oh fuck.

3329
02:27:05,660 --> 02:27:08,880
There is no,
there is no like into like a golden egg 

3330
02:27:08,880 --> 02:27:12,451
policy in this TV show.
They don't really give a fuck if I get 

3331
02:27:12,451 --> 02:27:13,240
hurt.
My ribs broke my foot and I was like,

3332
02:27:13,450 --> 02:27:15,190
and then I remember getting done and 
they were like,

3333
02:27:15,690 --> 02:27:17,230
ah,
we need more footage.

3334
02:27:17,290 --> 02:27:19,480
This is just me getting bolt.
This is perfect.

3335
02:27:20,310 --> 02:27:24,010
So this bull,
this is a big fucking bull dude.

3336
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:29,020
Oh my stuck in a bullpen with this.
Thank God my foot's broken.

3337
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:34,840
I'm trying to run on it,
but it's broken.

3338
02:27:35,510 --> 02:27:40,510
Oh my God.
Charged you to death.

3339
02:27:43,150 --> 02:27:44,980
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.

3340
02:27:45,000 --> 02:27:50,000
That's,
that's when I realized that's what 

3341
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:51,490
scared me the most about a reality 
driven hosts.

3342
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:56,520
Reality shows and they needed me that we
had actually shot for about another hour

3343
02:27:57,640 --> 02:27:58,690
of me in a,
in a,

3344
02:27:58,990 --> 02:28:01,780
in a barrel and it will hit in the 
barrel because.

3345
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:04,300
Because this is back when you had to 
make tv that was eight minutes,

3346
02:28:04,360 --> 02:28:09,360
like get an a,
do an eight minute cigarette for five 

3347
02:28:09,360 --> 02:28:11,071
minute segment.
So it didn't feel like they had it just 

3348
02:28:11,071 --> 02:28:12,961
a shot.
What kind of fucking producers do you 

3349
02:28:12,961 --> 02:28:12,961
have?
Man,

3350
02:28:12,961 --> 02:28:17,251
that's ridiculous.
The same one that maybe I told the 

3351
02:28:17,251 --> 02:28:17,251
fighting the bear story on,
this isn't happening.

3352
02:28:17,251 --> 02:28:18,370
This is not happening.
It's the same producer.

3353
02:28:18,990 --> 02:28:20,980
Oh my God,
that's crazy.

3354
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:24,080
Was like reckless with you.
He made me wear makeup.

3355
02:28:24,480 --> 02:28:25,860
I was uh,
yeah.

3356
02:28:26,030 --> 02:28:31,030
That,
that was probably the scariest thing 

3357
02:28:31,030 --> 02:28:31,030
I've done to date.

3358
02:28:31,030 --> 02:28:34,060
Having said that,
obviously jumping on a plane and Rachel 

3359
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:34,060
Ray was terrifying.
Uh,

3360
02:28:34,060 --> 02:28:34,580
being the first guy to jump off the 
stratosphere is pretty insane.

3361
02:28:35,080 --> 02:28:37,010
A lot of these rope swings when I'm 
doing these days,

3362
02:28:37,011 --> 02:28:39,420
I showed you the one in Durbin,
but we didn't want in Switzerland.

3363
02:28:39,460 --> 02:28:41,990
That was like fucking next level.
Terrifying.

3364
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:47,180
Fucking horrifying.
When I began investing big animals,

3365
02:28:47,181 --> 02:28:50,180
you can't tell them to like take it a 
50% so that we get the shot.

3366
02:28:50,210 --> 02:28:52,950
What did that feel like when that thing 
fucking slammed into you?

3367
02:28:53,460 --> 02:28:56,060
Helpless.
It's like he ever been in a car accident

3368
02:28:56,061 --> 02:28:57,530
and you and you went,
oh fuck,

3369
02:28:57,531 --> 02:28:58,240
I forgot.
Um,

3370
02:28:58,250 --> 02:29:00,170
for this fragile,
helpless.

3371
02:29:00,171 --> 02:29:01,460
When it hit me,
I remember,

3372
02:29:01,820 --> 02:29:03,680
I remember it instantly knocking the 
hell out of me.

3373
02:29:03,960 --> 02:29:04,940
Oh.
And um,

3374
02:29:04,941 --> 02:29:06,020
but there was this,
this,

3375
02:29:06,060 --> 02:29:11,060
uh,
this fight or flight fight or flight 

3376
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:13,900
survival instinct where I was and my 
foot was broken and my ribs were broken 

3377
02:29:13,900 --> 02:29:14,210
an automatic.

3378
02:29:14,210 --> 02:29:16,130
I just get up,
like I remember the first words,

3379
02:29:16,131 --> 02:29:17,150
I said,
how do we get out of here?

3380
02:29:17,660 --> 02:29:19,610
But it's not like there's no TV in my 
head.

3381
02:29:19,611 --> 02:29:20,930
I'm just like,
how the fuck do I get out of here?

3382
02:29:21,090 --> 02:29:26,090
And they told me the number one thing 
they said do not go to the walls of the 

3383
02:29:26,090 --> 02:29:27,560
ring because he pinned you in between 
there,

3384
02:29:27,561 --> 02:29:29,450
he won't let go and,
and that'll kill you.

3385
02:29:30,280 --> 02:29:31,610
And I went by,
I didn't,

3386
02:29:31,670 --> 02:29:34,040
I didn't think I just went right to the 
fucking wall to get out of there because

3387
02:29:34,041 --> 02:29:35,870
I was like,
I'm in the middle of the fucking pen,

3388
02:29:36,100 --> 02:29:37,990
it's going to come back for me.
It's going to stop me.

3389
02:29:37,991 --> 02:29:41,750
He says Christ.
And they had no fucking plan to keep you

3390
02:29:41,751 --> 02:29:43,280
safe.
They had no plan,

3391
02:29:43,670 --> 02:29:46,010
no plan.
And I think,

3392
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:49,250
I think fx canceled that knowing,
fuck,

3393
02:29:49,251 --> 02:29:50,240
we really dodged a bullet.

3394
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:52,740
This kid could have been killed.
Um,

3395
02:29:52,760 --> 02:29:53,470
but,
uh,

3396
02:29:54,380 --> 02:29:55,710
trust issues,
now I have a hard.

3397
02:29:55,850 --> 02:29:56,420
Especially.
No,

3398
02:29:56,430 --> 02:30:01,430
I know that sounds like joke.
I have a hardcore trust issues with 

3399
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:01,430
reality shows should a very,
like I,

3400
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:04,040
everyone that works on [inaudible] 
conquer,

3401
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:05,690
they all know that I,
I'm like,

3402
02:30:05,870 --> 02:30:09,710
I feel like you may fuck with my safety 
to get the shot.

3403
02:30:09,800 --> 02:30:11,450
And here's the other problem is 
sometimes when I say this,

3404
02:30:11,510 --> 02:30:13,640
and I know maybe you've listened to this
and you've been a part of this,

3405
02:30:13,770 --> 02:30:18,770
but there are guys that know me.
If they see me on an we're shooting and 

3406
02:30:18,770 --> 02:30:18,770
they recognize this podcast,
you know,

3407
02:30:18,770 --> 02:30:23,740
my honesty,
the problem sometimes is going to a 

3408
02:30:23,740 --> 02:30:23,740
place where you go,
like,

3409
02:30:23,740 --> 02:30:25,640
uh,
we're going to go redneck button and uh,

3410
02:30:25,641 --> 02:30:26,990
and we've got a guy,
we got a truck,

3411
02:30:26,991 --> 02:30:31,991
we're going to interview on TV,
then we're going to get his truck and 

3412
02:30:31,991 --> 02:30:31,991
he's going to take us for a ride.

3413
02:30:31,991 --> 02:30:32,120
Well sometimes it's not always,
you know,

3414
02:30:32,121 --> 02:30:34,310
across the board that you can't drink in
those trucks.

3415
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:36,200
And a lot of times the guys are 
drinking.

3416
02:30:36,710 --> 02:30:39,530
And the other thing that is kind of 
fucked up is,

3417
02:30:40,620 --> 02:30:43,570
is what I want to paint it off,
that all these red mud things are,

3418
02:30:43,571 --> 02:30:47,480
but often they don't really care.
And the other thing is,

3419
02:30:47,570 --> 02:30:50,870
is that for TV,
that one guy who has been drinking,

3420
02:30:50,871 --> 02:30:53,180
whose names like Bubba,
he wants to.

3421
02:30:53,300 --> 02:30:56,660
You got to show the Hollywood boy what 
we do down here in Alabama.

3422
02:30:56,661 --> 02:30:58,400
And I'm going to say in Alabama was the 
place that we did this.

3423
02:30:58,401 --> 02:31:03,401
I understand what you're saying.
We gotta we gotta show this Hollywood 

3424
02:31:03,401 --> 02:31:03,401
boy had.
Hey Ricky,

3425
02:31:03,401 --> 02:31:04,730
bobby Bubba,
take until the next level.

3426
02:31:04,790 --> 02:31:06,980
Oh Shit.
And you get guys were,

3427
02:31:07,040 --> 02:31:10,160
were they say to you stuff like,
you're going to get fucked up tonight,

3428
02:31:10,161 --> 02:31:10,700
Hollywood.

3429
02:31:10,850 --> 02:31:12,380
And you're like,
and you just,

3430
02:31:12,381 --> 02:31:14,240
it's this weird thing you do.
You do.

3431
02:31:14,241 --> 02:31:17,200
Do a fucking sky jumps in these jumps.
And they're like.

3432
02:31:17,360 --> 02:31:19,400
So the guy was telling me I did want to 
Switzerland,

3433
02:31:19,401 --> 02:31:20,400
he goes,
make sure you lift your feet.

3434
02:31:20,401 --> 02:31:21,660
You might hit the rock.
And I went,

3435
02:31:21,661 --> 02:31:22,390
hold on.
I go,

3436
02:31:22,470 --> 02:31:23,880
I need to know if I'm gonna.
Hit The fucking rock.

3437
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:29,000
Jesus Christ.
He's fucking with you because you're 

3438
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:29,000
making a TV show and they think they're 
happy.

3439
02:31:29,000 --> 02:31:30,380
I'll be making better TV shows.
And,

3440
02:31:30,630 --> 02:31:34,140
and so that happens a lot of times as 
you'd go to these fucking tracks.

3441
02:31:34,410 --> 02:31:35,580
Are these,
these like,

3442
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:38,010
you know,
like we were enough top fuel dragster,

3443
02:31:38,011 --> 02:31:41,730
a hundred 1,530
miles an hour in three seconds and uh,

3444
02:31:41,731 --> 02:31:46,731
and I had a panic full panic attack like
because they put you in a flame 

3445
02:31:46,731 --> 02:31:50,631
retardant suit,
five point harness the harness your 

3446
02:31:50,631 --> 02:31:50,631
hands,
so the suit,

3447
02:31:50,631 --> 02:31:50,631
so you can't move your hands.

3448
02:31:50,730 --> 02:31:55,730
So now.
So you're basically in handcuffs and 

3449
02:31:55,730 --> 02:31:55,730
like a straight jacket,
they put a helmet on you in a neck brace

3450
02:31:55,730 --> 02:32:00,321
on the helmet around you.
So in a titan helmet up and you cannot 

3451
02:32:00,321 --> 02:32:00,321
move.
It's for your safety.

3452
02:32:00,321 --> 02:32:03,000
But I started panicking and I was like 
very clear.

3453
02:32:03,001 --> 02:32:03,570
I was like,
hey guys,

3454
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:08,840
I don't need you to try to break the 
world record like 130 miles an hour in 

3455
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:10,170
three seconds it's going to look pretty 
fast and you just want to make sure that

3456
02:32:10,171 --> 02:32:13,350
they don't want to make the thing that 
they're making the show better.

3457
02:32:14,190 --> 02:32:15,270
Danger.
Yeah,

3458
02:32:15,680 --> 02:32:18,540
that sounds really fucking dangerous.
There's a lot of things,

3459
02:32:18,541 --> 02:32:19,380
but it's all.
It's all.

3460
02:32:19,381 --> 02:32:20,920
I mean,
you know,

3461
02:32:20,940 --> 02:32:24,090
everything was that we've ever done has 
always been engaged in safety,

3462
02:32:24,270 --> 02:32:25,800
but that's because I'm an executive 
producer and I'm,

3463
02:32:25,801 --> 02:32:28,090
fuck everyone knows what pussy,
but isn't it fascinating,

3464
02:32:28,100 --> 02:32:33,100
dude,
that you have these like really 

3465
02:32:33,100 --> 02:32:35,230
contradictory feelings,
like you're terrified of shifts here job

3466
02:32:35,550 --> 02:32:40,550
like a big part of your job entails you 
putting yourself in tremendous danger 

3467
02:32:40,550 --> 02:32:41,040
for no reason whatsoever.

3468
02:32:42,140 --> 02:32:43,620
Think about that all the time.
I wonder.

3469
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:49,400
I wonder what the Fuck's wrong with me?
I'm trying to exercise it out of your 

3470
02:32:49,400 --> 02:32:50,010
system or something.
Here's the thing.

3471
02:32:50,011 --> 02:32:52,120
So like I went scuba diving at 80 feet.
Go wreck.

3472
02:32:52,121 --> 02:32:54,750
I had a panic attack halfway through the
swim back up,

3473
02:32:54,751 --> 02:32:57,090
Lord,
in a moment of panic,

3474
02:32:57,570 --> 02:33:01,060
in a real panic.
It's beautiful because it's never.

3475
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:04,650
Life's never been more defined in what 
you want and what you don't want.

3476
02:33:05,500 --> 02:33:07,950
I want nothing at the bottom of the 
ocean.

3477
02:33:08,150 --> 02:33:13,150
All the Shit I dig this up top.
But I ended up doing it and seeing the 

3478
02:33:13,860 --> 02:33:15,400
[inaudible] feet,
my brain the whole time.

3479
02:33:15,401 --> 02:33:17,340
It was like,
I could totally fuck with you right now.

3480
02:33:17,930 --> 02:33:20,700
And uh,
and celebrating it.

3481
02:33:20,701 --> 02:33:21,590
I mean,
it's,

3482
02:33:21,600 --> 02:33:22,270
it's,
it's,

3483
02:33:22,380 --> 02:33:27,380
it's finding new boundaries in your 
spirit or your soul or your DNA and 

3484
02:33:27,731 --> 02:33:30,240
getting the next level.
And I dictated to it.

3485
02:33:35,460 --> 02:33:36,970
Here's your space.
Traveling.

3486
02:33:37,090 --> 02:33:38,540
Everybody wants to go to space.
You know,

3487
02:33:38,541 --> 02:33:41,610
what's up there rocks?
How are you going to the ocean?

3488
02:33:41,950 --> 02:33:46,950
Fucking sharks,
clams and crabs and eels and weird 

3489
02:33:47,141 --> 02:33:50,650
fucking things that have fishing rods 
grown out of their heads,

3490
02:33:51,150 --> 02:33:54,580
trick and fish and opening their mouth 
up like some cartoon,

3491
02:33:54,581 --> 02:33:59,581
Monster Fish in space with monsters that
world's way.

3492
02:34:00,731 --> 02:34:03,660
Crazier spaces,
stupid spaces.

3493
02:34:04,210 --> 02:34:06,220
We've been waiting those flat every 
night.

3494
02:34:06,221 --> 02:34:08,590
No flying saucers.
That's just infinity.

3495
02:34:09,100 --> 02:34:10,750
Go that ocean.
That's how.

3496
02:34:10,900 --> 02:34:13,420
That's the fucking the wildest world out
there,

3497
02:34:13,421 --> 02:34:15,280
man.
That's so true that they said there were

3498
02:34:15,281 --> 02:34:17,950
monsters like just the just 20,000
a few

3499
02:34:19,900 --> 02:34:23,480
killer whales in the clouds.
How fucking popular.

3500
02:34:23,560 --> 02:34:26,440
See where it would be.
Killer whales,

3501
02:34:26,450 --> 02:34:31,450
mccloud's.
Blame your own playing like that would 

3502
02:34:31,450 --> 02:34:36,220
be fucking amazing.
Could you imagine if you had to go to 

3503
02:34:36,220 --> 02:34:38,881
space to see like con doors.
You get up there and you'd see that 

3504
02:34:39,610 --> 02:34:42,670
fucking bird and they wanted to hit on.
You only exist in space.

3505
02:34:42,671 --> 02:34:45,160
You'd have to go see him in space.
You would appreciate them way more.

3506
02:34:46,840 --> 02:34:49,260
Way more than birds down here.
Whereas down here,

3507
02:34:49,270 --> 02:34:50,970
bullshit.
Give a fuck.

3508
02:34:50,971 --> 02:34:54,280
If you see a duck will not pulling the 
car over for ducks.

3509
02:34:56,940 --> 02:35:00,400
Ducks in space.
They are the craziest things ever.

3510
02:35:01,020 --> 02:35:03,180
If were on the moon,
they were like,

3511
02:35:03,310 --> 02:35:08,310
get the fuck here.
This on the goddamn ducks at the park.

3512
02:35:08,410 --> 02:35:10,990
We can go feed them.
They wait for people to throw bread.

3513
02:35:11,020 --> 02:35:12,670
Adam,
who gives a fuck if they're in space.

3514
02:35:13,080 --> 02:35:16,630
It's like something in spaces.
Makes it way cooler.

3515
02:35:16,810 --> 02:35:19,240
If you found some naked retard on the 
moon,

3516
02:35:19,241 --> 02:35:23,020
you'd be like,
there's a Guy lemme get retarded though.

3517
02:35:24,560 --> 02:35:25,390
You're like,
oh,

3518
02:35:25,391 --> 02:35:27,310
it's from bucket space.
He slept there.

3519
02:35:27,320 --> 02:35:32,290
Welcome to the moon quiz.
He's probably jerking off at the camera.

3520
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:35,800
We find intelligent life.
I use sure.

3521
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:39,350
You got a guy who's beaten off on the 
moon camera.

3522
02:35:39,560 --> 02:35:44,560
We were so excited.
We found that he is trying to 

3523
02:35:44,560 --> 02:35:49,381
communicate.
We're trying to give him the benefit of 

3524
02:35:49,381 --> 02:35:50,050
the doubt because all the years of 
loneliness and madness alone,

3525
02:35:50,051 --> 02:35:55,051
beating off on the moon.
He didn't understand how inappropriate 

3526
02:35:55,051 --> 02:35:55,051
it was and our culture.

3527
02:35:55,051 --> 02:35:58,010
We cannot expect him,
the crazy man on the moon to have our,

3528
02:35:58,060 --> 02:36:03,060
our ethics and our look at the world.
That guy would be so many miles.

3529
02:36:03,311 --> 02:36:08,311
It's just there's a million of those 
guys in insane asylums all across the 

3530
02:36:08,311 --> 02:36:08,311
country.
We're not.

3531
02:36:08,311 --> 02:36:08,311
We don't appreciate them.
You're in there.

3532
02:36:08,350 --> 02:36:11,500
Then that room got a cage.
Not that big a deal,

3533
02:36:11,830 --> 02:36:15,910
but if that guy is jerking off and the 
nurses face on the moon,

3534
02:36:16,150 --> 02:36:18,990
it was just him and the nurse on the 
moon and then you see him.

3535
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:20,620
He's holding her down,
jerking off in her face,

3536
02:36:20,621 --> 02:36:22,040
like,
what the fuck is going on?

3537
02:36:22,041 --> 02:36:22,840
On the moon?

3538
02:36:24,740 --> 02:36:29,270
Insane asylum on the moon.
It sounds like a movie should be.

3539
02:36:29,510 --> 02:36:31,100
Should it be rob Zombie's next film.

3540
02:36:35,530 --> 02:36:36,430
Ah.

3541
02:36:36,660 --> 02:36:41,660
Why did you a so much about joe?
He doesn't dream because you said you 

3542
02:36:41,660 --> 02:36:42,750
said two separate occasions.

3543
02:36:43,430 --> 02:36:44,510
Shit,
when I'm not around.

3544
02:36:44,950 --> 02:36:49,060
And then tell me a distorted version is

3545
02:36:49,160 --> 02:36:51,230
you're a old cat still alive.
Josef.

3546
02:36:51,430 --> 02:36:53,340
I'm,
I think this might be the,

3547
02:36:53,440 --> 02:36:55,760
the week it's a day by day.
I'm like,

3548
02:36:56,100 --> 02:36:57,530
you know,
I'm going to let you live one more day.

3549
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:59,990
You know,
it's just getting too bad.

3550
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:03,110
She's too old in a micro school.
Right.

3551
02:37:03,111 --> 02:37:05,990
She can't see good anymore.
She's 19 now.

3552
02:37:06,360 --> 02:37:07,380
He.
Yeah.

3553
02:37:07,670 --> 02:37:08,930
So she,
um,

3554
02:37:09,210 --> 02:37:11,540
she can still hop up on the couch and 
she still does.

3555
02:37:11,541 --> 02:37:13,710
She fall down like my shit falling a 
lot.

3556
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:14,810
Yeah,
she falls.

3557
02:37:15,050 --> 02:37:20,050
We used to have her food,
like it was like on this little counter 

3558
02:37:20,050 --> 02:37:20,050
area.
She would jump up to it,

3559
02:37:20,050 --> 02:37:21,860
but now she's slipped a couple times and
sad,

3560
02:37:21,920 --> 02:37:25,250
sad to watch her slip.
When is it the point where you're like,

3561
02:37:25,540 --> 02:37:27,500
all right,
when she's on pain and pain,

3562
02:37:27,501 --> 02:37:29,510
how do we know we're not pain?
I don't know.

3563
02:37:29,511 --> 02:37:31,760
She might be,
but when I feel like she's miserable,

3564
02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:35,330
you know,
I don't want her to just slowly die.

3565
02:37:35,330 --> 02:37:37,670
If you could put her asleep,
it's probably more humane.

3566
02:37:37,730 --> 02:37:42,730
I was.
I've been like looking at her and she 

3567
02:37:42,730 --> 02:37:44,501
sleeps about 99% of her life now in 
about the same age,

3568
02:37:45,450 --> 02:37:47,750
about 17,
something like that.

3569
02:37:48,080 --> 02:37:48,630
Uh,
but,

3570
02:37:48,740 --> 02:37:49,790
but when,
uh,

3571
02:37:49,850 --> 02:37:52,130
when she does it a way in which he is 
awake,

3572
02:37:52,340 --> 02:37:57,340
she's puking a,
she can barely pay in the litter box 

3573
02:37:57,340 --> 02:37:57,530
anymore,
you know,

3574
02:37:57,531 --> 02:37:59,810
she's just going right outside of it or 
something like that.

3575
02:38:00,170 --> 02:38:02,170
And uh,
it's just like if she,

3576
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:04,760
she in pain,
they get dementia.

3577
02:38:04,830 --> 02:38:06,410
Yeah.
The little a kitty,

3578
02:38:06,411 --> 02:38:07,400
cat,
Alzheimer's,

3579
02:38:07,401 --> 02:38:07,810
you know,
they,

3580
02:38:07,820 --> 02:38:10,040
they meow in the middle of the night.
So how.

3581
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:11,570
Yeah,
that's really bad now.

3582
02:38:11,630 --> 02:38:12,500
Yeah.
My cat,

3583
02:38:12,501 --> 02:38:17,501
she picks up my daughter's shoes,
like my daughter has like these uggs 

3584
02:38:17,501 --> 02:38:18,890
soft shoe.
She picks him up and carries them in her

3585
02:38:18,891 --> 02:38:20,960
mouth and while she's carrying them in 
her mouth,

3586
02:38:20,961 --> 02:38:25,930
she's going,
it's weird politics.

3587
02:38:26,010 --> 02:38:27,830
It's a kitten.
I don't know what she.

3588
02:38:27,870 --> 02:38:29,350
She never had kittens.
You know what I mean?

3589
02:38:29,360 --> 02:38:31,730
Maybe she's going mad because she never 
had babies.

3590
02:38:32,030 --> 02:38:34,040
And here's a question for you.
When this happens,

3591
02:38:34,041 --> 02:38:35,760
do you.
I've never had to deal with this arc.

3592
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:37,070
I didn't even think of that.
Do you?

3593
02:38:37,100 --> 02:38:42,100
Do you,
do you have to go to shoot or you go to 

3594
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:42,100
the vet,
whoever put asleep a war,

3595
02:38:42,100 --> 02:38:46,950
do you think it's cooler to like just go
to like a nice field and just let her 

3596
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:46,950
just be like,
look,

3597
02:38:46,950 --> 02:38:47,940
you know,
good luck Brian.

3598
02:38:47,950 --> 02:38:49,540
No,
Brian,

3599
02:38:50,040 --> 02:38:52,580
why would you say that?
Because it's so she's going to starve to

3600
02:38:52,581 --> 02:38:57,581
death.
I feel like it's like I'm getting my 

3601
02:38:57,581 --> 02:38:57,581
like it's either going,
hey,

3602
02:38:57,581 --> 02:38:57,930
I remembered gift.
Chill.

3603
02:38:58,280 --> 02:39:03,280
You're going to go onto the chair,
like you're going to go into electric 

3604
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:04,130
chair or we're leaving the door open.

3605
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:08,480
Prison doors though my shot,
they give him a shot,

3606
02:39:08,500 --> 02:39:12,550
but within moments of electric they 
give.

3607
02:39:12,560 --> 02:39:17,560
The cat is shot and they're dead within 
moments where they do the ivy and 

3608
02:39:17,560 --> 02:39:17,600
they're dead.
Within moments you do.

3609
02:39:17,620 --> 02:39:22,620
Here's what you do.
Schedule an appointment to put her down 

3610
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:22,620
tomorrow.
She'll start acting 100%.

3611
02:39:22,620 --> 02:39:24,650
As soon as you schedule that appointment
anytime.

3612
02:39:24,690 --> 02:39:27,380
Anytime you have to put it on an animal 
today you go,

3613
02:39:27,381 --> 02:39:28,580
alright.
Here it goes there.

3614
02:39:28,581 --> 02:39:29,570
Totally perfect.
Like,

3615
02:39:30,640 --> 02:39:35,640
well she's probably,
my cat is probably a little healthier 

3616
02:39:35,640 --> 02:39:35,940
than yours because she still gets around
and you know,

3617
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:41,080
she sleeps a lot,
but she comes over to me and she wants 

3618
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:41,090
to get pet,
but she sounds like she's like,

3619
02:39:41,091 --> 02:39:43,220
oh,
voice sounds Kathy.

3620
02:39:43,830 --> 02:39:45,600
Susan sound happy.
It's like a squawk.

3621
02:39:46,070 --> 02:39:48,440
You know,
she's 19 years old,

3622
02:39:48,441 --> 02:39:50,210
man for cats.
That's a long ass time.

3623
02:39:50,660 --> 02:39:52,580
I can't live with me and the other side 
of the world.

3624
02:39:53,090 --> 02:39:58,090
Is there like some stupid law that you 
have to hold your cat when they put put 

3625
02:39:58,090 --> 02:39:58,090
it to sleep?
No,

3626
02:39:58,090 --> 02:39:58,510
no,
no.

3627
02:39:59,740 --> 02:40:00,260
Oh,
you do?

3628
02:40:00,470 --> 02:40:00,890
Okay,
cool.

3629
02:40:00,891 --> 02:40:01,400
Can you just.
Yeah,

3630
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:03,990
that's called love of having a heart.
No,

3631
02:40:04,020 --> 02:40:06,050
it wasn't.
You can't just like hand it in a box,

3632
02:40:06,051 --> 02:40:07,190
but I'm done with it.
Yeah.

3633
02:40:07,370 --> 02:40:08,210
Well,
you're going to want,

3634
02:40:08,211 --> 02:40:09,530
trust me.
You're going to want to be there.

3635
02:40:09,550 --> 02:40:12,230
You pay extra for that or for them to 
come to your house and do it.

3636
02:40:12,231 --> 02:40:14,060
I was there for a puppy that had this

3637
02:40:14,060 --> 02:40:15,240
temporary,
uh,

3638
02:40:15,241 --> 02:40:17,190
we got it from this guy,
um,

3639
02:40:17,240 --> 02:40:21,810
I can kinda from callan was callan's 
friend and um,

3640
02:40:22,440 --> 02:40:24,960
it had distemper and it started having 
seizures.

3641
02:40:25,140 --> 02:40:27,780
It was awful.
It was awful.

3642
02:40:27,810 --> 02:40:32,810
And then there's like this not in the 
seizures kept coming more and more 

3643
02:40:32,810 --> 02:40:34,590
frequent and his dog would just lock up 
the agony and the doctor was like,

3644
02:40:34,591 --> 02:40:37,440
you know,
there's really no hope at this stage.

3645
02:40:37,441 --> 02:40:37,850
And I'm like,
oh,

3646
02:40:37,860 --> 02:40:39,690
I can't believe this.
Like the moment we got him,

3647
02:40:39,691 --> 02:40:42,390
he's really cute too.
And uh,

3648
02:40:42,480 --> 02:40:43,770
that was,
it was hard man,

3649
02:40:43,771 --> 02:40:46,650
because the doctor was crying.
I'm like,

3650
02:40:46,710 --> 02:40:47,980
yeah,
we held the,

3651
02:40:48,590 --> 02:40:51,270
held onto the puppy.
He gives the puppy this shot and it just

3652
02:40:51,530 --> 02:40:53,160
goes stiff.
I was there through the whole thing.

3653
02:40:53,630 --> 02:40:54,780
Go stiff,
man.

3654
02:40:54,790 --> 02:40:55,500
It's just,
uh,

3655
02:40:55,501 --> 02:40:57,270
I mean just went limp rather,
you know.

3656
02:40:58,140 --> 02:40:59,850
And um,
yeah,

3657
02:40:59,851 --> 02:41:00,810
it's hard to watch man.

3658
02:41:01,080 --> 02:41:03,150
And the,
I'm the guy who's like,

3659
02:41:03,151 --> 02:41:05,190
I've talked about him before.
His name is Dr.

3660
02:41:05,190 --> 02:41:05,970
Craig.
He was cool,

3661
02:41:05,990 --> 02:41:07,610
like a really cool guy.
He died,

3662
02:41:07,611 --> 02:41:12,611
were killed by a drunk driver man.
Somebody slammed into him one day I got 

3663
02:41:12,611 --> 02:41:17,571
an email or something about it might 
have been an actual physical mail 

3664
02:41:17,571 --> 02:41:21,501
because it was quite awhile ago and I 
was so bummed out because they cared 

3665
02:41:21,501 --> 02:41:25,041
about animals so much.
He had been around so many animals that 

3666
02:41:25,041 --> 02:41:27,591
had to get put to sleep.
But when that puppy died and I was 

3667
02:41:27,591 --> 02:41:27,750
crying,
he started crying too.

3668
02:41:27,751 --> 02:41:29,280
Man,
he's a doctor,

3669
02:41:30,020 --> 02:41:31,500
you know,
it's like,

3670
02:41:31,501 --> 02:41:33,780
it's the hardest part of my job because 
I love being able to say.

3671
02:41:33,800 --> 02:41:38,800
But he had like fucking 15 dogs,
like the guy who loved animals hit a 

3672
02:41:38,800 --> 02:41:40,140
bunch of cats,
a bunch of dogs,

3673
02:41:40,141 --> 02:41:42,960
you know,
who's just a sweetheart of a guy man.

3674
02:41:44,440 --> 02:41:47,730
Sad shit tonight.
Everybody take it easy on the podcast.

3675
02:41:52,760 --> 02:41:57,760
Yeah,
we've been fighting that with Chris or 

3676
02:41:57,760 --> 02:41:59,711
my dog at home too.
But she's had five knee surgeries.

3677
02:41:59,901 --> 02:42:01,130
My God,
five.

3678
02:42:01,131 --> 02:42:03,890
Now we're getting the big one,
the knee replacement.

3679
02:42:04,040 --> 02:42:05,410
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.

3680
02:42:05,600 --> 02:42:10,600
What's wrong with her?
Why is she purebred purebred into 

3681
02:42:10,600 --> 02:42:14,660
overbred interbreeding and she had a 
torn acl and acl.

3682
02:42:14,850 --> 02:42:16,160
I,
sweet dog like that.

3683
02:42:16,880 --> 02:42:18,860
She had both are acl replaced.
She's had both.

3684
02:42:18,861 --> 02:42:22,970
Are acl done twice and she's had her 
knees kneecaps put back in place.

3685
02:42:23,520 --> 02:42:27,410
Degenerative Degenerative kneecaps and 
now and the one leg,

3686
02:42:27,411 --> 02:42:31,430
her right leg just never really healed.
So we went in and we went to therapy and

3687
02:42:31,431 --> 02:42:32,210
they're like,
look,

3688
02:42:32,211 --> 02:42:34,760
uh,
there is no cartilage in there.

3689
02:42:34,761 --> 02:42:39,761
The only thing was possible was the knee
replacement or we cut the leg off or we 

3690
02:42:39,761 --> 02:42:40,790
just leave it as she drags it.
And uh,

3691
02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:42,770
and I was just in the place where I was 
like,

3692
02:42:43,070 --> 02:42:48,070
I was like,
I'm ready to pay so much fucking money 

3693
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:48,070
for this dog.
Get the fucking new knee.

3694
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:51,620
Did you talk to a knee replacement?
They think there's any light on the 

3695
02:42:52,221 --> 02:42:52,790
horizon.

3696
02:42:53,620 --> 02:42:56,420
80%,
80% chance that it's going to be fine.

3697
02:42:56,450 --> 02:42:59,460
I think they put that out of all the 
cases of knee replacements,

3698
02:42:59,461 --> 02:43:00,990
but it's only been around for a couple 
of years,

3699
02:43:01,320 --> 02:43:03,270
so they're getting better at it 
obviously,

3700
02:43:03,480 --> 02:43:08,480
but just to be able to give this dog and
opportunity to run and chase play and 

3701
02:43:08,480 --> 02:43:10,170
just play other than sit on the couch 
and like,

3702
02:43:10,171 --> 02:43:11,040
you know,
come up and get.

3703
02:43:11,350 --> 02:43:12,000
I mean it gets love

3704
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:12,850
all the time,
but.

3705
02:43:13,290 --> 02:43:18,290
So yeah,
I've seen those ones that doing for 

3706
02:43:18,290 --> 02:43:21,511
people now,
they showed there was an animated 

3707
02:43:21,511 --> 02:43:23,320
version of the operation online or doing
a full knee replacement.

3708
02:43:23,350 --> 02:43:26,860
It's fucking crazy.
You're watching just going like,

3709
02:43:27,380 --> 02:43:32,380
what's crazy?
Soften your knee off and putting this 

3710
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:36,901
new piece,
a new piece of equipment that's like on 

3711
02:43:36,901 --> 02:43:37,110
a,
you know,

3712
02:43:37,111 --> 02:43:42,111
a groove and socket sorta set up and 
you're watching this whole thing that 

3713
02:43:42,111 --> 02:43:44,080
screws into place and like,
what the fuck man?

3714
02:43:45,220 --> 02:43:48,760
We're making bionic knees.
Yeah.

3715
02:43:49,530 --> 02:43:51,740
But I guess for people that have it,
man,

3716
02:43:51,850 --> 02:43:54,640
it's a huge pain relief for people that 
are like,

3717
02:43:54,641 --> 02:43:59,641
some people have degenerative diseases 
of their joints and it just gets to the 

3718
02:43:59,641 --> 02:43:59,641
point where there's nothing they could 
do about it.

3719
02:43:59,710 --> 02:44:01,540
They're just like rouse,
like,

3720
02:44:01,541 --> 02:44:02,670
you know Sean Rouse.
I did.

3721
02:44:02,690 --> 02:44:04,020
I just hit them up this week.
I want to.

3722
02:44:04,060 --> 02:44:05,230
I love.
He's so funny.

3723
02:44:05,231 --> 02:44:07,780
He's hilarious.
He's such a talented comedian.

3724
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:09,190
Very,
very funny dude.

3725
02:44:09,191 --> 02:44:11,740
And he has a very extreme case of 
arthritis,

3726
02:44:12,070 --> 02:44:14,170
whereas I guess it's called a rheumatoid
arthritis,

3727
02:44:14,171 --> 02:44:17,020
but very extreme.
Whereas his hands and his knees and like

3728
02:44:17,021 --> 02:44:18,200
he's always an agony.
And I,

3729
02:44:18,201 --> 02:44:20,370
I know he's had some,
I think he's had some,

3730
02:44:20,430 --> 02:44:22,160
he just got new knees or something like 
that.

3731
02:44:22,190 --> 02:44:24,020
So I believe Russell Peters bottle 
before.

3732
02:44:24,580 --> 02:44:27,710
Wow.
That sounds like Russell Russell's spine

3733
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:32,790
knees to go by.
My dog's name will rouse really funny 

3734
02:44:32,790 --> 02:44:34,170
fucking comic man.
Really Fun.

3735
02:44:34,360 --> 02:44:38,290
Really talented.
A fucking beyond talented comic.

3736
02:44:38,890 --> 02:44:39,660
Yeah,
it's,

3737
02:44:39,730 --> 02:44:42,310
it's sad when you see shit like that and
you just don't know what,

3738
02:44:42,660 --> 02:44:43,600
what is it?
I mean,

3739
02:44:43,620 --> 02:44:44,410
could they fix it?
Well,

3740
02:44:44,580 --> 02:44:48,610
what's the solution like?
There's gotta be a way to improve that,

3741
02:44:49,500 --> 02:44:52,960
that that's,
that's the beautiful thing about medical

3742
02:44:52,961 --> 02:44:57,961
science is that they look at a situation
like that and they slowly but surely 

3743
02:44:57,961 --> 02:45:00,840
chip away at all the different ways to 
fix the problem.

3744
02:45:00,860 --> 02:45:05,860
Like every day they're coming up with 
all these new methods for dealing with 

3745
02:45:05,860 --> 02:45:07,930
things that were almost insurmountable 
just a little while ago.

3746
02:45:08,250 --> 02:45:12,610
Like they got this doctor in Germany 
that's replacing people's discs now.

3747
02:45:12,790 --> 02:45:17,790
I've heard of quite a few people going 
there and I talked to a doctor about it 

3748
02:45:17,790 --> 02:45:20,140
and he explained to me that there are 
certain,

3749
02:45:20,540 --> 02:45:23,650
um,
artificial discs that they've created in

3750
02:45:23,651 --> 02:45:25,480
Germany that,
you know,

3751
02:45:25,510 --> 02:45:27,940
for people that have neck injuries or 
back injuries,

3752
02:45:28,120 --> 02:45:30,130
a lot of times they get their discs 
fused.

3753
02:45:30,340 --> 02:45:33,010
And what that means is they take your 
two bones of your desk,

3754
02:45:33,011 --> 02:45:35,770
they remove all the,
the jail that separate.

3755
02:45:35,771 --> 02:45:40,771
So they cut it all away and they put the
two bones together and they screw them 

3756
02:45:40,771 --> 02:45:43,750
into each other.
So now you only have the degeneration of

3757
02:45:43,751 --> 02:45:47,780
the disc above it and the disc below it,
you have one giant fat disks.

3758
02:45:47,780 --> 02:45:52,780
It doesn't move that well,
so you just can't go like all the way 

3759
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:52,780
back,
fucks with your movement.

3760
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:53,860
It fucks with your mobility for some 
people.

3761
02:45:53,861 --> 02:45:56,980
But for some people that's a significant
like release of pain.

3762
02:45:57,770 --> 02:46:00,070
And so then they came out with these 
spacers.

3763
02:46:00,390 --> 02:46:03,400
They had these space.
Are they used in replacement of a desk?

3764
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:08,820
I believe that that's what the,
the operation they did that Tito Ortiz 

3765
02:46:08,820 --> 02:46:11,671
and they explained it on the UFC.
They showed like the doctor came and 

3766
02:46:11,671 --> 02:46:11,710
showed this space or this plastic 
spacer.

3767
02:46:12,140 --> 02:46:16,610
But what they figured out now in Germany
is like this articulating sort of moving

3768
02:46:16,611 --> 02:46:20,090
joint almost.
And they're putting in people's necks.

3769
02:46:20,390 --> 02:46:23,150
I know Braulio esteem got one of those,
uh,

3770
02:46:23,151 --> 02:46:26,780
I don't know if the same thing,
but he's a world famous Jujitsu champion

3771
02:46:27,140 --> 02:46:30,530
who had a significant neck injury.
He had his disc replacement,

3772
02:46:30,531 --> 02:46:34,850
artificial disc and talked about it and 
how much of a benefit it was to him.

3773
02:46:35,120 --> 02:46:40,120
So these guys are getting these discs 
like where they were like really fucked 

3774
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:40,380
up before.
And uh,

3775
02:46:40,400 --> 02:46:45,380
this one guy's a skier and he was fucked
up before and he's had like two or three

3776
02:46:45,410 --> 02:46:49,430
discs replaced with these artificial 
disc and now he's like skiing again.

3777
02:46:49,440 --> 02:46:51,530
It feels great and I'm like,
that's crazy.

3778
02:46:51,531 --> 02:46:54,320
Like they're putting like robot disks in
people.

3779
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:55,630
Oh,
I love,

3780
02:46:55,650 --> 02:46:58,060
I have a bad neck problems and shoulder 
problems.

3781
02:46:58,270 --> 02:47:00,640
What's your issues?
I have no fucking clue.

3782
02:47:00,641 --> 02:47:02,330
I have no idea.
Oh,

3783
02:47:02,331 --> 02:47:04,750
nothing.
Just 150 miles an hour under the side of

3784
02:47:04,751 --> 02:47:06,460
a mountain in Vegas I think.
Yeah,

3785
02:47:06,461 --> 02:47:08,320
I think that might have something to do 
with it.

3786
02:47:08,350 --> 02:47:11,980
Fuck there.
I get it goes from my elbow to my.

3787
02:47:12,170 --> 02:47:17,170
I told you about that.
I was worried I was going to deal with 

3788
02:47:17,170 --> 02:47:17,170
what Bas rutten's dylan with.
Yeah.

3789
02:47:17,170 --> 02:47:18,940
But he gets it from Emma and I got on it
actually

3790
02:47:19,240 --> 02:47:24,240
bus route and had like a few neck 
problems from Emma and from Jiu Jitsu 

3791
02:47:24,240 --> 02:47:28,260
kickboxing.
But the big one happened to him during 

3792
02:47:28,260 --> 02:47:30,541
stunt work.
He was doing an episode of sons of 

3793
02:47:30,541 --> 02:47:32,700
anarchy and he got dropped on his head 
and it fucked his neck up like that.

3794
02:47:32,710 --> 02:47:36,460
That like really fucked up and that's 
when he had to get his dis fused and all

3795
02:47:36,461 --> 02:47:38,960
that jazz.
So it wasn't even like Emma.

3796
02:47:39,150 --> 02:47:42,280
It was like doing stunt work style Orvis
hard fucking work,

3797
02:47:42,281 --> 02:47:47,281
man.
Those guys at ride those bowls all the 

3798
02:47:47,281 --> 02:47:47,281
time.
Those guys,

3799
02:47:47,281 --> 02:47:49,780
I mean people that are at Rodeo clowns 
like there's some hard workout there.

3800
02:47:49,930 --> 02:47:50,560
Oh yeah.
Dude.

3801
02:47:50,561 --> 02:47:52,720
You just in the same category.
You know,

3802
02:47:52,890 --> 02:47:54,970
there are a lot of men that are out 
there that are just fearless.

3803
02:47:54,971 --> 02:47:57,010
I could never.
I mean I guess I do do it a little bit,

3804
02:47:57,011 --> 02:48:02,011
but to.
I've seen stuntmen do ridiculous shit 

3805
02:48:02,011 --> 02:48:03,880
and movies.
You watch some of those making of movies

3806
02:48:03,881 --> 02:48:08,881
when you see like car accidents.
He stopped going to have to do our 

3807
02:48:08,881 --> 02:48:08,881
motorcycle wrecks,
have to lay down bikes and I'm like,

3808
02:48:09,250 --> 02:48:12,070
she needs to Christ all for some shitty 
mood.

3809
02:48:12,110 --> 02:48:17,110
Laydown bikes is the scary ones.
You don't know what's gonna happen with 

3810
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:17,110
it.
Like we've done,

3811
02:48:17,110 --> 02:48:21,210
we've done spin outs in cars where we've
had cars come and hit us and spin us 

3812
02:48:21,210 --> 02:48:21,220
out.
But ultimately,

3813
02:48:21,221 --> 02:48:23,020
you know,
it's not gonna flip laying down a bike.

3814
02:48:23,050 --> 02:48:25,670
I saw one in anchorman the other day,
jacked by black,

3815
02:48:25,671 --> 02:48:30,671
supposed to do it,
but the bike fucking caught and started 

3816
02:48:30,671 --> 02:48:30,671
flipping crazy.

3817
02:48:30,671 --> 02:48:31,930
Do I bet that was one fucking stuck and 
lost his shit.

3818
02:48:32,050 --> 02:48:33,790
Yeah.
If he didn't lose his shit,

3819
02:48:33,791 --> 02:48:38,791
he's a better man than I am.
Somebody dying at Steven Seagal movie 

3820
02:48:38,791 --> 02:48:42,100
was making a Steven Seagal movie died 
some sort of a wreck.

3821
02:48:42,520 --> 02:48:46,960
Like imagine if he'd died for one of 
those trade shows.

3822
02:48:47,170 --> 02:48:50,230
The end ones that not like the early 
ones either.

3823
02:48:50,231 --> 02:48:54,610
It's not like above the law,
but the law was bad ass.

3824
02:48:54,700 --> 02:48:56,740
To this day I still enjoy blah,
blah blah.

3825
02:48:56,770 --> 02:48:59,320
That comes on fun.
Stupid movie.

3826
02:48:59,670 --> 02:49:02,170
The one where he's the.
He's the cook in the navy.

3827
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:04,390
No,
that was definitely a good one.

3828
02:49:04,391 --> 02:49:06,150
That's a good one here in a few good 
ones,

3829
02:49:06,170 --> 02:49:08,100
but ship one that was

3830
02:49:08,100 --> 02:49:12,950
a good one under to understand is pretty
good.

3831
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:14,390
This ship one?
Yeah.

3832
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:18,170
My Buddy Mike Star was on one of those

3833
02:49:18,171 --> 02:49:20,990

just regular actor to.

3837
02:49:28,881 --> 02:49:33,881
It wasn't even a stunt guy,
but you're getting your chest lit up by 

3838
02:49:33,881 --> 02:49:33,881

Who knows how to punch you.

3840
02:49:35,200 --> 02:49:37,040
He's big.
He's a big fucker.

3841
02:49:37,580 --> 02:49:39,410

02:49:56,421 --> 02:49:58,580
See it's not automatically and that's 
enough.

3851
02:49:59,590 --> 02:50:04,590
I'm his sister.
Katie Sagal wasn't married with 

3852
02:50:04,590 --> 02:50:04,590
children.
Oh really?

3853

I'm looking at you and sister Jamie.

3858
02:50:21,980 --> 02:50:25,910
You're just a white dress.
Gold looking motherfucker today.

3859
02:50:25,911 --> 02:50:29,480
Aren't you going to stick to this?

3860
02:50:30,930 --> 02:50:33,660

3861
02:50:34,460 --> 02:50:35,470
D then

3862
02:50:36,360 --> 02:50:38,100
I'm on burnside.
Steven,

3863
02:50:38,850 --> 02:50:43,510
how you believe that their son is Jason 
Segel.

3864
02:50:44,480 --> 02:50:46,340
What does it say?
Relatives.

3865
02:50:46,830 --> 02:50:47,780
Jeans.
Here we go.

3866
02:50:47,990 --> 02:50:49,910
She changed her.
Is that her name?

3867
02:50:49,930 --> 02:50:52,950
White Gold.
That's her

3868
02:50:54,750 --> 02:50:55,370
not.
No,

3869
02:50:55,371 --> 02:50:57,020
she.
This is keeping Steven off there because

3870
02:50:57,021 --> 02:51:01,770
she's embarrassed.
She felt totally different.

3871
02:51:01,771 --> 02:51:05,220
Now Steven Seagal and gall or fucking 
brother's sister.

3872
02:51:05,600 --> 02:51:08,280
Play through some data.
So a Steven Seagal is website.

3873
02:51:08,281 --> 02:51:11,710
She's not proud of it.
The way a trucking the grocery products.

3874
02:51:11,930 --> 02:51:14,390
Steven Seagal made of a bunch of shit 
about being a navy seal.

3875
02:51:14,510 --> 02:51:17,030
Why wouldn't he make up a bunch of shit 
about this?

3876
02:51:18,920 --> 02:51:23,920
Didn't he?
Didn't even do some like special ops 

3877
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:23,920
world.

3878

02:51:28,811 --> 02:51:32,170
Younger brother too.
The more famous Katey Sagal.

3883
02:51:32,410 --> 02:51:34,650
Come on.
Was that on fucking Bob's website?

Hold on.
The guy's legit martial artists.

3886
02:51:46,310 --> 02:51:48,080
Hey look,

3887
02:51:48,170 --> 02:51:52,780
You fuck son of a bitch.
You son of a bitch.

3888
02:51:52,810 --> 02:51:57,810
Just ruin the story in my head because 
I'm not hearing you so much more are not

3889
02:51:58,180 --> 02:51:59,940
relay.
You survive.

3890
02:51:59,950 --> 02:52:02,110
It's spelled the same.
It's ruined it for me though.

3891
02:52:02,120 --> 02:52:04,480
Fuck you guys.
I always had an interesting story.

3892
02:52:04,481 --> 02:52:06,130
I've been growing together or your view

3893
02:52:06,130 --> 02:52:08,060
of reality is quite rigid.
Look,

3894
02:52:08,110 --> 02:52:11,520
Steven Seagal is a fine gentleman and 
excellent martial artists case ago.

3895
02:52:11,620 --> 02:52:16,560
A fine actor in her own right.
You have their name with you.

3896
02:52:16,700 --> 02:52:20,220
Horrible.
You were so committed to that rumor.

3897
02:52:20,480 --> 02:52:25,480
I want to know the truth.
I haven't had been holding that in my 

3898
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:28,051
head for fucking years and being like 
the fascinating that they both kind of 

3899
02:52:28,051 --> 02:52:32,161
took different angles in the business.
They don't even look like what would 

3900
02:52:32,161 --> 02:52:32,800
have taken was a simple google search.
You just weren't willing to do it,

3901
02:52:32,801 --> 02:52:34,220
but you were willing to get on this 
podcast,

3902
02:52:34,280 --> 02:52:36,600
argue to the fucking death.
I believe in faith.

3903
02:52:36,970 --> 02:52:39,370
I believe in faith.
You got to have faith.

3904
02:52:39,371 --> 02:52:41,510
I heard from George Michael's and Fred 
durst.

3905
