1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,450
Mm,

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,250
first of all,
Mr Ventura,

3
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:10,950
I'm a big fan,
but I'm a bigger fan now that I know

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:13,470
that you're pro fanny pack.
This is huge for me.

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,770
I've been trying to bring back the fanny
pack for years.

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,550
I've been nothing but ridicule James.
I sent my way.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,180
I find that strange because I'm a huge
fan.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,210
I care.
I have one locked in my hotel right now

9
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:29,490
in the safe.
You know you gave because they give you

10
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:33,090
them little safes in the room.
Well I carry my passport in it.

11
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,370
I carry the things that I need to
travel.

12
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,890
If I'm doing airline travel,
my schedules,

13
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,720
I carry two sets of reading glasses.
I carry my sunglasses.

14
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,170
What could be better than a fanny pack
to carry all that sucker.

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,710
I don't have the,
you know,

16
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,350
I tend to wear my pants a little tight
and I can't put things in the pocket.

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,270
Things break when they get in the
pocket.

18
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:00,000
No,
I'm a huge fanny pack advocate.

19
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,700
I,
I've warned them now for 20 years I've

20
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,750
had them.
Me Too.

21
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,910
And now you have one of ours.
Yup.

22
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,790
Happy to take it.
Thank you.

23
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:09,270
Thank you.
I'm honored.

24
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,190
It's a superior carriers stuff and I'll
put it to use.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,191
Thank you.
Well,

26
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:17,820
and I also,
I've stated this in Minnesota,

27
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:22,290
I have legit conceal and carry where I
can carry a weapon.

28
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,330
Right.
Where do you think I carry it in your

29
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:25,760
fanny pack?
Well,

30
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,160
they make fanny pack specifically that
Velcro open instantaneously.

31
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,750
They.
They pop right open.

32
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:31,900
Yep.
Well if I'm,

33
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,460
if I'm not wearing my shoulder holster,
it's in my fanny pack.

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,800
Do you mean how does that work?
Do you.

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,690
You're only allowed to conceal carry in
Minnesota and if he goes state?

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,430
No,
no.

37
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,430
Many of the states now are honoring the
others.

38
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,670
I say you got to check though,
but generally speaking,

39
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,330
if you can shoot pretty much across the
country now for most part,

40
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:55,230
if you have a legitimate conceal and
carry in your home state,

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,070
the other states will likewise honor it,
but you can't go to the airport with it.

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,620
Right?
Of course you can't do anything like

43
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,670
that with a judith to be driving.
That's one of those subjects were much

44
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:08,160
like the subject of your book marijuana
manifesto.

45
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,280
It's one of those subjects where as soon
as you bring up that subject,

46
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,910
concealed carry,
people just go,

47
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,490
oh,
well,

48
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,280
it's interesting because it's,
it's.

49
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,870
I help shepherd the law through when I
was governor in Minnesota because,

50
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,610
uh,
I was mayor of Brooklyn Park first and I

51
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:30,540
went to my police chief to get conceal
and carry and he denied me.

52
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,120
I was the mayor.
How could he deny it?

53
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,310
Because it was up to police chiefs.
But why says he don't like it?

54
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,250
Oh,
we just didn't like it and you didn't

55
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,840
like it.
And so I sat back and thought,

56
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:44,610
wait a minute,
this is ridiculous.

57
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,250
A police chief shouldn't have that
power.

58
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,640
It should be uniformally.
Yeah.

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,600
Shall issue if you're qualified.
It shouldn't be left up to him because

60
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,200
like in Minnesota,
if you lived in northern Minnesota,

61
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,610
the rural north,
you could get a concealed carry,

62
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,550
like nothing because the police chiefs
up there didn't care.

63
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,390
But if you live down in the cities,
Ha,

64
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,580
you couldn't get conceal and carry if
you bribed them.

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,370
That's interesting because there's a
state law that's Washington wasn't.

66
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,040
It was,
but it was left up to the police chiefs,

67
00:03:18,041 --> 00:03:22,060
so if you went up,
I went and changed that and made it

68
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:27,061
universal across the state shall issue,
but we required you had to go through an

69
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:30,010
accredited gun training course.

70
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,640
You had to go to the range and shoot a
minimum of 70.

71
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,560
You had to have a complete background
check done on you criminal background,

72
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,790
everything,
and in the case of a five point,

73
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,680
oh,
eight with alcohol,

74
00:03:44,681 --> 00:03:49,150
with driving,
I made conceal and carry point zero,

75
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,930
zero.
Well those are good and if you're

76
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:57,130
carrying your weapon,
you are not under the influence of any

77
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,420
alcohol.
None.

78
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,060
That's a.
those are all excellent ideas and that's

79
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:04,150
where we passed it.
Now if you qualify for all that,

80
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:05,850
it shall issue.
What?

81
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,740
So what do you stand with?
The NRA has been.

82
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,030
They pushed back and I understand why
they push back against Gun.

83
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,010
Any gun regulation,
anything that comes up.

84
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,980
Regulation in regards to background
checks,

85
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:22,720
regards to anything because they feel
like ground lost is lost forever and

86
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,800
ever.
It is and it.

87
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,940
And it is a.

88
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:30,570
where I feel is is that you,
let me put it to you this way,

89
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,980
life experiences.
I was physically in the Philippines,

90
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,610
Philippine islands.
I was physically in the Philippines.

91
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:44,611
The Day Ferdinand Marcos became a
dictator who I was there now.

92
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:48,760
I was in the US military on a US
military base,

93
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,620
so it didn't really affect us.
I mean,

94
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:52,480
we'd go into town and all that,
but there was a.

95
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,140
Then you had a soldier on every corner
with a machine gun.

96
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:58,000
When he did it.
Well,

97
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,020
here's what I'm getting to.
He became a dictator and gave himself

98
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:05,140
the power of the president,
the Congress and the supreme court,

99
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:09,850
complete dictatorship.
The first thing he did as a dictator,

100
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:15,420
he gave the people of the Philippines a
10 to 12 day grace period to turn in all

101
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,940
guns,
or it was the death penalty.

102
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,430
Now,
my question to the people who oppose gun

103
00:05:24,431 --> 00:05:26,680
rights are,
are are anti guns.

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,100
Why would a dictator make his first
thing of business to disarm the public?

105
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,760
Why would he make that as number one
priority?

106
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,550
And it's pretty obvious he doesn't want
to.

107
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,510
Alicia.
Exactly.

108
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,780
Yeah,
and people fail to realize our second

109
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,781
amendment is there for us to be able to
defend ourself against our own

110
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:53,200
government.
That there it's not there for hunting

111
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,900
and fishing.
When they wrote the bill of rights,

112
00:05:55,901 --> 00:05:58,010
if you didn't hunt and fish,
he didn't eat.

113
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,600
That was irrelevant.
It was there because the British used to

114
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:06,410
come and occupy our homes,
steal our stuff.

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,980
So the British cars,
the Second Amendment to happen to where

116
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,020
our forefathers says,
no,

117
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,200
we're going to allow the people to be
able to defend themselves against

118
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,960
oppressive government.
So do you think that the opposition to

119
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,640
it is just a lack of foresight?
Like the,

120
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:26,720
the idea that you're living in this time
where for the most part things are very

121
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:29,690
peaceful.
It's probably the most safe time ever to

122
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:34,610
be alive and that people have forgotten
that it's entirely possible that tyranny

123
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,040
could erupt at any moment.
Maybe so.

124
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,160
And they don't realize that maybe,
maybe we,

125
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,220
you know,
you got to movements that happened this

126
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:45,230
year.
You had the Bernie Sanders Movement and

127
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:48,920
the Donald Trump movement originally.
They wanted the same thing.

128
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:53,060
They could never get together though,
because once the firefighter left the

129
00:06:53,061 --> 00:06:54,040
others,
the firefighter,

130
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,810
right,
but that what they wanted was a turnover

131
00:06:56,811 --> 00:06:57,740
in Washington.

132
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,060
They were sick of business as usual.
Let's run these bums out,

133
00:07:02,061 --> 00:07:05,270
let's start fresh.
That's what they're two movements were

134
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:08,360
about and the more we're seeing day to
day,

135
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,880
I mean,
I think Hillary Clinton is obviously a

136
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:15,110
more rational choice than Donald Trump.
She's obviously a person who speaks

137
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:17,660
better,
a better representative of the people.

138
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,950
She's intelligent.
She's measured unless she flip flops

139
00:07:21,951 --> 00:07:23,180
constantly,
constantly.

140
00:07:23,181 --> 00:07:27,920
But she's obviously deeply,
deeply embed with the banks and special

141
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:32,921
interest groups in this most recent
wikileaks release of emails.

142
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:37,430
It shows that she's been,
she's been with talking with bankers,

143
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,250
making sure that marijuana stays
illegal.

144
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,260
I mean,
this is something that she has vowed to

145
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:47,240
push back against with all of our might.
And that's a disturbing thing to see in

146
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,760
2016 because my,
uh,

147
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,020
you know,
there's more people locked up.

148
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:53,280
I don't know if people know this,
but there's more people locked up for

149
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:57,770
marijuana in this country then for all
violent crimes combined.

150
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,860
And that is terrifying.
It's horrible.

151
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,140
It's terrifying.
It's horrible too.

152
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,530
When you get to.
Like when I did this book and went into

153
00:08:06,531 --> 00:08:11,531
the history.
What's terrifies you there is that our

154
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:15,140
history books,
our government written with the

155
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:20,141
government's view of history of what
they want you to know because what

156
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:25,331
astounded me in doing this book was to
learn that marijuana was the economic

157
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:31,481
backbone of this country for its first
160 years of existence.

158
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,710
That if George Washington and Thomas
Jefferson were alive today,

159
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,660
they'd be raided by the dea.
They'd be doing 10 to 12 years in the

160
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:46,661
federal penitentiary for being major
drug dealers because they both raised

161
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:49,700
massive amounts of marijuana and sold
it.

162
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,290
And and there was a time that England,
when we were the colonies forced us to

163
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:01,070
grow it because they needed it for their
sales on their ships and the rope and so

164
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:06,210
that they could colonize the world with
their navy and they forced us to grow

165
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:10,230
it.
And here you have a product and now all

166
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:12,960
the.
The reason that I personally have gotten

167
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:17,520
on the bandwagon,
and I've made this a personal focus is

168
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:22,521
because I had completely lost my quality
of life and marijuana has given it back.

169
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,680
How so?
Well,

170
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,890
I won't say because of privacy,
but someone extremely close to me,

171
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,840
developed epileptic seizure disorder and
was seizing three to four times a week

172
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,340
and I was taking care of these seizures
three to four times a week.

173
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,850
If you've ever dealt with someone with a
seizure disorder,

174
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,140
it's a feeling of helplessness.
It's a feeling of pain.

175
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,260
You can't even imagine what that
person's going through.

176
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,690
This is the person taking care of them,
and if it's someone you love,

177
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,740
the pain is unbelievable,
and so the person was put on four

178
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:06,450
different,
one after the other pharmaceutical

179
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,310
medicines for seizures,
right?

180
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,600
None of them worked.
They all had horrible side effects.

181
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,530
The seizures continued for two over two
years.

182
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:18,900
Finally,
in desperation,

183
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,770
we went to Colorado.
The person got quote,

184
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,250
medical marijuana,
three drops under the tongue three times

185
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,020
a day.
Amazingly,

186
00:10:28,021 --> 00:10:31,580
the seizures stopped.
You have a good friend whose son has an

187
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,480
amazingly.
Now the person's completely weaned off

188
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,410
all pharmaceutical and that's now in
pill form.

189
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:44,340
The person takes a pill in the morning
appeal at night and has been seizure

190
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:47,300
free for two and a half years.
Now they've taken a pharmaceutical based

191
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:48,270
Pilliga,
Marinol,

192
00:10:48,271 --> 00:10:52,080
or they know they're taking real.
It's the other stuff.

193
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,060
The O,
m,

194
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,170
the other.
Not The thc,

195
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,760
but the other thing,
cbd.

196
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:59,460
Yeah.
That person needs the seat and fact this

197
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:02,790
person takes zero thc.
All CBD,

198
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,620
so they're not psych.
It's not psychoactive.

199
00:11:04,621 --> 00:11:07,240
What's at all,
which is really a non [inaudible] non

200
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,060
now not even if it were.

201
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,620
Who Cares?
Exactly.

202
00:11:10,621 --> 00:11:13,170
You know,
like my friend Tommy Chong told me,

203
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,620
Tommy Chong said there should be no
difference between medical marijuana and

204
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,570
recreational.
He said the entire plants medical,

205
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,040
those that are smoking it for the
euphoric feeling are doing it for mental

206
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,110
health.
Oh,

207
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:28,350
absolutely.
Yeah.

208
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:32,790
So how do you get through this life if
you can smoke a joint in the evening and

209
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:35,670
it makes you relax and what's the matter
with that?

210
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,720
What's the difference between that or
having a glass of wine or having

211
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:44,570
anything else while we're just victims
of the propaganda of the 19 thirties and

212
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,230
whether people know it or not.
It was all organized by Randolph hearst

213
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:50,760
and race spacing,
race based,

214
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,430
and William Randolph hearst who owned
hearst also earned,

215
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:59,490
owned a bunch of paper mills.
He owned these factors of Timberland and

216
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:02,890
they came out with a machine called the
decorticator,

217
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:06,190
whether people know this or not,
and the decorticator made it

218
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,930
economically easy to process hemp fiber,
so they came out with this in the 19

219
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:14,830
thirties and the popular science
magazine at the time.

220
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:19,210
It had a cover that said Hampton new
billion dollar crop based entirely on

221
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,750
this new invention that decorticator
because before that they used to use

222
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:24,760
slavery than when the cotton gin came
around.

223
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,350
They use cotton instead of hemp because
it was easier to get your enjoyable

224
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:33,090
because I don't have to say all this was
one of those things that I've always

225
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,760
forever tries to be fucking crazy.
After you've done your homework,

226
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:39,730
it's wonderful because usually I go on a
show,

227
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,100
I'd have to do the explanation,
you know that,

228
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,660
but with you,
I don't have to.

229
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,010
You know it already.
Well,

230
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,900
William Randolph hearst was a real piece
of shit.

231
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,510
He really was.
He was in charge,

232
00:12:49,511 --> 00:12:53,200
not just have these paper mills,
but he was in charge of disseminating

233
00:12:53,201 --> 00:12:55,890
the news.
I mean this guy ran hearst publication

234
00:12:55,900 --> 00:13:00,900
26 newspapers in all white rug,
country and marijuana,

235
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:07,060
two to race bait to blame the devil weed
that black smoked and then they'll rape

236
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:12,340
your daughters and your children and
your wives and all that,

237
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,620
and Lazy Mexicans.

238
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,680
That's why they lay around and these
brown skinned people,

239
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:22,420
these Mexicans are all smoking pot.
You live in Mexico after about four

240
00:13:22,421 --> 00:13:25,420
months out of the fuck is less lazy than
Mexicans,

241
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,440
Mexicans,
illegal workers I've ever met.

242
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,720
Exactly.
It is one of the dumbest stereotypes.

243
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:34,540
All time.
I'll Mexican gardeners go,

244
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,100
oh,
I'll tell you this.

245
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,190
I live off the grid I live where there's
no electricity and our from pavement and

246
00:13:43,001 --> 00:13:46,960
an hour from electricity.
A neighbor built a home down there and I

247
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:49,480
had nothing to do,
so I'd go watch it everyday.

248
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,720
That's how I lived down there and I
watched these Mexican workers build a

249
00:13:55,211 --> 00:14:00,211
whole lot of cement from scratch.
They didn't have electronic cement

250
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:04,570
mixers.
They mixed every bit of that cement by

251
00:14:04,571 --> 00:14:07,060
hand and one day I'm watching me.
No,

252
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:12,061
the rebar,
two guys had to bend rebar by hand,

253
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:17,200
jerking on it with a pipe to put it at a
45 or 90 degree angle,

254
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:20,020
whatever it was,
up to code to inspect that building.

255
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,190
Well,
the point was,

256
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:23,800
I started laughing and I said,
you know,

257
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,090
if you brought the American construction
worker down here,

258
00:14:28,091 --> 00:14:33,091
he'd quit the day.
You will quit in a day where because all

259
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:38,311
they do is deliver raw materials and
these Mexican builders would build

260
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:44,220
cement houses out of nothing,
out of raw material without a bit of

261
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:46,470
electricity.
Yeah.

262
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,270
I'm a big fan of Mexico and I love it
down there.

263
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,800
I love the food.
I love the.

264
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,820
I love the life I lead down there
because it's the exact opposite of here.

265
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,430
Down there.
I live off the grid and I only pay

266
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,610
attention to what I can see.
That's nice.

267
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,370
Relax.
Called flushing your brain out.

268
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,200
My family lives down there.
My parents do.

269
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,530
Yeah.
They decided to chill out down to Mexico

270
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,500
to only do the retirement thing.
I'll tell you what else is great to

271
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:17,090
taxes and we always laugh at the Mexican
government.

272
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,260
Oh,
they're corrupt.

273
00:15:18,261 --> 00:15:21,140
They're this and that.
On property taxes,

274
00:15:21,141 --> 00:15:24,730
they are way superior to us.
That works down there.

275
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,090
No.
Here,

276
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,350
at least in Minnesota,
which is pretty much universal.

277
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,320
If you buy a home and you're a good
citizen and you fix the home up and

278
00:15:36,321 --> 00:15:38,570
improve it,
how do they reward you?

279
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,490
You pay more for your taxes.
Go up for being a good citizen.

280
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,180
So using their analogy,
you should buy the house,

281
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:50,360
let it become the shit hole on the block
and they'll reward.

282
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:51,530
Yeah,
you'll pay less.

283
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,690
Here's how it works.
In Mexico,

284
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,630
Mexico,
you're taxes are due in March.

285
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,350
Property taxes,
if I pay them in January early,

286
00:16:00,351 --> 00:16:04,160
they knock off 20 percent.
If I pay them in February,

287
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:08,450
they knock off 10 percent.
I go down January 28th,

288
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,930
February's a short month,
so in 30 days I get 20 percent on my

289
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:18,500
money legally.
Tell me where I can do that.

290
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,410
That's pretty beautiful.
Twenty percent in 30 days.

291
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,720
Now granted it's only a couple hundred
bucks because property taxes are cheap

292
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:31,220
there anyway,
but that's a couple tanks of gas for my

293
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,800
pickup truck.
Do you feel weird living down there?

294
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,000
Not a bit.
Not at all.

295
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:35,930
No.
No.

296
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,180
I don't even know the language.
You don't know Spanish now.

297
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,610
Why don't you know?
Because I've never taken time to bother.

298
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,380
I get it down there.
You just basically talk to me.

299
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,790
Well,
between what they know of English and

300
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,100
whatnot,
I know of Spanish and to mining,

301
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,810
we figure it out.
Wow.

302
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,890
It's like,
okay,

303
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:59,150
all you got to know to survive in Mexico
is one word,

304
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,650
which is just look at all.
No,

305
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,451
look,
not all.

306
00:17:02,451 --> 00:17:03,380
Uh,
that's high.

307
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,180
I see.
I know a little bit now.

308
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,050
No,
no.

309
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:11,050
You look at it and Mexican smile at them
and say Cerveza and you'll get a smile

310
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:12,500
back.

311
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,040
Surveys to see.
Oh,

312
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,500
so you just getting hammered all the
time,

313
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,730
just say beer to a May.
Love to drink beer so that will smooth

314
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,670
out any situation.
Just smile and say Cerveza.

315
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,140
Most people don't know also that almost
all drugs are decriminalized in Mexico

316
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,870
in,
in response to the drug laws and the

317
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,430
drug war starting to get there.
The Supreme Court ruled on for people,

318
00:17:34,431 --> 00:17:36,920
but only those four people can grow and
half pot.

319
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,710
It takes three more cases before it
becomes the law.

320
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,270
Yeah.
I don't think it's legal,

321
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:44,600
but it's decriminalized like mushrooms
at decriminalized getting their

322
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,640
President Fox,
who was my friend,

323
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:49,160
he came out and said he wants to
decriminalize.

324
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,070
Said I'm a rancher

325
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,810
farmer.
I want to grow at your friends with the

326
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:52,690
president.
Yeah,

327
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:56,310
that's pretty dope.
I knew both of them saw a fox and a who

328
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:58,650
was before him,
a well member.

329
00:17:58,651 --> 00:18:00,960
I was a governor.
I went there on a trade mission.

330
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:04,080
Oh,
and that's Fox and Fox and I actually

331
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:09,081
Fox and I actually established a trade
thing in Minnesota via Mexico because

332
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:11,850
when I was down in Mexico they took me
to the,

333
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,540
uh,
to the corona brewery and when they took

334
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:18,710
me,
there were pallets of corn all from

335
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:20,580
Minnesota.
Yes.

336
00:18:20,581 --> 00:18:23,880
He actually send their corn from
Minnesota to make corona beer.

337
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,670
So when you say,
I would assume that like corona is such

338
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,800
a weak beer and as soon as it's probably
grown in America.

339
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,731
No,
it's corn,

340
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,980
but it's United States courts.
Minnesota corn.

341
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:34,890
That's free.
That makes corona.

342
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,150
Yeah.
Gluten free.

343
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,250
Like if you're one of those gluten free
fucks,

344
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,450
you can have a corona.

345
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:43,350
So the one of the few beers I think
Heineken to some rice based beers.

346
00:18:43,351 --> 00:18:46,260
I think budweiser actually leave it in
corona though.

347
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:48,540
They get all the.
They get all their corn from Minnesota.

348
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,060
So you just surveys ended up back there?
No,

349
00:18:51,061 --> 00:18:52,660
I don't drink.
I don't even know.

350
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,553
Drink.
No.

351
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,980
So why do you say Cervesa for your
friends?

352
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,770
Well,
because that means beer and Mexican and

353
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,320
all the Mexicans love beer.
Oh,

354
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:03,510
I see.
That's why if you just smile and say

355
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,460
surveys,
Adam,

356
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,770
you'll get a smile.
Surveys.

357
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:06,940
So see.
Oh,

358
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,880
okay.
So you're not asking for.

359
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:10,410
Well,
I'm not asking for one.

360
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,110
Oh,
I thought you were just doing gay

361
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,350
friendly.
Oh No,

362
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:15,420
I don't drink.
So what do you do down there?

363
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,230
I wake up in the morning with nothing to
do and when I go to bed at night,

364
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:20,190
I'm half done.

365
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,590
Ah,
can you tell?

366
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:24,270
I've been asked that answer.
You can tell.

367
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,270
No,
I stole that from a friend down there.

368
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,750
He said at one day and I said,
can I use that when I do an interview?

369
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,990
He said feel free.
So I wake up in the morning with nothing

370
00:19:33,991 --> 00:19:37,230
to do and by the time I go to bed at
night I'm half done.

371
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,930
Well you obviously wrote this book so
you're doing something.

372
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,070
Yeah.
So why,

373
00:19:42,071 --> 00:19:43,980
why do you write books?
You just get bored and you know,

374
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:47,280
I write them if I'm motivated.
So you got motivated because of this

375
00:19:47,281 --> 00:19:50,070
epileptic seizure issue.
I don't know if you've ever paid

376
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:50,821
attention to this,
but,

377
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:52,950
uh,
the navy seals had an issue with

378
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:55,740
epileptic seizures as well from the
rebreathers.

379
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,040
Um,
apparently there's something to do with

380
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,620
getting the bug.
I found out about it because I started,

381
00:20:01,621 --> 00:20:02,710
um,
uh,

382
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:06,120
eating a ketogenic diet,
getting my body to process fat instead

383
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,570
of carbohydrates,
and one of the reasons that the seals

384
00:20:09,571 --> 00:20:14,460
are looking into this is because it
prevents seizures in people that use

385
00:20:14,461 --> 00:20:16,470
those rebreathers as opposed to,
uh,

386
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,000
you know,
the ones that don't make bubbles.

387
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,200
Yeah.
I used them all the time.

388
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,120
The Emerson,
I dove them.

389
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:24,150
That was the majority of the thing I
dove when I was getting there and I

390
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,770
never had a seizure.
Let's not,

391
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,810
I never heard of anyone having a
seizure.

392
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,870
Some people have them apparently.
I don't know.

393
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,330
I never heard of it the entire six years
I was in.

394
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,580
Well,
it's also a epilepsy in children.

395
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,620
They've used ketogenic diets to,
uh,

396
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,810
to control epilepsy in children.
But again,

397
00:20:39,811 --> 00:20:41,650
like you were saying,
there was another big.

398
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:45,540
I would think this,
I would think if anyone had any type of

399
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,010
seizure disorder that would him

400
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,590
from the seals.
Yeah.

401
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,480
I don't think it's a disorder.
I think it's a direct result of using

402
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:57,130
the rebreathers yeah.
But I would think anyone that had that

403
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,560
result from a rebreather would be washed
out.

404
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:00,670
Yeah.
You think right?

405
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:03,070
Well,
because you couldn't take the risk that

406
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:06,970
the person would have to do that job and
could have a seizure while attempting to

407
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:07,721
do it.
Yeah.

408
00:21:07,721 --> 00:21:12,721
I don't know when the seizures occur.
I don't know if this is the first I've

409
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:15,280
ever heard of it.
Dr Dom D'agostino,

410
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:16,220
who is a,
um,

411
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,330
one of the premier experts on a
ketogenic diets and nutritional ketones.

412
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,810
He's,
uh,

413
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:26,260
he's spoken about this and I've read
some other articles about it as well

414
00:21:26,261 --> 00:21:29,500
about where you've got to be with kids
with epilepsy.

415
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,730
You gotta remember when I was in the
teams it was a whole different mindset.

416
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,020
Well,
it wasn't even called the seals back

417
00:21:35,021 --> 00:21:35,440
then,
right.

418
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,120
You recall the ball fields to were
underwater demolition teams and the

419
00:21:40,121 --> 00:21:43,450
shields both.
It was called Udt seal bugs,

420
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,780
bugs.
Bud stands for basic underwater

421
00:21:46,781 --> 00:21:51,580
demolition slash seal.
What happened was we were the frog man

422
00:21:51,581 --> 00:21:56,581
in in 1962,
John F Kennedy had enough foresight to

423
00:21:57,401 --> 00:22:01,330
realize that wars would be fought by
small units from now on,

424
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:06,130
so he took the frog men out of the water
and he put them on the land with an

425
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:09,640
executive order because up until that
point in time,

426
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,090
the navy could go,
not go past the high watermark.

427
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,430
From that point,
it was the marines.

428
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,590
He required President Kennedy to sign an
executive order that allowed the navy to

429
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:23,980
go past the high watermark,
which he then created.

430
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:28,870
The Kennedy came out of the Navy,
so he took the navy frogman and put us

431
00:22:28,871 --> 00:22:32,770
on land and they re re named distend
seals,

432
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:37,990
which the acronym seal stands for sea
air land teams,

433
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,700
which means we come from the sea,
we come from the air,

434
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,440
and we come from the land.

435
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,110
Any of the three.
That's interesting.

436
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,240
That's where the.
That's where it all came from.

437
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:53,350
Kennedy Forum to seal.
He took the frog man out of the water

438
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,010
and put him on.
The marines were angry because they felt

439
00:22:57,011 --> 00:23:00,730
that the land was theirs in the navy.
Shouldn't be there.

440
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,800
That's always been weird to me that the
rivalry between military units,

441
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,110
you would think that the United States
military is one big team?

442
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,600
No,
because if you're not in a common war

443
00:23:10,601 --> 00:23:12,790
then you got to fight each other.
Isn't that bizarre?

444
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,770
Yeah.
People are fucking crazy.

445
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,470
I went crazy.
When you're in the military,

446
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:19,330
it's just your.
Your mindset.

447
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,451
Yeah.
You know,

448
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:24,520
it's your mindset and you get bored.
So if you haven't got an enemy to fight,

449
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:26,500
then you fight the other.
In the bars,

450
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:30,670
you fight the other surfaces.
So we used to do it all the time.

451
00:23:30,671 --> 00:23:32,050
We did trouble all the time.

452
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,220
No,
but doesn't that seem stupid?

453
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:40,570
I mean as well.
One big team wore stupid and if so,

454
00:23:40,571 --> 00:23:41,404
why?
So why?

455
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,420
Why wouldn't there be stupidity along
with wore that?

456
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,990
You're dealing with people with major
egos,

457
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:51,710
high testosterone rate and their and
their warriors.

458
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,400
You know when you play that game,
that's a game for real.

459
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,650
You know,
many times you don't come back and play

460
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:00,590
again.
They didn't like football and he didn't

461
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:03,410
like any of these sporting events.
It's A.

462
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,440
It's a game of functionality.
Did it feel like a game when you were in

463
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,090
the military?
No,

464
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:14,140
it was my job
most.

465
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,100
Well,
again,

466
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,580
as a pro athlete that your job too,
it feels like a job.

467
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,040
It's your job,
it's your job,

468
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:25,510
but it's also your life.
I mean it's not a volunteer job,

469
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,460
but you volunteer of course,
to go into the budge,

470
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:31,060
you have to volunteer,
volunteer unit.

471
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,400
You can volunteer in,
you can volunteer out.

472
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,780
It's whether you want to do the job or
not.

473
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,970
When all that shit went down with Chris
Kyle and the.

474
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:46,170
When he said that he punched you in a
bar and get you sued the family like,

475
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,033
no,
I didn't.

476
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,560
Well I didn't choose glute ham rather.
Excuse me.

477
00:24:49,561 --> 00:24:54,561
I shooed him and he died and then the
shoot automatically goes to his estate.

478
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,360
That's the way the legal works.
She was never in any jeopardy because in

479
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,690
any writers contract you have insurance
from the publisher,

480
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:07,320
so it's me again.
They portrayed and I became the villain

481
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,230
going after the widow and the kids.
Exactly.

482
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:13,500
That's the biggest lie.
It was a big insurance company that's

483
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:17,400
covering the whole thing.
They're not out a penny and they won't

484
00:25:17,401 --> 00:25:19,140
be out of pain that you had to explain
it,

485
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:20,340
I'm sure over and over.
No,

486
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:22,160
I couldn't explain it,
but the tie,

487
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,500
the trial got overturned because the
insurance came out,

488
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:29,640
so it's okay to lie in court,
but if the truth comes out,

489
00:25:29,641 --> 00:25:30,720
you can get a new trial.

490
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,640
The insurance came out.
What does that mean in court?

491
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,970
You're not allowed to say that insurance
is paying for everything,

492
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:39,990
even though it's the truth.
You're not allowed to say that in court.

493
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,680
So what happens when you say it in court
while it came out and the judge allowed

494
00:25:43,681 --> 00:25:47,130
it to a limited degree and then the
appeals court ruled that the judge

495
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:52,020
shouldn't have did that
because having the judge say that it

496
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:55,830
sways people.
They think that if it all against

497
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:58,190
insurance companies,
because insurance companies a big.

498
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:02,040
Even though the other side is doing
what's called poor morale thing,

499
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:05,950
they're getting up and saying it's
taxing them financially and lying

500
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,400
insurance is paying for all of us.
Don't get up and lie about it.

501
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:15,600
So the other side was saying this is
going to devastate our reality.

502
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:19,680
Trying to influence the end and in this
case,

503
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:24,770
let me state this.
How overwhelming must be evidence of Ben

504
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,560
for the jury to go against the grieving
widow of the dead war veteran?

505
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,900
Yeah.
It must be pretty overwhelming.

506
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,560
The evidence was overwhelming.
The the,

507
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:39,330
the jury went from.
They came for me.

508
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:43,140
They said he was lied.
This didn't happen and we're awarding.

509
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:43,980
Why do you think

510
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,930
he did that?
Did you know him?

511
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,430
No,
you didn't know him,

512
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:51,420
know him.
I know even thing happened.

513
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:55,560
We were there on the same nights we were
at [inaudible] because I was there for a

514
00:26:55,561 --> 00:27:00,150
graduation of class 2:58 AM,
class 58.

515
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,870
It's traditionally every hundred classes
if you can,

516
00:27:03,871 --> 00:27:08,871
you come back to the graduation.
So class 2:58 was graduating the next

517
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,110
day on Friday.
I came out along with my team mates from

518
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:17,280
58 to attend that graduation the next
day.

519
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,930
So why would I say bad things about the
seals if I'm there?

520
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,520
That's what he said he punched me for
will tell,

521
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,660
because people don't know what we're
talking about because probably a lot of

522
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,700
people listening to this have no idea
what we're talking about.

523
00:27:29,701 --> 00:27:31,740
So let me just fill my real clear right.
The,

524
00:27:31,741 --> 00:27:33,480
the book,
American sniper.

525
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:38,430
The movie with Bradley Cooper was just
giant hit movie,

526
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:42,330
very patriotic movie about a guy who was
one of the most successful snipers in US

527
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:43,164
history,
right?

528
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,100
A very successful warrior,
navy seal,

529
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:49,080
war hero.
Everybody loved him.

530
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:54,390
Then he goes on the opiod,
Anthony Show and he says that he punched

531
00:27:54,391 --> 00:27:57,660
you out.
Know there's a chapter in his book where

532
00:27:57,661 --> 00:28:00,620
he writes that he called me scruff face.
Yeah.

533
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,170
And you said that.
I said seals deserved to die.

534
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,140
That in other words,
she accused me of treason.

535
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,950
Yes.
And I was out there for a seal

536
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,400
graduation.
If I felt that way about my old unit,

537
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:18,060
why would I be attending?
So he wrote in the book,

538
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:19,800
He gave you a nickname in the book,
scruff,

539
00:28:19,801 --> 00:28:20,491
face,
whoever.

540
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:22,560
I mean he might not have,
even when he wrote it in the book,

541
00:28:22,561 --> 00:28:24,840
he might not have even thought that it
was going to give that to you.

542
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,430
I mean,
who knows what was going on.

543
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,060
My thought was at the time I was trying
to wrap my head around why anybody would

544
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:34,830
do this and I was thinking,
well maybe he's just trying to generate

545
00:28:34,831 --> 00:28:38,640
as much controversy as possible to
generate as much income as possible from

546
00:28:38,641 --> 00:28:39,330
his book.

547
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,310
And it just got out of hand.
I don't,

548
00:28:41,311 --> 00:28:42,840
I mean,
I'm sure I was trying to put it together

549
00:28:42,841 --> 00:28:44,670
because there was a couple of other
fabrications,

550
00:28:44,671 --> 00:28:45,860
right?
There was a,

551
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:48,600
um,
a shooting at a gas station that never

552
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,560
took place.
And he said that he,

553
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,600
during Katrina he was on the home and
shot people who were looting.

554
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,430
Yeah.
That was disturbing because that's

555
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,470
murder.
Yeah.

556
00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,380
And he also lied about his medals.
The navy had to come out and.

557
00:29:01,381 --> 00:29:04,290
Correct.
He said he had two silver stars and five

558
00:29:04,291 --> 00:29:07,080
bronze stars.
He had won silver star.

559
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:10,230
And three bronze star.
So we lied about three medals.

560
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,380
Well that's one in three is impressive
enough.

561
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,440
Exactly.
Yeah,

562
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:17,880
exactly.
And then they try to give them an excuse

563
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:18,451
saying,
well,

564
00:29:18,451 --> 00:29:19,740
he was confused.
No,

565
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:22,410
you're not.
When you get a medal like that,

566
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,580
it's like graduating from college.
They give you a certificate that puts on

567
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:29,350
your wall.
If you win the bronze star,

568
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,200
the Silver Star.
But as a,

569
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:35,550
as a seal yourself.
And he threw me under the bus.

570
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,410
What does that feel like to you?
Because reason.

571
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:40,500
But this is obviously,
this is something that's very near and

572
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,460
dear to your who?
Hugely.

573
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,090
He has made it to where I can't go to a
reunion anymore.

574
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:51,470
There were 170 seals that wanted me
kicked out of the Udt Seal Association

575
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,780
over his lie
and the lives of his buddies who came up

576
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,840
and tried to testify for them.
So what it.

577
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:03,460
It got embarrassing?
His trial said that it actually

578
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,031
happened.
No,

579
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:07,330
they couldn't say it,
but they tried to say everything else to

580
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:08,980
make it seem like it did.
Well.

581
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,090
How the hell they do that?
Well,

582
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:13,440
because they dance around the questions
and the lawyering and well,

583
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:17,470
you have to piece together.
There wasn't one witness that saw me get

584
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:20,890
hit and there wasn't one witness that
heard me say anything.

585
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:24,850
See attributed to me.
And weren't you visible the next day?

586
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,230
No photographs that night.
Them posing for pictures with me.

587
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,650
If I had said all this stuff,
why would they have take pictures with

588
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:36,220
me?

589
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:41,220
What is that feeling like when someone
just fucking lies horrible and when it

590
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,270
makes a lot of terrible,
terrible.

591
00:30:43,271 --> 00:30:47,680
And what's worse about it is the media
jumps on it and convicts me of it

592
00:30:47,681 --> 00:30:51,370
because why they broke the story when I
went off the grid,

593
00:30:51,371 --> 00:30:55,930
Mexico where I couldn't even come back.
So they broke the story.

594
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,320
Do you think they knew?
I'm starting to believe that,

595
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:02,290
but weren't.
Didn't it happen on the opiod Anthony

596
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,123
Show?
Yeah,

597
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,640
but I don't think that was planned
because I know those guys,

598
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,060
but there was the whole ball.
They all show did it.

599
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:12,790
He did it that day on O'reilly later
that afternoon.

600
00:31:12,791 --> 00:31:14,080
So he wants.
He named you.

601
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,880
He just started naming you ever.
Oh yeah.

602
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,970
Then it went viral,
it went viral,

603
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,970
and everyone convicted me because they
said,

604
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:25,090
well,
this Iraq war veteran wouldn't lie.

605
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,070
Really?
I just,

606
00:31:27,071 --> 00:31:28,040
I watched a.

607
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,580
well,
let me tell you all that.

608
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:34,620
It's destroyed my life.
I can't get hired for a job during my

609
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,060
trial.
After it was over,

610
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:40,960
guess what happened?
Thirty four major media conglomerates

611
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,090
entered the,
the,

612
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:42,943
the,
uh,

613
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,230
the trial with that Amis Ama,
cc,

614
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:50,170
they call it or whatever have of
influencing the court of appeals to

615
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:52,450
overturn my verdict.
And they did it.

616
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,780
Thirty four media conglomerates that New
York Times the Washington Post.

617
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:03,090
All of these media conglomerates appeal
to the Court of Appeals to overturn my

618
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:04,570
verdict.
But why?

619
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,950
Because I won on something called unjust
enrichment.

620
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:13,240
They want the ability to be able to
defame you and profit from it.

621
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,700
In other words,
I'll put it what they had,

622
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:18,070
what these judges accommodated them
with.

623
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,070
There's gonna be another trial.
They've ordered a new trial.

624
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,110
So I got to go through it again,
but I'm glad because when it comes out

625
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:31,111
to juries and two judges find kyle
guilty who's not going to believe it

626
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,120
then and.

627
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,790
But the point is they.
They've ordered a new trial,

628
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,893
they've,
they,

629
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,940
they throughout the whole verdict of the
jury,

630
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,560
the federal judge who wrote substantial
evidence supporting the jury's verdict.

631
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:49,340
They did all that and they violated
their own rules.

632
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,950
A 76 year rule.
Here's what it states if,

633
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:58,820
because it happened during summation,
where the judge allowed it in the my

634
00:32:58,821 --> 00:33:02,750
attorney,
it ended up for questions in an 11 day

635
00:33:02,751 --> 00:33:06,830
trial and a half,
a page of a 20 page summary and it was

636
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:11,831
overturned on that and they overturned
it because they felt that it was undue

637
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:16,160
influence on the jury that they found
out that insurance was paying for

638
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,550
everything.
So as one factor,

639
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,880
well,
and here's the deal.

640
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:25,780
If the rules state that if in final
argument they say something,

641
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:30,140
you must object,
you must object.

642
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:35,141
So the trial lawyer as a chance to rule
during final argument and the jury has a

643
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:37,820
chance to hear the ruling,
they never objected

644
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,200
dead,
so they must object to undue influence

645
00:33:40,201 --> 00:33:41,530
because of the fact that it was

646
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,150
wait,
they never objected.

647
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:50,020
The jury was dismissed at 1158 at 12.
Oh two.

648
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:53,880
They then objected.
The judge overruled him and we were done

649
00:33:53,881 --> 00:33:55,200
with it.
Well,

650
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,340
these two judges,
Riley and shepherd have now overturned

651
00:33:59,341 --> 00:34:03,390
the case on something that was never
objected to in trial.

652
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,620
They objected to it,
so they overturned the jury and the

653
00:34:07,621 --> 00:34:11,460
federal judge Van.
They also overturned my unjust

654
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:14,700
enrichment claim because the media
didn't want it.

655
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:20,060
What they've allowed now is the media
can defame you and profit from it and

656
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:25,620
you can't get any of their profits and
no matter how they harm you,

657
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,840
while that's the equivalent of if you
went out and robbed the bank and they

658
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:35,280
caught you and they sentenced you to two
years in prison for the bank robbery.

659
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:38,160
But when you get out,
you get to keep all the money you took.

660
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,900
So that's in this particular,
this particular,

661
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:46,380
which will now be the standard,
there's they've ruled that way,

662
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,560
they now make it to where you can profit
from wrongdoing because of this case.

663
00:34:51,961 --> 00:34:52,794
Yep.

664
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:58,680
This is such a touchy case because it's
so indicative of the complications of

665
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:03,090
people because people are not simple.
It's really very touchy.

666
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,040
He lied.
He did lie,

667
00:35:05,041 --> 00:35:09,180
but to me with his lie that.
But that's not what I'm saying.

668
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:14,270
What's complicated is he's also the
subject of this gigantic movie and this

669
00:35:14,501 --> 00:35:18,690
symbol of patriotism where so many
people will say,

670
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:20,010
Chris Kyle,
rest and peace.

671
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:24,400
So many people would have a cloud.
That was.

672
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,910
Someone took a photo in the cloud and
that's on a cloud.

673
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:28,890
That's Chris.
Chris Kyle.

674
00:35:28,891 --> 00:35:30,830
It'll look like a sniper in the car in
this.

675
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,440
It's Chris Kyle guiding a,
guarding the skies.

676
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:38,940
Like it became a meme.
I mean he became this where it wasn't.

677
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,940
He was a representative of the brave
military,

678
00:35:41,941 --> 00:35:45,750
like the portrayal,
but honestly the betrayal that Bradley

679
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:50,750
Cooper played in that movie,
that movie was so simplistic and so it

680
00:35:50,951 --> 00:35:53,700
was,
it was like a brand of a Joseph

681
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,490
Campbell.
Okay,

682
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,940
perfect.
Hero's journey.

683
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,990
Had I not gone to court,
that would have been in the movie.

684
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,360
Really?
I had to stop it.

685
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,580
They were going to have him punch you in
the movie.

686
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,350
Well,
the book,

687
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,920
Holy Shit.
And I had to stop it because I know when

688
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:11,630
we were,
when we were in trial,

689
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:14,870
you know what they tried to do to
diminish my role because when they knew

690
00:36:14,871 --> 00:36:18,770
they were going to lose their lawyer got
me on the stand and he said,

691
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:20,870
Mr Ventura.
He said,

692
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:25,871
would it surprise you to know that the
first draft of the movie doesn't have

693
00:36:28,221 --> 00:36:32,520
you in it?
Trying to prove how insignificant my

694
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,350
first draft of the movie.
That doesn't mean shit.

695
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:36,560
Well,
the first draft of this.

696
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,570
Yeah,
but so what if the second draft?

697
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:38,770
Yes,

698
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:40,160
you ended though.
I said,

699
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,340
here's where my response.
I said,

700
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,100
no,
that wouldn't surprise me at all because

701
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:49,650
I said we've sent two letters to warner
brothers warning them that if I am

702
00:36:49,651 --> 00:36:53,080
indeed in in this movie,
they will be next to be sued.

703
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:58,650
So we put Warner Brothers on notice that
if this chapters included your movie,

704
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,950
you will get sued next and you know,
people out here,

705
00:37:02,951 --> 00:37:07,510
they don't want to step into a lawsuit.
That's the only thing that kept me from

706
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:12,130
being punched out in that movie and
portrayed me as a villain in that

707
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:13,060
frickin movie,

708
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,250
just to fill in way more than a villain.
Right?

709
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,720
I mean,
that is insane.

710
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,330
It is insane because what's.
What's crazy to me and what's

711
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:25,331
complicated about this is that there are
thousands and thousands of brave men and

712
00:37:25,971 --> 00:37:28,790
women who have risked their lives,
sacrifice their lives,

713
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,360
and this guy becomes.
This is for your head and where is he

714
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,300
rises above including me,
including you.

715
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,650
Yes,
very important,

716
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:44,310
but he rises above all of this and
becomes this iconic figure.

717
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,460
Yes.
This iconic figure that you can't

718
00:37:46,461 --> 00:37:50,840
tarnish and then the truth is irrelevant
and they're willing to sacrifice people

719
00:37:50,841 --> 00:37:55,520
like you and the truth just for this
overall image of patriotism.

720
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,680
Yup.
It's crazy.

721
00:37:57,681 --> 00:38:00,020
What a crazy place that must've been for
you

722
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,470
still is.
In fact,

723
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,770
do you know that this person that I told
you about,

724
00:38:05,771 --> 00:38:10,000
what the seizures,
the seizure disorders started right

725
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:14,860
after this.
I'm sure she didn't die from doctors

726
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:17,710
have said seizures can be caused by
stress.

727
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:23,640
So I hold Chris Kyle directly
responsible for the seizure disorder

728
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:26,650
also that I had to face that marijuana
cured.

729
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,690
Did you ever communicate with him face
to face?

730
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:30,160
Only one set.
The first,

731
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,960
uh,
when we first in June,

732
00:38:31,961 --> 00:38:34,130
I didn't even know who he was.
And then at,

733
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,750
in June of 12,
after the book came out in January,

734
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,030
we had a settlement conference where he
kept saying that if he met me in person,

735
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:47,290
we could work it out.
So at this conference we agreed I would

736
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,320
meet him in a room,
the judge in the corner and just ski and

737
00:38:50,321 --> 00:38:51,700
I,
like you and I are here.

738
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:56,020
We sat down in the room and I looked him
right in the face and I said,

739
00:38:56,021 --> 00:38:58,600
why did you do this?
You never punched me.

740
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,790
He looked me back and said,
yes I did.

741
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,740
I turned to the judge.
I said,

742
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,950
there's no need to go any farther.
I said,

743
00:39:05,951 --> 00:39:10,690
if he's not going to admit it didn't
happen face to face one on one and I

744
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:15,691
challenge his courage because yeah,
he had the courage to go to Iraq.

745
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,220
He had the courage to shoot all these
people,

746
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,740
but he didn't have the courage to tell
the truth.

747
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:23,890
Daddy,
what a bizarre moment that must have

748
00:39:23,891 --> 00:39:25,560
been sitting across from that guy.
Yeah,

749
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,070
and he looked at me and said,
yes,

750
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:29,050
I did.
What was the look in his face?

751
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,840
I believe,
and I'm not a doctor,

752
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:34,990
but I've done some studying.
I think he was a sociopath.

753
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,600
Sociopath can lie and hold a straight
face and they lie to the point where

754
00:39:40,601 --> 00:39:45,601
they believe their own lie.
How bizarre is it that this iconic

755
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:46,961
figure?
Well,

756
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:49,190
and then look how he died.
Yeah.

757
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:52,330
Well,
he had no training and posttraumatic

758
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,690
stress.
He's not medical and yet he's taking

759
00:39:55,691 --> 00:40:00,691
this marine to a gun range.
Who suffering from posttraumatic stress

760
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:06,330
wouldn't common sense tell you not to
put a weapon in the hands of someone

761
00:40:06,551 --> 00:40:09,580
suffering from posttraumatic stress.

762
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,590
Stress is different.
What do they tell him to man up?

763
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,360
Why would you put a weapon in somebody's
hands?

764
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:23,290
Who's suffering from posttraumatic
stress when you have no medical

765
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:28,110
training?
How is quite qualified to treat this

766
00:40:28,111 --> 00:40:28,640
guy?
Well,

767
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,360
I would assume it would be based on his
own posttraumatic stress,

768
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,760
but he didn't have it.
He didn't have it at all.

769
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:37,150
He was never treated for it.
He may have had it.

770
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:42,910
Maybe that's why he did what he did.
I don't know God,

771
00:40:42,911 --> 00:40:44,470
what a crazy place today,
but.

772
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:45,850
But the.
For me,

773
00:40:45,851 --> 00:40:48,580
it's like I've been accused of something
I didn't do.

774
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:50,320
I don't even know the guy.
Never.

775
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,720
I may have met him that night.
Briefly.

776
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:57,940
Let me some it.
I obviously didn't get a one 1000000th

777
00:40:57,941 --> 00:41:00,190
of a percent of the amount of hate that
you did,

778
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,820
but just read.
I got read off September 11th of this

779
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,640
year.
I was in New York doing this book tour

780
00:41:09,641 --> 00:41:12,640
and I got read off in a hotel lobby over
this.

781
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:13,930
What does that mean?
Read off?

782
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,500
A guy yelled and screamed at me in front
of the entire hotel lobby,

783
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,760
Jesus Christ.
That's what I live with now and I

784
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:26,200
haven't been damaged.
My reputation isn't damaged over

785
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:30,550
something I never did.
What I was gonna say is I obviously

786
00:41:30,551 --> 00:41:33,320
haven't experienced one,
1000000th of the hate that you have,

787
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:34,430
but I read.

788
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:37,850
We read this article on the air.
We were trying to figure out what

789
00:41:37,851 --> 00:41:42,110
happened when your case was going on,
and so we read this article that was,

790
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,150
I don't know,
it was in the New York Times,

791
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:48,230
see if he could find the article
detailing all the various lies.

792
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,800
Oh,
that's an Yorker magazine.

793
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,060
New Yorker in married.
They did an investigation of him,

794
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,130
but it's stunning and just reading that
the the fucking amount of hate tweets

795
00:41:58,131 --> 00:42:02,300
and facebook tweets and you fucking
coward and you this and knew that.

796
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:03,230
I'm like,
Hey,

797
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,700
I didn't write it.
Okay.

798
00:42:04,701 --> 00:42:06,950
I'm just trying to figure out what the
fuck is going on.

799
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,880
If someone puts something like that in
the New Yorker with verified claims.

800
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,080
I mean,
everything's verified.

801
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:15,380
What they were saying that he said and
what actually had happened was all

802
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:16,640
verified.
It's very,

803
00:42:16,641 --> 00:42:19,490
very,
very confusing that somehow or another

804
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:22,490
this slipped through the cracks and that
this became their iconic figure.

805
00:42:22,491 --> 00:42:25,910
Again,
not discounting along with you.

806
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,350
The thousands and thousands of patriotic
Americans that risked their lives

807
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,320
to.
Nobody's denying.

808
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,580
He wasn't a great sniper.
Nobody's denying he didn't do his job.

809
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:41,060
I've never denied that from him or said
that about him.

810
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,130
He,
he may be the best.

811
00:42:43,131 --> 00:42:45,770
I don't know.
I'll still put my money on Carlos half

812
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,520
cock though.
The marine as being the best sniper.

813
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,540
Well,
especially now,

814
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,870
but uh,
but uh,

815
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,140
he,
he did his job and he did it well,

816
00:42:54,141 --> 00:42:58,280
but why did he have to take an old
veteran that would be like me taking a

817
00:42:58,281 --> 00:43:00,860
world war guy and throwing him under the
bus.

818
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,620
Why the fuck would he choose you?
Because I had fame.

819
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:06,530
He,
I think he got jealous that night.

820
00:43:06,531 --> 00:43:09,860
We were at the bar because everyone
crowded around and wanted their picture

821
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:12,410
with me.
Wow.

822
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,970
I don't know.
He'll never be around.

823
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,220
Answer it.
I'd love to know why he picked out me.

824
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,970
I think because I'm probably the most
famous maybe,

825
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,990
or I develop to be the most famous seal
other than Dick Marcinko,

826
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:29,160
the rogue warrior.
Great books.

827
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,490
Read his books.
He's a friend of mine.

828
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:33,030
Richard Marcinko.
Yes.

829
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,060
Sat down and you're talking to this guy.
How much time were you actually in the

830
00:43:37,061 --> 00:43:37,760
room with them?

831
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,050
Oh,
a couple of minutes.

832
00:43:39,051 --> 00:43:41,540
Was all the minute.
The minute he looked me in the eye and

833
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:43,010
said,
I sure did he hit you.

834
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,320
I turned to the judge,
said,

835
00:43:45,321 --> 00:43:47,880
we got nothing more to talk about.
You didn't want it.

836
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,110
I offered him.
I said,

837
00:43:51,290 --> 00:43:56,290
if you will walk out to be with the
press and admit you fabricated this

838
00:43:56,331 --> 00:44:00,110
story,
I will forgive you in front of the press

839
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:04,160
and we will go on with our lives.
He would not do it.

840
00:44:04,161 --> 00:44:08,390
He did not have the courage to stand up
and tell the truth.

841
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,800
It takes a lot of courage to admit you
lied about something that massive.

842
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,600
I mean,
this isn't line about speeding,

843
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:14,543
right?
This is.

844
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,680
This is a massive,
massive.

845
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:19,800
What about ruining my life?
Ruining my reputation,

846
00:44:19,801 --> 00:44:24,801
ruining my wife's life route.
I lost my conspiracy theory show because

847
00:44:25,201 --> 00:44:28,620
of it real.
I can't get hired right now.

848
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:33,150
I can't get a job.
My last job on the Internet at Aura tv

849
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:36,330
because the owners Carlos slim from
Mexico.

850
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,690
From that you know who I'm hired.
Do you know who I work for now?

851
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:42,270
The Russians.
Russian TV.

852
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:44,430
Our,
the only people that will hire me

853
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:49,610
because 34 media conglomerate centered
this case to overturn me.

854
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:52,620
You think they're going to hire me now?
Explain that.

855
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,990
Why do you think they did that?
Do you think they did that?

856
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:59,580
Because if they overturn your case,
if they can somehow or another because

857
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:04,170
they don't want to check.
But is that it or is that discrediting

858
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:06,960
you in like that was a gigantic hit
movie.

859
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,720
But if they,
if they can discredit you,

860
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,300
it makes that movie still valuable.

861
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,350
Not only that,
it stops me from running for president.

862
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,160
Don't.
And if they can discredit me,

863
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,410
do you want to run for president?
I thought about it.

864
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:24,090
Even living in Mexico from Mexico would
have had to forsaken that.

865
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,900
That's why I didn't do it.
They know the,

866
00:45:26,901 --> 00:45:28,740
uh,
the reason why you didn't run for

867
00:45:28,741 --> 00:45:31,290
president because you had to have
forsaken live in New Mexico.

868
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:35,850
Now I might fucking when I know I,
I think I could have one.

869
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:38,310
No.
The Libertarians contacted me twice to

870
00:45:38,311 --> 00:45:40,760
come to their convention.
They wanted to nominate tessie,

871
00:45:40,761 --> 00:45:42,400
come back to America.
Com.

872
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,340
Ken and I chose not to do it because I
was up for the campaigning.

873
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:50,520
I was up to taking on,
taking on the damage and repubs,

874
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:52,980
but at this point,
at age 65,

875
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:57,981
I wasn't up to do the job for four years
where I'd have to it and my lifestyle

876
00:45:58,111 --> 00:46:00,940
and Mexico because people don't realize
when you take,

877
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:04,020
when you get one of them jobs like
president or governor,

878
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,660
your freedom leaves that day.

879
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,930
You don't have freedom.
You're 24 slash seven,

880
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:14,931
your body at 24 slash seven every day.
You have no freedom whatsoever.

881
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:19,230
I couldn't go in 100 percent on that and
I felt that if I,

882
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:23,820
if I to go for president,
you have to be 100 percent committed to

883
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:25,770
do the job.
If you're not,

884
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,370
you're cheating yourself and you're
cheating all the people that voted for

885
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:31,560
you.
If you're not 100 percent committed,

886
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,010
I could not reach 100 percent.
So I chose not to.

887
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,370
So is this because of your own personal
feelings about living in Mexico and

888
00:46:38,371 --> 00:46:43,371
having freedom and relaxation and
enjoying the quality of life and also I

889
00:46:44,011 --> 00:46:47,160
knew what would happen to me if I looked
like I was going to win,

890
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,220
I would be politically assassinated.
They would pull up everything they could

891
00:46:53,221 --> 00:46:54,410
on me.
You know,

892
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,750
one of the things they missed,
which I laugh about today when I ran for

893
00:46:57,751 --> 00:47:00,150
governor,
they never found it out and I've

894
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:04,680
admitted it so it'll show up now,
but they never found out because I'm

895
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:07,320
sure they would have tried to use it
even though it's irrelevant.

896
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,300
If I'd had gone for president,
they would have,

897
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:14,900
you know what that is,
but I used to be sergeant at arms of the

898
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:17,843
Mongols Motorcycle Club.
Really?

899
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:20,910
What does that mean?
Let's sergeant at arms.

900
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:24,720
He just the guy third in command,
the Mongols or I've watched some

901
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:29,440
fucking,
one of those really terrible news shows

902
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:30,090
where they do

903
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,500
reenactments of.
Well,

904
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:36,550
the Mongols are strong here in southern
California where the black and white.

905
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:39,070
We're the ones that fought war with the
hell.

906
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,750
What's the black and white?
That's our colors.

907
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:41,320
Oh,
okay.

908
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:45,460
The angels are red and white.
The Mongols are black and white guys

909
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:47,230
have shootouts with the angels
occasionally.

910
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,290
Do you have one of those jackets worthy?
Worthy?

911
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:51,970
Yeah.
I have that at home.

912
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,210
No.
I was an officer so I was allowed to

913
00:47:55,211 --> 00:47:56,920
keep mine.
So what does that mean?

914
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,300
Like what did you guys do at that time?
It was 1973.

915
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:04,600
I rode harleys and I was still in the
navy.

916
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,630
I used to leave the base and put my
colors on the went like sergeant at

917
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:10,511
arms.
What does that mean?

918
00:48:10,511 --> 00:48:11,860
You had to carry guns?
No.

919
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,960
Sergeant.
And you got the president of the

920
00:48:13,961 --> 00:48:15,760
chapter.
You got the vice president.

921
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,570
Third is the sergeant at arms,
fourth is the secretary is very

922
00:48:19,571 --> 00:48:20,290
militaristic.

923
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:22,030
Nobody wants to be the secretary.
Yeah,

924
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,730
you do.
That mentioned officer job,

925
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,810
you know,
but you keep track of all the money and

926
00:48:25,811 --> 00:48:27,670
stuff.
Well,

927
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:31,480
what the fuck the do like do you just
drive around bikes and party?

928
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:33,280
But why do you need all that,
uh,

929
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:36,270
those rankings and file and because
there,

930
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:37,780
because it's a club,
it's.

931
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:38,614
No,
it's,

932
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:39,700
it's like,
uh,

933
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,840
the,
the elks,

934
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:45,100
they have presidents of the elks club,
they have presidents of whatever other

935
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:49,420
stuff there is at the elks club.
Doesn't get any gang wars with the Moose

936
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,800
Club.
Well,

937
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:53,080
you never know.
You never know.

938
00:48:53,081 --> 00:48:57,190
They might have or know a turf war could
happen in the navy and the army,

939
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:02,140
like the elks and the Moose Club.
And in my day a lot of the outlaw bikers

940
00:49:02,141 --> 00:49:03,670
were former military.
Yes.

941
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,880
And that was a big thing with the hell's
angels because you can haul coming back,

942
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:10,590
you had your camaraderie,
Brotherhood if you wanted.

943
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,640
I did.
Felt disenfranchised.

944
00:49:12,641 --> 00:49:16,030
Right?
I did it more for the adventure I was

945
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,430
getting out of the seals.
I'd done two tours,

946
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,640
a 17 months in southeast Asia.
I was going to transition into private

947
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:25,390
life.
I was riding a Harley,

948
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,360
my two buddies that I'd written with a
year earlier.

949
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:31,870
We're now full patch Mongols when I came
back from my second deployment.

950
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:34,330
Let me,
let me pretend to be a douchebag

951
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,120
politician running against you here.
Yeah.

952
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:41,130
I would say are you really prepared to
have a former sergeant of arms from the

953
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,620
Mongols Motorcycle club running the
United States of America?

954
00:49:47,621 --> 00:49:49,450
I don't think so.
Ladies and gentlemen.

955
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,430
And I would counter that and say nobody
messes with the Mongols.

956
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,160
Nobody will mess with the US.
Wow.

957
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,920
That's,
um,

958
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,700
that's.
People didn't mess with the Mongols

959
00:49:59,710 --> 00:50:01,960
though.
And you don't really know that I would

960
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,270
have to help you.
Let's not do that.

961
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,133
No,
they don't.

962
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:06,790
They do mess with the Mongols,
right?

963
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,670
Don't they have warrants something if
those guys have,

964
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:11,650
don't they shoot it out and like Texas
steak houses and Shit,

965
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:15,720
didn't they have flexible hours?
Which ours was Harrah's nightclub and

966
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:16,600
uh,
in,

967
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,850
uh,
Nevada law.

968
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:19,691
That was.
Yeah.

969
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:21,250
When was that?
That was back in.

970
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,590
Oh yeah.
But there was a big one a couple of

971
00:50:23,591 --> 00:50:24,424
years ago.
Right?

972
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:25,460
Not with,
not with,

973
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,990
with the Mongols.
With us,

974
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:28,041
you're saying,
oh,

975
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,360
so you're still with them?
Huh?

976
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,670
They're like a marine.
You're a marine for life,

977
00:50:31,671 --> 00:50:33,050
that kind of thing.
You got a card on you.

978
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:35,300
What are you just going to pull out his
God damn on gold card.

979
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:38,060
I don't believe this.
When he got in there,

980
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,760
it's got a wallet.
He's going to pull out a Mongo card.

981
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:42,020
Let's see.
Right.

982
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:45,120
Next is Disneyland Year Pass.
Oh,

983
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:46,450
let me see here.
I've got to.

984
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:48,080
Got to Disneyland.
I got to find it.

985
00:50:48,081 --> 00:50:50,180
No,
cause I tuck it away.

986
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,710
No,
I actually.

987
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:57,410
You have a Mongo card?
I would think that you would need a

988
00:50:57,411 --> 00:50:58,640
tattoo.
I would say.

989
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:01,700
Listen Bitch,
if you really want to be down for life,

990
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,590
we're going to get.
Get a tattoo.

991
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,020
I already have a tattoo of the Mongols.
No,

992
00:51:07,010 --> 00:51:09,840
what is it like a UDP tattoos?
I have to try.

993
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:11,710
The Budweiser Tried Trident and uh,

994
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:16,690
you try and find your Mongo card.
How many of those cards you actually

995
00:51:16,691 --> 00:51:19,390
heard mine look at that.
And there's the card from Geo.

996
00:51:19,391 --> 00:51:22,890
The Hollywood press gave me his last
time I saw on Bam.

997
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:26,890
Motherfuckers legit,
too legit to quit.

998
00:51:27,010 --> 00:51:30,040
That's hilarious.
That is hilarious.

999
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,470
And My name was,
I dunno.

1000
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,850
What was your name?
Find it on there.

1001
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,000
You never go by your real name?
Superman.

1002
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,230
Superman.
Super.

1003
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,320
Why did they call you superman?

1004
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,850
Because I was in such a physical
specimen that when I was prospecting,

1005
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:49,880
they make you do pushups and stuff and I
liked it.

1006
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,210
Oh,
so this is back in the Jesse before the

1007
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:54,240
Jesse.
The body Ventura,

1008
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:56,180
yeah.
This was back when I was transitioning

1009
00:51:56,181 --> 00:52:01,181
out of the shields into civilian life
and in fact if there's a good transition

1010
00:52:01,371 --> 00:52:06,371
I can tell you about that shows how a
book should do due diligence before they

1011
00:52:07,311 --> 00:52:10,880
write something.
There was a book written by William

1012
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,480
Queen and atf agent who infiltrated the
Mongols.

1013
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:19,670
It's called under in the loan and he
infiltrated them and put like 25 of them

1014
00:52:19,671 --> 00:52:21,080
in prison.
Well,

1015
00:52:21,081 --> 00:52:25,280
in the book they wrote that I was a
former Mongol governor,

1016
00:52:25,281 --> 00:52:27,370
Jesse Ventura,
Blahblahblahblahblah Blah.

1017
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,220
Right,
right.

1018
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,120
You know what they did before the book
was published,

1019
00:52:31,121 --> 00:52:34,100
a sent me an entire copy of the book.
They should.

1020
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,380
Governor,
please read this and if you have any

1021
00:52:36,381 --> 00:52:37,700
problems,
call us.

1022
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:39,200
Show.
I read the book.

1023
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:42,080
I didn't hide from the fact that I was
in the Mongols.

1024
00:52:42,350 --> 00:52:46,670
I never do a.
But I did want them to change something

1025
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:48,440
and they did.
When I called them,

1026
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:51,440
I said,
you stated the history of the Mongols

1027
00:52:51,441 --> 00:52:56,441
that we started off like all white
supremist outlaw motorcycle clubs.

1028
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,320
I said,
I would never join anything that was

1029
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:02,720
white supremist.
I said to me,

1030
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:07,010
a biker is a lifestyle and the color of
your skin has nothing to do with it.

1031
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,160
And I said,
and the Mongols were not white

1032
00:53:10,161 --> 00:53:12,350
supremacy.
And she said to me,

1033
00:53:12,351 --> 00:53:13,184
well,
governor,

1034
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,340
how can you prove that?
I started laughing.

1035
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:18,350
I said,
I think I can prove it easily.

1036
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:20,900
She goes,
tell me their stay editor at random

1037
00:53:20,901 --> 00:53:22,430
house.
I said,

1038
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:25,950
at what time did Mexicans become white
supremacy?

1039
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,950
Because I said the Mongols are 75
percent Latino,

1040
00:53:28,951 --> 00:53:29,784
Mexican.

1041
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,530
I was one of the few white guys who
could ride into east la and never be

1042
00:53:34,531 --> 00:53:38,580
bothered because of my patch.
Uh,

1043
00:53:38,581 --> 00:53:41,250
so how can you call us what the Mongols
started?

1044
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,160
Because they weren't,
Mexicans weren't allowed in the hell's

1045
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:46,230
angels.
See,

1046
00:53:46,231 --> 00:53:49,890
I sold like this.
So the Mongols were the Mexican bikers

1047
00:53:49,891 --> 00:53:53,550
started their own bike club because they
weren't allowed to be angels.

1048
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:58,440
Will they allow white guys?
But how did they miss that in writing

1049
00:53:58,441 --> 00:54:02,340
the book?
That seems stupid that it's any better,

1050
00:54:02,370 --> 00:54:05,160
but that seems like a giant error.
It was.

1051
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,430
That's why I had them pull out white
supremacy.

1052
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:11,730
I said,
and she started laughing when I said,

1053
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:13,890
well,
I've never met a Mexican white

1054
00:54:13,891 --> 00:54:15,120
supremacy,
have you?

1055
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,381
She said,
no,

1056
00:54:16,381 --> 00:54:17,970
I haven't either.
I said,

1057
00:54:17,971 --> 00:54:20,820
well,
we're 75 percent Latino Mexican.

1058
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,171
She goes,
really?

1059
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,750
I said yes.
And I gave her the history.

1060
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:29,370
The Mongols started because the hell's
angels wouldn't allow Mexicans.

1061
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:33,420
That's hilarious.
And that's how the Mongols got started

1062
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:38,480
in 1970 because they're 75 percent
Latino Mexican,

1063
00:54:38,821 --> 00:54:41,040
but they didn't have the same.
You could be white,

1064
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:45,690
you know,
I was a minority in the Mongols to know.

1065
00:54:45,691 --> 00:54:48,210
Was there crime involved in the Mongols?
I don't know,

1066
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:51,360
doing it,
like I told them I was still in the navy

1067
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:54,450
and they used to protect me whenever
we'd have church,

1068
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,130
trash churches meeting,
they call it church and whenever we'd

1069
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:00,470
have church,
uh,

1070
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,540
if it got to anything that was at all
illegal,

1071
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,510
my pres would send me out to watch the
bikes.

1072
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,000
That's fucking weird.
Well,

1073
00:55:09,001 --> 00:55:09,720
they knew.
No,

1074
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,300
they knew I was in the military.
Yeah,

1075
00:55:11,301 --> 00:55:12,570
I finished.
Doubles are too,

1076
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:14,640
you know,
because I'd faced double.

1077
00:55:14,641 --> 00:55:17,400
I'd face military justice as well as
civilian.

1078
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:20,790
A lot of these guys are old military.
They did it to protect me.

1079
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,180
I appreciate that.
But didn't feel bizarre to you to be a

1080
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:27,060
part of a group that was probably doing
some illegal shit.

1081
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:29,190
No,
because I thought at least I won't go to

1082
00:55:29,191 --> 00:55:30,024
jail.

1083
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:34,110
Not Me,
because I don't know nothing about it

1084
00:55:34,111 --> 00:55:36,630
and he didn't care.
You love them no matter what I loved

1085
00:55:36,631 --> 00:55:38,700
riding are.
You should see what I'd get pulled over.

1086
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:43,200
We get pulled over by the CHP,
California highway patrol back then and

1087
00:55:43,201 --> 00:55:47,490
I'd pull out my active duty military id
and they'd look at me.

1088
00:55:47,491 --> 00:55:51,060
And what are you doing with these guys?
I said they liked to ride bikes.

1089
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:54,420
So do I can't just ride a bike by
herself?

1090
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,740
No.
No,

1091
00:55:55,741 --> 00:56:00,370
because cars have no respect for you.
So you're right by your writing.

1092
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:04,170
If you're riding and looking like you
showed what they're up on the screen a

1093
00:56:04,171 --> 00:56:07,110
little while ago,
you think the cars are going to bother

1094
00:56:07,111 --> 00:56:08,340
you?
They're going to get the fuck out of

1095
00:56:08,341 --> 00:56:09,420
your way.
It's right.

1096
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,350
Oh,
that's interesting.

1097
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,410
Well
wow.

1098
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:16,020
And d still put on jackets and still get
on the Harley.

1099
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,160
Yeah,
except the Aina.

1100
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,750
Harley.
What do you ride now?

1101
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:23,100
I ride a custom chopper that I had built
and it turned out there's not one harley

1102
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:26,860
thing on it.
I have an ss one slash 24 engine,

1103
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:32,040
which is bigger than anything.
Harley's got v twin by ss out and Viola

1104
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,820
Wisconsin.
Uh,

1105
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:37,120
I,
I have an ss 1:24 cubic inches.

1106
00:56:37,121 --> 00:56:40,680
The biggest Harley I think is 102 CD
drive.

1107
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:41,890
This around Mexico?
No,

1108
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:45,250
I drive it in Minnesota and uh,
and I have a,

1109
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,580
it's a rolling thunder frame.
Arlen ness,

1110
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:51,290
front end and primary cover,
a ref tech,

1111
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,590
a six speed transmission,
curiosity and gears.

1112
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,140
It turned out when I built the whole
chopper in the end,

1113
00:56:59,141 --> 00:57:02,470
there wasn't one thing Harley on it.
Is that good?

1114
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:05,290
I don't know.
It's all custom made notes.

1115
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,660
I put the old sissy bar that goes way
up.

1116
00:57:07,661 --> 00:57:10,780
I made a.
I made a custom bike to these things.

1117
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:12,640
The APE hangers.
You do that?

1118
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:13,340
Yeah.
I got the.

1119
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:15,340
A pen or some others?
No,

1120
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:17,260
mine aren't that high miner about right
here.

1121
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:18,730
Right here.
Seems logical.

1122
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,170
Yeah.
That seems logical.

1123
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,970
These guys know I don't go that high,
but I haven't extended front end.

1124
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:28,310
Why did they do that though?
With the up up high handlebars be cool,

1125
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:30,040
but you can't steer.
It doesn't matter.

1126
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,570
It does.
It does.

1127
00:57:31,571 --> 00:57:34,060
If you have to get that thing to an
outline,

1128
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,540
not to us.
And through us,

1129
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,400
it's all about man,
Mr. No,

1130
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,430
it's all about being cool.
I get it.

1131
00:57:42,431 --> 00:57:44,680
But you're a bunch of things like sissy
bars,

1132
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:46,780
you don't have them today.
The guys who built the bike didn't even

1133
00:57:46,781 --> 00:57:48,130
know what they were.
What's the sissy bar?

1134
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,140
That's the bar that sticks up high in
the back.

1135
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,010
Oh,
okay.

1136
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:52,350
Well yeah,
that's.

1137
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,200
They call it.
So you don't slide off the seats.

1138
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,090
But she to me,
I don't like saddlebags shore Sushi

1139
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:01,240
bars.
The replacement.

1140
00:58:01,241 --> 00:58:04,480
I'm going to bungee anything I need to
take with me on the Sissy Bar,

1141
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:09,481
like the sleeping bag and anything else.
You're taking a bungee it to the sissy

1142
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:12,470
bar for when you drive down the road
because I don't dig saddlebags.

1143
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:14,500
So you'll drive down the road to go
camping somewhere?

1144
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:15,790
No,
I wrote,

1145
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,830
actually I rode when I got out of
office.

1146
00:58:17,831 --> 00:58:21,700
I wrote all over Minnesota fly in my
colors and no one even recognize me.

1147
00:58:21,701 --> 00:58:25,480
You know why?
Why I went to a place I had a full beard

1148
00:58:25,481 --> 00:58:30,481
after I taught at Harvard and so Johnny
Depp had come out and in Captain Jack

1149
00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:33,880
Sparrow.
So I went to a place with a pitcher and

1150
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:36,010
I says,
can you make my beard look like that?

1151
00:58:36,011 --> 00:58:36,641
And they go,
sure.

1152
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:39,010
So they braided my preamble when you
were doing that.

1153
00:58:39,010 --> 00:58:39,970
All the braids,
right.

1154
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:43,180
But then they talked me into letting me
put dreadlocks.

1155
00:58:43,181 --> 00:58:47,650
They sold them into my hair and they
dyed my hair jet black.

1156
00:58:47,870 --> 00:58:50,950
I had dreadlocks to hear the thing like
that.

1157
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,850
I rode one year after I was out of
office,

1158
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:58,630
I drove all over Minnesota with
dreadlocks to my shoulders.

1159
00:58:58,631 --> 00:59:00,910
The beard,
no helmet because we don't have a

1160
00:59:00,911 --> 00:59:04,480
helmet.
Law and people were locking their doors.

1161
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:07,120
I had my Mongo colors on and here I'm
the governor.

1162
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:12,850
It was great.
Never recognized as so never recovered

1163
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,370
because I had dreadlocks.
They gave me all the way to the

1164
00:59:15,371 --> 00:59:17,500
shoulders.
Now why are you riding around with no

1165
00:59:17,501 --> 00:59:19,270
helmet on?
Why?

1166
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,900
Because you don't have to in Minnesota.
Yeah,

1167
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:22,640
but why wouldn't you want to protect
your head?

1168
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:24,350
Ah,
I don't like helmets.

1169
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,710
I don't think they should be mandatory.
I think something far more.

1170
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:28,970
You know what?
I laugh at what?

1171
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,990
When you see someone wearing a helmet
and riding a bike with tennis shoes,

1172
00:59:34,130 --> 00:59:39,130
it's far more important to have over the
ankle boots as a biker than a helmet

1173
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,950
wise that you feet touched the ground.
What's the.

1174
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:46,250
What's going to stable you?
If you start sliding out your foot,

1175
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,380
right?
You don't want tennis shoes.

1176
00:59:48,381 --> 00:59:50,660
You want an over the ankle laced up
boots,

1177
00:59:51,370 --> 00:59:55,370
so your boot or something dump.
You'll be able to protect your head.

1178
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,530
I don't know,
but I.

1179
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:00,370
it's a choice of freedom,
but what about when a little skullcap

1180
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:02,560
jammies that go like a hat?
What if?

1181
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:05,400
What if my head starts itching?
Tasers.

1182
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:06,263
Christ.
Scratch it.

1183
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,090
No,
you got to rub the helmet.

1184
01:00:08,091 --> 01:00:10,220
That's why when you see a biker rubbing
his helmet,

1185
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:13,470
it's because his head's itch and what?
We'll just look at me,

1186
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,230
put it to worry about an itch.

1187
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,040
Wait,
I'll accept helmets on motorcycles when

1188
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:22,880
they make people in convertibles that
don't have roll bars.

1189
01:00:22,881 --> 01:00:25,190
Have to wear them.
I have a convertible.

1190
01:00:25,191 --> 01:00:27,470
It doesn't have a robot.
Then you should have to wear a helmet.

1191
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:30,350
It's good point.
What if you roll that car and you don't

1192
01:00:30,351 --> 01:00:32,450
have a helmet on?
It's a very good point.

1193
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:33,970
There you go.
I think about skills.

1194
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:38,200
So the day that you got to have a roll
bar is the day I'll put the helmet.

1195
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:39,310
All right buddy.
Relax.

1196
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:44,150
And I can't wait to see these women in
Beverly Hills with their convertible

1197
01:00:44,151 --> 01:00:48,650
Mercedes having to put helmets on.
Well those actually have roll bars built

1198
01:00:48,651 --> 01:00:50,170
in.
They pop up on one wheel,

1199
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,740
goes off the ground.
And if you know about that.

1200
01:00:52,130 --> 01:00:53,660
German engineering.
Yeah,

1201
01:00:53,661 --> 01:00:54,650
they're very.
They're on the ball.

1202
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,370
Well I owned Porsche portion on Abbott.
What do you mean portia doesn't have it?

1203
01:00:58,370 --> 01:01:01,850
What year?
I got a 2000 and a 2003.

1204
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:03,780
You.
So you have a nine,

1205
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,150
nine,
six?

1206
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:05,630
No,
I.

1207
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:08,360
well I have a,
I have a boxster s and I have the twin

1208
01:01:08,361 --> 01:01:09,770
turbo.
Okay.

1209
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:12,320
Well that should have that built in.
It should have it.

1210
01:01:12,321 --> 01:01:14,660
So when I'm a hard worker,
I'm a hard top though.

1211
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,290
I'm a boxster.
Know the twin turbos a hard top.

1212
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:18,861
Yeah.
Right.

1213
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:19,970
Okay.
That doesn't have a roll bar.

1214
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:20,900
Yeah.
But you,

1215
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,820
you have a voxster Yep.
The boxer,

1216
01:01:22,830 --> 01:01:24,770
she'd have something.
It has something.

1217
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:26,270
Yeah.
Because anything.

1218
01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:30,920
I think anything past the nineties
that's a convertible has some sort of a

1219
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:33,660
built in Rollbar or some sort of report
or seen it?

1220
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:35,480
Yeah.
Well you haven't flipped it,

1221
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,520
but the new ones that I'm getting rid
of,

1222
01:01:37,521 --> 01:01:39,230
both of them.
I'm buying a tesla.

1223
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,370
Oh,
you're getting crazy.

1224
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:43,070
Go into Tesla.
Test drove a tesla.

1225
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,270
It's unbelievable.
Oh,

1226
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:46,110
they're amazing.
Oh yeah.

1227
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:49,610
I and I want to feel young.
It's a computer driven car.

1228
01:01:49,611 --> 01:01:51,530
No gas.
That makes you feel young.

1229
01:01:51,830 --> 01:01:54,230
Yeah,
because I grew up in the sixties with

1230
01:01:54,231 --> 01:01:59,090
all the muscle cars and I never dreamed
there'd be electric cars that can beat

1231
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:03,770
any combustible engine out there off the
line because the Tesla can beat

1232
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:05,180
anything.
Pretty much.

1233
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:06,040
Yeah.
My,

1234
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:10,700
my twin turbo professionally driven will
do zero to 60 in two nine.

1235
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:14,630
The Tesla does it into six
unprofessionally driven.

1236
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,200
Yeah.
No,

1237
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,180
they're ridiculous.
Ridiculously fast.

1238
01:02:17,181 --> 01:02:18,170
Yeah.
It's called,

1239
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:20,730
you know what they call?
It's called the ludicrous option.

1240
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,860
Took it right out of spaceballs.
Yeah.

1241
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,930
Ludicrous.
The guy's got a sense of humor.

1242
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,930
He definitely does the ludicrous option,
but no,

1243
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:30,840
I and see I'm going to do my house in
Minnesota,

1244
01:02:30,841 --> 01:02:35,841
totally solar and I'm going to do it to
where it's 105 percent so that way I can

1245
01:02:36,721 --> 01:02:41,721
also feel my car's up off the sun so I
will be completely off any type in my

1246
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:47,970
home or my cars will all be powered in
Mexico and Minnesota by the sun.

1247
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,980
That's excluding my cars.
That's awesome.

1248
01:02:49,981 --> 01:02:51,480
As long as you don't have to go on a big
road trip,

1249
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,260
they now have it.
It's all computerized to where you can

1250
01:02:55,261 --> 01:02:59,250
show where you can charge up again and
they're getting 300 miles now to

1251
01:02:59,251 --> 01:03:01,860
recharge and you know,
what else is great about the Tesla?

1252
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:02,970
Well,
it depends how you drive.

1253
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:04,800
You know,
what else is great.

1254
01:03:04,801 --> 01:03:07,320
Is there a warranty?
Eight years,

1255
01:03:07,321 --> 01:03:10,470
unlimited mileage,
and in that eight year period,

1256
01:03:10,710 --> 01:03:15,240
any improvements made to the car.
You get free upgrades like digital

1257
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:17,880
upgrades,
anything that's amazing for eight years,

1258
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:20,370
so eight.
You could own the Tesla for eight years

1259
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:24,150
and some doing an ad for them.
You could own a Tesla for eight years

1260
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:27,810
and the car you own eight years from now
will be identical to whatever they're

1261
01:03:27,811 --> 01:03:29,010
selling new.
Yeah.

1262
01:03:29,011 --> 01:03:31,740
I drove one for a day.
There's a a.

1263
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,360
What does that fucking company called?

1264
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:34,141
Skirt?
Yeah.

1265
01:03:34,141 --> 01:03:37,470
There's a company called skirt and they.
It's like a uber for rentals.

1266
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:40,170
They deliver a rental.
You drive for a day or what?

1267
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,960
As long as you need it,
and my issue was at the battery.

1268
01:03:42,961 --> 01:03:45,300
Just ran out way too quick for me for
what I do.

1269
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:46,500
I just do too many.
For me.

1270
01:03:46,501 --> 01:03:50,550
It ain't because I live in Minnesota and
I never drive over 100 miles in a day.

1271
01:03:51,390 --> 01:03:53,790
Right.
Golf course and that far right.

1272
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:56,410
I get it.
I know for me in my lab,

1273
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,860
65 now,
I don't need to be trapped.

1274
01:03:58,861 --> 01:04:00,690
I've never.
Do you know something that'll shock you?

1275
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:03,750
I've never owned a cell phone and I
never will.

1276
01:04:04,770 --> 01:04:06,000
I was going to text you.
I,

1277
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:09,210
you can't.
I don't have a cell phone.

1278
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,250
I've never given.
You don't have a cell phone for what?

1279
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:14,220
I like talking to people.
Are you kidding?

1280
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,820
I was out in New York,
I was out in New York doing this book

1281
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:22,350
tour and I forget I was at serious and
we were in the green room and there were

1282
01:04:22,351 --> 01:04:27,210
10 people in that green room.
Nine of the 10 sat there the whole time

1283
01:04:27,211 --> 01:04:28,990
doing things with a phone.
Right.

1284
01:04:29,070 --> 01:04:34,070
I was the only one who sat and looked
around the room and watched nine other

1285
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:39,951
people zeroed in on a screen,
which if you count TV and that what we

1286
01:04:41,581 --> 01:04:44,820
spending 16 hours a day now looking at
screens,

1287
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:47,340
I believe in evolution.
What's that going to lead to?

1288
01:04:48,660 --> 01:04:51,020
It's going to lead to some strange times
for sure.

1289
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,420
But a strange people to.
But wouldn't you rather just have it and

1290
01:04:54,421 --> 01:04:56,250
have the discipline and not use it?
No.

1291
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,320
No,
just fiber one.

1292
01:04:58,321 --> 01:05:02,190
I never took typing.
So if I'm going to send anything it'll

1293
01:05:02,191 --> 01:05:03,270
take me too long.

1294
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,840
The thumbs when I taught,
when I taught at Harvard,

1295
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,860
uh,
I actually sent my only email there to a

1296
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:13,330
student because on email he will always
lie.

1297
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:14,910
Ended up,
I send a couple,

1298
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:19,630
but they actually taught me how to use
computer while I was teaching at Harvard

1299
01:05:19,631 --> 01:05:23,920
in my office and I actually students
would want to talk to me so I'd have to

1300
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:28,921
line up a schedule and I actually,
I sent an email to a student or I told

1301
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:32,740
them,
this is the first email Jesse Ventura's

1302
01:05:32,741 --> 01:05:36,670
ever sent in his life.
Do with it as you see fit?

1303
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,890
I'll Betcha the students still got it.
Knowing that I have the first email.

1304
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:45,340
Jesse Ventura ever sand.
That's when I left Harvard.

1305
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:48,270
There went the computer.
I haven't done it since.

1306
01:05:48,271 --> 01:05:50,320
I don't have a computer.
My wife does.

1307
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:52,660
Wow.
She does all that.

1308
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:55,510
I don't.
So that's probably one of the main

1309
01:05:55,511 --> 01:05:57,520
reasons why this whole Chris Kyle thing
blew up.

1310
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,770
And you had no idea about it.
I was in Mexico.

1311
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,420
In Mexico.
You don't have any internet?

1312
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:02,890
No.
I have Internet there.

1313
01:06:02,891 --> 01:06:04,180
Yeah,
that's how I learned.

1314
01:06:04,181 --> 01:06:07,180
My son sent me an email telling me about
what happened.

1315
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,650
So you had an email?
Yeah,

1316
01:06:08,651 --> 01:06:12,640
and I have skype so I had to end up
getting through that satellite.

1317
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:17,730
I had to get my attorney to file the
lawsuit immediately to stop him from

1318
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:19,490
from this story,
but he.

1319
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:22,150
They continued promoting it for another
six months.

1320
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:24,670
In fact,
you know how bad the book company did.

1321
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:28,390
Harper Collins,
who's the same company that owns Fox

1322
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:30,040
News,
they're all under the same umbrella.

1323
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,240
Harper Collins,
if you would have typed my name and on

1324
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:36,550
the Internet,
would have immediately sent you to the

1325
01:06:36,551 --> 01:06:40,930
Chris Kyle Story.
They did that to sell more books.

1326
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,980
Wow.
See the conspiracy that I went against

1327
01:06:44,981 --> 01:06:46,900
in this deal.
Now I got to go through it again.

1328
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,760
Well,
it's so long ago.

1329
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:50,410
It's so crazy that it's still going on.
I mean,

1330
01:06:50,411 --> 01:06:51,730
this is 2012,
right?

1331
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:56,080
Yeah.
It happened in 2012 and it's now 2016.

1332
01:06:56,081 --> 01:06:58,850
It's over four years.
It'll be.

1333
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:03,370
It'll be five years in January.
How do you stay calm and all this does.

1334
01:07:03,371 --> 01:07:07,690
Is it this stress lessened at all or no?
What are the consequences for you?

1335
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:12,691
If you lose a financially it's cost me
over a million dollars.

1336
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:16,840
Jesus.
No one's while I'm the plaintiff.

1337
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:21,160
No one pays for me.
It's cost me over a million dollars for

1338
01:07:21,161 --> 01:07:25,480
years of attorney fees and the courts
and everything that's gone with it.

1339
01:07:25,481 --> 01:07:27,730
It's cost me a million dollars to clear
my name.

1340
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:29,680
Now.
If I had done this,

1341
01:07:29,681 --> 01:07:33,460
why would I do that?
Never happened.

1342
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,640
Why would I spend a million dollars in
court clearing my name has over time

1343
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:43,900
when more information has come out about
the other things that he said that

1344
01:07:43,901 --> 01:07:44,920
turned out to not be true.

1345
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:48,010
Has Public opinion started to shift
towards your way?

1346
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,350
It has now.
Someone has to somewhat,

1347
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:54,820
but you still have these people who will
accost me in hotels had happened in

1348
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:59,410
Mexico to what happened when a person
came up to me in a hotel lobby and read

1349
01:07:59,411 --> 01:08:01,540
me off and what do you say?
I say,

1350
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:05,620
but I didn't do it and all I'm doing is
seeking the truth.

1351
01:08:05,621 --> 01:08:08,110
You don't want to leave.
They don't keep it going after the

1352
01:08:08,111 --> 01:08:09,690
family says that,
yeah,

1353
01:08:09,970 --> 01:08:13,360
they think I'm going after the family,
which the family isn't going to lose a

1354
01:08:13,370 --> 01:08:16,910
nickel.
It's a big insurance that I'm fighting

1355
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:19,200
hired.
Anybody knows this,

1356
01:08:19,201 --> 01:08:23,900
this read a Britain a book,
because in your contract it states if

1357
01:08:23,901 --> 01:08:27,950
any lawsuits come of this nature,
the publisher will handle it.

1358
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:29,300
Right?
The publisher handles it,

1359
01:08:29,301 --> 01:08:32,390
but there is there any consequences to
the family where they don't profit as

1360
01:08:32,391 --> 01:08:34,250
much because of the fact there's a
lawsuit.

1361
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,590
The lawsuit cuts back in the profits for
the book and the movie?

1362
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:39,380
No,
because the insurance company will pay

1363
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:42,950
the whole lawsuit.
It seems to me where they hire and they

1364
01:08:42,951 --> 01:08:47,000
hire them before the books ever even
written errors and omissions,

1365
01:08:47,001 --> 01:08:47,560
right?
Yeah.

1366
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:48,393
What?
Yeah,

1367
01:08:48,610 --> 01:08:52,340
and show no,
it won't affect an anything in the

1368
01:08:52,341 --> 01:08:56,580
lawsuit itself won't effect the
popularity of the book unless unless

1369
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,980
they find out he was a liar and don't
choose to read his book because I've

1370
01:09:00,981 --> 01:09:03,380
never read his book.
Why would I?

1371
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:07,280
He wrote a lie about me.
How could I believe anything else in it?

1372
01:09:09,290 --> 01:09:11,310
What a terrible position to be in.
Oh yeah.

1373
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:14,420
Especially when you're innocent,
not just innocent,

1374
01:09:14,421 --> 01:09:19,421
but you are either respected celebrity
in his sixties in this happens.

1375
01:09:21,350 --> 01:09:23,240
This is.
It's kind of a crazy feeling.

1376
01:09:23,470 --> 01:09:25,940
Yeah.
Especially when you didn't do nothing.

1377
01:09:25,941 --> 01:09:27,110
What else could you have done?
I mean,

1378
01:09:27,140 --> 01:09:29,870
it's almost like you have to go to court
over this.

1379
01:09:29,930 --> 01:09:33,950
I had to.
It was such an iconic movie and such an

1380
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:36,050
iconic thing.
Have you ever talked to Bradley Cooper?

1381
01:09:36,140 --> 01:09:38,520
No,
I don't hold nothing against him.

1382
01:09:39,530 --> 01:09:41,420
Of course he shouldn't have hector doing
a job.

1383
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:45,440
Now you know my friend directed at Clint
Eastwood.

1384
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:48,200
He's a friend of mine in Christ.
And what did you talk to clint?

1385
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:50,060
No,
Jesus.

1386
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:53,510
No.
The whole thing is so fucked up.

1387
01:09:54,310 --> 01:09:58,070
It's just so crazy that you sat across
the table from this guy and he tells you

1388
01:09:58,071 --> 01:09:58,850
he did it.

1389
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,190
He tells you I did punch you.
Yeah.

1390
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:04,220
And I know he didn't and I know he
didn't have the courage to face up to

1391
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:06,680
the truth or,
or mental capability of him.

1392
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:08,690
Wouldn't let him.
I don't know what it was.

1393
01:10:08,720 --> 01:10:10,740
Something wrong.
Something wrong.

1394
01:10:10,810 --> 01:10:13,010
Some fuse blown.
So I don't know.

1395
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:15,830
I don't know.
But why would you take one of your own

1396
01:10:15,831 --> 01:10:19,100
and throw them under the bus?
Would be like me doing it to a World War

1397
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,510
II guy.
Just fucking crazy,

1398
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,360
you know,
and especially I like to tell people,

1399
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:25,940
you know,
remember us Vietnam veterans,

1400
01:10:25,941 --> 01:10:29,420
we weren't cheered.
We got blamed for the war in which is a

1401
01:10:29,421 --> 01:10:31,340
big part of what the hell's angels was
all about.

1402
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,710
Trying to find comradery in another
group,

1403
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,910
but we got blamed.
The politicians blamed us for the war

1404
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:40,670
and the public sentiment here in that
country.

1405
01:10:40,671 --> 01:10:45,671
At that time we were baby killers.
We were all these horrible vial you guys

1406
01:10:47,031 --> 01:10:51,380
got spit on when they came home and it
was the first time in history in the

1407
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,930
United States history that veterans came
back and were treated that way.

1408
01:10:54,770 --> 01:10:59,770
Whereas every guy will tell you this for
10 years I didn't even acknowledge I was

1409
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:00,980
a Vietnam vet.

1410
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:03,293
Wow.

1411
01:11:05,250 --> 01:11:09,570
Because you didn't even acknowledge it.
No one wanted to know you were.

1412
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:12,300
Nobody said,
welcome home to you.

1413
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:14,190
Nobody.
Thank you.

1414
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:16,980
These IRAC guys,
they get parades for them.

1415
01:11:17,430 --> 01:11:20,810
So interesting because it seems like in
that sense they got that right.

1416
01:11:20,811 --> 01:11:23,900
At least at least.
It's not like the way the Vietnam

1417
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:26,430
veterans were treated,
but this,

1418
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,630
this fucking story just doesn't sit
right with me.

1419
01:11:29,631 --> 01:11:32,570
It's just horrible.
It's so uncomfortable.

1420
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:37,130
It's so uncomfortable because how would
you like to have lived it for five years

1421
01:11:37,131 --> 01:11:38,780
like I have,
I couldn't imagine,

1422
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:44,110
but what's so uncomfortable about it is
that I feel like the sentiment behind

1423
01:11:44,961 --> 01:11:49,310
the movie and the public's perception of
the movie and the public's,

1424
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:54,380
the public's love and gratitude towards
him and the rest of the military was to

1425
01:11:54,381 --> 01:11:57,920
me like a a,
an amazing moment in a lot of ways.

1426
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:01,260
It's like people.
People wanted to let me get.

1427
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,480
Let me,
let me give you a different perspective

1428
01:12:04,481 --> 01:12:05,470
for a moment.
[inaudible].

1429
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:09,880
I talked about this on my internet show.
Who's more powerful?

1430
01:12:09,881 --> 01:12:13,940
God or government?
A government.

1431
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:15,670
You want to know why?
Yeah,

1432
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:18,920
well,
God says something very simple.

1433
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:23,600
Thous shalt not kill.
There's no asterisks by it.

1434
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:26,120
There's no except for this reason or
that reason.

1435
01:12:26,121 --> 01:12:28,370
It's simple.
Thou shalt not kill,

1436
01:12:28,670 --> 01:12:33,320
but yet you can kill at the behest of
government and it's okay.

1437
01:12:34,210 --> 01:12:35,450
Yeah,
it's super complicated.

1438
01:12:35,510 --> 01:12:36,380
Okay,
wait,

1439
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,030
and if and if you kill a bunch of people
at the behest of government,

1440
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:46,640
they make you a hero.
Yet God says,

1441
01:12:46,641 --> 01:12:48,950
thou shalt not kill you.
Had a fight,

1442
01:12:48,951 --> 01:12:52,340
kill a lot of people for the government.
I'm a hero.

1443
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:56,690
How can that be?
How could there be a double standard

1444
01:12:56,691 --> 01:13:01,280
like that that swallowed shows
completely that governments more

1445
01:13:01,281 --> 01:13:06,110
powerful than God because government
allows you to kill when God says you

1446
01:13:06,111 --> 01:13:10,940
can't and government rewards you for it
and make gives you hero status for it

1447
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,610
and God doesn't do anything about it.

1448
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:18,760
It is pretty complicated thinking when
God is a big part of the military.

1449
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:24,030
I mean when the nine slash 11 happened,
when the nine slash 11 attacks happened

1450
01:13:24,131 --> 01:13:28,750
and George Bush on television said that
God is with the troops.

1451
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:34,970
I mean the worst thing I ever heard him
say when he was trumping up the Iraq

1452
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,140
war,
I'll never forget it because I opposed

1453
01:13:37,141 --> 01:13:38,940
the Iraq war before it even app.
I said,

1454
01:13:38,941 --> 01:13:41,970
this is ridiculous.
Iraq and have nothing to do with nine

1455
01:13:41,971 --> 01:13:44,460
slash 11.
Why are we invading Iraq?

1456
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:47,460
Well,
I'll never forget bushes.

1457
01:13:47,461 --> 01:13:51,870
Press conference where he walked out and
announced that he was sending in our

1458
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:55,440
military.
We're going to attack Iraq and he was

1459
01:13:55,441 --> 01:14:00,090
getting ready to leave the stage and a
final reporter asked him,

1460
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,000
Mr President,
did you consult your father?

1461
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:08,300
Meaning Bush senior because you know
Bush Sr had that Kuwait Iraq thing

1462
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:10,860
happened during his watch and I'll
never.

1463
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:16,230
George Bush turning around to the press
and the American people smiling and

1464
01:14:17,201 --> 01:14:18,460
going,
no,

1465
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:23,700
I consulted a higher father.
I was sitting in my chair at home and

1466
01:14:24,371 --> 01:14:26,440
almost fell out of it.
I said,

1467
01:14:26,441 --> 01:14:31,441
this guy wants me to believe that he
talked to God and God told him to invade

1468
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:34,234
Iraq.

1469
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,540
You're saying you consulted a higher
higher father.

1470
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:42,070
It's like going up to a rock and in Iraq
what you should do with your life,

1471
01:14:42,071 --> 01:14:44,260
like you're not getting any answers,
but excuse me,

1472
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:47,110
and then I said,
I've been on the earth as long as this

1473
01:14:47,111 --> 01:14:49,960
guy.
I'm twice the man George Bushes and God

1474
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:53,470
ain't never said a word to me in my
entire existence.

1475
01:14:53,680 --> 01:14:56,860
Yet this guy wants me to believe God
talks to him.

1476
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:00,130
Yeah.
They just let that go and just say,

1477
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,290
just talk to me.
Just let that slide.

1478
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:06,240
He consulted God.
He consulted a higher father there,

1479
01:15:06,270 --> 01:15:07,720
be right back,
so in other words,

1480
01:15:07,721 --> 01:15:11,110
she,
he wants us to believe that his invasion

1481
01:15:11,111 --> 01:15:15,640
of Iraq had God's blessing and all the
people of this country,

1482
01:15:15,641 --> 01:15:20,020
except that it's one of those convenient
acknowledgements and Jesse Ventura can

1483
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:22,060
say it because I've come out of the
closet.

1484
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:26,370
You've come out of the closet for what?
I'm an atheist.

1485
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:31,430
You're an atheist in that you don't
believe I don't believe in higher.

1486
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:35,130
No,
ain't selling me on that.

1487
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:39,570
Do you tell the possibility of something
happening when you die?

1488
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,680
No.
You don't know if he die.

1489
01:15:41,690 --> 01:15:43,980
You just go dark.
I don't know if that's a wrap.

1490
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:46,530
That's a wrap.
Hmm.

1491
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,070
There's no proof.
Right.

1492
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:52,500
Then anything else happens.
It's just definitely need proof just to

1493
01:15:52,501 --> 01:15:57,240
belief to me,
I don't believe it because like I said,

1494
01:15:57,241 --> 01:16:01,170
I've been on the planet 65 years now in
God's never spoke to me.

1495
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,770
Now if I'm wrong,
people said,

1496
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:04,950
well,
what if you're wrong?

1497
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,353
I'll say,
well,

1498
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,690
God made me with a brain to think did
me.

1499
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:12,480
He's going to condemn me because I used
it.

1500
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:16,060
Well,
religion in a sense,

1501
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:19,330
it's pretty ridiculous.
The idea that God came to people a long

1502
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:23,230
fucking time ago when the books and you
told everybody about the world.

1503
01:16:23,260 --> 01:16:25,710
Have you heard about water?
Everybody just pass it down.

1504
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,060
You know about horror?
Sure.

1505
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,710
Well,
horace was an Egyptian God who has the

1506
01:16:29,711 --> 01:16:34,711
identical same bio is Jesus only
predates and buy a couple hundred years.

1507
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:38,230
So who's the real one?
They did this.

1508
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:41,440
They were both born of a virgin.
They both walked on water.

1509
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:43,390
Allegedly,
they both healed the sick.

1510
01:16:43,660 --> 01:16:47,140
They both were crucified and buried.
Rose again from the dead.

1511
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,020
Jesus did it.
And so did horace.

1512
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:55,360
What is a ton of parallels throughout
history and that's my point.

1513
01:16:55,390 --> 01:16:57,520
That's why I'm not a believer.
Well,

1514
01:16:57,521 --> 01:17:00,940
I'm not opposed either.
Interesting that ancient people said

1515
01:17:00,970 --> 01:17:05,320
about be communicating with higher
powers and passing down laws that must

1516
01:17:05,321 --> 01:17:08,870
be without a doubt followed and some of
them are ridiculous.

1517
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:10,090
You can't wear the same tie back.

1518
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:12,120
Two different types of cloth.
I mean,

1519
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,540
you can be put to death for wearing two
different types of cloth.

1520
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:15,920
Mean,
I don't know if people know that.

1521
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:18,200
There's a lot of really fucking goofy
ones.

1522
01:17:18,201 --> 01:17:21,950
What about the story of who is the
gentleman in the Bible where he was bald

1523
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:24,860
and two children mocked him for his
baldness,

1524
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:29,630
so a God sent to bears to attack the
kids and more of them and killed them.

1525
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,310
That's in the Bible.
Old Testament stuff.

1526
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:34,910
Yeah.
Make Fun of a bald guy like you and me

1527
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,420
and a fucking bear comes and kills kids.
What are your rights?

1528
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:43,370
What do you find these barriers?
I'd like to recommend is that I've been

1529
01:17:43,371 --> 01:17:46,310
made fun of enough.
Could I have a couple of attack bears?

1530
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:47,920
Then the next day,
the biggest fund,

1531
01:17:47,980 --> 01:17:52,100
the most ridiculous thing to say and to
put that in the Bible,

1532
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:57,101
like the fact that two kids can make fun
of you being bald and so God punishes

1533
01:17:57,581 --> 01:17:59,800
those kids by having a fucking bear
attack them.

1534
01:18:00,770 --> 01:18:03,100
How about it doesn't bother you if you
bald like,

1535
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,280
well,
a lot of a pussy.

1536
01:18:04,281 --> 01:18:07,700
Are you taunting you?
How about the fact that they tell you

1537
01:18:07,701 --> 01:18:11,270
that the world's only 5,000 years old?
I think it's 10 or 10,

1538
01:18:11,271 --> 01:18:12,110
whatever,
five,

1539
01:18:12,111 --> 01:18:13,490
10,
whatever the hell it is.

1540
01:18:13,491 --> 01:18:16,640
I don't keep track of it,
but I mean how ridiculous is that?

1541
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:18,820
Well,
they've done it very scientifically than

1542
01:18:18,821 --> 01:18:21,530
counted up all the ages of all the
people in the Bible.

1543
01:18:21,531 --> 01:18:23,360
So I don't know how you are arguing with
this.

1544
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:30,350
They're very accurate book.
It's hilarious to that.

1545
01:18:30,351 --> 01:18:30,921
They'll say,
well,

1546
01:18:30,921 --> 01:18:33,350
that's old testament.
You don't follow the Old Testament.

1547
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:34,970
Oh,
so you want to follow the book that was

1548
01:18:34,971 --> 01:18:37,880
written by Constantine and a bunch of
fucking bishops.

1549
01:18:38,090 --> 01:18:42,110
Not only that constant team wasn't even
a Christian until he was on his

1550
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:45,090
deathbed.
Constantine converted when he was at

1551
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,170
dying old man.
He wasn't a Christian through his entire

1552
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,930
shoulders.
Hope for Jesse.

1553
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:53,620
Hope for.
I'll just follow Constantine when I get

1554
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:56,270
to the dying bad.
If I find out there's God,

1555
01:18:56,271 --> 01:18:59,120
I'll just see the light is hedge your
bets.

1556
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:00,303
Look,
if there's no,

1557
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:04,220
it's like a liquid Danville's.
Arian would say you can't lose in this

1558
01:19:04,221 --> 01:19:08,330
bet because if you're wrong and there is
no god,

1559
01:19:08,331 --> 01:19:10,970
like if you.
If you get to the deathbed and you

1560
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,830
convert to Christianity and you're
wrong,

1561
01:19:13,831 --> 01:19:15,670
and there is no god,
it doesn't matter anyway.

1562
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,360
It's all just darkness,
right?

1563
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:19,100
You just go blank.
But it kind of.

1564
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:19,880
Right.
You know,

1565
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,760
it's kind of like the Republicans and
the Democrats.

1566
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:26,780
It's Kinda like you filing your taxes
January 28th.

1567
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:29,360
No,
his slip in a couple of days.

1568
01:19:29,361 --> 01:19:32,060
It's like the Republicans and the
Democrats was that.

1569
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:34,370
Well,
they vape.

1570
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:39,430
When you go to their conventions,
the lobbyists 10 both and they pay off

1571
01:19:39,861 --> 01:19:44,330
both sides show it doesn't matter who
wins the presidency.

1572
01:19:44,331 --> 01:19:47,180
They've already.
It'd be the equivalent of betting on the

1573
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,940
superbowl.
If you bet on both teams,

1574
01:19:49,941 --> 01:19:51,110
you don't lose,
do you?

1575
01:19:51,860 --> 01:19:52,460
Well,
that's,

1576
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:55,550
that's what the lobbyists do.
They bet on both teams.

1577
01:19:55,880 --> 01:19:59,900
So whether Hillary or trump wins,
they got their base covered.

1578
01:19:59,901 --> 01:20:02,480
It don't matter to them.
They've already paid them off.

1579
01:20:02,900 --> 01:20:05,750
The only thing that really changes
whether it's right to left,

1580
01:20:05,810 --> 01:20:08,280
is the the aspects

1581
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:11,580
of society that are affected by the
social changes.

1582
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,270
Like Obama was much more lenient towards
gay marriage,

1583
01:20:15,271 --> 01:20:19,260
towards a lot of social issues,
but he was much more strict on putting

1584
01:20:19,261 --> 01:20:23,430
us under more surveillance,
which is a social issue.

1585
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,380
Yes.
Uh,

1586
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:26,730
so it,
it plays out the same way.

1587
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,590
He may have been lenient on certain
social things and then more people are

1588
01:20:31,591 --> 01:20:35,400
now in jail and look what he does to
whistle blow as far as.

1589
01:20:35,460 --> 01:20:38,100
Yeah,
I was going to bring destroys them and

1590
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:43,230
show everybody that syncs.
Obama is kinder to the people on social.

1591
01:20:43,231 --> 01:20:45,450
Not really.
It seems like it on,

1592
01:20:45,490 --> 01:20:48,960
on the surface when you look at his
demeanor and the way he carries himself,

1593
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:51,360
but then when you look at the actual
actions ventral.

1594
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:53,220
Yes.
Well he's the most presidential

1595
01:20:53,221 --> 01:20:56,100
president we've had,
and I'll say this,

1596
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:59,010
he's the most dynamic speaker since Jack
Kennedy.

1597
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:03,130
See,
I don't think he's that dynamic more.

1598
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:05,880
I think Obama,
I think he's kind of beaten down by

1599
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:08,040
time.
Nobody's eight years in now and you've

1600
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:11,510
heard of long enough.
But he is the most dynamic speaker since

1601
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:12,510
guy,
but he's not.

1602
01:21:12,511 --> 01:21:17,370
The actions don't back the words the
words before he ran,

1603
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:19,170
when he was running for office,
I was like,

1604
01:21:19,171 --> 01:21:20,370
Holy Shit,
this is the guy.

1605
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:24,480
This is the guy,
and the same thing's gonna happen with

1606
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:27,240
Hillary.
All the women out there that think,

1607
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:29,070
oh,
we're going to get our first female

1608
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:29,851
president.
Yes,

1609
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,690
you're going to get them,
but it ain't gonna be nothing different

1610
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:37,070
and you're going to get the same
government completely because Hillary's

1611
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:41,340
a globalist.
She supports all the global initiatives.

1612
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:45,840
She's also for war.
The finger troubles me when they attack

1613
01:21:45,841 --> 01:21:47,400
trump,
and I'm not a trump supporter,

1614
01:21:47,401 --> 01:21:51,180
but hillary,
they claim Hillary as the experience.

1615
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:52,410
Well,
let's look at it.

1616
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:57,440
When she was a senator,
the most important vote she took was to

1617
01:21:57,451 --> 01:22:02,451
vote in the affirmative to invade Iraq.
She now admits that was her biggest

1618
01:22:02,911 --> 01:22:05,310
mistake.
Excuse me,

1619
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:09,360
Madam Clinton.
That was the most important vote and you

1620
01:22:09,361 --> 01:22:12,270
blew it.
Now you're going to have your finger on

1621
01:22:12,271 --> 01:22:15,090
the button.
What happens if you make the same

1622
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:18,600
mistake that you made with the war on
Iraq,

1623
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:22,410
which you now admit was the worst vote
you took as a senator?

1624
01:22:22,590 --> 01:22:26,070
Approving the Iraq war and yet she took
it,

1625
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,770
didn't she?
She voted to the affirmative.

1626
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:31,410
Let's go to war with Iraq.
Yeah.

1627
01:22:31,411 --> 01:22:34,920
It's very troubling.
The momentum of influence of all these

1628
01:22:34,921 --> 01:22:37,800
lobbyists and special interest groups
and all the money that's behind her.

1629
01:22:37,801 --> 01:22:41,160
All the bankers,
all the different people that are paying

1630
01:22:41,161 --> 01:22:46,161
her for these $250,000 an hour speeches.
At what point in time do you gather up

1631
01:22:47,311 --> 01:22:50,340
enough money where this doesn't make
sense anymore when we start thinking

1632
01:22:50,341 --> 01:22:53,490
about your children and your children's
children in the future of the world,

1633
01:22:53,640 --> 01:22:55,860
or do you think that she thinks she's
doing the right thing?

1634
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,130
She thinks she's doing the right thing.
That's the system that that's the system

1635
01:22:59,131 --> 01:23:02,040
you have to play within the system.
The system they've created,

1636
01:23:02,041 --> 01:23:06,430
the Democrats and Republicans is a
system based upon the concept of

1637
01:23:06,431 --> 01:23:08,350
bribery.
Now,

1638
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:11,320
if you do bribery in the private sector,
you go to prison,

1639
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,440
but in the public sector,
it's completely alive and well.

1640
01:23:14,441 --> 01:23:19,210
That's why I don't trust any career
politician because that means they are

1641
01:23:19,211 --> 01:23:23,620
comfortable in a system of bribery,
a corrupt system,

1642
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,810
and if they're comfortable to work in
that corrupt system for all those years,

1643
01:23:28,811 --> 01:23:32,620
that means they're corrupt too.
You could when you know you could be the

1644
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:34,750
president.
I know you were one of the few

1645
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:36,880
independents that I know they really
could win.

1646
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:38,260
I know.
Especially now.

1647
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:42,580
You see what's going on now with trump
and the what I call grab the pussy gate.

1648
01:23:43,240 --> 01:23:47,200
If grab the pussy date gate doesn't.
He's fucking moved up in the polls.

1649
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,740
He's moved up since the first debate.
What?

1650
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:51,030
This is madness.
I mean we're.

1651
01:23:51,031 --> 01:23:53,110
We're dealing with a mad,
mad world right now.

1652
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:56,860
Well,
we're dealing with what I see in the

1653
01:23:56,860 --> 01:23:58,510
United States today.
At least a faction of it.

1654
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:03,580
We are going down the identical road of
19 thirties,

1655
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:04,414
Germany.

1656
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:11,770
Look at what we're doing.
We're marginalizing one group of people,

1657
01:24:11,771 --> 01:24:14,890
the Mexicans.
They're responsible for everything bad

1658
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:16,000
in the country.
Right?

1659
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:19,660
What did the Germans do?
They did that with the Jews.

1660
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:22,810
They got all the other people angry at
the Jews,

1661
01:24:22,811 --> 01:24:26,920
all the Germans so that they could ride
everything we're doing right now.

1662
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:30,850
Parallels 19 thirties,
Germany to a t.

1663
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:36,690
You know what's really crazy waging wars
throughout the world were invading

1664
01:24:36,691 --> 01:24:39,200
countries.
Uh,

1665
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:43,470
I don't know if you know this,
but there was a poll taken three years

1666
01:24:43,471 --> 01:24:46,710
ago by Gallup and it never got any
publicity here.

1667
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:50,430
International poll,
3000 people I think.

1668
01:24:50,850 --> 01:24:53,760
And they pose no Americans,
nobody from the US.

1669
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:57,930
And they posed the question,
if your country where to go to war

1670
01:24:57,931 --> 01:25:00,780
today,
who do you think it would likely be

1671
01:25:00,781 --> 01:25:05,781
against?
Twenty three percent answered the United

1672
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:08,790
States.
Eight percent answered China.

1673
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:14,030
Six percent said Pakistan.
So one out of four international people

1674
01:25:14,731 --> 01:25:19,731
believe that if they go to war,
the United States will be the adversary

1675
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,570
eyes.
A veteran.

1676
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:23,880
I hang my head in.
Shame over that.

1677
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:29,010
Brian Jessee run too late.
Come on man.

1678
01:25:29,080 --> 01:25:30,430
Too late.
Why is it too late?

1679
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:32,020
You'll have to wait until 20,
20.

1680
01:25:32,021 --> 01:25:35,560
Now it's too late to get this one.
I'd have to go to the libertarian thing.

1681
01:25:35,561 --> 01:25:36,980
You've got to a ballot access.
Yeah,

1682
01:25:36,990 --> 01:25:38,200
but 20,
20 is a good time.

1683
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:42,490
Well it will be 70.
We'll get you on the general.

1684
01:25:42,491 --> 01:25:44,220
I'll be almost,
I'll give you some,

1685
01:25:44,240 --> 01:25:48,100
my healthy diet.
I'm almost 70 and I never say never.

1686
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:51,810
You know,
maybe when if Hillary wins and the women

1687
01:25:51,811 --> 01:25:55,000
see there's no difference having a woman
as we learned,

1688
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:57,430
there's no difference having a black man
in there.

1689
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:00,450
It's still business as usual.
Uh,

1690
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:04,520
maybe when they learn all that,
if the revolution continues to happen

1691
01:26:04,521 --> 01:26:06,770
because you know,
here's something interesting.

1692
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:11,870
The Bernie people and the original trump
people wanted the same thing.

1693
01:26:12,110 --> 01:26:14,840
Yeah,
they wanted but they couldn't come

1694
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:18,080
together because one's left ultra left
the others ultra,

1695
01:26:18,081 --> 01:26:18,880
right.

1696
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:21,980
The,
the status quo is now using that to

1697
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:25,850
survive.
They're keeping the revolutionary

1698
01:26:25,851 --> 01:26:30,020
separated so that they can survive with
business as usual.

1699
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:31,160
Well,
there's two completely different

1700
01:26:31,161 --> 01:26:33,260
factions.
One that wants to dissolve the system

1701
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:36,500
because he thinks it's corrupt,
but he uses certain aspects of the

1702
01:26:36,501 --> 01:26:40,850
system to make vast amounts of money.
The other one doesn't really care about

1703
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:45,010
money and really thinks that people
should make more money for them.

1704
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:46,310
I mean,
there's a lot of things that I agree

1705
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:49,880
with both agree to clean house.
What we got now is a mess.

1706
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:52,640
Exactly.
And clear the house out and start over.

1707
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:54,290
Yeah.
Both agreed to that.

1708
01:26:54,350 --> 01:26:55,670
Yeah.
Well that's one of the things that

1709
01:26:55,671 --> 01:26:59,930
people support and trump and they wish
that he wasn't the guy he is and so they

1710
01:26:59,931 --> 01:27:02,090
try to pretend that he's someone other
than who he is.

1711
01:27:02,230 --> 01:27:03,380
I,
I really believe,

1712
01:27:03,381 --> 01:27:07,340
and I believe this,
if I would've gotten in the race and,

1713
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:11,540
and gotten into the debates,
I could've won.

1714
01:27:11,630 --> 01:27:12,530
Oh,
you definitely could won.

1715
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:14,660
You're a way better speaker than either
one of them.

1716
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:18,290
Even the speaker.
It's,

1717
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:20,960
I don't have the.
I don't have the baggage.

1718
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:22,130
Right.
And,

1719
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:24,470
and did you know,
here's some interest.

1720
01:27:24,471 --> 01:27:26,870
His finger aspect is a huge issue.
I,

1721
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:31,070
when I ran for governor,
I only raised $300,000.

1722
01:27:31,790 --> 01:27:32,623
That's it.
Yeah.

1723
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:36,680
I made more money doing the job than
what I spent to get it.

1724
01:27:37,310 --> 01:27:38,510
That's the,
that's unprecedented.

1725
01:27:38,570 --> 01:27:39,690
Yeah.
That's why.

1726
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,680
That's why they don't want to talk about
me.

1727
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,540
That's why they are.
They want me gone.

1728
01:27:44,541 --> 01:27:48,620
I've beaten them twice.
While you're also an actual military

1729
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:51,680
veteran and you're also a man is
actually held office before and you're

1730
01:27:51,681 --> 01:27:55,190
actually not a career politician,
but you've done the job and you have a

1731
01:27:55,191 --> 01:27:56,960
very good insight on what it's all
about.

1732
01:27:57,170 --> 01:28:00,110
You're also a conspiracy theorist,
which scares the shit out of him.

1733
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:01,940
Well,
but let's remember,

1734
01:28:01,941 --> 01:28:05,840
they did a huge study in England and
found the conspiracy theorists are

1735
01:28:05,841 --> 01:28:07,250
generally more intelligent.

1736
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:09,860
Are you got to meet?
Some of my friends know they're more

1737
01:28:09,861 --> 01:28:14,861
intelligent monkey because.
Because they don't accept things.

1738
01:28:14,961 --> 01:28:19,850
They do their own personal studies
before they bring up an opinion.

1739
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:22,130
Right.
But then there's some flat earth people

1740
01:28:22,131 --> 01:28:25,550
and chem trails and there's some wacky
shit that gets thrown into the mix there

1741
01:28:25,551 --> 01:28:27,170
too.
Dinosaurs aren't real,

1742
01:28:27,400 --> 01:28:31,040
but I'll tell you something as crazy as
some of them sound.

1743
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,910
Sometimes after a few years go by,
you start thinking,

1744
01:28:34,911 --> 01:28:38,150
you know they might be right.
What do you think about people in on the

1745
01:28:38,151 --> 01:28:40,340
moon?
I think we were there.

1746
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:41,600
Okay.
Yeah,

1747
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:44,360
absolutely I do.
Do you think any of the footage is fake?

1748
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,320
I like to not believe it is.
I don't know.

1749
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:52,310
I've never studied it,
I've never sat down and really stammered

1750
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:54,230
out.
I was 18 years old.

1751
01:28:54,231 --> 01:28:57,020
I just graduated,
revise school would allegedly walked on

1752
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:59,750
the moon.
That's the only.

1753
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,490
I was fucked.
I far more concerned

1754
01:29:02,490 --> 01:29:05,770
at that time of Woodstock and uh,
that,

1755
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:09,420
that also happened that year.
The real issue with conspiracy theories

1756
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:12,450
is the absolute proven ones like Gulf of
Tonkin,

1757
01:29:12,451 --> 01:29:16,320
which got us into the Vietnam War that
you were part of like a operation

1758
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:18,390
northwoods,
which was signed by the Joint Chiefs of

1759
01:29:18,391 --> 01:29:23,391
staff and vetoed by Kennedy where they
had planned attacks on Guantanamo Bay.

1760
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:28,410
They were going to arm Cuban friendlies
to attack one ton of obey blaming on the

1761
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:32,070
Cubans and let us go to war with Cuba.
They were going to blow up a drone.

1762
01:29:32,071 --> 01:29:33,950
Jetliner.
They were fire jetliner,

1763
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:35,580
blow it up,
blame it on Cuba.

1764
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:36,930
They were going to do all these
different.

1765
01:29:36,931 --> 01:29:38,820
After knowing all that,
you know,

1766
01:29:39,180 --> 01:29:42,270
are you all show out to include the
murder of John Kennedy?

1767
01:29:42,340 --> 01:29:44,220
Yeah.
I don't buy.

1768
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,170
I don't either at all,
at all.

1769
01:29:46,200 --> 01:29:49,320
What they've told us.
And let's bring in nine slash 11.

1770
01:29:49,830 --> 01:29:52,440
Well,
the murder of John Kennedy to me is

1771
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:54,720
first of all,
there's so many aspects of it that

1772
01:29:54,721 --> 01:29:57,090
people like to conveniently ignore,
like the magic bullet,

1773
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:58,500
not,
not just the path,

1774
01:29:58,501 --> 01:30:01,890
because bullets take crazy paths.
I'm sure you know that bullets.

1775
01:30:01,891 --> 01:30:03,600
I mean,
you could shoot someone in the front and

1776
01:30:03,601 --> 01:30:04,950
the boat will come out of their
eyeballs.

1777
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:08,040
It does happen.
Things ricochet off bone.

1778
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:11,760
Weird Shit happens,
but a bullet does not go through bone

1779
01:30:11,761 --> 01:30:14,220
and come out looking like that.
Not only that,

1780
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:16,860
it can't be bigger than it originally
was.

1781
01:30:16,890 --> 01:30:19,530
Exactly.
There's more particles inside the body

1782
01:30:19,531 --> 01:30:21,530
that are missing from the bullet itself.
Exactly.

1783
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:26,010
So it does show the bullet camp get
bigger than what it originally was.

1784
01:30:26,030 --> 01:30:29,460
That bullet went through Kennedy,
shattered bones and connolly's body and

1785
01:30:29,461 --> 01:30:32,280
came out looking for Stina.
I've shot a lot of bullets.

1786
01:30:32,281 --> 01:30:34,530
I know what happens when you hit animals
with bullets.

1787
01:30:34,710 --> 01:30:37,260
When you hit bonds.
I have these two copper bullets from an

1788
01:30:37,290 --> 01:30:39,900
elk I shot and there are fucked up.
Well,

1789
01:30:40,150 --> 01:30:42,000
I'll.
We recreated it.

1790
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:44,910
Unconcerned she theory.
I couldn't make the shots and I'm an

1791
01:30:44,911 --> 01:30:46,140
expert.
Yeah,

1792
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:48,630
I mean you couldn't,
the finger was hard.

1793
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:53,400
You couldn't work that bolt [inaudible]
quick enough like they claim he got the

1794
01:30:53,401 --> 01:30:56,320
shots off and like six seconds.
Ridiculous.

1795
01:30:56,321 --> 01:31:01,321
See the fastest I could do it without
even aiming was seven point eight and

1796
01:31:01,981 --> 01:31:03,810
that was not even taking a name.
Well,

1797
01:31:03,811 --> 01:31:07,470
I think if the gun was lubed up,
well if you practice really well,

1798
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,290
I don't have a problem with someone
being able to do something

1799
01:31:10,291 --> 01:31:12,330
extraordinarily quickly.
Carlos couldn't.

1800
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:15,080
The sniper,
Carlos Health,

1801
01:31:15,630 --> 01:31:19,440
they created the whole thing for him and
he couldn't make the shots and he's the

1802
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:22,200
greatest sniper and history and even
laughed about it and said,

1803
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,050
you're going to tell me Oswald could
outshoot me.

1804
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,730
Isn't it possible that he got lucky?
Man?

1805
01:31:28,890 --> 01:31:31,470
Isn't it possible that he got lucky
shot?

1806
01:31:31,650 --> 01:31:32,880
No.
No.

1807
01:31:33,210 --> 01:31:35,640
In.
Why wouldn't you like an Oliver's movie?

1808
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:36,840
Why?
If you want it,

1809
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:38,640
why didn't you take it when he's coming
at ya?

1810
01:31:39,150 --> 01:31:40,800
Well,
he couldn't get into that position if it

1811
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:44,070
really was acting alone right there.
Okay.

1812
01:31:44,090 --> 01:31:48,240
I cars coming right at you before it
makes the turn that way if you miss the

1813
01:31:48,241 --> 01:31:52,170
next one is going to be closer.
The weird thing is that they had to come

1814
01:31:52,171 --> 01:31:55,440
up with the magic bullet theory to
account for a bullet that hit the

1815
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:59,620
underpass and ricocheted off of the curb
and hit a guy and because of that,

1816
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:00,070
that's

1817
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:01,870
why they had to account for one bullet.

1818
01:32:01,970 --> 01:32:04,110
Oh,
the damaged bodies.

1819
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:09,150
I interviewed Mr Newman and Mr Newman's
was the physical person closest to the

1820
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:13,870
fatal headshot.
He's the guy you see who covers his kids

1821
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:19,390
in all the movies.
That's Mr Newman and I asked him this a

1822
01:32:19,390 --> 01:32:20,230
few years ago.
I was doing the show.

1823
01:32:20,231 --> 01:32:22,270
I met him there and interviewed.
I said,

1824
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:24,310
where did you think the bullet came
from?

1825
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:24,761
He said,
oh,

1826
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:28,030
it came from over my shoulder,
which puts it right at the picket fence

1827
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:30,370
because he was right down there and he
said it came from over his right

1828
01:32:30,371 --> 01:32:34,540
shoulder and he.
We had his FBI report there,

1829
01:32:34,541 --> 01:32:37,750
write one page,
and I said to Mr Newman.

1830
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:38,171
I said,
well,

1831
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:42,310
Mr Newman when you stated at came over
your shoulder,

1832
01:32:42,311 --> 01:32:44,920
which put it at the grassy knoll.
I said,

1833
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,890
how did the Warren Commission respond to
this?

1834
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:51,100
You know what he said to me?
He looked at me,

1835
01:32:51,101 --> 01:32:53,590
said I was never called in front of the
Warren Commission,

1836
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:56,600
and I went,
you were the co,

1837
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:01,740
the closest living witness to the
headshot and they never even brought you

1838
01:33:02,261 --> 01:33:04,720
in to ask you a question.
Nope.

1839
01:33:05,770 --> 01:33:07,990
Why?
Because they saw his initial report

1840
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:10,570
didn't fit with what they were going to
put out,

1841
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,200
so they conveniently didn't call him in.

1842
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:17,580
There's also two different accounts from
the autopsy,

1843
01:33:18,310 --> 01:33:23,010
the Bethesda Maryland version versus the
Dallas version of the entrance wound on

1844
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:23,970
the neck,
you know,

1845
01:33:23,971 --> 01:33:28,530
they call it an entrance wound and that
the Tesla Maryland said it was a

1846
01:33:28,531 --> 01:33:29,550
tracheotomy.
Ruined.

1847
01:33:29,890 --> 01:33:32,250
I mean they,
they changed it from a bullet hitting

1848
01:33:32,251 --> 01:33:34,100
him in the front to a trake wound.

1849
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:36,740
Well,
what's his name also changed at Joe

1850
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,960
Ford?
The back bullet.

1851
01:33:37,961 --> 01:33:39,330
He moved it up.
Yeah.

1852
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,690
Now how do you do those things?
You know.

1853
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:46,900
And then the other interesting thing was
Harold Weisberg wrote about it,

1854
01:33:46,901 --> 01:33:49,480
news,
great books Whitewash Harold.

1855
01:33:49,481 --> 01:33:52,930
It took him 10 years to get the minutes
of the Warren Commission.

1856
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:58,200
It came out that a Houston newspaper
stated Oswaldo was a paid FBI informant,

1857
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:03,040
had his number and the whole thing.
So the Warren Commission had to hold an

1858
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:06,970
emergency meeting and it took harold 10
years to get the minutes because they

1859
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:12,000
withheld them now you'd think they were
meeting to discover and find out about

1860
01:34:13,121 --> 01:34:16,000
this right.
The whole minutes to the meeting had

1861
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:18,730
nothing to do with that.
The minutes to the meeting dealt with

1862
01:34:18,731 --> 01:34:20,590
completely.
How do we cover this up?

1863
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:24,250
Now?
The guy who is going to cover this up

1864
01:34:24,270 --> 01:34:26,910
pretty ridiculous.
You know the guy who was the closest to

1865
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:30,000
play devil's advocate,
when when any sort of a chaotic event

1866
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:31,980
happens,
you're memory is usually fucked up

1867
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:35,010
because you're dealing with adrenaline,
especially someone who's not used to

1868
01:34:35,011 --> 01:34:40,011
being in sort of combat type situations.
Human memory is one of the most faulty

1869
01:34:41,041 --> 01:34:43,920
pieces of evidence you could ever get.
People remember all kinds of shit that

1870
01:34:43,921 --> 01:34:47,190
isn't real.
And if the story started getting out

1871
01:34:47,191 --> 01:34:49,440
that there was people shooting from
behind the grassy knoll,

1872
01:34:49,710 --> 01:34:53,460
it's entirely possible that someone can
fabricate something in their own mind

1873
01:34:53,461 --> 01:34:54,630
and not even be deceptive.

1874
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:56,280
Maybe.
Maybe,

1875
01:34:56,310 --> 01:34:58,130
maybe.
But if I would think

1876
01:34:58,130 --> 01:35:02,780
that if you were there and you heard the
shot and you felt it go over your

1877
01:35:02,781 --> 01:35:04,310
shoulder,
I would think you,

1878
01:35:04,580 --> 01:35:07,050
if you told me,
been around.

1879
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:08,960
I think.
I don't know Mr Newman.

1880
01:35:08,961 --> 01:35:09,201
Yeah.
I,

1881
01:35:09,201 --> 01:35:11,630
I never quizzed him on that.
But I thought he was.

1882
01:35:11,631 --> 01:35:13,730
But there,
there were other others too.

1883
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:14,720
Not just him.
Right.

1884
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:17,930
But you have to.
There's a lot of witnesses said that

1885
01:35:17,931 --> 01:35:18,890
they had.
In fact,

1886
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:23,390
there's a photo where you see smoke
going across the plaza right from the

1887
01:35:23,391 --> 01:35:26,180
grassy knoll in the air.
Have you ever seen.

1888
01:35:26,780 --> 01:35:30,620
Did you ever read a David Lifton's book?
Best evidence to amazing book.

1889
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:34,910
That was the book that got me on the
conspiracy theory theory trail,

1890
01:35:35,120 --> 01:35:38,840
but there was an analysis done.
The one you need to read is whitewashed

1891
01:35:38,841 --> 01:35:41,720
by Harold Weisberg.
I'll read it this weekend.

1892
01:35:41,750 --> 01:35:42,583
Whitewash.
I'm,

1893
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:44,420
I'm,
you got me fired up again.

1894
01:35:45,230 --> 01:35:46,430
There was a,
um,

1895
01:35:46,490 --> 01:35:49,550
a,
a crazy analysis of all the witnesses of

1896
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:51,890
the Kennedy assassination and how many
of them died.

1897
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,150
Untimely.
Death is fucking terrifying if you

1898
01:35:56,151 --> 01:35:56,990
haven't seen that.
Folks.

1899
01:35:56,991 --> 01:35:59,460
Jamie,
see if he could find that witnesses to

1900
01:35:59,461 --> 01:36:01,730
the Kennedy assassination that died.
Untimely deaths,

1901
01:36:01,731 --> 01:36:04,400
I mean,
but they did a statistical analysis of

1902
01:36:04,401 --> 01:36:09,401
the odds of all these people getting
murdered and just random random murders

1903
01:36:09,801 --> 01:36:12,920
and fucking bizarre suicides.
That's insane.

1904
01:36:13,130 --> 01:36:14,750
Well,
how about Dorothy Kilgallen,

1905
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:21,020
the greater Washington reporter.
She went out and got an interview with

1906
01:36:21,111 --> 01:36:24,110
Jack Ruby.
She came out of the interview stating

1907
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:26,610
I'm going to break the Kennedy case wide
open,

1908
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,840
got back to New York and they found her
dead the next day.

1909
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:33,980
Woo.
Dorothy Kilgallen,

1910
01:36:33,981 --> 01:36:36,860
she's one of the most famous reporters
in New York,

1911
01:36:37,220 --> 01:36:41,390
and she got an interview with Jack Ruby
and she came out of the interview and

1912
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:44,720
all she'd quote was,
I'm going to break the Kennedy Case Wide

1913
01:36:44,720 --> 01:36:45,251
Open.
Yeah,

1914
01:36:45,251 --> 01:36:46,060
I'm.
And then.

1915
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:48,440
And then she was found dead within a
week.

1916
01:36:49,070 --> 01:36:54,070
What's interesting too is this idea that
Lee Harvey Oswald either acted alone or

1917
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:58,190
the government assassinated Kennedy,
Juno of Judith,

1918
01:36:58,191 --> 01:36:59,780
very baker of.

1919
01:36:59,780 --> 01:37:02,510
Why do I know that name or she was
Oswald's girlfriend.

1920
01:37:02,750 --> 01:37:05,540
Okay.
In New Orleans and she's written a book

1921
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:10,541
called Lee and me.
Great Book where she talks She Lee was

1922
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:14,000
going to divorce his wife and her and
judith.

1923
01:37:14,001 --> 01:37:16,100
We're going to get together.
That's what she says.

1924
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:19,670
Ah,
I think that's what she said on record,

1925
01:37:19,730 --> 01:37:21,530
but it.
But it adds all these speakers.

1926
01:37:21,531 --> 01:37:24,020
They weren't living together at that
time.

1927
01:37:24,110 --> 01:37:24,980
This is the,
uh,

1928
01:37:24,981 --> 01:37:27,620
all the different people that died.
Untimely deaths.

1929
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:29,630
Yup.
This is fucking crazy.

1930
01:37:30,530 --> 01:37:33,920
It's all heart attack.
A unknown.

1931
01:37:34,530 --> 01:37:35,690
What w,
what do we got here?

1932
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:39,650
Drug overdose.
The one that's really the bad one is the

1933
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:42,500
guy who was in the tower there at the
train thing.

1934
01:37:42,530 --> 01:37:43,850
Suicide,
suicide,

1935
01:37:43,851 --> 01:37:44,810
suicide.
They found,

1936
01:37:44,840 --> 01:37:47,000
they found him dead.
Minor accident,

1937
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:50,600
minor accident dead.
One car crashed dead heart attack,

1938
01:37:50,601 --> 01:37:53,540
heart attack.
And these [inaudible] died quick.

1939
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:54,530
This is what's interesting.

1940
01:37:54,530 --> 01:37:56,310
They died.
They all died within a very short amount

1941
01:37:56,311 --> 01:37:58,170
of time.
Gunshot wound to the head.

1942
01:37:58,200 --> 01:37:58,861
Well,
you know what,

1943
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:02,520
judith was involved in an Oswald.
They were.

1944
01:38:02,550 --> 01:38:07,550
They were at New Orleans attempting to
create a fast moving cancer that Lee was

1945
01:38:07,771 --> 01:38:12,771
supposed to deliver to Mexico City to
try to kill Castro a fast moving cancer

1946
01:38:14,010 --> 01:38:16,920
and what killed ruby a fast moving
cancer.

1947
01:38:17,310 --> 01:38:18,143
Yeah,
I guess.

1948
01:38:18,150 --> 01:38:21,540
And you know who's in charge of it all?
That guy that's on all the New York or

1949
01:38:21,541 --> 01:38:25,290
the New Orleans Saints football are.
Who's the famous doctor?

1950
01:38:25,291 --> 01:38:28,410
The clinic.
That's who judy worked for.

1951
01:38:28,650 --> 01:38:30,770
The cancer expert.
Thank you.

1952
01:38:30,780 --> 01:38:32,510
Give you cancer.
No,

1953
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:34,680
they.
They were attempting to create a fast

1954
01:38:34,681 --> 01:38:37,950
moving cancer.
And you think they give that to Jack

1955
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:38,300
Ruby?
No.

1956
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:41,040
Yeah,
because they were attempting to kill

1957
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:43,950
Castro with it.
Now,

1958
01:38:43,951 --> 01:38:46,410
do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald was
involved?

1959
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:51,960
I think Lee Harvey Oswald was an
undercover operative of our US

1960
01:38:51,961 --> 01:38:53,220
intelligence agency.

1961
01:38:53,220 --> 01:38:54,510
Yes.
You think he was involved in the

1962
01:38:54,511 --> 01:38:59,511
assassination attempt?
Maybe I or he was involved or thought he

1963
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:03,750
was stopping it because oswold loved
Kennedy.

1964
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,100
The whole thing is just such a crazy.
Liked Kennedy.

1965
01:39:08,101 --> 01:39:10,980
He didn't dislike him.
It's a crazy story.

1966
01:39:10,981 --> 01:39:15,981
So why would he kill him and why would
he use a weapon when you can get any

1967
01:39:16,141 --> 01:39:18,780
weapon in Texas?
Why would he use one that had a,

1968
01:39:18,840 --> 01:39:22,010
a paper trail on it?
What's interesting to me about this

1969
01:39:22,011 --> 01:39:23,250
story too.
Anyway though,

1970
01:39:23,251 --> 01:39:27,990
enough of Kennedy and I just want one
thing is that it shows how uncomfortable

1971
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:32,850
people are with embracing the
possibility of corruption to the extent

1972
01:39:32,851 --> 01:39:34,560
where they would kill the president.
It,

1973
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:39,570
it shows me why Jesse Ventura at times
is not popular.

1974
01:39:40,410 --> 01:39:42,600
Why do you talk about yourself in the
third person like Roy Jones?

1975
01:39:42,990 --> 01:39:47,910
Uh,
because he is a third person because he

1976
01:39:47,911 --> 01:39:48,840
is a third person.

1977
01:39:48,870 --> 01:39:50,880
Jesse Ventura is not,
you know what,

1978
01:39:50,910 --> 01:39:52,740
who are you?
That's my business.

1979
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:53,370
Oh,
okay.

1980
01:39:53,370 --> 01:39:54,300
You're superman,
right?

1981
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:55,860
Yeah.
Anyway.

1982
01:39:55,861 --> 01:39:56,694
Uh,
uh,

1983
01:39:56,920 --> 01:39:59,610
no.
What was her manner,

1984
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:01,870
Jessie?
She calls me honey.

1985
01:40:01,871 --> 01:40:02,340
You.
Ah,

1986
01:40:02,340 --> 01:40:06,480
that's sweet.
After 41 years least she's not swearing

1987
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:07,320
at me.
There you go.

1988
01:40:08,180 --> 01:40:10,500
I've done something right.
Anyway,

1989
01:40:10,501 --> 01:40:12,120
you lost my train of.
Sorry,

1990
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:16,080
I forgot where I was going anyway.
I don't remember.

1991
01:40:16,081 --> 01:40:17,460
Anyway,
it doesn't matter.

1992
01:40:17,570 --> 01:40:19,920
Um,
do you partake in marijuana yourself?

1993
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:22,770
Only in Colorado,
one in Colorado.

1994
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:25,190
What about California?
Only in Colorado,

1995
01:40:25,191 --> 01:40:26,160
but this right here,
buddy.

1996
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:28,260
I'm,
I might in California.

1997
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,520
This is liquid is a spray.
Spray it under your tongue.

1998
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:35,310
This is liquid too,
but it's not as powerful.

1999
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:37,350
This one put you on Pluto.
You gotta.

2000
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,180
Be Very careful about this one.
The uh,

2001
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:40,800
I made some mistakes.
I only,

2002
01:40:40,801 --> 01:40:42,390
I only uh,
uh,

2003
01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:44,790
partake where it's legal.
It's legal here.

2004
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,100
No one ain't checking medical.
I get you a doctor.

2005
01:40:47,130 --> 01:40:49,390
He'll be here in five minutes.
Well until you.

2006
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,090
Until you do that.
I don't.

2007
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:54,070
I'm not legal.
All the laws put online.

2008
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:56,410
I can do it online.
You can do it online now.

2009
01:40:56,530 --> 01:40:57,900
You can do it online here.
I

2010
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:01,240
just,
I know how I could get it.

2011
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,780
You know how I could do it.
How I'm a veteran.

2012
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,660
I get dreams.
Can't sleep at night and we'll also do.

2013
01:41:08,690 --> 01:41:09,940
You have had hip replacement,
right?

2014
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:10,601
Yep.
Yeah.

2015
01:41:10,601 --> 01:41:12,250
Well there you go.
That's,

2016
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:14,080
that's.
I actually had the new technique.

2017
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:16,540
They'll called hip resurfacing.
So what do they do there?

2018
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:18,910
It was new at the time in [inaudible]
eight.

2019
01:41:18,911 --> 01:41:22,930
I learned it from a neighbor and
Mexico's a triathlete and you should all

2020
01:41:22,931 --> 01:41:25,180
the triathletes get hip trouble.
Get this.

2021
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:27,430
The differences.
They still cut you and they still

2022
01:41:27,431 --> 01:41:30,190
dislocate your hip,
but they don't cut the femur.

2023
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:31,210
Oh,
okay.

2024
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:34,300
Clean up the ball and socket.
Cover them with carbon titanium,

2025
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:37,210
steel and puts you back together.
Just like resurfacing the road.

2026
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:39,040
A new layer of asphalt.

2027
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:40,440
So I,
my,

2028
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:42,850
my femur bones completely intact.
Oh,

2029
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:45,830
that's so much better.
Way Better Way,

2030
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:46,840
way,
way better.

2031
01:41:47,140 --> 01:41:50,770
And so I,
I actually now I do over a marathon a

2032
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:52,810
week on the elliptical machine.
That's incredible.

2033
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:54,490
So it doesn't,
you don't have any pain at all?

2034
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:55,480
No.
In fact,

2035
01:41:56,050 --> 01:42:00,250
a week ago I did 41 miles that week.
That's amazing.

2036
01:42:00,430 --> 01:42:02,380
No,
no restricting of your movement.

2037
01:42:02,381 --> 01:42:03,370
Nothing.
Well,

2038
01:42:04,450 --> 01:42:07,090
I'm 65.
When I sit down in a chair,

2039
01:42:07,091 --> 01:42:09,810
I tightened up and when I get up it's
like a.

2040
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:12,100
You get and that feels good.
And these,

2041
01:42:12,280 --> 01:42:15,670
these are a really good tutorial for
anomic chair.

2042
01:42:15,700 --> 01:42:17,080
For me.
It also was,

2043
01:42:17,110 --> 01:42:20,980
I didn't learn until I got to Mexico
with the physical therapist during my

2044
01:42:20,981 --> 01:42:24,010
wrestling career.
I had actually knocked my pelvis out of

2045
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:25,630
alignment.
Oh Wow.

2046
01:42:25,631 --> 01:42:27,520
And he said,
that's what's giving you your back

2047
01:42:27,521 --> 01:42:30,070
trouble.
So he gave me a bunch of stretches to do

2048
01:42:30,340 --> 01:42:33,520
where I got my pelvis back in alignment
and between that,

2049
01:42:33,521 --> 01:42:34,720
and I'll make a plug here.

2050
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:38,200
Do you ever watch on TV?
Those teeter hangers?

2051
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:39,730
Yeah,
they're phenomenal.

2052
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:40,990
I'm in the back.
Oh,

2053
01:42:40,991 --> 01:42:42,670
I love them.
They're a godsend.

2054
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:46,840
Yeah,
I do it every day for 10 to 12 minutes.

2055
01:42:46,841 --> 01:42:50,080
I hang upside down and I and I played
golf.

2056
01:42:50,081 --> 01:42:54,490
I haven't been back to the chiropractor
in two years because of that.

2057
01:42:54,700 --> 01:42:55,900
Yeah.
They every day,

2058
01:42:56,070 --> 01:43:00,580
every day at the end of my workout,
I hang up and down like dracula or like

2059
01:43:00,581 --> 01:43:04,240
a band,
and you actually get so comfortable.

2060
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:08,450
You go into kind of a limbo.
You know where you.

2061
01:43:08,470 --> 01:43:11,650
You're almost a conscious thing.
You're conscious,

2062
01:43:11,651 --> 01:43:14,730
but you're not hanging upside down.
Yeah.

2063
01:43:14,740 --> 01:43:16,090
You're blacking out.
Well,

2064
01:43:16,091 --> 01:43:18,820
not blacking out.
You're just so relaxed.

2065
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:19,421
Yeah,
no,

2066
01:43:19,421 --> 01:43:20,420
I get it all the time.
Yeah.

2067
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:21,220
Oh,
I see.

2068
01:43:21,220 --> 01:43:23,980
I and I tell people this thing is a
godsend.

2069
01:43:24,190 --> 01:43:26,230
If he called me,
I do ads for him.

2070
01:43:26,620 --> 01:43:29,830
Well,
it is a legitimate way to decompress

2071
01:43:29,831 --> 01:43:31,330
your spa without machines.

2072
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:32,350
It's healthy.
You can.

2073
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:33,340
And people,
uh,

2074
01:43:33,341 --> 01:43:34,950
you know,
I talked to a doctor wants to sit.

2075
01:43:35,030 --> 01:43:37,000
Your muscles are holding you in place.
You're not.

2076
01:43:37,001 --> 01:43:37,451
I'm like,
no,

2077
01:43:37,451 --> 01:43:39,040
they're not.
I relaxed my muscles.

2078
01:43:39,041 --> 01:43:40,810
I know how to relax my muscles.
I'm an athlete.

2079
01:43:40,811 --> 01:43:43,060
I know.
I know when my muscles are tense and

2080
01:43:43,061 --> 01:43:46,240
when they're not like,
you can absolutely get some relief and

2081
01:43:46,241 --> 01:43:49,390
decompression in your spine.
When I get full upside down,

2082
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:51,320
then I mentally go,
okay,

2083
01:43:51,380 --> 01:43:54,380
relax your feet,
relax your ankles.

2084
01:43:55,020 --> 01:43:58,880
I go through my whole body till I get
all the way to the shoulders and the

2085
01:43:58,881 --> 01:44:01,250
neck.
I'm going to show you a have back there

2086
01:44:01,251 --> 01:44:02,900
now though.
Then when I hang,

2087
01:44:02,901 --> 01:44:07,901
I'm totally relaxed and sometimes you
actually feel yourself slip right back

2088
01:44:08,511 --> 01:44:11,050
in and then you'd go,
ah,

2089
01:44:11,070 --> 01:44:12,890
I wanted to do.
Yeah,

2090
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:13,753
yeah.
I have one.

2091
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:17,180
It's like a harness it straps to adore
and I pull on it,

2092
01:44:17,181 --> 01:44:17,541
click,
click,

2093
01:44:17,541 --> 01:44:17,931
click,
click,

2094
01:44:17,931 --> 01:44:18,170
click.

2095
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,150
And I'm like literally hanging by my
neck.

2096
01:44:20,151 --> 01:44:24,110
It's a spinal decompression device.
So that's not one of them sexual things,

2097
01:44:24,990 --> 01:44:27,220
man.
Now,

2098
01:44:27,310 --> 01:44:30,260
uh,
I had a bulging disc in my neck and uh,

2099
01:44:30,261 --> 01:44:32,270
I relieved it that way and so it made a
huge,

2100
01:44:32,271 --> 01:44:33,440
huge difference.
Like I said,

2101
01:44:33,441 --> 01:44:33,920
I,
I,

2102
01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:36,650
you know,
I got the aches and pains of a 65 year

2103
01:44:36,651 --> 01:44:38,350
old I'd have,
I've had my hip done.

2104
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:43,040
I stopped running because my orthopedic
surgeon says no one over 40 should

2105
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:46,160
because really the pounding my friends,
49,

2106
01:44:46,161 --> 01:44:49,250
he just ran 200 miles still ultra
marathon.

2107
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:53,810
The pounding that he can't do it,
but he's going to pay the price,

2108
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,310
the pounding of his body,
like,

2109
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,770
like this Dr Truesdale told me today
with the technology they got,

2110
01:45:00,771 --> 01:45:03,860
you can run without pounding,
right with elliptical machines,

2111
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:06,890
machines.
He said it's the pounding.

2112
01:45:06,891 --> 01:45:08,300
It's not that you can't do it.

2113
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:11,630
Anyone can do it and train for what he
said the where,

2114
01:45:11,631 --> 01:45:15,080
that that's going to cause on your body
after age 40.

2115
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:18,380
And I have to agree,
he's the predominant orthopedic surgeon

2116
01:45:18,381 --> 01:45:20,030
of the Mayo Clinic.
Well,

2117
01:45:20,031 --> 01:45:21,950
you know,
there's also another issue and it's the

2118
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:23,930
creation of the running shoe because the
running shoe,

2119
01:45:23,931 --> 01:45:26,660
having that big wedge and the heel,
that's not a normal gait.

2120
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:29,180
The normal gait as you supposed to land
on the ball of your feet.

2121
01:45:29,181 --> 01:45:31,100
If you watch the little kids run,
that's how they run,

2122
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:35,330
but when they created the running shoe,
they allowed people to run and have all

2123
01:45:35,331 --> 01:45:38,420
their weight come down on their heel and
it acts as sort of like a little spring,

2124
01:45:38,720 --> 01:45:42,170
but that's not normal.
It's your body has a natural spring

2125
01:45:42,171 --> 01:45:45,560
built into it.
The design of the foot bar or you can do

2126
01:45:45,561 --> 01:45:47,450
the natural way the seals do.

2127
01:45:47,780 --> 01:45:49,940
How do they do it?
You're running the sand.

2128
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:51,180
That's great too.
Yeah,

2129
01:45:51,530 --> 01:45:55,040
that is the best way.
Paula had gotten even worse when they

2130
01:45:55,041 --> 01:45:59,720
take you in the soft sand dunes.
Dune running is fucking amazing.

2131
01:45:59,721 --> 01:46:00,320
I,
uh,

2132
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,010
I,
I.

2133
01:46:01,010 --> 01:46:04,730
There was an old chief there.
We used to call him superman.

2134
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,390
He was 41 years old when I was in the
teams.

2135
01:46:08,450 --> 01:46:13,450
Forty one and the softer the Sam,
the faster he got.

2136
01:46:14,060 --> 01:46:15,950
Oh,
we used to call him the Campbell.

2137
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:19,310
That was his nickname.
I one thing about chief,

2138
01:46:19,311 --> 01:46:23,240
but we called them the camel because
when we'd hit the soft sand running

2139
01:46:23,570 --> 01:46:26,900
normally in our team,
he was probably in the top six and

2140
01:46:26,901 --> 01:46:29,250
running.
When we'd hit the soft sand,

2141
01:46:29,251 --> 01:46:31,490
he was up first or second.
Why is that?

2142
01:46:31,640 --> 01:46:34,490
I don't know.
He could just run in the soft sand and

2143
01:46:34,491 --> 01:46:35,910
it didn't slow him down to.

2144
01:46:35,910 --> 01:46:37,700
They have like big wide flipper feet or
something.

2145
01:46:37,701 --> 01:46:39,230
No,
he was actually a little whiter,

2146
01:46:39,231 --> 01:46:41,330
rebuilt guy.
He also,

2147
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:43,550
he was able,
we had this big rope.

2148
01:46:43,790 --> 01:46:48,770
He could wear a pair of twin,
96 tanks for diving and he'd pull

2149
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:51,720
himself up to the top of this rope just
using his hands.

2150
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:53,390
Ninety pounds?
No,

2151
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:55,560
twin nineties.
That's what is called there.

2152
01:46:55,561 --> 01:46:57,000
How much do those weigh?
I don't know,

2153
01:46:57,001 --> 01:46:59,730
but they're heavy.
They're heavy as hell.

2154
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:04,080
They're the old twin.
90 Scuba tanks there.

2155
01:47:04,081 --> 01:47:08,730
Big Old metal tanks.
They were and he used to go up that rope

2156
01:47:08,731 --> 01:47:12,030
using just his hands.
That's a strength or why rebuild?

2157
01:47:12,060 --> 01:47:14,400
Not a big muscle guy.
Just why rebuilt?

2158
01:47:14,940 --> 01:47:17,190
We call,
we called him superman.

2159
01:47:17,191 --> 01:47:22,140
That was his nickname and the teams you
lead pt every day you do pt.

2160
01:47:22,141 --> 01:47:25,890
With him it was like in training unit,
every set of pushups 50.

2161
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:33,840
Every time you do pushups with him is 50
50 a pop and you probably do at least 10

2162
01:47:34,631 --> 01:47:39,040
to 12 sets.
That's great for tearing apart 600

2163
01:47:39,041 --> 01:47:42,520
pushups a day.
Then you'll do a thousand flutter kicks.

2164
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:44,230
What's a flutter kick?
Wham.

2165
01:47:44,240 --> 01:47:48,010
You're back at your kyc.
That sounds like a good time.

2166
01:47:49,150 --> 01:47:54,150
That along with running up sand dunes at
a party who's running sand dunes and the

2167
01:47:55,331 --> 01:47:57,520
other thing in training they don't
account for,

2168
01:47:57,730 --> 01:48:02,710
but you have to Rodan to run.
Every time you're moving and budge

2169
01:48:02,711 --> 01:48:04,210
training,
you have to be running.

2170
01:48:06,140 --> 01:48:09,050
You have to run to run,
so you're when you'd run out on the

2171
01:48:09,051 --> 01:48:10,910
beach,
but you have to run to get there and

2172
01:48:10,911 --> 01:48:15,710
then you have to run to get back.
Those don't count when you do a four

2173
01:48:15,711 --> 01:48:17,960
mile beach run,
it only counts on the beach.

2174
01:48:17,961 --> 01:48:21,800
It doesn't count the run to get there
and the run to get back to run to the

2175
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:23,390
Chow Hall,
the Rhonda and everywhere you.

2176
01:48:23,540 --> 01:48:27,470
When you're in budge training from the
time you start in the morning till they

2177
01:48:27,471 --> 01:48:30,470
secure you,
you have to be running anytime you're

2178
01:48:30,471 --> 01:48:31,820
moving.
Oh Jesus.

2179
01:48:32,870 --> 01:48:34,790
But,
but you do it as the airborne shuffle.

2180
01:48:34,791 --> 01:48:37,090
That's kind of that shuffle run where
you're,

2181
01:48:37,091 --> 01:48:37,880
you know,
you're,

2182
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:40,130
you're running,
but you're not really running kind of

2183
01:48:40,131 --> 01:48:40,990
jargon.
Yeah.

2184
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,240
He just hustling.
Yeah.

2185
01:48:42,710 --> 01:48:45,590
They call it the airborne shuffle
because that's should do a jump school.

2186
01:48:46,460 --> 01:48:51,460
What led you to want to write this book,
this marijuana want the experience I had

2187
01:48:52,580 --> 01:48:57,280
with the seizures and that's what
motivated me because I knew there's

2188
01:48:57,290 --> 01:48:59,030
other people out there suffering.

2189
01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:04,100
Our government should not be standing in
the way and stopping people from using a

2190
01:49:04,101 --> 01:49:09,101
plant that could help them and it's time
to end this ridiculous prohibition.

2191
01:49:10,161 --> 01:49:14,060
My mother who lived through the
Prohibition of alcohol told me before

2192
01:49:14,061 --> 01:49:16,130
she died,
she said,

2193
01:49:16,131 --> 01:49:19,430
the war on drugs is identical to the
Prohibition of alcohol.

2194
01:49:19,431 --> 01:49:23,540
All you're doing is making criminals
rich and powerful and it's also,

2195
01:49:23,541 --> 01:49:26,580
there's an industry and keeping people
in jail and as an industry,

2196
01:49:26,581 --> 01:49:28,320
you catching people in,
locking them up,

2197
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:31,070
check your rights,
losing your rights,

2198
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:33,430
imprisoning people.
And when you find out that there's

2199
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:37,250
prison guard unions that are lobbying to
keep marijuana illegal so they have more

2200
01:49:37,251 --> 01:49:38,840
work.
It's terrible,

2201
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:40,190
it's horrible,
it's horrible.

2202
01:49:40,191 --> 01:49:43,030
And they don't think of it as horrible,
but that's the perception.

2203
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:45,890
Got The dea who's out there making money
off,

2204
01:49:45,891 --> 01:49:48,790
keeping it illegal and you know what you
do.

2205
01:49:48,820 --> 01:49:50,530
They're doing it to fight for their
jobs,

2206
01:49:50,531 --> 01:49:52,630
but I've already got another position
for them.

2207
01:49:52,660 --> 01:49:57,660
But let's end the war on drugs.
Let's take the dea and let's make the

2208
01:49:58,721 --> 01:50:03,280
dea do put as much effort into sexual
crimes.

2209
01:50:05,590 --> 01:50:08,560
Like what kind of sexual crimes?
Molesting children.

2210
01:50:09,600 --> 01:50:11,770
Uh,
we just went through one in Minnesota,

2211
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:15,610
Jacob wetterling,
where they finally caught his murderer,

2212
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:20,800
but he's not going to go to prison for
murdering because he plea bargained what

2213
01:50:20,801 --> 01:50:22,150
happened?
You know,

2214
01:50:22,151 --> 01:50:26,200
the famous Jacob wetterling case.
You don't know where that could happen

2215
01:50:26,201 --> 01:50:30,340
way back 20 some years ago where he was,
him and his friends were going to the

2216
01:50:30,341 --> 01:50:33,790
video store and a guy took him at
gunpoint and you disappeared.

2217
01:50:34,150 --> 01:50:38,980
The Minnesota Vikings wore his thing on
their uniform and it was a whole

2218
01:50:38,981 --> 01:50:43,981
national thing when Jacob wetterling was
abducted while they just discovered his

2219
01:50:44,201 --> 01:50:46,460
dead body a month ago.
Oh,

2220
01:50:46,670 --> 01:50:50,800
because they caught the guy who did it,
but he wouldn't confess unless he got

2221
01:50:50,801 --> 01:50:54,310
immunity,
so they had to give him immunity and

2222
01:50:54,311 --> 01:50:58,240
then he led them to the body so they
could get closure over 20 some years

2223
01:50:58,241 --> 01:50:59,074
ago.

2224
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:01,630
So he got immunity to that.
But is he getting prosecuted for

2225
01:51:01,631 --> 01:51:04,090
something as getting prosecuted for
child porn?

2226
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:05,350
That's it.
Yup.

2227
01:51:07,090 --> 01:51:12,090
Now I say you take the dea and you put
them out catching child molesters and

2228
01:51:14,231 --> 01:51:18,610
sexual predators.
That would be a good job for them to do.

2229
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:22,580
It would be a good job for them to do,
but I would rather take people that are

2230
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:25,440
molesting children as our smoking pot.
Well,

2231
01:51:25,470 --> 01:51:28,600
the problem,
the problem might be they might have to

2232
01:51:28,601 --> 01:51:31,840
investigate the Catholic church and
that'd be off limits,

2233
01:51:31,841 --> 01:51:32,511
wouldn't it?
Well,

2234
01:51:32,511 --> 01:51:34,030
how about that one?
A good one.

2235
01:51:34,210 --> 01:51:35,920
Here's a good one.
I love good ones.

2236
01:51:36,100 --> 01:51:38,050
My Club,
the Mongols.

2237
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:41,380
We got busted for the Federal Rico laws,
right?

2238
01:51:42,340 --> 01:51:46,150
How come they don't apply the Federal
Rico laws to the Catholic Church?

2239
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:48,820
It's a good call.
Yeah,

2240
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,630
I'll come.
They don't child molestations of felony.

2241
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:55,600
They covered it up.
They lied about it.

2242
01:51:55,750 --> 01:51:59,920
They continue to do it.
How come the church hasn't been

2243
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:04,720
investigated under the Federal Rico Laws
and charged their questionnaire?

2244
01:52:04,721 --> 01:52:06,130
The church.
That's why.

2245
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:08,460
And you're not allowed to.
Well,

2246
01:52:08,461 --> 01:52:11,410
that's also why they hide them up in the
Vatican because the Vatican is its own

2247
01:52:11,411 --> 01:52:13,360
country.
I don't know.

2248
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:15,700
I'm not into all that.
I'm just saying that.

2249
01:52:16,090 --> 01:52:21,090
How come the Rico laws don't apply to
the child molestation that's gone on.

2250
01:52:21,670 --> 01:52:23,690
That's a very good point.
It's a very good point.

2251
01:52:23,691 --> 01:52:25,600
And when the,
when Pope Benedict resigned,

2252
01:52:25,690 --> 01:52:26,290
that was,
uh,

2253
01:52:26,290 --> 01:52:27,820
one of the things that they were going
after,

2254
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:31,210
they wanted to prosecute him for crimes
against humanity because this guy was

2255
01:52:31,211 --> 01:52:33,880
shielding child molesters.
He killed a child molester that went on

2256
01:52:33,881 --> 01:52:36,760
to rape 100 deaf kids.
I mean,

2257
01:52:36,790 --> 01:52:40,420
what in the fuck.
And this guy targeted deaf children

2258
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:42,990
because they couldn't talk about it and
now they,

2259
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:45,380
they stick them in the Vatican.
And once you're in the Vatican,

2260
01:52:45,381 --> 01:52:46,070
the Vatican is

2261
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:49,520
protected.
It's literally got its own situation

2262
01:52:49,521 --> 01:52:50,950
where it's like a country.
Yeah.

2263
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:52,310
Yeah.
Well,

2264
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:56,020
I mean I still don't think there's as
many people doing that as there are

2265
01:52:56,030 --> 01:52:58,430
selling and buying drugs.
So the dea

2266
01:52:58,660 --> 01:53:01,270
maybe not,
but what has come some other is the

2267
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:02,860
worst effect.
One hundred percent.

2268
01:53:02,861 --> 01:53:07,000
I agree with you because I know people
that were molested and never recovered

2269
01:53:07,001 --> 01:53:11,200
from it.
Their entire lives have been altered.

2270
01:53:11,220 --> 01:53:14,230
Yeah.
And it goes for generations because

2271
01:53:14,231 --> 01:53:17,140
generally you find the molester was
molested?

2272
01:53:17,680 --> 01:53:18,520
Yeah,
always.

2273
01:53:18,521 --> 01:53:19,241
Yeah.
You know,

2274
01:53:19,241 --> 01:53:22,000
usually that usually that's the
situation.

2275
01:53:22,360 --> 01:53:27,310
So I would rather take our focus away
from people doing consensual crime

2276
01:53:27,311 --> 01:53:32,311
against themselves because addiction
shouldn't be treated a criminally.

2277
01:53:32,860 --> 01:53:35,430
It should be treated medically.
I mean,

2278
01:53:35,530 --> 01:53:38,770
you can be addicted.
I always like to use this for an

2279
01:53:38,771 --> 01:53:42,310
example.
Imagine tomorrow if they took away

2280
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:45,730
coffee and caffeine.
Oh yeah,

2281
01:53:45,790 --> 01:53:47,500
we have riots on the street.
There you go.

2282
01:53:47,501 --> 01:53:50,770
And those are all addicts.
People addicted to it.

2283
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:51,790
Hoodies.
What are you trying to say,

2284
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:52,800
man?
No,

2285
01:53:52,860 --> 01:53:55,120
they're coffee.
They're addicted to it.

2286
01:53:55,420 --> 01:53:57,490
Well,
they need to understand that.

2287
01:53:57,880 --> 01:54:02,020
Then how dare them say you should take
away a drug from someone else.

2288
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:03,183
Of course,
when I.

2289
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:06,010
They have their fix.
Yeah.

2290
01:54:06,011 --> 01:54:07,480
How come theirs is legal?

2291
01:54:08,290 --> 01:54:11,980
I also don't think that we have to find
jobs for people that are doing something

2292
01:54:11,981 --> 01:54:15,850
that should be against the law.
It should be against the law to arrest

2293
01:54:15,851 --> 01:54:18,460
people for marijuana.
You don't have to find jobs for people

2294
01:54:18,461 --> 01:54:20,470
that are doing something that should be
against the law.

2295
01:54:20,740 --> 01:54:23,380
Arresting people for marijuana is a
fucking crime.

2296
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:26,680
And I've said this time and time again,
but if you lock someone in a cage

2297
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:28,840
because they smoke a plant,
that makes them happy,

2298
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:31,210
you're a fucking criminal,
you're a criminal,

2299
01:54:31,211 --> 01:54:33,730
you're.
You are doing a crime against human

2300
01:54:33,731 --> 01:54:36,970
beings and freedom and that's what
you're participating in.

2301
01:54:36,971 --> 01:54:41,260
So the dea is doing is a crime.
I don't think we have to find jobs for

2302
01:54:41,261 --> 01:54:43,210
criminals.
I think the only thing that's saving

2303
01:54:43,211 --> 01:54:46,780
them from being labeled as a criminal is
some shit that's written down on paper

2304
01:54:46,781 --> 01:54:49,870
by a bunch of people that are profiting
from keeping it in that same way.

2305
01:54:50,230 --> 01:54:51,880
It's a crime.
It's all crime.

2306
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,650
Yep.
And there's nothing.

2307
01:54:53,680 --> 01:54:55,030
Zero,
Zilch.

2308
01:54:55,090 --> 01:54:57,910
When it comes to the.
When you talking about the side effects

2309
01:54:58,090 --> 01:55:00,790
or the negative effects of cannabis,
there's nothing.

2310
01:55:01,190 --> 01:55:02,530
Zero.
There's no evidence.

2311
01:55:02,531 --> 01:55:03,730
I agree.
And if there was,

2312
01:55:03,731 --> 01:55:06,400
they would parade it out there.
And even if they did paraded out there,

2313
01:55:06,580 --> 01:55:10,090
what we're finding time and time again,
the most recent story that was in the

2314
01:55:10,090 --> 01:55:14,460
New York Times about the sugar industry,
paying off scientists to say that sugar

2315
01:55:14,461 --> 01:55:16,450
is okay for you,
but it's saturated fat,

2316
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:19,510
saturated fat.
Which is so important that it's one of

2317
01:55:19,511 --> 01:55:21,910
the main substrates for creating sex
hormones.

2318
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,260
It's one of the most important parts of
human diet that saturated fat is bad.

2319
01:55:26,261 --> 01:55:27,640
And that's what's giving people heart
attacks.

2320
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:29,970
Meanwhile,
people getting fat as fuck from shower.

2321
01:55:30,110 --> 01:55:30,410
I,

2322
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:35,410
I love to talk about this,
which came to light to me 10 years ago.

2323
01:55:36,150 --> 01:55:38,590
Uh,
I grew up in the fifties when they put

2324
01:55:38,591 --> 01:55:41,070
fluoride in our water.
Yeah.

2325
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:42,820
Wade.
And they put it in there for our.

2326
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:46,380
Well,
isn't that your parent's job to teach

2327
01:55:46,381 --> 01:55:49,530
you how to brush your teeth and Gargle
with Florida dated mouthwash?

2328
01:55:49,531 --> 01:55:51,040
Is there any benefit?
White Flora?

2329
01:55:51,090 --> 01:55:53,130
Wait,
why would you put a chemical in the

2330
01:55:53,131 --> 01:55:53,990
water?
Yeah,

2331
01:55:54,030 --> 01:55:55,680
there's a benefit.
I'll explain it.

2332
01:55:56,470 --> 01:55:58,770
Who,
who do you think was the first people to

2333
01:55:58,771 --> 01:56:01,350
put fluoride in water but the Nazis?
Yep.

2334
01:56:02,010 --> 01:56:03,690
Now why they do that now?
First of all,

2335
01:56:03,691 --> 01:56:06,420
I'd questioned anything the Nazis did
right away.

2336
01:56:06,421 --> 01:56:06,931
I'd say,
well,

2337
01:56:06,931 --> 01:56:09,450
Gee,
they don't have really people in mind

2338
01:56:09,451 --> 01:56:11,400
do.
They were really good at making engines.

2339
01:56:11,680 --> 01:56:13,970
Well that they were,
but uh,

2340
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:14,701
that.
No,

2341
01:56:14,701 --> 01:56:18,900
they did it because fluoride is the
major ingredient of PROZAC.

2342
01:56:21,700 --> 01:56:26,530
So you think that played in the water.
You're getting these daily dose,

2343
01:56:26,830 --> 01:56:29,740
daily dose of PROZAC.
Does.

2344
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:30,790
Why?
Why?

2345
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:34,930
Why would the Nazis do it?
What would be the only reason to.

2346
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:38,530
Not People Docile,
but did they do it in a large scale

2347
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:41,620
fashion or they do it as an experiment
because they did a lot of fucked up

2348
01:56:41,621 --> 01:56:42,670
experiment.
Well No,

2349
01:56:42,671 --> 01:56:47,170
they put it in their water.
Germany was the first country that put

2350
01:56:47,171 --> 01:56:49,960
fluoride in the water under the Nazi
rule.

2351
01:56:50,110 --> 01:56:53,050
And did they picked it up for their
teeth?

2352
01:56:53,051 --> 01:56:55,570
I guess that was why they did it.
I don't know,

2353
01:56:55,930 --> 01:56:58,930
but that's what we sold our people.
I remember.

2354
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:01,510
And here.
Did you see the movie Fargo?

2355
01:57:01,690 --> 01:57:02,950
Yes.
Member of the town.

2356
01:57:02,951 --> 01:57:04,240
Brainerd?
Yes.

2357
01:57:04,480 --> 01:57:05,950
Well,
brainerd Minnesota.

2358
01:57:05,951 --> 01:57:07,990
About 30 years ago.
I remember it.

2359
01:57:08,740 --> 01:57:12,130
They voted.
They did not want fluoride in their

2360
01:57:12,131 --> 01:57:14,110
water.
They weren't going to put it in.

2361
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:16,160
Federal government came in and made
them.

2362
01:57:16,740 --> 01:57:19,630
And why do you think they did that?
Is the fluoride industry paying them

2363
01:57:19,631 --> 01:57:21,160
off?
I don't know because they want to get

2364
01:57:21,161 --> 01:57:24,730
rid of.
Why would the federal government come

2365
01:57:24,731 --> 01:57:29,731
into a city who their own water supply
and forced them to put fluoride in the

2366
01:57:31,091 --> 01:57:31,924
water.

2367
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,810
Well,
do you think they did it because the

2368
01:57:34,811 --> 01:57:38,350
fluoride industry paid them off because
they didn't want to lose profits?

2369
01:57:38,390 --> 01:57:42,760
It doesn't make sense.
Or did they not want an example that you

2370
01:57:42,761 --> 01:57:46,030
can have water without fluoride?
It's possible,

2371
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:49,090
but if they really wanted to protect
people from Wednesday,

2372
01:57:49,120 --> 01:57:52,480
go after sugar or is it like Vince
Mcmahon?

2373
01:57:52,900 --> 01:57:57,730
He fired me because I wouldn't
relinquish my copyrighted name so he

2374
01:57:57,731 --> 01:58:01,660
could exploit that.
I owned it and I refused to give it up.

2375
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:04,780
The copywriter named Jesse,
Jesse Ventura.

2376
01:58:05,230 --> 01:58:09,460
I had it before I worked for them and I
copyrighted it federally so that I would

2377
01:58:09,461 --> 01:58:14,410
own it and I wouldn't release it to him.
And that's what ended up getting me

2378
01:58:14,411 --> 01:58:18,790
fired in the end where I had to leave
the wwf because,

2379
01:58:18,820 --> 01:58:19,340
uh,
he,

2380
01:58:19,340 --> 01:58:24,340
he had to control all of the marketing
that was old school before wwe.

2381
01:58:25,450 --> 01:58:27,040
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

2382
01:58:27,041 --> 01:58:29,620
I mean,
I don't know why fluoride in the water.

2383
01:58:29,621 --> 01:58:33,790
I've looked at it very peripheral,
no reason for it really.

2384
01:58:33,820 --> 01:58:37,240
They tell you it's for your teeth,
but shouldn't you do that yourself?

2385
01:58:37,270 --> 01:58:38,980
Will not.
My thinking is if they really were

2386
01:58:38,981 --> 01:58:42,070
concerned about people's teeth and
people's health wouldn't look at all the

2387
01:58:42,280 --> 01:58:45,580
different kinds of sugar that we're
consuming.

2388
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:49,390
All the corn syrup and people's Diet,
all the sugar and that tell you the

2389
01:58:49,410 --> 01:58:54,070
fluoride there for another reason then.
So you think there's a large scale

2390
01:58:54,071 --> 01:58:59,071
organized conspiracy to keep people
docile by putting Florida and the water.

2391
01:58:59,410 --> 01:59:03,880
I don't know if it's a large scale
conspiracy or if it was just done and

2392
01:59:03,881 --> 01:59:08,881
it's too difficult to unchange it.
She wants government gets established

2393
01:59:09,191 --> 01:59:12,340
doing something and it's done for
decades.

2394
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:17,550
It's very hard to get them to change
their position and is it in some ways a

2395
01:59:17,591 --> 01:59:21,520
lot like the dea in that once fluoride
is a business,

2396
01:59:21,550 --> 01:59:24,640
is a business and selling fluoride,
putting fluoride in the water.

2397
01:59:24,641 --> 01:59:26,290
There's people that have jobs.
They're doing that.

2398
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:29,650
They lobby to keep that in place.
And what evidence is there?

2399
01:59:29,651 --> 01:59:31,600
The floor has beneficial.
Is there any evidence?

2400
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:33,273
I don't know.

2401
01:59:33,610 --> 01:59:35,410
You don't know,
but if you know about this,

2402
01:59:35,411 --> 01:59:39,340
why don't you look into that because I
don't drink fluoridated water,

2403
01:59:39,341 --> 01:59:41,290
so it doesn't affect Mexico,
doesn't have Florida.

2404
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:42,250
You drink out of A.
Well,

2405
01:59:42,610 --> 01:59:43,480
yeah,
and,

2406
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:44,920
and in all my home,
she,

2407
01:59:44,921 --> 01:59:47,920
I only learned this a decade ago,
but ironically,

2408
01:59:47,921 --> 01:59:52,420
all the homes I've lived in have been
kind of rural and I've had my own.

2409
01:59:52,421 --> 01:59:56,770
Well all your life pretty much other
than when I grew up as a kid.

2410
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,540
Maybe that's why he still rebellious.
He didn't get your dose of Flora.

2411
01:59:59,541 --> 02:00:02,800
Exactly.
That's why I asked questions and stuff.

2412
02:00:02,801 --> 02:00:05,920
I haven't been.
I haven't been on PROZAC aided.

2413
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,560
I'm not on the PROZAC.
Well,

2414
02:00:08,561 --> 02:00:12,050
it didn't work with me because I've
drank a lot of fucking fluorided water

2415
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,940
constitutions are different than mine.
I don't know,

2416
02:00:16,090 --> 02:00:19,210
maybe I'm just better.
They say it calcifies your pineal gland,

2417
02:00:19,211 --> 02:00:21,100
but the people that say that,
they all smell,

2418
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:24,190
they all smell like natural deodorant
and feet.

2419
02:00:24,430 --> 02:00:26,200
When mother fuckers,
like I said it,

2420
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:26,800
uh,
you know,

2421
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:31,000
the brainerd tried to do it and the
federal government came in and just

2422
02:00:31,001 --> 02:00:32,680
slapped him down.
It didn't matter,

2423
02:00:32,681 --> 02:00:34,660
the people voted,
didn't matter,

2424
02:00:34,661 --> 02:00:37,240
nothing.
Federal government came in and said,

2425
02:00:37,241 --> 02:00:41,010
you will have fluoride in your water.
What year was this thick?

2426
02:00:41,070 --> 02:00:44,620
It was back in the eighties.
I wonder if that would fly today because

2427
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:49,410
people today are so concerned with
genetically modified foods and I think

2428
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:51,430
they'd still do it today because you
still got it.

2429
02:00:51,730 --> 02:00:53,460
Nobody's ever said nothing.
Like,

2430
02:00:53,890 --> 02:00:56,260
why don't we remove fluoride from the
water?

2431
02:00:58,570 --> 02:00:59,330
Yeah,
I don't.

2432
02:00:59,330 --> 02:01:00,250
I don't know.
I mean,

2433
02:01:00,340 --> 02:01:02,110
nobody.
Nobody brings it up.

2434
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:03,551
Yeah.
I don't even know.

2435
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:05,640
Florida is beneficial in toothpaste.
Uh,

2436
02:01:05,690 --> 02:01:07,590
there's a lot of people that don't
believe floor at should be in

2437
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:09,820
toothpaste.
I think that with the cleaning of your

2438
02:01:09,821 --> 02:01:13,360
teeth is really what gets the.
The plan goes.

2439
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:14,201
Yeah.
Who knows?

2440
02:01:14,201 --> 02:01:18,520
But someone must have just a major
ingredient of PROZAC.

2441
02:01:18,580 --> 02:01:20,850
I'm going to go looking into that now.
Dammit.

2442
02:01:20,900 --> 02:01:23,080
Another rabbit hole.
I got to whitewash.

2443
02:01:23,081 --> 02:01:25,210
I got to go down on PROZAC.
Rabbit hole.

2444
02:01:25,960 --> 02:01:27,160
PROZAC.
Fluoride,

2445
02:01:27,161 --> 02:01:28,130
rabbit hole.
Flora.

2446
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:30,220
Just flow.
But when you think about it,

2447
02:01:30,221 --> 02:01:34,210
why would they put it for your teeth?
Your parents do that.

2448
02:01:34,211 --> 02:01:36,610
They teach you how to brush your teeth
and use mouthwash.

2449
02:01:36,611 --> 02:01:38,530
Why would you put a chemical in the
water?

2450
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:40,160
That's a good point.
Why

2451
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:43,520
would a chemical be introduced into
clean drinking water?

2452
02:01:43,970 --> 02:01:44,810
Well,
not only that,

2453
02:01:44,811 --> 02:01:48,080
there's a lot of people that don't even
drink water from the faucet anymore.

2454
02:01:48,380 --> 02:01:50,690
You know,
a lot of people use the faucet water for

2455
02:01:50,691 --> 02:01:53,630
bathing and cooking and they drink
bottled water.

2456
02:01:53,660 --> 02:01:55,760
Yeah,
well that's another scam they pulled on

2457
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:56,850
the bottle.
Yeah,

2458
02:01:57,530 --> 02:01:58,820
completely.
I did it.

2459
02:01:58,821 --> 02:02:00,860
And conspiracy theory,
we went up to Michigan.

2460
02:02:00,861 --> 02:02:02,300
We're nationally is.
Yeah,

2461
02:02:02,301 --> 02:02:03,650
they,
they take water.

2462
02:02:03,770 --> 02:02:06,260
Well,
the law says you cannot take water from

2463
02:02:06,261 --> 02:02:07,620
the Great Lakes.
Right?

2464
02:02:07,730 --> 02:02:12,470
And the Great Lakes region is 20 percent
of the fresh water of the world,

2465
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:16,490
so naturally goes up there and builds a
million square foot,

2466
02:02:16,491 --> 02:02:19,970
plant the things huge.
It's bigger than our dome stadium.

2467
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:23,720
For the Vikings.
They got this huge plant up there and

2468
02:02:23,721 --> 02:02:26,120
all they do is they punch in at a
tributary,

2469
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:29,120
so they're technically not taking it
from the Great Lakes.

2470
02:02:29,121 --> 02:02:31,250
They're taking it before it gets there.

2471
02:02:31,610 --> 02:02:35,900
The Great Lakes have now fallen there
six inches lower than they used to be

2472
02:02:36,230 --> 02:02:40,160
and I was taken to a stream that used to
have white water rafting.

2473
02:02:40,490 --> 02:02:44,840
It now does.
It's dead water just because of Nestle.

2474
02:02:44,900 --> 02:02:46,670
Yeah,
they're sucking it all out of the ground

2475
02:02:46,671 --> 02:02:50,150
before it can get to the Great Lakes and
they're putting it in plastic bottles

2476
02:02:50,300 --> 02:02:53,180
and selling it to you.
More expensive than gas.

2477
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:56,990
It is bottled water costs more than gas
and that fucking.

2478
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Imagine if you've got a company and you
sell a product that's free and you and

2479
02:03:02,241 --> 02:03:06,230
you don't have to do nothing to it,
but put it into a bottle and sell it for

2480
02:03:06,231 --> 02:03:09,020
more than gas cars.
They persuaded us.

2481
02:03:09,260 --> 02:03:12,860
It was the only way to consume water.
Like when I was a kid,

2482
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:16,490
you'd go to the schoolyard and play
football all day on the way home.

2483
02:03:16,820 --> 02:03:21,410
You'd run up to somebody whos you'd turn
it on and everybody would drink out of

2484
02:03:21,411 --> 02:03:22,244
the hose.

2485
02:03:22,550 --> 02:03:25,520
We didn't die.
Nobody got sick.

2486
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,940
We survived.
Yet all of a sudden here came.

2487
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:34,000
Bottled water had to be bottled and it
was a whole thing they did on people.

2488
02:03:35,900 --> 02:03:39,470
The only pure clear water you're going
to get comes from bottle.

2489
02:03:39,471 --> 02:03:42,140
Well at eight,
they're pumping it out of the ground the

2490
02:03:42,141 --> 02:03:44,690
same way as they pump anything else out
of the ground.

2491
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,440
They're just putting it into a bottle
and selling it to you for more than

2492
02:03:48,441 --> 02:03:51,410
gasoline.
Your friend is interrupting here.

2493
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:53,780
What would you like?
I got to go.

2494
02:03:53,810 --> 02:03:56,120
This is the reason why I don't let
people in the studio,

2495
02:03:56,170 --> 02:03:57,370
Jesse,
but I,

2496
02:03:57,380 --> 02:04:01,400
I know you have a hard out at 1:15.
I'm your book.

2497
02:04:01,460 --> 02:04:05,540
It's available now.
Want to come out I think on the sixth

2498
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:07,790
and you're going to be at barnes and
noble and Santa Monica tonight,

2499
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,970
tonight at 7:30 7:30.
And people come meet you and explained

2500
02:04:11,990 --> 02:04:13,340
to you why fluoride in the water.

2501
02:04:13,340 --> 02:04:16,520
They're going to go crazy now.
They can do all that stuff and what we

2502
02:04:16,521 --> 02:04:20,580
can talk and visit and uh,
I'll weave a few stories in.

2503
02:04:20,610 --> 02:04:24,860
And like every,
the only thing I worry about every book

2504
02:04:24,861 --> 02:04:29,861
signing I do,
I get pleads from people on why I'm not

2505
02:04:29,931 --> 02:04:31,970
running well.
I'm bleeding,

2506
02:04:32,780 --> 02:04:33,351
I'm bleeding.
Look,

2507
02:04:33,351 --> 02:04:36,770
somebody needs to run.
That's not corrupted by the system as

2508
02:04:36,771 --> 02:04:38,310
well.
Think you're corrupted by the system.

2509
02:04:38,311 --> 02:04:39,750
There's only me.
Yeah.

2510
02:04:39,751 --> 02:04:42,270
Well I think there's probably a few
other people that are thinking right

2511
02:04:42,271 --> 02:04:43,590
now,
but they don't want this.

2512
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:48,210
I only raised 300,000 bucks to become
the governor of Minnesota,

2513
02:04:48,420 --> 02:04:49,980
but that's Minnesota.
I mean,

2514
02:04:49,981 --> 02:04:51,780
I think my dog might be able to win
government.

2515
02:04:51,790 --> 02:04:55,410
Not really because the devolution repub
spent $12 million that year.

2516
02:04:56,430 --> 02:05:00,380
Well they spent 12 million bucks.
Your Jesse Ventura was famous or

2517
02:05:00,381 --> 02:05:01,830
thousand.
Yeah,

2518
02:05:01,831 --> 02:05:06,831
but I had to go through the media of,
of them a degrading me.

2519
02:05:07,080 --> 02:05:10,080
How could a wrestler be a governor?
Right?

2520
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:12,930
How could,
how could somebody from the private

2521
02:05:12,931 --> 02:05:17,931
sector who's never come up through the
corrupt system be expected to govern,

2522
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:21,570
but also don't you think it helps you
have an awesome Minnesota accent?

2523
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:24,450
That's the building official.
You definitely do.

2524
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:25,530
Oh,
I don't do that.

2525
02:05:25,531 --> 02:05:26,850
If my friend,
Randall Carlson,

2526
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,890
Minnesota.
You don't know it.

2527
02:05:29,160 --> 02:05:31,800
My friend ran from Alabama.
You don't have.

2528
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:34,180
You don't have an accent,
Alabama.

2529
02:05:34,200 --> 02:05:37,740
No.
They have to know my friend Randall

2530
02:05:37,740 --> 02:05:38,910
Carlson.
Sounds exactly like you.

2531
02:05:38,970 --> 02:05:40,410
And he's from Minnesota.
Exactly.

2532
02:05:40,590 --> 02:05:42,690
You said you have a very clear of
Minnesota accent.

2533
02:05:42,691 --> 02:05:43,940
Yeah,
we have it and uh,

2534
02:05:43,990 --> 02:05:45,240
you know,
I'm born and raised there,

2535
02:05:45,241 --> 02:05:47,730
but I don't know how to skate.
You don't have a skate?

2536
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:48,960
I don't either.
Good for you.

2537
02:05:49,260 --> 02:05:50,130
I'm down.
Well,

2538
02:05:50,131 --> 02:05:53,010
I,
I did it because I in the winter I swam.

2539
02:05:53,110 --> 02:05:54,080
We have in common.

2540
02:05:54,090 --> 02:05:56,280
You and me.
I was just like fanny packs.

2541
02:05:56,550 --> 02:05:59,130
We both don't know how to skate.
We both like pot.

2542
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,110
I was a swimmer.
I could swim.

2543
02:06:01,320 --> 02:06:01,740
Yeah.
No,

2544
02:06:01,740 --> 02:06:03,840
I did it though,
but I mean all winter and summer I was

2545
02:06:03,841 --> 02:06:05,430
competitive.
Now my claim to fame,

2546
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,330
I actually swam in the same pool once
with Mark Spitz.

2547
02:06:09,510 --> 02:06:14,510
That's big for me because as a swimmer
he was God the Var air right in the long

2548
02:06:14,821 --> 02:06:15,601
game.
Phelps,

2549
02:06:15,601 --> 02:06:19,890
who I never thought could win another,
a more medals than mark did know the guy

2550
02:06:19,891 --> 02:06:21,360
who likes pot.
Yeah,

2551
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:23,790
remember that he got shamed,
they fought shame.

2552
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:26,370
Do you know what I woulda did?
If I'd have been him and they did that

2553
02:06:26,371 --> 02:06:27,540
to me,
what would you have done?

2554
02:06:27,600 --> 02:06:30,380
I would have immediately moved to
Australia,

2555
02:06:30,690 --> 02:06:35,690
applied for Australian citizenship,
and I would have came back and beat the

2556
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:37,830
United States if they prosecuted me for
the pot.

2557
02:06:38,060 --> 02:06:39,160
Yeah,
but they weren't prosecuting.

2558
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:41,250
You thought about it.
Did they really?

2559
02:06:41,560 --> 02:06:42,750
Yeah,
about prosecuting.

2560
02:06:43,050 --> 02:06:44,510
Oh,
it went onto.

2561
02:06:44,610 --> 02:06:45,421
Oh,
that's right.

2562
02:06:45,421 --> 02:06:47,370
Wasn't it like South Carolina?
I don't know,

2563
02:06:47,470 --> 02:06:50,180
but uh,
but all I know is a fight of been

2564
02:06:50,190 --> 02:06:52,230
phelps.
I would've moved to Australia.

2565
02:06:52,231 --> 02:06:55,620
I'd applied for Australian citizenship
and I would've come back and swam

2566
02:06:55,621 --> 02:06:59,250
against the United States and say,
stick that up your ass.

2567
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:01,440
That's very rude of,
you know,

2568
02:07:01,441 --> 02:07:02,910
at a renegade.
No,

2569
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:05,040
it ain't.
It's very rude of them.

2570
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:08,610
After winning those medals,
don't you think he earned a joint?

2571
02:07:08,840 --> 02:07:10,700
I do.
I do.

2572
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:12,560
And you do as well?
Yeah.

2573
02:07:13,320 --> 02:07:16,350
They wouldn't have said nothing if he
had guzzled a bottle of beer.

2574
02:07:16,410 --> 02:07:18,470
I want to find out what the fuck.
Narc Dunham.

2575
02:07:18,540 --> 02:07:21,300
We should make that public.
Whoever that shit had is,

2576
02:07:21,301 --> 02:07:23,510
it took the picture of Phelps.
Exactly.

2577
02:07:24,070 --> 02:07:25,110
Exactly.
Arrested him.

2578
02:07:25,111 --> 02:07:29,370
Michael Phelps case.
What people were arrested that had pot

2579
02:07:29,390 --> 02:07:30,330
that gave him pot.
Oh,

2580
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:33,260
Jesus Christ.
Did you see that thing about the woman

2581
02:07:33,261 --> 02:07:36,100
in in western Massachusetts or near
Amherst?

2582
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:39,520
She's an old lady and she grew her own
medical marijuana.

2583
02:07:39,580 --> 02:07:44,580
Her son was in the house and a swat team
showed up guns blazing for one plant,

2584
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:49,190
one plant in this woman's backyard.
That's how fucking ridiculous.

2585
02:07:49,480 --> 02:07:51,510
I'll.
I'll tell you all ridiculously are.

2586
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:53,530
When I was governor,
and we'll finish with this.

2587
02:07:53,560 --> 02:07:57,370
When I was governor,
we had a three panel myself.

2588
02:07:57,730 --> 02:08:01,870
Kathleen blatch who was head of the
Minnesota Supreme Court and the attorney

2589
02:08:01,871 --> 02:08:05,050
general,
the three of us with the pardon board

2590
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:07,570
where we could expunge records.
Right?

2591
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:13,000
And I was glad they thought like me
because everybody that came to us that

2592
02:08:13,001 --> 02:08:16,330
had a marijuana conviction of 10:20
years ago,

2593
02:08:16,810 --> 02:08:21,160
we cleaned it off and one of them.
I'll always remember wally here,

2594
02:08:21,190 --> 02:08:23,680
this story,
this guy,

2595
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:27,400
when he sat down in front of us,
the first thing I did,

2596
02:08:27,401 --> 02:08:28,240
I looked at him.
I said,

2597
02:08:28,241 --> 02:08:30,310
how are you and your sister getting
along?

2598
02:08:30,760 --> 02:08:32,110
And he smiled at me,
says,

2599
02:08:32,111 --> 02:08:33,640
we're okay.
I said,

2600
02:08:33,641 --> 02:08:34,960
okay.
I just wanted to check.

2601
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:39,610
You know what happened to this guy?
He was 18 years old at home.

2602
02:08:39,970 --> 02:08:43,300
His little sister was going to dare at
the time,

2603
02:08:43,301 --> 02:08:48,301
you know that dare class while they
teach at dare to turn everyone in to

2604
02:08:48,491 --> 02:08:48,880
rap.

2605
02:08:48,880 --> 02:08:53,620
Everybody turned them in.
So this guy's got a bag of weed in his

2606
02:08:53,621 --> 02:08:57,040
bedroom.
His little sister sees it,

2607
02:08:57,550 --> 02:09:00,940
calls the police,
the police come.

2608
02:09:01,180 --> 02:09:05,830
She's there to let them in so they don't
need a warrant and they go bust her

2609
02:09:05,831 --> 02:09:09,490
brother.
She ends up her brother and her brother

2610
02:09:09,491 --> 02:09:14,491
now has had this on his record for 20
freaking years of marijuana bust that

2611
02:09:15,791 --> 02:09:20,791
his sister turned him over on because
she was at Derr and Derr said your rad

2612
02:09:22,031 --> 02:09:25,540
everybody.
So the sister thinks she's doing the

2613
02:09:25,541 --> 02:09:29,560
right thing.
Puts her brother in jail for having a

2614
02:09:29,561 --> 02:09:32,080
bag of weed in his bedroom.
So sad.

2615
02:09:32,210 --> 02:09:35,230
And that's why I asked him,
how are you and your sister getting

2616
02:09:35,231 --> 02:09:36,430
along?
You said we're fine,

2617
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:40,420
and I sit and we cleaned his record.
We wiped it right off of there.

2618
02:09:40,540 --> 02:09:44,410
Now who?
I wouldn't do that for child molesters,

2619
02:09:44,411 --> 02:09:49,411
who came in and I had a girl there who
came to testify against this guy so we

2620
02:09:51,491 --> 02:09:52,324
wouldn't do it.

2621
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:55,210
I called her up to me and I said,
young lady,

2622
02:09:55,960 --> 02:10:00,370
you don't have to come back here anymore
because as long as I'm the governor of

2623
02:10:00,371 --> 02:10:05,170
Minnesota,
this guy will never ever get his record

2624
02:10:05,290 --> 02:10:09,100
cleaned.
You don't have to worry about that.

2625
02:10:09,130 --> 02:10:11,980
Go home with a clear conscience.
You don't have to come back here.

2626
02:10:11,981 --> 02:10:16,450
It's not gonna happen because all of
them child molesters re-offend.

2627
02:10:17,320 --> 02:10:21,070
That's why they want their record
cleaned off so that they can get in a

2628
02:10:21,071 --> 02:10:26,071
position of being a Predator again and
re-offend again and and they bring in.

2629
02:10:26,740 --> 02:10:31,720
They bring in people from the clergy to
testify for them and all these joined

2630
02:10:31,721 --> 02:10:33,770
the church.
Now they've done it.

2631
02:10:33,771 --> 02:10:37,550
They do all of this stuff.
They pull in that smoke on me.

2632
02:10:38,030 --> 02:10:39,860
I to me,
a child molester,

2633
02:10:39,861 --> 02:10:42,080
it's a d.
They could never be cured.

2634
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:45,740
Jesse Ventura for president in 2020.
Make it happen folks.

2635
02:10:45,950 --> 02:10:48,860
Two thousand 16 is a wash.
