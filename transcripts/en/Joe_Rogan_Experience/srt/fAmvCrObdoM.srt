1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,780
Five four,
three,

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:04,614
two,

3
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,550
boom.
Justin trail,

4
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:10,480
the jungle.
Look,

5
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,210
you got coconut water.
Are you ready to party?

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,200
Oh,
absolutely.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,990
You got to have them just in case.
Oh,

8
00:00:15,991 --> 00:00:17,520
I live off of that stuff.
Um,

9
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,160
so first of all,
congratulations on your belt or fight,

10
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,240
man.
He looked outstanding.

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,250
Thank you.
Thanks a lot.

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,630
Like it's really like clicking man.
It's really coming together.

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,180
Finally,
the muscle memories back and uh,

14
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,710
I met a new camp that's great for my 
style training with Rafael Lovato Jr uh,

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,410
maybe the best American grappler for 
Bjj.

16
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,640
Most accomplished,
maybe.

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,563
He's fantastic.
So you're in Oklahoma is or where he's 

18
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,444
at.
Oklahoma just moved there and then 

19
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,820
December I moved there to train and 
interesting train alongside him.

20
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:47,880
And that's also where water four is 
headquartered out of Oklahoma City.

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,650
How fucking convenient.
Absolutely.

22
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:52,530
So now I have the best of both worlds.
My two passions right there.

23
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:54,690
That's it.
May He's,

24
00:00:54,691 --> 00:00:59,280
he's really good ban.
Rafael Lovato has that pressure style to

25
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:03,450
that Solow Barrow smashing style.
Very Fun to watch that guy.

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,313
The only guy I've ever felt 
claustrophobic underneath without a 

27
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,580
doubt.
He's just,

28
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,380
I can't,
I can't explain it.

29
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:12,000
You just cannot get away that smash 
pass,

30
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:12,834
that pressure pass out.
He just melts into you and there's no 

31
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,074
escape.
It's like he's melting and he's like 

32
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:17,860
glue.
Yeah.

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,590
Salo John G,
the whole,

34
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,380
that whole family of that style of 
Jujitsu.

35
00:01:22,381 --> 00:01:23,214
So powerful man.
I've gotten to meet both of them now a 

36
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,750
train.
It was Salo and then Shawn Gee was there

37
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:28,500
and,
uh,

38
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,333
our corner.
So it was pretty awesome for a bill to 

39
00:01:30,661 --> 00:01:32,010
our flight.
I was Kinda,

40
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,280
I was Kinda bummed out.
Rafael Lovato,

41
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:38,220
his last fight,
he stopped and with strikes I was like,

42
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:39,810
God damn it.
I kicked him in the head.

43
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,940
13 seconds.
Yeah,

44
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,701
it was crazy.
I mean,

45
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,040
it's great to see him succeed and do 
well,

46
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:45,810
but I wanted to see his Jujitsu.
Oh yeah,

47
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,700
absolutely.
Just getting the wheel.

48
00:01:47,701 --> 00:01:49,180
But he's,
man,

49
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,100
he's an animal.
Honestly.

50
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,260
He's one of those guys that is so well 
rounded.

51
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:54,450
And you think he's just one dimensional,
uh,

52
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:56,100
because of everything he's done in 
Jujitsu,

53
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:58,650
but he grew up kickboxing doing.
Yeah.

54
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,600
His Dad's been a lifelong martial 
artist,

55
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,523
a senior.
He's an incredible guy and he's been 

56
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:06,630
taking roughly I'll all around the world
since he was a little boy,

57
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,350
having them train mixed martial arts,
not just Jujitsu his whole life.

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,060
And he's fighting bell tours as well,
right?

59
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,140
Yeah.
That was his first fight,

60
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:15,090
so we fought back to back.
He fought right before me.

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,530
I fought right after him.
Oh,

62
00:02:16,531 --> 00:02:17,540
that's nice.
Yeah.

63
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,620
Bella towards making some moves,
man.

64
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,483
You know they're,
they're doing mitre owned versus fader 

65
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,230
and they're going to Lorens lark and 
just signed with them.

66
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,390
Yeah,
Roy Mcdonald's signed with them.

67
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,160
That's a stable,
now they have a legit state,

68
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,720
especially their 170 pound division.
It's super legit.

69
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,610
Daily Mvp,
Lima,

70
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:37,280
Lima,
Koresh Golf.

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,680
That's a serious division man.
And now fade or very interesting.

72
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:43,823
What did you think about the fade or 
mitre own thing where they had to pull 

73
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,064
out like Mitchell and had to pull out 
because of his kidney stone and then 

74
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:53,370
they're going to schedule it again.
Apparently Madison Square Gardens.

75
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,263
So June's paper,
paper view first one for Bella tour or 

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,633
if he was tough man,
it's tough to get people to buy 

77
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,310
something they've been getting for free.

78
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,570
Right.
And uh,

79
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,480
but I think,
I think this card there,

80
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,420
they're stacking it pretty heavily 
versus vanderbilt,

81
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,700
which that's where Rafael has been going
down into,

82
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,330
I forget to say it,
but cure tb.

83
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,873
Brazil,
yeah.

84
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,833
Down there.
And was sparring with vander before his 

85
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,120
fight is a fight apparently.
Yes.

86
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,240
Yes.
He sent me a meme of something like,

87
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,950
let's train easy.
Um,

88
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,000
and then releasing like,
yeah,

89
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:28,660
train easy.
But it's that picture of him and a pride

90
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,494
or something or maybe training where 
he's jumping in the air and he's just 

91
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,180
coming down with a big hammer fist and 
gonna land on you with his feet.

92
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,690
That's a light day.
He's kind of known for that.

93
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:39,760
Just being a barbarian 24,
seven.

94
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,650
Yeah.
But that's why he's so fun to watch.

95
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,020
And I think what you said and just asked
about what did I think between fader and

96
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,160
Matt Mitrione when they had to pull out,
man,

97
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,810
I,
I flashed back right away to,

98
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:51,683
do you remember whenever Stephan struve 
had to pull out of his fight with Mitch 

99
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:59,440
reone backstage and they were,
he was like blacking out or something,

100
00:03:59,441 --> 00:03:59,610
right?

101
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,443
Yeah.
It's a serious pastiche a couple of 

102
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:01,854
times.
And he was having that heart problem as 

103
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:03,724
well.
Uh,

104
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:06,160
but Mitch Rune was back there all gloved
up,

105
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,930
already taped up,
had his gloves on,

106
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:08,764
was hitting Mitts,
and then there were some of the behind 

107
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,104
the scenes cameras that caught a moment 
where I believe it was Dana coming back 

108
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,884
there,
tell him the fight was canceled and 

109
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,680
Mitroville and just was,
you know,

110
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,300
cussing up a storm.
No Way.

111
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,290
No,
not at all.

112
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,124
No.
But then all of a sudden you saw it 

113
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:25,540
shift where all of a sudden he was 
worried about Stephan and he walked down

114
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,940
there,
went backstage or to his locker room and

115
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:29,774
man,
he just hugged him and Stephan was 

116
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:32,710
sobbing and Matt Mitrione was just like,
you know,

117
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:33,670
hey,
it's all right bro.

118
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,250
I know if you could fight,
you would have and all the other stuff.

119
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,520
And so I guess he had passed at least 
one or two kidney stones,

120
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,950
the fight week,
a couple days before wins.

121
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,043
Um,
and then the day of the fight they just 

122
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,234
started coming back out.
I think he had something like 15 or 20 

123
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:49,570
times.
So man,

124
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:51,620
uh,
I know all the ladies out there you are,

125
00:04:51,621 --> 00:04:52,980
you're a lot tougher than us,
uh,

126
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,150
giving birth.
But I hear this is the equivalent,

127
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:55,901
you know,
for the men,

128
00:04:55,901 --> 00:04:57,790
it's passed out any stone.
I doubt it.

129
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,683
Yeah.
That's be like more like passing a 

130
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:02,800
marble three your call,
you know,

131
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,100
maybe even a golf ball.
It seems like it's not even close.

132
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,300
Yeah,
it probably hurts.

133
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,530
It sucks.
Yeah,

134
00:05:08,531 --> 00:05:10,210
it does.
But that 15 or 20 of them,

135
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:13,030
something like that and that would be 
brutal instead of just one or two.

136
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,120
They are a side effect of weight cutting
for a lot of people.

137
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,630
Right.
Like I know Aldo had one and a,

138
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,280
I think some other fighters have had 
them too and I think it has to do,

139
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:24,850
there's some sort of connection with 
massive dehydration,

140
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,530
which I'm sure Matt doesn't have to 
worry about,

141
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,690
you know,
fighting heavyweight.

142
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:29,950
It doesn't have to cut the weight like 
that.

143
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,720
So I wonder what what caused his,
yeah,

144
00:05:31,721 --> 00:05:32,441
I don't know.
But yeah,

145
00:05:32,441 --> 00:05:33,274
exactly.
I mean you're putting some your kidneys 

146
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:35,620
through so much when you're cutting 
weight,

147
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:38,600
especially those extreme weight cuts.
Yeah,

148
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,580
I'm lucky.
I'm a heavy weight,

149
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,610
very fortunate dude.
Fuck all that man.

150
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,540
Yeah.
Like what do you walk around at?

151
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,090
Like what's your,
when you're in shape,

152
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:50,440
like you're in shape right now.
I weigh two 48 that's a good size man.

153
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:53,710
Right to 45 don't you think they think 
that that to 40 numbers,

154
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:56,540
like the right number for heavyweights.
They feel like not,

155
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,130
I don't know who they are,
but it was just talking

156
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,790
shit.
Yeah.

157
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:59,990
They think that,
um,

158
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,913
the,
the conventional wisdom is when you get 

159
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,410
into to sixties and above and you know,
like above two 50 that there's,

160
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,410
there's a point of diminishing returns 
where you're,

161
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,710
you're carrying around so much mass,
you can't really perform as well.

162
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,763
But a 240 pound guy is so big and so 
strong that you can handle a 265 pound 

163
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:19,784
guy,
but you have more endurance and it's 

164
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:22,170
just a better wait.

165
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,910
I totally agree with that.
I mean,

166
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,220
when I was living at the Olympic 
training center in wrestling there,

167
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:31,221
the weight class was to 64.5 or 120 
kilos and we always try to stay above it

168
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,920
and then cut for the,
to make weight because wrestling,

169
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,810
I mean being the single sport or 
wrestling,

170
00:06:36,811 --> 00:06:39,270
like you need that weight,
it's only six minute match.

171
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,870
Um,
and then the new Greco Roman rules,

172
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,760
I mean you get three breaks in between a
two period round.

173
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,310
Um,
and so you're getting that weight.

174
00:06:47,311 --> 00:06:48,144
You need it to throw the guy around when
it comes to them and May and you're 

175
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:50,964
adding in that Eh,
what is anaerobic and aerobic strength 

176
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,830
and cardio and everything else.
You need it all.

177
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,730
And so,
yeah,

178
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:58,830
my first two fights back,
I was coming in heavier,

179
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,950
um,
in men to drop a little bit.

180
00:07:01,951 --> 00:07:03,600
I felt a lot,
lot better.

181
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,550
My conditioning was,
was on point.

182
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,680
I wasn't rushing.
I'd put in the time,

183
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,020
the effort and everything else and get 
my cardio good.

184
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:13,630
My Diet really Rafael's got an awesome 
strength coach.

185
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:17,560
His name is Lucia is tyree.
Now he's my guy named from green strings

186
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,743
and man,
he just got us on this warrior kind of 

187
00:07:19,951 --> 00:07:20,784
lifestyle.
It's not about a program or fight camp 

188
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,260
and you getting ready then it's about,
hey,

189
00:07:25,261 --> 00:07:27,840
let's just live this in day in and day 
out.

190
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,520
Eat the right food,
real food,

191
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,490
put real nutrition in your body.
Real strength,

192
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:33,660
kind of like the honest stuff,
you know,

193
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,950
the kettle bells,
everything else.

194
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,020
And I had never done that before.
So,

195
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:37,854
uh,
this was a real shift in my training 

196
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,600
and,
uh,

197
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,220
it paid off.

198
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,170
So he works with your nutrition as well?
Yeah.

199
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,300
And what kind of changes that he made 
for that

200
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:45,381
man?
Uh,

201
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,880
for me,
I think that,

202
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,830
uh,
it's about maturing too.

203
00:07:48,831 --> 00:07:50,600
I mean,
the five years I took off,

204
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,493
um,
and before that I was 19 fighting 

205
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,040
professionally until I was 23,
24.

206
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,930
Um,
and I was young and dumb.

207
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:58,760
I was tilt with addictions and 
depression,

208
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,030
other stuff.
And Man,

209
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:00,883
I would,
I would tighten everything up during 

210
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:04,310
fight camp,
but before a fight coming up,

211
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,840
I'd eat whatever.
Um,

212
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,060
and this has just been,
you know,

213
00:08:08,061 --> 00:08:11,090
having just tons of salads,
um,

214
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,770
eating meat,
veggies,

215
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,620
fruits,
just fueling your body constantly.

216
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,600
Um,
and so that's just been something really

217
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:18,080
good for me.
I,

218
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,030
I have CELIAC,
so I can't eat the breads,

219
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:21,320
the grains.
Yeah.

220
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:22,280
I can't eat wheat,
barley,

221
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,680
rye,
huge guy to have celiacs.

222
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,520
That's interesting.
And what did they find out when you were

223
00:08:25,521 --> 00:08:26,540
really young?
Uh,

224
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,530
no.
Uh,

225
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,423
I found out,
so I had gone through the opiate 

226
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:34,190
addictions and at six years of that that
I had an ulcer in my stomach.

227
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,540
And so,
uh,

228
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:38,060
but I noticed that during that time,
anytime I would eat wheat,

229
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,960
wheat bread with breakfast,
that I would get a nauseous.

230
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:42,893
I would,
uh,

231
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,023
I would

232
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,060
time.
Yeah.

233
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,020
So did you have it before or did you get
it because of the ulcer?

234
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,273
Um,
I think that probably triggered 

235
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:52,160
something.
Um,

236
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,460
the opiate addiction and everything 
else.

237
00:08:53,461 --> 00:08:56,850
Then when I went to Congo,
it really got bad and I didn't know what

238
00:08:56,851 --> 00:08:58,410
it was.
And then whenever I got back,

239
00:08:58,411 --> 00:09:01,680
I mean having the malaria three times 
didn't gay fever,

240
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,780
blackwater fever,
um,

241
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,390
all sorts of intestinal parasites and 
bacteria is,

242
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,770
um,
when I got back here,

243
00:09:07,771 --> 00:09:08,604
I was just wrecked in.
So my doctor did some tests on me and I 

244
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:10,621
was like,
man,

245
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:11,454
you have,
you weren't just any more gluten 

246
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:14,134
intolerant.
Now you have full blown Celiac and here 

247
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,020
at the top of the chart.
So you used to be gluten intolerant?

248
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,973
Yeah.
And then it became celiac top of the 

249
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,610
charts.
Now do you think anything has connection

250
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:24,444
to,
for people who have never heard of you 

251
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:28,980
before,
you live in the Congo for long stretches

252
00:09:28,981 --> 00:09:32,100
of time working with the pygmies and 
digging wells and you've caught malaria,

253
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:32,934
they're on two separate occasions,
but you've got it three times cause it 

254
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,210
reoccurred on you.

255
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,043
Right.
Do you think that that might have 

256
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:41,880
compromised your immune system and 
contributed to this CELIAC's disease?

257
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,260
Absolutely.
They say about that.

258
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:46,110
My immune system was just shot and so 
that's been,

259
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,450
I mean so the five,
I mean before that,

260
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,340
the drug addictions,
that took a toll on my body.

261
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,440
Then going to the Congo,
having the malaria,

262
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,030
having other things,
it's,

263
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:57,060
it's wrecked my body and so now over the
last three years,

264
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,013
and that's why I am so thankful for a 
guy like Raphael modeling how to live 

265
00:10:00,721 --> 00:10:01,554
this lifestyle just day in and day out.
Lucius there to guide us because I 

266
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:06,864
needed that.
I really needed to rebuild my health 

267
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,840
from the ground up.
Right.

268
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,243
And to stay consistent with that.
It's like when the fights over maybe 

269
00:10:13,651 --> 00:10:16,680
indulge for like one meal but then get 
right back on the grind.

270
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,960
And so it's been,
yeah,

271
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:19,794
really,
really great for me to live it out and 

272
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,140
to really,
I dunno,

273
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,850
just felt like I'm finally healthy 
again.

274
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,820
That's awesome man.
That's amazing.

275
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,663
You just come back after taking five 
years off and essentially not even 

276
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,660
working out at all.
And now,

277
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:31,523
you know,
I mean,

278
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,090
you look good in the first fight,
but man,

279
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,310
your last fight,
you just really look tuned up.

280
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,210
Yeah.
Thank you.

281
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,530
It was awesome.
I appreciate that.

282
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,120
Now when you,
you say that you have celiacs,

283
00:10:40,121 --> 00:10:42,090
so they're,
they're adjusting your diet accordingly.

284
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:42,924
Like what?
Like I'm really big into like fat based 

285
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:48,390
diets these days.
Are you doing something like that or are

286
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,300
you on a different kind of 
carbohydrates?

287
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,150
Like how you,
um,

288
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,930
how are they monitoring it?
I'm definitely getting a lot more,

289
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,823
uh,
a lot more like coconut oils and the 

290
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:58,764
grass fed butters and all of that too,
to have a high fat content with every 

291
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,150
single meal,
breakfast,

292
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:03,711
lunch,
and dinner.

293
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:05,670
I was still dropping weight.
And so that,

294
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,593
I mean this is kind of all new for me 
where it's like me and I'm getting in a 

295
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:11,010
lot of fruits,
veggies,

296
00:11:11,011 --> 00:11:13,980
carbs and mostly fats,
fats and proteins.

297
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,650
Then fruits and vegetables.
And then probably carbs.

298
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,850
Carbs are in fruits and vegetables,
but sort of they plan your meals out for

299
00:11:20,851 --> 00:11:22,200
you.
Do you have like one of those?

300
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,093
I have a meal prep place and a Okc 
provision kitchen and it's pretty 

301
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,110
awesome because they,
um,

302
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,660
they have their own farm.
Everything's organic,

303
00:11:30,661 --> 00:11:33,140
locally grown.
And so yeah,

304
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:35,760
I just go in there and they're able to 
help me out in Luke,

305
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,240
works with them and Lucius helps me know
what I need to tell them to eat.

306
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:41,460
And so it's just for me,
man,

307
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:42,121
I,
I mean,

308
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:43,530
being a heavyweight,
um,

309
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,040
a lot of times we haven't had to take a,
a diet too strict.

310
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,350
And other times I would during fight 
camp,

311
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:50,184
but I would just do what I thought was 
right and what was fueling my body was 

312
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:55,380
feeling and performance for performance.
Yeah.

313
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,910
But now it's just like all around health
and performance.

314
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:59,410
Like,
I need to perform like a machine,

315
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:00,880
like a professional athlete.
I need,

316
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,163
I need to fuel my body like that.
And so having this team of people that 

317
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,374
are around and I think that's why the 
move to Oklahoma City before coming 

318
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:09,790
back,
having the five years off,

319
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,624
then come in and uh,
being a Dallas Fort Worth and trying to 

320
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,930
rush back.
Then moving to Colorado,

321
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:16,900
trying to get the camp there,
train at six or seven different gyms,

322
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,130
you know,
cross train.

323
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,233
Um,
it wasn't really all clicking but now 

324
00:12:20,651 --> 00:12:22,900
being in Oklahoma City,
there's water right there.

325
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,903
There's Raphael's team,
which he has a worldclass guys all 

326
00:12:25,361 --> 00:12:26,194
around him.
He's got the nutritionist and the right 

327
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:28,924
restaurants and places have in place to 
where now I can just focus on training 

328
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,020
and then I get to,
in the meantime their break time,

329
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,850
I get to share the story of why I'm back
to fighting.

330
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,550
That's amazing.
Now this a meal prep place,

331
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,980
do you give them like,
Hey,

332
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,880
I would like my food to be,
you know,

333
00:12:42,881 --> 00:12:46,900
75% this 25% that this is the 
carbohydrate quantity.

334
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:48,790
I'm looking forward.
This is the amount of protein.

335
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,320
So how to calories basically.
And I don't know exactly,

336
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,243
um,
I need to have a better like input into 

337
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,101
it.
But man,

338
00:12:57,101 --> 00:12:59,590
they've just really said this is what he
needs here in fight camp.

339
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,760
And then I was focused on training and 
so it was really good though because I'm

340
00:13:03,761 --> 00:13:04,660
getting,
you know,

341
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,273
a bunch of coconut oil and Avocados and 
everything else all throughout the day 

342
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,080
to make sure I'm having a high fat 
content.

343
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,870
And how many times do you eat in a day?
Three to five,

344
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,550
three big meals.
If,

345
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:16,920
uh,
if I'm not able,

346
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,380
if I'm just swamped and busy,
but then if I have time to make sure I'm

347
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:21,760
feeling about him eating five meals.

348
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,030
So are you working out twice a day or 
like how you two to three times a day?

349
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,670
Five to six days a week?
Yeah.

350
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,573
Wow.
Damn.

351
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,210
So back in the heat of things.
Yeah,

352
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,170
hundred percent Rafael's a machine 
trying to keep up with him,

353
00:13:32,171 --> 00:13:34,170
but feeding off that energy.
Um,

354
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,320
it's been really great.
I mean,

355
00:13:35,321 --> 00:13:36,154
cause it's,
I've been around a lot of guys in the 

356
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,060
sport and uh,
I,

357
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:41,230
I didn't even expect to talk this much 
about him,

358
00:13:41,231 --> 00:13:42,970
but it's uh,
it's been really encouraging.

359
00:13:42,971 --> 00:13:44,440
I've been around Kenny Monday,
Kendall Cross,

360
00:13:44,441 --> 00:13:47,530
Cael Sanderson,
all these Olympic gold medalist and it's

361
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,360
been great cause they were,
my coach is pouring into me.

362
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:52,180
But here's a guy that's the best at his 
craft.

363
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,220
That's Worldclass,
that's world champ.

364
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,360
And he's completely obsessed with every 
aspect of MMA.

365
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,403
And being able to see that and feed off 
of it has been incredibly encouraging 

366
00:14:02,351 --> 00:14:02,590
for me.

367
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,090
So him and I both were like,
hey man,

368
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,310
like the stars are aligning.
This is destiny.

369
00:14:06,311 --> 00:14:07,144
You and me both.
We're going to go get those Bella tore 

370
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:09,550
straps,
world champs.

371
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,890
Let's do that first unless do that 
quick.

372
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,290
What does he weigh?
Many,

373
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,990
he walks around it probably to 10 to 15 
maybe to 20.

374
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,690
And what's he finding a man?
He cuts all the way down to one 85.

375
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,110
So he's the biggest one.
85 were I've ever trained,

376
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,510
was crying and he feels like he's 400 
men.

377
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,373
I mean,
Brendan and I were just talking about 

378
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,630
this yesterday.
Um,

379
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,643
but being under Shane Carwyn and worst 
case scenario where he's having you 

380
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:34,180
mounted,
I mean it just,

381
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,980
Eh,
you hated life,

382
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,450
big Shane on your shore.
Um,

383
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,110
but there's something so,
uh,

384
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,333
demoralizing,
but then at the same time encouraging 

385
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,640
because a raphael is doing that and 
making you feel claustrophobic,

386
00:14:48,641 --> 00:14:51,310
like a 400 pound gorillas on top of you,
um,

387
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,760
or 600 pound whatever.

388
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,240
And then,
but he's also coaching you,

389
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,320
telling you how you can do that to 
somebody else.

390
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,880
And so at the end of it,
you know,

391
00:14:58,881 --> 00:14:59,714
he's,
he's shown you how to do exactly what 

392
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:01,364
he's doing.
So he's a fantastic coach and you don't 

393
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:05,230
always see that from the best athletes.
Um,

394
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:09,770
sometimes they're incredibly talented 
and great at their craft,

395
00:15:09,771 --> 00:15:10,790
but explaining it,
you're like,

396
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:11,624
okay,
now explain it to me again or show me 

397
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,240
how to do it.
Like here I'm showing you like,

398
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,290
just watch,
you know.

399
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,870
But he can,
he can tell you every little detail,

400
00:15:17,871 --> 00:15:18,704
every little inch.

401
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,713
Well,
that's probably has a lot to do with a 

402
00:15:21,281 --> 00:15:23,320
solow who barrow lineage too.
You know,

403
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:26,200
that's very,
very technical school and they're really

404
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,034
involved.
Solid is really involved in the history 

405
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,990
of all the,
the different techniques and you know,

406
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:32,824
where they came from.
And now why did he move to Oklahoma 

407
00:15:34,961 --> 00:15:36,340
City?
Why is he down there?

408
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,930
Uh,
I actually,

409
00:15:37,931 --> 00:15:40,270
that's where he's from.
So I think whenever he was like six,

410
00:15:40,271 --> 00:15:41,140
seven,
eight years old,

411
00:15:41,141 --> 00:15:42,950
he moved from Chicago there.
Um,

412
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,550
I watched a documentary on flow 
grappling.

413
00:15:45,551 --> 00:15:49,150
That's how I even got Ahold of Rafael is
knew I was moving to Oklahoma City.

414
00:15:49,151 --> 00:15:51,370
I'm like,
who's there to train with a moving there

415
00:15:51,371 --> 00:15:52,960
for water for and fight for the 
forgotten.

416
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,173
Um,
and I saw that documentary incredibly 

417
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:56,194
inspirational shows the whole lineage of
whom trained with Sahlu and Shawn g and 

418
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,760
how he went to Brazil to train with 
them,

419
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,830
live with them.
And they came up to Toledo,

420
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:03,820
Ohio.
At first.

421
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,893
He went there and they were living in 
basically like this little apartment 

422
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:10,690
that was freezing inside and the Toledo 
a winters.

423
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,673
And they're having to put their gies 
over the heater to try to warm him up 

424
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:16,060
after every training session to get back
in there and do it again.

425
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:17,223
And that's some of their best training 
matches were in the living room on the 

426
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:22,000
mat that they would throw out there 
right in front of the couch.

427
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,070
And so it was just cool to see how these
guys,

428
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,913
where they were,
where they came from and what they've 

429
00:16:26,891 --> 00:16:28,840
done now.
It's like truly for me,

430
00:16:28,841 --> 00:16:30,310
inspiring cause that's what I want to do
now.

431
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,220
No,
I mean that's the best way to do it,

432
00:16:32,221 --> 00:16:33,054
right.
To just be with the elite of the elite 

433
00:16:35,101 --> 00:16:35,934
and that one particular discipline,
at least resilient Jujitsu and you can 

434
00:16:39,361 --> 00:16:40,194
get so much out of that.
Especially coming from your background 

435
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:42,690
as a wrestler.
You know,

436
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,580
I was super impressed with your arm 
triangle too,

437
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:46,170
man.
Thanks clamped down on that.

438
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,520
A head and arm choke.
That was nice.

439
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,590
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.

440
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,463
No,
I think it's a great style because I'm 

441
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:52,604
coming in with a wrestling background of
when a couple national championships 

442
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:58,130
there and then to come in with Raphael 
once I put a guy down,

443
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,993
now I need to finish them.
And it surprised me Lovato was a 

444
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,940
wrestling cause he's actually got some 
good stuff that he does,

445
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,940
but now I'm gonna be able to show him 
that and he showed me his world and then

446
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,620
we're growing together as boxing.

447
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,900
That's so good,
dude.

448
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:11,734
That's so good.
It's so interesting too because there's 

449
00:17:12,611 --> 00:17:16,480
very few real submission artists today 
in the heavyweight division,

450
00:17:16,481 --> 00:17:18,130
you know,
it used to be fade or when he was in his

451
00:17:18,131 --> 00:17:19,930
prime was submission artists.
Of course.

452
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:21,970
No,
was the premiere submission artists,

453
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:24,580
Frank Mir,
one of the all time greats for sure.

454
00:17:24,581 --> 00:17:26,950
And in terms of his accomplishments as a
submission artist,

455
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,320
but there's not a whole lot of that 
today.

456
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,060
You know,
you see knockouts and stuff,

457
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:31,923
especially in the UFC,
you don't see a whole lot of 

458
00:17:33,461 --> 00:17:34,510
submissions.
Right.

459
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:35,930
Except for doom,
you know,

460
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:38,680
if we're doing can still submit people 
and won the title off of cane that way.

461
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,440
Yeah.
So,

462
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,283
so I'm,
I'm excited because statistically I 

463
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:45,160
think in my fights,
if I've put it on the ground,

464
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,150
I've already finished it.
But now having that guy with me coaching

465
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,573
through,
um,

466
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,620
I heard them in the fight during the 
fight,

467
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,454
I'm doing this,
I'm doing that and he's just telling me 

468
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:57,150
these little adjustments to me right 
next to you while you were,

469
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,193
he was across the cage where he's,
he's a good coach and I had the whole 

470
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:03,240
camp to sit there and listen to him 
while he was off to the side.

471
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,520
He's yelling at me.
[inaudible] yeah,

472
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,930
Nice.
Trying to do that.

473
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:09,990
And we used to do that at grudge 
training center in Colorado.

474
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:10,830
We would,
uh,

475
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,960
turn up the music,
we'd blast it,

476
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,550
uh,
during sparring.

477
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,533
And then we have our cornerman the off 
to the side and they're hollering and 

478
00:18:18,091 --> 00:18:18,924
yelling that we were able to start 
trying to pick their voices out with 

479
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:23,130
like a distraction with loud music going
on,

480
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,300
just like in the fight.

481
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,480
So that way if there's a huge crowd all 
yelling out different stuff,

482
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:31,110
you're able to tune into the voices you 
need to hear who's idea was that?

483
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,150
Trevor's yeah,
Trevor's Trevor Whitman.

484
00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:34,050
Yeah,
he's smart.

485
00:18:34,051 --> 00:18:35,220
Very smart,
very smart.

486
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,443
Now how are you balancing out your full 
time training now that you're moving up 

487
00:18:40,111 --> 00:18:43,120
in the rankings and Bella Tor and you 
know you are,

488
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:43,954
you're being more and more successful,
but you're also doing this for a cause 

489
00:18:47,101 --> 00:18:52,101
and for people don't know you are doing 
this for your pygmy family,

490
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:53,454
these people that you've sort of become 
a part of their world and you've lived 

491
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,900
there for many,
many months at a time and you,

492
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,753
you go back and forth to help build 
water wells with a water four and your 

493
00:19:04,531 --> 00:19:05,364
organization fight for the forgotten and
how are you balancing that out with 

494
00:19:08,851 --> 00:19:09,684
being a professional fighter and trying 
to compete and perform at your very 

495
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,214
best?

496
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:14,601
Yeah,
that,

497
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:16,740
that's been a learning process without a
doubt.

498
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:17,574
But now it's trying to find ways to set 
the right boundaries and in a way to 

499
00:19:21,571 --> 00:19:22,404
protect my training schedule.
At first I was just saying yes to 

500
00:19:25,171 --> 00:19:27,150
basically everything.
Um,

501
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,550
and that made it really tough for my 
first two fights back,

502
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:30,960
uh,
where I felt rushed.

503
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:31,794
I didn't feel like the muscle memory was
clicking in between every training 

504
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:34,944
session or I'd be late to training 
sessions doing the interview or trying 

505
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:37,734
to talk to somebody or trying to tell 
people the story or I would have to 

506
00:19:40,621 --> 00:19:42,480
leave early to go do it.
Now it's like,

507
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,000
it's been really great to move to 
Oklahoma City,

508
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:47,340
have water for there to protect my 
training schedule.

509
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,840
And training comes first because if I 
can keep going up in the ranks,

510
00:19:51,841 --> 00:19:54,720
if I can get a world championship under 
my belt or a few,

511
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,823
you know,
I'll have a bigger platform to stand on 

512
00:19:56,851 --> 00:19:57,950
to tell,
you know,

513
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,793
have the bigger microphone,
bigger platform to be able to continue 

514
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:01,410
to tell this story.

515
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,780
And so yeah,
we have a team about 10,

516
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:06,630
12 people at water four,
they've all rallied around it.

517
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,250
They're trying to take stuff off my 
plate,

518
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:11,820
um,
and be able to help fill in my schedule,

519
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:14,040
but making sure I'm getting enough time 
to get in the training,

520
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,250
get in the rest and man,
just eight,

521
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:19,950
nine weeks of that before this last 
fight,

522
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,420
it,
it truly paid off.

523
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:22,254
It felt like there was a whole team 
around making sure that going into this 

524
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:28,350
fight everything was exactly the way it 
should be.

525
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:29,640
And that's how I felt too.
I mean,

526
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:30,474
uh,
I have a little highlight clip with a 

527
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:32,740
fight,
but I mean the,

528
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,070
the crowd was just,
uh,

529
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,443
eh,
it was overwhelming and incredibly good 

530
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,680
way where it like felt I could feel the 
energy.

531
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,530
I could hear everybody there.
I grown up in Dallas,

532
00:20:43,531 --> 00:20:44,364
fort worth water for and fight for the 
forgotten is based and Lovato's is out 

533
00:20:48,191 --> 00:20:49,650
of Oklahoma City.
Um,

534
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,733
and everyone met up in the middle on the
border at this big casino called 

535
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,243
Windstar and it was just awesome going 
in there and having everyone rally 

536
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:58,900
around.
I don't feel like me,

537
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,763
I mean me too,
but rally round fight for the forgotten 

538
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:02,530
what I'm fighting for.

539
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,040
Yeah.
And then the post fight interview.

540
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,530
I mean that's,
that's what I'm living for now.

541
00:21:08,531 --> 00:21:10,180
That's what I'm fighting for,
so I can talk.

542
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,900
And how supportive has belt or been 
about all this?

543
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:14,290
Oh Man.
Incredibly supportive.

544
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,360
It's blown me away.
I mean,

545
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:19,210
I get to,
I get to talk about it and everything.

546
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,010
So it's been,
it's been awesome.

547
00:21:21,011 --> 00:21:24,400
There's Raphael up at top left big Josh 
Copeland to the right.

548
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,320
Um,
and yeah,

549
00:21:26,321 --> 00:21:28,870
I get to put fight for the forgotten all
over my stuff.

550
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,060
No,
I've had that.

551
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,010
I've had that.
But uh,

552
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,320
yeah,
it's been really great.

553
00:21:35,321 --> 00:21:36,580
Yeah.
Added anything to it.

554
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,930
Um,
Dell,

555
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:41,290
I had the cross in net.
I did add the vikings below it,

556
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:42,124
but here I had gotten a lateral job 
before and then I was able to hit a 

557
00:21:45,851 --> 00:21:48,810
belly to back thinks.
Ooh.

558
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:50,500
I like how you call it Sioux play.
Yeah.

559
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,940
And there's the arms.
Nice.

560
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,850
So now where do they have you in the 
rankings?

561
00:21:57,851 --> 00:21:59,110
And I mean,
they're,

562
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,330
they're heavyweight division is in the 
deepest in the world,

563
00:22:01,331 --> 00:22:01,840
right?
Who's there?

564
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,700
Heavyweight champion.
Uh,

565
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:04,421
well,
that,

566
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:07,480
that was Vitaly Medecav.
But he's been kind of,

567
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,280
you know,
in a struggle with,

568
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,430
yeah.
Been inactive.

569
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:12,130
Here's the part that I,
I really like.

570
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,090
I don't know if we can turn on,

571
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,020
you were kinda getting your feet 
underneath you,

572
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:19,680
remembering how it went in all seem to 
come together tonight.

573
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:21,160
Is that how it felt?
Yeah,

574
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,530
I definitely,
I got,

575
00:22:22,531 --> 00:22:25,680
I got a lot of room to improve,
a lot of work to do,

576
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:28,110
but yes,
it felt like the muscle memory was back.

577
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,963
I'm in that camp that is so great for my
style with Rafael Lovato junior and the 

578
00:22:32,911 --> 00:22:35,280
team big Josh Copeland.
And you're so blessed,

579
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,740
encouraged,
excited to be here.

580
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,300
The little dance I was doing in here.
Hope they didn't look cocky or arrogant.

581
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:43,710
That was my dance.
But we do out in the forest.

582
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,180
I just love them to be able to come in 
here and fight through.

583
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,200
Most people are lucky enough to have one
tribe.

584
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,034
You have to not only a family Congo,
apparently here they were very much 

585
00:22:53,851 --> 00:22:54,684
behind you.
How did it feel to win in front of them 

586
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,150
from water for Oklahoma City Eco 
Survivor?

587
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,580
I'm just slow.
Uh,

588
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,453
lucky.
So fortunate jumped behind this because 

589
00:23:11,301 --> 00:23:14,120
I love to fight.
I love to be here and compete,

590
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:18,110
but it's even better to fight for people
and so to know that fighting in here,

591
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,740
getting a choke out,
I'm going to go into Congo and knock out

592
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,120
the world's water crisis.
Moving forward.

593
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,480
You said you have a lot of room to grow,
but with performances like that,

594
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,270
people are thinking about you in a wide 
open heavyweight division.

595
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:32,480
What's next for you?
Well,

596
00:23:32,481 --> 00:23:35,780
I'm coming for that balance.
It's going to come and just might take a

597
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,750
little bit of time to get there.
I'm still getting my feet under me.

598
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:42,650
I had five years,
two months where I did zero training and

599
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:46,070
so I'm excited to get back in there.
Keep my way up.

600
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,230
I got to earn it.
But I have,

601
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,700
I think more of a reason,
a purpose of passion to be in here.

602
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,040
And so I'm just so thankful for everyone
that's got behind us.

603
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,113
Eco Survivor right here is donating 50% 
of their profits of their entire brand 

604
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,460
to come to the water wells in the Congo 
for water,

605
00:24:03,461 --> 00:24:04,670
for her fight,
for the forgotten.

606
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,030
Thank you guys for getting behind us.
Before you go.

607
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:08,864
You owe soccer pygmy family.
Would he have to say to them to pick a 

608
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:16,300
hot pin on the Gulama Goo not Kupenda 
sign.

609
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:20,720
Now want him to sign a Santi sign a 
Doobie Django?

610
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,083
Man,
I just,

611
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:25,370
I love him so much.
I was saying I'm in here.

612
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm in here because I love you.
That's what I'm in here.

613
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,890
I'm gonna Google the Google.
We are one.

614
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,280
We are not different and so a sequel 
meaningi it's been many,

615
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:37,124
many days.
I can't wait to come back and see you 

616
00:24:39,261 --> 00:24:41,570
guys very,
very soon and drill some more.

617
00:24:41,571 --> 00:24:44,080
Well,
so the big pig meat,

618
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:49,770
that's a crazy platform man.
To be able to do that on tv like that in

619
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:50,604
front of,
I mean who knows how many millions of 

620
00:24:51,361 --> 00:24:52,194
people watch too.
I think that came to the 1.1 or 1.2 is 

621
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:59,250
the headline.
That was a Marlos,

622
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,470
Conan and Julia Bud for that,
uh,

623
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:04,020
inaugural featherweight,
I believe,

624
00:25:04,021 --> 00:25:04,854
or a world title.
Do you feel like Bella towards getting 

625
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:07,790
more respect now?
Like it's,

626
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,750
uh,
it's becoming more of a,

627
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:13,320
like for a while it was looked at as 
sort of a,

628
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,700
an also ran,
you know,

629
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:18,150
but I think like now with the lineups 
getting stronger and stronger,

630
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:18,984
it seems like,
uh,

631
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,870
the organization is growing and 
notoriety.

632
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:22,980
Yeah,
I believe so.

633
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,891
And um,
I mean,

634
00:25:23,891 --> 00:25:26,100
I think it's healthy.
It's very important.

635
00:25:26,101 --> 00:25:27,870
I think it's good for everybody.
Yeah,

636
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,740
exactly.
And,

637
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:30,210
and,
and great for the fighters.

638
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,100
My bosses,
my disagree right.

639
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,200
At the UFC,
but I really think I actually,

640
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:35,970
I don't think they would.
I think they'd probably agree.

641
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,070
I think it's important.
It's important to have competition.

642
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,360
It's good.
It's good for everybody.

643
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,410
Yeah,
absolutely.

644
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,071
And so,
yeah,

645
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:42,910
I think Bader just came over.
Yup.

646
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,540
Um,
Phil Davis,

647
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,070
Davis is the,
is the light heavyweight champion now.

648
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:47,821
Yep,
absolutely.

649
00:25:47,821 --> 00:25:49,620
So you don't really have a heavyweight 
champion?

650
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:50,454
Is that what's going on?
Are they stripped fatale Melnikov of it 

651
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:52,854
because he's fighting over his contract.
Allowed them to fight and fight nights 

652
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:58,200
or efn over in Russia.
I went over there,

653
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,600
Corner Josh against fatale.
Um,

654
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,140
and so he just hasn't come back and he 
just has,

655
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,140
I think he's making money in Russia and 
fighting there and,

656
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:07,591
uh,
they're,

657
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:10,440
they're kind of been in a standoff and 
he can come back and fight,

658
00:26:10,441 --> 00:26:11,730
but he's been stripped of his belt.

659
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,030
Um,
and now I think they're,

660
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,300
you know,
Scott's a smart guy,

661
00:26:15,301 --> 00:26:16,610
so it was rich.
Um,

662
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,080
they're putting something together for 
the heavyweights and uh,

663
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,600
yeah,
the fade or Matt Mitrione fight,

664
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:23,430
that's going to be exciting to watch for
a title though,

665
00:26:23,431 --> 00:26:25,830
right?
But is that a three rounder?

666
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:27,450
Yes.
Three,

667
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,313
three fives.
So when are they gonna try to have a 

668
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:32,280
heavyweight title?
I think it's coming up pretty soon,

669
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:34,050
so I think probably in the next six 
months.

670
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:34,530
Where,
I mean,

671
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:35,363
within that next three months now 
looking at yourself and your own 

672
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:38,634
development and growth,
how far away do you feel like you are 

673
00:26:40,741 --> 00:26:43,060
from that fighting for that?
Me,

674
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:43,890
I,
I,

675
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:46,200
I,
I want it now.

676
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,090
I want to take that now,
but,

677
00:26:48,091 --> 00:26:50,250
uh,
I think that realistically being smart,

678
00:26:50,251 --> 00:26:51,084
strategic,
get another couple of wins under my 

679
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,064
belt,
some good wins or I get to go in there 

680
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:56,310
and,
and really show to myself,

681
00:26:56,311 --> 00:27:00,470
to Bella torn one,
I need to earn it and to um,

682
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,420
I need to get a couple more real 
impressive wins under my belt.

683
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,590
Um,
and yeah,

684
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:08,340
I think,
I think I know who I am as a fighter and

685
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:09,174
I can hang with those guys.
It's just I need to to build back cause 

686
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,260
it's,
it was a long time off.

687
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,623
Yeah.
It was a long time off and then train 

688
00:27:16,621 --> 00:27:17,460
week.
Great guys.

689
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:18,323
I think in the next two or three fights 
I'll really start taking big steps up 

690
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,340
and then,
um,

691
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,720
after that,
maybe in the next two,

692
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:27,150
three years I'll have that belt.
Yeah.

693
00:27:27,151 --> 00:27:28,040
They have,
uh,

694
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,410
their division is interesting.
Now rampage is going to heavyweight too,

695
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,430
right?
Yeah,

696
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,211
I think,
uh,

697
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:35,160
I think it's a catch weight against King
Mo.

698
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,083
Um,
I think that might be this next Friday 

699
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,080
or Saturday.
So yeah,

700
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,450
they're fighting in Chicago.
Yeah.

701
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,830
I've been reading shit.
Talking online.

702
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,773
Yeah.
Yeah.

703
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,310
They keep going back and forth with the 
chemo,

704
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:51,870
keeps trying to fat Shayma a rampage and
he's coming back.

705
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,730
So I love that expression.
It's so silly.

706
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,653
And one of his fighters fat shaming when
they're about to beat the fuck out of 

707
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:00,510
each other.
So these lanterns you've brought me,

708
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:01,470
first of all,
thank you.

709
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,530
Second of all,
what is the deal with these bad boys?

710
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,500
So this is the first product that they 
had developed.

711
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,210
Um,
and it's ECO survivor.

712
00:28:09,211 --> 00:28:11,460
They're also out of Oklahoma City.
So this is the common of,

713
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:14,820
is donating 50% of their money,
their profits to waterfall.

714
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,410
Absolutely.
And so all the packaging,

715
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:18,720
this is old packaging,
but know the water.

716
00:28:18,721 --> 00:28:22,110
Four is the company that's building 
these wells in the Congo for the pygmies

717
00:28:22,111 --> 00:28:24,450
and is the organization that you work 
closely with.

718
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,883
And so they started eco survivor so that
it could be basically an empowerment 

719
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,960
mechanism on all the,
all the packaging.

720
00:28:30,961 --> 00:28:33,780
It's going to have a picture of me,
a picture of the wells,

721
00:28:33,781 --> 00:28:34,830
a picture of the pygmies.

722
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,780
Um,
and we're going to tell the story.

723
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:41,781
And when they go to eco survivor.com,
which I think just launched looks great.

724
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,900
You would almost think it's a nonprofit 
website because they're highlighting the

725
00:28:45,901 --> 00:28:46,734
cause so much.
But they were talking about how we make 

726
00:28:49,021 --> 00:28:49,854
it sustainable there,
empower them with sustainable business 

727
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:52,831
and they're like,
hey,

728
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:54,630
we want to,
we want to do that here.

729
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,340
They were already very successful 
company,

730
00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:01,250
the parent company's Jesco Products 
Company and they make a,

731
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,153
they do licensing things,
lights and all sorts of things for 

732
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,960
general electric and a energizer and 
Philips.

733
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,840
I mean they have 3000 products on the 
market,

734
00:29:09,841 --> 00:29:11,130
so they are incredible.
Um,

735
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,050
yeah,
so there's,

736
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,380
would you drink dirty water?
Neilia a billion people have no choice.

737
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,300
This is a,
this is great man.

738
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,370
Oops.
I just turned it on accidentally.

739
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,320
And so they're,
they're rugged.

740
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,000
They are.
Um,

741
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:24,990
I mean I,
I've,

742
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:29,960
I've done impact testing where I'm 
jumping up and down on top of these now.

743
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:31,741
Yeah.
There you go.

744
00:29:31,741 --> 00:29:32,730
Put it down,
stand on it.

745
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,280
You'll be fine.
I mean my,

746
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:39,990
my heavyweight but gets on top of it and
jumps around and to this incredible,

747
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,230
right.
So,

748
00:29:41,231 --> 00:29:43,950
I mean our team is using this in the 
Congo.

749
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,400
There you go.
Look at that balance.

750
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
You are what's at the Scorpion?
I don't know what it is.

751
00:29:49,001 --> 00:29:49,840
I don't know.
Pay Attention.

752
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,650
I just do what they tell me to do.
That's amazing man.

753
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,110
That's crazy.
You could stand on this thing.

754
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,973
I've done that with,
I won't name any names of the 

755
00:29:58,631 --> 00:29:59,464
competitors,
but whenever I start to stand on the 

756
00:30:00,761 --> 00:30:04,300
other ones,
the bulbs crush and break and uh,

757
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,340
yeah.
So this right here though,

758
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,383
it's got karabiners.
Our guys were using this to one 30 in 

759
00:30:09,011 --> 00:30:10,300
the morning,
maybe a week ago.

760
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,390
They put it up on the tripods,
um,

761
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,260
and then they're able to just go to 
work.

762
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,150
Uh,
so it's really great.

763
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:19,000
That was the glass made out of,
how's the of the glass supporting me?

764
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,250
That part actually.
So I don't,

765
00:30:21,251 --> 00:30:23,380
I do know this,
that a dome structure,

766
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,480
uh,
is the strongest thing out there.

767
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,890
It's plastic.
Yeah,

768
00:30:26,891 --> 00:30:28,060
it is.
It is a plastic,

769
00:30:28,061 --> 00:30:30,400
which is a super strong plot,
super strong plastic.

770
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:35,401
It's led light and it's got a 360 degree
Omni directional lighting,

771
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,084
which basically just means it goes all 
around and there's no blind spots with 

772
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:42,040
the light for the most part.
And then on it's killer man.

773
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,840
Yeah.
And then so from there we're going to do

774
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,580
flashlights,
headlamps,

775
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,833
a Bluetooth Speakers,
bluetooth speakers that have battery 

776
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:52,840
packs in them than just battery packs.
Then we're doing walkie talkies,

777
00:30:52,841 --> 00:30:54,820
walkie talkies that have battery packs 
in them.

778
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,410
No Shit.
Yeah.

779
00:30:56,411 --> 00:30:57,244
And so we're doing it to where I,
the everyday adventure can be part of 

780
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:01,000
it.

781
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,830
Um,
but,

782
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,693
but we're doing it so that way this 
stuff's going to last for a team in the 

783
00:31:06,011 --> 00:31:08,350
Congo.
And then when people are buying it here,

784
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,393
they know that 50% of their purchase or 
the profits from the purchase are going 

785
00:31:12,641 --> 00:31:14,200
straight to the cause.
That's awesome,

786
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,640
man.
Yeah man.

787
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:18,250
I've heard of companies doing,
you know,

788
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:23,280
I love it when a company gives 1% 2% 5% 
10% but I never heard of a company.

789
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:24,490
I mean they're,
they're,

790
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:27,710
they're running this better than a lot 
of nonprofits are.

791
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,850
Percent of the profits away.
No,

792
00:31:30,851 --> 00:31:33,610
that's insane.
That's incredibly generous.

793
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,400
That's awesome man.
One more time.

794
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:39,760
The company's called ECO survivor.
And what does their website,

795
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,520
Eco survivor.com and it's Kinda cool 
Jamie,

796
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,290
if you can pull that up.
Uh,

797
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:48,310
even if you scroll down you,
so two days ago was world water day.

798
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,720
Oh yeah.
And right on their makeup,

799
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,490
make a donation,
goes right to our page,

800
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,150
make a purchase.

801
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,180
You can buy the lanterns right now.
We have a lot more coming out soon.

802
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,043
So right now it's just the lanterns 
headlamps coming out because I use 

803
00:31:59,351 --> 00:31:59,921
those.
Yeah.

804
00:31:59,921 --> 00:32:03,970
Hopefully I'll get you some.
I want to thank you so much.

805
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,133
Um,
and then it shows where her in the next 

806
00:32:06,741 --> 00:32:08,250
three years and being built.
Yeah.

807
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:08,980
Wow,
that's so cool.

808
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:11,440
And then down a little bit shows the 
statistics.

809
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,570
Um,
and it just shows,

810
00:32:13,571 --> 00:32:15,310
I mean,
the average water walk for instance,

811
00:32:15,311 --> 00:32:19,990
is 3.75 miles round trip for a woman to 
just go collect.

812
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:24,040
Oftentimes dirty most of the times,
dirty water and heavy,

813
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,510
heavy,
44 pounds.

814
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:27,640
It's a 20 liters,
five gallons.

815
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,400
Most people have no idea how hard it is 
to carry 40 pounds.

816
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,270
I well think about one of those 
kettlebells,

817
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,130
right?
Yeah.

818
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:33,963
And then,
uh,

819
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,893
and then a lot of times the women,
the women do two at a time and the 

820
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:37,924
children do one.

821
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:41,670
And so these little can't go to school 
cause they and that water walk,

822
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:43,190
but they are not doing that one time a 
day.

823
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,050
They're doing it two and three times a 
day because they're,

824
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:48,140
their household needs more than just 
five gallons of water.

825
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,180
And so a lot of times the girls can't be
sent to school or the kids can't read.

826
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,620
They have to pick one of the kids that 
can go to school.

827
00:32:54,621 --> 00:32:56,690
So the other ones can go collect water 
all day.

828
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:59,630
I think it's over a billion days each 
year,

829
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,883
um,
workdays that are lost just because of 

830
00:33:02,571 --> 00:33:06,020
the women that have to go do the water 
walks over a billion workdays.

831
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,360
And there you,
you,

832
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,240
and if people have never seen any of the
episodes that Justin was on before,

833
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:14,720
please watch the last ones a,
if you get a chance,

834
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,190
it'll,
you'll catch up more.

835
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:17,024
To what you've gone through,
what some of these people have gone 

836
00:33:19,071 --> 00:33:19,904
through,
the kind of parasites these people get 

837
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:21,734
from this water and how important it 
says for you and how much growth and 

838
00:33:24,861 --> 00:33:28,340
progress has been over the past few 
years of your efforts down there.

839
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,260
Yeah.
Well thank you so much.

840
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:31,280
It's,
it's been incredible.

841
00:33:31,281 --> 00:33:32,510
I,
emily was telling me,

842
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:33,344
uh,
my wife,

843
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,360
uh,
coming here that wow,

844
00:33:35,361 --> 00:33:36,194
this was over four years ago when you 
were on Joe show the first time and we 

845
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,050
hadn't drilled one single well,
that's crazy.

846
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,240
I had just been there.
Um,

847
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:46,910
Andy Bo had happened,
the one and a half year old boy that had

848
00:33:46,911 --> 00:33:50,630
passed away.
I held his lifeless body and buried them

849
00:33:50,631 --> 00:33:53,000
and just did a,
it ripped me open,

850
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,853
you know,
tore my heart apart like you would 

851
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:55,874
anyone like it would anyone.
But it was just a rude awakening to the 

852
00:33:59,661 --> 00:34:04,661
water crisis that,
that there's 800 kids every day die just

853
00:34:04,821 --> 00:34:08,690
because of diarrhea,
just like literally die from diarrhea.

854
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,640
And then 2000,
350,

855
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,433
2000,
350 die of the malnutrition that 

856
00:34:14,091 --> 00:34:14,924
diarrhea causes.
So if you're in an area that doesn't 

857
00:34:17,091 --> 00:34:17,924
have access to clean water,
there's probably not an abundance of 

858
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:20,774
food around you.

859
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,793
But even the food that you do get,
you're eating it and it goes right 

860
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:27,860
through you because you have diarrhea,
you don't absorb any of the nutrients.

861
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:30,410
And so that's over 3000 just because of 
that.

862
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,470
And then that's not counting a lot of 
the sicknesses and everything else,

863
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,400
typhoid,
Nikolai.

864
00:34:34,401 --> 00:34:39,260
And so that's 1.5 million deaths a year 
of children under the age of five,

865
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,080
1.5 million.
All of them are preventable.

866
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:46,220
And so like I truly believe man,
like we have,

867
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,900
we've found something really special at 
water four and others,

868
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:54,470
other organizations that I'm sure are 
doing it in different spaces.

869
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:57,650
But I feel like us,
we are doing it in a way that we put the

870
00:34:57,651 --> 00:34:59,750
tools in the hands of the people that 
need it the most.

871
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:03,590
The people in the community,
I mean our teams,

872
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:06,290
18 people and we've first year that I 
was there.

873
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:09,200
So in the last five years,
I've lived there for about two years,

874
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,780
back and forth,
one once,

875
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:11,743
one year at one time.
But then Ida was able to help drill and 

876
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:19,040
train them for the first 13 wells.
The year I was stepping back,

877
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:19,821
I was nervous,
you know,

878
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:22,130
I'm not going to be there.
I can't micromanage.

879
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:23,200
These guys are,
I can't watch him.

880
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:24,980
Mccain encourage them,
you know,

881
00:35:24,981 --> 00:35:26,390
uh,
I don't want to micromanage anyone,

882
00:35:26,391 --> 00:35:31,391
but I can't be there to do the work.
But then they're able to do 20 wells the

883
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,750
year without me.
The next year.

884
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:36,050
The last year they did 29 so we're up to
I think 62 wells,

885
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,113
um,
that they've drilled for themselves and 

886
00:35:38,341 --> 00:35:40,080
their own community.
And that's,

887
00:35:40,081 --> 00:35:40,914
our guys have 18 but water four has 375 
and they drilled 690 water wells last 

888
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,280
year alone.
Wow.

889
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,040
And that served.
So those are 375 people in the continent

890
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:52,860
of Africa that live in 16 African 
nations.

891
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,780
And they were able to give 172,000 
people clean water for the first time in

892
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:59,460
their lives.
And so,

893
00:35:59,461 --> 00:36:00,630
um,
man,

894
00:36:00,631 --> 00:36:01,464
we can,
we can knock this water crisis out in 

895
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:06,120
our lifetime if that's what we do,
if we give them the solution.

896
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,580
That's incredible.
That's,

897
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:10,410
that's amazing progress.
And just a few years,

898
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,670
yeah,
it's been a,

899
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:13,583
it's blown me away,
but so talk to me about how belt or is 

900
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:17,190
helping and how they're getting behind 
this.

901
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,380
Well,
that's what really sold me with,

902
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,543
I mean,
I had offers from most places when I 

903
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:23,160
was,
when I came back and,

904
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,600
uh,
but,

905
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,200
but when I sat down with Scott and,
um,

906
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,830
and I was writing the book,
uh,

907
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,773
with Loretta and went out to eat with 
them in Santa Monica and he was just 

908
00:36:34,561 --> 00:36:35,220
like,
hey,

909
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,740
like we want to give you a chance to 
really tell your story.

910
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,910
Like you need to fight.

911
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,830
You got to prove it.
Like you have to have that,

912
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,020
that hard work and skill and talent 
behind you.

913
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,900
You have to be able to perform.
But if you can do that,

914
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,860
we're going to rally around you.
Um,

915
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,850
they want to rally around their fighters
that,

916
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,080
that,
that put in the time,

917
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:54,150
the effort that they can produce 
results.

918
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:55,520
But,
um,

919
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:56,543
it was really encouraging to hear that.
And then I was bummed out the first two 

920
00:36:58,651 --> 00:36:59,131
fights.
I mean,

921
00:36:59,131 --> 00:36:59,964
I won,
but I didn't win decisively like I 

922
00:37:01,321 --> 00:37:02,154
wanted to.
So to get this last fight underneath me 

923
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,590
where really performed well,
um,

924
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:10,680
and,
and was pretty dominant like a,

925
00:37:10,681 --> 00:37:12,930
I think they know that I can fight and 
uh,

926
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:14,123
and I know I can fight.
And so now we can do this in a way that 

927
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,110
man,
when I win,

928
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,200
literally wells are being drilled every 
single time.

929
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:26,550
And so eco survivor is helping me drill 
several wells after this last one.

930
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,960
That's a chronicle.
Yeah.

931
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:30,870
Now how do you balance out your training
when you're,

932
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,270
when you're visiting the Congo and 
staying there?

933
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,190
Yeah,
so a tough thing is,

934
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,233
so I kind of shared a little bit of our 
model and how we give the tools for the 

935
00:37:38,911 --> 00:37:39,890
people,
um,

936
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:44,160
in the community.
So my travel schedule,

937
00:37:44,161 --> 00:37:45,870
it's uh,
it's been a hard pill to swallow,

938
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:46,704
but I think it's the most strategic 
thing where I'm only going to go once a 

939
00:37:48,781 --> 00:37:49,820
year now.
Um,

940
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:53,370
I'm going to go once a year because I 
need to be here training.

941
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,960
Um,
that's my,

942
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:56,123
uh,
at first I thought I was the one that 

943
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,840
that made this thing go.
But really it's,

944
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,650
it's,
it's our guys in the field,

945
00:38:01,651 --> 00:38:04,670
they're the engine and I was maybe the 
spark plug that,

946
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:05,543
that,
that kind of started up something and 

947
00:38:06,931 --> 00:38:10,180
now I get to go back and be the 
encourager or to fuel and back up.

948
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,273
Um,
but they're the ones doing the work and 

949
00:38:13,261 --> 00:38:16,590
so I'm only going to go once a year.
I'll probably fight in June or July.

950
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,603
I was talking with Bella tour and then 
right after that we're starting up a 

951
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:23,610
soap production facility in Congo with 
our guys is going to start another eight

952
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:27,120
to 10 jobs because we go in and we teach
the wash program.

953
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,890
So we need,
uh,

954
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,413
we need them to start making soap for 
themselves because right now the only 

955
00:38:33,301 --> 00:38:34,134
thing I've ever seen available is car 
washing soap that's packed full of 

956
00:38:37,121 --> 00:38:37,954
chemicals from China or India and they 
have all the Ross themselves with 

957
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:43,420
carwash.
I did while I was there for the year and

958
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:46,240
my skin would be raw afterwards cause 
there was nothing else available.

959
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,330
I mean I took soap with me,
but when I was there for a full year,

960
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,340
I mean it only lasted for the first 
month maybe.

961
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,770
So the rest of the time I was using this
car washing soap,

962
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:54,604
that man,
it,

963
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,380
it,
it's rough on your body.

964
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,790
And so we are partnering with a company 
called Pasha soap there at all the whole

965
00:39:00,791 --> 00:39:03,340
foods and they have a sister company,
uh,

966
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,060
a Mozzie there at target.
And though those guys go around and they

967
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:07,894
start up,
so production facilities in the 

968
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:12,370
developing nation to give jobs.
So is it possible that that could become

969
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:13,204
an industry for the people in the Congo 
where they can start selling their soul 

970
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,270
and then,
you know,

971
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,090
maybe eco survivor could sell it on 
their website as well?

972
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:19,953
Yeah,
absolutely.

973
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,050
Or start up a new,
yeah,

974
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,200
that other company.
Yeah.

975
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,240
Pocho which has been great to us.
They actually,

976
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:26,453
uh,
kind of cool story that the founder of 

977
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,164
[inaudible] was listening to this 
podcast whenever he had the dreams to 

978
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:33,034
start it up.

979
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:34,960
And he was actually being like kind of 
a,

980
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,960
I think it was a janitor at night 
through the night shift.

981
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,823
And he was listening to this and he had 
the dreams to start up Pocho he helped 

982
00:39:41,171 --> 00:39:44,680
us get our five o one c three with a 
fight for the forgotten holy shit.

983
00:39:44,681 --> 00:39:46,720
So after my first time being on the 
show,

984
00:39:46,721 --> 00:39:49,870
he reached out to me and he had just 
started up Pasha.

985
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,600
And so he helped me get fight for the 
forgotten started up.

986
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:54,410
His name's Andrew Verbus.
Wow.

987
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,280
Incredible guy.
But the inspiration you got from here to

988
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:58,690
do something,
make a difference.

989
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,120
Now he's in all the whole foods.
He's about to be in target.

990
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,970
Um,
and he's coming with me this next trip.

991
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,223
We're actually,
he might not come because we don't 

992
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:09,340
really take volunteers now.
We just empower the locals.

993
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:10,503
But we're going to start up that soap 
production facility and it's going to 

994
00:40:12,061 --> 00:40:16,060
start eight to 10 new jobs will go into 
schools and t because last year our team

995
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:18,850
spent 301 days teaching the wash 
program.

996
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,520
So teaching water and sanitation and 
hygiene,

997
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:22,354
helping them dig latrines,
helping them know the importance of 

998
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,370
clean hands.
So we set up,

999
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,010
set up outside the latrines,
a hand washing station,

1000
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,850
which is called a tippy tap.
So they have a clean jug of water,

1001
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,713
they have a bar soap,
they step on a stick in a rope and it 

1002
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,540
tilts this jug over and they're able to 
wash their hands right there.

1003
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,480
But then they only had that car washing 
soap.

1004
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:46,150
So now we're going to meet another need,
start up the soap production.

1005
00:40:46,151 --> 00:40:48,220
They have the eucalyptus trees there,
the palm oil,

1006
00:40:48,221 --> 00:40:49,540
the Avocados.
I mean,

1007
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:51,970
just whatever we need with lemon grass,
um,

1008
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:54,700
whatever we need to make the soap with.
Which that's not my specialty,

1009
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,320
but I know all the raw materials are 
there.

1010
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,400
What does this company,
again,

1011
00:40:57,401 --> 00:40:58,780
how do people find out about this 
company?

1012
00:40:58,910 --> 00:40:59,743
[inaudible]

1013
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,173
P,
a,

1014
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,910
c h,
a Pacha soap.

1015
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:05,103
And you can go,
I think in any auction.com I think it's 

1016
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,060
just soap.com/ soap.com but then they're
incredible,

1017
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,903
man.
They're in whole foods already in whole 

1018
00:41:12,591 --> 00:41:13,570
foods.
They just started,

1019
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,021
no,
no.

1020
00:41:14,021 --> 00:41:16,450
They've been there a few years ago.
A few years now.

1021
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,980
Fill your Easter basket.
But yeah,

1022
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:20,110
but you're saying this is all within the
last few years,

1023
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:20,770
right?
Oh yeah.

1024
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,600
Within the last few years.
Last four or five years.

1025
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,080
It's amazing.
So it's patches,

1026
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,930
soap.com yep.
[inaudible] hiring.

1027
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,360
Look at that.
There you go.

1028
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,530
Yup.
Purchase spread.

1029
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:30,400
Goodness.
Yeah.

1030
00:41:30,401 --> 00:41:32,530
Wow.
And so they do a buy one,

1031
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,364
give one,
but they do it in the right way because 

1032
00:41:35,151 --> 00:41:38,090
they're the social entrepreneurship of 
like you buy one and then here,

1033
00:41:38,091 --> 00:41:42,200
and we give one and a developing nation 
sounds really good.

1034
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:44,120
It's got the right heart,
good intentions,

1035
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,090
but it can be very dangerous if it's 
distributed in the wrong way.

1036
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,103
So there buy one give one actually 
creates jobs in the developing nation 

1037
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,153
than they make it.
And then they sell it and they're able 

1038
00:41:54,231 --> 00:41:59,231
to give it that way to their community 
instead of some of the charities.

1039
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,463
Um,
you buy something here and you go give 

1040
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,220
it over there.
And then when they go,

1041
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:08,360
they go with huge amounts and they say 
if they're dropping off shoes or clothes

1042
00:42:08,361 --> 00:42:09,194
or whatever,
the local people that have a shoe store 

1043
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,713
go out of business.
Whenever you bring in containers and 

1044
00:42:14,271 --> 00:42:15,104
containers of,
of shoes and where the guy that's 

1045
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:20,150
repairing the shoes,
the cobbler,

1046
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,590
you know,
the one that's making,

1047
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:22,573
she was there.
So you can't just go into the community 

1048
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,704
and give it out.
Actually watched a documentary recently 

1049
00:42:26,601 --> 00:42:30,410
called Poverty Inc man.
It was powerful showing how,

1050
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,693
how charity hurts or how,
there's also a great book out called 

1051
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,730
when helping hurts and it talks about 
hey charities,

1052
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,060
awesome in and when it's absolutely 
needed,

1053
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:43,880
but it's very dangerous if you use it in
the wrong way,

1054
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,500
you can cripple a community.

1055
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,410
And so how do we empower the local 
communities with a hand massage,

1056
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:51,950
pull the community by,
by giving them something for nothing.

1057
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,440
I give him something for nothing either.
Either.

1058
00:42:54,441 --> 00:42:56,540
Yeah,
that's first on the surface.

1059
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,423
Um,
that they can develop a dependence 

1060
00:42:58,941 --> 00:42:59,774
mentality of just putting a handout 
because they got to get what they can 

1061
00:43:03,021 --> 00:43:06,200
get whenever people just show up,
blow up and blow out of there.

1062
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,040
But the documentary poverty inc goes in 
there and shows how in Haiti,

1063
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:15,100
they're local farmers have been put out 
of business by government subsidies from

1064
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,113
I,
I've been to Haiti and I've seen the 

1065
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:22,580
American grown rice that's all just 
given out for free or at the markets.

1066
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,683
The people that get it for free then go 
to the market and they beat all the 

1067
00:43:25,371 --> 00:43:26,204
local farmers because they got it for 
free or they played a paid such a small 

1068
00:43:29,391 --> 00:43:30,200
price.

1069
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,033
They didn't really do all the work,
so they're able to beat all their 

1070
00:43:32,751 --> 00:43:34,430
competitors,
the local market,

1071
00:43:34,431 --> 00:43:35,720
so they get it for free and then they 
sell it.

1072
00:43:35,721 --> 00:43:36,554
Is that what you're saying?
They can at little shops they can do 

1073
00:43:37,941 --> 00:43:39,500
that or they just get it and they don't 
need it.

1074
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,363
I think it cuts off the local farmers 
who are trying to sell their own stuff 

1075
00:43:43,041 --> 00:43:44,900
and they can you,
since they're getting it for free,

1076
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:47,660
they could tell them a much lower price.
Absolutely.

1077
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,960
And it shows it.
It dives deep into how,

1078
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:55,100
how it,
how it hurts so much in a way that like,

1079
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,570
man,
I think Haiti's you there,

1080
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:01,580
they used to eat rice two to three times
a week.

1081
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,790
Now they're eating it three times a day 
with breakfast,

1082
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:05,624
lunch and dinner and they're doing it 
and it's all the rice that they have 

1083
00:44:08,121 --> 00:44:11,750
available to them are from the u s or 
from China or from India.

1084
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:15,800
And it's because these big farmers with 
a lot of power in the government,

1085
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,813
they're able to make deals with the 
United Nations and other places to be 

1086
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:20,984
able to go in and give out their rice 
there and they get paid for it from the 

1087
00:44:23,151 --> 00:44:24,080
government here,
right?

1088
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,330
You government pays these farmers,
these,

1089
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,040
these prices,
and then they go into a community.

1090
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:31,010
Just give it out.
And now how do I say this in a,

1091
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:34,860
that it's not bad intentions.
No one's trying to her.

1092
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:39,300
I don't think there's these evil people 
trying to destroy developing nations.

1093
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,433
I don't think that's the case.
But there's a model out there that's 

1094
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:47,880
been the traditional model of let's 
announce our arrival by throwing,

1095
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:50,400
throwing a parade.
Let's throw a big party.

1096
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,340
Let's get a bunch of pictures.
Um,

1097
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:54,383
and let's,
let's leave to the next one because we 

1098
00:44:56,971 --> 00:45:00,740
have such a big organization are so many
funds or,

1099
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:02,370
or a big quota to hit.

1100
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:04,500
We have,
this is our goal this year.

1101
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,580
We have this many tally marks to get.
So we blast in one community and then we

1102
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,910
blow out of there into a new one.
We don't develop relationships with them

1103
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:12,870
to build,
empower them,

1104
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:15,780
teach them skills that,
that part,

1105
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:17,123
how do I say it?
Like the answer to poverty isn't 

1106
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:21,120
charity.
It's opportunity.

1107
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,330
Opportunity is always better than 
charity,

1108
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,290
if that,
if that makes sense.

1109
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:28,200
A handout or hand up like the given 
Manna fish,

1110
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:30,960
feed him for a day or teach man a fish,
feed him for a lifetime.

1111
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:35,670
And so if there's a disaster,
if there's a person with a disability,

1112
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:39,810
if there's a war or famine than charity 
is the solution.

1113
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:42,420
But there's gotta be an escape plan.
There's got to be a route out.

1114
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,160
Otherwise,
whenever I went to Haiti,

1115
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:44,994
it was a year and a half,
two years after the earthquake and the 

1116
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:48,594
tent city,
they had had doubled or tripled in size 

1117
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,030
because I met a guy there that was 
saying I could,

1118
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,893
I moved out of my apartment which wasn't
damaged by the earthquake and I get to 

1119
00:45:58,621 --> 00:46:00,750
go live at tent city,
rent free.

1120
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:03,990
I still have my job and I get three 
meals a day,

1121
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:04,741
breakfast,
lunch,

1122
00:46:04,741 --> 00:46:06,270
and dinner.
I don't have to prepare them,

1123
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,163
I don't have to pay for them.
And so in these places are always going 

1124
00:46:10,471 --> 00:46:14,280
to be giving to that tent city and it's 
actually grown in size.

1125
00:46:14,281 --> 00:46:16,470
He was like,
I'm saving up to buy a house.

1126
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:19,590
And so it's like if people think,
oh,

1127
00:46:19,591 --> 00:46:21,840
there's just this disaster,
it's like man,

1128
00:46:21,841 --> 00:46:24,000
if someone brought in like some 
vocational training,

1129
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,133
you know,
let's teach these people how to do this 

1130
00:46:26,491 --> 00:46:28,920
kind of work.
Like I don't think honestly,

1131
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,020
most sane people,
um,

1132
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,513
out there that are living in poverty 
want to be poor for the rest of their 

1133
00:46:35,011 --> 00:46:35,844
life.
They're sitting there waiting for an 

1134
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:37,764
opportunity.
The Dad wants to put food on the table 

1135
00:46:39,331 --> 00:46:40,590
for the family.
So it was the mom,

1136
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,030
she wants to take care of her kids.

1137
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:46,530
And so whenever we can come into a 
community and spend time with them,

1138
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,060
if that makes sense,
like sit down,

1139
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:49,830
listen to them,
learn from them,

1140
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,680
and then we can say,
how can we work together?

1141
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:53,723
How can we brainstorm?
What is your community really need 

1142
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:00,330
instead of treating it like there's a 
cookie cutter solution or blueprint that

1143
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,300
since it worked in this community,
it's going to work in that community.

1144
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,720
Or since it worked in this country,
it's going to work in that country.

1145
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,040
Like every country has its own culture 
and the Congo has over 200 tribes.

1146
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:14,250
That's over 200 different cultures.
And so some are going to receive it.

1147
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,180
Well,
some aren't.

1148
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:16,283
Some how do you,
how do you work with them in a way that 

1149
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:22,170
isn't just coming in and just giving 
them stuff that,

1150
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,260
I've seen it,
I've seen a riot happened in Uganda.

1151
00:47:25,261 --> 00:47:27,300
It was in ginger,
ginger,

1152
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:30,070
Uganda.
We're a organization came in with

1153
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:33,580
a bunch of canned foods and they did it 
in a very poor fashion where,

1154
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,670
um,
they just cracked open this container in

1155
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:39,730
a slump and it's one of the roughest 
slums and Uganda,

1156
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:42,610
um,
and people just raided it.

1157
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:46,450
And it didn't even give probably a 
quarter of the people in the slums,

1158
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,570
uh,
a canned item from the u s and so people

1159
00:47:49,571 --> 00:47:52,980
start fighting over it and they're 
fighting over it and it's a,

1160
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,960
and so we got really hurt.
I don't know if they died,

1161
00:47:54,961 --> 00:47:57,280
but someone got really hurt there.
We had to get out of there.

1162
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,930
And so what I know from that 
organization is,

1163
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,640
and I'm not going to say the 
organization,

1164
00:48:03,641 --> 00:48:05,820
but I heard from the other organizations
there that they,

1165
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,440
they had been warned like,
you're new at this.

1166
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,303
Don't go in there and do this.
Don't crack open this container and do 

1167
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:12,934
it that way.

1168
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,660
But they had spent like $20,000 getting 
the canned goods there,

1169
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,550
shipping,
buying a container,

1170
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:21,130
shipping it over there,
going through Kenya,

1171
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:25,150
then uh,
then probably Tanzania or Tanzania,

1172
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:27,100
then Kenya,
then Uganda,

1173
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:27,963
they're had to pay all the fees 
everywhere they go to just go give it 

1174
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,474
away.
That $20,000 could have empowered so 

1175
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:34,474
many farmers locally or people that 
don't know how to farm to be able to 

1176
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:40,720
start farming for themselves,
that then is going to have such a better

1177
00:48:40,721 --> 00:48:43,540
return on investment because you're 
investing into the people,

1178
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:45,040
into a trade,
into a skill,

1179
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,470
into something that they need and it's 
going to last.

1180
00:48:47,471 --> 00:48:49,240
It's going to continue to produce 
results.

1181
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,103
I totally makes sense.
And I think what you're saying is so 

1182
00:48:51,551 --> 00:48:53,710
important that these people have great 
intentions,

1183
00:48:53,711 --> 00:48:54,544
but that just human nature and that 
given the circumstances of which these 

1184
00:48:58,091 --> 00:48:58,924
people live in where they had no hope 
and then all of sudden they have this 

1185
00:49:00,731 --> 00:49:03,370
one thing and it's one thing as gifts,
right?

1186
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:06,520
Far better to do what you're doing to 
provide them with opportunity.

1187
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,630
You know,
and I think that's,

1188
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:08,913
I mean the issue that I think a lot of 
people are going to have with even 

1189
00:49:11,711 --> 00:49:16,690
discussing that is the callous 
discussions of the welfare mentality.

1190
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,490
You know,
the,

1191
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,320
the way people look at some communities 
and people,

1192
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:20,691
you know,
the,

1193
00:49:20,691 --> 00:49:24,190
the term welfare brats or welfare,
you know,

1194
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:27,550
welfare people that are just kind of 
like connected to that,

1195
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,260
the,
the need for charity.

1196
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,090
And I think that mirrors,
um,

1197
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:34,120
the,
the idea of welfare and you know,

1198
00:49:34,121 --> 00:49:34,954
when people don't have jobs and don't 
have opportunities and just getting 

1199
00:49:36,671 --> 00:49:38,320
money and getting,
getting addicted to that money,

1200
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,810
that problem has existed in America as 
well.

1201
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,733
Obviously it's a much bigger deal in the
Congo because you're talking about like 

1202
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:47,020
basic life necessities,
fresh water.

1203
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:48,760
But I think that's important,
man.

1204
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,920
It's important to understand what human 
nature,

1205
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:51,813
um,
the mechanisms of human nature and like 

1206
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:55,870
what you're talking about here is really
powerful.

1207
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:56,943
There was,
you have thought it out so well and to 

1208
00:49:58,661 --> 00:49:59,494
give these people this opportunity and 
now to give these people at this 

1209
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:04,630
opportunity with the soap.
I mean Pacha is doing an awesome job.

1210
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:05,140
I mean that's,
no,

1211
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:08,830
that's an amazing thing.
I think that's so important and I really

1212
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:12,070
hope that more people listen and more 
people hear you and more people say,

1213
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:13,060
hey,
you know,

1214
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,470
I want to get involved.
Let's,

1215
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:16,060
let's do something else in the Congo.
Let's,

1216
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:16,894
let's give these people another 
opportunity that they can start 

1217
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:19,930
businesses down there,
man.

1218
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:20,923
Yeah.
And like really empower themselves and 

1219
00:50:22,091 --> 00:50:22,924
be able to build homes and just like in 
your lifetime you could see some crazy 

1220
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:27,640
change.
Yeah.

1221
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,090
Yeah.
I

1222
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,690
know.
I know that's coming and Congo,

1223
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,270
but I think like,
let's not,

1224
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:34,890
let's not set a ceiling or roof on it.
And I'm not,

1225
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,590
that's what I'm not saying that's what 
you're saying,

1226
00:50:36,591 --> 00:50:40,820
but I'm just saying that I truly believe
that the water crisis,

1227
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,240
1 billion people not having clean water 
in our lifetime,

1228
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:46,850
we have the tools,
the technology and people are learning.

1229
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:48,013
I mean from podcasting,
like people were getting better than 

1230
00:50:50,661 --> 00:50:51,590
doctorates,
degrees,

1231
00:50:51,591 --> 00:50:53,330
you know,
like in information and,

1232
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:54,164
and,
and life experience and learning and 

1233
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:56,713
learning to do things the right way and 
truly have people's best interests at 

1234
00:50:59,421 --> 00:51:00,620
heart.
Um,

1235
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,540
I think there's going to be a real shift
to where,

1236
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,733
I mean,
if I have,

1237
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:06,640
if I have the water to take a piss in,
um,

1238
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:09,650
or to water my lawn with or to give my 
dog clean water,

1239
00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:10,723
uh,
we're going to be able to give every 

1240
00:51:11,331 --> 00:51:12,650
person in the world clean water.

1241
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:13,743
Um,
but it's through empowerment and it's 

1242
00:51:15,261 --> 00:51:17,990
through opportunity and a,
and that's what I love.

1243
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,030
I even have a,
since it was world water day,

1244
00:51:20,031 --> 00:51:20,864
two days ago,
I have a video at that kind of explains 

1245
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:26,330
the problem and a,
it's from a village that,

1246
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:27,203
um,
I'm really close with and him Atilla 

1247
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,540
Hulu and there's this little girl named 
Sicu that was just a,

1248
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,970
a beautiful little girl and um,
and if it's okay,

1249
00:51:34,971 --> 00:51:38,030
but it shows what they're facing,
what they're drinking.

1250
00:51:38,060 --> 00:51:38,560
Yeah,
for sure.

1251
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,620
Um,
and man,

1252
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:40,300
it's,
it's,

1253
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,810
it's powerful.
You got that Jamie.

1254
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:43,310
Hashtag a powerful

1255
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:48,990
yeah.
Who I got my shit,

1256
00:51:55,631 --> 00:51:56,464
but my hope for my children is for them 
to go to school and back to grow in and 

1257
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,590
to be good and take care of me when I'm 
alive.

1258
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,333
Yes.

1259
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,313
Okay.

1260
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:11,963
That's the water.
They were drinking cheeses for folks 

1261
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:17,850
just listing it's green algae all over 
the surface of it.

1262
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:20,050
It looks disgusting.
Yeah.

1263
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:28,190
Everyone is suffering,
but in most cases it's our children.

1264
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,433
Hulu,

1265
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,283
Mike,
I know that water we drink gives us all 

1266
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:39,151
these sigma Sas,
my daughter's name.

1267
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,260
Okay.

1268
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,510
See I keep double.
She couldn't speak yet.

1269
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,850
She was able to grow.
She was a baby.

1270
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,680
I suffered so much when she was 
suffering.

1271
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:11,980
I brought her to the hospital.
She passed away there.

1272
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,850
If get I'm talk doctor,
I said to myself,

1273
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:26,280
I was just carrying my baby when I was,
I need to see burying her.

1274
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:30,960
They said,
how did she disappear?

1275
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,393
Where did she go?
She's carrying this water on her head 

1276
00:53:41,171 --> 00:53:42,004
folks.
His giant Jug when I lost my child was 

1277
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:46,704
that I lost all hope for the future.
We're watching a video of her walking 

1278
00:53:53,651 --> 00:53:58,651
through the Congo carrying this water 
jug on top of her head is 45 pound jug.

1279
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:02,293
Fuck man.
Does hard to deal with if someone like 

1280
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:13,500
you wasn't being attention to this?
I mean,

1281
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:16,260
do you understand like what about huge 
role you're playing here?

1282
00:54:16,530 --> 00:54:18,180
Is that,
um,

1283
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,210
I mean it's,
it's surreal and uh,

1284
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,500
but at the same time,
like I,

1285
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:23,670
yeah,

1286
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:28,670
I think that's why I've completely 
wholeheartedly dedicated my life to this

1287
00:54:28,681 --> 00:54:31,920
because that was the,
that was the first promise.

1288
00:54:31,921 --> 00:54:36,030
I didn't know that we could do anything 
with land or water food at first.

1289
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,220
Um,
now we have 3000 acres of land drilled.

1290
00:54:38,221 --> 00:54:40,980
The 62 wells.
We have three farms up and running.

1291
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:42,780
Um,
they bout to start the soap,

1292
00:54:42,781 --> 00:54:43,614
but me and like,
I didn't want to make any promises that 

1293
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,870
I couldn't keep.
And for the chief to come to us and say,

1294
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:51,930
hey,
everyone else calls us the force people,

1295
00:54:51,931 --> 00:54:54,930
but we call ourselves the forgotten.
It wrecked me.

1296
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,853
And then he said,
can you help us have a voice because we 

1297
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:00,300
don't have one?
I said,

1298
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:02,600
yes,
I knew that from fighting from Ed,

1299
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:04,660
being on the ultimate fighter.
Um,

1300
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:07,680
when did that ever grew or didn't grow?
Um,

1301
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,633
I had some people,
and just having the platform of being 

1302
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:13,290
here,
being from the West,

1303
00:55:13,291 --> 00:55:17,820
being from somewhere where people can 
have an abundance of resources to make a

1304
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:18,470
difference.

1305
00:55:18,470 --> 00:55:21,210
Um,
and even if it's small,

1306
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:24,960
like our small here is so big there.
And so,

1307
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:26,550
uh,
I said yes,

1308
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:29,340
uh,
to that and little [inaudible],

1309
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:32,460
who was the third?
A little one that I knew,

1310
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:34,010
uh,
that had passed,

1311
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:34,561
um,
an auto,

1312
00:55:34,561 --> 00:55:35,394
the Hulu.
And before that was andiebo after that 

1313
00:55:37,411 --> 00:55:39,180
was a little Babo,
um,

1314
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:41,440
a little girl named Mo also,
uh,

1315
00:55:41,590 --> 00:55:44,880
in Sang Goulay Endcap,
Tula in [inaudible].

1316
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:45,863
And,
uh,

1317
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:48,390
these are all kids that I knew that I 
was,

1318
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,400
uh,
uh,

1319
00:55:49,420 --> 00:55:52,020
had become friends with over two years 
living there.

1320
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:52,943
And,
um,

1321
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:58,790
and so have any either held them or 
buried them are having played,

1322
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,853
grown up knowing their families are 
seeing some of those kids grow up and 

1323
00:56:04,011 --> 00:56:06,060
then their lives get cut short.
Um,

1324
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:06,990
it's been like,
man,

1325
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:10,140
like when I fight,
it's an honor for them when I talk about

1326
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,240
this problem.
Like I know the,

1327
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:13,433
it's not just I read about it or I just 
maybe saw it and it hurt for a little 

1328
00:56:17,191 --> 00:56:17,460
while.

1329
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,050
Like I knew him.
Like those,

1330
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:20,213
those kids,
800 kids a day from diary in 2,350 from 

1331
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,853
another 1.5 billion a year.
Like I know the names of some of those 

1332
00:56:25,871 --> 00:56:28,210
kids and had relationships with them and
their families.

1333
00:56:28,211 --> 00:56:29,840
And so,
um,

1334
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:31,363
um,
I never would've thought that test that 

1335
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:33,994
I would be in a position to try to,
to help or that I even knew about the 

1336
00:56:38,201 --> 00:56:39,370
problem.
I didn't,

1337
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,860
um,
until he hit me upside the head.

1338
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:42,813
But,
uh,

1339
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,950
but now that,
that's where my life has gone and that's

1340
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:47,410
what I'm going to dedicate it to.
Wow.

1341
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:48,760
That's powerful shit,
dude.

1342
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:51,340
He'll live in a fucking crazy life.
Yeah,

1343
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:52,990
you really are.
I mean,

1344
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:55,540
you,
you really living a life of purpose.

1345
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,793
It's so rare that someone does it,
but it's such a high level and now 

1346
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,700
you're,
you're in a very strange situation.

1347
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:05,860
Very strange driver's seat in life.

1348
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:06,880
Well,
think,

1349
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,490
I mean,
yeah,

1350
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:10,060
it's definitely strange.
But thank you to you man,

1351
00:57:10,061 --> 00:57:10,894
for,
uh,

1352
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,120
for leave and allowing me to have this 
platform before we drilled.

1353
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,130
I mean like we were,
we were getting to it.

1354
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,053
Um,
but,

1355
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:23,920
but we hadn't actually completed it yet.
It's kind of how Andrew was listening to

1356
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,890
the gre while he's being a janitor had 
this dream.

1357
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,800
I had this dream and you allowed me to 
come on and share about it.

1358
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:33,520
And so many like stars have aligned 
because of that.

1359
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,320
Um,
and,

1360
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,110
and there's just been a lot of really 
great stuff that,

1361
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:39,370
that knife,
actually,

1362
00:57:39,371 --> 00:57:41,380
I have a picture for you.
If maldon up a,

1363
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,900
a knife.
It's a made out of a nail.

1364
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,490
It's actually,
I use this to open up all my letters and

1365
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:47,830
packages and stuff.
Yeah.

1366
00:57:47,831 --> 00:57:48,664
So awesome.
Chiefly Leo made both of those for Ya 

1367
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,470
and uh,
uh,

1368
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,660
I think on that little file it says 
knife.

1369
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,553
Um,
and I actually had a picture I didn't 

1370
00:57:58,421 --> 00:58:01,480
get to show you yet,
but this is how he makes the knives.

1371
00:58:01,870 --> 00:58:02,703
Um,
but he just finds the nails out in the 

1372
00:58:04,751 --> 00:58:05,584
forest and uh,
some ladders or different things and he 

1373
00:58:08,021 --> 00:58:09,310
pulls him out.
Uh,

1374
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,900
think people do,
forcing the rain forest,

1375
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:13,420
he gets their nails and make some 
something,

1376
00:58:13,421 --> 00:58:15,400
uh,
something useful.

1377
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,610
Um,
and so that,

1378
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,473
that's a picture of the knife.
I think there might be one more picture 

1379
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,820
of him making the knives.
So what he's doing is he's taking a nail

1380
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:29,050
and he's hammering it flat and he's 
taking this big spike nail,

1381
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:29,884
like a construction nail,
like a railroad and not quite a 

1382
00:58:33,791 --> 00:58:35,760
railroad.
The site,

1383
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:36,780
actually,
the one in his wreck,

1384
00:58:36,781 --> 00:58:37,840
a framing nail,
right.

1385
00:58:37,841 --> 00:58:38,674
That makes all the one in his right hand
that he hammers it down with uses a 

1386
00:58:41,441 --> 00:58:41,800
hammer.

1387
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,250
It's a railroad spike.
Yeah.

1388
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,593
So,
uh,

1389
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,440
just really creative.
And this is actually,

1390
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,930
if you pull up the other one that says,
oh yeah,

1391
00:58:49,931 --> 00:58:52,600
there he is with some of the Kiddos.
This whole Swazi on the right.

1392
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:55,210
Um,
and there's the huts behind them and the

1393
00:58:55,211 --> 00:58:57,100
twigs and leaves.
They make those kinds of doorways,

1394
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,540
uh,
in there.

1395
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:01,390
And um,
it's just been really cool.

1396
00:59:01,391 --> 00:59:04,690
They live on 247 acres.
It's land that they have,

1397
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,090
um,
for the first time.

1398
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,760
And Oh man.
So I,

1399
00:59:09,761 --> 00:59:10,594
that,
that video was powerful because it 

1400
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:12,844
showed the problem,
but there's actually one that's with 

1401
00:59:14,621 --> 00:59:15,930
chief Leo May,
uh,

1402
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,193
it's the second video on,
on that list and if I can show that to 

1403
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,680
you,
I got something for Ya from there.

1404
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:24,440
From Leo mays village,
it's called the Bofi.

1405
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:26,390
Um,
and there's a video,

1406
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:27,683
uh,
that's going to show like kind of the 

1407
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,430
transformation or the solution kind of 
to the problem.

1408
00:59:31,650 --> 00:59:33,620
And that just,
that first video just showed the problem

1409
00:59:33,621 --> 00:59:34,460
is hard.
Right?

1410
00:59:34,461 --> 00:59:37,000
But then there's hope to see what we can
do something about it.

1411
00:59:37,001 --> 00:59:37,834
Yeah.

1412
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:46,870
Real transformation changes the present 
and the future.

1413
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:47,973
Hey,

1414
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,720
so he's walking with,
my name is Leona hunting.

1415
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,880
The label born from above you village.

1416
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,050
I want to teach my grandson how to hunt.

1417
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:16,023
We are teaching these young boys this 
because this is our original way of 

1418
01:00:19,011 --> 01:00:19,844
life.

1419
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:25,030
One day we'll die,
but these young people will live on.

1420
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:37,560
I love that.
Gorgeous.

1421
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,070
People treat pygmies like we aren't 
important about Bob.

1422
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:47,740
They think we're stupid,
but when we worked on farms,

1423
01:00:51,051 --> 01:00:56,051
we would get 10 or 15 bananas to split 
among seven people by Bob tried to start

1424
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,220
a small farm.
Someone would take it from me and say,

1425
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:02,503
your father did not own any land.
2013 Leo may spill at your seat land of 

1426
01:01:14,861 --> 01:01:17,080
their own.
It's about 247 acres.

1427
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:23,413
I was happy to have my own lane,
but we weren't getting water from the 

1428
01:01:26,841 --> 01:01:30,140
river.
He was bad or people were sick.

1429
01:01:30,170 --> 01:01:31,003
One day you should get it,
but sometimes they would get sick and 

1430
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:39,941
die without treatment.
I've never heard of anybody getting sick

1431
01:01:59,611 --> 01:02:01,560
from the water since we've had the well 
here.

1432
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,760
It's so good.
It's so sweet.

1433
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,710
I love it.
I'm with the big change is that

1434
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:13,090
farm before and after the same place?
All those banana trees

1435
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,790
you started with the potatoes didn't 
cassava.

1436
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,120
Then we planted some banana trees.

1437
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,580
Banana trees.
Have you planted that?

1438
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:39,730
I cannot.
It's a lot.

1439
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:42,700
I can't finish county.

1440
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:00,380
What Nissan in his make up the first 
time we took bananas to the market,

1441
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:01,573
we bought clothes for the children.
When we saw them wearing clothes and 

1442
01:03:04,701 --> 01:03:06,290
shoes,
we were so happy.

1443
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:14,660
Today we have a toilet,
we have a place to wash our hands.

1444
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,960
We have a place to shower.
So to me that's progress,

1445
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:24,973
right?
Because he made everybody get getting 

1446
01:03:36,171 --> 01:03:38,340
erection in generation.
Judah,

1447
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,430
we've beat this land.

1448
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:46,743
Wow.

1449
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:52,850
And Tans who not just living your whole 
life in despair and then all of a sudden

1450
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,840
the last few years,
things radically change for the better.

1451
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,910
That's powerful,
man.

1452
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,750
Wow,
man.

1453
01:04:05,830 --> 01:04:07,420
What a crazy thing you're doing justin 
wren.

1454
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:10,203
Well,
I,

1455
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,920
to be completely honest,
me and like I got to be the spark plug,

1456
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,160
but man,
there's a big engine around this.

1457
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:21,010
Oh Hey stan state side water four.
Without a doubt.

1458
01:04:21,011 --> 01:04:23,260
All of our supporters couldn't do 
without them,

1459
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,250
but mostly we couldn't do it without the
people on the ground.

1460
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,113
There in the Congo,
18 Congolese people with a heart to 

1461
01:04:30,611 --> 01:04:33,280
change be the change in their own 
country,

1462
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,080
to change the country from the inside 
out,

1463
01:04:35,081 --> 01:04:36,220
countryman,
the countryman,

1464
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,530
uh,
not being dependent on others.

1465
01:04:38,531 --> 01:04:39,364
I mean they're,
they're starting to secure water 

1466
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:42,160
contracts,
uh,

1467
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:45,040
to drill wells and do water projects in 
their own country.

1468
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,080
So that way they don't have to be 
dependent on us.

1469
01:04:47,110 --> 01:04:47,943
I mean,
our team in Uganda is over 70% self 

1470
01:04:50,921 --> 01:04:53,230
sufficient,
self funded inside the country,

1471
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,670
our guys in Congo or close to 50%.
Um,

1472
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:57,633
and we're on track to get these teams to
where they're 100% self sufficient to 

1473
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:04,540
where we just come in with the training 
and the techniques and the tools.

1474
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:07,240
But like they don't need us to fund it 
anymore.

1475
01:05:07,360 --> 01:05:10,000
So that way we can go off to other 
places and do it again.

1476
01:05:10,030 --> 01:05:11,620
Replicated.
Wow.

1477
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:12,633
So what is the,
is there a longterm strategy in terms 

1478
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:16,060
of,
yeah,

1479
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:16,894
so basically things that work in their 
context so that way we give them like 

1480
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:23,830
the manual drilling.
Um,

1481
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:25,023
one instance,
I don't know why this Swahili proverb 

1482
01:05:26,561 --> 01:05:28,450
just popped in my mind,
but they say,

1483
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:29,650
you,
you Americans,

1484
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:32,500
are you westerners?
You guys all have watched us,

1485
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:34,180
but we're the ones that,
who,

1486
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,073
who have time.

1487
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,630
And so,
uh,

1488
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:37,871
does that make sense?
Like,

1489
01:05:37,871 --> 01:05:39,850
you guys don't have watches,
but we have time.

1490
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:42,700
And they see us as always rushing,
rushing,

1491
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:43,534
rushing,
and trying to get this done and that 

1492
01:05:44,681 --> 01:05:45,550
done and this done.
And they're like,

1493
01:05:45,551 --> 01:05:47,470
hey,
it's good to go out and crush things and

1494
01:05:47,471 --> 01:05:50,350
get so many goals and so many 
accomplishments under your belt,

1495
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:53,140
but let's make sure we're doing it all 
the right way.

1496
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,730
So that's what I mean,
honestly,

1497
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,250
I've learned from them.
Slow it down so you can do it right,

1498
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,350
do it correctly.
Um,

1499
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,590
I've even started implement that into my
lifting and in training,

1500
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:03,424
right?
Like slow things down to a slow 

1501
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:05,794
controlled and do it correctly instead 
of just trying to put up a bunch of 

1502
01:06:08,321 --> 01:06:09,690
white.
Um,

1503
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,290
and so they're,
they,

1504
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,600
they slow things down.
Um,

1505
01:06:13,890 --> 01:06:14,410
and,
and,

1506
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,243
and honestly,
the longterm solution is reason why we 

1507
01:06:18,281 --> 01:06:19,720
don't take volunteers anymore.

1508
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:20,943
Um,
and I've only taken two people with me 

1509
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:23,920
to the Congo.
Uh,

1510
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:27,790
but they were Geo hydrologist or 
engineers that needed to come.

1511
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,700
Uh,
but the reason is,

1512
01:06:29,701 --> 01:06:32,200
is because when you take volunteers 
over,

1513
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:35,980
most of them are going to be amateurs or
they're going to be white belts.

1514
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:39,580
If I had to put it into a mma or Bjj 
analogy,

1515
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:41,980
um,
and our guys in the field,

1516
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:42,814
they're,
they're becoming black belts where they 

1517
01:06:44,051 --> 01:06:47,440
are now after years of training,
years of development on this,

1518
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,870
since 2011,
um,

1519
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:52,300
I mean,
our guys in Congo,

1520
01:06:52,301 --> 01:06:54,820
I've drilled those 62 wells,
but they went to Sierra Leone.

1521
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:57,460
They taught a team in Cameroon from the 
ground up.

1522
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,560
They went to Uganda,
Kenya,

1523
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,740
and Rwanda.
And they're,

1524
01:07:02,741 --> 01:07:03,574
these teams are working together and 
they're going off after they learn how 

1525
01:07:05,801 --> 01:07:06,634
to do it,
they're going to other communities in 

1526
01:07:07,781 --> 01:07:10,270
their own country or they're going to 
another country.

1527
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,630
It's so cool.
We have this dynamic going on between,

1528
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:14,493
we call it the Varunga initiative.
There's the Virunga mountains that are 

1529
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:20,470
on the border of Uganda,
Rwanda and Congo.

1530
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:23,470
Now there's so many,
uh,

1531
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:25,040
rebel groups,
uh,

1532
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:26,610
that are there.
Um,

1533
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:27,843
and,
and the w those countries I've been at 

1534
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:30,274
war against each other.
Like the people from those nations 

1535
01:07:33,131 --> 01:07:33,964
pretty much hate each other.
Like they all blame the one another for 

1536
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,730
you guys are doing this in our country 
and your rebel,

1537
01:07:39,731 --> 01:07:40,564
you're sending rebels into our country 
and where your government soldiers are 

1538
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:43,684
actually pretending to be rebels,
but they're working for the government 

1539
01:07:45,281 --> 01:07:46,720
and they're stealing our golden her 
diamonds.

1540
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:48,130
And anyways,
so they,

1541
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:49,713
they don't work together.
But now our well drillers that are from 

1542
01:07:52,241 --> 01:07:56,650
Rwanda and Uganda and Congo,
they're all working so much together.

1543
01:07:56,651 --> 01:07:59,080
We get everything in from Uganda.
Um,

1544
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:00,610
our team goes to co,
uh,

1545
01:08:00,670 --> 01:08:03,370
Rwanda from Congo to teach them how to 
train,

1546
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:07,720
but that Rwandan team comes over to us 
and teaches us business principles.

1547
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,560
Um,
and so it's just been so cool to see how

1548
01:08:11,561 --> 01:08:12,394
they're working together and how are 
guys in Congo or holding Ugandan and 

1549
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:17,864
Rwandan flags over their back taking 
pictures and the other guys are wearing 

1550
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,153
Congo flags over their back.
And our team that came from Uganda to 

1551
01:08:25,161 --> 01:08:25,994
live with me for three months in our 
team to help us really get off the 

1552
01:08:28,431 --> 01:08:29,264
ground and start learning.
They had drilled over 100 wells for 

1553
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,313
their fellow Ugandans.
They left for three months to come live 

1554
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:38,670
with us in Congo there.
First Day there they,

1555
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:39,950
they,
the car flipped,

1556
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,310
their taxi driver flipped a,
the car ran over,

1557
01:08:43,311 --> 01:08:44,144
a woman killed her.
They don't speak the Congolese Swahili 

1558
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:49,850
or French there from an English speaking
nation and Uganda.

1559
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:54,800
And all of a sudden they had the car was
looted,

1560
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,710
it was torched.
Um,

1561
01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:00,920
and people were chasing them down,
wanting to put tires around them and set

1562
01:09:00,921 --> 01:09:03,680
them on fire and burned them and kill 
them because they were Ugandan.

1563
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:04,753
They got in an accident.
It's the whole mob justice kind of 

1564
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:09,590
mentality that happens.
Like if,

1565
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:12,170
if they send them to the jail or court,
they know that,

1566
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:13,363
you know,
justice probably won't be had if they 

1567
01:09:15,051 --> 01:09:16,790
have money on them.
And so,

1568
01:09:16,791 --> 01:09:18,740
uh,
people just want justice.

1569
01:09:18,741 --> 01:09:20,930
Then it's kind of wild over there and,
uh,

1570
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:22,093
and that area of the world.
So these Ugandan guys literally knew 

1571
01:09:24,171 --> 01:09:25,004
they're risking their lives to come live
with us in Congo just because they're 

1572
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:28,154
hated by Congolese.
But then whenever they flipped their 

1573
01:09:30,021 --> 01:09:31,250
vehicle,
first day,

1574
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,920
they're there on the border,
basically still of Uganda.

1575
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:38,420
They're in a town called Nica,
which means snake and they hit a lady,

1576
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:39,313
it killed her.
And that was the taxi driver drive and 

1577
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,493
he's not part of our team.
But then they all wanted to kill the 

1578
01:09:44,841 --> 01:09:46,790
Ugandan guys inside of the Congolese 
guy.

1579
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:50,210
Um,
and then they still stuck it out.

1580
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:54,230
We're able to regain our $15,000 a well 
drilling equipment that was there.

1581
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:55,570
Luckily we had a,
uh,

1582
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:58,280
this is a side topic,
but we had this,

1583
01:09:58,281 --> 01:09:59,114
um,
this water filtration system that was 

1584
01:10:01,971 --> 01:10:04,490
from solar panels and they had these two
big chambers on it.

1585
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:05,324
And in the middle is this timer that you
literally twist and it goes for an hour 

1586
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:10,850
and has a green and red light on it and 
it ticks tick,

1587
01:10:10,851 --> 01:10:11,211
tick,
tick,

1588
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:12,044
tick,
tick.

1589
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:12,913
Well,
we had it locked up whenever it came 

1590
01:10:13,851 --> 01:10:16,520
from the states and our Ugandan team 
picked it up and they go,

1591
01:10:16,521 --> 01:10:21,260
hey the the something called Tsa broke 
off the lock and left you a note.

1592
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:22,483
And so they are checking it cause it 
looked like these two chambers and a 

1593
01:10:24,111 --> 01:10:27,320
timer and it looked like it could've 
been a bomb in this big Pelican case.

1594
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:31,040
So whenever the Congolese guys loaded 
the car,

1595
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:31,993
set it on fire,
they ran away with it and hid behind a 

1596
01:10:34,131 --> 01:10:35,180
hut.
Um,

1597
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,280
well whenever they opened that Pelican 
case,

1598
01:10:37,310 --> 01:10:38,143
all of a sudden they thought it was a 
bomb and they ran away and left all of 

1599
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:41,474
our stuff there.
So whenever they found out that these 

1600
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:44,413
guys from Uganda already risked their 
lives to come here and teach Congolese 

1601
01:10:48,260 --> 01:10:51,410
how to drill wells for themselves,
they were truly good guys.

1602
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:52,244
It was just an accident.
They got behind us and let us back to 

1603
01:10:56,270 --> 01:10:58,910
our equipment and said,
be careful though.

1604
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,800
Like that bond,
that's why we left it out there.

1605
01:11:00,890 --> 01:11:03,920
So they understood that it was a big 
misunderstanding.

1606
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:04,783
Yeah,
it was a big misunderstanding that 

1607
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:07,070
forgave those people for,
gave them for,

1608
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,860
gave our Ugandan well drillers who 
weren't even really a part of it.

1609
01:11:09,861 --> 01:11:12,020
There was the taxi driver that actually 
hit,

1610
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:12,883
did they apologize for,
to stick tires around them and light 

1611
01:11:14,611 --> 01:11:15,360
them on fire?

1612
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:16,500
Yeah,
absolutely.

1613
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:17,903
And so,
uh,

1614
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:19,200
so anyway,
that's a long story.

1615
01:11:19,201 --> 01:11:20,034
It was crazy wild and we thought our 
guys are going to die because we were 

1616
01:11:21,871 --> 01:11:25,650
like six hours away from him and we were
hearing like a Ryan basically happening.

1617
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:28,410
Um,
but it was so cool man,

1618
01:11:28,411 --> 01:11:29,244
that,
uh,

1619
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,980
that we got all our supplies back and 
then afterwards,

1620
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,060
um,
I mean we,

1621
01:11:34,340 --> 01:11:35,290
we,
we gave,

1622
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:39,120
we helped with the burial process and 
the funeral and everything else.

1623
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:40,950
Even though it was the taxi driver,
not us.

1624
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:42,780
We,
we felt so bad that that had happened.

1625
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:44,700
But then to know like,
hey,

1626
01:11:45,210 --> 01:11:46,980
now it was just a story that we were 
able to,

1627
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:47,610
I mean,
not,

1628
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,960
not that loss of life,
but,

1629
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,490
but those people now know that we're 
here to help them.

1630
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:53,880
Uh,
and we were able to go back in there and

1631
01:11:53,881 --> 01:11:55,050
do that for them afterwards.

1632
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:57,510
So it's amazing,
man.

1633
01:11:57,540 --> 01:11:58,373
I mean,
I know there's a book that a Loretta 

1634
01:12:02,130 --> 01:12:03,030
Hunt wrote with you,
right.

1635
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:06,780
But you've lived another life since the 
book.

1636
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,920
Yeah.
You know,

1637
01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:09,120
I mean,
you have another books,

1638
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:10,210
life,
uh,

1639
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:10,951
books,
well,

1640
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:12,570
life's worth of them.
What's the word?

1641
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,270
Way To describe it?
Another easily another book.

1642
01:12:15,450 --> 01:12:16,800
Right.
Well thanks.

1643
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,313
Well,
that's what I love about me and these 

1644
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,020
short films.
That's all part of the documentary.

1645
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:23,550
Um,
in fact,

1646
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,384
maybe,
I mean,

1647
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:27,720
I should probably say that like after I 
was on the second or third time here,

1648
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,583
we did a kickstarter for the documentary
and we got it fully funded yet the 

1649
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:34,920
documentary is not out yet because we're
going back one more time,

1650
01:12:34,990 --> 01:12:36,570
uh,
to film a,

1651
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:38,850
they'll probably be July or August right
after my fight.

1652
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:39,684
We'll bust over there and we're trying 
to submit it to sundance film festival 

1653
01:12:42,451 --> 01:12:43,080
this year.

1654
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:47,790
We submit it in September.
Hopefully we get in the festival.

1655
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:48,953
Um,
it will be there in January and then it 

1656
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:51,434
will be out in a lot of the gre 
supporters that gave to the kickstarter 

1657
01:12:53,851 --> 01:12:56,760
will be able to do it.
But we really wanted to do the story,

1658
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:59,660
not the story when do the pygmies,
um,

1659
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:03,960
in their family in and everyone's 
suffering for the world from the world's

1660
01:13:03,961 --> 01:13:04,794
water crisis.
We wanted to do them justice to give 

1661
01:13:07,321 --> 01:13:09,840
them a voice.
The book was me giving them a voice,

1662
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:12,210
but the documentary,
they're going to have their own voice.

1663
01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:13,403
And so it's been so cool.
It's been filmed over three and a half 

1664
01:13:14,791 --> 01:13:16,110
years now.
I think when it comes out,

1665
01:13:16,290 --> 01:13:17,123
there'll be a four full years that 
Derek's been able to go back and forth 

1666
01:13:20,521 --> 01:13:24,390
and go get more of the story and show 
not just like them getting water for the

1667
01:13:24,391 --> 01:13:26,610
first time,
but then also how we're giving jobs,

1668
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,100
how they're getting trained,
how they're starting up workshops,

1669
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,113
how we're breaking ground on the soa 
production facility where already have 

1670
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:33,060
the land.

1671
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,490
We started the foundation of the place.
And,

1672
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:36,713
um,
and so how it's the full spectrum of it 

1673
01:13:38,911 --> 01:13:42,990
to,
to hopefully show how empowerment,

1674
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,450
uh,
how much farther that goes.

1675
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,940
Now it's a lot tougher.
It takes a lot more time.

1676
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:53,120
You really have to be strategic.
You have to sit and listen and learn and

1677
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:55,860
be humble enough to say like it's a 
learning process.

1678
01:13:55,861 --> 01:13:56,694
Like when you do something,
whenever you get out of that lane of 

1679
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:04,380
truly listening and saying,
I think that's,

1680
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:07,500
that's the quote that our team tries to 
live by.

1681
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,830
It's a swahili proverb that says if you 
want to go fast,

1682
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,380
go alone,
but if you want to go far go together.

1683
01:14:15,340 --> 01:14:18,370
And so it's like how,
how can every community we go in,

1684
01:14:18,550 --> 01:14:19,383
how can we take this as far as we can 
not go as fast as we can because if we 

1685
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,760
want to go fast,
we just leave them out of it.

1686
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,520
But if we want to go far,
we'll go together.

1687
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,080
And so we do that with our well drilling
team,

1688
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,943
but we do that with the communities too 
because they all lived like a saying 

1689
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:35,050
that that's just ingrained in them.
Wow.

1690
01:14:35,770 --> 01:14:37,990
Do you have a long term strategy with 
this?

1691
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:39,730
Like do you,
do you see yourself,

1692
01:14:39,731 --> 01:14:40,564
like how long do you see yourself 
fighting and what do you see yourself 

1693
01:14:42,521 --> 01:14:45,280
doing after you're done with that?
Um,

1694
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,470
I think I'm going to fight for the next 
five to seven years.

1695
01:14:50,900 --> 01:14:51,701
I,
well,

1696
01:14:51,701 --> 01:14:53,470
I mean,
if I can go out on top,

1697
01:14:53,471 --> 01:14:55,270
I'd love to do that.
Um,

1698
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,790
I don't think I need to carry it too 
long,

1699
01:14:57,791 --> 01:15:01,760
too far and go out on a bad note of a 
string of brutal losses.

1700
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,250
Um,
I think,

1701
01:15:03,251 --> 01:15:05,620
uh,
I want to get that platform when you get

1702
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:06,440
to the top.

1703
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:07,273
Um,
and then I want to delete and go do 

1704
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:10,630
something else and,
uh,

1705
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,700
which is this.
But man,

1706
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:13,623
it's been so cool.
Our team and Sierra Leone and our team 

1707
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:16,770
and uh,
uh,

1708
01:15:16,870 --> 01:15:19,420
Kenya and now we're about to do it in 
Rwanda.

1709
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:22,600
We did this like crowdfunding campaign 
that we threw up on world water day.

1710
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,920
We're doing it through the rest of the 
month.

1711
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:26,980
Um,
but we have started water towers.

1712
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:30,160
So basically we drill a well and then we
have a water tower,

1713
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:34,750
which turns into a water kiosk where 
people from the community come up to it.

1714
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:37,570
They might pay pay five shillings for 
Jerry Cam.

1715
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:39,850
So jerry cans,
five gallons,

1716
01:15:39,851 --> 01:15:40,684
they pay 5 cents,
but eventually all the people in the 

1717
01:15:42,581 --> 01:15:44,320
community,
the one in Rwanda we're doing,

1718
01:15:44,350 --> 01:15:47,050
it's going to serve 4,000 people.
It's at a school.

1719
01:15:47,051 --> 01:15:49,690
So the kids will have clean water all 
throughout the day,

1720
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:53,920
but then people come there and the one 
in Kenya is funding a school,

1721
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:56,500
but the one in Rwanda is going to fund 
more water wells.

1722
01:15:56,710 --> 01:16:00,400
So as these people by clean water,
the only clean water around there,

1723
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:02,410
that community,
the only thing they have to drink,

1724
01:16:02,411 --> 01:16:04,280
there's a lake that,
uh,

1725
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:07,750
has the cows and everything else 
drinking out of it.

1726
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,003
Cow patties are inside the water.
And you can see people collecting water 

1727
01:16:12,581 --> 01:16:14,980
at the same time that cows are drinking 
from it right beside them.

1728
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,940
Uh,
people washing clothes in it,

1729
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,910
they're washing motorcycles in it.
Um,

1730
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:22,450
and then that's their drinking water.
And so we're putting up this water kiosk

1731
01:16:22,451 --> 01:16:23,284
where yeah,
we're going to charge him 5 cents when 

1732
01:16:24,341 --> 01:16:25,174
they get five gallons of clean water,
but those are going to turn into 

1733
01:16:27,191 --> 01:16:28,930
multiple water wells throughout the 
year.

1734
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:30,243
And so we're trying to do all these 
sustainable solutions to where after we 

1735
01:16:32,111 --> 01:16:34,630
do that in Rwanda,
we're taking that to the Congo,

1736
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,523
there'll be close to the soa production 
facility in the community development 

1737
01:16:38,111 --> 01:16:38,350
center.

1738
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,030
We're going to have,
which will have land,

1739
01:16:40,031 --> 01:16:41,350
water,
food solutions,

1740
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,240
um,
even the forestry,

1741
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,750
what we felt to replant over 4,000 trees
now in the Congo.

1742
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,640
And it's like,
because of deforestation,

1743
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:49,474
so brutal.
So I think it's just sitting back and 

1744
01:16:50,801 --> 01:16:51,940
saying,
what do you guys need?

1745
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,980
Listening and learning that need and 
saying,

1746
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,270
okay,
where can we fit in?

1747
01:16:55,540 --> 01:16:58,270
How can we help in this area?
Who's a specialist?

1748
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:02,560
How can we really make an impact?
I think our lame is definitely water.

1749
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:06,490
I mean from that chiefly Omi village or 
the story that you just saw,

1750
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,740
but bofi where he made that knife for 
Ya.

1751
01:17:09,230 --> 01:17:10,063
Um,
you can see that water changes 

1752
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:14,870
everything.
And so that's going to be what hubs,

1753
01:17:15,230 --> 01:17:16,130
that's our hub,
that's,

1754
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:18,980
that's our lane and that's what all of 
the waterfall teams are doing.

1755
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:20,983
But in the Congo,
because of the pygmies are so 

1756
01:17:22,281 --> 01:17:23,114
vulnerable,
we're trying to find the ways to help 

1757
01:17:24,321 --> 01:17:24,920
them come up.

1758
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:25,753
And as they come up,
other people are watching and looking 

1759
01:17:27,321 --> 01:17:29,630
and they're starting to implement the 
same kind of things.

1760
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,160
So it's pretty cool to see that happen.
And before I forget,

1761
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:37,100
the reason I wanted to show that video 
was I got you something.

1762
01:17:37,101 --> 01:17:38,990
This is Leo [inaudible] wife.
So you have the,

1763
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,660
you have the,
the knife from Leo May,

1764
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:43,003
his wife made you this right here.
And so because from our second jre 

1765
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:50,450
episode,
I believe,

1766
01:17:50,690 --> 01:17:54,440
uh,
we funded a water well there in Bofi and

1767
01:17:54,441 --> 01:17:55,160
so,
uh,

1768
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,510
she's really talented.
Um,

1769
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:00,410
I mean it might not look like too much 
here,

1770
01:18:00,411 --> 01:18:01,400
but uh,
it's cool.

1771
01:18:01,401 --> 01:18:03,560
What does that mean?
It's bark cloth.

1772
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:04,573
So it's a tree bark cloth.
And when they take the bark off the 

1773
01:18:07,011 --> 01:18:07,880
trees,
fine.

1774
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:09,883
But they a,
that used to be what they would make 

1775
01:18:10,851 --> 01:18:11,684
their clothing out of their clothing.
They would make other materials out of 

1776
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:15,713
them.

1777
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:16,713
They can make these little kind of 
carrying cases or backpacks kind of out 

1778
01:18:19,221 --> 01:18:20,054
of it.
Did they treat it with something like 

1779
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:22,154
how do they get it so soft?
They pound it down and I haven't seen 

1780
01:18:24,621 --> 01:18:25,454
the whole process,
but I've seen the bark and where they 

1781
01:18:26,871 --> 01:18:31,871
pull it off and then they kind of beat 
it down and beat it down until it's this

1782
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:32,714
like cloth.
I know that this right here when I've 

1783
01:18:34,551 --> 01:18:37,280
been doing research,
they have those pygmy,

1784
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:40,220
uh,
boothy pygmy paintings that are made out

1785
01:18:40,221 --> 01:18:43,520
of bark cloth at Lake Card,
National Museum of history in New York.

1786
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:44,673
Um,
they have a few of these there and so 

1787
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:48,320
it's Kinda cool to see.
I Dunno,

1788
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:49,280
I just was,
uh,

1789
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:52,940
was excited to bring it back to you.
I think I got a picture of said painting

1790
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:54,780
and um,
it's,

1791
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:56,900
it's Mama Leo May and she's,
uh,

1792
01:18:57,560 --> 01:18:58,660
she's paying that for Esl.

1793
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:00,050
That's awesome man.
Thank you.

1794
01:19:00,051 --> 01:19:00,831
Yeah.
And thank her.

1795
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:01,700
Please.
I will.

1796
01:19:01,790 --> 01:19:02,900
That's so cool.
I will,

1797
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:04,970
they just have,
when I go back sometimes they're like,

1798
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:06,690
hey,
well that's you're making it.

1799
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,000
Thank your friends.
Yeah.

1800
01:19:08,001 --> 01:19:08,834
So that one's not the same one.
I actually didn't think to or I didn't 

1801
01:19:12,411 --> 01:19:14,300
get picture of it whenever she was 
painting this one,

1802
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,190
but I got a picture of her doing some 
other ones.

1803
01:19:17,210 --> 01:19:21,410
That's a Mamma Swazi and uh,
she's pretty great at it as well.

1804
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:23,750
And so they just,
uh,

1805
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:25,820
yeah,
I mean that's a little bowl.

1806
01:19:25,821 --> 01:19:27,050
We'll leafs,
um,

1807
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:29,150
this paint that you actually have there 
was,

1808
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,043
they had some leftover black paint,
but sometimes on that other photo they 

1809
01:19:33,891 --> 01:19:38,450
just use like cassava or berries and 
they beat it up a pound it down and make

1810
01:19:38,451 --> 01:19:41,090
this paint out of it.
But it kind of fades over time.

1811
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:43,100
So this one's one where,
yeah,

1812
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:44,053
that's,
that's it right there where they just 

1813
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:48,500
pound up the stuff and it's part of 
their culture.

1814
01:19:48,501 --> 01:19:49,334
It's what they love to do.
They kind of how he saw Leo may a pass 

1815
01:19:51,871 --> 01:19:52,790
him down,
uh,

1816
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:54,043
you know,
the farming and that video was actually 

1817
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,220
San g over here from the hand print 
that,

1818
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:01,130
yeah,
he got his grandson.

1819
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:02,243
Um,
and this is what the women pass down to 

1820
01:20:03,231 --> 01:20:05,960
their girls is how to make the spark 
cloth and how to,

1821
01:20:06,410 --> 01:20:07,620
um,
how to paint.

1822
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:08,160
So

1823
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,390
wow.
It's pretty neat.

1824
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:11,910
Their culture,
like they just do everything together.

1825
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:14,970
They rally around each other,
they're happy together.

1826
01:20:14,971 --> 01:20:15,840
They sing,
they dance,

1827
01:20:15,841 --> 01:20:18,260
but they also suffer together.
If one person,

1828
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,430
the community is lost,
even for instance,

1829
01:20:20,950 --> 01:20:25,560
it might sound weird in our culture,
but let's say a mother passes away who's

1830
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:26,460
dear?
Like,

1831
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:27,750
she's breastfeeding,
right?

1832
01:20:27,780 --> 01:20:30,150
And she passes away,
but the baby survives.

1833
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:31,163
Some other woman in the village will 
take the baby up and start taking care 

1834
01:20:34,141 --> 01:20:35,770
of that little one.
And um,

1835
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:39,210
there is an adoption in the pygmy 
culture like you do.

1836
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:40,133
No one,
no one needs to be adopted because the 

1837
01:20:41,851 --> 01:20:44,460
community rallies around them when 
someone's lost,

1838
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,323
they all mourn the death together,
but then they rally around that family 

1839
01:20:47,881 --> 01:20:50,790
and see how they can all help and put 
in.

1840
01:20:50,791 --> 01:20:52,920
So it's pretty cool.
I love it.

1841
01:20:52,921 --> 01:20:54,000
I've,
I've learned a lot from him.

1842
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,350
Well,
that's how people used to be,

1843
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:56,184
man.
That's,

1844
01:20:56,250 --> 01:21:00,750
that's the original sort of tribal life 
of human beings.

1845
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,430
They,
they would all raise each other.

1846
01:21:02,431 --> 01:21:04,680
Christopher Ryan had this whole,
um,

1847
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:07,740
uh,
take on it in sex at dawn,

1848
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:08,593
you know,
and Mckenna had a take on it as well 

1849
01:21:11,270 --> 01:21:14,310
where they were talking about these 
ancient cultures.

1850
01:21:14,311 --> 01:21:17,220
They,
because of these small groups of people,

1851
01:21:17,221 --> 01:21:21,090
they were much closer.
They knew everyone in the community.

1852
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:23,750
It was intensely important and that 
they,

1853
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:24,653
there's a lot of people that think that 
some of the problems that we deal with 

1854
01:21:25,951 --> 01:21:26,784
today in society are because of this 
association that we have with our 

1855
01:21:29,071 --> 01:21:29,904
neighbors.
And we don't have a real sense of 

1856
01:21:31,381 --> 01:21:32,101
community.
I mean,

1857
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:35,640
I know like two or three of my neighbors
and I see them once a year and I say,

1858
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,320
hi wave,
how's everything man?

1859
01:21:37,321 --> 01:21:37,860
Everything cool.

1860
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:38,850
All right,
good seeing Ya.

1861
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:39,720
But that's it.
You know,

1862
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:42,030
there's no real community,
there's no interaction.

1863
01:21:42,031 --> 01:21:44,550
There's no,
there's certainly no contribution as far

1864
01:21:44,551 --> 01:21:47,850
as like working together together,
food or water or anything like that.

1865
01:21:47,851 --> 01:21:49,920
And I would imagine that these people 
were,

1866
01:21:49,921 --> 01:21:51,710
it just intensely close.
Yeah,

1867
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:52,643
absolutely.
I mean that must've been a big part of 

1868
01:21:54,091 --> 01:21:54,924
the attraction to you to them.
Like when they took you in and you were 

1869
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:00,660
living with them and,
yeah,

1870
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:01,523
absolutely.
I mean,

1871
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,310
I think the average my booty pygmy 
village is only 85,

1872
01:22:05,311 --> 01:22:09,990
250 on our 10 villages that we help and 
have the 3000 acres of land.

1873
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:11,670
Um,
it's over 300,

1874
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,320
uh,
for rich each village.

1875
01:22:14,040 --> 01:22:16,080
Um,
do you know about Dunbar's number?

1876
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:20,550
Dunbar's number is a number that,
I mean it varies,

1877
01:22:20,551 --> 01:22:23,070
but the number,
somewhere around one 50 for most people,

1878
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:26,070
there's a number of people that you can 
keep close relationships with.

1879
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:26,933
Oh Wow.
They really only have room for 150 

1880
01:22:28,681 --> 01:22:30,870
people in your head.
You essentially of hard drive space.

1881
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:31,920
Wow.
Yeah.

1882
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:32,783
And that seems to be related to ancient 
tribal communities that people sense 

1883
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,180
that we'd developed that way,
that we develop these,

1884
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:43,950
these small groups of 50 to 150 plus 
people.

1885
01:22:44,020 --> 01:22:45,480
Yeah.
And then when you get larger than that,

1886
01:22:45,481 --> 01:22:46,650
things get weird.
Yeah.

1887
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:47,101
Well,
no,

1888
01:22:47,101 --> 01:22:47,940
that's,
that's so true.

1889
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:48,774
Like I,
whenever I went through the six year 

1890
01:22:51,661 --> 01:22:54,450
battle with oxy and just,
uh,

1891
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,370
narcotics or pain pills,
like I,

1892
01:22:56,371 --> 01:22:57,204
I,
um,

1893
01:22:58,050 --> 01:22:58,883
I don't know.
I would always be able to isolate super 

1894
01:23:01,321 --> 01:23:02,071
easy.
Right.

1895
01:23:02,071 --> 01:23:03,180
Cause as well,
when you're in your home,

1896
01:23:03,181 --> 01:23:04,820
you're completely alone.
Um,

1897
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,010
and so

1898
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,843
it's different when you're in a village 
and with the pygmies you saw some of 

1899
01:23:10,481 --> 01:23:11,350
those huts,
how,

1900
01:23:11,620 --> 01:23:13,280
how small they are.
You know,

1901
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:16,360
seriously in several of them,
whenever I'm sleeping,

1902
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:19,450
I have to sleep in the center and I have
to have my feet out the door.

1903
01:23:19,620 --> 01:23:20,980
Um,
because it's so small.

1904
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,080
Uh,
but it's,

1905
01:23:23,081 --> 01:23:23,914
um,
the only go in there when you're going 

1906
01:23:26,351 --> 01:23:27,184
to sleep or if you're not feeling good 
and you need some rest or the sun's 

1907
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:32,270
right over your head and in your hot.
Um,

1908
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:35,290
but besides that,
you're cooking your kitchens outside.

1909
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:37,570
Um,
that's where the people is.

1910
01:23:37,571 --> 01:23:40,240
That's where you do life is outside of 
your home.

1911
01:23:40,530 --> 01:23:42,010
Uh,
around the campfire.

1912
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:42,873
We call it campfire university because 
that's where we've been taken to school 

1913
01:23:46,150 --> 01:23:47,470
from the,
from the pygmies.

1914
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,271
Uh,
they,

1915
01:23:48,271 --> 01:23:51,460
it's where they teach us the most about 
life is around the campfire,

1916
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:54,580
learning their culture,
learning about their kids,

1917
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:57,850
learning about the hunts,
learning about how they make this,

1918
01:23:57,851 --> 01:23:59,320
make that,
um,

1919
01:23:59,440 --> 01:24:00,970
and it's where you get to do life 
together.

1920
01:24:01,030 --> 01:24:03,730
And so it's something really,
really cool.

1921
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:04,713
Honestly,
I told him they want to know a little 

1922
01:24:06,911 --> 01:24:07,744
bit about my life and I told him that I 
went through drug addiction for six 

1923
01:24:09,971 --> 01:24:10,804
years and you know,
they don't really struggle with that at 

1924
01:24:13,931 --> 01:24:14,621
all.
And,

1925
01:24:14,621 --> 01:24:15,454
uh,
and then I told him I got really 

1926
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:19,000
depressed and I told him,
I really said,

1927
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:20,333
and I told him that I got so sad that I 
decided one time to take as many pills 

1928
01:24:23,711 --> 01:24:26,830
as I could and drink.
Uh,

1929
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:29,110
there's like half a bottle of everclear 
or more.

1930
01:24:29,680 --> 01:24:30,513
Um,
and snorted a bunch of coke and just 

1931
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:33,730
wanted to end it all.
So,

1932
01:24:33,731 --> 01:24:37,130
I mean,
I told him that I was suicidal and um,

1933
01:24:37,450 --> 01:24:38,510
and I,
I,

1934
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,920
I will never forget how they,
how they looked at me almost dumbfounded

1935
01:24:44,710 --> 01:24:46,660
in a way of like,
and then,

1936
01:24:46,690 --> 01:24:49,150
and then one of the questions the chief 
asked me said,

1937
01:24:49,570 --> 01:24:50,830
well,
wouldn't hurting you.

1938
01:24:51,270 --> 01:24:52,960
You're set.
Wouldn't hurting yourself,

1939
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:55,060
only hurt you.
And,

1940
01:24:55,061 --> 01:24:57,940
uh,
so the whole concept of,

1941
01:24:58,540 --> 01:24:59,373
I guess what I'm getting to is they had 
never heard of anyone killing 

1942
01:25:01,331 --> 01:25:02,164
themselves.
Like maybe they had heard stories or 

1943
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,374
something like that,
but they have never known anybody that 

1944
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,530
actually killed themselves or heard of 
it.

1945
01:25:08,740 --> 01:25:10,510
It's not something that they or their 
community,

1946
01:25:10,511 --> 01:25:13,060
their culture,
the pygmies kind of untouched out in the

1947
01:25:13,061 --> 01:25:16,510
forest or even not a up in the city.
It's like,

1948
01:25:16,570 --> 01:25:18,220
that's just something that they don't 
struggle with.

1949
01:25:18,221 --> 01:25:19,054
They're,
they're struggling so much day in and 

1950
01:25:20,530 --> 01:25:21,363
day out with struggles that are so deep 
and they see their family and they do 

1951
01:25:25,061 --> 01:25:28,780
life together.
That I think they just have so much more

1952
01:25:28,781 --> 01:25:29,614
of.
W W we were just talking about so much 

1953
01:25:30,551 --> 01:25:33,460
more of a support system.
People that were rally around them.

1954
01:25:33,550 --> 01:25:37,210
When you lose a family member,
everyone rallies around you.

1955
01:25:37,630 --> 01:25:39,610
Like whenever I go to the funerals,
it's the,

1956
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:40,863
it's the worst thing in the world.
The sounds like people don't try to 

1957
01:25:43,841 --> 01:25:44,674
compose themselves.
They don't try to dress the body real 

1958
01:25:48,071 --> 01:25:53,020
nice and f flowers all around and now,
now losing loss of life is always tough.

1959
01:25:53,021 --> 01:25:55,190
Always terrible.
Um,

1960
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:58,390
but there's something we do here in our 
culture where we make it,

1961
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,610
um,
try to make it as,

1962
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:04,730
as nice or smooth or almost pretty as 
possible.

1963
01:26:04,731 --> 01:26:06,650
You know,
the person's dressed really nice and has

1964
01:26:06,651 --> 01:26:09,230
the flowers and you compose yourself to 
come there.

1965
01:26:09,231 --> 01:26:12,230
You gather yourself,
you prepare the eulogy,

1966
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,480
there's a,
there's a program.

1967
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:17,540
When you step in there,
people get handed something and you know

1968
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:20,450
what's going to happen there.
So you kind of can all compose,

1969
01:26:20,810 --> 01:26:22,310
man,
they are just so ugly.

1970
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:24,590
It's so raw.
It's so real.

1971
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:25,813
And it's so like in your face and it 
just rips your heart open to where 

1972
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:29,950
people are mourning.

1973
01:26:29,950 --> 01:26:31,270
I,
I saw Jayla,

1974
01:26:31,460 --> 01:26:34,640
um,
whenever Babo I was the one,

1975
01:26:34,641 --> 01:26:37,100
me and ben were the ones that told Jayla
while he's the chief.

1976
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,920
Um,
about his grandson passing away.

1977
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,260
We were there when it happened.
He wasn't around,

1978
01:26:42,261 --> 01:26:45,170
he was out collecting or gathering.
Um,

1979
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,273
and we met on the same path together and
he saw it in our face that he knew Baba 

1980
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:51,980
was sick,
but now he knew that he was gone.

1981
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:57,580
And I remember Jay Lodge is falling on 
his back into this,

1982
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:01,010
off the side of the foot path into like 
this pile of brush,

1983
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:02,413
like a,
like,

1984
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:03,553
like probably two,
three foot tall where he like sunk into 

1985
01:27:05,601 --> 01:27:08,090
it and he was just squirming on his 
back,

1986
01:27:08,091 --> 01:27:08,924
you know,
he's like in his sixties and he's 

1987
01:27:10,191 --> 01:27:11,024
watched so many of his grandchildren 
like pass just because they don't have 

1988
01:27:14,391 --> 01:27:15,224
clean water and seeing them squirming,
almost wanting to like crawl out of his 

1989
01:27:17,781 --> 01:27:18,890
skin,
you know?

1990
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:20,900
Um,
and so,

1991
01:27:20,901 --> 01:27:24,080
but I don't know.
I don't want to be a bummer.

1992
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:24,500
I,
I'm,

1993
01:27:24,500 --> 01:27:25,333
I'm just,
uh,

1994
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:26,950
just express yourself.
It's,

1995
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:30,470
it's,
but then how the whole community,

1996
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,970
all hundred and 50,
200,

1997
01:27:31,971 --> 01:27:34,240
300 people that were there,
uh,

1998
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,340
all mourned together.
Like we shared it.

1999
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,620
Like I,
I cried in a way that was like,

2000
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:41,470
you know,
like,

2001
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:42,303
like,
like wiping my tears with everybody 

2002
01:27:43,851 --> 01:27:47,330
because everyone,
everyone was morning,

2003
01:27:47,331 --> 01:27:49,490
everyone was crying.
It wasn't just a few people.

2004
01:27:49,491 --> 01:27:51,950
It wasn't just his mom and his dad,
his mom,

2005
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:56,951
macho w it wasn't just j Lajuan,
it was the whole village cried together.

2006
01:27:58,670 --> 01:28:00,020
And so,
I don't know,

2007
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:00,854
but for me,
that,

2008
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:05,210
that makes it seem like,
I don't know if this,

2009
01:28:05,211 --> 01:28:06,044
I don't want to make too many 
connections between our culture because 

2010
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:10,100
they're completely different or a lot 
different.

2011
01:28:10,101 --> 01:28:14,810
But I think here a huge cause of divorce
is the loss of a child.

2012
01:28:15,410 --> 01:28:17,960
Um,
but there,

2013
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:22,100
it's almost unites the parents.
Um,

2014
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:25,760
so much so whenever they lose a little 
one.

2015
01:28:25,790 --> 01:28:27,500
And I don't,
I don't mean to make this comparison,

2016
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:30,170
but it's like,
I think it's because when they mourn,

2017
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:31,333
they truly go to the depths of the 
darkest place and they're able to truly 

2018
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:38,870
almost get it out,
if that makes sense.

2019
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:42,770
Where when you're at the funeral,
you let yourself go.

2020
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:45,980
You just let go and,
and,

2021
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:48,920
and it's okay.
However ugly or however you handle it,

2022
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,710
whatever emotions come,
you just ride that wave,

2023
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:52,573
if that makes sense.
Do you think that because their life is 

2024
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:55,963
so difficult,
that life itself becomes more precious 

2025
01:28:58,521 --> 01:29:01,500
and the loss becomes more powerful or 
more intense?

2026
01:29:01,501 --> 01:29:02,130
More,

2027
01:29:02,130 --> 01:29:02,963
more raw?

2028
01:29:03,050 --> 01:29:04,730
Wow.
Yeah.

2029
01:29:04,731 --> 01:29:07,700
I needed you to,
to sum that up for sure.

2030
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:10,250
Um,
yes I do.

2031
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:13,190
I think whenever you struggle so much 
your,

2032
01:29:13,191 --> 01:29:14,024
you become so much more appreciative and
grateful of life of every breath you 

2033
01:29:17,001 --> 01:29:18,570
take.
Um,

2034
01:29:19,940 --> 01:29:20,773
well that's kind of,
yeah,

2035
01:29:20,780 --> 01:29:23,960
connected to their lack of understanding
of suicide because our,

2036
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,380
you know,
our idea of what a difficult life is,

2037
01:29:27,770 --> 01:29:32,120
it's difficult,
but there's food and shelter and this,

2038
01:29:32,180 --> 01:29:33,013
you know,
and really the easiest place to live in 

2039
01:29:34,761 --> 01:29:36,950
the world,
all those things connected.

2040
01:29:38,180 --> 01:29:39,380
Whereas with them

2041
01:29:40,090 --> 01:29:44,860
just staying alive is such a struggle.
And getting water,

2042
01:29:44,861 --> 01:29:46,420
which is so easy for us all,
we,

2043
01:29:46,421 --> 01:29:49,000
anybody can walk into any bathroom and 
any gas stop,

2044
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,860
turn the water on,
water comes out.

2045
01:29:50,861 --> 01:29:51,694
I mean,
everybody waters on hard to get in 

2046
01:29:52,421 --> 01:29:54,430
America.
And even with the droughts,

2047
01:29:54,431 --> 01:29:55,264
it's easy to get water.
We water fucking golf courses with 

2048
01:29:57,521 --> 01:29:59,430
millions of gallons of water every day.
Yeah.

2049
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:03,490
Our understanding of what a struggle is 
is so different.

2050
01:30:04,060 --> 01:30:05,560
Yeah.
And I think whenever we,

2051
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:08,740
when we've really struggled here,
we can go hide away and we don't have to

2052
01:30:08,741 --> 01:30:09,574
deal with it.
Now I have to have conversations about 

2053
01:30:10,841 --> 01:30:12,100
it.
Um,

2054
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:15,310
we can,
we can almost escape it.

2055
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,620
We can escape it with our,
with our toys,

2056
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:19,000
with our technology,
you know,

2057
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:19,834
we can,
we can just bury our face in our phone 

2058
01:30:21,281 --> 01:30:23,740
or a computer or sit and watch a movie.
And like,

2059
01:30:23,741 --> 01:30:26,020
whenever those uncomfortable feelings 
come up,

2060
01:30:26,410 --> 01:30:30,580
we can try to ignore them or suppress 
them,

2061
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,980
if that makes sense.
And they're there.

2062
01:30:32,981 --> 01:30:35,080
So it's almost,
man,

2063
01:30:35,081 --> 01:30:38,740
this is going to be a weird,
strange curve ball or left turn.

2064
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:39,963
But it's almost like a,
I've started floating recently and 

2065
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:44,230
whenever I go in there,
um,

2066
01:30:44,470 --> 01:30:46,270
into the tank,
it's like you have to,

2067
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,820
you're,
you're left alone to your thoughts,

2068
01:30:48,821 --> 01:30:50,350
right?
You don't have that technology.

2069
01:30:50,350 --> 01:30:51,183
You don't have this.
And so you can deal with stuff and you 

2070
01:30:53,531 --> 01:30:57,790
can try to focus and let go.
And for me it's been really beneficial.

2071
01:30:57,820 --> 01:30:58,653
And so I don't,
I know that sounds weird for me to make 

2072
01:31:00,881 --> 01:31:02,170
that connection,
but uh,

2073
01:31:02,800 --> 01:31:06,010
but whenever you're just left alone with
your own thoughts,

2074
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:09,580
you can go deep.
And I feel like our culture here,

2075
01:31:09,880 --> 01:31:10,713
well,
okay,

2076
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,660
if we compare,
and I love our culture,

2077
01:31:13,661 --> 01:31:14,494
there's,
I'm not saying there's so much wrong 

2078
01:31:15,131 --> 01:31:15,964
with it,
but uh,

2079
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:19,390
but I feel like they're in 
relationships.

2080
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:23,050
You go an inch or two wide and you go a 
mile deep in the Congo,

2081
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:28,030
you get to know people and then hear,
a lot of times you go a mile wide,

2082
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:30,910
but you go only,
you only scratched the surface.

2083
01:31:30,911 --> 01:31:33,040
You don't go beneath the top soil that 
much.

2084
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:34,900
Um,
so you do sometimes with,

2085
01:31:34,901 --> 01:31:36,580
with a few people,
um,

2086
01:31:36,640 --> 01:31:38,980
there's only few people that we trust 
with that,

2087
01:31:38,981 --> 01:31:40,840
you know,
but it's almost like they're,

2088
01:31:40,841 --> 01:31:43,990
everyone's so open to,
um,

2089
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,260
to go in deep with one another.
And because of that,

2090
01:31:47,261 --> 01:31:50,770
you get to know each other better.
You get to a truly hurt when they hurt,

2091
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,970
you get to laugh.
When they laugh,

2092
01:31:51,971 --> 01:31:54,280
you get to cry when they cry.
Um,

2093
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:57,640
and I may not,
I don't have to keep going on about it,

2094
01:31:57,641 --> 01:32:00,070
but no,
please to don't apologize.

2095
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:01,860
There's a real,
um,

2096
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:03,033
there's a real argument for the,
the way that we live right now is not a 

2097
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:07,354
way that we were designed for.
Meaning that not that it can't be 

2098
01:32:09,941 --> 01:32:10,774
sustainable,
are manageable and you can't figure out 

2099
01:32:12,161 --> 01:32:15,250
a way to live a harmonious life in the 
modern context,

2100
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:18,130
but that a lot of people think that 
we're just,

2101
01:32:18,310 --> 01:32:19,143
we would naturally fit right in,
in a tribal environment that it would 

2102
01:32:21,881 --> 01:32:24,760
feel natural.
And a lot of people experience that when

2103
01:32:24,761 --> 01:32:25,594
they go camping for long stretches of 
time when they're out in the woods 

2104
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:28,721
together.
You know,

2105
01:32:28,721 --> 01:32:29,554
for whatever reason,
they just decided to find a place and 

2106
01:32:32,411 --> 01:32:33,400
live off the land.
I mean,

2107
01:32:33,401 --> 01:32:35,860
that's why I think a lot of those shows 
like those,

2108
01:32:35,861 --> 01:32:38,650
um,
subsistence living shows like,

2109
01:32:38,651 --> 01:32:39,484
um,
the,

2110
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:41,010
those homesteading.
Yeah.

2111
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,200
Yeah,
that's very,

2112
01:32:42,640 --> 01:32:46,800
it's a very attractive to people because
I think there's a longing in our,

2113
01:32:46,801 --> 01:32:51,430
our DNA eve and where it just,
there's a pole.

2114
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:54,670
There's a pull to that man.
I would love to just grow Kale and raise

2115
01:32:54,671 --> 01:32:55,504
chickens and live off the phone.
It's a lot of people that feel like 

2116
01:32:58,450 --> 01:32:59,283
really,
really attracted to that and I think 

2117
01:33:00,371 --> 01:33:01,204
it's,
it's something deep in our being that 

2118
01:33:03,041 --> 01:33:03,874
we're longing for this connection to the
real world and we've done an amazing 

2119
01:33:07,661 --> 01:33:10,540
thing creating cities.
It's dependence.

2120
01:33:10,541 --> 01:33:11,374
It's,
it's almost beyond our comprehension 

2121
01:33:14,501 --> 01:33:15,820
because we're a part of it.
You know,

2122
01:33:15,821 --> 01:33:17,140
we're a part of it.
It's normal.

2123
01:33:17,141 --> 01:33:19,030
You get on the subway,
you get your car,

2124
01:33:19,031 --> 01:33:21,340
you drive through the city.
It seems normal,

2125
01:33:21,730 --> 01:33:26,730
but it's so far removed from every 
single aspect of our history.

2126
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:28,810
I mean,
this is so new.

2127
01:33:28,811 --> 01:33:29,644
It's so recent.
I think these people are just more in 

2128
01:33:34,211 --> 01:33:35,044
tune.
I,

2129
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:38,050
it's horrible that they have to deal 
with these situations,

2130
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:43,051
like the lack of water and toilets and 
the diseases and all the other struggle.

2131
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:46,600
But man,
there's a part of what they're doing and

2132
01:33:46,601 --> 01:33:47,434
the way they're living that just seems 
like they're more in tune in a natural 

2133
01:33:51,311 --> 01:33:52,150
way.
Right.

2134
01:33:52,151 --> 01:33:56,410
You would think that they would be more 
depressed and uh,

2135
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:58,600
but,
but like you heard,

2136
01:33:58,630 --> 01:33:59,463
you heard Leo may's laughing that when 
they asked him about the bananas and he 

2137
01:34:01,941 --> 01:34:02,830
just got tickled,
you know,

2138
01:34:02,831 --> 01:34:04,780
he couldn't,
couldn't hold himself from just laughing

2139
01:34:04,781 --> 01:34:06,160
and saying,
I can't count that much.

2140
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:08,560
Test someone from Beverly Hills and say,
Hey,

2141
01:34:08,561 --> 01:34:11,020
this is what we got for a cause.
You can grow bananas now.

2142
01:34:11,040 --> 01:34:11,980
They were like,
fuck you.

2143
01:34:12,550 --> 01:34:14,830
How do I get Outta here?
Firstclass only you know,

2144
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:17,380
where's my iphone?
Yeah.

2145
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,440
It's weird.
It's weird band because essentially this

2146
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:23,170
life is temporary ride for all of us 
involved.

2147
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:25,390
No one has ever got out of this thing 
alive.

2148
01:34:25,420 --> 01:34:26,800
No one,
no one will.

2149
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:27,760
It's not going to be you.

2150
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:29,860
It's not going to be me.
We're not gonna make it.

2151
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:31,690
No one makes it.
No one's ever made it before.

2152
01:34:31,720 --> 01:34:33,670
No one's ever going to make it.
So it's essentially like,

2153
01:34:33,970 --> 01:34:36,680
what is the quality of your experience 
while you're here and how much people,

2154
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:39,700
how many people are you touching?
And by that life,

2155
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:40,833
by that definition,
you've lived one of the richest lives 

2156
01:34:43,030 --> 01:34:45,550
that a person could ever live.
Thank you.

2157
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:49,900
Do you realize that every time brown yet
feel like a piece of shit?

2158
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:50,763
No,
I don't want anyone to feel that way at 

2159
01:34:52,031 --> 01:34:52,950
all.
Really.

2160
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:53,923
That,
but then the way you're so selfless in 

2161
01:34:56,531 --> 01:34:57,440
that regard.
Well,

2162
01:34:57,441 --> 01:34:58,280
I,
I just,

2163
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:01,730
okay,
if I just connect it back to that.

2164
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:04,430
I remember little gimpy,
he got about 10,

2165
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:07,490
he's chief of condos,
grandson,

2166
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:08,433
um,
chiefly omaze brother is chief Alondo 

2167
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:13,100
and his grandson,
chippy,

2168
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:16,310
uh,
had gotten paid basically 10,

2169
01:35:16,311 --> 01:35:17,990
12,
maximum,

2170
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:21,470
probably 14 or 15 peanuts.
He worked all day long.

2171
01:35:21,620 --> 01:35:25,790
He's a five or six year old child that 
worked from sunup to sundown.

2172
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:29,420
And that's what he got paid was five or 
up to 15,

2173
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:30,920
uh,
peanuts.

2174
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,620
And so a little handful in his little 
hand.

2175
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,820
And he came and he sat by me and I just 
kind of put my arm around him and said,

2176
01:35:37,821 --> 01:35:38,654
how are you doing?
And he just instantly like put his hand 

2177
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:44,010
out for me to have in like,
he,

2178
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,390
he went like this and he got like half 
for him and got half for me and just put

2179
01:35:47,391 --> 01:35:48,710
half of his peanuts in my hand.

2180
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:51,200
And like,
you just worked all day long for that,

2181
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:53,330
you know,
like from sunup to sundown.

2182
01:35:53,331 --> 01:35:56,290
But they're just so incredibly generous,
you know,

2183
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,370
hey,
what's mine is yours and what's yours?

2184
01:35:58,460 --> 01:35:59,293
I mean,
like,

2185
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:03,380
it's fun to kind of sit around the fire 
sometimes and eat because,

2186
01:36:03,381 --> 01:36:04,670
uh,
I mean it's,

2187
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:06,650
it's rude and our culture and everything
else,

2188
01:36:06,651 --> 01:36:07,484
but,
uh,

2189
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:08,413
but I just,
I just enjoyed it whenever people would 

2190
01:36:09,861 --> 01:36:13,180
start eating off my plate and how to eat
off of their plate and it just kind of,

2191
01:36:13,181 --> 01:36:14,530
because it's part of it.
Yeah.

2192
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:15,753
Yeah.
Or there's just a kind of a pile in the 

2193
01:36:17,511 --> 01:36:19,130
middle or big plate,
big thing.

2194
01:36:19,131 --> 01:36:19,964
And it's like,
Hey,

2195
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:21,640
this is what we have.
Let's,

2196
01:36:21,641 --> 01:36:22,474
uh,
let's share.

2197
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:23,210
Let's,
uh,

2198
01:36:23,210 --> 01:36:24,800
let's make sure we share everything 
together.

2199
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:26,660
Now,
some eight B,

2200
01:36:27,020 --> 01:36:27,853
sorry to interrupt you.
But besides the farming and besides the 

2201
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:31,400
clean water,
what other,

2202
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:34,100
what other changes have you witnessed?

2203
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:35,900
Okay,
so [inaudible] um,

2204
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:38,600
which is so cool.
He's like my little buddy yet getting to

2205
01:36:38,601 --> 01:36:40,520
watch him grow up and he's going to be 
chief one day.

2206
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:44,630
And uh,
so we just got determined that like that

2207
01:36:44,631 --> 01:36:45,464
young yeah.
Was his father had passed away and he 

2208
01:36:46,671 --> 01:36:48,310
would have become the chief.
But uh,

2209
01:36:48,710 --> 01:36:50,450
she signed under the chief and who's 
not,

2210
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:51,950
it's not an election process or 
anything.

2211
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:56,300
Basically there is a,
just among the village,

2212
01:36:56,450 --> 01:36:57,283
whenever I think I forget,
I need to ask chief Alondo how he got 

2213
01:37:00,561 --> 01:37:01,394
kind of voted in or whatever.
But he was just the one that showed the 

2214
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:05,720
leadership qualities,
the one that everyone followed.

2215
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,850
Uh,
the one that was most respected,

2216
01:37:07,851 --> 01:37:10,820
the one that was kind of the most 
knowledgeable or caring.

2217
01:37:10,821 --> 01:37:11,654
That's a huge thing for them.
Who's going to think about our interest 

2218
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:14,743
the most and um,
and then be strong enough to like be 

2219
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:19,250
tough whenever it needs to be tough.

2220
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:22,580
And so chief Solano,
he's got incredible leadership skills.

2221
01:37:22,700 --> 01:37:24,770
Um,
like just a great guy.

2222
01:37:24,771 --> 01:37:25,604
He was one of the first ones that bought
into the vision for us to come in with 

2223
01:37:28,201 --> 01:37:29,210
the land,
water and food.

2224
01:37:29,540 --> 01:37:31,160
A lot of people didn't trust us 
thinking,

2225
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:32,090
oh,
they're saying this.

2226
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:34,820
And they have those tools that look like
they're going to drill wells,

2227
01:37:34,821 --> 01:37:39,080
but really they might be serving for 
gold or diamonds or Colton who knows,

2228
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:39,914
there just maybe using this as a cover.
But he was one that stood up in the 

2229
01:37:42,591 --> 01:37:43,730
community and I was like,
no,

2230
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:46,190
we believe them.
We're going to work with them.

2231
01:37:46,550 --> 01:37:47,383
And so from that he's been able to go 
out and tell other communities what's 

2232
01:37:51,231 --> 01:37:52,064
happened in their village.
And so one of the things that he's able 

2233
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:56,280
to go do is say,
how has changed everything to where they

2234
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:59,670
were able to get land to secure that so 
we could come in and drill the wells for

2235
01:37:59,671 --> 01:38:00,060
them.

2236
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:00,893
Then after that they're able to start 
farming and then you saw them going and 

2237
01:38:02,731 --> 01:38:05,670
selling it at the markets to where they 
can buy clothes for their kids.

2238
01:38:06,090 --> 01:38:07,320
Well,
it's not just about clothes.

2239
01:38:07,410 --> 01:38:08,243
Um,
little gimpy last time I was there 

2240
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:11,650
getting ready to leave,
um,

2241
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:12,503
he's always around and I had just been 
able to get for the weekend and I was 

2242
01:38:15,811 --> 01:38:17,370
only being able to stay there for three 
days,

2243
01:38:17,380 --> 01:38:20,100
this trip in that village,
cause we're going to some other places,

2244
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:21,413
but I always stop and see him.
And so we're leaving and I don't get to 

2245
01:38:24,091 --> 01:38:26,420
see kind of like my little buddy and I'm
like,

2246
01:38:26,421 --> 01:38:27,450
where's,
where's gyp yet?

2247
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:28,141
And like,
Oh,

2248
01:38:28,141 --> 01:38:28,974
you'll see them as you go.
And so we got in the truck and we start 

2249
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:31,854
driving out and all of a sudden little 
gimpy comes out of the schoolhouse and 

2250
01:38:34,651 --> 01:38:38,100
he's running to us and I got to get out 
and give them a hug,

2251
01:38:38,101 --> 01:38:38,934
tell him bye.

2252
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:39,953
Um,
but what's so huge is he was the first 

2253
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:45,210
my booty pygmy ever in school,
in that region,

2254
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:50,240
that area that they know of.
And so from kind of getting a little bit

2255
01:38:50,761 --> 01:38:51,594
more equal rights,
but then also being able to pay for 

2256
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:54,950
themselves.
Uh,

2257
01:38:55,260 --> 01:38:56,093
you know,
they're supposed to be a government 

2258
01:38:56,641 --> 01:39:00,090
program where the pygmies can go to 
school and go for free,

2259
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:01,103
but they're like the only ones,
they're kind of like the native 

2260
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:03,360
Americans of,
of,

2261
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:04,790
of Congo.
Um,

2262
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:05,643
they have basically zero rights,
but that's one that the government has 

2263
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:09,150
said,
but normally it's not honored.

2264
01:39:09,240 --> 01:39:10,960
And secondly,
um,

2265
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:15,540
they don't go to school if they need to 
be spending time hunting or gathering.

2266
01:39:15,630 --> 01:39:16,463
Cause you know,
kids going to sit in school while he's 

2267
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:19,110
hungry,
he's not to be able to focus.

2268
01:39:19,190 --> 01:39:20,023
Right.
So for him to be able to have food to 

2269
01:39:21,511 --> 01:39:22,344
take to school is a huge thing so that 
he can sit there for them to be able to 

2270
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:26,280
pay the school fees on their own.

2271
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:28,050
They didn't take that.
They said,

2272
01:39:28,051 --> 01:39:28,884
no,
we don't want the government program 

2273
01:39:29,651 --> 01:39:32,430
saying we can come to school for free.
We're going to pay his school fees.

2274
01:39:32,760 --> 01:39:34,950
He's going to be chief one day.
We're investing into him.

2275
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:38,130
And so to,
to know that once,

2276
01:39:38,131 --> 01:39:38,964
once there's some educated my booty 
pygmies that takes away the last excuse 

2277
01:39:42,361 --> 01:39:43,194
that I see for the government to not 
honor them as true citizens of the 

2278
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:48,120
country.
Um,

2279
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:50,760
they have no representation on the 
government level.

2280
01:39:50,820 --> 01:39:53,430
Zero,
but there's over 200 tribes there.

2281
01:39:53,460 --> 01:39:55,620
All of them have representation.
But,

2282
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:57,420
uh,
for years it was because,

2283
01:39:57,630 --> 01:39:59,550
or for always it was because they 
thought they were half man,

2284
01:39:59,551 --> 01:40:00,690
half animal.
Well,

2285
01:40:00,691 --> 01:40:02,160
now it's,
um,

2286
01:40:02,280 --> 01:40:03,113
it's because they say no one's educated.
No one's ever graduated from primary 

2287
01:40:06,211 --> 01:40:07,044
school or secondary school and no one's 
ever graduated with a high school 

2288
01:40:09,601 --> 01:40:11,790
degree.
And so until that happens,

2289
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:14,940
no booty pygmy me or they don't have 
representation.

2290
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:17,190
So we're hoping that as they get 
schooling,

2291
01:40:17,250 --> 01:40:18,083
there'll be able to go to the courts and
represent themselves and have more 

2292
01:40:19,891 --> 01:40:23,310
rights in their community and culture.
I don't know if I've ever told you that,

2293
01:40:23,311 --> 01:40:28,311
but I'm a real dark part of the,
the pygmy history,

2294
01:40:28,471 --> 01:40:31,050
uh,
or Congolese history and what we,

2295
01:40:31,110 --> 01:40:31,943
what people have done to them,
what we have done to them at 1902 to 

2296
01:40:34,681 --> 01:40:36,110
1906,
uh,

2297
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:36,561
we had,
um,

2298
01:40:36,561 --> 01:40:38,580
a booty pygmy from night taree rain 
forest,

2299
01:40:38,581 --> 01:40:41,130
right where I've lived in state and we 
put them in the zoo.

2300
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,970
Did I say that?
Maybe we didn't talk it was talked about

2301
01:40:44,971 --> 01:40:46,080
it on the podcast,
but yeah,

2302
01:40:46,081 --> 01:40:47,470
it's horrific.
Yeah.

2303
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:48,353
It seems Ota Benga and we literally fed 
them bananas in the Monkey House at the 

2304
01:40:52,771 --> 01:40:55,390
Bronx in New York.
So we threw him bananas,

2305
01:40:55,391 --> 01:40:59,830
why he lived there with the monkeys and 
a Christ in a human being like that.

2306
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:00,940
And so,
uh,

2307
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:02,800
you know,
that was a over a hundred years ago,

2308
01:41:02,801 --> 01:41:03,634
but it's almost like in those regions 
where they don't have land or wa are 

2309
01:41:06,581 --> 01:41:07,414
sorry,
they don't have running water and 

2310
01:41:07,771 --> 01:41:10,690
electricity and a lot of education that 
we do here,

2311
01:41:10,691 --> 01:41:11,524
some places are kind of stuck in this 
pocket that's kind of about a hundred 

2312
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:15,970
years back.
Um,

2313
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:18,130
and so some of that mentality still 
exist.

2314
01:41:18,460 --> 01:41:22,990
So this could be the beginning steps and
just completely changing their culture,

2315
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,540
educating.
That's what we were seeing,

2316
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,910
having,
having the chief come out and say,

2317
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:28,803
this is the first official ever land in 
the booty pygmies own and our 

2318
01:41:32,321 --> 01:41:34,180
government's history.
This is the first water,

2319
01:41:34,181 --> 01:41:35,014
well clean water source ever among them 
a booty pygmies that they've ever owned 

2320
01:41:38,590 --> 01:41:39,423
first time they're ever farming for 
themselves and going to the market and 

2321
01:41:41,411 --> 01:41:44,800
selling it that had local radio station.
Um,

2322
01:41:44,830 --> 01:41:48,190
there's only like one,
and it's the reinforce a few hours away,

2323
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:50,500
but they came out to the market to do a 
story,

2324
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:51,743
uh,
with chiefly among them because they 

2325
01:41:53,081 --> 01:41:55,240
were actually selling their produce and 
they're like,

2326
01:41:55,241 --> 01:41:55,550
what?

2327
01:41:55,550 --> 01:41:57,670
The pygmies have always been hunter 
gatherers.

2328
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,533
Well,
the deforestation has made it basically 

2329
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:00,184
impossible for them to completely 
sustain themselves off hunting and 

2330
01:42:02,681 --> 01:42:04,960
gathering.
Animals are scared and skittish and they

2331
01:42:04,961 --> 01:42:05,794
run away from the trees that when they 
fall sound like thunder going through 

2332
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:10,760
the forest.
So it makes it really hard to,

2333
01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:12,940
to go hunt,
um,

2334
01:42:13,480 --> 01:42:15,760
and be able to feed a whole tribe,
a whole village.

2335
01:42:16,570 --> 01:42:17,403
And so,
uh,

2336
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,400
yeah,
to be able to say,

2337
01:42:18,401 --> 01:42:19,234
these are,
this is the first time they're farming 

2338
01:42:20,321 --> 01:42:21,460
and selling this,
you know,

2339
01:42:21,461 --> 01:42:24,250
it just,
they're getting more and more,

2340
01:42:24,520 --> 01:42:25,251
I don't know.
It's like they're,

2341
01:42:25,251 --> 01:42:29,130
they're catching up with the people 
around them and we want them to do it as

2342
01:42:29,131 --> 01:42:29,964
slow pace that they want.
So keep everything culturally sound for 

2343
01:42:33,011 --> 01:42:33,844
them,
but what they do want to bring into 

2344
01:42:35,051 --> 01:42:37,150
their culture,
we want to rally behind that.

2345
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:40,240
Wow.
That's powerful dude.

2346
01:42:40,241 --> 01:42:42,470
You're,
you're there at the,

2347
01:42:42,471 --> 01:42:45,460
the steps of their culture changing.
I mean,

2348
01:42:45,461 --> 01:42:46,630
you're,
you're right there.

2349
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:47,860
Well,
it's been,

2350
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:48,693
it's been changing or,
or it's been corrupted so much because 

2351
01:42:52,301 --> 01:42:53,134
of,
because of outside influences coming in 

2352
01:42:55,001 --> 01:42:56,470
with the,
the chain saws,

2353
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:57,304
you know,
that are mechanized ones where they can 

2354
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:02,980
just start cutting the trees down at 
such a crazy rate.

2355
01:43:03,140 --> 01:43:03,973
Yeah.
I've seen those monster machines a 

2356
01:43:04,811 --> 01:43:06,190
terrifying,
absolutely.

2357
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:09,190
Stripped the bark off of it all in one 
movement and cut it down.

2358
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,780
Isn't that nuts?
Some of those.

2359
01:43:10,840 --> 01:43:12,130
It's scary.
Yeah,

2360
01:43:12,240 --> 01:43:14,320
I can get,
it's like science fiction movie stuff.

2361
01:43:15,420 --> 01:43:16,253
Yeah.
So they have that because there's a lot 

2362
01:43:18,251 --> 01:43:19,840
of,
it's not as advanced as that,

2363
01:43:19,841 --> 01:43:20,674
but um,
they have guys just constantly day in 

2364
01:43:24,281 --> 01:43:26,320
and day out that it's almost like,
uh,

2365
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,030
aunts following each other through the 
forest,

2366
01:43:28,031 --> 01:43:31,180
but they have bicycles and they throw 
these long,

2367
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:35,050
20 foot planks of a Mahogany or I think 
it's a,

2368
01:43:35,051 --> 01:43:37,390
isn't it ebony that,
that other really heavy,

2369
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:38,433
uh,
hardwood and they're just taking those 

2370
01:43:40,301 --> 01:43:41,830
out of the forest all day long.

2371
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:43,350
Uh,
just in lines,

2372
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,750
there's a line of people going with 
empty bicycles and there's a line coming

2373
01:43:46,751 --> 01:43:47,584
back out with it full of wood and they 
just start legally deforesting putting 

2374
01:43:50,681 --> 01:43:51,514
it in the,
of these 18 wheelers that normally have 

2375
01:43:53,661 --> 01:43:54,494
two trailers on the back of them,
or two containers on the back and they 

2376
01:43:58,131 --> 01:43:58,964
fill them to the top.
And that's where a lot of the bridges 

2377
01:44:01,461 --> 01:44:03,710
collapse because they're going over,
they're overloaded.

2378
01:44:04,040 --> 01:44:06,050
I have a picture of that.
And it was a wild,

2379
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:09,830
wild time where we got behind this,
uh,

2380
01:44:09,950 --> 01:44:10,783
this Lori that was ahead of us and we 
didn't see it collapse or anything like 

2381
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:13,491
that,
but,

2382
01:44:13,491 --> 01:44:14,324
uh,
but we knew that they were carrying way 

2383
01:44:16,131 --> 01:44:18,980
too much weight to cross the bridges 
that we had crossed earlier.

2384
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:20,120
And so we knew,
Oh man,

2385
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:24,140
I hope that bridge is still is still up 
and running by the time we get back.

2386
01:44:24,670 --> 01:44:27,860
Um,
and then it just completely caved in and

2387
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:28,850
crashed.
Wow.

2388
01:44:28,950 --> 01:44:31,310
That bridge,
that bridge is ridiculous.

2389
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:32,203
Yeah.
And so that was built and how do they 

2390
01:44:33,231 --> 01:44:34,064
get across that?
They drove across that they were 

2391
01:44:36,381 --> 01:44:37,380
driving.
That was,

2392
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:39,290
that was the bridge.
Yeah.

2393
01:44:39,291 --> 01:44:40,124
Wooden planks.
And that's what we would drive across 

2394
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:43,970
all the time to go out and drill our 
wells and stuff.

2395
01:44:44,570 --> 01:44:45,403
But the guys legally logging and 
carrying way too much weight legally 

2396
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:51,890
illegally locked.
Yeah.

2397
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,390
Yeah.
I thought you were saying legally,

2398
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:54,040
no,
sorry.

2399
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:55,090
Illegally.
Uh,

2400
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,550
and so what kind of reinforcement that 
they have in their laws,

2401
01:44:58,551 --> 01:45:00,490
like the deforestation laws,
uh,

2402
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:02,450
basically nothing.
I mean,

2403
01:45:02,451 --> 01:45:03,650
they say it's illegal,
but,

2404
01:45:03,770 --> 01:45:04,603
but everybody does.
It turns a blind eye because they're 

2405
01:45:06,051 --> 01:45:06,884
getting paid asset bribes.
But there's a lot of money involved in 

2406
01:45:09,621 --> 01:45:10,820
hardwood.
Oh yeah.

2407
01:45:11,120 --> 01:45:11,953
Especially those rare African hardwoods.
And that's where the rubber boom 

2408
01:45:15,650 --> 01:45:19,010
basically started was Congo by the 
Belgiums King Leopold.

2409
01:45:19,010 --> 01:45:19,843
The second he wrote a crazy,
or there's a crazy book written about 

2410
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:22,904
him.
King Leopold's ghost talks about how 

2411
01:45:24,411 --> 01:45:25,244
that was the African Holocaust and 
basically that Congo had 20 million in 

2412
01:45:28,581 --> 01:45:29,414
population,
but eight to 10 million people were 

2413
01:45:31,701 --> 01:45:35,450
killed throughout the Belgians coming 
and colonizing the Congo.

2414
01:45:35,970 --> 01:45:36,651
Um,
and he,

2415
01:45:36,651 --> 01:45:37,484
he paraded around like he was the hero 
of Congo and we're bringing 

2416
01:45:41,180 --> 01:45:42,013
infrastructure and business and they're 
getting rich and they're growing and 

2417
01:45:45,021 --> 01:45:48,440
they're getting water and buildings and 
they're advancing so much.

2418
01:45:48,950 --> 01:45:49,783
And he would go on these public 
campaigns basically talking about all 

2419
01:45:52,281 --> 01:45:55,000
the good they're doing in the Congo,
but basically a,

2420
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:58,550
you can see these terrible brutal 
pictures of basically a father,

2421
01:45:58,551 --> 01:46:03,551
I think reaching out to his child's hand
that's on the ground because they took a

2422
01:46:04,101 --> 01:46:04,934
machete and cut his kid's hand off and 
he's reaching out to grab it and he 

2423
01:46:07,911 --> 01:46:10,850
doesn't have hands because they had 
already cut his hands off too.

2424
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:13,430
And so it's just been,
since,

2425
01:46:14,720 --> 01:46:16,790
it's just been brutal.
They're always,

2426
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:19,280
because they had the,
it was the rubber and ivory boom,

2427
01:46:19,460 --> 01:46:22,430
and then after that,
now it's the rare hardwoods,

2428
01:46:22,431 --> 01:46:24,200
the gold,
the coal tan,

2429
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:25,093
the uranium,
which they used to make cell phones 

2430
01:46:26,691 --> 01:46:27,410
with.
Yup.

2431
01:46:27,410 --> 01:46:29,510
It conducts electricity that really high
rate,

2432
01:46:29,511 --> 01:46:32,180
but it stays cool so it doesn't overheat
her blow up on you.

2433
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:33,853
And I think 80% of the world's Coltan 
and it comes from the Congo and 

2434
01:46:36,231 --> 01:46:40,700
basically all of its illegal mining by 
rebels and everything else.

2435
01:46:40,790 --> 01:46:41,623
Yeah.
That's the dirty secret about people's 

2436
01:46:43,011 --> 01:46:45,200
phones and a lot of the electronics that
we use.

2437
01:46:45,260 --> 01:46:48,650
Yeah.
Yeah man.

2438
01:46:48,651 --> 01:46:50,130
It's a,
but it's been,

2439
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,410
it's been an incredible journey to be 
part of tis.

2440
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:56,280
I couldn't have dreamed this like 
wouldn't have,

2441
01:46:56,970 --> 01:47:00,660
I wouldn't have thought it up or it 
didn't have it on my goals list,

2442
01:47:00,720 --> 01:47:03,450
didn't have it on my radar as a kid.
You're so perfect for it.

2443
01:47:03,451 --> 01:47:04,284
That's what's so crazy.
It seems like it's kind of changed you 

2444
01:47:05,851 --> 01:47:08,250
as a human being without and solidified 
you.

2445
01:47:08,330 --> 01:47:09,163
Yeah.
And a lot of ways I think conviction 

2446
01:47:10,921 --> 01:47:13,380
that you fight with,
it's not just that of a competitor.

2447
01:47:13,381 --> 01:47:18,300
It's like a man with a,
not even just a goal,

2448
01:47:18,301 --> 01:47:20,640
like a destiny.
It's a very strange,

2449
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:21,901
you know,
you're,

2450
01:47:21,901 --> 01:47:26,430
you're doing something that's bigger 
than most people can even comprehend.

2451
01:47:26,431 --> 01:47:29,730
And I feel like the weight of that is 
pushing you forward.

2452
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:31,021
And this,
uh,

2453
01:47:31,021 --> 01:47:34,960
this really incredible way to watch.
I don't know anybody like human,

2454
01:47:35,690 --> 01:47:37,820
the only guy I know,
like you,

2455
01:47:38,390 --> 01:47:39,120
you're the only guy I know.

2456
01:47:39,120 --> 01:47:40,290
Like you,
my friend.

2457
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:41,213
So interesting and so,
so many awesome people that you've been 

2458
01:47:45,361 --> 01:47:49,260
able to interview and have them pour 
into your life and you pour into theirs.

2459
01:47:49,261 --> 01:47:50,094
And because of that,
there's so many cool things that are 

2460
01:47:53,041 --> 01:47:54,270
happening in man.
I mean,

2461
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:55,733
honestly,
I'm just grateful to have your 

2462
01:47:58,081 --> 01:48:02,250
friendship and have this opportunity to 
share cause it's helped out so much.

2463
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:04,920
US be able to do this.
The very grateful,

2464
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,290
very grateful as well.
Very grateful as well.

2465
01:48:07,291 --> 01:48:08,790
And I also feel like this,
I mean,

2466
01:48:08,791 --> 01:48:11,250
I can't even take credit for this thing,
this thing and made itself.

2467
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:12,330
Yeah.
How do you miss,

2468
01:48:12,330 --> 01:48:13,770
I don't know,
turn into this,

2469
01:48:13,771 --> 01:48:14,490
you know,
I don't know.

2470
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:15,930
I don't know what this thing is.
This thing,

2471
01:48:15,931 --> 01:48:18,420
I just have to show up and try not to 
fuck it up.

2472
01:48:18,720 --> 01:48:21,090
That's what I tried to do.
I try to show up and not fuck it up.

2473
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:22,620
Yeah.
But it's so nice.

2474
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:23,250
Well,
you know what,

2475
01:48:23,250 --> 01:48:26,220
uh,
the float tank center that I go to in,

2476
01:48:26,221 --> 01:48:27,030
uh,
Oklahoma,

2477
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:30,720
it's called Fluid Casey on w my first,
no second time in there.

2478
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:31,230
Uh,
they were like,

2479
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:34,350
oh he didn't check the box of how you 
heard of this and a,

2480
01:48:34,351 --> 01:48:36,390
it was like friend family,
this or that.

2481
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:37,224
And then Joe Rogan,
because they started up because of you 

2482
01:48:39,901 --> 01:48:41,190
and like they're talking about,
hey,

2483
01:48:41,430 --> 01:48:43,800
you know,
there's probably 20 or 30 in the country

2484
01:48:43,801 --> 01:48:47,580
before joe started talking about it on 
the podcast and now it's just grown.

2485
01:48:47,581 --> 01:48:49,140
So it's hundreds of them.
It's crazy.

2486
01:48:49,141 --> 01:48:51,660
I think there's over 300 people said,
do you have a piece of those?

2487
01:48:51,661 --> 01:48:52,560
I'm like,
nope.

2488
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,550
Yeah,
no good,

2489
01:48:53,551 --> 01:48:54,720
good.
Keep going.

2490
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,350
I don't want any money.
Yeah.

2491
01:48:56,351 --> 01:48:57,184
More power to them.
I think it's an amazing way to change 

2492
01:48:59,161 --> 01:48:59,994
the way you look at the world and see 
yourself and be alone with your 

2493
01:49:02,491 --> 01:49:03,060
thoughts.

2494
01:49:03,060 --> 01:49:03,893
And I just think it's a,
it's one of the best tools for human 

2495
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:07,370
development.
Oh,

2496
01:49:07,380 --> 01:49:09,300
that's awesome.
I just think it's incredible.

2497
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,193
I just,
I was shocked when more people didn't 

2498
01:49:11,791 --> 01:49:12,650
know about it.
Yeah.

2499
01:49:12,710 --> 01:49:17,460
I had one in my house in 2002 wow.
Somewhere around there.

2500
01:49:17,470 --> 01:49:18,211
We'll do that.
Yeah.

2501
01:49:18,211 --> 01:49:20,000
2003 it's awesome.
You're,

2502
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:20,843
one of the reasons why I got this house 
was because it had a basement and I'm 

2503
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:24,990
like,
Ooh,

2504
01:49:24,990 --> 01:49:26,730
perfect place for a tank.
And I'm like,

2505
01:49:26,731 --> 01:49:27,061
that's,
I,

2506
01:49:27,061 --> 01:49:27,591
you know,
I'm,

2507
01:49:27,591 --> 01:49:29,730
I'm looking at houses all fucked up.
I might,

2508
01:49:29,731 --> 01:49:30,564
do,
I have enough room in the backyard to 

2509
01:49:30,980 --> 01:49:32,500
shoot my bow yes.
To.

2510
01:49:32,540 --> 01:49:33,900
Is there a tank room?
You know what I mean?

2511
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:36,270
That's how I look at houses now.
That's cool.

2512
01:49:36,271 --> 01:49:37,530
So how do you,
if it's okay,

2513
01:49:37,531 --> 01:49:41,550
how do you use,
I floated eight times now and the,

2514
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:46,590
I'd finally done a two hour float,
which was I think a lot more beneficial.

2515
01:49:46,591 --> 01:49:48,400
Doing it bit lost the game changer.

2516
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:49,660
Oh man,
that was awesome.

2517
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:52,720
And then,
but Wednesday before my fight on Friday,

2518
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:57,220
March 3rd,
I went in and I had this intention where

2519
01:49:57,221 --> 01:49:59,020
Neil from photo casey was like,
hey,

2520
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:00,303
why don't you instead of just rushing in
here from training or rushing in here 

2521
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:03,423
from,
uh,

2522
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:07,090
from the office at water for like come 
in 30 minutes early,

2523
01:50:07,091 --> 01:50:09,490
kind of sit down,
chill,

2524
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:11,050
close your eyes,
like,

2525
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,370
you know,
set an intention.

2526
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:13,870
Um,
and then do it.

2527
01:50:13,871 --> 01:50:16,750
And I came in and I had watched a 
documentary called the flute nation.

2528
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,370
Um,
and uh,

2529
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:20,770
it was cool cause it's like an hour,
hour and a half.

2530
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:21,633
And it showed a lot of different things,
but it showed some scientific stuff of 

2531
01:50:24,221 --> 01:50:25,054
uh,
of sports psychologist and basically 

2532
01:50:27,101 --> 01:50:27,934
visualization.
And then I've done some more research 

2533
01:50:29,981 --> 01:50:33,110
and there's this like place in Tulsa 
that has some brain doctors,

2534
01:50:33,320 --> 01:50:36,190
I mean doctors that are research and 
neuroscience and for stuff,

2535
01:50:36,191 --> 01:50:37,024
but they're finally doing a clinical 
study with people with anxiety and 

2536
01:50:40,081 --> 01:50:40,510
depression.

2537
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:42,470
It's finally fully funded.
Um,

2538
01:50:43,120 --> 01:50:43,953
and the guy was talking about it and was
saying that basically the same exact 

2539
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:49,383
results that antianxiety medicine has.
The float tank can do a hundred percent 

2540
01:50:54,281 --> 01:50:57,490
naturally and that the studies are 
coming out to back it up.

2541
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,400
And so it's just really cool.
But the tank Wednesday,

2542
01:51:00,430 --> 01:51:03,730
I basically visualize the fight exactly 
the way it went down on Friday.

2543
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:06,550
I just had this intense tie that was the
best float I've,

2544
01:51:06,610 --> 01:51:08,920
I've had were just sitting there 
thinking about the fight,

2545
01:51:08,921 --> 01:51:09,754
thinking about the fight,
thinking about the fight and saying 

2546
01:51:11,321 --> 01:51:12,154
everything that I wanted to do.
It's almost like I went to training 

2547
01:51:14,171 --> 01:51:18,310
before then I got and I was drilling the
moves I wanted to do on the flight.

2548
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:23,820
Then I went into the tank and I,
and I had right before that.

2549
01:51:23,831 --> 01:51:26,090
So I was drilling early that morning.
Um,

2550
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:29,050
everything that I wanted to do on the 
flight kind of visualizing before I went

2551
01:51:29,051 --> 01:51:29,884
into the tank.

2552
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:32,680
Then when I came out I was,
or before I got in the tank,

2553
01:51:32,681 --> 01:51:36,010
after training,
I started to watch fight film on him,

2554
01:51:36,011 --> 01:51:36,844
see how he's moving and then I went into
the tank and I was able to just think 

2555
01:51:39,971 --> 01:51:42,580
about what he's going to do,
think about what I'm going to do,

2556
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:44,830
how I'm going to implement it.
And then it's not,

2557
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:45,664
it's like the only thing only difference
was is I got two big throws instead of 

2558
01:51:48,371 --> 01:51:49,680
one big thorough,
um,

2559
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,613
in the vision had one throw and then in 
the fight had two big throws but the 

2560
01:51:53,141 --> 01:51:54,820
ground and pound straight into the arm 
triangle.

2561
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:58,210
Exactly what I've been envisioning.
So when you say personal development,

2562
01:51:58,211 --> 01:51:58,721
I'm like,
man,

2563
01:51:58,721 --> 01:51:59,920
I get it.
Like,

2564
01:51:59,921 --> 01:52:01,300
so how do you do it?
What do you,

2565
01:52:02,230 --> 01:52:04,510
I mean,
I don't know if that makes sense.

2566
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:06,880
Like I'm wanting to learn how to go deep
with it.

2567
01:52:07,140 --> 01:52:09,550
Just let go and use it as a tool of 
personal development.

2568
01:52:09,580 --> 01:52:11,290
Yeah.
The more often you can get into it,

2569
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:12,124
the more you get relaxed and the more 
you can sort of slip into that 

2570
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:16,593
comfortable state of not feeling the 
water or feeling the air and just being 

2571
01:52:20,861 --> 01:52:22,720
in your mind,
see nothing,

2572
01:52:22,721 --> 01:52:23,554
feel nothing released from your body.
And then I'll either go in there with 

2573
01:52:27,521 --> 01:52:29,840
ideas like maybe I'll go in there.
I've,

2574
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:30,753
I've gone over Jujitsu in there.
I've gone over different martial arts 

2575
01:52:33,881 --> 01:52:36,370
techniques in there where you sort of 
visualize movement.

2576
01:52:36,760 --> 01:52:38,350
Uh,
but a lot of that I use,

2577
01:52:38,351 --> 01:52:39,880
I do,
I'll go over material.

2578
01:52:39,881 --> 01:52:41,170
Like I've,
I'll have ideas.

2579
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:44,920
Sometimes it fucks up my float where I 
have an idea that I can't let,

2580
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:46,040
like I have

2581
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:51,040
to set something up where I have a voice
activated recorder inside the float tank

2582
01:52:51,531 --> 01:52:52,364
where I can talk,
but part of me doesn't want to talk 

2583
01:52:54,321 --> 01:52:56,540
while I'm in there.
I just want to be alone with my thoughts

2584
01:52:56,541 --> 01:52:58,970
because I think when you talk it'll take
you out of it.

2585
01:52:59,270 --> 01:53:00,103
But there's some,
some ideas that I don't want to escape 

2586
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:04,460
me because ideals are slippery,
man.

2587
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:05,180
They,
they,

2588
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:06,530
you know,
you have a great idea.

2589
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:09,380
Like sometimes I'll have a great idea 
when I'm in bed and I'm like,

2590
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:10,310
oh,
I'll remember that.

2591
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:13,130
I don't remember it ever.
Like you fucking ever,

2592
01:53:13,400 --> 01:53:16,070
I might remember one at a 10 that I 
think I'm going to remember.

2593
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:17,293
So I'm probably going to have to figure 
out some way to record things while I'm 

2594
01:53:20,181 --> 01:53:22,370
in the tank.
But for me,

2595
01:53:22,371 --> 01:53:23,151
um,
you know,

2596
01:53:23,151 --> 01:53:24,290
it depends on what I'm trying to do.

2597
01:53:24,680 --> 01:53:27,440
Trying to be balanced,
think about life,

2598
01:53:27,441 --> 01:53:29,350
think about my behavior,
think about my,

2599
01:53:29,370 --> 01:53:31,490
my interaction with people,
you know,

2600
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:36,491
my is to have as much energy and,
and an appreciation as I should do.

2601
01:53:37,041 --> 01:53:39,260
I have as much gratitude as I should.
You know,

2602
01:53:39,261 --> 01:53:40,094
I want to,
I just want to optimize my thought 

2603
01:53:42,261 --> 01:53:43,280
process,
you know?

2604
01:53:43,370 --> 01:53:48,370
And then definitely not claiming that I 
do or that I always have it right.

2605
01:53:48,441 --> 01:53:49,274
I definitely don't.
It's an ongoing process and that's one 

2606
01:53:51,381 --> 01:53:54,590
of the realities of being a person,
the idea of the perfect person.

2607
01:53:54,591 --> 01:53:57,710
It just doesn't exist.
And I think it's a bad,

2608
01:53:58,100 --> 01:53:58,933
it's a bad model to strive for and 
instead he should strive for doing your 

2609
01:54:02,271 --> 01:54:04,430
best whenever you can,
as much as you can.

2610
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:08,390
And I think that reviewing your thoughts
and reviewing,

2611
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:09,141
um,
your,

2612
01:54:09,141 --> 01:54:09,974
your whole mental process is a very 
important part of optimization about 

2613
01:54:14,271 --> 01:54:18,230
being your best and just taking account 
and looking at it from,

2614
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:19,333
I think it's one of the rare moments 
where you're actually alone with your 

2615
01:54:22,191 --> 01:54:23,450
thoughts,
you know,

2616
01:54:23,451 --> 01:54:27,740
where there's no influence of the body 
that the distractions of the body,

2617
01:54:27,741 --> 01:54:32,360
of just even the weight of sitting down 
and feeling your butt on the chair,

2618
01:54:32,570 --> 01:54:34,280
your,
your elbows on his desk,

2619
01:54:34,281 --> 01:54:38,000
all those things are factors and there 
they're being calculated by your mind.

2620
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:39,433
And the way,
the analogy that I always use is if you 

2621
01:54:41,031 --> 01:54:43,640
and I were having this conversation,
but right next to us as a Jackhammer,

2622
01:54:43,810 --> 01:54:47,510
it would be super distracting.
But that's just input that Jackhammer is

2623
01:54:47,511 --> 01:54:49,610
just,
it's just profound input.

2624
01:54:49,970 --> 01:54:53,060
And I think that everything is input.
Social Cues,

2625
01:54:53,061 --> 01:54:54,980
looking at people,
sounds,

2626
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:57,050
feeling touch,
gravity,

2627
01:54:57,350 --> 01:54:58,183
all those things or input that is going 
into the mind that your mind has to 

2628
01:55:01,671 --> 01:55:05,510
calculate in the absence of any input,
whether it's physical touch,

2629
01:55:05,511 --> 01:55:07,190
you feel like you're flying through 
space,

2630
01:55:07,191 --> 01:55:08,024
you feel it in zero gravity.
You don't feel the water cause it's the 

2631
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:12,140
same temperatures or scan,
you're floating in it.

2632
01:55:12,141 --> 01:55:12,974
It's total silence,
total darkness and the absence of that 

2633
01:55:15,800 --> 01:55:16,633
input.
I think your brain becomes super 

2634
01:55:17,781 --> 01:55:18,614
powered.
I think it becomes supercharged and I 

2635
01:55:20,151 --> 01:55:22,250
think you get to see things in a much 
clearer way.

2636
01:55:22,520 --> 01:55:23,160
And I've,
I've,

2637
01:55:23,160 --> 01:55:26,570
I've seen myself at fault when I thought
it was innocent.

2638
01:55:26,810 --> 01:55:31,810
I've seen myself a happy and fulfilled 
when I thought it was longing.

2639
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:33,413
I've,
it's given me a much more balanced 

2640
01:55:34,641 --> 01:55:35,474
perspective and a better way of 
addressing the realities of the 

2641
01:55:39,591 --> 01:55:41,080
complexities of life.
Hmm.

2642
01:55:41,950 --> 01:55:42,783
Yeah.
That's great.

2643
01:55:43,470 --> 01:55:44,850
That's awesome.
Powerful tool,

2644
01:55:44,851 --> 01:55:48,360
man.
It was weird to me that around 2002 when

2645
01:55:48,361 --> 01:55:51,570
I really started talking about it,
that nobody knew what the fuck it was.

2646
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,130
I was like,
how is this a weird,

2647
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:55,380
how am I the guy who's talking about 
this,

2648
01:55:55,620 --> 01:56:00,080
how's the UFC commentator,
the guy who's talking about floating and

2649
01:56:00,081 --> 01:56:01,740
we just didn't make any sense to me.
Yeah,

2650
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:02,430
no,
I,

2651
01:56:02,430 --> 01:56:03,263
I don't think I,
I mean you had talked about it and I 

2652
01:56:06,781 --> 01:56:07,614
knew about it,
but it wasn't until I got in the tank 

2653
01:56:10,801 --> 01:56:14,550
and came out of the tank for the first 
time that then I got it.

2654
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:15,633
Yeah.
It was like,

2655
01:56:15,660 --> 01:56:17,430
Oh man,
like this is awesome.

2656
01:56:17,550 --> 01:56:21,650
And the physical aspects of the way,
the magnesium in your body feel and the,

2657
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:25,500
the looseness of the being in zero 
gravity environment,

2658
01:56:25,501 --> 01:56:28,260
what feels like zero gravity?
Everything gets loose.

2659
01:56:28,261 --> 01:56:31,740
It just relaxes the back,
relaxes the arms and knees,

2660
01:56:31,741 --> 01:56:32,850
the,
the neck.

2661
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:35,720
Everything just gets loose in there and 
you come out just feeling good.

2662
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:37,050
You want to hug people.
Oh yeah,

2663
01:56:37,051 --> 01:56:39,390
I know.
That's exactly how I came out.

2664
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:43,350
I came out and had a smile from ear to 
ear and when I came out of it,

2665
01:56:43,351 --> 01:56:43,711
they're like,
oh,

2666
01:56:43,711 --> 01:56:44,544
you have the post float glow.
And I actually gave the guy a hug if I 

2667
01:56:46,950 --> 01:56:47,783
didn't even know his name,
but gave him a big hug and it was so 

2668
01:56:50,221 --> 01:56:50,790
cool,
man.

2669
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:51,640
And it's neat.
Uh,

2670
01:56:51,720 --> 01:56:55,890
the,
the float community seems like a like,

2671
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,300
like everyone just chill.

2672
01:56:57,330 --> 01:57:02,220
Everyone that has a deeper appreciation 
for that might be too much,

2673
01:57:02,221 --> 01:57:03,054
but it seems like everyone's got a 
deeper appreciation for life where they 

2674
01:57:05,160 --> 01:57:05,993
just,
um,

2675
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,400
I dunno.
I think there's something to what you're

2676
01:57:08,401 --> 01:57:10,320
saying.
It sounds pretentious,

2677
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:13,080
but you're right,
there is something there.

2678
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,880
I know what you're saying.
It's like saying that,

2679
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:16,313
I don't know.
It's,

2680
01:57:16,350 --> 01:57:17,970
there's something special about it.
It,

2681
01:57:18,090 --> 01:57:20,430
I think a big part of what that 
something special is,

2682
01:57:20,431 --> 01:57:23,280
is the alleviation of tension.
And I think tension,

2683
01:57:23,281 --> 01:57:24,114
you're much like inflammation causes a 
lot of diseases and a lot of disorders 

2684
01:57:27,271 --> 01:57:31,230
that people have pertaining to dye it 
and that inflammation causes,

2685
01:57:31,231 --> 01:57:33,240
like,
like you were talking about with a,

2686
01:57:33,241 --> 01:57:35,220
you're a CELIAC.
Absolutely.

2687
01:57:35,221 --> 01:57:36,870
That is a lot of it is based on 
inflammation,

2688
01:57:36,871 --> 01:57:37,590
right?
Right.

2689
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:39,950
I think tension is,
uh,

2690
01:57:39,990 --> 01:57:40,823
in,
in many ways the physical tension is 

2691
01:57:43,411 --> 01:57:44,790
also a,
another,

2692
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:47,190
a real boundary to comfort.

2693
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:51,240
And that physical tension is alleviated 
greatly when you're in that tank.

2694
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:53,220
And I think when you're more 
comfortable,

2695
01:57:53,221 --> 01:57:54,990
you're more relaxed.
When you're more relaxed,

2696
01:57:54,991 --> 01:57:56,370
you're more open.
When you're more open,

2697
01:57:56,371 --> 01:57:57,204
you're more loving.
I think all those things sort of 

2698
01:57:58,531 --> 01:57:59,970
cascade,
you know,

2699
01:57:59,971 --> 01:58:00,401
they,
they,

2700
01:58:00,401 --> 01:58:01,234
they feed on each other and they help.
And when a tense person that's like 

2701
01:58:03,721 --> 01:58:05,580
stressful like fuck,
fuck,

2702
01:58:05,581 --> 01:58:06,061
fuck,
you know,

2703
01:58:06,061 --> 01:58:07,200
you got Janet,
you know,

2704
01:58:07,201 --> 01:58:10,260
it's really hard to like be calm and 
kind,

2705
01:58:10,620 --> 01:58:12,450
you know,
it's like you're so wound up.

2706
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:17,070
I think that thing removes a lot of the 
physical aspects of being wound up.

2707
01:58:17,071 --> 01:58:17,904
And then on top of that,
the deep meditative effects of being in 

2708
01:58:21,481 --> 01:58:22,314
that tank,
especially if you go into it like you 

2709
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:28,581
did with like a vision or a direction 
and a thought to work on.

2710
01:58:30,150 --> 01:58:33,330
I think it does wonders for free of 
thought process.

2711
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:34,493
I mean I'm still learning about it 
because the first couple times I was 

2712
01:58:37,651 --> 01:58:42,280
just trying to just wipe my mind clean 
and it coming this stress

2713
01:58:42,310 --> 01:58:43,143
completely stress free,
feeling completely stress free at least 

2714
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:46,773
was awesome.
And then going in there with an 

2715
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:51,940
intention and with a goal with a fight 
just a couple of days away.

2716
01:58:52,210 --> 01:58:53,890
I don't,
I don't know that this is what happened,

2717
01:58:53,891 --> 01:58:54,724
but in training I had been feeling great
but then it felt like something just 

2718
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:00,970
turned on or sort of firing where it 
connected.

2719
01:59:00,971 --> 01:59:01,804
Like the mental visualization to the 
physical of actually going in there and 

2720
01:59:04,661 --> 01:59:08,800
doing it the exact way that I saw it was
something that just,

2721
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:10,330
I kind of blew my mind.
It was,

2722
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:12,160
it was cool to see that happen.
Um,

2723
01:59:12,340 --> 01:59:13,173
because you'd want to see the match or 
the fight a hundred times in your head 

2724
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:17,760
before we ever go out there and do it.
Um,

2725
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:19,480
I mean not,
not put things in,

2726
01:59:19,481 --> 01:59:20,314
it's where if it goes bad or if it 
doesn't go exactly the way in the fight 

2727
01:59:22,301 --> 01:59:23,740
that then you freak out during the 
fight.

2728
01:59:24,190 --> 01:59:25,023
But you want to have a goal and an 
intention and know what you're going to 

2729
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:27,634
do in there.
And I think that's probably what connor 

2730
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:29,374
did when he was fighting Aldo.
He knew he was going to go in there and 

2731
01:59:32,540 --> 01:59:33,373
indeed quick and he saw that happening.
And so I'm not saying I don't want put 

2732
01:59:37,271 --> 01:59:38,104
words in this top.
When he talked about it after the Eddie 

2733
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:40,301
Alvarez fight,
he said,

2734
01:59:40,301 --> 01:59:41,134
I,
I had a vision of me standing here with 

2735
01:59:42,591 --> 01:59:45,080
the second belt and acquitted the focus 
me other their belt.

2736
01:59:45,420 --> 01:59:47,550
He was like really upset,
right.

2737
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,390
I visualize this,
I wanted,

2738
01:59:49,750 --> 01:59:52,750
and then tyron woodley of all people,
they had to give his belt.

2739
01:59:52,751 --> 01:59:54,120
Right.
It was really cool that they did that,

2740
01:59:54,150 --> 01:59:56,500
that the tire and allowed that to 
happen.

2741
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,200
Kudos to him.
But then that,

2742
01:59:58,500 --> 02:00:00,190
that,
you know,

2743
02:00:00,191 --> 02:00:01,024
the visualization of a goal is very 
important to like solidifying this idea 

2744
02:00:06,521 --> 02:00:08,200
of what that goal is in your mind.

2745
02:00:08,410 --> 02:00:10,480
Visualization.
It's been,

2746
02:00:10,540 --> 02:00:11,373
um,
there's been studies done on 

2747
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:15,520
visualization and as far as athletics 
and,

2748
02:00:15,540 --> 02:00:16,373
and skill learning and some people 
believe it is as important as physical 

2749
02:00:19,931 --> 02:00:22,360
practice,
which is kind of crazy,

2750
02:00:22,390 --> 02:00:23,410
you know?
Yeah,

2751
02:00:23,411 --> 02:00:24,460
no,
I can see that.

2752
02:00:24,490 --> 02:00:25,323
Um,
I mean Kenny Monday who's been involved 

2753
02:00:27,191 --> 02:00:30,400
in them and make community quite a lot.
He was my high school wrestling coach.

2754
02:00:30,850 --> 02:00:31,400
And,
uh,

2755
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,470
he told me,
go home,

2756
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,170
write a goal,
put it with somewhere,

2757
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:35,860
you can see it.
So I wrote down,

2758
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:37,570
uh,
he told me to write down state champ,

2759
02:00:37,571 --> 02:00:40,150
but I wrote down national champ and I 
put it above my bed.

2760
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:42,210
And then over here,
you know,

2761
02:00:42,220 --> 02:00:43,690
working with him,
training,

2762
02:00:44,080 --> 02:00:45,340
getting some wrestling moves,
I put,

2763
02:00:45,341 --> 02:00:46,174
uh,
a step around body lock on the left and 

2764
02:00:49,121 --> 02:00:52,060
I played a lateral drop on the right.
And so my,

2765
02:00:52,450 --> 02:00:55,360
my favorite rest and move on the left 
and my second favorite wrestling move on

2766
02:00:55,361 --> 02:00:56,110
the right.

2767
02:00:56,110 --> 02:00:58,390
And when I won my first national 
championship,

2768
02:00:58,391 --> 02:01:00,730
it was what the move on the left and one
on one my second,

2769
02:01:00,731 --> 02:01:02,770
it was with the move on the right.
And so it was,

2770
02:01:02,771 --> 02:01:05,770
I was going to bed thinking about it,
dreaming about it,

2771
02:01:05,771 --> 02:01:07,210
Waking Up,
starting my day,

2772
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,040
thinking about it,
and uh,

2773
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:12,660
in wanting to really put that in action.
And so I,

2774
02:01:12,720 --> 02:01:13,553
I totally get it and I,
I need to be more conscious of it and 

2775
02:01:16,421 --> 02:01:19,540
dive even deeper into it because I'm 
like you,

2776
02:01:19,541 --> 02:01:21,040
I agree that,
um,

2777
02:01:21,130 --> 02:01:21,963
or at least I can see the point and how 
it's valid that the mental focus and 

2778
02:01:25,331 --> 02:01:28,720
energy and visualizing is pretty much 
just as important as actually physically

2779
02:01:28,721 --> 02:01:29,890
doing it.
It's huge.

2780
02:01:29,891 --> 02:01:32,500
And all of them together are really what
it's all about.

2781
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:33,400
Yeah.
It's none of that.

2782
02:01:33,470 --> 02:01:34,131
No,
no,

2783
02:01:34,131 --> 02:01:35,170
no aspect.
Yeah,

2784
02:01:35,171 --> 02:01:36,550
no aspect can be ignored.

2785
02:01:37,240 --> 02:01:39,040
Um,
I got to get out of here soon.

2786
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:41,930
Is there anything else you want to tell 
people about or wrap this up?

2787
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:42,890
Man,
we can,

2788
02:01:42,890 --> 02:01:45,500
we can get to wrapping it up,
but a real quick,

2789
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:50,600
we have two goals going on right now 
where I'm at water four.org.

2790
02:01:50,601 --> 02:01:52,670
We're doing a world water day campaign.
Uh,

2791
02:01:52,910 --> 02:01:56,780
we threw up a goal to raise a set 
audacious goal to do that water tank,

2792
02:01:56,781 --> 02:01:58,610
water tower,
water kiosk system.

2793
02:01:59,150 --> 02:01:59,983
Uh,
it's going to serve 4,000 people and 

2794
02:02:01,011 --> 02:02:04,820
then create more water wells.
It's a $50,000 goal,

2795
02:02:05,030 --> 02:02:09,320
but we've already raised 35.
Someone yesterday gave 25 grand to it.

2796
02:02:09,640 --> 02:02:11,590
Um,
and so we're,

2797
02:02:11,591 --> 02:02:12,470
we're,
we got a f,

2798
02:02:12,620 --> 02:02:14,480
uh,
about a week left and,

2799
02:02:14,481 --> 02:02:15,314
uh,
we're hoping to get another 15 because 

2800
02:02:16,401 --> 02:02:17,234
if that happens,
we're able to really make that 

2801
02:02:18,471 --> 02:02:20,870
sustainable,
that team there in Rwanda.

2802
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:22,220
Um,
and then,

2803
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:23,473
I mean,
we know for that people go to 

2804
02:02:24,171 --> 02:02:25,130
waterford.org.

2805
02:02:25,190 --> 02:02:26,023
Yeah.
Waterford I'd worry if they go to my 

2806
02:02:26,751 --> 02:02:29,120
search number four,
number four.org.

2807
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:30,460
And then it's like campaign,
it's,

2808
02:02:30,510 --> 02:02:31,343
it's our world water day campaign.
I think I have it up right now on my 

2809
02:02:33,981 --> 02:02:36,530
social media,
on twitter and on instagram.

2810
02:02:36,531 --> 02:02:37,580
It's the,
the link,

2811
02:02:37,620 --> 02:02:39,650
uh,
like the website or the link in the bio.

2812
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,050
Um,
it's the actual campaign link.

2813
02:02:42,051 --> 02:02:42,884
So if you just go to,
at the big pygmy on instagram or 

2814
02:02:44,361 --> 02:02:45,790
twitter,
um,

2815
02:02:45,860 --> 02:02:49,160
you can just click right there and get 
right to the campaign and yeah,

2816
02:02:49,170 --> 02:02:52,070
and for people that can give one time,
uh,

2817
02:02:52,071 --> 02:02:52,904
that's,
that's where you can give one time and 

2818
02:02:54,801 --> 02:02:55,634
if you want,
we're trying to make us sustainable 

2819
02:02:57,081 --> 02:02:57,914
here.
And so if we had people that bought in 

2820
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,320
and,
uh,

2821
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:03,260
did $25 a month over the course of a 
year,

2822
02:03:03,261 --> 02:03:04,094
your gift,
15 people clean water for the rest of 

2823
02:03:05,691 --> 02:03:06,524
their lives.

2824
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:07,363
And the reason that is,
is because we train up the locals to go 

2825
02:03:08,661 --> 02:03:11,660
out and be able to repair the wells and 
always be able to serve the community.

2826
02:03:12,050 --> 02:03:15,530
And so $25 a month goes a real long way.
Um,

2827
02:03:15,740 --> 02:03:17,150
and yeah.
So brother,
