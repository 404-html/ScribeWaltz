1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,620
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,890
your childhood was fucking
completely bizarre.

3
00:00:04,891 --> 00:00:08,040
I mean my childhood was bizarre on paper,

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,650
but it wasn't bizarre in
front of the whole world,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,331
you know?

6
00:00:11,331 --> 00:00:15,090
And you became a fucking superstar
when you were a little kid.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,021
You're 40 now,

8
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:16,530
right?

9
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,110
District for.

10
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:17,400
Okay.

11
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,750
I'm 43.

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,370
So when I saw the champ,

13
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,450
I think I was seven.

14
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,410
What would you like for?

15
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:22,620
No,

16
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:22,861
no,

17
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:23,790
I was seven.

18
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,590
So you were 10 and the champ.

19
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:26,783
Really?

20
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:27,530
Okay.

21
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:27,750
My,

22
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,370
my time,

23
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:29,160
Ron,

24
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,060
but either way.

25
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:30,481
Either way,

26
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:32,010
whatever I was seven or 10,

27
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,680
I was fucking crying like a baby.

28
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:36,660
And you were even younger than me then.

29
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,730
So when I was a little kid,

30
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,770
when I was like going through life,

31
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,670
trying to figure out,

32
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:41,941
you know,

33
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,960
what my parents were breaking,

34
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,610
I'm going to try to figure out like fuck,

35
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:45,570
what is life all about?

36
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,340
You were fucking famous
in front of the world.

37
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:53,850
Like I couldn't imagine that
point in my life being famous.

38
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,350
That must have been so
strange to develop in that.

39
00:00:58,351 --> 00:00:59,580
But you're so normal.

40
00:00:59,670 --> 00:00:59,791
Well,

41
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,790
here's the thing that's interesting
about like growing up famous,

42
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,220
because I became famous
when I was like seven,

43
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,980
so I don't have any memory
of life before fame.

44
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,083
Wow.

45
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,090
So when that happens and you're forming
and you're getting programmed and you're

46
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,730
getting created as a child,

47
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,660
right?

48
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:15,990
Um,

49
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,400
that's what becomes normal for you.

50
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,140
And so I don't have any frame of reference
like I wasn't 30 and all of a sudden

51
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,670
Bam became famous and I had 30
years of history of normal life.

52
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,370
So fame is normal for me.

53
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,140
So because it's normal,

54
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,340
that means kind of,

55
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:36,090
it's not special because
what's normal is normal.

56
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,433
Right?

57
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,303
So that's kind of,

58
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,190
I think at different unique
thing about being a child actor.

59
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,023
Like I wasn't.

60
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,100
I saw drew barrymore last night.

61
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:46,380
I went to never heard anybody put it that
way before I went to her premier last

62
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:46,710
night and she,

63
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:49,130
she's kind of done the same thing and um,

64
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,570
her new movie and gave
her a big hug and kiss.

65
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:55,530
I haven't seen her in 20 years to grab
her ass and not just cheat girl though

66
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,470
you get rid of case.

67
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:58,950
I've known her since I felt good.

68
00:01:58,951 --> 00:01:59,201
I was,

69
00:01:59,201 --> 00:01:59,870
I'm 12,

70
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,780
I'm on felt good.

71
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:01,614
She was eight.

72
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,920
We would dance Tom Green.

73
00:02:03,921 --> 00:02:04,591
That got that.

74
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,850
You could get that to kid.

75
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,430
So drew the same thing.

76
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
It's been a few of us that
have gone through that,

77
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,513
like not many.

78
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,191
Very,

79
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:11,921
very few.

80
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:12,754
I could count on a hand.

81
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,210
Yeah.

82
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:17,460
The percentage of people who go through
that and get Lindsay Lohan or like,

83
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,510
it's like 95,

84
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:18,900
right?

85
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,201
Yeah.

86
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:19,680
More.

87
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
More than maybe.

88
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,270
What do you think was
the difference with you?

89
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:24,423
Uh,

90
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,380
what's the difference?

91
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:25,831
You know,

92
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:29,970
I quit the partying thing when I
was young and I didn't continue it.

93
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:33,390
Like I think some people do and you know,

94
00:02:33,391 --> 00:02:37,350
I had my few wildly
years between 16 and 20,

95
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,960
but you know,

96
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,380
I always kept my kind of stuff quiet and
I kind of kept it under the radar and

97
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,130
you know,

98
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,480
it wasn't really public about it.

99
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,700
And then I met that was
because there was no TMZ.

100
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,810
There's no internet,

101
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,930
no Internet sun and keep it on
the dl rotors here making it rain.

102
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,800
Do you ever wonder when I was 20 I met
Andrea and that just kinda changed my

103
00:02:58,801 --> 00:02:59,560
life because I was,

104
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,640
I was a dad at 22.

105
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,361
Oh.

106
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,560
So that's a big part of it,

107
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:02,860
too.

108
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,730
Responsibility.

109
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,580
Very early on.

110
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:04,871
Now.

111
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:07,170
Did you used to hang out with all
those people back in the data?

112
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,010
Like Gary Coleman and all those guys,

113
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,190
like,

114
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,560
like were you like hanging
with punky brewster and stuff?

115
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,400
Yeah,

116
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,390
I knew everybody there.

117
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:15,010
I mean the different strokes kids.

118
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:16,120
We're filming next door.

119
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:16,781
The facts of life.

120
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,930
Girls were across the,

121
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,810
the other studio stage.

122
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,070
Did you guys move at each other?

123
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,701
Who's the boss?

124
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,210
Kids.

125
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,080
Did you guys Bang Tryna?

126
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:23,771
You must've,

127
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:23,981
right?

128
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,480
Yeah,

129
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,210
for sure.

130
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:25,421
Yeah.

131
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,254
It's small.

132
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,760
It's small wonder ustream
crowd knows what's up,

133
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,171
so yeah,

134
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:33,260
there was some drama going on,

135
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,640
on,

136
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,240
on set.

137
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,781
You know what I mean?

138
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,380
There was.

139
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,210
I told you a little bit
about the todd bridges than.

140
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:37,580
Yeah,

141
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,440
todd bridges.

142
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,160
I had,

143
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,100
we had todd bridges on fear factor
and he had a chip on his shoulder.

144
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:42,401
I mean,

145
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:42,671
not,

146
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:42,911
not.

147
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,280
I mean,

148
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,320
wasn't a bad guy,

149
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:48,090
but had this thought that
everybody was out to fuck them,

150
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:48,950
that everybody,

151
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,040
like we were fucking them over
like we didn't want them to win.

152
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,221
Oh,

153
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:51,491
I see.

154
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:51,880
What's up.

155
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,391
You don't want me to.

156
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,161
When I was like two,

157
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:55,240
but the guy or the guy beat yet.

158
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,050
What am I going to say?

159
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:56,660
Right.

160
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,250
Come on man.

161
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,020
It's ridiculous.

162
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,050
But he's got a new book out,

163
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:00,880
so like God bless him.

164
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:02,170
I hope he sells it and stuff,

165
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:02,321
but.

166
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:02,921
Well he just,

167
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,550
you know,

168
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,280
he didn't.

169
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,900
My point is he did not get through
it the way you got through.

170
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,670
He was chasing me around
with a pistol full of urine.

171
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:10,690
Wow.

172
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,010
Water pistol full of urine.

173
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,090
It was really.

174
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,421
He was.

175
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:13,671
Yeah.

176
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,630
I mean he was pissing a water
pistol and then just say,

177
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:17,021
okay,

178
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:21,310
I'm going to score it because the rest
of us would be thrown water cups at each

179
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:21,851
other and crap.

180
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:24,600
And he took it to the next
level and just started sweating.

181
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:25,434
It was urine

182
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,970
random over with your training.

183
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,190
He was big and he was older.

184
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,840
We were all scared of todd.

185
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,733
How old was he?

186
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,390
And we were all like 13,

187
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:36,010
14 and he's all like 18,

188
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:36,640
19.

189
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,510
Oh my God.

190
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,010
He was 18 and 19 years.

191
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,570
Pissing little kids faces.

192
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,673
Yeah.

193
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,320
Kelly was the originator of that.

194
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,131
He had a porsche.

195
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:45,341
Right.

196
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:48,840
And so he was racing around the studio
and stuff and I remember I was 16 and I

197
00:04:48,841 --> 00:04:49,870
had just gotten my nine,

198
00:04:49,871 --> 00:04:51,430
44 turbo and he's like,

199
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:52,480
let me take it for a drive.

200
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:52,900
And I'm like,

201
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,531
oh,

202
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:54,364
okay.

203
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,490
So I gave him the car keys and he's like,

204
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,900
this thing is broken and right.

205
00:04:59,260 --> 00:04:59,950
Wow.

206
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,570
Just abused my car.

207
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,070
He brought it back with bald spots on the.

208
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,373
Wow.

209
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,243
Wow.

210
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,600
Well you let them do that.

211
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,770
Went to todd bridges.

212
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,781
Yeah.

213
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:11,620
Well todd bridges.

214
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,700
He wasn't a bad dude though.

215
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,690
He's just so.

216
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,860
He's just a fucking baby.

217
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,960
That got stuck into a weird situation.

218
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,840
It didn't develop.

219
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,070
Dana.

220
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,190
Plato became a drug addict,

221
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:21,490
right?

222
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:21,731
Yeah,

223
00:05:21,731 --> 00:05:22,960
she died in Vegas.

224
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,250
That's the place to die if you're
going to die with other drug addicts.

225
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,830
The disease.

226
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,070
Segal finds its flock.

227
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:30,901
Can I place it?

228
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:32,300
This quote that I was
talking about earlier?

229
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:32,710
Oh yeah.

230
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,180
This is silver spoons is from I love,

231
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,100
I love silver spoons,

232
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:38,710
but this is one of my favorite quotes
and it's so weird to listen to you right

233
00:05:38,711 --> 00:05:38,980
now.

234
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,670
Listen to this.

235
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:39,920
Listen,

236
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,753
this

237
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,750
looks like the recording.

238
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,383
This is crazy.

239
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,830
See computers the way feature
people already playing

240
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,760
someday.

241
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,470
People that do all their
banking or shopping with
computers Sunday almost every

242
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,800
lifting to be done by a computer.

243
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,490
Well that's nice.

244
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,333
But um,

245
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,720
what do you need special stories like
can you mess with me and took with this

246
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,554
thing,

247
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,900
Jackson trying to steal money
lets me and Gary Coleman.

248
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,640
So listen to what you were saying man.

249
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:12,590
You were saying that like,

250
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,501

254
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:24,000
you shut the power off.

255
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm back anyway.

256
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,553
Um,

257
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,323
so how,

258
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,700
how did they fucking predict that?

259
00:06:29,701 --> 00:06:29,881
So?

260
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:30,650
Well,

261
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,180
uh,

262
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,013
it's Kinda creepy.

263
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,650
Like did you guys get like computers?

264
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,040
I'm like steve jobs or stuff like that.

265
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:35,874
They all like.

266
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,620
Because that whole show
was about computers.

267
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:42,390
Did you have like the inside word
where you are your profit target?

268
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,200
No,

269
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,651
I don't know.

270
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:44,281
You're Mormon.

271
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:47,340
You will be a profit video
games man on set and stuff,

272
00:06:47,341 --> 00:06:48,750
so I don't know about the computer thing.

273
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,760
I know as a kid how crazy you were.

274
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,490
Like you were like kid porn for us.

275
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,280
You were like,

276
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,440
dude,

277
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,590
he has a pac man machine.

278
00:06:55,591 --> 00:06:56,460
He has a train.

279
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,650
You've got every single toy in the rural.

280
00:06:59,651 --> 00:07:02,760
And it was like we idolized
you as kids at our age group.

281
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:03,690
I'm 36,

282
00:07:03,691 --> 00:07:06,120
so it's like I had I think duck phone.

283
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:11,230
I had like a remote control from
your whole with Mr Aaron gray man.

284
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,320
If there was a tmz back during gray,

285
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,070
what would,

286
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,450
what would they have caught you doing?

287
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,710
Uh,

288
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,820
what would that be?

289
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:18,631
Popping bottles.

290
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:19,740
Hanging out of the hotel.

291
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:24,741
Roosevelt with Alfonzo and Corey Haim
and Corey Feldman back in 1986 87.

292
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,350
Roosevelt wasn't nice.

293
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,040
Really.

294
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,270
It was a dive.

295
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:30,840
Wow.

296
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,470
What was back then was
a dive club Hollywood.

297
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,900
You remember the hotel
Roosevelt a super cute.

298
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:36,230
I remember.

299
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:38,340
I remember hearing about club Hollywood,

300
00:07:38,341 --> 00:07:38,551
you know,

301
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:39,091
back in the day,

302
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,550
like teen bop magazine Hollywood.

303
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,610
That was so weird,

304
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,444
man.

305
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,913
Haim's dead.

306
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,930
Nobody saw that coming,

307
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,040
so.

308
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,340
Oh,

309
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,960
how weird is it that there's these kids
that grew up with you that didn't make

310
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:58,650
it through the net?

311
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,850
How weird is that to watch?

312
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,050
Um,

313
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:01,720
yeah.

314
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,370
It's,

315
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,170
I feel really bad for the kid,

316
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,300
like Corey Haim that you knew
when he was a little kid.

317
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:06,930
Yeah.

318
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,930
He was so good too,

319
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,620
you know,

320
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,700
when he was little then when
the two of them weren't.

321
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,060
But was that fucking vampire movie?

322
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,043
The Lost Boys.

323
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:13,680
Just boys.

324
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,790
They were good in those movies.

325
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,770
He was a good actor.

326
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,370
Yeah.

327
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,680
So you must have hung
out with Michael Jackson.

328
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,770
And what did they taste like?

329
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:22,160
You remember that kid ever finished?

330
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:23,803
Yeah,

331
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,960
I mean he was a real talent.

332
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:25,590
Fuck.

333
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,310
That was crazy.

334
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,630
Dying on sunset strip.

335
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,493
You know?

336
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,660
What about Michael Jackson that
used to hang out with them?

337
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,970
Michael Jackson visited
the set of silver spoons.

338
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,600
Wow.

339
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,230
What was that like?

340
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:35,640
He was friends with Alfonzo.

341
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:37,370
Who was my buddy on silver spoons.

342
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,190
You know Fonzo who was on the
fresh prince right after source.

343
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,240
And what's his last name again?

344
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,740
Roberto Rivera Alfonzo.

345
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,311
So yeah,

346
00:08:44,311 --> 00:08:45,270
he came to visit one day,

347
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,070
Michael Jackson and I'm hanging out
with Alfonzo Alfonzo commercial.

348
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,490
That was when he was the
biggest star on the planet ever.

349
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,031
Huge.

350
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:54,271
Yeah,

351
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,721
huge.

352
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:55,280
It was.

353
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,200
That was going to tell about my book
and that was like three made me very

354
00:08:58,201 --> 00:08:58,860
uncomfortable.

355
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,693
Oh really?

356
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,620
Did he didn't kiss on the lips?

357
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
He was bullshitting.

358
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:07,470
He's Michael Jackson estate lawyers down.

359
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,060
Do you think he fuck kids?

360
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,733
Um,

361
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,660
you must have heard stories.

362
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,130
I don't know about anal,

363
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,590
but I think it might be a set.

364
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,280
Might've been some inappropriate stuff
if I had to guess like some handjobs

365
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,940
webster pull you aside and was like,

366
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:24,050
don't go to webster.

367
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:24,960
Really?

368
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,780
I heard so many rumors about
Michael Jackson and why he's,

369
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:28,260
he's,

370
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,591
you know,

371
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,730
why he was the way he was.

372
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,500
But you were actually there.

373
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:32,540
What was he like?

374
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,100
Like where you have for this kind?

375
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,230
I want it to mean no funds that
went to the universal amphitheater,

376
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:37,981
wants to see him play.

377
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:38,561
And we went into.

378
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,400
Is this was like Billie Jean Times?

379
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:41,701
Yeah,

380
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:42,570
this is the time.

381
00:09:42,571 --> 00:09:44,210
So she on top of the fucking point,

382
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,680
biggest planet starting the universe,

383
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,860
and so,

384
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,330
um,

385
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:50,270
we're hanging out in his trailer and um,

386
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,060
you know,

387
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,530
just hanging out really nice quiet,

388
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,364
shy guy.

389
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,900
And so I'm like 16,

390
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:55,351
17.

391
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:55,591
I said,

392
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:55,921
Michael,

393
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:56,490
what's know,

394
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,150
how did you make it from a kid
actor to an adult like this,

395
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:00,301
you know,

396
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:01,260
how did you survive?

397
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:04,980
Because I was kind of in the middle of
transitioning from a kid to an adult.

398
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:06,000
And he said,

399
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:06,270
you know what,

400
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,550
the trick was being inspired ricky,

401
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,280
because I had to be
inspired to keep it up.

402
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,610
And I had to find stuff that I
wanted to work on and wanting to do.

403
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,420
And,

404
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:15,631
you know,

405
00:10:15,631 --> 00:10:15,990
I,

406
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,310
I kind of took that advice to heart,

407
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,173
you know,

408
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,051
but no,

409
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:20,040
nothing ever inappropriate.

410
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,150
And he started kissing her nipples.

411
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,050
Nothing inappropriate rap
with me or that I know of.

412
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,130
Hello?

413
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:00,700
Hello?
