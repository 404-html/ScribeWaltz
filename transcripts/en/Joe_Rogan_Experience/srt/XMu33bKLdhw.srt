1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:06,130
Yes,
Ella,

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,080
what's up my friend?
What's up with you,

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,790
eleanor?
My long running friend,

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,633
one of my longest running friends in 
Hollywood and a girl who's now a 

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,213
professional,
legit professional standup comic who I 

6
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:24,430
always knew for years as a waitress.
I always tell everybody this story,

7
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:25,264
but it's true.
Eleanor was my goto person to find out 

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,090
someone who was a hack.
There would be someone would say,

9
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,770
Oh,
you've gotta check out this person.

10
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:34,060
They're amazing.
I go,

11
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:34,894
okay,
cool,

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,741
and then I go,
eleanor,

13
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:36,940
did you see a blah,
blah,

14
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,740
blah.
She's like fucking hack.

15
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:42,160
And there was a lot of people that got 
tricked.

16
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,103
Trickery is big.
A lot of people who we thought were 

17
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:47,474
like,
you think they're legit and you see him 

18
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,210
a few times and you're like,
oh,

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,520
what's going on here?
Yeah,

20
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,470
there's a lot of that.
There was a lot of them I feel like,

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,300
and I used to tell my customers I'd be 
like,

22
00:00:58,301 --> 00:00:58,991
alright,
right here,

23
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,130
you're going to want to go to the 
bathroom.

24
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,470
You want to stay in there for awhile.
While when you came to the store,

25
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,570
you were at the store before?
I was 93,

26
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,553
I came in [inaudible] 94,
so when I was there you were already 

27
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:13,060
there,
but those were dark years.

28
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,283
There was not the beginning in the 
beginning I was still doing three shows 

29
00:01:17,741 --> 00:01:21,730
in the alarm.
Was it like 97,

30
00:01:21,731 --> 00:01:23,130
98?
It just kind of.

31
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,440
Yeah,
around then it got bad.

32
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,420
Yeah.
Well when we first got there,

33
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,403
Martin Lawrence was on top and he would 
come there all the time and fill the 

34
00:01:32,921 --> 00:01:35,830
place.
Sort of like a Louis does now.

35
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:41,150
He comes and Joe Rogan x,
but no,

36
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,300
my first ex fiance used to represent 
Martin Lawrence.

37
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,403
Oh,
that's right.

38
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,400
I have a complex fiances.
Not a closer guys.

39
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,960
Not yet,
but you were.

40
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,633
You were like,
you were like receiving like a master 

41
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,110
class in comedy before he ever did it.

42
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,040
Oh my God.
Yeah,

43
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,903
like I would watch them all the time 
because then when I wasn't at the store 

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:05,380
I was with my fiance and we'd be at 
comedy clubs.

45
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:06,214
We were on the road with Chris rock when
he was doing bringing the paint because 

46
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:14,371
Chris was his other client,
so it was like watching everybody.

47
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:16,660
That's how I became friends with 
sheriff,

48
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,700
uh,
through my first ex fiance,

49
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,803
so we would go to all,
he was booking the Riviera and then I 

50
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,110
would help them book people once in a 
blue moon.

51
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:28,270
And of course they all get panned 
idiots.

52
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,270
Isn't it crazy that Jericho was booking 
the Riviera?

53
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:34,320
We always knew him as the booking guy 
who's really fun,

54
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,850
hang out with.
So just such a great guy.

55
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:40,740
And then all of a sudden he's on the 
fucking greatest show all the time.

56
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,620
What it was so weird for me to watch him
on the soprano's.

57
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,690
I'm like,
how is this possible?

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,250
He's like,
I might get this part.

59
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,084
I'm like,
what?

60
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,280
Why?
We were all like freaking out,

61
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:52,510
like,
are you kidding?

62
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,190
And then he finally told me,
he goes,

63
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:55,780
I finished the paperwork today.
I'm like,

64
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,610
Oh my God,
I'm freaking out.

65
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,870
I couldn't wait to see him on the,
you know,

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,740
he has the best fucking spaghetti sauce 
in the world.

67
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,670
I know.
I have to try it.

68
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,940
It's really good.
Studying.

69
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,823
What is it called?
Lookup Steve's Europe is sauce like 

70
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,610
something in New York.
It's one on Sopranos.

71
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,130
Was he was a younger,
clean bobby,

72
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,053
bobby,
bobby.

73
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:13,010
Bobby,
yeah.

74
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,451
He,
he,

75
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:17,290
they made him put a gut suit on,
like they made him,

76
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,520
like,
he wasn't that big.

77
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,410
He's pretty big now.
Like if you wanted to do it now,

78
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,600
I probably wouldn't have.
Yeah,

79
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:27,370
he's good.
He's a fucking character thing.

80
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,590
Thank God for people like that.

81
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,730
There it is uncle Steve's.
That's what it is.

82
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,780
Control Steve's always something like 
that.

83
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,310
And what is the,
is it uncle Steve's?

84
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,690
Steve's and y.com.
Uncle Steve's and [inaudible] dot com.

85
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,760
But he has amazing pasta sauce and that.
We've known this guy for forever.

86
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,723
Easily.
Like I feel like I've known him since 

87
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,540
the day I got here.
Yeah.

88
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,360
I've known him forever and he's always 
been awesome because he did,

89
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,780
he booked like big clients like that for
billy.

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,620
He introduced me to Lichtenburg my 
business manager.

91
00:03:59,621 --> 00:04:00,454
It's been my business manager forever.
He got the stamp of approval from EPA 

92
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,820
guy.
He's a good guy.

93
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,740
He's a good guy.
He's a real guy.

94
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,720
But we,
you know,

95
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,620
we've,
we've had a chance to see a lot of,

96
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,150
uh,
like we,

97
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,280
we got a chance to see Richard Pryor 
together.

98
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,543
Remember those students for a year.
I remember I was so nervous I was in 

99
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:28,150
that office at the comedy store and I 
brought them in water and I was like,

100
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,043
oh my God.
Because we used to get punished for 

101
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,890
listening to his stuff.
So then I was like,

102
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,140
I told him that and he's like,
that's good.

103
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:40,141
And then later on his wife wouldn't let 
me bring him the too nice.

104
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,120
He used to call him Martinis,
he'd bring me in Tunis,

105
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,150
Tunisia.
So I was like three to prowl,

106
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,990
bring them whenever he wants,
fast for cocaine,

107
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:48,340
I'm going to go find,
you know what I mean?

108
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,840
It's exciting.
So,

109
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,683
uh,
I brought it to him and she made me 

110
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:53,760
change it to water.

111
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,350
He made me change it.
I love her.

112
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,184
I know what she was doing,
but at the same time it's like he's 

113
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,450
sick,
let him have his Friggen Martini,

114
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,343
you know what I mean?
And I brought it on stage and he sipped 

115
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:07,210
it and he knew it was water and he was 
like,

116
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,180
bitch,
like,

117
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,230
oh my God.
Richard Pryor doesn't like me.

118
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,230
No bitch wipe.
No.

119
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,410
But yeah,
I didn't want to get in trouble.

120
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:19,360
I didn't know if it was his meds that 
would counteract.

121
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,340
You never know why she was doing it.
But.

122
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,360
No,
I hear Ya.

123
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,280
I mean ultimately you have to listen to 
her.

124
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,430
She's like,
she can't remember.

125
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,350
So I did it.
Yeah,

126
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,490
he did it a long time.
I had to go on after him a lot.

127
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,750
Oh yeah,
for a year.

128
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,310
He did a year.
He did Monday,

129
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,940
Wednesday,
Friday.

130
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,710
And then it switched down to just 
Wednesday.

131
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,713
Yeah.
I don't remember how many times I went 

132
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:38,224
on after him,
but I remember I bombed basically every 

133
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,404
single one of them,
like I might have got over a couple of 

134
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,950
times.
It was packed.

135
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,493
It was just,
it was weird too because he was really 

136
00:05:49,721 --> 00:05:53,290
ill.
Chili carrier bought chewy.

137
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,380
And um,
who else?

138
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,510
James?
No,

139
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,373
it wasn't bad.

140
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,750
It was.
I don't think it was.

141
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,050
It was Maryland.
Martinez.

142
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:04,620
His husband remember?
Yeah.

143
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:05,663
David,
just to help him and Julie used to help 

144
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,600
Richard Pryor get to the stage now.
I remember.

145
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,360
I'm afraid to put my headphones all the 
way off.

146
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,900
I don't think I'm weird.
I don't know.

147
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:17,930
I have a paranoia and worry that 
someone's going to sneak up on it.

148
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,720
I don't know what that.
You sort of blocked this filly.

149
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:21,554
That's that old school.
Philly philly has a UFC lightweight 

150
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:29,690
champion of the world now from Philly 
know that Alvarez.

151
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,610
Oh Wow.
He's from philly.

152
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,950
How come I didn't know that.
That stinks.

153
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,570
But uh,
that's awesome.

154
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,370
And how are the fights this weekend?
It's insane.

155
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,150
The opera is one was probably the most 
insane.

156
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,640
Well I didn't watch of those was a big 
underdog.

157
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,860
He felt hot.
Dos Anjos on the Internet.

158
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,550
It was on the Internet.

159
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:49,570
It was.
Oops was only on UFC fight reflex like a

160
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,580
cat on UFC fight pass.
And so I don't think a lot of people.

161
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,650
So I don't know how many people watched 
the fight past ones,

162
00:06:57,651 --> 00:07:00,080
but I don't think,
I know it's not as much as Fox.

163
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:03,080
I don't think it's as much as a paper 
view,

164
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:03,914
but I could be wrong at this point 
because I know there's millions of 

165
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,090
millions of people would have fight pass
now I,

166
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,830
I don't,
I don't know that the actual numbers,

167
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,023
but fipass is awesome.
You can watch every fight that's ever 

168
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,460
taken place and they have a few world 
title fights on it now.

169
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,370
So that world title fight was a part of 
the three day celebration.

170
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,413
So it was a heartfelt dos Anjos versus 
Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight title 

171
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,683
and then it was a,
you want to young Jay check and a logic 

172
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,680
a day on Friday night for the women's 
strawweight title.

173
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,513
And then there was the big UFC 200.
So it was three nights of insane fights 

174
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,483
thing.
I think I came off stage when the girls 

175
00:07:38,721 --> 00:07:39,554
were fighting and I came,
I went to show my friend the bar at the 

176
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,741
comedy store,
you know,

177
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:43,700
the bar,
and I was like,

178
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:44,301
oh,
come in here.

179
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,030
And everybody's like.
I was like,

180
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,450
oh,
I forgot we're doing comics.

181
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,540
Sorry guys,
I'm going to go out.

182
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,270
So.
But yeah,

183
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:56,720
it was crazy cool.
Seeing rock back and he killed it.

184
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,180
Dude.
Brock Lesnar beat a world.

185
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:01,790
Barack Obama like a world class 
heavyweight.

186
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,520
How dare you.
I'm just asking a question guy.

187
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,350
Yeah.
He beat a world class heavyweight.

188
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:07,823
It's crazy.
Beat Mark Hunt mean he fucking 

189
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,124
legitimately mark beat Mark Hunt.
He avoided getting knocked down on his 

190
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:15,110
feet.
He took them down to fucking gorilla.

191
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,440
He took him down like nobody can you 
watch him take,

192
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,030
wanted to take Mark Hunt down and you're
like,

193
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,770
Jesus,
who's stopping that?

194
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,390
How are you stopping that?
He just,

195
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,090
his horsepower is just so insane.
When he gets a hold of a judge,

196
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:27,924
it's just boom and he's taking them down
because Mark Hunt is a difficult guy to 

197
00:08:32,331 --> 00:08:36,110
take down and Mark Hunt is all of 265 
pounds.

198
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:40,100
He's a big fucking guy.
So for brock to do that to him that way,

199
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,950
Jesus Christ,
he's,

200
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,530
he's,
I could probably tell you,

201
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,373
is that what a good example of somebody 
that doesn't supposedly you steroids to 

202
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,120
look,
that guy's a monster.

203
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,260
His muscles are crazy.
And supposedly he got tested,

204
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:54,640
right?
Yeah.

205
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,473
He got for this fight.
He got tested five times within a very 

206
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:00,294
short period of time,
but let's just be completely honest in 

207
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,460
the nature of a,
uh,

208
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,120
open discourse when you look at someone 
and they're jacked as fucked,

209
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,360
it could easily be genetics because 
there are girls that have giant tits for

210
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:17,570
no reason,
like size,

211
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,770
double e tits,
and you're like,

212
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,670
what the hell?

213
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,503
And they're 100 percent natural.
And then there's some girls that are 

214
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,840
just,
they don't have very large boobs,

215
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,663
girls besides you.
There's a lot of people out there that 

216
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:29,580
have this,
this thing going on,

217
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,860
this task or this is just a giant 
difference between human shapes.

218
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:35,743
Right?
And so there are people that are built 

219
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:39,270
like that.
My friend Sidley as a buddy of mine from

220
00:09:39,271 --> 00:09:40,104
a back in Boston,
he was shocked and he didn't even lift 

221
00:09:42,841 --> 00:09:43,674
weights.
He's just Jamaican kid that I was 

222
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,770
friends with.
Oh my God,

223
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:51,210
he was fucking,
he was ridiculously yoked and he barely,

224
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,383
he barely worked out.
I mean he did like a kickboxing things 

225
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:57,050
and some pushups,
maybe not.

226
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,933
He was never lifting weights.
Like he was just doing martial arts 

227
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,950
stuff and he was jacked.
My brother Charlie was like,

228
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:03,784
that.
Always muscly up until like two years 

229
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:06,120
ago has changed.

230
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,590
Don't tell him I said that.
Oh,

231
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,663
I'll get pissed.
You hear that little kid to listen to a 

232
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,870
podcast.
You know the little kid,

233
00:10:12,871 --> 00:10:14,960
a little muscle kid.
That was super kid.

234
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,563
Have you seen him now?
He works at Universal Studios as in the 

235
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:23,400
water world exhibit and now he's just 
normal.

236
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,350
Normal.
Kind of has a beer gut now.

237
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:29,580
Like he stopped lifting because he said 
it was boring man.

238
00:10:29,581 --> 00:10:30,414
Well this wasn't a case of then they 
alleged that his parents had had him on 

239
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:35,730
steroids.
Probably staring.

240
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,640
That's awful.
It's really sad.

241
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:41,040
If that's the same store that I'm 
thinking about,

242
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,700
I think there's been more than one of 
those like little yoke dudes.

243
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,193
I know this is one little yoke dude that
had a genetic disorder that cows have 

244
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:55,590
some times and those whippet dogs have 
sometimes we had to.

245
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,490
Have you ever seen that?

246
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:59,160
The whip it dogs and get the double 
muscle disorder?

247
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,800
No,
my dog was lazy,

248
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:03,330
but she was a little bit.
It's different.

249
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,940
Just assume if they have the extra 
muscle,

250
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:06,870
they'd be more with,
oh,

251
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:10,460
there's this thing that happens to 
whippets and some cows that's called.

252
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,760
It's called a myostatin inhibitor and a 
milestone staten inhibitor.

253
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:18,100
Apparently it regulates the amount of 
muscle tissue,

254
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,080
the carry around with you.
So when these whippets get it,

255
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,480
they look like the hulk.
They look fake.

256
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,920
They look like a movie.
See,

257
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,043
I've seen pictures of it.
Pull up a photo of a whippet mio staten 

258
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,510
Tibbott her dog.
You know how to spell that.

259
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,720
But apparently there's a boy in Germany,
at least one kid that's confirm that was

260
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:43,020
born with this disorder.
So he's really young,

261
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:43,854
but he's jacked.
He's just fucking super yolked Baby 

262
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,413
Jack.
This is what the men look at their 

263
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:54,400
faith.
So like really weird.

264
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,350
They're usually a very slender dog.
Very kangaroo looking.

265
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,360
Yeah,
to kangaroo.

266
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,194
Scare the fuck out of me now.
It's like all the sudden they started 

267
00:12:04,481 --> 00:12:07,690
getting jacked up.
We're in.

268
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,020
When I was a kid,
when I was a kid.

269
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,820
Yeah,
they definitely live chat.

270
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,470
They looked like they were like fucking 
school teachers,

271
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:21,010
like they were newspaper reporters or 
something,

272
00:12:21,011 --> 00:12:24,750
or like a librarian.
It didn't look like these yoke monsters.

273
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,700
You see the one that's knocking on the 
window of the person's house like,

274
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,380
I want to come in.
Have you seen that video yet?

275
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,710
Man?
Knocking on the door.

276
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,150
Look at them.
Come on.

277
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,480
Look how big that thing is.
That's their big.

278
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,393
Yeah,
look at that.

279
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,450
They're like,
what in the what in the fuck is that?

280
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,320
That's fake.
No kidding.

281
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,180
I've seen it live.
So what the Hell's going on?

282
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,360
Do you think they have that extra muscle
thing like you said,

283
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:55,220
taking Dick Pills,
steroids and dick pill.

284
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,930
What a fucking bizarre animal that is.
That is amazing.

285
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,190
Bouncy mammo that will kick you and try 
to hurt you.

286
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,860
Fuck you up.
No,

287
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:04,161
no,
no,

288
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:04,451
no,
no,

289
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:04,811
no,
no,

290
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,980
no.
They're not always nice.

291
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,003
Feed them.
I fit.

292
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,873
I felt the big guys.
You got to be really careful around 

293
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,480
that.
Real.

294
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,540
Is that a real post?
They say though,

295
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,700
they say though that if you find them in
the wild,

296
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:22,060
you are not supposed to ever approach.
While this was a beating off,

297
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,180
is that.
Can you repeat?

298
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,430
No,
no son we saw to having sex.

299
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:28,743
Oh,
the video though that it's kind of went 

300
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:31,894
around last week is a kangaroo seeing 
its reflection in somebody's window and 

301
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,304
it's trying to fight it so.
But the guys on the other side with the 

302
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,910
camera,
it's just as jacked.

303
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,530
Like kangaroo,
like punching the window.

304
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,500
Like it's scary.
Oh my gosh.

305
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:44,321
Video.
Yeah.

306
00:13:44,321 --> 00:13:45,940
It's one of the coolest video that came 
out last week.

307
00:13:45,941 --> 00:13:46,774
If you just type in a kangaroo,
a window fist fighting himself in a 

308
00:13:49,241 --> 00:13:51,670
window,
shadowboxing a window.

309
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,460
That's a weird animal.
I love them.

310
00:13:54,461 --> 00:13:57,270
I think they're great,
but it's so weird what it does though.

311
00:13:57,271 --> 00:14:02,271
The way it acts that sits on its tail,
it's bouncing around these legs and then

312
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:06,130
it's got those jagged upper body.
They were.

313
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,900
There was like a.
They get spooked.

314
00:14:07,901 --> 00:14:11,230
Easy to like this one big one was trying
to have sex.

315
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,300
I'm going to say it wasn't sex.
It was definitely rape,

316
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,630
but it was like he was pulling her back 
and she was trying to get away,

317
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,290
but there was a reason she was trying to
get away because there was like a weird.

318
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,690
When come they want to kill him.
They all scattered.

319
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:25,180
Then they went under the tree and then 
they got into it and I was like,

320
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,100
oh,
maybe she just wanted some privacy or.

321
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:30,400
That was really interesting how they had
to sneak out,

322
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,670
but she was scared and then as soon as 
this weird thing came,

323
00:14:33,671 --> 00:14:34,504
it was like a wind.
They all went scattered and then they 

324
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,700
got back into.
It was exciting.

325
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:41,023
Kinga.
Yeah,

326
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,360
this is it.
This is so scary.

327
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,080
So knock on the door.
That one's not too jacked.

328
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,150
Boy.
It's creepy though.

329
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,750
Oh my God.

330
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,680
What's this?
And he starts getting pissed.

331
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:57,080
You scratched my window.
My window.

332
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:03,190
This is the right video or maybe a 
mirror.

333
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh my God.
He's throwing himself at the window.

334
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,210
Fuck man.
He's trying to themselves.

335
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:16,520
Oh,
he's trying to fight.

336
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,580
What he sees as a reflection in the 
window at your house is a creepy animal.

337
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,400
Now they're beautiful.
But they don't eat meat.

338
00:15:28,401 --> 00:15:29,750
Right?
Those are herbivores.

339
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,820
You got got me.
They let us feed them some weird shit.

340
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,723
What was it lacking is protein.
So it smelled terrible and it was a 

341
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,370
little like look like little pills.
Pellet thinks.

342
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,111
Well,
you know,

343
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,320
gorillas don't eat meat.
Really?

344
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,010
Just grasses.
Yeah,

345
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:52,850
they're 100 percent vegetarian.
It's why they're so gentle.

346
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,880
Oh Wow.
Okay.

347
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,440
Here's the herbivores.
The grasses,

348
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,350
flowers,
leaves,

349
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:58,610
ferns,
Moss,

350
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:00,140
and even insects.
Interesting.

351
00:16:00,141 --> 00:16:00,974
Like cows,
Kangaroos regurgitate their food and 

352
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:05,090
read through it before it's ready to be 
totally digested.

353
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,953
Juvenile kangaroo reviews the outside 
world from the Pouch of adult female 

354
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,700
right now.
They've seen Eddie,

355
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,480
if he got,
um,

356
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,110
he got fucking chased by one in 
Australia.

357
00:16:15,111 --> 00:16:15,944
He told the story of how he thought it 
was fake because it was so big because 

358
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:21,470
it was like a fucking seven foot 
kangaroo.

359
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,333
He thought it was fake and he got out of
the car and he was with a bunch of 

360
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,573
Australians and he starts walking 
towards it and his friend go and his 

361
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:37,710
friends stopped him and he said,
get back in the car and you know,

362
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,430
bad Australian accent.
Pretty Rad,

363
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:40,483
right?

364
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,700
So the dude ran back,
Eddie ran back to the car and apparently

365
00:16:46,701 --> 00:16:48,800
this fucking kangaroo is going to go 
after them.

366
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,330
Like this giant kangaroo is like,
if you go too close to them,

367
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,343
if they think you're a threatened,
they probably been fucked with people 

368
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,253
unless they were in captivity.
Like where I went to see them chasing a 

369
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:04,460
golf court after golfers on Jurassic 
Park.

370
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,030
Never do that.
Here's my point to that thing.

371
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:10,040
Ate Meat.
We'd be Foxville.

372
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,860
Imagine if there was like a bunch of 
them and they ate meat.

373
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:15,020
There were predators bouncing.
We'd kill them.

374
00:17:15,021 --> 00:17:15,950
We'd have to kill them.
Right?

375
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,810
Don't have to kill.
I don't want to fight you.

376
00:17:17,811 --> 00:17:20,150
Is that why they are like,
oh,

377
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:23,670
I feel like fighting tonight,
Jack Ufc Kenga roles.

378
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,330
Why don't they that they're just a 
preference.

379
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:28,400
Like do they ever cross the line and go,
you know what,

380
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:31,130
I'm just going to eat this,
this bird right now because I'm hungry.

381
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
Maybe have to cross to them.
Well,

382
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:34,640
Kangaroos,
I dunno if they.

383
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:37,890
Birds with cows.
Do cows eat birds where they find them?

384
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,730
If they find them on the ground,
they eat nesting birds.

385
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:43,460
The birds a fall out in the fall on the 
ground.

386
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,323
That dog had a debt burden.
His mouth when we're home a couple of 

387
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:47,790
weeks ago.
That's normal though,

388
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:48,624
right?
With dogs like was a at these people's 

389
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:51,324
house in Montana and they had this cat 
and his fucking cat at a graveyard in 

390
00:17:54,601 --> 00:17:56,790
front of his house.
They bring their monsters.

391
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,740
This cat had brought in like two or 
three birds dead birds.

392
00:18:01,741 --> 00:18:02,574
Now.
This little tiny sparrows and shit 

393
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:04,403
because there's two barnyard cats.
It just wandering around Jack and 

394
00:18:06,631 --> 00:18:08,160
things.
Are you a cat guy?

395
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,770
I love dogs too though.
I love.

396
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,663
Yeah,
that's right.

397
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:12,503
But I love them all.
I don't know if I could do cats too 

398
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:15,624
sneaky.

399
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,210
They're just getting by.
See this as well.

400
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,310
This cows Keaton chases after them too.
Man.

401
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,144
It's not just simply that it aided by 
accident because one of them were these 

402
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:29,760
other birds or dive bombing on his head 
on her head,

403
00:18:29,761 --> 00:18:33,930
I should say it's girl and as they're 
dive bombing on her head,

404
00:18:33,931 --> 00:18:37,260
she's just slowly but surely like 
chasing after this little bird that fell

405
00:18:37,261 --> 00:18:39,270
on the ground.
Then she wants up jacking it in front of

406
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,104
it's,
you know,

407
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,680
health ones July that that's what they 
do to me.

408
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:44,783
You know,
bowls only eat grass too and bowls like 

409
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:49,614
a bowl.
Bowls are super fucking crazy 

410
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,060
aggressive.
They think of that have put some shit on

411
00:18:54,061 --> 00:18:57,210
the grass now.
They've always been crazy.

412
00:18:57,211 --> 00:19:00,000
That's why people would ride bulls 
because you have to be an asshole.

413
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,630
So I just some famous bull rider,
he or bold guy,

414
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,583
matthew door,
you can see the new things where they 

415
00:19:06,241 --> 00:19:07,074
put the,
the big balls around them and they run 

416
00:19:09,961 --> 00:19:13,910
around and let them,
right?

417
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,600
They.
No,

418
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:14,911
no,
no,

419
00:19:14,911 --> 00:19:15,744
no.
He's talking about something totally 

420
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,220
different.
There's a new.

421
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,620
There's some thing that people are doing
now and have you seen it?

422
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:20,454
They get into like a ball.
You climb into a ball and you like 

423
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,820
bouncing into each other and you could 
sort of run and collide into each other.

424
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:27,960
That's awesome.
Have you done it?

425
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,290
No.
No,

426
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,030
no.
But they're doing it with bowls.

427
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,680
Okay.
That's a little stupid.

428
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,030
Crazy.
Can't they poke a hole in it?

429
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,390
No.
No I can't.

430
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,253
I guess they can.
They say they have like the kind of 

431
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:43,100
horns that I've been poking part is 
those rubber tips on the end of them.

432
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:48,210
You got to put like a little,
a little super ball tennis ball on it.

433
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,830
Fuck man.
No.

434
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,673
Because we have um,
what's that place with the trampolines 

435
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,760
lyric?
See these people,

436
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,623
they get these balls on that to me,
seems that you're going to blow your 

437
00:19:57,671 --> 00:19:59,630
fucking acl out click.

438
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,170
You can still hit you in the Dick.
Oh my God.

439
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,090
It's covered.
These people are easy.

440
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:08,980
What is happening here?
Oh my God.

441
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:10,150
I can't believe they're going to do 
this.

442
00:20:10,151 --> 00:20:11,750
Okay.
Okay.

443
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,290
So they're standing out here.
I got to see.

444
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,943
And they all have these balls on and 
they just released the bowl and it's 

445
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,570
just running around kicking.
This is more than one bowl.

446
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,800
Oh,
Jesus Collides and oh dude.

447
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,870
Oh my God.
You could get trampled.

448
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,730
Forget that.
This is crazy.

449
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,680
This is a terrible idea.
Look at that guy.

450
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:33,790
He's like,
oh my God.

451
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,040
He's running away.
Which is amazing.

452
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,420
Well,
he's lucky he's alive.

453
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,660
He's certainly lucky that he had gone 
through the asshole.

454
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,950
That bull could easily like this for 
what?

455
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,670
People listening.
This ball is small.

456
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,310
It's from the waist up.
His entire

457
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,280
legs are exposed.
They should've have had it,

458
00:20:51,281 --> 00:20:53,380
so they're all.
You're in the ball completely.

459
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,750
Oh my God.
He got hit in the midsection.

460
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,910
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

461
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:01,030
This is terrible.
Oh my God.

462
00:21:01,031 --> 00:21:06,031
This is.
Oh my God.

463
00:21:07,001 --> 00:21:08,410
It did deflated.
Oh,

464
00:21:08,411 --> 00:21:09,710
for sure.
Got Deflated.

465
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,180
Says it got bent too,
and I think the guy's dead.

466
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:18,780
He's not moving your time to go see.
You got to wake up.

467
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:26,410
Soon as he took the.
He took the thing off.

468
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,050
He doesn't even have it on the bulls out
there like,

469
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,300
oh fuck.
Yeah.

470
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:35,080
I would play that game in that little 
trampoline thing.

471
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,410
That's the only place to do it.
What the fuck is it that we love this,

472
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,450
like part of us,
like here,

473
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,270
honestly,
we're looking,

474
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,260
we're watching something fucking 
ridiculous.

475
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,210
We're watching it from the point of 
like,

476
00:21:46,211 --> 00:21:47,950
we're like,
oh man,

477
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,120
this is crazy.

478
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,460
I can't believe they do this.
Like mid air.

479
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
Come on.
What is this like?

480
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,680
Why are we so attracted to this?
Okay.

481
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,410
It is weird that we're attracted to it,
but think of a guy mid air with his legs

482
00:22:02,411 --> 00:22:05,500
spread Eagle and he's about to land on a
bull.

483
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,900
You know what I mean?
Like what's going through his head?

484
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,850
We're watching.
He's a little slower than we are.

485
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,560
He probably felt like if it's a thing,
it's okay.

486
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,840
I could do this.
People feel like if it's a thing,

487
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:20,883
you know what I'm saying?
Like if there's a thing that people do 

488
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:25,480
and other people do it what it could do 
it.

489
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,470
It's a thing.
You put the fucking.

490
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,400
He might be the first group.
He might be one of the first tasters.

491
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,330
Yeah.
What if they were like,

492
00:22:34,331 --> 00:22:35,860
oh,
we're testing something out.

493
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:37,870
Can you come test this out for us?

494
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,910
Would you be our Guinea pig?
Did you do it?

495
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,620
Fuck that.
No,

496
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:42,454
I mean,
which is ironic because I hosted fear 

497
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,090
factor,
but no,

498
00:22:46,091 --> 00:22:46,924
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't want to have anything to do 

499
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:48,820
with anything like that.
That's crazy.

500
00:22:48,821 --> 00:22:49,654
It needs to be bigger and used to be 
where you're inside the ball and it 

501
00:22:51,671 --> 00:22:54,670
needs to be like a stronger material and
then it'd be okay.

502
00:22:54,671 --> 00:22:56,580
I think pretty strong material,
but here's.

503
00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,040
There's bull horns coming out.
Here's the problem with that.

504
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,200
Here's how I see it.
People I think vastly overestimate their

505
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:10,201
ability to move their body vastly and 
they think when that ball's going,

506
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,630
I'll just fucking go with it and I'll 
just fucking,

507
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,473
you know,
we still going to be looking at fake 

508
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,120
them out backfield.
That bull comes on you so fast.

509
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:23,650
Yeah.
It's a bad quote right there.

510
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,023
Got excited.
I don't know that anybody else thinking 

511
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:33,260
I'm going to get into this fight.
When you see that bull launch,

512
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:34,630
that dude into the air,
you can.

513
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:38,080
I guarantee you that guy at that moment 
when he was flying was like,

514
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,280
oh no,
I fucked up.

515
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,100
Oh yeah,
yeah.

516
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,160
This is not what I felt like.
This is.

517
00:23:42,161 --> 00:23:43,990
Wait,
this was not in the brochure.

518
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:47,530
You can't control.
You can't control this guy.

519
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,663
That guy probably didn't think before or
after or during these rides is a dumb 

520
00:23:52,321 --> 00:23:55,430
ass.
He's probably one of those.

521
00:23:55,431 --> 00:23:57,110
I don't give a fuck dude.
Hey Man.

522
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,440
I'm crazy.
I to tell you what I'll do.

523
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:02,600
I'll climate side of that phone with 
that bolt hit me.

524
00:24:02,601 --> 00:24:04,400
I don't give a fuck.
You could shoot an apple off my head.

525
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,960
Dude.
I'm scared to die.

526
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,070
If my granddad was an Indian hundred 
percent Apache broke,

527
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,370
I got that warrior blood.

528
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:16,520
I don't give a fuck what I gotta do what
I gotTa do.

529
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,354
Shit.
I'll be the first in line first in the 

530
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:20,224
lab.
You see the brain's slipping out of 

531
00:24:22,191 --> 00:24:24,320
their skull.
Bad knees fucked up.

532
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,030
Farmers back.
I don't give a fuck.

533
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,310
It's in there.
There's a lot of those dudes.

534
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:31,010
Fear factor thing.
I would do it just for the money.

535
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:34,190
I would only do the stunts.
I couldn't do the food.

536
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,520
I mean I can barely a regular 
restaurant.

537
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,570
You could have got lucky.
Some people got there.

538
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:43,571
Was it was no parody like as far as like
how difficult things were on some shows?

539
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:44,564
There were.
I mean it was always totally random 

540
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:47,030
what,
what you got what you had to eat.

541
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,150
But some of it was easy.
Like roaches are easy.

542
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:50,930
No,
no.

543
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,100
I'm telling you,
roaches,

544
00:24:52,101 --> 00:24:52,910
d,
they don't.

545
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,800
They barely tastes like anything.

546
00:24:55,550 --> 00:24:59,090
We ate those like,
you know what I mean?

547
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:03,850
Like so picky.
It was a joke in there somewhere,

548
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,880
you know,
comes on you.

549
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,110
And Boom,
here we are full circle.

550
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,330
I'm telling you,
but it's all in your head because if you

551
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:16,040
eat crabs,
you're eating the same thing.

552
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,810
They're like a crab.
Oh,

553
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:22,890
you want me to see for the worst fear 
factor to me is like a Swedish fish.

554
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,610
If you really needed the money and you 
were there,

555
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,350
I looked at the other people you're with
and you're like,

556
00:25:30,351 --> 00:25:33,320
I'm not going to let these pussies beat 
me crazy.

557
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:35,480
Yeah.
I'm a little competitive but not.

558
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,360
I don't know if I could beat that 
competitive,

559
00:25:38,361 --> 00:25:41,360
like letting everybody see me,
shit my pants right.

560
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:42,194
That.
Because that would probably go right 

561
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:44,120
through me.
That's what I'm afraid of,

562
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,340
like I would throw up or something 
awful.

563
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,203
Do you think you have an allergy to 
weird foods or is it just you're just 

564
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,070
thinking.
I'm just a little retarded.

565
00:25:53,170 --> 00:25:55,860
I know not to say that word.
Sorry to hear.

566
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,880
This is a retard free zone on facebook 
that people do that people are angry.

567
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,423
It's just go outside.
Consumer sent me a list of words to say 

568
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,330
other than that,
how crazy is that?

569
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:10,263
So whatever the language police,
they're out there and they kind of pull 

570
00:26:13,341 --> 00:26:16,340
you over and give you a ticket and they 
feel really good about it.

571
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,190
I don't like what you're saying.
I don't like how you're saying it.

572
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,210
Intent is not as critical as the actual 
words that come out of your mouth to add

573
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,320
the language.
Police,

574
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,230
I will punch in the face that you hit 
them.

575
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:32,630
Physical language police,
not a regular police.

576
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:33,890
I don't do that.
I'm not crazy.

577
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,270
I'm just.
I'm not.

578
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,213
I'm pro everybody.
I think everybody should learn to 

579
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:39,734
behave,
but if a language that they're 

580
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,250
misbehaving to me,
the language police

581
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,550
so they get punched in the face.
Maybe I am a little violent.

582
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,740
I apologize.
That's the punch.

583
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,900
I do love to punch.
Isn't that terrible?

584
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,793
Punching people.
You're.

585
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,050
You're like one of those walk by the 
punch people in the alarm.

586
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,370
In my house.
It's an insane asylum.

587
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:03,450
If there was 10 of us in a row home.
So I have six brothers.

588
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,880
I woke up every day to a punch in the 
face,

589
00:27:05,881 --> 00:27:07,530
you know,
other stuff,

590
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:10,770
whatever you dick to the failure of 
tolerance.

591
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:12,780
You grew up with like a lot of tolerance
for bullshit.

592
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,760
So your patient,
you're thin,

593
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,190
you know,
I mean your skin gets.

594
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:18,024
Then I can't have thick thicker if you 
have like I have one niece that was a 

595
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:26,290
little thin skinned and then my brothers
just beat that out of her poor thing.

596
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,620
She didn't know what she was getting 
into.

597
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:30,211
We were like,
oh,

598
00:27:30,211 --> 00:27:31,044
are you sensitive?

599
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:34,380
Come over here for a second.
And then now she's cool now.

600
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,641
Now she's like,
oh,

601
00:27:35,641 --> 00:27:39,110
I get it.
But it's stupid to be sensitive.

602
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,220
Well,
how much could your parents have control

603
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:43,140
you think?
So many of you.

604
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,800
Especially because my parents split up 
so.

605
00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:48,660
So when I was like eight,
they split up,

606
00:27:48,661 --> 00:27:50,490
so it was like,
oh shit,

607
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,310
it's on now.
Like they can't catch me now.

608
00:27:53,311 --> 00:27:54,144
But that wasn't true because my dad's a 
marine and he only moved like five 

609
00:27:56,581 --> 00:27:58,170
blocks away,
so any new,

610
00:27:58,171 --> 00:28:00,330
every cop in the neighborhood.
So if I,

611
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:05,460
if I did anything he knew the next day 
or he'd see me,

612
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:07,890
he'd be out and see me and I'd be like,
Oh shit.

613
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,200
But I was afraid of my dad,
like,

614
00:28:10,201 --> 00:28:11,730
are you guys,
I'm still afraid of my dad.

615
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,700
He's 80 every once in a while be like,
Hey dad,

616
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,680
you,
you know,

617
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,660
you shouldn't do that,
you know,

618
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:18,503
but I still backed.

619
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,320
Well he's crazy.
But even today you couldn't get upset at

620
00:28:22,321 --> 00:28:23,460
him and talk to them.
Like personal,

621
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:24,270
personal.
No,

622
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,820
I had a fight with.
I talked to him.

623
00:28:26,821 --> 00:28:27,654
I,
I call them because I use them for 

624
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:31,410
material and you know,
he just gives gems,

625
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,273
you know what I mean?
Like now he lives in Rehobeth beach 

626
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:34,574
cheats.
Retires,

627
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:39,030
it's in Delaware and it's um,
it's a predominantly gay area.

628
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:43,080
My Dad's a marine,
like covered in tattoos.

629
00:28:43,081 --> 00:28:45,490
He still wears his dog tags because they
like to jerk off to.

630
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,580
Yes,
he did not know that.

631
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,660
Now he knows that and he also had.
He refers to lesbians.

632
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:52,800
It's girl faggots.
I'm like,

633
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,840
that's not what they are,
and then I'm like,

634
00:28:57,841 --> 00:28:58,674
they're lesbians and he's like,
I don't care what were there from the 

635
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,650
UFC has an openly gay women's 
bantamweight champion.

636
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,330
Oh my God.
That's awesome.

637
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,500
Yeah,
she's a beast to.

638
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,073
I would say at the UFC.
One thing I love about him is that the 

639
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:14,400
women are just as good.
Amanda Nunez,

640
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,740
she's the new champ.
She knocked out of me.

641
00:29:17,741 --> 00:29:20,090
She stopped doing the first round was 
free.

642
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,700
I only saw the highlights,
but great fight.

643
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,400
She's awesome.
She's awesome.

644
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,890
She's so fast.
She's like lightening fast.

645
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,110
Her hands are so explosive.
Like she's.

646
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,270
She's so hard to get to.
He,

647
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,173
she's one of those girls that she's like
a sprinter and like in the third and 

648
00:29:34,301 --> 00:29:35,134
fourth and fifth round,
that's when she's going to have a hard 

649
00:29:36,761 --> 00:29:39,100
time because he blows out so much.
But see,

650
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:41,800
she takes people out like she's very 
good.

651
00:29:41,801 --> 00:29:45,520
Like from standing and on the ground as 
well or Jujitsu is really good,

652
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,623
but she's so explosive.
The only worry or concern that people 

653
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:51,940
have is that I wonder if she can sustain
that level,

654
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,690
but to fight like that.
Anybody.

655
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,770
She's incredible,
but it's really,

656
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:57,604
it's really interesting because she has 
had fights where she kind of faded in 

657
00:29:59,471 --> 00:30:00,460
the past,
but,

658
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,513
but you've got to get through that storm
that she brings and it's just so she's 

659
00:30:04,801 --> 00:30:06,200
so explosive.

660
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,000
Like I,
it's between her and I mean there's,

661
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:14,500
I don't think anybody moves quite as 
fast as her or our hits quite as hard as

662
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,334
her in that division.
Like there might be girls like Holly 

663
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,770
Holm that might be like a little bit 
more skillful as a strike or a much more

664
00:30:20,771 --> 00:30:24,760
experienced than the striker.
The very few people hit with the kind of

665
00:30:24,761 --> 00:30:29,290
pop that she's got something at watch.
Holly Holm was great.

666
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,560
She's awesome watching her it from the 
get like I wish they had that when I was

667
00:30:35,531 --> 00:30:37,510
a kid.
I think we talked about that before.

668
00:30:37,511 --> 00:30:40,260
Like I definitely would have gotten into
as kit.

669
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,950
I know you would have easily because I 
wouldn't have gotten arrested as much,

670
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:44,784
so it's like easier that way if there's 
another woman's been away that doesn't 

671
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:48,820
get enough credit.
Raquel Pennington.

672
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,760
Oh,
you've seen her.

673
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:52,723
She's good now.

674
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:56,020
I'm not trying to scam me.
Stop me face.

675
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:56,351
I'm like,
oh.

676
00:30:56,351 --> 00:30:58,720
I thought that ferocious.
So very,

677
00:30:58,721 --> 00:30:59,554
very skillful.
She's like on the outside of the very 

678
00:31:01,931 --> 00:31:03,690
top.
She but she's a.

679
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:07,180
she's beaten some really tough people.
I watch and I get jealous.

680
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:12,190
I think I want to get into her.
Holly Holm and her fought Holly Holm,

681
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:16,990
UFC debut and it was a split decision.
Really close fight.

682
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,080
She's.
She's very good and better now than.

683
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,333
Excuse me.
Better now than she was then and that 

684
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,170
she wears a shirt that says rocky 
killers just told me this.

685
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,383
She's got this one submission victory 
where she catches this girl Ashley Evan 

686
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,153
Smith and a bulldog choke and chokes her
unconscious with like one second to go 

687
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,923
in the first round.
Let's go over her neck and she's out 

688
00:31:39,251 --> 00:31:40,084
cold in this puddle of blood was.
It was one of those where you're doing 

689
00:31:43,421 --> 00:31:44,840
commentary like wow.

690
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,850
It was a screamer,
so ridiculous.

691
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,900
But um,
women's Bantam weight division is filled

692
00:31:52,901 --> 00:31:55,360
with fucking killers now.
There's so many good fighters.

693
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:57,190
It's like they're,
they're trading titles.

694
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,700
The main events.
Which title I,

695
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,960
that's a big,
big deal.

696
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:03,070
Women's sports,
you know,

697
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:03,904
they don't.
What's definitely a big deal for the 

698
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,220
biggest paper.
Have you ever.

699
00:32:06,221 --> 00:32:07,054
I mean obviously it wasn't going to be 
of John Jones didn't test positive for 

700
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:13,000
something,
but because he did,

701
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:15,390
it's.
Yeah.

702
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,550
So is he admitted to it yet?
Is he saying what he did?

703
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,720
No,
he's not.

704
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,510
He's not saying anything.
Tailpiece son and leaked the information

705
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:27,100
during my last podcast,
so it's out of it's shell has leaked out

706
00:32:27,101 --> 00:32:28,660
information.
It could be.

707
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:31,360
Is that what he said to me out there?
I had no,

708
00:32:31,361 --> 00:32:34,880
nothing.
I didn't hear anything about.

709
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,943
Honestly,
I'm in a weird position because I don't 

710
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:38,470
think you're supposed to.
I don't think he supposed to.

711
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:40,040
Anybody is supposed to be talking about

712
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,460
the medical results until like it gets 
released.

713
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,290
I don't know how it works.
I really don't.

714
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,730
I'm going to plead ignorance,
right?

715
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,790
I'll plead ignorance all day.
Bridal name.

716
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:53,240
I think he probably took boner pills 
because they have all that shit in them,

717
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,710
you know,
like they have potent pills,

718
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:57,090
have steroids in them.
Boner pills,

719
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:01,700
because I just found Joe's gas station 
over here.

720
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,593
It has like the best.
I've never seen these right on is known 

721
00:33:05,121 --> 00:33:05,954
for his love of the boner pill.
He makes what you would call a boner 

722
00:33:08,631 --> 00:33:09,464
pill contour.
He's actually read blogs about boner 

723
00:33:12,561 --> 00:33:15,860
pills and directed me to reviews of 
boner pills.

724
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,680
Terrifying.
But I mean,

725
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,523
these things have steroids in them.
They have a bunch of stuff and if you 

726
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,960
party wasn't the last thing he got 
busted for cocaine or something.

727
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,580
If you bus,
if you do cocaine,

728
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:28,760
a lot of guys take these because you can
get hard off of having cocaine.

729
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,010
And so if he takes boner pills,
then he's.

730
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:36,020
Gonna is a little too much speculation 
for respect.

731
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,333
And uh,
I'm going to have to step out of this 

732
00:33:38,121 --> 00:33:42,230
conversation.
Neither confirm nor deny.

733
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,100
Take turns into a werewolf.
Starts chasing us around the rope.

734
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,570
It just lays his dick out on the domain.
Oh my God.

735
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:55,860
What would happen?
I don't need,

736
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,270
this one has a Hologram of a rhino and 
he turned it.

737
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,910
It turns into a but at one is 
interesting.

738
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:05,510
Now I'm at the gas station.
How do you know?

739
00:34:05,511 --> 00:34:07,250
What are the good ones and one of the 
bad ones?

740
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,263
How do you know what to take?
I've come to the conclusion that if it 

741
00:34:09,801 --> 00:34:13,250
has a rhinoceros,
it works in.

742
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,930
The great thing if you're,
if you're lucky,

743
00:34:14,931 --> 00:34:15,764
lived in New York City,
New York City has these bodegas 

744
00:34:18,111 --> 00:34:18,944
everywhere.
They all have them and they have older 

745
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:20,924
product which is usually stronger 
because people died from them or like 

746
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:29,580
you're going to have a giant heart on 
caught,

747
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,820
but okay,
we keep talking about this,

748
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,940
but we need to fucking run a test here 
and find out what.

749
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,793
What are you going to take it?
But what I'm thinking about doing is 

750
00:34:37,521 --> 00:34:39,250
taking it to a laboratory.
Oh,

751
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,084
there you find out what's in it,
but I don't want the fucking Chinese 

752
00:34:42,201 --> 00:34:45,890
triad to be asking me like some shitty 
Mickey rourke not.

753
00:34:45,930 --> 00:34:47,420
It shouldn't even say shit.
Look good.

754
00:34:47,421 --> 00:34:50,030
One Year of the Dragon.
That was a great movie.

755
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,400
Just trying to,
I was going for comic effect.

756
00:34:52,401 --> 00:34:55,220
I had to check myself a reality,
but I just.

757
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,530
I mean I don't.
I'm listening.

758
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,840
I'm Pro Rhino,
right?

759
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,940
You want to solve these things.
They work,

760
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,760
they're great.
Just don't take it.

761
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:07,130
The black cat ones or any of the cat 
ones because those ones actually made me

762
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:12,310
see visually and stuff and I think it's 
like blood pressure or something.

763
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:14,714
Maybe it's all fucked up,
so don't take those because that fucks 

764
00:35:16,551 --> 00:35:18,200
with your blood pressure.
Pretty hardcore.

765
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,123
Yeah.
Don't,

766
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,100
don't take risks.
If he tells you don't take it.

767
00:35:22,101 --> 00:35:23,540
Don't take it folks.
Trust me.

768
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,110
I don't care what you think your 
tolerance is.

769
00:35:27,111 --> 00:35:29,510
Eli,
if you think you have the same tolerance

770
00:35:29,511 --> 00:35:31,220
is red band.
You're incorrect.

771
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:32,990
Yeah,
he's got you.

772
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:36,390
What do they get you high like they make
it kind of rage.

773
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,130
They were the ones that have the 
steroids

774
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,110
in them,
which I've found.

775
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,013
I think most of them have steroids and 
you can tell the difference which those 

776
00:35:42,661 --> 00:35:44,760
because you immediately want to fuck 
you.

777
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:46,980
You're not only getting hard.
You're like,

778
00:35:46,981 --> 00:35:49,680
I need to get laid right now.
Will you start with molly?

779
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,190
I know you directed me to a website,
FDA dot Gov,

780
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,173
but one of them that was explaining all 
the different ingredients that were in 

781
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:00,300
these things that a guy broke it down 
and what they do to you.

782
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,373
Oh yeah,
there's a few.

783
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,260
There's a few of those,
but unfortunately that guy doesn't.

784
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,120
He's only talking about what's on the 
back.

785
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,460
Like what they're saying that's in it.
Oh,

786
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,613
testing tested it.
Let's see if anybody's ever actually 

787
00:36:11,971 --> 00:36:14,720
tested what is in boner pills.
They,

788
00:36:14,721 --> 00:36:15,554
they,
they fda tells you everything that's on 

789
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,890
all of them.
You could even look up rhino and you see

790
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:24,150
some older ones on there and they're 
usually steroids and it's usually Viagra

791
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,080
generic.

792
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,561
Oh,
okay.

793
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:29,520
So the FDA has a list of what they 
called them.

794
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:30,354
Write the names,
but what's to stop you from just 

795
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,114
starting to sell something called Rhino 
10 like this is rhino seven like you 

796
00:36:36,201 --> 00:36:38,160
don't have.
I bet they don't own rhino.

797
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,240
The same company actually has like the 
Rhino,

798
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,620
a brand one that you're holding right 
now as I,

799
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,723
I've got all the way up to [inaudible] 
69 and I've had about 20 different 

800
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,320
rhinos,
so they just changed the,

801
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:52,330
the number.
Every time they get in trouble too.

802
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,050
A different one.
Look at this public notification.

803
00:36:55,051 --> 00:37:00,051
My steel woody to contains,
contains hidden drug ingredient.

804
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,673
The Food and Drug Administration is 
advising consumers not to purchase or 

805
00:37:04,351 --> 00:37:05,184
use my steel,
woody a product promoted and sold for 

806
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:10,800
sexual enhancement on various websites 
including blah,

807
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:11,634
blah,
blah.

808
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,533
And possibly some retail stores.
FDI laboratory analysis confirmed that 

809
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:18,750
my steel woody contains select solidify.

810
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:19,321
Oh,
that's,

811
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,700
um,
that's Viagra.

812
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,420
Yeah.
Okay.

813
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,820
It says it's the,
how do you say that word?

814
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,263
A den of Phil Identify Sildenafil.
Is that it says active ingredient in 

815
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,054
Viagara.
So the main ingredient in used to treat 

816
00:37:34,561 --> 00:37:35,394
erectile dysfunction,
the undeclared ingredient may interact 

817
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:38,754
with nitrates.
Found at some prescription drugs such 

818
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:40,940
as.
Well.

819
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,960
Yeah.
So that's like for people who have heart

820
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,794
issues,
when they take like a blood pressure 

821
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:46,464
medication,
if they're taking Viagra at the same 

822
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,080
time,
they could fucking Croak.

823
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:50,723
Or if you have diabetes you don't take,
don't take it because these things will 

824
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,890
fuck you up.
So these mice deal will you guys.

825
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,020
So if you don't cry fuckers.
Oh my God,

826
00:37:58,021 --> 00:37:59,130
hold on,
scroll all the way up.

827
00:37:59,131 --> 00:38:01,170
Go back to the top.
Hold on a second.

828
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:02,463
If the public notifications of how many 
drugs contained or how many of these 

829
00:38:06,691 --> 00:38:09,330
supplements contain drugs.
This is insane.

830
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,090
So public notification ran a seven.
Hold on a second.

831
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,290
Extra contains hidden drug ingredients.
Neil phase,

832
00:38:16,291 --> 00:38:18,740
natural sex enhancer contains a hidden 
dreading group.

833
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:21,190
There's like a list over and over and 
over and over.

834
00:38:21,191 --> 00:38:24,390
And there's so many of them.
Rhino seven renaissance.

835
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,140
Scroll back up rhino seven right now.
Seven blue,

836
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:29,480
9,000.
Look,

837
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,090
there's dryness.
Seven blue,

838
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,260
9,000 is.
I don't know,

839
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,680
they just changed the number

840
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,740
one.
What's the new name?

841
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:45,250
Jon Jones has a headache.
They don't believe you

842
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,890
Jones.
If he did take these,

843
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,310
if he could sue rhino say bullshit.
I got a headache from it.

844
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,290
You say no head,

845
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,020
right?
That's true.

846
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,110
I mean the word is bond.
Millions of dollars.

847
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,570
If it's written on the front of the 
pack,

848
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,920
there's a word is bond that holds true.
This is.

849
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,120
Wow.
I don't know.

850
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,410
Who knows this

851
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:09,760
crazy?
I can't.

852
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:11,243
I just don't understand.
If someone was going to take something 

853
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:14,260
like that,
why wouldn't you take.

854
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,570
Well,
why don't you just take Viagra.

855
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,433
If you knew what's in Viagara,
like if you're going to get Viagara you 

856
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,100
get a prescription for that.
I'll tell you what man.

857
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,530
I mean you can get it on the street,
but you can get anything on the street,

858
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,190
but I mean

859
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,200
it shows now a lot of guys giving me 
Viagra that's like,

860
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,320
Hey Brian,
instead of giving me,

861
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:33,030
we'd.
They'll just give me a biography,

862
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,060
but I try it now.
It's not even close.

863
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,230
Not even close to that.

864
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,260
It's not even close to them

865
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,360
like this.
This little store bought the rhino seven

866
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:46,990
way better than a Viagra or any of the 
car.

867
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,313
So it's what you think is probably like 
steroids and maybe like amphetamines or 

868
00:39:50,691 --> 00:39:51,940
something.
He'd swole,

869
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:57,070
it swells up,
which he sold his Dick.

870
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,910
Like one of them.
I'm like,

871
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,060
wow,
I could sell it.

872
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:07,580
The uncle Steve,
will you take one of these?

873
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,550
We take one of these home and take one 
and that doesn't seem like a good idea.

874
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,783
I just,
I don't know what the fuck is in those 

875
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:13,424
things dude.
I'm not into taking some mystery drug 

876
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,910
from.
You just saw the list of everything that

877
00:40:17,911 --> 00:40:20,510
made that shit on an island somewhere in
the South Pacific.

878
00:40:20,511 --> 00:40:22,730
They have slaves.
We push those out.

879
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,250
I mean,
who knows what the difference is?

880
00:40:25,251 --> 00:40:26,084
Batch to batch.
There's no quality control like this is 

881
00:40:28,881 --> 00:40:31,010
the wild west shit in your body.

882
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,830
You are you really good at like 
everything you put in your body,

883
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:38,460
you know what it is and what goes in as 
much as you can,

884
00:40:38,461 --> 00:40:40,700
but if you eat at restaurants you don't 
really know.

885
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,330
You're right.
I'm the worst.

886
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:44,070
I'm.
Do you eat everything?

887
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,260
No.
Don't need for anything,

888
00:40:46,261 --> 00:40:47,094
but I eat shitty food.
I mean like eat whatever you want to 

889
00:40:49,651 --> 00:40:50,484
say.
Everything I know you don't eat seafood 

890
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:51,550
at all,
right?

891
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:51,960
Yeah.
No,

892
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,793
I don't like seafood,
but you eat like a monster or a great 

893
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,570
metabolism.
You've always had a crazy metabolism,

894
00:40:57,750 --> 00:41:00,720
but I like candy.
Like I'd eat Swedish fish and think,

895
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:01,583
oh,
I had fish for dinner and what I mean 

896
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:04,500
like I love candy,
stuff like that.

897
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:08,060
Cake cookies while I'm at it took a 
boner pill.

898
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,810
You feel uncomfortable?
No.

899
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,030
One of those.
I wonder.

900
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,970
That's what we should put on there.
I'll tell you what happens next and they

901
00:41:14,971 --> 00:41:17,190
give me shit.
Wait a minute.

902
00:41:17,191 --> 00:41:18,030
That came out wrong.

903
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,320
So somebody gave me a Viagra or cialis 
was the blue one.

904
00:41:23,321 --> 00:41:26,410
I think that's a Viagra and I didn't 
know when to take it,

905
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:30,130
so I put it in my Zantex container.
Zantac is for heartburn,

906
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,990
Xanax,
Zantac,

907
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,590
Zantac.
I was like,

908
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:33,980
Oh yeah,
no,

909
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,980
I don't want to fly with this pill in my
pockets.

910
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,030
I'm just putting my Zantac for God.
I did that.

911
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,370
My girlfriend took it by mistake 
thinking Zantac and she said that she.

912
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,640
She did.
She felt weird,

913
00:41:43,641 --> 00:41:46,160
like I like felt tingly and stuff like 
that,

914
00:41:46,161 --> 00:41:50,910
but it didn't do anything but it looks 
like Zantac.

915
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:53,270
Imagine if she went to work and got 
popped for steroids,

916
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:55,183
you know,
if she had a job at ups or something 

917
00:41:56,211 --> 00:41:58,940
like that,
and navigate your urine sample,

918
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,650
well this is.
You're wasting your time here.

919
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:03,530
I didn't even smoke pot.
Your pants were swelling up.

920
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,020
Whoa.
They get it back.

921
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:10,080
Your employees on fucking hardcore 
steroids pitches tweak and terrible.

922
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,340
Had a horse's foot.
I mean it was just.

923
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,320
She said,
she said it was kind of tingly,

924
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,790
not a moose knuckle but a horse's foot.

925
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,470
It was gone.
Like this.

926
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,140
Moose knuckle is a weird.
That's a good one.

927
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,040
That is a fun thing to say.
Yeah.

928
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,490
You know,
it's like if you don't,

929
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,710
if you don't think that Moose knuckle is
funny,

930
00:42:33,711 --> 00:42:35,780
it's because you're avoiding humor.
I agree.

931
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,960
You're avoiding opportunities to learn.
Not a good person at heart.

932
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,273
He really aren't.
You should check yourself all the way 

933
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:45,130
through at all the animals.
Portland,

934
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,711
Moose.
I mean,

935
00:42:45,711 --> 00:42:47,630
how many people actually see a moose 
knuckle?

936
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:51,350
Know what that looks like.
We had to have photos before it became a

937
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:53,540
moose knuckle because it's not like 
that.

938
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,680
Many people see a moose.

939
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:02,640
That's a total loser.
That is a guy only on paper.

940
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,980
On paper.
You're right.

941
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,800
But think about it like before 
traveling,

942
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,620
like I bet they would never call it 
moose knuckle in the 18 hundreds because

943
00:43:12,621 --> 00:43:15,080
they didn't have any pictures.
They had to see a moose.

944
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,460
Moose.
Women weren't allowed to wear pants that

945
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,470
too,
but like for the longest time.

946
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:25,790
So that's like an expression that we can
prove like did not exist before the.

947
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:30,820
Because if you lived in New York in like
1830 and you said,

948
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,030
oh,
so your moose knuckle.

949
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:32,893
They'd be like,
what the fuck does a Moose knuckle look 

950
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:35,960
like?
I don't even know what.

951
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,853
They don't have a photo.
Where would they look at a drawing with 

952
00:43:38,621 --> 00:43:39,454
them and what they used to call it,
like a slave foot or maybe you loose 

953
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,980
walking around because they weren't made
up back then,

954
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,110
but I don't think there were that many 
that you would see them.

955
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:52,030
If you live in a city like New York City
lived in Maine,

956
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,730
you're like,
Oh,

957
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,850
you're just walking through my 
neighborhood.

958
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:58,400
How many Moose though?
See it's not native to that much.

959
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:00,890
It doesn't have a large range in North 
America.

960
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,010
It's got like the northern states.
Colorado,

961
00:44:04,011 --> 00:44:06,050
Maine has moose,
New Hampshire.

962
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,213
I remember seeing a sign watch out for 
the boost because they walk at their 

963
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:11,720
real tall.
He hit your car.

964
00:44:11,721 --> 00:44:13,880
Could hit him or something.
I was terrified.

965
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,550
It was the creepiest longest drive I've 
ever did.

966
00:44:16,551 --> 00:44:18,820
They're scary because you die when you 
hit one of those.

967
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,103
Those those things kill people.
But then dear to deer deer kill 200 

968
00:44:26,211 --> 00:44:29,090
people a year in car accidents in just 
the United States.

969
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:31,950
There was a ton I saw in Jersey a couple
of weeks ago.

970
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,130
I didn't.
I didn't see deer.

971
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:38,250
I just saw the signs,
but there was more than I've ever seen.

972
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:39,240
Yeah,
they're everywhere.

973
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:41,820
Everybody was talking about deers and 
I'm like,

974
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,550
what?
And people looked.

975
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:47,340
It's because our predators.
You've gotten rid of all the predators.

976
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:48,713
Oh yeah.
Well let's just let some fucking hyenas 

977
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:51,474
and mountain lions,
Louis take out all the back pain is a 

978
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,780
mountain lions around your kids.
You fucking whack people are crazy.

979
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:02,220
I mean,
I,

980
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,410
I love crazy,
but at the same time they.

981
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,320
They're going a little too far with the 
crazy these days.

982
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,320
Don't you think like as a comedian like 
you are.

983
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:11,700
We need them.
You know?

984
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:13,560
I mean,
it's funny.

985
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:16,080
It's fun sometimes because it's 
something to push back against.

986
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:16,914
Yeah.
Because some of them are just so 

987
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:21,300
ridiculous,
so regressive.

988
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,360
Trying to control people you want,
you don't.

989
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:27,780
You're not like open like an open and 
tolerant person.

990
00:45:27,781 --> 00:45:28,614
As someone who wants to communicate the 
difference between their ideas and your 

991
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:33,080
ideas.
That's not what's going on.

992
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:39,210
Like joke about my dad,
he's the most UN-PC person there is.

993
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,250
I mean,
I know there's a lot,

994
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:46,251
but he's at the top.
I think bad guys from that generation.

995
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,620
My nieces and nephews,
the young ones that yell at him pop up.

996
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,010
He can't talk like that,
you know,

997
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:51,863
pop up.
You can't say that pump that hell is 

998
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:55,360
this kid talking,
you know,

999
00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:57,840
my,
my dad has weapons everywhere.

1000
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:01,680
People are like,
oh my God,

1001
00:46:01,681 --> 00:46:04,500
like gun violence.
I literally went home.

1002
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,680
I was working on the east coast,
right,

1003
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:08,280
and I went to a funeral.
My,

1004
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:10,500
my dad's brother,
my uncle Tom,

1005
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:13,860
his girlfriend died 88 years old.
He's still what I'm saying.

1006
00:46:13,861 --> 00:46:17,100
It's taken rhino pills obviously.
So she,

1007
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,030
uh,
whatever.

1008
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:21,480
So there was a funeral and then we went 
to his house and he's this tough,

1009
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,100
tough man.
Like a real,

1010
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,510
like he built bridges.
That's what he did with his life,

1011
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:26,363
you know,
he was a marine for years and he stood 

1012
00:46:28,111 --> 00:46:28,944
up to like look out the window and his 
belt buckle with dangling and it said 

1013
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,633
Nra.
And I forgot where I was from for a 

1014
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:37,090
minute.
Like I,

1015
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:38,910
these are the people that I grew up 
around,

1016
00:46:38,911 --> 00:46:40,860
like I didn't,
it never phased me,

1017
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,170
but we were always taught like,
you know,

1018
00:46:43,171 --> 00:46:44,610
you don't touch that,
you don't do this.

1019
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:47,270
But my dad had grenades in the 
typewriter stores.

1020
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,453
I don't know what we need these for dad,
but somebody are you seeing things that 

1021
00:46:52,681 --> 00:46:56,500
were happening in here?
But he was like that.

1022
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,383
Me and my brothers,
of course we would get into that 

1023
00:47:00,001 --> 00:47:00,834
description is my dad had grenades at 
his typewriter store madness first of 

1024
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:10,860
all.
And they do what a typewriter stores.

1025
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,180
Will you watch any guy,
ladies,

1026
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:16,014
please do me a favor.
If you go over to his house and he says 

1027
00:47:17,821 --> 00:47:20,150
that he's a poet and these kinds of 
typewriter run,

1028
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:22,770
just get out of there.
Run or call me.

1029
00:47:22,771 --> 00:47:23,604
I can fix the typewriter.
Especially if it's one of those old 

1030
00:47:25,381 --> 00:47:26,214
school you typewriters.
If that guy writes all this stuff in an 

1031
00:47:27,961 --> 00:47:32,770
old school that's called manual,
please don't fuck that guy.

1032
00:47:32,771 --> 00:47:33,604
Girls just making change.
I called my dad three days ago and I 

1033
00:47:38,051 --> 00:47:38,710
said,
what are you doing?

1034
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:39,940
He said,
fix it a typewriter.

1035
00:47:39,941 --> 00:47:41,770
I go,
will you please stop this?

1036
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,633
Like I thought he was kidding,
but here are the neighbors still types 

1037
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:46,790
letters out.
And my dad,

1038
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:50,090
if something broke and my dad had a 
clean it up for him and he goes on.

1039
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,400
I had a recent poll,
the ribbon,

1040
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,230
and then I started having flashbacks.
I'm like,

1041
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:58,220
why do I know how to read Spool Ribbon?
Why wasn't I educated properly in line?

1042
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,710
You know what I mean?
Like that's it.

1043
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:02,200
All I know is typewriters.
I could fix your typewriter.

1044
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:05,860
I could do everything is crazy to me.
That laptop,

1045
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:06,753
I don't know what that is.
And when you had to erase something you 

1046
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:08,824
had like the little white thing that we 
used to sell though nine paint over it 

1047
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:17,350
and then you back up.
Yeah,

1048
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,090
go always back.
Mess it up.

1049
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,070
My Dad types with one finger.

1050
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,430
I would have never learned how to type 
if it wasn't for video games.

1051
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:26,343
I learned how I learned how to type 100 
percent so I could talk to people 

1052
00:48:30,131 --> 00:48:31,490
quicker.
That's a good angle.

1053
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,473
Playing quake.
That's how I learned how to type 100 

1054
00:48:35,171 --> 00:48:36,004
percent.

1055
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:39,260
That's a good angle for people like well
you don't need typing now,

1056
00:48:39,261 --> 00:48:41,450
but.
And we had typing in high school because

1057
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,470
especially women,
they're like,

1058
00:48:42,471 --> 00:48:43,221
yeah,
learn to type.

1059
00:48:43,221 --> 00:48:44,060
You're not going to do anything else.

1060
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:48,970
I used to write all my stuff out long 
hand until I started playing video games

1061
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,640
and when I started video games also want
to start writing blogs.

1062
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:52,863
I didn't because I started like working 
on figuring out how to type and I got 

1063
00:48:56,891 --> 00:48:58,840
one of those Mavis Bacon things you ever
do that?

1064
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,570
It's like a game,
it's got into video games.

1065
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:02,350
I don't want them,
but maybe,

1066
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,200
maybe it's Mavis beacon teaches typing.
Oh,

1067
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:06,034
I see.
So it's a typing program but it's a 

1068
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,920
video game.
It and I grew up in a typo.

1069
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,540
It's probably only for videos tutors,
but it's awesome.

1070
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:14,403
It's like really a great way to learn 
because the things show up and you're 

1071
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:20,440
supposed to keep your hands in the 
position.

1072
00:49:20,441 --> 00:49:21,930
The perfect position.
Yeah.

1073
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:24,010
And then when the little things are 
moving across,

1074
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:24,844
it's like you,
you have to try to keep up with what's 

1075
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:27,874
being typed in.
You have to follow it underneath it and 

1076
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:34,060
there's like games you play and I feel 
like I sound like a spokesperson.

1077
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,850
That's how I learned to type.
I learned to type you in that.

1078
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:40,080
Can you do it without looking like are 
you that good?

1079
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:42,000
Oh yeah.
My mom's that person,

1080
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,470
but I don't do it totally correct.

1081
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,310
Um,
you know,

1082
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,390
I've probably had a hurt finger when I 
learned,

1083
00:49:47,391 --> 00:49:52,391
so I lift up one of them or something or
use like four on one side and $3.

1084
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:56,230
Yeah,
there's definitely like an odd duck.

1085
00:49:56,430 --> 00:49:58,920
I remember they used to yell like in 
typing class,

1086
00:49:58,921 --> 00:50:00,260
like,
do you use your pinkies,

1087
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:02,550
these pitches,
pitches and not cooperative.

1088
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:04,960
They don't work the way you think.
No,

1089
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:09,570
don't worry.
It's not going to use the other finger.

1090
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:12,930
My pinkies are so uncooperative,
like little toes.

1091
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,520
But these fingers like I got it.
I got it.

1092
00:50:14,521 --> 00:50:15,420
I got it.
Just give it a base to it,

1093
00:50:15,421 --> 00:50:16,410
but you don't know what the fuck are you
doing?

1094
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:16,710
Come on,
come on,

1095
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:17,121
come on,
come on.

1096
00:50:17,121 --> 00:50:19,820
Come on to my pinkies liquor beach.
Where been such news.

1097
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:22,380
We'll look at the difference.
I did.

1098
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,750
Fuck du Du,
Du,

1099
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,830
Du,
Du,

1100
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:25,750
Du,
Du,

1101
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:26,583
Du,
Du.

1102
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,283
You

1103
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:32,220
fuck you get to shit.
Come on for everybody.

1104
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:38,240
That's one of the strong man.
It's all about your mind,

1105
00:50:40,401 --> 00:50:43,430
Bro.
Mentality.

1106
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:49,620
It's all about your mentality.
The mentality is no good.

1107
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,000
I saw this dude once he was on um,
wasn't though.

1108
00:50:53,001 --> 00:50:55,670
Was it not sally Jessy Raphael,
one of those fucking shows.

1109
00:50:55,671 --> 00:50:57,910
It might've been Jenny Jones.
I don't remember what show it was.

1110
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:59,223
Old School.
Right.

1111
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,630
But I'll never forget this dude because 
there's this girl and she was like,

1112
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,493
dressing really trashy and she's like 
disrespect and her mom has all this 

1113
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,830
crazy shit going on and this dude gets 
up in the audience,

1114
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,170
gets up in the audience and you know,
do you have any,

1115
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,640
anything you want to say to her?
You know,

1116
00:51:13,641 --> 00:51:15,970
they'd go to the audience people's 
responses.

1117
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,970
He goes,
if you had a good personality,

1118
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,680
you could pull that off if you had some 
jazz.

1119
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,620
He goes,
but you'll,

1120
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,050
you'll personality sucks and that make 
you look nasty.

1121
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:39,260
I never forget that dude.
Your personality sucks and that make you

1122
00:51:39,261 --> 00:51:41,440
look nasty and everybody.
And everybody was like,

1123
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,540
Oh shit.
It was me and candy Alexander will.

1124
00:51:48,241 --> 00:51:49,074
We're on newsradio together in between 
takes and we're hanging out one of the 

1125
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:53,084
break rooms or whatever it was.
We were watching one of those daytime 

1126
00:51:56,421 --> 00:51:57,830
shows.
This pre-internet man,

1127
00:51:57,831 --> 00:52:01,370
I'm just no Internet back then.
And that was like the perfect.

1128
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,690
They look for now on the Internet as 
well.

1129
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:04,524
We use the internet existed,
but you go to like aol.com or something 

1130
00:52:08,121 --> 00:52:09,560
like that.
You never saw anything like that?

1131
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:10,423
No.
Yeah.

1132
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,940
How long do you think it's been since 
that all that's been coming up?

1133
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:14,774
Like what's.
I feel like I have no idea of the 

1134
00:52:16,521 --> 00:52:20,390
timeframe of when this became the thing.
It's kind of snuck up on us,

1135
00:52:20,391 --> 00:52:21,224
right?
It keeps getting more and more embedded 

1136
00:52:22,191 --> 00:52:23,150
in everybody's alive.

1137
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:24,413
Ari Shaffir and big Jay Oakerson did a 
fucking hilarious podcast where Ari and 

1138
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:30,014
big J or on a roof in New York City and 
their timing on this girl and this guy 

1139
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,950
and this girl are.
Yeah,

1140
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,823
and this girl and this guy,
they keep about to get it on and they 

1141
00:52:42,051 --> 00:52:45,290
check their phones.
They're on top of each other,

1142
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,153
checking their phones on each other like
she's riding him and she's checking her 

1143
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:54,170
phone and he pauses in like grabbing her
ass.

1144
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,340
He pauses and grabs his fault.
That doesn't make.

1145
00:52:57,350 --> 00:53:01,670
Might be pokemon go.
Doesn't mean I want to talk to you about

1146
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:04,190
Pokemon Pokemon,
but I put it does.

1147
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,610
It does make sense?
Do that.

1148
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:10,130
People are crazy.
They're sucked into phones.

1149
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,053
Phones draw you in.
Where are they looking for sexual 

1150
00:53:13,371 --> 00:53:14,450
positions?
Oh No,

1151
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:14,900
no,
no,

1152
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,321
no,
no,

1153
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:17,240
no.
They're checking their text messages.

1154
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:18,074
Bullshit ass guaranteed.
Some people just can't help it or get 

1155
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:21,230
into the message.

1156
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,063
What's my message?
We'll look.

1157
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,710
Got another message over.
Yes.

1158
00:53:24,711 --> 00:53:26,870
They were about to have trump other 
things.

1159
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:27,704
Some people are crazy.
There are people that are flat out 100 

1160
00:53:32,191 --> 00:53:34,830
percent attached to that phone.
This is step one.

1161
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,420
Eleanor.
This is step one.

1162
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:39,720
APP addicts.
They didn't stop.

1163
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,613
This is different.
This is different than the phone thing 

1164
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:44,363
is different because if you wanted to 
say that you wanted to say that phones 

1165
00:53:47,221 --> 00:53:50,650
are a drug and addiction,
right?

1166
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,350
If you wanted to,
you'd have to sort out the consequences.

1167
00:53:53,351 --> 00:53:54,840
Like what are the consequences of this 
drug?

1168
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,213
We don't know about that.
I mean the consequences of coffee are 

1169
00:53:57,931 --> 00:53:59,490
pretty mundane.
It's no big deal.

1170
00:53:59,491 --> 00:54:00,120
You know,
you get,

1171
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:00,953
you get fired up.
This might be the most addictive drug 

1172
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,370
ever.
Like if it was a drug,

1173
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:07,700
if it wasn't an object,
like what?

1174
00:54:07,701 --> 00:54:08,534
What is,
what drug do you walk down the street 

1175
00:54:10,411 --> 00:54:14,130
and you see everyone on every one 
holding their phone,

1176
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:14,990
looking at their phone.

1177
00:54:15,310 --> 00:54:18,780
When you're looking down street,
you might see 40,

1178
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:21,510
50 percent of the people holding a 
phone.

1179
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:26,130
Yeah,
I mean that is obviously it's a device,

1180
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:27,143
but let's just classify it as an 
obsession or as something that you're a 

1181
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:32,963
fixation.
Perhaps something that is just 

1182
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:36,023
overwhelmingly influential in the fact 
that you pay so much attention to it in 

1183
00:54:39,661 --> 00:54:40,494
your life.
This is more of a lover than anyone 

1184
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:44,094
you've ever known,
but if this fucking thing is with you 

1185
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,500
while you shit with you all the 
companions,

1186
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,353
but it doesn't trump sex like I'm sorry.
After you can't try this girl trying to 

1187
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:55,794
get some good.
Maybe I don't know what's going to 

1188
00:54:57,051 --> 00:54:57,680
happen.

1189
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:02,680
Were you already feeling towards me 
looking at her for so long that you have

1190
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:12,750
pathways carved in your anatomy?
Know Him with the ceiling Pokemon,

1191
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,920
the pokemon games.
Taking it to the next level because when

1192
00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:17,860
I explain it,
explain what's going on.

1193
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:20,980
The easiest way to say web pokemon is it
takes Google maps.

1194
00:55:20,981 --> 00:55:21,814
You have to sign into Google.
It takes Google maps and all the 

1195
00:55:23,891 --> 00:55:27,790
information that's in Google maps and it
makes it the level of video game.

1196
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:31,180
So instead of playing a level,
you're playing your own street,

1197
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:33,820
you're finding you're finding creatures 
in your house.

1198
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,550
And uh,
so yeah.

1199
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:39,460
So then there's places like churches are
called Jim's.

1200
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,294
That's where you go and if you go to a 
church you can train your fighter to be 

1201
00:55:44,321 --> 00:55:45,154
stronger and stuff like that.
So you're using real world places and 

1202
00:55:49,841 --> 00:55:52,840
like,
like landmarks and you're finding things

1203
00:55:52,841 --> 00:55:54,310
that like water fountains.

1204
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:57,070
Like if you go to the water fountain,
there's a bunch of coins there.

1205
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,053
So it's using the.
And what's crazy is like if you're at 

1206
00:56:00,101 --> 00:56:04,120
the comedy store it on Google maps,
you can upload your own photos,

1207
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:04,930
you know,
like,

1208
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,360
like I was at the comedy store on Google
maps,

1209
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:08,493
so it pulls that information also.
So if you're playing the game you'll be 

1210
00:56:11,921 --> 00:56:12,311
like,
oh,

1211
00:56:12,311 --> 00:56:16,330
there's Andy Kaufman sign.
If we go to the Andy Kaufman sign,

1212
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:20,320
we can get some treasures and it shows 
you the Andy Kaufman signed in the video

1213
00:56:20,321 --> 00:56:22,420
game.
But here's the crazy thing,

1214
00:56:22,690 --> 00:56:23,523
in one,
like two days it's almost every single 

1215
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:30,721
person has downloaded and played it and 
the crazy thing I was thinking of is how

1216
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:34,300
awesome is it that it's connected to 
Google and we're sending,

1217
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:35,203
because it opens your camera at parts of
the game when you're battling and it's 

1218
00:56:39,251 --> 00:56:41,230
scanning your room,
your houses,

1219
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:43,150
and it's sending it to google.

1220
00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:44,183
So this is like the best way that Google
is now getting a complete map of our 

1221
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:48,514
house inside.
It's like it's scanning every street in 

1222
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:53,704
like one year.
Your Google is going to be able to see 

1223
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:01,050
every single inch of it every single 
place inside and outside because of this

1224
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:02,140
game.
How long has it been out?

1225
00:57:02,141 --> 00:57:03,760
Like three days.
Three days already.

1226
00:57:03,761 --> 00:57:07,210
I'm more phones on android than tinder.
And it's about to pass up twitter.

1227
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,103
Yeah.
I really think we should bring 

1228
00:57:08,951 --> 00:57:10,510
typewriters back.
I'm sorry.

1229
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:11,403
And no one's thinking about this though.
We're just opening our camera and 

1230
00:57:14,501 --> 00:57:17,020
recording our rooms and sending it to 
google.

1231
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,233
Wait a minute.
This real gentle yoga poses looking up 

1232
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:23,290
us.
I knew we were going to talk about us.

1233
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:25,180
I pulled up some stuff already,
there's like a,

1234
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,373
the interesting thing that's happening 
with it being on open gps maps as those 

1235
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:30,760
places,
those locations,

1236
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:31,953
like there's a guy's home that's been 
turned into one of these gyms and he's 

1237
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,103
like mad that people are showing up 
outside of his place because he bought 

1238
00:57:37,931 --> 00:57:41,440
an old church and so churches in the 
game automatically become Jim.

1239
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,540
So people are hanging outside of this 
house now.

1240
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,200
But also interesting things like this 
has happened where the West Westboro,

1241
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,710
Westboro Baptist Church has been 
overtaken by a gay friendly pokemon.

1242
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,073
So people were like kind of,
I don't know necessarily trolling them 

1243
00:57:54,101 --> 00:57:57,040
and whatnot,
but then,

1244
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:57,963
uh,
so by walking around and looking for 

1245
00:57:59,321 --> 00:58:01,980
things,
a teenager found dead body somewhere and

1246
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:02,814
just three days they've already been 
dead body found by teenager hunting 

1247
00:58:06,911 --> 00:58:08,020
water.
Pokemon.

1248
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:09,700
Yeah.
She found it underneath the bridge.

1249
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:10,713
Oh my God.
This last part I was trying to get a 

1250
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:18,040
water.
Pokemon wiggins told CNN instead,

1251
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:20,230
she made the alarming and alarming 
discovery,

1252
00:58:20,231 --> 00:58:22,690
a dead body close to the Wyoming 
highway.

1253
00:58:22,691 --> 00:58:23,524
Seven 89 bridge,
I'd probably would have never went down 

1254
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:28,060
there if it weren't for this game.
She admitted,

1255
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:29,183
but the scary incident isn't deterring.
Her wigans says she will continue to 

1256
00:58:32,891 --> 00:58:36,340
play the game.
I saw somebody playing on the highway on

1257
00:58:36,341 --> 00:58:37,000
the way here.

1258
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:37,833
I saw somebody playing on the highway 
last plastics bad enough we don't need 

1259
00:58:40,661 --> 00:58:43,120
the last night when I was waiting for my
uber at my house,

1260
00:58:43,121 --> 00:58:46,240
I just three minutes I saw two different
groups of kids,

1261
00:58:46,241 --> 00:58:48,340
like one on skateboards and one on 
bikes.

1262
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:51,610
Just playing the game.
And what's scary is like on that article

1263
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:52,843
now armed robbers are robbing people at 
certain places in the game because they 

1264
00:58:56,621 --> 00:58:59,710
know the kids are going to be there with
like new phones like I phones and stuff.

1265
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:02,140
So they're waiting at certain places 
coming out,

1266
00:59:02,141 --> 00:59:02,974
stealing our phones and because it 
allows players to drop a lower module 

1267
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:13,081
and a real world location to attract 
high numbers of Pokemon for 30 minutes.

1268
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:14,464
The lure modules have reportedly also 
been used by business owners to bring 

1269
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:20,260
people to their stores.
What?

1270
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,333
Yeah.
So,

1271
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,160
so this is the next level?
Yes.

1272
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,480
This is,
this is what starts the next level,

1273
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:30,140
this kind of thing though.
The next level of what's that Internet,

1274
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,490
augmented reality that it's going to 
take over and it's also scanning.

1275
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:35,324
Just like snapchat scanned all our faces
using all these filters now and they 

1276
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:39,680
have perfect.
They could three d model.

1277
00:59:39,681 --> 00:59:42,970
All our faces now,
because we we've been scanning are faced

1278
00:59:42,971 --> 00:59:46,070
with now they.
They're scanning the whole entire United

1279
00:59:46,070 --> 00:59:47,600
States.
They're going to have maps of everything

1280
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:49,910
inside and outside in like less than a 
year.

1281
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:52,213
Didn't.
We think though that eventually that 

1282
00:59:52,991 --> 00:59:55,470
that was going to be inevitable and that
was going to be unavoidable.

1283
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:59,130
There's the technology's gonna dissolve 
all the windows.

1284
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,740
Well this is the next is dissolving in 
the windows.

1285
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,633
That's also fascinating that it's an 
augmented reality like that's what got 

1286
01:00:07,591 --> 01:00:10,890
everybody in life,
that the augmented reality is what snuck

1287
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:13,320
everybody in and then everybody's like,
Oh man,

1288
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:15,430
let's play a game.
I'm part of the game.

1289
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,323
Then you're completely sucked into this 
very bizarre new world where you're 

1290
01:00:21,901 --> 01:00:25,740
playing a game but wrapped around your 
own actual environment.

1291
01:00:25,741 --> 01:00:26,160
What do you.

1292
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:29,730
This guy owns the gym of that guy's 
house,

1293
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:34,850
so virtual owner of properly 
technically,

1294
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:37,290
and it can be stolen or taken there.

1295
01:00:38,490 --> 01:00:41,400
Woohoo.
I met the owner of my gym.

1296
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,590
Nice guy.
Oh my God.

1297
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:45,150
Was like,
uh,

1298
01:00:45,150 --> 01:00:47,170
yeah,
please don't tell anybody where I live,

1299
01:00:47,171 --> 01:00:48,640
dude.
Get away from my apartment.

1300
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,673
They're going to get sued.
Those pokemon people are going to get 

1301
01:00:52,021 --> 01:00:52,740
sued.

1302
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,573
Sure.
There's going to be a lot of lawsuits 

1303
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,330
about this game.
There's gonna be a lot of people dying.

1304
01:00:58,080 --> 01:00:59,400
Like I said,
on the way here,

1305
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:00,234
I saw somebody using it while driving 
because that dead body with somebody 

1306
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:05,394
trying to get a water pokemon.
It was probably somebody murdered or a 

1307
01:01:10,231 --> 01:01:11,310
homeless person?
Yeah,

1308
01:01:12,140 --> 01:01:14,590
didn't.
He could have been under that.

1309
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,250
Where's the water?
Up with somebody.

1310
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,650
Okay.
When you find something,

1311
01:01:19,651 --> 01:01:21,720
find like a water law.
Is that what it was?

1312
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:23,390
No,
no.

1313
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:26,120
It's an alert.
It's this thing that you can drop on the

1314
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:28,670
ground and so did someone drop it where 
the home was,

1315
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:30,110
where the dead person was?
No,

1316
01:01:30,111 --> 01:01:33,140
she was just searching for pokemon go.
It's kind of.

1317
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,920
It reminds me of like when you're a kid,
you know,

1318
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:36,620
bicycle,
bicycle,

1319
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:38,720
inner going around your neighborhood,
like playing adventure,

1320
01:01:38,721 --> 01:01:40,490
like looking at things and finding 
things.

1321
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:41,443
It's Kinda like that,
that makes you kind of go out in your 

1322
01:01:42,591 --> 01:01:45,860
neighborhood and look at stuff like I 
didn't know that there was like a buddha

1323
01:01:45,861 --> 01:01:49,790
across the street and like this forest 
by my house and I found out by this game

1324
01:01:49,791 --> 01:01:51,020
because it was like go here,
you know,

1325
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:55,280
there's some stuff here and so it's kind
of cool because it shows you around your

1326
01:01:55,281 --> 01:01:57,860
neighborhood and stuff like that that 
you might've not known.

1327
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:58,873
It's kind of like that old game,
a geo tagging game that people used to 

1328
01:02:01,461 --> 01:02:02,294
play where it's like go to these 
coordinates and you'll find like a 

1329
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:07,710
president and you know,
to got really cynical go.

1330
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:08,873
You'd be like some sort of an alien 
talking to you going move around your 

1331
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:15,810
coordinates and take photographs of 
everything so perfectly.

1332
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:16,883
Yeah.
It's really interesting to see what 

1333
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:20,550
businesses or businesses are doing.
Like dairy queen,

1334
01:02:20,551 --> 01:02:21,384
like I said,
dropped something on the ground is like 

1335
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:26,200
paying customers only can come here and 
get pokemon.

1336
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:29,640
So that's probably smart.
Yeah,

1337
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,010
that's smart for them.
Can you imagine?

1338
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:33,780
Like I,
I grew up in south philly.

1339
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,643
We didn't look at anything and if we saw
something we just kept walking to do 

1340
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:39,384
that anymore.
Eleanor is no more slaves and you don't 

1341
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:45,300
have to ride a horse around taking 
pictures around my mom's neighborhood.

1342
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:45,840
Yeah.
All right.

1343
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:46,673
So let me explain to me,
because let me understand how this 

1344
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:49,240
works.
You're,

1345
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,390
you're playing it,
so if you're playing it,

1346
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:53,790
like what are you seeing?
Are you seeing on the ground right now?

1347
01:02:53,790 --> 01:02:54,623
I see nothing I'm looking around.
I could see down the street there's 

1348
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:58,763
some,
some cool places to get more coin or 

1349
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:02,820
it's called pokey balls,
which you used to capture.

1350
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:06,290
So these places exist.
How they just like,

1351
01:03:06,300 --> 01:03:08,250
they just decided that the things are 
there.

1352
01:03:08,251 --> 01:03:09,084
It's random,
but what they usually do is they take 

1353
01:03:10,951 --> 01:03:11,784
certain things in Google maps,
like all their churches are gyms where 

1354
01:03:14,281 --> 01:03:17,000
you go to workout and stuff like that.
Your pokemons.

1355
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:18,143
Then they take like,
like things like the comedy store and 

1356
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:23,070
they put certain like they know it's a 
landmark,

1357
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:23,940
so they,
they.

1358
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:26,190
There's a lot going on there.
Like last night,

1359
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,203
if you go to the comedy store now,
you haven't been there in a couple of 

1360
01:03:28,531 --> 01:03:30,180
days.
Every single person's playing,

1361
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,680
every single person working there is 
playing.

1362
01:03:31,681 --> 01:03:32,514
Every comic is.
Everyone's just out there on their 

1363
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:36,330
phones.
That's happened so quick.

1364
01:03:36,331 --> 01:03:36,930
It's,
it's,

1365
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:38,430
it's,
it's huge man.

1366
01:03:38,431 --> 01:03:39,264
It's.
I just heard about this like maybe two 

1367
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,210
days ago,
two days ago,

1368
01:03:42,211 --> 01:03:43,390
I saw a couple of pictures

1369
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:45,303
on youtube.
This video of what someone made a fake 

1370
01:03:48,401 --> 01:03:49,234
application.
I looked like this and it turned out to 

1371
01:03:50,621 --> 01:03:53,950
be a really good idea that someone to 
develop,

1372
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,270
develop now,
but

1373
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,003
overnight it's doing because it really 
hits this nerve in your head of 

1374
01:03:58,961 --> 01:04:01,750
collecting things and when you're going 
like,

1375
01:04:01,751 --> 01:04:02,970
look what I have collected and what 
will,

1376
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:03,843
where have collectively,
and it's the perfect thing to do when 

1377
01:04:05,381 --> 01:04:07,120
you're bored.
Like I was in an uber.

1378
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:09,550
I'm just sitting there while we're 
driving by the Hollywood bowl and like,

1379
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:10,860
oh,
there's some cool stuff here.

1380
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:12,850
I'm going to get here,
so it's a good thing to do when you're.

1381
01:04:12,851 --> 01:04:14,830
You have nothing else to do.
What do you mean?

1382
01:04:14,831 --> 01:04:15,664
Get like you just as long as your phone.
It's like you're collecting virtual 

1383
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,054
items.
It's like you're collecting virtual 

1384
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:25,321
items like whoa.
Pokemon chasing investors led Nintendo's

1385
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:28,840
go,
go out there,

1386
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:30,950
make just make it smaller.
Send in $10.

1387
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,390
Shares soaring craze added 9 billion in 
market value.

1388
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:37,690
Gave me company while Nintendo was 
hurting.

1389
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:39,760
It was hurting before this.

1390
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:41,640
Come on.
This is no.

1391
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:42,490
Yeah,
that's the.

1392
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:44,740
Okay,
so you're walking around explaining this

1393
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:46,390
to me.
I'm looking at this person holding their

1394
01:04:46,391 --> 01:04:51,391
hand up so they're walking around and 
they have like a phone open where the.

1395
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:53,440
They see the image of what's in front of
them.

1396
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:56,080
The pokemon stuff is just sort of 
floating around.

1397
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:57,430
Yeah.
Oh my God,

1398
01:04:57,431 --> 01:04:59,290
this is crazy.
And then you could grow eggs,

1399
01:04:59,291 --> 01:05:00,124
you can share or you can train your 
characters to be stronger and then you 

1400
01:05:03,851 --> 01:05:06,320
can battle other characters at gyms and.
And,

1401
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,820
and this is by the way,
is just the first version.

1402
01:05:09,850 --> 01:05:10,683
They just,
you know,

1403
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:14,590
they're going to be adding so much to 
this and what's interesting to note,

1404
01:05:14,591 --> 01:05:19,240
I heard a rumor maybe that the new grand
theft auto is going to be doing the same

1405
01:05:19,241 --> 01:05:20,074
thing,
so you're going to be playing grand 

1406
01:05:20,801 --> 01:05:21,634
theft auto using google maps,
so you're going to be at your house and 

1407
01:05:23,531 --> 01:05:27,250
your house is going to your house and so
this is just the beginning of this whole

1408
01:05:27,251 --> 01:05:31,320
idea of taking Google's information and 
giving the people outside.

1409
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:32,823
Good one.
One of the things is that they're 

1410
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:38,560
already saying that people are,
are like kids are complaining about sore

1411
01:05:38,561 --> 01:05:43,561
legs and like maybe this will be the 
video game that people,

1412
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,100
people who are addicted to video games.
Yeah.

1413
01:05:48,670 --> 01:05:49,503
I mean that's,
that's the only positive thing I see my 

1414
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,100
neurologist hanging around playing with 
each other.

1415
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:56,230
Oh my God,
this is insane.

1416
01:05:56,260 --> 01:05:57,093
This is like the comedy store than 
comicon in San Diego is going to be a 

1417
01:05:59,141 --> 01:05:59,974
zoo with this.
I forgot about stuff like that is 

1418
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,083
fucking insane.
I can't believe I'll just look at her 

1419
01:06:06,140 --> 01:06:08,380
story.
Is that from being sore?

1420
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:14,470
I also heard that they banned it in San 
Francisco,

1421
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,110
but I haven't looked to see if that's 
true or not.

1422
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:19,720
Like some cities are actually banning it
because people are not paying attention.

1423
01:06:19,721 --> 01:06:24,170
Just going into traffic and there was 
probably a lot of them on the four.

1424
01:06:24,171 --> 01:06:25,004
Oh,
five today.

1425
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:26,983
Oh,
I saw somebody.

1426
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:28,210
If you think about it,

1427
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:32,740
probably just the next step in what 
we're eventually going to get,

1428
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:36,460
which is some sort of a reality that we 
can manipulate all the time.

1429
01:06:36,740 --> 01:06:37,573
Like this is one part of it.
We're gonna have little games in the 

1430
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:41,920
regular reality but you have to look 
through your phone to see it,

1431
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:45,670
but how long before that's glasses that 
you're wearing like that Microsoft shit.

1432
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:48,580
What was already coming up with that?
What is it called again?

1433
01:06:48,581 --> 01:06:50,680
Magic leap.
That's one.

1434
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:51,523
I think that's the Google one.
Microsoft Hollow Lens is are they both 

1435
01:06:56,230 --> 01:06:58,990
with goggles?
Both augmented reality bit there.

1436
01:06:58,991 --> 01:06:59,824
Both developed around augmented reality 
and supposedly magically is supposed to 

1437
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:03,730
be awesome.
I don't want to say better,

1438
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:07,660
but so no one likes regular reality and 
come on if you have a pair of glasses.

1439
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:10,480
If you just put on a pair of glasses 
that you put on a pair,

1440
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:11,373
like they live style,
I mean Jesus Christ they live is going 

1441
01:07:13,301 --> 01:07:14,134
to be real.
You put on a pair of glasses and then 

1442
01:07:17,021 --> 01:07:21,590
you see and you see all kinds of crazy 
shit what you could use but,

1443
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:25,560
but imagine but you can see real part.
That's this morning

1444
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:28,660
dragons if you want to like constantly.

1445
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:29,913
Yeah.
That was google glass or you have a 

1446
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:33,051
pair?
No,

1447
01:07:33,051 --> 01:07:33,740
no,
no,

1448
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:36,140
no.
That was the one I saw.

1449
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:36,974
That's what I was thinking.
We're doing something with the UFC back 

1450
01:07:39,141 --> 01:07:40,520
then.
Shogun and Chael Sonnen.

1451
01:07:41,030 --> 01:07:41,863
Um,
they were doing something with the USC 

1452
01:07:42,591 --> 01:07:43,424
and they wanted to get footage.
I noticed some three 60 rigs going 

1453
01:07:46,491 --> 01:07:47,870
around this weekend.
I wonder what,

1454
01:07:47,871 --> 01:07:49,610
what they're gonna do with that.
I just noticed that they were,

1455
01:07:49,670 --> 01:07:50,503
there are people walking out with the 
fighters and then I noticed during the 

1456
01:07:52,671 --> 01:07:55,550
fights it was kind of like planted 
somewhere near the ring.

1457
01:07:55,970 --> 01:07:56,803
If you ever want to talk to the guys 
about it and be happy to introduce you 

1458
01:07:59,151 --> 01:08:02,090
to them.
They're the best.

1459
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,880
They know what the fuck to do.
There's all sorts of crazy stuff they've

1460
01:08:04,881 --> 01:08:06,840
tried before that they don't do anymore.
Um,

1461
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,260
but uh,
I think they're doing four k now too.

1462
01:08:09,261 --> 01:08:10,280
That's another new thing

1463
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,930
now.
It is pretty.

1464
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,920
It's really cool.
Weighted starting have done the porn yet

1465
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:20,950
on the,
on the vr from pokemon to porn.

1466
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,840
Same thing.
You could do virtual reality porn.

1467
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:24,601
Yeah.
Apparently.

1468
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:26,180
Yeah.
So there's a,

1469
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:27,213
I forget which website.
One of the main white websites has 

1470
01:08:28,990 --> 01:08:30,520
somebody like that.
It has free.

1471
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:33,900
That's what those people were doing with
their phones duringj and res thing.

1472
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:36,200
One of the main websites that porn 
websites,

1473
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:38,210
pornhub I think has virtual porn,
uh,

1474
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:40,850
now for free.
So you could buy this thing on Amazon,

1475
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:45,851
puts your Samsung note five in there and
it's like a really cheap version of,

1476
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:48,280
you know,
you could do a,

1477
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,820
like kind of like Google cardboard.
But uh,

1478
01:08:50,860 --> 01:08:52,790
I tried it out the other day 
immediately.

1479
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:53,601
I was like,
oh no,

1480
01:08:53,601 --> 01:08:54,434
this is the,
this is the one thing that's gonna save 

1481
01:08:55,581 --> 01:08:56,414
corn.
Because after watching it I felt way 

1482
01:08:58,431 --> 01:09:00,410
more connected to the girl in the sex.

1483
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:05,390
It was way better,
like a masturbation environment and that

1484
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:06,224
in music videos like his,
I don't know if you've seen Jamie's 

1485
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:11,180
friend Cameron Gray,
so when you saying way more connected,

1486
01:09:11,181 --> 01:09:14,330
so you felt it wasn't like you were just
watching porn.

1487
01:09:14,630 --> 01:09:15,830
It was like,
oh my gosh,

1488
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:20,210
I'm more closer to this girl now because
now I could look at the girl's feet if I

1489
01:09:20,211 --> 01:09:22,100
wanted it to or I could look at,
look at the,

1490
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:25,430
you know,
but,

1491
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,373
but it,
it was like I was more like after I was 

1492
01:09:28,521 --> 01:09:29,690
done I was like,
holy cow.

1493
01:09:29,691 --> 01:09:33,050
I felt way closer to it.
It was just a way,

1494
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:34,003
a better step up in porn music,
music videos to like his buddy Kevin 

1495
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,410
Gray has a free app that you can 
download a and it's like you're watching

1496
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:44,750
this music video,
but then you could look in the back seat

1497
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:46,140
and see what's going on in the back 
seat.

1498
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,053
There's like all these different 
storylines going on all around and it's 

1499
01:09:50,571 --> 01:09:52,970
so cool if you haven't seen this shit,
his friend is,

1500
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,610
has an amazing music video on the APP 
store.

1501
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:57,110
Cameron Gray.
Whoa,

1502
01:09:57,170 --> 01:09:58,170
that makes sense.
Man.

1503
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:00,320
I think they're probably gonna do that 
with comedy shows too,

1504
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:01,154
right?
Yeah,

1505
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:02,323
absolutely.
And that's what when you seeing that 

1506
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:06,980
stuff that the UFC there,
they probably will have it where you can

1507
01:10:06,981 --> 01:10:10,580
just sit there and watch a certain 
fights and you can look around.

1508
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:13,010
You could see like dns sitting there.
You could see you yelling.

1509
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:15,950
You know what it might be to me.
I don't know.

1510
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,500
I'm just just total speculation,
but it might be the.

1511
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:19,363
Is this the switch to the halfway?
Can you move it to the halfway point 

1512
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:23,323
that this part right here,
he's in the backseat of a car or you're 

1513
01:10:26,251 --> 01:10:27,084
in front seat of a car and there's 
somebody like catching this right here 

1514
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:34,280
so you can look around and you could see
him get out of the car and you're like,

1515
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:35,240
wait,
where did he go to?

1516
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,840
Broken glass?
Yeah,

1517
01:10:37,190 --> 01:10:40,010
he's getting something out of the trunk.
Like what's he getting out in the trunk?

1518
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:44,070
You could just look around and then it's
so cool.

1519
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:47,330
You could look forward to seeing that 
weird.

1520
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:52,610
There's weird and there's camera and 
he's like a lighting something on fire,

1521
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:56,420
but it's neat to this as an a good 
example.

1522
01:10:56,421 --> 01:10:57,254
This is the first step.
Seeing somebody like a music video do 

1523
01:10:59,211 --> 01:11:00,044
it.
This is a good example of like it takes 

1524
01:11:01,431 --> 01:11:04,070
you to a different level of a music 
video.

1525
01:11:04,071 --> 01:11:04,904
You're not watching a music video.
You get to look at whatever you want in 

1526
01:11:07,521 --> 01:11:11,120
this music video.
It's the next level of immersion.

1527
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,043
Yeah,
but I don't believe that it's going to 

1528
01:11:13,621 --> 01:11:14,070
take off

1529
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:18,960
till they figure out how to make the 
goggles smaller more easier.

1530
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:19,800
Well,
do you think.

1531
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,450
Here's the question,
what does it.

1532
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,570
What does a movie going to be like?
If this becomes the new thing?

1533
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:27,450
Because like we're used to seeing like 
if you want to see a great movie,

1534
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:30,000
right?
You want to see a raging bull,

1535
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:30,811
right?
Great.

1536
01:11:30,811 --> 01:11:32,880
Will you sit down and you're watching 
this great movie.

1537
01:11:32,881 --> 01:11:35,080
It all plays out right in front of you.
When,

1538
01:11:35,081 --> 01:11:37,320
when it doesn't,
when it's all in your head,

1539
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:38,223
do you?
Do you still want to be around other 

1540
01:11:38,851 --> 01:11:43,260
people that are experiencing it?
Like then is everybody walking around?

1541
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,850
I think everybody sees something 
different.

1542
01:11:44,851 --> 01:11:45,684
Yeah,
I think it's gonna be awhile to ever 

1543
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:48,594
gets to movies if ever.
Just because if you have the goggles on 

1544
01:11:51,271 --> 01:11:53,760
after a certain amount of time you have 
to take them off.

1545
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,230
You're just done.
You know your eyes.

1546
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:56,970
It's too much for your.
Your eyes.

1547
01:11:56,971 --> 01:11:59,640
Do you think that it's too much because 
it's just not good yet?

1548
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:00,533
Do you think that something they could 
work around a little bit of that and a 

1549
01:12:02,821 --> 01:12:03,654
little bit of.
I think it really fucks with your 

1550
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:07,733
everything.
Well they say if you look with a shitty 

1551
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:10,794
binoculars,
it's like bad for your eyes look shitty 

1552
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:16,020
glass.
That kind of makes sense.

1553
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:18,240
If you're looking through this lens at 
this image,

1554
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:22,770
it would have to be like Swarovski 
crystal or some crazy shit.

1555
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:25,020
You know what I mean?
Like to like free to be really clear for

1556
01:12:25,021 --> 01:12:26,160
your eyes.
Does that make sense?

1557
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:32,370
Because it's straining like,
like I also has to be like 90 frames per

1558
01:12:32,371 --> 01:12:35,520
second or it has to be some kind of 
frames per second or it makes you sick.

1559
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:39,000
So like there's a video game that's 
coming out soon for,

1560
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:39,834
I think x-box replace,
I forget that is a virtual reality game 

1561
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:43,374
or when you wear goggles,
but they don't have the frame speed up 

1562
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,820
fast enough so people are just getting 
sick immediately.

1563
01:12:48,850 --> 01:12:52,980
What I'm just thinking is like really 
good goggles are really good binoculars.

1564
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,130
They're real expensive,
you know?

1565
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,153
Oh yeah.
And I think if you think about how much 

1566
01:13:01,411 --> 01:13:04,230
it costs just to buy a pair of 
binoculars,

1567
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:06,150
like a really high end pair of 
binoculars,

1568
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:07,343
I think about like how much more it 
would be for computer attached to that 

1569
01:13:09,511 --> 01:13:13,020
thing and lucky to have it look really 
clear.

1570
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,900
Like what is the difference between like
a four k?

1571
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:16,734
What does the,
it's just the resolution difference in 

1572
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:22,530
four K it's pretty much like for Hdtvs 
make one,

1573
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,930
four k screen.
But I've heard that the um,

1574
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:25,943
is it o l e d that that's the best,
like visual that's like saying nowadays 

1575
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:32,730
like plasma,
Lcd,

1576
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:33,564
you know,
like that's a kind of TV or kind of a 

1577
01:13:35,631 --> 01:13:36,420
display.

1578
01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:37,350
So yeah.
So.

1579
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:39,750
Oh,
led is not anything special.

1580
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,613
No,
that's just like one of the better 

1581
01:13:42,810 --> 01:13:46,920
organic led organically.
That's what I've been told.

1582
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:48,810
Looks the best.
I think so.

1583
01:13:48,811 --> 01:13:50,940
From what I've seen.
And do they make that in four k,

1584
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:53,190
200 percent.
We're in a weird world,

1585
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:57,030
aren't we folks I'm waiting for.
My TV dies.

1586
01:13:57,140 --> 01:13:57,973
So strange.
Why don't you give you a TV to like 

1587
01:14:00,421 --> 01:14:01,700
Josh?
No,

1588
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,630
no,
it's a nice TV.

1589
01:14:03,631 --> 01:14:04,590
I just,
you know,

1590
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:07,070
I wanted to die so I have a reason to 
get a new TV.

1591
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,350
I know,
but it's still a top of the line.

1592
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:11,980
Doesn't have

1593
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,530
a back when they were awesome.
They were awesome.

1594
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:15,840
Ten years ago.
Yeah.

1595
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:18,360
I have an old ass TV in my gym.
My,

1596
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:19,960
my,
my TV and my gym.

1597
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:23,470
I got in 2003.
This is the same TV.

1598
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:25,510
It's interesting.
It's still there.

1599
01:14:25,511 --> 01:14:26,830
Good.
And it's pretty good.

1600
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,730
But cheapest.
Fuck today.

1601
01:14:30,870 --> 01:14:32,410
Like if I bought it today,
it would be like,

1602
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:33,910
no,
that's garbage.

1603
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:35,180
I was like,
look,

1604
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:41,230
I've got something beautiful lake death.
It goes on the wall.

1605
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:43,330
You were fine.
An old laptop you got laying around.

1606
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:44,770
You're like,
oh my God,

1607
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:45,604
look at this piece of shit.
Just two years ago I got rid of the top 

1608
01:14:49,601 --> 01:14:52,130
computer with the big.
What's that called?

1609
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:53,833
Yeah,
the tower.

1610
01:14:54,180 --> 01:14:55,013
Oh my God.
Even my boyfriend who doesn't get into 

1611
01:14:57,491 --> 01:14:58,324
this at all,
he was like,

1612
01:14:58,330 --> 01:14:59,800
what?
Your Shit's old.

1613
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,130
They still use it for like graphic 
design and stuff.

1614
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:03,964
Right.
Like with like do they still have great 

1615
01:15:06,370 --> 01:15:08,980
towers towers,
but it's definitely.

1616
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:11,020
Mine was like a PC.
It was old,

1617
01:15:11,021 --> 01:15:12,100
ugly.
It had a back.

1618
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:15,220
That's how you seen that one.
That apple makes it look like a.

1619
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,760
Some sort of like an alien.
Hi,

1620
01:15:16,780 --> 01:15:17,613
love it.
What is that thing called power as the 

1621
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,770
computer things to put my daddy out of 
business.

1622
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:26,450
What did you call the Mac pro pro?
Yeah,

1623
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,303
but it's like it's a piece of sculpture,
like you look at it like glue getting 

1624
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,410
bought up by.
What's weird is they sell that.

1625
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,273
Would that be a bad thing?
Now they don't sell the display this 

1626
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:39,214
thing,
so they sell that but they don't sell 

1627
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:43,000
display for it anymore.
Okay.

1628
01:15:43,001 --> 01:15:45,580
How's that work?
Supposed to use the oldest play that you

1629
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:47,950
had,
they only want to repeat customers.

1630
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:48,784
Jamie.
Price it out to like with the best 

1631
01:15:49,961 --> 01:15:51,980
specs.
It's amazing how expensive this thing.

1632
01:15:52,010 --> 01:15:53,500
Six hundred and 74 bucks.

1633
01:15:53,780 --> 01:15:55,590
That's why I've never heard of that 
site.

1634
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,320
Real quick.
Hold on.

1635
01:15:56,320 --> 01:15:57,153
Yeah,
there.

1636
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:01,870
I think the last time I did it,
I think it was like $10,000 or even more

1637
01:16:01,871 --> 01:16:03,520
than that.
For the top of the line.

1638
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,440
Would someone use something like that 
for,

1639
01:16:05,441 --> 01:16:07,220
for like photoshop,
video,

1640
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,550
video,
video editing,

1641
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:10,384
four k video editing video.
Like literally look at that beautiful 

1642
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:16,120
thing yet.
So beautiful.

1643
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:20,340
Built for creativity on an epic scale.
Is that what you said?

1644
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,380
Oh Wow.
New power structure.

1645
01:16:23,381 --> 01:16:24,520
Whoa.
Well come on man.

1646
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:25,533
You opened the top of that thing.
Tell me if it doesn't look like 

1647
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:29,770
something Malians made.
We found this on another planet.

1648
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,570
We'd be like,
Holy Shit.

1649
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:32,613
We found the motherland.
This world life is created like a hover 

1650
01:16:36,941 --> 01:16:40,450
around it or ship it.
I mean a daily folks.

1651
01:16:40,451 --> 01:16:44,020
We are in a fucking science fiction 
where we really are,

1652
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:48,600
which is just creeping up on us.
So slowly it was the um,

1653
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,860
what was it that,
it just showed acoustic levels?

1654
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:55,000
Acoustic global media was so quiet and 
clear,

1655
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:56,283
but that was that animation,
like he's printing it out now like 

1656
01:16:58,691 --> 01:17:02,110
graphics,
you can get six gigabytes dual amd,

1657
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,480
a six fuck 10,000 patients looking at it
and thank

1658
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:10,910
you for,
to monitor.

1659
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,760
It's actually a lot cheaper than board 
or monitor with that.

1660
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:20,560
The difference between what that can do,
a regular Imac can do is just time or is

1661
01:17:25,131 --> 01:17:26,420
there anything that,
that can do that.

1662
01:17:26,421 --> 01:17:28,160
And I'm just would not be able to do.

1663
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:29,173
It's mostly speed,
but because of the video card it has to 

1664
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:33,170
like the,
uh,

1665
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:34,880
the.
I make the best Imac now.

1666
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,133
I'm pretty sure it really is just the 
best like mobile card you could have 

1667
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:43,730
because it would fit inside a laptop.
Like this is way beyond that.

1668
01:17:43,731 --> 01:17:44,564
So like I don't think you could do,
you can get four k display because it's 

1669
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:50,480
a four k display on the Imac,
but it's still like,

1670
01:17:50,570 --> 01:17:53,960
it's the very bottom of it where this 
one you can do multiple monitors.

1671
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:56,360
There's some interesting render it 
faster too.

1672
01:17:56,450 --> 01:17:59,060
There's some,
there's some interesting benchmarks that

1673
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:03,980
I read recently that it actually showed 
the Imac is faster than that at certain,

1674
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:07,700
at video editing and stuff like that 
because those graphic cards don't have,

1675
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:08,480
are those,
uh,

1676
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,313
processors aren't as fast as the 
processor that's in the Imac for some 

1677
01:18:12,951 --> 01:18:13,784
reason.
They have like the IMF has like speed 

1678
01:18:15,021 --> 01:18:19,060
boost technology were the ones in there 
doesn't like.

1679
01:18:19,130 --> 01:18:23,340
There was a weird thing I just read 
recently about how I was something.

1680
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:26,160
This is making me dizzy.
This whole conversation.

1681
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,770
Whatever they did here,

1682
01:18:27,860 --> 01:18:31,640
it was 27 inch Imac with retina five k 
display.

1683
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:33,350
Yes.
Yeah,

1684
01:18:33,650 --> 01:18:35,690
it's much faster.
That's crazy.

1685
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:36,590
Yeah.
Isn't that weird?

1686
01:18:36,591 --> 01:18:38,720
I just read about this.
So what's the point in that thing?

1687
01:18:38,721 --> 01:18:39,554
Just to look good.
I like to look like I know what I'm 

1688
01:18:41,241 --> 01:18:42,750
doing.
I want to have one of the macros.

1689
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,990
It looks sexy,
Jamie.

1690
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:48,050
Not Space.
I'm gives you more space,

1691
01:18:48,051 --> 01:18:48,884
doesn't it?

1692
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:52,020
I like space saving.
I didn't mean like digital space.

1693
01:18:52,021 --> 01:18:53,940
I meant like,
no for your office,

1694
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:56,620
but that would.
I'm actually give you more space because

1695
01:18:56,621 --> 01:18:57,730
it's all in one piece.

1696
01:18:58,570 --> 01:18:59,403
Honestly,
I don't know what the reason is for 

1697
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:02,080
buying it anymore is.

1698
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,153
Yeah,
because the other thing you would have 

1699
01:19:03,491 --> 01:19:04,570
to get a monitor for.

1700
01:19:04,800 --> 01:19:09,800
I have the 27 inch Imac for k retina,
not the five k and it's fast as fuck.

1701
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,440
I've NSSD on there and stuff like that.
It renders so fast.

1702
01:19:13,441 --> 01:19:17,810
I can't even imagine it being faster,
so there's limitations on the processors

1703
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:20,940
that the IMF could handle it.
This can handle faster processing and it

1704
01:19:20,941 --> 01:19:22,770
would be specific to what you're 
actually doing.

1705
01:19:22,771 --> 01:19:24,300
Like you would.
If we needed one,

1706
01:19:24,301 --> 01:19:26,610
we would have to get it built 
specifically to some use.

1707
01:19:26,611 --> 01:19:29,580
We would have to find for it like not 
everyone really needs these.

1708
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,390
Right.
Let

1709
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,970
me ask you this.
Does apple sell a monitor anymore?

1710
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,330
Now they just got rid of it.
That's so ridiculous.

1711
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:39,270
The Imac was the same price as the 
Monitor.

1712
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:42,960
No steering wheel.
Figure it out.

1713
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:44,910
We don't.
We don't like windshields.

1714
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:47,310
Get your own.
Once you get it.

1715
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:48,833
Watching a Spanish channel.
I have no idea what you guys talking 

1716
01:19:51,151 --> 01:19:53,040
about.
Talking about computer stuff,

1717
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:56,430
mainly friends told me that computers 
were only have faith.

1718
01:19:56,440 --> 01:19:57,273
I don't know what you guys are talking.
What was your dad like when he had a 

1719
01:19:59,401 --> 01:20:02,010
close the typewriter store and give up 
on a dream?

1720
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,263
Very,
very upset that it had to be such a 

1721
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:05,214
bummer.
Very upset because people who love 

1722
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:08,030
mechanical things,

1723
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:11,490
typewriters like that when something 
comes along and just takes out a way.

1724
01:20:11,700 --> 01:20:13,860
Yeah.
My grandpa,

1725
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:14,843
he built tools specifically for 
typewriters that can only fix 

1726
01:20:17,491 --> 01:20:19,890
typewriters,
but he never marketed them.

1727
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:20,783
He thought he cornered,
like everybody would come to different 

1728
01:20:24,510 --> 01:20:27,090
Irish mentality because of like hipsters
and stuff.

1729
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,520
Our typewriters on an upswing now it's 
still not bringing it a little.

1730
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:34,890
It's got a tiny little heartbeat but not
like.

1731
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:39,070
Because they buy them and then they just
put them there for decorative feature.

1732
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:40,500
It's not like,
oh,

1733
01:20:40,501 --> 01:20:44,940
I have to get all these letters out 
today or whatever it is.

1734
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:45,793
I was actually going to do that very 
thing until you just brought it up and 

1735
01:20:47,341 --> 01:20:49,020
humiliated my idea.
So.

1736
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:50,880
Oh No,
it's what people do.

1737
01:20:50,881 --> 01:20:52,650
I mean,
I have it to my sister,

1738
01:20:52,651 --> 01:20:53,484
Karen has her bad ass,
but I wouldn't unless it was someone's 

1739
01:20:55,591 --> 01:20:56,310
cool.

1740
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,370
My Dad has ancient ones.
We're right in the beginning.

1741
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:04,280
Typewriter Imac.
Oh my God.

1742
01:21:04,290 --> 01:21:07,200
That's hilarious.
If I could get that from my dad,

1743
01:21:07,201 --> 01:21:09,560
he would play with.
He would play with that.

1744
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:14,900
Let's look it attaches to a fucking 
screen and old school typewriter.

1745
01:21:15,301 --> 01:21:16,134
Convert your favorite typewriter so they
can take yours and they can convert it 

1746
01:21:19,990 --> 01:21:20,823
to that.
Have to send this to my dad's wife 

1747
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,190
because she will do that for him.
That is fucking brilliant.

1748
01:21:26,191 --> 01:21:28,830
And it's still as the only bought him an
ipad for Christmas,

1749
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,300
so he.
He knows that.

1750
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,253
Look how it's typing.
It's typing on that flat thing and it 

1751
01:21:33,361 --> 01:21:35,040
still has the ribbon in there.
What the hell is it?

1752
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:37,800
Need the ribbon for?
I think that's how it's reading.

1753
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:38,880
The type stroll.
Yeah.

1754
01:21:38,890 --> 01:21:39,511
Huh?
Yeah.

1755
01:21:39,511 --> 01:21:41,950
Okay.
Oh my God.

1756
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:46,970
I can come back.
Maybe that'd be fun to type or write on.

1757
01:21:48,470 --> 01:21:51,220
You know,
it might still types on paper too.

1758
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,160
Wow.
Oh my God.

1759
01:21:53,161 --> 01:21:53,994
This is awesome.
Turn off your monitor for an authentic 

1760
01:21:57,331 --> 01:21:59,580
experience.
What in the fuck are you saying,

1761
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:00,473
I love this,
this is amazing and I'm sending this to 

1762
01:22:02,641 --> 01:22:04,480
my dad immediately.
Well,

1763
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:05,343
I sent it to his girlfriend and then she
has to explain how to turn it on and 

1764
01:22:08,731 --> 01:22:10,170
listen.
We'll give.

1765
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:12,700
They give up that guy's email.
Oh,

1766
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:20,340
here comes a funder.
That's cool.

1767
01:22:20,341 --> 01:22:21,570
That's.
Oh I see.

1768
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:24,000
So there's different ones.
One of them works,

1769
01:22:24,001 --> 01:22:28,650
it just goes side to side with an ipad.
So the ipad actually pat is what?

1770
01:22:28,651 --> 01:22:29,484
We got them for Christmas so that would 
be a cool thing to teach them to put it 

1771
01:22:32,851 --> 01:22:35,880
on there because he literally.
He is saddened by.

1772
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:37,320
Yeah,
I wouldn't progress.

1773
01:22:37,321 --> 01:22:38,154
I mean it was all he knew.
Do you know the woody Allen still types 

1774
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:43,170
on an old typewriter that you had like 
in the seventies?

1775
01:22:43,410 --> 01:22:44,243
Yes.
I always seen that and it's kind of 

1776
01:22:46,081 --> 01:22:48,720
interesting man.
I have heard that a few people,

1777
01:22:48,721 --> 01:22:50,850
Tom Hanks to Tom Hanks is big.
I mean,

1778
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:54,690
I don't think he type scripts on it,
but he's big on collecting them and some

1779
01:22:54,691 --> 01:22:55,524
of his people were in my dad's 
typewriter store like 20 years ago and 

1780
01:22:59,191 --> 01:22:59,761
they were like,
hey,

1781
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:02,080
we want this because my dad has his old 
one,

1782
01:23:02,081 --> 01:23:04,260
like that's probably worth a lot of 
money,

1783
01:23:04,261 --> 01:23:05,510
but my dad just it like

1784
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:09,130
it's not smart.
And so they were like,

1785
01:23:09,131 --> 01:23:09,964
yeah,
we'll buy that from you for a lot of 

1786
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,040
money.
And they.

1787
01:23:12,100 --> 01:23:15,880
My Dad went and sell it,
a perverts cabin here.

1788
01:23:16,570 --> 01:23:18,760
That's my dad's house.
How dare you.

1789
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:22,750
And we're hoping with Woody Allen with 
his ancient keyboard.

1790
01:23:22,751 --> 01:23:25,830
It's really interesting actually because
he's like,

1791
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,610
he goes over his whole process of how we
kind it is.

1792
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,810
It uses just regular paper.
No,

1793
01:23:31,811 --> 01:23:32,200
no,
no.

1794
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:36,790
The typewriter.
Is it an underwood or is it a royal he.

1795
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:39,140
He looks like he writes on yellow legal 
papers.

1796
01:23:39,141 --> 01:23:40,750
I would that.
Is that what that looks like?

1797
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:44,620
Or is it just the lighting?
It looks like it's not big onlining.

1798
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:45,840
He likes everything in yellow.

1799
01:23:49,170 --> 01:23:51,290
The setup,
the setup,

1800
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:54,470
the swing.
Oh,

1801
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,060
Scott,
ladies and gentlemen,

1802
01:23:57,070 --> 01:23:57,903
the coffee yet.
But maybe we are making a comeback 

1803
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:07,120
hunter s Thompson type only.
Yeah.

1804
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,350
You never know.
I learned how to type.

1805
01:24:09,190 --> 01:24:10,023
How about that?
That got so many books and he would 

1806
01:24:11,891 --> 01:24:13,310
type,
finger,

1807
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:15,290
click,
click,

1808
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:17,170
click,
click,

1809
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,390
click.
You never seen him,

1810
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,823
dude.
You got to watch Johnny Depp because of 

1811
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,220
the amazing impression of him in that 
movie.

1812
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:26,800
Um,
which one was it?

1813
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,510
But yeah,
it was fear and loathing.

1814
01:24:28,511 --> 01:24:30,160
But it was also he.
Oh,

1815
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:32,560
that's what it was.
He was the narrator of.

1816
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:37,770
They played it also in the Gonzo life 
and times of Dr. Hunter s Thompson.

1817
01:24:38,501 --> 01:24:39,334
That's an IBM selectric for it.
That is how he would write like 

1818
01:24:41,981 --> 01:24:43,750
literally like that.
What does that,

1819
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,620
what electric three look like?
That's the one that 100 years,

1820
01:24:47,621 --> 01:24:49,990
I guess the ball or the ball.

1821
01:24:49,990 --> 01:24:51,280
That's right.
I remember the ball.

1822
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,860
That was like the next step up.
Right.

1823
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:55,973
And then Smith Corona came out with kind
of a word processor that my dad was 

1824
01:24:59,201 --> 01:25:01,030
selling,
but that that's the one that used to get

1825
01:25:01,031 --> 01:25:02,800
mad at because when you put labels 
through it,

1826
01:25:03,190 --> 01:25:04,023
it would seep through and the Google 
would come out and it would make 

1827
01:25:06,641 --> 01:25:09,370
everything stick so it would screw up 
the.

1828
01:25:09,460 --> 01:25:10,293
That's why my dad said computers are 
only a phase because the labels 

1829
01:25:13,331 --> 01:25:14,164
properly.
It's kind of crazy how quick it 

1830
01:25:16,901 --> 01:25:17,734
happened.
If you look at the history of the 

1831
01:25:18,941 --> 01:25:20,560
typewriter,
the typewriter been around,

1832
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:23,470
how dare you not know.
You're right.

1833
01:25:23,670 --> 01:25:24,371
I,
you know,

1834
01:25:24,371 --> 01:25:24,761
if you.
Okay,

1835
01:25:24,761 --> 01:25:25,720
let's guess what,
guess what?

1836
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:27,430
He was teaching us to play with 
grenades.

1837
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,990
Not Kidding.
What would you,

1838
01:25:30,030 --> 01:25:30,863
if you had to guess?
18,

1839
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,980
27.
Well that's a killer.

1840
01:25:32,981 --> 01:25:34,300
Guests.
But I would go lower.

1841
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,490
Go.
Who would you go?

1842
01:25:36,491 --> 01:25:38,070
Elena?
17 something?

1843
01:25:38,071 --> 01:25:40,410
No,
I think I'd probably go with you because

1844
01:25:40,411 --> 01:25:43,150
your dad owns a typewriter store.
So I'm just gonna copy off you.

1845
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:45,580
What did you come up with?
You're right.

1846
01:25:45,581 --> 01:25:47,490
It's probably earlier,
but I mean,

1847
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:49,080
I don't know.
I mean,

1848
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:51,490
I could see that one that my dad has.
That was one of the.

1849
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:55,000
Almost at the first,
if I had a guest,

1850
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:59,230
I feel like I feel like you're going to 
go with 1797.

1851
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:04,460
Going to ride the line first obtained 
patent Britain for a machine

1852
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:07,520
that did something similar to a 
typewriter with 17,

1853
01:26:07,521 --> 01:26:10,660
14,
18.

1854
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:11,031
Oh,
two.

1855
01:26:11,031 --> 01:26:13,730
One was developed and developed them.
18 slash 20.

1856
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:14,950
Oh eight.
The,

1857
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:17,710
another one was developed but 18,
15,

1858
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:18,553
75 and a titan printmaker named 
Francisco [inaudible] invented the 

1859
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:26,510
scurried into something on a machine 
that impresses letters in the paper.

1860
01:26:26,570 --> 01:26:28,180
So that's a typewriter base in the 
truest.

1861
01:26:28,530 --> 01:26:29,363
Yeah.
That's basically a typewriter or will 

1862
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:33,720
they have exactly when?
Yeah,

1863
01:26:33,780 --> 01:26:35,430
I was pretty impressed.
Like $1,500.

1864
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:35,971
Oh,
printing.

1865
01:26:35,971 --> 01:26:36,804
Press me press.

1866
01:26:37,010 --> 01:26:37,970
Yeah,
that's what he's saying.

1867
01:26:37,971 --> 01:26:40,060
That on the paper,
put the what?

1868
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,360
That is a printing press then,
right?

1869
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:45,050
Because the $1,500 a machine that 
impressed letters on paper.

1870
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:47,990
I guess what was the year that 15 slash 
75.

1871
01:26:48,350 --> 01:26:52,310
When was Martin Luther?
Because that was one of the things about

1872
01:26:52,311 --> 01:26:54,230
Martin Luther's translation of the 
Bible,

1873
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:55,760
right?
Was that he was able to print it.

1874
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:57,853
That's,
that sounds like a stamp that what 

1875
01:26:58,911 --> 01:27:01,310
you're talking about.
Like this is just like a stamp,

1876
01:27:01,311 --> 01:27:03,430
not a Typo.
It's not like going to Kinko's.

1877
01:27:04,830 --> 01:27:06,140
No,
no.

1878
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,233
I mean this patent at Jamie's talking 
about because it's just like putting 

1879
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:11,640
imprint on a paper.
Yeah.

1880
01:27:11,641 --> 01:27:15,810
So it's not like a press.
Got It.

1881
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,880
Got It.
So hard to remember where.

1882
01:27:21,650 --> 01:27:24,560
Whoa,
look at that fucking thing is.

1883
01:27:24,590 --> 01:27:26,980
It's same scripture.
Mechanica.

1884
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:27,943
Can you go full screen?
It looks like you see the one in the 

1885
01:27:30,651 --> 01:27:31,490
middle.
My Dad has.

1886
01:27:32,990 --> 01:27:34,370
How does that work?
Oh,

1887
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,233
that's.
So you would push down on those buttons 

1888
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:39,600
on the top and it would write things 
down on the bottom.

1889
01:27:39,601 --> 01:27:44,330
Is that what will go on shift?
Look how weird that is.

1890
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:46,250
That crank is your shift,
right?

1891
01:27:46,251 --> 01:27:47,930
So eleanor fetus through that.
What is.

1892
01:27:47,931 --> 01:27:50,180
Or talk us through the,
like this one.

1893
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:51,033
It feed the paper into the bottom and 
then I'm assuming that crank is your 

1894
01:27:55,130 --> 01:27:57,300
shift to get you across.
Yeah.

1895
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,660
The one on the bumper.
Yeah,

1896
01:27:59,750 --> 01:28:00,740
what's the one on the bottom?

1897
01:28:01,060 --> 01:28:01,893
That's what like the came from the 
printing press because that's how you 

1898
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:07,780
would press your paper and turn it down 
and let it lay coasts.

1899
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:09,630
Taught me how to do that.
How weird.

1900
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:12,360
This place in Columbus called coast side
of.

1901
01:28:12,361 --> 01:28:13,194
They have this street to yesteryear and 
you can literally go and like make wax 

1902
01:28:15,921 --> 01:28:18,530
candles and use a printing press.
Did you make Botha?

1903
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:20,630
Uh,
I don't think they have butter there.

1904
01:28:20,631 --> 01:28:25,310
That's another part of Ohio,
but they don't make butter in Ohio,

1905
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:27,980
but they do it.
There's another part of the learned that

1906
01:28:27,981 --> 01:28:28,940
I wasn't at that place.

1907
01:28:29,490 --> 01:28:30,323
Old School stuff is cool man.
I saw this old lady in Montana and this 

1908
01:28:34,531 --> 01:28:35,364
historic recreation of a house.
There's like this museum of Bozeman in 

1909
01:28:39,001 --> 01:28:39,834
the Museum of Bozeman.
They have these people that are making 

1910
01:28:42,511 --> 01:28:47,511
wool yarn and so she's got wool out and 
she's running it through the spindle and

1911
01:28:47,871 --> 01:28:48,704
as she's running through the spindle,
she's turning it into thread and 

1912
01:28:50,371 --> 01:28:51,204
attaching more wool to it.
She was explaining how the wool just 

1913
01:28:54,151 --> 01:28:54,984
clings to other wall that it's got some 
sort of a tension thing or an 

1914
01:28:58,681 --> 01:29:02,100
attractant,
like a little barbs or something

1915
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:02,933
like that.
Something that sticks out and like and 

1916
01:29:04,340 --> 01:29:05,173
you rub the wools together.
They kind of cling to each other and so 

1917
01:29:07,321 --> 01:29:10,810
she was doing this all by hand and foot 
like old school.

1918
01:29:10,811 --> 01:29:12,870
He and making and doing it like in real 
time,

1919
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:17,760
like she'd pull out these big tufts of 
this wool that just sheered from a lamb.

1920
01:29:17,910 --> 01:29:21,630
She'd take it and she just started 
attaching it and she's talking to us and

1921
01:29:21,631 --> 01:29:24,480
pumping this pedal and making this wall.
It's pretty bad ass man.

1922
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,540
Yeah,
I've done that before that.

1923
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:26,383
They do that a lot.
There's a lot of that shit in Ohio and 

1924
01:29:28,551 --> 01:29:30,500
they also Williamsburg,
West Virginia,

1925
01:29:30,910 --> 01:29:33,800
like that whole town where they have 
like real fights.

1926
01:29:33,801 --> 01:29:36,680
They have real blacksmiths and it goes 
to.

1927
01:29:39,020 --> 01:29:40,760
Yeah,
people get weird what recreation's,

1928
01:29:40,761 --> 01:29:43,820
but that was cruel.
It was pretty cool because it is part of

1929
01:29:43,821 --> 01:29:45,020
the history thing.
You can't get mad.

1930
01:29:45,021 --> 01:29:45,854
I mean that's not weird.
Like the civil war stuff's weird and 

1931
01:29:48,681 --> 01:29:53,000
they recreate that.
It is uncomfortable for all of us,

1932
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:55,130
but some of us just saying,
but it is,

1933
01:29:55,131 --> 01:29:57,890
it is a weird thing,
but if part of the history,

1934
01:29:57,891 --> 01:30:00,860
so don't you think with the history of 
people recruiting war,

1935
01:30:01,710 --> 01:30:05,540
like we don't know what happened are 
coming over the top.

1936
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:08,360
They're pretending to reward.
Trying to fight to keep their slaves.

1937
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:11,780
They might get shot at my dad shot me 
with a musket,

1938
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,850
but what I'm saying is that like it's.
I don't know,

1939
01:30:14,210 --> 01:30:17,120
it's strange.
It's a strange thing to recreate that,

1940
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:21,560
but at least I don't know.
I don't know.

1941
01:30:21,980 --> 01:30:23,960
But at least this lady Megan,
this wool,

1942
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:26,630
like when she's making this wool,
now you know how they did it.

1943
01:30:26,630 --> 01:30:28,880
Like you could watch,
oh I'm watching her do it,

1944
01:30:29,150 --> 01:30:29,983
you know,
like it's not a lost skill because we 

1945
01:30:31,821 --> 01:30:32,720
would.
Oh yeah.

1946
01:30:32,820 --> 01:30:34,730
Otherwise you know,
you and I if you and I were like,

1947
01:30:34,731 --> 01:30:36,890
how do they make wool yarn?
Fuck,

1948
01:30:36,891 --> 01:30:39,050
I don't know.
How the fuck do they do it?

1949
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,360
Left us with a bunch of wool and we're 
like,

1950
01:30:41,361 --> 01:30:42,290
dude,
we got to make yarn.

1951
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:43,000
We'll do.
They tell us.

1952
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,090
Oh No,
we have to figure it out.

1953
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:46,130
Fuck sure.
There's a youtube video.

1954
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:47,480
Yeah,
but what if you couldn't get online?

1955
01:30:47,650 --> 01:30:50,180
What if you're just sitting in a room 
and empty room with a pile of bull?

1956
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:51,223
What are you going to survive?
You're not going to make star not going 

1957
01:30:53,601 --> 01:30:54,560
to make clothes for you.
Okay.

1958
01:30:54,740 --> 01:30:56,420
No,
I'm just.

1959
01:30:56,540 --> 01:30:58,730
I'm just thinking about that.
Like how would you.

1960
01:30:58,731 --> 01:31:00,830
What would you do that?
Oh my God,

1961
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:04,820
there I am.
The old spinster.

1962
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:05,983
Yeah.
They used to think those old William 

1963
01:31:07,411 --> 01:31:08,244
were cursing them.

1964
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:10,670
That's exactly sleeping.
Beauty came from.

1965
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:17,880
I really liked my mom and dad used to 
click singer sewing machines.

1966
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:25,780
The old ones were old iron wines and you
have to like get new rubber stopper.

1967
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,450
Rubbers gotten bad,
but my could.

1968
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:30,383
In Ohio there's so many barns and 
they're about to tear down these barns 

1969
01:31:32,811 --> 01:31:35,620
and they have barn sales.
We'd just go and like,

1970
01:31:35,621 --> 01:31:36,454
I see anything you want in there.
My Dad would go to them and just take 

1971
01:31:38,571 --> 01:31:39,404
all the singer sewing machines because 
they always had sewing machines in them 

1972
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:45,110
for that kind of reason.
Like shaving sheep and making.

1973
01:31:46,700 --> 01:31:49,040
Yeah,
I mean I would be terrified to do that,

1974
01:31:49,041 --> 01:31:51,190
but the people that did it for years,
yeah,

1975
01:31:51,260 --> 01:31:55,650
they did it for a long fucking time and 
my sister had bad at that.

1976
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:58,280
Has that almost exact one right there.
If you could make clothes,

1977
01:31:58,281 --> 01:32:00,040
go back to that one.
If you can make

1978
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,730
clothes with that one that you're 
pumping with your feet.

1979
01:32:01,731 --> 01:32:04,880
And my grandma had one of those.
My grandma said,

1980
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:07,690
pick one like that I think are maybe up 
there.

1981
01:32:08,110 --> 01:32:10,780
My grandma had a bunch of cool old stuff
like that.

1982
01:32:10,930 --> 01:32:11,763
Yeah.
I used to love just broke down and my 

1983
01:32:13,451 --> 01:32:15,910
foot is your grandma.
Does she do that?

1984
01:32:16,330 --> 01:32:18,730
I don't really remember her making any 
clothes.

1985
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:20,290
I don't remember.
I mean maybe she did.

1986
01:32:20,291 --> 01:32:21,760
She probably did.
I just don't remember.

1987
01:32:22,990 --> 01:32:23,950
I remember,
uh,

1988
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,900
she was ill like the last years of her 
life,

1989
01:32:25,901 --> 01:32:26,734
so I mostly remember that unfortunately 
because it was all during the formative 

1990
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:30,550
years.
But that thing,

1991
01:32:30,551 --> 01:32:32,740
go back to that Jamie Lukow.
Beautiful.

1992
01:32:32,741 --> 01:32:33,574
That thing is like the craftsmanship and
the design and like if you look at the 

1993
01:32:37,691 --> 01:32:40,560
gold that's in the a sewing machine 
thing itself,

1994
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,660
it's so pretty.
It is really cool.

1995
01:32:43,690 --> 01:32:44,523
My sister designed costumes for,
her daughter is a dancer and she would 

1996
01:32:48,461 --> 01:32:49,294
do a recital every year and Karen also,
my older sister would go and like while 

1997
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:57,580
the shows were happening,
she would stitch stuff up as well.

1998
01:32:57,790 --> 01:32:58,623
And a couple a years ago she had to like
straight pins in her and she was like 

1999
01:33:03,550 --> 01:33:04,690
helping their kids.
You know,

2000
01:33:04,691 --> 01:33:05,524
they're young.
So Karen's like putting all the stuff 

2001
01:33:06,761 --> 01:33:07,594
together.
She was fixing somebody's thing and 

2002
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:11,080
somebody called her and she went and she
wanted.

2003
01:33:12,490 --> 01:33:17,490
She swallowed the Pan Pan or long.
My crazy sister to do.

2004
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:21,100
There's nothing you can do.
What's shut my mother is like,

2005
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:21,934
is that big rusting in your body,
have to absorb it and somebody's going 

2006
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:28,150
to absorb it.
Is it stainless steel?

2007
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:31,640
I guess I could take a long foot.
Is she getting into her lung?

2008
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:34,280
They saw it are open like a fish.
Get it out of there.

2009
01:33:34,290 --> 01:33:36,790
Yeah,
cut me crazy and making shit.

2010
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:37,780
It's been.
It's been a while.

2011
01:33:37,781 --> 01:33:41,080
Maybe it's more than two years,
but I'm saying the wrong ones,

2012
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:45,790
but I remember she had blood work done 
or something done and they were like,

2013
01:33:45,791 --> 01:33:46,480
Hey,
do.

2014
01:33:46,480 --> 01:33:49,090
She was some metal something,
whatever.

2015
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:52,900
What about when she goes to the is what 
happened?

2016
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:55,600
Oh my God,
that's so crazy.

2017
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:58,450
I don't think she's had any problem at 
the airport.

2018
01:33:58,451 --> 01:34:00,290
It could have got stuck on the way down.
Easy.

2019
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:05,150
And then in her lung,
something crazy.

2020
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:08,590
Oh my God.
My crazy sister.

2021
01:34:08,591 --> 01:34:09,430
But you.
That's Karen.

2022
01:34:09,431 --> 01:34:11,750
She's always doing like 5 million things
at once.

2023
01:34:11,751 --> 01:34:14,620
So see this.
Of course she did that.

2024
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:19,270
Of course they haven't heard czar,
but her costumes look great.

2025
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:20,433
What a weird feeling.
Mostly walk around with a knowing her 

2026
01:34:26,140 --> 01:34:29,710
like we want to put a magnet in her 
mouth and see if it comes back up,

2027
01:34:29,740 --> 01:34:30,573
but it seems like she could come off 
wrong and could just rip something open 

2028
01:34:33,281 --> 01:34:35,500
or something,
God forbid.

2029
01:34:35,530 --> 01:34:38,250
But yeah,
I don't think for the big,

2030
01:34:38,350 --> 01:34:42,690
God forbid you cannot think of them.
Did not think about dom arrera.

2031
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:44,920
It's true golf a bit.
What's the South Philly?

2032
01:34:44,921 --> 01:34:45,890
It's how we talk.
Yeah,

2033
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:49,620
everybody.
So it's so dom fitbit,

2034
01:34:50,410 --> 01:34:53,380
he used to make fun of my grandma.
She was saying,

2035
01:34:53,381 --> 01:34:55,900
Oh God forbid it's a sin and a shame 
with that kid.

2036
01:34:55,901 --> 01:34:58,270
Looks like what an awful

2037
01:34:58,270 --> 01:35:00,350
thing.
It's knowing what you know now.

2038
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:02,690
Knowing what you know now.
Let me ask you both this question.

2039
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:06,800
Knowing what you know now,
what time would you like to go back?

2040
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:07,663
If you could.
If there was a time machine you can go 

2041
01:35:08,601 --> 01:35:12,530
back to like the 19 fifties and just run
shit for a little while.

2042
01:35:12,531 --> 01:35:13,364
Those dorks in on enough and back then 
you can just go back and you would know 

2043
01:35:18,531 --> 01:35:20,360
what you know now,
but going back exactly.

2044
01:35:20,420 --> 01:35:22,710
Oh Shit.
What year would it be?

2045
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:26,810
Nineteen teens.
50.

2046
01:35:26,970 --> 01:35:27,803
So maybe I could lead a charge.
You could vote in the fifties when he 

2047
01:35:30,490 --> 01:35:32,990
was suffering.
Now what am I saying?

2048
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,540
For us,
I wouldn't want to give back.

2049
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:36,700
I want to go.
Yeah,

2050
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:37,603
definitely.
Not.

2051
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:39,770
Definitely not.
I just watched it back to the future yet

2052
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,500
it yesterday and it was horrible.
It was.

2053
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,070
I know.
I thought it was fascinating.

2054
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,000
I saw back to the future two with my 
kids at a movie theater.

2055
01:35:47,001 --> 01:35:48,570
And you thought it was terrible.
I loved it.

2056
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:49,513
Oh No.
I wouldn't want to live back in that 

2057
01:35:50,751 --> 01:35:52,020
time.
No,

2058
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,620
definitely.
I love that movie.

2059
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:54,873
The future too.
I,

2060
01:35:54,920 --> 01:35:56,240
I didn't.
I don't think I ever saw it.

2061
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,340
Oh,
I think I only saw one.

2062
01:35:58,710 --> 01:35:59,543
I know I did see two.
I remember it was great and that was 

2063
01:36:02,510 --> 01:36:03,650
this year I think,
right?

2064
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:05,840
Like 2015?
Yeah,

2065
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,340
2015.
Weird.

2066
01:36:07,341 --> 01:36:08,270
When you walk into like,
oh,

2067
01:36:08,271 --> 01:36:09,560
that was.
They were in the future.

2068
01:36:09,620 --> 01:36:12,890
It was a hard time.
So off they missed everything.

2069
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:13,863
They,
everybody thought it was going to be 

2070
01:36:14,331 --> 01:36:15,164
spaceships.
Everybody thought I was going to be 

2071
01:36:16,071 --> 01:36:18,560
hovered for thought I was going to be 
mechanical things.

2072
01:36:18,561 --> 01:36:20,780
No,
it's Pokemon pokey.

2073
01:36:21,180 --> 01:36:23,870
Mon is invaded the world.
Asian of privacy.

2074
01:36:24,080 --> 01:36:25,460
Exactly.
That's what it is.

2075
01:36:25,461 --> 01:36:29,360
It's some sort of a connection between 
all of us in a weird,

2076
01:36:29,361 --> 01:36:29,900
sneaky way.

2077
01:36:29,900 --> 01:36:30,733
It's going to get it in with a game and 
we're going to get used to it just like 

2078
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:33,194
you're used to.
Now people are holding up their phones 

2079
01:36:34,491 --> 01:36:37,100
and take pictures of things and we're 
used to,

2080
01:36:37,101 --> 01:36:38,120
uh,
you know,

2081
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:40,550
people texting each other while they're 
driving.

2082
01:36:40,580 --> 01:36:42,070
Like all this stuff is,
it's all,

2083
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:45,530
it's inevitable.
It's going to be all a part of us.

2084
01:36:45,830 --> 01:36:46,663
We're just going to figure it out.
Trying to figure out a way to absorb us 

2085
01:36:48,411 --> 01:36:51,290
right now and the best way to suck us in
as a game.

2086
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:53,160
You don't think it observable absorbs.
That's right.

2087
01:36:53,161 --> 01:36:53,890
Yeah.
But it's even,

2088
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:56,090
it's deep and it's not going to go 
further.

2089
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:56,481
Yeah.
Like,

2090
01:36:56,481 --> 01:36:58,280
technology's not gonna stop and go.
You know what?

2091
01:36:58,490 --> 01:36:59,323
I think we're good.
I think we've achieved a certain level 

2092
01:37:01,491 --> 01:37:03,830
of success with people.
We know that they love us.

2093
01:37:03,831 --> 01:37:04,760
They're going to keep us around.

2094
01:37:04,790 --> 01:37:05,623
Yeah.
Nobody stays there are always looking 

2095
01:37:06,741 --> 01:37:08,720
for the next best thing.
Like you always yell.

2096
01:37:08,721 --> 01:37:12,110
Where are the flying cars?
Flying cars were in the jet packs.

2097
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:13,980
Jet Packs all of it.
Yeah.

2098
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:17,570
Well what was the mechanical things?
What everybody expected?

2099
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:19,730
Because the mechanical things where the 
biggest leaps,

2100
01:37:19,940 --> 01:37:20,773
like think about before there was a car 
before there was a car and then 

2101
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:24,590
afterwards a car.
Whoa,

2102
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:26,540
how nutty.
I mean look what the fuck happened.

2103
01:37:26,541 --> 01:37:27,374
People just came across the country on 
wheels and built fucking houses 

2104
01:37:30,291 --> 01:37:34,130
everywhere and they drive with shit back
and forth and they're shipping things on

2105
01:37:34,131 --> 01:37:34,964
trucks and food on trucks and you can 
get food to places that could ever get 

2106
01:37:38,181 --> 01:37:39,014
it before.
So that's a game changer when they 

2107
01:37:40,761 --> 01:37:43,280
invented the car and that's just a 
machine.

2108
01:37:43,281 --> 01:37:44,114
So we,
I think all of us growing up in that 

2109
01:37:45,381 --> 01:37:46,214
era,
like in our time we looked at like we 

2110
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:50,900
thought it was going to be a machine,
it's going to be some crazy robot.

2111
01:37:50,901 --> 01:37:51,734
It was going to be a jet pack.
We're going to be something that showed 

2112
01:37:53,871 --> 01:37:56,340
us that we're living in the jetsons,
but no state something,

2113
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:57,810
something no one ever saw coming

2114
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:02,410
information way information.
I remember my grandma telling me she was

2115
01:38:02,411 --> 01:38:07,180
so afraid of cars and the fact that my 
grandpa drove like a maniac.

2116
01:38:07,181 --> 01:38:08,830
He probably drank and drove because it 
was,

2117
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:09,753
you know,
long time ago and she was so afraid she 

2118
01:38:12,431 --> 01:38:13,264
would lay on the back seat on the floor 
and just her and her best friend would 

2119
01:38:16,990 --> 01:38:18,550
lay on the back and I'm like,
wow.

2120
01:38:18,580 --> 01:38:21,180
Like I would never think to be afraid of
cars.

2121
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:22,480
You getting anything,
you know what I mean?

2122
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:23,860
Getting any car,
it's awesome.

2123
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:24,940
You know,
it works,

2124
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:26,143
you know,
it's great.

2125
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:28,780
But it was still coming up

2126
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:31,880
from my grandma.
Well Byron bowers,

2127
01:38:32,620 --> 01:38:34,090
funny,
hilarious dude.

2128
01:38:34,760 --> 01:38:35,593
Great fucking guy.
So he's going to be on here in a couple 

2129
01:38:38,441 --> 01:38:39,850
of weeks.
Byron,

2130
01:38:39,910 --> 01:38:40,743
his grandmother remembers someone in her
family telling her a story about them 

2131
01:38:46,751 --> 01:38:49,630
remembering the cotton gin.
Wow.

2132
01:38:50,100 --> 01:38:51,850
Yeah,
that's crazy.

2133
01:38:52,690 --> 01:38:56,050
Crazy.
I mean this is a direct connection.

2134
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:57,393
Like she,
like his family goes straight back to 

2135
01:39:00,941 --> 01:39:01,910
slavery.
Like he,

2136
01:39:01,930 --> 01:39:02,763
they can track it.
They remember they remember the people 

2137
01:39:04,691 --> 01:39:06,610
that are picking cottons.
Grandma,

2138
01:39:06,611 --> 01:39:08,010
this is great grandma.
You know,

2139
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:10,550
there's still cotton pickers.
Do you know that?

2140
01:39:10,940 --> 01:39:15,130
Of course y'all sure it never went away.
It never went away.

2141
01:39:16,220 --> 01:39:17,210
There was a,
I forget,

2142
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:19,760
there was a black guy and he goes,
I'm a cotton picker,

2143
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:20,623
is there was a video all about it and 
then it showed all of his friends 

2144
01:39:23,841 --> 01:39:25,070
working and there's just like,
Hey,

2145
01:39:25,071 --> 01:39:27,170
what's up?
And it's funny how you think that,

2146
01:39:27,290 --> 01:39:28,123
oh no,
you're not allowed to even talk about 

2147
01:39:30,310 --> 01:39:35,190
cotton anymore to do it now.
But yeah,

2148
01:39:35,210 --> 01:39:37,690
it's a weird job for black dudes 
gravitate towards.

2149
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:38,873
It's like,
why did you think you were a rebel 

2150
01:39:41,751 --> 01:39:42,170
against,

2151
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:43,800
you know?
Oh,

2152
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:46,490
you know,
I know.

2153
01:39:46,491 --> 01:39:47,324
But Paul Mooney used to tell us crazy 
stories and I remember one time we had 

2154
01:39:50,511 --> 01:39:52,400
this manager,
I forget his name,

2155
01:39:52,401 --> 01:39:53,930
there was so many managers at the comedy
store,

2156
01:39:53,931 --> 01:39:55,700
but Paul would tell me all these crazy 
stories.

2157
01:39:55,701 --> 01:39:59,330
He was raised by his grandma,
who was his mom.

2158
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,610
Her mom was a slave,
literally.

2159
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,593
So,
so he would tell stories and if you 

2160
01:40:03,591 --> 01:40:04,251
think about it,
I mean,

2161
01:40:04,251 --> 01:40:07,860
Paul's in his eighties,
so his grandma could.

2162
01:40:07,861 --> 01:40:12,861
It was Paulo Have Paula Paul that old,
I think he's his late seventies.

2163
01:40:14,001 --> 01:40:14,970
Possibly add.
Yeah.

2164
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:16,453
And um,
but he would tell me all these stories 

2165
01:40:17,751 --> 01:40:18,584
in the manager was like slavery that 
they haven't had like thousands of 

2166
01:40:22,791 --> 01:40:23,600
years.
I was like,

2167
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,720
are you high?
He was serious.

2168
01:40:26,900 --> 01:40:27,800
And I was like,
what?

2169
01:40:27,950 --> 01:40:28,491
And he goes,
well,

2170
01:40:28,491 --> 01:40:30,380
at least 500.
Oh my God.

2171
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:32,060
Oh my God.
But we didn't have google.

2172
01:40:32,061 --> 01:40:33,230
I couldn't say,
hey idiot,

2173
01:40:33,231 --> 01:40:34,820
google it.
I was just like,

2174
01:40:34,821 --> 01:40:36,570
are you crazy?
But I,

2175
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:39,620
I just walked away from him like I 
because I was like,

2176
01:40:39,621 --> 01:40:40,454
I'm either going to strangle him.
Like he just for me saying that it was 

2177
01:40:43,791 --> 01:40:47,150
less than 200 years ago.
At that point he didn't believe me.

2178
01:40:47,230 --> 01:40:49,280
But there's some things that people say 
like that,

2179
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:50,114
like that,
just that like wasn't that's what you 

2180
01:40:51,471 --> 01:40:53,290
want it to be two

2181
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:55,840
years ago.
That's what you want it to be.

2182
01:40:55,841 --> 01:40:56,674
I know what you're doing.
Like why do you think that that's the 

2183
01:40:58,181 --> 01:41:00,520
case?
Like people say Weird Shit.

2184
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:01,354
Like,
like I had a discussion with a guy long 

2185
01:41:02,981 --> 01:41:07,360
fucking time ago about the civil war and
he was talking about the economic impact

2186
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:09,190
it was,
they were going to cripple the farms.

2187
01:41:09,191 --> 01:41:12,700
Like is an economic more and they forced
him in a corner where they had.

2188
01:41:14,020 --> 01:41:17,440
It was about slavery.
It was just about,

2189
01:41:17,620 --> 01:41:18,453
yeah,
if you don't want to pay people and 

2190
01:41:20,261 --> 01:41:22,480
you're making them work,
that's economics.

2191
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:25,180
People are like that.
They like to get paid for work.

2192
01:41:25,181 --> 01:41:27,220
So yeah.
In that sense it was an economic issue,

2193
01:41:28,360 --> 01:41:30,820
but people repeat that because they can.
They could drink.

2194
01:41:30,840 --> 01:41:31,210
No.
Yeah.

2195
01:41:31,210 --> 01:41:32,043
Well,
at least fucking liberals try telling 

2196
01:41:33,101 --> 01:41:34,780
that to them.
They don't want to hear it.

2197
01:41:34,930 --> 01:41:36,490
They don't want to hear.
It was about echo.

2198
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,533
Listen,
these people who were slaves allow than 

2199
01:41:39,670 --> 01:41:41,620
were treated very well.
I don't have.

2200
01:41:41,621 --> 01:41:43,510
You know,
there's a lot of that roots,

2201
01:41:43,511 --> 01:41:45,010
that propaganda,
that movie,

2202
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:48,460
that l Ron Hubbard,
whoever wrote that shit,

2203
01:41:49,390 --> 01:41:53,250
that guy he wrote,
a lot of them were good friends with the

2204
01:41:53,260 --> 01:41:55,120
white folks.
Sometimes they interbred.

2205
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:57,213
They often interbred the master would 
pick himself a good woman and she would 

2206
01:42:01,091 --> 01:42:03,140
be treated better than the rest.
So you know,

2207
01:42:03,670 --> 01:42:05,590
how much different is that than working 
at Burger King?

2208
01:42:06,190 --> 01:42:07,023
I mean,
come on.

2209
01:42:08,310 --> 01:42:10,860
There's a lot of those dudes out there.
They were always out there.

2210
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:15,060
I didn't know we were going to bring my 
dad back up.

2211
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:18,400
People are fucking completely insane.
Yeah,

2212
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:19,463
it's true.
There is a lot of people that are just 

2213
01:42:20,490 --> 01:42:21,323
and they booked.
The thing is like when a guy says I was 

2214
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:24,720
about economics,
it's about economics.

2215
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:25,623
You don't want it to be that.
So they want there to be a bunch of 

2216
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:29,980
silly people.
They don't.

2217
01:42:30,210 --> 01:42:33,090
They don't want like slavery has been 
abolished in 18,

2218
01:42:33,091 --> 01:42:36,680
65 and people went to war over it.
Yeah.

2219
01:42:36,810 --> 01:42:39,870
That's so recent.
Fuck,

2220
01:42:39,871 --> 01:42:43,140
that's recent.
You know I was born in [inaudible] 67.

2221
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:44,610
Okay.
So it's two years,

2222
01:42:44,640 --> 01:42:48,600
200 years rather before I was born.
Think about that for 100 years.

2223
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:49,960
One hundred years before I was born.
Yeah.

2224
01:42:50,160 --> 01:42:51,700
Think about that.
No,

2225
01:42:51,850 --> 01:42:54,060
that's,
that's nothing.

2226
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:55,350
I mean you think.
Yeah.

2227
01:42:55,350 --> 01:42:58,170
My grandma was 93 when she died in 1965.

2228
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:00,000
Doesn't even sound right when you say 
it.

2229
01:43:00,150 --> 01:43:02,730
There was only 140 something years ago.
He like,

2230
01:43:02,731 --> 01:43:04,650
Nah,
it was more than that,

2231
01:43:04,680 --> 01:43:05,730
right?
It was more than that.

2232
01:43:05,731 --> 01:43:07,290
Right.
It's more than that,

2233
01:43:07,291 --> 01:43:08,610
right?
Oh my God.

2234
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:10,740
Crazy creeps.
We were,

2235
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:13,313
we had slaves just to fucking couple 
hundred years ago was I had family that 

2236
01:43:17,611 --> 01:43:20,370
lived to be $100,
so that's an easy number.

2237
01:43:20,510 --> 01:43:23,100
Jesus Christ.
That's cool.

2238
01:43:23,250 --> 01:43:26,130
That is so strange that that was so 
recent.

2239
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:28,980
And in places where it was like real 
prep.

2240
01:43:28,981 --> 01:43:30,290
Now stop and think of that,
right?

2241
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:33,810
Think of places where like slavery was 
real prevalent,

2242
01:43:33,860 --> 01:43:35,850
right?
People lived on the slavery,

2243
01:43:35,851 --> 01:43:36,870
they had it,
there was,

2244
01:43:36,871 --> 01:43:37,704
lynchings was all that kind of crazy 
shit and they'll think that all goes 

2245
01:43:40,231 --> 01:43:43,180
away just 150 years ago.
Yeah.

2246
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:46,320
And they got to recover.
So all racist,

2247
01:43:46,321 --> 01:43:51,321
grandpappy,
racist Paul Pol Pot Pie Pie.

2248
01:43:51,610 --> 01:43:52,000
They get

2249
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,690
to gail.
Tell you what we're gonna do.

2250
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:56,720
We're gonna put our foot down.
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

2251
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:57,913
We're in stop hold his interbreeding 
Chelsea handler did something on her 

2252
01:44:02,391 --> 01:44:04,790
show,
that first one on netflix where she went

2253
01:44:04,820 --> 01:44:07,340
and visited places like that where it's 
still.

2254
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:09,650
And it was so I was like,
oh.

2255
01:44:09,651 --> 01:44:10,484
And she's having conversations and 
they're doing what you're saying with 

2256
01:44:12,570 --> 01:44:14,540
economic.
And I'm like,

2257
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,070
what the.
And she's like,

2258
01:44:16,071 --> 01:44:18,160
wait a minute.
And like trying to schedule that,

2259
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:19,710
but it's just,
you're right,

2260
01:44:19,820 --> 01:44:22,120
like this blinders will,
they don't blame,

2261
01:44:22,190 --> 01:44:25,700
don't look into it and that's what they 
want to hear.

2262
01:44:26,080 --> 01:44:28,040
So it's,
it's what they talk about.

2263
01:44:28,140 --> 01:44:30,320
It's a fascinating thing when people do 
that,

2264
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:34,430
when people don't consider the 
possibility of another point of view.

2265
01:44:35,290 --> 01:44:37,130
Yeah,
you can't be that close minded.

2266
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:37,964
That's insane.
I mean if you look at how many people 

2267
01:44:40,490 --> 01:44:42,800
have benefited from slavery,
stopping,

2268
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:44,343
like the idea that anybody's out there 
somehow or another sample we'll need 

2269
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:49,343
about that.

2270
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:55,760
Keeping this corn business going.
Need someone to pick this here corner.

2271
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:56,594
I couldn't pick it on a cell phone 
because we're trying to keep a family 

2272
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:03,950
friend trying to support community.
Fuck,

2273
01:45:03,951 --> 01:45:04,784
that's crazy.
Living in those places like living in 

2274
01:45:06,891 --> 01:45:07,724
spots where it was like insanely racist 
for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds 

2275
01:45:11,031 --> 01:45:11,864
of years.
Right.

2276
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:17,020
And then to expect that to just shut off
and turn around within our lifetimes,

2277
01:45:17,990 --> 01:45:21,260
it's almost amazing that people aren't 
more racist.

2278
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,440
Well,
Philadelphia's pretty racist.

2279
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:26,990
Boston's pretty racist.
Only parts of Boston hearts,

2280
01:45:27,200 --> 01:45:30,530
Boston,
like the center Boston is very liberal,

2281
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:32,930
democratic,
very progressive.

2282
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:38,440
But there's a lot of townies that don't 
like the my parents growing up.

2283
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:42,950
You couldn't date a Italian Irish yet?
Well,

2284
01:45:42,951 --> 01:45:43,784
they don't like people would freak out.
They don't like people that are 

2285
01:45:45,501 --> 01:45:47,900
different than them.
They get mad and Italian.

2286
01:45:47,901 --> 01:45:48,734
Irish like that was a big one.
You and I were the dirtiest of the 

2287
01:45:52,060 --> 01:45:53,570
mutts.
I'm 100 percent Irish.

2288
01:45:53,571 --> 01:45:54,404
You think you are.
You've had so much dick in you from 

2289
01:45:56,061 --> 01:45:56,894
Italian guy.

2290
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:03,960
I'm representing every country.
I watched the Olympics and go,

2291
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:08,110
I've been there.
Yeah.

2292
01:46:08,140 --> 01:46:11,480
Philly is similar in a lot of ways.
Like Philly,

2293
01:46:11,481 --> 01:46:12,530
New York,
Boston,

2294
01:46:12,531 --> 01:46:13,364
New Jersey.
They all have like a different feel to 

2295
01:46:14,751 --> 01:46:15,584
them.
But what's similar is they're hardy 

2296
01:46:17,481 --> 01:46:22,190
people that are living in tough climates
and they're the children of the children

2297
01:46:22,191 --> 01:46:23,330
of immigrants.
For the most part.

2298
01:46:24,700 --> 01:46:29,700
Most of my neighbors growing up spoke 
Italian or I mean we came over.

2299
01:46:30,201 --> 01:46:33,470
I don't remember how far back.
I think my great,

2300
01:46:33,471 --> 01:46:36,690
great on my dad's side and then great,
great.

2301
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,440
Great.
On my mom's side came from Ireland.

2302
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:40,753
That's,
that's a lot of the people that I grew 

2303
01:46:42,231 --> 01:46:43,064
up with who was always like their dad's 
dad or someone will say it was my 

2304
01:46:46,221 --> 01:46:49,720
grandparents on both sides came from a 
my

2305
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,960
parents,
my mom side,

2306
01:46:51,990 --> 01:46:55,560
it was all Italian and my dad's side is 
half Irish and half Italian.

2307
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:57,120
One from Italy,
one from Ireland,

2308
01:46:57,121 --> 01:47:00,450
but there were all fresh off the boat.
Just bad Irish.

2309
01:47:00,460 --> 01:47:03,600
Just staring in each other.
A little monkey.

2310
01:47:05,550 --> 01:47:09,020
She wasn't even supposed to be on this 
continent.

2311
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:14,090
Baby girl,
me in prison.

2312
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:18,540
My person in your buddy.
My Mom's good at that one.

2313
01:47:18,710 --> 01:47:19,890
Ten,
10,

2314
01:47:19,891 --> 01:47:23,490
and my dad's dad was one of 15.
Good Lord.

2315
01:47:23,640 --> 01:47:28,640
There was a lot of us out there.
We do.

2316
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:32,270
They like to keep them to.
Yeah,

2317
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,950
we've got a lot of kids,
gang.

2318
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:37,680
Oh kids.
My Mom's sister had 10 kids to.

2319
01:47:37,770 --> 01:47:39,220
Oh my God.
Well,

2320
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:41,460
the picnics,
picnics,

2321
01:47:41,700 --> 01:47:42,850
not picnics.
They don't.

2322
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:47,010
They didn't like mob scenes like that.
Park rent a hall.

2323
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,330
Twenty six people would indoors.
How many families want?

2324
01:47:50,950 --> 01:47:53,370
My mom's mom had four kids.

2325
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:55,980
She was orphaned at a very early age.
She had four kids,

2326
01:47:55,981 --> 01:47:58,050
so she wants to have like a real tight 
knit family.

2327
01:47:58,500 --> 01:48:00,370
Four kids,
27 grandchildren,

2328
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:03,420
45 great grandchildren.
When she passed away 11 years ago,

2329
01:48:03,421 --> 01:48:07,300
I had a lot of periods in your only 
time.

2330
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:12,160
Tampax.
Super Fertile.

2331
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:15,200
You could probably get them from her 
other sisters.

2332
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:16,110
Yeah,
you can.

2333
01:48:16,111 --> 01:48:17,610
And I.
My mom had a hysterectomy.

2334
01:48:17,611 --> 01:48:20,200
She's still nervous.
She's like around.

2335
01:48:21,830 --> 01:48:22,663
That's so crazy.
Such a giant number of human beings to 

2336
01:48:25,561 --> 01:48:26,394
come out of a couple of folks.
How many other people are going to get 

2337
01:48:29,101 --> 01:48:30,540
bread out of that?
Yeah,

2338
01:48:30,541 --> 01:48:31,350
we're good.
We,

2339
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:32,183
we slowed,
we slow because we're 10 and then we 

2340
01:48:34,171 --> 01:48:36,090
only.
I only have 10 nieces and nephews,

2341
01:48:36,940 --> 01:48:41,940
but my little sister did just get 
married so my might add on the other.

2342
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:45,630
My aunt joy,
she had 10 kids and they have I think 15

2343
01:48:45,631 --> 01:48:48,990
or 17 nieces and nephews.
You know what I mean?

2344
01:48:48,991 --> 01:48:49,824
Like hide.
So they did the bigger we were half and 

2345
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:54,623
half,
half of us had kids and half of us 

2346
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:56,850
didn't.
Half of us were like,

2347
01:48:56,851 --> 01:48:58,520
you know what?
We're going to stop this bloodline.

2348
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:03,360
Maybe that's why you don't want kids.
She's been around too many people.

2349
01:49:03,900 --> 01:49:04,733
True.
Or it could be those bad decisions I 

2350
01:49:06,331 --> 01:49:07,500
made with dating.
No,

2351
01:49:07,530 --> 01:49:08,490
I'm just kidding.
Oh no,

2352
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,990
they're good.
I love kids.

2353
01:49:09,991 --> 01:49:10,824
I do,
but I,

2354
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,090
I just,
I don't know.

2355
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:15,660
We don't have my own.
If I for my own,

2356
01:49:15,661 --> 01:49:16,494
I don't want for me,
like when I go home I'm with my nieces 

2357
01:49:18,271 --> 01:49:20,910
and nephews all the time,
hang out with them all the time.

2358
01:49:20,911 --> 01:49:24,660
I even had my niece Alexa came out here 
to live for a little while because she's

2359
01:49:24,661 --> 01:49:29,661
into producing and editing,
like that's just graduated college.

2360
01:49:29,881 --> 01:49:34,000
So like I'm very close with my kids.
I call them my kids and uh,

2361
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:35,160
but I just,
for myself,

2362
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:39,000
I didn't want to make total sense.
And also the,

2363
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:42,090
just the sheer numbers of people that 
you've been around for so long,

2364
01:49:42,091 --> 01:49:44,880
you're like enough fucking people making
more people.

2365
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:46,910
Jesus Christ.
I mean,

2366
01:49:46,970 --> 01:49:49,540
I wonder how much of that pull to family
is that,

2367
01:49:49,541 --> 01:49:50,374
you know,
to create some bond with people that 

2368
01:49:52,031 --> 01:49:53,950
you're like deeply,
deeply close to.

2369
01:49:53,951 --> 01:49:54,784
And I wonder if you grow up with so many
people like you have that bond gets 

2370
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,433
drowned out.
But the way we grew up on top of each 

2371
01:50:00,281 --> 01:50:02,380
other by tight,
we are tight.

2372
01:50:03,260 --> 01:50:05,250
Let's not get crazy.
But we are tight.

2373
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:06,153
Oh,
I could imagine 10 kids growing up in a 

2374
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:09,370
pilot that I bet if one of you gets in 
trouble,

2375
01:50:09,860 --> 01:50:10,693
fucking hailstorm.
We had nobody wanted to fight one 

2376
01:50:13,241 --> 01:50:14,074
because she had a fight.
And I have six brothers so it's like I 

2377
01:50:15,970 --> 01:50:16,803
shared a room with them.
I stayed in the most important thing 

2378
01:50:18,371 --> 01:50:19,204
growing up.
What?

2379
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:21,210
People you.
Yeah,

2380
01:50:21,300 --> 01:50:23,950
like if shit goes down,
like if it was raining out,

2381
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,780
people would knock on our door.
Like let's go in there.

2382
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:28,700
It's like a playground.
Hilarious.

2383
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:31,210
There's always something to do in the 
Kerrigan House,

2384
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:32,890
you know,
like it was just in the St.

2385
01:50:33,340 --> 01:50:35,800
just never going to happen.
And yet you're right,

2386
01:50:35,801 --> 01:50:36,634
you're right.
Yeah.

2387
01:50:36,670 --> 01:50:37,503
Now you know,
now that people have two kids and they 

2388
01:50:39,341 --> 01:50:40,174
tag out and that's fine.
That's just that kids aren't running 

2389
01:50:42,101 --> 01:50:42,934
around the street.

2390
01:50:45,130 --> 01:50:45,963
That was my favorite.
Like we really were outside and that's 

2391
01:50:48,551 --> 01:50:49,384
when I kind of what this pokemon thing,
I'm excited that people are outside and 

2392
01:50:52,420 --> 01:50:53,253
I was home a couple of weeks ago.
I will watch these kids fight and play 

2393
01:50:56,171 --> 01:50:59,880
in the playground and it was just like.
I still think certain areas do it.

2394
01:51:00,510 --> 01:51:01,750
It doesn't exist.
Well,

2395
01:51:01,751 --> 01:51:02,880
I think that when.
No,

2396
01:51:03,130 --> 01:51:03,963
definitely not walking.
I mean people in New York walk way more 

2397
01:51:06,221 --> 01:51:07,054
than the ones out here,
like already loves doing sets than 

2398
01:51:09,130 --> 01:51:09,963
walking home to his apartment.
It's my favorite thing to do in New 

2399
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,730
York.
Do you really?

2400
01:51:12,730 --> 01:51:13,563
My favorite thing and I've walked from 
all the way the upper west side all the 

2401
01:51:16,631 --> 01:51:21,250
way down versus go to the gym and then 
have like a normal person did do that.

2402
01:51:21,251 --> 01:51:22,084
I did go to the gym that day.
We go to crunch gym and we kill it and 

2403
01:51:26,891 --> 01:51:28,360
then that night I walk home.

2404
01:51:28,540 --> 01:51:29,373
I do enjoy like hiking.
I do enjoy like walking up hills in 

2405
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:35,530
nature and shit like that.
I enjoyed walking around the streets.

2406
01:51:35,531 --> 01:51:37,420
I'm like,
this fucking airs,

2407
01:51:37,450 --> 01:51:40,910
tainted,
breathing in brake dust,

2408
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:45,700
texts and drives right into you.
Fuck,

2409
01:51:45,701 --> 01:51:49,780
that was alert as if you're driving,
walking.

2410
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,940
She and a couple of people running 
lights lately.

2411
01:51:52,060 --> 01:51:53,890
It's Buki.
It's very strange.

2412
01:51:53,950 --> 01:51:56,500
I stopped me.
We saw a girl get hit by a car.

2413
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:00,310
I don't even know how it happened.
It was like we were in the car.

2414
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:03,130
Guy was making a left girls crossing the
street.

2415
01:52:03,190 --> 01:52:05,320
This guy obviously in the wrong making 
the left.

2416
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:08,200
She was on her phone,
but she,

2417
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:11,320
before she crossed,
he made the left.

2418
01:52:11,321 --> 01:52:13,960
He must have been on his phone and he 
did not hard,

2419
01:52:13,961 --> 01:52:14,794
but they're like,
he realized and it was just like she 

2420
01:52:15,881 --> 01:52:18,070
went down like a sack of potatoes and me
and my niece were like,

2421
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:18,970
oh my God.

2422
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:21,310
Oh my God.
Like we just got out the help because we

2423
01:52:21,311 --> 01:52:23,770
didn't know what.
How do you not see that?

2424
01:52:23,771 --> 01:52:27,010
How did he not see her?
How did people sometimes are not fucking

2425
01:52:27,011 --> 01:52:28,510
paying attention,
doesn't make any sense.

2426
01:52:28,511 --> 01:52:32,200
Just drifting off and people just so 
tired.

2427
01:52:32,820 --> 01:52:34,750
They're like barely paying attention to 
what they're doing.

2428
01:52:34,751 --> 01:52:36,670
They're just working all day and they're
so tired.

2429
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:41,740
I walk home from the store a lot,
maniac.

2430
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:46,820
I try to because the parking that dry,
if I just have a spot at the store,

2431
01:52:47,060 --> 01:52:47,893
sometimes I'll just.
Or if I do the store in the factory 

2432
01:52:49,431 --> 01:52:50,810
because then you can walk down the 
street.

2433
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:53,060
So I mean,
and a lot of times I'll,

2434
01:52:53,120 --> 01:52:55,220
if I have both,
I will park at the store,

2435
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:57,320
walk to the factory and then walk back.
Well,

2436
01:52:57,321 --> 01:52:59,730
sunset is if there's going to be a spot,
there's like,

2437
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:00,350
what else?

2438
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:02,640
Melrose and sunset in Santa Monica 
Boulevard.

2439
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:06,060
People walked down there and then people
walk on the promenade,

2440
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:09,170
that little Santa Monica and they walked
down there.

2441
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:12,320
Venice people walk around Venice.
But when you walk in Hollywood,

2442
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:13,970
people look at you like,
Oh God,

2443
01:53:14,090 --> 01:53:16,550
what's wrong with her?
Like walking around with some hookers.

2444
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:20,100
I have a car and I am a hooker.
I have to make extra money in there.

2445
01:53:20,110 --> 01:53:22,940
It is weird when you're walking around 
or driving around in Hollywood,

2446
01:53:22,941 --> 01:53:24,520
you don't see a lot of people walking.
No.

2447
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:25,473
Only on certain areas,
like you said at the Hollywood 

2448
01:53:27,021 --> 01:53:28,500
boulevard,
if they're going to sightsee,

2449
01:53:28,660 --> 01:53:30,920
whatever.
Wonder how much that's shaped.

2450
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:32,420
Like how,
uh,

2451
01:53:32,680 --> 01:53:34,550
what,
what the personality of people that live

2452
01:53:34,551 --> 01:53:38,510
in La is the fact that people were in 
cars early on because the transportation

2453
01:53:38,511 --> 01:53:40,340
system sucks.
It's terrible.

2454
01:53:40,370 --> 01:53:42,650
But like I didn't have a license when I 
first moved here.

2455
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:44,990
I had no,
I had no,

2456
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:45,853
I mean I tried to learn how to drive and
I tried to get my sister Karen to take 

2457
01:53:48,381 --> 01:53:49,214
me to get a license,
but she missed the exit and she got 

2458
01:53:50,451 --> 01:53:54,110
angry so she literally was like,
God kill us all.

2459
01:53:54,200 --> 01:53:57,200
And I was like,
oh my God,

2460
01:53:57,201 --> 01:53:58,580
anger issues.
Seriously,

2461
01:53:58,581 --> 01:54:01,220
I hate you.
So forgive her.

2462
01:54:01,880 --> 01:54:02,790
I love my sister.
Yeah,

2463
01:54:02,820 --> 01:54:03,653
bring it up to her every now and then.
I was onstage and I told that story and 

2464
01:54:06,951 --> 01:54:07,784
she was here with her daughter visiting 
for Mother's Day and I started to tell 

2465
01:54:10,821 --> 01:54:12,320
the story and I heard her go,
oh,

2466
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:16,640
this story.
No,

2467
01:54:16,860 --> 01:54:19,010
we're tired.
Like she was my.

2468
01:54:19,040 --> 01:54:20,840
She taught me how to swim.
She taught me everything.

2469
01:54:20,841 --> 01:54:21,674
I said,
Karen,

2470
01:54:21,780 --> 01:54:23,900
she's 10 years older and we look exactly
alike.

2471
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:25,940
Wow.
It's like the weirdest thing.

2472
01:54:25,941 --> 01:54:27,380
And her daughter,
when she came out here,

2473
01:54:27,381 --> 01:54:28,131
everybody was like,
Oh,

2474
01:54:28,131 --> 01:54:28,790
is that your daughter?

2475
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:29,241
I'm like,
no.

2476
01:54:29,241 --> 01:54:30,830
And they're like,
don't lie to us.

2477
01:54:30,831 --> 01:54:32,930
You abandoned your kid to come to la.
I was like,

2478
01:54:33,260 --> 01:54:35,630
yeah,
I'd abandoned a kid to do this.

2479
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:36,141
Right?
Like,

2480
01:54:36,141 --> 01:54:38,030
who would do that?
I would never known to do that.

2481
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:40,070
And he's like.
And Dave Taylor was like,

2482
01:54:40,100 --> 01:54:41,840
you guys have the same overbite?
I'm like,

2483
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:43,220
what do you worked for?
CSI?

2484
01:54:43,221 --> 01:54:45,670
What does that even mean to Taylor 
swift?

2485
01:54:46,640 --> 01:54:48,530
She's my niece that's.
He's like,

2486
01:54:48,531 --> 01:54:52,670
no,
you gave her up being crazy.

2487
01:54:53,120 --> 01:54:54,730
He wasn't the only one.
There was a co,

2488
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:56,420
he's the only one that said the 
overbite.

2489
01:54:56,421 --> 01:54:57,770
That's all.
But anyway.

2490
01:54:57,771 --> 01:54:59,120
So yeah,
she uh,

2491
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:02,720
she's my sister's side,
but I didn't have a license until two,

2492
01:55:02,750 --> 01:55:07,750
three years after being here.
So walking was awful.

2493
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:13,160
Awful because you wait for the bus and 
they just have their own schedule.

2494
01:55:13,590 --> 01:55:14,423
They got the juice to the east coast 
where you can take a bus to Boston and 

2495
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:19,370
come back,
like of fucking characters.

2496
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:22,340
Were you running into on the public 
transportation system in la?

2497
01:55:22,460 --> 01:55:23,293
So many.
One time I remember I got in trouble 

2498
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:27,020
because I was waiting tables at the 
store and the manager was like,

2499
01:55:27,021 --> 01:55:29,060
if you're late one more time because I'm
always like,

2500
01:55:29,090 --> 01:55:30,110
it's my thing,
whatever.

2501
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:32,990
My grand mom used to yell at us for it.
I don't know what happens.

2502
01:55:32,991 --> 01:55:35,720
But anyway,
so my grandma,

2503
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:38,480
my grandma actually called me you 
people.

2504
01:55:38,540 --> 01:55:39,373
I'm like,
really?

2505
01:55:39,750 --> 01:55:43,040
People that's so racist.
But anyway,

2506
01:55:43,050 --> 01:55:45,420
so she was like,
if you're late one more time.

2507
01:55:45,421 --> 01:55:49,230
So I specifically came I think an hour 
early I could have just walked,

2508
01:55:49,231 --> 01:55:50,064
but I was waiting for the bus and uh,
I waiting for the bus and I was talking 

2509
01:55:53,581 --> 01:55:55,260
to this black guy.
He was funny.

2510
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:57,150
He was like,
damn a girl like you,

2511
01:55:57,540 --> 01:55:59,940
you should be in a cadillac.
And I was like,

2512
01:55:59,941 --> 01:56:00,930
you got one,
like,

2513
01:56:00,931 --> 01:56:01,920
you know,
I'm like playing with,

2514
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:03,540
you know,
like talk to people.

2515
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,820
And he did he have like a,
you know,

2516
01:56:04,910 --> 01:56:07,590
a nice little curl going.
So I know what he did.

2517
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:10,590
I tell what he did,
but it's not my business.

2518
01:56:10,591 --> 01:56:11,424
So I was just talking to them because I 
was trying to get you to go to work for 

2519
01:56:13,201 --> 01:56:14,034
him.
No,

2520
01:56:14,130 --> 01:56:16,410
he was literally just talking.
Then the bus came.

2521
01:56:16,411 --> 01:56:19,740
As I went to get on the bus,
they pulled me off the bus.

2522
01:56:19,741 --> 01:56:20,574
Two undercover cops.
They had him on the ground with guns in 

2523
01:56:22,501 --> 01:56:23,490
his face.
I'm like,

2524
01:56:23,850 --> 01:56:25,820
what's the.
And they grabbed my bags.

2525
01:56:25,821 --> 01:56:27,510
She started going through my bag.
I was like,

2526
01:56:27,511 --> 01:56:29,020
you can't go through my bag,
you.

2527
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:30,300
I started panicking.
I was like,

2528
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:32,820
you can't go through my bag,
you know me?

2529
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:33,654
And they're like,
why were you talking to him as he tried 

2530
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:37,260
you work for him?
I'm looking at,

2531
01:56:37,261 --> 01:56:41,090
I have a giant overage size gray sweater
on black tights,

2532
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:42,210
a comedy store t shirt.

2533
01:56:42,210 --> 01:56:43,830
I'm like,
what do I know?

2534
01:56:43,831 --> 01:56:47,550
I'm not working for him.
See that girl with her pussy hanging out

2535
01:56:47,551 --> 01:56:49,110
of her skirt.
She's working for him,

2536
01:56:49,111 --> 01:56:49,944
not me.
Like they were on the other side of the 

2537
01:56:51,031 --> 01:56:52,260
street and he's like,
get down.

2538
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:55,290
So they're screaming at me and are going
through my bag and I'm like,

2539
01:56:55,291 --> 01:56:56,124
you really can't go through my bag.
I'm panicked and then things just 

2540
01:56:59,701 --> 01:57:01,410
started screaming,
asking questions,

2541
01:57:01,411 --> 01:57:04,410
did you or is he trying to recruit you?
Do you work for him?

2542
01:57:04,590 --> 01:57:06,540
And he's literally on the ground guns 
drawn.

2543
01:57:06,541 --> 01:57:07,374
He did nothing to me.
All he did was say I should be in a 

2544
01:57:09,481 --> 01:57:10,920
cadillac.
That was it.

2545
01:57:11,130 --> 01:57:12,030
And so I was like,
dude,

2546
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:14,190
you gotta calm down,
and I was like,

2547
01:57:14,220 --> 01:57:15,053
I'm going to be late for work and I'm 
going to get fired in this God's good 

2548
01:57:17,491 --> 01:57:18,324
guns in his face and I'm worried about 
my weight and tables at the comedy 

2549
01:57:20,971 --> 01:57:21,390
store.

2550
01:57:21,390 --> 01:57:22,223
So then finally they let him go and I 
was so pissed and I'm getting my stuff 

2551
01:57:25,850 --> 01:57:28,410
and put my bag together and I'm like,
this is bullshit.

2552
01:57:28,680 --> 01:57:31,170
But I was afraid to talk back to a cop.
So I was like,

2553
01:57:31,230 --> 01:57:33,060
oh,
it was like inside me.

2554
01:57:33,300 --> 01:57:35,340
And then they were like,
you want us to drive you to work?

2555
01:57:35,341 --> 01:57:36,660
And I'm like,
Oh yeah,

2556
01:57:36,661 --> 01:57:38,220
that's great.
You're going to drive me to work.

2557
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:39,330
And if so,
when we pull up,

2558
01:57:39,331 --> 01:57:42,750
I'll tell Mitzi shore I got picked up 
for prostitution and that's why I had to

2559
01:57:42,751 --> 01:57:47,751
get here late in about 15 minutes.
But Debbie,

2560
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:50,873
no,
I took,

2561
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:54,840
I did take the ride,
but Mitzi wasn't there that night.

2562
01:57:54,841 --> 01:57:55,830
Thank God.
But Debbie,

2563
01:57:55,831 --> 01:57:59,050
the manager did see me get out of a cop 
car and she's like the,

2564
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:00,323
she's undercover waitress.
That's why she doesn't get fired even 

2565
01:58:03,271 --> 01:58:04,104
though she's late.

2566
01:58:04,200 --> 01:58:05,033
She's still crazy.
Mitzi let me be the boss because I was 

2567
01:58:08,701 --> 01:58:09,540
always late.
She's like,

2568
01:58:09,541 --> 01:58:10,374
okay,
fine.

2569
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:11,273
But you know,
that's a crazy story because it shows 

2570
01:58:13,720 --> 01:58:14,553
people what it's like to be poor and be 
dealt with by the cops when they know 

2571
01:58:17,821 --> 01:58:19,080
that you don't,
you can't do anything.

2572
01:58:19,240 --> 01:58:20,770
Couldn't do anything.
I was like,

2573
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:22,980
it'd be honest,
I like,

2574
01:58:23,090 --> 01:58:26,010
I just don't.
I panicked when they go through your bag

2575
01:58:26,011 --> 01:58:26,844
or something like that.
Everything goes through your head and 

2576
01:58:28,351 --> 01:58:29,970
you're like,
what am I packing tonight?

2577
01:58:29,971 --> 01:58:31,500
Am I this right?
Like what am I doing?

2578
01:58:31,501 --> 01:58:33,270
You know,
like scared and,

2579
01:58:33,290 --> 01:58:35,820
and,
but you have no rights most of the time.

2580
01:58:35,821 --> 01:58:36,654
It's crazy.
It's crazy that you don't have any 

2581
01:58:37,531 --> 01:58:39,730
rights.
I don't think that's legal know,

2582
01:58:39,810 --> 01:58:41,980
but if you resist and you fight back,
you're going to

2583
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:42,910
get hit.
I've been,

2584
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,890
I've been thrown in the back of a paddy 
wagon.

2585
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:47,530
I've tried both ways.
It can't.

2586
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:51,760
I've seen guys get beaten good friends 
like,

2587
01:58:52,170 --> 01:58:53,003
like and just in a nightclub just from 
resisting and it was a stupid thing we 

2588
01:58:56,051 --> 01:58:59,450
were doing and you know,
I seen it.

2589
01:58:59,530 --> 01:59:00,980
I've seen both ends.
Yeah.

2590
01:59:01,810 --> 01:59:04,270
Jobs are stressed the fuck out.
That's what I'm saying.

2591
01:59:04,840 --> 01:59:08,050
In a bad situation like that,
like in your situation like that was,

2592
01:59:08,650 --> 01:59:11,200
it was crazy ridiculous.
All you're doing is talking to a guy and

2593
01:59:11,210 --> 01:59:13,480
then you're getting on a bus.
In fact they grabbed you like that,

2594
01:59:13,481 --> 01:59:14,314
but how many white girls talked to that 
guy that aren't working for them and 

2595
01:59:18,611 --> 01:59:21,330
their defense.
So for sure this bitch knows it.

2596
01:59:21,590 --> 01:59:24,340
Look how comfortable she is with them.
She's not even freaking out.

2597
01:59:24,341 --> 01:59:26,800
She's got to be a hooker.
She's like,

2598
01:59:26,801 --> 01:59:28,010
she's joking around with him.

2599
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:29,530
You got a cadillac,
you got one.

2600
01:59:29,740 --> 01:59:32,710
Like they're negotiating terms of their 
contract.

2601
01:59:32,740 --> 01:59:33,573
He was funny,
but they figured if you talking to a 

2602
01:59:36,581 --> 01:59:39,250
pimp and you're not freaking out,
for sure,

2603
01:59:39,251 --> 01:59:40,210
there's got to be something wrong with 
you.

2604
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:43,300
I'm not saying he might not get another 
girl who's like,

2605
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:45,490
oh,
this girl can be molded.

2606
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:47,650
Her mind can be molded,
you know,

2607
01:59:47,670 --> 01:59:50,740
I'm not going to turn tricks that 
overbite.

2608
01:59:51,950 --> 01:59:55,270
All of a sudden I feel like my overbite 
has gotten bigger.

2609
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:56,133
You know?
It's weird.

2610
01:59:56,350 --> 01:59:57,183
The Guy can't take ag,
couldn't recruit girls and have them do 

2611
02:00:00,581 --> 02:00:01,414
sex for money for him and protect them.
That's what a pimp does to prostitutes 

2612
02:00:04,361 --> 02:00:05,680
and prostitutes and illegal.
Right.

2613
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:10,950
But you could recruit girls to make 
videos of them having sex.

2614
02:00:13,960 --> 02:00:18,220
Like you can have people that can even 
pay you immediate money though.

2615
02:00:18,221 --> 02:00:20,850
Is it?
Prostitution is like white and taste.

2616
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:23,410
I can totally be immediate money.
If you make people pay,

2617
02:00:24,860 --> 02:00:28,100
make people pay to have sex with 
somebody.

2618
02:00:28,330 --> 02:00:29,163
Somebody make a video of it saying,
but it's just what my point is like 

2619
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:34,343
pimps right now,
but the certain pimping that's like the 

2620
02:00:36,881 --> 02:00:37,714
word pimping is very strange.
Like you decide that women are too 

2621
02:00:41,171 --> 02:00:42,004
vulnerable to except a mentor figure and
the strong sexually overcharged black 

2622
02:00:48,011 --> 02:00:50,140
man with the feathers and the gold 
chains.

2623
02:00:50,590 --> 02:00:52,560
Like that's,
that's essentially with this.

2624
02:00:52,990 --> 02:00:53,823
Right.
But if he owns like a brothel in like 

2625
02:00:58,270 --> 02:01:00,640
Nevada or something like that,
like that's okay.

2626
02:01:01,410 --> 02:01:04,780
Pay Taxes.
There's a less dangerous for the girl.

2627
02:01:04,830 --> 02:01:06,500
Oh yeah.
So it was poor.

2628
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,473
She could get done.
I'm not saying there's anything wrong 

2629
02:01:09,761 --> 02:01:10,780
with any of it,
but I'm like,

2630
02:01:11,440 --> 02:01:14,350
it is.
Prostitution is a fucking weird one.

2631
02:01:14,530 --> 02:01:15,363
It is a real.
Pimping isn't even weirder one because 

2632
02:01:17,051 --> 02:01:19,990
that guy's not fucking anybody.
That's where it's even weird.

2633
02:01:20,110 --> 02:01:22,510
He just got a bunch of friends with 
money that likes to give him money.

2634
02:01:22,840 --> 02:01:25,360
He talks to these girls who do stuff 
that's illegal.

2635
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:29,410
He does stuff with the girls.
Okay.

2636
02:01:29,411 --> 02:01:31,300
But he's not doing anything to get that 
money.

2637
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:32,830
Right.
If you're a real pimp,

2638
02:01:33,190 --> 02:01:34,570
I don't think you're doing anything 
wrong.

2639
02:01:34,840 --> 02:01:37,330
You're sitting back,
sitting back,

2640
02:01:37,331 --> 02:01:40,070
you're Maxon.
And at firs on

2641
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:41,810
Vincent,
you know you've got long nails.

2642
02:01:41,811 --> 02:01:43,310
Just show everybody that you can't do 
work.

2643
02:01:43,940 --> 02:01:46,880
Maybe they have a whole lot of those 
dudes like pimps up hoes down.

2644
02:01:46,881 --> 02:01:48,560
They had many long nails.
Nails.

2645
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:49,603
Yeah,
they had,

2646
02:01:49,840 --> 02:01:50,673
but there was other.
The other nails were substantially 

2647
02:01:51,801 --> 02:01:53,750
longer than the average person works 
nine to five job,

2648
02:01:54,730 --> 02:01:57,610
so they have this whole thing going on.
What do they do?

2649
02:01:57,611 --> 02:01:58,444
An illegal.
All they're doing illegal as being a 

2650
02:01:59,691 --> 02:02:00,920
pimp.
C,

2651
02:02:00,921 --> 02:02:01,754
the actual act,
the illegal act is being done by the 

2652
02:02:03,831 --> 02:02:07,610
woman.
The woman is the woman is a prostitute.

2653
02:02:07,820 --> 02:02:08,653
She is deciding as a grown adult to go 
out and have illegal sex with men and 

2654
02:02:12,951 --> 02:02:13,784
then comes back and brings the money to 
the pimp and the pimp did really do 

2655
02:02:17,181 --> 02:02:18,014
anything.
He just got the girl to give him his 

2656
02:02:18,861 --> 02:02:21,140
money.
A lot of times these girls are under age

2657
02:02:21,141 --> 02:02:21,770
two.

2658
02:02:21,770 --> 02:02:22,680
Well,
that's the problem.

2659
02:02:22,840 --> 02:02:24,490
Well,
that's a very different story.

2660
02:02:24,500 --> 02:02:29,270
Only flattering thing about the story is
that the guy thought I was under fishes.

2661
02:02:29,271 --> 02:02:31,580
Oh,
look at it until it gets manicures.

2662
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:34,700
He's fresh look or they're not that big.
He's fresh.

2663
02:02:34,720 --> 02:02:37,820
That's a pretty long stretch.
I love Snoop Dogg.

2664
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:39,920
He can do.
He can do no wrong.

2665
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:43,160
What he did the other day,
it's amazing the way he led the.

2666
02:02:43,710 --> 02:02:44,543
It wasn't a protest,
it was like we're going to go talk to 

2667
02:02:46,371 --> 02:02:49,490
our officials and figure it out,
how we can make peace,

2668
02:02:49,760 --> 02:02:50,593
how we can do this.
And that was good because having the 

2669
02:02:52,191 --> 02:02:53,930
game did it and a lot of people 
followed.

2670
02:02:54,060 --> 02:02:55,040
Yeah.
Snoop Dogg's.

2671
02:02:55,041 --> 02:02:56,720
Very peaceful dude.
Very peaceful.

2672
02:02:56,780 --> 02:03:00,080
Very smart man.
That nailed thing is weird though.

2673
02:03:00,081 --> 02:03:03,080
And then yeah.
Even my now I don't even get manicures.

2674
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:05,180
Sometimes pimps up,
hoes down.

2675
02:03:05,480 --> 02:03:07,580
Pimps up.
Hoes down with a really great.

2676
02:03:07,600 --> 02:03:10,370
Yeah.
I used to watch it on repeat with Freddy

2677
02:03:10,370 --> 02:03:12,330
Soto because we were obsessed with 
fillmore slim.

2678
02:03:13,180 --> 02:03:14,310
Yeah.
Yeah.

2679
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:17,090
He was slick.
That's what the guy looked like that was

2680
02:03:17,091 --> 02:03:19,610
sitting on the bench and I always 
wondered was it him?

2681
02:03:21,290 --> 02:03:23,740
I don't know.
What year was it was in 1993.

2682
02:03:24,100 --> 02:03:24,933
[inaudible] 93.
It was way before that movie with your 

2683
02:03:27,410 --> 02:03:28,151
ice tea.
Remember?

2684
02:03:28,151 --> 02:03:28,984
I was in it.
He was in it and it went on this long 

2685
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:32,113
route.
Rant about how he is just a pimp and 

2686
02:03:34,971 --> 02:03:37,730
he's not really a rapper.
I never really been a rapper.

2687
02:03:38,100 --> 02:03:41,600
I'm bitter about wrapping big law.
What was her name?

2688
02:03:41,610 --> 02:03:45,830
Be Big.
How about Mr White folks are areas right

2689
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:49,800
there.
This Guy Mr. White folks.

2690
02:03:50,220 --> 02:03:53,450
White folks.
Oh my God.

2691
02:03:53,451 --> 02:03:55,660
He was hilarious.
Reckless eyeballing.

2692
02:03:57,290 --> 02:03:59,540
It's crazy.
This show,

2693
02:03:59,570 --> 02:04:00,403
this documentary was one of my favorites
and then the other guy we liked film 

2694
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:04,640
fillmore slim.

2695
02:04:04,830 --> 02:04:09,110
I just loved how he would come to la.
He got his.

2696
02:04:09,111 --> 02:04:10,900
All his girls got arrested.
He was like,

2697
02:04:10,910 --> 02:04:15,560
you thought that was my first track.
I got another track quit and he was on a

2698
02:04:15,561 --> 02:04:17,900
payphone.
He brought into the team.

2699
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:21,320
They took out the beach here and then he
sent the 18 down second.

2700
02:04:22,040 --> 02:04:22,873
So y'all not the long hose.
Dr Ron Hoes like they were playing busy 

2701
02:04:26,840 --> 02:04:28,280
booking nam.
Watch this.

2702
02:04:28,281 --> 02:04:29,330
I was like,
yes,

2703
02:04:29,331 --> 02:04:31,370
I love this guy.
They played games.

2704
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:34,520
We were obsessed with that show that a 
documentary.

2705
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:35,683
Obviously there's sadness to it,
like no one wants a girl to be a 

2706
02:04:37,801 --> 02:04:38,370
prostitute.

2707
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:43,370
So much sadness to the girl gets zero 
percentage.

2708
02:04:43,501 --> 02:04:45,450
That's what I remember learning that and
I was like,

2709
02:04:45,451 --> 02:04:46,980
what?
Let me ask you this,

2710
02:04:47,010 --> 02:04:47,843
honestly and truthfully isn't,
it isn't a lot of what's wrong with 

2711
02:04:51,361 --> 02:04:52,680
prostitution?
Two things.

2712
02:04:52,681 --> 02:04:56,430
One,
our idea about it like are forbidden,

2713
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:59,850
taught like it's forbidden.
It's taboo.

2714
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:00,773
You're not supposed to get money for sex
and to the fact that it's illegal 

2715
02:05:04,740 --> 02:05:07,260
because if it was legal,
Oh God,

2716
02:05:07,470 --> 02:05:09,990
the same.
Probably the same amount of people would

2717
02:05:09,991 --> 02:05:12,850
be doing it no more,
no more.

2718
02:05:13,730 --> 02:05:18,180
I think it would be more the same amount
of people would be doing prostitution or

2719
02:05:18,270 --> 02:05:20,970
going to prostitutes.
I'm saying doing prostitution,

2720
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:24,160
doing it just would be busier,
busier,

2721
02:05:24,280 --> 02:05:25,113
busier,
but at the same be the same people that 

2722
02:05:28,491 --> 02:05:29,324
wrong.
But you know what I mean?

2723
02:05:29,340 --> 02:05:31,050
Heidi,
feeling it probably would be more people

2724
02:05:31,051 --> 02:05:32,910
because I know a lot of girls that will 
do it.

2725
02:05:32,910 --> 02:05:34,370
If it was illegal,
you know,

2726
02:05:35,230 --> 02:05:36,063
I can calm them,
would be working with Kim is what I'm 

2727
02:05:44,950 --> 02:05:46,980
saying.
See if it was legal.

2728
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:50,400
I think it would be.
If it was accepted in legal,

2729
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:52,590
I think it would definitely more people 
would do it.

2730
02:05:52,620 --> 02:05:54,270
You know,
I think if I was a girl,

2731
02:05:54,500 --> 02:05:55,333
um,
I would definitely fuck guys that I was 

2732
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:01,260
attracted to for money track guy and he,
you know,

2733
02:06:01,280 --> 02:06:02,041
and he was like,
look,

2734
02:06:02,041 --> 02:06:02,874
I don't want a relationship,
but I'll give you two grand if you 

2735
02:06:06,210 --> 02:06:11,210
fucking sick.
Even in a relationship.

2736
02:06:11,941 --> 02:06:15,330
One time I remember like getting in an 
argument with my boyfriend because after

2737
02:06:15,331 --> 02:06:20,160
we had sex he gave me money and I was 
inappropriate and he was like,

2738
02:06:20,161 --> 02:06:22,970
what?
But it was for something and like he was

2739
02:06:22,971 --> 02:06:23,311
like,
oh,

2740
02:06:23,311 --> 02:06:25,740
you're going to go get this today.
I forget what it was.

2741
02:06:26,070 --> 02:06:28,080
I don't know if it was something for me,
I forget what it was,

2742
02:06:28,081 --> 02:06:31,230
but it was money yet.
And I was like prostitute.

2743
02:06:31,231 --> 02:06:32,850
Like when he left I was like,
oh,

2744
02:06:32,851 --> 02:06:36,440
that didn't feel that bad.
Should do this more often.

2745
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,210
If you really liked guys kidding me,
we were in a relationship,

2746
02:06:39,211 --> 02:06:41,010
but it was just a weird moment.
Like I was like,

2747
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,920
oh right.
But I'm saying if you love the guy,

2748
02:06:44,130 --> 02:06:46,350
like you get to things,
you like Dick and then money.

2749
02:06:47,060 --> 02:06:48,600
Yeah.
That order.

2750
02:06:48,660 --> 02:06:53,660
Usually people get paid for jobs that 
they love or people can pay for the jobs

2751
02:06:54,301 --> 02:06:55,280
that they hate.
Yeah.

2752
02:06:55,320 --> 02:06:56,730
How about getting paperwork done?
They love.

2753
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:58,680
Yeah.
Like movie stars get paid.

2754
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:00,840
They get paid for being moved and they 
enjoy it.

2755
02:07:00,841 --> 02:07:01,674
They love it.
They're out there acting explosions 

2756
02:07:02,911 --> 02:07:04,950
going on.
Get more with your pace it out.

2757
02:07:05,030 --> 02:07:06,060
Yeah,
let's do it.

2758
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:09,240
I'm sorry.
That's where I brought it.

2759
02:07:09,330 --> 02:07:10,163
Come on.
Let's say that we're going to rally to 

2760
02:07:13,681 --> 02:07:16,170
make this legal so that Kim and I have 
something to do.

2761
02:07:17,730 --> 02:07:18,563
It's eventually going to be legal.
You know what's interesting and might 

2762
02:07:20,281 --> 02:07:22,860
turn to be like a virtual thing before 
it becomes legal.

2763
02:07:22,861 --> 02:07:23,694
If what I'm been thinking about what you
were saying about the poor and the 

2764
02:07:26,551 --> 02:07:29,490
virtual poem with the headsets on being 
so interactive and immersive.

2765
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,421
I'm like,
yeah,

2766
02:07:30,421 --> 02:07:31,254
of course.
That's just what's going to happen and 

2767
02:07:32,341 --> 02:07:33,750
they're just going to figure out a way 
to make it.

2768
02:07:34,280 --> 02:07:36,040
They're going to figure out a way to 
stimulate your body.

2769
02:07:36,130 --> 02:07:37,390
Like that's the only thing that's 
missing.

2770
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,453
Like once they stimulate your mind,
maybe they will be able to put you in 

2771
02:07:40,061 --> 02:07:43,360
some sort of a trance.
Will you feel like it's stimulating your

2772
02:07:43,361 --> 02:07:44,194
body already in a trance.
Also looking at some thing that they're 

2773
02:07:46,331 --> 02:07:47,164
selling really recently got,
I'm trying to remember this because I 

2774
02:07:49,210 --> 02:07:50,590
saved it,
but I didn't read it,

2775
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:51,783
but it was talking about some new device
that's able to stimulate certain areas 

2776
02:07:56,621 --> 02:07:59,470
of the mind from,
from the outside of your head,

2777
02:08:00,580 --> 02:08:04,660
like they did a whole episode of radio 
lab about this sort of technology a long

2778
02:08:04,661 --> 02:08:07,090
time ago,
I want to say like two years ago maybe.

2779
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:09,040
And it was really interesting because it
was about,

2780
02:08:09,041 --> 02:08:09,874
um,
how they stimulate different parts of 

2781
02:08:12,161 --> 02:08:12,994
your scalp and through doing so it 
allows you to remember and learn things 

2782
02:08:16,601 --> 02:08:19,590
way quicker through electricity.
Maybe this is it,

2783
02:08:19,660 --> 02:08:22,190
nine volt nirvana as the episode of 
Radio Lab.

2784
02:08:22,320 --> 02:08:24,550
If you guys have never listened to radio
lab,

2785
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:25,563
it's fucking awesome.
It's one of the best podcasts in the 

2786
02:08:28,211 --> 02:08:30,030
world.
And uh,

2787
02:08:30,220 --> 02:08:31,840
it's,
it's really interesting.

2788
02:08:31,841 --> 02:08:34,780
And this is like one of my favorite 
episodes because it's about this girl,

2789
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:36,370
she,
this is how it starts off.

2790
02:08:36,400 --> 02:08:38,380
She works for this,
I should say woman,

2791
02:08:38,381 --> 02:08:39,610
she's a woman.
She has a good job.

2792
02:08:39,611 --> 02:08:40,444
She's a

2793
02:08:41,380 --> 02:08:44,170
sure child.
I'm not good.

2794
02:08:44,171 --> 02:08:46,740
I say girl boy for adults all the time

2795
02:08:46,790 --> 02:08:48,800
and I should fix that.
Yeah.

2796
02:08:49,100 --> 02:08:50,960
Who Care?
Full battery.

2797
02:08:51,020 --> 02:08:53,380
Yeah.
So she went there to um,

2798
02:08:53,480 --> 02:08:57,050
this place that train snipers,
snipers skills,

2799
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:58,940
um,
thing.

2800
02:08:59,150 --> 02:09:00,200
And what,
what it is,

2801
02:09:00,201 --> 02:09:02,030
is a video game,
a virtual reality thing.

2802
02:09:02,031 --> 02:09:04,820
So you put on the headset or you know,
they,

2803
02:09:04,840 --> 02:09:05,673
they take her through the thing with a 
gun and she shoots at all the different 

2804
02:09:08,121 --> 02:09:10,520
targets and all these different events 
happen in front of her.

2805
02:09:11,210 --> 02:09:14,030
And when it plays out,
after it's over,

2806
02:09:14,090 --> 02:09:17,600
they tally up your score.
So she does that in a normal way.

2807
02:09:17,660 --> 02:09:20,390
And then they stimulate the outside 
areas of her brain.

2808
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:21,733
She goes in,
it's supposed to be 20 minutes if they 

2809
02:09:24,021 --> 02:09:25,280
end it.
And she goes,

2810
02:09:25,281 --> 02:09:27,260
why'd you guys ended so quick?
And they go,

2811
02:09:27,261 --> 02:09:28,970
that was 20 minutes.
She's like,

2812
02:09:28,971 --> 02:09:31,190
what?
And then she hit every target.

2813
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:32,440
Well,
she was,

2814
02:09:32,440 --> 02:09:33,273
she was,
she went from being completely 

2815
02:09:34,461 --> 02:09:35,294
ineffective to being like a fucking 
world class sniper by just them jazzing 

2816
02:09:39,441 --> 02:09:43,010
or brain up and she went into the zone 
where she didn't even know she was doing

2817
02:09:43,011 --> 02:09:44,240
it.
So think about that.

2818
02:09:44,241 --> 02:09:47,810
She'd never done this before.
She sucked at it just a few minutes ago.

2819
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:48,913
They put these electrodes on their head,
they give it to her and then all of a 

2820
02:09:50,541 --> 02:09:51,130
sudden she's like,

2821
02:09:51,130 --> 02:09:53,660
that's interesting.
She's like a super soldier.

2822
02:09:53,720 --> 02:09:55,180
Is there any science today?
I mean,

2823
02:09:55,210 --> 02:09:56,043
is there somebody that's tested this 
because why aren't we all just putting 

2824
02:09:58,191 --> 02:09:59,780
nine volt batteries on her head?
Well,

2825
02:09:59,781 --> 02:10:01,370
they are testing it.
It's called,

2826
02:10:01,371 --> 02:10:05,720
what is the actual term?
Transdermal electrical stimulation.

2827
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:10,490
Dermal cranial volt batteries at home.
Hold on a second.

2828
02:10:10,580 --> 02:10:11,141
What?
Say it again?

2829
02:10:11,141 --> 02:10:14,720
I lost the word city in a trans 
transdermal cranial stimulation,

2830
02:10:14,721 --> 02:10:15,710
I believe.
I'm trying to.

2831
02:10:15,860 --> 02:10:17,750
Yeah,
I think that direct current stimulation.

2832
02:10:17,870 --> 02:10:19,010
That sounds right.
Yeah.

2833
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:21,380
Wow.
So this is apparently,

2834
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:22,683
um,
there's a lot of guys who hacked 

2835
02:10:23,301 --> 02:10:24,430
themselves and they,
uh,

2836
02:10:24,460 --> 02:10:25,293
they make their own little things with 
nine volt batteries and shit that you 

2837
02:10:27,081 --> 02:10:27,914
could buy from radio shack and they just
slap a little electrodes on their head 

2838
02:10:30,771 --> 02:10:35,510
and sap themselves sometimes kills her 
sense of smell for a week.

2839
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,150
I cook my sense of smell today,
dude,

2840
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:41,300
like this is,
I'm not joking like great,

2841
02:10:41,330 --> 02:10:42,163
but they get benefits out of it too.
Like people were there reporting 

2842
02:10:44,451 --> 02:10:45,284
benefits out of it,
like find a spot on the body or the 

2843
02:10:48,591 --> 02:10:49,424
brain rather where they get it from the 
outside and it makes some sort of an 

2844
02:10:51,591 --> 02:10:54,350
impact.
When you think about your skull,

2845
02:10:54,380 --> 02:10:56,000
right?
Think about your skin and your skull.

2846
02:10:56,150 --> 02:10:56,983
If somebody shaved a part of your head 
and attached some shit to the side of 

2847
02:10:59,781 --> 02:11:04,310
your head and then shot electricity into
that area,

2848
02:11:04,470 --> 02:11:06,530
like your brain's going to be affected 
by that.

2849
02:11:06,930 --> 02:11:07,763
I mean it's right there.
It's like pounded on the outside of the 

2850
02:11:10,371 --> 02:11:11,204
brand,
but there's got to be some of it that's 

2851
02:11:12,141 --> 02:11:13,100
going through it,
right?

2852
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:16,320
He's got to be some energy that's going 
through and that brain's like,

2853
02:11:17,780 --> 02:11:18,613
I know Kung Fu like in the matrix.
It's interesting like maybe even like 

2854
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:24,793
you could put like watch batteries on a 
molar so there has to be like another 

2855
02:11:27,081 --> 02:11:27,914
way to put it in your having a skullcap 
that has a battery attached to it that 

2856
02:11:31,251 --> 02:11:33,680
you can just wear everyday or something 
like that.

2857
02:11:33,770 --> 02:11:36,500
This is exactly yet.
Go Scroll back up please.

2858
02:11:38,080 --> 02:11:38,781
Foot.
What is it?

2859
02:11:38,781 --> 02:11:40,400
Hold on.
Stop Folk Dot.

2860
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:44,300
Hold on.
Was it doing spasm on you?

2861
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:49,040
We got to get a new laptop.
Things get old folk.us.

2862
02:11:49,041 --> 02:11:54,041
Trans Cranial direct current stimulation
headset helps get your game on.

2863
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:56,030
Wait a minute,
let me pause right here.

2864
02:11:56,060 --> 02:11:59,630
Speaking of game on,
I'm done filling my special,

2865
02:11:59,631 --> 02:12:00,464
so w,
w we gotta get a fucking land party 

2866
02:12:02,091 --> 02:12:03,230
going on up in this bit.

2867
02:12:04,670 --> 02:12:08,420
Now the quake is out.
I talked to the razor people.

2868
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:10,970
We're going to hook us up with some,
some gaming laptop,

2869
02:12:11,360 --> 02:12:13,510
putting quake.
Quake is coming.

2870
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:15,800
This is a quake champions or something.
It's called.

2871
02:12:15,801 --> 02:12:20,801
I think it looks bad ass pcs.
You can have you seen.

2872
02:12:24,250 --> 02:12:24,910
Well,
they,

2873
02:12:24,910 --> 02:12:25,820
uh,
it's interesting,

2874
02:12:25,821 --> 02:12:26,654
like I told you that I was one of the 
people that helped them design their 

2875
02:12:29,991 --> 02:12:33,860
mouse in the late nineties.
Me and my friend Lou Morton,

2876
02:12:33,890 --> 02:12:35,300
who,
one of the writers of news radio,

2877
02:12:35,301 --> 02:12:39,410
who's a super smart dude and a fucking 
total quake head back in the day.

2878
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:41,450
He was way better than me.
He used to beat my ass.

2879
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,130
Like I met her.
I beat his ass one time.

2880
02:12:43,131 --> 02:12:46,220
I was so happy.
Most of the time he fucked me up.

2881
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:50,690
He's just better quake.
Quake was this crazy three d video game.

2882
02:12:50,691 --> 02:12:51,290
This is it right here.

2883
02:12:51,290 --> 02:12:52,123
This is the newest version of it.
And you play in the first person and it 

2884
02:12:55,821 --> 02:12:59,810
is fucking.
The new ones are unbelievably cool.

2885
02:12:59,811 --> 02:13:04,490
Like the graphics are insane.
I gave you this sexy.

2886
02:13:04,970 --> 02:13:05,803
I mean,
and the end game footage of them 

2887
02:13:07,491 --> 02:13:09,890
actually playing the game.
It's just magical.

2888
02:13:11,480 --> 02:13:13,610
Look at this shit.
Come on.

2889
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:14,780
Why real life?
Fuck.

2890
02:13:14,781 --> 02:13:16,020
Real life.
Real life.

2891
02:13:16,130 --> 02:13:18,430
Suck my Dick.
Look at this way better than real life.

2892
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:23,570
You don't have any kids.
You can't pretend.

2893
02:13:23,600 --> 02:13:24,433
Oh,
okay.

2894
02:13:24,530 --> 02:13:26,240
Whoa.
See that someone shot,

2895
02:13:27,710 --> 02:13:29,690
oh my goodness,
Illinois.

2896
02:13:29,691 --> 02:13:34,691
You would be so aggressive with this 
because I know you are so aggressive.

2897
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:37,140
Well,
people don't know.

2898
02:13:37,340 --> 02:13:38,520
We haven't told them yet.
There you are.

2899
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:43,560
That's how I want to be.
There was this tremendous things.

2900
02:13:43,590 --> 02:13:44,610
I think it's out,
man.

2901
02:13:44,670 --> 02:13:47,550
This is that.
This was an old game you used to play.

2902
02:13:47,551 --> 02:13:48,750
That is now will.

2903
02:13:48,750 --> 02:13:52,140
They will obviously significantly 
upgraded the graphics.

2904
02:13:52,141 --> 02:13:55,410
I mean this is.
This is not really the game itself.

2905
02:13:55,411 --> 02:14:00,411
This is just the video game engine knows
the game is based on so this is similar,

2906
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:04,850
so violent.
It's similar to the solid,

2907
02:14:05,090 --> 02:14:07,290
like in game real footage.
Watch this.

2908
02:14:07,800 --> 02:14:11,900
Killed,
stabbed him with a fucking chainsaw.

2909
02:14:12,310 --> 02:14:13,143
How about that?
How great would that be if you had that 

2910
02:14:15,841 --> 02:14:19,950
real life?
It'd be a lot of trouble.

2911
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:23,920
When does that out?
Young Jamie just announced it.

2912
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:25,223
I would guess next year just announced a
set of three and this is a big 

2913
02:14:28,680 --> 02:14:30,090
announcement.
God Damn,

2914
02:14:30,091 --> 02:14:33,390
that looks they're going to announce it 
yet.

2915
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:36,330
Oh cool.
There's that and then there's doom which

2916
02:14:36,331 --> 02:14:39,030
is out and that's what we're going to 
have the land party plan.

2917
02:14:39,060 --> 02:14:40,950
Dude,
there's a new doom that's based on.

2918
02:14:40,951 --> 02:14:43,000
I think it's the same engine.
It's full.

2919
02:14:43,830 --> 02:14:46,650
So when you say you have a,
what are you saying?

2920
02:14:46,650 --> 02:14:48,450
You're going to have a land land.
Oh,

2921
02:14:48,451 --> 02:14:51,080
local area network.
Lan Party.

2922
02:14:51,930 --> 02:14:55,320
A local area network party is you get a 
bunch of computers.

2923
02:14:55,321 --> 02:15:00,210
You linked them all together so that you
have zero ping so there's no latency.

2924
02:15:00,211 --> 02:15:02,610
What that means is like when you play a 
game online,

2925
02:15:02,930 --> 02:15:05,700
like at least in the older games,
they're getting way better at it now and

2926
02:15:05,900 --> 02:15:06,733
internet speeds are way higher anyway,
but when you would press a button like 

2927
02:15:09,030 --> 02:15:09,863
try to shoot,
there was a delay between the time that 

2928
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:12,953
the signal got to the server that's 
hosting the game and if you were lucky 

2929
02:15:16,111 --> 02:15:19,410
you had like a low paying like guys had 
like a 30 paying or a 20 page and you're

2930
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:22,830
like whoa guys got an awesome paying.
Like then it got even lower so some guys

2931
02:15:22,831 --> 02:15:23,664
get cable modems and shit and it got 
down to like 10 and if you were local 

2932
02:15:26,701 --> 02:15:28,410
though,
there was zero ping.

2933
02:15:28,590 --> 02:15:31,410
So like if we were all together and 
we're playing in this room,

2934
02:15:31,411 --> 02:15:34,830
we would play against each other in this
crazy three d environment like this.

2935
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:36,570
This is what we would see.
I missed it.

2936
02:15:36,571 --> 02:15:39,960
This is like a lawn parties and this is 
real end game footage.

2937
02:15:40,350 --> 02:15:43,380
Game footage is fucking amazing.
Look at this.

2938
02:15:43,410 --> 02:15:46,470
This is all in game footage.
That's cool.

2939
02:15:46,530 --> 02:15:50,040
And then some of it's not so it's 
they're mixing up but it's dope.

2940
02:15:50,280 --> 02:15:52,760
I played like a weird game with my 
niece,

2941
02:15:52,761 --> 02:15:54,030
Shawna.
I don't remember what it was,

2942
02:15:54,031 --> 02:15:57,000
but there was four of us connected on 
the I pads.

2943
02:15:57,210 --> 02:16:00,870
Oh yeah.
People do that to tablets and stuff,

2944
02:16:00,871 --> 02:16:01,910
right?
Yeah.

2945
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:03,630
Well they're probably doing that with 
Pokemons,

2946
02:16:03,631 --> 02:16:05,130
right?
Kind of.

2947
02:16:05,190 --> 02:16:06,023
Yeah.
I mean it's not direct direct that 

2948
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:10,740
person to person yet so weird.
But it was cool.

2949
02:16:10,741 --> 02:16:11,371
I was like,
wait,

2950
02:16:11,371 --> 02:16:12,990
we're all connected.
Like the idiot.

2951
02:16:13,590 --> 02:16:14,730
This is what they're going to do,
man.

2952
02:16:14,731 --> 02:16:15,564
They're going to have these things like 
these video games like doom and they're 

2953
02:16:18,301 --> 02:16:19,134
going to have those three d,
like virtual reality sets and you're 

2954
02:16:21,691 --> 02:16:23,850
going to be playing these things out 
there in the real world.

2955
02:16:23,851 --> 02:16:25,620
That's when people are gonna start 
getting run over.

2956
02:16:26,640 --> 02:16:27,990
I'm going to play in the real world

2957
02:16:30,940 --> 02:16:31,773
for real.
Driving people around like Uber Service 

2958
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:35,463
for Pokemon.
Right now there's craigslist ads up 

2959
02:16:38,580 --> 02:16:39,413
anywhere you want to go for 30 bucks.
I take Uber every day and that's one of 

2960
02:16:42,041 --> 02:16:42,874
the greatest benefits now that because 
usually you just sitting in the back of 

2961
02:16:44,861 --> 02:16:46,510
an uber going,
God go hurry up,

2962
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:47,373
you know,
but now I was just collecting pokemons 

2963
02:16:48,730 --> 02:16:50,470
on the way to the comedy store and tell 
the guy,

2964
02:16:50,471 --> 02:16:51,061
hey,
pull over.

2965
02:16:51,061 --> 02:16:52,420
I got to get a pokemon.
No,

2966
02:16:52,421 --> 02:16:54,040
but there was a few times where I was 
like,

2967
02:16:54,100 --> 02:16:55,270
I almost wanted to say,
hey,

2968
02:16:55,271 --> 02:16:56,800
can you just go slow right here for a 
second?

2969
02:16:56,980 --> 02:16:57,813
So as you go slow,
it would pick up the fact that you were 

2970
02:16:59,730 --> 02:17:00,221
there.
Yeah,

2971
02:17:00,221 --> 02:17:02,710
it's easier.
It's easier to go.

2972
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:05,170
If you're going slow,
it's easier to get things.

2973
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:07,690
I thought I heard that you can't do it 
over 30 miles an hour.

2974
02:17:07,690 --> 02:17:10,900
Like it has some sort of you you can.
No,

2975
02:17:11,110 --> 02:17:13,480
it doesn't work.
It's harder to do like you can't.

2976
02:17:13,500 --> 02:17:15,790
Like when you can't do your gps.
If you're the driver,

2977
02:17:15,791 --> 02:17:17,170
you can't be doing this while you're 
moving.

2978
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:19,690
You say you're the passenger.
Say Shut up.

2979
02:17:19,691 --> 02:17:22,570
Mind Your Business.
They're probably going to have to change

2980
02:17:22,571 --> 02:17:23,404
because I feel like a lot of people are 
gonna die and get in car accidents and 

2981
02:17:25,721 --> 02:17:26,554
there's gonna be a lot of lawsuits,
so I have a feeling in the near future 

2982
02:17:28,541 --> 02:17:29,374
they're probably going to make it so if 
it detects that you're going a certain 

2983
02:17:31,511 --> 02:17:32,344
speed,
it's just not going to let you do 

2984
02:17:32,861 --> 02:17:35,950
anything.
Did you get laid playing pokemon go?

2985
02:17:36,550 --> 02:17:38,830
Pokemon go is great for my mental 
health.

2986
02:17:39,040 --> 02:17:40,840
I also got laid.
Oh,

2987
02:17:41,320 --> 02:17:46,240
pokemon got me laid.
I just got laid by telling my girl I had

2988
02:17:46,241 --> 02:17:48,370
to go inside or to catch a Pikachu.

2989
02:17:49,690 --> 02:17:54,690
Pokemon used her as a pokey ball for the
electric pokey,

2990
02:17:55,151 --> 02:18:00,151
Mongo Pokemongo hope Jesus Christ 
pokemon.

2991
02:18:01,480 --> 02:18:02,313
In the beginning.
I don't know any Japanese for pocket 

2992
02:18:05,740 --> 02:18:07,510
monster.
Monster or something,

2993
02:18:07,520 --> 02:18:08,353
I think it's a cartoon or something 
that's a cartoon and then it became a 

2994
02:18:12,251 --> 02:18:13,084
very successful line of video games for 
kids on Nintendo and game boys and 

2995
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:18,453
stuff,
but it was really all just preparing 

2996
02:18:19,421 --> 02:18:21,670
itself for this monstrous for this 
moment,

2997
02:18:22,190 --> 02:18:23,023
but it brought it up.
I mean it was dying out so that should 

2998
02:18:25,071 --> 02:18:27,070
have worn my pikachu outfit today.
Well,

2999
02:18:27,071 --> 02:18:27,904
it's obviously didn't raise the stock.
Would you say like $9 billion or 

3000
02:18:30,401 --> 02:18:32,140
something crazy?
That nine slash 11.

3001
02:18:32,200 --> 02:18:37,200
I said 11 minutes.
11 stocks are just like they're going to

3002
02:18:37,241 --> 02:18:40,440
have all the money.
Stock in Nintendo has been hurting for a

3003
02:18:40,450 --> 02:18:42,880
while too,
since have xbox and playstation and this

3004
02:18:42,881 --> 02:18:43,714
is the exact thing they needed was this 
sounds like they just made a money 

3005
02:18:46,811 --> 02:18:47,770
printing machine.

3006
02:18:48,130 --> 02:18:48,963
That's insane.
I don't know where the money comes in 

3007
02:18:51,100 --> 02:18:51,933
because it's a free game now.
You could buy things in it like that 

3008
02:18:54,431 --> 02:18:57,670
thing that you put down on the ground 
that attracts pokemon.

3009
02:18:57,671 --> 02:19:01,300
All those things cost money,
so just the potential,

3010
02:19:01,690 --> 02:19:03,430
the potential,
the connection that you're having.

3011
02:19:03,620 --> 02:19:06,820
If you all of a sudden created an APP 
that beats twitter,

3012
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:08,023
twitter's been around forever.
If you come up with something that can 

3013
02:19:09,671 --> 02:19:10,504
be twitter like that,
you could figure out how to make money 

3014
02:19:11,771 --> 02:19:12,850
on it.
Like my God,

3015
02:19:12,851 --> 02:19:14,180
snapchat,
he wanted that.

3016
02:19:14,230 --> 02:19:17,350
I say this but it hasn't.
Twitter had that same exact problem.

3017
02:19:17,351 --> 02:19:19,010
They've had a problem like monetizing 
now.

3018
02:19:21,040 --> 02:19:25,810
Snapchat just surpassed twitter and I 
think twitter is on their way out.

3019
02:19:25,811 --> 02:19:28,070
Honestly,
Pokey Mon could

3020
02:19:28,070 --> 02:19:28,903
set up.
They could set up like stops where like 

3021
02:19:31,041 --> 02:19:31,874
you could like have places that were 
places of business and you could pay to 

3022
02:19:36,351 --> 02:19:37,184
have that stop and people have to go in 
and then a certain amount of people 

3023
02:19:39,651 --> 02:19:40,484
would just buy things there anyway,
but then you do deal with a lot of 

3024
02:19:42,801 --> 02:19:44,900
fucking nutty people showing up your ice
cream store.

3025
02:19:45,600 --> 02:19:46,840
But now wait,
twitter.

3026
02:19:47,430 --> 02:19:49,940
I just learned how to tweet.
Welcome that.

3027
02:19:50,910 --> 02:19:52,550
That's it.
Like 15 years old.

3028
02:19:52,900 --> 02:19:53,733
I quit snap chat.
I'll try to get all of my different 

3029
02:19:59,690 --> 02:20:04,690
possible names.
I mean snapchat is somebody snatched up.

3030
02:20:04,790 --> 02:20:06,020
Yeah,
it's impossible.

3031
02:20:06,021 --> 02:20:07,730
I don't.
I'm not really on snapchat.

3032
02:20:07,850 --> 02:20:11,870
I'm only on snapchat.
Filters to make to make fun.

3033
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:13,750
I like that

3034
02:20:13,830 --> 02:20:16,620
Florida and they're so great.
People will send me some,

3035
02:20:16,650 --> 02:20:18,990
some great porn.
I'm not going to say who,

3036
02:20:18,991 --> 02:20:22,110
but this MMA fighter that he's a 
comedian also.

3037
02:20:22,200 --> 02:20:24,120
He's just,
he,

3038
02:20:24,150 --> 02:20:25,920
he,
he has a different girl every night that

3039
02:20:25,921 --> 02:20:28,560
he sends me like just snaps of him 
fucking.

3040
02:20:28,650 --> 02:20:30,210
I've seen his as Dick more than I went 
to,

3041
02:20:30,211 --> 02:20:32,580
but he sending them directly to you on 
purpose.

3042
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:36,600
Kinda funky directly to you is great.
Uh,

3043
02:20:36,780 --> 02:20:37,613
but no,
the porn is great though on there 

3044
02:20:38,881 --> 02:20:42,330
because a lot of girls use it.
A lot of porn stars and stuff like that.

3045
02:20:42,331 --> 02:20:43,021
Use it like,
Hey,

3046
02:20:43,021 --> 02:20:45,900
if you give me so many tokens or 
whatever,

3047
02:20:45,901 --> 02:20:48,460
you can get my snapchat.
So then they're snapshots.

3048
02:20:48,480 --> 02:20:51,860
They're just like full on nudity because
snapchat.

3049
02:20:52,380 --> 02:20:53,520
Jamie,
I don't know if this is correct,

3050
02:20:53,521 --> 02:20:54,354
but isn't snapchat owned by like a porn 
company like pornhub or somebody famous 

3051
02:20:58,801 --> 02:21:03,300
porn companies started snapchat because 
they originally wanted to say no.

3052
02:21:04,200 --> 02:21:05,033
They originally wanted to have it as an 
app where you can show your Dick and it 

3053
02:21:07,651 --> 02:21:09,810
goes away in 10 seconds,
but I swear to God,

3054
02:21:09,811 --> 02:21:11,610
somebody told me that pornhub is the.

3055
02:21:11,960 --> 02:21:13,540
He just started.
It's only 26.

3056
02:21:13,541 --> 02:21:16,150
I don't know that he also is involved in
porn his whole life.

3057
02:21:16,660 --> 02:21:18,700
How dare you,
Brian got my hopes up.

3058
02:21:18,701 --> 02:21:21,700
Somebody told me be the.
It could be his early investors.

3059
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:25,440
You're saying somebody told me this as 
if you're shocked that people retarded.

3060
02:21:25,940 --> 02:21:29,420
Like somebody told me this person.
Well,

3061
02:21:29,470 --> 02:21:32,920
people get definitely get it wrong.
You know that's funny.

3062
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,010
That's funny was whoever told me it was 
very sure that I was like,

3063
02:21:36,200 --> 02:21:39,310
because that was probably on coke cooked
up and they were telling you the truth.

3064
02:21:39,610 --> 02:21:41,140
I'm telling you bro.
So fucking true.

3065
02:21:41,950 --> 02:21:43,320
I know my shit.
Elena,

3066
02:21:43,330 --> 02:21:44,163
what happened?
That pro wrestling thing you were going 

3067
02:21:44,861 --> 02:21:46,120
out for recently?
Oh,

3068
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:49,670
it was a script that just.
They haven't started casting.

3069
02:21:49,671 --> 02:21:52,780
Yep.
They just put out calls for two days ago

3070
02:21:52,781 --> 02:21:55,060
or something like that.
People probably don't even know.

3071
02:21:55,600 --> 02:21:58,900
It was one of the women of wrestling,
wrestling,

3072
02:21:58,930 --> 02:21:59,763
easy rider.
She used to crush pool balls and to 

3073
02:22:02,860 --> 02:22:03,693
scare her enemies was hilarious.
My favorite video to make like to hit 

3074
02:22:07,421 --> 02:22:08,254
people and then the crush the ball.
I had so much I must have like 30 balls 

3075
02:22:11,171 --> 02:22:12,004
that day just for fun because we're the 
only person that I knew before they did 

3076
02:22:15,850 --> 02:22:17,770
pro wrestling than I went to see them do
progress.

3077
02:22:17,880 --> 02:22:22,880
Like I remember you came don king a 
great time.

3078
02:22:24,450 --> 02:22:26,110
We brought a stack of people

3079
02:22:26,350 --> 02:22:28,270
store or from the store either.
Oh,

3080
02:22:28,271 --> 02:22:29,970
who'd you.
Which one did you get there?

3081
02:22:29,971 --> 02:22:33,110
She is talking trash.
How long did you do this for?

3082
02:22:33,390 --> 02:22:36,890
It was on for Tuesday.
That was Maria and Julia Ross.

3083
02:22:36,891 --> 02:22:38,030
He's a comic.
And Maria,

3084
02:22:38,031 --> 02:22:38,864
I forget her last name,
but they were easy rider for how 

3085
02:22:47,320 --> 02:22:49,030
embarrassed.
Look at this.

3086
02:22:51,320 --> 02:22:52,153
What?

3087
02:22:52,180 --> 02:22:54,650
Oh boy.
Oh Shit.

3088
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:57,820
Broke Salinas leg remember?
Yeah.

3089
02:22:57,821 --> 02:22:58,654
And didn't you.
Did someone break their leg 

3090
02:22:59,321 --> 02:23:01,390
accidentally?
Selena?

3091
02:23:01,620 --> 02:23:04,030
No,
she didn't hurt her leg.

3092
02:23:04,210 --> 02:23:05,760
She muscle.
Yeah.

3093
02:23:06,130 --> 02:23:09,730
She pulled a muscle or something.
So she is pulling a muscle.

3094
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:11,530
Yeah,
she had the brains,

3095
02:23:11,531 --> 02:23:13,210
the knee brace.
She had something going on.

3096
02:23:13,211 --> 02:23:14,330
I can't remember.
Yeah.

3097
02:23:14,970 --> 02:23:17,850
Well,
there was part of the story wrong.

3098
02:23:18,370 --> 02:23:19,203
Good Lord was our trainer and she is 
amazing and so was the big lady that's 

3099
02:23:22,601 --> 02:23:24,820
with me.
Thug.

3100
02:23:25,150 --> 02:23:29,530
We did this for two seasons.
It got canceled because um,

3101
02:23:30,070 --> 02:23:35,070
we did a paper view and what?
I can't look at that now.

3102
02:23:35,740 --> 02:23:36,573
Yeah.
It didn't make any money and it wasn't 

3103
02:23:37,511 --> 02:23:38,344
just doing well,
it just wasn't doing that well in the 

3104
02:23:40,151 --> 02:23:41,740
ratings.
But David Mclain guy,

3105
02:23:41,741 --> 02:23:43,720
the producer,
he's bringing it back and he's putting a

3106
02:23:43,730 --> 02:23:45,400
digital and I'm going to be an 
announcer.

3107
02:23:45,490 --> 02:23:46,323
Oh really?
So obviously I'm not gonna let them 

3108
02:23:49,451 --> 02:23:52,260
throw me around.
I could break a hip lately,

3109
02:23:52,780 --> 02:23:56,290
but I still love it because they trained
us to be professional stunt women,

3110
02:23:56,350 --> 02:23:57,183
you know?

3111
02:23:59,180 --> 02:24:00,013
Well it was really physical.
She hit me with a chair and I broke my 

3112
02:24:03,311 --> 02:24:04,144
pinky.
What was the one girl that was supposed 

3113
02:24:05,741 --> 02:24:07,510
to be like the Baywatch girl?
Oh,

3114
02:24:07,511 --> 02:24:12,511
there was two of them.
Like compton girls were a little racist.

3115
02:24:13,121 --> 02:24:17,890
Stereotypes was one girl is a god.
I can't think of her name,

3116
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:20,950
her stage name,
but she basically played basketball,

3117
02:24:21,010 --> 02:24:23,860
slam dunk.
That was a slam dunk.

3118
02:24:23,861 --> 02:24:25,870
I knew it was something silly.
I mean,

3119
02:24:25,880 --> 02:24:28,720
while she's an,
she's an amazing athlete and uh,

3120
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:29,913
she still,
I don't know if she's coming back for 

3121
02:24:31,781 --> 02:24:33,190
this one,
but jungle girl,

3122
02:24:33,220 --> 02:24:34,660
Erica Porter,
she runs a gym.

3123
02:24:34,840 --> 02:24:36,580
She was out there.
So they're a slam dunk.

3124
02:24:36,581 --> 02:24:38,830
Yeah.
A John was jungle girl.

3125
02:24:38,860 --> 02:24:40,690
Jungle girl was one of the other 
characters,

3126
02:24:40,691 --> 02:24:43,180
but she's,
that shit is not going to fly.

3127
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:45,520
That's Bronco.
Billy Lisa.

3128
02:24:45,580 --> 02:24:47,200
Danielle.
She's beautiful.

3129
02:24:47,201 --> 02:24:48,490
She's great.
She's from Baltimore.

3130
02:24:48,490 --> 02:24:52,670
But then where are the uh,
summer look at that moment?

3131
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:54,010
Yeah,
there was summer.

3132
02:24:54,011 --> 02:24:55,640
There was a bunch of different 
characters.

3133
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:57,263
Geez Louise,
a long time ago in the early nineties I 

3134
02:25:00,341 --> 02:25:01,390
believe,
or late eighties,

3135
02:25:01,391 --> 02:25:02,224
there was a show called glow gorgeous 
ladies of wrestling and that was the 

3136
02:25:04,511 --> 02:25:05,344
same producer and they're the ones that 
have a script out called glow and it's 

3137
02:25:09,310 --> 02:25:11,740
bought.
Netflix bought it kg.

3138
02:25:11,850 --> 02:25:15,490
That's how raised property of the state.
What does it say?

3139
02:25:16,660 --> 02:25:20,920
God property of the State Prison.
These girls in orange jumpsuits.

3140
02:25:20,921 --> 02:25:22,750
Every one of those girls that are so 
talented,

3141
02:25:22,780 --> 02:25:24,400
like athlete,
amazing

3142
02:25:24,400 --> 02:25:25,233
stunt.
They really are strong danger for two 

3143
02:25:27,941 --> 02:25:29,550
years.
Did this.

3144
02:25:30,220 --> 02:25:33,400
And how many shows,
like how many shows a year would you do?

3145
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:35,800
We did that.
That must be the new cast.

3146
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:37,810
That must be the newer one.
Yeah.

3147
02:25:37,850 --> 02:25:41,650
Because there's Lonna and all the girls.
Erica porters so strong.

3148
02:25:41,710 --> 02:25:42,640
I love her.
AndL ,

3149
02:25:43,070 --> 02:25:44,500
uh,
her name was danger.

3150
02:25:44,501 --> 02:25:47,620
She's like a professional stump person 
that does movies.

3151
02:25:47,621 --> 02:25:49,060
Everything.
Um,

3152
02:25:49,390 --> 02:25:50,350
but yeah,
so we did,

3153
02:25:50,351 --> 02:25:51,184
I forget how many shows,
but it was at the forum which was 

3154
02:25:52,871 --> 02:25:56,260
amazing in Englewood.
So we were trained at the forum and we'd

3155
02:25:56,261 --> 02:25:59,640
be running around Johnny and Michael 
Cooper would be a,

3156
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:02,410
he was the coach of the sparks at the 
time.

3157
02:26:02,411 --> 02:26:04,060
So like Lisa,
Leslie and then we'll be down there.

3158
02:26:04,180 --> 02:26:05,920
Did the UFC there recently?
Oh,

3159
02:26:05,921 --> 02:26:07,840
that's awesome.
Isn't it such a great place.

3160
02:26:07,900 --> 02:26:10,450
I mean it's a giant facility and it's 
amazing.

3161
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:11,283
And then on the walls that has all the 
different people that have played there 

3162
02:26:13,631 --> 02:26:16,710
every year,
how many times they played with my name.

3163
02:26:16,720 --> 02:26:17,760
Oh Shit.
We're.

3164
02:26:17,780 --> 02:26:18,613
No,
no,

3165
02:26:19,090 --> 02:26:22,300
no.
I think dices namely up there though.

3166
02:26:22,360 --> 02:26:23,520
Oh yeah.
I said the form.

3167
02:26:23,530 --> 02:26:25,270
That's right.
It was a,

3168
02:26:25,390 --> 02:26:28,540
it was filled with like legendary 
musicians though.

3169
02:26:28,541 --> 02:26:31,930
When you're walking down the hall and 
you like Reading Times Queen was there.

3170
02:26:32,860 --> 02:26:34,060
Yeah.
It's amazing.

3171
02:26:34,270 --> 02:26:36,070
That's a great spot.
I mean,

3172
02:26:36,130 --> 02:26:38,740
I was honored to be.
Yeah,

3173
02:26:39,070 --> 02:26:42,820
that's all from my instagram,
stevie wonder Doobie brothers,

3174
02:26:42,970 --> 02:26:47,620
easy rider and Alice Cooper thinks it's 
crazy and that's just.

3175
02:26:47,890 --> 02:26:51,590
This is like Elton John Four Times in a 
year coaching.

3176
02:26:52,930 --> 02:26:53,740
Right.

3177
02:26:53,740 --> 02:26:55,630
Just crazy.

3178
02:26:57,520 --> 02:26:59,210
David Kelly.
Oh Man.

3179
02:26:59,890 --> 02:27:00,723
Wild Shit.
It's just those places are so 

3180
02:27:02,471 --> 02:27:07,270
interesting to me because uh,
like these old old venues,

3181
02:27:07,271 --> 02:27:11,740
they're almost like a museum as well as 
being like a place where you see a show.

3182
02:27:11,780 --> 02:27:12,880
Yeah.
Yeah.

3183
02:27:13,060 --> 02:27:16,540
I mean so much went on in place so many.
And you could feel it.

3184
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:19,030
Even being in there during the day,
like I was still honored.

3185
02:27:19,031 --> 02:27:22,720
I know just wrassling whatever.
But it was big deal to me,

3186
02:27:22,721 --> 02:27:23,554
like to be a part of that.
Well that's one of the reasons why I 

3187
02:27:25,271 --> 02:27:26,104
think like the comedy store has to get 
some sort of historic designation and 

3188
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:32,230
they should.
We've tried to get that.

3189
02:27:32,231 --> 02:27:34,750
I remember doing this should happen 
because that,

3190
02:27:34,751 --> 02:27:37,630
that place is like historic.
It's like a museum.

3191
02:27:37,631 --> 02:27:38,464
I mean it really is from the pictures on
the walls to just the feel of the place 

3192
02:27:43,181 --> 02:27:46,690
and how important that is for one 
particular art form.

3193
02:27:47,060 --> 02:27:48,910
You know,
that place is like a fucking museum,

3194
02:27:48,970 --> 02:27:50,320
like a living,
breathing.

3195
02:27:50,380 --> 02:27:52,360
Awesome.
You can go to it right now.

3196
02:27:52,361 --> 02:27:53,194
Museum.
I feel like we tried to get it as a 

3197
02:27:55,210 --> 02:27:59,170
landmark or something like that,
but it didn't work because it's too many

3198
02:27:59,171 --> 02:28:02,410
bodies underneath something like,
like the Chinese theater.

3199
02:28:02,430 --> 02:28:05,530
Like wouldn't you think that that place 
it needs to stay around commands.

3200
02:28:05,531 --> 02:28:07,090
Chinese theater,
this right.

3201
02:28:07,570 --> 02:28:09,640
Considered it.
I would imagine it shouldn't be.

3202
02:28:09,700 --> 02:28:10,533
It has to be at.
It should try to do it before the Mitzi 

3203
02:28:14,261 --> 02:28:16,780
passes because so it can't get torn 
down.

3204
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:18,400
Well that.
But that was the whole thing.

3205
02:28:18,401 --> 02:28:20,680
Yeah.
Like when I was her personal assistant,

3206
02:28:20,681 --> 02:28:22,130
we tried to get all kinds of stuff

3207
02:28:22,130 --> 02:28:22,963
like that because there was like they 
were coming after us for different 

3208
02:28:24,741 --> 02:28:28,250
things like not being up to date on 
certain codes,

3209
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:31,580
laws and things.
And then we were grandfathered in from a

3210
02:28:31,581 --> 02:28:33,800
lot of them and we got away with a lot 
of them,

3211
02:28:33,801 --> 02:28:34,634
so it was like weird,
but I remember trying to get that and I 

3212
02:28:36,141 --> 02:28:39,680
don't know if they ever followed through
with that pos to find that out,

3213
02:28:40,040 --> 02:28:42,250
check it out.
But they definitely showed.

3214
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:43,160
You're right.
Yeah,

3215
02:28:43,370 --> 02:28:46,250
it obviously because it was there a long
way longer than Ciro's.

3216
02:28:46,310 --> 02:28:49,880
Ciro's was a hotspot in the back in the 
day.

3217
02:28:50,390 --> 02:28:52,580
That was like where Lucille Ball Hong 
and all that.

3218
02:28:52,690 --> 02:28:56,150
Like the main room that was.
That was a big deal to Hollywood too.

3219
02:28:56,480 --> 02:29:01,310
But I don't know how long that was open.
Maybe only five years,

3220
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:02,990
10 years maybe.
Maybe.

3221
02:29:03,210 --> 02:29:04,043
But there's so many pictures of Marilyn 
Monroe and all Sammy Davis junior and 

3222
02:29:09,320 --> 02:29:10,100
Frank Sinatra.

3223
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:12,800
They would play there on the weekend,
like a regular thing,

3224
02:29:12,870 --> 02:29:16,250
but that logic than it should have never
been allowed to become a comedy store.

3225
02:29:16,251 --> 02:29:17,180
That's what I'm saying.
I'm like,

3226
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:21,470
I'm not sure what the etiquette is.
I probably don't remember what that part

3227
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:23,153
wasn't Ciro's.
I'll have to figure that out long 

3228
02:29:24,640 --> 02:29:25,473
enough.
It couldn't have been as nearly as long 

3229
02:29:26,391 --> 02:29:28,570
as it was the store right now,
but when she,

3230
02:29:28,600 --> 02:29:30,450
she got the original roof first,
right.

3231
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:34,430
And then she bought the main room later,
so when she bought the main room,

3232
02:29:34,520 --> 02:29:37,670
when she bought it for which she,
she loved that serious thing,

3233
02:29:37,790 --> 02:29:38,780
that vibe,
you know,

3234
02:29:38,781 --> 02:29:43,070
like the big bands and stuff like that.
So she would have buddy rich,

3235
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:44,273
uh,
on the weekends at the comedy store 

3236
02:29:46,020 --> 02:29:50,030
playing like a big his band.
And I remember like dice going,

3237
02:29:50,110 --> 02:29:53,610
I'm 17 years.
Oh shoot was was 17,

3238
02:29:55,070 --> 02:29:56,420
19,
47.

3239
02:29:58,070 --> 02:30:00,440
Transformed a rock and roll club in the 
early because he bought it.

3240
02:30:01,130 --> 02:30:05,630
What was the guy that's bought it became
a comedy store and he was a DJ.

3241
02:30:05,830 --> 02:30:08,070
Look at that fucking neon sign.
Look how cool that is.

3242
02:30:08,180 --> 02:30:09,200
Yeah,
we have that.

3243
02:30:09,290 --> 02:30:12,650
Wow.
We have the neon sign in the basement,

3244
02:30:13,260 --> 02:30:14,093
the basement the other day.
That's how we do the comedy store 

3245
02:30:17,070 --> 02:30:18,800
podcasts,
basement.

3246
02:30:18,801 --> 02:30:23,801
They have that thing I'm thinking of the
big round one we have in the kitchen.

3247
02:30:26,040 --> 02:30:30,200
The kitchen is amazing,
but she yet all that was in the basement

3248
02:30:30,201 --> 02:30:33,080
when she bought it from the Dj.
What was the DJC?

3249
02:30:33,081 --> 02:30:35,570
Mcafee was his name.
He ran the main room.

3250
02:30:35,750 --> 02:30:36,890
He was,
he owned that.

3251
02:30:36,891 --> 02:30:38,540
She bought it from him.
That's incredible.

3252
02:30:38,720 --> 02:30:39,590
Yeah.
So.

3253
02:30:39,591 --> 02:30:44,360
And that was 78 or 70?
Seventy two.

3254
02:30:44,390 --> 02:30:46,340
And then yeah,
around there,

3255
02:30:46,341 --> 02:30:47,660
like 76,
70,

3256
02:30:47,690 --> 02:30:48,523
76 maybe.
She bought the main room and that 

3257
02:30:50,931 --> 02:30:51,764
became,
it was just a weird like for link 40 

3258
02:30:53,440 --> 02:30:54,800
years of history.

3259
02:30:54,990 --> 02:30:58,610
Yeah,
just a few spots like that in,

3260
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:00,583
in all of entertainment.
We're also many things were created or 

3261
02:31:02,640 --> 02:31:03,880
the one area.
Yeah,

3262
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:07,970
it's not like a whole lot of those spots
were important.

3263
02:31:08,090 --> 02:31:10,430
She wanted me to help her write a book 
and I was thinking,

3264
02:31:10,431 --> 02:31:11,264
wow,
Mitzi wanted me to help her write a 

3265
02:31:12,261 --> 02:31:12,950
book.
And I was like,

3266
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:13,783
wow,
that would be telling me I can barely 

3267
02:31:15,411 --> 02:31:16,244
read a book.
I'll try because I was still into the 

3268
02:31:18,291 --> 02:31:20,910
comedy store and then she,
um,

3269
02:31:21,150 --> 02:31:24,340
what she really wanted to make was like 
a coffee table book from um,

3270
02:31:24,990 --> 02:31:25,823
all the stuff in Vegas because Vegas,
she did go there in the dunes hotel for 

3271
02:31:30,340 --> 02:31:34,230
awhile and yeah,
there were some great footage.

3272
02:31:34,231 --> 02:31:36,540
Pictures.
She has audio Westwood.

3273
02:31:37,020 --> 02:31:38,130
Westwood.
Yeah.

3274
02:31:38,160 --> 02:31:41,160
Westwood was a big one.
Apparently there was all before my time,

3275
02:31:41,161 --> 02:31:41,994
but Westwood apparently was where guys 
would develop Kennison and those guys 

3276
02:31:46,111 --> 02:31:46,944
down there they would develop at 
Westwood and then they would come over 

3277
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:51,150
Hollywood once we'd already got their 
feet under them.

3278
02:31:51,200 --> 02:31:52,033
Yup.
Yeah,

3279
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:54,120
yeah.
Dice has a lot of stories.

3280
02:31:54,121 --> 02:31:54,954
Ronnie Kenny,
all those older guys I haven't talked 

3281
02:31:56,021 --> 02:31:56,854
to,
they would always tell Westwood's 

3282
02:31:57,271 --> 02:31:57,871
stories.
I'd be like,

3283
02:31:57,871 --> 02:32:00,120
what?
What do you thinking about with cool.

3284
02:32:00,270 --> 02:32:04,500
Here it is store west.
That's so cool.

3285
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:06,600
Look at Jay Leno.
Yeah,

3286
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:08,760
it looks so fresh.
Fish.

3287
02:32:09,470 --> 02:32:13,110
He admits were the other guys.
Good question.

3288
02:32:13,111 --> 02:32:14,670
I'm going to have to look.
I think billy,

3289
02:32:14,680 --> 02:32:18,490
uh,
so Rick Wright,

3290
02:32:19,280 --> 02:32:23,350
he was just on Mark Merrin's podcast.
Billy Billy West,

3291
02:32:23,890 --> 02:32:25,950
little skinnier guy.
I can't think of his name.

3292
02:32:25,951 --> 02:32:28,050
He did a cartoon again,
last name?

3293
02:32:28,630 --> 02:32:30,750
No,
you already asked that.

3294
02:32:31,370 --> 02:32:34,050
Maybe she didn't hear Robin Williams.
Oh,

3295
02:32:34,060 --> 02:32:37,830
he's doing golf.
He's so cute,

3296
02:32:38,950 --> 02:32:41,820
man.
Then of course La Jolla,

3297
02:32:41,821 --> 02:32:42,654
which is real similar as well.
It's a strange place that people get 

3298
02:32:45,421 --> 02:32:48,510
sent down there.
Like other guys that are coming up.

3299
02:32:49,290 --> 02:32:54,290
I got lucky club with Tommy booking me 
in La Jolla a lot to develop.

3300
02:32:55,890 --> 02:33:00,000
When I first started sending me down as 
an opener and I'm just so broke.

3301
02:33:00,001 --> 02:33:00,571
I was like,
yeah,

3302
02:33:00,571 --> 02:33:02,280
I'll take you know,
exciting.

3303
02:33:02,310 --> 02:33:05,250
It was like 700 bucks just house for the
weekend.

3304
02:33:05,251 --> 02:33:06,270
You're like,
this is awesome.

3305
02:33:06,630 --> 02:33:07,700
And so,
uh,

3306
02:33:07,920 --> 02:33:09,270
yeah,
I go down a lot.

3307
02:33:09,271 --> 02:33:10,104
So I got like,
I fell in love with that club as a 

3308
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:13,090
comic.
Yeah,

3309
02:33:13,250 --> 02:33:15,150
condo.
Nick Apollo.

3310
02:33:15,151 --> 02:33:18,670
Did a comedy special there or a CD?
Well,

3311
02:33:18,760 --> 02:33:22,410
he was funny.
One of my favorites,

3312
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:23,513
one time I was a town coordinator for a 
week because Mitzi was going crazy and 

3313
02:33:28,060 --> 02:33:30,720
like people were quitting whatever.
There was nonsense happening.

3314
02:33:30,721 --> 02:33:32,220
So she was like,
I need somebody in there.

3315
02:33:32,490 --> 02:33:35,480
So I was taking the vowels and stuff and
I noticed that Nick Depalo,

3316
02:33:35,650 --> 02:33:37,740
Colin the Sudanese,
live in La,

3317
02:33:38,040 --> 02:33:39,330
so I called him and I'm like,
Hey,

3318
02:33:39,331 --> 02:33:40,800
do you have any sales this week?
He goes,

3319
02:33:42,210 --> 02:33:44,310
I call it if I have avails,
you don't call me.

3320
02:33:44,310 --> 02:33:49,310
And he hung up on the ball for you and 
if it doesn't my favorite comics,

3321
02:33:51,301 --> 02:33:52,134
I would call them and see where you at 
next because I've got to close this 

3322
02:33:54,301 --> 02:33:54,660
thing.
Right.

3323
02:33:54,660 --> 02:33:55,493
Let's close it up.
I am at the comedy store July Twenty 

3324
02:33:58,651 --> 02:33:59,484
second and the 23rd and then I'm doing 
July 30th with dice at the Ford 

3325
02:34:03,361 --> 02:34:05,020
amphitheater and Kodiak Island.
Oh,

3326
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:05,993
that's going to be a big one.
I'm excited to be featuring farm there 

3327
02:34:08,710 --> 02:34:11,250
in coney island,
coney island amphitheater.

3328
02:34:12,690 --> 02:34:14,910
But luckily I'm excited at the 22nd 
23rd.

3329
02:34:15,550 --> 02:34:17,740
Who you working with down there?
I'm headlining,

3330
02:34:18,220 --> 02:34:19,053
but I mean who you work with?
Gene Pompa was on the show and I forget 

3331
02:34:22,781 --> 02:34:24,550
who else.
Terrible.

3332
02:34:25,190 --> 02:34:28,090
But I love gene Pompa London at the 
comedy store.

3333
02:34:28,630 --> 02:34:29,920
I love it.
That's awesome.

3334
02:34:29,950 --> 02:34:31,420
Congratulations.
Very exciting.

3335
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:32,680
All right folks,
that's it.

3336
02:34:32,681 --> 02:34:35,170
If you want to get a hold of eleanor and
send her pictures of your deck.

3337
02:34:35,320 --> 02:34:37,380
Oh yeah.

3338
02:34:37,420 --> 02:34:41,910
Listen to the comedy store podcast.
