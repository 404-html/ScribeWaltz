00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,140
Hello Freak bitches.
And it's been crazy,

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:06,780
but it then amazing Raj happen where I'm
at right now.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,643
Oh,
let me tell you a boy joy everywhere I 

4
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:11,680
go.
Well,

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:12,500
did you,
when did,

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,720
when did the social media thing kicking 
my nephew,

7
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,160
craig?
Shout out to Craig Brown,

8
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:20,970
let's go chat whenever you crack.
Came about four years ago.

9
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:22,980
Um,
I had my first instagram account.

10
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,300
I was like,
it was just photos then.

11
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,620
And I was like,
you know what man,

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,360
I'm gonna lose this weight.
And uh,

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,070
it sounds like a corny thing to do and 
was doing like a little blog,

14
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,770
but I'm going to just do my own,
you know,

15
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:33,570
even for myself.
And I put it up,

16
00:00:33,571 --> 00:00:36,570
I had nine followers champ and it built 
to like,

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,500
you know,
2000.

18
00:00:37,501 --> 00:00:37,951
I was like,
man,

19
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:40,320
if I can ever get the 5,000
then you know,

20
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:41,940
I'll,
I'll be there and I'm,

21
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,380
I never paid for the followers.

22
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,213
And they went to this whole thing where 
they dropped everybody with who would 

23
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:51,660
pay for the followers.
I wanted to be in like 5,000.

24
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,321
I was like,
man,

25
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,154
if I ever get the 10,000
and then they came out with the video 

26
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,720
and Craig came to town,
I was like,

27
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:57,420
Oh,
Craig,

28
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,090
I'm going work out every day and I want 
you to film it and we're gonna put it on

29
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,850
instagram and see how it goes.
And it just took off.

30
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,923
But it's just hilarious how much is 
taken out to care when I tell people 

31
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,630
that you were going to be on man,
I'm telling you like,

32
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,580
not like anybody else that's ever been 
on.

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,160
I've got a wave of people that got 
excited about it.

34
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,110
I appreciate that because they don't 
have a publicist champ.

35
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:17,400
Uh,
I do everything.

36
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:19,710
We do everything in house jam,
which is just me and Craig,

37
00:01:19,711 --> 00:01:20,580
him and off my family.

38
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,050
We do everything and we don't have any,
uh,

39
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,820
marketing behind us.
Nothing.

40
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:25,170
We just try to hit grinding.
And,

41
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:26,550
uh,
fortunately,

42
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:27,384
uh,
we've let the shot now for this wba 

43
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,190
every championship has been ordered as 
far as Brian and the team.

44
00:01:32,191 --> 00:01:33,720
They've been delaying.
Um,

45
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,390
I'm not sure if he's going to drop out 
and just give me the belt.

46
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,493
I'm not sure what's happening because 
we've been waiting for them to pull the 

47
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:40,080
trigger.
They said they were going to,

48
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:40,914
you know,
find,

49
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,310
find the venue and everything is taught.
We talked about Australia,

50
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:46,350
they talked about China.
Who's the promoter?

51
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,191
Uh,
well,

52
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:47,910
you know,
his,

53
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,920
his,
his management team and his lawyer,

54
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:52,170
Leon Michael,
Lisa handling most of it.

55
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,570
But if they don't come with the deal 
champion,

56
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,404
basically,
I already feel like everybody's scared 

57
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:56,724
of me.
So I didn't think he just gave me the 

58
00:01:57,991 --> 00:02:01,170
belt because I just want to fight 
Klitschko to be honest with you,

59
00:02:01,171 --> 00:02:04,950
cause I want to prove to the world that 
he saw for the biscuit because he really

60
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,280
is.

61
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,350
I thought his brother went on for 12 
rounds.

62
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,200
One off for 12 rounds.
This happened in the first round.

63
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,150
Joe and the first round.
Yeah,

64
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:14,460
in the first round,
not only tore the Bicep,

65
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,520
the tendon popped,
they had to go through both sides.

66
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,270
This was in the first year I took,
I took like unreal punches to the head.

67
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,820
I forgot how many number was,
but I took unreal punches to the head.

68
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,654
They left me for dad.
I ain't even get paid for the fight 

69
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,540
champ.
What happened there?

70
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:28,950
How'd you knock your parents?
Listen,

71
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,680
I started,
I started the promotional company called

72
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,813
Golden Empire.
It was basically backdoor to change to 

73
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,030
the empire.
We fought.

74
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,010
The company fell as though certain 
things that were a lot of to me,

75
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,740
I don't know.
They said I had a tab.

76
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:47,640
I don't know.
It was crazy,

77
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:49,080
but the tide was never produced.

78
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,143
Um,
the company that I started basically 

79
00:02:51,081 --> 00:02:51,914
what's in my company anymore and I was 
surprised I was supposed to be giving 

80
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:55,324
shares.
This company wound up going to try and 

81
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:00,130
trying to purchase EDC,
EDC,

82
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,770
electric,
daisy carnival to my introduction.

83
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,510
You've got crazy.
Were public.

84
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,030
The night before my fight,
the stock was up.

85
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,590
I had no shares.
I said,

86
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,200
I'm not signing nothing too.
I know I'm guaranteed a purse.

87
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,530
It was crazy chairman.
This would link to my depression.

88
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:15,940
It's why we're home after the fight and 
was like,

89
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:17,260
Yo,
what happened to you?

90
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,363
I fought.
I've taught my fourth vitaly critical 

91
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:20,980
for 12 rounds.
I took ass.

92
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,900
I ain't even get paid.
That's crazy.

93
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,793
And I was in court with them for eight 
months before I settle out on like 

94
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,904
pennies on the dollar because I had to 
take care of my family chat and this is 

95
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,654
what drove me to pure depression,
but then I overcame that and I'm here 

96
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:34,210
with you.

97
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:35,600
How much did they fuck you out of a 
chair?

98
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,180
Who knows?
Who knows?

99
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,250
I mean the fight.
This is facts.

100
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,380
This is facts jab like they say in New 
York,

101
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,490
facts,
you feel me?

102
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:45,490
Listen,
it was the highest grossing fight as far

103
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:50,491
as TV coverage and history at either one
or two in German history.

104
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,513
Shannon breeds versus fatality clinical.
He's a huge star in German and I will 

105
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,390
see you and I went over there now bought
action and the people was like,

106
00:03:58,391 --> 00:03:59,140
Yo,
listen,

107
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,420
this guy can sell.
We'd want to see this fight.

108
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,313
The ratings were unreal.
It was like the highest rating in 

109
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:05,140
history,
champ.

110
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,470
I ain't get $1.
That's so cool.

111
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,910
How can I,
how can I not fall into depression,

112
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,210
but how could I not come out of it?
I been fighting since day one channel.

113
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:23,020
I've been fighting a brief chat.
Yeah.
