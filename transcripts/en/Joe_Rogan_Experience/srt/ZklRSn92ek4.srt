00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,210
This episode of the podcast is brought 
to you by blue apron.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,450
Blue Apron is a really interesting new 
podcast sponsor at that I really enjoy 

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,220
because I like cooking,
but I've always been pretty cave man.

4
00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,200
Like in my cooking.
I don't really use recipes.

5
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:17,940
I don't.
I don't buy cookbooks.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,730
I mean I've read some recipes online for
certain things.

7
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,460
I got smoked ham before and things along
those lines.

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:28,461
It's kind of fun,
but I never really set out and cooked 

9
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:33,291
meals.
I'm under very specific or rigid 

10
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,200
instructions,
you know,

11
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:39,201
buying certain amount of recipe 
ingredients and measuring it out and 

12
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:44,481
I've never done that before.
Blue Apron and blue apron is a really 

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:49,041
unique program where they send you the 
food every week with detailed 

14
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:53,850
photographic directions.
They send you the recipe.

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,120
It's really easy to follow and it's 
delicious food.

16
00:00:57,121 --> 00:01:01,290
It's like it's like eating out at an 
interesting restaurant and you get to do

17
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,650
it yourself so you get this cool sense 
of satisfaction after it's done.

18
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,650
Here's how it works.
For $9,

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:11,660
99 per meal.
They'll send you the right ingredients 

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,511
in the exact right proportions with 
simple recipe instructions right to your

21
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:19,881
door.
Meals are between 500 and 700 calories 

22
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:23,991
per serving a,
although you really wouldn't guess it 

23
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:24,300
because they're very delicious.
Uh,

24
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:29,301
you would think that you're cheating.
A blue apron includes step by step 

25
00:01:29,301 --> 00:01:30,660
directions.
Excuse me.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,380
Blue Apron includes step by step 
instructions with pictures.

27
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:37,230
So it's really idiot proof.
I've done it.

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,320
I've made quite a few things now and I 
get new things that are delivered to me 

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,210
every week.
New lists like this week,

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,820
they have also a vegetarian options as 
well.

31
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,210
Um,
the vegetarian ones are like fresh 

32
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,210
Gnocchi with A.
I don't even know.

33
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:55,650
How do you say this kind of mushrooms?
I'm a I,

34
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,770
t k e t a k e my talky talky mushrooms 
Nokian my talky mushrooms and sweet corn

35
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:07,350
and brown butter time a pepper.

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,850
Our,
our repos,

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,420
a r e p Dot c dot.
It's all complicated.

38
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,630
Crafty food.
A chicken with candied pistachios and 

39
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:21,231
snow.
Pea Radish Saute a Indian style salmon 

40
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:25,551
with Tomato Chutney and cranberry bean 
stew blts,

41
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,780
a Hayashi Chuko cold ramen.
Chicken breast with shrimp and Grits,

42
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,990
Mexican style beef,
stuffed red bell peppers.

43
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,830
Really yummy stuff.
Really interesting stuff too.

44
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:42,840
And it's fun to cook.
It's a,

45
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:47,841
it's like a little project I do.
It takes me about half an hour for each 

46
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:48,930
meal and uh,
I enjoy it very much.

47

58
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:27,250
another one of our longstanding podcast 
sponsors that has been a.

59
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,530
I've heard nothing but positive 
responses about it.

60
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,060
A lot of people use it.
Brian Red band uses it to send all of 

61
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:38,620
his stuff from a desk squad dot TV.
A lot of our friends use stamps.com

62
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,960
because it's a really easy way to send 
packages.

63
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,290
Going to the post office can be a 
tremendous pain in the ass and with 

64
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,621
stamps.com
you can avoid that and you can print 

65
00:03:49,621 --> 00:03:50,980
official us postage directly from your 
computer,

66
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:55,270
either in your home or your office.
They provide you with a digital scale.

67
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,390
If you go to stamps.com
and click on the microphone in the upper

68
00:03:58,391 --> 00:04:01,170
right hand corner and enter in the code 
word j r e,

69
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:06,180
you will get a free digital scale and up
to $55 worth of free postage.

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,640
It's say $110 offer and when you get 
that digital scale,

71
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,190
you simply way your packages print 
official us postage with any normal 

72
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,320
computer printer.
Slap that sucker right on the box and 

73
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,840
boom,
hand it to the postman and you're done.

74
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:28,050
You don't have to deal with any of the 
nonsense that comes with going to an 

75
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,990
actual post office waiting in line.
Getting stuff measured out.

76
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Stamps.com
is more powerful than a poet postage 

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,020
meter and just a fraction of the cost of
it.

78
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,440
You will save up to 80 percent compared 
to a postage meter.

79
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,540
I'll say that again because you're not 
going to believe it.

80
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,110
You can save up to 80 percent compared 
to a postage meter.

81
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:49,111
That's true and you avoid all the time 
consuming trips to the post office.

00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:00,271

90
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:20,710
postage and a digital scale that you're 
not supposed to use for mushrooms are.

91
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,890
We don't use them.
And last but not least,

92
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,050
we are brought to you by [inaudible] dot
com.

93
00:05:26,051 --> 00:05:29,350
That is o n n I t,
if you have not heard on it,

94
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:32,020
has the latest and greatest in our 
kettlebell series.

95
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,940
This,
uh,

96
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,140
the new ones are called the legend 
kettle bells.

97
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:35,950
Um,
we're,

98
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,410
we're at a Zombie kettlebells for now,
getting them in,

99
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,450
but we now have the Werewolf and the 
Werewolf is a pretty dope delicious.

100
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,210
And uh,
it is 62 pounds.

101
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,750
All of the kettlebells that we have,
the artistic kettlebells,

102
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,950
they are all three d balanced.

103
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,970
And what that means by 3d balances,
they look cool,

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,510
but they're also balanced correctly.
Uh,

105
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,820
you don't want anything to be weighted 
too heavily on one side.

106
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:06,740
And that way it sort of defeats the 
whole purpose of making a Kettlebell.

107
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,760
They also have extra large handles for 
enhanced grip strength.

108
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,210
I can't say it enough.
I am a huge fan of working out with 

109
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,691
kettlebells is the main method that I 
use for strength and conditioning 

110
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:19,691
training.
And,

111
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:21,870
uh,
it's benefited true me tremendously.

112
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,050
Uh,
what they are is they're essentially 

113
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,570
these giant balls of iron with these 
huge metal handles,

114
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,080
these iron handles,
and you swing them around and uh,

115
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,140
in doing so,
it promotes what they call functional 

116
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,661
strength.
We have several workout dvds that are 

117
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:44,621
also for sale at [inaudible] dot com and
not just a dvds for kettlebells,

a dvds for steel mace workouts,

119
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,310
dvds,
uh,

120
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,320
for,
um,

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,330
just all sorts of different body weight 
training exercises as well.

122
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,840
We have a huge selection now and 
including my favorite,

123
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:07,130
which is the extreme kettlebell cardio 
workout DVD,

124
00:07:07,131 --> 00:07:12,131

extreme to Kettlebell cardio workout 

125
00:07:12,131 --> 00:07:16,811
DVD,
which is the latest and greatest by 

126
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:16,811
Keith Weber who will be on the show next
month.

127
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,850
We also have a wide variety of 
supplements and foods,

128
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,900
foods including hemp force protein,
a earth grown nutrients,

129
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:28,901
which is an excellent supplement to add 
to your morning shake to ensure you're 

130
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:33,401
getting your daily amount of Greens.
Really a super healthy stuff with 

131
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:37,520
antioxidants,
a powerful Greens from both land and the

132
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,540
sea,
wheat grass,

133
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,920
barley grass,
oat grass,

134
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:40,910
Kale,
kelp,

135
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,740
all sorts of different stuff.
Spirulina,

136
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,040
Alfalfa,
um,

137
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:47,510
just the idea behind it.
Just getting as many nutrients into your

138
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:50,000
body as you can,
especially earth grown nutrients.

139
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:51,710
Really healthy,
natural,

140
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:55,790
easy for your body to digest.
I'm with five major components.

141
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,770
All have it listed at [inaudible] dot 
com.

142
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,890
And the other things long.
The food lines are the warrior bar,

143
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:05,660
which is another big favorite of mine,
which is natural organic buffalo meat.

144
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
No antibiotics,
no added hormones.

145
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:11,540
It's Buffalo Meat Preston,
an ancient lakota recipe,

146
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,860
um,
with,

147
00:08:12,861 --> 00:08:13,700
uh,
no,

148
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,110
no added preservatives.
The way,

149
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:20,111
the way it's done as the same way they 
used to do it probably more than a 

150
00:08:20,111 --> 00:08:24,230
thousand years ago.
It has only 140 calories,

151
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,610
but with 14 grams of protein and four 
grams of fat for every two ounce serving

152
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:31,400
very healthy and it doesn't feel,
you know,

153
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:36,401
you can satisfy your cravings and your 
hunger and you don't feel like a dummy 

154
00:08:36,401 --> 00:08:38,450
for doing so.
Go to [inaudible] dot com o n n it,

155
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:43,451
and use the Codeword Rogan and you will 
save 10 percent off any and all 

156
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:45,500
supplements.
We are a human optimization website and,

157
00:08:45,501 --> 00:08:50,501
uh,
even if you don't go to on it and 

158
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:52,511
purchase things,
there's just a huge source of 

159
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:57,360
interesting stuff at the onnit academy.
I'm lots of fantastic workouts that you 

160
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:00,510
can check out and a lot of inspirational
stuff.

161
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:03,480
Great articles.
The onnit academy is one of the,

162
00:09:03,481 --> 00:09:06,090
uh,
the newest and expanding forms,

163
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,610
a add on it,
not expanding forums,

164
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:12,840
but forums at onnit pages at onnit.
Lots of really cool stuff there,

165
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,970
um,
that you have that you could go there 

166
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:17,970
and just get it for free,
but if you want to buy anything used the

167
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,210
cohort Rogan and you'll save 10 percent 
off any and all supplements.

168
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,040
All right.
Rupert sheldrake is here.

169
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,630
Cue The music.
Young James.

170
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,930
Yeah,

171
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,490
the Joe Rogan experience.

172
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,870
Joe Rogan podcast.

173
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
Thank you very patients.
Rupert,

174
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,850
Rupert Sheldrake,
Ladies and gentlemen.

175
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,440
Uh,
I've,

176
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:40,850
uh,
I,

177
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,390
I came to know of you through the trial 
logs that you did with Terence Mckenna,

178
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,580
who I'm a huge fan of.
And Ralph Abraham,

179
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and I thought they were some really 
fascinating conversations and you know,

180
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:58,040
all terrence's mp3s are very,
very thought inspiring and made you 

181
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:03,591
really like look at things from a very 
different in peculiar angle that he had 

182
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:08,571
a,
he had a very unique way of looking at 

183
00:10:08,571 --> 00:10:10,221
the world.
But I came to know of you from that and 

184
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,600
I came to know of your ideas of morphic 
resonance,

185
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,900
which I found to be really fascinating.
And if you don't mind just explain to 

186
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,230
folks at home listening what the concept
of morphic resonance is.

187
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,910
It's the idea of memory in nature.
The idea that the whole universe has a 

188
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:31,350
kind of memory to so called laws of 
nature are more like habits.

189
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,640
Each individual in this species draws on
a collective memory and contributes to 

190
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:41,520
it.
It works on the base of similarity.

191
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Any pattern of activity similar to a 
later pattern of activity in a self 

192
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:50,670
organizing system influences it across 
space and time.

193
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,540
So what it means in effect is that if 
you train rats to learn a new trick in 

194
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,101
Los Angeles and rats in New York and 
Sydney and London will learn the same 

195
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:05,601
thing quicker,
straight away at the sanctuary evidence 

196
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:10,161
that this surprising effect happens if 
you crystallize a new chemical that's 

197
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:14,571
never existed before,
and then after you've made him one 

198
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:19,401
place,
it should get easier to Christianize or 

199
00:11:19,401 --> 00:11:22,250
all over the world.
So it's really a theory of habit and 

200
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,451
memory and um,
it enables new patterns of learning to 

201
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:27,990
spread quicker than they might otherwise
do.

202
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,470
And it means that it should get easier 
to learn things that other people have 

203
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:33,470
already learned.

204
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,810
So this has been proven,
this,

205
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:39,840
this concept of rats being able to learn
one thing in New York a quicker because 

206
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,130
they learned it already in San 
Francisco.

207
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,580
Yes.
I mean it wasn't done to test morphic 

208
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:46,580
resonance,
which is still very controversial.

209
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,510
It was done to test something else.
It was done in,

210
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,170
in years ago before the Second World 
War.

211
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,620
A professor at Harvard called William 
McDougall wanted to find out if rats 

212
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,620
could learn quicker what their parents 
had learned.

213
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,860
So he trained these rats to escape from 
the water maze.

214
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:05,800
They had to swim.
If they went out the wrong exit,

215
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:08,830
they got an electric shock and if they 
weren't at the right exit,

216
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,890
which was the wrong one,
was lit up with a light.

217
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,040
The other one was dim.
If they went out the right exit,

218
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:20,150
they just escaped from the maze and he 
tested them to see how many trials 

219
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,890
they've made before they learned,
always go out of the DMX.

220
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,890
It.
And the first generation took about 250 

221
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:30,460
trials before they cottoned onto what 
was happening.

222
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,120
The next generation,
it was about 180 trials.

223
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:36,160
The next generation,
about 150,

224
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,620
they got better and better.
And,

225
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:44,340
and he thought at first this was because
there was something being passed on to 

226
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:48,790
the children may be through modifying 
the jeans or something like that,

227
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,430
an inheritance for client characters.
That was a kind of taboo in 20th century

228
00:12:54,431 --> 00:12:55,530
science.
Um,

229
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,350
and so people questioned his work,
but because he was at Harvard and 

230
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:03,100
because he was a famous professor,
um,

231
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,520
they couldn't just dismiss it,
he showed a huge effect.

232
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Um,
so people tried repeating his work in 

233
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,030
the University of Edinburgh,
Scotland and Melbourne,

234
00:13:13,031 --> 00:13:18,031
Australia,
and they found that there at started 

235
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:21,991
more or less where the Harvard rats had 
left off and in Melbourne they did an 

236
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:24,460
experiment that was particularly 
interesting.

237
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,760
They went on getting better,
the ones that were descended from the 

238
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,180
train parents in each generation,
but they found that all rats of that 

239
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,831
breed,
even if their parents had never been 

240
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:37,831
trained,
we're getting better too.

241
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:40,540
So whatever it was,
it wasn't something to do with modifying

242
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:43,780
the genes or what people would now call 
epigenetics.

243
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:49,200
There was something else,
much more mysterious going on and since 

244
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,220
no one knew what it was,
uh,

245
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,490
it was just ignored and forgotten.

246
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,100
That is really fascinating.
So that would kind of make sense that 

247
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:03,170
if,
if somehow or another the jeans or 

248
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:07,691
whatever that is in the rat is able to 
communicate with other of the same 

249
00:14:07,941 --> 00:14:12,941
species over the,
have a similar genetics of whatever it 

250
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:16,121
is that they're doing,
whatever undefined thing that they're 

251
00:14:16,121 --> 00:14:18,761
doing,
connecting with them even across 

252
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:19,610
continents,
across the other side of the planet.

253
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,260
Yes.
Wow.

254
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,580
That's right.
And so the same mood.

255
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:27,770
I think the same happens in evolution 
naturally in nature.

256
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:33,780
There was a famous case with um,
birds called blue tits and England and 

257
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,640
America,
you call them chickadees,

258
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,660
put that in the 19 twenties,
started rating milk bottles in Britain 

259
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,660
we had then.
And we still have a system where you get

260
00:14:44,661 --> 00:14:49,661
fresh milk delivered to your doorstep 
everyday in a bottle and then they wash 

261
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:50,660
the bottles and use them as a great 
system.

262
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:53,870
We have right now in London.
Um,

263
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,150
so in the 19,
20 years they had caught,

264
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,830
bought tops on these bottles and someone
gnosis in Southampton,

265
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,850
the cream at the top of their bottle had
disappeared.

266
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,090
The top had been tornado and the cream 
of disappeared.

267
00:15:07,091 --> 00:15:12,091
And when they watched,
they sold that every morning these 

268
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:14,680
pollutants in Southampton had figured 
out they could tear off this cardboard 

269
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,010
strip and get free cream every morning.

270
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,600
And then everyone sort of interested in 
this.

271
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,720
Then it turned up many,
many miles away in another part of 

272
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,290
Britain and it turned up somewhere else.
Bluetooth's don't fly very far.

273
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:31,070
Their home loving birds and they don't 
migrate.

274
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,330
So,
um,

275
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:37,690
scientists got interested and they set 
up a network all over Britain of people 

276
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:39,500
to observe this habit.
And they got reports.

277
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:44,120
It was coordinated from Cambridge 
University and they mapped the spread of

278
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:49,121
the habit and it became clear that it 
was spreading faster and faster and it 

279
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:52,610
was being independently invest in,
invented in other parts of Britain.

280
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,300
So much so that the professor of biology
at Oxford surrenders to hardy,

281
00:15:57,301 --> 00:16:02,301
suggested it must be happening by 
telepathy and that it was spreading too 

282
00:16:02,301 --> 00:16:06,881
quickly.
And the most interesting records from 

283
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,360
Holland because this started happening 
in Holland as well.

284
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,930
And during the war,
Holland was occupied by the Germans and 

285
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,300
milk deliveries stopped.

286
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:18,050
They didn't start again until about 
1948,

287
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,710
but seven or eight years after they 
stopped Bluetooth's only live three or 

288
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,251
four years.
So there would've been no bluetooth's 

289
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,310
after the war that remembered the golden
age of free cream.

290
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:29,780
Um,
so,

291
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,930
um,
when they milk deliveries began again in

292
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:37,931
Holland,
they started drinking the cream almost 

293
00:16:37,931 --> 00:16:38,270
straightaway,
all over Holland.

294
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:42,920
So I would say this is a kind of 
collective memory that spread by morphic

295
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:45,530
resonance and was remembered by morphic 
resonance.

296
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Um,
and that's another example of this going

297
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:51,950
on in the real world.
Incidentally,

298
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,080
I'm,
they've now stopped doing it.

299
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:59,081
They used to steal our cream in London 
until about 10 years ago when we 

300
00:16:59,081 --> 00:17:02,930
switched to semi skimmed milk.
There isn't any cream on bottles of semi

301
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:07,931
skimmed milk and Bluetooth's have more 
or less given up in Britain because 70 

302
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:08,450
people have switched to semi skimmed 
milk.

303
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,940
They don't get any cream.
It's not worth the effort.

304
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,700
So I'm at the habits died out.

305
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,320
That's pretty fascinating.
The idea that human beings start off as 

306
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:25,861
a blank slate has really been questioned
quite a bit over the last generation and

307
00:17:28,211 --> 00:17:33,211
a genetics in particular.
They're starting to understand that 

308
00:17:33,211 --> 00:17:36,601
there's certain particular traits and 
memories that you can actually learn 

309
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:40,591
from your parents.
Like there was one study they did with 

310
00:17:40,591 --> 00:17:42,571
mice where they had taken mice and they 
had given them an electric shock and 

311
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,680
coincided that electric shock with the 
smell of citrus hill.

312
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,940
There was electric shock and their feet.
Are you aware of this test?

313
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:49,680
Yes,
I am.

314
00:17:49,681 --> 00:17:53,460
It was published in nature with a 
provocative title,

315
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:56,940
inheriting the fears of fathers.
It's a very,

316
00:17:56,941 --> 00:17:59,850
very fascinating study.
Amazing staff.

317
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:03,430
I mean that I think could be partly due 
to morphic resonance,

318
00:18:03,431 --> 00:18:05,900
so have you explained it to people 
before?

319
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:08,070
I might have,
but please do.

320
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:13,650
Well,
what they did was they used a chemical 

321
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:16,350
synthetic chemical called acetone for 
known that smells sort of vaguely 

322
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,030
fruity,
but it's something that mice would never

323
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:23,031
have encountered in nature because it's 
a synthetic chemical and they took male 

324
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:27,831
mice and expose them to smell of acetone
who known and they gave them a mild 

325
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:31,860
electric shock on their poor when they 
smelled this stuff.

326
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Um,
and the result is classical Pavlovian 

327
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:37,500
conditioning,
you know,

328
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,340
a few times of that happening as soon as
they smelled acetone now.

329
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,360
And they were terrified.
I'm perfectly standard stuff in science.

330
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,200
What wasn't standard was the then bread 
from these mice and they did some of the

331
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:57,201
experiments using artificial 
insemination so that the mothers never 

332
00:18:57,201 --> 00:18:59,010
even met the fathers of the next 
generation.

333
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,700
And then they tested their children and 
their grandchildren and whenever they 

334
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,420
smelt acetone for known,
they were just paralyzed with fear.

335
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,670
So the inherited the fear of this 
chemical in a single generation,

336
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:17,020
um,
in a way that regular science simply 

337
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,330
can't explain.
Um,

338
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,510
and this went far beyond anything anyone
would have expected.

339
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,740
There's evidence from the details of the
experiments that involved some changes 

340
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:31,731
in the sperm,
some change in the genes or the 

341
00:19:31,731 --> 00:19:33,090
epigenetics,
which is the packaging if the genes,

342
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,380
but no one can conceive how a mouse 
learning to avoid this smell and being 

343
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:45,861
frightened by it all that they were,
knows how all that information could be 

344
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:46,920
transferred into genes and the sperm.

345
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:51,450
So I think at least part of the 
explanation of this is morphic resonance

346
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:56,451
that if you make some animals adverse to
something,

347
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:58,680
then they're deciding,
well,

348
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:02,340
other animals have the same kind will be
frightened of it.

349
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I did a very similar experiments 
actually years ago with a skeptical 

350
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,980
scientist in Britain called Steven rose.
Um,

351
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,610
we had a controversy in the Guardian 
newspaper.

352
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,340
I wrote her.
I used to write a column in the Guardian

353
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,840
and I wrote a thing about the nature of 
memory and how morphic resonance helps 

354
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,380
to explain it.
We can discuss that later if you'd like,

355
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:30,381
but that rose was outraged by this.
He'd spent his whole career working on 

356
00:20:30,381 --> 00:20:35,301
memory saying must be inside the brain.
And he worked with day old chicks and in

357
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:42,051
the Guardian he wrote a response to my 
article and challenged me to do an 

358
00:20:42,051 --> 00:20:46,491
experiment in his laboratory under his 
supervision to test what he called this 

359
00:20:46,491 --> 00:20:48,220
seemingly absurd hypothesis.

360
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,650
Um,
well,

361
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,590
uh,
what the,

362
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,600
the experiment we did,
we had dale chicks and Dale chicks peck 

363
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,080
at anything bright.
So we had them packet silvery bead work.

364
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,090
And after the silverbeet they're 
injected with saline solution is just a 

365
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:09,090
control.
They,

366
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:12,730
they didn't feel early.
Everything was fine.

367
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:18,210
We also had them pack at a yellow light 
emitting diode and after they'd packed 

368
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,580
at that,
the checks that had packed at the yellow

369
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:25,990
light emitting diode were injected with 
something that made them feel sick.

370
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,330
Lithium chloride,
I think it was,

371
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,740
it made them feel sick.
It didn't kill me,

372
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,190
it just made them feel ill.
And you know,

373
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,960
if you ever eat anything and you feel 
sick after it,

374
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,990
you,
you never want to eat that thing again.

375
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,040
It's,
it's a,

376
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,930
it's called conditioned to Vashon.
And so these checks,

377
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,730
when you tested them a day or two later,
they would avoid yellow lights,

378
00:21:48,731 --> 00:21:52,450
but they'd pack at the chrome bead,
the silverbeet,

379
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:56,770
which hadn't made them sick and that's 
straightforward.

380
00:21:56,770 --> 00:22:00,170
They learned to avoid it.
But what I predicted was that in,

381
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:05,230
so we,
if we did the experiment over and over 

382
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,471
again,
every day we get a new batch of fresh 

383
00:22:07,471 --> 00:22:10,081
chicks and test them with the yellow,
a light emitting diode and the chrome 

384
00:22:10,181 --> 00:22:11,270
bead.
Um,

385
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:16,210
I predicted that they'd start avoiding 
the yellow light emitting diode.

386
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,530
Um,
but not the chrome bead,

387
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:22,960
because of the influence by morphic 
resonance from previous checks.

388
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:28,140
They'd start avoiding it even before 
they'd been made of us to it for the 

389
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,870
first time they were exposed to it.
They,

390
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,480
they wouldn't go for it,
they'd,

391
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,470
they'd be more wary of it.
And that's exactly what happened in this

392
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:36,780
experiment.
Um,

393
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:42,780
so this is actually something that's 
well known in the rat poison industry.

394
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,480
I mean,
most people haven't spent much time 

395
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,450
looking into the rat poison industry and
how it works.

396
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,450
But one thing that happens to people who
try to poison rats for a living is that 

397
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,560
if you try some new kind of bait with a 
particular flavor,

398
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:04,180
I'm rats eat it and they get sick and 
they die.

399
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,180
Um,
but it works for awhile.

400
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,610
But after awhile,
rat start avoiding it.

401
00:23:09,611 --> 00:23:12,220
They become what's called in the trade 
bait shy,

402
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,830
um,
and not just in one place,

403
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,400
but the bait stops working,
you know,

404
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,640
miles and miles away.
So you have to keep inventing new bates.

405
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:27,630
That's why most rat poison,
no is based on warfare in which causes 

406
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,800
bleeding,
um,

407
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,830
thins the blood and causes bleeding.
And it doesn't usually affect the rats 

408
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,701
for days after they've eaten it.
They don't associate it with any 

409
00:23:38,701 --> 00:23:40,930
particular flavor because it's slow,
slow acting.

410
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:46,320
That's why people have had to switch to 
Warfarin as the main rat poison because 

411
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,100
this aversion to things that poison 
became so strong and to something that 

412
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,730
actually some people who are listening 
to us might know about,

413
00:23:55,731 --> 00:24:00,731
which I heard from a guy in America who 
fishes for Bass and he was telling me 

414
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:06,860
there's a constant development of new 
lawyers for bass fishing.

415
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:07,740
I do do,
do,

416
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,830
do,
do fish quite a bit.

417
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:14,890
Yes.
Well apparently people are always 

418
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,660
inventing new lawyers that worked very 
well for awhile and apparently then they

419
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:22,010
stopped working and not just in one 
place but elsewhere.

420
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:24,320
So it was a constant development of new 
lawyers.

421
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,140
Now,
if that could be documented,

422
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,420
um,
that might be another very interesting 

423
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,691
case of morphic resonance.
If Bass keep getting caught and they're 

424
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:37,160
in pain when they're caught by being 
finished with a particular kind of Leer,

425
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,230
then other bass later evening,
different rivers or lakes,

426
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,070
um,
uh,

427
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,150
when they see that,
you know,

428
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,290
it would be more averse to biting it.
So it stops working.

429
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:51,740
So I think there could be many examples 
of this.

430
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,520
I'm out there in the real world.
When did you come up with this concept?

431
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,710
Is this your concept,
the concept of morphic resonance?

432
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,790
Resonance?
Yes.

433
00:24:58,790 --> 00:24:59,360
Yes.
I,

434
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,260
I came up with this in 1973,
long time ago.

435
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,220
I was doing research at Cambridge 
University on plant development,

436
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:12,850
how plants grow and I became convinced 
for a variety of reasons that,

437
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:19,290
um,
the attempt to explain the whole thing 

438
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,620
just in terms of genes and molecules and
proteins wouldn't work.

439
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,370
Um,
I was at the very leading edge of this.

440
00:25:25,371 --> 00:25:30,371
I mean the main plant hormone is called 
Oxen Aux Ian and I figured out how it's 

441
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:34,070
made and then I figured out how it's 
transplanted,

442
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,220
transported around the plant and this 
was a massive advance and this is kind 

443
00:25:40,551 --> 00:25:42,410
of textbook stuff now in,
in,

444
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:45,380
in school,
in University of textbooks,

445
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,780
the mechanism of polar oxygen transport.
So having figured all that out,

446
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:57,520
I then realized this wasn't enough to 
explain plants because all plants have 

447
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:03,071
the same hormone and it's moved in the 
same way in every plant and it's moved 

448
00:26:03,071 --> 00:26:04,850
to the same way and petals and leaves 
and stems and roots.

449
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,990
And it's moved to the same way in palms 
and cabbages and roses,

450
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:14,290
and yet they're all different.
So I got interested in something in 

451
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:19,000
biology called morphogenetic fields,
the idea of invisible fields,

452
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:24,001
the shape living organisms.
So there's like an invisible mold as a 

453
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:28,901
flower grows,
it's kind of invisible mold that shapes 

454
00:26:28,901 --> 00:26:32,180
the way the petals develop and the 
flower develops or as a leaf grows,

455
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:35,840
that's kind of invisible mold for that 
leaf called the morphogenetic field,

456
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:40,340
like a kind of an invisible plan.
This idea was not invented by me,

457
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:43,440
it had been around in biology since the 
19 years,

458
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,550
but the key thing was to understand how 
these fields could be inherited.

459
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,040
And I was sure it wouldn't go through 
the jeans,

460
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:51,930
the jeans,
just code for proteins.

461
00:26:51,931 --> 00:26:54,270
So they had to be some other kind of 
inheritance.

462
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,630
How could it work?
And I was wrestling with this idea in 

463
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:01,590
Cambridge and then the idea of morphic 
resonance came to me.

464
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,770
If you have a resonance across time 
between similar things,

465
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:10,100
you could explain this inheritance of 
form and have instincts in animals in a 

466
00:27:10,531 --> 00:27:14,040
non-genetic way,
which would give a completely new way of

467
00:27:14,041 --> 00:27:18,870
understanding biology and inheritance.
I then realized that this would apply to

468
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:22,500
learning and memory and many aspects of 
human behavior.

469
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,620
So I wrote this up in a book called a 
new science of life,

470
00:27:25,621 --> 00:27:30,390
which was published in 1981.
It took me years to think this through.

471
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,580
I realized that it would be 
controversial.

472
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Um,
so I had to be very sure of myself 

473
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,881
before I could write about it.
Then I wrote another book called the 

474
00:27:40,881 --> 00:27:44,271
presence of the past which puts the 
theory forward in its fullest form.

475
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:50,631
And that's my main theoretical book and 
since then I've really been trying to 

476
00:27:50,631 --> 00:27:52,170
develop these ideas,
test them,

477
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:53,880
do experiments and so on.
Anyway,

478
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:58,881
it was my idea in the first place and 
since then it's become widely discussed 

479
00:27:58,881 --> 00:27:59,790
in many areas.

480
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,680
And when you say that you,
um,

481
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,160
had to be sure of it,
what did you do that made you sure of 

482
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,160
it?
I mean,

483
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,590
what is a,
what,

484
00:28:07,591 --> 00:28:12,591
what kind of testing have you done to 
sort of hammer out this concept of 

485
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:15,630
morphic residence?
Well,

486
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:17,790
there were two aspects to being sure 
about it.

487
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,210
The,
the main objection that I got from my 

488
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,480
colleagues and in the scientific world,
especially in biology,

489
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,990
um,
was not that they not.

490
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,730
What's the evidence?
They didn't say,

491
00:28:29,731 --> 00:28:34,731
what's the evidence they just said this 
idea is unnecessary because we're going 

492
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,020
to figure everything out in terms of 
genes and molecular biology.

493
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,520
Um,
so one line of research I had to do was 

494
00:28:43,261 --> 00:28:47,760
to see whether the conventional approach
in biology was likely to work or not.

495
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:53,310
Um,
and so I had to think really deep about 

496
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,440
standard science.
Um,

497
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,100
is this going to work it,
they just said,

498
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:56,760
give us time.

499
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,130
We'll figure it all that we don't need 
new ideas.

500
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,070
We basically,
everything's fine the way it is.

501
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:07,760
And that's what led in the 19 eighties 
to people formulating the human genome 

502
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,201
project and um,
which culminated in the year 2000 with 

503
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:17,151
the publication of the human genome.
So they thought that that was adequate 

504
00:29:17,151 --> 00:29:18,540
to explain.
Once they got into the human genome,

505
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:19,800
once they mapped it out,
that was going to,

506
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,230
they're going to be able explain pretty 
much everything about human being.

507
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,090
That's right.
They actually thought that.

508
00:29:24,091 --> 00:29:26,250
And that's why there was a huge 
investment.

509
00:29:26,251 --> 00:29:31,251
Hundreds of billions of dollars were 
invested in genomics and biotechnology 

510
00:29:31,251 --> 00:29:33,060
on the grounds that gene's explain 
everything.

511
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:38,390
One Gene,
one characteristic does a gene for 

512
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,421
everything.
If you can figure out the genes and 

513
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:42,010
manipulate the genes,
basically you can control life.

514
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:45,190
And if you can own the genes or own 
patients on the jeans,

515
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,780
you can make billions of dollars.

516
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,170
That was the thinking and that was 
almost everybody was into that.

517
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:53,680
But I was convinced that genes were 
grossly overrated,

518
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,040
that they couldn't do most of these 
things that people thought they could.

519
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Um,
because what genes do is code for the 

520
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,731
sequence of amino acids in proteins,
protein molecules which make up our 

521
00:30:05,731 --> 00:30:09,700
muscles and you know,
the blood cells and they're the enzymes.

522
00:30:09,701 --> 00:30:11,440
And so on,
a major part of life.

523
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,880
Um,
I'm a coded for by genes,

524
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:21,450
but there's a huge difference between 
making the right proteins and the shape 

525
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:21,760
of your nose,
for example,

526
00:30:21,761 --> 00:30:24,100
or the instincts of a spider to spin a 
web.

527
00:30:24,101 --> 00:30:25,030
I mean,
it's,

528
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,950
it's like saying you could explain the 
structure of the building by knowing the

529
00:30:29,951 --> 00:30:34,951
chemistry of the bricks.
I mean you have to have breaks and you 

530
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:35,650
have to have cement and timber and stuff
to make a building.

531
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,400
Um,
and if you have defective bricks,

532
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:43,410
you get a defective building,
but it doesn't explain the plan of the 

533
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:43,410
building,
the shape of the building.

534
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,720
So I was convinced that these things 
would never be explained by genes that 

535
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,491
we needed something like morphogenetic 
fields and morphic resonance to explain 

536
00:30:53,491 --> 00:30:58,381
them.
So part of thinking about this was 

537
00:30:58,381 --> 00:31:01,570
thinking hard about what regular science
coach and could not achieve.

538
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,380
And incidentally,
I'll come to the evidence in a minute,

539
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:06,350
but the,
um,

540
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,610
one of my predictions that there's 
biotechnology thing would be a disaster.

541
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:15,940
It would mean people lose huge amounts 
of money.

542
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,460
I advised my friends if they are 
investors,

543
00:31:18,461 --> 00:31:20,720
just don't bother,
you know,

544
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:25,800
the only way you make money in this is 
by getting in on the bubble and selling 

545
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,311
art in time because it's not really 
going to lead to that many useful 

546
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:29,311
product.
Why are you so convinced?

547
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,910
Because I thought that the role of genes
was totally overrated and um,

548
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,480
this is in fact what's happened.
Were you alone in this or were there 

549
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:39,480
some,
a few people.

550
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,500
There are a few people,
but most people went along with this,

551
00:31:41,501 --> 00:31:43,930
you know,
it's interesting.

552
00:31:43,931 --> 00:31:47,890
You see that the human genome project,
they expected they'd have about 100,000

553
00:31:47,891 --> 00:31:52,891
genes that turned out when they finally 
announced that there were only about 

554
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:53,500
20,000
genes,

555
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,350
we have less genes in the Seattle region
and about half as many as a rice plant.

556
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:05,370
That was a huge surprise to people and 
it soon became clear that it wasn't 

557
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:07,870
going to deliver on most of these 
promises.

558
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:13,000
Craig venter,
who had the private genome project,

559
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:15,400
which was a rival of the publicly funded
one.

560
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,240
He's in a very,
very competitive guy.

561
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,900
Got He got there first.
You know,

562
00:32:22,901 --> 00:32:25,630
he saw it as a race and he was going to 
win and he did.

563
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,970
Um,
and uh,

564
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,200
even though he was technically very 
successful and the publicly funded 

565
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,740
genome project was technically 
successful,

566
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:41,190
once they'd done it,
it became immediately apparent this 

567
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,860
information was almost useless.
And Craig venter's,

568
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:49,060
his company is Celera genomics.
The shares collapsed in a few days from 

569
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,920
about $60 a share to about twelve cents 
a share.

570
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,880
And when he was interviewed after that,
he said he's got a great sense of humor.

571
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,960
He said,
he said,

572
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,140
I'm a guy who's made a million the hard 
way by working my way down from a 

573
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,140
billion.

574
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,920
The thing is,
it didn't work.

575
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,850
And yeah,
in around four or five years ago,

576
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:16,910
um,
there was a development in science that 

577
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:16,910
most people haven't heard of yet outside
science,

578
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,771
but it's really big within the 
scientific journals called the missing 

579
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:25,611
heritability problem at.
What they did is they took the genomes 

580
00:33:25,611 --> 00:33:30,111
of 30,000
different people because it's quite 

581
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:32,211
cheap now to sequence genomes sequenced 
about 30,000

582
00:33:32,341 --> 00:33:36,570
genomes.
And to figure out what genes do what you

583
00:33:36,571 --> 00:33:39,810
know,
they looked at the people,

584
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,840
30,000
people that they knew everything about 

585
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:44,840
their height,
their diseases history and so forth.

586
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,580
They started with height [inaudible] 
heights,

587
00:33:47,581 --> 00:33:52,581
easy to measure.
You just need a tape measure and it's 

588
00:33:52,581 --> 00:33:53,580
already known that tall parents tend to 
have taught children in short,

589
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:58,581
parents tend to have short children.
You can predict the height of children 

590
00:33:58,581 --> 00:34:02,451
when they're grown on the basis of the 
parent's height with an accuracy of 

591
00:34:02,451 --> 00:34:02,451
about 80 percent.

592
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,910
And in the technical language,
they say height is 80 percent heritable.

593
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Well,
they'd figured out that the genes 

594
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,900
complete genome of 30,000
different people.

595
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:21,260
They knew their height,
so they then ran all these correlations 

596
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,190
and statistics to figure out which genes
are involved in height.

597
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:27,090
And they found about 50 genes are 
involved in controlling height.

598
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,810
Then they say they found some are more 
important than others.

599
00:34:30,811 --> 00:34:35,811
So they made their best models waiting 
some more than others and coming out 

600
00:34:35,811 --> 00:34:38,520
with predictions and then they picked 
some people at random.

601
00:34:38,521 --> 00:34:41,030
The genomes,
they'd did all their sums.

602
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,100
They'd identified the genes,
they ran the computer simulations,

603
00:34:44,101 --> 00:34:47,040
and they predicted these people's 
heights on the base of their genome,

604
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:51,090
and then they looked up the height to 
see how good this method was.

605
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,230
It turned out they could predict,
hiked with an accuracy of five percent.

606
00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,060
Now you can do it with an actress of 80 
percent just by using tape measures in a

607
00:35:00,061 --> 00:35:01,890
way that it's billions of dollars 
cheaper.

608
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,330
Um,
so,

609
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,880
um,
they,

610
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,780
they,
uh,

611
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,490
the,
the gap between the five percent and the

612
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:13,491
80 percent,
the 75 percent is not explained by the 

613
00:35:13,491 --> 00:35:17,001
genes,
is called the missing heritability 

614
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:19,050
problem.
And it turned out that the same was true

615
00:35:19,051 --> 00:35:22,410
of most diseases for it.
There's a few diseases where a defective

616
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:26,330
gene gives a defective protein and you 
get a clear predictive values.

617
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,520
Cystic fibrosis is one of them.
Sickle cell anemia is another.

618
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,760
So there's a few rare genetic diseases 
where this method works very well,

619
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,690
but for most diseases,
breast,

620
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,410
cardiac problems,
the predictive value of the GE name 

621
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:43,290
turned out to be only five to 10 
percent.

622
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
And all these companies sprang up that 
would offer to sequence people's 

623
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:54,681
genomes.
And predict their diseases and the last 

624
00:35:54,681 --> 00:35:54,681
one,
23 and me,

625
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,430
it was put out of business by the FDA,
uh,

626
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:02,070
just a few months ago because they're 
advertising was misleading.

627
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,150
They,
they cannot predict with more than about

628
00:36:06,151 --> 00:36:11,151
10 percent accuracy the likelihood that 
you'll get a particular gi disease on 

629
00:36:12,361 --> 00:36:15,420
the base of the genome,
except for these rare genetic disorders.

630
00:36:15,421 --> 00:36:20,421
So this company,
their entire business model was 

631
00:36:20,421 --> 00:36:21,420
predicting people's vulnerability to 
certain diseases.

632
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:23,520
I think that was their main business 
model.

633
00:36:23,521 --> 00:36:28,521
I mean there are certain things where 
genome sequencing is still valuable and 

634
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:28,521
used,
you know,

635
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:31,380
if you want,
find out what your racial background is,

636
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,150
you know,
where did your ancestors come from?

637
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:36,120
It's really good for that.
And it has very useful information.

638
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,780
I'm not saying this is useless,
I'm saying it's,

639
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:44,090
it has limited uses,
but nothing like the bonanza of profits 

640
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:48,741
that people were expecting.
There was a report by the Harvard 

641
00:36:48,741 --> 00:36:52,260
Business School on this a few years ago 
on the biotech business and they said no

642
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:57,270
one had ever invented such a massive 
money losing scheme in the history of 

643
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:57,420
humanity.

644
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,500
So I think that's because it was based 
on a false assumption of what genes do 

645
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,290
is.
That's fascinating.

646
00:37:04,291 --> 00:37:09,291
What is the,
when when people hear about the 

647
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:09,291
experiment with the,
uh,

648
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:09,870
the mice and the smell,
what's the smell?

649
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,940
Call again?
The acetone,

650
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,380
acetone.
What's the conventional explanation for 

651
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,380
this?
Uh,

652
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,940
this memory being passed down into these
animals that have never experienced that

653
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,090
before,
through,

654
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,550
through breeding.
Well,

655
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:25,520
there isn't really one you see because 
the,

656
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,590
the,
it's something that Peter has rightly 

657
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:33,220
surprised about because the idea that 
you could actually do that,

658
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,960
you could give off the brain or of the 
nose or could actually give off 

659
00:37:39,181 --> 00:37:44,181
influences that travel through the blood
and selectively modify sperm changing 

660
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,300
genes or the packaging of jeans.
Nothing like that had been contemplated 

661
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:55,461
before.
And this suggests something going is 

662
00:37:55,461 --> 00:37:56,580
going on that regular science doesn't 
know about.

663
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,500
And that's fine from the point of view 
of science.

664
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,500
I mean if you discover something new,
then you have to try and figure out how 

665
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:03,570
it works,
but no one really knows.

666
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:07,890
And this sort of pushes molecular 
biology beyond its limits really.

667
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,200
And people are working on this now and 
trying to figure out how it could 

668
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,190
happen.
What are the conventional theories is,

669
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:15,090
are there any.
Well,

670
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:20,091
there aren't really,
I mean no one knows how I'm smelling 

671
00:38:20,091 --> 00:38:23,721
something could affect genes or the 
packaging of jeans.

672
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,540
Um,
and even if they could even,

673
00:38:27,541 --> 00:38:32,541
if you could say there'd be a 
modification of the sperm to make 

674
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:32,940
people.
Most of the offspring,

675
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:37,390
the mice that descend from those sperm 
more sensitive to Acetate for noon.

676
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,390
That doesn't necessarily explain why 
they'd be afraid of it.

677
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:42,520
I mean it,
if they trained me in a different way,

678
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:45,970
acetone for known could have.
They could lick their lips and thought,

679
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,110
oh,
this means food.

680
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,160
So you've got quite a lot of explaining 
to do and how these genes or the 

681
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,781
packaging of them could influence the 
brain is way beyond anything we can 

682
00:38:57,781 --> 00:39:01,600
understand at present.
So I think most people would say we just

683
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:03,040
don't,
haven't figured it out yet.

684
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,340
And this is a fairly recent experiment.
Two months ago,

685
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,480
a few months ago,
realized it was published a few months 

686
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,520
ago.
How long did they work on this for 

687
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:14,520
though?
Well,

688
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,041
I suppose they must have been working on
it for several years before they 

689
00:39:17,041 --> 00:39:17,200
published it,
but I mean,

690
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:22,230
what's exciting in biology at the moment
is that the standard off the shelf 

691
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,180
explanations that people used to have.
It's all genetically programmed and that

692
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:30,181
kind of thing.
This is falling apart until the year 

693
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:34,111
2000.
There was a huge taboo in biology 

694
00:39:34,111 --> 00:39:34,870
against the inheritance of acquired 
characteristics,

695
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:39,900
which means say a father builds up his 
muscles and become stronger and our 

696
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,760
learns particular skills.

697
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,140
The idea that the children could inherit
that was considered impossible.

698
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:50,560
It they said no,
it's all inheritances.

699
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:55,561
Just genetic.
Of course you get environmental 

700
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:55,561
influences.
If,

701
00:39:55,561 --> 00:39:58,240
if a dad takes his boys to weight 
lifting classes and stuff,

702
00:39:58,241 --> 00:40:00,100
then obviously they'll become more 
muscular.

703
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:05,520
Um,
but the idea that it could be anything 

704
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,391
could be passed through the genes that 
had been learned or acquired was 

705
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:14,490
absolutely to Bu.
It was a heresy in 20th century biology 

706
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:14,950
in the West.
Interestingly,

707
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,200
in the Soviet Union,
they went the other way,

708
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:22,180
started in like the idea that if people 
got better at things that our kids would

709
00:40:22,181 --> 00:40:27,181
be better at them,
automatically they'd inherited and 

710
00:40:27,181 --> 00:40:30,240
geneticists in the Soviet Union were 
persecuted and people who did research 

711
00:40:30,251 --> 00:40:32,290
on the inheritance of acquired 
characteristics.

712
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:36,400
We're well funded and prestigious and 
this polarized things even more.

713
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:39,850
There was a kind of cold war in biology 
as well as in everything else.

714
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:46,650
But around the year 2000,
it became clear that the really is an 

715
00:40:47,351 --> 00:40:52,351
inheritance of acquired characteristics 
and it's been rebranded epigenetic 

716
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:52,970
inheritance.
Um,

717
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,660
and it's now a really hot topic in 
biology.

718
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:59,470
And these mice inheriting the fear of 
their fathers experiments,

719
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,770
a part of this new wave of research on 
epigenetics.

720
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,480
And it turns out that a lot of things 
the Soviet biologists were claiming are 

721
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,360
actually true.
I'm.

722
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,780
One of the things I think ought to 
happen is that somebody who knows 

723
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,521
Russian,
preferably someone who's in Russia goes 

724
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:22,300
back through these archives of Soviet 
biology from the 19 twenties,

725
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:23,200
thirties,
forties,

726
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:28,201
and fifties when tens of thousands of 
biologists and the Soviet Union were 

727
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:31,600
working on what we now call epigenetic 
inheritance and,

728
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,330
um,
it's a mine of information that could be

729
00:41:35,331 --> 00:41:38,630
dusted off and could be really helpful 
to science,

730
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,070
but nobody's done that yet because it's 
usually assumed the whole of that's been

731
00:41:43,071 --> 00:41:44,130
discredited.
And,

732
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:47,270
and even Russians don't want to talk 
about it.

733
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,460
That's so fascinating.
It's so fascinating that,

734
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,830
that scientists are just now piecing 
together this new information.

735
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:57,430
Just start putting it together and pure.
It's purely anecdotal evidence.

736
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:01,000
I have young daughters and they wrestle 
around together and you know,

737
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:06,001
they play in the bed and laugh and joke 
and I've been doing Jujitsu since the 19

738
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:10,300
nineties and my daughter's assumed 
Jujitsu positions.

739
00:42:10,301 --> 00:42:12,820
I see them do it before.
I've taught them now,

740
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,610
but when they were little,
like three and four years old,

741
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,630
my,
my,

742
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:21,660
my,
my youngest would do what's called an 

743
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:24,361
over under control.
She would grab her back and grip like a 

744
00:42:24,361 --> 00:42:26,770
certain way that you teach people to do 
and then she would throw her legs over.

745
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:28,400
It's called taking the back.
It's a.

746
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:31,030
it's a position,
a standard position in Jujitsu,

747
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,190
but it's not a normal position for 
people,

748
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,600
but she would automatically go to it,
pull my older daughter on top of her and

749
00:42:37,601 --> 00:42:42,601
take her back and it was the craziest 
thing to watch as a martial arts 

750
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:43,180
commentator,
someone who understands,

751
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:44,980
you know the correct way to do 
positions.

752
00:42:44,981 --> 00:42:46,090
I would watch her do it.
I was like,

753
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:51,210
she knows what she's doing.
I don't think she knows why she knows 

754
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:54,451
what she's doing,
but she assumed a position that I've 

755
00:42:54,451 --> 00:42:55,720
done countless times,
thousands of times in my life.

756
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,310
It automatically came to her and I'm 
like,

757
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:01,300
that has to be somehow or another in her
code.

758
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,580
Somehow or another,
it's gone from my body.

759
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,710
Exactly.
Whether it's a really,

760
00:43:06,711 --> 00:43:10,520
really interesting case and you see,
I would call that morphic resonance that

761
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,090
she's resonating with us.
She's got your jeans,

762
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,190
he's caught your proteins and those of 
her mother as well,

763
00:43:16,191 --> 00:43:17,110
of course.
Um,

764
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:22,520
but this similarity to you means she'd 
be in a particular strong resonance with

765
00:43:22,521 --> 00:43:24,770
you and would pick up things that you've
acquired.

766
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:29,300
And I think it's interesting you see in 
many traditional societies,

767
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:32,150
children would follow in the footsteps 
of their parents,

768
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:33,740
you know,
blacksmiths,

769
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,320
sons had become blacksmiths.
And in India,

770
00:43:36,321 --> 00:43:37,460
the caste system,
you know,

771
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,520
if someone's a potter,
they're kids that become potters and if 

772
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:42,520
they're a weaver,
they're kids that become weavers.

773
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:48,190
And um,
I think this is partly because people 

774
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,230
would have a special aptitude for doing 
things their parents had done for skills

775
00:43:51,231 --> 00:43:56,231
their parents had acquired,
not through the genes but by a kind of 

776
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:59,741
resonance obviously training and growing
up in a household where people know 

777
00:43:59,741 --> 00:44:04,691
these things plays an important part.
But even before the regular training 

778
00:44:04,691 --> 00:44:09,011
begins,
you'd expect them to show these 

779
00:44:09,011 --> 00:44:09,080
tendencies.
And so that's a particularly interesting

780
00:44:09,081 --> 00:44:14,081
example because you're able to observe 
these positions most people wouldn't 

781
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:14,540
notice.
But,

782
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,530
um,
that's the kind of thing that I think is

783
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,780
likely to be going on all the time.

784
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:25,910
Yeah,
there's been several of those positions 

785
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,910
there.
I mean,

786
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:26,820
sometimes it's just play.
And I see them just rolling around,

787
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:32,000
but then there's these clear patterns,
like one of them is a knee to belly to 

788
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,100
the mount.

789
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,880
There's this position that you do when 
you're in what's called side control.

790
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:38,700
You put your knee on someone's stomach,
you slide it across,

791
00:44:38,701 --> 00:44:43,701
and you get on top of the mounting them 
with your hips above their hips and she 

792
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:43,701
does it.
It instinctively.

793
00:44:43,701 --> 00:44:46,200
And it's not an instinctive move for 
most kids.

794
00:44:46,201 --> 00:44:49,470
And I try to,
I try to be objective when I watch it.

795
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:54,471
Like how much of this is just natural 
human movement and how much of this is 

796
00:44:54,471 --> 00:44:58,341
like her actually having some 
information and there's clear blips 

797
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:02,340
where I go look at that data that is 
normal like in Jujitsu class,

798
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:04,330
but it's not normal for kids.
Like there's,

799
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,440
there are things that they've learned.
And then there's also like when I've 

800
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,350
taught them stuff,
they pick things up.

801
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:13,890
Like they already knew it.
It's like I used to teach martial arts.

802
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:18,891
So I've taught quite a few people and I 
know children are a little easier to 

803
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:22,131
teach than than other folks,
but there's children of people who are 

804
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:26,061
martial artists and then there's 
children of people who have never 

805
00:45:26,061 --> 00:45:29,271
studied martial arts and the children of
people who are martial artists were 

806
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:29,910
almost universally easier to teach.

807
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,750
And it sort of backs up that idea.
Yes.

808
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,520
I mean,
one could even do experiments on this,

809
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:42,430
actually quantify it.
I'm my own approach to science is that 

810
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:45,120
you have to start from what people have 
noticed,

811
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,990
like your observations with kids of 
martial arts people including your own.

812
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:54,650
And then if you want to take it further,
you could do more rigorous observations 

813
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,890
and just standard explanation.
People say,

814
00:45:55,891 --> 00:46:00,891
Oh,
well they've seen their parents do to 

815
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:00,891
alucien videos or pictures of it around 
the house and that sort of thing.

816
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:03,000
That might play some part in it.
But,

817
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:08,320
um,
I think there's likely to be much more 

818
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,080
than that to this and when we'd 
obviously have to do special experiments

819
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:11,950
too chunky out.
Um,

820
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,750
I mentioned,
I think in many areas,

821
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:21,150
um,
it should be easier to teach kids whose 

822
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,320
parents have done something like my own 
kids.

823
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:26,380
My two sons are extremely musical,
brilliant,

824
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,920
new musical ones,
a professional musician.

825
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,050
Um,
well I play the piano.

826
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,960
My grandfather was a church organist.
My uncle was a church organist.

827
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:39,390
My father was very musical.
My mother was,

828
00:46:39,391 --> 00:46:43,920
played the piano and was very musical.
My wife's family were musical.

829
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,730
Her mother was a concert pianist who 
found it was a pianist and a singer,

830
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:53,300
and right from the age of four,
they wanted to play the piano.

831
00:46:53,881 --> 00:46:57,810
They wanted to learn music and they 
shared a tremendous amount of ability to

832
00:46:57,811 --> 00:47:02,811
assimilate it.
There are sometimes people who are very 

833
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:02,811
musical who come from non musical 
families,

834
00:47:02,811 --> 00:47:07,791
but some of the greatest musical 
geniuses come out of musical dentist is 

835
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:08,290
like buck.
I mean,

836
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:12,450
he came from a dentistry of musicians.
And so I think that these,

837
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:17,750
uh,
these things are probably easier to 

838
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:18,510
learn if parents have learned them.
It's so fascinating.

839
00:47:18,511 --> 00:47:23,511
Just the,
the concept of learning things and 

840
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:26,301
learning things from some really an 
known source.

841
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,070
One of the things that you brought up in
the trial logs

842
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:35,080
I thought was particularly interesting 
and really resonated with me was you 

843
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,221
were talking about how children in New 
York City are afraid of monsters,

844
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,640
that it's a natural inclination for 
children to be afraid of things in the 

845
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,570
dark with large teeth that are going to 
eat you.

846
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:51,750
And that this goes back to the time 
where we were regularly.

847
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:58,440
Predators took babies.
They like big cats are monsters as it 

848
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,300
were in the night,
would steal people,

849
00:48:01,301 --> 00:48:02,520
would eat.
People prayed,

850
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:07,540
preyed on human beings.
That it makes sense that these children 

851
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,390
have this intuitive instinct built into 
their genetics or whatever it is.

852
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,330
Well,
exactly.

853
00:48:11,331 --> 00:48:12,060
I mean,
the,

854
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,990
the standard.
So to true,

855
00:48:14,210 --> 00:48:17,310
the human prehistoric past his man,
the hunter,

856
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,780
striding out onto the savannas of Africa
and stuff.

857
00:48:20,781 --> 00:48:21,770
But,
um,

858
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,240
it was much more,
I think the case man,

859
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:25,550
the hunted.
I mean,

860
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:30,580
humans are particularly defenseless 
against big predators and until recent 

861
00:48:31,671 --> 00:48:36,410
times were very vulnerable to them.
Like Tigers in India,

862
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,390
during the,
under the British rule,

863
00:48:38,391 --> 00:48:41,070
even as late as 19 forties,
um,

864
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:47,030
there were thousands of people a year 
killed by managing tigers and they 

865
00:48:47,631 --> 00:48:49,970
usually go for the most vulnerable.
I mean,

866
00:48:49,971 --> 00:48:54,971
when predators are working in Africa,
when lions are attacking herds of 

867
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:57,260
antelope or something,
they go for the old and the sick or they

868
00:48:57,261 --> 00:49:00,290
go for the young because they are the 
ones that are the most vulnerable.

869
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:04,070
So probably over huge amounts of human 
history,

870
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:09,550
young children had indeed been eaten by 
predators and um,

871
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,960
and still wear.

872
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:18,970
And,
and probably today in some parts were 

873
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,100
maybe still are.
These were the most realistic fears for 

874
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,701
huge periods of human history.
And so I think it's fascinating that I'm

875
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,190
young children have these nightmares.
The study in New York looked at the 

876
00:49:31,221 --> 00:49:36,221
nightmares of young children.
Nearly all of them were about being 

877
00:49:36,221 --> 00:49:38,090
chased by monsters or scary animals.
Um,

878
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,570
and of course we feed this imagination 
in children's through fairytales.

879
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:44,220
Think of grimms fairy tales,
you know,

880
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,780
like Little Red Riding Hood where 
there's the big bad wolf,

881
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,800
you know,
that is going to eat up little red 

882
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,270
riding hood and the 70 stories in 
fairytales.

883
00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:00,460
Have wolves that could eat children and 
although nowadays the image of wolves 

884
00:50:01,701 --> 00:50:06,500
has been sanitized and we're told that 
basically a furry loving creatures,

885
00:50:06,501 --> 00:50:11,501
et Cetera,
they are predators and if they get the 

886
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:13,120
chance in the past,
I think they did each children's in the

887
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,890
past,
in the present,

888
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:19,920
if they have the right numbers.
We know we've talked about this in the 

889
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,290
podcast,
but there was an instance in the 14,

890
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:24,310
hundreds and France were wolves killed 
40 people in France.

891
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,320
It's just a matter of them reaching the 
right numbers.

892
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:32,950
World War Two,
there was an instance where the Germans 

893
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,461
and the Russians had a ceasefire because
so many of their troops were getting 

894
00:50:36,461 --> 00:50:41,021
killed by wolves.
They united together take out a giant 

895
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:42,200
super pack of wolves in Russia because 
you know,

896
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,960
there was hundreds of wolves that were 
just slaughtering soldiers.

897
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,340
What was.
They're dangerous.

898
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:48,050
They're.
They're very tricky animals.

899
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:53,100
Just we eradicated them to very low 
numbers and then when the numbers start 

900
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:57,221
to build up again,
they start getting more and more 

901
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:57,221
dangerous again.

902
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:59,500
But I've seen this myself.
We spend a summers on a remote island in

903
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:01,810
British Columbia,
Cortez Island BC,

904
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,910
and about 10 years ago the wolves came 
back.

905
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
They swam from other islands and at 
first most people are social liberal 

906
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,290
kind of people and so it was great 
wildlife returns,

907
00:51:14,291 --> 00:51:15,710
et Cetera.
Um,

908
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,320
but these rules became increasingly bold
and our family and some land up there.

909
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:24,310
We have a forest,
we don't have a house,

910
00:51:24,311 --> 00:51:28,090
we just have forest land and my sons 
without on our land,

911
00:51:28,091 --> 00:51:33,091
they'd been sleeping out when a big wolf
suddenly appeared and looked very,

912
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:37,240
very threatening and they'd been told,
don't run if you see a wolf.

913
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:42,630
So they,
they stood there and they faced it and 

914
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:43,210
then it's will sort of puffed up.
It's fair in charged them and it stopped

915
00:51:43,211 --> 00:51:47,130
a few yards away and they backed off 
slowly.

916
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:49,000
They ran when they got around the 
corner.

917
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,910
Um,
but this was clearly threatening,

918
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,380
very,
very scary.

919
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,410
Then they started eating people's dogs.
Um,

920
00:51:56,920 --> 00:52:01,920
and there's nothing,
I've never seen a faster transition 

921
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:01,920
from,
uh,

922
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,940
someone who is a kind of wolf,
loving liberal,

923
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,310
won't say dark,
cause heat,

924
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:10,340
Heaton.
They wanted the guys with guns to come 

925
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,200
out and teach these wolves that lesson.
Yeah.

926
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:16,260
And they did,
some of them were shot and know they're 

927
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:16,660
much more frightened of people.
They keep their distance.

928
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:18,190
They're still there.
But,

929
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:19,360
um,
if they,

930
00:52:19,361 --> 00:52:22,480
if there hadn't been a pushback from the
people on the island,

931
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,640
they would have got increasingly bold.

932
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:29,990
Yeah,
there's an issue that's going on right 

933
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:31,461
now where people are resisting the idea 
of hunting walls because they've 

934
00:52:31,461 --> 00:52:32,160
reintroduced wolves,
a lot of the western United States.

935
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,490
And uh,
in,

936
00:52:33,491 --> 00:52:36,330
in some places they've reached very 
large numbers,

937
00:52:36,331 --> 00:52:41,331
thousands of walls and Idaho and a 
couple of these areas where they've 

938
00:52:41,331 --> 00:52:44,151
decimated elk and moose,
moose populations or elk and deer 

939
00:52:44,151 --> 00:52:45,430
populations rather.
And uh,

940
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:50,510
you know,
there's a lot of people that are animal 

941
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:50,510
rights folks that aren't there.
They're not there.

942
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:55,220
And they resist it very strongly.
Like the idea of killing wolves as 

943
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,040
barbaric and evil.
But to the folks that lived there,

944
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,640
they're like,
no,

945
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:59,310
we love animals,
but you have to deal with this.

946
00:52:59,311 --> 00:53:03,030
You've got a real problem here.
Especially when they formed large packs,

947
00:53:03,031 --> 00:53:08,031
they get very dangerous in Russia.
They had these super packs of wolves in 

948
00:53:08,281 --> 00:53:13,281
Siberia that we're taking out horses.
They were showing up 100 wolfs at a 

949
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:14,370
time.
They were showing up these horse stables

950
00:53:14,371 --> 00:53:16,570
and slaughtering a horse.
And you know,

951
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:18,720
there's not much you can do about a 
hundred walls.

952
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,650
No.
Well,

953
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,800
given all this background,
I think that's so fascinating for young 

954
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,250
children,
especially urban,

955
00:53:26,251 --> 00:53:28,470
young children who've actually never 
seen.

956
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,560
They would never see a wolf your life or
any other scary animal.

957
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,470
These are the things that hold their 
nightmares.

958
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:36,900
And I think this is part of a kind of 
collective memory.

959
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,180
Um,
I mean the more realistic dangerous for 

960
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:42,180
young children being run over by cars,

961
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,210
a sexual Predator or sexual predators 
people.

962
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:50,211
But that's not what their dreams are.
It may be what their parents nightmares 

963
00:53:50,211 --> 00:53:51,090
are about,
but not the children themselves.

964
00:53:51,091 --> 00:53:56,091
So there was a television show in 
America that are hosted called fear 

965
00:53:56,091 --> 00:53:57,020
factor.
And it was a game show.

966
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:02,080
They had to do these stunts and 
different stents had different things 

967
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,481
they have to do.
One of the things that I found 

968
00:54:05,481 --> 00:54:07,220
incredibly fascinating with,
some people have irrational fears about 

969
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,880
certain animals,
whether it's spiders,

970
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,520
snakes,
a Arachnophobia phobia,

971
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:16,700
and those,
those fears were undeniable and they 

972
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:17,010
weren't just like,
people are nervous of heights,

973
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:22,040
like I'm nervous of heights.
I look over the side of a building or 

974
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:22,040
woo,
but it's not an irrational fear.

975
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,541
It's a.
it's a normal natural fear of I don't 

976
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:27,180
want to fall,
but there are some people you would show

977
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:28,770
them a snake and they would.

978
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:31,650
They would black out,
they couldn't stay conscious.

979
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,170
They would,
they would hyperventilate and they would

980
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:39,171
faint.
And I couldn't believe they were normal 

981
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:39,171
folks.
When I would talk to them,

982
00:54:39,171 --> 00:54:44,150
there would be nothing that would 
indicate in any way that they were 

983
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,070
psychologically deranged or there was 
something missing in their,

984
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:52,300
you know,
whatever developmental period that 

985
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,510
they'd gone through,
something got screwed up and they're 

986
00:54:55,510 --> 00:54:55,980
just missing a giant chunk of what makes
a person a normal person.

987
00:54:56,010 --> 00:54:57,390
No,
they seem completely normal.

988
00:54:57,510 --> 00:54:58,890
But you show them a spider and they 
would,

989
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:05,530
and I always wondered like what is is 
that maybe some someone down the line in

990
00:55:06,001 --> 00:55:11,001
their history was bitten by a spider,
someone down the line was poisoned by a 

991
00:55:11,001 --> 00:55:12,870
snake and survived or they saw someone 
poisoned by a snake.

992
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,370
I mean,
whatever it is,

993
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,400
it's real and it's a.
These are real psychological issues that

994
00:55:19,981 --> 00:55:23,200
people have to deal with Arachnephobia 
in a video phobia in,

995
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,690
in,
in particular,

996
00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:25,680
they're very strong.

997
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,400
Yes.
Well,

998
00:55:27,401 --> 00:55:32,401
I,
I think these could easily be inherited 

999
00:55:32,401 --> 00:55:34,951
fairview's.
I mean it's well known in animals that 

1000
00:55:34,951 --> 00:55:36,340
you can have instinctive fear and of 
course it makes sense for animals.

1001
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:40,660
You probably know those experiments they
do with day old chicks or with ducklings

1002
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:45,990
and you have the mountain,
an enclosure doors and then they do 

1003
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,460
these experiments.
They have cardboard cutouts and with the

1004
00:55:48,461 --> 00:55:53,461
silhouettes of birds and you pull them 
across on wires and if you pull across 

1005
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,740
things with the silhouette of a hawk,
these,

1006
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:59,650
these ducklings just freeze.
You know,

1007
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:03,730
the fear response is to just freeze.
They freeze it.

1008
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:08,731
Whereas if you pull across something 
looks like silhouette of a pigeon or a 

1009
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:10,090
red wing,
black work bad or something,

1010
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:11,890
um,
they don't.

1011
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:16,420
Um,
so they have an inherited fear of things

1012
00:56:16,421 --> 00:56:21,421
that could in fact be dangerous and it's
perfectly in terms of evolution.

1013
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,400
Makes perfect sense.
See why that would work.

1014
00:56:24,401 --> 00:56:29,401
These baby ducklings don't have time to 
learn which birds are harmful and which 

1015
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:34,171
are not.
But an instinctive response of fear to 

1016
00:56:34,171 --> 00:56:37,201
something that is actually scary.
It may sometimes lead them to respond 

1017
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:38,770
something that isn't like a cardboard 
cutout,

1018
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,880
but,
um,

1019
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:42,520
it's,
I think these things make complete sense

1020
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:43,270
biologically.
Logically.

1021
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,310
Yeah,
it does make sense if you stop and think

1022
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:50,311
about it,
if you really take into consideration 

1023
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:53,620
all the things you have to learn to 
survive as any animal,

1024
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:58,790
as a,
just this idea that these mice would 

1025
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:02,520
learn somehow or another through their,
their parents to avoid that,

1026
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:07,550
that certain smell,
that smell was associated with 

1027
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,901
electrical shock.
It only makes sense that somehow or 

1028
00:57:09,901 --> 00:57:12,160
another biological life would transmit 
information in as many ways as possible.

1029
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:18,010
Your idea is so fascinating because 
you're not even talking about biological

1030
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:20,530
life transferring information through 
genetics.

1031
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:25,800
You're talking about it through some 
unseen force that has yet to be defined 

1032
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:29,410
and that's when things get really 
squirrely and is that when you.

1033
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:34,450
That's must be when you experience the 
most resistance to these ideas because 

1034
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:39,860
the resistance of these ideas,
I'm sure before they proposed this idea 

1035
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:43,801
that genetics or that these mice with 
somehow or another to inherit the fear 

1036
00:57:43,801 --> 00:57:48,721
of this smell from their parents.
That was probably not very well received

1037
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:54,540
before it was proven,
but then it was proven so now it's sort 

1038
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:55,810
of has to be accepted and has to be 
taken into consideration,

1039
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,770
but your idea is still very fringe.

1040
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,080
Oh yes.
It's.

1041
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:04,920
It's the interesting thing is you see 
the response.

1042
00:58:04,921 --> 00:58:09,921
I get this from,
from some scientists who is actually 

1043
00:58:09,921 --> 00:58:13,200
extremely emotional and irrational.
When my first book,

1044
00:58:13,201 --> 00:58:18,201
a new science of life came out,
there was a very famous editorial in 

1045
00:58:18,201 --> 00:58:22,401
nature of the leading science magazine a
few months after the book appeared to 

1046
00:58:23,071 --> 00:58:25,530
start with.
Nature ignored it,

1047
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:30,830
but then a lot of people got interest.
I was doing programs on the radio in 

1048
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,611
Britain,
there was an article editorial in the 

1049
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:35,580
Guardian saying,
what's an interesting idea?

1050
00:58:35,581 --> 00:58:37,890
And so a lot of serious discussion going
on,

1051
00:58:37,891 --> 00:58:42,891
New Scientist magazine launched a 
competition for the best ideas for 

1052
00:58:42,891 --> 00:58:44,700
experiments to test morphic resonance 
and,

1053
00:58:45,210 --> 00:58:50,210
um,
and it was beginning to be widely 

1054
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:50,210
discussed,
the editor of nature,

1055
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:53,220
who was a reaction refigure in silence.
So,

1056
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:56,490
you know,
old style materialist mechanistic,

1057
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:01,710
a hardcore scientist wrote a famous 
editorial called a book for burning on 

1058
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:08,211
the front page of nature.
I'm comparing my book unfavorably with 

1059
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:12,441
Mine Kampf Hitler's book,
saying that this was a profoundly 

1060
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:16,101
dangerous book.
And he said this is the best candidate 

1061
00:59:16,101 --> 00:59:17,250
for burning.
There has been for many years and it was

1062
00:59:17,251 --> 00:59:21,740
completely irrational.
This attack on my book it emotional,

1063
00:59:21,741 --> 00:59:23,090
irrational polemical.

1064
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,380
He didn't do it as a joke.
Um,

1065
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:32,920
and this of course produced a backlash 
because quite a few scientists thought 

1066
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:36,020
this was the wrong way to respond to a 
scientific hypothesis.

1067
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,260
Um,
so a lot of letters in nature for months

1068
00:59:39,261 --> 00:59:42,050
afterwards were backing me up and 
saying,

1069
00:59:42,051 --> 00:59:47,051
you know,
this is something that should be 

1070
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:47,051
seriously discussed,
not simply denounced.

1071
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:50,270
Um,
but the fact is that this started a kind

1072
00:59:50,271 --> 00:59:53,360
of controversy which has been going on 
ever since.

1073
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,680
Um,
but until the year 2000,

1074
00:59:57,950 --> 01:00:00,200
most biologists thought genes did 
everything.

1075
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:06,210
No,
I'm the epigenetic thing has taken over 

1076
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:10,331
in the missing heritability problem.
There's much more openness than the was 

1077
01:00:10,331 --> 01:00:12,320
because it's clear we haven't figured it
all out.

1078
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,100
Interestingly,
Charles Darwin,

1079
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:21,510
um,
was not a neo Darwinian Neo Darwinian 

1080
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:24,500
evolution theory says it's all done by 
the genes.

1081
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:29,501
Evolution is just about random mutation 
and natural selection of gene 

1082
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:29,501
frequencies.

1083
01:00:29,501 --> 01:00:31,450
This is the basis of Richard Dawkins 
work.

1084
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:32,720
For example,
his book,

1085
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:35,510
the selfish gene,
is based on that model.

1086
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,560
Darwin,
I'm actually believed in the inheritance

1087
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:44,561
of acquired characteristics.
He thought that animals could inherit 

1088
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:48,520
the fears of their fathers and that most
of adaptation could actually be passed 

1089
01:00:49,821 --> 01:00:53,600
on to animals and plants to send it from
parents.

1090
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,150
He thought that was how evolution 
worked.

1091
01:00:56,270 --> 01:01:01,270
He even proposed that when something had
been learned that could be movement at 

1092
01:01:01,611 --> 01:01:04,940
something through the bloodstream that 
could affect the sperm and the eggs,

1093
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:10,570
exactly the kinds of things that's not 
being considered in this fear of the 

1094
01:01:10,570 --> 01:01:13,580
father's case,
so movement through the bloodstream.

1095
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:16,220
So if you learn something like say if 
you touch something,

1096
01:01:16,221 --> 01:01:20,690
it's electric fence and it shocks you.
There's movement through the bloodstream

1097
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:24,590
that teaches your sperm.
That was what Darwin thought we put.

1098
01:01:24,750 --> 01:01:29,750
He wrote a book called the variation of 
animals and plants under domestication 

1099
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:31,940
is less well known than his most famous 
book,

1100
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:33,290
the origin of species.

1101
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:38,820
Um,
but in the variation of animals and 

1102
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:42,611
plants under domestication,
he was so convinced that plants and 

1103
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:44,330
animals could inherit what their parents
had learned.

1104
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:49,660
He tried to figure out how it might work
and his last chapter is called the 

1105
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:53,741
hypothesis of pathogenesis is the name 
he gave to his theory that somehow 

1106
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:58,601
little bits were detached from the brain
and went through the blood and affected 

1107
01:01:58,601 --> 01:01:58,670
the sperm.
No,

1108
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,800
that's more or less what people are 
saying,

1109
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:04,160
trying to explain the mice,
inheriting the fear of their fathers.

1110
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:09,590
That aspect of Darwin's work has been 
airbrushed out of scientific history,

1111
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,210
and Darwin also wrote a paper in nature,
um,

1112
01:02:13,370 --> 01:02:17,210
about a dog that he came across that 
whenever this dog,

1113
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:22,480
uh,
gotten there to a butcher's shop that 

1114
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,260
the dog was completely terrified.
Butchers and Darwin figured out that 

1115
01:02:25,471 --> 01:02:30,471
it's parents,
one of his parents had been kicked or 

1116
01:02:30,471 --> 01:02:33,501
badly mistreated by a butcher,
and this dog had inherited a phobia of 

1117
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:33,501
butchers.

1118
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:38,840
Now Darwin published that in nature.
That shows you how very different 

1119
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,720
Darwin's ideas on evolution were from 
his 20th century successors.

1120
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:47,721
And the reason that modern evolutionary 
theory is called near Darwinism is to 

1121
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:52,941
distinguish it from Darwinism,
which included the inheritance of 

1122
01:02:52,941 --> 01:02:55,320
habits.
I'm very similar to what I'm saying.

1123
01:02:55,530 --> 01:03:00,530
What I'm saying in terms of the 
inheritance of habits through morphic 

1124
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,010
resonance is actually really close to 
what Darwin himself said.

1125
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:07,490
Um,
but it's not what neo Darwinians say 

1126
01:03:07,490 --> 01:03:09,510
because they've tried to say all 
inheritances in jeans and you can't have

1127
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:11,160
these other things.
But no,

1128
01:03:11,161 --> 01:03:15,120
they'll have to change their tune.
Because as I say in the last few years,

1129
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:20,330
epigenetic inheritance,
the inheritance of acquired 

1130
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:20,330
characteristics is back in fashion.

1131
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:22,240
Well,
there's many people that haven't studied

1132
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:27,570
Darwin's ideas at all that aren't 
familiar with the amount of resistance 

1133
01:03:27,570 --> 01:03:29,650
that Darwin received when he was 
proposing these ideas,

1134
01:03:29,651 --> 01:03:31,780
like these weren't accepted ideas at 
all.

1135
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:37,030
In fact,
the majority of scientists at the time 

1136
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:37,030
were,
uh,

1137
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:38,650
they were more of a Christian faith 
weren't thing.

1138
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:40,510
Yes,
but it was,

1139
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:42,850
the response to Darwin was particularly 
interesting.

1140
01:03:42,851 --> 01:03:44,410
You see,
because many,

1141
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,350
many Christians in England,
um,

1142
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:54,900
after being surprised by his ideas and 
actually said,

1143
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:59,260
well,
that's fine if God's the creator of life

1144
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:00,370
and why not,
can't God,

1145
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:05,120
we're a from evolution,
create life that can evolve by Andrea.

1146
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:10,121
It's own steam.
And his ideas were quite rapidly 

1147
01:04:10,121 --> 01:04:13,651
accepted by the Roman Catholic and 
Anglican Episcopal churches and the 

1148
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:14,890
methodist and so on.
Um,

1149
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:20,260
this fundamentalist creationist thing is
a peculiar American phenomenon.

1150
01:04:20,261 --> 01:04:25,261
It didn't originate until the 20th 
century and it was started in America 

1151
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,370
and it's virtually unknown in Britain.
Um,

1152
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:32,490
I'm actually a practicing Christian.
I'm an Anglican and I never meet 

1153
01:04:32,490 --> 01:04:36,781
creationists in England.
I've never heard anyone with what 

1154
01:04:36,781 --> 01:04:38,860
exactly is an Anglican Church of 
England.

1155
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:44,220
The Church of England is the,
it's sort of halfway between Protestant 

1156
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:48,481
and Catholic.
What happened in England under King 

1157
01:04:48,481 --> 01:04:52,081
Henry the eighth and the 16th century 
was that he nationalized the church and 

1158
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:53,680
he said,
okay,

1159
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:55,570
the pope's not head of the church 
anymore.

1160
01:04:55,570 --> 01:05:00,570
I am and I'm the priest can,
Mary will have services in English and 

1161
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:03,880
bishops can be married.
And um,

1162
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:07,030
so,
but the services remain much the same.

1163
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,650
And the Church of England,
if you go to Anglican services,

1164
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:14,950
very like a Roman Catholic service,
except that we have married priests,

1165
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:17,800
we have women bishops,
women,

1166
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:18,580
women,
priests,

1167
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:23,640
outrageous,
outrageous from a Catholic point of 

1168
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:23,640
view.
Um,

1169
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:23,960
but,
uh,

1170
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,530
anyway,
the Church of England is so,

1171
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,640
so it's,
it's,

1172
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:32,820
it's never had the sort of extreme 
protestant doctrines like southern 

1173
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:33,820
baptists and so on.
Um,

1174
01:05:33,940 --> 01:05:34,780
it's,
it's,

1175
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:37,150
it's very similar to the Catholic 
church.

1176
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,550
It's now one of the most liberal 
churches.

1177
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Um,
but Anglicans on the whole had no 

1178
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:45,000
problem with evolution.
They still don't.

1179
01:05:46,330 --> 01:05:51,330
I've just been doing a workshop last 
weekend at the Allen Institute in big 

1180
01:05:51,671 --> 01:05:56,671
Sur,
which I was co leading with the Bishop 

1181
01:05:56,671 --> 01:06:00,420
of California,
who's Cathedral is Grace Cathedral in 

1182
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:00,940
San Francisco,
a very beautiful cathedral on Nob Hill.

1183
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:05,050
We were discussing the kinds of things 
you and I are discussing.

1184
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:10,230
He was completely open to all this.
There was absolutely no problem 

1185
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:14,140
discussing this with an Anglican 
Episcopalian bishop.

1186
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:19,990
It's a very far cry from what many 
people's image of Christians as opposing

1187
01:06:19,991 --> 01:06:24,991
evolution,
the general view that many Christians 

1188
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:24,991
have.
An I'm one,

1189
01:06:24,991 --> 01:06:28,150
um,
is that the evolution of nature of,

1190
01:06:28,151 --> 01:06:33,151
if there's a creative part in nature,
it may be God given in the first place,

1191
01:06:33,161 --> 01:06:35,410
but what God did was to,
in,

1192
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:40,470
in nature with a part create new forms 
of life that there's a kind of 

1193
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:44,131
intelligent creativity in nature.
You don't have to have a kind of 

1194
01:06:44,131 --> 01:06:48,900
intelligent designing engineer outside 
nature tinkering with the machinery and 

1195
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:52,510
manipulating genes as the intelligent 
design people think.

1196
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,020
Um,
and uh,

1197
01:06:55,120 --> 01:07:00,040
you don't have to deny evolution all 
together to say God's involved in nature

1198
01:07:00,041 --> 01:07:00,730
in some way.

1199
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:06,090
It's perfectly possible to have a view 
where God is in nature and work through 

1200
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:07,360
nature,
and there's a creativity in nature which

1201
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:12,100
doesn't require the universe to have 
been created in 6,000,

1202
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,540
6,000
years ago,

1203
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:18,570
that completely accept the evolutionary 
history of the universe and cosmology 

1204
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,160
and an evolution.
Um,

1205
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:22,600
and just say,
well,

1206
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:28,320
if there's a god,
then that's the way that God works 

1207
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:29,410
through this evolutionary process and 
through the creativity of evolution.

1208
01:07:29,830 --> 01:07:30,460
So,
uh,

1209
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:33,710
the fundamentalist Christians and the 
new Earth Christians at that,

1210
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:35,760
that's a uniquely American thing.
Yes.

1211
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:37,270
I mean,
I do have followers,

1212
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:42,420
a few followers in Britain,
but day they take their lead entirely 

1213
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:45,900
from America and they've got a new batch
of converts their point of view in the 

1214
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:49,921
Islamic world.
Creationism inspired by American 

1215
01:07:49,921 --> 01:07:53,170
creationist is big in Turkey in many 
other Arab countries and stuff.

1216
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:58,530
Um,
but it's a peculiarly American 

1217
01:07:58,530 --> 01:07:58,530
phenomenon.

1218
01:07:58,530 --> 01:07:58,630
We know how it all came about in 
America,

1219
01:07:58,631 --> 01:07:59,160
right?
Where,

1220
01:07:59,161 --> 01:08:00,680
where it really took off.
Well,

1221
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:02,110
it became a part of the political 
system.

1222
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:07,120
The Reagan administration,
they started recruiting the radical 

1223
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,270
Christians and that became a part of his
electoral base.

1224
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:12,340
Yes.
It's a very,

1225
01:08:12,341 --> 01:08:14,470
very interesting history.
It had always been,

1226
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:19,500
for most foreigners,
American politics is completely 

1227
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:20,810
impossible to understand.
It's impossible to understand how people

1228
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:24,650
can be so polarized and so extreme in 
their views.

1229
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,880
And I read a book recently which made it
much clearer to me.

1230
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:33,881
It's called the sword of the Lord.
It's written by a guy called Andrew 

1231
01:08:33,881 --> 01:08:38,171
himes who was raised southern baptist.
Seven of his cousins are southern 

1232
01:08:38,171 --> 01:08:39,020
Baptist ministers.
His father,

1233
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:41,630
his grandfather,
his grandfather who was called rice,

1234
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:47,020
was one of the inventors of American 
fundamentalism and it's a fascinating 

1235
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:50,450
historical study of this phenomenon and 
why they were like that.

1236
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,720
And um,
it made a lot more sense to me.

1237
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:59,080
I mean,
it's still a very bizarre and very 

1238
01:08:59,080 --> 01:08:59,080
American.

1239
01:08:59,080 --> 01:08:59,080
Yeah,
we're,

1240
01:08:59,080 --> 01:08:59,880
we're very weird.
Were hard to understand.

1241
01:08:59,881 --> 01:09:01,350
Even for us,
we,

1242
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:06,400
you know,
everyone's constantly trying to refocus 

1243
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:07,980
our political system or sort of re 
redefine it,

1244
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:09,560
calm it down,
reach more.

1245
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,600
I mean,
everyone's looking for a more moderate 

1246
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,110
conservative or someone who is more 
conservative,

1247
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:16,750
moderate,
you know,

1248
01:09:16,770 --> 01:09:19,470
we're always looking for someone who 
meets the bridge,

1249
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:24,500
someone to join the two sides.
So we don't have these radical 

1250
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:27,150
polarizing op opposing forces,
the left and the right,

1251
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,950
it's just,
it seems so childish.

1252
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:32,240
But what this book made and what was,
for me,

1253
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:37,040
a huge revelation was that how all of 
this is rooted in the American civil war

1254
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:39,440
and there's a sense in which in some 
people's minds,

1255
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:44,441
the civil war's still going on.
It's just that the sides of switched in 

1256
01:09:44,441 --> 01:09:44,990
the civil war,
the south was Democrat,

1257
01:09:45,150 --> 01:09:50,150
you're the slave owning silence.
They have political party after the 

1258
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:51,890
civil war was the Democrats and the 
Republicans,

1259
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:54,140
the liberals who wanted to free the 
slaves.

1260
01:09:54,590 --> 01:09:57,900
And one of the most interesting switches
that's happened is,

1261
01:09:57,901 --> 01:10:00,920
is this switch.
So now it's gone the other way around.

1262
01:10:00,921 --> 01:10:03,110
The Democrats and other liberals and 
stuff.

1263
01:10:03,111 --> 01:10:05,960
And uh,
and the Republicans have become the more

1264
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:10,580
right wing forces and powerful in the 
south,

1265
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:12,980
which was exactly the opposite.
Very bizarre.

1266
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:17,300
So what this book does is trace the 
history of this fascinating movement.

1267
01:10:17,301 --> 01:10:19,730
But what's so interesting is it in the 
civil war,

1268
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:25,460
both sides were using biblical texts to 
justify their position.

1269
01:10:25,850 --> 01:10:27,020
But the,
the,

1270
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:32,040
the,
the southern Baptists and the religious 

1271
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:35,291
people in the south actually had a much 
stronger biblical basis for slavery 

1272
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:38,450
because the Bible's full of slaves.
The Old Testament's full of slaves,

1273
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,010
the Israelites were slaves themselves.
They owned slaves in the New Testament.

1274
01:10:43,011 --> 01:10:45,080
Everyone owned slaves.
It was taken for granted.

1275
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:47,540
There were no abolitionists in the 
Bible.

1276
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,670
So if you base your faith on the Bible,
you can make a much stronger case for,

1277
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,940
for slavery than you can for 
abolitionism and so,

1278
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:59,450
but you have to take the Bible is 
literally true.

1279
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:04,830
And that gave a strong incentive for 
people in the south to make the Bible 

1280
01:11:04,830 --> 01:11:08,261
literally true.
Because you could justify slavery much 

1281
01:11:08,261 --> 01:11:08,500
better than if you interpret it in a 
liberal way saying,

1282
01:11:08,501 --> 01:11:12,590
well actually the spirit of Jesus was to
liberate people from bondage.

1283
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,260
They say,
okay,

1284
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:14,280
as well as the text.

1285
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:17,160
Jesus doesn't say anything about 
liberating slaves.

1286
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:23,110
So fundamentalism gave a kind of impetus
to this and,

1287
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,930
and,
and it was very,

1288
01:11:24,931 --> 01:11:29,931
very fascinating to see how that played 
out because on both sides in the civil 

1289
01:11:29,931 --> 01:11:34,371
war,
they were both invoking the Bible that 

1290
01:11:34,371 --> 01:11:34,371
both sides were Protestant.
Both sites were,

1291
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:38,190
had ministers preaching to inspire the 
troops and get them to fight.

1292
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,280
And um,
after the civil war,

1293
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:46,740
the way in which this tradition of 
fundamentalism that had developed in the

1294
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:51,741
American south justify slavery and gave 
a kind of ready made way to use biblical

1295
01:11:52,771 --> 01:11:57,771
texts to argue against all sorts of 
other things including evolutionary 

1296
01:11:57,771 --> 01:12:00,120
theory.
Whereas in Europe,

1297
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,300
in the traditional Catholic and,
and,

1298
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:07,340
and,
and in the more liberal Protestant 

1299
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:07,340
churches,
people hadn't taken the view.

1300
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:11,670
The Bible is the literal truth.
They taken the view that the Bible is a 

1301
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:11,670
guide to what might happen.

1302
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,920
That a lot of its meaning is allegorical
or symbolic,

1303
01:12:13,921 --> 01:12:18,300
but the kinds of so called liberal 
interpretation of the Bible goes back to

1304
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,300
the second century.
A D or something.

1305
01:12:21,301 --> 01:12:21,800
It's,
it's,

1306
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,540
it's been the mainstream view for a long
time.

1307
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:27,840
Your scientist,
what,

1308
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:31,680
what leads you to be a practicing 
Christian as a scientist?

1309
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:34,860
But I spent years as an atheist.
I mean,

1310
01:12:34,861 --> 01:12:38,310
when I was educated as a scientist,
part of the package deal is acs.

1311
01:12:38,820 --> 01:12:43,820
You know,
I grew up with all the standard time is 

1312
01:12:43,820 --> 01:12:45,450
14.
I was at a religious boarding school,

1313
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:50,900
a Christian boarding school.
I was the only boy in my year who 

1314
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,710
refused to get confirmed because even at
14 identified as an atheist.

1315
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:58,180
Um,
and I thought science means science and 

1316
01:12:58,951 --> 01:13:01,730
reason,
religion and superstition of things that

1317
01:13:01,731 --> 01:13:05,580
the past two scientists at the vanguard 
of human progress,

1318
01:13:05,730 --> 01:13:06,660
all that kind of thing.

1319
01:13:06,660 --> 01:13:11,660
I believe that.
But what made me begin to doubt it was I

1320
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:15,000
began to doubt that this was the right 
way forward in science.

1321
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:20,440
Um,
I began to think that this mechanistic 

1322
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:23,070
molecular approach to treating animals 
and plants as just machines,

1323
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,070
uh,
was an inadequate view of life.

1324
01:13:26,071 --> 01:13:29,910
I'd gone into biology because I was 
fascinated by animals and plants.

1325
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,390
I kept lots of pets as a child.
My father was a herbalist.

1326
01:13:33,391 --> 01:13:36,330
I collected plants and he taught me 
about plants.

1327
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:41,510
He had a microscope,
love oratory and cyber source of really 

1328
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:43,040
got into science as a child.
Um,

1329
01:13:43,950 --> 01:13:48,950
and uh,
when I started studying science at 

1330
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:52,730
school and university,
the first thing we did with living 

1331
01:13:52,730 --> 01:13:55,611
organisms,
organisms was to kill them and grind 

1332
01:13:55,611 --> 01:13:56,340
them up and then look at the enzymes in 
the liver or whatever.

1333
01:13:56,730 --> 01:13:58,260
Um,
it became clear to me,

1334
01:13:58,261 --> 01:13:59,790
we've not really studying life.

1335
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:01,920
We were studying death.
Um,

1336
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,170
and when I was a child I kept homing 
pigeons and I was fascinated with how do

1337
01:14:07,171 --> 01:14:09,420
they find their home.
I asked everybody I knew,

1338
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,410
man,
who kept homing pigeons.

1339
01:14:11,411 --> 01:14:13,810
It was a popular sport in Britain.
It still is.

1340
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:18,070
Um,
I had some myself and I used to put them

1341
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:23,071
in a box and cyclist fun as I could on 
my bicycle and released them and then 

1342
01:14:23,071 --> 01:14:26,240
cycle home and they always got home 
before I did a.

1343
01:14:26,290 --> 01:14:31,290
However far I took them out.
So this completely intrigued me and I 

1344
01:14:31,331 --> 01:14:36,331
thought,
we're never going to understand this by 

1345
01:14:36,331 --> 01:14:36,331
just grinding up their livers or looking
at their genes.

1346
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,250
So I began to doubt the mechanistic 
world view.

1347
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:42,970
Um,
then,

1348
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
um,
I encountered psychedelics and that was 

1349
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:52,051
a huge change,
I mean nothing in my scientific 

1350
01:14:52,051 --> 01:14:55,321
education and prepared me for the kind 
of mind opening effects of LSD and this 

1351
01:14:55,721 --> 01:14:57,700
was in the seventies,
early seventies.

1352
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:01,240
Um,
and um,

1353
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:06,980
you know,
I'd studied nerve impulses and hormones 

1354
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,050
and that kind of thing,
which is what we got in a science course

1355
01:15:08,051 --> 01:15:11,180
at Cambridge about the brain and you 
know,

1356
01:15:11,181 --> 01:15:13,750
I knew about the international youth,
the brain and nerve impulses,

1357
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:18,751
but these visionary experiences that 
psychedelics opened up showed me there 

1358
01:15:18,751 --> 01:15:22,600
was far more to the mind and indeed far 
more to reality than there's very,

1359
01:15:22,601 --> 01:15:27,601
very limited model.
Then I got interested in meditation 

1360
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:27,601
because I thought,
well,

1361
01:15:27,601 --> 01:15:30,310
it'd be good to be able to explore the 
mind without drugs.

1362
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:35,460
I mean I'm not anti psychedelic tour,
but it'd be good to have different 

1363
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:35,710
methods,
not just drugs.

1364
01:15:36,440 --> 01:15:41,440
And then I took up transcendental 
meditation and Yoga and then I got a job

1365
01:15:44,621 --> 01:15:49,621
in India.
I lived in India for seven years and 

1366
01:15:49,621 --> 01:15:50,990
when I was in India I was really into 
yoga and meditation.

1367
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,770
And,
and at first I thought,

1368
01:15:53,771 --> 01:15:56,140
this is just changing my brain 
physiology,

1369
01:15:56,141 --> 01:16:01,141
you don't need to believe there's a god 
out there or any thing mysterious out 

1370
01:16:01,141 --> 01:16:01,810
there.
It's just inside the body,

1371
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:07,140
the chemicals of the brain,
the yoga and meditation affect blood 

1372
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:07,140
flow,
et cetera.

1373
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:12,450
So I saw it in rather materialistic way,
but then I got more and more interest in

1374
01:16:13,631 --> 01:16:15,850
Hindu philosophy,
in Hindu ideas,

1375
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:20,890
the idea that there's a greater 
consciousness within which our 

1376
01:16:20,890 --> 01:16:22,000
consciousness is embedded through 
something,

1377
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:24,290
through some psychedelic experiences.
We Ca,

1378
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:29,410
we contact other realms of consciousness
that aren't just inside our brains 

1379
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:33,930
through meditation and through prayer 
that one can actually contact other 

1380
01:16:33,930 --> 01:16:35,730
forms of consciousness bigger than our 
own.

1381
01:16:36,670 --> 01:16:39,040
I did all that within a kind of Hindu 
context.

1382
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:41,710
And then I had a Sufi teacher in India 
as well,

1383
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:44,710
so I did sort of Islamic mysticism for 
awhile.

1384
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:50,790
But after doing this for several years,
I found that actually some of it didn't 

1385
01:16:51,371 --> 01:16:53,110
make sense to me.
The part that doesn't,

1386
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:55,060
didn't make sense to me.
Well,

1387
01:16:55,090 --> 01:17:00,090
the Islamic part to be a Sufi in India,
basically you had to be a Muslim and I 

1388
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:05,401
didn't really want to get into being a 
Muslim and sort of fasting in Ramadan 

1389
01:17:05,651 --> 01:17:10,651
and all that to be and Hindus.
They're basic worldview walls and for 

1390
01:17:13,641 --> 01:17:18,641
most of them still is the idea that 
we're just trapped in a world where 

1391
01:17:19,221 --> 01:17:23,600
things go on and on.
Rebirth and cycles of life and death and

1392
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:29,620
we're trapped in this world of suffering
and delusion and the way out is through 

1393
01:17:29,620 --> 01:17:34,421
a kind of spiritual vertical takeoff 
which you do individually through 

1394
01:17:34,421 --> 01:17:38,920
meditation.
You can liberate yourself from 

1395
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,141
reincarnation and delusion and so forth 
into absorption in the one and the 

1396
01:17:41,141 --> 01:17:44,090
absolute.
But it's an individual vertical takeoff.

1397
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,480
And I was working in an agricultural 
institute,

1398
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:52,570
the main International Institute in 
India for trying to improve crops for 

1399
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:57,290
poor farmers.
And sometimes my Indian colleagues would

1400
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,650
say to me after work,
we always say,

1401
01:17:59,651 --> 01:18:01,040
why do you do this?
And I'd say,

1402
01:18:01,041 --> 01:18:04,390
because you know,
I want to help these poor people and you

1403
01:18:04,391 --> 01:18:06,120
know,
they haven't got enough to eat it.

1404
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:08,480
Be Great.
If they had better farming methods.

1405
01:18:08,481 --> 01:18:11,660
And improve for artists and science can 
help,

1406
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:14,670
and I believe in trying to apply my 
knowledge to help these people.

1407
01:18:14,671 --> 01:18:16,850
And he said,
it is none of your business.

1408
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:17,930
It,
they are poor.

1409
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:19,910
If they are suffering,
it is that cardamom.

1410
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:22,190
It is not your business.
It is their problem,

1411
01:18:22,310 --> 01:18:27,310
not your problem.
Your problem is to liberate yourself 

1412
01:18:27,310 --> 01:18:31,001
from this world of illusion.
So then I realized actually they have a 

1413
01:18:31,001 --> 01:18:35,771
completely different view that it's the 
poor suffering because in a sense they 

1414
01:18:35,781 --> 01:18:39,170
deserve to suffer because of what 
they've done in past lives.

1415
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:43,310
Nothing I can do about it.
Then I realized actually I do care about

1416
01:18:43,311 --> 01:18:48,311
other people.
I do think that a spiritual life is not 

1417
01:18:48,311 --> 01:18:50,870
just about individual liberation.
It's to do with collective things,

1418
01:18:50,871 --> 01:18:54,920
is to do it affects community.
And how can other people be helped?

1419
01:18:56,090 --> 01:19:01,090
Unless I argued with my Hindu friends.
I realized the reason I was saying this 

1420
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:02,630
is because I'm so deeply embedded in the
Christian tradition.

1421
01:19:03,050 --> 01:19:08,050
Even secular humanism is a kind of 
secularized Christianity because it's 

1422
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:09,310
about helping others.
Uh,

1423
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:10,910
that actually,
um,

1424
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:14,210
I was much more Christian than I 
actually had ever admitted.

1425
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:19,211
So I was confirmed in the Church of 
south India and I then found a fantastic

1426
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:23,480
ashram where I lived for two years,
father bede griffiths,

1427
01:19:23,481 --> 01:19:26,930
who is an English Benedictine now to 
Christian Ashram in south India,

1428
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:31,670
which was exactly to my taste.
It was very simple.

1429
01:19:32,030 --> 01:19:34,040
We did yoga,
we did meditation.

1430
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,050
Um,
we,

1431
01:19:36,051 --> 01:19:41,051
uh,
we had Christian services and we sang 

1432
01:19:41,051 --> 01:19:44,651
Indian chants and curtains and things.
It didn't try and deny any of this.

1433
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:50,710
And when I first went there,
we started the mass with the gaietry 

1434
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:51,470
mantra,
which is a Hindu mantra,

1435
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:56,800
asking the sun to bless our meditation,
the divine splendor of the sun to 

1436
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:01,331
illuminate our meditation.
So I said to father bede when I first 

1437
01:20:01,331 --> 01:20:05,561
went there,
now how can you have the gaietry mantra 

1438
01:20:05,561 --> 01:20:08,010
at the beginning of a Catholic service?
And he said,

1439
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:11,850
precisely because it's Catholic,
he said Catholic means universal.

1440
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,600
If it excludes anything,
which is a path to God,

1441
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:19,980
then it's just sectarian.
The word Catholic means universal.

1442
01:20:19,981 --> 01:20:21,280
Yes.
That's what he's fascinating.

1443
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:22,860
Yes.
So,

1444
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:24,450
um,
uh,

1445
01:20:24,570 --> 01:20:29,570
so I found a way of being Christian 
which didn't Deny Yoga,

1446
01:20:31,531 --> 01:20:33,180
meditation,
Buddhism,

1447
01:20:33,181 --> 01:20:36,270
my wife has a practicing Tibetan 
Buddhist,

1448
01:20:36,271 --> 01:20:39,930
she follows us.
I'll Chen tradition in Tibetan Buddhism.

1449
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:46,880
So I found a way of reconnecting with 
the Christian tradition which didn't 

1450
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:51,741
violate my sense of reason.
It didn't conflict with the kind of 

1451
01:20:51,741 --> 01:20:54,720
science that I'm interested in,
but I found it liberating to reconnect.

1452
01:20:54,721 --> 01:20:57,240
And so when I went back to England from 
India,

1453
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:02,700
um,
I was able to go to those great 

1454
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:05,930
cathedrals that we have in England.
Belt in the middle ages is fantastic 

1455
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:06,690
buildings,
stained glass,

1456
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:09,720
wonderful music organs playing amazing 
choirs,

1457
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:14,670
singing the most beautiful music and,
and feel that this is not just beautiful

1458
01:21:14,671 --> 01:21:19,671
but meaningful and as a,
as a path to God which had not seen 

1459
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:19,671
before.

1460
01:21:19,671 --> 01:21:23,200
That's fascinating.
So in India,

1461
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:28,350
the concept of Karma being that someone 
has done something in their past life 

1462
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:29,500
that's led them to where they are right 
now,

1463
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:34,880
that boy that seems real convenient for 
someone passing by homeless people or 

1464
01:21:37,061 --> 01:21:42,061
someone who's poor or suffering.
It's almost like the numbers of people 

1465
01:21:42,971 --> 01:21:45,610
that they have in India.
Because the numbers are so great,

1466
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:50,680
a billion people.
How much bigger is India than in North 

1467
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:50,680
America?

1468
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:51,620
Oh,
the size of the land.

1469
01:21:51,660 --> 01:21:56,050
As much smaller.
The population is almost a billion.

1470
01:21:56,140 --> 01:21:57,880
How much smaller is the size of the 
land?

1471
01:21:57,910 --> 01:22:00,250
I don't know,
but it's crazy.

1472
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:07,200
I wonder if that came about as just a 
way of mitigating the pressure of 

1473
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:10,900
helping people.
Like just the idea of Karma.

1474
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:13,090
You can't help that guy.
That's his problem.

1475
01:22:13,091 --> 01:22:15,850
You gotta do it yourself.
Just the sheer numbers.

1476
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:21,040
Like what I do.
I mean at the time the British were 

1477
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:23,681
ruling India.
There are only about 200 million and 

1478
01:22:23,681 --> 01:22:25,320
when I was born the robot to 50 million 
when you were born.

1479
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:29,060
I was born in 1942.
They did a lot of huge,

1480
01:22:29,120 --> 01:22:33,590
huge increase increase.
Wow.

1481
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:36,650
Anyway,
the thing is about the convenience.

1482
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:39,680
The Karma thing in India uses.
It is convenient.

1483
01:22:39,681 --> 01:22:42,680
For for centuries India's had a caste 
system.

1484
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:48,420
The untouchables are treated like dirt.
I mean they're considered to be 

1485
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:52,211
polluting and dirty.
Even if the shadow of an untouchable 

1486
01:22:52,211 --> 01:22:56,051
fell on the brahmins house,
this person could be punished very 

1487
01:22:56,051 --> 01:22:59,831
various severity and there was no move 
within India until the 19th century to 

1488
01:23:01,731 --> 01:23:06,731
reform that.
What happened with Christian 

1489
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,531
missionaries went there.
They were nice to untouchables and to 

1490
01:23:08,531 --> 01:23:10,150
lower costs and,
and it gave them food,

1491
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,740
education,
healthcare,

1492
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:13,690
et cetera.
And some of them became Christians.

1493
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:15,220
I mean,
why not?

1494
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:20,490
If you're at the bottom of the pile,
you've not got anything to lose and 

1495
01:23:20,490 --> 01:23:20,950
you've got a lot to gain by becoming a 
Christian.

1496
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:26,460
So Hindu reformers felt that they had 
contractors and so things like the 

1497
01:23:26,831 --> 01:23:31,831
Ramakrishna mission and Sri Aurobindo 
and various Hindu philosophers and Gandy

1498
01:23:32,321 --> 01:23:33,670
himself,
uh,

1499
01:23:33,671 --> 01:23:38,671
who was a big influence in India,
assimilated many of these ideas from 

1500
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:38,671
Christianity and said,
look,

1501
01:23:38,671 --> 01:23:43,621
we've got to reform hinduism.
And they created a new kind of Hindu 

1502
01:23:43,621 --> 01:23:45,430
attitude,
much influenced by Christianity.

1503
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:50,640
And so there are no Indian movements to 
try and help the poor and no provide 

1504
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:52,150
health care for the sick and that kind 
of thing.

1505
01:23:52,420 --> 01:23:56,140
But that's not been part of their 
traditional way of doing things.

1506
01:23:56,141 --> 01:23:58,150
And it came about under Western 
influence.

1507
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:03,400
That's really fascinating.
So your desire to sort of help help 

1508
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:07,661
these people,
help them grow more food and help help 

1509
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:09,950
them live better lives is what led you 
to become a Christian.

1510
01:24:09,951 --> 01:24:12,260
You realize that these are Christian 
ideas?

1511
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,310
Yes.
That they are Christian.

1512
01:24:14,311 --> 01:24:17,900
They're deeply embedded in our culture.
Even for secular humanists,

1513
01:24:17,901 --> 01:24:22,901
you see St Louis humanness,
so usually atheists who believe in a 

1514
01:24:23,401 --> 01:24:28,401
philosophy of equal rights,
equal opportunities in helping the poor 

1515
01:24:28,401 --> 01:24:30,910
and the sick education for those who 
need know for,

1516
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:32,080
for,
for everyone.

1517
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:34,860
And um,
uplifting people who are suffering,

1518
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:39,861
helping third world countries have 
running water and all that kind of 

1519
01:24:39,861 --> 01:24:39,861
thing.
Well,

1520
01:24:39,861 --> 01:24:41,580
these are the things that Christian 
missionaries have done as well,

1521
01:24:41,581 --> 01:24:44,310
but you don't have to be a Christian to 
believe in those things,

1522
01:24:44,311 --> 01:24:47,190
but the fact that they are so deeply 
embedded in our culture,

1523
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:50,940
uh,
in our secular culture is because of the

1524
01:24:50,941 --> 01:24:53,490
influence historically influence of 
Christianity.

1525
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:57,570
So secular humanists are basically 
people who still have Christian ethics,

1526
01:24:57,990 --> 01:25:02,990
but without a belief in God.
But that ethical system doesn't just 

1527
01:25:03,811 --> 01:25:08,310
come about automatically.
A much more default mode is to say,

1528
01:25:08,311 --> 01:25:09,640
you know,
the strong miters,

1529
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:10,440
right,
the,

1530
01:25:10,590 --> 01:25:13,060
you know,
the strongest guy gets the girls and,

1531
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:18,080
and you know,
runs a kind of theme and then conquer 

1532
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:20,640
people and have slaves.
That's how humanities worked for much of

1533
01:25:20,641 --> 01:25:21,480
human history.

1534
01:25:21,610 --> 01:25:22,390
Yeah.
Yeah.

1535
01:25:22,410 --> 01:25:23,230
It,
most certainly has.

1536
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:28,470
So this,
it sounds like you found a very cool 

1537
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:30,130
sect of Christianity while you were in 
India.

1538
01:25:30,131 --> 01:25:35,131
I mean,
that sounds very unique that you were 

1539
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:37,831
doing yoga and meditation and then these
Indian chants all along with this 

1540
01:25:39,521 --> 01:25:44,521
concept of Christianity being like the,
the generosity and the helping your 

1541
01:25:45,041 --> 01:25:48,830
brothers and sisters along with that 
seems to be like that.

1542
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:52,870
That must have been very convenient to 
find that sect of Christianity while you

1543
01:25:52,871 --> 01:25:54,910
were sort of exploring these ideas.

1544
01:25:55,080 --> 01:26:00,080
It wasn't even the sect.
Griffis was a benedictine monk and he 

1545
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,521
was a Roman Catholic.
Now it's true that some people in the 

1546
01:26:03,521 --> 01:26:04,820
Catholic Church didn't approve of what 
he was doing,

1547
01:26:04,821 --> 01:26:06,180
but,
but,

1548
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:07,440
uh,
so it was really just him.

1549
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:10,040
It was well here,
Amanda Group of other people.

1550
01:26:10,041 --> 01:26:11,480
I mean,
there was a whole movement in,

1551
01:26:11,770 --> 01:26:15,980
in India of Catholics too.
It was called inculturation.

1552
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,030
It was the second Vatican council in the
19 sixties,

1553
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,360
uh,
said that what people should do in the 

1554
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,470
Catholic church is put the Christian 
faith into the terms of that culture.

1555
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:32,471
So in India,
Catholics who have been converted by 

1556
01:26:32,471 --> 01:26:33,710
Catholic missionaries from Ireland and 
places,

1557
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,980
um,
bought pairs of shoes so he can put them

1558
01:26:36,981 --> 01:26:41,981
on to go to church on Sundays because 
the mission is dressed in western 

1559
01:26:41,981 --> 01:26:44,570
clothes and wore shoes in church.
These Indians would never wear shoes and

1560
01:26:44,571 --> 01:26:46,730
a temple or a mosque or even in the 
house,

1561
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:51,970
but they will choose in church because 
that's what the Catholic missionaries 

1562
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:53,270
wall,
that kind of thing is ridiculous.

1563
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:57,020
And so the simplest level,
the incarceration movement,

1564
01:26:57,021 --> 01:26:57,560
we say,
well,

1565
01:26:58,040 --> 01:27:03,040
it's the tradition of injuries.
Take your shoes off in homes and in 

1566
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:03,040
temples,
in marks.

1567
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:07,130
So you take them off in churches tune.
And it was the tradition of Holy Men and

1568
01:27:08,151 --> 01:27:12,890
women in Nto to be vegetarian.
Whereas Catholics and Protestants,

1569
01:27:12,891 --> 01:27:17,891
they're all eating lots of beef and 
stuff because that's what American and 

1570
01:27:17,891 --> 01:27:18,300
British missionaries at.
Um,

1571
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,550
and so they said,
no,

1572
01:27:19,551 --> 01:27:22,820
it's much more natural to be vegetarian.
You don't have to be,

1573
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:27,821
but it's more natural.
So this idea of yoga is a way of 

1574
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,280
learning how to breathe and to challenge
and to be more healthy.

1575
01:27:31,670 --> 01:27:34,490
Why shouldn't Indian Christians do yoga?
Right?

1576
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:39,580
So this is part of a movement.
Father Bede was part of a wider 

1577
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:42,521
movement.
The last two popes had been rather 

1578
01:27:42,521 --> 01:27:43,010
reactionary and you've tried to roll 
back that movement,

1579
01:27:43,011 --> 01:27:48,011
but there are still people in India,
in South America and so on who are 

1580
01:27:48,011 --> 01:27:50,930
following this Vatican second Vatican 
Council reform movement,

1581
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:52,610
or the new pope is fairly unique.

1582
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:57,610
His name,
he seems to be a or a much less 

1583
01:27:57,610 --> 01:28:00,800
polarizing figure.
He seems to be much more generous,

1584
01:28:00,801 --> 01:28:05,801
much more open minded to the idea of 
homosexuality to a lot of the things 

1585
01:28:05,801 --> 01:28:10,801
that have been criticized in the past.
And he also like he's showing the ideas 

1586
01:28:10,881 --> 01:28:15,881
of monetary wealth.
He doesn't have that crazy thrown 

1587
01:28:15,881 --> 01:28:15,890
anymore.
He has a reasonable chair.

1588
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:17,810
He's a,
he's a unique guy.

1589
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:20,870
I think it's partly because he comes 
from South America,

1590
01:28:20,871 --> 01:28:24,020
you see and do this kind of radical 
Catholic movement.

1591
01:28:24,050 --> 01:28:27,590
The Second Vatican Council Liberation 
Theology,

1592
01:28:27,591 --> 01:28:32,591
which was about the church should be,
they're not serve the rich but to help 

1593
01:28:32,591 --> 01:28:34,490
the poor.
And this became a huge movement in South

1594
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:35,140
America.
Um,

1595
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,230
but uh,
the,

1596
01:28:37,570 --> 01:28:40,610
the previous Pope John Paul,
the second was against it because he,

1597
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:45,710
they were teaming up with communists and
people who are also trying to help the 

1598
01:28:45,710 --> 01:28:47,510
poor for secular reasons and political 
reasons,

1599
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:52,840
not for Christian reasons.
So he said this is wrong because it 

1600
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,320
communistic,
but actually that movement,

1601
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:58,400
there's this radical Catholic movements 
had a huge influence in South America.

1602
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:02,070
And I think the present pope is somebody
who's come out

1603
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,070
of that world who's been very much 
influenced by it.

1604
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,270
It's so problematic though.
The suppressing his sexuality like that.

1605
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:14,300
The number one thing that people 
associate Catholicism width is sexual 

1606
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:18,921
assault is sexually molesting children.
That's like a huge aspect.

1607
01:29:19,051 --> 01:29:22,860
I grew up a Catholic.
I was only in,

1608
01:29:23,120 --> 01:29:26,130
I was a practicing Catholic when I was 
very young.

1609
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,400
I went to a Catholic school in New 
Jersey for first grade and it was a very

1610
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:34,880
bad schools,
like really dark and suppressing,

1611
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:40,250
just very nasty and mean,
and the nuns were just horrific people 

1612
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:44,850
and essentially shied me away from all 
religion at a very young age before 

1613
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:45,870
then.
Yeah,

1614
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:47,190
it was terrible.
It was terrible.

1615
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:52,370
But I have other friends that were also 
raised Catholic that literally had to 

1616
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:56,840
fight off the priests sexual attempts 
and that this is like a standard thing.

1617
01:29:57,121 --> 01:30:00,270
If it's a joke,
it's an on running joke in America about

1618
01:30:00,780 --> 01:30:02,940
priests being sexual predators.

1619
01:30:02,940 --> 01:30:05,240
It's a constant thing.
Um,

1620
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:11,130
that,
that seems to me like one of the number 

1621
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:11,520
one issues with that particular brand of
religion.

1622
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:16,730
It's like this idea that you're gonna 
take what is essentially just a natural 

1623
01:30:16,730 --> 01:30:20,811
part of being a human being.
You're not doing anything with the 

1624
01:30:20,811 --> 01:30:21,690
reproductive cycle.
You're just telling them to ignore it.

1625
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:26,400
You have this consistent,
constant bodily function.

1626
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:31,320
There's your body's reproducing fluids 
on a regular basis and you living backed

1627
01:30:31,321 --> 01:30:36,321
up all the time.
And also you're not experiencing any 

1628
01:30:36,321 --> 01:30:38,070
romantic interaction with human beings.
No.

1629
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:41,510
No affection,
no sexual affection,

1630
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:42,330
no nothing,
no,

1631
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:46,740
you're missing out on a huge part of 
what it is to be a person.

1632
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:52,040
And these people grow up and they live 
cradle to the grave in this sort of 

1633
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:56,370
weird non developed state.
You know,

1634
01:30:56,371 --> 01:31:00,060
they're not like the rest of the people.
They can barely even understand.

1635
01:31:00,180 --> 01:31:05,180
Like I had a friend that went to 
marriage counseling with a Catholic 

1636
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:06,340
priest.
I'm my.

1637
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:10,150
That's hilarious.
That's like going to Hitler and,

1638
01:31:10,151 --> 01:31:12,090
uh,
asking how to have world peace and maybe

1639
01:31:12,110 --> 01:31:13,260
it doesn't make any sense.
Like,

1640
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:18,280
what do you,
how are you going to a guy who not only 

1641
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,110
does not have any sex,
has never had a relationship but is 

1642
01:31:21,110 --> 01:31:25,281
drunk all the time.
He had gin blossoms all over his face 

1643
01:31:25,281 --> 01:31:28,280
and kids run away from them because 
they're afraid it's going to touch them 

1644
01:31:28,280 --> 01:31:29,190
and you're going to go to that guy and 
he's going to give you marriage advice.

1645
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:33,540
I agree.
I think it's a terrible thing and I mean

1646
01:31:33,541 --> 01:31:35,850
there are a lot of good priests who 
don't do this.

1647
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:41,210
And I met quite a few windows in India 
and I have reverend Catholic priests 

1648
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:43,280
whose friends and so I think it's a 
minority.

1649
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:46,920
It may have been quite a big minority in
Ireland and in some countries,

1650
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:52,460
but I think it was a,
some people are called to a celibate 

1651
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:55,821
life and,
and I think that's fine for people to 

1652
01:31:55,821 --> 01:31:55,821
get become monks or nuns if that's what 
they're called to.

1653
01:31:55,821 --> 01:31:59,010
But for regular priests,
I think it's a serious mistake.

1654
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:00,360
And I'm

1655
01:32:01,630 --> 01:32:06,630
in the Church of England ever since 15,
40 or something and in the process and 

1656
01:32:06,630 --> 01:32:11,581
churches in Europe,
priests have been able to marry and 

1657
01:32:11,581 --> 01:32:12,400
rabbis Mary in Judaism and I think is 
much,

1658
01:32:12,401 --> 01:32:15,910
much healthier to have priests as 
regular guys.

1659
01:32:15,911 --> 01:32:20,911
We love lives and kids and things.
So I think that side of Catholicism is a

1660
01:32:21,551 --> 01:32:23,670
serious mistake and I think they should 
do it.

1661
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:28,800
Sooner or later it'll have to be 
reformed because repression of sexuality

1662
01:32:29,050 --> 01:32:33,370
leads to all these extremely unhealthy.
A negative consequences.

1663
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:35,230
No,
I agree with you about it.

1664
01:32:36,400 --> 01:32:41,400
But you know,
there are reform movements within 

1665
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:41,980
Catholicism and uh,
they're in America.

1666
01:32:41,981 --> 01:32:46,390
They're a breakaway Catholic.
Churches with women priests for example,

1667
01:32:46,391 --> 01:32:49,720
there's one in Santa Barbara and of 
course it's in Santa Barbara,

1668
01:32:50,130 --> 01:32:52,510
freaks up.
They're loaded.

1669
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:54,370
So,
um,

1670
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,940
this,
um,

1671
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:57,430
anyway,
I agree with you.

1672
01:32:57,431 --> 01:32:59,920
I think that's a very negative thing,
but you see,

1673
01:32:59,921 --> 01:33:03,370
I think that to,
to reject the entire,

1674
01:33:03,430 --> 01:33:08,430
some people reject the entire world of 
religion because of personal bad 

1675
01:33:08,430 --> 01:33:09,790
experiences with one particular brand.

1676
01:33:09,790 --> 01:33:12,510
I think it's rather like throwing out 
the baby with the bath water.

1677
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:17,720
It would be like saying I'm against 
science because it gave us gas that 

1678
01:33:17,720 --> 01:33:21,160
kittle used to kill people and it gave 
us the atomic bomb that killed people in

1679
01:33:21,161 --> 01:33:22,930
Hiroshima.
So I'm against science.

1680
01:33:23,290 --> 01:33:25,000
I mean science,
everything,

1681
01:33:25,001 --> 01:33:25,790
human,
uh,

1682
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:30,970
there are really bad things that have 
been done by humans in the name of 

1683
01:33:30,970 --> 01:33:32,460
almost anything you care to mention.
Nationalism,

1684
01:33:32,461 --> 01:33:34,120
science,
religion,

1685
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,340
politics,
ideology.

1686
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:41,790
So when you decided to join this 
particular group of Christians and 

1687
01:33:43,361 --> 01:33:46,870
become a Christian,
officially identify,

1688
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:49,390
was there resistance from your 
colleagues?

1689
01:33:49,391 --> 01:33:51,190
Reserve resistance from other 
scientists?

1690
01:33:51,191 --> 01:33:53,140
Like how old were you at the time?
Oh,

1691
01:33:53,141 --> 01:33:58,030
I was 33,
something like that.

1692
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,040
Um,
well,

1693
01:34:00,041 --> 01:34:02,170
not among.
I was working in India at the time.

1694
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,500
There's hardly any acs in India.
There's a few,

1695
01:34:05,501 --> 01:34:09,460
but among my scientific colleagues,
I was working with Indian scientists.

1696
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:13,540
Almost all Indians are Hindu,
Hindu or Muslim,

1697
01:34:13,541 --> 01:34:15,010
you know,
when they went home from work,

1698
01:34:15,011 --> 01:34:17,520
they'd be regular Hindus and Muslims 
there.

1699
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:22,510
Very few of them were atheists.
So I'm among my Indian colleagues.

1700
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:28,020
Being a practicing Christian when I came
from a Christian family in a Christian 

1701
01:34:28,020 --> 01:34:31,681
country seemed totally normal.
No one thought that was at all weird or 

1702
01:34:31,681 --> 01:34:35,491
strange when I got back to England.
I'm among many of my scientific friends.

1703
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:41,430
Um,
they thought this was completely weird 

1704
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:45,000
and um,
and just couldn't understand it because 

1705
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:46,720
they assume that any Christian believes 
the world's made in 6,000

1706
01:34:46,721 --> 01:34:51,721
years ago and God intervenes through 
suspending the laws of nature in 

1707
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:56,461
miracles that are totally incredible and
they don't believe in the kind of God I 

1708
01:34:56,461 --> 01:34:57,420
don't believe in.
Um,

1709
01:34:57,990 --> 01:35:02,420
but they never actually,
very few ever asked what do you actually

1710
01:35:02,421 --> 01:35:07,421
think or believe?
They just sort of treated it as best as 

1711
01:35:07,421 --> 01:35:10,490
some kind of personal eccentricity or 
mental feebleness or something.

1712
01:35:10,820 --> 01:35:13,930
Um,
and while retaining,

1713
01:35:13,931 --> 01:35:16,280
rather than narrow dogmatically atheist 
view,

1714
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,610
I lot of my friends are atheists or 
agnostics,

1715
01:35:19,611 --> 01:35:24,611
but the problem I have with atheists and
materialists is that most of them are 

1716
01:35:24,611 --> 01:35:28,220
much more dogmatic than the people I 
know within the religious world.

1717
01:35:28,690 --> 01:35:33,690
Well,
I have a problem with anybody that's 

1718
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:33,690
sure.
So do I.

1719
01:35:33,690 --> 01:35:33,690
Yes.
Uh,

1720
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,070
when,
when I speak to some atheists,

1721
01:35:36,071 --> 01:35:38,800
I have this issue where they're 
aggressively atheist,

1722
01:35:39,180 --> 01:35:40,660
you know,
where you know,

1723
01:35:40,930 --> 01:35:41,540
uh,
I've,

1724
01:35:41,541 --> 01:35:45,460
I've talked to people who the,
they're not just atheist,

1725
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:50,490
but they get upset at anyone who's not.
And my question to them is always like,

1726
01:35:51,671 --> 01:35:53,380
have you ever had a psychedelic 
experience?

1727
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:56,530
Whenever I speak with someone who's 
aggressively atheists,

1728
01:35:56,950 --> 01:36:00,290
and if they say no,
I'm like,

1729
01:36:00,340 --> 01:36:01,420
well,
what are you waiting for?

1730
01:36:01,540 --> 01:36:04,690
Because if you,
if you really want to question your,

1731
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:09,770
your whole idea of reality,
there's no better method than a 

1732
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:14,191
breakthrough psychedelic experience.
If you have a breakthrough psychedelic 

1733
01:36:14,191 --> 01:36:14,590
experience and you're like,
that was nothing,

1734
01:36:15,070 --> 01:36:20,070
well then you're a unique person because
everybody I've ever met that has a 

1735
01:36:20,070 --> 01:36:21,610
breakthrough psychedelic experience,
like a dmt trip.

1736
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:23,800
They have to step back and go,
okay,

1737
01:36:23,801 --> 01:36:25,300
I didn't even know that was possible.

1738
01:36:25,510 --> 01:36:28,750
I've lived my whole life with this one 
worldview that,

1739
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:33,810
well,
I see these people that are religious 

1740
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:36,060
and it seems to me that they're 
following this ridiculous ideology is 

1741
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:38,860
based on some ancient information that 
people wrote down on animal skins.

1742
01:36:38,861 --> 01:36:43,861
It's all preposterous and what they're 
doing is they're just a bunch of scared 

1743
01:36:43,861 --> 01:36:46,981
children that are afraid of the light 
and what I'm doing is basing my life on 

1744
01:36:46,981 --> 01:36:50,311
science and rational thinking and logic,
but then you have a psychedelic trip and

1745
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:52,690
he's like,
there's nothing rational about that.

1746
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:55,660
There's nothing logical about that and 
how's that so close?

1747
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:59,530
It's so nearby.
It's like someone telling you a dmt trip

1748
01:36:59,531 --> 01:37:00,820
is like someone telling you,
Hey,

1749
01:37:01,660 --> 01:37:05,050
I want to show you something.
Let's go into this room real quick,

1750
01:37:05,170 --> 01:37:07,660
and you opened that door and there's a 
new universe.

1751
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:10,870
They're a completely different universe 
that's filled with life.

1752
01:37:10,900 --> 01:37:15,760
It's fractal.
It's never ending and it occupies a very

1753
01:37:15,761 --> 01:37:20,761
small space,
but yet it's infinite and it's filled 

1754
01:37:20,761 --> 01:37:21,210
with conscious beings that can see 
through you.

1755
01:37:21,220 --> 01:37:26,220
Recognize all your bullshit.
Recognize all your insecurities and all 

1756
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:30,661
your incorrect thinking and ego and and,
and they try to and then you shut the 

1757
01:37:30,661 --> 01:37:31,810
door and you go back to regular life and
you're like,

1758
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:34,270
what the fuck is that room?
That room?

1759
01:37:34,271 --> 01:37:35,890
That's the God room.
It's right there.

1760
01:37:36,040 --> 01:37:39,910
Like if you don't go into that 
experience like your whole,

1761
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:45,150
like I think we live our lives based on.
We sort of calculate our worldview based

1762
01:37:47,801 --> 01:37:50,020
on the experiences that we've 
accumulated,

1763
01:37:50,021 --> 01:37:55,021
what we've learned from these 
experiences and what we've learned from 

1764
01:37:55,021 --> 01:37:55,330
other people's experiences,
what we've read,

1765
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:57,900
what we've seen in documentaries and 
films,

1766
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:02,790
but when you have a really intense 
psychedelic experience particularly,

1767
01:38:03,330 --> 01:38:05,760
and then for some people yoga and 
meditation,

1768
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:08,130
some people are able to achieve some 
pretty deep states,

1769
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:11,670
but the psychedelic experience in 
particular is.

1770
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:14,580
It's shocking because it's so easy to 
get to.

1771
01:38:14,910 --> 01:38:19,910
It's just right there.
Four hits of the DMT and boom blast off 

1772
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:24,830
and then 15 minutes later you're left 
with this new experience that you have 

1773
01:38:24,830 --> 01:38:28,740
to assimilate and figure out a way to 
make sense of it.

1774
01:38:29,190 --> 01:38:31,890
The atheist and I talked to that are 
like super aggressive.

1775
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:36,891
They're just like religious people,
people and a lot of ways it's kind of 

1776
01:38:36,891 --> 01:38:41,121
scientific fundamentalism and it's.
It's also morphing now know if you're 

1777
01:38:41,121 --> 01:38:42,450
aware of this.
In America it's morphing,

1778
01:38:42,630 --> 01:38:47,630
there's atheism and then there's an even
more aggressive group called atheism 

1779
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:48,140
plus.
Oh,

1780
01:38:48,190 --> 01:38:49,590
I didn't know about that.
Yeah,

1781
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:54,650
and what they're doing is they're 
attaching a bunch of moral and ethical 

1782
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:58,731
values to religion essentially creating 
almost like another religion and I think

1783
01:38:58,981 --> 01:39:03,981
with good intentions,
I think a lot of his good intentions a 

1784
01:39:03,981 --> 01:39:03,981
lot of is based on.

1785
01:39:03,981 --> 01:39:08,000
A lot of it is based on feminism.
A lot of is based on the idea of 

1786
01:39:08,280 --> 01:39:12,450
avoiding harassment,
avoiding sexual harassment,

1787
01:39:12,451 --> 01:39:17,451
avoiding like that.
They their ethics are to completely 

1788
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:21,870
define what's acceptable behavior like 
no,

1789
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,630
no racism,
no sexual harassment,

1790
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:29,370
no undeniable acceptance of women's 
rights.

1791
01:39:29,371 --> 01:39:32,430
Undeniable acceptance of.
It's interesting,

1792
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:37,700
but then of course once you define that,
then you have a aggressive members of 

1793
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:43,401
that group that are attacking people 
that disagree with any of their 

1794
01:39:43,401 --> 01:39:45,990
propositions or anyone that supports 
men's rights.

1795
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:50,991
Of course now he hates women and you get
a lot of weirdness in that area because 

1796
01:39:50,991 --> 01:39:53,370
they can only be feminism,
that can't be men's rights as well,

1797
01:39:53,670 --> 01:39:56,490
men's rights or toxic,
whereas women's rights,

1798
01:39:56,640 --> 01:40:01,640
once there is a cheat,
once they have achieved a totally 

1799
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:04,911
quality,
then there's no need for men's rights 

1800
01:40:04,911 --> 01:40:05,040
because once feminism has been 
established,

1801
01:40:05,160 --> 01:40:10,160
which is pretty illogical assumption,
especially when you consider like 

1802
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:10,160
divorce laws.

1803
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,480
No,
I agree with you.

1804
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,650
No,
I couldn't agree more about DMT and,

1805
01:40:14,670 --> 01:40:16,910
and the,
the opening that it can give.

1806
01:40:16,911 --> 01:40:21,911
I mean I had the great advantage of 
taking it for the first time with 

1807
01:40:21,911 --> 01:40:25,280
Terence Mckenna and he was,
he said,

1808
01:40:25,400 --> 01:40:28,060
do you want to check this out?
Okay.

1809
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:31,460
And that's pretty cool.
And the resume,

1810
01:40:31,461 --> 01:40:33,170
by the way,
first time you did DMT,

1811
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:35,010
Terence Mckenna?
Yes.

1812
01:40:35,900 --> 01:40:40,900
I won't say where or when,
because it could be put down on some 

1813
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:40,900
record somewhere that's probably already
there.

1814
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:43,750
Don't worry about it.
Um,

1815
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:49,280
but um,
for me it corresponded in many ways with

1816
01:40:49,281 --> 01:40:54,281
what people talk about near death 
experiences because I went out through 

1817
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:57,070
light into a realm of great bliss and 
beauty.

1818
01:40:57,071 --> 01:41:02,071
And then I came back and it was like 
coming back from a million miles away 

1819
01:41:02,071 --> 01:41:05,560
and just coming back into my body and as
it were being born again.

1820
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,440
Um,
so it was,

1821
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:11,590
it was very much like a death and 
rebirth experience for me.

1822
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:13,720
And,
and it was very,

1823
01:41:13,721 --> 01:41:16,030
very transformative.
Um,

1824
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:18,370
incidentally,
I think,

1825
01:41:18,430 --> 01:41:23,430
you know,
I've been trying to understand this 

1826
01:41:23,430 --> 01:41:23,430
American phenomena with southern 
baptists.

1827
01:41:23,530 --> 01:41:28,530
And one of the things that I think is 
the key to this is that I think when 

1828
01:41:28,530 --> 01:41:31,540
they talk about being born again,
originally baptism was just that.

1829
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:35,050
I mean now you can get this through dmt 
in five minutes,

1830
01:41:35,200 --> 01:41:38,530
but at the time of John The baptist,
you get it in five minutes through being

1831
01:41:38,531 --> 01:41:41,290
drowned.
People were lining up on the bank of the

1832
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:42,580
Jordan.
They go in,

1833
01:41:42,640 --> 01:41:45,700
he holds them under.
If he held him under just long enough,

1834
01:41:45,970 --> 01:41:48,700
you could actually induce a near death 
experience.

1835
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:53,740
New Life Review at the drowning man sees
his life pass before him hold the amount

1836
01:41:53,921 --> 01:41:58,921
of just long enough.
And they'd have a near death experience 

1837
01:41:58,921 --> 01:41:59,050
almost guaranteed.
I mean,

1838
01:41:59,051 --> 01:42:01,180
occasionally they might,
he might have done it too long,

1839
01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:03,360
but that was before litigation.
You know,

1840
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:04,320
you might've lost.

1841
01:42:07,490 --> 01:42:10,670
Yeah,
good theory actually.

1842
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,630
Then you see they come back and they 
said,

1843
01:42:12,730 --> 01:42:14,530
I've died.
I've seen the light.

1844
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:17,800
I've been born again.
I'm no longer afraid of death.

1845
01:42:18,010 --> 01:42:22,930
My life has been transformed in five 
minutes and the baptists were the people

1846
01:42:22,931 --> 01:42:27,931
who revived baptism by total immersion 
in the 16th century and probably no in 

1847
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:34,070
in America.
We don't hold them under that long 

1848
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:34,930
because this is post litigation now,
but you know when,

1849
01:42:34,931 --> 01:42:39,931
when the Baptist first got going,
this idea of holding people aren't long 

1850
01:42:39,931 --> 01:42:44,071
enough.
All their language is the language that 

1851
01:42:44,071 --> 01:42:47,281
relates to near death experiences and I 
don't think that to start with baptism 

1852
01:42:47,281 --> 01:42:50,260
by total immersion was just symbolic.
I think it was drowning.

1853
01:42:50,760 --> 01:42:55,760
Wow.
That is quite fascinating and it makes 

1854
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,281
sense.
If you think about ordeal poisoning or 

1855
01:42:58,281 --> 01:43:01,171
deal poisoning being the substitute for 
psychedelics in certain cultures where 

1856
01:43:01,171 --> 01:43:01,440
they don't have access to psychedelic 
plants,

1857
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:04,680
they would take essentially a poison 
that didn't kill you.

1858
01:43:04,830 --> 01:43:08,670
It got you right to the door where you 
wish you were dead almost.

1859
01:43:08,671 --> 01:43:13,671
You were in horrible pain and even in 
some cultures they use ant venom like 

1860
01:43:13,671 --> 01:43:14,470
those bullet ants,
the.

1861
01:43:14,550 --> 01:43:19,500
They use that for these ritualistic a 
coming of age rituals,

1862
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:24,740
these coming of age rituals where you 
take people through these intensely 

1863
01:43:24,740 --> 01:43:28,500
painful moments where they almost want 
to be dead just to end the suffering and

1864
01:43:28,501 --> 01:43:30,000
then when they come through and the 
other side,

1865
01:43:30,001 --> 01:43:32,910
there are a better person because of it.
They're more reflective.

1866
01:43:32,911 --> 01:43:35,820
They're sort of there.
They appreciate that.

1867
01:43:35,821 --> 01:43:38,160
Just the very breath that they're 
allowed to take.

1868
01:43:38,161 --> 01:43:42,120
They appreciate the sky seems bluer.
The grass seems greener.

1869
01:43:42,121 --> 01:43:46,200
The life has more vibrancy to it because
they've gone through this ordeal.

1870
01:43:46,201 --> 01:43:48,810
Poison or these toxic venom or what have
you.

1871
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:50,670
Yes,
a right of passage.

1872
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:51,980
Almost all rites

1873
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,880
of passage for adolescents in,
in,

1874
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:58,930
in traditional cultures involved 
something like a death and rebirth 

1875
01:43:58,930 --> 01:44:02,291
experience and I think you're right.
I think that's what's going on and 

1876
01:44:02,291 --> 01:44:06,281
actually I think that the why the 
Baptist became so powerful and why for 

1877
01:44:06,281 --> 01:44:10,241
them the conversion experience was so 
real and why they talk about it so much 

1878
01:44:10,241 --> 01:44:11,630
is that because for many of them it was 
real.

1879
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:16,930
It wasn't just a symbolic thing.
It wasn't signing up to some set of 

1880
01:44:16,930 --> 01:44:21,191
beliefs and I think this is the core of 
all religions is this direct experience 

1881
01:44:21,191 --> 01:44:24,380
of the divine and you know,
I think that's what they all come from.

1882
01:44:24,381 --> 01:44:26,390
They come from experience,
not theories.

1883
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:27,310
What's quite

1884
01:44:27,430 --> 01:44:32,430
shocking to that.
Jerusalem scholars like may like 

1885
01:44:32,430 --> 01:44:36,120
mainstream scholars now or considering 
that Moses was probably under the 

1886
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:39,190
influence of DMT.
They believed that the burning Bush,

1887
01:44:39,220 --> 01:44:40,020
there's,
you know,

1888
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:42,160
guys are not like psychedelically based 
at all,

1889
01:44:42,430 --> 01:44:47,430
was quite probably the Acacia Bush,
which was a very rich in dmt plant and 

1890
01:44:48,510 --> 01:44:50,260
that's the whole idea of the burning 
Bush.

1891
01:44:50,410 --> 01:44:52,360
He sees God through a burning Bush.
I mean,

1892
01:44:52,510 --> 01:44:56,490
how much clear does it have to be?
There's acacia trees all over that.

1893
01:44:56,520 --> 01:45:01,520
That part of the world.
It says very rich plant as far as the 

1894
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,330
content of DMT in it and if you 
experience that,

1895
01:45:04,480 --> 01:45:06,160
it's very much like.
I mean,

1896
01:45:06,161 --> 01:45:11,161
I don't know if you're experiencing God,
but it seems like it seems very divine 

1897
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:14,230
when you have a dmt trip.

1898
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,720
Yes.
Well,

1899
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:19,530
I mean why not be experiencing God?
I mean,

1900
01:45:19,531 --> 01:45:24,531
it seems unlike.
It seems non economical theory to say 

1901
01:45:24,531 --> 01:45:25,860
that this divine bliss as experienced by
mystics,

1902
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:28,260
that part of the nature of mind is 
bliss.

1903
01:45:28,261 --> 01:45:33,261
I mean the Hindu name,
one of the names sachit and ended up 

1904
01:45:33,261 --> 01:45:35,910
being knowledge place as in the nature 
of God.

1905
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:39,540
If God's consciousness is kind of 
blessed consciousness,

1906
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:43,830
then if you have this experience that 
seems like garden is blissful,

1907
01:45:45,270 --> 01:45:50,270
why have a hypothesis that that some 
other bliss consciousness that isn't 

1908
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:51,330
divine,
that some kind of duplicate,

1909
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:53,310
why not?
It'd be the real thing.

1910
01:45:53,311 --> 01:45:55,440
I think it makes so much more sense.
Yeah,

1911
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:56,760
totally makes sense.
I mean it,

1912
01:45:57,060 --> 01:46:01,410
it makes as much sense as anything else 
and these plants are real.

1913
01:46:01,860 --> 01:46:05,400
I've always wondered if that and many 
other people speculator as well,

1914
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:10,610
if that's the reason why Hindus don't 
participate in eating cows too because 

1915
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:14,961
of the psilocybin mushrooms growing on 
cows on a regular basis and that being 

1916
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:16,770
for a lot of people believe that basis

1917
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:19,260
Soma.
I don't know.

1918
01:46:19,261 --> 01:46:20,070
It's,
it's,

1919
01:46:20,100 --> 01:46:25,100
I'm don't terrence's theory about Strip 
area and these mushrooms growing on car 

1920
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:29,010
dung is okay as far as it goes.
But in England,

1921
01:46:29,011 --> 01:46:29,930
for example,
the,

1922
01:46:29,931 --> 01:46:34,931
the magic mushroom,
the liberty cap doesn't grow on car 

1923
01:46:34,931 --> 01:46:38,660
dying at grows in sort of meadows and 
usually no carson if anything,

1924
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:41,460
the sheep,
but I've seen them.

1925
01:46:41,490 --> 01:46:46,490
They grow wild in Wales and I've 
encountered them on location and there's

1926
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:52,340
nothing to do with piles of Dung.
I mean there's many different 

1927
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:53,100
environments in which psychoactive 
mushrooms grow.

1928
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:57,870
Some kinds rely on the car done,
but I think he rather over emphasize the

1929
01:46:57,871 --> 01:46:58,530
car dunk.

1930
01:46:58,650 --> 01:47:03,650
That's fascinating.
What do you think was the source of 

1931
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:06,380
cattle worship like Chuck Tall Oak and 
all these ancient civilizations that 

1932
01:47:06,380 --> 01:47:09,470
worship cattle and this connection that 
Mckenna made with,

1933
01:47:09,471 --> 01:47:10,260
uh,
those,

1934
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:15,310
those people worshiping the capital 
because the cattle didn't just provide 

1935
01:47:15,310 --> 01:47:16,260
life and food because they had milk and 
meat,

1936
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:20,580
but also that there was this connection 
with a psychedelic mushrooms.

1937
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:24,430
I take now,
I find that a bit far fetched personally

1938
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:26,830
in some countries like in England and 
Oh,

1939
01:47:26,950 --> 01:47:31,950
there was a whole sweatshop in the cage.
There was a whole sweatshop sacred 

1940
01:47:31,950 --> 01:47:33,230
horses too.
And um,

1941
01:47:34,460 --> 01:47:36,520
there,
there are many different kinds of sacred

1942
01:47:36,521 --> 01:47:40,390
animal even in India is not just caused 
the to sacred elephants are sacred.

1943
01:47:40,540 --> 01:47:41,790
Ganesh shoes,
you know,

1944
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,840
the elephant God.
But elephants are sacred.

1945
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:47,950
Even rats are sacred.
I'm in India and monkeys,

1946
01:47:48,370 --> 01:47:50,560
so lots.
There's lots of sacred animals.

1947
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:53,280
Um,
and I think that probably come,

1948
01:47:53,750 --> 01:47:58,750
I think with the ones that are wild,
basically wild like elephants and rats 

1949
01:47:58,931 --> 01:48:03,931
and monkeys.
There's probably comes out to shamanic 

1950
01:48:03,931 --> 01:48:07,201
roots,
but I think when people started 

1951
01:48:07,201 --> 01:48:09,540
domesticating animals then know,
how do you relate to domesticated 

1952
01:48:10,241 --> 01:48:15,241
animals?
Are they like slaves or are they the cow

1953
01:48:16,031 --> 01:48:18,280
is seen by most induces the divine 
mother,

1954
01:48:18,281 --> 01:48:19,490
the provider of milk.

1955
01:48:19,490 --> 01:48:24,490
And do you regard them as sacred or do 
you just regard them as cogs in a 

1956
01:48:24,490 --> 01:48:24,640
factory farming machine?
Well,

1957
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:27,490
that's the way they are regarded now in 
feed lots and so on,

1958
01:48:27,491 --> 01:48:30,500
in the United States and in Europe.
Um,

1959
01:48:31,780 --> 01:48:35,140
but I think in a religious culture when 
you domesticate animals,

1960
01:48:35,141 --> 01:48:38,140
there's a sense in which they take on a 
religious significance.

1961
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:39,470
And,
um,

1962
01:48:40,250 --> 01:48:41,960
you know,
for,

1963
01:48:42,010 --> 01:48:47,010
for the Jewish people,
then goats and sheep were the main ones 

1964
01:48:47,010 --> 01:48:48,230
that took on the religious significance.
You know,

1965
01:48:48,520 --> 01:48:51,730
Jesus Lamb of God that takes away the 
sins of the world.

1966
01:48:51,731 --> 01:48:53,360
The Agnes de,
um,

1967
01:48:53,620 --> 01:48:57,520
this is a sacrificial lamb which is a 
sort of sacred lamb.

1968
01:48:57,850 --> 01:49:01,180
And so there's a synchronization of 
sheep in the Judaic Christian,

1969
01:49:01,181 --> 01:49:02,500
in the Islamic tradition.

1970
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:08,520
It completely makes sense that people 
would worship cows and even horses 

1971
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,350
because they need the horses for 
transportation.

1972
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,970
Um,
you know,

1973
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:15,720
in a lot of cultures they even used 
horses to stay alive.

1974
01:49:15,721 --> 01:49:19,920
Like they drank the blood of the horses.
That was a big thing with the Mongols.

1975
01:49:19,921 --> 01:49:22,800
It's one of the reasons why they.
They brought like you know each.

1976
01:49:23,010 --> 01:49:28,010
Each man had many horses that they would
carry with them and they would mix it 

1977
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:28,680
with milk and it would be a way to stay 
alive.

1978
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:32,550
May or may would take the blood of a 
certain horses,

1979
01:49:32,551 --> 01:49:35,760
the milk of other ones and all that.
Makes Sense.

1980
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:39,570
What I've always wondered those,
how did they,

1981
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:44,100
how did they lose the meaning of Soma?
Like how do,

1982
01:49:44,130 --> 01:49:46,500
how is that such a,
an open thing?

1983
01:49:46,560 --> 01:49:48,520
Open interpretation.
I mean what?

1984
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:51,250
What happened to if it was such an 
amazing thing.

1985
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:53,950
I mean you read the descriptions of 
Salma,

1986
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:57,840
how fantastic it is and how huge a part 
of it.

1987
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:01,180
It wasn't their culture and their 
connection to the divine.

1988
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:03,400
How did they lose what it means,

1989
01:50:03,970 --> 01:50:06,760
but I agree.
I think it's a mystery and it's seminary

1990
01:50:06,830 --> 01:50:11,830
increased the Eleusinian mysteries.
This cave where they went in these 

1991
01:50:11,830 --> 01:50:14,310
psychedelic rites of passage that Plato 
and people here.

1992
01:50:14,311 --> 01:50:16,350
There was a big part of life in ancient 
Greece.

1993
01:50:16,890 --> 01:50:19,370
What was that and the,
the,

1994
01:50:19,430 --> 01:50:22,770
the most commentaries ones where people 
see it as Amnesia,

1995
01:50:22,780 --> 01:50:23,850
Mascara,
the flyer,

1996
01:50:23,851 --> 01:50:28,851
garrick.
I've never found those particularly 

1997
01:50:28,851 --> 01:50:29,520
plausible because whenever I've taken 
flyer garrick where he wants so twice,

1998
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:32,200
all it did was give me a headache and 
um,

1999
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:35,010
it's maybe they had different varieties 
of it,

2000
01:50:35,011 --> 01:50:38,760
but I don't know anyone who's had a 
totally amazing flyer,

2001
01:50:38,761 --> 01:50:39,360
garrick trip.

2002
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:41,330
I've only spoken to people online that 
have,

2003
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:46,390
I've,
I've only had it once and I felt the 

2004
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:46,390
same way.
It didn't do anything for me.

2005
01:50:46,390 --> 01:50:47,870
I,
I don't know if it enhanced,

2006
01:50:47,871 --> 01:50:52,871
but I did it and then we did it for a 
couple hours and it didn't seem to have 

2007
01:50:52,871 --> 01:50:56,741
any effect.
And then we took psilocybin after that 

2008
01:50:56,741 --> 01:50:58,880
and it had a huge effect.
It was just a monster trip.

2009
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:03,350
And I wonder if it was some sort of a 
common atory experience.

2010
01:51:03,620 --> 01:51:08,620
Possibly.
But that was another thing that Mckenna 

2011
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:11,311
speculated about,
whether it was variable genetically 

2012
01:51:11,311 --> 01:51:12,020
variable seasonably variable.
As far as geographically,

2013
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:17,460
yes.
And whether it's transformed like 

2014
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:20,820
reindeer and transformed by the rain and
then where they drink the urine of 

2015
01:51:20,820 --> 01:51:23,110
reindeer after the reindeer of eastern 
yet and stuff.

2016
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:25,300
Right.
And the laps and people.

2017
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:26,540
Well,
it's also the,

2018
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:31,541
all the different connections to the 
Siberian shamans and that the whole 

2019
01:51:31,941 --> 01:51:36,941
Christmas thing,
the whole connection to Christmas and 

2020
01:51:36,941 --> 01:51:37,400
the Amanita miscarrying mushroom.
It's very,

2021
01:51:37,401 --> 01:51:42,401
very bizarre that elves are connected 
with this particular mushroom which is 

2022
01:51:42,681 --> 01:51:46,000
connected with Christmas and gifts.
And yes,

2023
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:48,350
symbiotic relationship to carnivorous 
trees.

2024
01:51:48,351 --> 01:51:49,960
Like the whole deal.
It is,

2025
01:51:49,961 --> 01:51:50,720
it's mysterious.

2026
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:55,740
But yeah,
I've never found that area of 

2027
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:55,740
speculation particularly satisfying.
I mean if,

2028
01:51:55,850 --> 01:52:00,850
if,
if the evidence pointed towards Strip 

2029
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:03,110
area cubensis or psilocybe semi 
Lanceolata United Liberty Cap or our 

2030
01:52:03,490 --> 01:52:08,490
native psychedelic mushroom in England,
then it might be more convincing.

2031
01:52:09,770 --> 01:52:10,510
Right.
I mean,

2032
01:52:10,511 --> 01:52:14,650
the fact is we don't know.
And it's really a matter of speculation.

2033
01:52:14,690 --> 01:52:15,890
Yeah.
I wonder if it's like,

2034
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,510
you know,
like heirloom tomatoes,

2035
01:52:17,570 --> 01:52:19,340
you know,
you eat an heirloom tomato,

2036
01:52:19,341 --> 01:52:21,500
they're so delicious.
They're fantastic,

2037
01:52:21,501 --> 01:52:22,410
they're sweet,
they're,

2038
01:52:22,450 --> 01:52:22,930
they,
they,

2039
01:52:23,300 --> 01:52:28,300
they're so rich and dark.
Or you can get one of these creepy 

2040
01:52:28,300 --> 01:52:29,120
tomatoes that they grow that live like 
the last,

2041
01:52:29,121 --> 01:52:34,121
like a month on a shelf and they're pale
and they're hard and they just taste 

2042
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:34,121
like shit.
I mean,

2043
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:36,950
there's nothing to them like they.
They look different,

2044
01:52:36,951 --> 01:52:41,951
they taste different.
I wonder if that somehow or another 

2045
01:52:41,951 --> 01:52:43,430
happened to the am anita where it lost 
it's psychedelic properties.

2046
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:46,280
Unlikely because never been cultivated

2047
01:52:46,380 --> 01:52:48,170
and grows in the wild

2048
01:52:48,510 --> 01:52:51,670
would be maybe just the temperature 
variations like that.

2049
01:52:51,671 --> 01:52:56,671
Maybe you have to have it in that 
incredibly cold environment of Siberia 

2050
01:52:56,671 --> 01:52:58,270
for it to be that it's geographically 
genetically variable.

2051
01:52:58,470 --> 01:53:01,180
Oh,
what you said makes the most sense to me

2052
01:53:01,181 --> 01:53:04,040
that it was mixed with something else.
It's like Oscar,

2053
01:53:04,150 --> 01:53:06,420
if you just took one of the components 
of the brew,

2054
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,030
if the historical data pointed worlds,
this being there,

2055
01:53:10,031 --> 01:53:10,660
you'd say,
okay,

2056
01:53:10,661 --> 01:53:15,661
this is what it was,
but actually neither of the components 

2057
01:53:15,661 --> 01:53:18,901
would work on their own.
So it may well have been that it was 

2058
01:53:18,901 --> 01:53:18,901
part of a mixture

2059
01:53:18,901 --> 01:53:20,440
that does kind of make sense for Salma.
Right?

2060
01:53:20,441 --> 01:53:23,570
Because wasn't so much actually.
It was described as some sort of

2061
01:53:23,660 --> 01:53:26,860
next year,
and so it was the Eleusinian mysteries.

2062
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:29,310
You just don't know what the Eleusinian 
mysteries are.

2063
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:29,950
Huh?
There.

2064
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:31,120
Is there any speculation?

2065
01:53:31,490 --> 01:53:36,490
Oh,
Graham Hancock have speculations of 

2066
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:36,490
course,
but I don't know.

2067
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:41,210
The ones I've seen would include opium 
in cannabis as part of the mix.

2068
01:53:41,970 --> 01:53:44,050
I mean,
cannabis was widely known in the ancient

2069
01:53:44,051 --> 01:53:48,160
world and actual hemp ropes were used 
for thousands of years.

2070
01:53:48,161 --> 01:53:49,420
People were growing.
Hemp.

2071
01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:52,870
Opium has been known for an awfully long
time.

2072
01:53:53,550 --> 01:53:58,120
Um,
so what else might have been in there?

2073
01:53:58,121 --> 01:53:58,840
We don't know.

2074
01:53:59,510 --> 01:54:00,790
Well,
that's the other thing too.

2075
01:54:00,791 --> 01:54:02,510
The,
the consumption,

2076
01:54:02,511 --> 01:54:05,270
the eating of cannabis,
uh,

2077
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:09,710
eating of Hash has produced incredible 
psychedelic experiences for people.

2078
01:54:09,711 --> 01:54:13,520
They've eaten large enough quantities 
where it's been very mushroom,

2079
01:54:13,521 --> 01:54:13,940
like

2080
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:19,470
much more psychogenic when Easton,
and it's traditional to take it by mouth

2081
01:54:20,381 --> 01:54:23,020
in India as well as to smoke it.
I mean,

2082
01:54:23,021 --> 01:54:28,021
it's a normal thing that the festival of
Holy h o n I a major Hindu festival when

2083
01:54:29,471 --> 01:54:34,471
I was living in India,
I was renting a wing of a crumbling 

2084
01:54:34,471 --> 01:54:36,910
palace and hydropower from a family of 
impoverished rogers.

2085
01:54:38,710 --> 01:54:43,710
And they were very respectable,
or they're impoverished and and on holy.

2086
01:54:43,970 --> 01:54:47,290
This festival day,
the Roger's wife,

2087
01:54:47,291 --> 01:54:50,590
the Ronnie came to me and she said,
Dr Saab,

2088
01:54:50,770 --> 01:54:52,720
you must take our special drink.
She said,

2089
01:54:52,721 --> 01:54:54,760
this is our special drink for holy and 
stuff.

2090
01:54:54,860 --> 01:54:55,880
And I said,
what is it?

2091
01:54:55,940 --> 01:54:56,500
She said,
Oh,

2092
01:54:56,501 --> 01:54:58,920
I will tell you later.
She says,

2093
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:02,040
she's like the Joey Diaz of India,
those two up.

2094
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:04,690
So I just drank.
This is bang.

2095
01:55:04,691 --> 01:55:06,510
Then she said,
have some more and say,

2096
01:55:06,720 --> 01:55:11,500
and various stoned with his bang this 
drink cannabis containing drink.

2097
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:16,890
And then everyone's sort of rushing 
around throwing colored water at each 

2098
01:55:16,890 --> 01:55:20,580
other.
But I mean this was a highly 

2099
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:20,580
respectable,
conservative,

2100
01:55:20,580 --> 01:55:24,350
Brahmin family and this was just part of
their traditional way of life and,

2101
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:26,010
and in,
in,

2102
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,120
in the,
in the drunk form.

2103
01:55:28,570 --> 01:55:30,490
Wow.
In the liquid,

2104
01:55:30,690 --> 01:55:32,110
the edible form.
That's,

2105
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:34,260
that's quite amazing.
I mean,

2106
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:39,280
I,
I often wonder how much different our 

2107
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,781
worldview would be if we had those sorts
of traditions here in America because 

2108
01:55:41,781 --> 01:55:46,161
that's traditions and just sort of these
cultural norms that we accept.

2109
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:52,790
They shaped so much of our behavior.
They shaped so much of how we view the 

2110
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:55,350
world and so much of it is just based on
momentum.

2111
01:55:55,351 --> 01:55:57,690
It's just based on what did your 
grandparents do,

2112
01:55:57,691 --> 01:56:01,590
what did they teach your parents and 
what did your parents teach you and what

2113
01:56:01,591 --> 01:56:04,380
is the collective culture of your 
neighborhood?

2114
01:56:04,381 --> 01:56:05,000
Your community?

2115
01:56:05,160 --> 01:56:06,630
Yes,
exactly.

2116
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:10,070
One thing that's just occurred to me,
well,

2117
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:12,230
there's two things I'd like to ask you.
Well,

2118
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:13,770
one thing,
let me ask you something,

2119
01:56:13,920 --> 01:56:18,920
please does.
You know I've done a lot of research on 

2120
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:21,351
the sense of being stared at and I think
that this feeling that almost everyone's

2121
01:56:21,361 --> 01:56:26,361
experienced feeling,
you're being looked at your turn around 

2122
01:56:26,361 --> 01:56:29,660
someone's staring at you or you can 
stare at someone and make them turn 

2123
01:56:29,660 --> 01:56:33,411
around and this is something which is 
very widespread in the population.

2124
01:56:35,010 --> 01:56:40,010
There's been a kind of scientific to bu 
for years about it because it ought not 

2125
01:56:40,010 --> 01:56:43,881
happen.
If your mind is nothing but your brain 

2126
01:56:43,881 --> 01:56:45,830
looking at someone shouldn't effect them
because everything is all inside your 

2127
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:46,860
head.
Whereas if when you look at somebody,

2128
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:50,220
the image that you're seeing is 
projected out as I suggested,

2129
01:56:50,221 --> 01:56:55,221
is that when I look at you now,
I don't think you're my imagery view in 

2130
01:56:55,221 --> 01:56:57,930
three dimensions and full color is 
inside my head.

2131
01:56:57,930 --> 01:57:02,930
I think it's where you are.
I think I'm projecting out my image 

2132
01:57:02,930 --> 01:57:06,731
review.
Everything I'm seeing in this room is 

2133
01:57:06,731 --> 01:57:09,021
where it seems to be projected out.
My Mind's extended beyond my brain 

2134
01:57:09,021 --> 01:57:11,370
anyway.
That is how we experience it.

2135
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,860
The official theories.
It's all inside the head.

2136
01:57:14,340 --> 01:57:19,340
Um,
and because the official theory says 

2137
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:22,551
this is just a superstition and people 
can't really tell them they're being 

2138
01:57:22,551 --> 01:57:25,611
looked at the been almost no scientific 
investigation till I took it up in the 

2139
01:57:25,611 --> 01:57:30,111
19 eighties and now quite a number of 
people have done this research on the 

2140
01:57:30,111 --> 01:57:34,131
sense of being stared at to find out if 
people really can tell when they're 

2141
01:57:34,131 --> 01:57:34,970
being stared out from behind.
Um,

2142
01:57:35,550 --> 01:57:37,530
I've done lots of experiments in 
schools.

2143
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:40,950
Kids are particularly sensitive to this 
more so than grownups.

2144
01:57:41,190 --> 01:57:42,210
Really?
Yes.

2145
01:57:42,450 --> 01:57:44,550
And I then to find out,
but I thought,

2146
01:57:44,551 --> 01:57:46,080
well look,
I've done the experiments,

2147
01:57:46,081 --> 01:57:47,520
but who are the professionals?

2148
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:52,520
So I,
in my research assistant interviewed 

2149
01:57:52,520 --> 01:57:55,490
security guards,
store detectives to drug squad at 

2150
01:57:55,490 --> 01:57:55,490
Heathrow,
uh,

2151
01:57:55,680 --> 01:57:56,880
police,
uh,

2152
01:57:56,881 --> 01:57:58,950
and private detectives,
you know,

2153
01:57:59,910 --> 01:58:04,910
have you ever had this experience?
Do people know when they're being 

2154
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:07,761
watched?
Almost everyone who watches others for 

2155
01:58:07,761 --> 01:58:07,761
living such,
of course they do.

2156
01:58:07,761 --> 01:58:11,900
And you know,
if you're being trained to be a private 

2157
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:11,900
detective trained how to follow 
somebody,

2158
01:58:11,900 --> 01:58:16,550
you don't stare at their back because 
they're likely to turn around and catch 

2159
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:17,310
your eye.
So anyway,

2160
01:58:17,311 --> 01:58:22,311
I wrote about this in my book,
the sense of being stared at about this 

2161
01:58:22,311 --> 01:58:23,850
research and about its implications for 
the nature of our minds.

2162
01:58:24,510 --> 01:58:29,510
But I had recently somebody came to me 
from a British defense research 

2163
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:34,760
laboratory and he said to me,
they've got very interested in this,

2164
01:58:35,080 --> 01:58:40,080
uh,
in the army because there's some 

2165
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:40,200
generals that worried that British 
troops in Afghanistan.

2166
01:58:40,200 --> 01:58:43,150
And I was so laden down with kit,
you know,

2167
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:44,770
gps systems.
I mean,

2168
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:47,560
that whole body is covered with 
electronic kit.

2169
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:51,310
And they found that when they're so top 
heavy carrying all this kit,

2170
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:55,060
they have to look down at the ground all
the time to avoid stumbling because it's

2171
01:58:55,090 --> 01:59:00,090
harder to walk with all this stuff and 
they can easily be picked off by 

2172
01:59:00,090 --> 01:59:01,960
guerrilla fighters behind rocks with 
rifles.

2173
01:59:02,500 --> 01:59:07,500
And so what they said is,
do you think we could train people in 

2174
01:59:07,500 --> 01:59:11,050
threat awareness so they could actually 
become more sensitive now in the martial

2175
01:59:11,051 --> 01:59:16,051
arts,
I know some martial arts do have threat 

2176
01:59:16,051 --> 01:59:16,780
awareness training,
so people went blindfolded,

2177
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:21,810
have to become more aware of when 
somebody is looking at and we're going 

2178
01:59:21,810 --> 01:59:24,660
to attack them from behind.
So my question to you,

2179
01:59:24,661 --> 01:59:26,620
since this is your world not mine,
is,

2180
01:59:26,680 --> 01:59:31,680
is how easy do you think it would be to 
train people in threat awareness to 

2181
01:59:31,680 --> 01:59:33,340
become more sensitive to knowing when 
they're being looked at?

2182
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:35,710
That's very interesting.
Um,

2183
01:59:36,050 --> 01:59:41,050
I have never been a part of any martial 
art that teaches people threat 

2184
01:59:41,050 --> 01:59:45,481
awareness.
What the martial arts that I've been 

2185
01:59:45,481 --> 01:59:47,581
involved in have all been about 
acquiring very specific skills for hand 

2186
01:59:47,771 --> 01:59:51,610
to hand combat against other trained 
adversaries.

2187
01:59:52,450 --> 01:59:57,450
There's a bunch of different types of 
martial arts that emphasize what you 

2188
01:59:57,450 --> 02:00:00,781
call self defense type martial arts.
My issue with those guys and the 

2189
02:00:01,961 --> 02:00:05,050
practices of self defense type martial 
arts,

2190
02:00:05,051 --> 02:00:10,051
is that almost everything that they're 
teaching would only work against a 

2191
02:00:10,051 --> 02:00:11,490
non-trained opponent.
Um,

2192
02:00:11,500 --> 02:00:13,210
they,
they have all these ideas.

2193
02:00:13,211 --> 02:00:15,130
Like if a guy comes at you and throws a 
punch,

2194
02:00:15,131 --> 02:00:16,690
you grab his wrist,
he do this,

2195
02:00:16,691 --> 02:00:19,510
you do that.
All that stuff only works on someone who

2196
02:00:19,511 --> 02:00:24,511
doesn't know how to fight.
And my thinking is always learn what 

2197
02:00:24,511 --> 02:00:28,540
works on trained killers.
Weren't learn things that are undeniable

2198
02:00:28,541 --> 02:00:30,250
against the most skilled martial 
artists.

2199
02:00:30,280 --> 02:00:34,690
Those are the things you want to learn.
And through this practice of very,

2200
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:39,490
very difficult to pull off techniques,
very difficult training,

2201
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:43,360
pushing yourself,
expanding the boundaries of your,

2202
02:00:43,630 --> 02:00:44,200
your,
your,

2203
02:00:44,201 --> 02:00:46,630
your willingness to push your body and 
your mind.

2204
02:00:46,810 --> 02:00:49,000
That's how you truly learn about 
yourself.

2205
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:54,420
And uh,
me and Milton Musashi had this 

2206
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:57,691
expression that he wrote in the book of 
five rings that once you understand the 

2207
02:00:57,691 --> 02:01:02,641
way broadly,
you will see it in all things in that 

2208
02:01:02,641 --> 02:01:05,820
way.
Being in his world was the way of sword 

2209
02:01:05,820 --> 02:01:08,581
fighting and that you would understand 
this and this most incredible and 

2210
02:01:08,581 --> 02:01:12,621
intense way and you would see the same 
sort of path of of the the True Path in 

2211
02:01:13,840 --> 02:01:18,840
calligraphy and carpentry and all sorts 
of expressive art forms and that this is

2212
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:27,300
my opinion.
What is the great benefit of martial 

2213
02:01:27,300 --> 02:01:30,631
arts?
It's the developing of your human 

2214
02:01:30,631 --> 02:01:32,380
potential through this incredibly 
difficult endeavor and I've always found

2215
02:01:32,381 --> 02:01:35,200
that these guys who like blindfold and 
look out for.

2216
02:01:35,210 --> 02:01:40,210
It's all bullshit.
There's a tremendous amount of bullshit 

2217
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:40,210
in martial arts.
It's one of worst.

2218
02:01:40,210 --> 02:01:40,210
Oh,
is it?

2219
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:45,790
Much less so now because of the new 
movement from 1993 on has been the 

2220
02:01:47,871 --> 02:01:52,871
movement of mixed martial arts and 
that's because of these things called 

2221
02:01:52,871 --> 02:01:56,400
the ultimate fighting championship and 
mixed martial arts competitions and what

2222
02:01:56,481 --> 02:02:01,481
mixed martial arts competitions have 
done is there was always these ideas at 

2223
02:02:01,481 --> 02:02:03,080
different people at death touches and 
sky could just.

2224
02:02:03,260 --> 02:02:06,800
He could hit you in a certain place and 
uses ci and knock you back.

2225
02:02:07,490 --> 02:02:10,490
All those guys failed miserably in 
competition.

2226
02:02:10,491 --> 02:02:12,770
Not a single one was successful.
Not One,

2227
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:17,180
every single one was beaten down and it 
just showed there's no mysticism when it

2228
02:02:17,181 --> 02:02:22,181
comes to martial arts.
The true mysticism is the conquering of 

2229
02:02:22,181 --> 02:02:25,690
your fears,
the ability to understand how to remain 

2230
02:02:25,690 --> 02:02:28,781
calm during these incredibly stressful 
moments of competition and through 

2231
02:02:29,150 --> 02:02:33,500
repetition and intelligent development 
of technique.

2232
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:38,800
That's what real martial arts training 
teaches people and that any divine 

2233
02:02:39,981 --> 02:02:43,760
feeling you get from a true master,
you would get from a pianist as well.

2234
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:46,640
You would get from a true,
a brilliant painter.

2235
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:47,420
You know,
you've,

2236
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:48,790
you've met Alex Grey,
right?

2237
02:02:48,950 --> 02:02:50,420
Yes.
Brilliant painter,

2238
02:02:50,421 --> 02:02:52,700
but you know how that feeling you get 
when you're around him,

2239
02:02:52,790 --> 02:02:54,560
he's a master.
You don't have any.

2240
02:02:54,600 --> 02:02:59,600
Like,
he has this sense of this like very 

2241
02:02:59,600 --> 02:02:59,600
like,
you know,

2242
02:02:59,600 --> 02:03:01,430
you're in the presence of a very unique 
person.

2243
02:03:01,850 --> 02:03:06,850
And I have experienced that same feeling
when I've been around martial artists 

2244
02:03:06,850 --> 02:03:07,700
and that same feeling when I've been 
around,

2245
02:03:07,701 --> 02:03:08,840
you know,
just great minds,

2246
02:03:08,841 --> 02:03:13,841
great thinkers.
There's what you do is you recognize 

2247
02:03:13,841 --> 02:03:15,590
you're recognizing greatness.
You're recognizing what Musashi said.

2248
02:03:15,650 --> 02:03:18,080
You're recognizing someone who 
understands the way broadly.

2249
02:03:18,770 --> 02:03:19,450
And,
um,

2250
02:03:20,240 --> 02:03:25,240
I don't,
I don't believe in a lot of these ideas 

2251
02:03:25,240 --> 02:03:26,030
of self defense training,
you know,

2252
02:03:26,031 --> 02:03:31,031
I think there's certain techniques that 
are very effective for soldiers like 

2253
02:03:31,611 --> 02:03:34,430
disarmament techniques,
like how to take someone's pistol away,

2254
02:03:34,670 --> 02:03:35,510
how to,
uh,

2255
02:03:35,540 --> 02:03:40,100
how to defend against a knife attack 
where it's very technique oriented.

2256
02:03:40,230 --> 02:03:45,230
A Krav Maga incorporates a lot of those,
which is an Israeli martial art that 

2257
02:03:45,230 --> 02:03:46,790
takes a lot of the best aspects of many 
different martial arts.

2258
02:03:46,791 --> 02:03:47,510
And they,
uh,

2259
02:03:47,511 --> 02:03:49,190
they train that.
Um,

2260
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:54,250
there are definitely real techniques 
involved that have been taught to 

2261
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:56,660
soldiers and by soldiers when it comes 
to disarmament,

2262
02:03:56,840 --> 02:04:00,860
when it comes to how to deal with a hand
to hand combat in certain situations.

2263
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:06,070
But I think overall,
a lot of the quote unquote selfdefence 

2264
02:04:06,070 --> 02:04:08,530
styles are bullshit and a lot of the,
uh,

2265
02:04:08,700 --> 02:04:09,950
you know,
we're gonna blindfold.

2266
02:04:09,951 --> 02:04:12,180
You and people are going to kick you.
If I blindfold you,

2267
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:13,730
you're going to get fucked up.
All right?

2268
02:04:13,731 --> 02:04:15,900
If I blindfold you,
there's not a person alive is gonna.

2269
02:04:15,930 --> 02:04:17,960
Stop me from putting him in the face.
If I blindfold them,

2270
02:04:18,210 --> 02:04:22,010
you're not going to know what's coming.
The only thing that you could help is if

2271
02:04:22,011 --> 02:04:24,800
you have control of a body.
Like if you're blindfolded,

2272
02:04:24,801 --> 02:04:27,040
you can grapple very well.
But I could.

2273
02:04:27,230 --> 02:04:29,360
I've grappled with my eyes closed 
before,

2274
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:34,190
but the reason being is that if I am 
holding onto your waist,

2275
02:04:34,191 --> 02:04:38,100
if I have a hold of you,
I know where everything else is just

2276
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:39,960
a,
a pattern thing.

2277
02:04:39,961 --> 02:04:42,630
It's a,
it's a pattern recognition.

2278
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:44,760
I've,
I've been in that position so many times

2279
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,400
that I could.
I know where your neck is going to be.

2280
02:04:47,401 --> 02:04:49,920
I know where your arm's going to be.
If I isolate your shoulder,

2281
02:04:50,100 --> 02:04:55,100
I know where your wrist is going to be.
I know how to isolate those joints 

2282
02:04:55,100 --> 02:04:55,950
without having to look at them.
So in that sense,

2283
02:04:56,130 --> 02:04:59,960
you could do some things blindfolded but
not striking distance.

2284
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:05,460
I think the threat awareness stuff was 
not so much that you could fight 

2285
02:05:05,460 --> 02:05:09,171
blindfolded,
but training people to feel from which 

2286
02:05:09,171 --> 02:05:12,891
direction someone was looking at behind 
it seems to be plausible.

2287
02:05:12,970 --> 02:05:14,900
You could train that.
Um,

2288
02:05:15,200 --> 02:05:16,950
but you know,
it's not my world.

2289
02:05:16,951 --> 02:05:21,520
And so really the,
I mean this is an issue that if,

2290
02:05:21,570 --> 02:05:24,270
if they ask my advice on experimental 
design,

2291
02:05:24,271 --> 02:05:29,271
but I do for threat awareness is this,
I'd have say take a five story building 

2292
02:05:30,540 --> 02:05:33,120
on one of the five stories selected at 
random,

2293
02:05:33,480 --> 02:05:35,220
you'd have a,
you do it at night,

2294
02:05:35,400 --> 02:05:40,400
have guys hidden behind in officers that
can look at people walking along 

2295
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:40,400
corridors.

2296
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:44,370
You'd have CCTV cameras and people 
watching them on that floor,

2297
02:05:45,330 --> 02:05:50,330
but on the other four floors you'd 
switch off the TV cameras and been able 

2298
02:05:50,330 --> 02:05:53,781
to do that and you'd have somebody walk 
through each floor of this building and 

2299
02:05:53,781 --> 02:05:57,861
then they'd have to say which one they 
were being watched in and one out of 

2300
02:05:57,861 --> 02:05:59,180
five if they got it right.
You know,

2301
02:05:59,220 --> 02:06:04,220
lots of times there's a one in five 
chance of getting it right just by 

2302
02:06:04,220 --> 02:06:07,641
guessing.
But if you find results above score 

2303
02:06:07,641 --> 02:06:07,641
above chance,
you could then say,

2304
02:06:07,641 --> 02:06:12,561
well these people are actually detecting
when the potential threats and you might

2305
02:06:12,841 --> 02:06:16,710
be able to train people to get better at
it than what you did.

2306
02:06:17,100 --> 02:06:18,630
Your study,
correct me if I'm wrong,

2307
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:22,710
you had people sit down and then they.
They would.

2308
02:06:22,711 --> 02:06:25,620
They hit a button when they felt someone
looking at them.

2309
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:26,710
No.

2310
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:28,170
What happened was this.
Well,

2311
02:06:28,171 --> 02:06:29,580
there's two.
There's two methods.

2312
02:06:29,581 --> 02:06:34,581
One,
one method I've mainly used is the 

2313
02:06:34,581 --> 02:06:37,191
simplest one that you can do with kids 
in schools and one person's blind folded

2314
02:06:38,760 --> 02:06:40,390
with an airline star,
blindfold,

2315
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:41,910
cut up,
peripheral vision.

2316
02:06:42,210 --> 02:06:46,380
The other person sits behind them and 
then in random series of trials,

2317
02:06:46,920 --> 02:06:51,810
the simplest message is tossing a coin,
but I have random sheets of instructions

2318
02:06:51,811 --> 02:06:53,940
in it.
You'd look or you don't look,

2319
02:06:53,941 --> 02:06:58,941
so if it's a look looking trial,
the person behind stairs at the back of 

2320
02:06:58,941 --> 02:07:00,030
their neck and thinks about them,
if it's not,

2321
02:07:00,060 --> 02:07:05,060
and then after 10 seconds it doesn't 
click and so they hear a click or a 

2322
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:08,070
beep.
They know the trials began and within 10

2323
02:07:08,071 --> 02:07:10,110
seconds they have to say looking or not 
looking,

2324
02:07:10,200 --> 02:07:12,930
are you being looked at or not?
Yes or no.

2325
02:07:12,980 --> 02:07:17,980
It's right or wrong,
and then the next trial at random would 

2326
02:07:17,980 --> 02:07:18,510
be looking or not looking and if it's 
not looking,

2327
02:07:18,511 --> 02:07:19,140
they look away.

2328
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:22,320
And think of something else and people 
have to guess.

2329
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:25,320
We usually do 20 of these or any 10 
seconds each,

2330
02:07:25,321 --> 02:07:30,321
so it doesn't take long and this gives 
results where most people score above 

2331
02:07:30,321 --> 02:07:31,500
chance,
50 percent chance,

2332
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:34,590
but many,
if you take an average,

2333
02:07:34,591 --> 02:07:38,440
it comes to around 55 to 60 percent,
so it's not a big effect,

2334
02:07:38,441 --> 02:07:43,441
but over hundreds of thousands of trials
that showed something's going on 

2335
02:07:43,441 --> 02:07:47,010
statistically significant.
It's very significant and if you do it 

2336
02:07:47,010 --> 02:07:50,281
through windows,
were to eliminate smell or sound or one 

2337
02:07:50,281 --> 02:07:51,520
way mirrors.
It still works.

2338
02:07:52,030 --> 02:07:57,030
And in Amsterdam,
this has been running in the Science 

2339
02:07:57,030 --> 02:07:59,020
Museum for 20 years and it's one of the 
biggest experiments ever conducted.

2340
02:07:59,470 --> 02:08:04,470
And the interesting hinders.
The overall results were extremely 

2341
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:05,140
positive,
highly significant statistically,

2342
02:08:05,590 --> 02:08:08,620
but what they've shown is what I've 
already found in my own experience.

2343
02:08:08,621 --> 02:08:11,950
The most sensitive subjects are children
under the age of nine.

2344
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:15,340
And I think most of versus when we're 
older,

2345
02:08:15,341 --> 02:08:17,620
we go out into the world is crowded 
streets.

2346
02:08:17,621 --> 02:08:20,260
Lots of people look at it,
we desensitize ourselves,

2347
02:08:20,261 --> 02:08:23,530
but children are much more sensitive.
I wonder if that case,

2348
02:08:24,010 --> 02:08:29,010
I wonder if really attractive woman 
would be the worst at it because really 

2349
02:08:29,010 --> 02:08:33,181
attractive women are used to putting on 
blindfolds and walking past people 

2350
02:08:33,181 --> 02:08:33,400
staring at them all the time.
Yes.

2351
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:38,520
Well,
there is a slight difference in those 

2352
02:08:38,520 --> 02:08:40,171
who've experienced this.
More women than men have experienced 

2353
02:08:40,171 --> 02:08:42,961
being stared at and do service and more 
men than women have experienced turning 

2354
02:08:42,961 --> 02:08:44,900
it others and looking at others,
making them turnaround manner.

2355
02:08:44,950 --> 02:08:46,240
Liras.
Yes.

2356
02:08:46,450 --> 02:08:48,730
So attractive women do have to,
as you say,

2357
02:08:48,731 --> 02:08:50,100
they have,
um,

2358
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:53,620
they have to learn to avoid meeting 
people's gaze.

2359
02:08:54,520 --> 02:08:58,030
Photograph American girl in Italy from 
1951.

2360
02:08:58,180 --> 02:09:01,120
It's a fascinating photograph.
It's a famous photograph.

2361
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:05,410
This American woman is walking down the 
street next to these animals,

2362
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:09,700
these men that are grabbing their crotch
and they're there stare and she has this

2363
02:09:09,701 --> 02:09:14,701
look on her face.
She's not looking at anyone in 

2364
02:09:14,701 --> 02:09:14,701
particular.
She's just going straight forward.

2365
02:09:14,701 --> 02:09:18,750
And I'm like,
that woman would be like a perfect 

2366
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:22,441
candidate.
Someone who's like to blocking off all 

2367
02:09:22,441 --> 02:09:24,400
these leering yes.
Freaks.

2368
02:09:25,150 --> 02:09:26,920
They're staring at her.
When you,

2369
02:09:26,921 --> 02:09:31,921
um,
was there anyone that you'd ever done 

2370
02:09:31,921 --> 02:09:31,921
that study on that was like really good 
at it?

2371
02:09:31,921 --> 02:09:33,250
Like 75 percent?
Eighty percent.

2372
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:34,450
Oh,
100 percent.

2373
02:09:34,451 --> 02:09:35,440
Yes.
One hundred percent.

2374
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:37,150
Yeah.
Someone got 100 percent.

2375
02:09:37,151 --> 02:09:38,980
Yes.
And that was my oldest son,

2376
02:09:38,990 --> 02:09:40,570
Merlin,
Merlin.

2377
02:09:40,700 --> 02:09:42,460
The wizard when Sunday.
Merlin?

2378
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:43,360
Yes.
Ridiculous.

2379
02:09:44,650 --> 02:09:47,920
He's a scientist.
He's a phd at the moment.

2380
02:09:47,921 --> 02:09:50,440
And in tropical Dr Merlin.
Wow.

2381
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:53,680
In the younger,
my youngest son who's 24 is a musician.

2382
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:55,570
It's 100 percent.
Yes.

2383
02:09:55,571 --> 02:09:58,930
When melon was four years old,
I did this experiment with him,

2384
02:09:59,230 --> 02:10:00,610
you know,
blindfolds.

2385
02:10:00,610 --> 02:10:01,660
Him.
He's sitting there.

2386
02:10:01,840 --> 02:10:02,320
I said,
look,

2387
02:10:02,350 --> 02:10:03,940
I'm going to look at you some of the 
time.

2388
02:10:04,150 --> 02:10:05,530
The rest of the time.
Nice.

2389
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:10,620
And each time you hear this click,
you have to say if you think you're 

2390
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:11,560
being looked at,
he got it right 100 percent of the time.

2391
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:13,780
So I couldn't believe this.
He wasn't cheating.

2392
02:10:13,781 --> 02:10:15,910
I mean he didn't know about cheating.
He was four.

2393
02:10:16,320 --> 02:10:17,350
Four.
Wow.

2394
02:10:17,380 --> 02:10:20,030
And so I did it again,
his brilliance,

2395
02:10:20,031 --> 02:10:20,830
and he said,
Daddy,

2396
02:10:21,130 --> 02:10:23,170
you've done to.
Can we do it the other way round?

2397
02:10:23,200 --> 02:10:27,310
Can you tell when I'm looking at you?
So I said,

2398
02:10:27,311 --> 02:10:28,390
okay,
we'll try that.

2399
02:10:28,600 --> 02:10:33,600
And we did it the other way around and I
out of 20 trials I got sorta 11 out of 

2400
02:10:34,521 --> 02:10:35,900
20.
It was above chance,

2401
02:10:35,901 --> 02:10:39,380
but I was wrong quite lots of time.
Then he got the idea,

2402
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:44,980
well you can be wrong and I was wrong 
and sort of changed his mind and after 

2403
02:10:45,171 --> 02:10:47,240
that when they test him,
it was still fairly high,

2404
02:10:47,241 --> 02:10:49,820
75 percent,
but he never got 100 percent again.

2405
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:53,510
That's interesting.
And what were the numbers like?

2406
02:10:53,511 --> 02:10:58,511
How many times did you do it?
Well the first two times were 20 times 

2407
02:10:58,511 --> 02:11:02,200
20.
So normally I do these trials with 20 

2408
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:05,021
trials and most people would get say 11 
out of 20 and he was getting $20 

2409
02:11:05,170 --> 02:11:09,560
definitely.
Which is hugely significant to course.

2410
02:11:09,790 --> 02:11:11,120
And um,
anyway,

2411
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:12,950
the thing is that young children are 
very,

2412
02:11:12,951 --> 02:11:16,700
very sensitive to this.
And I hold yours forensics,

2413
02:11:16,900 --> 02:11:18,650
the younger ones you see,
check it out.

2414
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
I've already got my plans for tonight.
I'm going to go on the way home and pick

2415
02:11:25,010 --> 02:11:26,600
up some blindfolds.
Yeah,

2416
02:11:26,601 --> 02:11:27,190
that's,
ah,

2417
02:11:27,290 --> 02:11:29,660
that's brilliant.
That's really interesting.

2418
02:11:29,661 --> 02:11:34,661
The idea that you introduced the 
possibility of failure and then he was 

2419
02:11:34,661 --> 02:11:34,700
like,
oh,

2420
02:11:34,701 --> 02:11:37,400
and then he doubt crept in.
Exactly,

2421
02:11:37,401 --> 02:11:39,660
and the problem with the kinds of tests 
side,

2422
02:11:39,690 --> 02:11:42,260
I do tests on the sense of being stared 
at telepathy.

2423
02:11:42,260 --> 02:11:44,360
I've joked doing a lot on telephone 
telepathy.

2424
02:11:44,510 --> 02:11:49,510
Can you tell who's calling?
I'm the problem with these kinds of 

2425
02:11:49,510 --> 02:11:53,861
experiments is that you have to set them
up so that people could be right or 

2426
02:11:53,861 --> 02:11:57,590
wrong and Pete know very few people are 
right all the time,

2427
02:11:57,620 --> 02:12:01,070
but as soon as doubt creeps in the mind 
and fierce people think,

2428
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:06,550
oh,
maybe I guess one way last time it's 

2429
02:12:06,550 --> 02:12:07,340
statistically I shouldn't be the other 
way this time.

2430
02:12:07,341 --> 02:12:08,570
And,
and they start,

2431
02:12:08,720 --> 02:12:11,510
as soon as that kind of thing goes on,
people lose it.

2432
02:12:11,750 --> 02:12:13,700
Boy,
that is life in a nutshell,

2433
02:12:13,701 --> 02:12:15,830
isn't it?
Like as soon as you have doubt,

2434
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:21,010
your whole world is just a mess and 
unfortunately these experiments that I 

2435
02:12:21,010 --> 02:12:25,721
do introduce doubt into the vet because 
I have to do statistical experiments 

2436
02:12:25,941 --> 02:12:30,941
that have incredible to skeptics.
So there's a kind of skepticism built 

2437
02:12:30,941 --> 02:12:33,670
into the experiment.
I haven't yet found a way of doing this.

2438
02:12:33,730 --> 02:12:38,730
I'm always.
The holy grail would be to find ways of 

2439
02:12:38,730 --> 02:12:41,501
doing these tests where people don't 
realize that they're being tested and 

2440
02:12:41,501 --> 02:12:42,740
that could be doubt.
How could that be done though?

2441
02:12:44,900 --> 02:12:49,900
Well,
I'm thinking of one kind of test that 

2442
02:12:49,900 --> 02:12:52,271
will be incorporated in a video game 
where say you have to choose between 

2443
02:12:52,851 --> 02:12:55,910
going through one door,
another door and one door.

2444
02:12:55,911 --> 02:12:57,470
You go through it.
It's absolutely awful.

2445
02:12:57,471 --> 02:13:01,190
In the other door you escape and you're 
onto sort of next stage.

2446
02:13:02,690 --> 02:13:07,690
You could have it where when people 
choose it hasn't been decided.

2447
02:13:08,430 --> 02:13:13,430
You'd have a random event thing that 
would determine which door you go 

2448
02:13:13,430 --> 02:13:14,540
through after you've made the choice to 
go through it.

2449
02:13:15,290 --> 02:13:17,870
This is then called presettlement or pre
cognition.

2450
02:13:17,871 --> 02:13:22,871
It's like knowing the future and so if 
people were right more often than they 

2451
02:13:22,871 --> 02:13:27,791
were wrong,
you'd know because it purely chance it 

2452
02:13:27,791 --> 02:13:29,600
should be 50 slash 50.
If some people were coming out 60,

2453
02:13:29,720 --> 02:13:32,490
40,
you wouldn't say this is a psychological

2454
02:13:32,491 --> 02:13:33,930
test.
You would say,

2455
02:13:33,960 --> 02:13:38,960
you know,
how lucky are you and can you be 

2456
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:39,870
consistently lucky in this?

2457
02:13:40,060 --> 02:13:43,160
Um,
and it would be more like luck.

2458
02:13:43,200 --> 02:13:45,990
It would still involve now them to duck 
because you might start thinking,

2459
02:13:45,991 --> 02:13:47,310
oh,
I'm not very lucky today.

2460
02:13:47,690 --> 02:13:49,710
Um,
but it would be,

2461
02:13:50,040 --> 02:13:51,840
wouldn't be framed as a,
as a,

2462
02:13:52,060 --> 02:13:53,730
a scientific experiment.
It will.

2463
02:13:53,731 --> 02:13:57,090
We've framed as a way of training your 
ability to be lucky.

2464
02:13:57,640 --> 02:13:59,180
Well,
hmm.

2465
02:13:59,670 --> 02:14:02,130
Training your ability to be lucky.
Yes.

2466
02:14:02,190 --> 02:14:07,190
Intuition is a very strange thing and 
some people believe in it and some 

2467
02:14:07,190 --> 02:14:10,611
people don't.
Some people believe that you make good 

2468
02:14:10,611 --> 02:14:10,611
choices.
Like you know,

2469
02:14:10,611 --> 02:14:13,911
you'll,
you'll hear people that are successful 

2470
02:14:13,911 --> 02:14:13,911
that are confident and again,
Hey,

2471
02:14:13,911 --> 02:14:13,911
I've always been lucky.
I've got great instincts,

2472
02:14:14,280 --> 02:14:17,100
but that there is something to 
instincts.

2473
02:14:17,101 --> 02:14:22,101
There's something to trusting certain 
folks and not trusting certain folks 

2474
02:14:22,101 --> 02:14:24,570
based on just an immediately the feeling
you get when you meet them.

2475
02:14:25,020 --> 02:14:26,520
Some things just don't seem bright.

2476
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:29,010
And I think a lot of it is probably 
pattern recognition.

2477
02:14:29,310 --> 02:14:30,210
A lot of it is,
you know,

2478
02:14:30,211 --> 02:14:32,670
I've been around guys like this before.
I know what they're about.

2479
02:14:32,671 --> 02:14:34,560
This guy's just got a little bit of 
bullshit and um,

2480
02:14:34,561 --> 02:14:36,330
I gotta get Outta here,
you know?

2481
02:14:36,830 --> 02:14:41,830
Well,
I think the intuition just means direct 

2482
02:14:41,830 --> 02:14:42,030
knowing and some of it can be 
telepathic.

2483
02:14:42,031 --> 02:14:44,400
Some of it can be unconscious pattern 
recognition.

2484
02:14:44,401 --> 02:14:47,610
There's lots of components,
but some of them,

2485
02:14:47,611 --> 02:14:50,370
I think what you could call Paris 
psychological,

2486
02:14:50,371 --> 02:14:55,371
you know,
feeling the future or picking up things 

2487
02:14:55,371 --> 02:14:56,200
telepathically.
Um,

2488
02:14:57,150 --> 02:15:01,290
and you know,
these recent experiments of daryl bem at

2489
02:15:01,291 --> 02:15:06,291
cornell on feeding the future.
I don't know if you've looked into 

2490
02:15:06,291 --> 02:15:07,860
those.
Let me just keep an eye on the time.

2491
02:15:08,030 --> 02:15:09,810
It's 1:00.
Okay.

2492
02:15:09,811 --> 02:15:14,010
Well you have a pocket watch old school 
look at you with a chain on it.

2493
02:15:14,070 --> 02:15:15,420
Yes.
Wow.

2494
02:15:15,450 --> 02:15:17,730
I don't like wearing wristwatches.
Let me take that out.

2495
02:15:17,800 --> 02:15:19,860
How do you have connected to your belt 
or something?

2496
02:15:19,861 --> 02:15:21,090
Yes.
Yes.

2497
02:15:21,260 --> 02:15:23,880
Savor the trousers is.
Wow.

2498
02:15:23,940 --> 02:15:27,240
Pretty Slick.
So where's the park at watch?

2499
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:28,650
Well,
you know,

2500
02:15:28,651 --> 02:15:31,530
you need to know the time sometimes.
Watches.

2501
02:15:31,970 --> 02:15:35,330
I don't like being manacled to time.
I'm cold.

2502
02:15:35,880 --> 02:15:38,070
Yeah.
You carry a cell phone?

2503
02:15:38,410 --> 02:15:39,380
No.
Oh,

2504
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:40,590
you're one of those guys.
Yeah.

2505
02:15:40,950 --> 02:15:44,340
How come?
I hate being interrupted.

2506
02:15:45,560 --> 02:15:47,310
You know,
I don't like the phone at home.

2507
02:15:47,311 --> 02:15:49,800
I don't use phones much.
I might use email.

2508
02:15:49,801 --> 02:15:52,290
That's fine.
I can always just shut your phone off.

2509
02:15:52,680 --> 02:15:54,270
I know,
but I'd rather not have it.

2510
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:59,300
I do have one because I.
I'm doing experiments on cell phones on 

2511
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,230
telephone.
Telepathy is my friend Steve was talking

2512
02:16:01,231 --> 02:16:02,560
about from London.
Same thing.

2513
02:16:02,580 --> 02:16:04,230
Hates,
hates having a phone drive.

2514
02:16:04,231 --> 02:16:05,700
His wife crazy.
Yes.

2515
02:16:06,080 --> 02:16:08,700
Well that's a good reason for not having
one.

2516
02:16:08,700 --> 02:16:13,700
I don't want to be interrupted all the 
time and if I go for a walk or if I'm 

2517
02:16:13,981 --> 02:16:18,981
working or.
So I find it really annoying if the 

2518
02:16:18,981 --> 02:16:18,981
phone rings.
I mean anyway,

2519
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:24,200
the pocket watch means I can know the 
time and I need to know I'm going to 

2520
02:16:24,200 --> 02:16:24,330
have to go fairly soon,
but not quite yet.

2521
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:29,840
Um,
where were we to let potential efficacy 

2522
02:16:31,631 --> 02:16:32,760
tests?
Um,

2523
02:16:33,130 --> 02:16:38,130
and intuition sometimes it's Interior 
Daryl bams experiments.

2524
02:16:39,070 --> 02:16:44,070
I'm a very simple and it's called 
feeling the future and does this 

2525
02:16:45,131 --> 02:16:50,131
phenomenon that dean raging at the 
Institute of noetic sciences has done a 

2526
02:16:50,131 --> 02:16:53,881
lot of research on where it turns out 
that we can respond a few seconds before

2527
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:59,160
an emotionally arousing event.
Our body starts preparing for it before 

2528
02:16:59,160 --> 02:17:03,151
it happens.
This would be very relevant to fast 

2529
02:17:03,151 --> 02:17:03,151
sports,
Ping Pong,

2530
02:17:03,151 --> 02:17:03,151
tennis,
cricket,

2531
02:17:03,340 --> 02:17:06,430
downhill skiing,
and probably martial arts as well.

2532
02:17:06,750 --> 02:17:11,750
Um,
and this research seems to me pretty 

2533
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:11,750
convincing.

2534
02:17:11,750 --> 02:17:16,170
Uh,
I've been a subject in some of these 

2535
02:17:16,170 --> 02:17:17,881
experiments myself and the dean raging 
rational.

2536
02:17:17,981 --> 02:17:22,981
It is this,
you sit there in front of a computer 

2537
02:17:22,981 --> 02:17:26,731
screen,
you're wearing electrodes that measure 

2538
02:17:26,731 --> 02:17:26,731
emotional arousal,
you know,

2539
02:17:26,731 --> 02:17:30,280
adrenaline causes sweating and emotional
arousal like a lie detector.

2540
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:34,570
So it's a standard way of measuring 
emotional arousal when you read,

2541
02:17:34,571 --> 02:17:38,530
you press a button and 10 seconds later 
a picture appears on the screen.

2542
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:40,830
Most of the pictures are neutral,
you know,

2543
02:17:40,840 --> 02:17:42,160
landscapes,
you know,

2544
02:17:42,161 --> 02:17:46,150
bold of flyers or something like that.
I'm vaguely pleasant.

2545
02:17:46,390 --> 02:17:51,390
Some of them are scenes that are 
emotionally arousing hardcore 

2546
02:17:51,390 --> 02:17:52,840
pornography or scenes of extreme 
violence.

2547
02:17:53,680 --> 02:17:55,150
Now,
almost everybody,

2548
02:17:55,151 --> 02:18:00,151
when they see hardcore pornography or 
scenes that fondness who's emotionally 

2549
02:18:00,151 --> 02:18:00,220
aroused,
even if they don't want to be,

2550
02:18:00,221 --> 02:18:01,360
they they,
they are,

2551
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:05,680
and the lie detector thing shows a huge 
emotional arousal.

2552
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:11,150
But the interesting thing in these 
experiments is the emotional arousal 

2553
02:18:11,150 --> 02:18:13,360
begins about five seconds before the 
picture appears on the screen,

2554
02:18:13,390 --> 02:18:16,390
five seconds,
long time for,

2555
02:18:16,391 --> 02:18:17,890
for,
for people ready,

2556
02:18:17,891 --> 02:18:19,330
here's five seconds,
go

2557
02:18:23,960 --> 02:18:26,660
five seconds.
That's a long time.

2558
02:18:27,140 --> 02:18:30,920
And so the body,
the heart starts beating faster.

2559
02:18:30,921 --> 02:18:33,170
The fight or flight response.
So you know,

2560
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:35,090
the adrenaline kind of response kicks 
in.

2561
02:18:35,300 --> 02:18:37,940
So when the,
when the stimulus occurs,

2562
02:18:37,970 --> 02:18:41,300
the body's already sort of revved up 
with this emotional response.

2563
02:18:41,900 --> 02:18:44,660
Now this is what that,
that,

2564
02:18:44,661 --> 02:18:46,070
um,
dean regions done.

2565
02:18:46,071 --> 02:18:49,100
He's repeated it and it's been 
replicated elsewhere,

2566
02:18:49,101 --> 02:18:52,300
is called pre sentiment feeling,
the feeling and then trans,

2567
02:18:52,960 --> 02:18:57,960
um,
and a decision as to which picture 

2568
02:18:57,960 --> 02:19:00,851
appears on the screen is made by the 
computer a millisecond before it 

2569
02:19:00,851 --> 02:19:04,481
actually appears.
There's no one in the world knows what 

2570
02:19:04,481 --> 02:19:05,150
picture is going to appear.
Now this is really interesting,

2571
02:19:05,151 --> 02:19:07,760
you see,
because it shows those a kind of feeding

2572
02:19:07,761 --> 02:19:10,020
back of emotion.
No,

2573
02:19:10,040 --> 02:19:15,040
Daryl Bem at Cornell who's a very 
respected professor of psychology and 

2574
02:19:15,800 --> 02:19:19,100
has been doing a different kind of 
experiment which doesn't involve the lie

2575
02:19:19,101 --> 02:19:20,470
detector,
um,

2576
02:19:20,720 --> 02:19:25,720
his experiments and you sit in front of 
a computer screen and there's two 

2577
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:25,720
curtains.

2578
02:19:25,720 --> 02:19:28,460
They're behind one of those curtains.
There's a blank wall,

2579
02:19:29,440 --> 02:19:31,970
an image of a blank wall behind the 
other one.

2580
02:19:32,210 --> 02:19:34,370
Those upon a graphic image.
Now,

2581
02:19:34,371 --> 02:19:39,371
most people,
even if they don't normally watch 

2582
02:19:39,371 --> 02:19:40,730
pornography and more interested in 
seeing a pornographic image than a blank

2583
02:19:40,731 --> 02:19:42,650
wall.
And before you do the test,

2584
02:19:42,890 --> 02:19:45,740
you do as a simple questionnaire,
you gay,

2585
02:19:45,741 --> 02:19:46,730
straight,
etc.

2586
02:19:46,910 --> 02:19:48,430
So people who are gay,
gay,

2587
02:19:48,530 --> 02:19:50,090
gay,
pornographic images.

2588
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:54,860
So those are emotionally arousing.
Say what happens?

2589
02:19:54,861 --> 02:19:59,240
You sit down at the computer and you 
click on one of those two cartons,

2590
02:20:00,440 --> 02:20:02,300
which,
which one you want to click on,

2591
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:07,560
choose which of the two.
It's random whether you'll get the wall 

2592
02:20:07,560 --> 02:20:11,621
or the pornographic image.
And so you click on one and most people 

2593
02:20:11,621 --> 02:20:13,190
would hope that they're going to see the
pornographic image,

2594
02:20:13,191 --> 02:20:16,510
a different one each time.
And um,

2595
02:20:17,800 --> 02:20:22,400
and the computer makes the decision 
which one to roll back which cotton roll

2596
02:20:22,410 --> 02:20:23,570
back after you've made.

2597
02:20:23,570 --> 02:20:28,570
The people don't know that there's 
decisions only made by the computer 

2598
02:20:28,570 --> 02:20:29,930
after they've decided they think it's 
already there.

2599
02:20:30,150 --> 02:20:35,150
Um,
so most people don't know that they're 

2600
02:20:35,150 --> 02:20:35,720
doing a pre sentiment test.
Um,

2601
02:20:36,560 --> 02:20:41,560
so what happens is in these experiments 
about 53 or 54 percent of the time,

2602
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:47,170
people get the pornographic image,
whereas by pure chance they would be 50 

2603
02:20:47,781 --> 02:20:52,781
percent.
And if instead of a pornographic image 

2604
02:20:52,781 --> 02:20:55,511
you have a sort of mildly pleasant 
landscape or something that's not 

2605
02:20:55,511 --> 02:20:56,480
emotionally arousing,
it's down to 50 percent.

2606
02:20:56,990 --> 02:21:01,990
Whoa.
So this is telling us that something 

2607
02:21:01,990 --> 02:21:03,350
about emotional arousal can work back in
time.

2608
02:21:03,800 --> 02:21:07,820
And when you think about fast sports,
imagine you know,

2609
02:21:07,821 --> 02:21:10,670
tennis people are saving at 90 miles an 
hour.

2610
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:16,000
There's not time for the eye to take in 
the angle of the ball to process it in 

2611
02:21:16,401 --> 02:21:18,800
the brain through clunky brain 
processing,

2612
02:21:18,801 --> 02:21:23,801
to send messages along the nerves to 
muscles to get the whole body ready or 

2613
02:21:23,801 --> 02:21:24,110
in a penalty shoot out.

2614
02:21:24,380 --> 02:21:28,000
The goalie haS to,
in a football soccer match the,

2615
02:21:28,020 --> 02:21:31,500
they have to react very quickly.
And in,

2616
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:33,290
in ping pong,
you have to react quickly.

2617
02:21:33,291 --> 02:21:38,291
And cricket people,
australian fast bowlers bowling 100 

2618
02:21:38,291 --> 02:21:39,140
miles an hour in cricket,
um,

2619
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:41,990
does not long enough.
And in downhill skiing,

2620
02:21:41,991 --> 02:21:43,990
you come around a corner.
Um,

2621
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:45,680
it's,
it's too fast.

2622
02:21:46,190 --> 02:21:47,070
So,
um,

2623
02:21:47,270 --> 02:21:49,750
I think that part of our,
the way we're reacting,

2624
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:53,200
and I think this comes up most in sports
is it,

2625
02:21:53,240 --> 02:21:58,240
and it would also come out driving a car
if you got the five second and advance 

2626
02:21:58,240 --> 02:22:01,850
warning some accidents,
but hatton you could concentrate and 

2627
02:22:01,850 --> 02:22:04,961
perhaps avoid it and better.
And this is a fascinating field of 

2628
02:22:04,961 --> 02:22:06,410
research which,
um,

2629
02:22:06,890 --> 02:22:11,890
is it,
is not yet been picked up by a sports 

2630
02:22:11,890 --> 02:22:13,680
psychologists or by.
I've told Several people in the military

2631
02:22:13,681 --> 02:22:17,210
about it because I think it Would be 
really interesting.

2632
02:22:17,570 --> 02:22:20,450
I don't think it's going to do any harm 
if they know know this,

2633
02:22:20,451 --> 02:22:24,470
but say for example,
you had your physiology being monitored,

2634
02:22:24,800 --> 02:22:29,800
you're in a flight simulator or a 
driving simulator and say you had it so 

2635
02:22:29,941 --> 02:22:33,540
that when you've got an otherwise 
inexplicably emotional arousal going on,

2636
02:22:33,610 --> 02:22:36,150
will you be unconscious of it to start 
with,

2637
02:22:36,570 --> 02:22:41,570
say it was wild outside red light went 
on in the cockpit of the drive flight 

2638
02:22:41,570 --> 02:22:44,400
simulator.
It might sometimes be a false alarm,

2639
02:22:44,401 --> 02:22:48,590
but every time that light went on you 
the message we concentrate harder,

2640
02:22:48,600 --> 02:22:53,600
something bad might happen and this 
could be useful technological candidate.

2641
02:22:54,540 --> 02:22:58,050
And so I think this is,
you know,

2642
02:22:58,051 --> 02:23:03,051
there's a lot of potential in this kind 
of research which is only just being 

2643
02:23:03,051 --> 02:23:04,840
began to be explored.
Um,

2644
02:23:05,460 --> 02:23:10,460
and the reason I've encouraged people in
the british defense research 

2645
02:23:10,460 --> 02:23:14,210
establishment to do this is because 
they're more likely to take it up than 

2646
02:23:14,210 --> 02:23:14,880
people in universities.
Because in universities,

2647
02:23:15,360 --> 02:23:17,730
you know,
there's this kind of dogmatic skepticism

2648
02:23:17,731 --> 02:23:19,740
that means people are,
it's rubbish,

2649
02:23:19,741 --> 02:23:20,340
it's,
whew,

2650
02:23:20,341 --> 02:23:22,620
it's pseudo science,
et cetera.

2651
02:23:22,621 --> 02:23:26,130
I mean stupid reactions really at the,
the,

2652
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:27,960
the most interesting in actually,
yes,

2653
02:23:27,961 --> 02:23:32,961
this is really interesting.
Can we find out more and can we apply 

2654
02:23:32,961 --> 02:23:32,961
it?

2655
02:23:32,961 --> 02:23:34,780
That's incrediblY fascinating.
Do you think that these things like this

2656
02:23:34,990 --> 02:23:39,990
is pre pre cognition ability or this uh,
instincts or these,

2657
02:23:41,180 --> 02:23:46,180
the ability to recognize these patterns.
do you think this is possibly some 

2658
02:23:46,180 --> 02:23:47,650
emerging thing in,
in human beings?

2659
02:23:47,651 --> 02:23:52,651
Emerging aspect of the development of 
humans mean obviously if you believe in 

2660
02:23:52,721 --> 02:23:56,230
evolution,
we were one thing now we are this,

2661
02:23:56,380 --> 02:24:01,380
we are what we are now,
which is radically different from the 

2662
02:24:01,380 --> 02:24:03,880
pre human hominids have 2 million plus 
years ago were very,

2663
02:24:03,881 --> 02:24:08,881
very different.
If you just extrapolate a million years 

2664
02:24:08,881 --> 02:24:13,651
from now,
we're going to be very different from 

2665
02:24:13,651 --> 02:24:14,821
what we are now.
Do you think that this aspect of human 

2666
02:24:14,821 --> 02:24:17,140
beings of human life is as a,
as a developing thing,

2667
02:24:17,200 --> 02:24:22,200
this pre cognition ability,
this ability to communicate with each 

2668
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:25,171
other.
Do you think maybe that's what's 

2669
02:24:25,171 --> 02:24:25,171
manifesting itself when you,
when you think about someone and also on

2670
02:24:25,171 --> 02:24:27,340
the phone rings and it's them like 
instantaneously?

2671
02:24:28,510 --> 02:24:29,640
Well,
I think that is

2672
02:24:29,900 --> 02:24:34,900
being in traditional societies,
that's actually a better development in 

2673
02:24:34,900 --> 02:24:35,810
modern ones where there's people don't 
talk about it on the whole,

2674
02:24:35,811 --> 02:24:39,020
there's no training for it and stuff.
In traditional societies,

2675
02:24:39,021 --> 02:24:41,570
people take these things for granted and
they rely on them.

2676
02:24:42,290 --> 02:24:46,550
Now the phone is an interesting case 
because this is a modern technology,

2677
02:24:47,450 --> 02:24:52,450
but I think that telepathy as a means of
communication between people who know 

2678
02:24:52,450 --> 02:24:55,820
each other well is actually.
It's always been going on.

2679
02:24:55,821 --> 02:25:00,821
Animals have it.
I've been doing research on telepathy 

2680
02:25:00,821 --> 02:25:03,250
and dogs.
I wrote a book called dogs that know 

2681
02:25:03,250 --> 02:25:05,351
when they're coming home.
I did lots of experiments on our dogs 

2682
02:25:05,351 --> 02:25:07,070
picking it up just by routine or cars 
hands.

2683
02:25:07,250 --> 02:25:08,750
The answer is no.
We filmed them.

2684
02:25:08,751 --> 02:25:11,810
We have people come at random times in 
unfamiliar vehicles.

2685
02:25:11,940 --> 02:25:16,940
the dog still on there,
but why have people have such a hard 

2686
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:18,410
time replicating those dog?
One's been application.

2687
02:25:18,430 --> 02:25:22,510
It was replicated by a skeptic who then 
pretended he hadn't replicated it.

2688
02:25:22,980 --> 02:25:27,980
Um,
but it's now generally agreed that his 

2689
02:25:27,980 --> 02:25:30,490
results agreed perfectly with my end.
And millions of people have dogs that do

2690
02:25:30,491 --> 02:25:32,800
this.
So I don't think it's hard to replicate,

2691
02:25:33,130 --> 02:25:35,350
it's just that if you do this in a 
university,

2692
02:25:35,351 --> 02:25:37,810
it's likely to end your career.
Yeah.

2693
02:25:37,811 --> 02:25:39,040
what is that?
What it is?

2694
02:25:39,041 --> 02:25:44,041
Because I've read online people that 
have disagreed with you saying that no 

2695
02:25:44,041 --> 02:25:44,140
one has ever replicated your your 
results.

2696
02:25:44,170 --> 02:25:45,480
Oh yes.
well that's.

2697
02:25:45,490 --> 02:25:50,490
That's the skeptics disinformation.
It's been replicated by one of the 

2698
02:25:50,891 --> 02:25:55,690
leading skeptics in britain who then 
pretended falsely that he hadn't.

2699
02:25:55,770 --> 02:26:00,400
And who was that?
Richard wiseman and online on my website

2700
02:26:00,401 --> 02:26:05,401
you can see his data plotted on graphs 
showing exactly the same effect as I 

2701
02:26:05,401 --> 02:26:07,870
found.
Is it statistically significant or is it

2702
02:26:07,871 --> 02:26:12,010
100 percent is statistically significant
data and mine.

2703
02:26:12,110 --> 02:26:13,530
What is your data like?
How,

2704
02:26:13,570 --> 02:26:18,570
how?
How often do they know and how often 

2705
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:18,570
were they unaware?
About 80 percent of the time.

2706
02:26:18,570 --> 02:26:23,371
We did a series of 100 trials with one 
dog and on those occasions the dog 

2707
02:26:23,890 --> 02:26:28,890
started waiting.
When the person was about to come home,

2708
02:26:29,260 --> 02:26:31,990
it was actually before she got in the 
car to come home,

2709
02:26:31,991 --> 02:26:36,991
all the taxi picked up her intention and
this was at random times on 20 occasions

2710
02:26:37,631 --> 02:26:40,540
out of 100.
it didn't on three or four of those,

2711
02:26:40,541 --> 02:26:45,541
the dog was sick and on the other 
occasions it was when it was a bit john 

2712
02:26:45,541 --> 02:26:48,550
heat and the next apartment could be 
distracted,

2713
02:26:48,910 --> 02:26:53,910
but even if you include all hundred 
events including the ones where the dog 

2714
02:26:53,910 --> 02:26:55,840
was to do the statistics,
it's still massively significant.

2715
02:26:56,680 --> 02:27:01,680
That's fascInating.
So you think that much like what you 

2716
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:04,711
were talking about with your son who is 
able to recognize 100 percent of the 

2717
02:27:04,711 --> 02:27:06,730
time when someone was staring at him 
that dogs,

2718
02:27:06,731 --> 02:27:08,680
because they don't have like a cultural 
context,

2719
02:27:08,681 --> 02:27:13,681
they don't have all this doubt in their 
head that they do it and they have an 

2720
02:27:13,681 --> 02:27:13,840
emotional investment too.

2721
02:27:14,150 --> 02:27:19,150
It's not like a boring paris psychology 
experiment in it for a dog is immensely 

2722
02:27:19,150 --> 02:27:23,941
emotionally exciting.
when the owner comes home is an 

2723
02:27:23,941 --> 02:27:24,940
emotional charge.
They do it over and over again.

2724
02:27:24,941 --> 02:27:27,040
They never get bored of their own.
Is coming home,

2725
02:27:27,790 --> 02:27:32,790
so this is the telephone phenomenon,
which I can briefly summarize is one I 

2726
02:27:34,721 --> 02:27:39,721
do in my tests.
People who say this happens to them in 

2727
02:27:39,721 --> 02:27:44,401
real life,
give me the names and numbers of four 

2728
02:27:44,401 --> 02:27:45,820
people.
It might happen with a we pick,

2729
02:27:45,821 --> 02:27:50,020
they sit at home being filmed so we know
they're not getting other phone calls or

2730
02:27:50,320 --> 02:27:55,320
text messages or something.
And they are a landline on the landline 

2731
02:27:55,320 --> 02:27:59,790
phone with no caller id display.
We picked one of the four corners at 

2732
02:27:59,790 --> 02:28:03,451
random and I'm called them out and say 
if you were doing it was say please ring

2733
02:28:03,701 --> 02:28:04,390
joe.
No.

2734
02:28:05,020 --> 02:28:07,750
And um,
they think about you,

2735
02:28:08,080 --> 02:28:13,080
they bring you your phone rings and 
before you pick it up you have to say 

2736
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:13,080
who you think it is.

2737
02:28:13,620 --> 02:28:15,760
Yeah,
I think it's john and you pick it up.

2738
02:28:15,761 --> 02:28:17,800
Say hi john,
you're right or you're wrong.

2739
02:28:18,430 --> 02:28:22,330
You can't know from the normal patterns 
of life because the,

2740
02:28:22,350 --> 02:28:24,890
um,
it's a randomly chosen.

2741
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:27,950
And so by chance you'd be right one time
in four,

2742
02:28:27,980 --> 02:28:32,960
25 percent in these experiments.
The Average score in our film test is 45

2743
02:28:32,961 --> 02:28:35,840
percent and massively significant 
statistically,

2744
02:28:36,650 --> 02:28:39,650
and this has not been replicated in 
other universities.

2745
02:28:39,651 --> 02:28:43,640
Even one of britain's leading skeptics 
checked us out and he's getting positive

2746
02:28:43,641 --> 02:28:48,641
results much to his dismay.
And so this is a.

2747
02:28:49,400 --> 02:28:52,990
I've now got an automated test.
I'm about to launch it in the us,

2748
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:58,030
but it's already launched in britain 
where people can do this on cell phones 

2749
02:28:58,030 --> 02:28:59,330
with their friends.
You don't have to be in a lab.

2750
02:28:59,960 --> 02:29:04,960
Um,
I think telephone telepathy is real and 

2751
02:29:04,960 --> 02:29:05,570
I think what's happening is that when 
you want to call someone,

2752
02:29:05,571 --> 02:29:08,870
if I wanted to call you,
I'd formed the intention to call you.

2753
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:13,870
I've got a motive to call you.
They'd be thinking about joe and then 

2754
02:29:13,870 --> 02:29:18,491
I'd get my phone out.
I dial a number or press your memory 

2755
02:29:18,491 --> 02:29:21,710
thing for you.
When I formed the intention to call you.

2756
02:29:21,711 --> 02:29:24,890
I think you could in some cases pickup 
that intention.

2757
02:29:24,891 --> 02:29:27,620
You might start thinking about me for no
apparent reason.

2758
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:30,680
And then the call comes through and you 
say,

2759
02:29:30,681 --> 02:29:32,570
it's funny,
I was just thinking about you.

2760
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:37,280
So I think this is a genuinely 
telepathic phenomenon in many cases.

2761
02:29:37,281 --> 02:29:42,281
Sometimes it can be coincidence,
but on average it seems to be a real 

2762
02:29:42,281 --> 02:29:44,250
effect.
And um,

2763
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:49,720
I think this is an example of where 
telepathy really is evolving along with 

2764
02:29:49,720 --> 02:29:51,830
technology.
It happens with emails and text messages

2765
02:29:51,831 --> 02:29:53,630
as well.
Until recently,

2766
02:29:54,050 --> 02:29:58,310
the only way you could get in touch with
someone at a distance was telepathically

2767
02:29:58,311 --> 02:29:59,900
if you wanted a quick response.

2768
02:30:00,230 --> 02:30:05,230
Now you can do it by phone.
And I've also done research on what I 

2769
02:30:05,230 --> 02:30:08,630
think is one of the basic biological 
forms of this which mothers and babies,

2770
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:14,840
many nursing mothers find that when 
they're away from their baby for no 

2771
02:30:16,371 --> 02:30:18,620
apparent reason,
their milk that's done,

2772
02:30:18,621 --> 02:30:21,350
their breasts start squeezing out milk 
normally.

2773
02:30:21,351 --> 02:30:25,490
That happens when the baby cries and 
they feel their breast tinkle.

2774
02:30:25,940 --> 02:30:30,940
Say there was a nursing mother here now 
and there was no baby crying here and 

2775
02:30:30,940 --> 02:30:34,220
she felt her milk that done.
Most nursing mothers think my baby needs

2776
02:30:34,221 --> 02:30:39,221
me.
And until recently they just went home 

2777
02:30:39,221 --> 02:30:39,590
to the baby.
Now they call home on a cell phone.

2778
02:30:39,980 --> 02:30:42,770
But I've done studies on nursing mothers
in london,

2779
02:30:42,920 --> 02:30:47,150
20 of them over two month period each,
and we found that there was.

2780
02:30:47,151 --> 02:30:49,140
it was very,
very highly significant.

2781
02:30:49,141 --> 02:30:54,141
It wasn't just synchronized rhythms.
They were responding when they baby 

2782
02:30:54,141 --> 02:30:55,670
needed them and before telephones were 
invented,

2783
02:30:56,390 --> 02:31:01,390
any mother that could pick up when her 
baby needed her and went to the baby 

2784
02:31:01,390 --> 02:31:05,831
would have a mother,
a baby that survived better than a 

2785
02:31:05,831 --> 02:31:05,831
mother,
didn't pick it up.

2786
02:31:05,831 --> 02:31:09,320
So I think telephones in a way,
it gives us a technological way of doing

2787
02:31:09,321 --> 02:31:13,220
something that in the past happened more
unreliably by telepathy.

2788
02:31:13,460 --> 02:31:18,460
So do you think that these telephones 
connecting to telepathy is somehow or 

2789
02:31:18,460 --> 02:31:22,931
another related to this,
this morphic field that it's seemingly 

2790
02:31:22,931 --> 02:31:24,240
undefined?
We don't.

2791
02:31:24,270 --> 02:31:29,270
We know.
Or rather you believe that this is a 

2792
02:31:29,270 --> 02:31:29,270
real phenomenon,
that it exists,

2793
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:31,410
but we don't know exactly what the 
mechanism is.

2794
02:31:32,400 --> 02:31:34,590
Yeah.
I think what happens with social groups,

2795
02:31:34,650 --> 02:31:36,810
any social group,
is that the field as a whole,

2796
02:31:36,870 --> 02:31:38,220
as a group,
as a whole,

2797
02:31:38,221 --> 02:31:43,221
has a field,
like a magnetic field will arrange on 

2798
02:31:43,221 --> 02:31:44,760
filings which are within its field of 
influence.

2799
02:31:45,030 --> 02:31:48,360
If you have a flock of birds,
starlings that are flying together,

2800
02:31:48,810 --> 02:31:53,810
there's a kind of field that coordinates
their movement so they can change 

2801
02:31:53,810 --> 02:31:54,700
direction rapidly without bumping into 
each other.

2802
02:31:55,230 --> 02:31:57,960
If you hAve a school of fish,
you got the same kind of thing.

2803
02:31:58,530 --> 02:32:01,890
If you have a pack of wolves and they 
leave the young,

2804
02:32:01,891 --> 02:32:06,690
the cubs are left behind in the den with
a babysitter while the adults go hunting

2805
02:32:06,870 --> 02:32:10,560
to bring food back for the young.
The field that links them isn't broken.

2806
02:32:10,561 --> 02:32:13,080
It stretches like an invisible elastic 
band.

2807
02:32:13,530 --> 02:32:18,530
I think that's the basis of telepathy.
I think it's to do with social bonds 

2808
02:32:18,530 --> 02:32:22,161
through social fields.
And a mother and the baby are very 

2809
02:32:22,161 --> 02:32:25,821
closely linked and it's as if there's 
this invisible elastic band between 

2810
02:32:25,821 --> 02:32:29,751
them.
And so when you look at telephone 

2811
02:32:29,751 --> 02:32:33,171
telepathy,
it typically only happens with people 

2812
02:32:33,171 --> 02:32:33,171
you know.
Well,

2813
02:32:33,171 --> 02:32:35,520
it happens between mothers and children.
Husbands and wives,

2814
02:32:35,940 --> 02:32:37,890
lovers,
partners,

2815
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,320
um,
therapists and clients.

2816
02:32:40,321 --> 02:32:43,200
If there's a kind of emotional charge,
best friends,

2817
02:32:43,410 --> 02:32:45,990
it doesn't happen with insurance 
salesman and,

2818
02:32:46,240 --> 02:32:49,500
and people to whom you're not 
emotionally connected.

2819
02:32:49,890 --> 02:32:51,540
Um,
it's a,

2820
02:32:51,900 --> 02:32:53,760
it depends on social bonds.

2821
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:59,000
And so I think morphic fields of the 
social group is something that applies 

2822
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:03,621
to any social group.
A family as a kind of has a morphic 

2823
02:33:03,621 --> 02:33:06,240
field,
a football team has won a Michael Murphy

2824
02:33:06,270 --> 02:33:11,270
who founded the esalen institute,
did a fascinating book called the 

2825
02:33:11,270 --> 02:33:12,990
psychic side of sports.
And um,

2826
02:33:13,680 --> 02:33:18,420
he describes these interviews with 
football players and many of them turned

2827
02:33:18,421 --> 02:33:20,910
quite mystical when they were 
interviewed in private.

2828
02:33:20,911 --> 02:33:25,911
They wouldn't talk about it in the 
locker room for fear of being thought 

2829
02:33:25,911 --> 02:33:25,911
weird.
Um,

2830
02:33:25,911 --> 02:33:27,720
but many of them,
like soccer players,

2831
02:33:28,140 --> 02:33:29,730
they said when the game's going,
well,

2832
02:33:29,731 --> 02:33:32,880
it's as if they can just feel where 
other people are on the field.

2833
02:33:32,881 --> 02:33:34,830
It was like an instinct even they 
didn't,

2834
02:33:34,890 --> 02:33:39,890
they just,
somehow they were working like a single 

2835
02:33:39,890 --> 02:33:42,081
organism.
And I think that's an example of a 

2836
02:33:42,081 --> 02:33:43,290
morphic field of a social group.
And I think that's why team sports,

2837
02:33:43,580 --> 02:33:44,480
I'm,
uh,

2838
02:33:44,590 --> 02:33:48,660
so interesting to watch because it's not
just about guys being brilliant,

2839
02:33:48,900 --> 02:33:53,900
it's about guys working together and in 
a way that's highly coordinated and more

2840
02:33:53,911 --> 02:33:57,450
effectively the team works together.
The more effective it is.

2841
02:33:57,900 --> 02:33:59,160
That's fascinating.
Staff.

2842
02:33:59,161 --> 02:34:03,690
It's really interesting to consider how 
much of a factor that does play.

2843
02:34:03,750 --> 02:34:05,970
What did it,
what exactly it is too.

2844
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:07,740
Yeah.
Now it's an amazing,

2845
02:34:08,020 --> 02:34:09,150
uh,
you're out of time.

2846
02:34:09,240 --> 02:34:11,400
Rupert sheldrake,
rupert sheldrake.org.

2847
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:16,430
Is your website a rupert sheldrake.org?
I'm just sheldrake.org.

2848
02:34:16,620 --> 02:34:18,010
And rupert sheldrake is

2849
02:34:18,010 --> 02:34:20,200
your twitter handle?
correct?

2850
02:34:20,320 --> 02:34:21,470
Do you handle all that stuff?
I,

2851
02:34:21,650 --> 02:34:23,530
I tried.
I didn't really use twitter,

2852
02:34:23,531 --> 02:34:25,240
so no,
forget that.

2853
02:34:25,540 --> 02:34:27,400
Really do have one,
but I don't use it.

2854
02:34:27,820 --> 02:34:29,820
Someone set it up for me and I never 
learned.

2855
02:34:29,840 --> 02:34:34,130
Her last tweet was September 13th.
I posted a new photo.

2856
02:34:34,140 --> 02:34:34,990
The facebook.
Oh,

2857
02:34:35,170 --> 02:34:38,110
so you use facebook?
facebook has automatically,

2858
02:34:38,310 --> 02:34:39,170
yes.
To twitter.

2859
02:34:40,360 --> 02:34:42,090
Uh,

trial logs a.

2862
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:49,540
I really appreciated it and we can do 
this anytime you're in town.
