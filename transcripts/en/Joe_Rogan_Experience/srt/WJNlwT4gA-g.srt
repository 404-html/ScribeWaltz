1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,700
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:02,871
Yeah,

3
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:03,704
and he's like,

4
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,580
like a top scientist should
have died after the uh,

5
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,463
appendicitis.

6
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,313
I'm one of the week.

7
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:08,820
I just,

8
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:09,660
it's just no way.

9
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,710
He's like one of the rare guys that
three Jiu Jitsu classes I tapped out for.

10
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:14,544
Good.

11
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,360
I'm out.

12
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,273
You should come.

13
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,031
Come,

14
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:18,960
come with me tonight man.

15
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,231
Look,

16
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,430
I know I'm not a man.

17
00:00:20,431 --> 00:00:20,760
Would love,

18
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,300
I don't need to go down there and have
it reinforced all you guys get this

19
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:24,350
pressure side.

20
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,330
Is it a calm me down
and make you feel better

21
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:28,761
dude,

22
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:30,740
I'm like the commerce
I've been in my life.

23
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:33,860
I'm always going to sound like I'm in a
bad mood because I have the east coast

24
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:34,694
accent.

25
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,500
Look dude,

26
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,850
your fucking phony.

27
00:00:37,851 --> 00:00:38,510
Calm down.

28
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,021
You're like,

29
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:39,171
you're,

30
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:39,611
you're you,

31
00:00:39,611 --> 00:00:40,910
you smoke weed.

32
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,980
Why calm down from exercise to I.

33
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,700
We doesn't necessarily calm me down
as it does make me just a little more

34
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:48,534
sensitive.

35
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,130
Red Redman you buying this?

36
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,630
I think we'd calmed me down.

37
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,470
Yeah.

38
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:53,681
Dude,

39
00:00:53,681 --> 00:00:55,570
you are a completely different person.

40
00:00:55,571 --> 00:01:00,571
Like when I met you in like
96 97 you are good guy,

41
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:04,960
but you wouldn't want the most
intense fucking dude's I never met.

42
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:09,961
It was like this switch somewhere in your
life was flipped and the shit was on.

43
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,740
I don't even know how you slept.

44
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:12,731
You were like,

45
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,480
you are like,

46
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,230
ah,

47
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,030
fucking goal line defense,

48
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:17,320
middle linebacker.

49
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,430
That's shit doesn't mean anything to you.

50
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,440
I'm using sports analogies like you were
fucking intense to and every story I

51
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:25,510
heard about you at Taekwondo,

52
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,790
uh,

53
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,400
events,

54
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,870
I believed all of it after meeting
you for literally about 25 seconds.

55
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:32,991
Well I,

56
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:36,030
I was transitioning then still.

57
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,330
That was still just a few years.

58
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:39,840
Sounds like a guy trying to mix the role.

59
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:40,720
No,

60
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,490
it was true.

61
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,440
He was transgender when I was a,

62
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:44,550
when I was a young guy.

63
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:44,821
Crazy.

64
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:45,631
Or when I was younger,

65
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:47,460
I was going through my entire,

66
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,480
my entire childhood was spent competing
in martial arts tournaments from the

67
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:55,890
time I was like 15 to the time
I was 22 was my last fight.

68
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,320
So do you think it made you like that
or it tapped into something that was

69
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:00,154
already there?

70
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,240
I don't think I would have been that
intense if I didn't have to deal with

71
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,490
really dangerous shit on a regular basis.

72
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,300
It was the fact that you were fighting
in tournament's on a regular basis and

73
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,090
nothing ever happened to me.

74
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,140
I never got hurt,

75
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:17,880
but I easily could've easily could zig
when I should have zagged and got knocked

76
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:18,570
the fuck out.

77
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,590
It just never happened.

78
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,430
I only lost once in a kickboxing
match and that was not,

79
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:25,680
not that I didn't lose
a before and taekwondo,

80
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,630
but lost once by stoppage.

81
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,790
The only time I ever got stopped
was in a kickboxing match.

82
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,560
That was the third fight in a day and
I was terrible nutrition back then,

83
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,360
always getting sick,

84
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:36,781
you know,

85
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,750
it didn't really take vitamins and shit
and that was on the fence back then.

86
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,930
I was like doing stand up and
fighting at the same time,

87
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,600
so it wasn't like a bad knock out.

88
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,150
I got dropped by a left hook
and then I got up and I,

89
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,570
my,

90
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:51,300
my legs just wouldn't work and he hit
me again and I fell down again and they

91
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:51,991
stopped the fight.

92
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:52,980
Like it was just a,

93
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,130
he had hit my jaw like in the
perfect spot and everything gave out.

94
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,140
And I was thinking about
it like when I was,

95
00:02:58,141 --> 00:03:00,820
when I was going back that there's
one of two things I'm gonna do.

96
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,850
Either I'm going to go fucking crazy now
and rededicate myself and try to be a

97
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:10,240
world champion kickboxer and just use
the fact that I got tired in the third

98
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:15,241
fight of the day as motivation to just
run extra miles and do extra plyometrics

99
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,190
and do extra rounds or be a standup.

100
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,643
Yeah,

101
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,793
no brainer.

102
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,010
I was like,

103
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:25,500
I can't,

104
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,070
there's no,

105
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,050
there's no reward.

106
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,530
There was no ultimate fighting
championship back then.

107
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,160
There was no,

108
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,370
so it's like I had to reprogram my brain.

109
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,230
I ended up pro my,

110
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,800
my brain was used to always thinking
about martial arts competition.

111
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,461
That's all it was.

112
00:03:39,461 --> 00:03:40,390
It was dodging kicks,

113
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,320
landing your own,

114
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:41,771
you know,

115
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:42,401
getting in,

116
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:43,420
closing the distance.

117
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:43,920
And you know,

118
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,081
and,

119
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:45,400
and forcing your game plan.

120
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:48,340
That's what my whole day was
spent fighting in my head.

121
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,370
Even if I wasn't finding it would be
fighting in my head what I was when I was

122
00:03:51,371 --> 00:03:51,820
a,

123
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,750
like I had girlfriends,

124
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:52,901
we,

125
00:03:52,901 --> 00:03:54,810
they'd sleep over and uh,

126
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,430
I would,

127
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,430
I would throw kicks in the middle
of the night like don't like my,

128
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:03,730
my whole body would jolt like a kick
cause I was having a fighting dream.

129
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,500
So I was terrified.

130
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,000
I was constantly terrified.

131
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,660
I got really good at it because
I was absolutely horrified of it.

132
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,381
I just didn't want to,

133
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:14,010
I just did not want to get my ass
kicked and I was already doing it.

134
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,261
I'm like,

135
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,590
well this is what we're doing then we've
got to get really fucking good at this

136
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,120
because this is not something you can
half ass dudes are kicking dudes in the

137
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:23,870
face and knocking people unconscious.

138
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,780
Like this is fucking terrifying.

139
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,400
I saw it happens so many times.

140
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,930
Saw happened to good friends.

141
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,090
I saw it happen to people
who are better than me.

142
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,360
They just fought the wrong
dude at the wrong time,

143
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,860
which easily could have happened to me.

144
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:36,694
It didn't,

145
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,860
but it easily could have like a,

146
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,350
our instructor never protected us at all.

147
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:42,071
He put us even,

148
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:42,581
we were like,

149
00:04:42,581 --> 00:04:43,560
kids were teenagers.

150
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,260
He would put us in the
men's division and you know,

151
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,051
and tell you like,

152
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,600
you're good enough to fight as a black
belt when you were like a blue belt or

153
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:50,050
red belt.

154
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,650
He was just,

155
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,210
he wanted to see who is crazy.

156
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,223
He wanted to see,

157
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:56,530
he wanted to develop a team of
people who didn't give a fuck.

158
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,600
That's so funny that you,

159
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:58,780
you could do that with kids.

160
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,560
Like that guy.

161
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,460
He can on the,

162
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:02,560
the like at the very least local news,

163
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,210
you know,

164
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,030
it was very cold

165
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,600
ditch.

166
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,810
The martial arts schools are very cultish.

167
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,141
It's,

168
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:08,830
yes sir.

169
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,401
No Sir.

170
00:05:09,401 --> 00:05:11,440
It's all like almost military,

171
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:11,951
you know,

172
00:05:11,951 --> 00:05:14,620
like it's always bowing when you see him,

173
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,300
you know,

174
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,480
you always bow.

175
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,590
You always call him sir.

176
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,581
It was very,

177
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:18,640
yeah,

178
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,090
I can,

179
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,550
I can,

180
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,350
I never been able to exist in that
dynamic no matter what it was like,

181
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:24,370
there's no way I could,

182
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,204
uh,

183
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,020
I needed it.

184
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,130
I grew up without a dad.

185
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,660
I grew up without a,

186
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:30,620
I have a Stepdad,

187
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,210
but my real dad,

188
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:34,520
I knew he was alive and I
didn't communicate with them,

189
00:05:34,521 --> 00:05:35,780
so it always fucked with me.

190
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,410
So I needed some sort of intense
discipline to get my shit together.

191
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,620
So first time I ever felt like I had
any control of my life at all was when I

192
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:43,580
started doing martial arts.

193
00:05:43,581 --> 00:05:43,930
I was like,

194
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,660
oh,

195
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,081
finally,

196
00:05:45,081 --> 00:05:46,640
I can fucking get good at something.

197
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,020
This,

198
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:47,750
I'm good at this shit.

199
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,583
You know?

200
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:50,811
But,

201
00:05:50,811 --> 00:05:53,710
so that's why I was so wound up met.

202
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,940
It took me a while to relax.

203
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,103
You know,

204
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,290
it's so amazing how we've been
able to cut that out of our lives.

205
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:02,000
That whole food gathering nonsense.

206
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,060
Like while I was watching this mountain
men show and watched this poor guy with

207
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,350
shitty rodeo knees.

208
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,910
He's going out looking for deer,

209
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:08,840
like trying to get a deer,

210
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:11,810
some meat for the freezer while
he's looking for bears constantly.

211
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,150
Like what,

212
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,560
what an amazing change of life it's
happened when they figured out how to cut

213
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:21,700
out that whole gathering food
that was already bad enough.

214
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:23,190
Bad knees looking for a deer.

215
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,961
And then he does the,

216
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:24,141
the,

217
00:06:24,141 --> 00:06:26,710
the over the top wild looking for bears.

218
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,071
Yeah.

219
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,701
That's amazing.

220
00:06:27,701 --> 00:06:28,650
You got to watch the show.

221
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,380
It's a great show.

222
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:29,471
No,

223
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:31,660
that's why I just watched it
last night for the first time.

224
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,520
I'm comfortable being in the Matrix.

225
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,180
I,

226
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,481
you know,

227
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:34,651
I'll,

228
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:38,230
I'll starve to death and it will be a
brutal month and then that'll be it.

229
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,510
I don't want to be walking around with
my bad back out in the fucking moments

230
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,930
trying to shoot deer in the face,

231
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,340
trying to get it with
some sharpened stick,

232
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:49,640
Gabby.

233
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:49,961
All right.

234
00:06:49,961 --> 00:06:50,131
I'm,

235
00:06:50,131 --> 00:06:50,861
I'm part of the week.

236
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:51,790
I'm not supposed to be here.

237
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:52,700
That's just someone like you,

238
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:52,890
you,

239
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,141
you'll,

240
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:54,400
you'll tap back into your,

241
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,234
uh,

242
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,830
when you through kicks in at night.

243
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,440
Yeah.

244
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,990
I'll just grow grass mountain man.

245
00:07:01,991 --> 00:07:02,824
Beard.

246
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,000
That's where animal
skins make my own spears.

247
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:07,721
I just,

248
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:08,550
that's the name of good,

249
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,740
uh,

250
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,240
Bruce Springsteen album make,

251
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,170
make my own spirit.

252
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,540
When I threw kicks in the night

253
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,140
through kicks him.

254
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,790
If you said something,

255
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,720
I have to be like a breakup margin,

256
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:34,180
Lou one man.

257
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,630
There's something about being young and
getting out of the town and getting away

258
00:07:41,631 --> 00:07:45,350
from all the boozers and then you go into
the course when it kicks in the night.

259
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:57,870
Okay.
