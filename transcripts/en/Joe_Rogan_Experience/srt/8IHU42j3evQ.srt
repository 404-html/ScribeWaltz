1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,141
Oh,

2
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:04,531
hey,

3
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:05,364
what's everybody?

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,040
How's everyone out there in internet land?

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,420
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience is sponsored by squarespace.

6
00:00:12,421 --> 00:00:14,940
If you've been paying attention to
the podcast over the last few weeks,

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,160
you know that we had a website contest.

8
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,180
A squarespace is a really it as far as
like a website that creates websites.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,730
You literally cannot find a
better place than squarespace.

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,050
It's so simple,

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,280
so easy,

12
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,330
so intuitive.

13
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,120
Just point and click and
drag and drop all things.

14
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,860
Your average moron like myself can do.

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,810
I could make a website with squarespace.

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,400
You can make a website with squarespace.

17
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:43,170
So we put on a contest and the people
that won the contest will be announced

18
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:43,670
today.

19
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:43,980
Uh,

20
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:44,220
we,

21
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,280
we chose four sites
out of 10 amazing ones.

22
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,370
There were so many amazing sights to
even narrow it down to 10 was very

23
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,150
difficult,

24
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,290
but we got these four.

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,590
So the four are Jeremy Jones,

26
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:56,251
which is me.

27
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:57,930
So chasers.com.

28
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,150
And what that is,

29
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,710
is all photographs of storms.

30
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,270
Really Wild Shit.

31
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:08,271
This guy just took these incredible high
definition photographs of tornadoes and

32
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,350
cloud systems.

33
00:01:10,351 --> 00:01:14,040
It's just a really vibrant and it's
simple and big and I just thought it was a

34
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:19,041
bad ass website and the
next one was Claire Horn and
Claire is if a is an artist

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,020
and this is just a all from Nashville,

36
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:26,490
works by visual based,

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,160
a Nashville based visual artists,

38
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:31,610
Claire Horn and all just
really cool artwork,

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,150
but I just like how the website was set
up so we went with that one and then

40
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,550
there is a who the other ones,

41
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,620
adk ventures,

42
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,260
which is all really cool
wildlife photographs.

43
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,011
If you click on that,

44
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:45,210
it'll tell you what that one is.

45
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,780
And then goat soup and whiskey,

46
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:49,614
which is a.

47
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,870
it's a place in Colorado that is a.

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,300
it's a at a ski resort.

49
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,613
It's like a,

50
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,330
I guess it's like a tavern
or something like that.

51
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,493
Whatever it is.

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,771
Cool.

53
00:01:58,771 --> 00:01:59,490
Website.

54
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,660
I really like how they did it.

55
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:02,460
I like how they layered
the pages over each other.

56
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:03,540
You scroll over them.

57
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:05,940
They have pooled tournament
so throughout on my good side,

58
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,560
I just think they did a great job with it.

59
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,770
So those are our four and a
thank you to those people.

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,161

61

64
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,740
Let's me talk t shirts.

65
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,790
Okay.

66
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,720

00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:34,380
That's Joe and the number one number

71
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:36,660
So congratulations to everyone that one.

72
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,770
And uh,

73
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:38,610
to everyone else.

74
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:38,911
Look,

75
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,230
there was so many amazing websites.

76
00:02:40,231 --> 00:02:42,240
It's really ridiculous that
we even picked for that.

77
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,860
The one that was number one for me though.

78
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,210
Was that a storm chaser?

79
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:45,930
Shit,

80
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,621
that was me.

81
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:47,640
So chasers.com.

82
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,990
That's my favorite one.

83
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,680
Sorry.

84
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:49,891
Sorry,

85
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:50,640
everybody else.

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,473
I pick a favorite.

87
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,560
Uh,

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,120
we're also brought to you
by [inaudible] dot com.

89
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:59,121
That's o n n I t a makers of Alpha brain
and shroom tech and all sorts of cool

90
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:01,080
supplements as well.

91
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,650
Strength and conditioning equipment.

92
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:06,970
If you are involved in any
sort of athletic endeavor
and you want to strengthen

93
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:10,000
up your body and improve
your athletic performance,

94
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,650
we have everything you needed on it.

95
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,920
We have everything from
medicine balls to battle ropes,

96
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,813
ab wheels.

97
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,770
We have workout dvds,

98
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:19,870
which I really suggest you follow
if you don't know what you're doing,

99
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:23,800
especially in ones that even if you're
in really good shape like the Keith

100
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,110
Weber,

101
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:26,190
a extreme cardio conditioning workout.

102
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,190
It's a fantastic one.

103
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,690
Even for someone who's
in really good shape,

104
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:29,680
go there,

105
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,430
check it out,

106
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,350
use the codeword Rogan and you will save
10 percent off any and all supplements.

107
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,700
With all of the supplements.

108
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,900
One of the things we stress at on it,

109
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,430
we're selling you things that we use.

110
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:43,870
We're selling you things we believe in
and we have a 100 percent money back

111
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:47,650
guarantee on the first
30 pills for 90 days.

112
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,490
You try it and you say,

113
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,420
this is nonsense.

114
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,310
Just you don't even have to return it.

115
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,020
You don't even have to
send them the product back.

116
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,950
You just get your money back.

117
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:57,010
I'm sure Peter Shift would say
that is a ridiculous statement.

118
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,090
You can't even do that.

119
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:59,830
It's not smart economically,

120
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,760
and I agree with him,

121
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,830
but we do it anyway because
we're selling you good shit.

122
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:06,370
O n n I t use the code word Rogan.

123
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,650
Save 10 percent off any
and all supplements.

124
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,040
All right.

125
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,000
Peter Schiff is here.

126
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:11,043
Cue The music.

127
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,250
Let's get this pop in.

128
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,750
The Internet is a buzz.

129
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:16,180
People are very excited to talk to you.

130
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
Joe Rogan podcast.

131
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,923
Peter Schiff.

132
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,970
How are you sir?

133
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:25,610
I'm well.

134
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,150
Well Joe,

135
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,790
thanks for having me on the podcast.

136
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,121
Please.

137
00:04:28,121 --> 00:04:28,570
Thank you.

138
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,291
Thank you for doing this.

139
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,124
I really appreciate it.

140
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,340
I have zero background in economics.

141
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:36,130
I'm a mathematical retard and uh,

142
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:40,660
I really appreciate people like you
out there that can spell things out and

143
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,250
explain what's wrong with this ridiculous
system that we operate under and

144
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,200
what's right about this ridiculousness.

145
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:47,470
Yeah.

146
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:47,661
You know,

147
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,010
don't sell yourself short though.

148
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:52,310
Just your common sense might mean you
know more about economics and people who

149
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:54,640
actually have Nobel prizes in economics.

150
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,591
Well,

151
00:04:55,591 --> 00:04:56,910
I would disagree with you,

152
00:04:56,911 --> 00:05:00,870
but I saw that movie inside job and I saw
how the whole system works where they,

153
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:01,530
you know,

154
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,060
essentially set these
financial limitations and then
wind up getting jobs after

155
00:05:06,061 --> 00:05:06,301
their,

156
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:06,510
you know,

157
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,470
the economics professors set
these limitations and then
wind up getting jobs and

158
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:14,190
wind up profiting off of the fact that
they made it so that these things go

159
00:05:14,191 --> 00:05:19,191
through you and your video from occupy
Wall Street is one of my all time

160
00:05:20,011 --> 00:05:22,800
favorites when you went
down there and he said,

161
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:24,030
I am the one percent,

162
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,840
and you started talking
to just knuckleheads,

163
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,720
knock and I know you didn't cherry pick
because he had a few intelligent people

164
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:31,554
in there too,

165
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,370
but it was beautifully representative
of what's actually going on.

166
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:37,440
This sort of emotional outrage,

167
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:37,960
this,

168
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,960
this wanting to understand and explain
why our economy is in such a mess,

169
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:46,710
but having this very distorted perception
of the actual facts themselves.

170
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:46,991
Yeah,

171
00:05:46,991 --> 00:05:47,361
and you know,

172
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:51,710
my purpose of going down there
was to call attention to the.

173
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,180
They,

174
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:57,050
I think they misdiagnosed or
misunderstood what was really going on.

175
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:02,410
They bought into this idea that it's
capitalism or the free market that is the

176
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,344
problem.

177
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:08,410
And so they were blaming maybe Wall Street
because they looked at Wall Street is

178
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:11,030
somehow epitomizing American capitalism.

179
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,950
And I wanted to point out that
what they were really upset wet,

180
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,370
oh,

181
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,610
ad was not capitalism,

182
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,060
right?

183
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,351
It,

184
00:06:17,351 --> 00:06:17,431
it,

185
00:06:17,431 --> 00:06:17,581
it,

186
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:18,860
it was because of government.

187
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:22,850
It was because of central banking and
central planning and crony capitalism.

188
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,280
That was the source of all their problems.

189
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:28,790
That really the solution to the
problems is free market capitalism.

190
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,380
They just don't understand it.

191
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:33,590
And so I wanted to go there and
explain to the people in that park,

192
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:34,190
uh,

193
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,120
but more importantly,

194
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,110
if people watch the interactions
between me and the occupiers,

195
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:39,680
uh,

196
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,680
to try to really expose how ridiculous
the things that they're saying are.

197
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,650
I understood that they were
upset and they were frustrated.

198
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:48,980
But,

199
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:49,221
you know,

200
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:51,350
the source of their
frustration was misplaced.

201
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:51,501
I mean,

202
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:53,630
they shouldn't be protesting Washington.

203
00:06:53,631 --> 00:06:56,570
They should be protesting
the Federal Reserve Congress.

204
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,260
Uh,

205
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,071
not Wall Street.

206
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:58,221
I mean,

207
00:06:58,221 --> 00:07:00,620
what's going on on Wall Street
is a symptom of the problem,

208
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,040
but it's not capitalism because when
you have the government and Wall Street

209
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,240
working together,

210
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,900
uh,

211
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,081
you know,

212
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:07,280
that's not the free market.

213
00:07:07,281 --> 00:07:07,740
I mean,

214
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,160
the government that is
at the source of it,

215
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,470
it's not necessarily the bank's fault,

216
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,340
uh,

217
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,091
it sure they,

218
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:15,740
everybody wants something from government,

219
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:19,670
but the government should deny right?

220
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:19,831
When,

221
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:20,120
when,

222
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,760
when somebody wants to bail out or
somebody wants something for nothing,

223
00:07:22,761 --> 00:07:24,440
the government should not supply it.

224
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:28,670
I can't necessarily blame Wall Street
for wanting something for nothing,

225
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:31,190
but I blame the government
for supplying it.

226
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:31,731
Now,

227
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:32,480
how do,

228
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,313
how do,

229
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,310
do they supply it?

230
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,380
Do they supply it?

231
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:39,070
Because the people that are asking
for them to supply it are the ones who

232
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:41,440
contributed to their campaigns
and got them into office.

233
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
And then once they get in there,

234
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:43,834
they acquiesced.

235
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,861
That's part of it.

236
00:07:44,861 --> 00:07:46,220
But a lot of it is the,

237
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,600
the,

238
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,040
the government wants to maintain
the illusion of prosperity,

239
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:52,720
the illusion of economic growth.

240
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,220
Uh,

241
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,470
and so the way they do that now
is through the financial markets,

242
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:57,370
through assets.

243
00:07:57,371 --> 00:07:59,500
And they get the stock market to go up,

244
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:02,860
they get the real estate market
to go up and somehow they,

245
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:05,980
they pretend that that means that the
economy's getting better just because

246
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:07,420
asset prices are rising,

247
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,910
but that's not really economic growth,

248
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:12,400
just because the price
of some asset goes up.

249
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:12,800
I mean,

250
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,600
what's economic growth is when
your economy produces more stuff,

251
00:08:16,601 --> 00:08:20,830
when you have more output of the goods
and services that make people's lives

252
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:21,131
better,

253
00:08:21,131 --> 00:08:21,311
right?

254
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:23,050
You want to grow your standard of living.

255
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:23,860
Um,

256
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,370
you know,

257
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,600
if people are poor,

258
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,490
they're poor because they
don't have enough stuff,

259
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:27,731
right?

260
00:08:27,731 --> 00:08:30,640
So we have to produce more
stuff for people to consume.

261
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:32,590
And that's not what's
happening in the US economy.

262
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,470
It's not like we've gotten more
factories turning out more stuff.

263
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,910
All that they do is they get asset prices
to rise so that people can borrow more

264
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:43,240
money against those inflated
asset values and then spend it.

265
00:08:43,241 --> 00:08:45,640
But we're buying things that
are made in other countries.

266
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,890
It doesn't evidence economic growth here.

267
00:08:47,891 --> 00:08:51,120
It evidences the economic growth in the
countries who are able to produce all

268
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,530
the things that we have to
borrow money to consume,

269
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,310
but it doesn't benefit average American.

270
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,880
That's why the average American is
suffering as a result of this massive

271
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:02,750
transfer of wealth that is emanating from,

272
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,631
from government,

273
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,710
from the Federal Reserve,

274
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:06,030
and from what was what,

275
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:08,820
what's happening in
Congress in the White House,

276
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,240
but they point to these asset markets
as evidence that their policies are of

277
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:14,940
success.

278
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,870
But then meanwhile,

279
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:19,980
you know their policies or complete
failure if you judge it by what's actually

280
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,480
going on in the economy.

281
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:25,440
And of course everything they're doing
now is just setting the stage for a

282
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,730
economic disaster that is going to be
much worse than what we had in 2008.

283
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:30,571
Well,

284
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,130
you predicted the one in 2008.

285
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,550
Uh,

286
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,540
you saw it coming.

287
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:33,960
You,

288
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,430
you,

289
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,470
you talked about it on multiple occasions
that we're eventually going to have

290
00:09:37,471 --> 00:09:38,790
some large real estate clubs.

291
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,340
W when that happens,

292
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,660
this is where I get confused.

293
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:43,980
So that happens.

294
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,900
And then when there's a real situation
like that where banks are in jeopardy,

295
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,040
what,

296
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,360
what transpires there,

297
00:09:51,361 --> 00:09:52,830
like who votes on it,

298
00:09:52,831 --> 00:09:53,140
who,

299
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:56,940
who decides and agrees that you're going
to take taxpayer money and what are the

300
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:58,560
repercussions of them not doing it.

301
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,180
So they didn't bail the banks out.

302
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,200
What would have happened?

303
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:01,441
Well,

304
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:06,150
it would have been far more painful
certainly at that time to deal with our

305
00:10:06,151 --> 00:10:06,960
problems.

306
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,860
It's always painful.

307
00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:08,694
I mean if you're,

308
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,330
if you're a drug addict and you want
to deal with it and you want to go cold

309
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,470
Turkey and go to rehab,

310
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,461
that's painful.

311
00:10:14,461 --> 00:10:15,870
It's easier to keep taking drugs,

312
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:16,081
right?

313
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,150
If you're overweight and you know,

314
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:20,040
is it easier to go on a diet and exercise?

315
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,130
We'll just keep on
picking out and you know,

316
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:25,530
so it's always difficult to do
the right thing in the short run,

317
00:10:25,531 --> 00:10:27,150
but it pays off in the long run.

318
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,560
And so if you want to go back to the
origin of the [inaudible] eight financial

319
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,220
crisis,

320
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,220
you go look to the stock market bubble
that burst in 2000 and the recession that

321
00:10:37,591 --> 00:10:38,490
began in 2000.

322
00:10:38,491 --> 00:10:38,761
And one,

323
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:39,151
a lot of it,

324
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:39,301
you know,

325
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:42,090
you had the September 11th tragedy,

326
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:42,601
uh,

327
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:44,750
and we were going into a recession and,

328
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,590
and so instead of allowing the
pain of a recession to play out,

329
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,600
and of course nobody enjoys a recession,

330
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,180
but recessions are actually necessary.

331
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,320
That's the process.

332
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,150
We're all the mistakes that were
made during the boom or corrected.

333
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,770
And of course we made a lot of
mistakes during the tech boom.

334
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,600
A lot of companies were funded,

335
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,590
hired people,

336
00:11:04,591 --> 00:11:07,530
rented office space that never should've
started because they had no real

337
00:11:07,531 --> 00:11:08,191
business plans.

338
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:09,210
They couldn't make any money.

339
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:14,400
We did a lot of stupid things during the
19 nineties bubble and they needed to

340
00:11:14,401 --> 00:11:16,680
be corrected during the recession.

341
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,330
But the politicians,

342
00:11:18,331 --> 00:11:18,511
you know,

343
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,010
Bush had just become president.

344
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:23,670
He didn't want a big recession on his
first term because of course he wanted a

345
00:11:23,671 --> 00:11:24,504
second term.

346
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,350
And so Alan Greenspan cooperated with
Bush because he wanted to get reappointed.

347
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,230
And so they had a big monetary stimulus.

348
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:31,361
They,

349
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:33,750
they dropped interest
rates down to one percent,

350
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,910
which is high by today's standards.

351
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,490
But it was a record low back then.

352
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,020
And a lot of the money that was going
into the stock market went into the real

353
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:43,711
estate market.

354
00:11:43,711 --> 00:11:46,890
So we replaced the stock market bubble
with a real estate bubble that actually

355
00:11:46,891 --> 00:11:49,680
had began forming a few years earlier.

356
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,980
But it really gathered
momentum after the real estate,

357
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,430
the stock market bubble burst.

358
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,970
And so the real estate bubble got all
the air and so now housing prices were

359
00:11:57,971 --> 00:11:59,950
going up and because they were going up,

360
00:11:59,951 --> 00:12:00,610
people were.

361
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,600
I thought they were rich.

362
00:12:01,601 --> 00:12:02,710
So they went out and spent money.

363
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,311
They didn't have.

364
00:12:03,311 --> 00:12:05,190
They borrowed it against
the appreciating buyer,

365
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,033
their houses.

366
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,240
They bought more houses,

367
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:08,080
they bought cars,

368
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:09,010
they took vacations.

369
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,500
And during that time I
knew this was a mania.

370
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:16,710
I knew that the big crisis though for the
real estate market was not going to be

371
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:20,140
the buyer of real estate because
in the stock market bubble,

372
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,700
when the stock market bubble burst,

373
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,300
it was the people who bought stocks who
lost because they were buying gambling

374
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:26,134
with their own money.

375
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,180
But when people were buying houses,

376
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:29,800
they were gambling with the bank's money.

377
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:30,911
But in fact,

378
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:34,060
it was taxpayer money because the banks
were all guaranteed by the government,

379
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,870
and so I knew when the real estate bubble
burst and prices went down that the

380
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:40,570
banks would be insolvent and
that the banks would fail.

381
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,260
Now had the government allowed
real estate prices to fall,

382
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,190
which was a good thing.

383
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,600
The problem was that they went up.

384
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:47,560
Coming back down,

385
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:49,030
was was reality coming back.

386
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,740
Had the government allowed the banks
to fail and real estate prices to keep

387
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:54,574
falling.

388
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,010
It would have been more
painful in the short run,

389
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:59,020
but it would have been necessary pain.

390
00:12:59,021 --> 00:13:02,830
It would have been constructive pain
because we would have laid the foundation

391
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,050
for a legitimate economic recovery,

392
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,060
which is what we should've done in 2001.

393
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,050
We shouldn't have had that.

394
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,490
All that monetary stimulus.

395
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,230
We shouldn't have
created a housing bubble.

396
00:13:11,231 --> 00:13:14,980
We should have just endured the pain
and then we would have been in better

397
00:13:14,981 --> 00:13:15,460
shape.

398
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:16,540
So they.

399
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,660
They blew up this housing
bubble and now when it bursts,

400
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,580
they didn't learn from their mistakes.

401
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:22,291
Ben Bernanke,

402
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:25,360
he just repeated all the
mistakes of Alan Greenspan.

403
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,500
Only this time interest rates had
to come to zero because you know,

404
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,840
it was an even bigger crisis and
now we have all the money printing.

405
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,220
They called quantitative easing,

406
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,740
but we have much easier,

407
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,110
much more aggressive monetary stimulus.

408
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,780
Now we're doing far more
damage to the economy.

409
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,330
We've managed to reflate
the stock market bubble.

410
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,400
We've reflated the real estate bubble.

411
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:48,520
We have more debt as a
society than ever before.

412
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:48,860
Uh,

413
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,990
the government has more debt,

414
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:51,160
corporations have more debt,

415
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:51,791
individuals.

416
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,391
There's no pen,

417
00:13:52,391 --> 00:13:53,360
no d leveraging.

418
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,130
We take,

419
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:59,130
we were in a deep hole and then we dug
a lot deeper and we've set the stage a

420
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,400
Ben Bernanke has set the stage for a
much greater economic crisis than the one

421
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,690
from 2008.

422
00:14:04,691 --> 00:14:06,400
It's going to blow up on Janet Yellen,

423
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,270
just like the Greenspan
bubble blew up on Bernacchi.

424
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:12,340
That Bernacchi bubble is
going to blow up on yelling.

425
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:16,630
It's much bigger and I'm afraid that
yellen is going to do more of the same.

426
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:19,460
Only worse when she gets in and,

427
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:19,750
and,

428
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,740
and we're in for a,

429
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:20,960
you know,

430
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,550
a much worse economic crisis because
this one I think is going to be where the

431
00:14:24,551 --> 00:14:29,200
dollar collapses and that's going to
usher in a lot more pain for ordinary

432
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,300
Americans than the bursting
of the stock market.

433
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,134
Butler of the housing bubble.

434
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,630
Back to that word pain because this where
what I really was confused about when

435
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,330
you say that it would have caused a
lot more pain if the banks had failed,

436
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:40,700
but ultimately it would have been better
because we were figured out what was

437
00:14:40,701 --> 00:14:42,180
wrong and then and not allow that to go.

438
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,250
What kind of pain would that have been
when you're dealing with federally

439
00:14:46,251 --> 00:14:47,084
insured banks?

440
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:48,920
So if the average person,

441
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,140
how much of their money would be insured?

442
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,711
The government,

443
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:54,860
if banks collapse and then
where does that money come from?

444
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,420
If they have to ensure all the people
who had money in the bank accounts?

445
00:14:59,520 --> 00:14:59,701
Yeah.

446
00:14:59,701 --> 00:15:00,960
Well theoretically right?

447
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:03,970
I mean the government now stands behind a,

448
00:15:03,971 --> 00:15:04,460
you know,

449
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,340
the bank accounts.

450
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:05,590
I mean,

451
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,050
the FDA has a limit,

452
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:08,760
maybe $250,000,

453
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:09,960
but the government is,

454
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:10,560
you know,

455
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,131
bailed out,

456
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,610
banks know when they fail,

457
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:13,560
they bell at everybody.

458
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,580
I mean,

459
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,450
that's a mistake.

460
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,210
We shouldn't have any
government insured deposits.

461
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:18,451
I mean,

462
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:18,611
it's,

463
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:20,010
it's a huge moral hazard,

464
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,550
uh,

465
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,201
because,

466
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:21,600
you know,

467
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,230
people now will put their money into
banks and no one cares what the bank does

468
00:15:25,231 --> 00:15:28,800
with their money because the government
ensures the account so the banks can be

469
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:31,860
as reckless as they want and
there's no free market penalty.

470
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,070
If we had a free market and
banking like we had at one point,

471
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,310
banks couldn't be reckless because
they wouldn't have any depositors.

472
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,970
Depositors would care about what
the bank does with their money.

473
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,770
And so in order to get the positives,

474
00:15:43,771 --> 00:15:47,400
banks would have to be cautious and
they would advertise how safe their

475
00:15:47,401 --> 00:15:48,360
portfolios were.

476
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,240
And you would have companies
that would rate them and say,

477
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,770
this is a good bank to put your money.

478
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:53,131
Uh,

479
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:53,641
but right now,

480
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:54,390
nobody cares.

481
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,223
They're all the same.

482
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:55,771
Right?

483
00:15:55,771 --> 00:15:57,240
And so you'll put your money anywhere.

484
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,560
How much of your money is insured?

485
00:15:58,890 --> 00:15:59,131
Well,

486
00:15:59,131 --> 00:16:01,380
it's theoretically the
government insurers at all,

487
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,500
but you have $10,000,000 in
the bank and the bank fails.

488
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,670
The government gives you 10 million.

489
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,240
Well,

490
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,073
it doesn't seem no.

491
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:06,740
Well,

492
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,150
that's what they've done in the past.

493
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,580
They're only technically supposed
to give you now $250,000,

494
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,550
but they have given you all of it.

495
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:18,551
But the problem is only smaller
banks have failed so far.

496
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:18,990
But if,

497
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,360
if a large bank were to fail,

498
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,890
there's not enough money in the
FDC to bail out the depositors.

499
00:16:24,891 --> 00:16:27,740
So the government would have to create it.

500
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:30,050
The Federal Reserve would have
to print it into existence.

501
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:30,560
And,

502
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,930
and so what's ultimately
gonna Happen is sure,

503
00:16:32,931 --> 00:16:34,010
we've got all these insured,

504
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:34,970
Bank du Pont counts,

505
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,780
but if a bit a couple of big banks fail
and the government has to print all the

506
00:16:38,781 --> 00:16:40,880
money to reimburse the depositors,

507
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,060
you have massive inflation and it,

508
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:43,211
you know,

509
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:44,150
you get your money back,

510
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,880
but you can't buy anything with it
or you can't buy nearly as much.

511
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,900
What would actually happen if the
government had done the right thing and

512
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:52,160
allowed banks to fail?

513
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,210
Um,

514
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,310
then some depositors
would have lost money,

515
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,250
some depositors would have not got
back one hundred cents on the dollar,

516
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,070
but in the long run that would be better
off than getting back all your money

517
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:02,300
and have it not by anything.

518
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:03,350
And you know,

519
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,030
there would have been
paying for some people,

520
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,390
right?

521
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,640
The government would've been
forced to cut a lot of spending.

522
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,100
Uh,

523
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,670
the government would have had to lay
people off and so that would be good for

524
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:11,360
the economy,

525
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,910
wouldn't be good in the short
run for the guy who got laid off.

526
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,350
Now he has to go get a real job.

527
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:15,860
Uh,

528
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,240
but the government would
have to start cutting,

529
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:19,730
spending real estate
prices would have fallen.

530
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:20,451
So people,

531
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:20,631
you know,

532
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:22,190
some people would lose that home equity.

533
00:17:22,191 --> 00:17:22,691
But you know,

534
00:17:22,691 --> 00:17:22,971
if you,

535
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,910
if you don't have a house
falling real estate prices are,

536
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,230
is a good thing for you.

537
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:27,531
I mean,

538
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:28,730
the government always talks about,

539
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:29,120
you know,

540
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,800
trying to make homeownership affordable.

541
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,101
Well,

542
00:17:31,101 --> 00:17:33,020
the best way to do that
as the prices come down,

543
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,920
why is the government trying to stop
real estate prices from coming down when

544
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:38,780
they say they want
houses to be affordable?

545
00:17:38,781 --> 00:17:42,710
What the government wants is to prop up
real estate prices at artificial levels,

546
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,020
so you have to borrow a
fortune to buy a house,

547
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:48,500
but then they want to subsidize the debt
so they do the same thing with college.

548
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:49,050
They want.

549
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,310
They want everyone to go to college,

550
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:54,150
but they don't want college tuition
to come down because of the government

551
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,990
guarantees all the student loans and
so that's why college is so expensive

552
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:01,290
because the students take
all that government money
and they'd been up tuition

553
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,730
and the colleges know that.

554
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:06,150
It doesn't matter how high the prices
are because the kids are going to get the

555
00:18:06,151 --> 00:18:07,950
money from the government
to pay the price,

556
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:09,330
but meanwhile they graduate.

557
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:12,270
They've got these worthless degrees
and they got a pile of debt.

558
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:15,900
If the government just got out of the
way and they didn't give out all this

559
00:18:15,901 --> 00:18:17,550
money to students than the university is,

560
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:20,760
we'd have to slash tuition or they'd
have no customers and now you can get a

561
00:18:20,761 --> 00:18:23,070
college degree without
taking out a mortgage.

562
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,650
Are you aware that famous Putin quote
before the crash about the economy wasn't

563
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,030
hooten said he didn't know.

564
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:30,820
I don't understand the
United States economy.

565
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:33,100
It seems they only buy and
sell each other's houses.

566
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,163
Well,

567
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,410
yeah,

568
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:34,621
that's.

569
00:18:34,621 --> 00:18:37,560
We had an economy that was
all about flipping houses.

570
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,360
A strange though,

571
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,890
but we,

572
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,020
we,

573
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:45,020
we have this service sector economy
now that is completely unbelievable,

574
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,670
uh,

575
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,271
because it's,

576
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:48,810
it's the result of our ability right to,

577
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:53,630
to borrow indefinitely from abroad to pay
for the products that are manufactured

578
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:54,540
in other countries.

579
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,080
Uh,

580
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,030
but this bubble is going to burst because,

581
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,190
you know,

582
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,580
we can't keep borrowing the world.

583
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:00,090
Keep,

584
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,350
can't keep lending us money.

585
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:06,351
It's like a giant vendor financing scheme
where other countries produce products

586
00:19:06,901 --> 00:19:08,820
and then they lend us the
money to buy those products.

587
00:19:08,821 --> 00:19:11,550
But we can't pay back any of the
money we've already borrowed yet.

588
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:14,850
They keep lending us more because they
don't want to deal with the reality of

589
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:15,840
how much money they've lost.

590
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,360
What,

591
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,140
what kind of an epic change
would be involved in,

592
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,790
in getting away from this trend,

593
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:24,450
what kind of an epic change
would be involved in making
sure that the government

594
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:25,980
doesn't subsidize universities,

595
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:28,920
that making sure that
housing costs do go down,

596
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:32,490
making sure that banks
aren't government protected.

597
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,260
What I mean that seems like it would.

598
00:19:34,261 --> 00:19:36,270
It would take an epic change.

599
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,550
Well that it is.

600
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,510
I think because it's

601
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,730
going to take a crisis
and I think fortunately or
unfortunately that crisis is

602
00:19:42,731 --> 00:19:43,121
coming.

603
00:19:43,121 --> 00:19:46,300
There's going to be a crisis that we
can't print our way out of that we can't

604
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,800
bail are way out of and,

605
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,240
and I think that's where we are.

606
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:49,451
I mean,

607
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:53,240
I think the bubble that we have
now is just so big and I think the,

608
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:53,381
the,

609
00:19:53,381 --> 00:19:53,551
the,

610
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:55,040
the Fed knows that it's,

611
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,021
it's so big.

612
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:56,980
It's too big to pop,

613
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,570
forgetting about too big to fail,

614
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:00,070
that there is no more bubbles.

615
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,210
This is the last Hurrah for,

616
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,930
for our phone.

617
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:04,490
Economy goes.

618
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,190
There's,

619
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:05,680
there's no,

620
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,060
there's nothing left to do once,

621
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:11,530
once this collapses and then maybe
there'll be the catalyst to do the right

622
00:20:11,531 --> 00:20:11,741
thing,

623
00:20:11,741 --> 00:20:15,610
but I think the way the collapse is going
to come is going to be in the value of

624
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:16,241
our currency,

625
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:18,580
which right now is relatively stable.

626
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,070
It's actually risen recently
against some currencies,

627
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:21,671
uh,

628
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,200
although not all currencies,

629
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,590
but I think that the Fed is
going to keep on printing money.

630
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:30,940
There's an expectation right now that
there's a real economic recovery and that

631
00:20:30,941 --> 00:20:34,930
the Fed is going to be able
to remove the monetary props.

632
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,200
There is no real recovery and
the Fed can't remove the props.

633
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,063
It should,

634
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,030
but the minute it did,

635
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:41,440
the whole economy would implode.

636
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,190
I think as people begun
begin to realize that,

637
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:47,890
to appreciate what the Fed created,

638
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,120
right?

639
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,660
Not a sustainable recovery but it,

640
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,870
but a bubble there.

641
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:54,850
The world is not going to want our dollars
anymore because the Fed has to keep

642
00:20:54,851 --> 00:20:57,130
printing dollars to buy bonds.

643
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:57,780
Uh,

644
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,290
so that we can keep borrowing money.

645
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,060
The government can keep borrowing money,

646
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:03,970
but when people don't want the
dollars at the Fed is creating.

647
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,320
Now the value of the dollar starts to go
down and that's when you start to see a

648
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:11,530
real acceleration in
prices for consumer goods.

649
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:11,781
I mean,

650
00:21:11,781 --> 00:21:14,920
and the government tries to
deny that there is inflation,

651
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,540
but there's massive inflation.

652
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,330
It's not all showing up
yet in consumer prices,

653
00:21:19,331 --> 00:21:24,331
although a lot of prices looking since
2009 mil prices have more than doubled.

654
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,510
Uh,

655
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,340
I think beef prices chop me.

656
00:21:27,341 --> 00:21:28,320
Prices are up 80,

657
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,171
90 percent.

658
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:29,351
I mean,

659
00:21:29,351 --> 00:21:30,960
look at gasoline price at record highs.

660
00:21:30,961 --> 00:21:32,560
So the government tells
us there's no inflation,

661
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,820
but there's plenty of it,

662
00:21:33,821 --> 00:21:35,320
but it's going to get a lot worse.

663
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,120
That is the bad news.

664
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:37,241
Now,

665
00:21:37,241 --> 00:21:41,710
the government is actually trying to
lay the foundation for higher inflation

666
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:42,350
now,

667
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:42,640
uh,

668
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,530
by trying to tell us
that it's a good thing.

669
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,780
You know,

670
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:44,920
if,

671
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,311
if you,

672
00:21:45,311 --> 00:21:47,470
if you listen to the economist today,

673
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:48,970
they'll tell you that the scariest thing,

674
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:51,880
that worst thing that can happen is
that we don't have enough inflation.

675
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,680
That we have to make sure that prices
are rising fast enough to have economic

676
00:21:56,681 --> 00:21:56,980
growth.

677
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,960
They used to say that
we want stable prices.

678
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,790
Now they tell us that that's dangerous.

679
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,040
That's a bad thing because
if prices are stable,

680
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:06,010
they might actually go down a little
bit and that would be horrible.

681
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:06,540
Right?

682
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,270
So the government wants us to be thankful
when the cost of living goes up when

683
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:11,590
obviously you know,

684
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,920
a good strong economy has
fallen consumer prices.

685
00:22:14,921 --> 00:22:16,360
That's the goal of an economy.

686
00:22:16,361 --> 00:22:19,750
It's to bring prices down so
that people can buy more stuff.

687
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:24,250
Is the problem in competent intervention
in the market or is the problem that

688
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,830
it's just a system that can't be fixed?

689
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,023
Well,

690
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,550
that right now the system can't be fixed,

691
00:22:30,551 --> 00:22:31,660
it's just going to collapse,

692
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,553
but the.

693
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,251
So it has to do.

694
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,084
In your opinion,

695
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,110
should it has to?

696
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,381
Yeah,

697
00:22:35,381 --> 00:22:35,950
it will,

698
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,710
but there are a lot of incentives
to keep it going right,

699
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:40,510
to keep the party going
as long as possible.

700
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,310
The politicians want to keep it going.

701
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,480
I mean they love phony prosperity because
it's better than reality because if

702
00:22:46,481 --> 00:22:48,070
the public knew how screwed they were,

703
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,431
right,

704
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:50,530
they might not reelect
the guys that are there,

705
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,540
so they want to keep it going.

706
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:54,760
They have no incentive
to rain on the parade,

707
00:22:54,761 --> 00:22:56,410
they don't want to solve any problems.

708
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:56,890
Uh,

709
00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:57,251
they just,

710
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:58,870
they just want to get
through the next election,

711
00:22:59,380 --> 00:22:59,860
uh,

712
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,611
Wall Street,

713
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:00,821
I mean,

714
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:01,900
they're making a ton of money.

715
00:23:01,901 --> 00:23:02,081
I mean,

716
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:06,850
there are people that are making a fortune
off of this bad monetary policy and

717
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:08,050
so they don't want it to stop.

718
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,340
They don't want to deal with reality.

719
00:23:09,341 --> 00:23:10,810
They want to just keep making,

720
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,171
you know,

721
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:12,610
making hay while the sun shines.

722
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,410
And the academics,

723
00:23:14,411 --> 00:23:14,801
the media,

724
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,780
I think these guys are just clueless.

725
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,490
Uh,

726
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,640
so nobody really,

727
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:19,070
you know,

728
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,810
hasn't either understands or has a
vested interest to understand the truth.

729
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,520
Everybody wants to keep the party going.

730
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,730
That was exactly what was going on in
2003 and four and five and six when I was

731
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,810
going around going on TV shows,

732
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:32,410
given,

733
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,430
given lectures,

734
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,180
uh,

735
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,480
explaining all the problems in the housing
market and how the Fed was creating

736
00:23:37,481 --> 00:23:39,760
it and how bad it was going
to be when the bubble burst.

737
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,230
Nobody wanted to hear it.

738
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:41,501
I mean,

739
00:23:41,501 --> 00:23:43,180
everybody either laughed at me,

740
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:44,170
ridiculed me,

741
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,690
and this,

742
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,070
this should have been obvious.

743
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:49,520
This should've been crystal
clear yet people couldn't see it.

744
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,970
And then everybody was
blindsided by what happened.

745
00:23:52,971 --> 00:23:53,181
They said,

746
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:53,331
well,

747
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:55,160
nobody could have possibly predicted this.

748
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:55,371
Right?

749
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:56,690
Of course that was wrong.

750
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,833
Um,

751
00:23:57,950 --> 00:23:58,280
but,

752
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:58,730
you know,

753
00:23:58,730 --> 00:23:59,630
and then instead of,

754
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:00,470
you know,

755
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,360
learning from the mistakes or instead of,

756
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:02,571
you know,

757
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:05,660
listening to people like me and I wasn't
the only guy that was out there talking

758
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:05,870
about,

759
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,150
I just did it maybe more
publicly than a lot of people.

760
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,141
But instead of saying,

761
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:09,381
Hey,

762
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:09,561
you know,

763
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:10,550
let's talk to Peter Schiff,

764
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:10,701
you know,

765
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:10,940
he,

766
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,080
he saw this thing come in,

767
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,980
uh,

768
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,340
you know,

769
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,121
what does he think,

770
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:14,271
you know,

771
00:24:14,271 --> 00:24:14,630
they,

772
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:14,961
they had,

773
00:24:14,961 --> 00:24:15,200
uh,

774
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,420
a government inquiry,

775
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,081
uh,

776
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,190
to the financial crisis.

777
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,180
It right after it happened.

778
00:24:20,181 --> 00:24:22,820
It was an investigation as to
why there was a financial crisis.

779
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,781
And you would've thought,

780
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:23,900
Gee,

781
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,733
I wrote a book,

782
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,120
predicted the financial crisis,

783
00:24:26,121 --> 00:24:29,030
crash proof how to profit from the
coming economic collapse that described

784
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:29,930
exactly what happened.

785
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:30,921
I wrote about it.

786
00:24:30,921 --> 00:24:32,120
I talked about it for years.

787
00:24:32,121 --> 00:24:33,680
I have all these essays on the Internet,

788
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:35,640
there's all these youtube
videos you can see,

789
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:36,400
you know,

790
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,071
conferences.

791
00:24:37,071 --> 00:24:39,410
Look at my mortgage
bankers speech from 2006.

792
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:39,890
I was like,

793
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:40,460
great,

794
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,640
why don't I go and testify in front
of Congress and explain why we had a

795
00:24:43,641 --> 00:24:44,474
financial crisis.

796
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,560
They wouldn't call me,

797
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:45,951
of course,

798
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:46,610
not

799
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,100
say something exactly like you said
in the first 15 minutes of this.

800
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:49,681
Yeah,

801
00:24:49,681 --> 00:24:50,461
they don't want to hear it.

802
00:24:50,461 --> 00:24:50,821
In fact,

803
00:24:50,821 --> 00:24:54,990
I did testify twice in front of
Congress later on and you can see those

804
00:24:54,991 --> 00:24:56,090
testimonies are on youtube.

805
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,000
And I was actually surprised that they
invited me back a second time after I

806
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:00,840
testified the first time.

807
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:03,570
I think maybe some people
didn't really realize who I was.

808
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:05,400
And so they haven't invited
me back a third time,

809
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:06,031
but,

810
00:25:06,031 --> 00:25:06,211
you know,

811
00:25:06,211 --> 00:25:09,090
I'd tell them the truth and I treat
these guys like they ought to be treated.

812
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:11,850
I don't really show any respect for
people that are destroying our country.

813
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:12,710
Uh,

814
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,260
and so I put them in their place when,

815
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,001
when I testify,

816
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:17,370
but they didn't really
want anybody testifying,

817
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:18,001
uh,

818
00:25:18,001 --> 00:25:18,660
who,

819
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,080
uh,

820
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,360
knew why there was a crisis
because they already had,

821
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,400
they already had a
preconceived conclusion.

822
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,140
They wanted to blame it on capitalism.

823
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,020
They wanted to say we had a crisis
because we didn't have enough regulation

824
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,370
because we didn't have enough government,

825
00:25:29,371 --> 00:25:31,680
which of course was the opposite
of why we had the crisis.

826
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:33,780
We had too much regulation
and too much government.

827
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,850
The free market would have
prevented that crisis.

828
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,820
Now you say that you don't
believe in regulation,

829
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,850
but do you agree with when
it comes to regulation,

830
00:25:42,851 --> 00:25:45,100
when it comes to
environmental protections,

831
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,690
when it comes to things like the EPA
or when it comes to like situations,

832
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:53,260
like what do you do about when you
have this massive Gulf oil spill,

833
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,840
do you believe in the government
should intervene then?

834
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:55,970
Yeah.

835
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,161
Well,

836
00:25:56,161 --> 00:25:56,994
first of all,

837
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,740
there are market regulations,

838
00:25:58,741 --> 00:25:58,921
right?

839
00:25:58,921 --> 00:26:03,921
Markets in many cases regulate themselves
because of the self interests of the

840
00:26:04,081 --> 00:26:04,441
party.

841
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:05,191
So for example,

842
00:26:05,191 --> 00:26:06,660
when I talk about banks,

843
00:26:06,661 --> 00:26:06,901
right?

844
00:26:06,901 --> 00:26:08,070
If there was no government,

845
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,500
I'm guaranteeing the safety of bank
accounts in order for banks to thrive and

846
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,640
get customers,

847
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:16,140
they are going to have to,

848
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:16,760
you know,

849
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,450
provide a safe platform,

850
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,850
a depository of their,

851
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:24,390
of their savings and banks will compete
with each other based on who's got the

852
00:26:24,391 --> 00:26:25,230
safest bank.

853
00:26:25,231 --> 00:26:25,821
Whereas you know,

854
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,620
where's my money going to be secure
because that's really what you're worried

855
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:29,250
about.

856
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,860
And so there is market based regulation.

857
00:26:31,861 --> 00:26:35,070
We're from competition and you get
that every place may people say,

858
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:35,251
well,

859
00:26:35,251 --> 00:26:35,610
you know,

860
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:38,820
don't we need the government to make
sure that the airlines are safe?

861
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:39,240
Well,

862
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,020
who's got a vested interest in
a safe airline than the owner?

863
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,591
That airline,

864
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,870
I mean the last thing a,

865
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,560
an airline wants is a crash.

866
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,970
And the most important thing,

867
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,391
you know,

868
00:26:48,391 --> 00:26:49,111
I fly a lot.

869
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:51,660
The most important thing to
me is that it's a safe flight.

870
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,351
And so,

871
00:26:52,351 --> 00:26:52,740
you know,

872
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,210
I'm not going to go on a plane on an,

873
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,380
on an airline that,

874
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:55,970
you know,

875
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:58,050
they cut corners to
save a couple of bucks.

876
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:01,080
So there's gonna be a lot
of regulation in the market.

877
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:01,831
Unfortunately,

878
00:27:01,831 --> 00:27:06,690
what happens is the government comes in
and now they create a moral hazard that

879
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:11,340
undermines the normal market regulation
and replaces it with a government

880
00:27:11,341 --> 00:27:14,640
regulation that's nowhere
near as good moral hazard.

881
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,391
Yeah.

882
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:15,541
Well,

883
00:27:15,541 --> 00:27:16,440
moral hazard.

884
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:16,950
Well,

885
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,720
in the bank account,

886
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,290
again in the bank account example,

887
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,620
without government interference,

888
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,890
I care about what the
banks do with my money.

889
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,260
I'm not just gonna Dump
my money in the bank,

890
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:28,640
uh,

891
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,520
and not worry about it.

892
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,950
I'm going to do some research
before my bank account.

893
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,140
I want to make sure
that the bank is sound.

894
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,830
The bank knows that in
order to attract customers,

895
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,150
it has to be safe.

896
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:41,580
It can't just be gambling
with depositors money.

897
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,690
Um,

898
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,460
but when the government steps in,

899
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,920
now no one cares about safety
because the government says,

900
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:47,581
don't worry,

901
00:27:47,581 --> 00:27:49,020
we'll make sure the bank is safe.

902
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,740
So now the,

903
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,540
now the depositors say
we don't give a damn.

904
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,710
We'll put our money anywhere.

905
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,540
I don't care which bank it is.

906
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,950
Nobody does any research.

907
00:27:55,951 --> 00:27:56,161
I mean,

908
00:27:56,161 --> 00:28:00,240
people do more research before they buy
a microwave oven or a television set.

909
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,580
Then depositing their
life savings into a bank.

910
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:03,960
It's just whichever one is closest,

911
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:04,140
that's,

912
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,650
you know,

913
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:05,700
I'm going to put my money there.

914
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,900
The banks know this.

915
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,680
Now,

916
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,350
the only thing that banks have to do is
convince the regulators to give them a

917
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:10,800
pass.

918
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,440
But then you got all kinds of
corruption you've got and you've got the

919
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,630
government has all kinds
of corrupt incentives.

920
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,150
So market based regulation is much better.

921
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:23,100
But certainly I do believe in some
types of regulation when it comes to

922
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,650
externalities like pollution
and things like that.

923
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,590
But a lot of that is best
done at a local level,

924
00:28:28,591 --> 00:28:29,610
not at the federal level.

925
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,180
And a lot of it is done through courts
because people are still liable in a free

926
00:28:33,181 --> 00:28:33,631
market.

927
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:36,210
So if I damage you in some way,

928
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,840
uh,

929
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,531
then you know,

930
00:28:37,531 --> 00:28:40,860
I'm responsible for your
damage and you consume me.

931
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,230
And so businesses don't want to be sued.

932
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:43,891
They don't want to,

933
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:44,450
you know,

934
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:44,721
uh,

935
00:28:44,721 --> 00:28:44,940
you know,

936
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,731
harm other people.

937
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:47,100
And so they're going
to guard against that.

938
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:52,230
I think if you look at all of
the money that society loses,

939
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,830
you know when you buy government debt
protection and government regulation,

940
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,500
more money is lost to
the cost of regulation.

941
00:28:58,590 --> 00:28:58,831
Right.

942
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:03,831
Then would be lost through fraud
or unscrupulous actors that,

943
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:04,830
you know,

944
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,170
that might steal somebody's money.

945
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:07,841
Well yeah,

946
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:10,630
but that money's not coming
directly from victims.

947
00:29:10,631 --> 00:29:11,920
The idea being that,

948
00:29:11,921 --> 00:29:12,290
you know,

949
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:12,610
if,

950
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:14,680
if you're spending all
this money on regulation,

951
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:15,071
that,

952
00:29:15,071 --> 00:29:16,390
that money is not coming,

953
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,253
but you know,

954
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,800
the amount of money that you would lose
if they weren't regulated with directly

955
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:21,170
affected.

956
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:21,321
Well,

957
00:29:21,321 --> 00:29:23,060
it comes from every but
like look at my industry,

958
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:23,320
my,

959
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:23,540
my.

960
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,270
I mainly make my money in
the investment business.

961
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:31,250
I have a brokerage firm and an asset
advisor company and so I advise people on

962
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:32,360
how to invest their money.

963
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,510
Now I have to spend a ton of money,

964
00:29:35,511 --> 00:29:38,090
a fortune complying with regulation.

965
00:29:38,091 --> 00:29:39,480
There's so much regulation in,

966
00:29:39,481 --> 00:29:42,070
in my industry and it costs me.

967
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:42,521
I mean it's,

968
00:29:42,521 --> 00:29:42,821
you know,

969
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:43,311
it,

970
00:29:43,311 --> 00:29:43,510
it.

971
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:45,760
I don't know exactly what it is
over a million dollars a year.

972
00:29:45,761 --> 00:29:50,290
Much more that I have to spend a to
stay in business and of course I have to

973
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,730
pass on those costs to my
clients and of course be cost.

974
00:29:53,731 --> 00:29:54,970
The costs are so big.

975
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,560
There's not a lot of comp,

976
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:56,930
you know,

977
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,170
there's,

978
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,400
there's less competition than there would
be if the government didn't create all

979
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:03,340
these barriers to entry because
if you want to compete with me,

980
00:30:03,610 --> 00:30:04,660
you just can't do it.

981
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,580
You've got to have enough money to set
up the compliance apparatus that the

982
00:30:09,581 --> 00:30:10,450
government requires,

983
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:13,240
so there's a lot less
competition in my industry.

984
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,530
And so I think that investors
suffer because they don't
have as much choices and

985
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:21,580
everybody has to pay higher prices for
their services because the government

986
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:25,090
requires us to spend all this money
supposedly to protect my customers,

987
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:27,580
but the government doesn't really
give a damn about my customers.

988
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:28,360
I do.

989
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,870
I'm the one that suffers if my customers
are mad at me because they take their

990
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,010
business someplace else,

991
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:33,221
right?

992
00:30:33,221 --> 00:30:33,460
I,

993
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,660
I need happy customers,

994
00:30:34,661 --> 00:30:38,260
so I am going to do what's right for
my customers regardless of what the

995
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:38,980
government says.

996
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,250
Now there are some people out
there that are gonna steal.

997
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:42,740
There are,

998
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,620
there's going to be
criminals in every industry.

999
00:30:44,621 --> 00:30:46,580
There's going to be some guy that's gonna,

1000
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,310
you know,

1001
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:48,550
fraudulent the pedal,

1002
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:48,940
you know,

1003
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,800
penny stocks or something
that's going to happen,

1004
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:54,520
but the problem is that's happening
now even with all the government.

1005
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,450
Look at Bernie madoff.

1006
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:58,510
I mean you have all this
stuff going on on top of it,

1007
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:00,880
but if we didn't have
any of this regulation,

1008
00:31:00,881 --> 00:31:02,050
if we have a free market,

1009
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:02,531
yes,

1010
00:31:02,531 --> 00:31:05,440
there will still be some
fools that would lose money,

1011
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,453
but you know,

1012
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,720
the losses would pale in comparison to
how much everybody is losing now because

1013
00:31:10,721 --> 00:31:13,570
of the cost of government and at
least the people who lose money.

1014
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,780
We'd have to accept responsibility
for their own bad decisions.

1015
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,450
Why do my clients have to
spend all this extra money?

1016
00:31:19,451 --> 00:31:22,180
Because somebody else is foolish with
their money because now if you're

1017
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,014
responsible,

1018
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,010
you get punished.

1019
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,251
Well,

1020
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:27,850
this rant started when I was
asking you about the BP spill,

1021
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,590
the the idea that the government should
possibly regularly that you don't.

1022
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,770
You feel that the market should regulate
in situations like that where they

1023
00:31:35,771 --> 00:31:39,540
should be responsible and be sued and
that the government shouldn't step in and

1024
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,490
force it because it seems like when
you're dealing with something like bp,

1025
00:31:42,491 --> 00:31:46,840
you've got this massive corporation
that has untold billions of dollars that

1026
00:31:46,841 --> 00:31:51,841
they can funnel and move and adjust and
spend two to combat anything that would

1027
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,910
cost them money.

1028
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:55,341
But you know,

1029
00:31:55,341 --> 00:32:00,341
one of the ironies of the whole situation
is why are we drilling in such deep

1030
00:32:00,591 --> 00:32:01,610
water in the first place?

1031
00:32:01,611 --> 00:32:06,140
And it has to do with government
environmental regulation that made it very

1032
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:08,420
expensive to drill in shallower water.

1033
00:32:08,421 --> 00:32:09,210
That would be,

1034
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:09,720
you know,

1035
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,010
you know,

1036
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,450
less of an environmental threat.

1037
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,560
It would be a lot easier.

1038
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,730
But the government,

1039
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:13,910
you know,

1040
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,530
with all that regulation actually
helped bring that situation about.

1041
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,750
And also with

1042
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:21,750
cut costs on the,

1043
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,290
the way the well was construct.

1044
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:24,940
But I also also,

1045
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:29,110
what happened is the government came
in and the government cap liability,

1046
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,190
which was a mistake.

1047
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:31,720
The government basically told,

1048
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:32,490
um,

1049
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,740
companies that your liability
is capped at a certain amount.

1050
00:32:35,741 --> 00:32:36,730
And that was the government,

1051
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:37,570
not the free market.

1052
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,720
And so because there was a liability cap
imposed by government corporations were

1053
00:32:41,721 --> 00:32:42,470
riskier,

1054
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:43,340
so they would've been.

1055
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:44,960
And then of course then bp said,

1056
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:45,231
okay,

1057
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:45,420
we're,

1058
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:45,830
you know,

1059
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,300
we're going to pay even beyond the,

1060
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,350
beyond these camps,

1061
00:32:48,351 --> 00:32:53,351
but a lot of this was a byproduct of
other government regulation and moral

1062
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:54,930
hazard that resulted in,

1063
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:55,710
in,

1064
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:55,981
in,

1065
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:56,541
in drilling,

1066
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,880
in deep water when we should've
been drilling in shallower water,

1067
00:32:58,881 --> 00:32:59,900
we should be developing,

1068
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,441
you know,

1069
00:33:00,441 --> 00:33:02,420
what if we were developing
more up in Alaska,

1070
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:02,841
but you know,

1071
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:03,980
the government will let you do that.

1072
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,570
And so the people of Alaska
don't want it either.

1073
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,100
No,

1074
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,610
actually unchecked wilderness.

1075
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,710
So I think that people of Alaska do.

1076
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,010
No,

1077
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:11,620
I think it's.

1078
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:14,940
I think I talked about all
the time I've been to Alaska.

1079
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:18,960
You when you'd talk to the average person
in Alaska about drilling and there's

1080
00:33:18,961 --> 00:33:21,090
some people there that want
jobs that might say yes,

1081
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:23,700
but most people don't have
a vested interest in that.

1082
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,210
They don't want any drilling up there.

1083
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,580
And that place alone,

1084
00:33:26,581 --> 00:33:27,414
it's beautiful.

1085
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:27,810
Well,

1086
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,440
I mean it's also pretty big but not big,

1087
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:33,570
but they don't want to fuck any of it
up because if you start fucking up one

1088
00:33:33,571 --> 00:33:33,961
part,

1089
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,190
why not fuck up other parts?

1090
00:33:35,191 --> 00:33:37,770
Why not before you know you're going to
look out and you can see mountains with

1091
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:38,381
oil wells,

1092
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:39,890
so you're gonna see a lot of nonsense.

1093
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:41,220
You're to see poisoning of the water.

1094
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,060
You're going to see all that.

1095
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,170
It's the last frontier.

1096
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:43,850
There's,

1097
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:44,061
I,

1098
00:33:44,061 --> 00:33:48,510
I see what you're saying when it comes
to this idea of a government regulation

1099
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:49,171
and BP,

1100
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:52,650
but I don't see them spending money to,

1101
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,010
to,

1102
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:53,843
to fix it.

1103
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,120
No,

1104
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,280
no,

1105
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,010
that's good.

1106
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:55,730
You know how much,

1107
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:55,911
you know,

1108
00:33:55,911 --> 00:33:57,850
how much money bp last,

1109
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:58,400
uh,

1110
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,380
you just see what happened
to the value of their shares,

1111
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:03,770
how much money they've had to
spend a in litigation and claims

1112
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:04,740
not enough,

1113
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:07,950
but I don't know if they've done an
unbelievable job fucking up the ocean.

1114
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,230
They've killed massive
amounts of wildlife.

1115
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,350
I mean they should give everything
they have ever made ever.

1116
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:14,131
And then some,

1117
00:34:14,131 --> 00:34:19,110
but then they're not done is
an unbelievable disservice
to the planet itself.

1118
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:19,291
Well,

1119
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:19,531
you know,

1120
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:21,330
a lot of people want to vilify.

1121
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:21,661
Okay.

1122
00:34:21,661 --> 00:34:22,890
The big bad oil companies,

1123
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,180
big oil companies,

1124
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:24,750
they,

1125
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,650
they cut corners and that's why
it happened in the first place.

1126
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,191
But okay,

1127
00:34:29,191 --> 00:34:30,930
so let's say we didn't
have any oil companies.

1128
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,890
I guess they're bad,

1129
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,161
right?

1130
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:35,190
So let's not say that that's a
general blanket generalization,

1131
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,930
but let's say we have an oil company
that's like bp that cuts corners precisely

1132
00:34:39,931 --> 00:34:41,490
to save money and in doing so,

1133
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:42,840
they cause a massive,

1134
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,140
massive environmental damage that I
believe personally you can't put a dollar

1135
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:46,800
value on.

1136
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,750
What they've done is enormous.

1137
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:50,640
They've ruined a part of the earth.

1138
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:50,850
Yeah,

1139
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,870
but they obviously didn't
do it intentionally.

1140
00:34:52,910 --> 00:34:55,890
So if you look at the data and you
know what they didn't do intentionally,

1141
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,680
they made money and in doing that
intentionally and making money,

1142
00:34:58,681 --> 00:35:02,640
they made sure that they made as much
money as possible in the shortest amount

1143
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:03,474
of time as possible,

1144
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:05,880
which led them to cut corners
in the construction of the well,

1145
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,820
which makes them ultimately
responsible 100 percent for the damage.

1146
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,280
And the damage is bad.

1147
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,840
What they don't deserve.

1148
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,900
What if we.

1149
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,480
What if we

1150
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,250
punished bp to the point,

1151
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,420
let's say we destroy them,

1152
00:35:16,421 --> 00:35:17,260
we wiped him out,

1153
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,670
wiped out their shareholders.

1154
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:22,000
The company is bankrupt and they're no
longer in the oil drilling business.

1155
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,133
In addition,

1156
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,490
we,

1157
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:23,750
we,

1158
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,700
we increased the risks so much
that nobody wants to listen.

1159
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,780
We give them a new job.

1160
00:35:27,781 --> 00:35:29,100
The new job is clean the ocean.

1161
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,113
That's my new job.

1162
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,171
New Industry.

1163
00:35:31,171 --> 00:35:32,004
Meanwhile,

1164
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:32,630
how?

1165
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,140
I mean I'm in southern California,

1166
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,640
right?

1167
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,300
If,

1168
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:35,570
if,

1169
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:36,870
if we put the oil companies out of,

1170
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,060
we're not completing them all

1171
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,221
at it,

1172
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:39,054
but believe me,

1173
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,410
there's,

1174
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,590
there's several oil companies,

1175
00:35:40,591 --> 00:35:42,000
but no one is responsible,

1176
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:42,811
but something horrible.

1177
00:35:42,811 --> 00:35:47,640
What if bp went away and if we
raise the risks of drilling for oil,

1178
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:48,500
if we told companies,

1179
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:48,960
look,

1180
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,201
you know,

1181
00:35:49,201 --> 00:35:51,200
you screw up and you're gone,

1182
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:51,450
right?

1183
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,500
You're totally wiped out.

1184
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:56,760
And so now insurance and liability
insurance goes up and let's say so now

1185
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:57,930
gasoline has to be,

1186
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,231
I don't know,

1187
00:35:58,231 --> 00:35:59,160
$20 a gallon,

1188
00:35:59,161 --> 00:35:59,820
$3 account.

1189
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,331
Wait a minute,

1190
00:36:00,331 --> 00:36:01,150
wait a minute.

1191
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,380
No,

1192
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:01,580
no,

1193
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:01,810
no,

1194
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:02,240
no.

1195
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:02,580
One.

1196
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,110
One company going down is not going to.

1197
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:04,171
No,

1198
00:36:04,171 --> 00:36:04,261
no,

1199
00:36:04,261 --> 00:36:04,400
no.

1200
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,310
It's not $20.

1201
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,110
It's not one company I'm talking about.

1202
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,440
You're raising the cost
throughout the entire.

1203
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,660
You're going to have less
people exploring for oil,

1204
00:36:12,661 --> 00:36:13,480
less people,

1205
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,131
less money going,

1206
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:14,250
you know.

1207
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:14,551
In fact,

1208
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:15,330
right now,

1209
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,740
if you look at some of the oil companies,

1210
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,620
they're barely even making
money at a $100 oil.

1211
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:19,811
I mean,

1212
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:20,190
I,

1213
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,160
I got bad news from and oil prices
are going a lot higher anyway.

1214
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,540
They're already going a lot higher.

1215
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,200
So people in southern California have
got to get ready for $10 a gallon.

1216
00:36:28,201 --> 00:36:31,170
Gasoline or hire someone
listened to this conversation,

1217
00:36:31,171 --> 00:36:32,370
listen to you saying this and say,

1218
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:32,521
well,

1219
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,354
this guy does.

1220
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,950
He thinks that banks should fail,

1221
00:36:34,951 --> 00:36:36,090
but oil companies shouldn't.

1222
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:36,281
No,

1223
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:36,810
no.

1224
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:38,130
I think the free market should,

1225
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:38,550
should,

1226
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,590
should be allowed to,

1227
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:39,840
uh,

1228
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,673
to operate.

1229
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,513
And so,

1230
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:42,050
and,

1231
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:45,540
and how do you assess liability
and something like bp because bp,

1232
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:48,930
I think that there's not enough money in
the world will make up for what they've

1233
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:49,460
done.

1234
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,650
Look,

1235
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:50,483
oh well,

1236
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,700
a lot of people that are
filing claims against BP,

1237
00:36:53,701 --> 00:36:54,181
they don't have it.

1238
00:36:54,181 --> 00:36:54,750
They didn't even ask.

1239
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,730
They just all kinds of false or fraudulent
claims are coming in by the damage.

1240
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:00,570
I'm sure there was a few,

1241
00:37:00,571 --> 00:37:02,520
but there's maybe a few of those,

1242
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:03,270
but you can't.

1243
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:06,120
You can't doubt that there a
lot of people affected by that.

1244
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,050
The fisherman,

1245
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,040
but people that work there,

1246
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,190
but how about the actual
impact on the earth itself,

1247
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,670
but shouldn't they be
responsible for that?

1248
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,650
They are responsible,

1249
00:37:13,651 --> 00:37:17,790
but you can't overlook how are people's
lives improved by the fact that we have

1250
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:21,420
oil by the fact that we can drive cars
around now if you want to invent oil and

1251
00:37:21,421 --> 00:37:21,690
BP,

1252
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:22,740
but vent cars,

1253
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,551
they didn't invent it,

1254
00:37:23,551 --> 00:37:26,220
but they're out there
producing the oil well,

1255
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:27,180
but because of that,

1256
00:37:27,181 --> 00:37:30,030
they should be able to do such a
colossal fuck up and then they'll do.

1257
00:37:30,031 --> 00:37:31,980
Business members will
make billions of dollars.

1258
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:35,910
The government shouldn't have
removed the liability restrictions.

1259
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:36,840
That said that,

1260
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,090
how much you can sue if
you have real damages.

1261
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,710
I want real market forces,

1262
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:44,130
so you think that the market forces
would have influenced them to spend more

1263
00:37:44,131 --> 00:37:46,890
money in the construction of the well
not cut corners in order to reach it.

1264
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,611
In fact,

1265
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:49,050
they might not have even
been drilling there.

1266
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:49,441
I mean,

1267
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:50,910
if it was a free market energy,

1268
00:37:50,911 --> 00:37:53,400
but they might've been
trill drilling in areas,

1269
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:53,760
uh,

1270
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,110
that were generally safer,

1271
00:37:55,111 --> 00:37:57,810
but the government will let
people would vote against that.

1272
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,770
If given the opportunity.

1273
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:01,440
Do you want to have a giant oil rig 50,

1274
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,100
you know,

1275
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,900
100 yards off shore
where you could see it.

1276
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,310
Most people are gonna say no.

1277
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,470
Most people going to think
that if there is a mistake,

1278
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:08,610
which there are quite often.

1279
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:08,960
I mean,

1280
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,320
it's not all the time,

1281
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:12,840
but we can think of
several in our lifetimes.

1282
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:17,580
We know about big oil disasters where
Exxon val ds or whether it's this,

1283
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:17,941
this,

1284
00:38:17,941 --> 00:38:18,161
uh,

1285
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,680
this most recent one,

1286
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,000
those happen.

1287
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,740
People don't want that risk.

1288
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:23,580
Yeah.

1289
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,760
But I mean people also don't want
extremely expensive gasoline,

1290
00:38:26,761 --> 00:38:27,800
so there's always a tradeoff.

1291
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:29,640
But the big risks that we face,

1292
00:38:29,641 --> 00:38:29,761
I mean,

1293
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:31,050
you could talk about an oil spill.

1294
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:31,590
I mean,

1295
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:31,861
the,

1296
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:36,090
the economic catastrophe that the
government is in the process of is going

1297
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,260
to have such a profound impact
across this economy that these,

1298
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:40,601
these,

1299
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:41,081
these things,

1300
00:38:41,081 --> 00:38:41,900
while they're bad,

1301
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:42,141
you know,

1302
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:46,210
in our tiny compared to what's
coming compared to the economic,

1303
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:46,640
you know,

1304
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:46,761
you,

1305
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:47,680
this is California,

1306
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:51,250
so we're gonna get a 10 plus on the
Richter scale and the things that we're

1307
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:55,300
talking about really don't even register
can on it at all compared to what we're

1308
00:38:55,301 --> 00:38:57,190
going to go through in the United States.

1309
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:59,200
I cost of government.

1310
00:38:59,201 --> 00:38:59,770
You can look at,

1311
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:00,011
hey,

1312
00:39:00,011 --> 00:39:01,990
we think we want government
to protect us from this,

1313
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,670
but meanwhile you've got this huge,

1314
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:08,671
enormous government that is creating a
massive catastrophe that's coming and,

1315
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:09,360
and,

1316
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,610
and,

1317
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:13,370
and then we were probably going to end
up with a lot more pollution when we're a

1318
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,291
poor nation.

1319
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:15,280
We can't even afford,

1320
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:16,040
uh,

1321
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,270
to,

1322
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,610
to do the things that would
keep the environment clean.

1323
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,850
Or we're going to be chopping wood to
stay warm and there'll be no pollution.

1324
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,830
Will go completely cave man.

1325
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,191
Well,

1326
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:25,180
go with the other way.

1327
00:39:25,181 --> 00:39:27,400
And I trading metals that
we find on the street.

1328
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,551
Well,

1329
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:27,731
look,

1330
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:31,690
you probably initially there'll probably
be some cleaner air here in southern

1331
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:34,330
California and no one
can afford to drive that.

1332
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:34,901
See that?

1333
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:36,760
That's the next crisis.

1334
00:39:36,761 --> 00:39:37,100
That's good.

1335
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,710
Come is going to kill the dollar.

1336
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:40,930
And then prices are gonna go way up.

1337
00:39:40,931 --> 00:39:41,420
And you know,

1338
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:41,590
they,

1339
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:41,771
you know,

1340
00:39:41,771 --> 00:39:42,001
they,

1341
00:39:42,001 --> 00:39:42,341
they made,

1342
00:39:42,341 --> 00:39:42,941
ended up with,

1343
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:43,310
uh,

1344
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:43,600
with,

1345
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:43,871
with,

1346
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:44,200
uh,

1347
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,531
with,

1348
00:39:44,531 --> 00:39:44,830
uh,

1349
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:45,101
you know,

1350
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:45,550
uh,

1351
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,470
shortages because they
might have price controls.

1352
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:50,980
I think there's going to be big power
blackouts because when energy costs really

1353
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:51,640
sore,

1354
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,020
because when the dollar tanks,

1355
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,500
right,

1356
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,210
even though we're producing
a lot of oil in theU ,

1357
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,103
s right now,

1358
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,340
none of it's going to be consumed here.

1359
00:39:57,341 --> 00:40:00,490
It's all going to be shipped over to Asia
because their currencies are going to

1360
00:40:00,491 --> 00:40:01,310
be stronger.

1361
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:01,530
You know,

1362
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,610
you imagine you've got
all these people in China,

1363
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,720
they're working hard,

1364
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,740
they're in factories are producing,

1365
00:40:06,741 --> 00:40:07,574
they're saving,

1366
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,021
uh,

1367
00:40:08,021 --> 00:40:08,441
but they're,

1368
00:40:08,441 --> 00:40:08,661
they're,

1369
00:40:08,661 --> 00:40:12,310
they're sacrificing to prop up our economy
because a lot of the stuff that they

1370
00:40:12,311 --> 00:40:14,200
produce get shipped over here.

1371
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:14,950
Well,

1372
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:16,540
when the dollar collapses,

1373
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:18,760
they're not going to shift stuff
any over over here anymore.

1374
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,330
They're gonna,

1375
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,190
they're gonna make it and then
they're going to take it home.

1376
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:24,580
They're going to consume this stuff and
you have a lot of Chinese now that are

1377
00:40:24,581 --> 00:40:25,960
riding around on bicycles.

1378
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:26,561
Well,

1379
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:26,810
you know,

1380
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,120
when the dollar collapses,

1381
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:29,680
they're not going to
ride bicycles anymore.

1382
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,560
They're going to drive cars and
they're going to use a lot of gasoline.

1383
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,960
Americans are going to be
riding around on bicycles.

1384
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:41,310
I still don't see how that relates to
protecting environments from corporations

1385
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:43,510
that pose massive.

1386
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:43,730
No,

1387
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,290
no.

1388
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:49,030
My point is that the greatest threat
to America is not corporations.

1389
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,013
It's the government.

1390
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:50,780
And,

1391
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:54,430
and you know the interesting thing when
you have a lot of people that are afraid

1392
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:56,950
of corporations and these
big corporations are bad.

1393
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,000
It's like you know,

1394
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,630
well,

1395
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:02,950
but what could a corporation in general
do to you if they can make a product and

1396
00:41:02,951 --> 00:41:04,030
they can hope that you buy it,

1397
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:09,060
but it's your decision you choose and
the way a corporation or which is just a

1398
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,121
business,

1399
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:10,331
right?

1400
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:12,670
It's just the ownership
structure is a corporation.

1401
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:15,220
And the corporation run by
people just like everybody else.

1402
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,920
But if a corporation wants
you to buy their product,

1403
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,240
they have to give you a good deal.

1404
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,250
They got to give you a better
price than somebody else.

1405
00:41:21,251 --> 00:41:22,660
They got to give you a higher quality.

1406
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:26,890
They have to win your business and you
only buy their products or consume their

1407
00:41:26,891 --> 00:41:27,724
services if,

1408
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,020
if,

1409
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,860
if it's to your advantage to do so.

1410
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,840
So it's all voluntary cooperation,

1411
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,250
both sides benefit or nobody would trade.

1412
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,030
So.

1413
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,350
But if you look at government,

1414
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,250
it's very different.

1415
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:37,920
It's not,

1416
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,860
we don't have a voluntary
relationship with the government.

1417
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:40,820
The government is forced.

1418
00:41:40,821 --> 00:41:43,760
The government says you have to do
this or we're putting you in jail.

1419
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,210
You have,

1420
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,470
I'm going to force you to do this.

1421
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:45,770
Um,

1422
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,100
I'm gonna.

1423
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,540
I'm gonna require you to do that.

1424
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,800
You have to pay this tax.

1425
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:49,634
And if you don't do it,

1426
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:50,510
we put you in jail.

1427
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,340
So government has real power.

1428
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,690
Corporations have no power.

1429
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,770
The government has all the power.

1430
00:41:54,771 --> 00:41:56,300
So we should fear government

1431
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,410
have money though.

1432
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,290
If corporates and save money
and there is a government,

1433
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:03,090
the corporations can
influence the government.

1434
00:42:03,091 --> 00:42:04,140
It's always been the case.

1435
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,870
It always will.

1436
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,280
It hasn't always been the case,

1437
00:42:06,281 --> 00:42:06,881
but you're right,

1438
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:11,710
to the extent that if we
allow corporations to buy
government influence that

1439
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,490
corporations shouldn't be able to donate
to political parties about might be a

1440
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,860
potluck,

1441
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,940
good reform because let individuals do it,

1442
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:19,780
but you know,

1443
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,980
but if we allow corporations right,

1444
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,900
to,

1445
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,170
uh,

1446
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,760
to buy influence,

1447
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:25,421
then that,

1448
00:42:25,421 --> 00:42:26,111
that's bad.

1449
00:42:26,111 --> 00:42:28,300
But the problem isn't that the
corporations are buying it.

1450
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,850
The problem is that we allow
the government to sell it
or to peddle associated.

1451
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,510
If we were to go back to the constitution,

1452
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,190
yeah,

1453
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,500
but if we forced the
government to obey the law,

1454
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,240
then there is no influence to sell.

1455
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:40,890
If,

1456
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,910
if all we get from government is freedom,

1457
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,510
right?

1458
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,111
And Liberty,

1459
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:46,660
which means we have laws that
protect private property,

1460
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:49,570
but we don't create special
privileges for some people,

1461
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,100
then there's no power to lobby,

1462
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:51,934
to lobby for.

1463
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,050
But right now we allow our politicians
to sell power to the highest bidder.

1464
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,850
That's not the Ford of the bitters.

1465
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:01,030
The fault of the bitters because if
I'm a business and I don't try to get a

1466
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:02,020
favor from government,

1467
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:04,180
what if my competition gets a favor and,

1468
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:08,140
and then uses government power to squash
me so everybody is forced to bid for

1469
00:43:08,141 --> 00:43:08,830
that power.

1470
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,240
But the problem is government.

1471
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,360
We have to take the power
away from government and
then there's no more lobbying

1472
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,090
because there's nothing to lobby for.

1473
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:15,431
Right?

1474
00:43:15,431 --> 00:43:16,001
But okay.

1475
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:18,670
So how about a situation
where like in the movie,

1476
00:43:18,671 --> 00:43:23,671
inside job we have these
economics professors that
they set these standards and

1477
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:27,580
give advice and then they wind
up getting jobs with banks.

1478
00:43:27,850 --> 00:43:30,130
You clearly need economic advisors though.

1479
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,840
If I do,

1480
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,550
don't the government in my.

1481
00:43:33,551 --> 00:43:36,670
I'm a senator and my background is in
real estate sales or what have you.

1482
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:36,870
Well,

1483
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:38,980
let's say he's a businessman.

1484
00:43:38,981 --> 00:43:41,200
He sells computers and
then he gets into politics.

1485
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:42,121
What?

1486
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:44,760
What do you really know about economics?

1487
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,650
You have to have a degree
in economics to trillium.

1488
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,170
No,

1489
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,850
I think if you have a degree in economics,

1490
00:43:50,851 --> 00:43:52,060
then you've probably lost you.

1491
00:43:52,061 --> 00:43:56,130
You probably know more about economics
before you get your degree then after,

1492
00:43:56,131 --> 00:43:56,491
but you know,

1493
00:43:56,491 --> 00:43:57,840
you say you need economic advisors,

1494
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,810
so we have a council of economic
advisors for the president,

1495
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,810
but that we didn't even have
that before the Second World War.

1496
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,210
There were no economic advisors
advising the president,

1497
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,130
but America became the wealthiest
country the world had ever known.

1498
00:44:11,131 --> 00:44:13,410
I mean America in 1945,

1499
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:13,950
right?

1500
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,050
There is no comparison to America today.

1501
00:44:16,051 --> 00:44:16,500
I mean,

1502
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,333
it was.

1503
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:17,970
It was.

1504
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,140
It was a completely different planet.

1505
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:19,410
I mean,

1506
00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:22,290
being American was something totally
different than what it means now.

1507
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:25,860
There was no other country where the
standard of living was even anywhere close

1508
00:44:25,861 --> 00:44:26,694
to what we enjoyed,

1509
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:27,840
but we built that.

1510
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,910
We built the wealthiest,

1511
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,930
this wealthiest society in
the history of the world,

1512
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,040
way wealthier than

1513
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,030
we are today in,

1514
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:33,310
you know,

1515
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:34,290
in relative terms,

1516
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,780
without any economic advisors and all.

1517
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:37,320
I mean,

1518
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,520
we should fire everybody in Washington
who was economic advisor and the title

1519
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:43,110
that we don't need an economic advisors.

1520
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,210
The best economy is a free economy.

1521
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:46,710
It doesn't need micromanaged,

1522
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:47,250
don't you?

1523
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:47,560
If you,

1524
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,150
if you want to be a socialist and you
want to try to micromanage and centrally

1525
00:44:51,151 --> 00:44:52,050
planned the economy,

1526
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:53,250
then you need advisors,

1527
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,780
but if you believe in capitalism,

1528
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,070
there is no advice,

1529
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:59,490
just let the market function and then
you're going to have the most efficient

1530
00:44:59,491 --> 00:44:59,851
outcome.

1531
00:44:59,851 --> 00:45:03,150
You're going to have the most efficient
allocation of resources you're going to

1532
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:03,280
have.

1533
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,510
The higher standard of living for your
people is when the government comes in

1534
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:11,220
and tries to substitute individual
judgments for the free market.

1535
00:45:11,310 --> 00:45:12,480
That's when you create problems,

1536
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:16,440
but it wasn't the whole situation after
World War II based on the fact that most

1537
00:45:16,441 --> 00:45:18,210
of the planet had been at war.

1538
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:22,650
The economic situation in Europe was
terrible because they had massive amounts

1539
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:23,281
of destruction,

1540
00:45:23,281 --> 00:45:24,440
massive loss of lives.

1541
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:24,960
Of course,

1542
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,240
Japan had just surrendered
to the United States.

1543
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,980
China was a communist country.

1544
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,330
There was so much even about the world
and the job to say how great America was

1545
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,770
is to compare it to what?

1546
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,673
No.

1547
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,140
Then go before the war.

1548
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,130
Look at 19,

1549
00:45:38,131 --> 00:45:38,610
20.

1550
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,000
I mean,

1551
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,230
if you look at the rate of economic
growth in the United States in the 19th

1552
00:45:43,231 --> 00:45:43,740
century,

1553
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:47,070
take take the end of the civil war to
the beginning of the first world war,

1554
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,650
so forget about all the destruction.

1555
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:48,871
Europe.

1556
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:49,920
You look at 18,

1557
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,540
65 to 1913.

1558
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,180
You look at the change in wealth.

1559
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:54,970
There was a.

1560
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,250
There was nothing like America.

1561
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:56,581
I mean,

1562
00:45:56,581 --> 00:46:00,870
why do you think all the immigrants
were pouring into America from Europe?

1563
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,690
It wasn't because they wanted to get
on welfare because we had no welfare.

1564
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:04,830
They wanted freedom.

1565
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,840
We had something that
the world didn't have.

1566
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:09,050
You can come to America
and do what you wanted.

1567
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:09,970
There was no income tax.

1568
00:46:09,971 --> 00:46:11,280
There was no social security tax.

1569
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:12,540
You can start a business.

1570
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:13,200
You know,

1571
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,340
there was no labor law.

1572
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:14,851
You can.

1573
00:46:14,851 --> 00:46:15,930
Anybody can get a job.

1574
00:46:15,931 --> 00:46:16,980
Anybody can hire somebody,

1575
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:17,970
but it can fire somebody.

1576
00:46:17,971 --> 00:46:22,020
You didn't have the government looking
over your shoulder and we created massive

1577
00:46:22,021 --> 00:46:22,800
amounts of wealth,

1578
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,760
not just for,

1579
00:46:23,761 --> 00:46:24,020
you know,

1580
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,510
the rockefellers and the
carnegies and you know,

1581
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:27,390
the vanderbilts,

1582
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:31,950
but for average people to
standard of living rose rapidly.

1583
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,500
Poor people from all over
the world came to America,

1584
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:35,240
uh,

1585
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:35,550
you know,

1586
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:35,880
to,

1587
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,181
to,

1588
00:46:36,181 --> 00:46:36,440
uh,

1589
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:36,690
to,

1590
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:39,300
to pursue whatever they couldn't pursue
in their own countries because they

1591
00:46:39,301 --> 00:46:40,120
didn't have the freedom,

1592
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,790
but it was also a new territory.

1593
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:45,750
It was a completely new uncharted land
that had just started to set up cities

1594
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:46,980
within the last hundred years.

1595
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,380
People had heard about all
the jobs that were available.

1596
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:50,430
It was just a new why.

1597
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:51,900
But why were those jobs there?

1598
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,760
It was because we were
free to create them.

1599
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,310
And in their own countries they
didn't have that level of freedom.

1600
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,181
That was it.

1601
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,390
It was capitalism on a
scale that was never before.

1602
00:47:00,391 --> 00:47:01,380
Tried and,

1603
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:01,520
and,

1604
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,910
and this is where it's succeeded.

1605
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:05,650
And we created that level
of wealth without planners,

1606
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:05,940
with,

1607
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,470
without economic advisors,

1608
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,760
without these taxes,

1609
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,020
without these regulations.

1610
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:10,771
And you know,

1611
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:11,760
even though we had,

1612
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,061
you know,

1613
00:47:12,061 --> 00:47:12,721
a lot of very,

1614
00:47:12,721 --> 00:47:13,650
very wealthy people,

1615
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,730
how do they get wealthy?

1616
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:18,870
They got wealthy by satisfying
the demands and the needs of,

1617
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:19,090
of,

1618
00:47:19,090 --> 00:47:21,090
of the masses of average people.

1619
00:47:21,150 --> 00:47:21,860
And you know,

1620
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,150
and,

1621
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:24,000
and everybody got wealthy together today.

1622
00:47:24,001 --> 00:47:24,834
What do we have now?

1623
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,000
How do people get removed now?

1624
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,630
Everybody didn't get wealthy together.

1625
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:31,030
There was a lot of people that were
poor as fuck back then as well as today.

1626
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:31,240
No,

1627
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:31,361
no,

1628
00:47:31,361 --> 00:47:31,520
no,

1629
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:31,780
no.

1630
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:32,740
There's always going to be.

1631
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:32,830
No,

1632
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:32,920
no,

1633
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,250
no.

1634
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,190
There were people that were poor
relative to people who were rich.

1635
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,350
But if you take the typical person in 18,

1636
00:47:38,351 --> 00:47:39,190
65,

1637
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,790
right.

1638
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:40,290
He,

1639
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:40,481
you know,

1640
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:41,470
he lived on a farm.

1641
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:43,930
He typical person to live on a farm.

1642
00:47:43,931 --> 00:47:44,470
We did.

1643
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:48,320
They were both farmers telling them
where people are going to New York to

1644
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:50,261
Boston.

1645
00:47:50,261 --> 00:47:51,070
Oh No.

1646
00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:53,680
There were some people we were in
a percentage of people lived in,

1647
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:54,670
look,

1648
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:55,151
look it up.

1649
00:47:55,151 --> 00:47:55,971
I don't know the exact person,

1650
00:47:55,971 --> 00:47:56,530
but people.

1651
00:47:56,530 --> 00:47:57,940
But even if they lived in New York,

1652
00:47:57,970 --> 00:47:58,210
okay,

1653
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:58,690
okay.

1654
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,010
They didn't have any electricity,

1655
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:00,750
right?

1656
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,090
They,

1657
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:01,290
they,

1658
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:02,470
they didn't have indoor plumbing,

1659
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:03,820
have gangs of New York style,

1660
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:05,530
but they didn't have air conditioning.

1661
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,480
They lived,

1662
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,030
you know,

1663
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:08,470
but by,

1664
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:12,580
by 1913 right now you had a
lot of people living in cities,

1665
00:48:12,581 --> 00:48:13,600
but they had indoor plumbing.

1666
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,620
They had electric lights.

1667
00:48:14,621 --> 00:48:15,580
They had to telephone.

1668
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:16,080
Uh,

1669
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,271
they,

1670
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:16,561
they,

1671
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,110
they had,

1672
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:17,411
uh,

1673
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:17,890
you know,

1674
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:21,520
all kinds of gadgets that
made their lives better.

1675
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,780
That didn't exist.

1676
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:23,140
Uh,

1677
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:23,681
in 18,

1678
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:24,371
65.

1679
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:26,380
I mean everybody's life got better,

1680
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:30,940
but he got a symptom of just
technological innovation and the constant

1681
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:31,840
improvement of,

1682
00:48:31,841 --> 00:48:33,820
of devices and things that
we've always gone through.

1683
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:34,010
No,

1684
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,080
we didn't always go through it.

1685
00:48:35,081 --> 00:48:35,270
I mean,

1686
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:36,610
things have always gone through that.

1687
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,340
If you go back for thousands of years,

1688
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:40,540
we didn't have that kind of progress.

1689
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:40,691
I mean,

1690
00:48:40,691 --> 00:48:41,310
if you will,

1691
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:42,400
because it's exponential,

1692
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:43,090
but if you were,

1693
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,060
but it was the freedom that we
had and that enabled us to do it.

1694
00:48:46,061 --> 00:48:46,211
I mean,

1695
00:48:46,211 --> 00:48:47,230
it wasn't an accident,

1696
00:48:47,231 --> 00:48:50,470
sort of a lot of things
that was created in Europe.

1697
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,480
There was a lot of things
that were created in China.

1698
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,130
They developed over the world.

1699
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,870
If you look at where America was,

1700
00:48:55,871 --> 00:48:56,081
you know,

1701
00:48:56,081 --> 00:48:59,380
going into the first world war and you
look at like all the cars and all the,

1702
00:48:59,381 --> 00:48:59,581
you know,

1703
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:01,720
the 90 percent of everything was here.

1704
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:02,021
I mean,

1705
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:02,950
we made everything.

1706
00:49:02,951 --> 00:49:04,120
We consumed everything.

1707
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,280
We had our standard of
living unparalleled.

1708
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,670
I mean,

1709
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,350
poor people in America were,

1710
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,561
you know,

1711
00:49:08,561 --> 00:49:09,910
were wealthy in other countries.

1712
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:13,720
That's where the whole expression ugly
American came from and somebody in

1713
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:14,890
American would go to Europe,

1714
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:15,641
uh,

1715
00:49:15,641 --> 00:49:18,460
and they were just a school teacher or
a plumber and they got there and they

1716
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:22,210
thought they were king because everything
was so cheap compared to things.

1717
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:23,280
Here we have so much that,

1718
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,340
that people didn't know the term ugly
American came from us being assholes

1719
00:49:27,341 --> 00:49:28,174
because we

1720
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:32,110
didn't want to speak the language.

1721
00:49:32,111 --> 00:49:33,190
We would go over there.

1722
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:33,540
No,

1723
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,510
you speak English.

1724
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,530
We went to France.

1725
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,070
It,

1726
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:39,300
the attitude that we had when we
got there of superiority and how,

1727
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:41,920
which we were and how everybody didn't
have any of the things that we had.

1728
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,360
That was really where it came from.

1729
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,290
Maybe we'll listen to.

1730
00:49:44,291 --> 00:49:46,000
I'm guessing you're guessing as well.

1731
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:47,940
Neither one of us were
in Europe in the fifties,

1732
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:50,200
so we don't really know where
that term actually came up,

1733
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:51,100
but that's how,

1734
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,140
that's how it ordinate require assholes.

1735
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:56,050
I think there's a big percentage of us
that are shitheads and we go to other

1736
00:49:56,051 --> 00:49:56,441
countries.

1737
00:49:56,441 --> 00:49:56,981
I've seen it.

1738
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:59,230
I've seen people that are American,

1739
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,090
they're another countries act stupid,

1740
00:50:01,091 --> 00:50:02,050
but not so much anymore.

1741
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:02,261
I mean,

1742
00:50:02,261 --> 00:50:04,930
we'd go to other countries and now we
have complained about how expensive

1743
00:50:04,931 --> 00:50:05,351
everything is.

1744
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:08,080
We don't brag about how cheap
it is because those days are.

1745
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,000
Those days are gone
and of course you know,

1746
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:13,320
back then all the products were made
in America and we exported all those

1747
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:13,631
products.

1748
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:15,820
I think that because we
had cheap wait labor,

1749
00:50:15,821 --> 00:50:17,170
we had the highest wages in the world.

1750
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,580
There's a lot going on there.

1751
00:50:18,581 --> 00:50:23,581
I certainly think that creativity and
innovation help or it helps it to be free,

1752
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:28,000
to have freedom certainly is gonna
enhance the ability to create and

1753
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,900
an ability to put out new inventions
and new things that are gonna make life

1754
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:33,510
easier.

1755
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:33,720
No,

1756
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:33,930
no,

1757
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:34,280
no,

1758
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,061
no question about it,

1759
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:38,990
but the idea that that has to be all
completely unregulated by the government

1760
00:50:38,991 --> 00:50:42,170
makes me very nervous and I know the
word that I don't trust the government

1761
00:50:42,171 --> 00:50:42,411
either.

1762
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:42,661
I don't know.

1763
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:44,300
I don't like the word the government,

1764
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:49,480
but I think an unregulated industry that
can pollute like bp has is incredibly

1765
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:51,480
dangerous.

1766
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,160
But you've got regulation though.

1767
00:50:53,161 --> 00:50:54,750
I mean the government takes it down.

1768
00:50:54,751 --> 00:50:55,141
Like here,

1769
00:50:55,141 --> 00:50:57,090
if you want to cut hair,

1770
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:58,980
do you want to be a barber?

1771
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,570
You got to get licensed.

1772
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:01,800
You got to take exams,

1773
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:02,340
right?

1774
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,560
I mean why does it.

1775
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:04,940
You don't want some crazy ass hole.

1776
00:51:04,941 --> 00:51:06,240
Doesn't know how to
use a pair of scissors.

1777
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,770
We'll just open up a shop.

1778
00:51:07,771 --> 00:51:09,600
And you're the first guy
who works on pretty much.

1779
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:09,781
Yeah,

1780
00:51:09,781 --> 00:51:09,901
but.

1781
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:10,920
So you get a bad haircut.

1782
00:51:10,921 --> 00:51:11,641
You don't go back.

1783
00:51:11,641 --> 00:51:11,851
I mean,

1784
00:51:11,851 --> 00:51:13,290
what's the worst thing that can happen?

1785
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,650
Okay.

1786
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:14,401
In haircuts.

1787
00:51:14,401 --> 00:51:15,234
Yes.

1788
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:16,680
How about fixing a car?

1789
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:17,520
But even book,

1790
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,440
even the car tire could come,

1791
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:21,480
fly down the highway and die.

1792
00:51:21,810 --> 00:51:21,961
Well,

1793
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:22,450
so you know,

1794
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:23,790
so if there's a mechanic,

1795
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:24,061
right,

1796
00:51:24,061 --> 00:51:24,250
that,

1797
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,590
that get it has a,

1798
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:26,030
you know,

1799
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:28,440
he doesn't know how to put
out a tire and you know,

1800
00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:30,300
a couple of people have an accident.

1801
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,200
He's out of business.

1802
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:32,850
No one's going to go out of business.

1803
00:51:32,851 --> 00:51:33,870
People are going to die.

1804
00:51:33,871 --> 00:51:36,510
I think money is not as important
as making sure this guy,

1805
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:37,760
no set of fixed cars,

1806
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:38,880
but if family say,

1807
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:41,100
but if you invest money in a business,

1808
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:41,610
right,

1809
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,250
the most important thing
you have is your reputation,

1810
00:51:44,251 --> 00:51:44,911
your brand,

1811
00:51:44,911 --> 00:51:45,571
your customer,

1812
00:51:45,571 --> 00:51:46,404
goodwill.

1813
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,080
The business owner is going to make sure,

1814
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:49,740
right?

1815
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:51,060
That he's got,

1816
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:51,510
you know,

1817
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:52,950
mechanics that know what they're doing.

1818
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:53,900
He's going to not,

1819
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,690
they're going to take a chance and
maybe they'll go out of business,

1820
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,690
but they might fuck up.

1821
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:57,990
Look,

1822
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:59,340
people aren't rational.

1823
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,400
You're here idea that everyone who starts
a business is going to know exactly

1824
00:52:02,401 --> 00:52:03,640
what they're doing because they have to.

1825
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:05,550
The ones that don't posture,

1826
00:52:05,551 --> 00:52:07,600
the ones that don't know what
they're doing will go under,

1827
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:07,871
but yeah,

1828
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:08,341
it shouldn't.

1829
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:09,180
You stop that.

1830
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,040
If it's a case of something being safe.

1831
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:11,580
No,

1832
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,610
someone's a doctor.

1833
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:13,770
Dentist.

1834
00:52:13,770 --> 00:52:16,740
If someone's working on your health or
working on your car or working on your

1835
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:17,041
house,

1836
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:17,251
look,

1837
00:52:17,251 --> 00:52:17,791
they put your,

1838
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,850
your pipes in incorrectly and your
fucking house catches on fire.

1839
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,190
You don't think you should have
to be certified by at least,

1840
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,060
but hold on a second,

1841
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,860
but at least some sort of a standard in
their industry or industry agrees upon

1842
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:29,340
standard.

1843
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,400
Why does it have to come from government
doesn't make what they used to have

1844
00:52:32,401 --> 00:52:34,130
before government is it.

1845
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:35,730
You would join a society,

1846
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:35,971
right?

1847
00:52:35,971 --> 00:52:39,690
A voluntary society which would give
you like a good housekeeping seal of

1848
00:52:39,691 --> 00:52:40,410
approval.

1849
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:40,891
So you would say,

1850
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:41,101
Hey,

1851
00:52:41,101 --> 00:52:42,450
I'm a mechanic and look,

1852
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:47,190
I'm a member of this organization and
they come and they periodically examined

1853
00:52:47,191 --> 00:52:49,800
my business and they certified
that I have all the safety.

1854
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:53,940
I mean the free market will find
solutions so that companies can say,

1855
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:54,361
you know,

1856
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:54,661
yes,

1857
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:57,540
like a better business bureau
kind of seal of approval,

1858
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,310
but when the government does it,

1859
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,300
I think it's not nearly as effective and
I think it does create a moral hazard.

1860
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:03,541
People,

1861
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:04,180
you know,

1862
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,420
have a lot of corruption there.

1863
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,330
But even look,

1864
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,163
it goes to everything.

1865
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:09,480
You need licenses to arrange flowers.

1866
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,240
So if you want to get a
job as a floral arranger,

1867
00:53:12,241 --> 00:53:13,320
you got to get a government licensed.

1868
00:53:13,321 --> 00:53:13,620
I mean,

1869
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:15,540
so what if the guy doesn't
arrange the flowers,

1870
00:53:15,541 --> 00:53:15,900
right?

1871
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,800
What's the big deal?

1872
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:17,970
But you know what happens?

1873
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:18,860
You have who,

1874
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:22,860
who suffers from all these occupational
licensing laws and regulations.

1875
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:23,940
It's poor people.

1876
00:53:23,941 --> 00:53:26,580
It's inner city people
that never can get jobs.

1877
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:28,140
They never can improve their skills.

1878
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:31,050
They're permanently locked out
of a profession or an occupation.

1879
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:31,561
Meanwhile,

1880
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:34,800
the consumer has fewer choices
and has to pay higher prices.

1881
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:36,180
We all suffer from this.

1882
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:36,361
You know,

1883
00:53:36,361 --> 00:53:36,871
you can say,

1884
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:37,141
well,

1885
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:37,321
you know,

1886
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:39,930
maybe a few people that
wouldn't have got bad haircuts,

1887
00:53:39,931 --> 00:53:40,380
don't.

1888
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:40,720
Alright,

1889
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:41,551
well let that happen.

1890
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:44,340
I'd rather have that than everybody
have to pay more for a haircut.

1891
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,240
The haircut example,

1892
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:45,541
yes,

1893
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:45,961
I'm with you.

1894
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:46,290
It's not.

1895
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:47,160
It's a frivolous thing.

1896
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:48,270
It's not that big a deal.

1897
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,400
The real issue I have is with things like
construction or things like electrical

1898
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:58,550
things that involves safety and I think
you and I are both not in favor of the

1899
00:53:59,281 --> 00:54:01,650
government regulating these things
because I don't necessarily think they're

1900
00:54:01,651 --> 00:54:02,550
going to do the best job.

1901
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,320
The industry itself should regulate.

1902
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:08,370
If the industry could prove
some sort of a very efficient,

1903
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:11,040
very competent and very
educated regulatory system,

1904
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,690
then the government should
just step down and say,

1905
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:12,930
look,

1906
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,010
we're not going to do this anymore.

1907
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:15,480
We're going to let the hair cutters,

1908
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:16,800
association of America,

1909
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,470
most people,

1910
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,930
most of these organizations
started out in the private sector.

1911
00:54:21,931 --> 00:54:25,410
But the reason they got government
involved is they wanted protection from

1912
00:54:25,411 --> 00:54:26,244
competition.

1913
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:28,440
And so whenever you like
and why and what and how so?

1914
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:28,741
Well,

1915
00:54:28,741 --> 00:54:29,350
because let's,

1916
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,420
let's assume that we're,

1917
00:54:30,421 --> 00:54:30,660
you know,

1918
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,520
we know we were basket weavers,

1919
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:32,821
right?

1920
00:54:32,821 --> 00:54:33,121
And we,

1921
00:54:33,121 --> 00:54:33,271
you know,

1922
00:54:33,271 --> 00:54:34,990
we all weave baskets and be the best way.

1923
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,080
Let's say we have a society where you say,

1924
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:37,291
look,

1925
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:37,561
if you're,

1926
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:38,670
if you pay your dues,

1927
00:54:38,671 --> 00:54:39,050
you know,

1928
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:39,350
we'll,

1929
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,480
we'll give you a certified member
of basket weavers of America.

1930
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:44,640
And if anybody sees
that sign on your shop,

1931
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:46,890
they know that you really
know how to weave a basket.

1932
00:54:46,891 --> 00:54:48,690
You went through our
vigorous training program.

1933
00:54:48,691 --> 00:54:49,501
You took a course,

1934
00:54:49,501 --> 00:54:50,334
you know we have,

1935
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:51,263
but now,

1936
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,680
but once you have this group,

1937
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:53,070
they say,

1938
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:53,820
you know what?

1939
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:58,380
If we could simply require everybody
to be a member of our group and make it

1940
00:54:58,381 --> 00:55:00,330
illegal for them to sell any baskets.

1941
00:55:00,331 --> 00:55:01,620
If they're not a member of our group,

1942
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:05,070
then we can charge a lot more money if
we can because we won't have competition.

1943
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:06,350
So they go to Washington,

1944
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:06,631
they say,

1945
00:55:06,631 --> 00:55:06,781
hey,

1946
00:55:06,781 --> 00:55:10,620
why don't you require anybody who weaves
baskets to join our organization and

1947
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:11,580
forced them into it?

1948
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,270
Right.

1949
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:12,961
That's what I'm in.

1950
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:13,950
In the brokerage industry.

1951
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,300
I'm only allowed to be a stockbroker
because I'm a member of Finra right now.

1952
00:55:18,301 --> 00:55:19,680
I don't want to be a member of Finra.

1953
00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:22,500
I'd rather just be a stockbroker
and not be a member of member,

1954
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,453
but that's it.

1955
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,030
I can't.

1956
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:25,560
It's the government made it illegal,

1957
00:55:25,561 --> 00:55:27,120
so in order for me to be a stockbroker,

1958
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:30,930
I have to be in this organization and I
have to spend millions of dollars a year

1959
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,360
to comply with all these
ridiculous rules and regulations,

1960
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:37,590
but the net effect of it is that there's
a lot fewer brokers than there would be

1961
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:39,410
if we didn't have finra and I.

1962
00:55:39,411 --> 00:55:41,700
I know now if Finra was voluntary,

1963
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,600
if it was private,

1964
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,680
then I could just say,

1965
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:43,861
hey,

1966
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:45,720
I'm a broker and I'm
not a member of Finra.

1967
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,680
So caveat emptor,

1968
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:47,340
you know,

1969
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:47,581
just,

1970
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:47,940
you know,

1971
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,820
I would much rather have
that than have to be,

1972
00:55:50,821 --> 00:55:51,570
but you know,

1973
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,920
all these organizations,

1974
00:55:52,921 --> 00:55:53,880
they always want it.

1975
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,920
They always want the government to,

1976
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:56,490
uh,

1977
00:55:56,490 --> 00:55:57,250
prevent,

1978
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:57,480
you know,

1979
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,780
forced people to join so that they
can charge more money and have less

1980
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:01,420
competition.

1981
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,140
But I think also the idea is that the
government is going to be the one that's

1982
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:04,681
impartial.

1983
00:56:04,681 --> 00:56:07,860
The government's going to be standing
outside looking at this industry having no

1984
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:11,430
vested interest in you profiting
over you or you over you and say,

1985
00:56:11,431 --> 00:56:11,791
Hey,

1986
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:14,790
these are the rules and this is how
we can make this fair and ethical.

1987
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:14,921
No,

1988
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:15,571
the governments,

1989
00:56:15,571 --> 00:56:18,870
the idea that most people have about
the but they do have a vested interest

1990
00:56:18,871 --> 00:56:20,370
because now this organization,

1991
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:21,030
right,

1992
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,980
that got the government to
force everybody to join it.

1993
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:28,350
Now they're going to give donations
to the government to continue to help

1994
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:29,020
support those.

1995
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,970
Stopped for you and I
when we became a week.

1996
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:32,400
But we said that that's not legal anymore,

1997
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:33,460
but we haven't stopped that,

1998
00:56:33,461 --> 00:56:34,360
so it's still going on.

1999
00:56:34,361 --> 00:56:35,050
So that did,

2000
00:56:35,050 --> 00:56:35,530
let's say,

2001
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:36,250
part of the problem,

2002
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,670
if we step in and stop that no one is
allowed to give any more money to the

2003
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:40,031
government.

2004
00:56:40,031 --> 00:56:40,930
No campaigns,

2005
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:41,440
no nothing.

2006
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:41,550
That,

2007
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:42,970
that's actually not even going to stop it.

2008
00:56:42,971 --> 00:56:44,430
What has to stop it is you have to,

2009
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:47,530
you have to take away the government's
power to do all these things because

2010
00:56:47,531 --> 00:56:47,920
they're going to,

2011
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,090
as long as I have the power,

2012
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,571
uh,

2013
00:56:49,571 --> 00:56:50,051
there's going to be.

2014
00:56:50,051 --> 00:56:52,810
People will get around those requirements
and there'll be ways to do it.

2015
00:56:52,811 --> 00:56:55,210
You have to limit the power of government,

2016
00:56:55,211 --> 00:56:58,220
which is what we did so
successfully for our first hundred,

2017
00:56:58,221 --> 00:57:00,070
150 years as a republic.

2018
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,860
We were very successful at
limiting the power of government.

2019
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,330
And that's why we achieved so much.

2020
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,201
The problem is,

2021
00:57:05,201 --> 00:57:05,620
you know,

2022
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:06,940
we lost that advantage.

2023
00:57:06,941 --> 00:57:07,431
The government,

2024
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:07,570
you know,

2025
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,310
was chained up by the constitution.

2026
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:09,880
Uh,

2027
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:10,430
but it's,

2028
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,010
it freed itself from those chains.

2029
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:12,350
And,

2030
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:14,220
and so now it does whatever it wants and,

2031
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:17,680
and we're suffering as a result because
we've lost a lot of freedom and by

2032
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:20,920
losing the freedom we lost all the
opportunity and economic growth that went

2033
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:21,640
along with it.

2034
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:21,791
Yeah,

2035
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:26,350
but someone has got to keep these
corrupt evil fucks that have billions of

2036
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:28,480
dollars from running a
muck at this situation.

2037
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:28,631
Well,

2038
00:57:28,631 --> 00:57:30,040
who's going to run right now?

2039
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,180
Who's going to run a muck?

2040
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,560
Who's going to run a muck?

2041
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:32,890
What?

2042
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:34,330
How did this financial crisis happened?

2043
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,380
And it happened from
people running them out,

2044
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:38,350
but they couldn't have run a
muck at the government wasn't.

2045
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,040
It wasn't guaranteeing their,

2046
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:41,020
their businesses,

2047
00:57:41,021 --> 00:57:41,531
their loans,

2048
00:57:41,531 --> 00:57:42,341
their portfolios,

2049
00:57:42,341 --> 00:57:46,030
but you think that they acted knowing
that they could fail and if they did fail,

2050
00:57:46,031 --> 00:57:46,980
the government bailed them out.

2051
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:47,580
No.

2052
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,370
Or you reacted in Hubris
thinking they wouldn't fail.

2053
00:57:51,430 --> 00:57:52,300
They're going to pull this off.

2054
00:57:52,301 --> 00:57:53,230
They've been pulling this off.

2055
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,840
Do you think all these people knew that
the edge was coming and they just kept

2056
00:57:55,841 --> 00:57:56,310
running?

2057
00:57:56,310 --> 00:57:57,130
Look,

2058
00:57:57,130 --> 00:57:58,870
government with some didn't.

2059
00:57:58,871 --> 00:57:59,890
It was a little bit of both,

2060
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:01,660
but if the government wasn't there,

2061
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,200
right?

2062
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,910
Saying I'll catch you if you fall,

2063
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,560
then you're not going to
get up on that high wire.

2064
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,560
I you're going to be a lot more cautious
with what you're doing or you agree

2065
00:58:08,561 --> 00:58:09,880
that you would be more cautious,

2066
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:13,270
but I think that people are assholes and
I think that people who have a lot of

2067
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:16,270
money and a lot of Hubris and a lot
of ego and it probably on pills,

2068
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,350
they're going to do some wild,

2069
00:58:17,351 --> 00:58:18,100
wacky shit.

2070
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:18,933
No,

2071
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:20,830
they have and they always
will in a free market.

2072
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:21,250
They won't.

2073
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,930
You know it getting
rich and a free market,

2074
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,040
but they will.

2075
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:24,550
They will.

2076
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,500
They may fail in doing so,

2077
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:28,470
but they certainly will know when.

2078
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,030
See people when,

2079
00:58:30,031 --> 00:58:30,330
when you.

2080
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:31,420
When you earn a lot of money,

2081
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:33,100
the most important
thing is not to lose it,

2082
00:58:33,101 --> 00:58:33,281
right?

2083
00:58:33,281 --> 00:58:37,060
You want to protect what you were in and
so people are going to act to preserve

2084
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:37,631
what they have.

2085
00:58:37,631 --> 00:58:39,370
There's fear and greed that that are,

2086
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:39,690
that are,

2087
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:40,451
that are that are there.

2088
00:58:40,451 --> 00:58:40,691
Yes,

2089
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:41,560
people want more,

2090
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,060
but they don't want to
give up what they have.

2091
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:44,710
The government comes in and says,

2092
00:58:44,711 --> 00:58:45,544
don't worry,

2093
00:58:45,610 --> 00:58:47,200
be a take all the risks you want.

2094
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:48,011
We got you covered.

2095
00:58:48,011 --> 00:58:48,844
We've got your back.

2096
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:51,880
That's what was going on in Wall
Street with all this cheap money.

2097
00:58:51,881 --> 00:58:54,970
They make it a lot less expensive for
everybody to lever up and go out and

2098
00:58:54,971 --> 00:58:58,930
borrow and speculate and you know all
this wealth that is being generated for a

2099
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:00,100
small number of people,

2100
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:00,760
you know,

2101
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:05,170
this is not the way it used to be when
you would get rich by helping everybody,

2102
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:09,610
by providing people with a goods
and services and creating jobs.

2103
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:11,680
That's how people got rich 100 years ago.

2104
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:13,120
That's not how they're getting rich now.

2105
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,470
They're,

2106
00:59:13,470 --> 00:59:15,010
they're getting rich off the government.

2107
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:15,940
They're getting rich by.

2108
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,230
They get the money first.

2109
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:17,951
They get the money,

2110
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:18,371
cheapest.

2111
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:21,320
They get to borrow money at practically
nothing and speculate with it.

2112
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,160
They create no

2113
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,840
real wealth for society,

2114
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:24,471
uh,

2115
00:59:24,471 --> 00:59:26,300
but they're getting rich on their own.

2116
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,590
But all of this is phony.

2117
00:59:27,591 --> 00:59:29,750
All this is going to end
in complete disaster,

2118
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,090
but it is not the market's fault.

2119
00:59:32,091 --> 00:59:34,250
It is not capitalism that has done this.

2120
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:35,181
It's the government.

2121
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:36,020
It's the central bank,

2122
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:38,830
I think we both agree on
government intervention,

2123
00:59:38,831 --> 00:59:42,700
but I think where we're disagreeing is
on human nature and I think that people

2124
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,320
are naturally greedy.

2125
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:44,710
They,

2126
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:45,240
they're,

2127
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:49,090
they're naturally likely to do something
illegal and try to get away with it.

2128
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,090
Not sure they are.

2129
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:52,240
If they can profit off of it or you know,

2130
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:55,240
mom neither by why do you
believe somebody else's?

2131
00:59:55,241 --> 00:59:56,650
Because there's murderers in the world,

2132
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:57,311
in the world.

2133
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,770
Look at the crime reports on
the internet or read the news.

2134
00:59:59,771 --> 01:00:00,160
There's,

2135
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:03,970
there's a million things
that go on everyday that
will prove to you that people

2136
01:00:03,971 --> 01:00:05,440
don't abide by the law when they,

2137
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,780
when they don't have to do or they
think they can get away with it.

2138
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:08,011
Yeah.

2139
01:00:08,011 --> 01:00:08,221
Look,

2140
01:00:08,221 --> 01:00:09,660
there are bad people in the world.

2141
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:10,640
I know they're,

2142
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:11,880
I think they're in the minority.

2143
01:00:11,881 --> 01:00:13,620
I think the majority of people are good.

2144
01:00:13,621 --> 01:00:14,850
I think there are bad people.

2145
01:00:14,851 --> 01:00:15,570
Unfortunately,

2146
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,740
a lot of them are in government,

2147
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,251
uh,

2148
01:00:17,251 --> 01:00:17,481
and that,

2149
01:00:17,481 --> 01:00:19,980
and they have a lot of power there
and bad people gravitate to govern.

2150
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,250
Don't you think that that keeps people
from doing some of these bad things?

2151
01:00:23,251 --> 01:00:25,020
Knowing that they're going
to get in big trouble front.

2152
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:25,391
No,

2153
01:00:25,391 --> 01:00:25,580
no,

2154
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:25,761
no.

2155
01:00:25,761 --> 01:00:27,350
I mean most people,

2156
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:27,590
right?

2157
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:29,150
I don't steal because it's wrong.

2158
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:29,960
I don't,

2159
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,150
I don't not steal because
I might go to jail.

2160
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:32,720
Right.

2161
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,050
I just morally know that I'm not going
to take somebody that doesn't belong to

2162
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:36,560
me.

2163
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:36,950
Right.

2164
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:38,950
And most of us are the
same way that it's not,

2165
01:00:38,951 --> 01:00:39,560
it's not that we're,

2166
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:39,950
you know,

2167
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:42,860
and most people and most
people who get rich are good,

2168
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:43,850
hardworking,

2169
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:45,050
honorable people.

2170
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,120
Most the majority.

2171
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,720
Is it even one out of 100 to 100,

2172
01:00:49,721 --> 01:00:51,700
which is one percent of
people that are scumbags.

2173
01:00:51,701 --> 01:00:51,911
I don't know.

2174
01:00:51,911 --> 01:00:54,610
Fuck up and do a lot when
you're dealing with 300 million.

2175
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:54,900
No,

2176
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:56,720
but didn't get a good free market economy.

2177
01:00:56,721 --> 01:00:58,670
The scumbags are only gonna go so far,

2178
01:00:58,760 --> 01:00:59,120
right?

2179
01:00:59,120 --> 01:00:59,460
Yeah.

2180
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,890
They're going to ultimately get,

2181
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:01,760
get weeded out.

2182
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:02,020
Uh,

2183
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:02,410
they're gonna.

2184
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:02,551
They're,

2185
01:01:02,551 --> 01:01:02,800
they're,

2186
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:03,140
you know,

2187
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:03,380
you,

2188
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,480
you don't build a great business,

2189
01:01:05,481 --> 01:01:06,380
lasting business.

2190
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:07,161
Being a scumbag.

2191
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:07,341
I mean,

2192
01:01:07,341 --> 01:01:09,020
you maybe you can
succeed in the short run,

2193
01:01:09,110 --> 01:01:12,170
but eventually you're going to go away
and that's the free market is going to

2194
01:01:12,171 --> 01:01:14,510
purge itself of the bad operators and yes,

2195
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,950
some people are going to get ripped off.

2196
01:01:15,951 --> 01:01:16,940
I mean that's the nature of it.

2197
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,953
But you know,

2198
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:18,771
in a free market,

2199
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:22,190
fewer people will get ripped off then
in the type of government market we have

2200
01:01:22,191 --> 01:01:22,371
now.

2201
01:01:22,371 --> 01:01:23,630
But I am not afraid.

2202
01:01:23,631 --> 01:01:28,631
I'm not worried about a businessman and
entrepreneur because I know that all of

2203
01:01:28,881 --> 01:01:30,140
my associations with him,

2204
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:31,940
absent government or voluntary,

2205
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,840
all he can do is try to offer me a
good deal and I can turn it down.

2206
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,670
But when they go to government and say,

2207
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,650
we're going to force
you to buy this product,

2208
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:39,771
like,

2209
01:01:39,771 --> 01:01:40,610
here were the obamacare.

2210
01:01:40,611 --> 01:01:40,821
Okay,

2211
01:01:40,821 --> 01:01:42,050
you've got to buy insurance.

2212
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:42,441
You know?

2213
01:01:42,441 --> 01:01:42,650
Well,

2214
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:43,090
what I,

2215
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:43,341
what have,

2216
01:01:43,341 --> 01:01:43,851
I don't need it.

2217
01:01:43,851 --> 01:01:44,684
What if I don't like it?

2218
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:44,931
I mean,

2219
01:01:44,931 --> 01:01:45,061
I,

2220
01:01:45,061 --> 01:01:47,930
I want to be able to make a
decision because in a free market,

2221
01:01:47,931 --> 01:01:48,800
if I buy something,

2222
01:01:48,801 --> 01:01:50,390
it's because I thought it was good for me.

2223
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:50,601
Now,

2224
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:51,470
maybe I'm wrong,

2225
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:54,950
but at least I came to a decision that
I thought something was in my interest,

2226
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,710
but now the government says you have to
do something whether you think it's in

2227
01:01:57,711 --> 01:01:58,544
your interest or not,

2228
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:02,660
and that's and that's power and that's
something that people should be afraid

2229
01:02:02,661 --> 01:02:02,751
of.

2230
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,150
When the government can force you to
do things that you don't want to do,

2231
01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:08,870
corporations can't do that unless they
get the government involved to help them

2232
01:02:09,110 --> 01:02:10,940
and that's not the fault
of the corporation.

2233
01:02:10,941 --> 01:02:13,610
It's the fault of the government or the
people that allow the government to have

2234
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:14,444
that power.

2235
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,330
I feel you.

2236
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:17,490
I see what you're saying
and I agree with you.

2237
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:18,061
For the most part.

2238
01:02:18,061 --> 01:02:19,920
I think the only problem that

2239
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,590
I'm having with what you're saying
is the idea that the government would

2240
01:02:22,591 --> 01:02:26,850
regulate environmental protection or
that rather industry or business would

2241
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:29,160
regulate environmental protection.

2242
01:02:29,161 --> 01:02:29,900
I don't think they would.

2243
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,480
I think that if,

2244
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,720
if they were in a situation where they're
making billions of dollars and they

2245
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:36,900
had some sort of a catastrophic oil
spill or chemical spill or some sort of a

2246
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:37,590
disaster,

2247
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:40,200
they would cover it up just like it's
been proven that's been done with

2248
01:02:40,201 --> 01:02:40,741
fracking.

2249
01:02:40,741 --> 01:02:45,090
I mean there's a real issue with fracking
right now in America and if you've

2250
01:02:45,091 --> 01:02:48,060
watched any of the documentaries or read
any of the articles that are written

2251
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:49,200
about people's areas,

2252
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,213
farms,

2253
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:51,150
water supplies,

2254
01:02:51,151 --> 01:02:54,750
destroyed the oxygen level
in the atmosphere changes.

2255
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:55,091
Well,

2256
01:02:55,091 --> 01:02:55,410
you know,

2257
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:56,243
I level,

2258
01:02:56,270 --> 01:03:01,060
I'm involved pretty heavy with fracking
myself because we have a lot of wells

2259
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:02,080
that we own.

2260
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,670
I own myself and my own on
behalf of my favorite cracker.

2261
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:05,411
I guess.

2262
01:03:05,411 --> 01:03:05,621
I mean,

2263
01:03:05,621 --> 01:03:06,490
I'm in North Dakota.

2264
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:09,100
I'm up in the bock and I started
there about three years ago.

2265
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,760
And look,

2266
01:03:10,761 --> 01:03:11,080
I mean,

2267
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:14,020
I mean there's tremendous wealth
that's been created up in,

2268
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:14,380
up in,

2269
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:15,820
up in that region in North Dakota.

2270
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:18,310
And it's one of the bright
spots of the US economy.

2271
01:03:18,311 --> 01:03:18,491
I mean,

2272
01:03:18,491 --> 01:03:20,710
fortunately the energy industry,

2273
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:21,170
uh,

2274
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:21,500
you know,

2275
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:21,810
on,

2276
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:22,030
you know,

2277
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,010
domestically is doing something,

2278
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:24,420
you know,

2279
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:25,780
it's a pocket of strength and,

2280
01:03:25,781 --> 01:03:25,960
and,

2281
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:26,111
and,

2282
01:03:26,111 --> 01:03:26,410
you know,

2283
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:26,951
and you know,

2284
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:28,750
we're an island of strength
and see a weakness.

2285
01:03:28,751 --> 01:03:30,430
I mean most of what's going on is bad,

2286
01:03:30,431 --> 01:03:33,490
but that's one of the things that we
got going and we're going to need to

2287
01:03:33,491 --> 01:03:34,111
develop our,

2288
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:34,491
our,

2289
01:03:34,491 --> 01:03:34,860
our,

2290
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:37,240
our energy resources
even more effectively,

2291
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:40,300
especially once the dollar cloud
are the actual invite since,

2292
01:03:40,301 --> 01:03:40,661
you know,

2293
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:40,901
then,

2294
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:41,090
uh,

2295
01:03:41,090 --> 01:03:44,040
while I'm doing the actual environmental,

2296
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:46,300
you're already environmental
problems with fracking.

2297
01:03:46,510 --> 01:03:46,811
You know,

2298
01:03:46,811 --> 01:03:46,961
I,

2299
01:03:46,961 --> 01:03:48,340
I think it's more,

2300
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,640
I think you have a lot of
people on the left who,

2301
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:51,930
you know,

2302
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:54,190
they're really socialist but
they don't want to come out and,

2303
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:54,610
and just,

2304
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:54,800
you know,

2305
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,960
they were communists or whatever,

2306
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:56,530
but they,

2307
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:57,363
so they want to,

2308
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,120
you know,

2309
01:03:58,120 --> 01:03:58,540
clothes,

2310
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,000
everything in environmentalist language.

2311
01:04:01,001 --> 01:04:01,121
They,

2312
01:04:01,121 --> 01:04:03,910
what they really want to
take away private property.

2313
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:04,450
Uh,

2314
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:04,820
but they,

2315
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,160
they don't want to come out and say it.

2316
01:04:06,161 --> 01:04:08,140
So they close themselves.

2317
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,960
Did everybody that doesn't
want frackers to ruin the

2318
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:13,523
drinking water?

2319
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:14,950
They certainly have in many places.

2320
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:15,671
They're not ruining.

2321
01:04:15,671 --> 01:04:16,504
They have water.

2322
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:19,950
Why have these companies that have been
fracking come in and shipped fresh water

2323
01:04:19,951 --> 01:04:23,370
to these people that have
lost their drinking water
where they can fucking light

2324
01:04:23,371 --> 01:04:24,204
it on fire now?

2325
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:24,710
What's,

2326
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:25,261
what's going on?

2327
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:27,240
It's not happening in any
circumstance whatsoever.

2328
01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:27,990
Go,

2329
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,381
go.

2330
01:04:28,381 --> 01:04:29,730
I will go out and you laugh about that.

2331
01:04:29,731 --> 01:04:31,590
That seems like a goal to North Dakota,

2332
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,440
you know?

2333
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:32,741
I mean,

2334
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:33,150
you know,

2335
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:34,510
do I have to go to North
Dakota to get an answer?

2336
01:04:34,670 --> 01:04:34,920
No,

2337
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,080
but it's not this horrible thing.

2338
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:37,320
You know,

2339
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:38,870
I think safe places,

2340
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:42,840
I think they overplay the
what's going on and you know,

2341
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:42,931
the,

2342
01:04:42,931 --> 01:04:43,090
the,

2343
01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:43,923
the same thing.

2344
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:45,560
They've been doing this with,

2345
01:04:45,561 --> 01:04:45,750
you know,

2346
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,471
with various,

2347
01:04:46,471 --> 01:04:46,651
you know,

2348
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:47,880
we got to save this species,

2349
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,700
this subspecies subspecies.

2350
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:50,371
We can't go here.

2351
01:04:50,371 --> 01:04:51,140
We can't get.

2352
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:52,470
But a lot of it did,

2353
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:55,140
did an environmental disaster
happened in the Gulf?

2354
01:04:55,410 --> 01:04:59,070
Did millions and millions of
gallons of oil gets built?

2355
01:04:59,100 --> 01:04:59,300
No.

2356
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,830
I'm not saying please did it.

2357
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:01,170
Yes.

2358
01:05:01,170 --> 01:05:01,381
Yes.

2359
01:05:01,381 --> 01:05:04,800
There was an environmental concern that
that could take place almost anywhere in

2360
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:08,610
the country because the systems that we
have in place are not foolproof and this

2361
01:05:08,611 --> 01:05:09,450
is a new thing

2362
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:10,530
that is not just,

2363
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:13,230
not just is it a new thing,

2364
01:05:13,231 --> 01:05:14,670
but most people are not even aware of it.

2365
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,870
They start getting aware of it.

2366
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,130
They start seeing things like
people's water being able

2367
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:19,000
to be lit on fire.

2368
01:05:19,001 --> 01:05:21,910
They start talking to people that have
been forced out of their farms because

2369
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:23,680
they're groundwater's polluted.

2370
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:24,523
They're there,

2371
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,080
they can smell it in the air.

2372
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:29,410
This is some sick shit and now
they're ruining parts of the country.

2373
01:05:29,411 --> 01:05:30,180
But the,

2374
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:34,480
the accident with bp and it wasn't just
bp was there's other companies involved.

2375
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:35,350
Um,

2376
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:38,890
but the accident there happened with
all the regulation that we have.

2377
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,031
But it did happen.

2378
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:40,330
Right?

2379
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:40,481
Right.

2380
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:43,870
But we have regulation but
the regulation preventatively,

2381
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:45,080
but I'm saying more regularly,

2382
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,570
I'm not saying more regulation,

2383
01:05:46,571 --> 01:05:49,540
I'm saying should you do it at all just
because the fact that you can do it and

2384
01:05:49,541 --> 01:05:53,500
maybe make wealth out of it if you are
causing massive environmental disaster.

2385
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:53,740
No.

2386
01:05:53,740 --> 01:05:55,810
Should that be okay just
because you're making money,

2387
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:56,831
as I said,

2388
01:05:56,831 --> 01:05:58,330
if you want to have a tradeoff,

2389
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:59,800
if you want to say no,

2390
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:01,210
drilling offshore,

2391
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:01,960
right,

2392
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,880
because something bad might happen.

2393
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:05,800
If you want to eliminate all that water,

2394
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:06,520
that oil,

2395
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,020
then be prepared to pay a lot more for
gasoline and a lot and a lot more for

2396
01:06:11,021 --> 01:06:13,690
products that we consume
that not only have gasoline,

2397
01:06:13,691 --> 01:06:14,650
but by the way right now,

2398
01:06:14,651 --> 01:06:15,820
and of course this is going to change,

2399
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,940
but most of the stuff that we
consume in America isn't made here.

2400
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,590
It has to get shipped here on a,

2401
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:20,861
on a,

2402
01:06:20,861 --> 01:06:24,450
on a big ship that comes across from
China and it takes a lot of gasoline and

2403
01:06:24,451 --> 01:06:25,150
get it over here.

2404
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:27,490
So every single thing
that we buy in America,

2405
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:28,413
you know,

2406
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,630
there's a lot of energy that
goes into getting it here.

2407
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:35,320
And so if we're going to make energy much
more expensive because we want to make

2408
01:06:35,321 --> 01:06:38,050
sure that we can have another
environmental accident,

2409
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:38,950
right?

2410
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:42,310
Then we better be prepared to accept
the lower standard of living that,

2411
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:43,120
that comes with that.

2412
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:44,410
But you see what you're doing here,

2413
01:06:44,411 --> 01:06:45,340
this problematic.

2414
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:50,430
You are automatically leaning towards the
profit side over the environment side.

2415
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:53,440
This is what makes people really nervous
about people that are really into the

2416
01:06:53,441 --> 01:06:54,190
market.

2417
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:57,550
What your concern is is
not about the earth itself,

2418
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,680
the very place where your
children are grow up.

2419
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,940
That's not what you're concerned about.

2420
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:03,610
You're not concerned about that you were
concerned about the devastation to the

2421
01:07:03,611 --> 01:07:07,600
market by regulating these businesses
and forcing them to raise the price of

2422
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:10,900
gasoline and everyone's going to suffer
because we didn't let everybody take

2423
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:14,870
this fucking wacky chance and pump fluid
into the ground and pull out oil or

2424
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,360
what I'm not saying,

2425
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:18,430
do you see that argument
is a very callous because.

2426
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:23,670
But I'm not saying that a
business shouldn't be held
responsible for the damages

2427
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:25,580
it causes.

2428
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:28,990
I'm not saying just responsible
fracking is fucking dangerous.

2429
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:32,170
Everybody that's fracking isn't,

2430
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:32,381
uh,

2431
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,110
isn't,

2432
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:33,470
you know,

2433
01:07:33,470 --> 01:07:35,650
causing pollution for somebody else.

2434
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:37,840
But a lot of people are well then,

2435
01:07:37,870 --> 01:07:41,110
but then that can be addressed
on a case by case basis.

2436
01:07:41,390 --> 01:07:42,920
Mean those places are poisoned,

2437
01:07:42,980 --> 01:07:43,870
poison those.

2438
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:45,790
Once those farms are ruined,

2439
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:50,080
there's family farms that people can't
have cattle graze in anymore because the

2440
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:50,980
cattle are getting sick.

2441
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,530
They can't grow food there.

2442
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:52,871
The pull,

2443
01:07:52,871 --> 01:07:53,471
the big problem,

2444
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,410
the biggest problems of farmers have
is the government and it's like farm

2445
01:07:56,411 --> 01:07:56,801
program.

2446
01:07:56,801 --> 01:07:57,730
It's not fracking.

2447
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:58,990
If you want to find out what the,

2448
01:07:59,160 --> 01:07:59,993
you know,

2449
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,240
what's going on with our farms.

2450
01:08:01,241 --> 01:08:04,150
I mean go get rid of the Department
of Agriculture will get rid of all

2451
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,500
necessarily government programs.

2452
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:08,710
Government allowed people
the frackers to use.

2453
01:08:08,711 --> 01:08:10,360
They'll all that water and fracking.

2454
01:08:10,361 --> 01:08:12,480
I kick him millions of gallons of water.

2455
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,130
Small farmers come on my radio show
and they tell me about all the problems

2456
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,380
that the government is created for them,

2457
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:18,940
putting them out of business and,

2458
01:08:18,970 --> 01:08:19,150
and,

2459
01:08:19,150 --> 01:08:19,360
and,

2460
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,830
and the things that they're doing
to regulate them out of existence.

2461
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,430
Government is evil,

2462
01:08:23,431 --> 01:08:25,320
but that doesn't have
anything to do with fracking.

2463
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:26,580
The dangers,

2464
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,470
the dangers of fracking are very real.

2465
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:28,930
Well,

2466
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:32,270
I think the dangers are way overblown
and I think that maybe you've,

2467
01:08:32,500 --> 01:08:32,720
you,

2468
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,250
you've read some things and you've got,

2469
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:34,470
you know,

2470
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:38,210
you've seen some of this stuff and I
think it is distorting the reality of

2471
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,223
fracking.

2472
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:40,550
It is not,

2473
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:41,271
uh,

2474
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:41,721
as,

2475
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:45,410
as dangerous as some people
would like everybody to believe.

2476
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:45,720
Right.

2477
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,553
And

2478
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:48,770
more significant to me than the RTU.

2479
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:50,420
If there's an environmental disaster,

2480
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:51,980
I think that's a big concern to me.

2481
01:08:52,220 --> 01:08:53,200
I don't think it's as big as.

2482
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:53,860
So why,

2483
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:54,131
why,

2484
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:56,110
why would it be more of a concern for you?

2485
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:56,411
I mean,

2486
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:56,531
I,

2487
01:08:56,531 --> 01:08:56,880
you know,

2488
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,350
because I'm,

2489
01:08:57,350 --> 01:08:58,250
I'm not invested,

2490
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,760
I don't have invested interest in profit.

2491
01:09:00,030 --> 01:09:02,070
You've already said that you
profited off of fracking,

2492
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,410
but there's nothing wrong with that.

2493
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:06,300
But I would tell you this,

2494
01:09:06,330 --> 01:09:09,900
if we were not producing all that energy
that we're producing now out of North

2495
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:10,260
Dakota,

2496
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:10,890
I mean,

2497
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,730
prices would be much already.

2498
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:12,970
Well,

2499
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:13,090
no,

2500
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:13,260
no,

2501
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:14,660
I'm not saying I'm not saying to sky,

2502
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,380
the sky's going to fall
anyway because we got,

2503
01:09:16,381 --> 01:09:18,450
we got bigger problems than fracking,

2504
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:19,000
but you know,

2505
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,770
the fact that we have been
able to generate more energy,

2506
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:23,670
you know,

2507
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:25,020
that's something that we've done.

2508
01:09:25,021 --> 01:09:27,180
That's been a net positive
that's been helping us.

2509
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,320
If we didn't have that,

2510
01:09:28,321 --> 01:09:29,430
things would be a lot worse.

2511
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:29,541
I mean,

2512
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,380
if you think the economy is bad right now,

2513
01:09:31,530 --> 01:09:35,130
it would be a lot worse if we weren't
generating that for that energy.

2514
01:09:35,131 --> 01:09:37,740
If instead we had to
borrow money to buy that,

2515
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:38,010
you know,

2516
01:09:38,010 --> 01:09:40,170
from Saudi Arabia or
wherever we're importing it,

2517
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:41,280
it would be,

2518
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,390
it would be even worse.

2519
01:09:42,840 --> 01:09:43,531
But you know,

2520
01:09:43,531 --> 01:09:44,730
there's nothing wrong when people.

2521
01:09:44,731 --> 01:09:47,460
A lot of times people have
a bad view of profits,

2522
01:09:47,461 --> 01:09:50,160
I mean prophets or some
kind of evil bad thing.

2523
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:50,420
No,

2524
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:50,630
no,

2525
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:51,860
that's not what we're saying here.

2526
01:09:51,861 --> 01:09:51,980
Well,

2527
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:56,600
we're talking about is environmental
concern over profits and the you have this

2528
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,560
profits over environmental
concern when you keep going,

2529
01:09:59,670 --> 01:09:59,900
oh,

2530
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,880
there's a few little things
might happen here and there,

2531
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,560
but look at how much
money we're gonna save.

2532
01:10:03,561 --> 01:10:04,340
If we do this,

2533
01:10:04,340 --> 01:10:05,720
look at how much money is looking,

2534
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:06,720
how much wealth,

2535
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:06,901
Joe,

2536
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:09,660
if you look around the world and you
look at which countries have the most

2537
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:10,410
pollution,

2538
01:10:10,410 --> 01:10:13,650
generally it's the countries that had the
most government and the countries that

2539
01:10:13,651 --> 01:10:14,850
have less pollution,

2540
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,020
will have less government.

2541
01:10:16,021 --> 01:10:16,231
I mean,

2542
01:10:16,231 --> 01:10:16,660
you know,

2543
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:16,811
a,

2544
01:10:16,811 --> 01:10:17,170
a,

2545
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:21,570
a clean environment is a valuable
asset that the market will preserve.

2546
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:23,310
Am I saying that there should be no.

2547
01:10:23,311 --> 01:10:24,144
Regulation

2548
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:26,700
is ruined.

2549
01:10:26,701 --> 01:10:27,534
It's ruined.

2550
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,300
You're extracting money out of an area by.

2551
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:31,910
Okay.

2552
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:34,280
If you look at that area
is ruined and polluted.

2553
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:36,980
It's where you can look at some
of the areas of Africa where,

2554
01:10:36,981 --> 01:10:37,760
you know,

2555
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,970
where a lot of private money
has come in and tried to create,

2556
01:10:40,971 --> 01:10:41,390
you know,

2557
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:45,500
a wildlife reserves where there's now
instead of hunting elephants now for their

2558
01:10:45,501 --> 01:10:46,190
ivory,

2559
01:10:46,190 --> 01:10:48,140
there's a lot of people
now they're spending money,

2560
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:48,470
uh,

2561
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:49,910
preserving them because people,

2562
01:10:49,970 --> 01:10:50,200
you know,

2563
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:53,500
they want to come in and take a safari
there and they want to see them in there

2564
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:54,260
and habitat.

2565
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:59,090
So you have entrepreneurs seeing a profit
in preserving an environment in a way

2566
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:00,290
that they can profit from it.

2567
01:11:00,291 --> 01:11:01,730
If there wasn't a way to profit from it,

2568
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,740
people wouldn't be explaining
the money to do that.

2569
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:06,890
Actually a really good example because
you know how they really profit off of

2570
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:07,401
elephants.

2571
01:11:07,401 --> 01:11:09,860
One of the big ways allowing
hunters to go over there.

2572
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,980
They have people spending
money to kill these.

2573
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,310
Well that's the idea

2574
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:14,900
of preserving.

2575
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:14,961
No,

2576
01:11:14,961 --> 01:11:15,051
no,

2577
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:15,141
no,

2578
01:11:15,141 --> 01:11:15,241
no.

2579
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:18,330
The people that are trying to preserve
them or trying to stop the poaching.

2580
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:20,050
Poaching.

2581
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,510
We were talking to regulating hunting.

2582
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:21,671
They,

2583
01:11:21,671 --> 01:11:21,841
they,

2584
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:24,750
they have regulated hunting
expeditions for elephants.

2585
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:25,110
Well,

2586
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:25,750
I'd be like,

2587
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:26,000
I,

2588
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:26,221
I,

2589
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:26,521
you know,

2590
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,800
I know there's some big game
hunting and I'm sure that,

2591
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:29,070
you know,

2592
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:30,530
to the extent that there's hunting there,

2593
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:30,880
you know,

2594
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:31,100
I mean,

2595
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:32,430
they're not hunting them to extinction.

2596
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:36,100
I don't know what it costs to
shoot an elephant hunter probably.

2597
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:38,520
Especially if you're going to have the
head mount that had taken back and was

2598
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,140
just to pay to have.

2599
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,370
It's a very expensive but
they have to keep it alive.

2600
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,090
But in order to be there to shoot it,

2601
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:44,940
it has to exist.

2602
01:11:44,941 --> 01:11:45,840
You can't wipe out,

2603
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,000
you can't wipe out the,

2604
01:11:47,001 --> 01:11:47,150
uh,

2605
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:47,560
the,

2606
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:48,210
the herd.

2607
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,490
But could you imagine if that
argument was used for people?

2608
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:53,430
Well then we have to keep the
population healthy by hunting them.

2609
01:11:53,460 --> 01:11:55,650
We have to do it not to shoot a
few people every now and then.

2610
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:56,310
That would be,

2611
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,860
that would be an,

2612
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:57,950
it costs a million dollars.

2613
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:58,561
You'd be on here.

2614
01:11:58,561 --> 01:12:00,330
It's a million dollars
in profit is generated.

2615
01:12:00,331 --> 01:12:01,050
If you shoot a person,

2616
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:04,610
that's how much gas would cost if you
didn't shoot that would take one person,

2617
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:06,840
you shoot them and they got
everybody else healthy and well fed.

2618
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:10,320
We had a hunger games type scenario
where we had to kill a couple of people

2619
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:10,711
every year,

2620
01:12:10,711 --> 01:12:11,910
but everybody else live great.

2621
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:15,420
I think that's got nothing
to do with what I'm good at,

2622
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:18,540
what my argument that you
often offered left field,

2623
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,580
but I'm not even the left guy.

2624
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,041
The,

2625
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:21,310
the,

2626
01:12:21,310 --> 01:12:22,770
the environment is not left.

2627
01:12:22,771 --> 01:12:23,940
It's not always left.

2628
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:25,950
It to the extent the earth itself,

2629
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:27,280
to the extent that you know,

2630
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:32,420
we need regulation for externalities
that result from pollution.

2631
01:12:32,690 --> 01:12:35,910
It can be done at a more
local level than having

2632
01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:42,480
the funding where South Dakota going to
get the money to pursue a gigantic oil

2633
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:44,460
company that's ruining its environment.

2634
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,080
There aren't,

2635
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:46,430
well the northwest,

2636
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:47,790
North Dakota where all the fracking is,

2637
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:51,600
but let's say South Dakota comes up with
a new fracking or where do you think

2638
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:54,090
the federal government gets the
money from the North Dakotans.

2639
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:56,700
I mean the federal government doesn't
have any money that's taken from us.

2640
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,410
So why send it to Washington?

2641
01:12:58,411 --> 01:12:58,630
I mean,

2642
01:12:58,630 --> 01:12:59,790
you're out here in California.

2643
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,060
Why does California have to send me
to Washington and Beg for it back?

2644
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:06,450
I mean let California deal with its
own problems and keep the money here,

2645
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,820
but when you're thinking about all
the income tax and deals with it,

2646
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,790
who's going to do with it?

2647
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,540
If the government doesn't
deal with it in South Dakota,

2648
01:13:12,541 --> 01:13:13,170
doesn't deal with it.

2649
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:16,100
Who deals with the people who have to
go up against the frackers and show up

2650
01:13:16,140 --> 01:13:16,711
with torches?

2651
01:13:16,711 --> 01:13:20,350
There's a government in South Dakota
that government's going to deal with,

2652
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,080
but if you're going to
let a government do it,

2653
01:13:22,081 --> 01:13:23,550
why does it have to be
the federal government,

2654
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:24,180
Washington?

2655
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,630
Why can't it be a local government so
the government is okay with the federal

2656
01:13:27,631 --> 01:13:28,171
government's not.

2657
01:13:28,171 --> 01:13:28,351
Okay.

2658
01:13:28,351 --> 01:13:31,050
When it comes to regulating
environmental protection,

2659
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:35,340
the closer you are to the
the what you're regulating,

2660
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:37,890
the more efficient it's going to be
the least corrupt it's going to be.

2661
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,450
If you're going to regulate,

2662
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:42,390
you want to regulate as close
to the activity as possible.

2663
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:46,170
You don't want to have it outsourced to
Washington dc because it's going to cost

2664
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,970
much more and it's going
to be less effective,

2665
01:13:48,150 --> 01:13:51,960
but a lot of people want Washington to
pay for it because somehow they think it

2666
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:52,920
doesn't cost anything,

2667
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,860
but it actually costs more
when Washington pays for it.

2668
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,840
Then when your local
government pays for it,

2669
01:13:57,990 --> 01:14:01,320
but most of the stuff is
going to be in the courts.

2670
01:14:01,321 --> 01:14:05,890
I'm not saying that a business should
be able to dump pollution onto your.

2671
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:06,990
You know your property.

2672
01:14:07,790 --> 01:14:09,000
You can sue them for that.

2673
01:14:09,001 --> 01:14:09,661
That's a tort.

2674
01:14:09,661 --> 01:14:10,530
That's wrong.

2675
01:14:10,590 --> 01:14:11,910
They have take care of it,

2676
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:13,690
have to make sure that they don't know,

2677
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,740
but that's sort of disingenuous because
you know how incredibly difficult it is

2678
01:14:16,741 --> 01:14:19,320
for a farmer to sue a
gigantic corporation.

2679
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,580
They've ruined all their land.

2680
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,190
The corporation has
billions of dollars spent.

2681
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:23,150
You know,

2682
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:23,660
they won't.

2683
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,151
The lawyer,

2684
01:14:24,151 --> 01:14:24,990
the lawyers,

2685
01:14:25,070 --> 01:14:28,310
the lawyers will take the
case on a contingency.

2686
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,960
If you've got a big plaintiff,

2687
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:31,273
no problem.

2688
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:32,480
People don't have a profit.

2689
01:14:32,481 --> 01:14:34,330
The problem that we have in
this country with Laura's,

2690
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,870
it's too easy to sue people.

2691
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:36,201
I mean,

2692
01:14:36,201 --> 01:14:38,270
there's so much lawsuits
here because you know,

2693
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:38,910
uh,

2694
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,340
if you sue somebody,

2695
01:14:40,341 --> 01:14:43,940
you basically can extort money out of
the cost so much to defendant agree with

2696
01:14:43,941 --> 01:14:45,380
you that there are frivolous lawsuits.

2697
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:46,490
There's lots of them.

2698
01:14:46,670 --> 01:14:49,610
And so it's not that people
can't sue if they've been wrong.

2699
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,800
We have too many people
suing who haven't been wrong,

2700
01:14:51,801 --> 01:14:53,200
but it's because they're shaking down.

2701
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:57,350
But it's crazy to pretend
that corporations would
automatically give people

2702
01:14:57,351 --> 01:14:58,490
money if they were wrong,

2703
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:00,100
that they would like,

2704
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:02,660
all someone has to do is get
together a lawyer and sue them.

2705
01:15:02,661 --> 01:15:03,261
It'd be easy.

2706
01:15:03,261 --> 01:15:04,370
It's not going to be easy.

2707
01:15:04,520 --> 01:15:05,870
They're going to fight tooth and claw.

2708
01:15:05,871 --> 01:15:07,760
They're going to put it
off as long as possible.

2709
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,230
They're going to drag you through the mud.

2710
01:15:09,231 --> 01:15:10,880
They're going to drown you in legal fees.

2711
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,750
That's what they do.

2712
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:12,800
That's what they've done,

2713
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:17,590
but they've got to pay those legal fees
and pennies to them in comparison with

2714
01:15:17,591 --> 01:15:18,201
what they'd have to pay.

2715
01:15:18,201 --> 01:15:20,210
If they gave you millions
dogs to the ruin your farm.

2716
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,680
Well,

2717
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,020
they could save and legal fees by just
dragging the case out and using quality

2718
01:15:24,021 --> 01:15:26,300
lawyers that really know how
to manipulate the system.

2719
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,640
The idea that they would do it on
their own because of the market,

2720
01:15:28,641 --> 01:15:30,740
is that I have a problem with that.

2721
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:32,150
I don't know who should regulate it.

2722
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,700
You seem to think that the state
government will be qualified.

2723
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:37,790
I see state governments as
being woefully understaffed,

2724
01:15:37,791 --> 01:15:39,080
woefully underfunded.

2725
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:41,060
California is fucking bankrupt,

2726
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:43,310
so going after anybody

2727
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:45,840
fornia is underfunded.

2728
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:46,021
I mean,

2729
01:15:46,021 --> 01:15:47,000
look at all the revenue.

2730
01:15:47,010 --> 01:15:49,350
Look at all the income taxes that
are paid in the state of California.

2731
01:15:49,500 --> 01:15:53,330
Look at all the property taxes that
are sent up there to Sacramento.

2732
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:53,790
I mean,

2733
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:56,690
California is the problems in California,

2734
01:15:56,700 --> 01:15:58,380
not because the government
doesn't have enough money.

2735
01:15:58,410 --> 01:15:59,850
It's a government has too much money,

2736
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,860
there's too much garbage is too much tax.

2737
01:16:01,861 --> 01:16:03,030
It's just too much regulation.

2738
01:16:03,031 --> 01:16:05,790
There's too many people who work for
government because they have to be

2739
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:06,990
supported by everybody else.

2740
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:07,171
I mean,

2741
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:08,340
they don't produce anything.

2742
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:08,851
I mean,

2743
01:16:08,851 --> 01:16:10,050
most people who work for government,

2744
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:11,430
not only don't they produce anything,

2745
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:13,770
they get in the way of other
people who would produce stuff,

2746
01:16:13,771 --> 01:16:14,820
but the government won't let them,

2747
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:15,740
you know,

2748
01:16:15,740 --> 01:16:18,660
so we're all poor because we have to
pay the salaries while these government

2749
01:16:18,661 --> 01:16:19,140
workers.

2750
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:22,920
And now if you actually look at how
much government workers make relative to

2751
01:16:22,921 --> 01:16:23,970
private sector workers,

2752
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:25,260
you throw in all the benefits.

2753
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:28,500
The average person working for government
is making twice as much as the average

2754
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:29,760
person working in the private sector.

2755
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:33,480
Why do you think all the wealthiest
counties in America are all surrounding

2756
01:16:33,481 --> 01:16:34,440
Washington in DC?

2757
01:16:34,940 --> 01:16:35,310
I mean,

2758
01:16:35,310 --> 01:16:37,230
they're sucking the life out
of the rest of the country.

2759
01:16:37,740 --> 01:16:38,151
They're all,

2760
01:16:38,151 --> 01:16:38,361
yeah,

2761
01:16:38,361 --> 01:16:41,550
they're all getting rich lobbyists and
politicians and the lawyers because

2762
01:16:41,551 --> 01:16:42,750
that's where all the power is.

2763
01:16:42,751 --> 01:16:45,840
That's where you know as well
as Washington gets wealthier.

2764
01:16:45,841 --> 01:16:48,420
Everybody else gets poor because
they don't make anything.

2765
01:16:48,450 --> 01:16:49,410
They don't produce anything.

2766
01:16:49,530 --> 01:16:51,540
They suck the blood out of everybody else.

2767
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:51,821
Well,

2768
01:16:51,821 --> 01:16:53,050
I agree with you on that.

2769
01:16:53,110 --> 01:16:53,741
I mean we're.

2770
01:16:53,741 --> 01:16:56,890
We're in total agreement with where
we seem to differ is on the idea of

2771
01:16:56,891 --> 01:16:57,970
environmental protection.

2772
01:16:58,210 --> 01:16:59,230
That's where we seem to.

2773
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:01,000
You seem to think the
market will take care of it.

2774
01:17:01,001 --> 01:17:03,280
I seem to think there's no fucking way
the market would ever take care of it

2775
01:17:03,281 --> 01:17:04,210
unless you held a gun to their head.

2776
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:05,710
You know what I mean?

2777
01:17:05,711 --> 01:17:09,980
I would be okay if they left all
the environmental rules place that I

2778
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:12,080
think shouldn't be there because this.

2779
01:17:12,081 --> 01:17:13,560
Which ones specifically are.

2780
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:13,780
I mean,

2781
01:17:13,780 --> 01:17:16,040
do you know which ones do you have a
problem with you don't think should be

2782
01:17:16,041 --> 01:17:16,510
there?

2783
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:16,701
Well,

2784
01:17:16,701 --> 01:17:20,840
because I've heard you say that you think
the EPA should have the environmental

2785
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:21,920
code book in front of me.

2786
01:17:21,921 --> 01:17:22,410
I know.

2787
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:25,140
I'm not sure as a scientist or someone
has a vested interest in fracking and it

2788
01:17:25,150 --> 01:17:26,040
must be a few concerns.

2789
01:17:26,041 --> 01:17:26,360
Yeah.

2790
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:26,600
I,

2791
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,790
I just know that I think there's
more laws on the books then,

2792
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:31,360
then we should have
certainly for the federal,

2793
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:35,990
but I'm saying my point is even if I'd
be fine leaving them all there because

2794
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:40,940
the problem that we are creating from
excess environmental regulation right is

2795
01:17:40,941 --> 01:17:43,160
small compared to all the other problems.

2796
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:43,491
I mean,

2797
01:17:43,491 --> 01:17:44,960
like you'd have to
reset rubber regulation.

2798
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:46,580
You always talking about what about drugs,

2799
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:46,821
right?

2800
01:17:46,821 --> 01:17:47,121
What about,

2801
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:47,954
oh,

2802
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:49,850
the government needs to uh,

2803
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:50,060
you know,

2804
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:51,470
make sure that the drugs are safe.

2805
01:17:51,620 --> 01:17:51,891
But I,

2806
01:17:51,891 --> 01:17:52,280
I'm,

2807
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:55,940
I'm pretty sure that more
people die because drugs
that might've helped them are

2808
01:17:55,941 --> 01:17:56,960
kept off the market.

2809
01:17:57,290 --> 01:17:59,200
Then people who die because a drug,

2810
01:17:59,230 --> 01:17:59,450
you know,

2811
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:00,100
killed,

2812
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:00,620
you know.

2813
01:18:00,620 --> 01:18:05,150
And I think the reason
that pharmaceuticals and
drugs are so expensive in

2814
01:18:05,151 --> 01:18:09,050
America is because it's so expensive
to get something approved by the FDA.

2815
01:18:09,260 --> 01:18:13,280
I think we had a much better and much
healthier system before the FDA existed.

2816
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:18,400
And at least initially the FDA only
made you prove that your drugs weren't

2817
01:18:19,101 --> 01:18:19,934
harmful.

2818
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:23,840
Now you have to prove that they're
not harmful and that they work right,

2819
01:18:23,841 --> 01:18:25,100
that they're efficacious.

2820
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,870
And that is extremely expensive.

2821
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:27,823
Well,

2822
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:28,700
how would you,

2823
01:18:28,700 --> 01:18:32,390
how could you possibly sell something
if you don't prove it's not dangerous?

2824
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:32,690
No,

2825
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:33,130
no,

2826
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:33,850
let's that.

2827
01:18:33,850 --> 01:18:34,150
Well,

2828
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:35,900
because the doctor has to prescribe it.

2829
01:18:35,901 --> 01:18:37,550
So let's say I'm a medical doctor,

2830
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:38,240
right?

2831
01:18:38,240 --> 01:18:40,010
And let's say I'm your
doctor and you trust me.

2832
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:41,870
And I actually looked at a drug and I,

2833
01:18:41,871 --> 01:18:44,390
I'm convinced based on my examination,

2834
01:18:44,391 --> 01:18:45,590
I looked at their own studies.

2835
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,290
I'm convinced it's a good drug and
I think it's going to help you.

2836
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:48,681
Right?

2837
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:48,970
But,

2838
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:49,660
but companies,

2839
01:18:49,660 --> 01:18:51,770
Dr. Studies all the time
like who's this town?

2840
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:52,281
But why?

2841
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:55,010
But why do you trust the FDA?

2842
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,050
Why do you trust them?

2843
01:18:56,460 --> 01:18:58,580
Do we need to trust someone?

2844
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,110
But who would you rather trust?

2845
01:19:00,111 --> 01:19:03,770
A doctor that you know or some bureaucrat
you've never met who doesn't even know

2846
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:04,281
who you are.

2847
01:19:04,281 --> 01:19:08,210
I don't think my doctor has enough time
to review all of the medication in the

2848
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:09,890
world and all the studies
that have been done,

2849
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:14,660
all the different classes have been
done on different types of people.

2850
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:15,330
Okay.

2851
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:18,230
Let's forget about the harm part
because that's a little bit.

2852
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:19,780
Maybe no,

2853
01:19:20,110 --> 01:19:21,650
but advocacy is important,

2854
01:19:21,651 --> 01:19:22,880
but the hard part is probably the most.

2855
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:24,620
The efficacy as the more expensive.

2856
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:25,010
Okay.

2857
01:19:25,010 --> 01:19:28,400
But the advocacy should also be in
place for things like cancer drugs and

2858
01:19:28,401 --> 01:19:31,160
dealing with things like devastate the
immune system and may or may not be,

2859
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,020
but if it doesn't harm you,

2860
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:33,351
okay.

2861
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:34,184
If they were profit,

2862
01:19:34,710 --> 01:19:35,960
if it can harm you,

2863
01:19:35,961 --> 01:19:37,610
then why can't the garment
lit it on the market?

2864
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:38,780
Why is it bullshit?

2865
01:19:38,781 --> 01:19:40,850
Because I let people
decide if it's bullshit.

2866
01:19:40,940 --> 01:19:42,050
Let doctors decide.

2867
01:19:42,051 --> 01:19:44,870
Let patients decide what if
there's a drug that would save me?

2868
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:45,470
Right,

2869
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:46,161
but the government says,

2870
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:46,311
no,

2871
01:19:46,311 --> 01:19:47,330
we want to keep testing it.

2872
01:19:47,331 --> 01:19:48,260
We know it can't hurt you,

2873
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:50,450
but we want to just do another
three years of testing.

2874
01:19:50,510 --> 01:19:50,871
Meanwhile,

2875
01:19:50,871 --> 01:19:52,590
I die while I'm waiting
for that drug to come.

2876
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:53,511
Why can't I say,

2877
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:53,661
look,

2878
01:19:53,661 --> 01:19:54,800
I don't care about the test,

2879
01:19:54,801 --> 01:19:55,634
I just want to drug,

2880
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:56,690
and the governor says you can't.

2881
01:19:57,020 --> 01:19:57,651
You have to wait,

2882
01:19:57,651 --> 01:20:00,920
and I know that there are a lot of drugs
that work that they don't let on the

2883
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:01,530
market.

2884
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:01,860
You know,

2885
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:05,780
and you're talking about what about what
if I'm a big pharmaceutical company and

2886
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:09,510
I have a lot of money and some small
company that comes out with a new pill

2887
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,030
that's better than mine
that has no side effects.

2888
01:20:12,150 --> 01:20:13,320
I don't want it on the market.

2889
01:20:13,380 --> 01:20:14,213
What do I do?

2890
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:17,340
I give money to do my
politician in my hip pocket.

2891
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:20,610
Can I say you killed that drug
because that's better than my drug.

2892
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:24,180
It has less side effects and I don't
want the competition so they keep it up,

2893
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:30,180
but that really has nothing to do with
the Fba solved in these conspiracies.

2894
01:20:30,581 --> 01:20:30,791
I don't know,

2895
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:33,780
but a politician are on these
committees can squash these structures.

2896
01:20:33,781 --> 01:20:34,770
You don't think they do that.

2897
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:35,731
You don't think you,

2898
01:20:35,731 --> 01:20:35,891
you.

2899
01:20:35,891 --> 01:20:39,330
You talked about how you're saying
that how evil companies are when they.

2900
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,050
When they get in bed,

2901
01:20:40,050 --> 01:20:42,240
you don't think some people are evil,

2902
01:20:42,270 --> 01:20:42,450
right,

2903
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,640
but wouldn't some of those
evil people you know,

2904
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:48,480
try to have their friends in government
squash and competitor's product?

2905
01:20:48,481 --> 01:20:49,250
It's very possible.

2906
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:50,250
That would be a crime.

2907
01:20:50,310 --> 01:20:50,520
Yeah,

2908
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:51,301
but they do it anyway.

2909
01:20:51,301 --> 01:20:52,890
You don't think politicians commit crimes,

2910
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,750
but don't you think that
that would always take place?

2911
01:20:54,751 --> 01:20:55,500
Those kinds of crimes?

2912
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:55,950
It takes.

2913
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:56,221
Yes,

2914
01:20:56,221 --> 01:20:57,330
because of the FDA,

2915
01:20:57,331 --> 01:21:01,230
so you think that if there
was no regulatory commissions
or no governing bodies

2916
01:21:01,231 --> 01:21:02,130
when it comes to drugs,

2917
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:05,160
that what we will do is just put it all
on the market and we would all figure

2918
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,060
out what was effective.

2919
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:08,670
What was that look at a minimum.

2920
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,573
Just say,

2921
01:21:10,020 --> 01:21:11,130
show that it doesn't hurt you,

2922
01:21:11,490 --> 01:21:13,590
but the minute you have
to prove that it works,

2923
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:15,300
it's so easy for them to say,

2924
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:15,511
oh,

2925
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:16,680
the proof isn't conclusive.

2926
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,760
We're not going to prove you.

2927
01:21:17,910 --> 01:21:20,730
It's too subjective because
showing that it doesn't harm you.

2928
01:21:20,731 --> 01:21:20,941
Okay?

2929
01:21:20,941 --> 01:21:22,050
You can show that yes,

2930
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:23,070
people took this drug,

2931
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:23,911
may didn't get sick.

2932
01:21:23,911 --> 01:21:24,601
They didn't get harmed.

2933
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:28,380
When there's drugs out there that actually
do work and you're taking a drug that

2934
01:21:28,381 --> 01:21:31,740
doesn't work because the company lied
and then attempts to years to find out

2935
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:32,610
because it's a new product.

2936
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:35,580
Now you're assuming that your doctor's
an idiot who prescribed it to you.

2937
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,240
How would the doctor know if he prescribed
phen phen or via all these different

2938
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:42,390
drugs that have been pulled off the
market medical school after they have been

2939
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:44,700
prescribed by people who
went to medical school,

2940
01:21:44,701 --> 01:21:47,880
but if your doctor doesn't know who
went to medical school and is a doctor,

2941
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:51,240
how does some bureaucrat and the FDA know
who maybe didn't go to medical school

2942
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,910
and isn't competent enough to be a doctor?

2943
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:56,820
That's why these companies to show a
tremendous amount of work showing the

2944
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:58,440
efficacy and safety of their product.

2945
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:00,270
That's what the FDA's job is.

2946
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:01,800
It might not be that good at it.

2947
01:22:01,801 --> 01:22:02,940
It might cost a lot of money,

2948
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:07,710
but the idea behind it is that you have
these stringent ex extremely while.

2949
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:08,131
Meanwhile,

2950
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:08,311
Joe,

2951
01:22:08,311 --> 01:22:12,240
it takes you a lot more time to develop
a drug and it takes a lot more money.

2952
01:22:12,241 --> 01:22:12,991
And because of that,

2953
01:22:12,991 --> 01:22:13,171
you know,

2954
01:22:13,171 --> 01:22:14,700
two companies can only,

2955
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:14,911
you know,

2956
01:22:14,911 --> 01:22:16,320
you have some illnesses,

2957
01:22:16,321 --> 01:22:18,990
are some diseases that only
affect a small number of people.

2958
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:20,970
And so because it's so expensive,

2959
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:22,080
nobody can do it.

2960
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:22,551
So what,

2961
01:22:22,551 --> 01:22:22,711
what,

2962
01:22:22,711 --> 01:22:24,120
what did drug companies need to do?

2963
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,670
They come up with cures for baldness,

2964
01:22:26,790 --> 01:22:26,941
uh,

2965
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:29,160
because that they can mass
market or they want to,

2966
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:29,470
you know,

2967
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:30,840
deal with erectile dysfunction,

2968
01:22:30,841 --> 01:22:32,230
but if you've got a,

2969
01:22:32,231 --> 01:22:32,710
you know,

2970
01:22:32,710 --> 01:22:34,380
a disease that might kill you,

2971
01:22:34,590 --> 01:22:36,960
but it's only affecting a small
percent of the population.

2972
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:39,150
Nobody can afford to
spend the R and D on it.

2973
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:42,930
It's to the government makes it so
expensive for companies to do this.

2974
01:22:42,990 --> 01:22:44,280
Why not just get out of the way?

2975
01:22:44,370 --> 01:22:48,420
Why not trust human beings and just don't
assume that everybody else is an idiot

2976
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,500
and let people make
decisions for themselves.

2977
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:50,851
But I know,

2978
01:22:50,851 --> 01:22:51,091
look,

2979
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:51,271
I mean,

2980
01:22:51,271 --> 01:22:53,010
I can smell the pot when I walk in here,

2981
01:22:53,011 --> 01:22:53,281
right?

2982
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:53,551
I mean,

2983
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:54,060
how dare you,

2984
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:54,271
right?

2985
01:22:54,271 --> 01:22:54,781
So I mean,

2986
01:22:54,781 --> 01:22:55,410
look,

2987
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:55,831
I want,

2988
01:22:55,831 --> 01:22:57,630
I want marijuana to be legalized,

2989
01:22:57,690 --> 01:23:00,080
I mean so because I trust
people to make decisions.

2990
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:02,010
Well you don't want that because
if people are going to get high,

2991
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,700
they're gonna not let you
frack what are they doing?

2992
01:23:05,890 --> 01:23:07,450
But I'm sure you agree with me,

2993
01:23:07,451 --> 01:23:07,631
right,

2994
01:23:07,631 --> 01:23:09,700
that marijuana should be
legal to smoke marijuana.

2995
01:23:09,970 --> 01:23:12,130
What certainly should be illegal to do?

2996
01:23:12,131 --> 01:23:14,620
Almost everything because
everything that doesn't hurt people,

2997
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,870
but there's a difference
between different.

2998
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,033
In what way?

2999
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:18,730
Well,

3000
01:23:18,730 --> 01:23:23,730
you trust people to smoke pot responsibly
or to drink or if you're smoking pot,

3001
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:24,910
you're not fracking.

3002
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:26,680
They're two different things.

3003
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:28,743
Case scenario,

3004
01:23:29,680 --> 01:23:30,610
you might get you guys,

3005
01:23:30,611 --> 01:23:30,860
hi,

3006
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:31,693
because you're in the room,

3007
01:23:31,930 --> 01:23:33,460
you get might get some secondhand pot.

3008
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,340
You know the difference between that
and the environmental protection.

3009
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:39,550
This is a huge difference between that
and regular regulating environmental

3010
01:23:39,551 --> 01:23:40,384
disasters or.

3011
01:23:40,830 --> 01:23:41,350
No,

3012
01:23:41,350 --> 01:23:44,380
I'm just very consistent in,

3013
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:45,640
in my view of the world,

3014
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:45,851
right?

3015
01:23:45,851 --> 01:23:46,301
I just,

3016
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:49,360
I believe that we're all
about money and Martin.

3017
01:23:49,370 --> 01:23:49,470
No,

3018
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:49,720
no.

3019
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:51,490
I'm about individual liberty and freedom.

3020
01:23:51,670 --> 01:23:52,870
You're also about the market.

3021
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:53,160
None of that.

3022
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:56,770
But that's because that's an expression
of free people coming together in a free

3023
01:23:56,771 --> 01:23:57,310
market.

3024
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:02,310
It's individuals making exchanges that
are mutually beneficial to both parties.

3025
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,970
That's what freedom is all about.

3026
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:05,410
The minute you involve government,

3027
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,420
the minute you have laws and regulations,

3028
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:10,690
what that does is diminish our freedom
because the government tells us what we

3029
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:11,440
can't do,

3030
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:11,960
right?

3031
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:13,240
If the government doesn't say we can,

3032
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:13,961
we can't do it,

3033
01:24:13,961 --> 01:24:14,794
then we can do it.

3034
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:17,980
And so that's why government
laws should all about,

3035
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:21,910
should be about protecting private
property and life and liberty that,

3036
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:22,091
look,

3037
01:24:22,091 --> 01:24:25,150
I can do whatever I want as long
as I don't infringe upon you,

3038
01:24:25,290 --> 01:24:25,500
right?

3039
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,170
I can't,

3040
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:26,291
I,

3041
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:26,531
you know,

3042
01:24:26,531 --> 01:24:28,330
I have a right to pursue my own happiness.

3043
01:24:28,331 --> 01:24:29,920
But I can't steal from you to do it.

3044
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:30,790
I can't,

3045
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:31,750
I can't injure you.

3046
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:32,380
And that's where,

3047
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:32,621
yes,

3048
01:24:32,621 --> 01:24:34,000
I can't pollute your air.

3049
01:24:34,090 --> 01:24:35,320
I can't pollute your water.

3050
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,280
I agree with you there.

3051
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,750
But as long as I'm not harming you,

3052
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:40,730
if you're polluting my water.

3053
01:24:40,731 --> 01:24:42,100
And I said I can't do that.

3054
01:24:42,101 --> 01:24:43,570
But you do if you're fracking.

3055
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,330
But your response to that

3056
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,010
and you can get money.

3057
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:48,521
Yes,

3058
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:49,000
you can,

3059
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,630
but do you see that that is not a,

3060
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:51,850
that's not an answer,

3061
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:55,510
but people don't want to get sued
and mean people that are going to.

3062
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,840
If you're doing something like fracking
is generating billions of dollars and

3063
01:24:58,841 --> 01:25:00,010
you have to pay off a million here,

3064
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:02,140
a million there because
you fuck up some guys farm.

3065
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:03,760
That's not that big of a deal.

3066
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,500
You know that's not the answer.

3067
01:25:05,530 --> 01:25:06,970
The answer is not.

3068
01:25:06,971 --> 01:25:10,270
You can give them money or they can give
you money because they ruin your life.

3069
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:10,960
Well if you.

3070
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:11,830
If if you say,

3071
01:25:11,831 --> 01:25:12,520
okay,

3072
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:15,820
we're not going to have any fracking
because a couple of farms got fucked up.

3073
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,080
Okay.

3074
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,200
If that's the tradeoff,

3075
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:21,880
if we value those forms that heavily with
the whole nation is going to be worse

3076
01:25:21,881 --> 01:25:25,120
off including those far because I'm
sure the farmers will get compensated.

3077
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:27,180
I don't even know the particular
situation and talk about,

3078
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:30,190
but you know how many farmers are now
multimillionaires because they lived in

3079
01:25:30,191 --> 01:25:32,680
North Dakota and now they
can frack instead of farm.

3080
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:33,100
I mean,

3081
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:37,480
so many farmers are are making a fortune
and you're trying to find the one that

3082
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:38,051
that suffering,

3083
01:25:38,051 --> 01:25:38,560
but I can.

3084
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:40,030
I can show you many more.

3085
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,270
There are a lot more.

3086
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:43,000
The earth itself,

3087
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:43,511
the earth,

3088
01:25:43,511 --> 01:25:46,390
forget about the what
whether we frack or not,

3089
01:25:46,391 --> 01:25:46,841
frank,

3090
01:25:46,841 --> 01:25:49,150
that the wildlife or the fresh water,

3091
01:25:49,151 --> 01:25:50,680
all those things that poop poisoning,

3092
01:25:50,681 --> 01:25:51,850
that stuff is bad.

3093
01:25:51,851 --> 01:25:53,640
It's a big kind of chuckle about.

3094
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:56,050
I don't think the earth is going to,

3095
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:56,560
you know,

3096
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,850
obviously it can't care,

3097
01:25:57,851 --> 01:26:00,220
but I don't think we're
going to destroy the planet.

3098
01:26:00,430 --> 01:26:00,820
You know,

3099
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,960
whether or not we frack or not you,

3100
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:04,160
I don't think it's going to,

3101
01:26:04,161 --> 01:26:05,120
in the scheme of things,

3102
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,440
make a difference in our,

3103
01:26:06,441 --> 01:26:08,690
in our ecosystem or our
environment can let me know.

3104
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,580
We'll make a difference
in our standard of living.

3105
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:11,091
That's for sure.

3106
01:26:11,091 --> 01:26:11,900
Let me ask you a question.

3107
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:12,141
Okay.

3108
01:26:12,141 --> 01:26:13,400
Let's say let's pick a lake.

3109
01:26:13,401 --> 01:26:14,180
Lake Michigan.

3110
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:14,780
Okay.

3111
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:16,010
Say if you,

3112
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,200
if there was something that you
could do that with guaranteed.

3113
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,570
Kill every fish in Lake Michigan forever,

3114
01:26:20,571 --> 01:26:25,070
but provide massive economic prosperity
to everyone else in the country.

3115
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:26,360
Lift us out of a recession.

3116
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:28,160
Would you be in favor of doing it?

3117
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:28,671
Well,

3118
01:26:28,671 --> 01:26:30,320
what kind of prosperity you talking about?

3119
01:26:30,340 --> 01:26:32,570
She's just like the fucking best.

3120
01:26:32,571 --> 01:26:33,890
It's ever been times 10.

3121
01:26:33,891 --> 01:26:36,890
So you're telling those kills
off everything in Lake Michigan,

3122
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,960
everything near the lake is dead.

3123
01:26:38,961 --> 01:26:40,340
You can't do no fishing,

3124
01:26:40,341 --> 01:26:40,851
no camp,

3125
01:26:40,851 --> 01:26:41,840
but everybody else.

3126
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:44,960
It's like you're talking like roaring
20 [inaudible] like the jetsons.

3127
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:49,090
I'm talking about a future Utopian
world and all we got to sacrifice as

3128
01:26:49,091 --> 01:26:51,860
deficient and forever
just in that one leg.

3129
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:52,340
Yup.

3130
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:53,360
Forever probably.

3131
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:55,530
Sounds like a decent chance
of terrible trade off.

3132
01:26:55,590 --> 01:26:57,020
Is that the only way we could do it?

3133
01:26:57,050 --> 01:26:57,231
No,

3134
01:26:57,231 --> 01:26:57,591
but no,

3135
01:26:57,591 --> 01:27:00,590
but you're telling me you care more about
those fish than all then your fellow

3136
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:03,350
human being though I have more
faith in my fellow human being.

3137
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:03,690
Sorry.

3138
01:27:03,690 --> 01:27:07,360
I think it's possible for us to achieve
prosperity without killing the fun out

3139
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:08,600
of everything in Lake Michigan.

3140
01:27:09,940 --> 01:27:11,300
But that's not the trade off.

3141
01:27:11,301 --> 01:27:11,751
You told me,

3142
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:13,730
you said if we get it instantaneously,

3143
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:14,630
create all this.

3144
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:17,030
Well those fish trap.

3145
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:17,960
Hi.

3146
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:18,201
No,

3147
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:18,561
but no,

3148
01:27:18,561 --> 01:27:19,394
but I.

3149
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:22,340
But I hold human life more
valuable than than a fish.

3150
01:27:22,530 --> 01:27:23,750
We eat fish,

3151
01:27:23,850 --> 01:27:24,260
right?

3152
01:27:24,260 --> 01:27:25,340
I don't need human beings.

3153
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:25,930
I have.

3154
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:28,190
I probably eat fish
more than anything else.

3155
01:27:28,280 --> 01:27:29,900
Of course you understand though,

3156
01:27:29,901 --> 01:27:33,500
as an intelligent man that the ecosystem
is incredibly complex and when you kill

3157
01:27:33,501 --> 01:27:34,340
off an entire lake,

3158
01:27:34,341 --> 01:27:35,570
you don't just affect the fish.

3159
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,370
You affect everything anywhere near.

3160
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:37,851
In fact,

3161
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:38,930
probably the whole contract,

3162
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:39,530
I doubt.

3163
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:43,070
I doubt the whole country would collapse
if we didn't have that one collapsed.

3164
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:44,240
We could adapt human beings.

3165
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:45,103
We're incredibly in.

3166
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:46,910
You said we were going to have a massive,

3167
01:27:46,930 --> 01:27:47,140
you know,

3168
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:50,120
tenfold increase in our
collective standard of living.

3169
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,070
We're going to pull those out.

3170
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:56,060
But doesn't that mean by definition that
we didn't have any downside from the

3171
01:27:56,061 --> 01:27:57,560
loss of one of the Great Lakes,

3172
01:27:59,450 --> 01:28:00,770
the Great Lakes itself,

3173
01:28:00,771 --> 01:28:02,090
the lake itself is fucked.

3174
01:28:02,091 --> 01:28:03,310
One of the great wonders of.

3175
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:05,720
But you told us that everybody else would.

3176
01:28:05,740 --> 01:28:08,270
We would all be better off including
the people who used to live by the lake

3177
01:28:09,820 --> 01:28:11,300
because just because some,

3178
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:12,830
because everybody will be better off,

3179
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:14,660
doesn't mean that's the
only way we could do it.

3180
01:28:15,150 --> 01:28:18,650
I think there could be a way to do that
without doing that and that should be

3181
01:28:18,651 --> 01:28:19,820
pursued above all else.

3182
01:28:19,821 --> 01:28:24,080
The idea of figuring out a way to make
this world better without polluting it.

3183
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:24,231
Well,

3184
01:28:24,231 --> 01:28:25,790
we already know how to
make the world better.

3185
01:28:25,791 --> 01:28:26,900
I mean it's freedom.

3186
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:28,130
It's the freer we are,

3187
01:28:28,310 --> 01:28:31,070
the more prosperous we're going to be
and the enemy of freedom is government

3188
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:31,790
right now.

3189
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:32,960
If you have a little bit of government,

3190
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:33,650
that's a good thing.

3191
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:36,770
If you have just enough government to
secure your freedoms and secure your

3192
01:28:36,771 --> 01:28:37,250
liberties,

3193
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:37,850
liberties,

3194
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:42,110
then you have prosperity but too much
government then it's an impediment to

3195
01:28:42,111 --> 01:28:42,980
liberty and prosperity.

3196
01:28:42,981 --> 01:28:45,950
But what we should really be talking
about is what's going to happen.

3197
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,400
You know,

3198
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,550
and you've got all this propaganda out
there by the government that is being

3199
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:50,151
spread by,

3200
01:28:50,151 --> 01:28:50,361
you know,

3201
01:28:50,361 --> 01:28:51,320
by Wall Street as well.

3202
01:28:51,440 --> 01:28:52,540
That what Ben Bernanke,

3203
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:56,360
he has done his work that we've got a
real economic recovery that the jobs are

3204
01:28:56,361 --> 01:28:57,194
on their way,

3205
01:28:57,230 --> 01:28:58,250
that there no inflation.

3206
01:28:58,251 --> 01:28:59,360
All of this is wrong.

3207
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,070
The economy is suffering because

3208
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,030
of what the government is doing.

3209
01:29:03,031 --> 01:29:03,960
There is no recovery.

3210
01:29:03,961 --> 01:29:05,010
I think we're in a depression.

3211
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:06,600
I think we've been at the
depression the whole time.

3212
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:08,490
I think the numbers are manipulated.

3213
01:29:08,491 --> 01:29:11,280
I think the government is understating
the true rate of inflation,

3214
01:29:11,370 --> 01:29:13,470
so that means it looks like
the economy is growing,

3215
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,970
but it's actually contracting.

3216
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:17,640
That's why the labor forces is imploding.

3217
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,451
That's why people,

3218
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:18,631
you know,

3219
01:29:18,631 --> 01:29:19,560
there was no good jobs.

3220
01:29:19,561 --> 01:29:21,530
That's why people have a following,

3221
01:29:21,550 --> 01:29:25,320
a standard of living of people feel
like it's a recession because it is.

3222
01:29:25,440 --> 01:29:28,530
The government is trying to pretend
that it's not because they point to the

3223
01:29:28,531 --> 01:29:29,221
stock market,

3224
01:29:29,221 --> 01:29:31,470
but so what stocks are going
up doesn't mean anything.

3225
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,450
I mean it's not even that
earnings are going up.

3226
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:36,420
Corporations aren't really earning more
money just to stock prices are going up

3227
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:37,830
and there are a lot of people would say,

3228
01:29:37,831 --> 01:29:38,091
well,

3229
01:29:38,091 --> 01:29:40,440
the corporations have a lot of cash.

3230
01:29:40,920 --> 01:29:41,071
Well,

3231
01:29:41,071 --> 01:29:41,904
because they borrowed it,

3232
01:29:42,180 --> 01:29:44,010
they only have that cash
because they issued debt.

3233
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,620
Corporations now have more
debt than ever before.

3234
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,390
Even if you net out the cash,

3235
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:50,580
the government has more
debt than ever before.

3236
01:29:50,940 --> 01:29:52,260
Americans have more debt.

3237
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:53,610
Look at all the student loans we have.

3238
01:29:53,611 --> 01:29:54,930
Look at the mortgage debt,

3239
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:56,183
credit card debt,

3240
01:29:56,190 --> 01:29:59,760
we are leveraged up to the hilt and the
only way we keep this thing going is

3241
01:29:59,761 --> 01:30:02,460
because we can borrow more because
the people loaning us the money.

3242
01:30:02,461 --> 01:30:04,440
Don't realize that we're
too broke to pay it back,

3243
01:30:05,060 --> 01:30:06,890
but he like apple that
has billions of dollars.

3244
01:30:07,330 --> 01:30:07,520
Look,

3245
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,540
apple's a good company.

3246
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:09,700
How many companies are like that out?

3247
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:10,930
They're not that many w.

3248
01:30:10,931 --> 01:30:11,764
We need more of them.

3249
01:30:11,790 --> 01:30:12,970
How many do you think there are that,

3250
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,610
that have like a pile of cash?

3251
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:16,740
Not that many because
most of them have cash,

3252
01:30:16,741 --> 01:30:17,610
but then they have debt.

3253
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:18,270
Okay.

3254
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:19,860
Apple just issued a bunch of debt.

3255
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:20,311
By the way they,

3256
01:30:20,311 --> 01:30:20,500
they,

3257
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,960
they issued longterm debt.

3258
01:30:21,961 --> 01:30:23,820
So some of that cash they borrowed.

3259
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:24,750
Um,

3260
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:25,111
but you know,

3261
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:27,330
a lot of the cash that
apple has is offshore.

3262
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,820
They can't even bring it home
because the tax rates would kill him.

3263
01:30:29,970 --> 01:30:30,631
So the tax,

3264
01:30:30,631 --> 01:30:32,010
the money is out of the country.

3265
01:30:32,120 --> 01:30:37,120
When you see things like France imposing
a 75 percent tax on the very wealthy,

3266
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,540
does that freak you out?

3267
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:39,001
Well,

3268
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:40,380
it's not that much lower here.

3269
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:40,681
I mean,

3270
01:30:40,681 --> 01:30:41,790
you're living in California,

3271
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:42,240
right?

3272
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:46,140
So the California income tax
is 13 point three is the top,

3273
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:46,890
but the federal,

3274
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:47,870
what's the federal tax?

3275
01:30:47,871 --> 01:30:48,960
It's 39 point nine.

3276
01:30:48,961 --> 01:30:52,050
So call it 40 plus you get another
four percent for obamacare.

3277
01:30:52,290 --> 01:30:54,300
So you got 44 percent federal tax.

3278
01:30:54,330 --> 01:30:54,750
Obamacare,

3279
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:55,541
really four percent.

3280
01:30:55,541 --> 01:30:56,430
So four percent extra,

3281
01:30:56,431 --> 01:30:57,091
three point nine.

3282
01:30:57,091 --> 01:30:57,660
So called force.

3283
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,310
You've got 44 percent federal tax,

3284
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:00,810
then you add California,

3285
01:31:00,811 --> 01:31:00,991
right?

3286
01:31:00,991 --> 01:31:01,800
So 44,

3287
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:02,633
57.

3288
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,640
So you're at like 57 percent
marginal tax rate in California,

3289
01:31:05,790 --> 01:31:07,050
but that's just your income tax.

3290
01:31:07,770 --> 01:31:08,480
What about,

3291
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:08,850
you know,

3292
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:10,410
what about your property taxes,

3293
01:31:10,411 --> 01:31:11,420
your sales taxes,

3294
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:12,600
all the other taxes you pay.

3295
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:16,380
I mean the government's taken 57 percent
and then out of the 43 percent you got

3296
01:31:16,381 --> 01:31:17,214
left.

3297
01:31:17,310 --> 01:31:17,521
You know,

3298
01:31:17,521 --> 01:31:21,130
I was looking at listening to one of
your other podcasts and you were talking

3299
01:31:21,131 --> 01:31:22,020
and you said something like,

3300
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:22,261
look,

3301
01:31:22,261 --> 01:31:22,950
you know,

3302
01:31:22,950 --> 01:31:26,040
I don't want the government to take half
more than half or something like that.

3303
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:27,113
Why half?

3304
01:31:27,180 --> 01:31:29,220
Why do you know a medieval serf?

3305
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:31,410
And this is futile system of serfdom,

3306
01:31:31,411 --> 01:31:33,390
which was considered very repressive.

3307
01:31:33,391 --> 01:31:33,571
You know,

3308
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:34,470
in the Middle Ages,

3309
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:36,240
if you were a serf,

3310
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:40,590
you had to give the Lord 25
percent of what you produced 20,

3311
01:31:40,591 --> 01:31:44,490
so you were in the 25 percent tax bracket
and you got to keep seventy five cents

3312
01:31:44,491 --> 01:31:47,070
on the dollar and that was
considered exploitation.

3313
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,170
What I would give to be,

3314
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,630
I would love to be able
to be as free as a surf.

3315
01:31:51,810 --> 01:31:54,780
If the government just treated
me like a lord treated the surf,

3316
01:31:55,050 --> 01:31:55,390
it'd be.

3317
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:56,223
That'd be awesome.

3318
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:56,461
My,

3319
01:31:56,461 --> 01:32:00,490
they have to cut my taxes in half to get
my tax bracket down to just 25 percent

3320
01:32:00,491 --> 01:32:01,510
so I could be a surf.

3321
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:03,160
But at one point in America,

3322
01:32:03,400 --> 01:32:04,990
the government took nothing,

3323
01:32:05,470 --> 01:32:05,831
nothing.

3324
01:32:05,831 --> 01:32:06,580
In fact,

3325
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:09,770
when they first created the
income tax right in 1913,

3326
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:09,910
eight,

3327
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:11,500
it got an income tax a hundred years ago.

3328
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:16,180
The reason that they created it was
because the government told average

3329
01:32:16,181 --> 01:32:17,014
Americans,

3330
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:20,710
if we tax the top one percent
of the top one percent,

3331
01:32:20,711 --> 01:32:21,790
it was a tiny tax.

3332
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,570
You had to earn something
like the equivalent of like
$2 million a year before

3333
01:32:25,571 --> 01:32:28,700
you had to get into the one percent
bracket and the top bracket was seven

3334
01:32:28,701 --> 01:32:29,200
percent,

3335
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:33,730
but what Congress told the average
American is that if we can tax the very

3336
01:32:33,731 --> 01:32:34,930
wealthy a tiny bit,

3337
01:32:35,140 --> 01:32:37,000
you won't have to pay any taxes at all.

3338
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:42,100
We'll get rid of all of the duties and
the import taxes and all of the federal

3339
01:32:42,101 --> 01:32:44,650
government because the federal
government was tiny back then they said,

3340
01:32:44,651 --> 01:32:47,860
we'll pay for everything just by
a tiny little tax on the rich.

3341
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:48,610
Okay.

3342
01:32:48,610 --> 01:32:50,680
Now the income tax taxes,

3343
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:55,570
the average guy at rates far in excess
of anything contemplated for the

3344
01:32:55,571 --> 01:32:56,321
rockefellers,

3345
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:57,070
the vanderbilts.

3346
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:57,550
I mean,

3347
01:32:57,550 --> 01:32:57,880
you know,

3348
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,661
we got caught.

3349
01:32:58,661 --> 01:32:59,620
That was the original,

3350
01:32:59,621 --> 01:32:59,801
you know,

3351
01:32:59,801 --> 01:33:01,780
99 percent versus the one percent,

3352
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:02,320
right?

3353
01:33:02,320 --> 01:33:06,490
Because the 99 percent wanted the income
tax on the one percent and now they're

3354
01:33:06,491 --> 01:33:11,320
clobbered with tax rates that nobody
would have even considered because the top

3355
01:33:11,321 --> 01:33:13,540
tax bracket initially was seven percent.

3356
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:14,770
That was as high as it went.

3357
01:33:14,980 --> 01:33:15,460
And of course,

3358
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:15,641
you know,

3359
01:33:15,641 --> 01:33:17,590
there was no social
security taxes back then.

3360
01:33:17,591 --> 01:33:18,700
There were no state income taxes,

3361
01:33:18,790 --> 01:33:20,380
so Americans were really free.

3362
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:21,580
You kept it all.

3363
01:33:22,290 --> 01:33:22,570
Well,

3364
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:23,403
everything you weren't.

3365
01:33:23,810 --> 01:33:26,480
I'm with you that I think
we pay too much in taxes,

3366
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:31,510
but my question would be how would we
run this country if we didn't have all

3367
01:33:33,111 --> 01:33:35,120
that money going and how
do we run it back then?

3368
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,580
It's a different country or less people.

3369
01:33:37,581 --> 01:33:38,414
There's far less,

3370
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:39,670
right?

3371
01:33:39,670 --> 01:33:39,921
I mean,

3372
01:33:39,921 --> 01:33:40,680
isn't that funny?

3373
01:33:40,680 --> 01:33:42,420
Population was growing faster.

3374
01:33:42,421 --> 01:33:42,761
I mean you,

3375
01:33:42,761 --> 01:33:46,710
you think about how we were able to
win the Second World War because you

3376
01:33:46,711 --> 01:33:47,011
mentioned,

3377
01:33:47,011 --> 01:33:47,161
you know,

3378
01:33:47,161 --> 01:33:47,300
we,

3379
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:47,440
we,

3380
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:47,641
we,

3381
01:33:47,641 --> 01:33:49,410
we kicked the crap out of Japan,

3382
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,191
Germany,

3383
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:50,960
we single handled,

3384
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:53,550
we fought wars in the
Pacific and in Europe.

3385
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:58,110
Where did all the factories come from
to produce all those planes and those

3386
01:33:58,111 --> 01:33:59,160
tanks and those bombs.

3387
01:33:59,161 --> 01:34:02,540
I mean the government didn't create
the free market built up that,

3388
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:03,480
that arsenal.

3389
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:06,110
We had the industry that
enabled us to go and,

3390
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:06,620
and,

3391
01:34:06,620 --> 01:34:07,830
and when those wars.

3392
01:34:08,190 --> 01:34:09,810
But that happened without government.

3393
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:10,830
It happened,

3394
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:11,190
you know,

3395
01:34:11,190 --> 01:34:13,650
it was in the absence of
government because government was,

3396
01:34:13,651 --> 01:34:13,930
was,

3397
01:34:13,930 --> 01:34:14,880
was caught in a cage.

3398
01:34:14,881 --> 01:34:15,870
They couldn't interfere.

3399
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:17,850
And so we created all this wealth.

3400
01:34:17,851 --> 01:34:19,260
The country ran very,

3401
01:34:19,261 --> 01:34:21,190
very well up until night.

3402
01:34:21,191 --> 01:34:22,050
The 19 twenties,

3403
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:22,953
19 thirties,

3404
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:23,221
you know,

3405
01:34:23,221 --> 01:34:24,600
we had a great country,

3406
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,610
go back and look at the 18 nineties,

3407
01:34:26,611 --> 01:34:29,880
nineties decades were
phenomenal economic growth.

3408
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:30,900
Now when people say,

3409
01:34:30,901 --> 01:34:31,291
well Peter,

3410
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:31,501
shift,

3411
01:34:31,501 --> 01:34:33,450
you want to go back to the 18 nineties,

3412
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:37,470
I don't want to go back to the
18 nineties technology clearly.

3413
01:34:37,471 --> 01:34:37,980
Right?

3414
01:34:37,980 --> 01:34:41,460
We've benefited from the technological
advancements that have taken place.

3415
01:34:41,610 --> 01:34:42,443
But if we had,

3416
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:45,540
if we had the same amount of
government today is we had back then,

3417
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:47,970
we would have much more
in the way of technology.

3418
01:34:48,120 --> 01:34:50,310
We would have a much
better standard of living.

3419
01:34:50,311 --> 01:34:51,300
We would all be.

3420
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:53,400
I think the environment
would be much better shape.

3421
01:34:53,401 --> 01:34:54,630
We'd have a cleaner environment.

3422
01:34:54,780 --> 01:34:56,800
Had we been able to progress
at the rate that we,

3423
01:34:56,950 --> 01:34:58,100
we were progressing back

3424
01:34:58,100 --> 01:34:58,340
then.

3425
01:34:58,340 --> 01:34:59,173
How do you,

3426
01:34:59,270 --> 01:35:00,810
how do you feel the Murray?

3427
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,540
Because the wealthier you are,

3428
01:35:02,541 --> 01:35:05,150
the more you can take care of
your environment because it takes,

3429
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:05,810
it takes,

3430
01:35:05,810 --> 01:35:07,220
it takes well to be able to do it.

3431
01:35:07,430 --> 01:35:10,100
And we would be a wealthier
country today if we were freer,

3432
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:13,550
if we didn't have to keep us from taking
care of our environment as wealth.

3433
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:14,450
Yeah.

3434
01:35:14,450 --> 01:35:15,080
I think if we are.

3435
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,430
You look at some of the poorest countries,

3436
01:35:16,431 --> 01:35:18,200
they don't have any money to
take care of their environment.

3437
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:21,350
Now I guess if you're so poor
that you can't do anything.

3438
01:35:21,351 --> 01:35:23,630
I mean maybe the environment was
pretty good in the stone age,

3439
01:35:23,770 --> 01:35:25,400
but when you want to be in the stone age,

3440
01:35:25,460 --> 01:35:29,120
what more gunk countries are more
economically prosperous than us.

3441
01:35:29,121 --> 01:35:29,780
And how fall?

3442
01:35:29,780 --> 01:35:30,680
There are a lot of boat.

3443
01:35:30,740 --> 01:35:32,210
There are a lot of
countries that have that.

3444
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:32,870
Well China,

3445
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:33,440
China,

3446
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:35,530
how fucked up is trying
to environment pretty bad.

3447
01:35:35,670 --> 01:35:36,500
It is pretty bad.

3448
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:37,120
But you know,

3449
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:38,480
and they're richer than us right now.

3450
01:35:38,481 --> 01:35:38,840
Right?

3451
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:40,430
Well not on a per capita basis,

3452
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:42,860
but kind of Richard the knots right now.

3453
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:47,500
Well they are doing better than us because
they don't have any regulation there.

3454
01:35:47,501 --> 01:35:48,830
Completely not knowing their environment.

3455
01:35:48,831 --> 01:35:49,250
They don't.

3456
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,160
It's not that they don't
have any regulation.

3457
01:35:51,180 --> 01:35:52,580
If they do,

3458
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,200
they actually have less than us though,

3459
01:35:54,201 --> 01:35:55,760
which is why they're producing so much.

3460
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:59,450
That's why they have fucking
no skies that are black.

3461
01:35:59,750 --> 01:36:03,250
I mean literally you drive down the street
and see half the people in masks on.

3462
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:03,440
Yeah,

3463
01:36:03,440 --> 01:36:05,510
I know and all this
stuff they're producing.

3464
01:36:05,540 --> 01:36:06,560
We get it here in America.

3465
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:10,370
We are going towards producing
over the environment.

3466
01:36:10,371 --> 01:36:10,881
You're doing that.

3467
01:36:10,881 --> 01:36:11,181
Again,

3468
01:36:11,181 --> 01:36:15,700
you immediately side towards this is the
glass half full assay either producing

3469
01:36:15,710 --> 01:36:16,101
all these things.

3470
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:16,940
They're making all this money.

3471
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:17,690
I think

3472
01:36:17,690 --> 01:36:21,860
if the Chinese weren't
obsessed with selling stuff
to Americans who can't afford

3473
01:36:21,861 --> 01:36:22,610
to pay for it,

3474
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:25,220
if they simply let their
currency go up in value,

3475
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:25,760
right,

3476
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,820
their own citizens would
be able to consume those
products and they'd have a lot

3477
01:36:28,821 --> 01:36:30,380
more wealth to take care
of their environment.

3478
01:36:30,381 --> 01:36:30,990
I think they're,

3479
01:36:30,990 --> 01:36:31,180
they're.

3480
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:34,860
They're sacrificing to keep our
economy propped up and I think that

3481
01:36:34,990 --> 01:36:35,500
are people going,

3482
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:36,530
what are they going to do for a living?

3483
01:36:36,850 --> 01:36:39,640
So many of these people are actually
making things for Americans.

3484
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:42,790
They're going to stop and just concentrate
on their economy and concentrated

3485
01:36:42,860 --> 01:36:43,090
will.

3486
01:36:43,090 --> 01:36:43,923
We'll have to go back.

3487
01:36:43,980 --> 01:36:45,140
I'll go back to world war two.

3488
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:45,510
Right?

3489
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:46,860
So during the Second World War,

3490
01:36:47,110 --> 01:36:47,943
right,

3491
01:36:48,630 --> 01:36:51,270
Americans were employed
either if you were a man,

3492
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:52,230
you were in the army,

3493
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:53,130
if you were a one.

3494
01:36:53,131 --> 01:36:56,190
I mean if you were four f you or you
were working for factor that made bombs,

3495
01:36:56,580 --> 01:36:57,120
women,

3496
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:57,391
right,

3497
01:36:57,391 --> 01:37:00,150
who were formerly housewives
for now in factories working,

3498
01:37:00,151 --> 01:37:00,781
making bombs.

3499
01:37:00,781 --> 01:37:02,520
So everybody had jobs.

3500
01:37:02,521 --> 01:37:04,110
Everybody was making stuff for the war.

3501
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:04,740
Uh,

3502
01:37:04,740 --> 01:37:05,400
meanwhile,

3503
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,410
everything that you needed
was rationed at home.

3504
01:37:07,411 --> 01:37:09,150
It was very tough being in the U,

3505
01:37:09,151 --> 01:37:12,420
s during the war because we had
nothing because everything was used,

3506
01:37:12,610 --> 01:37:12,850
uh,

3507
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:13,130
to,

3508
01:37:13,130 --> 01:37:13,980
to supply the war.

3509
01:37:14,250 --> 01:37:16,500
Now as the war was nearing an end,

3510
01:37:16,590 --> 01:37:19,380
there are a lot of economists
who were advising the president,

3511
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:20,250
your President Truman,

3512
01:37:20,730 --> 01:37:21,180
you know,

3513
01:37:21,180 --> 01:37:25,260
we can end the war because there's going
to be massive unemployment because all

3514
01:37:25,261 --> 01:37:27,240
the soldiers are going to be unemployed.

3515
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,250
The people making bombs
are going to be unemployed.

3516
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:30,930
We know what are we going to do?

3517
01:37:30,931 --> 01:37:33,090
And they were actually worried
about this is so stupid.

3518
01:37:33,091 --> 01:37:34,470
It was to have economic advisors.

3519
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:35,700
But um,

3520
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:38,850
but then the war ended and
did we have a collapse?

3521
01:37:38,851 --> 01:37:39,001
No,

3522
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:42,870
we had a boom because now all the people
that were making stuff that blew up

3523
01:37:42,900 --> 01:37:44,900
started to make things
that we actually wanted.

3524
01:37:45,100 --> 01:37:45,281
Right.

3525
01:37:45,281 --> 01:37:48,430
And so pigeons of those
industries were in fact in war,

3526
01:37:48,431 --> 01:37:48,670
right?

3527
01:37:48,670 --> 01:37:48,790
No,

3528
01:37:48,790 --> 01:37:49,210
no,

3529
01:37:49,210 --> 01:37:49,421
no.

3530
01:37:49,421 --> 01:37:50,770
It was when I would start it off.

3531
01:37:50,890 --> 01:37:51,723
No,

3532
01:37:51,740 --> 01:37:52,520
no,

3533
01:37:52,520 --> 01:37:52,950
no.

3534
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:53,230
That,

3535
01:37:53,230 --> 01:37:53,610
that,

3536
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:56,040
that we had factories
were making automobiles

3537
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
before the war.

3538
01:37:57,090 --> 01:37:57,331
Those,

3539
01:37:57,331 --> 01:37:59,190
all those factories started making tanks.

3540
01:37:59,490 --> 01:38:01,230
We were making commercial airplanes.

3541
01:38:01,231 --> 01:38:02,930
We started to make military airplanes.

3542
01:38:02,931 --> 01:38:06,030
So the factories came
for a civilian purpose.

3543
01:38:06,150 --> 01:38:08,970
And then they were retrofitted
for military purpose.

3544
01:38:09,030 --> 01:38:10,860
When the government started
ordering all this stuff,

3545
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:13,200
didn't the government
give the economy a bump?

3546
01:38:13,201 --> 01:38:15,140
I know by buying this stuff.

3547
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:16,673
No,

3548
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:16,851
no,

3549
01:38:16,851 --> 01:38:17,031
no.

3550
01:38:17,031 --> 01:38:21,050
The economy suffered because of all
those resources being squandered by the

3551
01:38:21,051 --> 01:38:21,381
government.

3552
01:38:21,381 --> 01:38:22,850
Now maybe we needed to do that.

3553
01:38:22,851 --> 01:38:24,530
Maybe we needed to get
rid of Adolf Hitler.

3554
01:38:24,620 --> 01:38:25,730
Maybe we needed to fight that.

3555
01:38:26,360 --> 01:38:27,800
But Peter Schiff.

3556
01:38:28,160 --> 01:38:28,490
Well,

3557
01:38:28,490 --> 01:38:32,750
I'm talking about the things you could
say that we're better off in the long run

3558
01:38:32,751 --> 01:38:34,130
because we got rid of Adolf Hitler.

3559
01:38:34,131 --> 01:38:35,450
But in the short run,

3560
01:38:35,570 --> 01:38:39,320
the fact that we had to divert all those
resources out of peacetime production

3561
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:41,340
to military production was,

3562
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:43,160
was a burden on the economy.

3563
01:38:43,161 --> 01:38:45,140
People suffered during the war.

3564
01:38:45,170 --> 01:38:45,660
Now they,

3565
01:38:45,660 --> 01:38:45,820
you know,

3566
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:47,420
they didn't complain because we were.

3567
01:38:47,740 --> 01:38:48,560
The war was on.

3568
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,320
But this is my point
about China right now.

3569
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:55,640
You have all these factories in China
and the Chinese are working there,

3570
01:38:56,060 --> 01:38:59,210
but the stuff that they're
making is going to America.

3571
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:03,030
It's Kinda like when we had factories
and we were making stuff for,

3572
01:39:03,060 --> 01:39:03,770
for the war,

3573
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:05,740
they're making stuff
that they can't use it,

3574
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:06,200
you know,

3575
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,460
we're using it now.

3576
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:11,210
If they let their own currency go up
because the Chinese government is actively

3577
01:39:11,211 --> 01:39:12,680
suppressing the value of their currency.

3578
01:39:12,681 --> 01:39:15,770
That's why they have 4
trillion in foreign reserves.

3579
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:19,520
That's why China is the biggest owner
of us treasuries other than the Federal

3580
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:19,700
Reserve,

3581
01:39:19,700 --> 01:39:22,760
because they keep buying them up in order
to keep their currency from going up.

3582
01:39:23,030 --> 01:39:24,800
But when they keep their
currency from going up,

3583
01:39:25,040 --> 01:39:27,560
they keep their own citizens
from buying their own products.

3584
01:39:27,860 --> 01:39:30,290
But if the Chinese let
their currency go up,

3585
01:39:30,990 --> 01:39:32,090
the the idea is that,

3586
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:32,660
well,

3587
01:39:32,660 --> 01:39:34,040
if Americans now you know,

3588
01:39:34,070 --> 01:39:35,750
can't afford to buy Chinese products,

3589
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:37,790
all those Chinese workers
are going to lose their jobs.

3590
01:39:37,940 --> 01:39:38,091
No,

3591
01:39:38,091 --> 01:39:38,570
they won't.

3592
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:40,340
Just like the soldiers didn't lose.

3593
01:39:41,030 --> 01:39:42,320
The factory's still there,

3594
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:43,920
they just made stuff for American.

3595
01:39:43,921 --> 01:39:46,490
So you've got all these
factories that Chinese people,

3596
01:39:46,491 --> 01:39:48,050
there's almost a billion people in China.

3597
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,850
They need a lot more stuff than we do.

3598
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:52,670
They need all the stuff that they're
producing in those factories.

3599
01:39:52,700 --> 01:39:54,050
They don't need us to consume it.

3600
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,540
They're perfectly happy
to consume that stuff.

3601
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:59,190
The reason they can't consume it as they
can't afford it because their currency

3602
01:39:59,191 --> 01:40:00,024
is too weak,

3603
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:04,190
but the Chinese government less their
currency go up and now all of a sudden the

3604
01:40:04,191 --> 01:40:06,260
Chinese are going to have
the jobs and the stuff.

3605
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,830
See Right now they get the jobs and we
get the stuff that's a lousy trade off

3606
01:40:09,831 --> 01:40:10,520
for them,

3607
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:13,040
but it's good for us because we get
stuff without having to work for it.

3608
01:40:13,220 --> 01:40:14,720
They get to work without
any of this stuff.

3609
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,350
But that's what you want when you.

3610
01:40:16,351 --> 01:40:17,270
When you have a job,

3611
01:40:17,330 --> 01:40:18,560
you don't want the job,

3612
01:40:18,561 --> 01:40:20,660
you want the stuff that you
can buy with your paycheck.

3613
01:40:20,780 --> 01:40:21,650
Nobody works.

3614
01:40:21,950 --> 01:40:22,161
You know?

3615
01:40:22,161 --> 01:40:24,110
Most people don't work
because they enjoy work.

3616
01:40:24,170 --> 01:40:24,470
They,

3617
01:40:24,470 --> 01:40:24,760
they,

3618
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:25,970
they look forward to quitting time.

3619
01:40:25,971 --> 01:40:27,050
They look forward to the weekend,

3620
01:40:27,230 --> 01:40:28,430
they want to spend the money,

3621
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:31,730
and right now the Chinese aren't able to
spend it because we're spending it for

3622
01:40:31,731 --> 01:40:32,210
him.

3623
01:40:32,210 --> 01:40:32,451
Wait,

3624
01:40:32,451 --> 01:40:33,560
but how do you stop this?

3625
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,910
Look at these images.

3626
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:35,660
What images?

3627
01:40:35,660 --> 01:40:37,610
These images of pollution in China,

3628
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:38,990
how would you stop that?

3629
01:40:38,991 --> 01:40:42,560
Because obviously they have
less regulation than us
and this is the result of

3630
01:40:42,561 --> 01:40:42,681
it.

3631
01:40:42,681 --> 01:40:43,550
They have slaves.

3632
01:40:44,630 --> 01:40:45,470
Pennies an hour.

3633
01:40:45,590 --> 01:40:47,360
They don't have of the environment.

3634
01:40:47,361 --> 01:40:48,194
Might as well be slaves.

3635
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:48,301
Oh,

3636
01:40:48,301 --> 01:40:50,060
they're not in these factories.

3637
01:40:50,061 --> 01:40:50,600
What is it called?

3638
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:51,111
Foxconn.

3639
01:40:51,111 --> 01:40:51,944
Foxconn.

3640
01:40:52,090 --> 01:40:52,990
I had a woman on my,

3641
01:40:53,230 --> 01:40:53,951
I forget her name,

3642
01:40:53,951 --> 01:40:57,520
she was Chinese American and she lived
with a Chinese peasants for wild.

3643
01:40:57,521 --> 01:41:00,400
She wrote a book and I asked her,

3644
01:41:00,401 --> 01:41:00,611
I said,

3645
01:41:00,611 --> 01:41:00,731
look,

3646
01:41:00,731 --> 01:41:00,851
you know,

3647
01:41:00,851 --> 01:41:02,260
because these are all these young girls.

3648
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,380
It was about Chinese women and they would
leave the farms and they would go and

3649
01:41:05,381 --> 01:41:09,220
live in cities and work at
work in these factories.

3650
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:10,121
And I asked her,

3651
01:41:10,121 --> 01:41:10,640
you know,

3652
01:41:10,640 --> 01:41:10,861
you know,

3653
01:41:10,861 --> 01:41:11,290
and they're,

3654
01:41:11,290 --> 01:41:12,190
they're very happy.

3655
01:41:12,191 --> 01:41:13,420
Their lives are much better.

3656
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:13,860
Uh,

3657
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:14,110
you know,

3658
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:14,261
they're,

3659
01:41:14,261 --> 01:41:14,471
they're,

3660
01:41:14,471 --> 01:41:15,251
they're out on their own.

3661
01:41:15,251 --> 01:41:16,510
They were able to leave their home.

3662
01:41:17,140 --> 01:41:17,530
They are,

3663
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:17,960
they aren't,

3664
01:41:17,960 --> 01:41:18,120
they,

3665
01:41:18,120 --> 01:41:20,020
the companies are taking
care of their room and board.

3666
01:41:20,021 --> 01:41:20,890
They have plenty of spending.

3667
01:41:20,891 --> 01:41:21,050
My,

3668
01:41:21,050 --> 01:41:21,731
they have no debt.

3669
01:41:21,731 --> 01:41:22,301
They have fun.

3670
01:41:22,301 --> 01:41:23,000
They go out.

3671
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,561
I mean they're,

3672
01:41:23,561 --> 01:41:24,940
they're actually enjoying their lives.

3673
01:41:24,941 --> 01:41:25,100
I mean,

3674
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:25,390
and,

3675
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:25,650
and,

3676
01:41:25,650 --> 01:41:25,901
and,

3677
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:26,111
and,

3678
01:41:26,111 --> 01:41:27,910
and they're now young Americans.

3679
01:41:27,911 --> 01:41:28,091
I mean,

3680
01:41:28,091 --> 01:41:28,661
there are two broke.

3681
01:41:28,661 --> 01:41:29,920
They're living in their
parents' basements.

3682
01:41:29,921 --> 01:41:31,740
They can't get out from
under their college debt

3683
01:41:33,230 --> 01:41:34,160
stories like this,

3684
01:41:34,161 --> 01:41:35,600
but there's not a bunch of slaves.

3685
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:36,770
And you understand,

3686
01:41:36,771 --> 01:41:38,690
you're a very smart guy and you
understand what you're doing here.

3687
01:41:38,691 --> 01:41:42,560
You're flavoring this argument by these
anecdotal stories about this person is

3688
01:41:42,561 --> 01:41:43,460
so much happier now.

3689
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:46,400
And I knew a lady who knew the
peasants and peasants are happy.

3690
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:46,721
You know,

3691
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:48,680
that's what rich people saying when
they don't have to live in China.

3692
01:41:48,740 --> 01:41:49,573
I look,

3693
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,230
look at that fucking sky over there.

3694
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:54,030
She uses and you know that.

3695
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:57,350
And when the Chinese cut the
cord from the United States,

3696
01:41:57,560 --> 01:41:59,510
when they stopped subsidizing our economy,

3697
01:41:59,750 --> 01:42:01,220
when they let their currency go up,

3698
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:05,060
they will be able to deal
with air pollution and
they're also going to enjoy a

3699
01:42:05,061 --> 01:42:06,460
greater benefit for their efforts.

3700
01:42:06,461 --> 01:42:07,294
But nobody.

3701
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,270
But nobody puts it.

3702
01:42:08,271 --> 01:42:11,720
If somebody in China right
moves from a form into,

3703
01:42:11,721 --> 01:42:12,021
into,

3704
01:42:12,021 --> 01:42:13,940
into a city and gets a job at a factory,

3705
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:15,500
nobody is forcing them to do that.

3706
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:18,830
They wouldn't do that if they're live
didn't improve as a result of doing it.

3707
01:42:19,210 --> 01:42:22,670
I'm now their lives would be a lot
better if the government didn't suppress

3708
01:42:22,671 --> 01:42:23,390
their currency,

3709
01:42:23,390 --> 01:42:25,490
but America's lives would be a lot worse.

3710
01:42:25,491 --> 01:42:27,440
And unfortunately that
is what's going to come.

3711
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:27,831
Right.

3712
01:42:27,831 --> 01:42:30,050
Because we are living right know,

3713
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:31,340
because of all the,

3714
01:42:31,410 --> 01:42:31,560
all,

3715
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:32,630
all of their production.

3716
01:42:32,750 --> 01:42:33,170
Right?

3717
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:35,690
And so imagine what it
would be like in America,

3718
01:42:35,990 --> 01:42:36,201
right?

3719
01:42:36,201 --> 01:42:36,951
If we couldn't,

3720
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:40,010
if we could only consume the things
that our own factories could produce.

3721
01:42:40,490 --> 01:42:40,860
So what,

3722
01:42:40,860 --> 01:42:41,270
you know,

3723
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:41,690
what if,

3724
01:42:41,690 --> 01:42:44,630
what if Walmart only has stuff
made in America on the shelves?

3725
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:45,583
I mean,

3726
01:42:46,040 --> 01:42:46,873
what could you buy?

3727
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:48,290
Not much.

3728
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:49,730
Not as much.

3729
01:42:49,790 --> 01:42:49,941
Well,

3730
01:42:49,941 --> 01:42:50,181
no,

3731
01:42:50,181 --> 01:42:50,780
barely you.

3732
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:50,961
I mean,

3733
01:42:50,961 --> 01:42:52,970
you certainly couldn't buy
anything that plugs in,

3734
01:42:53,150 --> 01:42:53,301
right?

3735
01:42:53,301 --> 01:42:54,280
You couldn't buy anything that,

3736
01:42:54,470 --> 01:42:57,320
that was electronic or they've
had an on off switch or something,

3737
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,470
but you couldn't buy much in the way of,

3738
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,130
of furniture or clothing.

3739
01:43:01,350 --> 01:43:04,220
Assume that just like the
regular market itself.

3740
01:43:04,221 --> 01:43:06,560
Like you feel like if government
regulation stepped out,

3741
01:43:06,561 --> 01:43:07,730
if we had less imports,

3742
01:43:07,970 --> 01:43:09,710
we would pick up the slack with American.

3743
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:13,910
Well instruction and innovation
and by designing of new materials.

3744
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:14,490
Well,

3745
01:43:14,490 --> 01:43:14,940
not with,

3746
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:17,190
not with the regulatory
and tax system we have now.

3747
01:43:17,191 --> 01:43:19,360
That's why the businesses
left because you know,

3748
01:43:19,450 --> 01:43:19,650
and,

3749
01:43:19,650 --> 01:43:22,470
and so what would happen is yes we
would have to produce it ourselves,

3750
01:43:22,680 --> 01:43:24,900
but we would produce a
lot less of it at a much,

3751
01:43:24,901 --> 01:43:27,510
much higher costs because
manufacturing be impeded by governor.

3752
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:28,860
It'd be much more expensive.

3753
01:43:28,861 --> 01:43:29,420
And so,

3754
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:29,760
you know,

3755
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:30,050
you know,

3756
01:43:30,050 --> 01:43:31,530
you wouldn't have middle class people,

3757
01:43:31,531 --> 01:43:31,760
you know,

3758
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:32,370
you know,

3759
01:43:32,370 --> 01:43:33,660
walking out of Walmart with,

3760
01:43:33,720 --> 01:43:34,100
you know,

3761
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:34,700
with a,

3762
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:35,820
with the shopping cart

3763
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:36,430
slum,

3764
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:38,020
but you can't say things like,

3765
01:43:38,021 --> 01:43:41,290
the reason why people go from farms to
cities is because they make a choice.

3766
01:43:41,291 --> 01:43:42,124
So that's a good show.

3767
01:43:42,130 --> 01:43:43,930
And they made a choice because
it's better for them that yes,

3768
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,040
these people are fucked.

3769
01:43:45,220 --> 01:43:46,150
Like they're in a terrible,

3770
01:43:46,151 --> 01:43:46,541
terrible,

3771
01:43:46,541 --> 01:43:50,980
terrible situation and horrible spot
on earth economic depression beyond,

3772
01:43:51,530 --> 01:43:52,080
for the average

3773
01:43:52,080 --> 01:43:52,230
user.

3774
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:52,910
That is that.

3775
01:43:52,910 --> 01:43:53,660
But I mean,

3776
01:43:53,660 --> 01:43:53,841
the,

3777
01:43:53,841 --> 01:43:54,051
the,

3778
01:43:54,051 --> 01:43:54,741
the human kid,

3779
01:43:54,741 --> 01:43:55,060
that's,

3780
01:43:55,060 --> 01:43:55,460
you know,

3781
01:43:55,460 --> 01:43:56,390
the human condition,

3782
01:43:56,391 --> 01:43:56,710
you know,

3783
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:57,230
you don't,

3784
01:43:57,230 --> 01:43:58,560
you don't have anything when you know,

3785
01:43:58,580 --> 01:43:59,480
when you first start out,

3786
01:43:59,481 --> 01:43:59,710
right?

3787
01:43:59,710 --> 01:44:01,910
You've got to improve your life.

3788
01:44:01,911 --> 01:44:05,450
You make decisions that that's why
what I was at occupy Wall Street,

3789
01:44:05,451 --> 01:44:08,990
this decision that they're making allows
them to make $5 a week and jump off

3790
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:09,590
buildings.

3791
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:10,460
That decision,

3792
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:10,730
no,

3793
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:11,563
but that.

3794
01:44:11,590 --> 01:44:13,880
But that's a better opportunity
than the one that they've,

3795
01:44:14,090 --> 01:44:14,923
that they gave up.

3796
01:44:15,710 --> 01:44:16,490
They both suck.

3797
01:44:16,490 --> 01:44:18,770
But this idea that your anecdotal story,

3798
01:44:18,771 --> 01:44:21,620
but I had a friend who she lived
with and they're all happy.

3799
01:44:21,680 --> 01:44:23,000
What are the over in America?

3800
01:44:23,001 --> 01:44:25,750
People just don't make any money
or a lot of governments on your.

3801
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:26,691
Forget about China.

3802
01:44:26,691 --> 01:44:28,970
There are people here in America
to a good example though,

3803
01:44:28,971 --> 01:44:29,490
isn't it?

3804
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:32,270
Let me bring this back to home so I
don't have to talk about an anecdote.

3805
01:44:32,270 --> 01:44:32,900
So,

3806
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,140
uh,

3807
01:44:33,140 --> 01:44:34,310
there's a big movement now.

3808
01:44:34,311 --> 01:44:37,130
A lot of people are saying that people
that work in the fast food industry or

3809
01:44:37,131 --> 01:44:39,290
people that work at Walmart
should be paid more money.

3810
01:44:39,291 --> 01:44:41,060
They shouldn't be paid the minimum wage.

3811
01:44:41,061 --> 01:44:42,530
And of course there
should be no minimum wage.

3812
01:44:42,700 --> 01:44:43,550
The minimum wage is,

3813
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:44,391
does a lot of harm.

3814
01:44:44,391 --> 01:44:46,370
It's one of the stupidest
laws that we've got a.

3815
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:47,390
But there are people say,

3816
01:44:47,391 --> 01:44:47,810
look,

3817
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:48,380
they should,

3818
01:44:48,380 --> 01:44:49,610
we should pay pay.

3819
01:44:49,611 --> 01:44:51,020
The more they're being exploited,

3820
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:51,400
right?

3821
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:53,210
They should get paid $15 an hour,

3822
01:44:53,211 --> 01:44:54,044
whatever it is.

3823
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:57,500
But if somebody has a job at
Walmart and Walmart's pain,

3824
01:44:57,510 --> 01:44:57,760
um,

3825
01:44:57,760 --> 01:44:58,250
you know,

3826
01:44:58,250 --> 01:44:58,760
8:50,

3827
01:44:58,760 --> 01:44:59,151
an hour,

3828
01:44:59,151 --> 01:44:59,841
$9 an hour,

3829
01:44:59,841 --> 01:45:00,291
whatever it is.

3830
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:01,250
And they took that job,

3831
01:45:01,820 --> 01:45:05,270
they took that job because Walmart offered
them a better deal than anybody else

3832
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:06,200
because if somebody's off,

3833
01:45:06,320 --> 01:45:08,780
I'll offer them a better deal where
they would have taken that job instead.

3834
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:12,830
So the fact that somebody voluntarily
accepted a job at a given rate of pay

3835
01:45:13,090 --> 01:45:14,390
means that they're not being exploited.

3836
01:45:14,450 --> 01:45:16,130
Nobody volunteers to be exploited.

3837
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:18,020
If that's the best job you can get,

3838
01:45:18,021 --> 01:45:19,910
then you should be
thankful that Walmart is.

3839
01:45:19,911 --> 01:45:21,950
They're offering it because
they outbid everybody else.

3840
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:24,650
They're offering you a better deal
than you can get someplace else.

3841
01:45:24,651 --> 01:45:24,770
Well,

3842
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:29,510
the idea is to keep away from some
sort of a Fox con type scenario.

3843
01:45:29,511 --> 01:45:33,410
We're one group has a gigantic amount of
money and they take advantage of these

3844
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:34,580
incredibly poor people,

3845
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:36,260
but how are they nominate a tiny,

3846
01:45:36,261 --> 01:45:36,651
tiny,

3847
01:45:36,651 --> 01:45:40,100
tiny amount of money and forcing them
to work ungodly hours to the point where

3848
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:43,400
they have to put nets all around
their building right there.

3849
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:43,610
No,

3850
01:45:43,610 --> 01:45:44,210
but if,

3851
01:45:44,210 --> 01:45:45,043
if I,

3852
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:48,170
if I do not agree that
it's a strange situation,

3853
01:45:48,171 --> 01:45:53,171
if I advertise a job at a particular
rate of pay and somebody shows up,

3854
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:54,710
you know when Walmart runs an ad,

3855
01:45:55,010 --> 01:45:55,531
they get like,

3856
01:45:55,531 --> 01:45:55,820
I don't know,

3857
01:45:55,820 --> 01:45:57,320
50 applicants per position.

3858
01:45:57,560 --> 01:46:00,140
So obviously they're not trying.

3859
01:46:00,141 --> 01:46:01,280
They're not exploiting people.

3860
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:01,830
I mean,

3861
01:46:01,830 --> 01:46:02,663
you know,

3862
01:46:02,890 --> 01:46:04,640
50 people wouldn't apply for the job.

3863
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:05,583
You know,

3864
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,530
Walmart was out there and getting people
and they had people with guns standing

3865
01:46:09,531 --> 01:46:12,290
around the workers making sure that
they didn't leave and then you'd have a

3866
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:12,860
point,

3867
01:46:12,860 --> 01:46:15,470
but nobody is forcing
anybody to take these jobs.

3868
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:17,450
They're taking them because
it's the best job they can get.

3869
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:21,110
And why is that and why is Walmart bad
for offering somebody the best job they

3870
01:46:21,111 --> 01:46:21,650
can get?

3871
01:46:21,650 --> 01:46:21,771
Now?

3872
01:46:21,771 --> 01:46:22,461
Some people will say,

3873
01:46:22,461 --> 01:46:22,581
well,

3874
01:46:22,581 --> 01:46:23,810
they should offer even more money.

3875
01:46:23,811 --> 01:46:25,610
Why the worker not worth it?

3876
01:46:25,611 --> 01:46:26,930
They don't have enough productivity.

3877
01:46:26,931 --> 01:46:28,010
They don't have enough skills.

3878
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:29,450
And you do a lot of people,

3879
01:46:29,480 --> 01:46:31,010
and this is what I did
with occupy Wall Street,

3880
01:46:31,011 --> 01:46:34,490
but a lot of people who want to criticize
people who hire people and they said,

3881
01:46:34,491 --> 01:46:34,611
look,

3882
01:46:34,611 --> 01:46:35,930
you don't pay your workers enough money.

3883
01:46:36,230 --> 01:46:37,340
They don't have any employees.

3884
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:38,620
They don't pay their workers anything.

3885
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:38,961
I said,

3886
01:46:38,961 --> 01:46:39,111
look,

3887
01:46:39,111 --> 01:46:41,240
you don't think the guy at
Walmart is making enough money.

3888
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:42,830
Then you hire them and pay them more.

3889
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:44,540
So how to sound like Foxconn happen.

3890
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:48,110
How do you have a gigantic business
and makes billions of dollars and pays

3891
01:46:48,111 --> 01:46:49,380
people pennies and met,

3892
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,880
makes them work 16 hours a day.

3893
01:46:51,240 --> 01:46:54,040
Takes advantage of these people that
don't have any other opportunity.

3894
01:46:54,130 --> 01:46:56,220
Makes anybody work six hours a day.

3895
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:56,940
They don't have to.

3896
01:46:56,940 --> 01:46:58,140
Who are you talking about?

3897
01:46:58,141 --> 01:46:58,591
Foxconn.

3898
01:46:58,591 --> 01:47:00,270
People don't have ungodly
hours that they work.

3899
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:01,830
I don't know what their hours are,

3900
01:47:01,831 --> 01:47:04,920
but there no one's forced to work the
hours they choose to work the hours that I

3901
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:05,970
don't think they have a lot of choice.

3902
01:47:05,971 --> 01:47:07,290
I think if we want to keep their job,

3903
01:47:07,291 --> 01:47:08,210
they have to do it right.

3904
01:47:08,220 --> 01:47:11,490
If they want to keep their job and they
must like it and there's many other

3905
01:47:11,491 --> 01:47:12,324
opportunities,

3906
01:47:12,570 --> 01:47:14,490
but then they shouldn't
be glad they got that one.

3907
01:47:14,610 --> 01:47:15,510
Oh Wow.

3908
01:47:15,530 --> 01:47:17,880
But are they should be glad that
someone's paying them pennies.

3909
01:47:17,940 --> 01:47:18,200
Well,

3910
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:22,440
if that's this big evil corporation,

3911
01:47:22,441 --> 01:47:23,580
this is the idea that people have.

3912
01:47:23,710 --> 01:47:23,950
Okay,

3913
01:47:23,950 --> 01:47:25,040
but what does that company,

3914
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:26,400
okay?

3915
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,211
What did that quote come to those?

3916
01:47:27,211 --> 01:47:27,410
And they're,

3917
01:47:27,410 --> 01:47:29,070
they're doing what they'd
done for thousands of years,

3918
01:47:29,071 --> 01:47:31,950
but obviously the company
is an improvement over what
they were doing or they

3919
01:47:31,951 --> 01:47:33,210
wouldn't choose to work there.

3920
01:47:33,390 --> 01:47:35,250
And what happens is you
can't make that leap,

3921
01:47:35,251 --> 01:47:38,640
but unless you're in that environment
and you understand those people,

3922
01:47:38,641 --> 01:47:43,590
and I'm assuming that people are rational
and I don't want a super impose my

3923
01:47:43,591 --> 01:47:44,910
judgment over somebody else's.

3924
01:47:45,120 --> 01:47:46,320
If somebody makes a decision,

3925
01:47:46,321 --> 01:47:46,591
again,

3926
01:47:46,591 --> 01:47:48,630
just like you want to
choose to smoke marijuana,

3927
01:47:48,760 --> 01:47:48,970
right?

3928
01:47:48,970 --> 01:47:49,580
Fun.

3929
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:50,071
Bringing that up,

3930
01:47:50,071 --> 01:47:50,291
man.

3931
01:47:50,291 --> 01:47:50,660
You know what you mean?

3932
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:51,140
Nervous.

3933
01:47:51,140 --> 01:47:51,360
No,

3934
01:47:51,360 --> 01:47:53,190
because you want to make
a choice and I agree.

3935
01:47:53,191 --> 01:47:54,180
You should have that choice.

3936
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:54,320
Well,

3937
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:55,940
I don't drink coffee apps.

3938
01:47:56,210 --> 01:47:57,840
I don't want to make things I want to do.

3939
01:47:57,841 --> 01:47:58,430
I don't want them to,

3940
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:01,710
I don't wanna I don't want
to make caffeine illegal
because that's not because

3941
01:48:01,711 --> 01:48:04,860
marijuana is illegal in California.

3942
01:48:04,980 --> 01:48:06,300
Well only it's only medical.

3943
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:07,970
You Got A.

3944
01:48:07,970 --> 01:48:08,140
Yeah.

3945
01:48:08,140 --> 01:48:08,880
Well,

3946
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,260
but in some places even that,

3947
01:48:10,261 --> 01:48:10,711
but there's other.

3948
01:48:10,711 --> 01:48:10,921
Look,

3949
01:48:10,921 --> 01:48:11,341
I think they,

3950
01:48:11,341 --> 01:48:12,570
I think cocaine should be legal.

3951
01:48:12,571 --> 01:48:13,800
I think heroin should be legal,

3952
01:48:13,940 --> 01:48:14,280
right?

3953
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,410
That doesn't mean I think people
should go out and shoot up.

3954
01:48:16,590 --> 01:48:16,880
Right.

3955
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:17,110
But,

3956
01:48:17,110 --> 01:48:20,520
but I recognize all the damage
that the government does.

3957
01:48:20,521 --> 01:48:21,970
Not only is it infringement on,

3958
01:48:22,030 --> 01:48:22,280
on,

3959
01:48:22,280 --> 01:48:22,801
on liberty,

3960
01:48:22,801 --> 01:48:25,800
I think people should be able to choose
to make a bad decision if that's what

3961
01:48:25,801 --> 01:48:26,634
they want to do

3962
01:48:27,840 --> 01:48:28,020
it.

3963
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:28,620
Colorado,

3964
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:29,453
North Korea,

3965
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:29,940
alright,

3966
01:48:29,940 --> 01:48:31,350
well then they got
something right over there.

3967
01:48:31,351 --> 01:48:31,531
But,

3968
01:48:31,531 --> 01:48:32,364
you know,

3969
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:34,440
but that doesn't my arguments
right out the window,

3970
01:48:34,770 --> 01:48:35,041
but it's,

3971
01:48:35,041 --> 01:48:35,550
you know,

3972
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,750
but I'm not that.

3973
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:37,111
I forgot.

3974
01:48:37,111 --> 01:48:37,910
I forgot what I was.

3975
01:48:37,910 --> 01:48:38,190
Yeah.

3976
01:48:38,190 --> 01:48:38,911
So the government,

3977
01:48:38,911 --> 01:48:40,110
but the government not only,

3978
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:40,430
uh,

3979
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:40,710
you know,

3980
01:48:40,710 --> 01:48:41,221
does,

3981
01:48:41,221 --> 01:48:41,640
uh,

3982
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,340
does that infringe upon
your liberties and freedoms,

3983
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:46,640
but it actually creates a lot of problems.

3984
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:48,660
The biggest problems in
America is not drugs,

3985
01:48:48,661 --> 01:48:49,590
but the war on drugs.

3986
01:48:49,591 --> 01:48:49,771
Right.

3987
01:48:49,771 --> 01:48:50,180
That's the,

3988
01:48:50,180 --> 01:48:52,920
that's what does a lot much
more harm to the economy.

3989
01:48:52,921 --> 01:48:53,400
In fact,

3990
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:57,540
I actually think that more people do
drugs because they're illegal than if they

3991
01:48:57,541 --> 01:48:57,840
were,

3992
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:58,381
they'd probably,

3993
01:48:58,381 --> 01:48:58,951
if they were legal,

3994
01:48:58,951 --> 01:49:01,710
but certainly they would be
safer if they were illegal.

3995
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:03,480
We wouldn't be dealing with criminals,

3996
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:03,961
you know,

3997
01:49:03,961 --> 01:49:08,961
I'd rather buy drugs from accompany a
pharmaceutical company then from a gang in

3998
01:49:09,001 --> 01:49:10,020
south central La.

3999
01:49:10,140 --> 01:49:10,351
I mean,

4000
01:49:10,351 --> 01:49:11,290
I think they're,

4001
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:15,120
they're going to be more concerned about
the brand and the and the purity of

4002
01:49:15,121 --> 01:49:17,910
their products than the crips
or the bloods or wherever.

4003
01:49:17,930 --> 01:49:18,310
You know,

4004
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:19,010
you have to go to,

4005
01:49:19,010 --> 01:49:20,820
to buy your heroin down here.

4006
01:49:21,460 --> 01:49:21,810
So,

4007
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:22,280
you know,

4008
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,520
I and I and what I,

4009
01:49:23,521 --> 01:49:24,480
Johnson and Johnson,

4010
01:49:24,481 --> 01:49:25,590
we have the best heroin.

4011
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:25,741
Well,

4012
01:49:25,741 --> 01:49:26,320
whatever,

4013
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:27,153
I don't.

4014
01:49:27,280 --> 01:49:28,380
Whatever I don't want.

4015
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:28,980
Look nobody,

4016
01:49:28,980 --> 01:49:29,400
nobody.

4017
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:30,031
People here,

4018
01:49:30,031 --> 01:49:30,211
you know,

4019
01:49:30,211 --> 01:49:31,320
you get your car ripped off,

4020
01:49:31,321 --> 01:49:33,750
someone steals your radio or
they break into your house.

4021
01:49:33,751 --> 01:49:33,931
Why?

4022
01:49:33,931 --> 01:49:35,760
Because they need money
to buy illegal drugs.

4023
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:36,930
If drugs were free,

4024
01:49:36,931 --> 01:49:38,100
there'd be a lot less expensive.

4025
01:49:38,220 --> 01:49:39,700
You wouldn't have to steal to buy it.

4026
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:39,901
Right?

4027
01:49:39,901 --> 01:49:40,510
You can buy it,

4028
01:49:40,510 --> 01:49:40,890
you know.

4029
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:43,290
So now you have all kinds of victims,

4030
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,010
meaning drugs.

4031
01:49:44,010 --> 01:49:46,720
When you say free meaning legal drugs,

4032
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:47,950
if drugs were legal,

4033
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,570
they would be a lot less expensive.

4034
01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:50,050
Right?

4035
01:49:50,050 --> 01:49:53,830
And so drug addicts wouldn't have to
commit crimes to support their habit.

4036
01:49:53,860 --> 01:49:54,011
Well,

4037
01:49:54,011 --> 01:49:54,740
this is subsided

4038
01:49:54,740 --> 01:49:55,610
by the prohibition,

4039
01:49:55,660 --> 01:49:55,911
right?

4040
01:49:55,911 --> 01:49:59,660
It's very obvious that the prohibition
propped up sorts of illegal activities

4041
01:49:59,661 --> 01:50:00,650
that Al Capone,

4042
01:50:01,210 --> 01:50:01,631
of course.

4043
01:50:01,631 --> 01:50:02,770
I mean that's where it started,

4044
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:03,370
but.

4045
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:04,203
But you've got.

4046
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:05,050
And in fact,

4047
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,030
if you know the,

4048
01:50:06,090 --> 01:50:06,281
the,

4049
01:50:06,281 --> 01:50:10,930
the people who would be most
against legalizing drugs
is organized crime because

4050
01:50:10,931 --> 01:50:12,310
that takes away all their money.

4051
01:50:12,340 --> 01:50:12,491
Well,

4052
01:50:12,491 --> 01:50:13,750
here's their argument against that.

4053
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:17,410
Do you know the situation in Florida
where Florida for the longest time didn't

4054
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:18,790
have a database?

4055
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:23,080
They had these things called
pain management centers
where people would go in

4056
01:50:23,260 --> 01:50:24,093
and they would say,

4057
01:50:24,340 --> 01:50:24,521
oh,

4058
01:50:24,521 --> 01:50:25,240
my head hurts.

4059
01:50:25,240 --> 01:50:25,371
Oh,

4060
01:50:25,371 --> 01:50:25,781
okay.

4061
01:50:25,781 --> 01:50:26,740
We'll go right next door.

4062
01:50:26,741 --> 01:50:28,150
I'll write you up some oxycontin.

4063
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:29,860
And they would go to in the same facility,

4064
01:50:29,861 --> 01:50:33,400
they'd go to a doctor and then to the
pharmacist that only prescribed pain

4065
01:50:33,401 --> 01:50:33,850
pills.

4066
01:50:33,850 --> 01:50:34,601
And because of that,

4067
01:50:34,601 --> 01:50:37,750
they have this massive amount of people
that are addicted to Oxycontin is in

4068
01:50:37,751 --> 01:50:38,141
Florida.

4069
01:50:38,141 --> 01:50:38,660
In fact,

4070
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:42,580
there's an area of Florida leading up
to the northern states that's called the

4071
01:50:42,581 --> 01:50:43,870
oxycontin express.

4072
01:50:44,020 --> 01:50:47,740
Vanguard actually did a show in it called
the oxycontin express and we had them

4073
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:49,540
on the podcast and
talked about it and it's,

4074
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:54,750
there's 90 percent of all oxycontin in
the country is prescribed in Florida.

4075
01:50:56,170 --> 01:50:56,700
I mean,

4076
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:57,580
and why is that?

4077
01:50:57,610 --> 01:50:58,750
It's because of deregulation.

4078
01:50:58,751 --> 01:51:02,200
It's because of a lack of regulation is
because they weren't forced to have a

4079
01:51:02,201 --> 01:51:06,340
database where they made sure that people
weren't doing something unethical and

4080
01:51:06,341 --> 01:51:08,590
just prescribing pain
pills all willy nilly.

4081
01:51:08,770 --> 01:51:10,240
And that kind of goes against your theory.

4082
01:51:10,550 --> 01:51:10,881
Well,

4083
01:51:10,881 --> 01:51:12,000
I don't know that it goes against.

4084
01:51:12,001 --> 01:51:12,360
So I got,

4085
01:51:12,360 --> 01:51:15,140
I am not really familiar with it because
I'm hearing about it for the first time

4086
01:51:15,141 --> 01:51:15,561
from you.

4087
01:51:15,561 --> 01:51:16,071
So I don't know,

4088
01:51:16,071 --> 01:51:19,100
but I know it's not that there was no
regulation down there because obviously

4089
01:51:19,101 --> 01:51:19,970
these are doctors.

4090
01:51:19,971 --> 01:51:21,200
If they're writing prescriptions,

4091
01:51:21,410 --> 01:51:21,621
uh,

4092
01:51:21,621 --> 01:51:22,840
there is a lot of regulation,

4093
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:23,250
you know,

4094
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:24,950
involved in that process.

4095
01:51:25,160 --> 01:51:27,740
So I'm not familiar with
it to really comment on it.

4096
01:51:27,950 --> 01:51:28,280
Well,

4097
01:51:28,280 --> 01:51:28,700
okay,

4098
01:51:28,700 --> 01:51:30,890
well then then that's unfair
to try to bring it up to you,

4099
01:51:30,891 --> 01:51:31,180
but that,

4100
01:51:31,180 --> 01:51:35,000
that is a huge issue and it's an issue
in Florida because Florida is such a

4101
01:51:35,010 --> 01:51:35,600
fucking.

4102
01:51:35,600 --> 01:51:38,550
But I do believe that the
war on drugs is destroyed.

4103
01:51:38,551 --> 01:51:39,301
Our inner cities.

4104
01:51:39,301 --> 01:51:41,070
It's corrupted police forces.

4105
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:43,290
It's screwed up a police,

4106
01:51:43,291 --> 01:51:43,381
uh,

4107
01:51:43,381 --> 01:51:47,250
south of the border and now you have a
situation to where your inner city kid

4108
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:51,000
and you know you've got minimum wage laws
and you've got occupational licensing

4109
01:51:51,001 --> 01:51:54,930
laws that make it almost impossible for
young kid to get a legitimate job yet

4110
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,920
you've got the gang
bangers flashing around,

4111
01:51:56,921 --> 01:51:57,120
you know,

4112
01:51:57,120 --> 01:51:57,990
a wad of cash.

4113
01:51:58,110 --> 01:51:58,530
Hey,

4114
01:51:58,530 --> 01:51:59,370
just deal drugs.

4115
01:51:59,371 --> 01:52:00,204
You can make a lot of money.

4116
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:05,120
You think that minimum wage and the
difficulty in getting licensed for certain

4117
01:52:05,121 --> 01:52:07,100
positions are what's keeping people down?

4118
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:07,790
Of course,

4119
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:08,511
minimum wages.

4120
01:52:08,511 --> 01:52:09,260
Keeping people down.

4121
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:09,830
Absolutely.

4122
01:52:09,830 --> 01:52:10,360
How has that,

4123
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:10,990
how has that?

4124
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:11,141
Well,

4125
01:52:11,141 --> 01:52:11,974
because remember,

4126
01:52:12,270 --> 01:52:12,970
you know,

4127
01:52:12,970 --> 01:52:13,571
when you're young,

4128
01:52:13,571 --> 01:52:14,470
when you're a teenager,

4129
01:52:14,530 --> 01:52:14,741
right?

4130
01:52:14,741 --> 01:52:15,730
You don't have a lot of skills.

4131
01:52:15,731 --> 01:52:15,881
I mean,

4132
01:52:15,881 --> 01:52:16,360
you really,

4133
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,040
you might've never had been had a job.

4134
01:52:18,041 --> 01:52:18,600
I mean,

4135
01:52:18,600 --> 01:52:21,970
and what's more important in getting
a job is not necessarily the paycheck.

4136
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:22,930
That's kind of secondary.

4137
01:52:22,931 --> 01:52:25,060
It's what you learn on the job.

4138
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:25,981
And you know,

4139
01:52:25,981 --> 01:52:28,000
when I had my first jobs
and I was working on me,

4140
01:52:28,210 --> 01:52:28,391
you know,

4141
01:52:28,391 --> 01:52:31,840
you're living at home talking about
outside of high school or in high school,

4142
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:34,680
the all that's important is the
money's the only thing that's.

4143
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:34,940
No,

4144
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:35,070
no,

4145
01:52:35,070 --> 01:52:35,320
no.

4146
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:36,600
I mean when we,

4147
01:52:36,910 --> 01:52:37,631
when you are,

4148
01:52:37,631 --> 01:52:37,841
look,

4149
01:52:37,841 --> 01:52:38,710
you want the money,

4150
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:38,921
right?

4151
01:52:38,921 --> 01:52:40,150
Because you want money for,

4152
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,820
to take a girl out on a date
or maybe you need gas money,

4153
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:43,180
right?

4154
01:52:43,180 --> 01:52:44,260
But you don't need rent money.

4155
01:52:44,261 --> 01:52:45,050
You're living at home.

4156
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:45,950
You don't need food.

4157
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:46,200
Your,

4158
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,020
your overhead is taking care of.

4159
01:52:48,290 --> 01:52:53,290
The real benefit is acquiring skills on
the job training that will enable you to

4160
01:52:54,561 --> 01:52:58,480
earn more money as you get older and
take on more responsibility in these

4161
01:52:58,481 --> 01:52:58,911
skills.

4162
01:52:58,911 --> 01:53:00,770
When you're working at a burger joint,

4163
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:01,160
what am I.

4164
01:53:01,160 --> 01:53:02,180
What skills am I getting?

4165
01:53:02,200 --> 01:53:03,290
Working at Newport creamery,

4166
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:04,343
there are a lot like.

4167
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:07,390
I'll give you an example of gas stations
because gas stations are good example.

4168
01:53:07,420 --> 01:53:10,670
I worked at a gas station because at one
point in time there were a lot of jobs

4169
01:53:10,671 --> 01:53:12,690
for young kids at gas stations and,

4170
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:13,300
and,

4171
01:53:13,300 --> 01:53:13,561
and,

4172
01:53:13,561 --> 01:53:14,990
and they work mainly for tips.

4173
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:15,191
You know,

4174
01:53:15,191 --> 01:53:15,311
you,

4175
01:53:15,311 --> 01:53:16,250
they would pump gas,

4176
01:53:16,251 --> 01:53:17,810
they would check the air in the tires,

4177
01:53:17,811 --> 01:53:20,300
they'd wash your windows and
they didn't make very much,

4178
01:53:20,301 --> 01:53:22,700
but between Philips and
these were the pump jockeys,

4179
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:23,630
right between Phillips,

4180
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:27,020
maybe they worked with a mechanic and
they helped out to mechanics and you know,

4181
01:53:27,080 --> 01:53:30,670
a lot of auto mechanics
got their start as a,

4182
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:31,300
you know,

4183
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:32,970
pumped jockeys and you know,

4184
01:53:32,980 --> 01:53:33,320
and you know,

4185
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:33,831
eventually,

4186
01:53:33,831 --> 01:53:34,011
you know,

4187
01:53:34,011 --> 01:53:36,740
they were able to become a mechanic and
they can earn more money as some of them

4188
01:53:36,741 --> 01:53:39,120
may be eventually opened up their
own gas station and you know,

4189
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:40,640
became entrepreneurs and had a few,

4190
01:53:40,790 --> 01:53:41,870
but they got started,

4191
01:53:42,110 --> 01:53:42,381
uh,

4192
01:53:42,381 --> 01:53:42,741
you know,

4193
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:44,180
at an entry level position.

4194
01:53:44,210 --> 01:53:44,811
Now of course,

4195
01:53:44,811 --> 01:53:45,650
the minimum wage law,

4196
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:47,270
it's all self serve.

4197
01:53:47,271 --> 01:53:47,451
I mean,

4198
01:53:47,451 --> 01:53:48,350
you go to a gas station,

4199
01:53:48,351 --> 01:53:49,161
there's no human beings there.

4200
01:53:49,161 --> 01:53:52,100
Maybe there's one guy that's in a
little booth that's Kinda overseeing,

4201
01:53:52,101 --> 01:53:52,581
but you know,

4202
01:53:52,581 --> 01:53:54,020
if you want to check
your air in your tire,

4203
01:53:54,021 --> 01:53:54,621
you do yourself,

4204
01:53:54,621 --> 01:53:55,431
you want to wash your windows,

4205
01:53:55,431 --> 01:53:56,300
you wash your own windows.

4206
01:53:56,510 --> 01:53:58,820
All those jobs had been
eliminated by the minimum wage,

4207
01:53:59,030 --> 01:54:02,720
but so as the opportunities that came
with them and now if you want to get a

4208
01:54:02,721 --> 01:54:04,490
mechanic where you got to
go to vocational school,

4209
01:54:04,491 --> 01:54:05,271
you got to pay money,

4210
01:54:05,271 --> 01:54:06,200
you got to go into debt,

4211
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:06,860
you know,

4212
01:54:06,860 --> 01:54:08,270
maybe you can learn to be a mechanic,

4213
01:54:08,271 --> 01:54:09,080
but you know,

4214
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:13,640
on the job training was how young people
use to acquire skills in and now we've

4215
01:54:13,641 --> 01:54:15,380
got all those guys going to college.

4216
01:54:15,381 --> 01:54:16,700
They get a philosophy degree.

4217
01:54:16,840 --> 01:54:17,060
You know,

4218
01:54:17,060 --> 01:54:18,140
they spend six years,

4219
01:54:18,141 --> 01:54:18,500
you know,

4220
01:54:18,500 --> 01:54:18,890
you know,

4221
01:54:18,890 --> 01:54:20,330
barfing at frat parties,

4222
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,010
but they graduate with a huge debt.

4223
01:54:22,011 --> 01:54:22,844
They know nothing.

4224
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:23,391
You know,

4225
01:54:23,391 --> 01:54:25,250
a lot of them would have
been better off getting a,

4226
01:54:25,480 --> 01:54:27,800
getting a low paying job and
learning how to do something.

4227
01:54:27,910 --> 01:54:29,510
During this time of this,

4228
01:54:29,720 --> 01:54:32,990
when people did learn how to be a
mechanic by becoming a pump jockey,

4229
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:34,370
there was a minimum wage in effect.

4230
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:35,120
Well,

4231
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:38,690
the minimum wage in America
didn't start until 1938,

4232
01:54:38,730 --> 01:54:40,400
but I was at a gas station,

4233
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:40,701
I know,

4234
01:54:40,701 --> 01:54:42,350
but let me minimum wage.

4235
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:47,620
It started in 1938 and it only
affected some certain federal workers.

4236
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:48,910
It wasn't,

4237
01:54:48,910 --> 01:54:50,930
and it was 25,

4238
01:54:51,300 --> 01:54:52,280
twenty five cents an hour.

4239
01:54:53,330 --> 01:54:56,570
It didn't apply to most workers
until the mid 19 sixties.

4240
01:54:56,600 --> 01:55:00,470
So it was the war on poverty
that really brought about the,

4241
01:55:00,471 --> 01:55:00,920
um,

4242
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:01,641
the minimum wage.

4243
01:55:01,641 --> 01:55:02,110
So,

4244
01:55:02,110 --> 01:55:02,380
and,

4245
01:55:02,380 --> 01:55:04,310
and of course over time,

4246
01:55:04,311 --> 01:55:08,030
as the minimum wage got higher and
higher during the sixties and seventies,

4247
01:55:08,150 --> 01:55:10,430
that's when it really began
to take a bigger toll.

4248
01:55:10,460 --> 01:55:10,691
But at,

4249
01:55:10,691 --> 01:55:13,160
like if you look now at like
black teenage unemployment,

4250
01:55:13,161 --> 01:55:14,120
which is off the charts,

4251
01:55:14,121 --> 01:55:14,571
which is what,

4252
01:55:14,571 --> 01:55:14,950
50,

4253
01:55:14,950 --> 01:55:15,330
60,

4254
01:55:15,330 --> 01:55:16,790
70 percent of much exactly what it is.

4255
01:55:17,030 --> 01:55:18,740
But if you go back
before the minimum wage,

4256
01:55:19,160 --> 01:55:19,730
right?

4257
01:55:19,730 --> 01:55:22,090
Black teenage unemployment was 15 percent,

4258
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:24,380
it was actually lower than
white teenage unemployment.

4259
01:55:24,650 --> 01:55:25,483
Um,

4260
01:55:25,570 --> 01:55:25,970
and,

4261
01:55:25,970 --> 01:55:26,330
and,

4262
01:55:26,330 --> 01:55:26,531
and,

4263
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:27,360
and all this stuff,

4264
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,193
you take it,

4265
01:55:28,250 --> 01:55:28,430
you,

4266
01:55:28,430 --> 01:55:32,180
you take the bottom rung off the job
ladder and you just obliterate it,

4267
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:32,500
you,

4268
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:32,650
you,

4269
01:55:32,650 --> 01:55:32,900
you,

4270
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:35,120
you just make it impossible for young,

4271
01:55:35,121 --> 01:55:37,040
unskilled people to get a job.

4272
01:55:37,041 --> 01:55:39,650
And it's not just a minimum wage
because that's the beginning,

4273
01:55:39,860 --> 01:55:40,190
right?

4274
01:55:40,190 --> 01:55:41,960
Because if you employ
somebody at the minimum wage,

4275
01:55:41,961 --> 01:55:43,710
you still got to pay payroll taxes,

4276
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:45,390
you gotta pay unemployment taxes,

4277
01:55:45,540 --> 01:55:47,880
you've got other mandated costs,

4278
01:55:48,030 --> 01:55:50,640
legal costs that increase
the cost of hiring.

4279
01:55:50,760 --> 01:55:52,680
So maybe even though the
minimum wage is seven,

4280
01:55:52,690 --> 01:55:53,580
25 an hour,

4281
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:56,220
it may be a cost you 10 bucks
to hire the guy an hour,

4282
01:55:56,221 --> 01:55:57,290
even though you only give them seven.

4283
01:55:57,310 --> 01:55:58,740
Twenty five is cost you 10 bucks.

4284
01:55:59,640 --> 01:55:59,970
What if,

4285
01:55:59,970 --> 01:56:02,220
what if their productivity
is only worth $6?

4286
01:56:02,280 --> 01:56:03,001
You can't hire him.

4287
01:56:03,001 --> 01:56:03,834
It's impossible.

4288
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:05,520
You're not going to
hire him to lose money.

4289
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:06,750
You're not going to train somebody.

4290
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:07,260
I mean,

4291
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:07,501
you know,

4292
01:56:07,501 --> 01:56:08,400
there are a lot of people,

4293
01:56:08,401 --> 01:56:09,270
these success stories,

4294
01:56:09,271 --> 01:56:09,421
you know,

4295
01:56:09,421 --> 01:56:11,190
people go from the mail
room to the board room,

4296
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:11,581
you know,

4297
01:56:11,581 --> 01:56:12,480
it's harder to start,

4298
01:56:12,620 --> 01:56:12,840
you know,

4299
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,950
at the bottom because it's hard to get
your foot on the bottom right because you

4300
01:56:15,951 --> 01:56:16,001
know,

4301
01:56:16,001 --> 01:56:20,640
you have to be at a much higher level
and it disproportionately impacts poor

4302
01:56:20,641 --> 01:56:21,300
kids.

4303
01:56:21,300 --> 01:56:22,560
Inner City kids,

4304
01:56:22,770 --> 01:56:23,130
uh,

4305
01:56:23,130 --> 01:56:23,770
you know,

4306
01:56:23,770 --> 01:56:24,131
and,

4307
01:56:24,131 --> 01:56:28,020
and it favors these minimum wage laws
will favor skilled workers over unskilled

4308
01:56:28,021 --> 01:56:29,760
workers because if I have
to pay a certain wage,

4309
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:31,980
well then maybe I'll hire
somebody that has more skill.

4310
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:32,641
In fact,

4311
01:56:32,641 --> 01:56:33,750
it was the skilled workers,

4312
01:56:33,751 --> 01:56:36,300
the labor unions that
lobbied for the minimum wage,

4313
01:56:36,420 --> 01:56:39,720
not because it benefited them because
they made much more than minimum wage.

4314
01:56:39,810 --> 01:56:43,470
What they wanted to do is make it
expensive to hire unskilled labor.

4315
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:45,120
So you wouldn't hire the unskilled labor,

4316
01:56:45,121 --> 01:56:46,800
you would just hire the union labor.

4317
01:56:46,990 --> 01:56:47,711
I see what you're saying.

4318
01:56:47,711 --> 01:56:51,160
So what you're saying essentially is
that minimum wages is more government

4319
01:56:51,161 --> 01:56:56,161
intrusion and the more freedom that you
have the government take away from you,

4320
01:56:56,530 --> 01:56:58,660
whether it's minimum wage freedom,

4321
01:56:58,870 --> 01:56:59,703
whether it's tax free,

4322
01:56:59,710 --> 01:57:01,900
whatever it is the worst is going to be,

4323
01:57:01,901 --> 01:57:03,130
you're going to have more regulations,

4324
01:57:03,131 --> 01:57:04,300
you're going to have more people involved,

4325
01:57:04,301 --> 01:57:04,991
more red tape,

4326
01:57:04,991 --> 01:57:05,650
more bullshit,

4327
01:57:05,650 --> 01:57:06,483
more waste.

4328
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:07,480
Yeah,

4329
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:09,370
I should have a right to work,

4330
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:10,090
you know,

4331
01:57:10,090 --> 01:57:11,280
if you know,

4332
01:57:11,290 --> 01:57:12,920
if I want to write it,

4333
01:57:12,921 --> 01:57:13,320
you know,

4334
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:13,690
and look,

4335
01:57:13,690 --> 01:57:13,901
you know,

4336
01:57:13,901 --> 01:57:14,681
the interesting thing,

4337
01:57:14,681 --> 01:57:16,360
look at all these lawsuits now,

4338
01:57:16,361 --> 01:57:18,550
the internships in the
entertainment industry,

4339
01:57:18,660 --> 01:57:18,821
you know,

4340
01:57:18,821 --> 01:57:20,200
this has the perverse effect of it.

4341
01:57:20,201 --> 01:57:24,190
So the government made it illegal to
pay somebody below the minimum wage,

4342
01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:25,990
but it was okay if they worked for free.

4343
01:57:26,250 --> 01:57:26,590
Right?

4344
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:29,680
So now you have all these interns who
probably would have been paid something if

4345
01:57:29,681 --> 01:57:30,730
it wasn't for the minimum wage,

4346
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:32,710
but since it was illegal
to pay them something,

4347
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:34,120
they ended up working for nothing.

4348
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:34,871
Of course,

4349
01:57:34,871 --> 01:57:36,910
now they're suing and
they're winning lawsuits say,

4350
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:37,370
hey,

4351
01:57:37,370 --> 01:57:38,260
you have to pay me.

4352
01:57:38,320 --> 01:57:40,120
So now they're going to
destroy the internships.

4353
01:57:40,121 --> 01:57:43,030
And now a lot of these companies that
used to have internships aren't going to

4354
01:57:43,031 --> 01:57:43,610
have them anyway.

4355
01:57:43,610 --> 01:57:45,110
Don't the interns get college credit?

4356
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:46,530
It wasn't that the whole idea behind it.

4357
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:47,580
Some of them do,

4358
01:57:47,580 --> 01:57:47,971
but then.

4359
01:57:47,971 --> 01:57:51,030
But then that was even worse because
what would happen sometimes in order to

4360
01:57:51,031 --> 01:57:54,450
keep themselves safe because the
employers didn't want to run a foul of the

4361
01:57:54,451 --> 01:57:55,284
employment law.

4362
01:57:55,350 --> 01:57:58,470
So they would only give you the internship
if you got it through a college.

4363
01:57:58,500 --> 01:57:58,800
Right.

4364
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:01,840
So now what would happen is you'd actually
have to pay to be an intern because

4365
01:58:01,850 --> 01:58:05,490
you'd go and pay tuition to a college
just so you can go and work for free.

4366
01:58:05,850 --> 01:58:06,061
I mean,

4367
01:58:06,061 --> 01:58:09,330
wouldn't it be better not to pay the
tuition and go into debt and just work for

4368
01:58:09,331 --> 01:58:11,490
a low wage than to pay
to work for no wage.

4369
01:58:11,580 --> 01:58:11,851
I mean,

4370
01:58:11,851 --> 01:58:15,240
this is what happens when you have
all these government regulations.

4371
01:58:15,241 --> 01:58:17,160
Everybody is worse off.

4372
01:58:17,460 --> 01:58:18,180
And you know,

4373
01:58:18,180 --> 01:58:18,541
people,

4374
01:58:18,541 --> 01:58:19,201
people think,

4375
01:58:19,201 --> 01:58:21,690
oh these young people are being exploited.

4376
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:21,841
No,

4377
01:58:21,841 --> 01:58:22,674
they're not.

4378
01:58:22,710 --> 01:58:23,940
It's not exploitation in.

4379
01:58:23,941 --> 01:58:27,840
A lot of times it's the best thing that
can happen to them is they get a job and

4380
01:58:27,841 --> 01:58:28,170
you know,

4381
01:58:28,170 --> 01:58:28,651
people say,

4382
01:58:28,651 --> 01:58:28,861
well,

4383
01:58:28,861 --> 01:58:29,041
you know,

4384
01:58:29,041 --> 01:58:31,020
you can't raise a family
on the minimum wage.

4385
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:31,711
Of course not.

4386
01:58:31,711 --> 01:58:32,850
And you shouldn't even try.

4387
01:58:33,060 --> 01:58:33,480
I mean,

4388
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:35,730
if all you can do is flip burgers,

4389
01:58:35,820 --> 01:58:37,200
why are you starting a family?

4390
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:37,680
I mean,

4391
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:38,110
you should,

4392
01:58:38,110 --> 01:58:38,730
you know,

4393
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:38,950
you,

4394
01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:39,120
you,

4395
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:40,980
you got to develop your skills.

4396
01:58:41,050 --> 01:58:42,010
You got to be able

4397
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:45,760
to earn more money than that before you
take on those extra responsibilities.

4398
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:46,691
But if you say,

4399
01:58:46,691 --> 01:58:46,930
hey,

4400
01:58:46,930 --> 01:58:50,380
every wage has to be a wage
that could let you know,

4401
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:51,310
support a family,

4402
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:53,110
then there are no entry level jobs.

4403
01:58:53,140 --> 01:58:56,320
Well then how do you enter the labor
market if there's no entry level position,

4404
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:56,980
you know,

4405
01:58:56,980 --> 01:58:57,131
well,

4406
01:58:57,131 --> 01:58:59,140
if you're in a situation
like a fast food Gig,

4407
01:58:59,200 --> 01:58:59,890
I mean,

4408
01:58:59,890 --> 01:59:01,540
where does that lead to the manager?

4409
01:59:01,570 --> 01:59:01,811
I mean,

4410
01:59:01,811 --> 01:59:01,991
what,

4411
01:59:01,991 --> 01:59:02,181
what,

4412
01:59:02,181 --> 01:59:02,410
what,

4413
01:59:02,410 --> 01:59:02,890
how do you know,

4414
01:59:02,890 --> 01:59:04,490
rise through the ranks at a fast food.

4415
01:59:04,750 --> 01:59:05,800
Some people write,

4416
01:59:05,801 --> 01:59:07,000
some people start out,

4417
01:59:07,240 --> 01:59:07,780
you know,

4418
01:59:07,780 --> 01:59:08,031
uh,

4419
01:59:08,031 --> 01:59:08,261
you know,

4420
01:59:08,261 --> 01:59:10,100
cooking French fries or mopping up and,

4421
01:59:10,110 --> 01:59:12,580
and go onto b if own a franchise.

4422
01:59:12,581 --> 01:59:12,731
I mean,

4423
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:15,130
so you can certainly move
up and there are people,

4424
01:59:15,370 --> 01:59:15,581
uh,

4425
01:59:15,581 --> 01:59:17,090
I think the guy who's about to be this,

4426
01:59:17,120 --> 01:59:18,550
the new CEO of Walmart,

4427
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:22,450
his first job was working on a loading
dock and what are the distribution

4428
01:59:22,451 --> 01:59:24,160
centers and now he's the be as CEO.

4429
01:59:24,250 --> 01:59:25,870
He worked his way up to
the very top of the call.

4430
01:59:25,871 --> 01:59:26,704
You went to college.

4431
01:59:27,040 --> 01:59:27,260
Uh,

4432
01:59:27,260 --> 01:59:28,001
but I mean that's not,

4433
01:59:28,001 --> 01:59:30,190
but that's how he got his foot
in the door and I probably,

4434
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:30,371
you know,

4435
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:30,880
but,

4436
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:31,431
but the,

4437
01:59:31,431 --> 01:59:33,630
I mean they wouldn't have hired
him to run the company and let's,

4438
01:59:33,650 --> 01:59:34,460
maybe,

4439
01:59:34,460 --> 01:59:35,560
but I don't know,

4440
01:59:35,561 --> 01:59:36,130
but maybe,

4441
01:59:36,130 --> 01:59:36,490
maybe,

4442
01:59:36,490 --> 01:59:37,830
maybe the fact that he worked there,

4443
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:38,080
gave,

4444
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:41,080
maybe that gave him a leg up to making
sure that definitely had an impact.

4445
01:59:41,110 --> 01:59:43,570
But if you take a look at
something that works at Mcdonald's,

4446
01:59:43,810 --> 01:59:47,230
you don't necessarily have to
work up the chain of Mcdonald's.

4447
01:59:47,710 --> 01:59:49,120
Mcdonald's could be your first job.

4448
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:49,330
Look,

4449
01:59:49,330 --> 01:59:50,470
what were my first jobs?

4450
01:59:50,471 --> 01:59:51,730
I delivered groceries.

4451
01:59:52,060 --> 01:59:53,350
I bagged groceries.

4452
01:59:53,560 --> 01:59:53,980
I,

4453
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:54,311
I,

4454
01:59:54,311 --> 01:59:54,850
uh,

4455
01:59:54,850 --> 01:59:57,700
I sold a clothing retail in the mall.

4456
01:59:57,701 --> 01:59:58,540
I sold shoes.

4457
01:59:58,660 --> 02:00:00,190
I sold cable door to door.

4458
02:00:00,330 --> 02:00:00,701
And they say,

4459
02:00:00,701 --> 02:00:00,880
well,

4460
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:01,061
you know,

4461
02:00:01,061 --> 02:00:02,540
did I move up in the know,

4462
02:00:02,650 --> 02:00:03,100
but I,

4463
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:05,410
I ended up getting other jobs where,

4464
02:00:05,411 --> 02:00:05,770
you know,

4465
02:00:05,770 --> 02:00:07,360
the sales skills were important,

4466
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:07,840
uh,

4467
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,051
you know,

4468
02:00:08,051 --> 02:00:08,800
you get you just,

4469
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:12,550
even when I got my first job at a
supermarket and a lot of times I was just

4470
02:00:12,551 --> 02:00:13,750
mopping up the floors.

4471
02:00:13,840 --> 02:00:16,180
I was bagging the groceries and
I would deliver the groceries.

4472
02:00:16,510 --> 02:00:18,130
But you just learn to show up at time,

4473
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:18,820
you know,

4474
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:20,320
and now you have something
that you've done.

4475
02:00:20,350 --> 02:00:20,680
I mean,

4476
02:00:20,680 --> 02:00:21,191
a lot of it.

4477
02:00:21,191 --> 02:00:23,800
So you get a job at Mcdonald's and
then you get a job someplace else.

4478
02:00:23,801 --> 02:00:24,700
That's better because,

4479
02:00:24,701 --> 02:00:24,781
well,

4480
02:00:24,781 --> 02:00:25,930
what did you do before you were here?

4481
02:00:25,931 --> 02:00:26,081
Well,

4482
02:00:26,081 --> 02:00:26,914
I worked at Mcdonald's.

4483
02:00:27,010 --> 02:00:27,850
How long were you there?

4484
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:28,780
I was there for a couple of years.

4485
02:00:28,781 --> 02:00:29,021
In fact,

4486
02:00:29,021 --> 02:00:29,890
I still have the job.

4487
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:31,900
Oh well that means at
least you didn't get fired.

4488
02:00:32,050 --> 02:00:32,650
You have the job.

4489
02:00:32,650 --> 02:00:33,040
I mean,

4490
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:33,910
you've got something.

4491
02:00:34,180 --> 02:00:35,500
You've got to start somewhere.

4492
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:39,760
Everybody starts somewhere and you can't
expect to get paid a lot of money when

4493
02:00:39,761 --> 02:00:41,200
you first start out.

4494
02:00:41,320 --> 02:00:45,850
You've got to make yourself more valuable
because what you are when individuals,

4495
02:00:46,120 --> 02:00:47,950
we sell our labor to the highest bidder,

4496
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:48,700
you know,

4497
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:52,630
and so what you have to do is you've
got to figure out how can I increase my

4498
02:00:52,631 --> 02:00:56,770
value to a potential employer so that
he'll pay me more money but isn't the idea

4499
02:00:56,771 --> 02:00:58,870
of minimum wage just to
keep it from being gross,

4500
02:00:59,140 --> 02:01:00,940
not make it so it is low.

4501
02:01:00,940 --> 02:01:02,320
$15 an hour is pretty low.

4502
02:01:02,321 --> 02:01:06,450
It's incredibly difficult to make
a living getting $15 an hour.

4503
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:09,700
But I must say you don't have to
make a living and feed yourself if,

4504
02:01:09,710 --> 02:01:10,000
if,

4505
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:10,600
if they,

4506
02:01:10,600 --> 02:01:14,830
if they enforced a minimum wage
of $15 an hour on like Mcdonald's,

4507
02:01:14,860 --> 02:01:16,360
there would be no human
beings working there.

4508
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:17,290
It would all be automated.

4509
02:01:17,410 --> 02:01:17,870
They wouldn't,

4510
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:18,460
you know,

4511
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:18,611
you know,

4512
02:01:18,611 --> 02:01:21,400
there might be one guy there that
made sure that the robots didn't,

4513
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:21,721
uh,

4514
02:01:21,721 --> 02:01:21,920
you know,

4515
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:22,753
didn't break down,

4516
02:01:23,080 --> 02:01:23,501
but you know,

4517
02:01:23,501 --> 02:01:25,890
there'd be machines making a
hamburger is make it a French fries.

4518
02:01:25,900 --> 02:01:26,980
Wouldn't be like a gas station.

4519
02:01:26,981 --> 02:01:27,641
Wouldn't that be good?

4520
02:01:27,641 --> 02:01:30,280
Just like we were talking
about deregulation and the
government forcing them to

4521
02:01:30,281 --> 02:01:35,281
get real jobs for the people that work
in the fast food burger king and get them

4522
02:01:35,921 --> 02:01:36,620
out there,

4523
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:37,211
but then they would.

4524
02:01:37,211 --> 02:01:38,990
What would they do then
just go on welfare for them.

4525
02:01:39,550 --> 02:01:41,750
Figure out a way to get a real job,

4526
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:42,051
but no,

4527
02:01:42,051 --> 02:01:44,210
but that is their entry to the job market.

4528
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:45,470
I mean they have no skills.

4529
02:01:45,471 --> 02:01:45,740
Look,

4530
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,131
believe me,

4531
02:01:46,131 --> 02:01:47,480
if these people had better skills,

4532
02:01:47,481 --> 02:01:48,710
would they be working at Mcdonald's?

4533
02:01:48,830 --> 02:01:48,981
Now?

4534
02:01:48,981 --> 02:01:49,910
Part of the problem is,

4535
02:01:49,911 --> 02:01:50,480
and this isn't,

4536
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:54,680
you know that there are some people that
really could be working better jobs,

4537
02:01:54,740 --> 02:01:58,640
but they're not because we have this
phony economy that is preventing those

4538
02:01:58,641 --> 02:01:59,870
better jobs from being created.

4539
02:02:00,020 --> 02:02:00,500
That's the.

4540
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:01,221
That's the problem.

4541
02:02:01,221 --> 02:02:04,670
There are a lot of people now that are
working at Mcdonald's because that's all

4542
02:02:04,671 --> 02:02:06,080
they can get and you know,

4543
02:02:06,081 --> 02:02:06,541
it's not like,

4544
02:02:06,541 --> 02:02:07,070
you know,

4545
02:02:07,070 --> 02:02:08,930
at least they got that to fall back on.

4546
02:02:09,200 --> 02:02:11,570
But the problem is why
aren't there better jobs?

4547
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:14,890
Why aren't the jobs that would normally
be there for you to work up right?

4548
02:02:14,900 --> 02:02:16,610
To the jobs that are
higher up on the ladder,

4549
02:02:16,790 --> 02:02:17,660
where are those jobs?

4550
02:02:17,780 --> 02:02:20,510
And those jobs are being destroyed by
the government because we need more

4551
02:02:20,511 --> 02:02:21,200
savings.

4552
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:22,550
We need more capital investment.

4553
02:02:22,670 --> 02:02:24,680
We need higher interest
rates for that to happen.

4554
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:29,060
And the government is so busy inflating
this bubble economy that they're sucking

4555
02:02:29,061 --> 02:02:30,440
all the air out of the real economy.

4556
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:34,250
They're diverting resources from main
street to Wall Street and they are

4557
02:02:34,251 --> 02:02:36,290
preventing these jobs from being created,

4558
02:02:36,291 --> 02:02:36,611
in fact,

4559
02:02:36,611 --> 02:02:38,510
are destroying a lot
of the jobs that exist.

4560
02:02:38,630 --> 02:02:40,490
So how would you fix that if you,

4561
02:02:40,491 --> 02:02:41,090
if um,

4562
02:02:41,090 --> 02:02:42,710
Obama and I say Peter Schiff,

4563
02:02:42,950 --> 02:02:44,480
I heard you on the Joe Rogan experience.

4564
02:02:44,481 --> 02:02:47,540
You make a lot of sense
as I got working for me.

4565
02:02:47,541 --> 02:02:48,410
Fucking suck.

4566
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:49,420
Come over here man.

4567
02:02:49,430 --> 02:02:49,890
Sit down.

4568
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:50,900
Tell me what the fuck to do.

4569
02:02:50,901 --> 02:02:51,651
What can I do here?

4570
02:02:51,651 --> 02:02:53,720
How do we fix this mess
other than resigning?

4571
02:02:53,721 --> 02:02:54,554
But I guess if he's,

4572
02:02:55,490 --> 02:02:57,590
if he's actually going to list
out a way to make friends,

4573
02:02:57,591 --> 02:02:58,940
but if he's actually
going to listen to me,

4574
02:02:58,941 --> 02:02:59,990
that I don't want him to resign.

4575
02:03:00,810 --> 02:03:02,900
If he actually has that kind of epiphany.

4576
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:03,793
Let's pretend,

4577
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:04,280
well 10,

4578
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:05,930
Jamie's the president and
you've got to convince him.

4579
02:03:06,530 --> 02:03:06,771
Yeah,

4580
02:03:06,771 --> 02:03:08,590
well then you got a.

4581
02:03:08,600 --> 02:03:09,740
What would you tell them to do?

4582
02:03:09,770 --> 02:03:10,640
What would you tell him to do?

4583
02:03:10,850 --> 02:03:11,720
He's got to start,

4584
02:03:11,750 --> 02:03:12,080
you know,

4585
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:14,300
repealing rules and regulations and,

4586
02:03:14,490 --> 02:03:14,870
and,

4587
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:19,820
and shrinking government and closing
down agencies and departments and laying

4588
02:03:19,821 --> 02:03:23,310
off government workers
and government workers.

4589
02:03:23,480 --> 02:03:23,810
How do you,

4590
02:03:23,810 --> 02:03:24,643
where do you start?

4591
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:25,850
I'll start at the top.

4592
02:03:25,960 --> 02:03:26,141
I mean,

4593
02:03:26,141 --> 02:03:28,220
we've got fire the president.

4594
02:03:28,920 --> 02:03:29,960
You want to save the company?

4595
02:03:30,230 --> 02:03:31,190
You've got to go under yourself.

4596
02:03:31,191 --> 02:03:31,641
But I said,

4597
02:03:31,641 --> 02:03:33,280
get rid of all of the economic advisors.

4598
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:35,020
Look at the Department of Energy,

4599
02:03:35,021 --> 02:03:36,150
the Department of Agriculture,

4600
02:03:36,151 --> 02:03:37,160
the Department of Education,

4601
02:03:37,161 --> 02:03:37,610
assholes.

4602
02:03:37,610 --> 02:03:38,443
Every one of them.

4603
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:39,801
Some of them are,

4604
02:03:39,801 --> 02:03:40,291
some of them are,

4605
02:03:40,291 --> 02:03:42,260
but we can't afford them
and they're not helping.

4606
02:03:42,290 --> 02:03:43,730
They're not making the country richer.

4607
02:03:43,731 --> 02:03:44,660
They're making it poor.

4608
02:03:44,840 --> 02:03:46,490
We didn't always have these departments.

4609
02:03:46,490 --> 02:03:49,580
A lot of these departments weren't even
created until the second half of the

4610
02:03:49,581 --> 02:03:50,414
20th century.

4611
02:03:50,480 --> 02:03:53,180
America made it without all
those agencies and departments.

4612
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:56,900
We didn't even have the Department of
energy came in in the late 19 seventies.

4613
02:03:56,990 --> 02:03:57,171
I mean,

4614
02:03:57,171 --> 02:03:57,921
what do we need it for it?

4615
02:03:57,921 --> 02:03:58,340
In fact,

4616
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:00,260
when we first developed
the Department of Energy,

4617
02:04:00,590 --> 02:04:03,350
it was because we imported
like 30 percent of our oil.

4618
02:04:03,351 --> 02:04:04,370
We said this is too much.

4619
02:04:04,490 --> 02:04:05,690
We have to do something about it.

4620
02:04:05,750 --> 02:04:06,980
So then we were report 40,

4621
02:04:06,981 --> 02:04:07,880
70 percent of our oil.

4622
02:04:07,940 --> 02:04:10,400
I mean the Department of Energy
doesn't produce any energy.

4623
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,650
I mean it just produces
jobs for bureaucrats,

4624
02:04:12,651 --> 02:04:15,680
but there's all these agencies and
departments that we can't afford.

4625
02:04:15,710 --> 02:04:16,550
We never needed them.

4626
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:19,400
It was a way for politicians to
buy votes and to peddle influence.

4627
02:04:19,610 --> 02:04:20,510
We got to get rid of it.

4628
02:04:20,810 --> 02:04:24,200
But what we also have to do is get to the
Federal Reserve because interest rates

4629
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:25,010
have to go up.

4630
02:04:25,010 --> 02:04:25,131
Well,

4631
02:04:25,131 --> 02:04:27,020
let's say you can have
zero percent interest rate.

4632
02:04:27,021 --> 02:04:28,370
Let's pretend we're taking
care of this right now.

4633
02:04:28,371 --> 02:04:29,480
So Department of Energy,

4634
02:04:29,510 --> 02:04:30,350
they're fucking useless.

4635
02:04:30,351 --> 02:04:31,340
They don't do anything for us.

4636
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:31,491
Well,

4637
02:04:31,491 --> 02:04:32,590
they're the worst than useless.

4638
02:04:32,630 --> 02:04:33,291
They were useless.

4639
02:04:33,291 --> 02:04:34,130
That would be an improvement.

4640
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:38,040
So obviously the world has changed
drastically since the time when

4641
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:41,060
we imported 50 percent and
maybe the our needs are,

4642
02:04:41,210 --> 02:04:42,043
you know,

4643
02:04:42,390 --> 02:04:44,790
greatly disproportionate
to back then as well.

4644
02:04:44,910 --> 02:04:46,110
That's why we need 70 percent.

4645
02:04:46,111 --> 02:04:49,780
But what you're saying is there's no
benefit in having the department for

4646
02:04:49,790 --> 02:04:50,623
Education.

4647
02:04:51,210 --> 02:04:53,660
We would produce a lot more
energy without the departments.

4648
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:56,670
We'd have much better education without
the department of Education and they do

4649
02:04:56,671 --> 02:04:57,500
read the department.

4650
02:04:57,500 --> 02:04:58,720
What are they getting away?

4651
02:04:58,920 --> 02:04:59,490
In what way?

4652
02:04:59,490 --> 02:04:59,611
Well,

4653
02:04:59,611 --> 02:04:59,971
first of all,

4654
02:04:59,971 --> 02:05:01,140
we have to pay their salaries.

4655
02:05:01,170 --> 02:05:01,351
Right?

4656
02:05:01,351 --> 02:05:01,621
Okay.

4657
02:05:01,621 --> 02:05:02,880
Pay The expensive.

4658
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:05,970
It's expensive to support
all these bureaucrats.

4659
02:05:06,060 --> 02:05:07,320
And then once they have a job,

4660
02:05:07,321 --> 02:05:08,730
they got to figure out something to do.

4661
02:05:08,940 --> 02:05:09,930
They got to make up stuff.

4662
02:05:09,931 --> 02:05:11,430
I mean that's how government works.

4663
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:14,550
Government doesn't want to solve a problem
because then there's no need for the

4664
02:05:14,551 --> 02:05:15,150
agency.

4665
02:05:15,150 --> 02:05:16,770
The minute you have a problem and you say,

4666
02:05:16,771 --> 02:05:17,011
okay,

4667
02:05:17,011 --> 02:05:18,120
let's have the government solve it,

4668
02:05:18,450 --> 02:05:21,030
the last thing they want to do is solve
it because then there's no reason to

4669
02:05:21,031 --> 02:05:21,660
exist.

4670
02:05:21,660 --> 02:05:24,960
They want the problem to get bigger
so they can demand more resources.

4671
02:05:24,961 --> 02:05:25,930
They can have more people.

4672
02:05:25,931 --> 02:05:26,764
A bigger department,

4673
02:05:26,940 --> 02:05:31,020
so it's like the opposite of a capitalism
and it's not the survival of the

4674
02:05:31,021 --> 02:05:31,411
fittest.

4675
02:05:31,411 --> 02:05:31,600
It's,

4676
02:05:31,600 --> 02:05:31,900
you know,

4677
02:05:31,900 --> 02:05:32,200
the,

4678
02:05:32,200 --> 02:05:32,620
the,

4679
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:32,870
the,

4680
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:33,051
the,

4681
02:05:33,051 --> 02:05:34,260
the worst you do your job,

4682
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,250
the more you're rewarded,

4683
02:05:35,310 --> 02:05:35,940
right?

4684
02:05:35,940 --> 02:05:36,241
Uh,

4685
02:05:36,241 --> 02:05:39,240
and so you don't want to have
government doing all these things.

4686
02:05:39,241 --> 02:05:40,500
You want to let the market,

4687
02:05:40,680 --> 02:05:43,170
you want individuals that
have a vested interest.

4688
02:05:43,171 --> 02:05:44,460
You want the profit incentive,

4689
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:45,090
you know,

4690
02:05:45,090 --> 02:05:45,340
uh,

4691
02:05:45,340 --> 02:05:46,470
the invisible hand,

4692
02:05:46,650 --> 02:05:48,150
all the benefits of capitalism.

4693
02:05:48,151 --> 02:05:50,100
You don't want to get
screwed up by government.

4694
02:05:50,430 --> 02:05:55,290
But the thing that we have to understand
is we can't have this phony service

4695
02:05:55,291 --> 02:05:55,621
sector,

4696
02:05:55,621 --> 02:05:56,130
economy.

4697
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:59,400
We can't have everybody working
in healthcare and education.

4698
02:05:59,490 --> 02:06:01,200
We can't send every kid to college.

4699
02:06:01,201 --> 02:06:03,900
This idea that everybody needs
to go to college is nonsense.

4700
02:06:04,080 --> 02:06:05,730
Most people don't need to go to college.

4701
02:06:05,940 --> 02:06:06,360
You know,

4702
02:06:06,360 --> 02:06:07,260
at one point,

4703
02:06:07,410 --> 02:06:07,711
people,

4704
02:06:07,711 --> 02:06:07,890
when,

4705
02:06:07,890 --> 02:06:08,310
you know,

4706
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:08,701
maybe,

4707
02:06:08,701 --> 02:06:08,881
you know,

4708
02:06:08,881 --> 02:06:10,080
before the Second World War,

4709
02:06:10,290 --> 02:06:11,560
maybe I don't know what,

4710
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:13,920
I'm not even one out of
10 people went to college.

4711
02:06:14,230 --> 02:06:14,460
Uh,

4712
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:17,910
but if you went to college is because
you want it to be a doctor or you want it

4713
02:06:17,911 --> 02:06:19,470
to be something that
you really needed to go.

4714
02:06:19,650 --> 02:06:23,040
I mean now you have more
people waiting on tending bar,

4715
02:06:23,041 --> 02:06:23,761
waiting tables,

4716
02:06:23,761 --> 02:06:26,040
driving cab with college degrees.

4717
02:06:26,041 --> 02:06:27,330
Some of them have advanced degrees.

4718
02:06:27,450 --> 02:06:27,630
You know,

4719
02:06:27,630 --> 02:06:28,470
you want to get a laugh.

4720
02:06:28,471 --> 02:06:29,440
I did this video,

4721
02:06:29,500 --> 02:06:30,333
know if you saw it.

4722
02:06:30,450 --> 02:06:34,140
I was in New Orleans and I was working
walking down Bourbon Street and I was

4723
02:06:34,141 --> 02:06:36,810
interviewing people and asking them,

4724
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:37,320
you know,

4725
02:06:37,320 --> 02:06:41,160
if they graduated from college and what
their major was and when they graduated

4726
02:06:41,161 --> 02:06:42,060
and they all did and never.

4727
02:06:42,061 --> 02:06:44,280
Some of them had two or three
degrees and they were all,

4728
02:06:44,400 --> 02:06:44,850
you know,

4729
02:06:44,850 --> 02:06:49,850
bartenders are bouncers at strip clubs
are pedicab drivers are screening the

4730
02:06:50,070 --> 02:06:50,280
street.

4731
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:53,670
Everybody had a college
degree but nobody needed it.

4732
02:06:53,790 --> 02:06:55,400
But they all had debt that
they were working off.

4733
02:06:55,401 --> 02:06:55,590
I mean,

4734
02:06:55,590 --> 02:06:59,580
the idea that we have to send every kid
to college regardless of their aptitude,

4735
02:06:59,760 --> 02:07:01,060
regardless of whether or not you know,

4736
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:03,480
they're going to have any real
benefit who benefits from this?

4737
02:07:03,481 --> 02:07:04,261
It's the colleges,

4738
02:07:04,261 --> 02:07:05,041
the universities.

4739
02:07:05,041 --> 02:07:09,000
The administrators that make a fortune
off of all this money and the kids

4740
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:11,820
graduate with a worthless degree
because everybody else has one.

4741
02:07:11,821 --> 02:07:12,870
So who cares?

4742
02:07:12,990 --> 02:07:16,710
You don't know anything but you've got
all this debt and are the kids better off

4743
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,810
spending the first six years of adulthood,

4744
02:07:19,140 --> 02:07:19,650
you know,

4745
02:07:19,650 --> 02:07:20,580
in college,

4746
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:20,941
you know,

4747
02:07:20,941 --> 02:07:21,200
and that,

4748
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:21,360
you know,

4749
02:07:21,360 --> 02:07:21,781
a lot of them,

4750
02:07:21,781 --> 02:07:24,510
they move out of their parents' house
because they can borrow all this money to

4751
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:27,090
live off campus or Frat
or live in the dorms.

4752
02:07:27,360 --> 02:07:28,440
But now they are 22,

4753
02:07:28,441 --> 02:07:28,891
23,

4754
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:29,790
24 years old.

4755
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,500
They have such a pile of debt,

4756
02:07:31,501 --> 02:07:32,331
they can never get out from it.

4757
02:07:32,331 --> 02:07:33,600
And now they're back home for good.

4758
02:07:34,110 --> 02:07:36,190
I mean I'd rather have kids stay at home,

4759
02:07:36,430 --> 02:07:36,970
you know,

4760
02:07:36,970 --> 02:07:37,271
you know,

4761
02:07:37,271 --> 02:07:38,620
after they graduate high school,

4762
02:07:38,680 --> 02:07:39,910
get a low paying job,

4763
02:07:40,030 --> 02:07:41,140
don't take on any debt,

4764
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:42,400
maybe get some skills.

4765
02:07:42,401 --> 02:07:43,930
And then when they're 20 or 23,

4766
02:07:44,020 --> 02:07:44,950
then they can move out.

4767
02:07:44,951 --> 02:07:46,030
They can rent their own place,

4768
02:07:46,031 --> 02:07:46,990
they're self sufficient.

4769
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:47,891
Instead they're,

4770
02:07:47,891 --> 02:07:48,130
you know,

4771
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:48,660
the now,

4772
02:07:48,660 --> 02:07:48,850
now,

4773
02:07:48,850 --> 02:07:49,570
now they got no,

4774
02:07:49,570 --> 02:07:50,890
they got no options because they,

4775
02:07:50,891 --> 02:07:51,130
they,

4776
02:07:51,130 --> 02:07:51,410
they,

4777
02:07:51,410 --> 02:07:52,930
they follow the government's advice.

4778
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:53,351
Well,

4779
02:07:53,351 --> 02:07:57,430
obviously some have options and obviously
some people go to college to get jobs

4780
02:07:57,431 --> 02:08:00,280
and I don't know what the percentage is
of people that have successful careers

4781
02:08:00,281 --> 02:08:00,851
after college,

4782
02:08:00,851 --> 02:08:02,520
but I assume it's,

4783
02:08:02,640 --> 02:08:03,210
it's.

4784
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:03,490
I mean,

4785
02:08:03,490 --> 02:08:03,761
we don't,

4786
02:08:03,761 --> 02:08:06,970
we're not dealing with a nation of
constantly advancing homeless people where

4787
02:08:06,971 --> 02:08:09,910
every year the homeless
population goes up 3 million.

4788
02:08:10,300 --> 02:08:13,550
Most people on college campuses have.

4789
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,420
There's no reason for them to be
there and they will not benefit from,

4790
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:17,260
from being there.

4791
02:08:17,260 --> 02:08:17,450
Well,

4792
02:08:17,450 --> 02:08:18,310
I think there's a lot,

4793
02:08:18,650 --> 02:08:21,940
there's a growing process going on and
I agree with you that if you look at the

4794
02:08:21,941 --> 02:08:22,601
end result,

4795
02:08:22,601 --> 02:08:22,751
yeah,

4796
02:08:22,751 --> 02:08:24,100
most of them didn't benefit from it,

4797
02:08:24,101 --> 02:08:27,370
but they probably did anyway because
they benefited from knowing that this is

4798
02:08:27,371 --> 02:08:28,450
not how to get through in life.

4799
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,980
They benefited from knowing that you,

4800
02:08:31,220 --> 02:08:31,841
you look,

4801
02:08:31,841 --> 02:08:33,520
some people that they
went to college with,

4802
02:08:33,521 --> 02:08:36,210
I'm sure did some extensive,

4803
02:08:36,420 --> 02:08:38,560
a lesson for society.

4804
02:08:38,561 --> 02:08:41,170
I'm on this page with
you there of education.

4805
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:42,250
Fuck them too.

4806
02:08:42,251 --> 02:08:42,550
Right?

4807
02:08:42,550 --> 02:08:44,290
Let's get rid of them and the energy guys.

4808
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,370
So what are we down to?

4809
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:45,641
Well,

4810
02:08:45,641 --> 02:08:46,870
we got to get rid of a lot more,

4811
02:08:46,871 --> 02:08:48,760
but we got to go after the entitlements.

4812
02:08:48,761 --> 02:08:50,470
We've got to go after social
security and Medicare.

4813
02:08:50,471 --> 02:08:50,651
I mean,

4814
02:08:50,651 --> 02:08:51,850
these are disasters.

4815
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:52,691
You got to lighten up.

4816
02:08:52,691 --> 02:08:53,380
You want to drink?

4817
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:54,660
You want a little bit on drinking?

4818
02:08:54,660 --> 02:08:55,840
I'm drinking alcohol.

4819
02:08:55,960 --> 02:08:56,641
What do you got?

4820
02:08:56,641 --> 02:08:57,010
A beer.

4821
02:08:57,010 --> 02:08:57,840
You want a little scotch?

4822
02:08:57,840 --> 02:08:58,673
A little whiskey,

4823
02:08:58,750 --> 02:08:58,901
man.

4824
02:08:58,901 --> 02:08:59,734
I could go for some.

4825
02:09:00,430 --> 02:09:00,881
Get some.

4826
02:09:00,881 --> 02:09:02,150
Get some whiskey for this fellow.

4827
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:02,980
He needs to lighten up.

4828
02:09:02,980 --> 02:09:03,813
What time is it?

4829
02:09:03,940 --> 02:09:04,691
Plenty of times.

4830
02:09:04,691 --> 02:09:05,261
Don't worry about.

4831
02:09:05,261 --> 02:09:08,860
The Internet goes on forever and
time is illusion created by the man.

4832
02:09:09,260 --> 02:09:10,600
They've created these fucking clocks,

4833
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:12,850
so energy done.

4834
02:09:12,851 --> 02:09:13,720
We'll get rid of those.

4835
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:17,380
We'll figure out the energy
will will regulate it statewide.

4836
02:09:17,530 --> 02:09:19,330
That's how we'll deal with
environmental concerns.

4837
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:19,610
I.

4838
02:09:19,610 --> 02:09:20,020
Okay.

4839
02:09:20,020 --> 02:09:21,850
I like that education.

4840
02:09:22,090 --> 02:09:22,871
Let's be honest.

4841
02:09:22,871 --> 02:09:23,590
It's a mess,

4842
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:24,140
right?

4843
02:09:24,140 --> 02:09:24,340
The,

4844
02:09:24,340 --> 02:09:24,551
the,

4845
02:09:24,551 --> 02:09:24,761
the,

4846
02:09:24,761 --> 02:09:28,600
the levels of educations that we're
accepting for high school students is

4847
02:09:28,601 --> 02:09:29,710
absolutely ridiculous.

4848
02:09:29,830 --> 02:09:33,700
I agree that college educations
are insanely expensive.

4849
02:09:33,880 --> 02:09:35,530
The idea behind it is observed.

4850
02:09:35,650 --> 02:09:38,140
The idea that you can go to
school for x amount of years,

4851
02:09:38,141 --> 02:09:42,040
come out and be more in debt and you're
going to make it a decade of working

4852
02:09:42,041 --> 02:09:42,850
every fucking day.

4853
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:43,391
We also,

4854
02:09:43,391 --> 02:09:46,990
we also have to let young kids
off the hook for social security.

4855
02:09:46,991 --> 02:09:48,880
I mean they didn't vote
for this pricing scheme.

4856
02:09:48,881 --> 02:09:50,160
It was conceived before they.

4857
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:51,460
It is a Ponzi scheme.

4858
02:09:51,700 --> 02:09:52,440
That's all it is.

4859
02:09:52,440 --> 02:09:55,060
Like explain it to people who don't
understand because I've seen your

4860
02:09:55,061 --> 02:09:57,640
explanation to the social security
system and it's very enlightening because

4861
02:09:57,641 --> 02:09:58,770
it's disgusting what is.

4862
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:58,930
Yeah,

4863
02:09:58,930 --> 02:09:59,440
they ought to.

4864
02:09:59,440 --> 02:10:04,300
They ought to build a director statue
of Ponzi right into the lobby of the

4865
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:04,570
Social Security Administration.

4866
02:10:04,570 --> 02:10:05,260
But you know,

4867
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:08,590
social security was conceived and sold
to the American public as a complete

4868
02:10:08,591 --> 02:10:09,040
fraud.

4869
02:10:09,040 --> 02:10:09,251
Right?

4870
02:10:09,251 --> 02:10:10,480
The idea initially,

4871
02:10:10,481 --> 02:10:13,030
and the government deliberately
used this kind of language,

4872
02:10:13,270 --> 02:10:17,170
was that it was like insurance because
the taxes that you pay are called

4873
02:10:17,171 --> 02:10:18,270
premiums and and they're.

4874
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:20,410
And you're a beneficiary
and they have a trust fund,

4875
02:10:20,411 --> 02:10:20,740
right?

4876
02:10:20,740 --> 02:10:22,570
All this is what an
insurance company does,

4877
02:10:22,780 --> 02:10:24,940
but social security doesn't
have a real trust fund.

4878
02:10:25,150 --> 02:10:26,410
Nothing is invested.

4879
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:26,851
It's,

4880
02:10:26,851 --> 02:10:28,900
it's an intergenerational Ponzi scheme.

4881
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:31,690
What happened is people
paid into social security,

4882
02:10:31,720 --> 02:10:32,850
they paid social security taxes.

4883
02:10:32,851 --> 02:10:34,180
I get on the box on the rock

4884
02:10:34,180 --> 02:10:34,690
center rock.

4885
02:10:34,690 --> 02:10:35,270
Yeah.

4886
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:36,103
You're a gentleman.

4887
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:37,521
So people paid.

4888
02:10:37,521 --> 02:10:39,050
So Jack Daniels or what's the other stuff?

4889
02:10:39,080 --> 02:10:39,913
Check dams was fine.

4890
02:10:39,980 --> 02:10:40,813
Oh,

4891
02:10:41,960 --> 02:10:42,370
so,

4892
02:10:42,370 --> 02:10:43,070
um,

4893
02:10:43,070 --> 02:10:44,600
people paid social security taxes,

4894
02:10:44,810 --> 02:10:45,140
right?

4895
02:10:45,140 --> 02:10:46,370
And the government spent the money.

4896
02:10:46,640 --> 02:10:46,950
They didn't,

4897
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:48,030
they didn't invest in anything.

4898
02:10:48,060 --> 02:10:48,290
They did,

4899
02:10:48,290 --> 02:10:49,700
they didn't put it aside in a trust fund.

4900
02:10:49,701 --> 02:10:54,260
They just spend the money now as the
population grew and they kept raising the

4901
02:10:54,261 --> 02:10:57,380
task because originally it
was just a one percent tax,

4902
02:10:57,440 --> 02:10:57,830
right?

4903
02:10:57,830 --> 02:10:59,630
And it didn't affect self employed people.

4904
02:10:59,700 --> 02:11:00,190
Right?

4905
02:11:00,190 --> 02:11:01,760
So it,

4906
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,010
it didn't affect self employed people

4907
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:06,770
because the government said,

4908
02:11:06,771 --> 02:11:06,951
look,

4909
02:11:06,951 --> 02:11:08,750
if you're smart enough
to run your own business,

4910
02:11:08,751 --> 02:11:10,340
you're smart enough to save
for your own retirement.

4911
02:11:10,341 --> 02:11:14,660
So the government was supposedly going
after the average worker who wasn't going

4912
02:11:14,661 --> 02:11:15,441
to save any money.

4913
02:11:15,441 --> 02:11:15,711
So they said,

4914
02:11:15,711 --> 02:11:16,040
look,

4915
02:11:16,040 --> 02:11:17,270
we're going to save the money for you.

4916
02:11:17,271 --> 02:11:18,530
We're going to have a forced savings.

4917
02:11:18,740 --> 02:11:20,180
But of course the government
didn't save anything.

4918
02:11:20,181 --> 02:11:21,080
They spend every nickel.

4919
02:11:21,500 --> 02:11:23,240
But as the year,

4920
02:11:23,241 --> 02:11:24,320
as the years went by,

4921
02:11:24,321 --> 02:11:28,250
they kept increasing the payroll tax
and of course the population was growing

4922
02:11:28,550 --> 02:11:31,580
and so what the government does
is they tax young people and,

4923
02:11:31,670 --> 02:11:33,140
and pay off the older people.

4924
02:11:33,230 --> 02:11:35,270
And of course the older people they vote,

4925
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:35,571
right?

4926
02:11:35,571 --> 02:11:37,910
The most important thing to them
is their social security check.

4927
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:40,610
And so they vote for whoever
promises more benefits.

4928
02:11:40,611 --> 02:11:43,130
And so eventually they
got more goodies added on,

4929
02:11:43,240 --> 02:11:43,551
you know,

4930
02:11:43,551 --> 02:11:44,570
prescription drugs,

4931
02:11:44,571 --> 02:11:45,404
different things.

4932
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:47,990
But the young people now
are coming in at the end.

4933
02:11:48,170 --> 02:11:48,921
The people today,

4934
02:11:48,921 --> 02:11:50,180
generation x later,

4935
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:50,550
you know,

4936
02:11:50,550 --> 02:11:52,160
you are just holding the bag,

4937
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:54,650
you are at the end of the
chain letter or whatever it is.

4938
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:56,360
And we're paying people.

4939
02:11:56,361 --> 02:11:59,270
A lot of young people now pay more in
social security taxes and they pay in

4940
02:11:59,271 --> 02:11:59,900
income taxes.

4941
02:11:59,900 --> 02:12:02,440
And of course you pay
your employers have the,

4942
02:12:02,490 --> 02:12:05,690
the entire 15 percent comes
out of the employee's pocket,

4943
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,651
the employer,

4944
02:12:06,651 --> 02:12:08,320
just whatever money the employer,

4945
02:12:08,360 --> 02:12:11,720
your employer sends to the government
is the money that he would have sent you

4946
02:12:11,721 --> 02:12:12,770
if the tax wasn't there.

4947
02:12:13,050 --> 02:12:13,221
Right?

4948
02:12:13,221 --> 02:12:13,870
So you,

4949
02:12:13,870 --> 02:12:15,650
it's all part of the cost of labor,

4950
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:19,220
but the government did it this way so
that people wouldn't realize how expensive

4951
02:12:19,221 --> 02:12:20,054
the social security was,

4952
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:24,710
but there is absolutely no way that
someone in their twenties or thirties or

4953
02:12:24,711 --> 02:12:27,740
forties or even probably my
age 50 is going to collect.

4954
02:12:27,770 --> 02:12:29,000
This is gonna blow up.

4955
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:30,140
This is going to collapse.

4956
02:12:30,141 --> 02:12:33,020
So the sooner that we can level
with the public to better,

4957
02:12:33,021 --> 02:12:34,340
we got to end this thing.

4958
02:12:34,550 --> 02:12:36,800
We gotta we gotta stop
the Social Security Tax,

4959
02:12:37,010 --> 02:12:37,370
right?

4960
02:12:37,370 --> 02:12:41,300
Let the young people off the hook and
now we have to deal with the consequences

4961
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:42,410
of a failed system.

4962
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:44,120
I think we have to means test it.

4963
02:12:44,150 --> 02:12:46,670
I think we've got to
tell wealthier people,

4964
02:12:46,760 --> 02:12:47,170
hey,

4965
02:12:47,170 --> 02:12:47,710
you know,

4966
02:12:47,710 --> 02:12:48,120
you know,

4967
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:48,861
you basically.

4968
02:12:48,861 --> 02:12:49,281
What was that?

4969
02:12:49,281 --> 02:12:49,491
Uh,

4970
02:12:49,491 --> 02:12:50,060
um,

4971
02:12:50,060 --> 02:12:51,320
from a animal house,

4972
02:12:51,321 --> 02:12:51,441
hey,

4973
02:12:51,441 --> 02:12:52,011
you fucked up,

4974
02:12:52,011 --> 02:12:52,880
you trusted the government,

4975
02:12:52,881 --> 02:12:53,061
you know,

4976
02:12:53,061 --> 02:12:53,810
you're screwed.

4977
02:12:53,810 --> 02:12:54,200
You know,

4978
02:12:54,200 --> 02:12:56,240
the government made a bunch of
promises that it can't keep.

4979
02:12:56,270 --> 02:12:59,240
We're not going to steal from your
kids in order to make you whole.

4980
02:12:59,360 --> 02:13:00,920
So if you're rich,

4981
02:13:00,980 --> 02:13:02,570
if you have assets or income,

4982
02:13:02,870 --> 02:13:03,920
no social security check,

4983
02:13:04,010 --> 02:13:04,311
right?

4984
02:13:04,311 --> 02:13:07,100
Because we're not going to rob from the
young and the poor and give to the old

4985
02:13:07,101 --> 02:13:07,580
and the rich.

4986
02:13:07,580 --> 02:13:09,500
You were dumb enough to
vote for these policies,

4987
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:14,390
so deal with the consequences and I would
have an asset test and means test and

4988
02:13:14,391 --> 02:13:17,030
then if somebody is in dire situation,

4989
02:13:17,210 --> 02:13:20,030
maybe buy him some kind of a
minimal annuity or something.

4990
02:13:20,330 --> 02:13:20,541
Uh,

4991
02:13:20,541 --> 02:13:23,420
but we got to admit that social
security as well as welfare,

4992
02:13:23,450 --> 02:13:24,051
that's all it is.

4993
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:25,460
The money comes from the same pot.

4994
02:13:25,610 --> 02:13:29,120
Nobody paid into anything because whatever
money the government collected was

4995
02:13:29,121 --> 02:13:29,600
spent.

4996
02:13:29,600 --> 02:13:30,560
It's all gone.

4997
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:32,160
Now to play devil's advocate,

4998
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:36,480
the benefits of social security are
that some people that made a decent ways

4999
02:13:36,481 --> 02:13:37,051
their whole life,

5000
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:40,770
but live check to check would
someday be able to stop working.

5001
02:13:40,771 --> 02:13:40,910
No,

5002
02:13:40,910 --> 02:13:41,743
they're not.

5003
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:42,690
They're not going to.

5004
02:13:42,690 --> 02:13:44,040
What about people that
are doing it right now?

5005
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:44,630
Good.

5006
02:13:44,630 --> 02:13:45,660
There are people doing it now.

5007
02:13:45,661 --> 02:13:48,140
Just like any Ponzi scheme
or rather a chain letter,

5008
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:48,810
a pyramid.

5009
02:13:48,810 --> 02:13:51,810
There are people like the first
person that collected social security,

5010
02:13:51,811 --> 02:13:52,644
her name was.

5011
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:53,731
I'm a fuller,

5012
02:13:53,731 --> 02:13:54,564
I think,

5013
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:57,930
and she lived to be 100 years
old and she only paid in like,

5014
02:13:57,931 --> 02:13:58,171
I don't know,

5015
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:01,770
20 bucks in taxes and she
collected tens of thousands,

5016
02:14:01,771 --> 02:14:02,040
right?

5017
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:03,330
She made out like a Banshee,

5018
02:14:03,630 --> 02:14:04,170
right?

5019
02:14:04,170 --> 02:14:05,003
But you know,

5020
02:14:05,130 --> 02:14:06,510
it's the people that come in late,

5021
02:14:06,511 --> 02:14:07,344
he gets abandoned,

5022
02:14:07,740 --> 02:14:08,101
abandoned,

5023
02:14:08,101 --> 02:14:08,521
whatever it is,

5024
02:14:08,521 --> 02:14:09,300
but she made out,

5025
02:14:09,300 --> 02:14:09,541
right?

5026
02:14:09,541 --> 02:14:09,741
She,

5027
02:14:09,741 --> 02:14:09,970
you know,

5028
02:14:09,970 --> 02:14:10,920
she but,

5029
02:14:11,140 --> 02:14:12,180
but the reason that,

5030
02:14:12,210 --> 02:14:15,090
that pyramid schemes are illegal
is because they don't work,

5031
02:14:15,300 --> 02:14:15,540
right?

5032
02:14:15,540 --> 02:14:17,640
They benefit the people that
get in at the beginning,

5033
02:14:17,820 --> 02:14:19,860
at the expense of people
to get in at the end.

5034
02:14:20,130 --> 02:14:20,963
Well,

5035
02:14:21,060 --> 02:14:21,600
if a,

5036
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,800
if a pyramid doesn't work,

5037
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:23,580
it we,

5038
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:24,960
the government can't make it work.

5039
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:26,100
If the government runs it,

5040
02:14:26,101 --> 02:14:28,290
they're not going to be more
successful than the private sector.

5041
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:32,670
The only difference is when you know
people in a private sector figure out it's

5042
02:14:32,671 --> 02:14:33,504
a Ponzi scheme,

5043
02:14:33,540 --> 02:14:33,780
right?

5044
02:14:33,780 --> 02:14:36,120
But why didn't Bernie madoff's
Ponzi scheme fall apart?

5045
02:14:36,240 --> 02:14:38,160
Because when people realize
what the Ponzi scheme,

5046
02:14:38,161 --> 02:14:39,060
they wanted their money back.

5047
02:14:39,510 --> 02:14:41,100
Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.

5048
02:14:41,101 --> 02:14:45,750
You can't get out of the
government requires you to
participate at gunpoint and

5049
02:14:45,751 --> 02:14:47,130
even if you know it's a Ponzi scheme,

5050
02:14:47,310 --> 02:14:50,310
I'm paying social security taxes even
though I know it's a Ponzi scheme.

5051
02:14:50,410 --> 02:14:51,390
If it was a free market,

5052
02:14:51,391 --> 02:14:54,960
I wouldn't be paying and you will have
to be able to say whether or not you

5053
02:14:54,961 --> 02:14:56,910
wanted to contribute and benefit from it.

5054
02:14:57,110 --> 02:14:58,460
It's like an opt in.

5055
02:14:58,540 --> 02:14:59,580
If you have an opt in thing,

5056
02:14:59,581 --> 02:15:00,540
would you be willing?

5057
02:15:00,580 --> 02:15:01,590
I would opt right out.

5058
02:15:01,591 --> 02:15:02,490
I mean I would give up,

5059
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:03,081
but yeah,

5060
02:15:03,081 --> 02:15:03,260
but.

5061
02:15:03,260 --> 02:15:03,841
But first of all,

5062
02:15:03,841 --> 02:15:05,340
but I don't even think the government.

5063
02:15:05,550 --> 02:15:07,950
Why is the government
involved in social security?

5064
02:15:07,951 --> 02:15:10,470
There's nothing in the constitution that
gives the government the authority to

5065
02:15:10,471 --> 02:15:11,160
take care of this.

5066
02:15:11,160 --> 02:15:11,371
Look.

5067
02:15:11,371 --> 02:15:13,470
If I want to buy
insurance from my old age,

5068
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:14,910
let me buy it in the private sector.

5069
02:15:15,080 --> 02:15:18,230
I mean know and let me
save on my own money.

5070
02:15:18,231 --> 02:15:18,530
Go.

5071
02:15:18,530 --> 02:15:19,710
Where does most of the
money go when you do,

5072
02:15:19,711 --> 02:15:20,610
but when you buy insurance?

5073
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:21,241
Well,

5074
02:15:21,241 --> 02:15:22,800
if you buy legitimate insurance,

5075
02:15:22,950 --> 02:15:26,910
the money is invested and it grows so
that when you that he could pay off

5076
02:15:26,911 --> 02:15:28,410
whether you're buying a life insurance,

5077
02:15:28,411 --> 02:15:29,340
fire insurance,

5078
02:15:29,580 --> 02:15:33,020
auto insurance companies invest the
money and you know some people putting

5079
02:15:33,030 --> 02:15:33,391
claims,

5080
02:15:33,391 --> 02:15:34,200
other people don't,

5081
02:15:34,200 --> 02:15:35,280
but for retirement,

5082
02:15:35,430 --> 02:15:38,400
a funded pension system
are legitimate system.

5083
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:42,030
You take money as you
work and you invest it,

5084
02:15:42,720 --> 02:15:47,720
and over time compounding interest or the
investment returns eventually you know

5085
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:51,780
based on your contributions and the gains
and the reinvestment of the interest

5086
02:15:51,781 --> 02:15:52,614
and the dividends.

5087
02:15:52,650 --> 02:15:56,580
You accumulated a portfolio of stocks
and bonds or whatever real estate,

5088
02:15:56,581 --> 02:15:57,414
whatever you bought,

5089
02:15:57,660 --> 02:15:58,500
but you can live on,

5090
02:15:58,501 --> 02:16:01,140
you can live off of your
income from your investments.

5091
02:16:01,170 --> 02:16:01,291
Now,

5092
02:16:01,291 --> 02:16:03,780
how is that different than how
social security handles it?

5093
02:16:03,810 --> 02:16:05,580
So secure happens when your
money goes into social,

5094
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:06,300
they spend it,

5095
02:16:06,300 --> 02:16:08,820
the government spends it on
current social security recipients.

5096
02:16:08,821 --> 02:16:11,460
They spend it on the war
in Iraq or Afghanistan,

5097
02:16:11,461 --> 02:16:12,270
wherever they are.

5098
02:16:12,270 --> 02:16:14,700
They spend it on the war on
drugs that were on poverty.

5099
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:16,860
So it's totally speculative
because we don't get a receipt,

5100
02:16:16,990 --> 02:16:17,910
but there's nothing there.

5101
02:16:17,970 --> 02:16:20,520
But there's also what you're
spending on what we call it,

5102
02:16:20,540 --> 02:16:21,090
just a bunch of.

5103
02:16:21,090 --> 02:16:21,360
Yeah.

5104
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,910
But there's also no
return because there's no.

5105
02:16:24,120 --> 02:16:25,080
There's no compound.

5106
02:16:25,100 --> 02:16:25,280
You,

5107
02:16:25,280 --> 02:16:25,481
you don't,

5108
02:16:25,481 --> 02:16:26,550
you don't generate anything.

5109
02:16:26,700 --> 02:16:30,430
And so the only way the government can
pay you the money when you retire is if

5110
02:16:30,431 --> 02:16:31,930
they get and get it from somebody else.

5111
02:16:32,350 --> 02:16:33,220
But you know,

5112
02:16:33,340 --> 02:16:34,930
how is the baby bust,

5113
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:35,680
right?

5114
02:16:35,680 --> 02:16:38,740
Generation x going to pay for
the retirement of the baby boom.

5115
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:39,820
It's impossible.

5116
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:40,893
I mean they don't even.

5117
02:16:40,900 --> 02:16:42,400
I mean they don't have the incomes.

5118
02:16:42,460 --> 02:16:43,990
They're loaded up with debt themselves.

5119
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:45,640
If you've got a bunch of college debt,

5120
02:16:45,870 --> 02:16:46,151
how are,

5121
02:16:46,151 --> 02:16:46,450
you know,

5122
02:16:46,450 --> 02:16:47,440
not only do you have to pay that,

5123
02:16:47,441 --> 02:16:50,140
but you got to pay somebody social
security and their medicare,

5124
02:16:50,230 --> 02:16:50,650
you know,

5125
02:16:50,650 --> 02:16:51,730
it is impossible.

5126
02:16:51,731 --> 02:16:55,870
So we've got to admit the policies have
to admit all the false promises that

5127
02:16:55,871 --> 02:16:57,370
they made in order to buy votes,

5128
02:16:57,430 --> 02:16:57,730
right?

5129
02:16:57,730 --> 02:16:58,331
That's what they do.

5130
02:16:58,331 --> 02:17:01,290
They promise something for nothing
because that's what people vote for.

5131
02:17:01,330 --> 02:17:02,710
People are dumb enough to do that.

5132
02:17:02,800 --> 02:17:04,150
They vote for something for nothing,

5133
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:05,230
but you know,

5134
02:17:05,230 --> 02:17:07,720
there's nothing more expensive than
something you get for free from the

5135
02:17:07,721 --> 02:17:11,290
government and we're going to find out
just how expensive all this free stuff

5136
02:17:11,291 --> 02:17:11,561
is.

5137
02:17:11,561 --> 02:17:14,100
But we got to level with people and said,

5138
02:17:14,101 --> 02:17:14,291
look,

5139
02:17:14,291 --> 02:17:15,010
you know,

5140
02:17:15,010 --> 02:17:16,240
there is no trust fund,

5141
02:17:16,241 --> 02:17:17,470
there is no money there.

5142
02:17:17,770 --> 02:17:19,690
And so let's end the program.

5143
02:17:19,720 --> 02:17:20,553
Let's stop it,

5144
02:17:20,800 --> 02:17:21,071
let's,

5145
02:17:21,071 --> 02:17:21,580
you know,

5146
02:17:21,580 --> 02:17:24,340
and then let's figure
out how to deal with,

5147
02:17:24,360 --> 02:17:24,650
uh,

5148
02:17:24,650 --> 02:17:28,000
the people who unfortunately now because
of this program now depend on this

5149
02:17:28,001 --> 02:17:28,391
program,

5150
02:17:28,391 --> 02:17:31,300
but who would have been self sufficient
if the government had let them plan for

5151
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:34,150
their own retirement and also deal with
the unemployment and all the people that

5152
02:17:34,151 --> 02:17:35,680
worked in the various organizations.

5153
02:17:35,710 --> 02:17:35,861
Well,

5154
02:17:35,861 --> 02:17:35,981
no,

5155
02:17:35,981 --> 02:17:36,160
no,

5156
02:17:36,160 --> 02:17:36,671
that's good.

5157
02:17:36,671 --> 02:17:37,330
Unemployment does.

5158
02:17:37,330 --> 02:17:39,000
They're going to get jobs because.

5159
02:17:39,580 --> 02:17:40,031
Yes,

5160
02:17:40,031 --> 02:17:43,330
because if we get rid of all these
government rules and regulations,

5161
02:17:43,331 --> 02:17:44,350
there will be jobs for them.

5162
02:17:44,560 --> 02:17:44,871
I don't,

5163
02:17:44,871 --> 02:17:47,920
I don't want them working in government
because now I have to pay their salary

5164
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:49,360
if they work in the private sector.

5165
02:17:49,361 --> 02:17:49,841
I don't,

5166
02:17:49,841 --> 02:17:51,580
I don't want to employ
all these bureaucrats,

5167
02:17:51,850 --> 02:17:52,061
you know,

5168
02:17:52,061 --> 02:17:55,120
especially when the average bureaucrat
is making more than the average person

5169
02:17:55,121 --> 02:17:57,370
who's paying the taxes
that pay the bureaucrats,

5170
02:17:57,450 --> 02:17:57,850
you know,

5171
02:17:57,850 --> 02:17:59,480
and they just gave
everybody in Washington.

5172
02:17:59,481 --> 02:17:59,620
Oh,

5173
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:00,670
one percent pay raise.

5174
02:18:00,850 --> 02:18:01,780
Who can afford that?

5175
02:18:01,910 --> 02:18:03,670
I mean they should be
given these guys pay cuts,

5176
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:05,020
but part of the deal,

5177
02:18:05,140 --> 02:18:05,440
uh,

5178
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:08,740
to fund the government was to give
everybody a raise in Washington.

5179
02:18:08,850 --> 02:18:09,850
They're already overpaid.

5180
02:18:09,880 --> 02:18:10,571
Excellent arguments.

5181
02:18:10,571 --> 02:18:12,090
So Department of energy dead,

5182
02:18:12,400 --> 02:18:13,690
Department of Education,

5183
02:18:13,720 --> 02:18:15,130
gone social security.

5184
02:18:15,131 --> 02:18:16,060
Go Fuck Yourself.

5185
02:18:16,210 --> 02:18:17,050
What do we have left?

5186
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:17,850
How do we deal with.

5187
02:18:17,850 --> 02:18:17,940
Well,

5188
02:18:17,940 --> 02:18:19,720
you got to cut the fence massively.

5189
02:18:19,750 --> 02:18:20,650
That's the next question.

5190
02:18:20,651 --> 02:18:20,711
Yeah.

5191
02:18:20,711 --> 02:18:20,831
Well,

5192
02:18:20,831 --> 02:18:24,340
the problem with the military is it's
not the department of Defense now it's

5193
02:18:24,341 --> 02:18:25,360
department of offense,

5194
02:18:25,630 --> 02:18:26,463
right?

5195
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:26,860
You know,

5196
02:18:26,860 --> 02:18:28,930
what we need to do is minor own business,

5197
02:18:29,020 --> 02:18:29,470
right?

5198
02:18:29,470 --> 02:18:32,980
We need to stop stirring up Hornet's
nest and then being surprised when we get

5199
02:18:32,981 --> 02:18:33,281
stung.

5200
02:18:33,281 --> 02:18:33,970
So Peter Schiff,

5201
02:18:33,970 --> 02:18:35,020
freedom and free though,

5202
02:18:35,110 --> 02:18:35,880
don't you know,

5203
02:18:35,880 --> 02:18:36,730
do you know?

5204
02:18:36,820 --> 02:18:38,410
I'm not saying that we're not vigilant.

5205
02:18:38,650 --> 02:18:41,430
I want to have a military that's strong
enough that nobody's going to want to

5206
02:18:41,431 --> 02:18:42,070
screw with us,

5207
02:18:42,070 --> 02:18:42,541
and we bought.

5208
02:18:42,541 --> 02:18:43,930
We've got that many times over.

5209
02:18:43,931 --> 02:18:44,530
In fact,

5210
02:18:44,530 --> 02:18:46,060
all we're doing is instigating,

5211
02:18:46,270 --> 02:18:49,270
if we just mind our own business
and protected our own borders,

5212
02:18:49,390 --> 02:18:49,870
right?

5213
02:18:49,870 --> 02:18:50,720
No one who's going to,

5214
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:54,100
who's going to be dumb
enough to attack America?

5215
02:18:54,190 --> 02:18:55,030
I mean in a real way.

5216
02:18:55,031 --> 02:18:56,230
I mean a terrorist.

5217
02:18:56,290 --> 02:18:56,680
Okay,

5218
02:18:56,680 --> 02:18:58,900
but what nation is going to launch a war?

5219
02:18:59,080 --> 02:18:59,591
Nobody.

5220
02:18:59,591 --> 02:19:00,660
I mean did this.

5221
02:19:00,670 --> 02:19:01,540
There is no threat.

5222
02:19:01,570 --> 02:19:02,620
This is ridiculous,

5223
02:19:03,020 --> 02:19:07,300
but we are creating threats that
wouldn't exist if we had a more defensive

5224
02:19:07,301 --> 02:19:07,930
posture.

5225
02:19:07,930 --> 02:19:09,940
Why do we have all these
bases all over Europe?

5226
02:19:10,030 --> 02:19:10,420
I mean,

5227
02:19:10,420 --> 02:19:11,590
the Soviet Union is gone.

5228
02:19:12,190 --> 02:19:12,841
This is the problem.

5229
02:19:12,841 --> 02:19:14,500
It's like once you create
a government department,

5230
02:19:14,501 --> 02:19:15,370
they never go away.

5231
02:19:15,490 --> 02:19:16,860
So we have all this,

5232
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:17,890
this NATO.

5233
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:22,420
We built up all this stuff in
Europe because of the Soviet Union.

5234
02:19:22,780 --> 02:19:23,650
Soviet Union is gone.

5235
02:19:23,680 --> 02:19:24,940
Why are all the basis still there?

5236
02:19:25,030 --> 02:19:26,230
Where all the troops still there?

5237
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:27,093
This is,

5238
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:28,310
this was all government

5239
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:30,770
bureaucracy just perpetuating itself.

5240
02:19:30,771 --> 02:19:31,110
I mean,

5241
02:19:31,110 --> 02:19:31,350
we,

5242
02:19:31,350 --> 02:19:32,360
we can't even afford it,

5243
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:32,721
you know,

5244
02:19:32,721 --> 02:19:34,320
but we got it.

5245
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:36,260
If Europe wants our troops there,

5246
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:37,310
then let's invoice them.

5247
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:37,671
Let's say,

5248
02:19:37,671 --> 02:19:38,240
you know what?

5249
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:39,590
We got all these troops in Germany,

5250
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:42,170
this is what it's gonna cost you to
Germany to keep these troops there if you

5251
02:19:42,171 --> 02:19:42,980
think you need them.

5252
02:19:42,980 --> 02:19:45,110
If you don't want them then
we're going home and you know,

5253
02:19:45,230 --> 02:19:46,190
but that's what we need to do.

5254
02:19:46,191 --> 02:19:46,610
We need that.

5255
02:19:46,610 --> 02:19:49,250
We need to dramatically reduce what
we're spending on the military.

5256
02:19:49,251 --> 02:19:53,540
But I think the military should be a
much higher percentage of the federal

5257
02:19:53,541 --> 02:19:54,620
budget than it is today,

5258
02:19:54,860 --> 02:19:55,011
you know,

5259
02:19:55,011 --> 02:19:56,890
because that's what the federal
government should be doing.

5260
02:19:57,170 --> 02:19:59,180
Protecting us from foreigners.

5261
02:19:59,181 --> 02:20:02,270
Let the state governments
protect us from local criminals.

5262
02:20:02,390 --> 02:20:04,970
Let the federal government protect
us from international criminals.

5263
02:20:05,150 --> 02:20:06,080
But that's it.

5264
02:20:06,350 --> 02:20:06,890
But you know,

5265
02:20:06,890 --> 02:20:09,530
right now the government is doing all
these things that it shouldn't do,

5266
02:20:09,560 --> 02:20:12,950
that it can't even do the things that
it's supposed to do it effectively.

5267
02:20:13,660 --> 02:20:17,620
Now when you hear like the Eisenhower
speech when he was leaving office and he

5268
02:20:17,621 --> 02:20:19,660
warned of the military industrial complex,

5269
02:20:19,750 --> 02:20:21,720
that's essentially what
he was warning us about.

5270
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:26,770
The business has arisen that profits off
of war and once it becomes big like any

5271
02:20:28,631 --> 02:20:30,430
bureaucratic institution like any,

5272
02:20:30,610 --> 02:20:34,240
any gigantic corporation like anything
that has too much power and influence.

5273
02:20:34,690 --> 02:20:34,871
Yeah.

5274
02:20:34,871 --> 02:20:35,130
Look,

5275
02:20:35,130 --> 02:20:37,450
we were the warfare state
where the welfare state,

5276
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:38,620
all of that has to end.

5277
02:20:38,650 --> 02:20:39,040
You know,

5278
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:41,050
I don't want the guns or
the butter from government.

5279
02:20:41,080 --> 02:20:41,261
Right?

5280
02:20:41,261 --> 02:20:42,100
I want the freedom.

5281
02:20:42,250 --> 02:20:44,200
I just want government to secure liberty.

5282
02:20:44,201 --> 02:20:44,840
That's why it's.

5283
02:20:44,840 --> 02:20:47,370
They're so large enough.

5284
02:20:47,430 --> 02:20:49,330
Percentage of money goes towards defense,

5285
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:51,460
but less but less money.

5286
02:20:51,490 --> 02:20:52,323
A lot less.

5287
02:20:52,450 --> 02:20:53,510
How much less model?

5288
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:53,930
No,

5289
02:20:53,930 --> 02:20:56,470
but I mean either we're going to
run this motherfucker correctly,

5290
02:20:56,471 --> 02:20:58,890
but you don't have to sit down and
here's what I'd like to do right

5291
02:20:59,020 --> 02:20:59,430
at the,

5292
02:20:59,430 --> 02:20:59,850
at the,

5293
02:20:59,850 --> 02:21:01,630
at the turn of the 19th century,

5294
02:21:01,631 --> 02:21:02,700
so in 1900,

5295
02:21:02,710 --> 02:21:03,543
19 slash 11,

5296
02:21:03,880 --> 02:21:04,713
the government,

5297
02:21:04,750 --> 02:21:05,411
federal government,

5298
02:21:05,411 --> 02:21:06,190
state government,

5299
02:21:06,190 --> 02:21:07,023
local government,

5300
02:21:07,150 --> 02:21:11,530
collectively all the government
was five percent of our GDP right

5301
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:13,380
now was this 1900.

5302
02:21:14,180 --> 02:21:14,701
What the fuck?

5303
02:21:14,701 --> 02:21:16,550
They didn't have the Internet TV,

5304
02:21:17,090 --> 02:21:18,200
the gum children.

5305
02:21:18,300 --> 02:21:19,560
That should make it gardening children.

5306
02:21:19,561 --> 02:21:19,680
Right?

5307
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:20,490
But let's double it.

5308
02:21:20,490 --> 02:21:21,040
Let's let it go.

5309
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:23,020
Let's let the government be
10 percent of the economy.

5310
02:21:23,080 --> 02:21:24,670
So let's just start slashing it.

5311
02:21:24,900 --> 02:21:25,110
No,

5312
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:26,560
we have too much government.

5313
02:21:26,660 --> 02:21:27,100
Remember,

5314
02:21:27,100 --> 02:21:27,970
the more government you have,

5315
02:21:27,971 --> 02:21:28,840
the less freedom you have.

5316
02:21:29,050 --> 02:21:31,780
Everybody is focusing on what
can I get from government?

5317
02:21:31,900 --> 02:21:32,830
The government doesn't give.

5318
02:21:32,831 --> 02:21:33,700
It has to take.

5319
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:36,160
If it gives to one person has
to take from somebody else.

5320
02:21:36,310 --> 02:21:39,250
If it legislates a special
privilege for one person,

5321
02:21:39,370 --> 02:21:41,920
it's imposing an obligation on
somebody else to pay for it.

5322
02:21:42,100 --> 02:21:43,000
That's not freedom.

5323
02:21:43,360 --> 02:21:43,840
Okay,

5324
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,070
so what's next?

5325
02:21:45,250 --> 02:21:45,821
The government.

5326
02:21:45,821 --> 02:21:46,220
We,

5327
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:46,371
we,

5328
02:21:46,371 --> 02:21:47,350
we set up that.

5329
02:21:47,351 --> 02:21:48,610
We're going to get rid of energy.

5330
02:21:48,611 --> 02:21:50,050
We're going to get rid of education.

5331
02:21:50,051 --> 02:21:51,990
We're going to get rid of change.

5332
02:21:52,060 --> 02:21:54,190
Alter the way we deal with defense.

5333
02:21:54,250 --> 02:21:55,360
Make it actually defense,

5334
02:21:55,361 --> 02:21:56,230
not offense.

5335
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:57,610
We're down to how many,

5336
02:21:57,640 --> 02:22:01,120
what percentage of the economy
with eliminating the government.

5337
02:22:01,180 --> 02:22:02,830
We've got to eliminate most
of the federal government,

5338
02:22:03,130 --> 02:22:03,880
the federal government,

5339
02:22:03,880 --> 02:22:04,421
the benefit.

5340
02:22:04,421 --> 02:22:05,200
What do we need though?

5341
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:05,741
What do we need?

5342
02:22:05,741 --> 02:22:06,311
What's important?

5343
02:22:06,311 --> 02:22:07,091
Not much nationals,

5344
02:22:07,091 --> 02:22:07,660
the fence,

5345
02:22:07,660 --> 02:22:08,111
that's it.

5346
02:22:08,111 --> 02:22:13,111
Just too much run by military
people kind to fight phrases like,

5347
02:22:13,511 --> 02:22:13,810
I mean,

5348
02:22:13,810 --> 02:22:14,051
you know,

5349
02:22:14,051 --> 02:22:14,980
obviously there's some,

5350
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:16,780
there's foreign embassies we can maintain.

5351
02:22:16,781 --> 02:22:18,250
There's certain things that we could do,

5352
02:22:18,910 --> 02:22:19,511
but if we,

5353
02:22:19,511 --> 02:22:20,590
if we do this right,

5354
02:22:20,591 --> 02:22:21,424
fixing the roads,

5355
02:22:21,490 --> 02:22:22,241
but that's local.

5356
02:22:22,241 --> 02:22:23,680
The federal government got
nothing to do with the roads.

5357
02:22:23,690 --> 02:22:26,070
I mean they know is that
they have to take the money

5358
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:28,860
out of the states and the federal aid.

5359
02:22:28,890 --> 02:22:29,101
Right?

5360
02:22:29,101 --> 02:22:32,070
And just like trying to give yourself a
blood transfusion from your right arm to

5361
02:22:32,071 --> 02:22:34,260
your left arm and you spill
half the blood on the floor.

5362
02:22:34,530 --> 02:22:35,640
There's no point in doing it.

5363
02:22:35,940 --> 02:22:36,570
If we just,

5364
02:22:36,570 --> 02:22:38,250
if we could eliminate
the federal government.

5365
02:22:38,251 --> 02:22:39,084
Think about this.

5366
02:22:39,210 --> 02:22:40,590
If here people in California,

5367
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:43,590
if no one in California had
to pay federal income taxes,

5368
02:22:43,650 --> 02:22:45,420
if no one had to pay
social security taxes,

5369
02:22:45,480 --> 02:22:45,840
right?

5370
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,220
How much more money would be here?

5371
02:22:47,310 --> 02:22:47,660
I mean,

5372
02:22:47,660 --> 02:22:50,970
we can deal with problems if you didn't
have to send all the money to Washington

5373
02:22:51,180 --> 02:22:52,350
and beg for it back,

5374
02:22:52,560 --> 02:22:52,801
you know,

5375
02:22:52,801 --> 02:22:54,660
and it always comes back
with strings attached,

5376
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:55,370
you know?

5377
02:22:55,370 --> 02:22:57,510
And you look at these states
now like Colorado where they,

5378
02:22:57,511 --> 02:22:57,721
you know,

5379
02:22:57,721 --> 02:23:01,040
they legalize marijuana but not what's
just coming back to this fucking book.

5380
02:23:01,710 --> 02:23:03,120
But what's the federal government doing?

5381
02:23:03,150 --> 02:23:06,960
The federal government is making it
impossible for a guy that opens up a store

5382
02:23:06,961 --> 02:23:07,441
to sell matter.

5383
02:23:07,441 --> 02:23:07,800
Rhonda,

5384
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:10,500
he can't have a bank account because the
banks are afraid of money laundering.

5385
02:23:10,650 --> 02:23:11,760
He can't rent an office.

5386
02:23:11,840 --> 02:23:14,040
You can't rent a storefront
because of the forfeiture.

5387
02:23:14,041 --> 02:23:16,170
Largely if the government's to
come in and seize his property.

5388
02:23:16,290 --> 02:23:18,900
I mean the government is federal
governance trampling all over us.

5389
02:23:18,901 --> 02:23:19,141
I mean,

5390
02:23:19,141 --> 02:23:21,930
we fought a revolution to get
away from that kind of stuff.

5391
02:23:21,931 --> 02:23:22,260
I mean,

5392
02:23:22,260 --> 02:23:25,110
and now Washington treats
us much worse than,

5393
02:23:25,170 --> 02:23:26,010
than the British did.

5394
02:23:26,011 --> 02:23:27,990
I mean King George never could
have got away with this stuff.

5395
02:23:28,170 --> 02:23:29,010
If this is the case,

5396
02:23:29,011 --> 02:23:31,710
should we actually be hoping
that everything falls apart?

5397
02:23:31,711 --> 02:23:32,251
Because in fact,

5398
02:23:32,251 --> 02:23:33,790
that might be the only
way that all this case,

5399
02:23:33,800 --> 02:23:34,560
ironically.

5400
02:23:34,560 --> 02:23:35,251
Ironically.

5401
02:23:35,251 --> 02:23:35,790
Yeah,

5402
02:23:35,790 --> 02:23:36,623
because you know,

5403
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:38,370
the thing is it's gonna fall apart,

5404
02:23:38,460 --> 02:23:39,000
right?

5405
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:39,833
Eventually,

5406
02:23:40,200 --> 02:23:41,190
the sooner the better it gets,

5407
02:23:41,191 --> 02:23:42,001
the longer it takes,

5408
02:23:42,001 --> 02:23:44,430
the worst that's going to
be because we are getting,

5409
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:45,443
you know,

5410
02:23:45,570 --> 02:23:45,820
we're,

5411
02:23:45,820 --> 02:23:45,990
we're,

5412
02:23:45,990 --> 02:23:46,221
we're,

5413
02:23:46,221 --> 02:23:48,450
we're digging ourselves into
a deeper hole every day,

5414
02:23:48,690 --> 02:23:49,110
right?

5415
02:23:49,110 --> 02:23:51,540
The sooner that the
phony economy collapses,

5416
02:23:51,541 --> 02:23:55,200
the sooner we can start replacing it
and building the legitimate economy.

5417
02:23:55,410 --> 02:23:56,040
So yeah,

5418
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:56,230
the,

5419
02:23:56,230 --> 02:23:56,560
the,

5420
02:23:56,560 --> 02:23:56,810
I,

5421
02:23:56,810 --> 02:23:59,190
I know this huge economic crash is coming.

5422
02:23:59,191 --> 02:24:00,810
That's way worse in 2008.

5423
02:24:01,260 --> 02:24:03,060
If it happens in 2014,

5424
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:07,470
it won't be as bad as if it happens
in 2015 and if it happens in 2016,

5425
02:24:07,471 --> 02:24:10,470
well that's even worse than 2015 because
we're going to have that much more

5426
02:24:10,471 --> 02:24:11,170
debt.

5427
02:24:11,170 --> 02:24:13,050
It's going to be that much bigger bubble.

5428
02:24:13,110 --> 02:24:13,950
The bigger the bubble,

5429
02:24:14,010 --> 02:24:14,281
you know,

5430
02:24:14,281 --> 02:24:15,660
the bigger the fallout when it burst.

5431
02:24:15,661 --> 02:24:18,330
So the sooner we can stop
doing the wrong thing,

5432
02:24:18,510 --> 02:24:20,040
the sooner we can start
doing the right thing.

5433
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:21,750
So explain to me how it does collapse.

5434
02:24:21,750 --> 02:24:23,910
So let's say worst case scenario,

5435
02:24:23,911 --> 02:24:26,310
it goes to shit in 2016.

5436
02:24:26,311 --> 02:24:29,640
It survives in another couple of
years limping along with bandaids on.

5437
02:24:29,641 --> 02:24:31,320
And then one day it implodes.

5438
02:24:31,770 --> 02:24:32,311
What happened?

5439
02:24:32,311 --> 02:24:32,401
Well,

5440
02:24:32,401 --> 02:24:34,980
this is my best guess for
how it's going to happen,

5441
02:24:34,981 --> 02:24:35,161
right?

5442
02:24:35,161 --> 02:24:36,040
So the,

5443
02:24:36,180 --> 02:24:36,450
the,

5444
02:24:36,450 --> 02:24:40,050
the economic data is going to start to
come out weaker than a lot of people

5445
02:24:40,051 --> 02:24:40,321
think.

5446
02:24:40,321 --> 02:24:42,300
I think the jobs numbers
are going to deteriorate.

5447
02:24:42,301 --> 02:24:43,880
And of course they never really improved.

5448
02:24:43,940 --> 02:24:46,020
Mean the reason the
unemployment rate has come down,

5449
02:24:46,410 --> 02:24:49,170
it stopped because the unemployed have
found jobs is because they've stopped

5450
02:24:49,171 --> 02:24:49,501
looking.

5451
02:24:49,501 --> 02:24:52,860
They've left the labor force and now
they're collecting disability checks

5452
02:24:52,861 --> 02:24:53,940
instead of unemployment checks.

5453
02:24:53,941 --> 02:24:54,950
But the,

5454
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:55,250
the,

5455
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:56,760
the numbers are going to get worse.

5456
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:58,920
Janet Yellen is going to be,

5457
02:24:58,921 --> 02:24:59,250
uh,

5458
02:24:59,250 --> 02:25:04,250
the Fed chairman and she is going to
prescribe more quantitative using and so

5459
02:25:04,861 --> 02:25:08,640
they're going to reverse this tapering
process and they're going to do more,

5460
02:25:08,790 --> 02:25:09,990
more quantitative easing.

5461
02:25:10,290 --> 02:25:14,550
Now everybody is assuming that
the Fed is going to continue to,

5462
02:25:14,570 --> 02:25:15,290
uh,

5463
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:19,170
to reduce these purchases and
eventually unwind their balance sheet.

5464
02:25:19,171 --> 02:25:20,310
And of course that's impossible.

5465
02:25:20,311 --> 02:25:24,340
I was saying that from the beginning
that you know there was no exit strategy,

5466
02:25:24,341 --> 02:25:27,670
that it was a lie that they had checked
into a monetary roach motel that you

5467
02:25:27,671 --> 02:25:28,060
know,

5468
02:25:28,060 --> 02:25:30,100
once they had committed
to this that it was,

5469
02:25:30,270 --> 02:25:30,600
you know,

5470
02:25:30,600 --> 02:25:32,700
they couldn't stop and if you live by Qe,

5471
02:25:32,701 --> 02:25:35,650
you die by Qe and so the Fed is
going to come in and they're,

5472
02:25:35,651 --> 02:25:37,270
they're going to do more
quantitative easing,

5473
02:25:37,271 --> 02:25:40,570
they're going to print more money to
try to bring interest rates back down to

5474
02:25:40,571 --> 02:25:42,430
try to artificially stimulate the economy.

5475
02:25:42,790 --> 02:25:46,450
But the market is expecting to
reverse to happen and as a result,

5476
02:25:46,451 --> 02:25:47,800
the dollar has risen a little bit.

5477
02:25:47,830 --> 02:25:49,120
Gold price have come down,

5478
02:25:49,121 --> 02:25:52,270
markets come up because people are
optimistic about a legitimate recovery.

5479
02:25:52,540 --> 02:25:56,050
When they realized that it was false
optimism and that the Fed is going to do

5480
02:25:56,051 --> 02:25:59,050
even more monetary stimulus because
none of the other stimulus worked.

5481
02:25:59,170 --> 02:25:59,411
Right?

5482
02:25:59,411 --> 02:26:00,520
And that's what they do in Washington.

5483
02:26:00,790 --> 02:26:01,870
If something doesn't work,

5484
02:26:02,050 --> 02:26:03,010
you don't reevaluate,

5485
02:26:03,011 --> 02:26:06,040
you just do more of it and just assume
it will work if you do it bigger.

5486
02:26:06,310 --> 02:26:07,570
So I think when that happens,

5487
02:26:08,050 --> 02:26:11,320
you're going to see a lot of
downward pressure on the dollar,

5488
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:13,810
it's going to really start to
fall out foreign exchange markets,

5489
02:26:13,990 --> 02:26:17,800
and that's going to have a
profound impact on consumer prices,

5490
02:26:18,070 --> 02:26:19,090
price of gasoline,

5491
02:26:19,091 --> 02:26:19,751
price of food,

5492
02:26:19,751 --> 02:26:20,584
stuff like that.

5493
02:26:20,740 --> 02:26:23,800
And now the Fed is going to
be looking at CPI inflation,

5494
02:26:23,801 --> 02:26:26,170
which is much higher
than it should tolerate,

5495
02:26:26,980 --> 02:26:28,210
but the Fed can't do anything.

5496
02:26:28,240 --> 02:26:31,000
This is the Fed raises interest
rates to fight that inflation.

5497
02:26:31,450 --> 02:26:32,770
The stock market will crash,

5498
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:36,010
the real estate market will crash and
all the big banks that we bailed out are

5499
02:26:36,011 --> 02:26:36,820
going to fail again.

5500
02:26:36,820 --> 02:26:38,350
Only now they're going
to have even more debt.

5501
02:26:38,470 --> 02:26:41,260
So we'll be at an even worse
financial crisis in 2008.

5502
02:26:41,380 --> 02:26:42,820
So the Fed can't let that happen.

5503
02:26:42,940 --> 02:26:44,380
So they got to print even more money,

5504
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:46,480
but now the dollar goes down even more.

5505
02:26:46,481 --> 02:26:47,950
And now inflation is even bigger.

5506
02:26:48,220 --> 02:26:51,370
And maybe for a while the government
will try to convince us that inflation is

5507
02:26:51,371 --> 02:26:54,460
good for us and that we should be happy
because at least we're not suffering

5508
02:26:54,461 --> 02:26:55,294
deflation.

5509
02:26:55,490 --> 02:26:55,690
Uh,

5510
02:26:55,690 --> 02:27:00,250
but at some point you're going to reach
a critical point where the Fed is going

5511
02:27:00,251 --> 02:27:03,880
to have to either dramatically raise
interest rates to protect the dollar and

5512
02:27:03,881 --> 02:27:08,380
stop hyperinflation and allow the
markets to implode and allow a much worse

5513
02:27:08,381 --> 02:27:12,490
financial crisis in 2008 or they're going
to keep printing the dollar until they

5514
02:27:12,491 --> 02:27:14,590
printed into oblivion
and then it's worthless.

5515
02:27:14,591 --> 02:27:14,921
And then,

5516
02:27:14,921 --> 02:27:15,130
you know,

5517
02:27:15,130 --> 02:27:18,070
everybody is wiped out because no
matter how much money you have,

5518
02:27:18,130 --> 02:27:18,410
you know,

5519
02:27:18,410 --> 02:27:18,720
you,

5520
02:27:18,720 --> 02:27:19,201
you know,

5521
02:27:19,201 --> 02:27:22,270
you don't even have enough money to buy
a cup of coffee because the currency has

5522
02:27:22,271 --> 02:27:23,104
been wiped out.

5523
02:27:23,400 --> 02:27:24,540
Now when you deal with currency,

5524
02:27:24,541 --> 02:27:26,190
this is where it gets
really weird with people.

5525
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:29,370
Most people don't even understand
what a dollar bill actually is.

5526
02:27:29,371 --> 02:27:29,850
And the,

5527
02:27:29,850 --> 02:27:31,230
they think somehow or another,

5528
02:27:31,231 --> 02:27:33,360
a lot of people think that
it's based on something.

5529
02:27:33,510 --> 02:27:37,410
Not that there's like a pound of gold
waiting somewhere for $100 bill or

5530
02:27:37,411 --> 02:27:37,720
whatever.

5531
02:27:37,720 --> 02:27:38,800
A lot more than a pound.

5532
02:27:38,970 --> 02:27:39,211
I mean,

5533
02:27:39,211 --> 02:27:40,350
not more than $100 obviously,

5534
02:27:40,351 --> 02:27:41,310
but it used to be,

5535
02:27:41,311 --> 02:27:41,700
right.

5536
02:27:41,700 --> 02:27:42,460
If you go back back

5537
02:27:42,460 --> 02:27:43,031
to the beginning,

5538
02:27:43,031 --> 02:27:43,421
if you go,

5539
02:27:43,421 --> 02:27:46,270
if you look at the constitution
and you read a article,

5540
02:27:46,271 --> 02:27:47,104
one,

5541
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:48,280
section eight and Article One,

5542
02:27:48,281 --> 02:27:48,791
section 10,

5543
02:27:48,791 --> 02:27:49,350
you read them,

5544
02:27:49,350 --> 02:27:49,640
uh,

5545
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:54,640
but it says that money is gold and silver
and that's what's legal tender in the

5546
02:27:55,720 --> 02:27:55,721
United States.

5547
02:27:55,721 --> 02:27:59,600
And up until 1971 a,

5548
02:27:59,650 --> 02:28:00,130
that's,

5549
02:28:00,130 --> 02:28:00,460
you know,

5550
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:01,540
we were on a gold standard.

5551
02:28:01,541 --> 02:28:01,721
I mean,

5552
02:28:01,721 --> 02:28:04,450
we were on a more pure
gold standard before,

5553
02:28:04,660 --> 02:28:04,900
uh,

5554
02:28:04,900 --> 02:28:06,700
the Federal Reserve came in in 1913.

5555
02:28:07,090 --> 02:28:07,301
Uh,

5556
02:28:07,301 --> 02:28:09,070
but we were always on
some kind of standards.

5557
02:28:09,071 --> 02:28:10,030
So the first dollars,

5558
02:28:10,060 --> 02:28:10,870
right,

5559
02:28:10,870 --> 02:28:12,460
we're receipts for golden silver.

5560
02:28:12,461 --> 02:28:16,330
If you go back and you get
an old dollar from before,

5561
02:28:16,540 --> 02:28:17,050
uh,

5562
02:28:17,050 --> 02:28:17,770
you know,

5563
02:28:17,770 --> 02:28:19,420
let's say you had a $10 bill,

5564
02:28:19,870 --> 02:28:22,550
it would say on the bill
pay to the bearer on demand.

5565
02:28:22,610 --> 02:28:23,443
$10.

5566
02:28:24,110 --> 02:28:27,500
The $10 wasn't a piece of paper
that was a representation.

5567
02:28:27,501 --> 02:28:28,580
It was an Iou.

5568
02:28:28,581 --> 02:28:29,390
$10.

5569
02:28:29,390 --> 02:28:30,950
The $10 was the gold.

5570
02:28:31,240 --> 02:28:31,370
Uh,

5571
02:28:31,370 --> 02:28:34,970
there was $10 worth of gold on
deposit and you could it in somewhere.

5572
02:28:35,110 --> 02:28:35,690
Fort Knox,

5573
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:36,020
right?

5574
02:28:36,020 --> 02:28:36,201
Yeah.

5575
02:28:36,201 --> 02:28:36,861
In Fort Knox.

5576
02:28:36,861 --> 02:28:41,840
And you could take your $10 to
the US treasury and you can say,

5577
02:28:41,841 --> 02:28:42,740
give me my dollars.

5578
02:28:42,741 --> 02:28:43,790
This is my receipt.

5579
02:28:43,791 --> 02:28:45,230
Because it actually was an Iou.

5580
02:28:45,231 --> 02:28:46,580
It was a federal reserve note,

5581
02:28:46,581 --> 02:28:47,414
even if it was a note,

5582
02:28:47,630 --> 02:28:49,820
but it was a note payable in lawful money.

5583
02:28:49,821 --> 02:28:52,850
The lawful money was the gold or
silver because there were some silver

5584
02:28:52,851 --> 02:28:53,331
certificates,

5585
02:28:53,331 --> 02:28:54,440
there were some gold certificates,

5586
02:28:54,680 --> 02:28:58,100
but there was real
money backing the notes,

5587
02:28:58,101 --> 02:28:58,934
backing the currency.

5588
02:28:58,970 --> 02:29:01,610
That money varied depending upon
the price of gold and silver.

5589
02:29:01,670 --> 02:29:01,791
Well,

5590
02:29:01,791 --> 02:29:02,690
the price of gold and silver,

5591
02:29:02,691 --> 02:29:03,580
what your return would be,

5592
02:29:03,620 --> 02:29:04,220
but you returned.

5593
02:29:04,220 --> 02:29:04,690
There was no.

5594
02:29:04,690 --> 02:29:05,660
There never changed.

5595
02:29:05,680 --> 02:29:05,811
Yeah,

5596
02:29:05,811 --> 02:29:06,890
there was real value.

5597
02:29:07,130 --> 02:29:08,690
And when we had real money,

5598
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:12,440
we had prices that went down a little
bit every year because money gains value

5599
02:29:12,470 --> 02:29:13,303
when it's legitimate.

5600
02:29:13,690 --> 02:29:15,260
But our monies illegitimate.

5601
02:29:15,320 --> 02:29:16,810
How does he ever recovered?

5602
02:29:16,811 --> 02:29:16,911
Well,

5603
02:29:16,911 --> 02:29:17,870
it's now counterfeit.

5604
02:29:17,871 --> 02:29:20,600
What happened in 1971 when we
went off the gold standard,

5605
02:29:20,630 --> 02:29:21,230
right?

5606
02:29:21,230 --> 02:29:24,320
The government basically
repudiated it's promises.

5607
02:29:24,380 --> 02:29:26,570
So instead of the $10 bill saying,

5608
02:29:26,571 --> 02:29:28,520
we'll pay to the bearer on demand $10,

5609
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:30,170
it just says $10.

5610
02:29:30,770 --> 02:29:31,210
You know,

5611
02:29:31,210 --> 02:29:31,400
it's,

5612
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:32,233
it's not,

5613
02:29:32,270 --> 02:29:32,550
you know,

5614
02:29:32,550 --> 02:29:32,870
it,

5615
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:33,220
it,

5616
02:29:33,220 --> 02:29:33,511
it,

5617
02:29:33,511 --> 02:29:33,830
it,

5618
02:29:33,830 --> 02:29:34,880
it's Kinda like if I,

5619
02:29:35,150 --> 02:29:39,260
if I go to a coat check and I give them
my coat and they give me a little claim

5620
02:29:39,261 --> 02:29:40,850
check and says I owe you one coat.

5621
02:29:40,880 --> 02:29:41,350
Right.

5622
02:29:41,350 --> 02:29:41,760
You know,

5623
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,090
the claim check is just
a receipt for the coat.

5624
02:29:44,750 --> 02:29:45,650
The coat check has.

5625
02:29:45,830 --> 02:29:50,090
But imagine if you went down there and
you gave him your claim check and they

5626
02:29:50,091 --> 02:29:51,020
just crossed out the,

5627
02:29:51,021 --> 02:29:51,280
you know,

5628
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:53,600
I owe you one coat and they
just gave you back your receipt.

5629
02:29:53,601 --> 02:29:54,410
That said one coat,

5630
02:29:54,410 --> 02:29:55,243
here's your coat.

5631
02:29:55,370 --> 02:29:56,203
That's not my coat.

5632
02:29:56,240 --> 02:29:57,320
Well it says one coat.

5633
02:29:57,430 --> 02:29:58,340
It doesn't matter what it says.

5634
02:29:58,341 --> 02:29:59,170
It's not a coat,

5635
02:29:59,170 --> 02:29:59,540
right?

5636
02:29:59,540 --> 02:30:00,470
The $10 bill,

5637
02:30:00,471 --> 02:30:02,000
just because it says $10.

5638
02:30:02,001 --> 02:30:03,140
It's not $10.

5639
02:30:03,320 --> 02:30:06,290
It used to represent an Iou for $10.

5640
02:30:06,350 --> 02:30:08,930
Now it's just a piece of
paper with writing on it,

5641
02:30:09,020 --> 02:30:10,310
but it doesn't represent anything.

5642
02:30:10,550 --> 02:30:12,920
But right now all we
have is this Fiat money,

5643
02:30:12,950 --> 02:30:13,730
which means just,

5644
02:30:13,730 --> 02:30:13,940
you know,

5645
02:30:13,940 --> 02:30:14,661
let it be made.

5646
02:30:14,661 --> 02:30:15,590
It's just paper money.

5647
02:30:16,010 --> 02:30:19,400
And the founding fathers when they
established means let it be A.

5648
02:30:19,401 --> 02:30:19,700
Yeah.

5649
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:21,500
Just let him car the car company.

5650
02:30:21,501 --> 02:30:22,460
That means let it be made.

5651
02:30:22,630 --> 02:30:22,860
Uh,

5652
02:30:22,860 --> 02:30:23,181
I don't know,

5653
02:30:23,181 --> 02:30:23,781
maybe I don't know,

5654
02:30:23,781 --> 02:30:24,860
but that's where that comes from,

5655
02:30:24,950 --> 02:30:25,783
the Latin word.

5656
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:26,823
But,

5657
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:28,550
but it's not like paper.

5658
02:30:28,551 --> 02:30:29,384
Money is new,

5659
02:30:29,470 --> 02:30:29,870
right?

5660
02:30:29,870 --> 02:30:32,570
They had paper money before
the United States existed.

5661
02:30:32,780 --> 02:30:33,260
In fact,

5662
02:30:33,260 --> 02:30:35,780
we experimented with it in
the continental congress.

5663
02:30:35,781 --> 02:30:38,870
They issued something
called the continental which
collapsed and they had an

5664
02:30:38,871 --> 02:30:40,460
expression not worth a continental.

5665
02:30:40,460 --> 02:30:44,930
So people like George Washington and
Thomas Jefferson and John Adams and

5666
02:30:44,931 --> 02:30:45,770
Benjamin Franklin.

5667
02:30:46,100 --> 02:30:48,140
These guys hated paper
money with a passion.

5668
02:30:48,500 --> 02:30:50,870
They knew how evil it was
and how dangerous it was.

5669
02:30:50,990 --> 02:30:53,150
They didn't want any paper
money in the United States.

5670
02:30:53,151 --> 02:30:54,650
They wanted us to be on a gold standard.

5671
02:30:54,800 --> 02:30:56,730
And so we had a metallic
standard with gold,

5672
02:30:56,731 --> 02:30:57,440
golden silver,

5673
02:30:57,440 --> 02:30:58,700
and it's served our country very,

5674
02:30:58,701 --> 02:30:59,181
very well.

5675
02:30:59,181 --> 02:31:02,480
But unfortunately we did
not listen to the wisdom.

5676
02:31:02,481 --> 02:31:04,130
We forgot the wisdom of the founders.

5677
02:31:04,280 --> 02:31:06,160
And now we have the exact same,

5678
02:31:06,170 --> 02:31:10,010
the exact kind of Fiat money that the
founding fathers wanted to make sure we

5679
02:31:10,011 --> 02:31:12,860
never had because they knew
what a disaster it would be.

5680
02:31:12,861 --> 02:31:16,040
And we are going to have a disaster
because we don't have real money.

5681
02:31:16,280 --> 02:31:16,761
We have,

5682
02:31:16,761 --> 02:31:17,000
you know,

5683
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:19,640
this phony money Fiat money and it is,

5684
02:31:19,641 --> 02:31:19,950
you know,

5685
02:31:19,950 --> 02:31:20,130
the

5686
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:22,410
root cause of a lot of
our economic problems.

5687
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:23,940
If we had honest money,

5688
02:31:23,941 --> 02:31:24,900
we wouldn't have these problems.

5689
02:31:24,901 --> 02:31:26,280
We wouldn't have this enormous government,

5690
02:31:26,400 --> 02:31:29,610
we wouldn't have all this debt because
it would be impossible for the government

5691
02:31:29,611 --> 02:31:31,890
to have all this debt if
they had a bar of gold.

5692
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:35,430
It is quite impressive when you look back
at what the founding fathers predicted

5693
02:31:35,700 --> 02:31:38,100
and what they were trying
to ward against and,

5694
02:31:38,101 --> 02:31:39,390
and protect us against.

5695
02:31:39,391 --> 02:31:41,670
And what an amazing job of predicting it.

5696
02:31:41,730 --> 02:31:43,140
They were very enlightened men.

5697
02:31:43,170 --> 02:31:44,520
They were very learned man.

5698
02:31:44,521 --> 02:31:45,150
A lot of them himself,

5699
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:46,080
self educated,

5700
02:31:46,081 --> 02:31:47,070
some went to colleges too.

5701
02:31:47,071 --> 02:31:47,690
But you know,

5702
02:31:47,690 --> 02:31:48,171
and this is,

5703
02:31:48,171 --> 02:31:48,400
you know,

5704
02:31:48,400 --> 02:31:48,641
they,

5705
02:31:48,641 --> 02:31:49,351
they were very,

5706
02:31:49,351 --> 02:31:49,921
very bright man.

5707
02:31:49,921 --> 02:31:52,890
And so unfortunately with all
the population we have now,

5708
02:31:52,891 --> 02:31:56,100
I mean there's no way that
Congress today can come even close.

5709
02:31:56,101 --> 02:31:56,281
I mean,

5710
02:31:56,281 --> 02:31:57,540
maybe there's a couple of guys,

5711
02:31:57,720 --> 02:32:02,220
but I mean it's nothing like it because
we only had 3 million people back then

5712
02:32:02,221 --> 02:32:04,380
and we had such an intelligent,

5713
02:32:04,650 --> 02:32:09,610
a group of men in Congress compared to
now we're drawing off of $250 million and

5714
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:10,740
we have a bunch of idiots.

5715
02:32:11,070 --> 02:32:11,371
Okay.

5716
02:32:11,371 --> 02:32:12,600
What do we do about that?

5717
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:12,890
There's,

5718
02:32:12,890 --> 02:32:14,190
there's no Fort Knox anymore.

5719
02:32:14,191 --> 02:32:15,610
There's no big fat pile of gold.

5720
02:32:15,720 --> 02:32:16,000
Well,

5721
02:32:16,000 --> 02:32:16,510
you know,

5722
02:32:16,510 --> 02:32:16,730
well,

5723
02:32:16,730 --> 02:32:17,550
we know that money go.

5724
02:32:17,550 --> 02:32:20,280
Why don't we claim that there
is a bunch of gold there,

5725
02:32:20,281 --> 02:32:20,581
but you know,

5726
02:32:20,581 --> 02:32:21,960
it's interesting that Germany,

5727
02:32:21,961 --> 02:32:22,460
which you know,

5728
02:32:22,460 --> 02:32:24,840
we the United States in
addition to our own goals,

5729
02:32:24,870 --> 02:32:25,380
right?

5730
02:32:25,380 --> 02:32:28,350
We also store gold on behalf
of a lot of other countries.

5731
02:32:28,530 --> 02:32:32,610
So Germany a year ago asked
for half of their goal back,

5732
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:33,960
they told the United States government,

5733
02:32:34,030 --> 02:32:37,110
we want half our goals and
we basically told Germany,

5734
02:32:37,111 --> 02:32:37,920
okay,

5735
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:39,630
but it's going to take us
eight years to give it to you.

5736
02:32:40,410 --> 02:32:41,100
Why?

5737
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:42,180
Because we've got to dig
it out of the ground.

5738
02:32:42,690 --> 02:32:42,870
Now.

5739
02:32:42,870 --> 02:32:43,440
Meanwhile,

5740
02:32:43,440 --> 02:32:47,220
it's been a year and we haven't even come
close to giving them one eighth of it.

5741
02:32:48,500 --> 02:32:49,171
Fucking mouth.

5742
02:32:49,171 --> 02:32:50,004
How about that?

5743
02:32:50,130 --> 02:32:51,420
He makes some nice cars.

5744
02:32:51,480 --> 02:32:52,410
Let's leave it at that.

5745
02:32:52,410 --> 02:32:53,191
Don't get crazy.

5746
02:32:53,191 --> 02:32:53,911
You guys are about that,

5747
02:32:53,911 --> 02:32:54,301
but you know,

5748
02:32:54,301 --> 02:32:54,660
but you know,

5749
02:32:54,660 --> 02:32:56,610
they want their gold back
because I think they just,

5750
02:32:56,611 --> 02:32:57,560
they don't trust this.

5751
02:32:57,570 --> 02:32:59,580
Ours mine when they die because it really,

5752
02:32:59,730 --> 02:33:00,091
that's why.

5753
02:33:00,091 --> 02:33:00,331
Look,

5754
02:33:00,331 --> 02:33:01,080
you know,

5755
02:33:01,080 --> 02:33:03,760
I think people know I own,

5756
02:33:04,050 --> 02:33:05,040
I own a lot of gold.

5757
02:33:05,130 --> 02:33:06,400
Are you one of those guys?

5758
02:33:06,660 --> 02:33:07,650
You're golden.

5759
02:33:07,651 --> 02:33:08,484
Dried food.

5760
02:33:08,560 --> 02:33:08,830
Well,

5761
02:33:08,830 --> 02:33:09,663
you know,

5762
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:11,250
I got more golden dried food,

5763
02:33:11,251 --> 02:33:11,910
but you know,

5764
02:33:11,910 --> 02:33:12,331
I think,

5765
02:33:12,331 --> 02:33:12,660
look,

5766
02:33:12,660 --> 02:33:13,021
I think,

5767
02:33:13,021 --> 02:33:13,620
I think gold.

5768
02:33:13,620 --> 02:33:14,730
I think gold is going a lot higher.

5769
02:33:14,731 --> 02:33:15,900
That's why I have a gold company.

5770
02:33:15,901 --> 02:33:16,081
You know,

5771
02:33:16,081 --> 02:33:16,370
I still,

5772
02:33:16,370 --> 02:33:16,600
you know,

5773
02:33:16,600 --> 02:33:18,330
your specific precious
metals is my goal company,

5774
02:33:18,331 --> 02:33:20,190
but I recommend that people own gold.

5775
02:33:20,191 --> 02:33:20,761
I own goals.

5776
02:33:20,761 --> 02:33:22,340
I want a lot of gold mining gold.

5777
02:33:22,370 --> 02:33:24,210
You were like fat chains around the house.

5778
02:33:24,211 --> 02:33:25,500
I got a little gold in my watch.

5779
02:33:25,501 --> 02:33:27,820
I mean I'm not very flamboyant
or anything like that.

5780
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:28,460
Oh No,

5781
02:33:28,460 --> 02:33:29,700
I'm not a good thing to have.

5782
02:33:29,701 --> 02:33:30,660
If the shit hits the fan,

5783
02:33:30,690 --> 02:33:30,860
well,

5784
02:33:30,860 --> 02:33:31,651
I mean,

5785
02:33:31,651 --> 02:33:31,990
you know,

5786
02:33:31,990 --> 02:33:32,240
it's,

5787
02:33:32,240 --> 02:33:33,330
it's definitely valuable.

5788
02:33:33,331 --> 02:33:34,290
I don't wear my gold.

5789
02:33:34,291 --> 02:33:34,670
I haven't,

5790
02:33:34,670 --> 02:33:35,020
I haven't,

5791
02:33:35,020 --> 02:33:35,150
uh,

5792
02:33:35,150 --> 02:33:35,490
you know,

5793
02:33:35,490 --> 02:33:36,021
in a,

5794
02:33:36,021 --> 02:33:36,750
in a safe.

5795
02:33:36,750 --> 02:33:37,020
Okay.

5796
02:33:37,020 --> 02:33:39,360
So our money is not backed in gold.

5797
02:33:39,390 --> 02:33:41,130
There is no more Fort Knox.

5798
02:33:41,220 --> 02:33:42,630
We don't know what happened to all that.

5799
02:33:43,070 --> 02:33:43,260
Well,

5800
02:33:43,260 --> 02:33:43,800
I don't know.

5801
02:33:43,800 --> 02:33:44,670
I don't know if it's there.

5802
02:33:44,671 --> 02:33:45,270
It's not there.

5803
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:46,080
I mean,

5804
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:46,890
you're the guy,

5805
02:33:46,890 --> 02:33:50,790
but how am I supposed to ask me
some questions about martial arts?

5806
02:33:51,160 --> 02:33:52,250
Some definitive answers yet,

5807
02:33:52,260 --> 02:33:54,180
but I've never been down
to about an economy.

5808
02:33:54,181 --> 02:33:54,790
I said no,

5809
02:33:54,790 --> 02:33:54,930
no,

5810
02:33:54,930 --> 02:33:55,763
but I don't know.

5811
02:33:55,870 --> 02:33:57,060
I've never been there.

5812
02:33:57,210 --> 02:33:57,871
I don't know.

5813
02:33:57,871 --> 02:33:58,081
You know,

5814
02:33:58,081 --> 02:34:01,350
there are people who have wanted an audit
of Fort Knox but they haven't had one

5815
02:34:01,410 --> 02:34:01,880
mean.

5816
02:34:01,880 --> 02:34:03,960
The government claims
that the gold is there.

5817
02:34:04,260 --> 02:34:05,190
I hope it's there.

5818
02:34:05,191 --> 02:34:05,790
Oh Jesus.

5819
02:34:05,790 --> 02:34:06,151
But you know,

5820
02:34:06,151 --> 02:34:07,290
as a gold investor,

5821
02:34:07,291 --> 02:34:07,410
I,

5822
02:34:07,410 --> 02:34:07,681
you know,

5823
02:34:07,681 --> 02:34:10,440
certainly if it's not there the price
of gold is going to go a lot higher

5824
02:34:10,620 --> 02:34:13,560
because eventually the world is
going back to a gold standard.

5825
02:34:13,561 --> 02:34:13,740
I mean,

5826
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:17,040
there is no question in my mind that
we will be back on a gold standard,

5827
02:34:17,320 --> 02:34:17,980
not because we

5828
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:18,820
want it right.

5829
02:34:18,821 --> 02:34:20,230
The politicians will never want it,

5830
02:34:20,350 --> 02:34:23,230
but they're going to be forced to adopt
it because it's gonna be the only way to

5831
02:34:23,231 --> 02:34:24,070
end the chaos.

5832
02:34:24,370 --> 02:34:24,761
But you know,

5833
02:34:24,761 --> 02:34:26,630
it's like a chaperone at a,

5834
02:34:26,631 --> 02:34:28,270
at a high school prom,

5835
02:34:28,330 --> 02:34:28,571
right.

5836
02:34:28,571 --> 02:34:28,870
I mean,

5837
02:34:28,870 --> 02:34:30,400
the kids don't want the chaperone there.

5838
02:34:30,520 --> 02:34:31,960
Gold is the monitor wall.

5839
02:34:32,090 --> 02:34:33,140
Fuck yeah.

5840
02:34:33,790 --> 02:34:35,230
And the central bankers.

5841
02:34:35,260 --> 02:34:36,670
The government wants to fuck us,

5842
02:34:36,850 --> 02:34:38,560
but they can't do it on a goldsmith.

5843
02:34:39,090 --> 02:34:39,300
Right.

5844
02:34:39,300 --> 02:34:40,870
They can't do it when
we're on a gold standard.

5845
02:34:40,871 --> 02:34:41,704
That's why they don't want it.

5846
02:34:41,800 --> 02:34:43,000
That's why they want funny money.

5847
02:34:43,140 --> 02:34:43,420
Right.

5848
02:34:43,420 --> 02:34:44,140
And the mean to me,

5849
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:44,800
is this,

5850
02:34:44,800 --> 02:34:47,200
your advice has nothing to do with
the fact that you actually sell gold?

5851
02:34:47,230 --> 02:34:47,311
No,

5852
02:34:47,311 --> 02:34:47,500
no.

5853
02:34:47,500 --> 02:34:49,150
I sell goal because I believe in it.

5854
02:34:49,240 --> 02:34:51,490
I believe say I believe I'm going to see.

5855
02:34:51,640 --> 02:34:53,420
I want to do the right
thing for my clients.

5856
02:34:54,050 --> 02:34:54,460
Clients.

5857
02:34:54,460 --> 02:34:54,600
Yeah.

5858
02:34:54,600 --> 02:34:54,800
If,

5859
02:34:54,800 --> 02:34:55,330
if I,

5860
02:34:55,330 --> 02:34:57,370
if I thought that they
should own something else,

5861
02:34:57,371 --> 02:34:57,700
I mean,

5862
02:34:57,700 --> 02:34:58,481
oftentimes,

5863
02:34:58,481 --> 02:34:59,080
you know,

5864
02:34:59,080 --> 02:35:02,650
it's easier to sell people what they
want than what you think that they need.

5865
02:35:02,890 --> 02:35:03,101
I mean,

5866
02:35:03,101 --> 02:35:03,390
I,

5867
02:35:03,390 --> 02:35:03,611
you know,

5868
02:35:03,611 --> 02:35:08,410
I actually built my brokerage business
really in the late 19 nineties when

5869
02:35:08,411 --> 02:35:08,921
everybody.

5870
02:35:08,921 --> 02:35:13,060
I talked to one of tech stocks and I used
to spend all day and all night trying

5871
02:35:13,061 --> 02:35:14,710
to talk people out of those stocks.

5872
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:15,221
St Luke,

5873
02:35:15,221 --> 02:35:16,054
this is a bubble.

5874
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:17,170
You don't want to buy this,

5875
02:35:17,290 --> 02:35:18,011
this is what you need.

5876
02:35:18,011 --> 02:35:18,670
You should buy this,

5877
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:19,090
you know,

5878
02:35:19,090 --> 02:35:20,440
this company or this dividend,

5879
02:35:20,441 --> 02:35:20,710
you know,

5880
02:35:20,710 --> 02:35:20,871
and,

5881
02:35:20,871 --> 02:35:21,910
and it was difficult.

5882
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:25,120
A lot of my friends were making a lot
more money than I was back then because

5883
02:35:25,121 --> 02:35:27,400
they were just selling their
clients what they want it.

5884
02:35:27,820 --> 02:35:28,100
But I,

5885
02:35:28,100 --> 02:35:28,410
I,

5886
02:35:28,410 --> 02:35:31,990
I make a lot more money than they do
now because I took a longterm approach.

5887
02:35:32,140 --> 02:35:33,970
I wanted to do what was
right for my clients,

5888
02:35:33,971 --> 02:35:35,500
not what made me the
money in the short run.

5889
02:35:35,620 --> 02:35:40,330
I was concerned about my reputation and
building a lasting business beyond the

5890
02:35:40,331 --> 02:35:41,140
tech bubble,

5891
02:35:41,140 --> 02:35:41,351
you know,

5892
02:35:41,351 --> 02:35:42,570
and I in and you know,

5893
02:35:42,700 --> 02:35:44,440
it made it hard for me in 98,

5894
02:35:44,450 --> 02:35:45,690
99 and 2000,

5895
02:35:46,090 --> 02:35:46,810
but you know,

5896
02:35:46,810 --> 02:35:47,310
and in it,

5897
02:35:47,310 --> 02:35:49,360
but now I'm getting the
same kind of thing again.

5898
02:35:49,361 --> 02:35:49,541
You know,

5899
02:35:49,541 --> 02:35:52,690
we're now a lot of people are buying
these social media stocks and you know,

5900
02:35:52,760 --> 02:35:53,040
they're,

5901
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:53,350
they're,

5902
02:35:53,350 --> 02:35:53,511
they're,

5903
02:35:53,511 --> 02:35:53,720
they're,

5904
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:54,940
they're succumbing to the hype.

5905
02:35:54,941 --> 02:35:55,311
Again,

5906
02:35:55,311 --> 02:35:55,421
it's,

5907
02:35:55,421 --> 02:35:58,750
there's a lot of similarities between
what's going on now in the markets and

5908
02:35:58,751 --> 02:36:00,460
what was going on in the late 19 nineties.

5909
02:36:00,700 --> 02:36:00,881
You know,

5910
02:36:00,881 --> 02:36:02,050
people forget the past.

5911
02:36:02,051 --> 02:36:03,100
They keep reliving it.

5912
02:36:03,250 --> 02:36:04,450
Even if it's recent,

5913
02:36:04,540 --> 02:36:05,170
you know,

5914
02:36:05,170 --> 02:36:05,920
it shows you how,

5915
02:36:05,920 --> 02:36:07,290
how worthless our schools are.

5916
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:08,590
I mean the history,

5917
02:36:08,620 --> 02:36:09,760
not only don't they know,

5918
02:36:09,840 --> 02:36:10,300
you know,

5919
02:36:10,300 --> 02:36:11,200
history of fifth year,

5920
02:36:11,201 --> 02:36:12,010
100 years ago,

5921
02:36:12,010 --> 02:36:14,200
people don't even know history
from five or 10 years ago.

5922
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:15,190
That's how ignorant they are.

5923
02:36:15,610 --> 02:36:16,840
What do you think about bitcoin?

5924
02:36:17,050 --> 02:36:18,520
What do you think about cryptocurrencies?

5925
02:36:18,700 --> 02:36:19,840
What do you think about emerging?

5926
02:36:19,860 --> 02:36:20,693
Yeah.

5927
02:36:21,190 --> 02:36:21,371
Look,

5928
02:36:21,371 --> 02:36:26,140
there are a lot of people that are
libertarian or some people that believe in

5929
02:36:26,141 --> 02:36:26,651
hard money.

5930
02:36:26,651 --> 02:36:27,990
There are people that
believe in goal that,

5931
02:36:28,020 --> 02:36:30,520
that are in Bitcoin and you know,

5932
02:36:31,450 --> 02:36:36,230
I think that a lot of people who bought
bitcoin a few years ago and you know,

5933
02:36:36,250 --> 02:36:37,210
I didn't buy it and sure,

5934
02:36:37,211 --> 02:36:37,421
you know,

5935
02:36:37,421 --> 02:36:39,910
I wish I had bought them because
I would be selling them now.

5936
02:36:39,911 --> 02:36:41,080
In fact that would have already sold them.

5937
02:36:41,081 --> 02:36:42,130
So jumped in already.

5938
02:36:42,250 --> 02:36:43,083
Oh yeah.

5939
02:36:43,570 --> 02:36:44,351
Because I think it's,

5940
02:36:44,351 --> 02:36:45,190
I think it's a bubble.

5941
02:36:45,191 --> 02:36:49,090
I think that I think that are going to
be collapsed here with Vegas casinos to

5942
02:36:49,091 --> 02:36:51,160
casinos just started accepting bitcoin.

5943
02:36:51,370 --> 02:36:51,551
Yeah.

5944
02:36:51,551 --> 02:36:52,384
But you know,

5945
02:36:52,420 --> 02:36:56,740
I think merchants starting to accept
bitcoins are actually going to be negative

5946
02:36:56,860 --> 02:36:57,481
for bitcoins.

5947
02:36:57,481 --> 02:36:58,314
Non Positive.

5948
02:36:59,050 --> 02:36:59,770
Well here's why.

5949
02:36:59,770 --> 02:37:00,400
You know,

5950
02:37:00,400 --> 02:37:03,880
when bitcoins went up from Penny's
a coin to a thousand dollars,

5951
02:37:04,090 --> 02:37:04,390
right?

5952
02:37:04,390 --> 02:37:05,260
Do you know you,

5953
02:37:05,440 --> 02:37:07,500
you really couldn't do much
with them except Horta.

5954
02:37:07,680 --> 02:37:09,100
So before you go there,

5955
02:37:09,310 --> 02:37:10,143
I'm sorry,

5956
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:11,231
sorry to interrupt you,

5957
02:37:11,231 --> 02:37:13,420
but explain to me what
is it actually worth?

5958
02:37:13,540 --> 02:37:15,980
What is a bit coin is worth
whatever somebody will

5959
02:37:15,980 --> 02:37:16,581
give you for it.

5960
02:37:16,581 --> 02:37:19,250
I mean it has no actual value because
you can't do anything with it.

5961
02:37:19,610 --> 02:37:21,140
All you can do is give
it to somebody else.

5962
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:22,700
So what is it in ones?

5963
02:37:22,701 --> 02:37:25,010
It means it in one bitcoin to bitcoin.

5964
02:37:25,330 --> 02:37:26,450
What is the volume?

5965
02:37:26,451 --> 02:37:27,200
What is the.

5966
02:37:27,200 --> 02:37:29,200
They usually sell them into one bitcoin,

5967
02:37:29,210 --> 02:37:29,960
but you can bake.

5968
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:33,510
You can break a bitcoin up
into like 100,000 pizza.

5969
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:33,620
But.

5970
02:37:33,620 --> 02:37:33,861
Okay.

5971
02:37:33,861 --> 02:37:34,340
But give me,

5972
02:37:34,340 --> 02:37:35,270
how much is the pizza?

5973
02:37:35,510 --> 02:37:36,800
How many bitcoins is a pizza?

5974
02:37:36,930 --> 02:37:37,370
Well,

5975
02:37:37,370 --> 02:37:39,290
a fraction because right now an entire.

5976
02:37:39,490 --> 02:37:41,570
Well an entire bitcoin right now is what?

5977
02:37:41,571 --> 02:37:42,680
Nine hundred and $50.

5978
02:37:42,681 --> 02:37:44,270
So how many pizza you can get?

5979
02:37:44,271 --> 02:37:45,440
A pizza is like $9.

5980
02:37:45,441 --> 02:37:45,821
Fifty cents.

5981
02:37:45,821 --> 02:37:46,800
So you get like 100 pizza.

5982
02:37:46,801 --> 02:37:48,470
They didn't have any other
thing other than a bitcoin.

5983
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:48,980
That's it.

5984
02:37:48,980 --> 02:37:49,910
It's just a bit coin.

5985
02:37:49,940 --> 02:37:50,300
Well,

5986
02:37:50,300 --> 02:37:51,710
I mean you can get bitcoin.

5987
02:37:51,770 --> 02:37:52,603
I mean you can get,

5988
02:37:52,630 --> 02:37:52,881
you know,

5989
02:37:52,881 --> 02:37:53,750
fractional coins.

5990
02:37:53,750 --> 02:37:54,890
You don't have to buy a whole coin.

5991
02:37:55,010 --> 02:37:56,030
You have to figure it out.

5992
02:37:56,180 --> 02:37:57,650
You have to have like Nicole quarter.

5993
02:37:57,950 --> 02:37:58,291
No,

5994
02:37:58,291 --> 02:37:59,170
it's just bitcoin.

5995
02:37:59,210 --> 02:38:00,980
You could have a decade,

5996
02:38:01,040 --> 02:38:02,480
a decade coin is sent a coin,

5997
02:38:02,481 --> 02:38:04,660
I don't know what the
exact opposite of pesos,

5998
02:38:04,670 --> 02:38:06,490
like a million pesos dollar,

5999
02:38:06,740 --> 02:38:10,010
but the important thing is that
you can't do anything with it.

6000
02:38:10,550 --> 02:38:10,761
You know,

6001
02:38:10,761 --> 02:38:11,840
there's no actual value.

6002
02:38:11,850 --> 02:38:13,430
We think about drugs right now.

6003
02:38:15,270 --> 02:38:15,631
Yes,

6004
02:38:15,631 --> 02:38:15,930
but you,

6005
02:38:15,930 --> 02:38:18,710
you can spend it as long as
somebody is willing to take it.

6006
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:19,250
Right.

6007
02:38:19,250 --> 02:38:20,570
But there's no end user.

6008
02:38:20,571 --> 02:38:20,961
There's no.

6009
02:38:20,961 --> 02:38:23,810
It's not a commodity like
the same with our currency.

6010
02:38:23,811 --> 02:38:25,670
Currently the currency is crap.

6011
02:38:25,671 --> 02:38:26,080
I mean I might,

6012
02:38:26,080 --> 02:38:30,170
you know why bitcoin is
crap in our currency is the
difference between the crap,

6013
02:38:30,171 --> 02:38:34,250
the government issues and bitcoins is
the crap the government issues for now as

6014
02:38:34,251 --> 02:38:35,084
legal tender.

6015
02:38:35,210 --> 02:38:35,590
I can,

6016
02:38:35,590 --> 02:38:35,750
you know,

6017
02:38:35,750 --> 02:38:36,620
people will accept it.

6018
02:38:36,620 --> 02:38:37,910
I can pay my taxes in it.

6019
02:38:37,911 --> 02:38:39,080
I mean I have a use for it,

6020
02:38:39,190 --> 02:38:39,380
right?

6021
02:38:39,380 --> 02:38:41,510
But it's the government is
saying it's legal tender.

6022
02:38:41,820 --> 02:38:44,930
The government enforcing being someone
who's so antigovernment as you.

6023
02:38:44,931 --> 02:38:46,460
I would assume that that's why own gold,

6024
02:38:46,630 --> 02:38:48,410
but you would enjoy
something like bitcoin.

6025
02:38:48,530 --> 02:38:49,100
Bitcoin has,

6026
02:38:49,100 --> 02:38:50,480
but it has no real value.

6027
02:38:50,481 --> 02:38:52,190
I recognize that it could collapse.

6028
02:38:52,191 --> 02:38:52,480
I don't.

6029
02:38:52,480 --> 02:38:54,170
There's no agrees there's a value.

6030
02:38:54,171 --> 02:38:56,930
Isn't there a value just
like we do tomorrow?

6031
02:38:56,931 --> 02:38:57,800
Everybody can agree.

6032
02:38:57,801 --> 02:38:58,634
There's no value.

6033
02:38:58,750 --> 02:38:59,583
See,

6034
02:38:59,630 --> 02:39:02,540
gold was valuable long
before it became money.

6035
02:39:02,780 --> 02:39:05,360
Bitcoin had no value
until it became money,

6036
02:39:05,540 --> 02:39:08,330
but I don't think it can
withstand the test of time.

6037
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:09,950
I don't think it represents
a store of value,

6038
02:39:09,951 --> 02:39:12,110
but let me tell you why
you say that though,

6039
02:39:12,111 --> 02:39:13,550
but it isn't like we don't.

6040
02:39:13,551 --> 02:39:14,780
We're not on the gold standard right now.

6041
02:39:14,781 --> 02:39:17,840
I know our dollars are
essentially just like bitcoin.

6042
02:39:18,230 --> 02:39:18,471
Well,

6043
02:39:18,471 --> 02:39:19,580
they're not just like it,

6044
02:39:19,581 --> 02:39:20,460
but not be.

6045
02:39:20,510 --> 02:39:21,140
Well.

6046
02:39:21,140 --> 02:39:22,940
The government won't
accept bitcoins in payment,

6047
02:39:22,941 --> 02:39:23,630
in cash.

6048
02:39:23,630 --> 02:39:24,441
The motherfuckers.

6049
02:39:24,441 --> 02:39:24,711
Okay.

6050
02:39:24,711 --> 02:39:25,370
Then eventually,

6051
02:39:25,370 --> 02:39:26,180
let me tell you though,

6052
02:39:26,180 --> 02:39:27,110
if you go,

6053
02:39:27,111 --> 02:39:30,500
if I go to a store that accepts
dollars and I pay with dollars,

6054
02:39:30,501 --> 02:39:31,070
right?

6055
02:39:31,070 --> 02:39:32,360
They don't sell my dollars.

6056
02:39:32,361 --> 02:39:35,600
They use their dollars to pay
their employees their wages.

6057
02:39:35,720 --> 02:39:38,390
They use their dollars to
pay their landlord the rent.

6058
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:40,970
They use their dollars
to pay their salary.

6059
02:39:41,090 --> 02:39:41,840
The employer,

6060
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:43,760
the owner of the business
takes the dollars,

6061
02:39:43,850 --> 02:39:44,840
pays his mortgage.

6062
02:39:45,090 --> 02:39:46,790
He pays his tuition for A.

6063
02:39:46,920 --> 02:39:47,753
I mean everybody uses it.

6064
02:39:48,080 --> 02:39:49,400
Here's what's going on with bitcoin.

6065
02:39:49,580 --> 02:39:52,070
So a merchant decides to accept Bitcoin,

6066
02:39:52,340 --> 02:39:54,260
they don't price their
products in bitcoin.

6067
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:58,550
What they do is they allow you to
pay with bitcoins using bitpay,

6068
02:39:58,760 --> 02:40:00,560
but then what they do with those bitcoins,

6069
02:40:00,590 --> 02:40:01,490
the minute they get them,

6070
02:40:01,491 --> 02:40:02,324
they sell them.

6071
02:40:02,750 --> 02:40:03,051
Okay,

6072
02:40:03,051 --> 02:40:05,900
so now the more merchants
that accept bitcoins,

6073
02:40:06,020 --> 02:40:07,850
now all of these bitcoins are for sale.

6074
02:40:08,060 --> 02:40:08,301
See,

6075
02:40:08,301 --> 02:40:10,520
before when very few people accepted them,

6076
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:11,980
everybody was hoarding them,

6077
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:14,100
and so the reason the price was going up

6078
02:40:14,190 --> 02:40:16,950
is because nobody was actually
spending were very few people,

6079
02:40:17,130 --> 02:40:19,200
but as more and more
merchants accept them,

6080
02:40:19,350 --> 02:40:22,710
now people take bit coins that they
were hoarding and they go to spend them,

6081
02:40:22,830 --> 02:40:26,400
but now the merchants want to get rid of
them because they need dollars or euros

6082
02:40:26,401 --> 02:40:27,270
or whatever their currency is,

6083
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:28,380
who's going to buy them.

6084
02:40:28,770 --> 02:40:29,341
Meanwhile,

6085
02:40:29,341 --> 02:40:31,500
if you look at Bitcoin
for the past few months,

6086
02:40:31,560 --> 02:40:32,880
they haven't been going up anymore.

6087
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:33,900
They stopped going up.

6088
02:40:34,320 --> 02:40:36,120
I think it's a distribution top,

6089
02:40:36,121 --> 02:40:36,954
most likely.

6090
02:40:37,290 --> 02:40:37,681
Uh,

6091
02:40:37,681 --> 02:40:40,260
and I think the bottom eventually
is going to drop out of the market.

6092
02:40:40,261 --> 02:40:42,750
I think a lot of people
who own bitcoins are gonna.

6093
02:40:42,890 --> 02:40:43,140
You know,

6094
02:40:43,140 --> 02:40:44,400
the fear is going to take over.

6095
02:40:44,401 --> 02:40:45,420
Not The greed right now.

6096
02:40:45,421 --> 02:40:46,590
People who have bitcoins,

6097
02:40:46,760 --> 02:40:47,060
no,

6098
02:40:47,060 --> 02:40:47,211
they,

6099
02:40:47,211 --> 02:40:47,400
you know,

6100
02:40:47,400 --> 02:40:47,640
they,

6101
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:50,040
they think they're going to become
billionaires if they just hold them long

6102
02:40:50,041 --> 02:40:50,850
enough,

6103
02:40:50,850 --> 02:40:54,030
I think at some point they're going to
be worried about losing what they have

6104
02:40:54,031 --> 02:40:55,050
rather than getting more.

6105
02:40:55,230 --> 02:40:55,610
I think,

6106
02:40:55,610 --> 02:40:55,860
you know,

6107
02:40:55,860 --> 02:40:55,941
I,

6108
02:40:55,941 --> 02:40:56,320
I,

6109
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:56,540
I,

6110
02:40:56,540 --> 02:40:58,050
I think they're going to start using them.

6111
02:40:58,230 --> 02:40:59,460
They're going to try to get rid of them.

6112
02:40:59,670 --> 02:40:59,881
Look,

6113
02:40:59,881 --> 02:41:00,360
you know,

6114
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:04,890
I know now is it possible
that bitcoin's go to $2,000,

6115
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,090
$3,000?

6116
02:41:06,420 --> 02:41:07,200
I don't know.

6117
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:07,450
I mean,

6118
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:07,681
sure,

6119
02:41:07,681 --> 02:41:08,514
it's possible.

6120
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:11,250
Is it probable viable
alternative to the dollar?

6121
02:41:11,340 --> 02:41:11,960
Well,

6122
02:41:11,960 --> 02:41:12,793
no,

6123
02:41:12,810 --> 02:41:13,643
because look,

6124
02:41:13,830 --> 02:41:14,550
there's already,

6125
02:41:14,550 --> 02:41:14,830
there's,

6126
02:41:14,830 --> 02:41:19,830
you go to this website called a coin
value.com or some crypto currencies.

6127
02:41:21,330 --> 02:41:25,740
There's like 60 or 70 digital currencies
that have already been created.

6128
02:41:26,190 --> 02:41:27,810
People talk about the fact that,

6129
02:41:27,811 --> 02:41:28,500
well,

6130
02:41:28,500 --> 02:41:29,333
you know,

6131
02:41:29,740 --> 02:41:34,740
there's only 21 million potential
bitcoins that can be mined into existence,

6132
02:41:35,280 --> 02:41:40,280
but what they don't say is there as an
unlimited number of alternative digital

6133
02:41:40,591 --> 02:41:42,960
currencies that can be
created that are identical,

6134
02:41:42,961 --> 02:41:43,680
the Bitcoin,

6135
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:45,360
some might be better than bitcoin.

6136
02:41:45,620 --> 02:41:46,170
Um,

6137
02:41:46,170 --> 02:41:46,440
and,

6138
02:41:46,440 --> 02:41:48,930
and so you can keep creating them.

6139
02:41:49,240 --> 02:41:49,570
And,

6140
02:41:49,570 --> 02:41:51,480
and so what does that mean?

6141
02:41:51,630 --> 02:41:52,201
And you know,

6142
02:41:52,201 --> 02:41:52,741
people say,

6143
02:41:52,741 --> 02:41:53,041
well,

6144
02:41:53,041 --> 02:41:54,360
bitcoin got here first,

6145
02:41:54,361 --> 02:41:56,970
therefore it's always going to
be the one that everybody wants.

6146
02:41:57,270 --> 02:41:57,481
Well,

6147
02:41:57,481 --> 02:41:58,890
does everybody use my space?

6148
02:41:59,220 --> 02:42:00,190
Facebook wasn't run.

6149
02:42:01,370 --> 02:42:02,430
How many cryptocurrencies?

6150
02:42:02,960 --> 02:42:03,231
I mean,

6151
02:42:03,231 --> 02:42:04,064
do you,

6152
02:42:04,090 --> 02:42:06,210
do you use aol is your Internet provider.

6153
02:42:07,550 --> 02:42:08,700
I mean they were first,

6154
02:42:08,850 --> 02:42:09,121
I mean,

6155
02:42:09,121 --> 02:42:10,480
just because you're male,

6156
02:42:10,520 --> 02:42:11,580
I mean doesn't mean anything.

6157
02:42:12,960 --> 02:42:13,920
This is all a butler,

6158
02:42:13,970 --> 02:42:14,160
but,

6159
02:42:14,160 --> 02:42:14,350
you know,

6160
02:42:14,350 --> 02:42:14,881
to me,

6161
02:42:14,881 --> 02:42:19,040
I see a lot of similarities in the
people who are irrationally defending,

6162
02:42:19,220 --> 02:42:19,460
uh,

6163
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:19,740
you know,

6164
02:42:19,740 --> 02:42:23,520
the Bitcoin to what I saw in the Dotcom
bubble or the real estate bubble.

6165
02:42:23,521 --> 02:42:23,770
Look,

6166
02:42:23,770 --> 02:42:24,170
I,

6167
02:42:24,170 --> 02:42:24,830
I,

6168
02:42:24,830 --> 02:42:24,901
I,

6169
02:42:24,901 --> 02:42:26,910
I believe in sound money.

6170
02:42:26,911 --> 02:42:28,860
I want to take power away from government.

6171
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:29,730
But,

6172
02:42:29,730 --> 02:42:29,911
you know,

6173
02:42:29,911 --> 02:42:31,080
I think a lot of people,

6174
02:42:31,140 --> 02:42:34,350
if they get into the bitcoin market now
they're going to lose a lot of money,

6175
02:42:34,380 --> 02:42:36,060
even if it goes higher first.

6176
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:37,500
I think eventually it goes down.

6177
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:42,000
Now I know there's a lot of people that
got in early who have a vested interest

6178
02:42:42,001 --> 02:42:44,730
in expanding the market so they can sell,

6179
02:42:44,731 --> 02:42:46,210
they can cash out and,

6180
02:42:46,280 --> 02:42:46,510
and,

6181
02:42:46,510 --> 02:42:50,250
and actually convert their paper wealth
into real things that they want to buy.

6182
02:42:50,830 --> 02:42:51,663
Um,

6183
02:42:51,780 --> 02:42:52,261
and you know,

6184
02:42:52,261 --> 02:42:54,710
I know it makes me unpopular
with some people because they,

6185
02:42:54,711 --> 02:42:54,870
you know,

6186
02:42:54,870 --> 02:42:55,710
they want me out there,

6187
02:42:55,820 --> 02:42:57,570
they want everybody in
the hard money community,

6188
02:42:57,700 --> 02:42:58,140
you know.

6189
02:42:58,140 --> 02:42:58,770
But you know,

6190
02:42:58,770 --> 02:43:01,320
I am an equal opportunity bubble spotter.

6191
02:43:01,350 --> 02:43:04,230
I mean I'm not going to let
my ideology get in my way,

6192
02:43:04,400 --> 02:43:04,661
you know.

6193
02:43:04,661 --> 02:43:06,060
So if I see a housing bubble,

6194
02:43:06,090 --> 02:43:06,631
it's a bubble,

6195
02:43:06,631 --> 02:43:06,781
you know,

6196
02:43:06,781 --> 02:43:09,990
if it looks like it looks like a duck and
it walks like a duck and quacks like a

6197
02:43:09,991 --> 02:43:10,231
duck,

6198
02:43:10,231 --> 02:43:10,740
it's a duck.

6199
02:43:10,740 --> 02:43:12,280
I don't care if I have something

6200
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:16,090
philosophically in common
with people who are anti fed,

6201
02:43:16,250 --> 02:43:16,690
you know,

6202
02:43:16,690 --> 02:43:17,070
you know,

6203
02:43:17,070 --> 02:43:17,560
wanting to.

6204
02:43:17,560 --> 02:43:20,110
I just don't think that the bitcoin now,

6205
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:23,500
if you get a real digital
currency backed by gold,

6206
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:23,891
you know,

6207
02:43:23,891 --> 02:43:26,230
I can be on board with that
because if you go back,

6208
02:43:26,290 --> 02:43:27,610
the original paper money,

6209
02:43:27,870 --> 02:43:30,850
right was backed by gold and
it was issued by private banks,

6210
02:43:30,851 --> 02:43:31,684
not in government.

6211
02:43:31,780 --> 02:43:35,510
It was like the original warehouse
receipt from a Goldsmith and they,

6212
02:43:35,690 --> 02:43:38,080
they had your gold and they
would issue an Iou and the.

6213
02:43:38,081 --> 02:43:39,040
And it would circulate.

6214
02:43:39,160 --> 02:43:40,240
It would be a substitute for my.

6215
02:43:40,250 --> 02:43:42,250
Have a stockpile of gold somewhere.

6216
02:43:42,280 --> 02:43:42,491
Yeah,

6217
02:43:42,491 --> 02:43:42,720
we have.

6218
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:43,930
But you'd have something real,

6219
02:43:44,380 --> 02:43:44,621
you know,

6220
02:43:44,621 --> 02:43:45,730
right now you don't know.

6221
02:43:45,880 --> 02:43:46,381
So you know,

6222
02:43:46,381 --> 02:43:46,601
you,

6223
02:43:46,601 --> 02:43:46,810
you,

6224
02:43:46,810 --> 02:43:50,200
you can't put your savings into
bitcoin or the thousand dollars.

6225
02:43:50,201 --> 02:43:52,000
There's no history of value to bitcoin.

6226
02:43:52,150 --> 02:43:52,420
I mean,

6227
02:43:52,420 --> 02:43:53,710
how much does bitcoin worth,

6228
02:43:53,711 --> 02:43:54,050
I mean,

6229
02:43:54,050 --> 02:43:54,400
you know,

6230
02:43:54,400 --> 02:43:55,510
they mentioned some guy you know,

6231
02:43:55,511 --> 02:43:55,901
sells,

6232
02:43:55,901 --> 02:43:56,081
you know,

6233
02:43:56,081 --> 02:43:58,420
bought a house for
$7,000,000 worth of bitcoins.

6234
02:43:58,540 --> 02:43:58,870
Well,

6235
02:43:58,870 --> 02:43:59,860
are you going to accept,

6236
02:44:00,380 --> 02:44:00,760
you know,

6237
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:02,620
7 million bitcoins for your house?

6238
02:44:02,710 --> 02:44:03,070
I mean,

6239
02:44:03,070 --> 02:44:05,170
how do you know what those
bitcoins will be worth next year?

6240
02:44:05,250 --> 02:44:05,560
Like,

6241
02:44:05,560 --> 02:44:05,741
yeah,

6242
02:44:05,741 --> 02:44:07,660
I sold my house for this pile of bitcoins.

6243
02:44:07,840 --> 02:44:10,810
The only reason you'll do that is
because you can dump your bitcoins on the

6244
02:44:10,811 --> 02:44:12,790
market and get something else.

6245
02:44:12,791 --> 02:44:13,330
There's no,

6246
02:44:13,330 --> 02:44:14,790
there's no real frame of reference.

6247
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:16,510
And this is very recent though,

6248
02:44:16,511 --> 02:44:17,344
and very new.

6249
02:44:17,490 --> 02:44:20,560
Is there just a few years old
will the dollar bill is how old?

6250
02:44:20,870 --> 02:44:21,640
Well the.

6251
02:44:21,640 --> 02:44:25,000
Well the ones that are not backed
by nothing started in 1970.

6252
02:44:25,160 --> 02:44:26,500
That like looking at a baby and go,

6253
02:44:26,501 --> 02:44:28,150
this little motherfucker
is not going to be shit.

6254
02:44:28,151 --> 02:44:29,050
He can't talk.

6255
02:44:29,200 --> 02:44:30,033
He doesn't know how to change.

6256
02:44:30,990 --> 02:44:32,710
The only reason amount to anything,

6257
02:44:32,711 --> 02:44:35,530
but the only reason the
dollar worked for awhile,

6258
02:44:35,590 --> 02:44:39,130
not backed by gold and it hasn't worked
very well is because it had a history of

6259
02:44:39,131 --> 02:44:40,210
being backed by something.

6260
02:44:40,210 --> 02:44:42,070
So the public was kind of fooled.

6261
02:44:42,220 --> 02:44:44,380
They were using currency backed by Ronnie.

6262
02:44:44,400 --> 02:44:45,310
It's not anymore.

6263
02:44:46,490 --> 02:44:48,310
Maybe this bitcoin baby grows up.

6264
02:44:48,311 --> 02:44:50,170
He's going to realize this
dollar that everybody's been.

6265
02:44:50,171 --> 02:44:50,561
Hold it over.

6266
02:44:50,561 --> 02:44:52,570
My head as being superior is just older.

6267
02:44:52,630 --> 02:44:52,841
Yeah.

6268
02:44:52,841 --> 02:44:53,171
Well look,

6269
02:44:53,171 --> 02:44:56,890
if you some old asshole that just happens
to be a dad but doesn't know fucking

6270
02:44:56,891 --> 02:44:59,830
Jack Shit about the way the world runs
and he's telling you how to live your

6271
02:44:59,831 --> 02:45:00,101
life.

6272
02:45:00,101 --> 02:45:01,270
Meanwhile he's a fucking mess.

6273
02:45:01,450 --> 02:45:02,800
Maybe bitcoin's going to grow up.

6274
02:45:02,801 --> 02:45:05,470
Maybe bitcoin's a little baby
that doesn't know shit now,

6275
02:45:05,560 --> 02:45:07,900
but one day bitcoin's going
to grow up and realize,

6276
02:45:07,901 --> 02:45:08,470
you know what?

6277
02:45:08,470 --> 02:45:09,303
There's a better way.

6278
02:45:09,580 --> 02:45:09,791
Well,

6279
02:45:09,791 --> 02:45:11,970
I think that it's the
people buying them that,

6280
02:45:11,971 --> 02:45:12,611
that would grow up.

6281
02:45:12,611 --> 02:45:12,881
But you know,

6282
02:45:12,881 --> 02:45:13,750
there is you,

6283
02:45:13,751 --> 02:45:15,850
you have people get used to it.

6284
02:45:15,851 --> 02:45:17,970
Like if you look at the money
that we have now that change,

6285
02:45:18,010 --> 02:45:18,843
you look at a quarter,

6286
02:45:18,880 --> 02:45:19,710
right?

6287
02:45:19,710 --> 02:45:20,091
You know,

6288
02:45:20,091 --> 02:45:20,500
you think,

6289
02:45:20,500 --> 02:45:21,040
you know,

6290
02:45:21,040 --> 02:45:21,250
you know,

6291
02:45:21,250 --> 02:45:21,731
if you look,

6292
02:45:21,731 --> 02:45:24,130
if you look at the ridges of a
quarter at the side of a quarter,

6293
02:45:24,131 --> 02:45:24,891
you'll see that it's,

6294
02:45:24,891 --> 02:45:25,050
you know,

6295
02:45:25,050 --> 02:45:25,690
it's got,

6296
02:45:25,690 --> 02:45:25,890
it's,

6297
02:45:25,890 --> 02:45:26,160
it's,

6298
02:45:26,160 --> 02:45:28,000
it's got these ridges on the sides.

6299
02:45:28,720 --> 02:45:29,161
And people said,

6300
02:45:29,161 --> 02:45:29,261
well,

6301
02:45:29,261 --> 02:45:29,980
why are they there?

6302
02:45:29,980 --> 02:45:33,910
Why are there these ridges and why
is a quarter even silver in color?

6303
02:45:34,030 --> 02:45:34,500
Because it's,

6304
02:45:34,500 --> 02:45:34,670
it's,

6305
02:45:34,670 --> 02:45:35,391
it's mostly,

6306
02:45:35,391 --> 02:45:35,770
you know,

6307
02:45:35,770 --> 02:45:39,580
it's mostly made of copper and it's
coated with a little bit of zinc,

6308
02:45:39,730 --> 02:45:42,730
but why does the government
go through the process of,

6309
02:45:42,790 --> 02:45:43,030
of,

6310
02:45:43,030 --> 02:45:43,261
of,

6311
02:45:43,261 --> 02:45:47,380
of binding zinc to copper and why do
they go through the expense of making all

6312
02:45:47,390 --> 02:45:49,510
these little ridges on
the sides of the coin?

6313
02:45:49,750 --> 02:45:49,931
Well,

6314
02:45:49,931 --> 02:45:54,430
it's because the coins were originally
made a silver and they read the ridges

6315
02:45:54,431 --> 02:45:58,330
were there so you couldn't shave that you
couldn't flip the coin because when it

6316
02:45:58,331 --> 02:46:02,020
was valuable silver people would try to
take some of the silver off the coin and

6317
02:46:02,021 --> 02:46:02,854
then spend it.

6318
02:46:03,070 --> 02:46:03,820
But when.

6319
02:46:03,820 --> 02:46:04,840
But when the government,

6320
02:46:04,841 --> 02:46:08,590
nobody is going to clip the cops on why
those old coins are always fucked up and

6321
02:46:08,591 --> 02:46:10,160
they never like totally circular.

6322
02:46:10,450 --> 02:46:11,780
See like old Roman poet.

6323
02:46:11,800 --> 02:46:12,633
So they'll just worn out,

6324
02:46:13,070 --> 02:46:13,903
worn out

6325
02:46:15,090 --> 02:46:15,440
slightly.

6326
02:46:15,440 --> 02:46:16,430
It's a Roman coin.

6327
02:46:16,440 --> 02:46:17,390
It's worn out,

6328
02:46:17,660 --> 02:46:18,493
but you know,

6329
02:46:18,620 --> 02:46:22,160
but when the government
originally made a quarters,

6330
02:46:22,250 --> 02:46:23,540
when they took the silver out,

6331
02:46:23,750 --> 02:46:25,760
they made it look like
the old silver coins,

6332
02:46:25,761 --> 02:46:27,230
even though there was no silver in there.

6333
02:46:27,500 --> 02:46:29,540
It was like people were
used to silver coins.

6334
02:46:29,541 --> 02:46:30,980
And so when the government debase them,

6335
02:46:30,981 --> 02:46:31,460
which is,

6336
02:46:31,460 --> 02:46:34,880
that's where the word the comes from
the roads or Roman is when the Romans,

6337
02:46:34,920 --> 02:46:35,150
you know,

6338
02:46:35,150 --> 02:46:39,200
debase their currency by putting base
metal into the currency instead of gold.

6339
02:46:39,340 --> 02:46:39,740
Right?

6340
02:46:39,740 --> 02:46:40,120
So,

6341
02:46:40,120 --> 02:46:41,090
but they,

6342
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:42,950
they dumb you down over time.

6343
02:46:43,070 --> 02:46:44,750
But now our money is just tokens.

6344
02:46:44,760 --> 02:46:45,950
So we don't have any real money.

6345
02:46:46,010 --> 02:46:46,850
And we have Fiat,

6346
02:46:46,851 --> 02:46:47,960
we have counterfeit paper,

6347
02:46:47,961 --> 02:46:49,310
we have tokens for coins,

6348
02:46:49,460 --> 02:46:49,800
we have,

6349
02:46:49,800 --> 02:46:50,000
you know,

6350
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:54,860
we have this monetary system that is the
root cause of all the problems that we

6351
02:46:54,861 --> 02:46:55,101
have.

6352
02:46:55,101 --> 02:46:56,510
And I think it's all coming to a head.

6353
02:46:56,510 --> 02:46:56,871
I think,

6354
02:46:56,871 --> 02:46:57,290
you know,

6355
02:46:57,290 --> 02:47:00,600
we're at the end of the game now and
it's about to blow up and you know,

6356
02:47:01,080 --> 02:47:04,100
the 2008 financial crisis.

6357
02:47:04,130 --> 02:47:05,540
That was the beginning of the end.

6358
02:47:05,541 --> 02:47:07,370
It wasn't the end of it right there.

6359
02:47:07,371 --> 02:47:07,840
Real,

6360
02:47:07,840 --> 02:47:08,930
real crash is coming.

6361
02:47:08,931 --> 02:47:09,261
That's why,

6362
02:47:09,261 --> 02:47:09,411
you know,

6363
02:47:09,411 --> 02:47:10,670
if you go and look at my book,

6364
02:47:10,910 --> 02:47:11,810
the book that I wrote,

6365
02:47:11,900 --> 02:47:14,000
crash proof that came out in February.

6366
02:47:14,001 --> 02:47:14,834
Oh seven.

6367
02:47:14,920 --> 02:47:18,710
The crash that I was writing about
isn't the one that happened in 2008.

6368
02:47:18,740 --> 02:47:20,150
Even though I predicted that crash,

6369
02:47:20,660 --> 02:47:23,090
the crash that I was worried
about was the one that's coming,

6370
02:47:23,330 --> 02:47:26,450
the one that was going to be a consequence
of what I knew the government was

6371
02:47:26,451 --> 02:47:31,130
going to do to artificially stimulate
the economy after the 2008 financial

6372
02:47:31,131 --> 02:47:31,964
crisis I was,

6373
02:47:32,090 --> 02:47:35,890
I was against the government bailouts
and the stimulus before the government

6374
02:47:35,891 --> 02:47:38,810
even knew they were going to do it because
I knew exactly what they were going

6375
02:47:38,811 --> 02:47:41,600
to do and unfortunately
I was right about that.

6376
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:42,111
And that's,

6377
02:47:42,111 --> 02:47:43,310
you know my book that's out now,

6378
02:47:43,311 --> 02:47:44,360
my most recent book,

6379
02:47:44,390 --> 02:47:47,360
other than the one I just gave you on
how an economy grows on why crashes the

6380
02:47:47,361 --> 02:47:48,194
real crash

6381
02:47:48,310 --> 02:47:49,170
south that's coming.

6382
02:47:49,260 --> 02:47:50,060
Take a breath.

6383
02:47:50,060 --> 02:47:55,060
We're not going to buy your book how an
economy grows and when it crashed and

6384
02:47:55,740 --> 02:47:56,820
why acquired crashed,

6385
02:47:57,700 --> 02:47:59,620
how an economy goes and crashes.

6386
02:47:59,621 --> 02:48:00,340
Peter Schiff,

6387
02:48:00,340 --> 02:48:00,641
s,

6388
02:48:00,641 --> 02:48:01,000
c,

6389
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:01,361
h,

6390
02:48:01,361 --> 02:48:01,871
I f,

6391
02:48:01,871 --> 02:48:02,160
F,

6392
02:48:02,160 --> 02:48:02,530
quiet,

6393
02:48:02,530 --> 02:48:03,640
go to Amazon right now.

6394
02:48:03,641 --> 02:48:04,474
You fucks.

6395
02:48:04,960 --> 02:48:05,260
Alright.

6396
02:48:05,260 --> 02:48:05,830
So we've,

6397
02:48:05,830 --> 02:48:06,910
we've figured out a lot of things.

6398
02:48:06,911 --> 02:48:08,500
We figured out Fuck Lake Michigan.

6399
02:48:08,810 --> 02:48:09,643
Well,

6400
02:48:10,530 --> 02:48:13,710
that scenario until off lake.

6401
02:48:14,170 --> 02:48:15,160
I Love Lake Michigan,

6402
02:48:15,161 --> 02:48:15,830
don't get me wrong.

6403
02:48:15,830 --> 02:48:16,360
Okay.

6404
02:48:16,360 --> 02:48:16,940
Um,

6405
02:48:16,940 --> 02:48:20,740
for the Department of Public
Education or Department of Education,

6406
02:48:20,980 --> 02:48:21,940
Department of Energy,

6407
02:48:22,200 --> 02:48:24,190
the government itself
needs to shrink down.

6408
02:48:24,970 --> 02:48:26,860
We need to have a gold based economy.

6409
02:48:26,861 --> 02:48:28,810
Is it possible based monetary system,

6410
02:48:28,811 --> 02:48:30,010
but gold based,

6411
02:48:30,090 --> 02:48:30,301
right?

6412
02:48:30,301 --> 02:48:31,920
We've got to follow the founding fathers,

6413
02:48:32,010 --> 02:48:33,720
not the guys in Congress now.

6414
02:48:34,040 --> 02:48:35,280
What do you don't know
what they're talking about?

6415
02:48:35,290 --> 02:48:35,390
Well,

6416
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:37,870
the thing about a resource based finances,

6417
02:48:37,871 --> 02:48:38,370
what it is,

6418
02:48:38,370 --> 02:48:42,400
is it possible to have other resources
and have our economy base or finances

6419
02:48:42,401 --> 02:48:43,600
based on other resources.

6420
02:48:44,010 --> 02:48:44,600
I mean not,

6421
02:48:44,600 --> 02:48:45,141
not really.

6422
02:48:45,141 --> 02:48:47,600
I mean I think the reason
that gold became money,

6423
02:48:47,660 --> 02:48:50,300
and remember government
didn't make gold money.

6424
02:48:50,410 --> 02:48:52,450
I mean the people made gold money and,

6425
02:48:52,451 --> 02:48:57,451
and governments just recognize that fact
is because gold was a better suited,

6426
02:48:59,000 --> 02:48:59,360
right?

6427
02:48:59,360 --> 02:49:03,980
It was a better commodity to serve as
money than any other commodity originally.

6428
02:49:03,980 --> 02:49:05,960
Get people to give up
things for gold though.

6429
02:49:06,120 --> 02:49:07,920
But people donkeys worth a lot

6430
02:49:08,290 --> 02:49:09,270
of things with your donkey.

6431
02:49:09,550 --> 02:49:11,550
Had someone give you
stupid piece of metal,

6432
02:49:11,570 --> 02:49:12,403
but people only.

6433
02:49:12,890 --> 02:49:15,200
We'll always valued gold
all around the world.

6434
02:49:15,620 --> 02:49:17,450
I don't know because
it's pretty because it's,

6435
02:49:17,451 --> 02:49:17,601
you know,

6436
02:49:17,601 --> 02:49:17,771
it's,

6437
02:49:17,771 --> 02:49:18,321
it's very,

6438
02:49:18,321 --> 02:49:20,030
it's a very good metal
because it's very good,

6439
02:49:20,031 --> 02:49:20,841
it's malleable,

6440
02:49:20,841 --> 02:49:21,800
it doesn't tarnish,

6441
02:49:21,980 --> 02:49:22,191
you know,

6442
02:49:22,191 --> 02:49:22,460
like if,

6443
02:49:22,460 --> 02:49:22,730
you know,

6444
02:49:22,730 --> 02:49:24,500
if there's a Spanish ship that sinks,

6445
02:49:24,700 --> 02:49:25,121
you know,

6446
02:49:25,121 --> 02:49:25,370
you can,

6447
02:49:25,370 --> 02:49:25,820
you know,

6448
02:49:25,820 --> 02:49:28,580
500 years ago if you could find the gold,

6449
02:49:28,820 --> 02:49:31,550
it's in perfect condition
and they have fairly rare,

6450
02:49:31,640 --> 02:49:32,271
but it's also,

6451
02:49:32,271 --> 02:49:33,620
you can take goal then you can,

6452
02:49:33,650 --> 02:49:34,280
you can,

6453
02:49:34,280 --> 02:49:36,710
you can make things out of
it because it's very easy.

6454
02:49:36,711 --> 02:49:37,100
You can,

6455
02:49:37,100 --> 02:49:39,320
you can smash it down
into a very thin strip.

6456
02:49:39,321 --> 02:49:40,220
Very fine pieces.

6457
02:49:40,370 --> 02:49:42,740
So it's good for jewelry is good for,

6458
02:49:42,741 --> 02:49:43,360
you know,

6459
02:49:43,360 --> 02:49:43,940
you know,

6460
02:49:43,940 --> 02:49:44,800
you can make dishes.

6461
02:49:44,810 --> 02:49:44,980
Yeah,

6462
02:49:44,980 --> 02:49:46,790
I mean there's a lot of
things that it's useful for.

6463
02:49:46,791 --> 02:49:48,410
But even before we had electronics,

6464
02:49:48,710 --> 02:49:50,030
it was a symbol of wealth,

6465
02:49:50,060 --> 02:49:50,350
right?

6466
02:49:50,350 --> 02:49:50,680
You,

6467
02:49:50,680 --> 02:49:51,650
if you were wealthy,

6468
02:49:51,651 --> 02:49:52,281
you had gold,

6469
02:49:52,281 --> 02:49:55,100
either you wore gold or
you had it in your house,

6470
02:49:55,101 --> 02:49:57,650
you had gold vases or you had gold,

6471
02:49:57,830 --> 02:49:58,480
you know,

6472
02:49:58,480 --> 02:49:58,990
and you know,

6473
02:49:58,990 --> 02:49:59,180
in,

6474
02:49:59,180 --> 02:49:59,500
in,

6475
02:49:59,500 --> 02:49:59,730
in,

6476
02:49:59,730 --> 02:49:59,981
in,

6477
02:49:59,981 --> 02:50:00,180
in,

6478
02:50:00,180 --> 02:50:00,420
you know,

6479
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:01,280
gilded wood.

6480
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:01,700
You know,

6481
02:50:01,700 --> 02:50:02,391
golden was just,

6482
02:50:02,391 --> 02:50:02,870
you know,

6483
02:50:02,870 --> 02:50:04,890
people valued it everywhere and,

6484
02:50:04,900 --> 02:50:05,101
and,

6485
02:50:05,101 --> 02:50:08,480
and you can trade it and then it became
money because people realized that,

6486
02:50:08,481 --> 02:50:09,290
you know,

6487
02:50:09,290 --> 02:50:09,920
whatever you,

6488
02:50:09,920 --> 02:50:11,930
whatever you needed you
can pay for it with gold.

6489
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:13,090
Even if you didn't need the gold,

6490
02:50:13,110 --> 02:50:13,281
you know,

6491
02:50:13,281 --> 02:50:14,490
you can give it to somebody else who,

6492
02:50:14,510 --> 02:50:15,343
who valued it.

6493
02:50:15,530 --> 02:50:16,370
And it's scarce.

6494
02:50:16,371 --> 02:50:17,720
It's not like there's gold everywhere,

6495
02:50:17,721 --> 02:50:18,980
you can't just trip over it.

6496
02:50:19,340 --> 02:50:20,510
So it's rare.

6497
02:50:20,600 --> 02:50:20,981
And,

6498
02:50:20,981 --> 02:50:21,840
and people like it

6499
02:50:22,130 --> 02:50:24,110
find a new pocket of gold
though and it's worth.

6500
02:50:24,111 --> 02:50:24,860
But they have,

6501
02:50:24,860 --> 02:50:25,790
but they're not going to,

6502
02:50:25,880 --> 02:50:26,070
you know,

6503
02:50:26,070 --> 02:50:27,330
like they found this under water,

6504
02:50:27,331 --> 02:50:27,770
fresh water,

6505
02:50:27,770 --> 02:50:29,720
water lake in Antarctica
under the glaciers.

6506
02:50:29,810 --> 02:50:32,150
Gigantic freshwater lake
and the size of an ocean.

6507
02:50:32,390 --> 02:50:33,330
What if they dig in,

6508
02:50:33,360 --> 02:50:34,730
they find some gold somewhere and like,

6509
02:50:34,731 --> 02:50:34,911
ah,

6510
02:50:34,911 --> 02:50:35,690
shit,

6511
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:36,800
gold is like aluminum.

6512
02:50:36,801 --> 02:50:37,280
It's everywhere,

6513
02:50:37,280 --> 02:50:38,020
but they haven't,

6514
02:50:38,020 --> 02:50:39,050
they haven't done it yet.

6515
02:50:39,140 --> 02:50:39,920
They're not know there.

6516
02:50:39,920 --> 02:50:40,461
And people saying,

6517
02:50:40,461 --> 02:50:40,640
well,

6518
02:50:40,640 --> 02:50:41,960
devil's advocate kind of guy.

6519
02:50:41,961 --> 02:50:42,794
Peter Schiff,

6520
02:50:42,860 --> 02:50:43,420
people.

6521
02:50:43,420 --> 02:50:44,380
You got people saying,

6522
02:50:44,381 --> 02:50:44,561
you know,

6523
02:50:44,561 --> 02:50:46,280
maybe there's gold in outer space.

6524
02:50:46,281 --> 02:50:46,401
You know,

6525
02:50:46,401 --> 02:50:47,810
maybe those golden astronauts.

6526
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:48,160
Yeah.

6527
02:50:48,160 --> 02:50:48,310
Well,

6528
02:50:48,310 --> 02:50:49,750
how expensive is that going to be to get?

6529
02:50:49,920 --> 02:50:50,041
Well,

6530
02:50:50,041 --> 02:50:50,281
you know,

6531
02:50:50,281 --> 02:50:50,850
that's the,

6532
02:50:50,850 --> 02:50:51,371
that's the,

6533
02:50:51,371 --> 02:50:51,640
the,

6534
02:50:51,640 --> 02:50:54,660
the fringe conspiracy theory of why
we like gold in the first place.

6535
02:50:54,900 --> 02:50:56,430
And that's to do with the Annunaki.

6536
02:50:56,700 --> 02:50:58,930
Do you know the whole
story of Zechariah Section?

6537
02:50:58,940 --> 02:50:59,940
Do you know who that guy is?

6538
02:51:00,090 --> 02:51:00,510
Nope.

6539
02:51:00,510 --> 02:51:01,000
VIVICA's,

6540
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:01,650
he shouldn't,

6541
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:02,483
I shouldn't even tell you,

6542
02:51:02,580 --> 02:51:02,971
but he,

6543
02:51:02,971 --> 02:51:03,320
uh,

6544
02:51:03,320 --> 02:51:03,620
he,

6545
02:51:03,620 --> 02:51:05,220
he wrote a bunch of series of books,

6546
02:51:05,430 --> 02:51:08,400
deciphering the Sumerian text,

6547
02:51:08,570 --> 02:51:08,821
you know,

6548
02:51:08,821 --> 02:51:10,530
the oldest written language
that we're aware of.

6549
02:51:10,531 --> 02:51:14,340
And one of the things that he believes
the Sumerian texts depicts is that the

6550
02:51:14,341 --> 02:51:18,150
Annunaki or this race of beings that
created human beings and they live on a

6551
02:51:18,151 --> 02:51:21,690
planet that's an elliptical orbit that
comes around near Earth every 3000,

6552
02:51:21,691 --> 02:51:22,560
600 years.

6553
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:25,320
And they need goal to
sustain their atmosphere.

6554
02:51:25,530 --> 02:51:29,370
They suspend particles reflective
because they've ruined our atmosphere

6555
02:51:29,570 --> 02:51:30,130
atmosphere,

6556
02:51:30,130 --> 02:51:31,770
sort of like the way we've ruined ours,

6557
02:51:31,800 --> 02:51:33,270
like suede China's fucking up.

6558
02:51:33,410 --> 02:51:33,660
Well,

6559
02:51:33,660 --> 02:51:36,390
they created a bunch of computers over
there and they fucked up their atmosphere

6560
02:51:36,391 --> 02:51:36,840
too.

6561
02:51:36,840 --> 02:51:38,940
So they have to come over to the RF,

6562
02:51:39,330 --> 02:51:39,930
take gold.

6563
02:51:39,930 --> 02:51:41,430
And that's why we've
always used it as current,

6564
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:41,831
but I,

6565
02:51:41,831 --> 02:51:42,540
I look like,

6566
02:51:42,540 --> 02:51:43,050
but I would,

6567
02:51:43,050 --> 02:51:44,540
I would surmise this creative,

6568
02:51:44,870 --> 02:51:45,890
my guess would be,

6569
02:51:45,950 --> 02:51:48,710
and I'm sure there's intelligent
life on other planets.

6570
02:51:48,711 --> 02:51:51,230
We're not the only planet
to evolve the way we did,

6571
02:51:51,470 --> 02:51:52,700
but I bet that you know,

6572
02:51:52,850 --> 02:51:54,830
if there's intelligent
life on other planets,

6573
02:51:54,860 --> 02:51:56,030
that they're going to value gold.

6574
02:51:56,031 --> 02:51:57,710
If you can somehow go to another planet,

6575
02:51:57,711 --> 02:51:58,760
if you can bring gold,

6576
02:51:58,940 --> 02:52:00,110
you can probably buy something.

6577
02:52:00,230 --> 02:52:01,550
If you brought a bunch of paper,

6578
02:52:01,551 --> 02:52:02,570
Federal Reserve notes,

6579
02:52:02,840 --> 02:52:04,130
no one's going to give
you anything for them.

6580
02:52:04,180 --> 02:52:06,250
Do you think there's intelligent
life on other planets?

6581
02:52:06,250 --> 02:52:07,450
It's a million years ahead of us.

6582
02:52:07,451 --> 02:52:09,760
They have currency and it's based on gold.

6583
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:10,941
Well,

6584
02:52:10,941 --> 02:52:11,601
I mean ahead of us.

6585
02:52:11,601 --> 02:52:12,250
In what way?

6586
02:52:12,250 --> 02:52:13,190
That everything,

6587
02:52:13,280 --> 02:52:14,510
they've been alive longer.

6588
02:52:14,780 --> 02:52:15,051
Well,

6589
02:52:15,051 --> 02:52:15,440
you know,

6590
02:52:15,440 --> 02:52:18,140
but just because they've been around
longer doesn't mean that they've advanced

6591
02:52:18,141 --> 02:52:18,381
more.

6592
02:52:18,381 --> 02:52:20,600
But if they have advanced more,

6593
02:52:21,260 --> 02:52:23,090
chances are they do have sound money.

6594
02:52:23,420 --> 02:52:26,240
Because I do think that if you
have free markets and sound money,

6595
02:52:26,241 --> 02:52:27,350
you're going to achieve a lot more.

6596
02:52:27,890 --> 02:52:31,790
And I can only imagine how much more we
would have achieved in America had we

6597
02:52:31,791 --> 02:52:32,540
had,

6598
02:52:32,540 --> 02:52:34,550
we had more freedom and sound money,

6599
02:52:34,790 --> 02:52:35,060
uh,

6600
02:52:35,060 --> 02:52:36,680
for the past several decades.

6601
02:52:36,681 --> 02:52:36,891
I mean,

6602
02:52:36,891 --> 02:52:41,660
I think it would be night and day where
we would be assigned from aliens to free

6603
02:52:41,661 --> 02:52:42,140
market.

6604
02:52:42,140 --> 02:52:45,620
Peter Shift says aliens equal
free market if they're advanced.

6605
02:52:45,670 --> 02:52:47,060
Imagine what you would do with bigfoot.

6606
02:52:47,061 --> 02:52:47,151
No,

6607
02:52:47,151 --> 02:52:47,300
no,

6608
02:52:47,300 --> 02:52:48,133
that's,

6609
02:52:48,470 --> 02:52:49,520
that's if they're advanced.

6610
02:52:49,521 --> 02:52:49,701
I mean,

6611
02:52:49,701 --> 02:52:49,871
there,

6612
02:52:49,871 --> 02:52:52,250
there could be a aliens that
are living in the stone age,

6613
02:52:52,251 --> 02:52:52,401
you know,

6614
02:52:52,401 --> 02:52:52,570
there,

6615
02:52:52,570 --> 02:52:52,740
you know,

6616
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:53,573
there might not be,

6617
02:52:53,900 --> 02:52:54,291
I don't know.

6618
02:52:54,291 --> 02:52:54,531
I mean,

6619
02:52:54,531 --> 02:52:54,950
I know,

6620
02:52:54,950 --> 02:52:55,610
look,

6621
02:52:55,610 --> 02:52:57,320
nobody is advanced enough to get here,

6622
02:52:57,350 --> 02:52:57,531
right?

6623
02:52:57,531 --> 02:52:57,800
No one,

6624
02:52:57,800 --> 02:53:00,890
no one's visiting us or at least
I guess if they are that advanced,

6625
02:53:00,891 --> 02:53:02,840
they're advanced enough to not
let us know that they're here.

6626
02:53:03,050 --> 02:53:03,400
But,

6627
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:03,610
uh,

6628
02:53:03,610 --> 02:53:05,890
so all these people that are
talking about Ufos are liars.

6629
02:53:05,891 --> 02:53:06,431
Is that what you're saying,

6630
02:53:06,431 --> 02:53:06,960
Peter Schiff?

6631
02:53:06,960 --> 02:53:07,081
Well,

6632
02:53:07,081 --> 02:53:08,820
they might have a vivid imagination.

6633
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:09,673
Most likely.

6634
02:53:09,850 --> 02:53:10,380
Likely.

6635
02:53:10,380 --> 02:53:10,860
I'm with you.

6636
02:53:10,860 --> 02:53:11,210
I mean,

6637
02:53:11,210 --> 02:53:11,650
you know,

6638
02:53:11,650 --> 02:53:12,440
unfortunately,

6639
02:53:12,440 --> 02:53:14,100
but it's not impossible.

6640
02:53:14,101 --> 02:53:14,391
I mean,

6641
02:53:14,391 --> 02:53:14,461
I,

6642
02:53:14,461 --> 02:53:18,780
I'm not going to be naive to
think that out of all of the,

6643
02:53:19,060 --> 02:53:19,401
uh,

6644
02:53:19,401 --> 02:53:19,950
you know,

6645
02:53:19,950 --> 02:53:24,120
billions of stars and the billions of
planets that may be orbiting those stars,

6646
02:53:24,240 --> 02:53:27,210
that we are the only one that
evolved intelligent life.

6647
02:53:27,211 --> 02:53:28,860
So that's probably not the case,

6648
02:53:28,861 --> 02:53:29,830
but you know,

6649
02:53:29,870 --> 02:53:30,760
there's certainly the vet,

6650
02:53:30,820 --> 02:53:34,350
the universe is vast and the distances
that you're talking about are vast and

6651
02:53:34,351 --> 02:53:36,180
whether we'll will ever be able to,

6652
02:53:36,360 --> 02:53:36,660
you know,

6653
02:53:36,660 --> 02:53:37,890
navigate them as you know.

6654
02:53:37,891 --> 02:53:37,961
I,

6655
02:53:37,961 --> 02:53:38,794
I don't know.

6656
02:53:38,810 --> 02:53:38,970
Well,

6657
02:53:38,970 --> 02:53:43,560
what do you think about the successful
cultures that haven't relied on resource

6658
02:53:43,561 --> 02:53:46,290
based economies or
haven't relied rather on?

6659
02:53:46,291 --> 02:53:47,510
What do you mean by resource base?

6660
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:52,520
I mean by explain like obviously we're
dealing with primitive tribes and people

6661
02:53:52,591 --> 02:53:54,260
that live in indigenous culture.

6662
02:53:54,261 --> 02:53:55,860
It's like saying the rain
forest or what have you.

6663
02:53:55,870 --> 02:53:56,620
Then their,

6664
02:53:56,620 --> 02:53:58,380
their economies not really based on money.

6665
02:53:58,381 --> 02:53:59,430
It's not based on gold.

6666
02:53:59,640 --> 02:54:01,980
It's based on what they can
get from their environment.

6667
02:54:01,990 --> 02:54:05,010
Their lifestyle rather is based on what
they can get from their environment.

6668
02:54:05,011 --> 02:54:07,890
How they stay alive in their happiness is,

6669
02:54:08,260 --> 02:54:10,860
is based entirely on what
they can get out of their,

6670
02:54:11,070 --> 02:54:11,521
their,

6671
02:54:11,521 --> 02:54:11,881
their,

6672
02:54:11,881 --> 02:54:12,960
their atmosphere.

6673
02:54:12,961 --> 02:54:15,750
What are the world that they live
in the jungle or what have you.

6674
02:54:15,990 --> 02:54:16,380
I mean,

6675
02:54:16,380 --> 02:54:20,160
isn't that like a more efficient and more
natural way to live and the way we're

6676
02:54:20,161 --> 02:54:22,540
living now with these propped
up ridiculous economies,

6677
02:54:22,541 --> 02:54:22,740
right?

6678
02:54:22,740 --> 02:54:23,160
Well,

6679
02:54:23,160 --> 02:54:24,530
the way we're living now,

6680
02:54:24,960 --> 02:54:25,200
well,

6681
02:54:25,200 --> 02:54:28,260
the way we're living now is not natural
because we have all this government that

6682
02:54:28,261 --> 02:54:28,801
we don't need,

6683
02:54:28,801 --> 02:54:30,600
but we're talking about
a primitive society.

6684
02:54:30,601 --> 02:54:33,330
I mean the only way and that's why he
just how an economy grows and white

6685
02:54:33,350 --> 02:54:33,990
crashes.

6686
02:54:33,990 --> 02:54:37,980
I start this book off three guys living
on an island and they've got nothing.

6687
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:39,310
That's exactly what I was asking.

6688
02:54:39,320 --> 02:54:41,480
And so this is where it
starts because you know,

6689
02:54:41,481 --> 02:54:41,610
they're,

6690
02:54:41,610 --> 02:54:44,080
they're fishing by hand and the way they,

6691
02:54:44,210 --> 02:54:44,380
they.

6692
02:54:44,380 --> 02:54:46,710
The first improvement is
somebody in Benson net,

6693
02:54:46,920 --> 02:54:47,161
you know,

6694
02:54:47,161 --> 02:54:50,340
and somebody comes up with a net that
can catch more than one fish a day,

6695
02:54:50,700 --> 02:54:54,840
but the way humans advance
is they come up with capital.

6696
02:54:54,841 --> 02:54:58,890
They come up with equipment that can
increase their productivity so that they

6697
02:54:58,891 --> 02:55:00,810
can produce more stuff with less effort.

6698
02:55:00,990 --> 02:55:05,990
That's the only way that we can improve
our standard of living is to find ways

6699
02:55:06,051 --> 02:55:06,650
to,

6700
02:55:06,650 --> 02:55:06,941
uh,

6701
02:55:06,941 --> 02:55:07,230
you know,

6702
02:55:07,230 --> 02:55:08,270
to create tools.

6703
02:55:08,270 --> 02:55:08,570
I mean,

6704
02:55:08,570 --> 02:55:08,920
if,

6705
02:55:08,920 --> 02:55:13,610
if humans never had any tools but we
would still be living like chimpanzees or

6706
02:55:13,611 --> 02:55:15,140
even chimpanzees have tools,

6707
02:55:15,470 --> 02:55:16,040
but I mean,

6708
02:55:16,040 --> 02:55:16,860
but you know,

6709
02:55:16,860 --> 02:55:19,460
not a lot but they never had the rights,

6710
02:55:19,620 --> 02:55:21,640
but at least they got
something they got to stick,

6711
02:55:22,250 --> 02:55:22,670
but,

6712
02:55:22,670 --> 02:55:23,090
you know,

6713
02:55:23,090 --> 02:55:24,800
but the reason that we have,

6714
02:55:24,850 --> 02:55:25,320
you know,

6715
02:55:25,320 --> 02:55:30,050
an advanced societies because we have
tools because we were able to improve upon

6716
02:55:30,051 --> 02:55:34,640
our hand if all we had as humans was
what we can do with our bare hands.

6717
02:55:34,840 --> 02:55:35,870
If that's all we could do.

6718
02:55:35,871 --> 02:55:36,111
I mean,

6719
02:55:36,111 --> 02:55:36,891
we can only eat well,

6720
02:55:36,891 --> 02:55:38,420
we can kill with their
bare hands and we can,

6721
02:55:38,820 --> 02:55:39,150
we would,

6722
02:55:39,150 --> 02:55:39,401
you know,

6723
02:55:39,401 --> 02:55:39,640
I mean,

6724
02:55:39,640 --> 02:55:40,473
what could we.

6725
02:55:40,560 --> 02:55:40,671
Well,

6726
02:55:40,671 --> 02:55:42,990
it's an interesting example because a
lot of indigenous cultures have tools.

6727
02:55:42,991 --> 02:55:45,150
They've actually created a team
other how to create those tools.

6728
02:55:45,670 --> 02:55:46,503
That's how they.

6729
02:55:47,070 --> 02:55:47,400
Well,

6730
02:55:47,400 --> 02:55:48,620
money was an invention.

6731
02:55:50,240 --> 02:55:51,170
Am I asking this question?

6732
02:55:51,171 --> 02:55:53,600
The purpose was if you were
going to go to a culture,

6733
02:55:53,601 --> 02:55:57,170
say like the native Americans when the
Europeans arrived and say you weren't an

6734
02:55:57,171 --> 02:55:57,591
asshole,

6735
02:55:57,591 --> 02:56:01,070
he didn't give him polio and diseases
and you didn't kill them all.

6736
02:56:01,250 --> 02:56:04,940
If you were going to try to create an
economy from scratch based on people who

6737
02:56:04,941 --> 02:56:06,140
are essentially living off the land,

6738
02:56:06,350 --> 02:56:07,340
how would you go about doing that?

6739
02:56:07,370 --> 02:56:07,521
Well,

6740
02:56:07,521 --> 02:56:07,890
the first one,

6741
02:56:07,890 --> 02:56:09,320
remember the native Americans,

6742
02:56:09,650 --> 02:56:10,550
they had money.

6743
02:56:10,551 --> 02:56:11,384
They had wampum.

6744
02:56:11,470 --> 02:56:12,380
What was wampum?

6745
02:56:12,770 --> 02:56:13,580
Shells.

6746
02:56:13,580 --> 02:56:14,060
Shells.

6747
02:56:14,060 --> 02:56:14,330
Yeah.

6748
02:56:14,330 --> 02:56:14,840
So they hadn't,

6749
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:15,590
they had money.

6750
02:56:15,590 --> 02:56:17,120
They had essentially bullshit,

6751
02:56:17,310 --> 02:56:18,143
but

6752
02:56:18,800 --> 02:56:19,280
nobody,

6753
02:56:19,280 --> 02:56:19,941
they value them.

6754
02:56:19,941 --> 02:56:20,541
They were pretty,

6755
02:56:20,541 --> 02:56:20,871
they were gay.

6756
02:56:20,871 --> 02:56:22,130
Could make necklaces out of them.

6757
02:56:22,131 --> 02:56:22,600
I mean,

6758
02:56:22,600 --> 02:56:22,891
but,

6759
02:56:22,891 --> 02:56:23,180
but was,

6760
02:56:23,180 --> 02:56:23,870
did wampum,

6761
02:56:23,870 --> 02:56:25,160
was there like a pile of shit?

6762
02:56:25,161 --> 02:56:25,940
They were like,

6763
02:56:25,940 --> 02:56:26,773
oh,

6764
02:56:27,200 --> 02:56:27,830
money.

6765
02:56:27,830 --> 02:56:32,330
Money is a great invention because
without money it's all barter.

6766
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:38,320
Barter is an inefficient way to organize
an economy because too much times based

6767
02:56:38,481 --> 02:56:39,920
on doing that and not enough gets done.

6768
02:56:40,190 --> 02:56:40,401
Right.

6769
02:56:40,401 --> 02:56:40,641
I mean,

6770
02:56:40,641 --> 02:56:40,851
look,

6771
02:56:40,851 --> 02:56:41,501
I mean we'll look,

6772
02:56:41,501 --> 02:56:41,710
look,

6773
02:56:41,710 --> 02:56:43,070
you've got your podcast,

6774
02:56:43,100 --> 02:56:43,371
right?

6775
02:56:43,371 --> 02:56:44,210
And let's say you've got,

6776
02:56:44,211 --> 02:56:44,520
you know,

6777
02:56:44,520 --> 02:56:44,671
and,

6778
02:56:44,671 --> 02:56:44,901
and,

6779
02:56:44,901 --> 02:56:46,100
and podcasts as me,

6780
02:56:46,370 --> 02:56:46,611
right?

6781
02:56:46,611 --> 02:56:47,031
But I mean,

6782
02:56:47,031 --> 02:56:48,560
you say you have sponsors,

6783
02:56:48,610 --> 02:56:48,861
they,

6784
02:56:48,861 --> 02:56:49,321
they,

6785
02:56:49,321 --> 02:56:49,661
they,

6786
02:56:49,661 --> 02:56:50,690
they pay you money,

6787
02:56:51,010 --> 02:56:51,250
uh,

6788
02:56:51,250 --> 02:56:53,240
and then whatever they pay you.

6789
02:56:53,241 --> 02:56:54,380
But if you had a barter,

6790
02:56:55,370 --> 02:56:58,850
we'd have to find a sponsor that actually
had the actual thing that you wanted

6791
02:56:59,240 --> 02:57:00,770
coconut water instead of free,

6792
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:01,281
right?

6793
02:57:01,281 --> 02:57:02,150
But instead of money,

6794
02:57:02,151 --> 02:57:07,010
money makes transactions a
lot more efficient and money
allows for loans because

6795
02:57:07,011 --> 02:57:07,910
I can loan you money,

6796
02:57:07,911 --> 02:57:10,340
you can pay me back so we
can have capital investments.

6797
02:57:10,340 --> 02:57:10,511
I can,

6798
02:57:10,511 --> 02:57:11,110
you know,

6799
02:57:11,110 --> 02:57:15,110
economies of function
much more efficiently with
money than through barter.

6800
02:57:15,140 --> 02:57:17,120
So money was an improvement.

6801
02:57:17,121 --> 02:57:18,050
It was an advancement,

6802
02:57:18,051 --> 02:57:18,531
just like,

6803
02:57:18,531 --> 02:57:19,040
you know,

6804
02:57:19,040 --> 02:57:19,581
just like,

6805
02:57:19,581 --> 02:57:20,210
you know,

6806
02:57:20,210 --> 02:57:23,390
plumbing was an advancement or electricity
was an advancement or you know,

6807
02:57:23,391 --> 02:57:24,710
the wheel was a great investment.

6808
02:57:24,711 --> 02:57:25,370
All these things,

6809
02:57:25,370 --> 02:57:29,120
money was a great invention of mankind
that allowed for a more efficient

6810
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:31,550
allocation of resources a better,

6811
02:57:31,551 --> 02:57:31,760
you know,

6812
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:32,690
distribution,

6813
02:57:32,710 --> 02:57:33,140
uh,

6814
02:57:33,140 --> 02:57:34,160
of labor,

6815
02:57:34,550 --> 02:57:34,750
you know.

6816
02:57:34,750 --> 02:57:35,690
So if you say,

6817
02:57:35,691 --> 02:57:37,370
if you take money away from a society,

6818
02:57:37,371 --> 02:57:40,070
you're gonna make that society
less efficient and less productive.

6819
02:57:40,220 --> 02:57:42,140
And so that people are going to
have a lower standard of living.

6820
02:57:42,230 --> 02:57:42,711
Peter Schiff,

6821
02:57:42,711 --> 02:57:43,580
you're a bad motherfucker,

6822
02:57:43,581 --> 02:57:44,360
but we're at a time.

6823
02:57:44,360 --> 02:57:45,950
You didn't do this for
about a thousand hours,

6824
02:57:45,951 --> 02:57:46,281
couldn't you?

6825
02:57:46,281 --> 02:57:47,090
You can keep going.

6826
02:57:47,090 --> 02:57:47,950
I can do this with you.

6827
02:57:48,460 --> 02:57:52,940
You got plenty of Scotch there so we
could get liquored up and might eventually

6828
02:57:52,941 --> 02:57:54,050
have to take a bathroom break.

6829
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:55,790
It would be something
that would have to happen.

6830
02:57:55,791 --> 02:57:56,600
But listen,

6831
02:57:56,600 --> 02:57:57,950
I really appreciate you.

6832
02:57:57,951 --> 02:57:58,731
Enlightening us.

6833
02:57:58,731 --> 02:58:02,940
I really appreciate you tolerating
my devil's a questionary.

6834
02:58:03,140 --> 02:58:03,450
Uh,

6835
02:58:03,450 --> 02:58:04,680
I think that this is a,

6836
02:58:04,681 --> 02:58:07,740
this is a fascinating episode for a lot
of people because a lot of people like

6837
02:58:07,741 --> 02:58:10,230
me are very uneducated
when it comes to finances,

6838
02:58:10,231 --> 02:58:13,200
don't really understand it and never
really have the opportunity to sit down

6839
02:58:13,201 --> 02:58:15,060
with a guy who knows as much as you do.

6840
02:58:15,061 --> 02:58:16,590
So I really thank you very much for that.

6841
02:58:16,591 --> 02:58:17,424
I really appreciate it.

6842
02:58:17,520 --> 02:58:18,140
Oh,

6843
02:58:18,140 --> 02:58:18,800
a lot of fun.

6844
02:58:18,800 --> 02:58:19,351
I appreciate it.

6845
02:58:19,351 --> 02:58:19,800
Coming on.

6846
02:58:19,800 --> 02:58:21,960
So a follow Peter Schiff on twitter.

6847
02:58:21,961 --> 02:58:23,130
Go to his youtube page.

6848
02:58:23,131 --> 02:58:24,060
What is your youtube page?

6849
02:58:24,090 --> 02:58:25,080
It's called the shift report.

6850
02:58:25,110 --> 02:58:27,150
The shift report is fantastic.

6851
02:58:27,151 --> 02:58:28,920
I have watched many videos myself,

6852
02:58:28,950 --> 02:58:30,420
but yet I am still retarded,

6853
02:58:31,200 --> 02:58:32,010
but I'm learning,

6854
02:58:32,010 --> 02:58:34,260
I'm trying and I've learned
a lot today I think.

6855
02:58:34,261 --> 02:58:36,900
I think this has been very enlightening
for me and for a lot of people.

6856
02:58:36,990 --> 02:58:37,411
So,

6857
02:58:37,411 --> 02:58:37,620
uh,

6858
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:39,570
that is the best way to follow you.

6859
02:58:40,790 --> 02:58:42,020
The shift report on Youtube.

6860
02:58:42,021 --> 02:58:42,321
But you know,

6861
02:58:42,321 --> 02:58:44,660
I do a radio show radio.com.

6862
02:58:44,840 --> 02:58:46,100
I do two hours a day,

6863
02:58:46,101 --> 02:58:46,970
five days a week.

6864
02:58:47,000 --> 02:58:47,330
Oh,

6865
02:58:47,330 --> 02:58:50,330
people can listen live from
10:00 AM to noon eastern time.

6866
02:58:50,870 --> 02:58:51,111
Uh,

6867
02:58:51,111 --> 02:58:54,530
they can just subscribe because
they can become a premium member.

6868
02:58:54,700 --> 02:58:54,950
Uh,

6869
02:58:54,950 --> 02:58:56,590
there's a free trial they
can try or that you know,

6870
02:58:56,591 --> 02:58:59,900
that you could just listen to anytime
because whenever I do a live show,

6871
02:59:00,050 --> 02:59:03,470
we then repeat the broadcast for
24 hours until the next live show.

6872
02:59:03,471 --> 02:59:05,000
So if you can't listen live,

6873
02:59:05,001 --> 02:59:06,650
you can just go to shift radio.com.

6874
02:59:06,651 --> 02:59:09,430
And just listen@yourleisureshiftradio.com.

6875
02:59:09,550 --> 02:59:10,361
Educate Yourself,

6876
02:59:10,361 --> 02:59:11,200
ladies and gentlemen,

6877
02:59:11,230 --> 02:59:13,930
understand how you've been fucked and
then live the rest of your life in a

6878
02:59:13,931 --> 02:59:15,040
paranoid frenzy.

6879
02:59:15,310 --> 02:59:18,250
Trying to prepare yourself for the
imminent demise that Peter Schiff is

6880
02:59:18,251 --> 02:59:18,940
described.

6881
02:59:18,940 --> 02:59:19,930
There is no escape.

6882
02:59:19,960 --> 02:59:21,010
Be Nice to your neighbors.

6883
02:59:21,040 --> 02:59:21,761
Collect water,

6884
02:59:21,761 --> 02:59:22,810
find a nice stream.

6885
02:59:22,960 --> 02:59:24,190
Learn how to hunt and fish.

6886
02:59:24,370 --> 02:59:24,611
All right.

6887
02:59:24,611 --> 02:59:26,830
We love the fuck out of you people
and we'll see you next week.

6888
02:59:26,950 --> 02:59:28,960
We have a lot of podcasts.

6889
02:59:28,961 --> 02:59:30,130
Shit coming at Ya.

6890
02:59:30,400 --> 02:59:30,731
Uh,

6891
02:59:30,731 --> 02:59:35,731
this weekend I will be in Chicago at the
Chicago theater Friday night with Ari

6892

6893
02:59:35,771 --> 02:59:37,330

And then the weekend after that I'm at
the Grande ballroom in New York City and

6895
02:59:40,841 --> 02:59:42,160

6896
02:59:42,310 --> 02:59:45,940
We will be talking about bitcoin
on Monday with an actual expert,

6897
02:59:46,270 --> 02:59:47,110

6900
02:59:49,420 --> 02:59:52,930
He knows a lot about bitcoin and he's
going to be pissed off at Peter Schiff.

6901
02:59:53,350 --> 02:59:54,870
He's going to be really fucking mad

6902

6903
