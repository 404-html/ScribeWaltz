1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:02,430
Three,

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,480
two,

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,710
one.

4
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,963
Hello Tim.

5
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:06,923
How's it going?

6
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:08,010
Thanks for finally being here.

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,751
Long story,

8
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:10,584
right?

9
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,540
I definitely drank too much
coffee before we get here.

10
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:13,190
So if I appear,

11
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,340
appear like cracked out,

12
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,580
I swear to God I'm not in
pills but I'm glad to hear it.

13
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,623
But um,

14
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,630
so we had a nice conversation on the
phone about d platforming and social media

15
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,300
and um,

16
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,190
what,

17
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:31,380
what was very obvious to me in talking
to you was that your way more schooled on

18
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:32,214
this than I am.

19
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,850
So that's why I wanted to have this
conversation with you because part of what

20
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:36,810
was like,

21
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,660
I've really listened to my
podcast with Jack and um,

22
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,240
you had a good criticism of it.

23
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,500
I agree with a lot of what you said.

24
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:43,951
First of all,

25
00:00:43,951 --> 00:00:46,740
I agree that it was kind
of boring and it was,

26
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,270
I think in many,

27
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,220
for many reasons it was my fault.

28
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,280
Uh,

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,650
I don't think I prepared enough for it
and I also don't think I understood the

30
00:00:55,651 --> 00:01:00,651
magnitude of how other people felt about
d platforming on twitter and in all

31
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:02,851
social media,

32
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:04,230
youtube and all these different things.

33
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,320
And what the ramifications are and how,

34
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,000
how much this means to people
to have very clear and obvious,

35
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,090
obvious free speech outside of very
egregious examples of like threats and

36
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,590
doxing and things like that.

37
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:20,820
Which I think we can all agree,

38
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:21,300
right?

39
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,910
I think this problem might be one of the,

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,120
like one of the worst problems
we're facing right now.

41
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:27,690
Politically.

42
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:28,320
Yes.

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,050
You know that twitter is where
public discourse is happening.

44
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,530
It's where journalists are and this
is a problem sourcing a lot of their

45
00:01:34,531 --> 00:01:35,070
stories.

46
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,381
Yeah.

47
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:39,260
So if you have somebody who is completely
removed from public discourse that

48
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,113
that's exile,

49
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,650
you know,

50
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:40,970
I can't,

51
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:43,470
I can imagine why some people kind of
lose their minds when that happens.

52
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,960
And um,

53
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,760
I think going into that
conversation with him,

54
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,410
well that's what I wanted it to be.

55
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:52,470
That's why I don't really
interview people any kind of,

56
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,580
have conversations with them.

57
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,080
Occasionally we have disagreements and we,

58
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:57,351
you know,

59
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:59,150
we talk about things and you know,

60
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,750
but it's not,

61
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,010
I don't have a,

62
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,660
like a mandate.

63
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,740
My only,

64
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,560
the only thing I wanted to get out of
the conversation is I wonder to find out

65
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:12,330
what it was like to start
that organization and to
have no idea when you were

66
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:15,360
doing it that it was going to be
essentially like one of the most important

67
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,930
distribution at a real
avenues for information and
act and act as an activist.

68
00:02:22,861 --> 00:02:26,310
A buddy of mine asked me if I knew why
people smashed windows smashed starbucks.

69
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,170
It's not because they think
they're going to cause damage.

70
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,840
It's because they want to strike
a symbol down of something.

71
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,760
They view a process them.

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,330
Jack Dorsey is that symbol to a
lot of people and you know to see.

73
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,830
You know what I was saying earlier is
I think a lot of people look at you.

74
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,733
You're like a real dude.

75
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,430
You know your.

76
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,670
Your conversations are real.

77
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:42,990
You have.

78
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,540
You're not one of these
fake news journalists that
people are very critical of

79
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:46,160
that field there.

80
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,280
They're biased or an agenda.

81
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,160
So when you sit down with Jack
Dorsey and doesn't go anywhere,

82
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,280
people then feel like the last person
who not supposed to let us down.

83
00:02:53,281 --> 00:02:53,880
Let us down,

84
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,713
you know what I mean?

85
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,350
Look,

86
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,640
I failed you twice as much.

87
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,200
I felt it and I noticed that I got

88
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,510
more hate for that one.

89
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:05,340
Then probably anything that
I've ever done and you know,

90
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:07,420
I'm not a guy who shies
away from criticism.

91
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:12,220
I try to figure out what I did wrong
and try to regroup and figure out how to

92
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:13,030
approach it again.

93
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:18,030
And in Jack's defense I think he's
very open to talking about anything.

94
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:24,001
And also he's also very open for self
criticism when he was openly discussing

95
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,840
what they're doing wrong,

96
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,250
where they need to be clear,

97
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:28,690
where the navy to get better.

98
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,033
I don't believe any of it.

99
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,630
I don't trust that guy.

100
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,220
Not at all.

101
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,053
Um,

102
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:33,520
you know,

103
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,450
why don't you trust him.

104
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,190
I mean,

105
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,820
first of all,

106
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,070
there's the obvious thing that is
running these a bunch of companies.

107
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,180
I could be wrong,

108
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:41,650
but I believe he actually left twitter.

109
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:42,700
He wasn't the CEO for a while.

110
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:43,900
They brought them back in or something,

111
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,090
but it either sounds like
should probably check on that.

112
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,650
So I try to avoid asserting things
that I'm not 100 percent sure on,

113
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:51,251
but me too.

114
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:52,010
But I do it all the time.

115
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,843
Anyway.

116
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,600
Jack says things like,

117
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,350
you said to you,

118
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,250
he said to Congress,

119
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,390
I believe he said he's had to Congress.

120
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,360
We don't ban people based on the content.

121
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,920
We ban people based on their conduct.

122
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,040
Yeah.

123
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,480
You literally have a terms of
service that band specific content.

124
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,060
Like what do you mean you don't
pay people based on content?

125
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,223
There's a,

126
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:11,840
you know,

127
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,180
I'll just get into naming some people.

128
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:13,391
Right?

129
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,470
Meghan Murphy for example,

130
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:14,921
as a feminine.

131
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,471
Megan Murphy.

132
00:04:15,471 --> 00:04:15,971
Is She okay?

133
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:19,270
She's that woman that the
whole issue with women.

134
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:19,870
Right?

135
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,081
So,

136
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:21,640
so this is what's important.

137
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,500
She was responding to somebody.

138
00:04:23,501 --> 00:04:24,300
Explain that.

139
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,860
So this could be standalone because
we talked about it yesterday with Sam

140
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:26,861
Harris,

141
00:04:26,861 --> 00:04:27,694
but um,

142
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,590
so I don't know too much
about Meghan Murphy,

143
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:30,580
but she's a feminist.

144
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,301
She's a,

145
00:04:31,301 --> 00:04:33,430
what they call a trans
exclusionary radical feminist.

146
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,930
But I think that that might be offensive.

147
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,410
Says let's remember why Jack
Dorsey was fired as twitter CEO.

148
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,363
He was fired.

149
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:39,830
Okay.

150
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,930
We'll see what it says.

151
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,090
This isn't fortune 2008.

152
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,050
That was.

153
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,650
There wasn't even.

154
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,490
It was sort of twitter.

155
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,480
Yeah.

156
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,690
Yeah.

157
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,523
Two thousand eight.

158
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,483
Jesus Christ.

159
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,220
I'm Dorsey's management
was so problematic.

160
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,113
Twitter's board,

161
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:53,230
this is an opinion piece.

162
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:58,510
Fired him in 2008 offering him a passive
chairman role and silent board seat

163
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,130
2010.

164
00:05:00,131 --> 00:05:01,180
He was founding square,

165
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,601
square.

166
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,434
He went rogue.

167
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,813
Okay,

168
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,230
so something happened.

169
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:05,381
You know,

170
00:05:05,381 --> 00:05:07,000
it's funny as you called
it an opinion piece,

171
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:07,834
but do they.

172
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,010
I don't know.

173
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,221
That's,

174
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:10,780
that's where we're at in journalism today.

175
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,770
Well when someone says,

176
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:11,921
well,

177
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:13,090
it has to be an opinion piece.

178
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:14,800
When someone says was so problematic.

179
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:14,981
Right.

180
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,940
I mean that's an opinion.

181
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,520
The real facts are he was fired,

182
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:18,851
you know,

183
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,850
you could state the specific reason
that was stated by the company and that

184
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:23,650
would be a non opinion piece,

185
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,240
but as soon as you flavor it,

186
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,110
it's all opinion,

187
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,320
right?

188
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:26,531
It is,

189
00:05:26,531 --> 00:05:26,750
right?

190
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,070
Yeah.

191
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,720
That is a,

192
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,630
that is an issue,

193
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:28,901
right?

194
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:29,950
With information,

195
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:31,290
that distribution of information.

196
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,480
It's flavored by opinion in ideology.

197
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,990
All of it.

198
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:34,480
Yeah.

199
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,260
All of it.

200
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:35,561
Well,

201
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:36,350
we can talk about that,

202
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:38,170
but I don't want to derail anything.

203
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:38,591
Yeah.

204
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:38,801
Okay.

205
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:39,670
So Megan Murphy,

206
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,533
please explain it.

207
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,190
She was a feminist.

208
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,180
She said she's a.

209
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,030
So she's called her a trans exclusionary.

210
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,580
I look,

211
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,990
I understand this is offensive,

212
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,310
you know,

213
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,840
I guess calling someone a trans
exclusionary radical feminist,

214
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,970
I'm assuming that was offensive.

215
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:56,920
It's just used in a defensive way I
suppose to them to her offensive against,

216
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,800
against people like her.

217
00:05:57,801 --> 00:05:58,011
Yeah.

218
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:00,440
So there's intersectional feminists.

219
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,480
They tend to be trans inclusive,

220
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,840
meaning that they believe that
someone who's born biological,

221
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,530
biological male can compete with those
bylaws biologically female if they

222
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,220
transition,

223
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,290
if they take hormones and
things like that can compete,

224
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:12,860
compete,

225
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,100
right?

226
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,970
Like power lifting,

227
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,140
racing bikes,

228
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:15,980
biking and stuff.

229
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,150
That's where I step in.

230
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:17,661
Yeah.

231
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:18,130
You know,

232
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,580
I've seen some stuff you've talked about,

233
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,120
uh,

234
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,480
the Trans exclusionary group think they
shouldn't and they've said things that

235
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:25,080
are considered to be part.

236
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,300
I say consider it to be offensive.

237
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:27,830
I'm not trying to assert
who is offended by it,

238
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:31,250
but there's one recent
story where a trans,

239
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:31,940
exclusionary,

240
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,050
radical feminist said that
the trans rights movement
as a men's rights movement,

241
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:36,320
right?

242
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,153
They say things like that.

243
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,900
In the case of Meghan Murphy,

244
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,310
she responded to someone.

245
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,120
She said,

246
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,500
men aren't women though.

247
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,000
That's not harassment.

248
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:44,630
Right?

249
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,370
That was a conversation
with somebody else.

250
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:46,641
Well,

251
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:48,590
it's also a fact she
was permanently banned.

252
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:48,921
Well,

253
00:06:48,921 --> 00:06:49,690
that's crazy,

254
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:49,940
right?

255
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,860
That saying men aren't women.

256
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,280
Okay,

257
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,091
out of context,

258
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:53,930
just say it right there.

259
00:06:53,931 --> 00:06:54,764
Men are women.

260
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,090
Who the fuck's gonna argue with that?

261
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,350
Well,

262
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,310
I'll let you say trans people.

263
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,821
Okay,

264
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:00,080
now you're into gray area,

265
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,550
but actually the statement,

266
00:07:01,551 --> 00:07:02,420
men aren't women.

267
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,100
I mean,

268
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,690
you'd have to take it in context.

269
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:06,410
Right?

270
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:06,711
Right,

271
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:07,100
right.

272
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,640
But this is where we start
getting into the nitty gritty of,

273
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,300
I guess left wing ideologies.

274
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,173
The culture war.

275
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,470
If you go on wikipedia and you look up,

276
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:16,130
man,

277
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,410
it will tell you a man
is an adult human male.

278
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,190
Right?

279
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,960
But if you look up trans man,

280
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,760
it will say a transplant is a man and so
the transection of Wikipedia is at odds

281
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,760
factually with the main section.

282
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,620
So there was an.

283
00:07:29,621 --> 00:07:30,021
I bring this up,

284
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,010
is that when it comes to twitter,

285
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:33,080
then we can clearly see the bias.

286
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,970
Twitter says you can't misgender someone
and presumably that's why Meghan Murphy

287
00:07:37,971 --> 00:07:38,804
was banned.

288
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,621
Okay.

289
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:40,820
That's a left wing ideology.

290
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,180
Right?

291
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,950
But that's what she's talking about.

292
00:07:42,951 --> 00:07:44,000
A specific human.

293
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,080
I think she was.

294
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,060
I think they were having a
conversation about somebody.

295
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:49,010
I don't know the full details details,

296
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,151
but I got to say,

297
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:53,930
look right now people are being banned
or suspended for saying learn to code.

298
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:54,621
Okay.

299
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:54,950
That's.

300
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,140
Yeah.

301
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,060
What is that about?

302
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:57,380
You explained that to me too,

303
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,030
and I saw a few people getting,

304
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,620
but should we start one at a time?

305
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,981
Should we.

306
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,420
Yeah,

307
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,181
let's stick with Megan.

308
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:02,680
Well,

309
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,220
I think we've,

310
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:03,401
we've,

311
00:08:03,401 --> 00:08:03,650
we've,

312
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,750
we've reached the point of Meghan,

313
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:05,971
right?

314
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:08,540
She was banned for having a conversation
and saying men aren't women though.

315
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,170
That was the quote.

316
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,250
Men who aren't women though,

317
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:10,800
right?

318
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,200
So.

319
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,050
And they're saying that they would
never ban someone for content.

320
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,860
They banned them for behavior.

321
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:17,330
Right?

322
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,080
So if we use that behavior
that I have no idea,

323
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,561
like,

324
00:08:21,561 --> 00:08:21,920
listen,

325
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:26,230
if you are using twitter the way twitter
was designed to engage and respond to

326
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,420
people is that bad conduct.

327
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,111
It can't be conduct.

328
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,250
It literally can't be conduct.

329
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,450
Well,

330
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,283
not only that,

331
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,830
aren't you allowed to have opinions
that are in fact based in biology?

332
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,090
Yes.

333
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,860
You should be in.

334
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,840
I have myself before we go any further
before you get called alt right,

335
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,430
you've,

336
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,221
you're very left,

337
00:08:43,221 --> 00:08:43,820
right?

338
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,540
Um,

339
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:44,711
I,

340
00:08:44,711 --> 00:08:44,991
you know,

341
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:46,880
I typically say center
left center look like,

342
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:47,990
Oh God.

343
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,760
People were saying how many
times someone commented,

344
00:08:49,761 --> 00:08:53,750
how many times will tim mentioned he's
a social liberal laying on center left.

345
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,110
Uh,

346
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,820
I was a big fan of Bernie Bernie Sanders.

347
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,380
He's still one of my favorite politicians.

348
00:08:58,850 --> 00:08:59,683
Uh,

349
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,080
people then call me a socialist.

350
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,350
You know,

351
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,071
conservatives call me,

352
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:02,460
left,

353
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,720
left calls me write whatever.

354
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,690
These labels are so fucking toxic.

355
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:08,560
It's so confusing to people and it.

356
00:09:08,561 --> 00:09:10,110
And it causes so much,

357
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,910
so much division between two sides
that might not even differ that much.

358
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:15,481
You know,

359
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:16,350
the funny thing about it,

360
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:21,351
as I got my start during
occupy Wall Street and
conservatives called me far left

361
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,510
because I was reporting on the protests,

362
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:25,291
what they were doing,

363
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,250
police brutality,

364
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,271
the arrests.

365
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:30,300
They said this is a far
left activists now that I'm,

366
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:33,360
I've always been critical of
the more extreme factions.

367
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,310
Like I've got interviews from seven,

368
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:35,701
six,

369
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:37,410
seven years ago where I'm
critical of these people.

370
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,710
Now all of a sudden they're accusing me
of being alt right for being critical of

371
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:43,920
extremists and masks,

372
00:09:43,921 --> 00:09:44,071
you know,

373
00:09:44,071 --> 00:09:45,170
starting fires and things like that.

374
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,350
All adjacent.

375
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,061
That's my new favorite.

376
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:47,250
Yeah.

377
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,980
Boot licker out right at
Jason Wu boot Licker boot,

378
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:50,281
licker.

379
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:50,461
That's,

380
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:50,760
that's,

381
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:50,941
you know,

382
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:54,720
there's a lot of phrases that people use
that mean literally nothing boot Lifton

383
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,500
I'm one of one of my favorites is to
keep it in the context of twitter.

384
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,540
They say freedom of speech,

385
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,760
freedom of speech does not
mean freedom from consequence.

386
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,400
That literally doesn't mean anything.

387
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:06,750
It literally means nothing.

388
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:07,381
Yeah.

389
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:07,621
Well,

390
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:09,690
that's just trying to skirt
around freedom of speech.

391
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:10,500
That's what it is.

392
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,210
So what ends up happening,

393
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,540
but you agree with the like you
should be able to speak your mind,

394
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,230
but there's certain consequences
of certain things that you say.

395
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,300
If I throw this bottle at the wall,

396
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:22,021
there's a consequence.

397
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:23,660
So that's a physical move motion.

398
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,690
If I drink this water,

399
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,261
there's a consequence.

400
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:25,841
Talked about the bathroom.

401
00:10:25,841 --> 00:10:26,160
Right?

402
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,970
So to to to point out that
actions have consequences,

403
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,570
not actually addressing any of the issues.

404
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,340
It's just literally saying nothing,

405
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,340
but it's,

406
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:33,630
it's,

407
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,463
it's almost,

408
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:35,790
it's just like a.

409
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:40,791
You can predict when someone will say it
and it's usually when a specific person

410
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,390
is band,

411
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,560
they'll say freedom of speech,

412
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:44,101
freedom of consequence,

413
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:44,934
all that stuff.

414
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,901
They don't say it when it's there,

415
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:46,201
people,

416
00:10:46,201 --> 00:10:46,950
they say,

417
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,783
you know,

418
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,050
but,

419
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,370
but this is true too in talking
about twitter censorship,

420
00:10:50,371 --> 00:10:53,580
there are people on the left who have
been banned unjustly and this is where it

421
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:55,230
gets actually scarier in my opinion.

422
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,440
You'll have,

423
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,870
I could name so many people,

424
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,510
just Jesse Kelly was banned for
no reason and CJ Pearson was bad.

425
00:11:00,511 --> 00:11:02,060
I think why you say no reason why?

426
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:02,670
No,

427
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:03,620
they have no records.

428
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,410
That was an accident.

429
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:04,651
Oops.

430
00:11:04,651 --> 00:11:07,100
They said it was an accident
plan for life or band.

431
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,480
He was a short amount of time.

432
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:08,660
No,

433
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,000
I.

434
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,990
So I could be wrong.

435
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,390
My understanding is Jesse
Kelly who was a conservative,

436
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:16,440
had his account just bent and there
was a huge stink in the media.

437
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:16,681
Like,

438
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:16,831
Whoa,

439
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:16,971
Whoa,

440
00:11:16,971 --> 00:11:17,051
whoa.

441
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:17,851
This guy didn't do anything.

442
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,940
Who is Jesse killing the conservative guy,

443
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:20,431
you know,

444
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:20,581
he,

445
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:20,821
he,

446
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:22,260
he posted snarky tweets.

447
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,780
He doesn't harass people or
anything is a verified twitter user.

448
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,630
So a bunch of stories came up saying what,

449
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:29,030
what is this twitter then
reinstates and said it was uh,

450
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,371
it wasn't,

451
00:11:29,371 --> 00:11:30,204
it was a mistake.

452
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,620
Now is it possible that
they're just dealing with
blunt tools and that there was

453
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:36,070
a mistake or.

454
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,870
Well,

455
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,260
yeah,

456
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,860
absolutely.

457
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,693
Absolutely.

458
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,630
But then I'd have to.

459
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,380
The reason why I don't think it was
a mistake very simply as for one,

460
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,720
we can see the ideological
bent to their rules,

461
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,000
but then you look at someone
like Milo Yiannopoulos,

462
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:48,870
like,

463
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,740
I'm not a fan of Milo.

464
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,570
I have to make sure that
everybody knows that,

465
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,580
but just because I'm critical of
the actions taken against them,

466
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,480
it doesn't mean I support him,

467
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,591
but why was he banned?

468
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:57,161
Because he tweeted it.

469
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:57,994
Leslie Jones.

470
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:58,960
Right.

471
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:03,500
And the idea was that his tweet
caused his fans to attacker,

472
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,780
which I think is.

473
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,070
That's a stretch.

474
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,370
That's,

475
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:06,551
that's,

476
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:06,970
that's just,

477
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,701
that's just ridiculous.

478
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:09,040
He didn't say go get her.

479
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,450
He didn't say attacker.

480
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,410
He was tweeting at her.

481
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:11,800
Yeah.

482
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,631
And you know,

483
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:13,181
what did he call her?

484
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:13,600
Ugly.

485
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,351
Did he say something like,

486
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,340
since he was insulting or.

487
00:12:15,341 --> 00:12:15,421
Yeah,

488
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:16,220
I think you called her ugly.

489
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:16,570
He was,

490
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,310
he was mocking this feminist
version of ghostbusters.

491
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:21,670
Right.

492
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,360
That's what he was doing.

493
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:22,901
He was talking.

494
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:24,550
It was like a critique of the movie.

495
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,220
Look,

496
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,700
I've had milo in the
podcast way back in the day.

497
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:28,570
I had them on twice.

498
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,710
I enjoyed talking to him.

499
00:12:29,711 --> 00:12:30,544
He's hilarious.

500
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,780
He's very smart.

501
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:32,710
He's very witty.

502
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:33,790
He's a character.

503
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,290
He's very much a provocateur,

504
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,790
but he's also,

505
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:37,661
you know,

506
00:12:37,661 --> 00:12:39,970
he's pushing buttons on purpose,

507
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,590
like he's trying to get
reactions from people trolling.

508
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,240
Yeah.

509
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:44,530
I mean,

510
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,330
I almost think like he
married a black guy,

511
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:47,920
just let people know he's not gay.

512
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:49,121
Let people know brother.

513
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:49,841
He's not racist.

514
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,950
It's hilarious in the way I.

515
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,480
I wouldn't,

516
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,120
I would never say
something like that either,

517
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,390
but I almost think it,

518
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,100
you know what I mean?

519
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,640
You can understand why Milo would do that.

520
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,540
He's calculated.

521
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:58,980
Right?

522
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,101
Right.

523
00:12:59,101 --> 00:12:59,760
Yeah.

524
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,940
But he did that.

525
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,810
I don't think he did that.

526
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,411
It should be clear,

527
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,350
but I mean that's how much of an act.

528
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,640
A lot of what's going on.

529
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:08,290
But if you talk to him off camera,

530
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,760
he's a very nice guy.

531
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,631
Very reasonable,

532
00:13:10,631 --> 00:13:11,464
very polite.

533
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:12,990
I don't,

534
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,750
I don't trust them.

535
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,140
I'm not,

536
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,940
I'm not a big fan.

537
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,121
You know,

538
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:15,221
he,

539
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:15,550
he,

540
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:15,971
he fat,

541
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:16,870
shamed to do it at the gym.

542
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,010
Right.

543
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,240
Literally is a picture of my.

544
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:21,280
I'll make a photo of a guy at the gym,

545
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,123
the gym,

546
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,710
and I actually argue with them about.

547
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:24,820
At one point I was like,

548
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,863
you won,

549
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:26,500
you won.

550
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,041
You're skinny.

551
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:27,610
He's fat,

552
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,443
but no you can.

553
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:30,610
You literally shamed him to the point
where you decided to go to the gym to

554
00:13:30,611 --> 00:13:32,020
better himself and you're
still making fun of him.

555
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,970
So did he would've been he shamed
him before the guy went to the gym?

556
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:35,470
No,

557
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,303
I mean,

558
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,300
I don't mean literally.

559
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:40,920
I mean like Milo's rhetoric of shaming
people and getting them saying they're

560
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:42,190
nasty and stuff and then it.

561
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:42,550
Right.

562
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,950
But at the guy listened to them
and that's why he went to the gym.

563
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,161
No,

564
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:45,250
no,

565
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:45,520
no,

566
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,630
I didn't mean literally.

567
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,060
I just mean like if Milo plays it up,

568
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,070
like I'm going to shame people
until they don't work out,

569
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,930
why would you?

570
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,090
But,

571
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:52,600
but I'll say this,

572
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,320
look,

573
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,070
that's fine.

574
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:57,550
Milo can can say the nasty things and be
the kind of person is he shouldn't have

575
00:13:57,551 --> 00:13:58,121
been banned from twitter.

576
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:58,954
That's ridiculous.

577
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,060
Why was this verification badge removed?

578
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,290
That was another.

579
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,550
It's,

580
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:02,790
it's,

581
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,490
it's plain as day.

582
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,960
The verification one was weird.

583
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,790
It's like we're going to keep you here,

584
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:10,540
but we're going to take away the
verification lets people know you're you.

585
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:10,770
Right.

586
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,340
So it opens the door to fraud.

587
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:13,440
Right?

588
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,570
And it opens the door to fake my lows
and you don't know who's who because

589
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:19,840
there's no blue checkmark that
doesn't necessarily make any sense.

590
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,560
And then we get to Julian assange
who couldn't get verified what?

591
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:24,851
Yeah,

592
00:14:24,851 --> 00:14:25,380
they wouldn't have.

593
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,280
And so a bunch of fake
accounts started popping up.

594
00:14:27,281 --> 00:14:28,010
Wait a minute.

595
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,410
We verified Wiki.

596
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:31,510
I believe wikileaks is but.

597
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,890
And then I think Julian assange his
account was changed into the defendant's

598
00:14:34,891 --> 00:14:35,724
Anja count,

599
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:36,730
but it's not verified,

600
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,230
at least I'm pretty sure.

601
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:41,570
What was the reasoning behind
not verifying Juliana such?

602
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,700
I don't think there was one.

603
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,570
Okay.

604
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:43,960
Can we do.

605
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,210
Let's take a little sidebar here.

606
00:14:45,211 --> 00:14:45,400
Yeah.

607
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,450
Can you tell me what's
wrong with Julian assange's?

608
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,891
Like what?

609
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:52,610
What is the idea that this guy is some,

610
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,840
some super villain,

611
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:56,780
some bad person that did something
terrible because the exposed some

612
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:57,441
information.

613
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,090
Like what am I missing?

614
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,960
I guess it depends on how
conspiratorial you want to get,

615
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,460
but joining a sign they,

616
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:04,790
they,

617
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,760
they've labeled him like the intelligence
agencies and I think that may have

618
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:08,594
been James Clapper,

619
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:13,310
sad that he is acting as a
private intelligence adversary
of the US or something

620
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:14,144
to that effect.

621
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,740
So of Russia,

622
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:19,570
you mean know that Julian assange just
acting independently against the US

623
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,473
against it.

624
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:20,901
Right,

625
00:15:20,901 --> 00:15:21,021
right,

626
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,260
right.

627
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:24,950
And so that the leaks put
out very damaging to the US.

628
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,120
I think that's fair to say.

629
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,000
Sure.

630
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,833
They don't like them.

631
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,310
So,

632
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,143
you know,

633
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,670
then he ends up getting accused of,

634
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:31,870
uh,

635
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,050
I believe molestation.

636
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm a year.

637
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,800
It was secrets.

638
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,340
So it's,

639
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:38,640
it's,

640
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,590
it's pretty complicated.

641
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:42,290
He was having consensual sex with a woman.

642
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,190
The content then?

643
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,461
No,

644
00:15:43,461 --> 00:15:43,581
no,

645
00:15:43,581 --> 00:15:43,761
no,

646
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,421
I don't think so.

647
00:15:44,421 --> 00:15:46,520
I think while they were in the bed,

648
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,340
then the accusation was
that he without a condom on,

649
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,800
he had sex with her again.

650
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:53,450
I don't think that's,

651
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,051
you know,

652
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:54,600
I'll be honest,

653
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,041
been years,

654
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,030
but I don't think that's the case.

655
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,980
I thought that there is a,

656
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,873
I'll say this,

657
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,591
it's been years,

658
00:16:00,591 --> 00:16:00,830
I think,

659
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,490
you know,

660
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,850
but there was reference to a condom
breaking and I think what happened was he

661
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:06,170
said it was fine or something,

662
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,141
but,

663
00:16:07,141 --> 00:16:07,551
but you know,

664
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:08,270
outside of that,

665
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,450
you know,

666
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,340
the guy has been locked up for how long,

667
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:10,701
you know,

668
00:16:10,701 --> 00:16:11,330
I think,

669
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:14,750
I think it was the UN said something
like it's a violation of human rights or

670
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:15,171
whatever,

671
00:16:15,171 --> 00:16:15,550
and yeah,

672
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,101
we went over,

673
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:16,460
it was like,

674
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:16,791
what is it,

675
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,120
six years if he's been locked
up for more than six years.

676
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:20,321
Yeah,

677
00:16:20,321 --> 00:16:23,930
it's crazy and it's
because there's an a man.

678
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:25,510
This is getting a little
bit out of my wheelhouse,

679
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,850
but I think the US has preparing a
grand jury indictment against him.

680
00:16:28,851 --> 00:16:29,684
So.

681
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,610
But again,

682
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,250
you know,

683
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:35,840
and Chelsea manning who gave him the
information is now free and out of jail.

684
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,490
I,

685
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:36,980
I don't,

686
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,810
I think it's presumed that Chelsea did.

687
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,070
I thought it was,

688
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,450
maybe it,

689
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,283
maybe it is.

690
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:44,810
It's been years since I've
tracked a lot of this stuff.

691
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,560
Okay.

692
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,300
But back to the main point,

693
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:48,620
back to the essential wasn't verified,

694
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:48,920
right?

695
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,790
Wiki leaks was,

696
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:50,271
I'm pretty sure.

697
00:16:50,271 --> 00:16:50,451
Okay,

698
00:16:50,451 --> 00:16:53,120
so verification is not just,

699
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:53,541
hey,

700
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,620
this is tim pool.

701
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,910
There's Jamie Vernon.

702
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,271
Oh,

703
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:56,590
that's,

704
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,440
that's the real Jamie.

705
00:16:57,441 --> 00:16:58,520
Give him a blue check mark.

706
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,290
It's a we don't like you,

707
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:03,110
so we're going to take away your check
mark even though we know you're the real

708
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:03,610
you.

709
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:03,870
It's,

710
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:04,611
it's like a,

711
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:05,450
it's a class.

712
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,160
It's an elite class of people.

713
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,960
A removal of approval.

714
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:09,410
Yeah.

715
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:12,860
There are some people who I think have
removed their own verification badges.

716
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,920
You can just change
your name and it erases.

717
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:19,340
I think Pewdie Pie did it
once and then immediately.

718
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:19,821
Immediately.

719
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:20,654
Got It back.

720
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,380
Uh,

721
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:21,950
yeah,

722
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:22,140
I,

723
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,480
I,

724
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,700
I,

725
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,360
yeah,

726
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,070
but you know why?

727
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,300
Why moved someone's verification?

728
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,110
Right?

729
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,501
What does that,

730
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:28,030
what does that do?

731
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:28,210
No,

732
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,420
I'm 100 percent agreement.

733
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,740
So what.

734
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:31,551
So another,

735
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:35,420
another interesting thing we can sort
of segway into is why was a Laura loomer

736
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,254
band?

737
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,030
You don't have to be
a fan of Laura loomer.

738
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:38,720
You can,

739
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,980
you can question her politics.

740
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,410
Was she a band before,

741
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,270
after she jumped Nancy
Pelosi's fence before,

742
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,610
but she's,

743
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:45,830
you know,

744
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,663
I'll say this man,

745
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,420
like I,

746
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,830
I tweeted about it if,

747
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,100
oh God talking about

748
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,550
twitter,

749
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,383
if you,

750
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,470
even if you don't like her,

751
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,630
you got to admit she
knows how to get press.

752
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,170
She knows how to generate that buzz
and then she's really good at it.

753
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,390
So what,

754
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,223
here's the thing,

755
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,110
she got banned permanently
because she tweeted to,

756
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,020
I believe it was Ilan,

757
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:06,930
Omar criticism about Sharia law.

758
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,620
She accused A.

759
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:08,880
I could,

760
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,121
you know,

761
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:09,721
you could pull up the tweet,

762
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:13,890
but I think she accused
Elan of promoting sharia,

763
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,890
which results in like all these horrific
things and they banned there for it.

764
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,030
Okay.

765
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,050
Disagree with all you want.

766
00:18:19,051 --> 00:18:20,550
But that was her criticizing a politician.

767
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:24,000
You can't have a lawsuit against
John Donald trump claiming you can't,

768
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:24,923
you know,

769
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,450
trump can't block somebody
because it's a public forum.

770
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,340
But then when it comes
to a congressperson,

771
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,700
public just permanently banned someone
for saying something critical of their

772
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:33,390
ideology.

773
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:38,390
And I think what's really critical here
is that there has to be some sort of

774
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,310
clarification for what policies were
violated and how they were violated like

775
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,250
that.

776
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:45,991
That seems to be,

777
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:50,991
especially for public figures because
it's one thing if we don't know a person

778
00:18:51,571 --> 00:18:52,231
or the background,

779
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,250
but when you know a person,

780
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:56,970
when there's a Laura loomer or Milo
Yiannopoulos and it's a public case,

781
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,300
and then you get this feeling that they
say no because we decide and this is it.

782
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,330
Well Joe,

783
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,640
don't worry because no
matter what twitter does,

784
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:09,510
they're going to be defended
by the New York digital,

785
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,260
you know,

786
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:10,801
journalists,

787
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:15,801
elites who will misrepresent what's
going on in an effort to obfuscate or

788
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,330
sometimes outright lie
about what's going on.

789
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,010
And this brings me to learn to code,

790
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,291
learn to code.

791
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:25,650
So asked you about this the other day
that people are getting banned for learn

792
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:25,981
to code.

793
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:26,161
I'm like,

794
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,630
what the fuck is that?

795
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,350
Like,

796
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,130
what is that?

797
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,800
So when coal miners were getting laid off,

798
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,250
a bunch of articles emerged
saying teaching minor state code,

799
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,080
can we teach miners how to code?

800
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,190
And they were showing videos about it,

801
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:39,630
I don't believe it was.

802
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,510
It wasn't intended to be
a derogatory or insulting,

803
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,930
but to a lot of people that came off
as this bourgeois let them eat cake.

804
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:46,501
Oh,

805
00:19:46,501 --> 00:19:47,940
your career has been destroyed.

806
00:19:47,941 --> 00:19:48,110
You're,

807
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,380
you're,

808
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,010
you're a 50 year old man with a family.

809
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:53,010
Go to Silicon Valley and do something
you've never even thought about.

810
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,610
Right.

811
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,090
Let's.

812
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,580
So it came off as to a lot
of people as just elitist,

813
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:57,060
right?

814
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,830
So when these journalists
are getting laid off,

815
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,420
this meme spreads,

816
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:01,620
I don't know exactly where it started,

817
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,370
um,

818
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,203
where they say,

819
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,740
learn to code to the journalists.

820
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,491
Well,

821
00:20:05,491 --> 00:20:07,290
this is an interesting thing happens.

822
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,113
John Levine,

823
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,920
I think his name from the rap tweets.

824
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,320
Someone from twitter told me you will,

825
00:20:13,321 --> 00:20:13,710
you can,

826
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,120
you can be banned for tweeting.

827
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,970
Learn to code at a laid off
journalists conservative.

828
00:20:17,971 --> 00:20:18,990
Start tweeting it far and wide.

829
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,230
Like,

830
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:19,681
here we go.

831
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:21,570
This is a reporter from
the rap was confirmed this.

832
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,000
All of a sudden then other
journalists come out and say,

833
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:24,863
this is a lie.

834
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,651
This is not true.

835
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:26,490
This is fake news.

836
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,020
Conservatives are spreading fake news.

837
00:20:28,021 --> 00:20:28,830
Again,

838
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,341
and they say,

839
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:30,060
we have a new,

840
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,320
a new statement from twitter that said,

841
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,213
we're only,

842
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,100
we're only banning people who are
engaging in a harassment campaign.

843
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,320
When I got a few problems is tweeting
a meme at somebody's critical of them a

844
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:41,220
harassment campaign?

845
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,440
Is that a meme it.

846
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:42,900
Yeah,

847
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,250
right.

848
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,140
It's like it condenses an idea.

849
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,403
So here's the thing.

850
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,830
I sent a bunch of screenshots,

851
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:48,970
screenshots from people.

852
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,680
Now people can fake screenshots.

853
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:51,514
I understand that,

854
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,230
but I checked some
people's twitter accounts.

855
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:55,540
I saw that they were tweeting this
and I believe for the most part,

856
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,403
this is what happened.

857
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,630
Someone tweeted something
to a buzzfeed journalists,

858
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,470
you know,

859
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,681
oh,

860
00:20:59,681 --> 00:21:00,850
you guys believed x,

861
00:21:00,851 --> 00:21:01,001
y,

862
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:01,391
and Z.

863
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:01,571
Yeah,

864
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:01,990
whatever.

865
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,980
Hashtag learned to code,

866
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,293
criticizing them,

867
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,553
suspension.

868
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,490
So then these,

869
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,720
these journalists come out and say,

870
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:08,890
this is not true.

871
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:10,780
It's just people engaging
in harassment campaigns.

872
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,021
So I said,

873
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:11,860
look at this guy's account.

874
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,110
He's got one tweet that
says learn to code.

875
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,550
Is that him harassing somebody?

876
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,630
And they said,

877
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:16,871
oh,

878
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:18,070
but you're taken out of context.

879
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,140
Then John Levine from the rep says,

880
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,730
update twitter spokesperson,

881
00:21:21,731 --> 00:21:26,290
who was my source is now saying clarifying
it is about the harassment campaign,

882
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,320
and then another journalist
comes out and says he his quotes,

883
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:29,831
fake twitter,

884
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:30,700
deny ever saying it,

885
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:31,833
but here's the thing,

886
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,850
the editor and chief of the daily caller,

887
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:34,350
just a couple of,

888
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,230
I think couple of days ago,

889
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,910
took a tweet from the daily show and he,

890
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,310
it was,

891
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,610
it was,

892
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:39,950
uh,

893
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,470
from the state of the
Union and he tweeted,

894
00:21:41,471 --> 00:21:44,050
learn to code and quote
tweeted a video suspended.

895
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,870
So it's very clearly not
about harassment campaign,

896
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:50,980
but why then were all of these
journalists so ready to jump up and defend

897
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,480
twitter when twitter.

898
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,070
You know what I said?

899
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:54,761
Okay.

900
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,460
If twitter is claiming they're banning
people who are engaging in harassment

901
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:58,000
campaign you,

902
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,160
you mean they've confirmed they're
banning people for tweeting,

903
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,023
learn to code.

904
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,410
They just consider it harassment.

905
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,810
How is it that learned
to code as harassment?

906
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,110
But Kathy Griffin saying to
all of our millions of fans,

907
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,590
I want these kids names several
times or another verified account.

908
00:22:11,591 --> 00:22:13,060
I'm not gonna name because not as famous,

909
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,450
literally calling for the death of these
kids and instructing people to kill

910
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:18,220
them is not a bountiful offense.

911
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:19,300
It's not harassment campaigns.

912
00:22:19,301 --> 00:22:19,990
That's true.

913
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,461
That uh,

914
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:21,860
I don't wanna I don't wanna
mention the guy's name.

915
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:22,540
I mentioned the name,

916
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:22,871
but yes,

917
00:22:22,871 --> 00:22:23,560
absolutely.

918
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,020
He said something to the
effect of put them in a school,

919
00:22:26,021 --> 00:22:26,950
lock it and burn it down.

920
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,630
And when you see them fire on them,

921
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,490
this guy is still active on twitter,

922
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,410
you know,

923
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,460
you know right now there are anti.

924
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,680
So now we can.

925
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:35,760
There's,

926
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,370
there's so much here,

927
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:36,710
dude.

928
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:37,240
Yeah,

929
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,170
we've got the proud boys.

930
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,430
All of them purged from twitter.

931
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,893
Okay.

932
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,490
Say whatever you want
about the proud boys.

933
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,780
If they deserve to be banned,

934
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:44,643
fine.

935
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,880
Why wasn't Antifa Bend?

936
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:47,500
A lot of people respond to me and say,

937
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,600
but Tim Antifa is random
people who were masked.

938
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:49,880
You don't know.

939
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,590
That's not true.

940
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,370
There are branded cells of Antifa that
have their own merchandise still active.

941
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,850
Some of these groups have published the
private information of law enforcement

942
00:22:57,851 --> 00:22:58,390
officers.

943
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,290
Still active.

944
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,030
No action taken against them.

945
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,370
So you know,

946
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,360
I don't know this,

947
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:07,360
this indicates a heavy left wing bias.

948
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,190
I wouldn't necessarily say wing,

949
00:23:09,191 --> 00:23:12,720
I would say intersectional identity.

950
00:23:12,721 --> 00:23:14,650
Marion ideological bias,

951
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,633
right?

952
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:15,870
It's,

953
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,051
it's,

954
00:23:16,051 --> 00:23:16,360
it's,

955
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,600
it's hard to pinpoint what the
tribes are in the culture war,

956
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,040
but twitter is clearly acting in
defense of intersectional activism.

957
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:24,760
Now,

958
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,860
do you think that this is a mandate?

959
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:28,510
Do you think this is written somewhere?

960
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,600
Do you think there's people who
are in the company that have power,

961
00:23:31,601 --> 00:23:33,250
that are acting independently?

962
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:33,820
It's,

963
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,100
it's a grains of sand to make a heap,

964
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:36,550
right?

965
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:37,000
You're in,

966
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,990
you're in silicon valley,

967
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,490
you're in a very blue area.

968
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:43,480
The people who get hired tend to hold
certain views and because they all live in

969
00:23:43,481 --> 00:23:44,230
their own bubble,

970
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,530
they believed the majority and thus
they think they're acting justly to band

971
00:23:48,531 --> 00:23:49,760
those who are at odds with them.

972
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,350
And this initial engineering,

973
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,780
and this brings back into journalism,

974
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:54,560
the big problem,

975
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,950
it's,

976
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:55,311
you know,

977
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:56,870
for decades,

978
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,950
I don't know how long journalism has been
dominated by self identified liberals.

979
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,300
There's a ton of polls.

980
00:24:02,301 --> 00:24:05,840
I think it was about 2015 poll showing
Republicans are like seven percent of

981
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:08,810
journalists or some ridiculously small
number and it's a really simple reason

982
00:24:08,811 --> 00:24:09,440
for it.

983
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,450
News organizations are
headquartered in big cities.

984
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:12,280
The big ones,

985
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:12,480
you know,

986
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,060
seeing even Fox News is in New York,

987
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,130
so there's a lot of people
who work at Fox News.

988
00:24:16,131 --> 00:24:16,964
We're actually liberal.

989
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,040
People don't seem to know
that you live in New York,

990
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:20,900
you're probably not a
staunch conservative.

991
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,340
So what happens then?

992
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,720
News breaks.

993
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,460
You've got all these journalists
because I've worked with them,

994
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:25,730
you know,

995
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:26,361
I worked for vice,

996
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:28,460
I worked for fusion and
they sit around at tables,

997
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:32,450
they meet up after work from different
offices and they talk about things and

998
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,920
they all tell each other
the exact same thing.

999
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,110
And so this is why you
see Covington happen.

1000
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,120
These people will follow
each other on twitter.

1001
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,350
So when someone tweets this Maga kid
got in the face of Nathan Phillips,

1002
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:45,440
they only see each other's
tweets and they just write it.

1003
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,640
They don't do any journalism.

1004
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,103
And it goes it,

1005
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,470
man,

1006
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,640
I can't believe for days.

1007
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,960
And that was even in the New York Times,

1008
00:24:50,961 --> 00:24:51,350
correct?

1009
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:51,620
Yeah,

1010
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,280
Yup.

1011
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,080
The New York Times a Harris talked about.

1012
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:58,040
It's mind blowing to me because the
second video that came out from Covington,

1013
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,160
you literally watch Nathan Phillips
Walk into up to the kid and get his face

1014
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,203
Bill Maher,

1015
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:02,590
you know,

1016
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:02,781
what?

1017
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:03,950
Four or five days later it says,

1018
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,270
the kid got in his face and I'm like,

1019
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,104
how are you?

1020
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,233
You know,

1021
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,860
shame on Bill Maher for,

1022
00:25:08,861 --> 00:25:09,080
for,

1023
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,580
for saying that that's not true.

1024
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,630
But at the same time we have a series of
journalism problem and this links back

1025
00:25:14,631 --> 00:25:15,464
to twitter and,

1026
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,040
and that,

1027
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:21,040
that story in particular release almost
like condensed all of the problems into

1028
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:23,630
one yet yet.

1029
00:25:23,631 --> 00:25:23,901
And what's,

1030
00:25:23,901 --> 00:25:24,141
what's.

1031
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:26,090
What's fascinating is following the story,

1032
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,111
an op Ed,

1033
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,610
I believe it was in New York Times said,

1034
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,750
stop tweeting arts.

1035
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:32,390
Had never tweet Brian stelter from CNN.

1036
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:36,860
Then got a statement that I always
say I believe because I don't have the

1037
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:37,550
sources pulled up,

1038
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,870
but someone from twitter said,

1039
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:40,730
journalists are the
lifeblood of our platform.

1040
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:45,140
And so that's why I think you've got
these predominantly New York based

1041
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,460
progressive writers.

1042
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,110
They're fresh out of college,

1043
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:51,680
they get hired for moderate
salaries to work in a newsroom,

1044
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,060
sit around each other all day,

1045
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,170
sharing the same ideas,

1046
00:25:54,171 --> 00:25:55,610
not exploring anything
outside their bubble.

1047
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,970
And twitter supports them because they're
the ones who drive traffic to twitter.

1048
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,470
They keep the conversation going.

1049
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,910
And I think that's where twitter is.

1050
00:26:01,911 --> 00:26:03,950
Bias partly comes from the other,

1051
00:26:03,951 --> 00:26:05,420
is that clearly you're in San Francisco,

1052
00:26:05,421 --> 00:26:06,290
you're going to have,

1053
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:06,601
you know,

1054
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:06,751
your,

1055
00:26:06,751 --> 00:26:07,584
your staff,

1056
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,480
the people who are,

1057
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,080
who are running content
curation and banning people.

1058
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,243
They lean left.

1059
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,380
So why,

1060
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,980
why?

1061
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,580
Uh,

1062
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,470
Kathy Griffin wasn't banned
probably because she's,

1063
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,730
she's very famous,

1064
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,590
but then I have to wonder
why Alex Jones was.

1065
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,761
So the only,

1066
00:26:22,761 --> 00:26:27,500
the only real differentiator there I
guess is either mainstream notoriety or

1067
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,120
ideological tribe.

1068
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,730
Well Jimmy,

1069
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,470
you pulled up why Alex was been to,

1070
00:26:33,471 --> 00:26:34,304
which is,

1071
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,180
you know,

1072
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,220
it's not very clear like when,

1073
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:41,210
when you think about the fact that
they were saying that he had never done

1074
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:42,860
anything on their platform,

1075
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,180
that was bantible.

1076
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:49,890
And then what was the one final thing
like and Jack didn't know what he was,

1077
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,780
he got it.

1078
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,140
He confronted Oliver,

1079
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:56,850
Darcy of CNN in DC and for several minutes
was yelling at them while they filmed

1080
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,390
and apparently that's my understanding
was the justification for banning him

1081
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:02,130
that he was harassing a journalist
or something to that effect,

1082
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,380
which is in my opinion,

1083
00:27:04,381 --> 00:27:04,940
absurd.

1084
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,200
And,

1085
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,750
and doing it on twitter.

1086
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,620
Um,

1087
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,700
I guess they posted it to twitter
live on periscope with their platform.

1088
00:27:11,701 --> 00:27:13,230
So if you do something on periscope,

1089
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:14,610
they could get you banned from twitter.

1090
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,720
Well that's the same thing,

1091
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,600
right?

1092
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,433
Because they're connected.

1093
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,200
Yeah.

1094
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,450
I don't know at what point last.

1095
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,580
I think it was last year,

1096
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,320
there was like an announcement,

1097
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:23,370
I saw it on twitch,

1098
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:24,930
but I think it also happened on Youtube.

1099
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,310
They like collectively said,

1100
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,110
if you do something on our platform,

1101
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,611
I'm sorry,

1102
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:33,150
if you do something on another platform
and we see that you could lose your

1103
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,440
status on our platform to.

1104
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:37,530
Or if that means public also.

1105
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,060
And we see that with,

1106
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,893
with Patrion,

1107
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,500
but I don't want to deviate
into Patriot and yeah,

1108
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:41,980
we can.

1109
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,020
We can get to that later.

1110
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,950
But so,

1111
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,180
so I,

1112
00:27:45,181 --> 00:27:46,140
in my opinion,

1113
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,180
so it's make it makes a good point.

1114
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,170
How does Alex Jones get banned
for giving that guy a hard time?

1115
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,070
But Kathy Griffin doesn't get banned for
literally calling for these children.

1116
00:27:56,071 --> 00:27:58,910
Leading a harassment campaign
against kids names on.

1117
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,470
Someone with millions of followers
led a harassment campaign.

1118
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,730
I'm going to use their language,

1119
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:03,031
right?

1120
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:05,130
If you're calling on your
followers to do something,

1121
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,720
you're engaging in a campaign.

1122
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:11,660
But Alex Jones confronting the journalist
who advocated for his banding is a

1123
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,503
bantible offense.

1124
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:12,750
Now,

1125
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,100
here's the important thing about Jones.

1126
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,440
Oliver Darcy said on CNN,

1127
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,070
it wasn't that Jones broke the rules
that got in band because you know what?

1128
00:28:21,071 --> 00:28:23,370
What Darcy said is he's been
breaking the rules in the past.

1129
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:23,970
They never cared.

1130
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:25,860
It was only because of media pressure.

1131
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:26,820
They took action against him.

1132
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,320
Okay,

1133
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,970
well we know many other
people break the rules.

1134
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,520
We know followup to accounts
have [inaudible] law enforcement.

1135
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:33,480
We know Kathy Griffin,

1136
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,890
lot of harassment campaign.

1137
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,210
There's no media pressure,

1138
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,380
that's one of the big problems.

1139
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:41,100
Twitter knows conservatives aren't
going to be able to level any kind of

1140
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,140
campaign against their platform.

1141
00:28:43,141 --> 00:28:43,974
There's not scared of it,

1142
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:44,910
but,

1143
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,720
you know,

1144
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,700
I often wonder why is it that as,

1145
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:48,210
as,

1146
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,000
as prominent and powerful as
conservative groups can be,

1147
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,490
why they often lose
these cultural battles.

1148
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,160
And I'm not going to say
this is the primary reason,

1149
00:28:56,161 --> 00:28:57,000
but I will point out,

1150
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,550
do,

1151
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:58,830
does,

1152
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,690
does twitter believe that?

1153
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,583
Um,

1154
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:01,950
you know,

1155
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:03,930
I often use Sargon of Akkad as an example.

1156
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,000
The liberalist anti saw character.

1157
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,280
Do they believe he'll lead a group of
liberal liberalists and individualists to

1158
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,540
twitter headquarters with
crowbars and Maldef cocktails?

1159
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,320
Of course not.

1160
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,230
So what did he get Ben from?

1161
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,553
Um,

1162
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,550
my under I with Patrion.

1163
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,800
But what happens is original twitter
thing was that he posted an image of

1164
00:29:22,801 --> 00:29:25,170
interracial gay porn
at white nationalists.

1165
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,903
So,

1166
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:28,570
but I don't,

1167
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,190
I don't.

1168
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,480
I think that was the first time.

1169
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,950
And then he got banned for that.

1170
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,440
He,

1171
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:32,670
he,

1172
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:32,821
well,

1173
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:32,941
he,

1174
00:29:32,941 --> 00:29:34,560
then he came back to the
platform and then got,

1175
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,010
um,

1176
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,090
I don't know what
happened the second time.

1177
00:29:36,091 --> 00:29:37,800
I think it was banned
invasion or something,

1178
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,350
the porn rules because sometimes I'll
be scrolling through my feed and you'll

1179
00:29:41,351 --> 00:29:42,184
just see porn.

1180
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,821
I understand it.

1181
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:43,654
It's not allowed.

1182
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,310
I porns is not allowed.

1183
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:45,611
I mean,

1184
00:29:45,611 --> 00:29:46,740
what about porn star?

1185
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,440
It is.

1186
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:47,951
I've heard it.

1187
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:49,300
I've heard it is a lot
and I've heard it isn't.

1188
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:50,680
It's definitely there.

1189
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:50,941
Yeah,

1190
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:51,131
yeah.

1191
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:51,300
Yeah.

1192
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,200
So like porn stars have porn.

1193
00:29:53,201 --> 00:29:55,060
If you go to a porn stars page,

1194
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,170
you'll see porn on it.

1195
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,860
A lot of it.

1196
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,131
Yeah,

1197
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:58,750
like real penetration.

1198
00:29:58,751 --> 00:29:59,500
Porn,

1199
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,333
they don't care.

1200
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,530
Or maybe there's truths to get marked by
someone is saying this is inappropriate

1201
00:30:05,531 --> 00:30:07,360
and if enough people
that follow a porn star,

1202
00:30:07,361 --> 00:30:08,590
I don't think it's inappropriate.

1203
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,240
It doesn't then get flagged in the system.

1204
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,180
Well that's good news.

1205
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,780
I think we may have found the,

1206
00:30:13,781 --> 00:30:14,051
uh,

1207
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,030
the Switzerland of the culture war porn.

1208
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:16,391
Yeah.

1209
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:17,680
No one wants to ban porn.

1210
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,390
The left and the right.

1211
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:19,601
They're like,

1212
00:30:19,601 --> 00:30:19,731
whoa,

1213
00:30:19,731 --> 00:30:19,821
Whoa,

1214
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:19,871
whoa.

1215
00:30:19,871 --> 00:30:20,141
Hold on,

1216
00:30:20,141 --> 00:30:20,974
hold on.

1217
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,630
It's okay.

1218
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,070
We can bend them for their ideas.

1219
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,450
We just leave the porn alone.

1220
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,170
Yeah.

1221
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:26,351
But,

1222
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,131
but the point I was making,

1223
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,990
as you see Antifa at Berkeley.

1224
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:29,860
Yeah,

1225
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,940
$100,000 worth of damage,

1226
00:30:30,941 --> 00:30:31,960
throwing Molotov cocktails,

1227
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:33,380
threatening people in,

1228
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:33,600
uh,

1229
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,221
in Portland.

1230
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:36,640
Do you had a Bernie voter
carrying an American flag?

1231
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,530
These antifascist,

1232
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,090
the Antifa tried stealing
the flack from them,

1233
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:40,871
clubbed them over the head,

1234
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:41,471
gave him a concussion,

1235
00:30:41,471 --> 00:30:42,304
put them in the hospital.

1236
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,080
So when I see the ramifications of
fire from the left or the right,

1237
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,670
what does what a conservatives do?

1238
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,210
I mean the gop couldn't even find a
yearbook in the Virginia Governor Race.

1239
00:30:52,211 --> 00:30:54,520
I don't think they're considered to
be that big of a cultural threat.

1240
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,780
They react to things,

1241
00:30:55,781 --> 00:30:57,520
they get upset about things
that are unfair against them,

1242
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,910
but they don't go through the streets
with clubs and bricks and smash windows

1243
00:31:00,911 --> 00:31:03,670
like Antifa and other far leftists to do.

1244
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,541
So if they do,

1245
00:31:04,541 --> 00:31:06,100
they're considered racist.

1246
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,350
It's always some sort of a racist mob.

1247
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,000
That was the,

1248
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,480
that's like the label
they get put on them,

1249
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:10,931
right?

1250
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:11,420
Yeah.

1251
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,100
And then,

1252
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,510
you know,

1253
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,280
like that was the label that was put
on the proud boys almost immediately,

1254
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:15,620
right?

1255
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,630
That they're white supremacists,

1256
00:31:16,631 --> 00:31:20,410
even though there was people of color
that were amongst the ranks and.

1257
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:21,860
Well they changed the
definition of racist.

1258
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,820
Do you know what the whole
origin of the proud boys is?

1259
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,950
I do this kind of fucking hilarious.

1260
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:27,823
Yeah.

1261
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,070
I'm not good at Anthony Kumi.

1262
00:31:30,071 --> 00:31:34,430
It told the whole story on this show
because it happened with him and,

1263
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,480
and Gavin mcinnes that Gavin mcinnes
came up with it because of a guy that

1264
00:31:39,761 --> 00:31:42,310
worked there and they
were doing it as a goof.

1265
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,670
Yeah.

1266
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:44,440
And then it became a movement
and then became like,

1267
00:31:44,441 --> 00:31:45,400
anybody can join it.

1268
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:46,390
And the people that join,

1269
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:46,601
they,

1270
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:51,250
they took it into a radical way and then
it became looking to beat up anti fa

1271
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,060
and it's just like,

1272
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,720
fuck.

1273
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,830
Well Gavin's crossed the line.

1274
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:54,460
That's,

1275
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:54,820
that's,

1276
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,220
you know,

1277
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,720
there's,

1278
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,130
is,

1279
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,280
and I'll point this out for your.

1280
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,720
You mentioned media matters in a recent,

1281
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,190
you know,

1282
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,540
that you're talking about Alex Jones.

1283
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,370
I wouldn't use them as
a source for anything.

1284
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,480
Well that's a good point.

1285
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:04,671
Yeah.

1286
00:32:04,671 --> 00:32:06,480
But it was just clips of Alex talking.

1287
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,353
It doesn't matter.

1288
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:07,870
Uh,

1289
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,703
they,

1290
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,570
there's,

1291
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,940
there's a clip going around
of Gavin mcinnes where you
can hear him saying these

1292
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:14,200
crazy things and you're like,

1293
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:14,351
well,

1294
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,220
he said it right,

1295
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:17,140
but it turns out some of the
clubs you were talking about dogs,

1296
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,200
they,

1297
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:18,460
you know,

1298
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,580
you really can take the context out of
things and these clips and understand

1299
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:21,850
that.

1300
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,070
So,

1301
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,690
so what happens if I'm,

1302
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:23,880
I'm,

1303
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,020
I'm even afraid in my videos,

1304
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:29,840
I don't quote people anymore
because people have taken
me reading a quote from a

1305
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:33,070
newspaper and attributed to me simply
for reading someone else's quote.

1306
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,641
And they say,

1307
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:33,731
oh,

1308
00:32:33,731 --> 00:32:34,800
but he said it right.

1309
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:35,291
I mean,

1310
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:37,180
you look at the really,

1311
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,950
Really Funny Instance of Count Dracula.

1312
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,480
Look,

1313
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,840
the guy with the Nazi pug
dog is a hilarious story.

1314
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,640
And they told him context didn't matter.

1315
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,380
So when he leaves the courtroom,

1316
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,790
the reporter says,

1317
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:47,960
you said this phrase,

1318
00:32:47,961 --> 00:32:48,794
which I'm not going to say,

1319
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,910
and he says,

1320
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:50,540
so did you.

1321
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,470
If context doesn't matter,

1322
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,570
you should be arrested too.

1323
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:52,990
Yes.

1324
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,750
But that's,

1325
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,583
you know,

1326
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,240
so,

1327
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,170
so what ends up happening
is these activists groups,

1328
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,300
they take these quotes out of context.

1329
00:32:59,301 --> 00:32:59,461
But,

1330
00:32:59,461 --> 00:33:02,870
but admittedly I think it's fair to point
out a lot of people recognize Gavin,

1331
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,760
if you can assume there are jokes or not,

1332
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:05,241
doesn't matter.

1333
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:06,320
He said things that were over the,

1334
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,070
over the line.

1335
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:07,251
Well,

1336
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,800
Gavin's the main problem,

1337
00:33:08,801 --> 00:33:10,910
the indefensible problem
was the call to violence,

1338
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,141
the calling,

1339
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:13,130
calling for violence.

1340
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,510
And I don't think Gavin's like,

1341
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:17,270
he's another one who's like a prankster.

1342
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:19,310
He's like a punk rock style prankster.

1343
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,960
And he likes to burn it to the ground.

1344
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,320
Yep.

1345
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:21,921
And look,

1346
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:24,890
I'm a fan of Gavin's
interviews on youtube where he,

1347
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:25,580
he'll,

1348
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,210
he hoodwinked people into sitting down
and talking to them or I don't even know

1349
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:30,070
if they're still up anymore.

1350
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:30,520
But my,

1351
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,680
uh,

1352
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,330
my understanding of it
ruined some chicks life.

1353
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:33,363
And I'm,

1354
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,180
I mean this like somewhat figuratively,

1355
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:35,960
she was a,

1356
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,070
a left wing individual.

1357
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,750
He didn't know who he was.

1358
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,340
He asked her to come on and her friends
basically just disavowed her immediately

1359
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:46,250
because she was talking to him
because she sounded an unintelligent.

1360
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,241
Oh,

1361
00:33:47,241 --> 00:33:48,580
I gotta I gotta I gotTa tell you man,

1362
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,473
he cornered her.

1363
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:50,840
I don't know if you have this issue,

1364
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:53,020
but for the longest time it's,

1365
00:33:53,021 --> 00:33:53,810
it's,

1366
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:58,550
it substantially harder to
interview someone on the
ideological left than anyone

1367
00:33:58,551 --> 00:33:59,300
else.

1368
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,133
Right.

1369
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:02,060
So I recently reached out to,

1370
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,540
you know,

1371
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,640
I regularly reach out to people.

1372
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:03,861
I don't,

1373
00:34:03,861 --> 00:34:05,600
I'm not going to name drop because
I don't want to drag people,

1374
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,950
but a man,

1375
00:34:06,951 --> 00:34:10,400
it takes weeks trying to
organize a meeting with some
of these personalities who

1376
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:11,890
are progressives and on the left weeks.

1377
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,263
Yep.

1378
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,210
Uh,

1379
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:15,500
even even people who,

1380
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,500
like I,

1381
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,570
I've gotten messages from people saying,

1382
00:34:17,571 --> 00:34:17,871
yeah man,

1383
00:34:17,871 --> 00:34:18,740
I watch yourself all the time,

1384
00:34:18,741 --> 00:34:19,191
but hold on,

1385
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:19,451
let me get,

1386
00:34:19,451 --> 00:34:20,120
let me think about it.

1387
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,260
And talked to some people first.

1388
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,220
I'm not saying they're doing it because
they're skittish or it's just harder.

1389
00:34:25,221 --> 00:34:26,054
It's a lot harder.

1390
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:26,391
Well,

1391
00:34:26,391 --> 00:34:28,100
they're probably more cautious,

1392
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,990
especially if you know your,

1393
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,660
where your ideology standards ambiguous.

1394
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,130
It's trying to figure it out.

1395
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,810
Oh yeah.

1396
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:34,980
If,

1397
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,481
if you're,

1398
00:34:35,481 --> 00:34:35,931
if you're,

1399
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:36,650
you know,

1400
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,371
a man,

1401
00:34:37,371 --> 00:34:38,400
even even David,

1402
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,290
David Pakman engine,

1403
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:39,770
be Dorky,

1404
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,471
get dragged through the.

1405
00:34:40,471 --> 00:34:45,040
Sometimes I see people on twitter
calling them alternate weirdly enough or

1406
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,210
intellectual dark web Jimmy Doors.

1407
00:34:47,211 --> 00:34:48,470
An interesting character.

1408
00:34:48,471 --> 00:34:49,450
I really liked that.

1409
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,260
Yeah,

1410
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,650
such an interesting guy.

1411
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,940
He's very smart,

1412
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:53,330
but he's,

1413
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:53,930
he's like,

1414
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:55,760
he's an angry lefty,

1415
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,300
but like,

1416
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,790
but he defends free speech.

1417
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,090
He's 100 percent.

1418
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:02,510
Here's,

1419
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:02,901
here's my thing,

1420
00:35:02,901 --> 00:35:03,410
man.

1421
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:04,243
I was in Berkeley,

1422
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:07,700
it was this big protest against Ben
Shapiro and there's a guy wearing a mask

1423
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:08,230
with a,

1424
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:08,570
you know,

1425
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:10,220
communist flag full,

1426
00:35:10,221 --> 00:35:11,270
like rent gear.

1427
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,280
So I got to interview him and I'm like,

1428
00:35:13,281 --> 00:35:13,910
you mind if I interview him?

1429
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:14,091
He's like,

1430
00:35:14,091 --> 00:35:14,211
yeah,

1431
00:35:14,211 --> 00:35:14,361
yeah,

1432
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:15,000
of course.

1433
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,620
I was like,

1434
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:15,881
really?

1435
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:16,011
Oh,

1436
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:16,844
that's surprising.

1437
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,290
And then we start talking and I said,

1438
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,630
how do you feel about these people
that dress in all black and you know,

1439
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:20,890
are,

1440
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,670
are fighting people and causing problems.

1441
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,061
Oh,

1442
00:35:23,061 --> 00:35:23,720
that's terrible.

1443
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,290
And I was like,

1444
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:25,250
you think so really?

1445
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,240
It's actually,

1446
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,110
I'm surprised because often when I see
people wearing fully masked up with

1447
00:35:30,111 --> 00:35:30,890
communist stuff,

1448
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:33,260
they're typically in favor of the,

1449
00:35:33,261 --> 00:35:33,530
uh,

1450
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:36,380
by any means by any means
necessary strategies.

1451
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,111
And he was like,

1452
00:35:37,111 --> 00:35:37,411
no way,

1453
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:37,621
man,

1454
00:35:37,621 --> 00:35:38,454
that's wrong.

1455
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,061
And so I'm like,

1456
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:39,301
you know what,

1457
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:39,870
man,

1458
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,950
I don't care if you're communist,

1459
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,300
I don't care if you're whatever,

1460
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:45,510
as long as not an authoritarian who
thinks you have the right to beat other

1461
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:50,511
people to instill your ideology on them
or use manipulative force or coercion or

1462
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,170
extortion like.

1463
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,191
So let me,

1464
00:35:53,191 --> 00:35:53,460
let me,

1465
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:53,730
let me,

1466
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:56,730
let me talk about why I think what we're
seeing with twitter might be one of the

1467
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:57,564
biggest problems ever.

1468
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:58,711
Twitter,

1469
00:35:58,711 --> 00:35:59,071
Youtube,

1470
00:35:59,071 --> 00:35:59,401
facebook.

1471
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:02,460
These platforms are
where we exist socially.

1472
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,294
Politically.

1473
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,860
It's where our ideas are exchanged.

1474
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:07,680
It's where we learn about who we are
going to vote for or why we won't vote for

1475
00:36:07,681 --> 00:36:08,514
somebody.

1476
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,510
When you band somebody,

1477
00:36:09,511 --> 00:36:10,230
you exile them,

1478
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,910
they're no longer part
of that conversation.

1479
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,650
So they're very much so told
you are outside the city walls,

1480
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:16,861
right?

1481
00:36:16,861 --> 00:36:17,471
You can't come in,

1482
00:36:17,471 --> 00:36:19,050
you can't talk to us and there's
nothing you can do about it.

1483
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,410
But then when you realize
the rules are actually bent,

1484
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:23,581
you know,

1485
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:24,930
they're slanted in a certain direction,

1486
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,270
you can then predict
where things are going.

1487
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:28,470
Did you see the green,

1488
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,831
the green,

1489
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:29,490
new deal?

1490
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,570
Alexandria sizer Cortez?

1491
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,820
No,

1492
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,180
there's.

1493
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,260
In so she publishes,

1494
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:35,550
it's a nonbinding resolution,

1495
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,620
which means that even if it passes,

1496
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:38,730
they can't enforce anything,

1497
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,193
but my God,

1498
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,660
I have the fact sheet.

1499
00:36:42,661 --> 00:36:43,560
They released alongside it,

1500
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:47,700
literally said they want to provide
economic security for people who are

1501
00:36:47,701 --> 00:36:48,720
unwilling to work.

1502
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,513
Right.

1503
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,210
What?

1504
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:52,043
Unwilling.

1505
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:53,483
Okay.

1506
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:54,061
I swear to God.

1507
00:36:54,061 --> 00:36:54,201
Yeah.

1508
00:36:54,201 --> 00:36:54,341
Yeah.

1509
00:36:54,341 --> 00:36:55,650
CNBC reported this.

1510
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:56,484
They cover this.

1511
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,530
Apparently this got removed from the site.

1512
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:02,720
The reason I bring this up is
there's a chart from the echo,

1513
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,573
the economist.

1514
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,930
I frequently show this in the content I
make where you can see the Conservatives

1515
00:37:06,931 --> 00:37:09,930
are coalescing around a common ideologies.

1516
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,200
For Awhile there was an upset in the
party because people didn't like trump,

1517
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:14,370
but now they've pretty much,

1518
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:14,641
you know,

1519
00:37:14,641 --> 00:37:15,600
they say it's the party of trump.

1520
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,433
People agree with them.

1521
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,260
Ted Cruz even stands and
gives him a standing ovation
at the state of the union,

1522
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,450
but the left has been spreading out.

1523
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:21,811
And again,

1524
00:37:21,811 --> 00:37:23,820
this is from a chart put
together by the economist.

1525
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,770
The Democrats are very clearly being
spread from far left to center and it's

1526
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:31,560
kind of making it very
difficult for the Democrats to,

1527
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,490
you know,

1528
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,690
put forth something that makes sense.

1529
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:35,660
If Alexandria Cortez,

1530
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,090
you know,

1531
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,260
she puts out the green new deal,

1532
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,020
but in the bill it talks about equity,

1533
00:37:40,021 --> 00:37:40,831
racial justice,

1534
00:37:40,831 --> 00:37:41,700
the gender pay gap,

1535
00:37:41,701 --> 00:37:43,170
things that have nothing
to do with the environment.

1536
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:45,570
And then Nancy Pelosi
says it's green dreams,

1537
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:45,901
you know,

1538
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:46,201
and she,

1539
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:47,130
and she derides this.

1540
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:50,680
You can see that there's a new
faction of the Democrats that have,

1541
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:51,460
you know,

1542
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,860
holy ideological drive.

1543
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,130
And I think one of the reasons for
this is what we see on social media,

1544
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:56,850
right?

1545
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:57,021
The,

1546
00:37:57,021 --> 00:38:02,021
the ideological bent of the platforms
then lead to the mass followings of

1547
00:38:02,131 --> 00:38:06,000
specific individuals who then use
specific tactics to get elected.

1548
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,163
And it's,

1549
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:07,531
you know,

1550
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:07,711
when,

1551
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:10,680
when these platforms only
allow certain ideas to form,

1552
00:38:10,681 --> 00:38:13,710
those ideas will naturally rise
to the top of our political space.

1553
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:15,360
And then you get crazy stuff.

1554
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,350
Like if you're unwilling to work,

1555
00:38:16,351 --> 00:38:17,640
we'll provide you economic security,

1556
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,380
which,

1557
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:18,571
you know,

1558
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:21,300
I don't know necessarily what that means
other than some people who choose not

1559
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:21,511
to work.

1560
00:38:21,511 --> 00:38:22,230
We'll get paid,

1561
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,640
I guess from taxpayer money,

1562
00:38:23,641 --> 00:38:25,860
but that seems completely insane.

1563
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,641
And not only that,

1564
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:28,500
where's that money coming from from you?

1565
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,590
This is actually what,

1566
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,890
another funny thing that.

1567
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,210
No,

1568
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:32,770
I mean,

1569
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,510
let him know what you mean.

1570
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:33,901
Literally.

1571
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:34,734
Yeah.

1572
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,030
Andrew is Andrew Cuomo.

1573
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:37,441
Sad,

1574
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:38,680
God forbid if they're rich,

1575
00:38:38,681 --> 00:38:40,750
leave New York because,

1576
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,121
uh,

1577
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:42,880
I believe one percent of New York,

1578
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:45,010
the top one percent pay
46 percent of their,

1579
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:46,330
of their taxes,

1580
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,230
of the revenue they use.

1581
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,170
And so they just had a
big budget shortfall,

1582
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,320
I believe it was something trump did
that caused a shortfall in there.

1583
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,940
And they were asked if
they would tax the rich.

1584
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:55,361
And he was like,

1585
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:55,631
no,

1586
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,350
God forbid,

1587
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:56,560
you know,

1588
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,940
they'll leave and they're already leaving.

1589
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,650
So I'm,

1590
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,340
you know,

1591
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,690
incoming incoming,

1592
00:39:01,691 --> 00:39:03,490
a million people saying I'm
conservative for bringing that up.

1593
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:04,240
But you know,

1594
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,290
facts are facts I suppose.

1595
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:05,741
Well,

1596
00:39:05,741 --> 00:39:09,610
facts are facts and that's what's really
important about this and that when you

1597
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:11,410
suppress any,

1598
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,940
any ideology,

1599
00:39:12,941 --> 00:39:14,860
if you are on the left and
you suppress the right,

1600
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,460
it is just going to shore up their
defenses and they're just going to harden

1601
00:39:18,461 --> 00:39:19,180
their line.

1602
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,230
That's just how it goes.

1603
00:39:20,231 --> 00:39:21,550
That's how human nature is.

1604
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,230
You can't tell people what to do.

1605
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,393
You can't.

1606
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,660
You're right.

1607
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,250
And you know,

1608
00:39:27,251 --> 00:39:28,120
a lot of people might say,

1609
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:31,270
I'm a little alarmist when I
mentioned a potential civil war,

1610
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,010
but let me clarify like I don't.

1611
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,900
I'm not saying because I've
brought this up before,

1612
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:38,350
I'm not saying it's going to be like
18 hundreds to big battlefields,

1613
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,611
but at the same time,

1614
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,490
what people don't seem to realize when
it comes to history is that when you read

1615
00:39:42,491 --> 00:39:43,430
about World War II,

1616
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,900
we've condensed all the highlights into
a very short paragraph or a series of

1617
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:49,240
paragraphs and you don't realize
the war was several years.

1618
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:50,980
There were periods where nothing happened,

1619
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:51,940
right?

1620
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,370
I was in Egypt during
the second revolution.

1621
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,180
You could look down and you could
see Tahrir Square people screaming,

1622
00:39:58,181 --> 00:39:58,751
laser pointers,

1623
00:39:58,751 --> 00:39:59,321
helicopters,

1624
00:39:59,321 --> 00:40:00,154
Apaches,

1625
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,360
and they announced on the news,

1626
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:01,960
we just,

1627
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,790
we've deposed the
president two blocks away.

1628
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,230
A dude's eating a
cheeseburger at Mcdonald's,

1629
00:40:05,231 --> 00:40:07,480
watching a football match
as if nothing's happening.

1630
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,610
So when you look at these street battles,

1631
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,570
the political violence,

1632
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:11,510
when you look at the,

1633
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:11,710
the,

1634
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,880
the biased banning's,

1635
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,140
you look at the dude,

1636
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,010
there was a guy who fired a couple of
rounds at a police officer in Eugene,

1637
00:40:18,011 --> 00:40:18,391
Oregon,

1638
00:40:18,391 --> 00:40:21,970
and some bombs got planted at the police
department or somebody planted bombs at

1639
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:22,990
a statue in Houston.

1640
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,980
It starts to feel like there's some kind
of political violence that is bubbling

1641
00:40:26,981 --> 00:40:31,150
up that can't be mended at this point
when a lot of this comes from the

1642
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:33,520
suppression that we're talking about
where people don't feel like they have a

1643
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:37,330
voice or that voice is being
suppressed by an opposing ideologies.

1644
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:38,140
You know?

1645
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,973
Yes.

1646
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,390
But it is really complicated and it's,

1647
00:40:40,391 --> 00:40:41,010
it's I,

1648
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,330
I can't claim to know
how everything happens,

1649
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:47,980
but what I will say is I believe social
media is responsible for the political

1650
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:48,521
violence.

1651
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,440
I believe it's a,

1652
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:50,620
it's not just about suppression,

1653
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,160
it's you look at the systems
that were built facebook,

1654
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:55,780
right?

1655
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,570
What content can make it to the
front page of your facebook posts,

1656
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,270
your facebook profile when you're
looking at your newsfeed while twitter,

1657
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,090
facebook has to build an algorithm
to determine what matters.

1658
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:07,870
Most companies then figure out how to
manipulate that algorithm to get that

1659
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:08,770
content in front of you.

1660
00:41:08,771 --> 00:41:11,500
Because you know at most you can
see what three posts on facebook.

1661
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,330
So what happens is early on,

1662
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:18,460
companies quickly found out that anger
drives the most shares on any emotion.

1663
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:21,100
All of a sudden we see a wave
of police brutality videos.

1664
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,300
There was one website that posted almost
exclusively police brutality content

1665
00:41:25,301 --> 00:41:26,170
and it was like Alexa,

1666
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:27,610
400 in the world,

1667
00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,500
some ridiculously high
number of blew my mind.

1668
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,220
I knew,

1669
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,620
uh,

1670
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:34,430
someone claims that they're making six
figures writing police brutality articles

1671
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:36,620
because it was pure rage bait,

1672
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,400
right?

1673
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,990
Content that just shares really easily.

1674
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:43,400
But that content constantly being put
in front of somebody breeds an ideology.

1675
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,750
You then tell someone,

1676
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,400
did you know that?

1677
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,640
You know,

1678
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,180
white supremacy is on the rise and there
are 11 million white supremacists in

1679
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:51,290
the US and they go,

1680
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,153
I can believe it,

1681
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,181
but that's nonsense.

1682
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:53,660
It's just not,

1683
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,590
it's just not the case.

1684
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:55,191
You know,

1685
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:58,520
the Anti Defamation League and the SPLC
say that at rough estimates or maybe

1686
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,540
like 10 or 12,000,

1687
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,130
but people really believe that there is
like at the president does secretly a

1688
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:07,700
Nazi and that he's being propped up
by the secret cabal or there's an

1689
00:42:07,701 --> 00:42:11,990
alternative influence network on Youtube
where you and me or somehow trying to

1690
00:42:11,991 --> 00:42:12,950
convince people to,

1691
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:13,131
you know,

1692
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,000
this is ridiculous.

1693
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,170
So that's the,

1694
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,370
the main thing.

1695
00:42:16,430 --> 00:42:16,880
Yeah.

1696
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,720
What was it called?

1697
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:19,760
Data and society.

1698
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:20,770
And that's,

1699
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,890
that's that nonsense.

1700
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,161
Yeah,

1701
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:22,550
we did.

1702
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:22,941
We did.

1703
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,050
We get connected to,

1704
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,970
are we outright adjacent
or we boot licker that one.

1705
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,580
We're part of the network that feeds
into extremist ideologies and other.

1706
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,390
They connected me with
people with schizophrenia.

1707
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,360
The way it's drawn out,

1708
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:38,270
the little map where one person's
connected to another person.

1709
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,140
And what I said to her,

1710
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:39,981
I said,

1711
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:42,140
Barbara Walters interviewed Fidel Castro.

1712
00:42:42,141 --> 00:42:43,280
Did that make her a communist?

1713
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,641
You know,

1714
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,391
that's what I tweeted at her.

1715
00:42:44,391 --> 00:42:44,601
I'm like,

1716
00:42:44,601 --> 00:42:45,081
you're crazy.

1717
00:42:45,081 --> 00:42:46,490
This is a crazy way to look at things.

1718
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,410
But what happened with that story?

1719
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,450
Media reported uncritically.

1720
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,280
I reached out to a bunch of journalists.

1721
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:53,600
I know a ton of journalists.

1722
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:53,950
I'm a,

1723
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:55,850
I'm a member of the
online news association.

1724
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:56,230
You're like,

1725
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,180
I've been a speaker at their events
and I'm reaching out to the journalists

1726
00:42:59,181 --> 00:42:59,450
like,

1727
00:42:59,450 --> 00:42:59,751
hey,

1728
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:00,890
why did you guys write that?

1729
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:02,510
That's just completely fake.

1730
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,680
It's got my name,

1731
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:04,850
like my name in the middle,

1732
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:05,983
you know me,

1733
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,970
you can call me to quote you.

1734
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,410
They don't do it right.

1735
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,680
They just uncritically reported and
there's a couple reasons for it.

1736
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:13,800
The media,

1737
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,060
uh,

1738
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,010
facebook recently changed their algorithm.

1739
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:16,520
I don't know,

1740
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,480
this was a while ago.

1741
00:43:17,481 --> 00:43:18,410
They may have changed it again,

1742
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,270
but it was a huge hit to the incomes of
a lot of these companies when all of a

1743
00:43:23,271 --> 00:43:26,030
sudden news articles stopped appearing
as much because facebook wanted friends

1744
00:43:26,031 --> 00:43:28,910
and family to be more connected
and less so news organizations.

1745
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:33,050
So these news organizations who write
this viral clickbait and rage content

1746
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:34,130
weren't getting as much traffic.

1747
00:43:34,131 --> 00:43:34,580
So what are they,

1748
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:34,790
you know,

1749
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,623
they have to go crazy.

1750
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,643
They have to,

1751
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:36,921
you know,

1752
00:43:36,921 --> 00:43:37,281
and so it's,

1753
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:37,471
it's,

1754
00:43:37,471 --> 00:43:41,210
it's a downward spiral of where these
journalists all follow each other.

1755
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,650
They start producing.

1756
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:43,441
I don't,

1757
00:43:43,441 --> 00:43:44,510
I don't think it's a conspiracy.

1758
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,201
They produce this stuff.

1759
00:43:45,201 --> 00:43:49,220
I think they're hired specifically because
the content they produce is viral and

1760
00:43:49,221 --> 00:43:50,150
it's viral for a reason.

1761
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,200
Right.

1762
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,340
And so the more they produce it,

1763
00:43:52,341 --> 00:43:53,870
the more they eat their own,

1764
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,710
you know,

1765
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:55,940
excrement essentially.

1766
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,540
And then it's a game of telephone where
they're sitting in a circle constantly

1767
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:02,090
telling each other the craziest things
and it gets crazier and crazier.

1768
00:44:02,570 --> 00:44:05,540
But another aspect of it is when
they write an article saying,

1769
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:05,721
you know,

1770
00:44:05,721 --> 00:44:06,554
trump is racist,

1771
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:07,730
it goes viral.

1772
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:09,380
The next day they can't
read the same article.

1773
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:09,980
So they write,

1774
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,510
trump is the most racist.

1775
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,640
The next day they have to
get to keep one upping it.

1776
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:14,301
And it gets.

1777
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:16,220
We talked about this with Forbes articles,

1778
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,500
the term nasty surprise.

1779
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,000
They use it with tech,

1780
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,260
like they'll say the new galaxy
s 10 has a nasty surprise.

1781
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,120
The new iphone 10 has a nasty surprise.

1782
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,410
And keep saying has it,

1783
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,281
it's hilarious.

1784
00:44:28,281 --> 00:44:32,010
It's almost like there's a form letter
and they just take whatever x box,

1785
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,020
stick it in their nasty surprise and it's,

1786
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:38,720
it's 100 percent clickbait and it's
Forbes and you telling me that Forbes,

1787
00:44:38,721 --> 00:44:41,640
that was essentially a user contributions.

1788
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,743
Yeah,

1789
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,720
I could probably submit an article.

1790
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:48,780
They have like a network of people
don't know how you get approved,

1791
00:44:48,781 --> 00:44:51,780
but there's a lot of articles that get
written about like the new video game

1792
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:52,081
today.

1793
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:54,720
So it's like a clickbait
title can just get some ads,

1794
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,090
has a nasty surprise,

1795
00:44:56,091 --> 00:45:00,520
but it's almost like they have like a
pattern that they've just accepted that

1796
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:01,363
it's going to work.

1797
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,630
But it's not a conspiracy.

1798
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,560
It's just like minded people who
are only ever around each other,

1799
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,750
sharing the same things among each other,

1800
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,310
believing all the same things.

1801
00:45:10,670 --> 00:45:14,540
And so you'll notice that certain words
emerge specifically amongst certain

1802
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:15,230
groups,

1803
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:15,710
you know,

1804
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,100
like the left will use certain words
and then if like learn to code.

1805
00:45:19,101 --> 00:45:20,990
It doesn't appear that
much in left wing rhetoric.

1806
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,190
But the Conservatives and the anti
identitarian types understand what it is.

1807
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,570
And so the justification for
banning someone for saying
learn to code regardless

1808
00:45:29,571 --> 00:45:31,160
of the context seems insane.

1809
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:31,910
Yeah.

1810
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:32,630
That seems.

1811
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,720
It seems like you got one in
particular is almost independent.

1812
00:45:35,721 --> 00:45:35,990
I mean,

1813
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,680
not almost.

1814
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,550
That's indefensible.

1815
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,443
Absolutely.

1816
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,730
Like there have been people who,

1817
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,200
uh,

1818
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:41,560
let,

1819
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:41,691
let,

1820
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:41,820
let,

1821
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,071
let me,

1822
00:45:42,071 --> 00:45:42,800
let me be fair.

1823
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,210
There are people on the
left who have been banned.

1824
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,073
Absolutely.

1825
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:48,830
There was a lot of Venezuelan accounts
that were banned and a lot of people were

1826
00:45:48,831 --> 00:45:49,460
very critical.

1827
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,510
I saw Abby Martin was,

1828
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:53,330
was criticizing this because they
accused them of being government actors

1829
00:45:53,331 --> 00:45:54,920
because they were pro
Venezuelan government.

1830
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,970
But the most,

1831
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:56,990
the one thing,

1832
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,170
there's some occupy Wall Street
activists who absolutely detested me.

1833
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:01,393
They lie about me.

1834
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,050
I do not like them for doing this.

1835
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,750
They were banned abruptly
for literally no reason.

1836
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:08,870
And this is what's more worrisome
to me is that no one defended them.

1837
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,630
No one defended them because
conservative certainly won't,

1838
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,240
but neither will the mainstream,

1839
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:15,200
you know,

1840
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,490
ideological left.

1841
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,820
These are activists for class issues,

1842
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:22,730
for international issues
there on the left squarely.

1843
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,370
And they were accused guess
of being bots or something.

1844
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:29,240
Just it was just an abrupt purge of like
50 accounts and some of them were like

1845
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:33,500
independent citizen journalists
just wiped out and with no recourse,

1846
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,850
no recourse whatsoever.

1847
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,880
So I mean at some point you have to
realize how important twitter is when the

1848
00:46:39,921 --> 00:46:40,730
president is on it.

1849
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,140
Could you imagine if there was a physical
space where everyone was talking and

1850
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:48,050
the president shows up and everyone
keeps yelling at them and they're all

1851
00:46:48,051 --> 00:46:51,200
talking because you had that lawsuit
where they said it was a public forum.

1852
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,210
Imagine that happens and then a private
private individual bars you from hearing

1853
00:46:56,211 --> 00:46:57,200
what the president has to say.

1854
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:58,521
Right?

1855
00:46:58,521 --> 00:46:59,540
It's a complicated issue.

1856
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:01,640
You know,

1857
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:03,920
you get a lot of people on the left
saying private businesses can do whatever

1858
00:47:03,921 --> 00:47:04,310
they want.

1859
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:08,000
That blew my mind because the left
was usually about not letting massive

1860
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:08,631
multinational,

1861
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:10,910
billion dollar corporations get
away with suppressing speech,

1862
00:47:10,911 --> 00:47:11,450
but

1863
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:14,180
it was another thing that people get
pissed at me about Jack Dorsey and rightly

1864
00:47:14,181 --> 00:47:19,181
so that he said that it's a human right
that the Medicaid online as a human,

1865
00:47:19,191 --> 00:47:20,840
but the fact that he said it,

1866
00:47:20,870 --> 00:47:23,270
but yet all these people were banned.

1867
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:27,900
So how was like to take
away someone's human right?

1868
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,210
There should be an egregious example.

1869
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,180
I mean it should be something like doxing,

1870
00:47:34,181 --> 00:47:36,010
someone like calling for violence,

1871
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:37,690
like trying and buddy buddy,

1872
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,560
but even then,

1873
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:41,380
but clearly that's not the case
if Kathy Griffin still online,

1874
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,160
but hold on,

1875
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,430
you can kill a human
being and get 25 years.

1876
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:46,271
Right.

1877
00:47:46,271 --> 00:47:46,751
Good point.

1878
00:47:46,751 --> 00:47:48,580
So you can literally
strip someone of their,

1879
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,533
of their.

1880
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:50,050
Yes.

1881
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,130
Everything and still not
be purged permanently.

1882
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,590
This was one of the things that
Jack and I discussed post podcast.

1883
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:57,340
I said,

1884
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:57,641
you know,

1885
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:59,860
when we were going back and
forth about doing this again,

1886
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:00,151
you know,

1887
00:48:00,151 --> 00:48:04,870
I told him I would really like to
see if there's some sort of a path to

1888
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:05,704
redemption,

1889
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:06,940
like uh,

1890
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,510
you know,

1891
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:08,081
for example,

1892
00:48:08,081 --> 00:48:08,914
for Milo,

1893
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:09,341
I mean,

1894
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:13,690
who's to say like we talked
about yesterday about
Christian ecoline who was a

1895
00:48:13,691 --> 00:48:18,691
white supremacist who realized the
error of his ways and then became this

1896
00:48:19,481 --> 00:48:23,680
activist against racism and now he
gives these ted speeches and he's,

1897
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,150
you know,

1898
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:29,140
wha accepted by everyone as being this
guy who's achieved redemption and really

1899
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:30,760
understands the error of his ways.

1900
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,800
If Milo was banned for life,

1901
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:34,600
Milo is only like 34 years old.

1902
00:48:34,601 --> 00:48:34,811
Right.

1903
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,550
How old is Milo around there?

1904
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:37,384
I honestly don't know.

1905
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:37,550
I,

1906
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,080
I hope,

1907
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,150
I hope I didn't make them older
than he is and probably be mad,

1908
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:41,410
but whatever it is,

1909
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,390
like who's to say that Milo,

1910
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,170
you know,

1911
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:48,070
in three years from now won't have
a change of heart or you know,

1912
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:49,750
have a fucking acid trip or something.

1913
00:48:49,751 --> 00:48:50,250
That makes sense.

1914
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,640
I'm a different person.

1915
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:52,870
But if you're banned for life,

1916
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:53,791
we are.

1917
00:48:53,791 --> 00:48:57,870
We throwing people away like you
ever see that tweet from like,

1918
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:58,691
I'm going to say,

1919
00:48:58,691 --> 00:48:59,560
I think it was tyler,

1920
00:48:59,561 --> 00:49:00,850
the creator where he said,

1921
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:02,110
how is cyber bullying real?

1922
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:02,351
Just,

1923
00:49:02,351 --> 00:49:02,561
you know,

1924
00:49:02,561 --> 00:49:03,430
like close your eyes.

1925
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,540
Go inside,

1926
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,373
close your eyes.

1927
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:06,190
That's,

1928
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:06,550
you know.

1929
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:07,480
I'm sorry man.

1930
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:08,591
You want a band?

1931
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:09,370
Hate speech.

1932
00:49:09,370 --> 00:49:10,210
I can understand.

1933
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:11,620
I am no fan of hate speech.

1934
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,633
I think it's wrong.

1935
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,590
I think you shouldn't target people for,

1936
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:15,730
for a specific characteristics.

1937
00:49:15,731 --> 00:49:16,630
We should respect one another.

1938
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:17,561
At the same time.

1939
00:49:17,561 --> 00:49:20,980
I'm also a human adult who
understands sometimes people are mean.

1940
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,120
You ever walked out?

1941
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,030
You ever go to a subway in Los Angeles
and some guy starts calling you all the

1942
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:25,710
names in the book.

1943
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:26,543
What are you gonna do about it?

1944
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:27,663
Nothing.

1945
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:28,751
That's just life.

1946
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:30,670
People are mean sometimes
if they punched you,

1947
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:31,504
that crossed the line.

1948
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:32,501
But on twitter,

1949
00:49:32,501 --> 00:49:32,681
you know,

1950
00:49:32,681 --> 00:49:34,480
Milo wants say mean things block mute.

1951
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:34,970
You know what I'd do?

1952
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:35,520
I press.

1953
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:35,950
Yeah,

1954
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:37,450
mute black people.

1955
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:38,540
I blocked some people.

1956
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:39,311
You had the Milo.

1957
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,810
One was very,

1958
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:41,673
very weird.

1959
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:42,900
They were looking for.

1960
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,440
And here's the other part of it,

1961
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,590
you know what he ultimately got in trouble
air quotes for was him talking about

1962
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:56,221
the positive experiences that he
had as a young man being molested.

1963
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:58,660
I think that was after he
was already band though.

1964
00:49:58,900 --> 00:49:59,530
I don't think so.

1965
00:49:59,530 --> 00:49:59,651
Well,

1966
00:49:59,651 --> 00:50:01,180
he might've been banned
from twitter already,

1967
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,820
but then he got kicked off
of Youtube and he left.

1968
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:04,930
I don't think he stayed off youtube.

1969
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:05,291
He's,

1970
00:50:05,291 --> 00:50:06,160
I think he's still on Youtube.

1971
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:06,520
Was it,

1972
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,290
was it Breitbart that he left fired?

1973
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:09,190
He quit Breitbart,

1974
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:10,410
Breitbart.

1975
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,380
It's another thing too though.

1976
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:12,340
Uh,

1977
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:12,760
you know,

1978
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,220
I see all these journalists writing
all these articles saying like,

1979
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,001
Milo has gone,

1980
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:17,620
Milo is whining and he's no more.

1981
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:17,950
I'm like,

1982
00:50:17,950 --> 00:50:21,550
Dude's got like 6 million followers
across his instagram is youtube and his

1983
00:50:21,551 --> 00:50:22,240
facebook,

1984
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,120
he posts all the time you have.

1985
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:27,920
He's not in the public conversation
as much as he was before because

1986
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,080
Dave censored him when
you're not on twitter.

1987
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:30,530
Right?

1988
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:34,790
The journalists who make up a huge core
of their verified users who apparently

1989
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,540
according to CNN and a car,

1990
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,190
like the lifeblood,

1991
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:36,860
their platform on top.

1992
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,693
I'm talking about you.

1993
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,230
But here's my point,

1994
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:43,220
he's not saying that men should
go have sex with younger boys.

1995
00:50:43,221 --> 00:50:46,130
He was basically saying that it could
be a positive experience because it was

1996
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:46,660
for him.

1997
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:46,820
Well,

1998
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,290
I don't,

1999
00:50:47,290 --> 00:50:50,120
I don't know anything about what
happened in that capacity in my.

2000
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:54,020
My point was if I said when I was 13,

2001
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:55,880
a 21 year old girl fondled me,

2002
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,580
do you think I'd get in trouble
if I said it was awesome?

2003
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,080
No better wouldn't.

2004
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,440
You wouldn't know.

2005
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,733
Yeah,

2006
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,510
that's right.

2007
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:09,950
My brother was pointing out because a law
and order Svu is basically on 24 slash

2008
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,500
seven.

2009
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,100
It's like 98 percent of the
episodes are only ever about women.

2010
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,720
Never about men being victims.

2011
00:51:14,721 --> 00:51:15,554
Sometimes they are.

2012
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:16,663
But he was like,

2013
00:51:16,970 --> 00:51:17,121
oh,

2014
00:51:17,121 --> 00:51:17,880
I just realized that.

2015
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:18,500
And I was like,

2016
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,333
let's decide.

2017
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,900
Well that's special victims unit.

2018
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:21,741
That's the show.

2019
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:22,041
I mean the,

2020
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:22,490
the,

2021
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,560
they have so many
versions of law and order.

2022
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:25,640
But that one in particular,

2023
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:25,931
I don't know.

2024
00:51:25,931 --> 00:51:27,380
But I mean it deals with sex crimes.

2025
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:27,890
Yes.

2026
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:30,470
And almost every episode rarely
ever talks about male victims,

2027
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:31,603
which exists.

2028
00:51:31,610 --> 00:51:32,151
You know what I mean?

2029
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:33,280
And so I,

2030
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:35,300
I don't want to get like
into a men's rights thing,

2031
00:51:35,301 --> 00:51:35,541
but no,

2032
00:51:35,541 --> 00:51:37,550
I think it's fairly
obvious to a lot of people.

2033
00:51:37,551 --> 00:51:38,384
Like you mentioned,

2034
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,140
if you said it,

2035
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,670
nobody would have cared but Milo's gay.

2036
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,150
Right.

2037
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:41,983
And so that becomes,

2038
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,211
you know,

2039
00:51:42,211 --> 00:51:43,040
becomes a thing for him.

2040
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:43,640
Yes.

2041
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,300
Yeah,

2042
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,133
yeah.

2043
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:46,013
It's um,

2044
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:48,743
there's,

2045
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:52,610
we need some kind of clear guidelines,

2046
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:53,630
right,

2047
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:57,310
where you can operate inside
these guidelines and also fair.

2048
00:51:58,500 --> 00:51:59,030
It's just,

2049
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,690
I mean,

2050
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:00,230
to an extent,

2051
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,960
to an extent that it is tough shit.

2052
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:05,030
Comedians will be allowed to
operate dancing on the line,

2053
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:06,283
you know what I mean?

2054
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:09,350
Like obviously I think so I'll tell you,

2055
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,210
I can't tell you this shit.

2056
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,170
I'll tell you something
after this is over,

2057
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,980
you're going to think it's hilarious and
we'll find out about it in the future.

2058
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:16,181
Oh,

2059
00:52:16,181 --> 00:52:17,660
not everyone's going to be secret.

2060
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:17,820
No,

2061
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:17,881
no,

2062
00:52:17,881 --> 00:52:17,991
no.

2063
00:52:17,991 --> 00:52:18,621
It's not a secret.

2064
00:52:18,621 --> 00:52:19,820
It's a comedy secret.

2065
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,170
It's,

2066
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,260
it's about something.

2067
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,070
But,

2068
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:22,903
you know,

2069
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:25,280
but I'll take this call you to remind me,

2070
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:28,340
but I'll take this opportunity to segue
into another point when it comes to the

2071
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:28,761
bias,

2072
00:52:28,761 --> 00:52:29,594
right?

2073
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:31,550
How is it that you can have Jimmy Kimmel,

2074
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:34,370
Jimmy Fallon dress in black face on there?

2075
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:37,160
Glen a CNN made a big list.

2076
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:38,240
I don't know exactly when it happened.

2077
00:52:38,241 --> 00:52:40,010
I think a kimball was on the man show.

2078
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:41,870
He dressed like a basketball player.

2079
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,470
Oh Jeez.

2080
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:43,251
And Jimmy Fallon.

2081
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:44,084
Just like Chris Rock.

2082
00:52:44,090 --> 00:52:44,331
Oh,

2083
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:45,080
Jesus.

2084
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,010
Sarah Silverman did it.

2085
00:52:46,430 --> 00:52:46,641
She.

2086
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:47,720
I think she addressed it though.

2087
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:48,350
Yes.

2088
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:48,840
Everybody.

2089
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,060
Nobody loses their minds.

2090
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,960
Nobody loses their minds over
that because they're on the left,

2091
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:53,450
you think?

2092
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:53,961
I Dunno.

2093
00:52:53,961 --> 00:52:54,440
I Dunno.

2094
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:54,681
It's,

2095
00:52:54,681 --> 00:52:54,861
it's,

2096
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:55,071
I,

2097
00:52:55,071 --> 00:52:55,904
I honestly,

2098
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,040
I would say to an extent,

2099
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,750
there's probably some kind of tribal bias.

2100
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,050
Well,

2101
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:03,470
I think when you're going back to high
school yearbooks looking for outrage from

2102
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:04,940
55 year old people,

2103
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,350
if you've lost the plot,

2104
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:06,980
isn't that.

2105
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,551
Isn't that crazy?

2106
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,420
It's fucking insane.

2107
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:08,511
Well,

2108
00:53:08,511 --> 00:53:08,691
what's.

2109
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:11,690
What's crazier is when Kathy Griffin
tweets out that the three points are hand

2110
00:53:11,691 --> 00:53:14,630
sign at a Covington basketball
game was a Nazi hand gesture.

2111
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:16,381
Like the three point.

2112
00:53:16,381 --> 00:53:16,560
Oh,

2113
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,780
to three point seven as this thing.

2114
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,290
Yup.

2115
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:18,600
Yeah.

2116
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:18,920
Okay.

2117
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:20,380
I'm not going to do it because
the photos a little slow.

2118
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,213
Okay.

2119
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:21,751
People send it,

2120
00:53:21,751 --> 00:53:26,700
definitely put a series of them on my
instagram when I found out I put bill

2121
00:53:26,701 --> 00:53:27,600
cosby doing it.

2122
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,620
Someone found one of me from news radio.

2123
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:31,483
Isn't it?

2124
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:31,861
Isn't it?

2125
00:53:31,861 --> 00:53:32,970
Aren't they using it though,

2126
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:33,870
for that symbol?

2127
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:34,670
I know that it's a,

2128
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:35,640
it's a universal symbol.

2129
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:36,810
That means a lot of things,

2130
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,670
but using it as that symbol,

2131
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:40,400
they're not using it to
mean white power and.

2132
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:40,471
No,

2133
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:41,240
they're not.

2134
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,470
What are the one that said it's not?

2135
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:42,771
Okay.

2136
00:53:42,771 --> 00:53:43,220
Well,

2137
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,580
what were those cops using it for?

2138
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:45,150
That's the,

2139
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:45,511
that's the,

2140
00:53:45,511 --> 00:53:46,344
that's the uh,

2141
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:46,860
the,

2142
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,491
what is it called?

2143
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:48,181
It's called the okay.

2144
00:53:48,181 --> 00:53:52,650
Game of the don't look game where you
put the symbol under your waist and if

2145
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:53,730
someone looks at you get to punch him.

2146
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,440
What is a game?

2147
00:53:55,441 --> 00:53:56,274
Kids play?

2148
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,521
No,

2149
00:53:56,521 --> 00:53:56,701
no,

2150
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:56,850
no,

2151
00:53:56,850 --> 00:53:57,001
no,

2152
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:57,460
no.

2153
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,280
The Swat cops that had it on their,

2154
00:53:59,281 --> 00:53:59,910
on their legs?

2155
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:00,061
No,

2156
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:01,020
there were all doing it.

2157
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,010
There was like four of them doing it
in a photograph and then holding it up.

2158
00:54:05,011 --> 00:54:06,210
Or are they holding on their legs?

2159
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,580
I don't know.

2160
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:07,790
No,

2161
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:08,623
but let's,

2162
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,030
let's,

2163
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:09,580
let's,

2164
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:09,780
let's,

2165
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,613
let's break this down.

2166
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,551
I can explain this to you.

2167
00:54:11,551 --> 00:54:11,790
Okay.

2168
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,390
Please do.

2169
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:12,991
Donald trump,

2170
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:13,501
when he talks,

2171
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:14,570
he makes the okay sign.

2172
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,201
He's pointing.

2173
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:17,034
He's making.

2174
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:17,371
I mean,

2175
00:54:17,371 --> 00:54:17,611
okay,

2176
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:18,421
well if he does it this way,

2177
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,254
is that okay?

2178
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:19,631
Oh No,

2179
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:19,801
I don't.

2180
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:20,634
He does this.

2181
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:21,181
No,

2182
00:54:21,181 --> 00:54:23,610
I don't care what trump
does the flip people off.

2183
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:24,444
It's probably a bad thing,

2184
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:24,841
but.

2185
00:54:24,841 --> 00:54:26,490
So what happens is he starts doing the.

2186
00:54:26,491 --> 00:54:26,701
Okay.

2187
00:54:26,701 --> 00:54:27,220
10 they'll.

2188
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:27,450
Okay.

2189
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:27,721
Okay.

2190
00:54:27,721 --> 00:54:28,290
Sign.

2191
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:30,360
So a bunch of trump
supporters start doing it too,

2192
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,111
to be like,

2193
00:54:31,111 --> 00:54:31,261
Hey,

2194
00:54:31,261 --> 00:54:31,850
I'm like trump.

2195
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:32,660
Right?

2196
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,530
A four Chan campaign gets started saying,

2197
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:35,430
convince everyone.

2198
00:54:35,431 --> 00:54:36,690
This actually means white power,

2199
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,170
right?

2200
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:37,920
It was fake.

2201
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,960
The Anti Defamation
League said it was fake.

2202
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:40,560
Yes.

2203
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,330
A bunch of journalists said it was real.

2204
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,010
That's what I put on my instagram.

2205
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,600
Put all this on my instagram,

2206
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:49,170
including the article where would show
the original thing came fortunate.

2207
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,011
Fortunate.

2208
00:54:50,011 --> 00:54:50,940
It's fucking hilarious.

2209
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:51,820
Powerful.

2210
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,290
It's Whoa.

2211
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,180
It's hilarious how much shit they start.

2212
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,680
They started the flat earth movement.

2213
00:54:55,681 --> 00:54:55,921
Okay.

2214
00:54:55,921 --> 00:54:56,860
There's the guy was that?

2215
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:57,960
I'd never heard that.

2216
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:58,330
Oh yeah,

2217
00:54:58,330 --> 00:54:58,850
yeah,

2218
00:54:58,850 --> 00:54:59,100
yeah.

2219
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:03,050
They started to look at this photo and
see if I could give you a little bit.

2220
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:05,100
It popped up to conspiracy.

2221
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:05,920
How do we get it back?

2222
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:07,230
It's that what's going on?

2223
00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:09,420
The connection to the TV's just died out.

2224
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,393
I have no idea.

2225
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,420
No Hollywood conspiracy.

2226
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:15,120
The button that I have is making it
go there and it's not going there,

2227
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:15,780
so I don't know.

2228
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,141
Jesus.

2229
00:55:16,141 --> 00:55:16,481
Jamie.

2230
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:19,380
This gremlins in this
fucking will figure it out.

2231
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,010
It's hard to.

2232
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:20,730
Allegedly.

2233
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:21,600
I would say this.

2234
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,730
We need to see that though.

2235
00:55:23,590 --> 00:55:24,140
My laptop.

2236
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:24,330
Yeah.

2237
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:24,660
Show.

2238
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,560
Show me a laptop.

2239
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:26,490
I would.

2240
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,450
I would be willing to.

2241
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:27,931
Okay.

2242
00:55:27,931 --> 00:55:28,764
There's the image.

2243
00:55:28,770 --> 00:55:29,940
Take a good look at it,

2244
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:30,390
tim.

2245
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:31,030
So okay.

2246
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,680
These guys,

2247
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,610
they see what's on their leg.

2248
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:33,210
Yes.

2249
00:55:33,210 --> 00:55:35,610
That's specifically a game
where when you look at it,

2250
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:36,444
they get to punch you,

2251
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,820
that they're not holding the hand sign up.

2252
00:55:38,850 --> 00:55:41,850
They're not flashing it like
you see conservatives do.

2253
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:42,480
Right.

2254
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,710
I'm not denying that is a game,

2255
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:47,910
but to say that that's what those
guys are doing is a bit of a stretch,

2256
00:55:47,911 --> 00:55:48,480
I believe.

2257
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:48,620
Well,

2258
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,453
what do you think they're doing?

2259
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,050
What does it have to say that if,

2260
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:57,080
if fortune did that to make to mix it
up at some point people would think that

2261
00:55:57,511 --> 00:55:58,344
that is true though.

2262
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,610
That's like no way that's happening.

2263
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:02,851
Look,

2264
00:56:02,851 --> 00:56:03,661
I'll say this is.

2265
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:04,030
It is.

2266
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:04,260
Well,

2267
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,970
there's be bleeding free.

2268
00:56:05,971 --> 00:56:07,310
Bleeding came from fortune,

2269
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:07,970
right?

2270
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:10,440
Have you don't know what French
people explain that to people.

2271
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,950
It's all you free bleeding was fortunate.

2272
00:56:13,951 --> 00:56:15,000
Thought it would be hilarious.

2273
00:56:15,001 --> 00:56:15,301
By the way,

2274
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:17,610
Shiela Bu was at the
comedy store last night.

2275
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:20,460
I wonder why because we're
always ragging on him.

2276
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:24,460
Free bleeding came from
four chan where they said

2277
00:56:24,490 --> 00:56:29,490
that they were promoting this idea that
for women's rights that they would,

2278
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,190
you know,

2279
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:31,023
get away,

2280
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:35,050
get away from this whole idea of you
have to control your menstrual cycle.

2281
00:56:35,170 --> 00:56:35,371
You know,

2282
00:56:35,371 --> 00:56:38,230
it's empowering to just
bleed all over your crotch.

2283
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,130
And so women actually started
doing it because it actually,

2284
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,320
if you can fucking,

2285
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,690
if you can get those ideas out there,

2286
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,900
a certain number of knuckleheads are
going to take it and run with it and think

2287
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:50,231
it's real.

2288
00:56:50,231 --> 00:56:51,740
Of course you don't think that's possible.

2289
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:52,660
The white power though,

2290
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:54,790
I think it's extremely unlikely.

2291
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:55,640
I think it's.

2292
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:56,440
It's possible.

2293
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:56,921
So here's the thing,

2294
00:56:56,921 --> 00:56:58,090
nothing's absolute right.

2295
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,430
Are there some some white supremacists
who are doing it for sure,

2296
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:01,091
but you don't.

2297
00:57:01,091 --> 00:57:03,850
You think you looking at
bad asses with fucking guns.

2298
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:08,050
They're playing this little
silly game to really.

2299
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,460
I think there are a bunch of bros.

2300
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:10,660
Who are you ever.

2301
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:11,171
You ever hang out With?

2302
00:57:11,171 --> 00:57:13,120
Like some frat dudes at a college,

2303
00:57:13,690 --> 00:57:14,590
they punch each other.

2304
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,760
That's there's a game.

2305
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:16,990
So how's it go again?

2306
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:17,440
you,

2307
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,520
you make the okay hand sign.

2308
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:18,881
Okay.

2309
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:21,090
And you hold it under a
table or on on your leg.

2310
00:57:21,091 --> 00:57:21,790
These are adults.

2311
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:23,380
These are guys that are not in college.

2312
00:57:23,381 --> 00:57:25,780
They're definitely not
a below 25 years old,

2313
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:26,643
but what does that mean?

2314
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,450
I know I know 40 year old guys
who play pokemon go is a game.

2315
00:57:31,451 --> 00:57:32,580
You fix this fucking thing.

2316
00:57:32,610 --> 00:57:33,443
Well

2317
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:34,751
okay,

2318
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,170
but what the gender,

2319
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:37,330
what is their job?

2320
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:37,751
What would they.

2321
00:57:37,751 --> 00:57:41,050
Their swat team guys is that they were
arresting a drug dealer and what do,

2322
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:41,801
what do you think they're doing?

2323
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:44,680
They're trying to make sure everybody
knows that they're flashing and overt

2324
00:57:44,681 --> 00:57:47,170
white power hand gesture because
everyone knows that's what it means.

2325
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,970
That somebody didn't think everyone knew.

2326
00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:49,691
Well,

2327
00:57:49,691 --> 00:57:49,811
no,

2328
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:50,261
that's just not.

2329
00:57:50,261 --> 00:57:51,011
It's just not the case.

2330
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:53,530
The thing that the point is holding the.

2331
00:57:53,531 --> 00:57:55,910
Okay sign up next to you is what's key.

2332
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:56,440
You know,

2333
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,950
people say it,

2334
00:57:56,950 --> 00:57:57,820
it's the w in the peat.

2335
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,210
Putting it on your leg has always
been the punch him game or whatever.

2336
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,980
Like I know that punch them,

2337
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,020
punch them game 100 percent,

2338
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,280
put it the okay symbol on your
leg or under a table and you say,

2339
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:09,791
hey look.

2340
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,630
And if they look on and see it,

2341
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:10,840
they go,

2342
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,111
ah,

2343
00:58:11,111 --> 00:58:11,944
and then you punched him in the arm.

2344
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,740
But I know it so well that I,

2345
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,600
that's why I don't think that's what
they're doing like me and my friends play

2346
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,130
it.

2347
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,420
So then the question is,

2348
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:19,680
yeah,

2349
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,980
so it's a major.

2350
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,150
It's made you look made,

2351
00:58:22,151 --> 00:58:22,670
you look right.

2352
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:22,960
So,

2353
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,370
but what are they doing right?

2354
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:24,670
Look,

2355
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:25,000
look,

2356
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:25,271
listen,

2357
00:58:25,271 --> 00:58:25,960
man.

2358
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,530
If you wanna,

2359
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:29,230
if you want to make assumptions about
what you think their intentions were,

2360
00:58:29,231 --> 00:58:29,471
that's all.

2361
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:33,190
You don't have any facts to support that
and the only thing I know of is there

2362
00:58:33,191 --> 00:58:35,740
that game where you put the okay sign
in your leg and then you punch somebody

2363
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,360
and here's some guys putting
the case on their leg.

2364
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:38,351
What evidence do we have?

2365
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,190
It's anything other than that,

2366
00:58:39,191 --> 00:58:39,620
nothing.

2367
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,453
So that that's.

2368
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:41,860
I'm not gonna go any Further than that.

2369
00:58:42,190 --> 00:58:42,731
I'm going to say,

2370
00:58:42,731 --> 00:58:43,570
was it poor judgment?

2371
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:43,691
Oh,

2372
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:44,524
hell yeah.

2373
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,070
Maybe.

2374
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:45,903
But listen,

2375
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:48,610
do you know about what happened in philly
with these marines who got beat up by

2376
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:49,444
antifa?

2377
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:49,840
No,

2378
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,500
I do not.

2379
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:50,980
So there's some.

2380
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:55,090
So there was a rally put on by
some constitutional libertarian.

2381
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:56,500
I don't know exactly
what it was all about.

2382
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,450
Antifa shows up in protests.

2383
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:02,860
Some marines apparently are just walking
by because there was a marine event.

2384
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:04,930
Antifa sees them and yells,

2385
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:05,793
are you proud?

2386
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:06,933
they said,

2387
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:07,391
he says,

2388
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,841
I'm a marine,

2389
00:59:07,841 --> 00:59:08,051
and said,

2390
00:59:08,051 --> 00:59:08,890
are you a proud boy?

2391
00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:10,053
And he said,

2392
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:10,421
you know,

2393
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:10,960
I don't know.

2394
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,770
They'd beat them up.

2395
00:59:11,770 --> 00:59:12,700
These they arrested,

2396
00:59:12,701 --> 00:59:14,470
several people charged
with multiple felonies.

2397
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:15,820
Marines got beat up.

2398
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,871
They didn't know it.

2399
00:59:16,871 --> 00:59:17,704
Proud boy was.

2400
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,760
So to assume that these guys know
anything about what's going on in,

2401
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:22,160
in

2402
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,150
cultural politics,

2403
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:23,900
it's,

2404
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:24,171
it's,

2405
00:59:24,171 --> 00:59:24,411
you know,

2406
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:27,740
when you're in the know and you're on
twitter when you're reading the news all

2407
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:27,920
day,

2408
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,730
you look at the insight,

2409
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:29,720
they knew what they were doing,

2410
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,870
what these are small like what city of
these guys from even do they watch the

2411
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:33,351
news all day?

2412
00:59:33,351 --> 00:59:34,430
Do they go on four chan,

2413
00:59:34,431 --> 00:59:37,490
do they go on vox.com and read
and know what this is about.

2414
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:37,911
Okay.

2415
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:41,660
I appreciaTe your looking at
this with a broad perspective,

2416
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,510
but it is entirely possible that they did.

2417
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:45,020
Sure.

2418
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,690
It's also entirely possible that within
their friend group it means you're

2419
00:59:47,691 --> 00:59:48,524
buying lunch.

2420
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:49,820
It could mean a million things.

2421
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:54,821
It could mean in the cultural
context of 2018 when this happened.

2422
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:56,470
Yep.

2423
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:56,800
That.

2424
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,390
Oh the okay symbol doesn't
even mean white power.

2425
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:00,180
It iS,

2426
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,711
it is.

2427
01:00:00,711 --> 01:00:04,080
It is a tribal sign among anti identify,

2428
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:06,980
anti intersectional and trump supporters.

2429
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,110
But don't you remember when was there?

2430
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,880
There was a woman that
got in trouble for it.

2431
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,010
She was in court and
she had it on her arm.

2432
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,930
She was just standing
there like so insane.

2433
01:00:14,931 --> 01:00:16,910
So insane because she was basically,

2434
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,570
she had her finger and
her thumb like that.

2435
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,750
And they and they and
they went wild with it.

2436
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:21,030
Yeah.

2437
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,170
She's making powers.

2438
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,670
You have to understand when I see
that and I see that you kicked me out,

2439
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:28,610
but there's a difference between someone
just moving their hands around and

2440
01:00:28,611 --> 01:00:29,790
doing this and you know,

2441
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,190
making a weird thing she did.

2442
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:32,930
She did fall onto it the next day though.

2443
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,073
Probably on purpose.

2444
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:35,510
Maybe.

2445
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:37,670
Maybe that's what she does
when she puts her on there.

2446
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:40,400
You have to assume
she's watching the news,

2447
01:00:40,401 --> 01:00:41,370
then I would.

2448
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:42,410
She's sitting in the cabinet hearing,

2449
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:45,710
but it's entirely possible that I'll be
an unlikely that she was just telling

2450
01:00:45,711 --> 01:00:46,040
somebody.

2451
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:46,873
Okay.

2452
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:48,710
Like she was.

2453
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:50,950
She's used to doing that with her arm.

2454
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,070
I think about it.

2455
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,273
There's,

2456
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:54,590
you're allowed to make assumptions.

2457
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:55,440
Right?

2458
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,510
And operate off assumptions.

2459
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:01,190
But eventuallY you start getting off so
crazy and you know how many assumptions

2460
01:01:01,191 --> 01:01:02,480
are going to believe until
you believe in the moon.

2461
01:01:02,481 --> 01:01:03,110
Landing was fake.

2462
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:04,130
Let me ask you this though.

2463
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:08,780
Don't you think that some people do that
and they do it because they're making

2464
01:01:08,781 --> 01:01:09,770
the symbol for white power?

2465
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:11,810
Some as in what?

2466
01:01:11,811 --> 01:01:12,081
10,

2467
01:01:12,081 --> 01:01:12,501
15,

2468
01:01:12,501 --> 01:01:13,334
20?

2469
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:13,940
I don't know.

2470
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,230
I think I don't know about.

2471
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:15,981
Like I said,

2472
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:16,251
listen,

2473
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:17,084
nothing's absolute.

2474
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:17,570
I'd be.

2475
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,240
I'm pretty sure they're probably
some white supremacists who do that.

2476
01:01:20,310 --> 01:01:20,780
Yeah,

2477
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:21,613
but here's the thing.

2478
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,600
Most of these people who are on four,

2479
01:01:23,601 --> 01:01:24,320
chan,

2480
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:27,140
who would even use the emoji
who would do it in public,

2481
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:29,300
they're not doing it
to signal white power.

2482
01:01:29,301 --> 01:01:34,160
They're doing it as signal opposition
to the tribal left when they take photos

2483
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:37,730
and you see someone like kasandra
fairbank's who is a trump supporting,

2484
01:01:37,731 --> 01:01:38,564
you know writer.

2485
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:39,240
She has.

2486
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:39,420
She,

2487
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:39,800
she is.

2488
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,020
She is notable because
she stood at the podium,

2489
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:46,190
made the okay hanson and then
this writer from splinter news,

2490
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,260
which used to be called fusion.

2491
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:48,621
I worked there,

2492
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,454
full disclosure,

2493
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,960
claimed it was a white power hand gesture
and she got a cassandra sued over it.

2494
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,880
She ultimately lOst because it's
like free slander is hard to sue for,

2495
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,590
but she did it because
it was a trump sign,

2496
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:01,670
not because it's white power.

2497
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:06,080
So the people who were even
white supremacists aren't
signifying white power.

2498
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,000
They're signAling to other
trump supporters too,

2499
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:08,511
right?

2500
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:09,680
It doesn't mean white power.

2501
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:10,401
Right?

2502
01:02:10,401 --> 01:02:13,610
So just because someone on the
left says it means white power.

2503
01:02:13,611 --> 01:02:15,890
That does not mean it means
why power within their group.

2504
01:02:15,891 --> 01:02:16,724
Is that what you're saying?

2505
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,693
Yeah,

2506
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:19,860
we all just decide that
this means something else.

2507
01:02:19,890 --> 01:02:20,280
Like

2508
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:21,810
my friend means peace among peers,

2509
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:22,610
among nations,

2510
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:23,430
peace among worlds.

2511
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:24,990
My friend steve rinella.

2512
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:29,550
We talked about this in the pockets that
he got beat up once by his friend where

2513
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:34,320
he grew up in Michigan and in
Michigan as almost like for fun.

2514
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:34,770
Like,

2515
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,521
like if I said,

2516
01:02:35,521 --> 01:02:36,330
hey fucker,

2517
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:37,260
like if I called you,

2518
01:02:37,261 --> 01:02:37,781
hey fucker,

2519
01:02:37,781 --> 01:02:40,110
like as friends you would laugh and like,

2520
01:02:40,111 --> 01:02:40,680
what's up dude?

2521
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:40,921
You know,

2522
01:02:40,921 --> 01:02:41,610
it'd be cool.

2523
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,880
So he would give the bird and
they would call it the Michigan.

2524
01:02:44,881 --> 01:02:45,470
Hello?

2525
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:45,750
Yup.

2526
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,640
And so the Michigan wave
or something like that.

2527
01:02:47,641 --> 01:02:48,800
So as he was driving by,

2528
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:49,381
saw his friend,

2529
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:50,214
he went like that,

2530
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:51,750
like if I saw you do that,

2531
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:52,081
I'd be like,

2532
01:02:52,081 --> 01:02:52,411
ah,

2533
01:02:52,411 --> 01:02:52,980
what's up tim?

2534
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:53,760
There was a,

2535
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:54,450
but you don't have to submit.

2536
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:55,980
His friend didn't know this.

2537
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:57,060
So his friend,

2538
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,860
he grabbed him through to the ground.

2539
01:02:58,861 --> 01:02:59,071
He goes,

2540
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,240
you want to fight motherfuckers like,

2541
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,290
what are you talking about?

2542
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,430
Like what's going on?

2543
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:02,941
He's like,

2544
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:03,631
you gave me the bird.

2545
01:03:03,631 --> 01:03:03,900
He's like,

2546
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:04,733
oh jesus,

2547
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,970
I'm from Michigan.

2548
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:06,840
Like That's,

2549
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:07,740
we're having fun.

2550
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:08,490
Like that's just,

2551
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:09,323
I'm your friend.

2552
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:13,830
and he was over the guy's house helping
them build a greenhouse or something.

2553
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:17,310
Like he was doing some work with the
guy and the guy's still threw him to the

2554
01:03:17,311 --> 01:03:19,170
ground because he thought that this was a.

2555
01:03:19,171 --> 01:03:20,004
You goT it fixed.

2556
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:20,760
No,

2557
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:21,591
there's naturally,

2558
01:03:21,591 --> 01:03:22,670
there's going to be a ton of people,

2559
01:03:22,700 --> 01:03:23,300
you know,

2560
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:23,691
saying,

2561
01:03:23,691 --> 01:03:23,901
oh,

2562
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:27,100
tombs boot licker and all that
stuff on premises through men.

2563
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,060
Like I'm not,

2564
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:29,440
I,

2565
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,081
I do not.

2566
01:03:30,081 --> 01:03:31,460
I'm not a big fan of conspiracy theories.

2567
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,460
I'm not a big fan of making assumptions
about the intentions of other people.

2568
01:03:34,461 --> 01:03:35,121
If you can prove it,

2569
01:03:35,121 --> 01:03:35,954
I'm willing to hear it,

2570
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:38,270
but people in this country are
innocent until proven guilty.

2571
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:38,841
What do we have?

2572
01:03:38,841 --> 01:03:40,310
We have a photo of some
cops doing something dumb.

2573
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,900
Do I think it was ill advised
it was wrong and should've done.

2574
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:44,270
of course absolution have done it.

2575
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,800
Do I think it means
they're west palm assists?

2576
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:46,663
No,

2577
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:47,790
the cops.

2578
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:48,623
I'm not going to look.

2579
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:49,340
I've,

2580
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:49,850
I,

2581
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:52,340
I am no fan of police.

2582
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:52,791
I,

2583
01:03:52,791 --> 01:03:53,001
you know,

2584
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:53,161
I,

2585
01:03:53,161 --> 01:03:54,140
I grew up as like a,

2586
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:55,310
a left far left.

2587
01:03:55,311 --> 01:03:56,270
EnTer skateboarder.

2588
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:57,680
A cop screw with me all the time.

2589
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,910
I've had cops kicked my door in.

2590
01:03:58,940 --> 01:03:59,773
Guns drawn.

2591
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,910
I was in chicago and cops pulled me over.

2592
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:02,870
Me and my buddies.

2593
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,610
This is all on video at gunpoint.

2594
01:04:04,611 --> 01:04:05,480
Screaming at us.

2595
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:07,370
It was the craziest
experience I've ever had.

2596
01:04:07,700 --> 01:04:08,533
I am no fan,

2597
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:10,490
but if you don't have evidence,

2598
01:04:10,670 --> 01:04:12,730
I'm not just going to say
this is a thing about how,

2599
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:13,940
how these biases function.

2600
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:15,980
You get people who will
see all these videos,

2601
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:18,230
a lot of these experiences and they
immediately assume the worst about these

2602
01:04:18,231 --> 01:04:18,760
guys.

2603
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:19,760
I don't know anything about these guys.

2604
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:21,110
I know they did something dumb,

2605
01:04:21,111 --> 01:04:21,944
but I don't know why.

2606
01:04:22,430 --> 01:04:25,610
So I can't really go beyond that other
than I believe their official statement

2607
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,480
was there playing the game,

2608
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:28,590
but I could be wrong but to,

2609
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:31,340
to make assumptions about their character
or what they believe simply because

2610
01:04:31,341 --> 01:04:32,720
they made an okay sign on their leg.

2611
01:04:32,721 --> 01:04:35,630
It's like you can't convict
somebody in a court.

2612
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:36,763
You know what I mean?

2613
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:37,651
And I'm,

2614
01:04:37,651 --> 01:04:41,690
I'm a big fan of the presumption of
innocence and blackstone's formulation and

2615
01:04:41,691 --> 01:04:42,950
how we side on the,

2616
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:43,130
uh,

2617
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:43,260
we,

2618
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:44,780
we err on the side of
protecting the innocent.

2619
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:50,040
I think you got a good point in also in
the fact that this is a extremely recent

2620
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:55,460
hand gesture that's being associated with
white supremacy and clearly came from

2621
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,910
and you have to assume these guys
are on four chan or read these,

2622
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:00,020
these websites like,

2623
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:00,471
c'mon man,

2624
01:05:00,471 --> 01:05:01,160
these dudes,

2625
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,150
they probably go to work all day.

2626
01:05:02,151 --> 01:05:02,990
They talk about football,

2627
01:05:02,991 --> 01:05:03,381
they go home,

2628
01:05:03,381 --> 01:05:06,470
they sit in their lounge chair and have
a beer and a slice of pizza or whatever

2629
01:05:06,471 --> 01:05:07,304
it is they do.

2630
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,720
I don't think these guys,

2631
01:05:08,990 --> 01:05:09,823
people,

2632
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:10,190
man,

2633
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:10,370
you know,

2634
01:05:10,370 --> 01:05:13,880
people don't know how to separate
their own personal bubble from reality.

2635
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:14,930
They assume,

2636
01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:16,370
if I know what you must know it,

2637
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,560
right?

2638
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:18,393
It's actually something

2639
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:19,840
shane smith told me.

2640
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:20,531
He said,

2641
01:05:20,531 --> 01:05:21,520
he doesn't understand.

2642
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:23,350
Why is it that if he can do it,

2643
01:05:23,351 --> 01:05:24,490
you can't write,

2644
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,620
and that's an interesting point
that people don't seem to realize.

2645
01:05:27,621 --> 01:05:28,450
Do you mean by that?

2646
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:28,891
LIke he's,

2647
01:05:28,891 --> 01:05:29,650
he's had to meet.

2648
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:30,281
I can speak french.

2649
01:05:30,281 --> 01:05:34,900
Why can't you like people live in this
mindset where they assume If I know it,

2650
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:37,010
everyone knows it rides so,

2651
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:37,691
so they're going to be like,

2652
01:05:37,691 --> 01:05:37,990
no,

2653
01:05:37,990 --> 01:05:38,411
every.

2654
01:05:38,411 --> 01:05:39,700
I saw an article about that.

2655
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:40,840
Everyone must know what it is.

2656
01:05:40,841 --> 01:05:41,060
It's like,

2657
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:41,181
no,

2658
01:05:41,181 --> 01:05:41,241
no,

2659
01:05:41,241 --> 01:05:41,411
no,

2660
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:41,860
dude.

2661
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:43,390
There are some people who don't watch tv.

2662
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:45,190
There's some people play
video games all day.

2663
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,710
There are some people who
don't do any of that for all,

2664
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:47,921
you know,

2665
01:05:47,921 --> 01:05:48,754
these guys,

2666
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:49,900
they everyday after work,

2667
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:53,320
they go to a children's shelter and
provide soup and they don't watch the news

2668
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:54,130
at all.

2669
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:54,311
Like,

2670
01:05:54,311 --> 01:05:54,521
I'm not,

2671
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:55,660
I don't believe that they actually do.

2672
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,460
I'm just saying you have no idea
what's going on in their lives.

2673
01:05:57,461 --> 01:05:59,590
you're making assumptions about
what they know who they are.

2674
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:00,993
And I think,

2675
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:02,021
you know,

2676
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:02,171
I,

2677
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:02,950
I,

2678
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,080
I'm a firm believer that we have
problems of racism in this country.

2679
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:07,480
I believe a institutional systemic racism,

2680
01:06:07,481 --> 01:06:07,750
real,

2681
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:08,890
real problems need to be solved.

2682
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:12,910
All that stuff that still doesn't mean
you get to just label someone and make

2683
01:06:12,911 --> 01:06:14,140
assumptions about what they believe,

2684
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:17,020
who they are because of one thing,

2685
01:06:17,290 --> 01:06:17,561
you know,

2686
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:17,731
if,

2687
01:06:17,731 --> 01:06:17,980
if,

2688
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,050
if you'd made a,

2689
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:19,811
if you made a joke,

2690
01:06:19,811 --> 01:06:20,050
what if,

2691
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,240
what if they did it because they
were ironically doing it right?

2692
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,650
If you made a job 10 years ago,

2693
01:06:23,651 --> 01:06:25,330
am I going assume you
actually believed that?

2694
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:26,620
Maybe said something silly.

2695
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:27,041
You know,

2696
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:28,800
we had this newscaster in New York who,

2697
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:31,420
who accidentally said martin luther,

2698
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:32,750
you know,

2699
01:06:32,750 --> 01:06:33,370
uh,

2700
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:33,790
and I,

2701
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:34,080
and I,

2702
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:35,050
and again,

2703
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:35,870
you know,

2704
01:06:35,870 --> 01:06:36,310
another one.

2705
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:36,401
Yeah,

2706
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:36,970
absolutely.

2707
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:37,570
And you also,

2708
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:37,770
uh,

2709
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:41,800
and another thing happened that no one
cared about was a guy on cnn said a

2710
01:06:41,860 --> 01:06:44,230
racial slur for jewish
people in the same way.

2711
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:45,910
No one cared about that one,

2712
01:06:46,390 --> 01:06:47,223
you know.

2713
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:48,430
So there was a cnn anchor.

2714
01:06:48,490 --> 01:06:49,323
What did he say?

2715
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,290
I don't want to say it.

2716
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:50,830
Okay.

2717
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:51,260
But he was,

2718
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:51,570
he was,

2719
01:06:51,570 --> 01:06:51,940
he was,

2720
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:52,830
he's k word,

2721
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:53,693
right?

2722
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,140
I think you can still say it
as long as I'm not calling me.

2723
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:56,921
It was the same thing.

2724
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:57,940
He quickly fit,

2725
01:06:57,941 --> 01:07:00,490
corrected himself and that
didn't come up as an issue.

2726
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,050
But the point is this,

2727
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:02,620
dude,

2728
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:03,250
you know,

2729
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:03,770
why?

2730
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:04,603
Why is he being fired?

2731
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:05,200
Right.

2732
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:06,460
Even people came to his defense,

2733
01:07:06,461 --> 01:07:08,290
are you going to assume
nasty things about them?

2734
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:08,801
Like,

2735
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:11,590
are we really getting to the point
where we're gonna look at a photo.

2736
01:07:11,710 --> 01:07:12,760
We don't know the context.

2737
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,800
We don't know who these people are wanting
to know their names and we're going

2738
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:16,030
to be a light burned at the stake.

2739
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:16,241
Well,

2740
01:07:16,241 --> 01:07:17,290
there's another issue too,

2741
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,730
and this is what we're doing it.

2742
01:07:18,910 --> 01:07:19,743
Oh jesus.

2743
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,040
That's so crazy.

2744
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:21,930
I didn't even.

2745
01:07:21,930 --> 01:07:22,870
I meant to do this,

2746
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:27,610
but there is another issue that people
do accidentally like because they're

2747
01:07:27,611 --> 01:07:28,840
worried about saying something.

2748
01:07:28,841 --> 01:07:29,660
They will say something.

2749
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:30,040
Right.

2750
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,760
I had a friend and he was a warmup,

2751
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,020
a guy for a television show.

2752
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:36,970
Do you know how a warmup works?

2753
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:39,190
Like there's a save a
sitcoms being filmed.

2754
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,380
There was a guy who will
keep the crowd laughing.

2755
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,641
Yeah.

2756
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:44,890
He walks around to keep the crown
and he had an anxiety attack.

2757
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:47,350
He had a panic attack in
the panic attack was this.

2758
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:51,850
He was doing the cosby show and he was,

2759
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,050
for whatever reason,

2760
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,340
it got into his head.

2761
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,900
Don't say the n Word,

2762
01:07:56,830 --> 01:07:57,700
don't say it,

2763
01:07:57,910 --> 01:07:58,661
don't say it.

2764
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:02,260
And he started sweating and he said
he started stammering and he literally

2765
01:08:02,261 --> 01:08:03,130
couldn't talk.

2766
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:08,370
He had some anxiety issues and and
he locked up and literally couldn't.

2767
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,130
Could barely say it.

2768
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:12,520
Did he?

2769
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:12,701
No,

2770
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:13,281
he didn't say it,

2771
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:14,920
but he was terrified that
he was going to say it's,

2772
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,280
but that could be what's going on with
someone saying martin luther coon,

2773
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:20,900
like especially the second guy,

2774
01:08:21,660 --> 01:08:23,390
obviously with context.

2775
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:27,650
Obviously the second guy heard the first
guy do it and it was a freudian slip.

2776
01:08:27,651 --> 01:08:28,484
It's in his mind.

2777
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:29,481
Don't say it.

2778
01:08:29,481 --> 01:08:30,231
Whatever you do,

2779
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,190
don't say that.

2780
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:32,030
I'll let you in on a funny,

2781
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:33,170
funny little secret though.

2782
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:34,520
Ice.

2783
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,290
I did it in one of my videos.

2784
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,900
You said that and then I started laughing.

2785
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:39,570
It was about,

2786
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:40,403
it was about it.

2787
01:08:40,490 --> 01:08:41,570
It was about the guy.

2788
01:08:41,750 --> 01:08:45,190
It was about the story and so you said
it and I said it laughed and I just

2789
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:46,520
decided that I had at my videos,

2790
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:46,641
you know,

2791
01:08:46,641 --> 01:08:47,150
I don't do it.

2792
01:08:47,150 --> 01:08:48,290
I don't do live shots,

2793
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,341
you know,

2794
01:08:49,341 --> 01:08:50,240
I do a lot sometimes,

2795
01:08:50,241 --> 01:08:51,074
but I was just like,

2796
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:51,470
I was,

2797
01:08:51,470 --> 01:08:52,191
I started laughing.

2798
01:08:52,191 --> 01:08:54,620
I just literally just started
laughing and I'm like,

2799
01:08:54,650 --> 01:08:58,280
I can't believe it because the
story was about him saying it.

2800
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:02,120
I purposefully don't say these words on
youtube because I don't want to get the

2801
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:03,110
banhammer sure.

2802
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:03,681
So I'm like,

2803
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:08,060
this guy accidentally said martin luther
and then he used a slur and then later

2804
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:08,661
when I was reading it,

2805
01:09:08,661 --> 01:09:09,650
I said it and I started laughing.

2806
01:09:09,651 --> 01:09:10,484
I'm just like,

2807
01:09:10,850 --> 01:09:11,210
but I,

2808
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:14,310
I understand what it's not
even about saying this.

2809
01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:17,090
Alerts about when you have two words in
your head and you accidentally put them

2810
01:09:17,091 --> 01:09:17,450
together.

2811
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:17,980
Yes.

2812
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,310
You know,

2813
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:18,771
that's what happened.

2814
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:19,430
The cnn guy.

2815
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:22,430
Well sometimes I call someone the wrong
name and don't realize I've done it

2816
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:22,820
right.

2817
01:09:22,820 --> 01:09:23,720
Like jamie said,

2818
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:24,620
you said jack.

2819
01:09:24,770 --> 01:09:25,191
Oh,

2820
01:09:25,191 --> 01:09:25,990
I thought I said john,

2821
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:27,750
like we've had that conversation before.

2822
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,770
I literally in my head think
I'm saying the right thing,

2823
01:09:30,771 --> 01:09:31,604
but I'm not.

2824
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:31,850
I,

2825
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:32,181
you know,

2826
01:09:32,181 --> 01:09:32,371
I,

2827
01:09:32,371 --> 01:09:33,350
I made a huge,

2828
01:09:33,351 --> 01:09:35,060
huge mistake on one of my videos.

2829
01:09:35,061 --> 01:09:38,510
I deleted the video because of it because
instead of saying harvey weinstein,

2830
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,021
I said,

2831
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:39,854
brett,

2832
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:40,760
oh no.

2833
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,410
And brett's awesome brett.

2834
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:43,071
Such a cool dude.

2835
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:43,904
I'm a big fan.

2836
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,240
And I published a video and someone
messaged me and they were like,

2837
01:09:47,241 --> 01:09:49,010
just want to let you know
you made this big mistake.

2838
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:51,530
And I had some pretty awful
things and I felt so bad.

2839
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,030
I think I've done similar.

2840
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:53,511
I was like,

2841
01:09:53,511 --> 01:09:54,231
oh my god,

2842
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:54,650
dude.

2843
01:09:54,650 --> 01:09:55,041
I was like,

2844
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,090
that guy is so cool.

2845
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:57,680
Like I'm a big fan of his work.

2846
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:58,933
I just was like,

2847
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:00,200
I tried editing it and I'm like,

2848
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:01,220
I'm bleeding it hands down.

2849
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:01,550
I would.

2850
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:04,190
I would rather just remove the video
outright than to say a disparaging word

2851
01:10:04,191 --> 01:10:05,024
against that man.

2852
01:10:05,390 --> 01:10:06,223
And I was an accident.

2853
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:07,311
I didn't even.

2854
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:08,240
I didn't even know I said it.

2855
01:10:08,660 --> 01:10:10,280
I think I did the exact same thing.

2856
01:10:10,281 --> 01:10:11,360
I did the exact same thing,

2857
01:10:11,361 --> 01:10:15,080
I believe on stage once because I
had a bit about harvey weinstein.

2858
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:16,460
I said,

2859
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:17,323
brett,

2860
01:10:17,810 --> 01:10:19,490
I think I said it onto fortunate.

2861
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,100
Yeah,

2862
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,500
because they're polar opposites.

2863
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:21,780
Yeah.

2864
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:22,613
Brett's fantastic.

2865
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:22,821
No,

2866
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:24,590
he's actually weinstein,

2867
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:24,950
right?

2868
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:25,790
So that Will help.

2869
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:26,330
Yeah.

2870
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:29,240
Say stein instead of 18 for heartbeat.

2871
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:30,070
No,

2872
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:30,560
for brett,

2873
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,930
for brent and eric weinstein.

2874
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,853
Weinstein,

2875
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,210
harvey weinstein,

2876
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:36,320
bret weinstein.

2877
01:10:36,350 --> 01:10:36,680
I couldn't.

2878
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,580
I didn't even know I did
it spelled the second I,

2879
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:39,610
I edited the video.

2880
01:10:39,650 --> 01:10:39,970
I edit,

2881
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:40,701
I edit.

2882
01:10:40,701 --> 01:10:41,534
I published it,

2883
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:43,610
and then I started getting messages
from people and I was like,

2884
01:10:43,790 --> 01:10:44,623
no.

2885
01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:45,740
And then I watched the that.

2886
01:10:45,960 --> 01:10:46,820
Oh my god,

2887
01:10:46,821 --> 01:10:47,654
dude,

2888
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,310
it's a problem.

2889
01:10:49,370 --> 01:10:49,830
You know,

2890
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:52,580
like when you're Thinking
and talking at the same time,

2891
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:55,370
there'S a bunch of words bouncing around
in your head and you're just trying to.

2892
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:59,410
And you think you're saying the
right thing when you know it's.

2893
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,520
That's why intent so critical.

2894
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:02,300
George carlin.

2895
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:02,601
Yeah.

2896
01:11:02,601 --> 01:11:05,090
And magic words are so fucking dangerous,

2897
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:05,511
you know,

2898
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,930
and that is what I'm going
to tell you about later on.

2899
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:08,900
Yeah.

2900
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:11,720
You know about a specific
comedian that we know and love.

2901
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:12,321
Well,

2902
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:14,130
george carlin was

2903
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:15,930
absolutely amazing.

2904
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:16,171
Well,

2905
01:11:16,171 --> 01:11:16,520
he was.

2906
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,210
He not only was he absolutely amazing,

2907
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:19,580
but people don't have to you.

2908
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:24,750
You almost have to have lived during the
time where he was getting arrested just

2909
01:11:25,090 --> 01:11:27,030
much like lenny bruce before him,

2910
01:11:27,031 --> 01:11:31,260
but to understand how significant he
was when he was doing that seven dirty

2911
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:31,501
words,

2912
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:32,640
you can't say on television,

2913
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:34,740
like back then people were like,

2914
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:36,870
what the fuck is this guy doing?

2915
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:40,980
It was groundbreaking when he did a,

2916
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,520
I think it was in [inaudible] 92.

2917
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:43,713
He did that bit.

2918
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:48,040
We probably did it a lot where he
basically ran off 50 racial slurs and then

2919
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:50,590
actually called eddie murphy
and richard pryor the n word.

2920
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:51,941
Remember that school?

2921
01:11:51,941 --> 01:11:52,870
Yes,

2922
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,370
and everyone laughed.

2923
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:54,940
Yeah.

2924
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:57,460
Everyone left because they
understood his intent.

2925
01:11:57,550 --> 01:11:59,530
They understood that he didn't
actually disrespect them.

2926
01:11:59,531 --> 01:12:00,101
They understood that.

2927
01:12:00,101 --> 01:12:01,360
He didn't mean anything bad about it.

2928
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:06,070
He was making a point about the the
racist asshole behind the words,

2929
01:12:06,490 --> 01:12:07,420
and it's funny to me.

2930
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,231
This is the thing,

2931
01:12:08,231 --> 01:12:08,710
man.

2932
01:12:08,710 --> 01:12:09,543
I,

2933
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:10,630
when I was younger I was.

2934
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:12,370
I was far left men skin tight,

2935
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:13,700
black shirts,

2936
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,620
the virus,

2937
01:12:15,010 --> 01:12:16,690
a virus,

2938
01:12:16,810 --> 01:12:17,800
the punk rock bands,

2939
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:18,091
aunties,

2940
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:18,460
lab,

2941
01:12:18,460 --> 01:12:19,293
things like that.

2942
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:20,470
I was trying to think of.

2943
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,071
It's been so long.

2944
01:12:21,071 --> 01:12:24,850
I'll try to think of some of the band
shirts we used to have and a man we were.

2945
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:27,160
We were angry and pissed off all the time.

2946
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:30,400
I grew up like that and
then over time I learned I.

2947
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:32,320
I went through a ton of
really important life lessons.

2948
01:12:32,530 --> 01:12:36,010
One of the first and most important was
I was a young skateboarder in chicago.

2949
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,280
Really looked up to some of these,

2950
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,470
these older guys who were really good.

2951
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:40,720
I went to catholic school
when I was younger.

2952
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:45,250
I ended up becoming this punk rocker
guitar playing far left skin tight,

2953
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:45,611
you know,

2954
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:46,420
skateboarding,

2955
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,253
angry,

2956
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,490
no flags,

2957
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:48,790
you know,

2958
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:49,623
fuck the government,

2959
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:51,870
and then I go to this dude's house
was just really great skateboards,

2960
01:12:51,890 --> 01:12:55,090
got a picture of jesus on the
wall and I immediately scoff like,

2961
01:12:55,091 --> 01:12:55,340
um,

2962
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:55,640
um,

2963
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:55,870
you know,

2964
01:12:55,870 --> 01:12:56,291
high and mighty.

2965
01:12:56,291 --> 01:12:57,000
I was like,

2966
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,311
it's like,

2967
01:12:57,311 --> 01:12:57,550
what do you,

2968
01:12:57,550 --> 01:12:58,720
what do you like a christian or something?

2969
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,140
And he goes,

2970
01:12:59,140 --> 01:12:59,740
no,

2971
01:12:59,740 --> 01:13:00,573
and I was like,

2972
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:00,890
why?

2973
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:01,930
You have a picTure of jesus?

2974
01:13:01,990 --> 01:13:02,823
And he goes,

2975
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:03,221
oh,

2976
01:13:03,221 --> 01:13:05,670
I just thought like a story about a dude
travel around helping people was kind

2977
01:13:05,671 --> 01:13:06,504
of cool.

2978
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:07,383
And I went,

2979
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:08,441
oh,

2980
01:13:08,441 --> 01:13:09,274
that's a good point.

2981
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:10,210
Wow.

2982
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:10,630
I was.

2983
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:11,463
I was like,

2984
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:12,191
I was like,

2985
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,371
wow,

2986
01:13:12,371 --> 01:13:13,690
maybe I don't really understand.

2987
01:13:13,750 --> 01:13:16,600
Maybe maybe this means something
different to other people.

2988
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:17,530
That means to me,

2989
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:17,931
well,

2990
01:13:17,931 --> 01:13:22,540
if jesus was an indian man that
had wooden beads and you know,

2991
01:13:22,541 --> 01:13:24,740
in he was a hindu god,

2992
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:26,210
we would love him.

2993
01:13:26,420 --> 01:13:26,770
You know,

2994
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:28,310
it'd be like shiva or vishnu.

2995
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:28,701
We would,

2996
01:13:28,701 --> 01:13:30,440
we would think he's the
most amazing thing ever.

2997
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:35,060
It's the fact that if you look at what
jesus preached and what he was all about,

2998
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:35,810
I mean,

2999
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:36,471
seems pretty rad.

3000
01:13:36,471 --> 01:13:41,240
I think it's about as
spiritual and loving and it's,

3001
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:41,931
it's about,

3002
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:42,740
I mean it,

3003
01:13:42,740 --> 01:13:43,130
his,

3004
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:48,130
his whole ideology that the jesus of
the bible and he was essentially about

3005
01:13:48,710 --> 01:13:52,370
loving your brother and treating
people as if they're you and,

3006
01:13:52,810 --> 01:13:53,190
but this,

3007
01:13:53,190 --> 01:13:53,771
this for me,

3008
01:13:53,771 --> 01:13:57,040
like I bring this up because it was kind
of a formative moment where all of a

3009
01:13:57,041 --> 01:14:02,041
sudden I realized was my
ideology predicated on
assumptions was I was I holding

3010
01:14:02,831 --> 01:14:04,930
these views because other
people told me to hold them,

3011
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:08,170
that actually understand that there were
some positive things on the other side.

3012
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:11,560
And then I slowly moved over to
more of a center left position.

3013
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:13,450
And you know,

3014
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,430
now what the reason I bring this up.

3015
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:16,930
as I looked,

3016
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:17,741
I watched that video.

3017
01:14:17,741 --> 01:14:18,371
I tweeted this,

3018
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:19,660
the video of george
carlin [inaudible] man.

3019
01:14:19,661 --> 01:14:20,291
George carlin was,

3020
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:20,710
uh,

3021
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:21,990
I used to watch this video was my,

3022
01:14:22,010 --> 01:14:22,240
my,

3023
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:25,030
my mom would put them on and
my mom's been a hippie liberal,

3024
01:14:25,031 --> 01:14:25,571
far left,

3025
01:14:25,571 --> 01:14:28,420
all that stuff and you'd probably
consider a conservative by today's,

3026
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:29,130
you know,

3027
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:30,340
measures the way things have been going.

3028
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:31,990
Now they look at,

3029
01:14:32,010 --> 01:14:32,230
you know,

3030
01:14:32,230 --> 01:14:33,063
Kevin Hart,

3031
01:14:33,190 --> 01:14:34,570
he's had a bad joke 10 years ago.

3032
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,013
Get 'em out.

3033
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:36,490
Like,

3034
01:14:36,490 --> 01:14:37,323
could you imagine?

3035
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:37,631
I,

3036
01:14:37,631 --> 01:14:37,780
I,

3037
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,090
god forbid what would happen with
george carlin's routines today?

3038
01:14:40,091 --> 01:14:40,440
They wouldn't,

3039
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:40,571
they,

3040
01:14:40,571 --> 01:14:42,580
they would be running all
of his old routine saying,

3041
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:42,911
no,

3042
01:14:42,911 --> 01:14:44,250
you have to ban him from the show.

3043
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:46,240
he literally called
these people the n word.

3044
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:49,810
Why was it that george carlin can go
on stage and talk about how republicans

3045
01:14:49,811 --> 01:14:50,290
were dominant,

3046
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,730
how religion is crazy.

3047
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:56,110
He was clearly on the left his whole
life and he said these things that by

3048
01:14:56,111 --> 01:14:58,330
today's standards would be
considered conservative.

3049
01:14:59,080 --> 01:14:59,381
Right.

3050
01:14:59,381 --> 01:15:03,510
And so for me it's a weird thing to
go from being on the far left as a,

3051
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:04,231
as a young person.

3052
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:05,350
It was around like 19 or 20.

3053
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:09,370
I started to become more moderate and
then to see them today being extremely

3054
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:11,740
offended like people used to
be in the fifties and sixties,

3055
01:15:12,060 --> 01:15:13,300
like that's regressive,

3056
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:16,570
that's trying to bring things back to
the way they used to be with offensive,

3057
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:20,350
nothing on puritanism and all
these things and now I feel like,

3058
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,770
I guess the cliche is the modern,

3059
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:24,670
the modern left,

3060
01:15:24,671 --> 01:15:25,321
whatever people call it,

3061
01:15:25,321 --> 01:15:30,321
like the capital l tribal left seems to
be being indoctrinated not by leftwing

3062
01:15:30,730 --> 01:15:31,630
policy ideas.

3063
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:33,550
It's not about necessarily socialism,

3064
01:15:33,551 --> 01:15:34,900
it's about identitarianism.

3065
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:39,480
It's about policy based on your immutable
characteristics and how you know,

3066
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:41,050
like going back to the green new deal,

3067
01:15:41,590 --> 01:15:44,010
like in the bill it talks
about racial equity.

3068
01:15:44,170 --> 01:15:45,250
What does that do to the environment,

3069
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:46,103
but what does that mean?

3070
01:15:47,850 --> 01:15:48,070
Well,

3071
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:49,970
equality would be like you,

3072
01:15:50,060 --> 01:15:51,430
you equal opportunity to.

3073
01:15:51,431 --> 01:15:53,380
People are allowed to
try and if one succeeds,

3074
01:15:53,381 --> 01:15:54,190
congratulations,

3075
01:15:54,190 --> 01:15:55,570
equity would be well,

3076
01:15:55,571 --> 01:16:00,160
let's determine whether or not you are
advantaged or privileged and then hold

3077
01:16:00,161 --> 01:16:01,900
you back or push you
forward based on these,

3078
01:16:01,930 --> 01:16:04,030
these certain metrics.

3079
01:16:04,031 --> 01:16:05,310
I suppose it's,

3080
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:08,260
it's the problem I have with it
is that it's not quantifiable.

3081
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:10,840
so this was actually something
that was really shocking to me.

3082
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:12,580
I was siTting with my niece,

3083
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:13,420
uh,

3084
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:13,750
and my,

3085
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:14,321
my sister,

3086
01:16:14,321 --> 01:16:17,650
my niece and my mom and I showed
this image that people like to share.

3087
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,380
It's three people
standing up by a baseball,

3088
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:21,353
a fence,

3089
01:16:21,430 --> 01:16:22,090
and there's a,

3090
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,970
there's a baseball game as a
really short person who can't see.

3091
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:28,510
There is a medium sized person who can
see a little bit and a very tall person

3092
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:29,950
who just stands right up above the fence.

3093
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,750
It says this is equality.

3094
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:33,040
Each of them gets one crate,

3095
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:36,760
one crate isn't enough for the short guy
and the two guys can already see that

3096
01:16:36,761 --> 01:16:38,470
says this is equity.

3097
01:16:38,650 --> 01:16:39,910
And it shows the short guy getting,

3098
01:16:39,911 --> 01:16:40,360
you know,

3099
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:41,980
three crates so they can all see now.

3100
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:42,791
And I said,

3101
01:16:42,791 --> 01:16:45,220
the problem is when it
comes to someone's height,

3102
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,570
sure we can understand,

3103
01:16:46,571 --> 01:16:46,930
let's,

3104
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:47,220
let's,

3105
01:16:47,220 --> 01:16:50,050
let's give the crates to the short
guy so he can see along with us.

3106
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:54,290
But how do you determine equity based
on the color of someone's skin or their,

3107
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:54,650
you know,

3108
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,950
like characteristics that can't
necessarily be quantified.

3109
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:58,240
Right?

3110
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:01,720
So when alexandria ocozzio cortez pushes
a bill ford that's purporting to be

3111
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:02,471
about the environment,

3112
01:17:02,471 --> 01:17:04,510
but includes racial equity clauses,

3113
01:17:04,990 --> 01:17:09,620
are we to assume that her ideology states
that if you are not white are poor by

3114
01:17:09,740 --> 01:17:14,060
like it's a guarantee or do we have to
assume that each individual has different

3115
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:15,141
advantages,

3116
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:17,000
different cards to play
and some are born wealthy,

3117
01:17:17,001 --> 01:17:17,720
some aren't.

3118
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:18,171
And yes,

3119
01:17:18,171 --> 01:17:19,040
there's historic racism,

3120
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:20,270
but We can't make those assumptions.

3121
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:20,630
Right?

3122
01:17:20,630 --> 01:17:21,410
Right.

3123
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,040
So this is,

3124
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:22,311
this is,

3125
01:17:22,311 --> 01:17:25,550
to me one of the biggest problems
I've been having as like a lifelong

3126
01:17:25,580 --> 01:17:27,920
left-leaning individuals
who do I vote for it?

3127
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:28,671
Right?

3128
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:30,290
I was a big fan of bernie
sanders for awhile,

3129
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,990
but then bernie sanders gets up
on stage at the debates and says,

3130
01:17:33,230 --> 01:17:35,000
white people don't know
what it's like to be poor.

3131
01:17:35,300 --> 01:17:36,133
Well,

3132
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:37,273
that's hilarious.

3133
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:40,100
That is to go to fucking West
Virginia and visit the coal miners.

3134
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:40,610
Right?

3135
01:17:40,610 --> 01:17:42,290
And you know what's really weird?

3136
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,170
I saw one of bernie's
tweets that I looked at it.

3137
01:17:45,171 --> 01:17:45,500
I said,

3138
01:17:45,500 --> 01:17:45,681
oh,

3139
01:17:45,681 --> 01:17:46,371
come on man,

3140
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:46,881
you know,

3141
01:17:46,881 --> 01:17:47,720
this is fucked up.

3142
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:53,020
He was talking about how much more
money white men make than black women.

3143
01:17:53,661 --> 01:17:57,200
And latino men and all these different
things and what he didn't include was

3144
01:17:57,201 --> 01:18:00,320
asian men or asian men make more money.

3145
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:02,570
But here's what I think a lot
of people on the right miss.

3146
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:03,590
He said,

3147
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:04,423
pay equity,

3148
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:05,720
not pay equality.

3149
01:18:06,230 --> 01:18:06,650
Okay.

3150
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:09,770
I think perhaps we should stop assuming
they don't know what they're saying

3151
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:12,260
because a lot of people
assume what they're saying is,

3152
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:12,921
you know,

3153
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:13,730
the gender,

3154
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:15,870
the gender earnings gap is,

3155
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,030
is real,

3156
01:18:17,030 --> 01:18:18,200
but the gender pay gap,

3157
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:23,970
it's not that if a man and a woman
are both offered the exact same job,

3158
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:26,210
exact same experience and education,

3159
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:27,230
women tend to get.

3160
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:30,500
I think it's like three to five percent
less and many people believe that's

3161
01:18:30,501 --> 01:18:32,210
because they are less likely to negotiate.

3162
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,740
WhIch is why you have like lean in tulum,

3163
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:35,241
it'd be more,

3164
01:18:35,241 --> 01:18:35,600
you know,

3165
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:36,770
trying to be more assertive,

3166
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,430
but it's not this 77
percent number that's.

3167
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:41,840
But there is an earnings gap,

3168
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:42,800
right?

3169
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,020
The median salaries of men
and women are different.

3170
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:49,670
So when bernie says white men make x
more than these other demographics,

3171
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:50,990
he said in his tweet,

3172
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,130
pay equity,

3173
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:53,023
not equality.

3174
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:55,760
He doesn't want fair pay
for everyone based on job.

3175
01:18:55,970 --> 01:18:58,430
He's actually saying it doesn't
matter what job you have.

3176
01:18:58,490 --> 01:18:59,990
Everyone should be paid the same.

3177
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:00,740
No,

3178
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,610
that's nonsense.

3179
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,860
But then you see what cortez
releases on our website.

3180
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,150
If you're unwilling To work,

3181
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:06,370
they'll provide economic security.

3182
01:19:06,371 --> 01:19:06,900
They actually,

3183
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:07,220
my,

3184
01:19:07,220 --> 01:19:08,840
I believe they took it off the site,

3185
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:10,130
right.

3186
01:19:10,130 --> 01:19:13,550
But I think when they include it
in the bill that they want equity,

3187
01:19:13,551 --> 01:19:15,410
not equality when they
include on their website.

3188
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:15,981
If you're unwilling,

3189
01:19:15,981 --> 01:19:16,580
they'll pay you.

3190
01:19:16,580 --> 01:19:17,810
And when bernie says equity as well,

3191
01:19:17,811 --> 01:19:20,870
I think they're not talking about
equality like I don't think you know,

3192
01:19:20,871 --> 01:19:23,840
the average american understands what
they're actually saying is you should be

3193
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:25,220
paid a flat rate period.

3194
01:19:25,670 --> 01:19:28,490
And when you're talking about the pay
gap being different from men and women,

3195
01:19:28,491 --> 01:19:29,330
we should clarify that.

3196
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:33,140
What you're saying essentially is that
men choose different jobs and they work

3197
01:19:33,141 --> 01:19:36,260
more hours and that's the reason
why they make that much more money.

3198
01:19:36,261 --> 01:19:37,730
Where at seventy seven
cents On the dollar.

3199
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:37,940
Yeah.

3200
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:38,121
There,

3201
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:38,771
there was uh,

3202
01:19:38,771 --> 01:19:38,980
an,

3203
01:19:38,980 --> 01:19:39,200
an,

3204
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:43,610
another study came out recently that
said that ours worked was almost the,

3205
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:47,300
a 100 percent of the reason why
men and women earn different,

3206
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:47,810
uh,

3207
01:19:47,810 --> 01:19:52,280
at a median median salary in some areas
a women actually earn more than men.

3208
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:52,660
Uh,

3209
01:19:52,660 --> 01:19:53,271
and there's,

3210
01:19:53,271 --> 01:19:54,380
I think seven cities.

3211
01:19:54,890 --> 01:19:55,820
I think this was on pew.

3212
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:56,170
Again,

3213
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:59,120
you fact check me if you got everybody
thinks I'm wrong or whatever,

3214
01:19:59,150 --> 01:19:59,541
but uh,

3215
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:03,110
I believe it was seven cities were women
out men by like seriously high numbers,

3216
01:20:03,111 --> 01:20:04,160
like up to 20 percent.

3217
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:08,940
So there's a lot of issues when it
comes to the pay gap and equality.

3218
01:20:09,060 --> 01:20:11,610
But without going on a
tangent on that area,

3219
01:20:11,611 --> 01:20:13,020
I think what ends up happening is,

3220
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:13,351
you know,

3221
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:16,710
I saw bernie's tweet and I
responded to it by saying good news,

3222
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:19,590
bernie pay equality is enshrined in law.

3223
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:20,873
And I said,

3224
01:20:21,090 --> 01:20:24,840
I cited three examples of where it's
illegal to discriminate based on gender.

3225
01:20:25,290 --> 01:20:26,390
And then someone points out to me,

3226
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:26,550
tim,

3227
01:20:26,550 --> 01:20:28,500
he didn't say quality is said equity.

3228
01:20:28,890 --> 01:20:29,500
That would imply,

3229
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:32,580
doesn't matter what job you have in a
petroleum engineer should earn the same as

3230
01:20:32,581 --> 01:20:33,630
a store clerk at h and m.

3231
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,260
That's equity that just
because you have an advantage,

3232
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,750
because if education doesn't mean you
should earn more than somebody else.

3233
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:40,793
You see what I'm saying?

3234
01:20:40,890 --> 01:20:41,723
So

3235
01:20:42,250 --> 01:20:44,280
the fact that there's people
that actually believed that,

3236
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,920
that don't believe that
we're the first of all,

3237
01:20:47,921 --> 01:20:50,920
that's going to absolutely discourage
people from trying to succeed.

3238
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,060
Why would you,

3239
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:55,720
if you could get the same amount
as the ceo of exxon as you can,

3240
01:20:55,721 --> 01:20:57,880
working at 21 forever,

3241
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:59,140
forever 21 or whatever,

3242
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:00,940
abercrombie and fitch.

3243
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,990
WhY would you,

3244
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:03,280
why would you try hard?

3245
01:21:03,281 --> 01:21:04,114
Why would you?

3246
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,320
Why would you succeed?

3247
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:06,670
Why would you excel?

3248
01:21:06,850 --> 01:21:09,820
I think it's fair to point
out some people would love it.

3249
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:10,993
What if there's no.

3250
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:12,610
If there's no real,

3251
01:21:12,670 --> 01:21:14,320
I mean other than social status,

3252
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:16,240
if there's no real positive,

3253
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:20,640
I think social status might be one
of the prime driving factors of,

3254
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:21,870
of most people at whole.

3255
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:22,521
No man,

3256
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:23,271
not enough.

3257
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:26,390
Not enough to really encourage
innovation and progress.

3258
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:26,841
I,

3259
01:21:26,841 --> 01:21:28,250
I can agree with that for sure,

3260
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:30,050
but I also think there's a,

3261
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:34,040
there's a saying that I was told a lot
that people don't get rich because they

3262
01:21:34,041 --> 01:21:34,461
want money,

3263
01:21:34,461 --> 01:21:36,620
they get rich because they're passionate
about something and the money comes

3264
01:21:36,621 --> 01:21:36,981
after,

3265
01:21:36,981 --> 01:21:37,161
you know,

3266
01:21:37,161 --> 01:21:40,340
they always say that the money comes
after something like that and I point out

3267
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:41,210
every,

3268
01:21:41,210 --> 01:21:42,950
every day I take no days off.

3269
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:45,560
It's been a couple years with
me not taking any days off.

3270
01:21:45,561 --> 01:21:47,210
I work literally every day full time.

3271
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,700
Right now I'm Producing six
youtube videos every day.

3272
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:51,710
Only one of them is a
real seven days a week,

3273
01:21:51,740 --> 01:21:52,311
seven days a week,

3274
01:21:52,311 --> 01:21:53,390
nonstop for two years straight.

3275
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:54,770
Fuck you do on yourself.

3276
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,190
I like it.

3277
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:56,540
It's fun and that's the thing.

3278
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:57,080
I'm not,

3279
01:21:57,080 --> 01:21:57,621
I'm not doing it.

3280
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:59,390
you're enjoying this lady down the tunnel.

3281
01:21:59,391 --> 01:22:00,890
I do it because you know,

3282
01:22:00,891 --> 01:22:01,970
I see things on a.

3283
01:22:02,030 --> 01:22:04,490
So for the most part on
my main youtube channel,

3284
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:06,680
I do one video every day at 4:00 PM,

3285
01:22:06,681 --> 01:22:09,170
which tends to be just
like a news analysis piece,

3286
01:22:09,410 --> 01:22:10,370
but I'm not perfect.

3287
01:22:10,371 --> 01:22:12,410
Sometimes I get all hyperbolic and stuff.

3288
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:15,000
My second channel is me
just ranting and you know,

3289
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:18,140
not really swearing but still
just like heavy opinion stuff.

3290
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:19,483
I do it because it's fun,

3291
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:20,120
you know,

3292
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:20,631
I see something.

3293
01:22:20,631 --> 01:22:21,464
I want to explore it.

3294
01:22:21,850 --> 01:22:22,120
A,

3295
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:24,110
I used to travel all the
time when I worked at vice,

3296
01:22:24,111 --> 01:22:26,540
I was in all these different countries
and all these dangerous places,

3297
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:29,090
not because I wanted to
have a name for myself,

3298
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:30,140
not because I wanted to make money,

3299
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:32,030
I wanted to watch her evolution,

3300
01:22:32,270 --> 01:22:34,640
I want to know why it was happening and
I want to talk to the people who were

3301
01:22:34,641 --> 01:22:36,260
experiencing it so I can,

3302
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:36,650
I can,

3303
01:22:36,650 --> 01:22:40,160
I can relate to people who say
money isn't a motivator for sure,

3304
01:22:40,670 --> 01:22:44,870
but I've also talked to
people in scandinavia who
have told me they sort of give

3305
01:22:44,871 --> 01:22:48,020
up at a certain point because I
can't remember which country it was.

3306
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:51,410
It may have been Sweden or Norway,

3307
01:22:51,830 --> 01:22:55,280
but these two women toLd me that
after like $77,000 per year,

3308
01:22:55,281 --> 01:22:56,540
they tax lIke 80 percent of your income.

3309
01:22:56,541 --> 01:22:57,374
So people just stopped.

3310
01:22:57,710 --> 01:22:58,590
They literally just stopped that.

3311
01:22:58,591 --> 01:22:58,690
That's

3312
01:22:58,690 --> 01:22:59,740
another proposition,

3313
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:00,010
right.

3314
01:23:00,010 --> 01:23:03,520
This is something else that's
been discussed in terms
of anyone who makes more

3315
01:23:03,521 --> 01:23:06,040
than x amount per year taxing over 70

3316
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:06,750
percent.

3317
01:23:06,750 --> 01:23:09,670
So I agree with the
progressive tax wholeheartedly.

3318
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:11,230
I disagree with that number of that high.

3319
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:13,060
What do you think it should be?

3320
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:14,200
I don't.

3321
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:14,890
I don't know,

3322
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:18,640
but I will say we need
more progressive brackets.

3323
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:20,320
We need to keep going and you know,

3324
01:23:20,321 --> 01:23:22,510
I got to say maybe maybe at $10,000,000,

3325
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:23,860
70 percent does make sense,

3326
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:27,220
but I kind of leaned towards not
really because it seems like man,

3327
01:23:27,221 --> 01:23:27,851
that's a lot of money.

3328
01:23:27,851 --> 01:23:28,331
That's a lot.

3329
01:23:28,331 --> 01:23:28,510
That's,

3330
01:23:28,510 --> 01:23:28,770
that's,

3331
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:29,290
that's,

3332
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:29,560
that's,

3333
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,460
that's ridiculous amount.

3334
01:23:30,670 --> 01:23:30,960
You know,

3335
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,900
I think steve bannon said something
like a five in front of it or something,

3336
01:23:35,470 --> 01:23:35,891
but I don't know.

3337
01:23:35,891 --> 01:23:36,850
I'm not an economist,

3338
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,370
but I do believe a progressive
tax makes the most sense.

3339
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:41,350
And I can explain it to
you if you want to hear it.

3340
01:23:41,380 --> 01:23:42,213
Sure.

3341
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:43,140
So there was a study,

3342
01:23:43,141 --> 01:23:43,360
I,

3343
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:43,600
I,

3344
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:44,770
I believe it was from harvard,

3345
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:47,260
you need $77,000 per year.

3346
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:51,280
It may have been 10 years ago in order
to be middleclass median in the United

3347
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:51,880
States.

3348
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,300
That means if you make 77,000
and you'll have a vacation,

3349
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:56,051
you'll have insurance,

3350
01:23:56,051 --> 01:23:56,531
you'll have a car,

3351
01:23:56,531 --> 01:23:57,281
you can raise a family,

3352
01:23:57,281 --> 01:23:58,061
you can send them to school,

3353
01:23:58,061 --> 01:23:58,750
all that stuff,

3354
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,720
but you have nothing
left over for savings.

3355
01:24:00,740 --> 01:24:02,020
You have nothing left
over for investments.

3356
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:03,880
If you make $100,000 a year,

3357
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:06,280
you're gonna have $23,000
leftover for investing.

3358
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,020
Eventually at a certain point,

3359
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,630
if you only need $77,000,

3360
01:24:10,660 --> 01:24:11,830
if you're making 10 million,

3361
01:24:12,010 --> 01:24:13,540
you've got 9 million,

3362
01:24:13,541 --> 01:24:17,890
900 and 900,000 that you can invest and
just be independently wealthy and be

3363
01:24:17,891 --> 01:24:18,724
rich forever.

3364
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:19,361
Now,

3365
01:24:19,361 --> 01:24:20,470
I have no problem with being wealthy.

3366
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:21,040
I have no.

3367
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,590
I have no problem with other people
being wealthy and living off of their

3368
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:24,424
investments and all that,

3369
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:26,430
but there is a point where
you have to realize the,

3370
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:26,830
the,

3371
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:27,120
the,

3372
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:28,630
the coalescing of power,

3373
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:32,260
the monopolizing of power is a really
dangerous thing for any society to few

3374
01:24:32,261 --> 01:24:35,010
individuals holding too much
power can destabilize an economy,

3375
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:36,130
can destabilize the country.

3376
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,750
The problem with communism,

3377
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:41,350
you snap your fingers and you put
a centralized authority in place.

3378
01:24:41,530 --> 01:24:42,940
At least that's how it's
been every single time,

3379
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,280
and then they hold all the
cards and they can oppress over.

3380
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:47,290
They want the problem with laissez faire.

3381
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,790
Capitalism has over time,

3382
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:51,070
which is why it's better in a lot of ways.

3383
01:24:51,071 --> 01:24:51,581
Over time.

3384
01:24:51,581 --> 01:24:55,420
It eventually becomes a
centralized oligopoly of a
few corporations controlling

3385
01:24:55,421 --> 01:24:55,781
everything,

3386
01:24:55,781 --> 01:24:56,680
which we're kind of seeing now.

3387
01:24:57,250 --> 01:25:01,030
So all the progressive tax can
really do is slow that process down,

3388
01:25:01,300 --> 01:25:02,170
which I think is a good thing.

3389
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:05,710
But ultimately I think
just looking at the system,

3390
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:07,600
eventually you end up
kind of where we are,

3391
01:25:07,601 --> 01:25:10,910
where six media companies control
everything and then you know,

3392
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,650
some companies are the biggest funders
of certain politicians and corporations.

3393
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:15,760
It's have too much power.

3394
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:16,481
I mean,

3395
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:16,561
there,

3396
01:25:16,561 --> 01:25:17,090
there is,

3397
01:25:17,090 --> 01:25:17,923
uh,

3398
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:18,490
I,

3399
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:23,490
I remember reading a report or a story
about how wealthy people have like three

3400
01:25:24,341 --> 01:25:28,150
or four times more ability to influence
a politician than like the majority of

3401
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:31,000
the people in the country simply
because paying for expensive dinners and

3402
01:25:31,001 --> 01:25:32,620
lobbying earns you favors,

3403
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:33,780
you know,

3404
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,910
super pacs paying,

3405
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:35,470
you know,

3406
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:36,650
guaranteeing funding for,

3407
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,260
for a politician or as your favorites.

3408
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:39,483
So it's,

3409
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:40,121
you know,

3410
01:25:40,121 --> 01:25:40,410
look,

3411
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:42,760
if a million people
telling me they want x,

3412
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:46,720
but the people who are paying me like pa
funding my campaign are paying me more,

3413
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:47,351
well,

3414
01:25:47,351 --> 01:25:48,580
who am I going to provide favors too?

3415
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:50,320
And then once I'm done
with my campaign run,

3416
01:25:50,321 --> 01:25:51,460
I can go to job at their company.

3417
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:53,140
Yet these are problems.

3418
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,520
So without going on too big of a rant,

3419
01:25:55,780 --> 01:25:59,530
I think ultimately a progressive tax can
help slow the process down of special

3420
01:25:59,531 --> 01:26:00,040
interests,

3421
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,300
acquiring too much power.

3422
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,440
Eventually it happens anyway.

3423
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,800
But with a flat tax,

3424
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:07,700
you're basically saying at a certain
point you can just keep dumping more and

3425
01:26:07,701 --> 01:26:08,780
more money into different investments.

3426
01:26:08,781 --> 01:26:12,080
Making more and more money and increasing
your power exponentially and other

3427
01:26:12,081 --> 01:26:14,810
people can't catch up to you and
then power becomes too quick,

3428
01:26:14,910 --> 01:26:15,743
right?

3429
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:17,753
Yeah.

3430
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:23,060
I think in this country we try to look
at success and achievement is something

3431
01:26:23,611 --> 01:26:26,700
that everyone's striving for it and we
don't want to put any restrictions on

3432
01:26:26,701 --> 01:26:27,210
that.

3433
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:30,450
We look At capitalism is the reason why
everything's going so great over here.

3434
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,141
This is America.

3435
01:26:31,141 --> 01:26:31,471
Atlanta,

3436
01:26:31,471 --> 01:26:32,490
the free home of the brave.

3437
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:33,870
Go out there and kick ass.

3438
01:26:33,871 --> 01:26:35,310
We're not going to
saddle you now with debt,

3439
01:26:36,180 --> 01:26:40,980
but it makes sense that after
a while as we're seeing today,

3440
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:42,750
but I don't mean what is,

3441
01:26:42,810 --> 01:26:45,570
what's the best way to do it
in socialism is not gonna work.

3442
01:26:45,571 --> 01:26:45,941
What,

3443
01:26:45,941 --> 01:26:46,150
what,

3444
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:46,983
what does work?

3445
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,610
I think a mixed economy,

3446
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:50,440
mixed economy where we are right now,

3447
01:26:50,470 --> 01:26:50,770
right?

3448
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:53,810
A portion of income is paid in taxes
for government programs for the,

3449
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:54,723
for the,

3450
01:26:54,750 --> 01:26:55,150
uh,

3451
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:56,380
for defense and things like that.

3452
01:26:56,980 --> 01:26:58,540
I just think we have a big
problem with corruption.

3453
01:26:58,840 --> 01:26:59,950
I think we've got bloat.

3454
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:04,600
I think we've got government agencies
that instead of reforming and breaking

3455
01:27:04,601 --> 01:27:05,230
them down,

3456
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:07,180
we just slept more bandaids on top.

3457
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:07,630
Yeah,

3458
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:10,000
we've got a festering wound and
we're putting bandages over bandages.

3459
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:10,271
you know,

3460
01:27:10,271 --> 01:27:11,051
it's like a certain point.

3461
01:27:11,051 --> 01:27:11,890
You gotta redo it.

3462
01:27:11,980 --> 01:27:13,180
We also have system

3463
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,840
that are in place that.

3464
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:20,110
I mean in terms of like the way
communities have always existed in certain

3465
01:27:22,281 --> 01:27:22,911
communities.

3466
01:27:22,911 --> 01:27:26,480
There's just poverty and crime and
no one does anything to fix it.

3467
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:26,990
Right,

3468
01:27:26,990 --> 01:27:28,510
and it seems to be that will.

3469
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:32,600
We're more than willing to go to other
countries and nation built were more than

3470
01:27:32,601 --> 01:27:35,000
willing to pump money
into different countries,

3471
01:27:35,001 --> 01:27:36,440
especially if they have natural resources,

3472
01:27:36,441 --> 01:27:37,940
but in our own country,

3473
01:27:38,180 --> 01:27:41,330
we're not mean the the greatest resources
of course human beings and the best

3474
01:27:41,331 --> 01:27:45,200
way to make America great or stronger
would be to have less losers or what's the

3475
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:46,640
best way to have less losers,

3476
01:27:46,641 --> 01:27:47,780
to have more people succeed.

3477
01:27:47,781 --> 01:27:49,310
What's the best way to
have more people succeed?

3478
01:27:49,550 --> 01:27:52,820
Give them more opportunity and
chance to not be stuck in a quagmire,

3479
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:54,620
not be trapped in a ghetto.

3480
01:27:54,820 --> 01:27:55,330
This is,

3481
01:27:55,330 --> 01:27:55,601
yeah,

3482
01:27:55,601 --> 01:28:00,601
so I believe we should allocate
access from other areas to improve the

3483
01:28:01,540 --> 01:28:01,840
areas.

3484
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:02,411
In that sense,

3485
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:05,650
I believe in socialism to a
certain extent like it with,

3486
01:28:05,810 --> 01:28:07,030
with fire departments.

3487
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:08,350
I Believe in it with
the police department.

3488
01:28:08,351 --> 01:28:10,750
I believe we should spend
money that comes out of,

3489
01:28:10,770 --> 01:28:11,000
you know,

3490
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,000
the publIc pool to fix things.

3491
01:28:13,001 --> 01:28:13,580
Right.

3492
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:14,420
I look at New York,

3493
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:15,830
there are some neighborhoods
that are really bad.

3494
01:28:15,860 --> 01:28:17,000
Some neighborhoods that are really good.

3495
01:28:17,570 --> 01:28:21,980
well if we take excess from the really
great neighborhoods and use that to fix

3496
01:28:21,981 --> 01:28:22,281
roads,

3497
01:28:22,281 --> 01:28:23,690
pay for schools in poor neighborhoods,

3498
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:27,200
crime is one of the biggest
correlations for crime and poverty.

3499
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:27,620
Yes.

3500
01:28:27,620 --> 01:28:29,570
So if we can get better schools,

3501
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,910
we need to reform the
school system straight up.

3502
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:33,620
If we can get better hospItals,

3503
01:28:33,621 --> 01:28:34,670
if we can fix the roads,

3504
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:38,870
then we're doing a lot to reduce crime
and reduce poverty and a rising tide

3505
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:39,733
lifts all ships.

3506
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:43,250
So that's why I.

3507
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:44,180
That's why I like bernie sanders,

3508
01:28:44,330 --> 01:28:45,170
although I will,

3509
01:28:45,171 --> 01:28:47,660
I say I make sure I tell people
like he is a little too left for me.

3510
01:28:47,661 --> 01:28:48,494
He is,

3511
01:28:48,500 --> 01:28:49,000
but when we,

3512
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,170
when we were looking
at who we had in 2016,

3513
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:51,921
I was like,

3514
01:28:51,921 --> 01:28:52,131
yeah,

3515
01:28:52,131 --> 01:28:52,940
bernie's my guy,

3516
01:28:52,940 --> 01:28:53,450
you know,

3517
01:28:53,450 --> 01:28:54,470
I like some parts of them.

3518
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,640
I liked him culturally.

3519
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,410
I liked to,

3520
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:57,243
you know,

3521
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,213
for the same

3522
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,330
in some ways that I
liked obama culturally.

3523
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:00,661
I mean,

3524
01:29:00,661 --> 01:29:02,490
I don't the drone attacks,

3525
01:29:02,500 --> 01:29:04,010
I don't like the attacks
on whistleblowers.

3526
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:07,980
There's a lot of aspects of it that I've
found very disturbing and distasteful

3527
01:29:07,981 --> 01:29:10,860
and against the narrative of
what we think of who he is.

3528
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:13,380
We think of him as this
extremely articulate,

3529
01:29:13,410 --> 01:29:16,430
very well read educated guy and you know,

3530
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:17,250
a good,

3531
01:29:17,250 --> 01:29:19,830
a good figurehead in terms
of like who the president is,

3532
01:29:20,120 --> 01:29:20,301
right?

3533
01:29:20,301 --> 01:29:20,800
Right.

3534
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:21,040
But,

3535
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:24,400
and he was drowned
bombing foreign countries.

3536
01:29:24,410 --> 01:29:27,950
His administration was claiming that
military aged men who were enemy

3537
01:29:27,951 --> 01:29:28,784
combatants,

3538
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:29,750
you know,

3539
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:31,280
so one of the,

3540
01:29:31,281 --> 01:29:33,050
one of the biggest age men period,

3541
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:33,560
right?

3542
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:34,080
Right.

3543
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,760
So it's like a dude carrying water
pills gets blown up and they're like,

3544
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:38,150
as a combatant realization.

3545
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:39,050
And so,

3546
01:29:39,050 --> 01:29:39,291
you know,

3547
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,220
when it comes to trump,

3548
01:29:40,310 --> 01:29:41,930
what did he do in missile strike in Syria?

3549
01:29:42,350 --> 01:29:43,550
Weapons deal with Saudi Arabia.

3550
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:44,570
Commando raids in Yemen,

3551
01:29:44,571 --> 01:29:47,300
a little girl got killed and
I've been for the most part,

3552
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:47,781
very,

3553
01:29:47,781 --> 01:29:51,260
very critical of him in any
other administration who
engages in regime change

3554
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:52,094
foreign wars.

3555
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:52,971
And look,

3556
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:53,804
I got to say,

3557
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:54,320
you know,

3558
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,520
when it comes to domestic issues,

3559
01:29:55,521 --> 01:29:56,120
I'm not,

3560
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:59,390
that's not my wheelhouse when it
comes to foreign policy stuff.

3561
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,430
Only a little bit like I've
been to some countries,

3562
01:30:01,431 --> 01:30:02,211
I've experienced stuff,

3563
01:30:02,211 --> 01:30:02,691
but really,

3564
01:30:02,691 --> 01:30:03,524
you know,

3565
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,710
on the ground cultural between
people is more my thing.

3566
01:30:06,950 --> 01:30:09,050
But I know more about
foreign policy than domestic.

3567
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:11,060
And when I see trump's foreign policy,

3568
01:30:11,870 --> 01:30:12,770
I was very critical of it.

3569
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:15,080
But I will point out
withdrawing from Syria,

3570
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:16,243
I'm a fan.

3571
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:16,821
Um,

3572
01:30:16,821 --> 01:30:19,580
I understand a lot more than
probably the average person does.

3573
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:21,230
Some of the issues surrounding Syria,

3574
01:30:21,231 --> 01:30:21,741
Russia,

3575
01:30:21,741 --> 01:30:22,081
the Qatar,

3576
01:30:22,081 --> 01:30:23,150
Turkey pipeline and things.

3577
01:30:23,151 --> 01:30:26,880
But typically I think it's usually a bad
idea when the u s involves itself's in

3578
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:29,990
foreign foreign interests and
tries engaging in these regimes,

3579
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,450
change strategies to build allies.

3580
01:30:32,930 --> 01:30:36,950
But one of the things that really
blew my mind is I saw a survey,

3581
01:30:37,620 --> 01:30:39,290
at least it was going on in
the inner on social media.

3582
01:30:39,291 --> 01:30:42,380
So who knows if it's true that claimed
the democrats have a favorable opinion of

3583
01:30:42,410 --> 01:30:43,370
george w dot bush,

3584
01:30:43,790 --> 01:30:44,031
you know,

3585
01:30:44,031 --> 01:30:45,230
some something to that effect.

3586
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:47,930
And they're there in retrospect like,

3587
01:30:47,931 --> 01:30:48,081
yeah,

3588
01:30:48,081 --> 01:30:49,430
like today they pulled them,

3589
01:30:49,431 --> 01:30:49,671
they're like,

3590
01:30:49,671 --> 01:30:49,761
oh,

3591
01:30:49,761 --> 01:30:50,150
he was good.

3592
01:30:50,150 --> 01:30:52,580
And there's a video of him like giving
a piece of candy to Michelle Obama.

3593
01:30:52,581 --> 01:30:53,121
And everyone was like,

3594
01:30:53,121 --> 01:30:53,721
what's going viral?

3595
01:30:53,721 --> 01:30:54,554
And people are laughing about.

3596
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:54,920
I'm like,

3597
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:55,491
are you not?

3598
01:30:55,491 --> 01:30:56,450
Say hold hands.

3599
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:57,403
That's crazy.

3600
01:30:57,530 --> 01:30:59,330
That guy is awful like that guy.

3601
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:00,860
But what happened?

3602
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,980
And then when trump announces he's
going to pull troops out of Syria,

3603
01:31:03,981 --> 01:31:04,880
everybody opposes it,

3604
01:31:04,881 --> 01:31:07,580
like the media saying it's wrong and
you've got a lot of like mainstream people

3605
01:31:07,581 --> 01:31:08,301
on the left saying it's wrong.

3606
01:31:08,301 --> 01:31:09,134
And I'm like,

3607
01:31:09,470 --> 01:31:10,303
it is,

3608
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,473
what do you mean?

3609
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:12,860
Like that's crazy to me.

3610
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:13,400
Like,

3611
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:13,851
you know,

3612
01:31:13,851 --> 01:31:14,270
uh,

3613
01:31:14,270 --> 01:31:15,320
all of my activist friends,

3614
01:31:15,321 --> 01:31:16,670
we've never been in favor of that stuff.

3615
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:17,320
We've always opposed.

3616
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:18,710
That's always been the left's position.

3617
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:22,880
And now I'm seeing people who claim to
be on the left support multinational

3618
01:31:22,881 --> 01:31:25,040
businesses as private businesses
doing whatever they want,

3619
01:31:25,490 --> 01:31:26,001
meaning look,

3620
01:31:26,001 --> 01:31:26,571
social media,

3621
01:31:26,571 --> 01:31:26,890
corporate,

3622
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:27,680
like,

3623
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:28,310
like dude,

3624
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:28,820
you know,

3625
01:31:28,820 --> 01:31:29,421
Saudi Arabia,

3626
01:31:29,421 --> 01:31:31,880
I think it's a saudi prince is one
of the biggest investors in twitter.

3627
01:31:32,650 --> 01:31:33,050
Real.

3628
01:31:33,050 --> 01:31:33,411
Yeah.

3629
01:31:33,411 --> 01:31:33,860
Yeah.

3630
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:37,880
And so it's like there have been a series
of people who have gotten letters that

3631
01:31:37,881 --> 01:31:39,290
they violated pakistani law.

3632
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:40,020
I mean,

3633
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:40,340
they,

3634
01:31:40,340 --> 01:31:41,210
they send screenshots,

3635
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,230
screenshots can be faked.

3636
01:31:42,231 --> 01:31:44,390
But there've been a couple
of people who have been like,

3637
01:31:44,391 --> 01:31:46,730
for some reason twitter
decided to inform me of this.

3638
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:48,740
And then it's,

3639
01:31:48,910 --> 01:31:49,240
it's,

3640
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:50,210
it's a multinational.

3641
01:31:50,230 --> 01:31:50,571
Let's,

3642
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:52,970
let's talk about the
algorithmic apocalypse.

3643
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:53,990
Let's segue into that.

3644
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:58,580
You've got a platform where our public
discourse is happening where the left has

3645
01:31:58,581 --> 01:32:00,070
repeatedly said that russians

3646
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:04,390
used it to manipulate our elections were
one of its biggest investors is a saudi

3647
01:32:04,391 --> 01:32:05,950
prince or something to that effect.

3648
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:07,750
And they're banning.

3649
01:32:07,751 --> 01:32:08,580
People have,

3650
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:09,580
have a certain,

3651
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:09,850
uh,

3652
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:11,350
who oppose a certain ideological bent.

3653
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:11,950
Right?

3654
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:13,600
That sounds like a democratic crisis,

3655
01:32:13,900 --> 01:32:14,490
right?

3656
01:32:14,490 --> 01:32:14,820
If,

3657
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:16,480
if this is where the public sphere is,

3658
01:32:16,481 --> 01:32:18,790
if you know you said milo's
no longer in the conversation,

3659
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:19,540
you know,

3660
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:21,340
he's banned from twitter even
though got millions of followers,

3661
01:32:21,710 --> 01:32:22,600
they don't talk about him anymore.

3662
01:32:22,601 --> 01:32:23,350
He's off twitter.

3663
01:32:23,350 --> 01:32:24,210
Twitter really is important.

3664
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:25,044
The president is there.

3665
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:26,860
So if you start removing people,

3666
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:29,740
you've got foreign interests who have
a stake in what twitter is doing.

3667
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:30,281
Yeah,

3668
01:32:30,281 --> 01:32:32,800
they can seriously
influence our elections and,

3669
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:33,010
and,

3670
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:34,600
and they,

3671
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:35,370
they are.

3672
01:32:35,370 --> 01:32:35,670
But I'll,

3673
01:32:35,670 --> 01:32:35,980
but I'll,

3674
01:32:35,980 --> 01:32:40,360
but I'll move into a what most
really crazy New York times reported.

3675
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:45,420
There's a group that false flagged the
republicans in Alabama with fake twitter

3676
01:32:45,671 --> 01:32:48,460
accounts they made to convince the media.

3677
01:32:48,580 --> 01:32:51,010
Russians were propping up
the campaign of Roy Moore.

3678
01:32:52,060 --> 01:32:57,060
So basically this coordinator
times is all fact this.

3679
01:32:57,190 --> 01:32:58,090
They've seen the documents,

3680
01:32:58,091 --> 01:32:58,924
they've reported it,

3681
01:32:59,050 --> 01:33:02,080
that democratic operatives smeared,

3682
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:02,570
uh,

3683
01:33:02,570 --> 01:33:05,320
engaging a false flag campaign to make
it appear like the russians were popping

3684
01:33:05,321 --> 01:33:05,411
up.

3685
01:33:05,411 --> 01:33:07,840
Republicans and the national
media in the us ran with it.

3686
01:33:08,170 --> 01:33:12,580
How that's not a crime is beyond me that's
interfering in elections and we know

3687
01:33:12,581 --> 01:33:13,414
it.

3688
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:15,040
And this group is still being cited.

3689
01:33:15,041 --> 01:33:16,180
They're smearing tulsi gabbard,

3690
01:33:16,181 --> 01:33:16,740
right?

3691
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:17,080
Yeah.

3692
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,420
An nbc news article came out
saying that russians are,

3693
01:33:19,450 --> 01:33:19,651
you know,

3694
01:33:19,651 --> 01:33:20,620
have taken notice of her campaign,

3695
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:21,160
are promoting it.

3696
01:33:21,160 --> 01:33:21,993
Same group,

3697
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:24,060
still running the story.

3698
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:29,020
How,

3699
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:32,070
how that's not a crime
is mind blowing to me.

3700
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:33,870
But the New York times reported it.

3701
01:33:33,871 --> 01:33:35,040
So it's at this point it's like,

3702
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:35,971
I mean,

3703
01:33:35,971 --> 01:33:36,130
that's,

3704
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:39,420
I think we have to be aware that there's
so much manipulation going on right now

3705
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:41,250
from almost every angle.

3706
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:41,880
Oh yeah.

3707
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:42,630
So I mean,

3708
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:47,190
and what's hilarious is that people look
at what's going on with russian troll

3709
01:33:47,191 --> 01:33:49,020
factories and you know,

3710
01:33:49,021 --> 01:33:50,700
the way they're trying to
influence our elections,

3711
01:33:50,701 --> 01:33:54,840
that it's particularly
egregious where we do that shit.

3712
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,310
I'll totally plus.

3713
01:33:56,580 --> 01:33:59,280
And I'm pretty sure we learned about
the us doing it well before we learned

3714
01:33:59,281 --> 01:34:01,900
Russia was doing it and I'd be
willing to bet the us started it.

3715
01:34:02,070 --> 01:34:03,270
It's just the whole thing is.

3716
01:34:03,271 --> 01:34:06,600
So you can't pay attention to all of it.

3717
01:34:06,690 --> 01:34:07,740
That's part of the problem.

3718
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:07,870
Yeah.

3719
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:08,071
I mean,

3720
01:34:08,071 --> 01:34:08,970
maybe you can,

3721
01:34:09,230 --> 01:34:11,340
if this is what you're
doing seven days a week and,

3722
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:12,421
and even,

3723
01:34:12,421 --> 01:34:14,340
you will probably struggle to keep up,

3724
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:15,510
but like me,

3725
01:34:15,511 --> 01:34:18,960
I can't and it's one of the reasons why
I brought you in here when you and I had

3726
01:34:18,961 --> 01:34:19,860
that conversation.

3727
01:34:21,020 --> 01:34:22,590
One of the first things I
realized right away was,

3728
01:34:22,591 --> 01:34:22,691
oh,

3729
01:34:22,691 --> 01:34:23,524
okay,

3730
01:34:24,060 --> 01:34:25,980
I could have you coach me
like we talked about this,

3731
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:27,930
but I'm not going to.

3732
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:28,590
I'm like,

3733
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,760
I'm not going to get it all.

3734
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:33,330
I'm going to have to like study it
for a long time and I don't have the

3735
01:34:33,331 --> 01:34:37,410
resources to do that as part of the
problem that I had with that one podcast

3736
01:34:37,411 --> 01:34:37,771
with jack.

3737
01:34:37,771 --> 01:34:40,680
I just don't have the resources and yes.

3738
01:34:40,830 --> 01:34:41,190
Um,

3739
01:34:41,190 --> 01:34:42,780
so I think it'd be fair to point out,

3740
01:34:42,870 --> 01:34:43,081
you know,

3741
01:34:43,081 --> 01:34:46,230
like youtube criticism too
because talking about censorship,

3742
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,680
I think a lot of people immediately
assumed I'd come out here and start waving

3743
01:34:49,681 --> 01:34:50,610
my arms in the air screaming.

3744
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:51,720
They're biaSed against conservatives,

3745
01:34:51,721 --> 01:34:52,830
which I think twenty cent I kind of did.

3746
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:55,070
but youtube is,

3747
01:34:55,170 --> 01:34:56,730
as is a bit different.

3748
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,100
Youtube does,

3749
01:34:58,310 --> 01:35:02,690
it has demonetized lgbt content and
youtube has said that these topics are not

3750
01:35:02,691 --> 01:35:04,820
suitable for all advertisers
because it deals with sexuality.

3751
01:35:05,180 --> 01:35:07,280
They have target many left wing channels,

3752
01:35:07,550 --> 01:35:10,910
there are a lot of non
mainstream left wing outlets.

3753
01:35:10,940 --> 01:35:11,840
And when you say target,

3754
01:35:11,841 --> 01:35:15,380
what you mean is demonetize do you
monetize or sometimes outright ban?

3755
01:35:15,480 --> 01:35:19,330
And I think for demonetizing
I think they've made a stick.

3756
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:20,121
What was the,

3757
01:35:20,121 --> 01:35:20,381
uh,

3758
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:23,150
the policy that it's essentially
things that are political.

3759
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:24,073
Correct.

3760
01:35:24,620 --> 01:35:25,520
If they made that statement,

3761
01:35:25,521 --> 01:35:26,490
I know that I've seen I was,

3762
01:35:26,491 --> 01:35:26,840
wasn't,

3763
01:35:26,840 --> 01:35:29,870
I was going to interject that
they've also banned are not banned,

3764
01:35:29,871 --> 01:35:30,591
but do you monetize?

3765
01:35:30,591 --> 01:35:33,870
PeopLe are extensively people
that smoke weed on their channel,

3766
01:35:34,010 --> 01:35:34,843
totally.

3767
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:39,130
Certain video game channels that have for
an unknown reasons just stopped having

3768
01:35:39,131 --> 01:35:40,460
a monetization on their channel too.

3769
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:40,700
Right?

3770
01:35:40,700 --> 01:35:41,690
And that is the problem.

3771
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:45,160
Ultimately them having this
incredible power where they,

3772
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:46,160
they really,

3773
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:46,761
there's no,

3774
01:35:46,761 --> 01:35:50,420
there's not real open competition
in terms of like another,

3775
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:55,880
like a parallel competitor and I
don't think there will be mailing but.

3776
01:35:55,881 --> 01:35:56,714
But here's the thing,

3777
01:35:56,810 --> 01:35:57,643
I,

3778
01:35:58,140 --> 01:35:59,810
I think you've touched on a
bunch of really bad things.

3779
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:00,840
I'm going to give a,

3780
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,020
a very important shout
out to monkey jones,

3781
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:07,220
who was wrongly terminated from
youtube for highly dubious reasons.

3782
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:08,510
He Is a dark,

3783
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:09,201
dark,

3784
01:36:09,201 --> 01:36:09,530
comedic,

3785
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:10,130
dark comic.

3786
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:11,930
He had hundreds of thousands of followers.

3787
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,410
He made jokes about things
like school shootings,

3788
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,333
very dark stuff,

3789
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:17,990
but it was clearly mocking.

3790
01:36:18,110 --> 01:36:19,760
Some of these people was
mocking elliot roger.

3791
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,840
He was making jokes about it and in
fact some of his videos were approved

3792
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:25,190
manually for monetization,

3793
01:36:25,640 --> 01:36:28,670
but for some reason youtube just
wiped them out one day gone.

3794
01:36:29,210 --> 01:36:30,830
So I set up a new channel and said,

3795
01:36:30,831 --> 01:36:31,191
okay,

3796
01:36:31,191 --> 01:36:31,430
you know,

3797
01:36:31,430 --> 01:36:32,360
we're not going to do that anyway.

3798
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:32,780
Doesn't matter.

3799
01:36:32,780 --> 01:36:33,440
They got rid of him.

3800
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:35,450
He's effectively off of youtube.

3801
01:36:36,140 --> 01:36:37,520
And he was like,

3802
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:37,770
he's a,

3803
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:38,810
he's a well known funny guy.

3804
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:40,370
He wasn't breaking the rules,

3805
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:40,821
he wasn't,

3806
01:36:40,821 --> 01:36:41,510
but they still deleted,

3807
01:36:41,510 --> 01:36:42,380
deleted his channel.

3808
01:36:42,890 --> 01:36:46,640
So I bring him up because I
think it's worrisome that yes,

3809
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,690
without an alternative,

3810
01:36:47,930 --> 01:36:51,200
you're career is wiped out in a second
with no recourse and no reason why.

3811
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:55,310
And the response they give you as it's
our platform and you'll hear people say,

3812
01:36:55,311 --> 01:36:55,401
oh,

3813
01:36:55,401 --> 01:36:56,270
but there are private business,

3814
01:36:56,271 --> 01:36:57,380
they can do what they want short,

3815
01:36:57,381 --> 01:36:58,214
but they're a monopoly.

3816
01:36:58,460 --> 01:36:59,870
We've got to have restrictions on that.

3817
01:37:00,030 --> 01:37:00,863
Yeah,

3818
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:02,233
yeah.

3819
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:02,611
Sorry,

3820
01:37:02,611 --> 01:37:05,310
I have a question to ask here because
I've had this conversation with some

3821
01:37:05,311 --> 01:37:08,080
friends of mine and this came up in like,

3822
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:08,401
this is,

3823
01:37:08,401 --> 01:37:11,100
I guess the devil's advocate to this
question because this happened with my

3824
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:11,490
space.

3825
01:37:11,490 --> 01:37:15,660
My space still exists and there are
people that had millions of followers on

3826
01:37:15,661 --> 01:37:16,494
that platform.

3827
01:37:16,890 --> 01:37:21,030
Are they owed something by my space
because my space failed and their,

3828
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:24,270
their accounts no longer have
the clout that they once had.

3829
01:37:24,660 --> 01:37:24,940
No.

3830
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:25,140
You know,

3831
01:37:25,140 --> 01:37:25,231
like.

3832
01:37:25,231 --> 01:37:26,070
So if for instance,

3833
01:37:26,071 --> 01:37:27,030
like if youtube failed,

3834
01:37:27,031 --> 01:37:29,040
tomorrow is pooty pie,

3835
01:37:29,041 --> 01:37:32,110
sue them because they've made bad
business decisions and now for an issue.

3836
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:33,150
Totally,

3837
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:33,820
totally different.

3838
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:35,210
I know that.

3839
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:37,560
I see what you're sending
the twitter account,

3840
01:37:37,561 --> 01:37:41,880
like they're not banning someone's ip
address from using twitter.com and go into

3841
01:37:41,881 --> 01:37:43,830
c slash real Donald Trump
and see what he's saying.

3842
01:37:43,980 --> 01:37:44,730
But listen,

3843
01:37:44,730 --> 01:37:47,160
your myspace failed
because of alternatives.

3844
01:37:47,760 --> 01:37:49,170
Facebook became more prominent,

3845
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:50,160
there was an option

3846
01:37:50,690 --> 01:37:53,900
and the other issue is monkey
jones followed the rules.

3847
01:37:54,440 --> 01:37:54,830
He was,

3848
01:37:54,830 --> 01:37:55,670
he told by youtube,

3849
01:37:55,680 --> 01:37:56,670
this is what you can
and can't do anything.

3850
01:37:56,690 --> 01:37:57,240
You got it.

3851
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,560
And then one day they just wiped him out.

3852
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:00,750
and so then they'd never
gave any explanation.

3853
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:02,880
I don't believe so.

3854
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:04,920
And it was reallY weird because,

3855
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:05,610
and uh,

3856
01:38:05,610 --> 01:38:05,970
I,

3857
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:06,781
it's been a little while,

3858
01:38:06,781 --> 01:38:07,531
so I went over the story,

3859
01:38:07,531 --> 01:38:10,620
but there was a video he posted that was
like a music video making fun of elliot

3860
01:38:10,621 --> 01:38:11,040
roger.

3861
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:11,890
He's that school that,

3862
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:12,743
that administrator guy,

3863
01:38:13,190 --> 01:38:15,560
it existed on different channels on other,

3864
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:18,870
like another prominent channel it
existed and they banned him and then he

3865
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:21,030
brought up like why was it banned on mine?

3866
01:38:21,031 --> 01:38:22,080
But this one was approved.

3867
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:23,640
and then a day later
they band the other one.

3868
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:25,120
They copyright struck it.

3869
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,130
The issue here is if there was an
alternative to youtube you where you can

3870
01:38:29,131 --> 01:38:29,670
operate,

3871
01:38:29,670 --> 01:38:30,240
I'd be on it,

3872
01:38:30,240 --> 01:38:30,540
right?

3873
01:38:30,540 --> 01:38:30,901
so,

3874
01:38:30,901 --> 01:38:31,530
um,

3875
01:38:31,530 --> 01:38:32,610
one of the things I'll give a shout out,

3876
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:33,600
I've been using minds,

3877
01:38:33,630 --> 01:38:34,350
am I mds?

3878
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:37,260
I'm actually having build
the guy that owns it.

3879
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:38,430
How do you spell your last name?

3880
01:38:38,431 --> 01:38:39,630
Altman altman.

3881
01:38:39,631 --> 01:38:40,920
Bill altman's coming on soon.

3882
01:38:41,190 --> 01:38:41,500
I'm a,

3883
01:38:41,500 --> 01:38:45,390
I made a concerted effort after that
podcast to reach out to a bunch of

3884
01:38:45,391 --> 01:38:48,320
different people and try to
expand this conversation.

3885
01:38:48,330 --> 01:38:51,670
I want to have the guy from gab to gaps,

3886
01:38:51,720 --> 01:38:52,890
gaps in murky,

3887
01:38:52,940 --> 01:38:53,310
you know,

3888
01:38:53,310 --> 01:38:56,970
a gab has been murky in terms
of content but not really.

3889
01:38:58,050 --> 01:38:58,760
I don't think so.

3890
01:38:58,760 --> 01:38:59,130
Um,

3891
01:38:59,130 --> 01:38:59,731
so I did it.

3892
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:01,080
I researched this a little bit.

3893
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,520
If you look at their wikipedia page,

3894
01:39:02,580 --> 01:39:03,960
It's simple sourcing.

3895
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:05,570
They um,

3896
01:39:05,610 --> 01:39:06,960
there was a study done on gab that found,

3897
01:39:06,990 --> 01:39:10,320
I think they only have like five percent
of the posts are considered to be hate

3898
01:39:10,321 --> 01:39:10,681
speech,

3899
01:39:10,681 --> 01:39:12,930
whereas twitter is like two
point three or something.

3900
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:16,200
So gab is predominantly not hate speech,

3901
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:17,700
not much more than twitter.

3902
01:39:17,970 --> 01:39:20,220
And when you consider that
we're looking at percentages,

3903
01:39:20,221 --> 01:39:23,730
you can actually see that twitter is hate
speech isn't the millions and gabs is

3904
01:39:23,731 --> 01:39:24,870
in the tens of thousands,

3905
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,280
but gab is run,

3906
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:26,760
you know,

3907
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:27,210
volume.

3908
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:28,290
the media nonstop.

3909
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:28,890
Yes.

3910
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:29,723
Men,

3911
01:39:29,910 --> 01:39:32,040
I think when it comes to youtube,

3912
01:39:32,130 --> 01:39:32,730
I actually,

3913
01:39:32,730 --> 01:39:33,563
I actually trust them.

3914
01:39:33,630 --> 01:39:34,021
I do,

3915
01:39:34,021 --> 01:39:34,854
I really do.

3916
01:39:34,920 --> 01:39:38,730
I think the reason they took on monkey
is because the potential for a pr

3917
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:40,830
backlash over his kind
of content was so great.

3918
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:41,131
They said,

3919
01:39:41,131 --> 01:39:42,960
we don't care and that's
unfair and it's wrong.

3920
01:39:42,961 --> 01:39:43,860
I think they were wrong and do it,

3921
01:39:44,190 --> 01:39:44,610
but,

3922
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,900
but you understand the motivation.

3923
01:39:45,990 --> 01:39:48,960
I understand the motivation and I actually
think youtube does more to protect

3924
01:39:48,961 --> 01:39:51,120
free speech on the internet than
a lot of these other companies do.

3925
01:39:51,750 --> 01:39:52,290
when a.

3926
01:39:52,290 --> 01:39:52,950
And I'll give you a few example.

3927
01:39:52,950 --> 01:39:53,180
I'll get,

3928
01:39:53,180 --> 01:39:55,770
I'll get one good example is first of all,

3929
01:39:55,771 --> 01:39:58,320
when you're demonetized you
still earn youtube red revenue,

3930
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,930
so youtube still will,

3931
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:02,430
like they're trying to pay you.

3932
01:40:02,431 --> 01:40:03,264
they want the money.

3933
01:40:03,780 --> 01:40:04,613
But uh,

3934
01:40:04,860 --> 01:40:08,760
with sargon avocado getting banned from
patrion patrion banned him because they

3935
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:11,640
said you used the naughty word
on youtube eight months ago.

3936
01:40:12,180 --> 01:40:13,040
Youtube doesn't care.

3937
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:14,220
He said the word right.

3938
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:15,700
Is that the pod where you called that?

3939
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:16,920
The outright,

3940
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:19,050
the white end word you didn't care.

3941
01:40:19,320 --> 01:40:20,031
Youtube said it's,

3942
01:40:20,031 --> 01:40:21,220
it's fine on a platform that,

3943
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:21,720
that's fine,

3944
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,553
that's fine.

3945
01:40:22,930 --> 01:40:26,250
Pastry set the context and the
context of which it was used to.

3946
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:28,710
It just takes 30 seconds
listening to it go,

3947
01:40:28,711 --> 01:40:28,861
oh,

3948
01:40:28,861 --> 01:40:29,610
I see what he's doing.

3949
01:40:29,610 --> 01:40:32,190
Even if it's kind of a
clunky use of the word.

3950
01:40:32,700 --> 01:40:34,490
He's not using it in a race racist,

3951
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:35,460
racist way.

3952
01:40:35,460 --> 01:40:36,420
He was trying to,

3953
01:40:36,690 --> 01:40:37,170
you know,

3954
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:37,620
uh,

3955
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,453
actually this is,

3956
01:40:38,670 --> 01:40:40,770
he was trying to show how stupid they are,

3957
01:40:41,070 --> 01:40:45,270
but can we talk about the bias on twitter
with sara jong who for three years

3958
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:48,780
with posting anti white
racist like mean spirited,

3959
01:40:48,781 --> 01:40:49,411
awful things.

3960
01:40:49,411 --> 01:40:52,260
And the excuse was she was using
the language of our oppressors.

3961
01:40:52,610 --> 01:40:53,050
yeah.

3962
01:40:53,050 --> 01:40:54,190
Well we think sargon was doing.

3963
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:55,840
He was using their language against them.

3964
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:56,411
Exactly.

3965
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:57,460
They hire at the New York times.

3966
01:40:57,490 --> 01:40:57,820
Yes.

3967
01:40:57,820 --> 01:40:58,120
That's,

3968
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:58,751
that's terrifying.

3969
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:02,530
And there was a huge backlash there and
I don't want to take this opportunity

3970
01:41:02,531 --> 01:41:02,631
to,

3971
01:41:02,631 --> 01:41:03,850
to point out media matters.

3972
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:08,020
There was when that thing went around
the alternative influence network lying,

3973
01:41:08,580 --> 01:41:11,830
like there was a media
matters wrote about it.

3974
01:41:12,260 --> 01:41:15,130
I politely reached out to the person
who did and their response was,

3975
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,190
I hope a bird poops on your head and it
gets in your eyebrow and you smell like

3976
01:41:18,191 --> 01:41:19,024
farts.

3977
01:41:19,300 --> 01:41:20,070
That was,

3978
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:21,670
that's the response they gave me.

3979
01:41:22,030 --> 01:41:22,540
What?

3980
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:23,373
Yeah.

3981
01:41:23,590 --> 01:41:24,340
I said,

3982
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:25,360
just want to give you a heads up.

3983
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:26,650
There's a lot that's wrong in this report.

3984
01:41:26,651 --> 01:41:27,280
It's not true.

3985
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:28,690
My dental hold these beliefs.

3986
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,010
I've never had this individual.

3987
01:41:30,011 --> 01:41:30,550
And that was,

3988
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:35,340
that was the response to literal response
was I hope a bird poops on your poops

3989
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,500
on you and it falls into your eyebrow
and you smell like a dirty farts or

3990
01:41:38,501 --> 01:41:39,334
something.

3991
01:41:39,970 --> 01:41:40,530
Then when I,

3992
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:40,980
when I,

3993
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:41,230
uh,

3994
01:41:41,230 --> 01:41:41,530
I,

3995
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:42,363
I,

3996
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:42,791
so,

3997
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:43,570
so yeah,

3998
01:41:43,570 --> 01:41:47,320
I mean I got a hold of their fucking
typewriter or keyboard rather than.

3999
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:47,830
And you know,

4000
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:52,830
I'm the guy who started it was at a
political and he and he set up on stage.

4001
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:56,620
Fake news is predominantly it's.

4002
01:41:56,790 --> 01:41:57,623
He said it's only,

4003
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,520
it's only a phenomenon of the right to
the left doesn't engage in conspiracies

4004
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:01,001
and fake news,

4005
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:01,780
which is nonsense.

4006
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:02,613
Of course they do.

4007
01:42:02,920 --> 01:42:04,240
And I afterwards,

4008
01:42:04,241 --> 01:42:04,960
I said,

4009
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,170
let me ask you then because one of your
writers responded to me in this way and

4010
01:42:08,171 --> 01:42:09,004
he's like,

4011
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:11,380
I don't know anything
about it and I can respond.

4012
01:42:11,381 --> 01:42:12,940
And then he walked off and I was like,

4013
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:14,080
you know,

4014
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:17,410
I want to circle back to gab because I
get what you were saying that the volume

4015
01:42:17,411 --> 01:42:19,210
is lower and that there's less

4016
01:42:20,890 --> 01:42:21,690
I read.

4017
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:22,050
Right.

4018
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:22,720
What do you,

4019
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,310
what is your opinion of it though?

4020
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:25,540
You were kind of.

4021
01:42:25,541 --> 01:42:26,740
We kind of got sidetracked.

4022
01:42:26,770 --> 01:42:26,921
Oh,

4023
01:42:26,921 --> 01:42:27,550
it's a,

4024
01:42:27,550 --> 01:42:28,383
it's.

4025
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:28,910
I don't,

4026
01:42:28,910 --> 01:42:29,351
I don't know.

4027
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:29,541
I,

4028
01:42:29,541 --> 01:42:31,810
I can agree with the general notion,

4029
01:42:32,050 --> 01:42:33,340
the ideology of if it's legal,

4030
01:42:33,341 --> 01:42:34,174
it's allowed.

4031
01:42:34,370 --> 01:42:34,710
Um,

4032
01:42:34,710 --> 01:42:35,140
and I would,

4033
01:42:35,140 --> 01:42:36,010
I would argue that,

4034
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:36,280
you know,

4035
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:38,650
what jack is trying to do with
twitter or I would say him personally,

4036
01:42:38,651 --> 01:42:41,050
but what twitter is trying to
do is what create like a comfy,

4037
01:42:41,051 --> 01:42:43,080
padded neon room for
the kids to hang out at.

4038
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:43,240
NoW.

4039
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:44,290
The real world is harsh.

4040
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,390
I think what they're trying to do,

4041
01:42:46,450 --> 01:42:47,650
and I don't want to speak for him,

4042
01:42:47,651 --> 01:42:50,710
but I think they're trying to engineer
the conversation to be more polite and

4043
01:42:50,711 --> 01:42:52,660
civil says who exactly,

4044
01:42:52,710 --> 01:42:52,960
you know,

4045
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:53,181
whose,

4046
01:42:53,181 --> 01:42:53,891
whose definition?

4047
01:42:53,891 --> 01:42:54,724
That's a good point.

4048
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:55,200
And that's,

4049
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:55,570
and that's,

4050
01:42:55,570 --> 01:42:56,200
that's.

4051
01:42:56,200 --> 01:42:57,800
I see so many of these people who just,

4052
01:42:57,830 --> 01:42:59,740
they wield power and
they're unaccountable.

4053
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:00,461
Well,

4054
01:43:00,461 --> 01:43:03,550
it's also you don't recognize
the consequences of telling
people what they can

4055
01:43:03,551 --> 01:43:05,010
and can't do and that it's.

4056
01:43:05,070 --> 01:43:06,520
This is a very slippery slope.

4057
01:43:06,521 --> 01:43:07,720
You running up a greased hill.

4058
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:08,240
Yeah,

4059
01:43:08,240 --> 01:43:09,670
and people don't like it.

4060
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:11,900
They don't like it and well the,

4061
01:43:11,930 --> 01:43:13,060
the thing is like

4062
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:15,881
when you see something,

4063
01:43:15,881 --> 01:43:16,714
like if,

4064
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:19,390
if everything was just open,

4065
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:22,840
what would the conversation be
like if there was no banning,

4066
01:43:23,130 --> 01:43:24,040
if there was nothing,

4067
01:43:24,370 --> 01:43:29,350
it was just everything was real
free speech you would have.

4068
01:43:29,380 --> 01:43:30,210
I mean if it was,

4069
01:43:30,210 --> 01:43:31,660
if it was impossible,

4070
01:43:31,661 --> 01:43:32,494
let's put it this way,

4071
01:43:32,680 --> 01:43:36,880
it was impossible to ban someone
from any social media platform,

4072
01:43:36,881 --> 01:43:39,160
whether it's youtube or
twitter or instagram.

4073
01:43:39,460 --> 01:43:41,950
What would the conversations look like?

4074
01:43:42,070 --> 01:43:46,780
How much dIfferent would they be and
would we maybe have a healthier way of

4075
01:43:46,781 --> 01:43:47,614
adjusting?

4076
01:43:47,800 --> 01:43:49,090
I think it would be worse,

4077
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:51,100
worse because I could,

4078
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:53,960
I could be temporary or in the long run,

4079
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:55,640
maybe temporary,

4080
01:43:55,670 --> 01:43:56,151
but there,

4081
01:43:56,151 --> 01:43:59,030
I believe it's called the
online inhibition effect.

4082
01:43:59,660 --> 01:44:02,960
Basically the opportunity to be
anonymous online and the and the and the

4083
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:04,160
distance makes people.

4084
01:44:04,220 --> 01:44:08,630
They have no problem being their worst
self and so I can understand what twitter

4085
01:44:08,631 --> 01:44:09,350
wants to do.

4086
01:44:09,350 --> 01:44:09,741
They say,

4087
01:44:09,741 --> 01:44:10,041
hey,

4088
01:44:10,041 --> 01:44:12,950
we need to figure out how we stop people
from being mean all the time because

4089
01:44:12,951 --> 01:44:13,600
twitter is,

4090
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:16,430
it's a hellscape of just mean people
saying nothing but mean things,

4091
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:18,170
but it's also again,

4092
01:44:18,171 --> 01:44:20,360
because they're anonymous
and because it's possible.

4093
01:44:20,420 --> 01:44:22,430
But then look,

4094
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:23,830
alex joneS can,

4095
01:44:23,880 --> 01:44:25,520
can say a bunch of really awful things.

4096
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:26,420
It's his right to do so.

4097
01:44:26,421 --> 01:44:26,901
Should it be bent?

4098
01:44:26,901 --> 01:44:27,734
He shouldn't.

4099
01:44:27,850 --> 01:44:28,091
If,

4100
01:44:28,091 --> 01:44:30,440
if so it does.

4101
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:31,790
Does Alex Jones?

4102
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:32,510
Uh,

4103
01:44:32,510 --> 01:44:33,110
I'm not.

4104
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:34,880
I don't want to directly accused
him because I don't watch his show.

4105
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:38,310
But if he goes on twitter and he says
something that's deemed to be false shitty

4106
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:38,990
band for that,

4107
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:39,890
now if he,

4108
01:44:39,891 --> 01:44:41,750
if he challenges the journalists
should be banned for that.

4109
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:42,620
No,

4110
01:44:42,620 --> 01:44:43,850
because let me tell you,

4111
01:44:43,970 --> 01:44:45,860
because he says thIngs
about me that aren't true.

4112
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:47,730
I don't think it should be right.

4113
01:44:48,110 --> 01:44:48,680
I think,

4114
01:44:48,680 --> 01:44:51,680
and he's saying the things about me
and I don't think he should be banned.

4115
01:44:51,681 --> 01:44:53,540
I think alex,

4116
01:44:53,541 --> 01:44:54,380
I think we should talk,

4117
01:44:54,760 --> 01:44:55,940
have a conversation.

4118
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:57,200
I watched those videos.

4119
01:44:58,580 --> 01:44:59,330
He's upset,

4120
01:44:59,330 --> 01:45:00,021
he's upset,

4121
01:45:00,021 --> 01:45:01,580
and I get it in certain ways.

4122
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:05,510
I get it and he thinks I took a shot at
him and I get it and I probably did and

4123
01:45:05,511 --> 01:45:06,344
I shouldn't have.

4124
01:45:06,380 --> 01:45:06,640
So.

4125
01:45:06,640 --> 01:45:07,040
So here's,

4126
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:07,520
here's the thing,

4127
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:07,820
the,

4128
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:10,340
my point is I don't think
you should be banned.

4129
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:10,990
Right?

4130
01:45:10,990 --> 01:45:11,823
And it's,

4131
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,190
he's doing it at me.

4132
01:45:13,370 --> 01:45:13,581
yeah.

4133
01:45:13,581 --> 01:45:14,260
Yeah.

4134
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:14,871
I'm like,

4135
01:45:14,871 --> 01:45:17,330
I mentioned those people from occupy
who lie about me all the time.

4136
01:45:17,331 --> 01:45:18,830
They've posted the most
ridiculous lies about me.

4137
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:19,780
I still don't think it should be banned.

4138
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:20,220
right?

4139
01:45:20,220 --> 01:45:20,600
Does.

4140
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:24,530
The thing is if you ban them
and then someone opposes them,

4141
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,730
but then someone opposes the people who
oppose them and they want them banned,

4142
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:31,310
and then you have this
fucking war back and forth,

4143
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:36,580
and instead of fighting bad
ideas or incorrect ideas
with correct or good ideas,

4144
01:45:37,730 --> 01:45:39,240
now you just have people present.

4145
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:41,420
Banhammer Is left and right and you're
just trying to figure out who the

4146
01:45:41,421 --> 01:45:43,340
majority is so you can side
with the biggest group,

4147
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:46,910
but then you're trying to virtue signal
and you're trying to get something that

4148
01:45:46,911 --> 01:45:48,230
supports your ideology,

4149
01:45:48,231 --> 01:45:49,250
whether it's right or left.

4150
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:49,420
So.

4151
01:45:49,420 --> 01:45:50,510
So here's the thing with jones though,

4152
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,100
if the people on the left one to argue
that he is making the platform worse and

4153
01:45:55,160 --> 01:45:55,993
horrible,

4154
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:58,040
I understand that and I recognize,

4155
01:45:58,041 --> 01:45:59,000
well that's unfortunate,

4156
01:45:59,030 --> 01:45:59,540
right?

4157
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:00,380
This is the real world.

4158
01:46:00,381 --> 01:46:01,820
And sometimes people say
things you don't like,

4159
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:03,043
but more importantly,

4160
01:46:03,410 --> 01:46:04,820
a lot of people argued that when he,

4161
01:46:04,880 --> 01:46:05,713
when he said that,

4162
01:46:05,780 --> 01:46:06,980
he said something about sandy hook,

4163
01:46:06,981 --> 01:46:07,461
which again,

4164
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:08,510
I haven't seen the videos but they've,

4165
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:10,070
they've been sued.

4166
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:10,641
They said that.

4167
01:46:10,641 --> 01:46:11,270
He said,

4168
01:46:11,270 --> 01:46:12,103
daniel never happened.

4169
01:46:13,010 --> 01:46:13,550
So,

4170
01:46:13,550 --> 01:46:15,500
so what is fake news to be banned?

4171
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:16,790
While many people were saying,

4172
01:46:16,791 --> 01:46:17,091
yes,

4173
01:46:17,091 --> 01:46:18,320
facebook needs to ban a fake news.

4174
01:46:18,320 --> 01:46:19,280
But think about what that means.

4175
01:46:19,281 --> 01:46:20,390
It means you're not allowed to be wrong.

4176
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:21,171
Okay?

4177
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:23,240
Because fake news doesn't
mean you did it on purpose.

4178
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:24,313
More importantly,

4179
01:46:24,470 --> 01:46:25,370
you're not allowed to be stupid.

4180
01:46:25,810 --> 01:46:25,970
Well,

4181
01:46:25,970 --> 01:46:28,550
here's another thing
again in defense of alex,

4182
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:32,870
one thing that alex did
do is in the future after,

4183
01:46:32,871 --> 01:46:35,840
after he was done saying the things
that he said about sandy hook,

4184
01:46:35,841 --> 01:46:38,180
he then said it definitely happened.

4185
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:41,090
So he corrected his course and there's no.

4186
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:45,680
Is there a path for redemption when you
correct your course and if there's not,

4187
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:46,581
what are we doing?

4188
01:46:46,581 --> 01:46:48,320
Because we're not treating
people like human beings.

4189
01:46:48,321 --> 01:46:50,010
Then whether it's my

4190
01:46:50,010 --> 01:46:51,990
low or whether it's anybody.

4191
01:46:52,240 --> 01:46:53,073
I mean,

4192
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:58,080
I'm sorry to cut you off at the path
to redemption is so fucking critical.

4193
01:46:58,110 --> 01:46:58,860
Yes,

4194
01:46:58,860 --> 01:46:59,693
so let me tell you,

4195
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:00,753
I went to Sweden.

4196
01:47:01,980 --> 01:47:04,240
People were claiming things were
happening in Sweden a couple of years ago.

4197
01:47:04,241 --> 01:47:05,250
I decided to go check it out.

4198
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:08,220
For some reason a bunch of people
believe that I pushed them far right?

4199
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:10,950
Far right wing conspiracy
when I actually pushed him.

4200
01:47:11,410 --> 01:47:11,940
What was that?

4201
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:14,550
You pushed a conspiracy theory or theory.

4202
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:15,120
So,

4203
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:15,301
so,

4204
01:47:15,301 --> 01:47:15,690
so.

4205
01:47:15,690 --> 01:47:18,750
So basically you had Donald
Trump said last night in Sweden,

4206
01:47:19,230 --> 01:47:20,070
as soon as he says this,

4207
01:47:20,071 --> 01:47:20,940
the media goes wild.

4208
01:47:21,690 --> 01:47:24,810
My friend and I and my friend emily
who works with me on an off set,

4209
01:47:24,811 --> 01:47:25,290
we're like,

4210
01:47:25,290 --> 01:47:27,810
we should just go to Sweden and just
like walk around film stuff and make a

4211
01:47:27,811 --> 01:47:32,490
video about what we experienced was that
to go almost immediately it's reported.

4212
01:47:32,580 --> 01:47:33,413
We found nothing.

4213
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:35,160
We found the neighborhoods
were actually very nice,

4214
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,870
substantially nicer than chicago,

4215
01:47:36,871 --> 01:47:40,050
but we did find there was an increase in
crime is very tepid for some reason now

4216
01:47:40,051 --> 01:47:42,450
people are claiming that like I'm
pushing conspiracies or something.

4217
01:47:42,990 --> 01:47:43,801
I was going to go somewhere that,

4218
01:47:43,801 --> 01:47:45,180
but I kind of lost my train of thought.

4219
01:47:45,740 --> 01:47:46,320
Had a.

4220
01:47:46,320 --> 01:47:47,010
Oh,

4221
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:47,191
okay,

4222
01:47:47,191 --> 01:47:48,024
here we go.

4223
01:47:48,060 --> 01:47:48,893
When I was there,

4224
01:47:48,930 --> 01:47:50,730
joey salads is a big youtuber.

4225
01:47:51,330 --> 01:47:52,980
Reached out to me on twitter saying,

4226
01:47:52,981 --> 01:47:53,131
hey,

4227
01:47:53,131 --> 01:47:54,240
I'm here to let's meet up.

4228
01:47:54,540 --> 01:47:58,740
I got really angry because joey salads
made a video I think a couple years ago

4229
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:03,150
where he staged a bunch of black guys
destroying a car to make it seem like

4230
01:48:03,330 --> 01:48:03,751
these,

4231
01:48:03,751 --> 01:48:06,600
these neighborhoods where black people
were going to destroy trump car and it

4232
01:48:06,601 --> 01:48:06,901
was like,

4233
01:48:06,901 --> 01:48:08,340
it was very racist as awful.

4234
01:48:08,341 --> 01:48:09,174
Horrible.

4235
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:09,900
Yeah.

4236
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:13,530
He's a big youtuber and so he reached
out to me and I got really pissed.

4237
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:13,711
Like,

4238
01:48:13,711 --> 01:48:13,950
dude,

4239
01:48:13,950 --> 01:48:15,090
you're fake news.

4240
01:48:15,360 --> 01:48:16,440
You're a racist.

4241
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:17,251
And I was like,

4242
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:17,670
and I just,

4243
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:18,750
I started cussing at him.

4244
01:48:18,810 --> 01:48:20,820
I was like this and
that's not normal for me,

4245
01:48:20,821 --> 01:48:21,110
but that.

4246
01:48:21,110 --> 01:48:22,980
But afterwards I kind
of realized something.

4247
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:24,833
Joey made a mistake,

4248
01:48:25,830 --> 01:48:26,670
he reached out to me.

4249
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:27,510
It was polite.

4250
01:48:27,510 --> 01:48:28,260
He was honest.

4251
01:48:28,260 --> 01:48:29,100
I think he did something really,

4252
01:48:29,101 --> 01:48:29,934
really bad.

4253
01:48:30,090 --> 01:48:30,960
If I tell him,

4254
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,070
if I've cussed them out,

4255
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:33,210
if I just be mean to him,

4256
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:34,373
what's he going to do?

4257
01:48:34,620 --> 01:48:36,240
The Only people who will accept him.

4258
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:39,240
If the only people are going to be
nice to him or the actual racists will,

4259
01:48:39,241 --> 01:48:41,040
then he's going to go to the racists.

4260
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:42,630
He needs a path to redemption.

4261
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:42,900
So I.

4262
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:44,970
So I apologized and I said that was wrong.

4263
01:48:44,971 --> 01:48:45,804
I shouldn't have done that.

4264
01:48:46,110 --> 01:48:46,501
I should.

4265
01:48:46,501 --> 01:48:49,230
I should be willing to hear you out
and I should give you an opportunity to

4266
01:48:49,231 --> 01:48:49,920
better yourself.

4267
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:50,790
Otherwise you won't.

4268
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:52,680
And then I Met up with them
and talk to them and I.

4269
01:48:52,970 --> 01:48:54,630
And I think he made a huge mistake.

4270
01:48:54,870 --> 01:48:55,681
I think what he did was wrong.

4271
01:48:55,681 --> 01:48:56,790
I think it was self motivated.

4272
01:48:56,791 --> 01:48:57,960
I think it was money motivated,

4273
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,300
but I think none of that matters.

4274
01:49:00,301 --> 01:49:02,790
All that matters is you tell
them you do this one more time.

4275
01:49:02,930 --> 01:49:03,161
We're,

4276
01:49:03,161 --> 01:49:03,510
we're,

4277
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:04,343
you're out.

4278
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:05,280
You're out with the wolves.

4279
01:49:05,640 --> 01:49:06,091
But if you,

4280
01:49:06,091 --> 01:49:09,690
if you agree to do the right thing and
you're willing and you're sincere than.

4281
01:49:09,691 --> 01:49:10,524
Okay,

4282
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:11,413
good for you.

4283
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,830
I think that's got to be a
part of the conversation.

4284
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:14,340
Yeah,

4285
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,173
I mean we,

4286
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:18,600
I think this idea of just
banning people for life,

4287
01:49:18,750 --> 01:49:23,340
but letting people out of jail after
they commit murder and they can reenter

4288
01:49:23,341 --> 01:49:24,174
society.

4289
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:25,860
I mean it's still as hard
for them for a long time.

4290
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:26,670
Like exxon show,

4291
01:49:26,670 --> 01:49:27,391
it's not easy,

4292
01:49:27,391 --> 01:49:29,880
but they're saying that
there's a path to redemption.

4293
01:49:29,940 --> 01:49:32,540
But what ends up happening is
they create parallel economies.

4294
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:35,880
They create parallel networks
and that causes more division,

4295
01:49:35,881 --> 01:49:36,714
more anxiety.

4296
01:49:37,270 --> 01:49:37,860
Like you see,

4297
01:49:37,860 --> 01:49:40,810
you see these alternative social networks
emerge because People get banned.

4298
01:49:40,811 --> 01:49:41,850
So they all moved to one place.

4299
01:49:41,851 --> 01:49:42,810
This is back to gab.

4300
01:49:43,130 --> 01:49:43,550
Yeah.

4301
01:49:43,550 --> 01:49:43,920
Yeah.

4302
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:44,640
So,

4303
01:49:44,640 --> 01:49:45,091
but you know,

4304
01:49:45,091 --> 01:49:47,530
I think gab is mostly gotta be honest.

4305
01:49:47,531 --> 01:49:48,070
I don't surf

4306
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,730
gab.

4307
01:49:48,730 --> 01:49:49,460
I've read what they've,

4308
01:49:49,460 --> 01:49:50,230
people have said about it,

4309
01:49:50,230 --> 01:49:52,960
but at this point I don't
trust a lot of the media.

4310
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:53,740
I don't.

4311
01:49:53,740 --> 01:49:54,760
And that's not unique for me.

4312
01:49:54,761 --> 01:49:57,820
Most americans have unfavorable
gab or you mean everything,

4313
01:49:57,880 --> 01:50:00,060
what they've said about
gab and everything,

4314
01:50:00,260 --> 01:50:00,431
right?

4315
01:50:00,431 --> 01:50:00,790
I mean,

4316
01:50:00,790 --> 01:50:02,240
what's your opinion of gay?

4317
01:50:02,360 --> 01:50:03,170
I mean,

4318
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:04,870
you don't have like a clear opinion of it.

4319
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,810
My opinion of gab is that they do allow.

4320
01:50:08,150 --> 01:50:11,610
There's a lot more people with extreme
views simply because it's illegal.

4321
01:50:11,670 --> 01:50:11,920
right?

4322
01:50:11,920 --> 01:50:12,880
So they go there naturally,

4323
01:50:13,420 --> 01:50:17,140
but based on what I've read about
it from like actual reports,

4324
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,270
it's not substantially worse than twitter,

4325
01:50:19,570 --> 01:50:21,970
but it does allow them
as a big difference,

4326
01:50:21,971 --> 01:50:22,200
right?

4327
01:50:22,200 --> 01:50:22,550
Yes.

4328
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:23,620
You can go on twitter,

4329
01:50:23,650 --> 01:50:24,620
you can get away with it for awhile.

4330
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:25,030
Gab,

4331
01:50:25,030 --> 01:50:28,480
you just go on gab and save a bunch of
crazy stuff and unless you break the law,

4332
01:50:28,840 --> 01:50:31,690
there have been accusations leveled
against gap that they've actually dragged

4333
01:50:31,691 --> 01:50:34,360
their feet on getting rid of illegal
things like calls for violence,

4334
01:50:34,690 --> 01:50:35,523
you know,

4335
01:50:35,800 --> 01:50:39,750
but for the most part some things that
you cAn get kicked off or like doxing

4336
01:50:39,890 --> 01:50:40,590
and.

4337
01:50:40,590 --> 01:50:40,850
Yeah,

4338
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:42,910
so that it's not the wild west,

4339
01:50:42,911 --> 01:50:44,320
but it's wilder.

4340
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:44,801
But you know,

4341
01:50:44,801 --> 01:50:45,350
what the media,

4342
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:46,041
these people and,

4343
01:50:46,041 --> 01:50:46,171
and,

4344
01:50:46,171 --> 01:50:47,080
and I want to say the media,

4345
01:50:47,081 --> 01:50:50,410
I specifically mean these digital New
York based outlets for the most part,

4346
01:50:51,010 --> 01:50:52,480
they like to say things like,

4347
01:50:52,481 --> 01:50:52,631
you know,

4348
01:50:52,631 --> 01:50:53,920
that guy who shot up at synagogue,

4349
01:50:54,400 --> 01:50:55,120
horrible,

4350
01:50:55,120 --> 01:50:55,953
just disgusting.

4351
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:57,490
But they say gab user.

4352
01:50:57,880 --> 01:50:58,121
So,

4353
01:50:58,121 --> 01:50:59,080
and so a gab user.

4354
01:50:59,440 --> 01:50:59,910
He was,

4355
01:50:59,910 --> 01:51:00,760
he was a twitter user,

4356
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:01,210
right?

4357
01:51:01,210 --> 01:51:01,870
It was oN twitter,

4358
01:51:01,870 --> 01:51:02,703
drank water.

4359
01:51:02,780 --> 01:51:03,510
He drank water.

4360
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:03,850
Yeah.

4361
01:51:03,850 --> 01:51:04,060
You know,

4362
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:04,893
who else drInk water?

4363
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:05,920
Hitler.

4364
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:06,370
Hitler.

4365
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:06,820
Yep.

4366
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:07,653
Boom.

4367
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:08,553
There it is.

4368
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,021
But it's,

4369
01:51:09,021 --> 01:51:09,231
it's,

4370
01:51:09,231 --> 01:51:09,441
it's,

4371
01:51:09,441 --> 01:51:10,001
it's crazy.

4372
01:51:10,001 --> 01:51:10,271
It's like,

4373
01:51:10,271 --> 01:51:11,104
come on man.

4374
01:51:11,190 --> 01:51:11,830
You know?

4375
01:51:11,830 --> 01:51:12,240
Um,

4376
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:12,510
but I,

4377
01:51:12,510 --> 01:51:14,020
but I will recognize right now that,

4378
01:51:14,170 --> 01:51:14,680
uh,

4379
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,180
at this point gab is,

4380
01:51:16,240 --> 01:51:16,720
it's,

4381
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:17,260
yeah,

4382
01:51:17,260 --> 01:51:18,250
if you're going to go on there,

4383
01:51:18,251 --> 01:51:21,280
the media is going to accuse you
of every single name of the book.

4384
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:22,283
I'm Sure you got to,

4385
01:51:22,300 --> 01:51:22,970
you know.

4386
01:51:22,970 --> 01:51:24,910
So I've had conversations
with people in here will,

4387
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:27,490
they'll just immediately
started throwing out these,

4388
01:51:27,790 --> 01:51:31,030
these descriptions of what gab
is and what cab stands for.

4389
01:51:31,031 --> 01:51:31,310
And like,

4390
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:31,950
okay.

4391
01:51:31,950 --> 01:51:32,160
I mean,

4392
01:51:32,160 --> 01:51:33,060
I had with barry weiss,

4393
01:51:33,070 --> 01:51:33,590
I was like,

4394
01:51:33,590 --> 01:51:34,181
I was going to say,

4395
01:51:34,181 --> 01:51:35,020
and some politicians.

4396
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:37,240
That waS a woof.

4397
01:51:37,850 --> 01:51:38,310
that's all.

4398
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:39,340
Just say woof woof.

4399
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:43,300
Which part of the tulsi gabard toady?

4400
01:51:43,390 --> 01:51:43,560
I,

4401
01:51:43,560 --> 01:51:44,081
I,

4402
01:51:44,081 --> 01:51:44,400
you know,

4403
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,233
I.

4404
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:47,950
Did you see what I'm jimmy?

4405
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:48,311
Yeah,

4406
01:51:48,311 --> 01:51:49,121
jimmy did about it.

4407
01:51:49,121 --> 01:51:50,690
I was laughing the whole
time with jimmy dore.

4408
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:51,783
Jimmy dore.

4409
01:51:52,010 --> 01:51:52,843
Fucking.

4410
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:54,070
He's fucking great.

4411
01:51:54,890 --> 01:51:56,860
And the way he did it in
front of a live crowd.

4412
01:51:56,861 --> 01:51:57,070
Yeah.

4413
01:51:57,070 --> 01:51:57,401
Yeah.

4414
01:51:57,401 --> 01:51:57,611
And,

4415
01:51:57,611 --> 01:51:57,851
and,

4416
01:51:57,851 --> 01:51:58,061
but,

4417
01:51:58,061 --> 01:51:58,840
but here's the thing,

4418
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:03,670
I got to say like I'm sorry to bury it
really did sound like you didn't even

4419
01:52:03,671 --> 01:52:04,504
know what the word meant.

4420
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:05,050
Yeah.

4421
01:52:05,050 --> 01:52:05,950
Because if you say,

4422
01:52:05,951 --> 01:52:06,610
what does that word mean?

4423
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:07,630
I'll tell you what I think it means.

4424
01:52:07,631 --> 01:52:09,970
I won't ask someone to
check the feed first.

4425
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:10,610
Right.

4426
01:52:10,610 --> 01:52:11,443
So it's like.

4427
01:52:12,460 --> 01:52:13,121
And she also,

4428
01:52:13,121 --> 01:52:17,020
she's also been a drag because she did
a story where she used a satire tweet

4429
01:52:17,050 --> 01:52:18,250
from antifa or something.

4430
01:52:18,251 --> 01:52:19,720
I don't necessarily.

4431
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:21,310
So she's had her share,

4432
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:22,300
but you know,

4433
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:22,650
I don't know.

4434
01:52:22,650 --> 01:52:24,370
She's been busted doing that too.

4435
01:52:24,670 --> 01:52:29,020
She's got caught with the antifa

4436
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,740
antifa post on a wall that was like,

4437
01:52:32,890 --> 01:52:33,281
oh really?

4438
01:52:33,281 --> 01:52:34,114
It was a troll,

4439
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:34,750
somebody,

4440
01:52:34,750 --> 01:52:35,590
somebody told it,

4441
01:52:35,710 --> 01:52:36,543
but you know,

4442
01:52:36,690 --> 01:52:40,240
that's what's so crazy is that
things are so fucking blurry.

4443
01:52:40,450 --> 01:52:42,370
It's hard to see the troll sometimes.

4444
01:52:42,550 --> 01:52:43,330
Oh yeah.

4445
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:44,800
And so there in lies the big problem.

4446
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:45,140
I mean,

4447
01:52:45,140 --> 01:52:46,040
my brother might be

4448
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:48,770
one of the most notorious,

4449
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:50,660
not notorious the wrong word because he,

4450
01:52:50,661 --> 01:52:52,040
he like of hides in the shadows,

4451
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:53,210
but he's done some.

4452
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:55,620
My brother cloned a while,

4453
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:56,570
I can't remember which website.

4454
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:58,190
He cloned a website,

4455
01:52:58,760 --> 01:52:59,001
right?

4456
01:52:59,001 --> 01:53:00,410
The actually the yes
man recently did this.

4457
01:53:00,411 --> 01:53:05,090
Well we can post copied perfectly and he
wrote an article about how a new strain

4458
01:53:05,091 --> 01:53:06,230
of marijuana was discovered.

4459
01:53:06,231 --> 01:53:06,680
Cannabis,

4460
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:07,513
australia's.

4461
01:53:08,270 --> 01:53:11,720
He said that he was the dean
at the university of sydney
or something like that.

4462
01:53:11,750 --> 01:53:13,640
Who was dating popstar meghan trainor,

4463
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:16,760
just the most ridiculous
thing and that he said,

4464
01:53:16,761 --> 01:53:18,560
we need to find a female plant.

4465
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:19,640
So far this what we have.

4466
01:53:19,641 --> 01:53:20,540
It's groundbreaking.

4467
01:53:21,170 --> 01:53:22,240
It's so,

4468
01:53:22,290 --> 01:53:23,123
so he did this very,

4469
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,113
very clever thing.

4470
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:29,350
He bought a domain name that was
something like calm-guest.info.

4471
01:53:29,930 --> 01:53:30,763
That's the url.

4472
01:53:31,340 --> 01:53:32,540
He then created a subdomain.

4473
01:53:32,840 --> 01:53:33,591
So it's like,

4474
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:33,861
you know,

4475
01:53:33,861 --> 01:53:35,750
just hypothetically cnn.com,

4476
01:53:35,810 --> 01:53:36,643
dasha gassed,

4477
01:53:36,860 --> 01:53:38,420
the average person just see cnn.com.

4478
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:39,740
They assume It's real.

4479
01:53:40,220 --> 01:53:41,300
I don't know how he shared it,

4480
01:53:41,301 --> 01:53:42,320
but he makes this whole.

4481
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:43,340
It's so ridiculous,

4482
01:53:43,341 --> 01:53:43,491
man.

4483
01:53:43,491 --> 01:53:44,930
I got to say if you thought it was real.

4484
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:47,810
I got a bridge cellular
high times picked it up.

4485
01:53:48,530 --> 01:53:50,300
It got 50,000 shares,

4486
01:53:50,330 --> 01:53:51,163
breakthrough,

4487
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:52,290
new strain of marijuana.

4488
01:53:52,291 --> 01:53:52,640
Discovered.

4489
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,960
My brother was just
laughing the whole time.

4490
01:53:54,140 --> 01:53:54,980
And I was like,

4491
01:53:55,220 --> 01:53:56,053
what did you do?

4492
01:53:56,150 --> 01:53:57,210
Like my brothers,

4493
01:53:57,230 --> 01:53:58,063
like my opposite,

4494
01:53:58,190 --> 01:53:58,431
you know,

4495
01:53:58,431 --> 01:53:58,590
I,

4496
01:53:58,590 --> 01:54:00,620
I try to be honest to
the best of my ability.

4497
01:54:00,890 --> 01:54:01,090
I,

4498
01:54:01,090 --> 01:54:01,460
you can,

4499
01:54:01,460 --> 01:54:01,940
you know,

4500
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:02,340
I think,

4501
01:54:02,340 --> 01:54:02,570
you know,

4502
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:03,620
people accused me of being a liar.

4503
01:54:03,621 --> 01:54:04,161
That's not fair.

4504
01:54:04,161 --> 01:54:05,450
I could be wrong for sure,

4505
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:07,220
but I try my best to be rational.

4506
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:10,760
My brother on the other
hand is like editing videos,

4507
01:54:10,761 --> 01:54:11,990
making them ridiculous as possible.

4508
01:54:11,991 --> 01:54:13,340
He made another video where,

4509
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:16,040
and it's crazy because he
tries to make sure people.

4510
01:54:16,240 --> 01:54:17,270
It's over the top.

4511
01:54:17,660 --> 01:54:20,690
He made a video where it's
a van getting pulled over.

4512
01:54:20,840 --> 01:54:25,010
It looks like a police dash cam and
then the cop walks up to the car,

4513
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:26,360
checks the guys licensed,

4514
01:54:26,361 --> 01:54:26,930
walks back,

4515
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:30,090
and the driver releases pot on
a balloon and then an airport,

4516
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:31,070
so it saying stash,

4517
01:54:31,160 --> 01:54:33,100
like he's disposing ms
drugs with helium balloons,

4518
01:54:33,101 --> 01:54:35,870
so they fly away and then
the cop runs up firing guns,

4519
01:54:35,871 --> 01:54:36,770
edit this thing,

4520
01:54:36,771 --> 01:54:38,030
got hundreds of millions of views.

4521
01:54:38,210 --> 01:54:39,740
It was on facebook every other day.

4522
01:54:39,741 --> 01:54:40,550
It's.

4523
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:44,720
It was like he made it four years ago
or something and I saw it on instagram

4524
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:46,100
like two weeks ago and I was like,

4525
01:54:46,101 --> 01:54:46,341
dude.

4526
01:54:46,341 --> 01:54:47,174
And I showed him.

4527
01:54:47,210 --> 01:54:48,140
People think it's real.

4528
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:49,161
Like it's,

4529
01:54:49,161 --> 01:54:50,180
it's the craziest,

4530
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:51,210
but he,

4531
01:54:51,500 --> 01:54:52,240
you know.

4532
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:52,490
Yeah,

4533
01:54:52,490 --> 01:54:52,940
I dunno.

4534
01:54:52,940 --> 01:54:53,241
So,

4535
01:54:53,241 --> 01:54:55,700
so much fucked up stuff that is real.

4536
01:54:55,701 --> 01:54:57,830
It's so hard to differentiate what I mean.

4537
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,570
Hold on.

4538
01:54:58,570 --> 01:54:58,941
Like let's,

4539
01:54:58,941 --> 01:55:00,290
let's throw some shade at high times.

4540
01:55:00,290 --> 01:55:01,370
Like when they did this,

4541
01:55:02,230 --> 01:55:03,380
they said they,

4542
01:55:03,410 --> 01:55:05,000
when they corrected the article
and saying it was a hoax,

4543
01:55:05,001 --> 01:55:07,610
they said we wanted to
call for verification,

4544
01:55:07,611 --> 01:55:09,530
but we thought the story
was too hot to pass up.

4545
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,510
That's a really good example,

4546
01:55:11,690 --> 01:55:13,160
but that's a really good
example of covington.

4547
01:55:13,161 --> 01:55:15,500
It's a really good example of
what these news organizations do.

4548
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:17,060
It's high times.

4549
01:55:17,061 --> 01:55:18,340
There were probably barbecue,

4550
01:55:18,360 --> 01:55:20,240
that mother fucking mind
when they wrote that,

4551
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:21,730
and I say like,

4552
01:55:21,770 --> 01:55:22,280
they're not,

4553
01:55:22,280 --> 01:55:22,911
they're not the,

4554
01:55:22,911 --> 01:55:23,101
uh,

4555
01:55:23,101 --> 01:55:24,470
the bastions of great journalism.

4556
01:55:24,471 --> 01:55:26,900
We don't hold high times on a
pedestal next to the New York times.

4557
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:29,390
Not to be disrespectful and
I respect the publication,

4558
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:31,430
but the New York times
is the paper of record.

4559
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:31,910
Yes.

4560
01:55:31,910 --> 01:55:32,630
At the same time,

4561
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:35,330
if it's your job and you're
writing stories on a specialty,

4562
01:55:35,331 --> 01:55:35,511
like,

4563
01:55:35,511 --> 01:55:36,280
come on man,

4564
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:36,861
but look,

4565
01:55:36,861 --> 01:55:37,460
this is,

4566
01:55:37,460 --> 01:55:38,190
this is,

4567
01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:38,820
uh,

4568
01:55:38,820 --> 01:55:39,140
there's,

4569
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:41,810
there's two big things that affect
media that I think are worrisome.

4570
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:45,240
Covington exemplifies really
well that people just wrote,

4571
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:47,810
they didn't do any research
at all and it was all,

4572
01:55:47,880 --> 01:55:48,713
it was all wrong.

4573
01:55:48,810 --> 01:55:51,270
Then even watch the videos because
you can see in the first video,

4574
01:55:51,300 --> 01:55:52,110
not only that,

4575
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:56,160
but what's even more egregious as they
did this several days right afterwards

4576
01:55:56,161 --> 01:55:57,780
and they were still like
the bill maher thing.

4577
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:58,510
Yeah.

4578
01:55:58,510 --> 01:55:59,760
It's very unfortunate.

4579
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:03,930
But then it's all avoidable if you're
going to discuss something and you're

4580
01:56:03,931 --> 01:56:07,770
going to do it in a public forum like
that and you know about it in advance.

4581
01:56:07,771 --> 01:56:10,570
This is not like you're on a
podcast ad libbing and you,

4582
01:56:10,590 --> 01:56:11,890
you say something and you mistake.

4583
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:13,530
This is something that's planned.

4584
01:56:13,770 --> 01:56:17,190
The other thing that worries
me greatly is what we see with,

4585
01:56:17,850 --> 01:56:18,200
with,

4586
01:56:18,200 --> 01:56:18,390
uh,

4587
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,021
learn to code,

4588
01:56:19,021 --> 01:56:19,590
right?

4589
01:56:19,590 --> 01:56:22,170
so this nbc reporter is,

4590
01:56:22,171 --> 01:56:25,080
he goes on this big twitter thread
about how twitter needs to take action

4591
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:26,580
against these harassment campaigns.

4592
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:27,450
And they refuSed to do it.

4593
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:31,890
The next day he writes an article
citing an activist about how,

4594
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:32,041
uh,

4595
01:56:32,041 --> 01:56:35,000
far right campaign and sending death
threats to journalists and twitters and

4596
01:56:35,001 --> 01:56:35,834
doing anything about it.

4597
01:56:36,180 --> 01:56:40,110
And after that he starts posting about
how he's getting death threats adapter

4598
01:56:40,111 --> 01:56:42,030
that twitter announces
they'll take action.

4599
01:56:42,450 --> 01:56:43,410
So what do we see here?

4600
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,120
This guy called fraction,

4601
01:56:45,180 --> 01:56:46,013
couldn't get it done,

4602
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:47,100
wrote an article,

4603
01:56:47,130 --> 01:56:49,980
slanting it as a far right
campaign against journalists.

4604
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:51,420
Twitter decides to take action.

4605
01:56:51,450 --> 01:56:52,830
Now people are getting
banned for tweeting.

4606
01:56:52,831 --> 01:56:53,660
Learn to code.

4607
01:56:53,660 --> 01:56:56,400
This is people do think or
making these critical decisions.

4608
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:57,720
I think it's a handful.

4609
01:56:57,750 --> 01:56:57,961
I mean,

4610
01:56:57,961 --> 01:56:59,850
I can't imagine twitter's
got a massive staff,

4611
01:57:00,210 --> 01:57:03,690
but like when you think
they have a huge staff,

4612
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:03,960
what?

4613
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:04,793
Couple hundred?

4614
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:10,530
There's a hundred offices and
roughly 3,500 employees at those.

4615
01:57:10,830 --> 01:57:10,981
Oh,

4616
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:11,251
okay.

4617
01:57:11,251 --> 01:57:12,180
So way more than I thought that was.

4618
01:57:12,330 --> 01:57:12,661
Yeah,

4619
01:57:12,661 --> 01:57:14,100
that's what I was 35 offices.

4620
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:17,100
How many of those people are
operating in the bubble during.

4621
01:57:17,101 --> 01:57:18,540
In an ideological bubble,

4622
01:57:18,570 --> 01:57:19,403
but it's not just that,

4623
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:20,250
you know,

4624
01:57:20,250 --> 01:57:21,180
you band kathy griffin,

4625
01:57:21,181 --> 01:57:22,710
she's a celebrity with
millions of followers.

4626
01:57:23,340 --> 01:57:24,480
They don't care about Alex Jones.

4627
01:57:24,600 --> 01:57:25,710
Alex jones sell supplements.

4628
01:57:25,890 --> 01:57:26,640
Right.

4629
01:57:26,640 --> 01:57:27,271
It's complicated.

4630
01:57:27,271 --> 01:57:27,481
I mean,

4631
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:29,310
I can't really understand why he's.

4632
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:30,713
Well,

4633
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,700
he's more polarizing,

4634
01:57:32,701 --> 01:57:34,020
but he's also very famous.

4635
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:34,231
Oh,

4636
01:57:34,231 --> 01:57:34,501
come on.

4637
01:57:34,501 --> 01:57:36,300
kathy griffin showed a photo
of Donald Trump with this,

4638
01:57:36,330 --> 01:57:36,750
you know,

4639
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:37,650
with his head cut off,

4640
01:57:37,651 --> 01:57:38,090
which is even,

4641
01:57:38,090 --> 01:57:38,260
you know,

4642
01:57:38,260 --> 01:57:39,630
aren't so unless something really crazy.

4643
01:57:40,110 --> 01:57:43,320
The guy who wrote all
the articles demanding,

4644
01:57:43,370 --> 01:57:45,090
I don't to say demand
and that's maybe unfair.

4645
01:57:45,720 --> 01:57:49,740
Oliver darcy goes on cnn and says it
was media pressure that got jones' band.

4646
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:51,120
He's the guy who
repeatedly wrote about it.

4647
01:57:51,121 --> 01:57:51,541
He was the guy.

4648
01:57:51,541 --> 01:57:52,590
Jones confronted about it.

4649
01:57:52,700 --> 01:57:53,100
Yes.

4650
01:57:53,100 --> 01:57:57,330
Oliver darcy interviewed me in 2016
about a video I made where I said it's.

4651
01:57:57,360 --> 01:58:00,810
It's worrisome that twitter is banning
people for their political ideologies.

4652
01:58:01,350 --> 01:58:02,550
Oliver darcy inter,

4653
01:58:02,580 --> 01:58:02,800
he,

4654
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,810
I don't know if you interviewed me,

4655
01:58:03,811 --> 01:58:07,950
but he wrote an article about my video
and this is a journalist at business

4656
01:58:07,951 --> 01:58:08,910
insider who says,

4657
01:58:08,940 --> 01:58:09,031
oh,

4658
01:58:09,031 --> 01:58:09,900
that's a really interesting thing.

4659
01:58:09,901 --> 01:58:10,040
Tim,

4660
01:58:10,040 --> 01:58:11,670
let me write about your
take on what's happening.

4661
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:13,620
And then two years later is,

4662
01:58:13,770 --> 01:58:16,230
is talking about how his media
pressure got jones' band.

4663
01:58:16,231 --> 01:58:17,550
It's like a weird one 80,

4664
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:18,390
you know?

4665
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:19,110
Wow.

4666
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:19,920
Yeah.

4667
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:22,020
So I'm not trying to be
disrespectful to him because I,

4668
01:58:22,050 --> 01:58:22,330
you know,

4669
01:58:22,330 --> 01:58:23,760
I know I'm somewhat in passing,

4670
01:58:23,761 --> 01:58:27,420
but I will say there's a certain point
where I think it's unfair to accuse a

4671
01:58:27,421 --> 01:58:29,910
journalist of advocating for
something simply for covering it.

4672
01:58:30,570 --> 01:58:34,620
But then he went on cnn And said it was
media pressure that got him banned and

4673
01:58:34,621 --> 01:58:35,071
I'm kinda like,

4674
01:58:35,071 --> 01:58:35,281
okay.

4675
01:58:35,281 --> 01:58:37,890
You have to realize at that point
you were the one who led that charge.

4676
01:58:38,160 --> 01:58:38,993
You know,

4677
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:40,370
and you know,

4678
01:58:40,650 --> 01:58:40,990
I don't,

4679
01:58:40,990 --> 01:58:42,280
I don't care if you like them or not.

4680
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:44,980
Banningham for for dubious reasons,

4681
01:58:44,981 --> 01:58:46,330
just creates huge problems.

4682
01:58:46,331 --> 01:58:47,410
It shows your bias,

4683
01:58:47,890 --> 01:58:49,300
but just saying it that way too.

4684
01:58:49,301 --> 01:58:50,830
It's like when hunter s thompson,

4685
01:58:51,100 --> 01:58:56,100
I'm spread the rumor about ed muskie
being on ibogaine and then he went on the

4686
01:58:56,501 --> 01:58:57,400
dick cavett show.

4687
01:58:57,401 --> 01:58:58,690
It's hilarious clip.

4688
01:58:59,050 --> 01:59:00,310
And he goes,

4689
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:02,410
well actually there was a rumor,

4690
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:04,470
there was a rumor about him being on.

4691
01:59:04,490 --> 01:59:05,320
I began to,

4692
01:59:05,320 --> 01:59:09,030
I know because I started
the rumor and you know,

4693
01:59:09,450 --> 01:59:09,700
I mean,

4694
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:10,391
that's exactly,

4695
01:59:10,391 --> 01:59:11,740
that's kind of the same thing.

4696
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:13,023
It's like,

4697
01:59:13,330 --> 01:59:13,601
yeah,

4698
01:59:13,601 --> 01:59:13,801
you,

4699
01:59:13,801 --> 01:59:14,634
you caused it.

4700
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:15,340
Yeah,

4701
01:59:15,340 --> 01:59:15,520
yeah,

4702
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:16,060
yeah.

4703
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:17,330
You spread the rumor but that.

4704
01:59:17,440 --> 01:59:20,860
But there's another thing
too is I'm patrion band,

4705
01:59:20,861 --> 01:59:21,694
lauren southern,

4706
01:59:21,830 --> 01:59:22,900
I think it was like a year and a half,

4707
01:59:22,901 --> 01:59:23,734
two years ago.

4708
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:26,270
And when she got banned it,

4709
01:59:26,350 --> 01:59:27,280
I don't know if you know what happened,

4710
01:59:27,281 --> 01:59:27,680
but she,

4711
01:59:27,680 --> 01:59:29,200
she went in the boat in the mediterranean.

4712
01:59:29,230 --> 01:59:30,160
And what was that?

4713
01:59:30,190 --> 01:59:31,840
She did something with the migrants.

4714
01:59:31,930 --> 01:59:32,260
She did,

4715
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:33,760
she did a protest action with,

4716
01:59:33,761 --> 01:59:35,320
I believe it was generation identity,

4717
01:59:35,410 --> 01:59:36,131
which are,

4718
01:59:36,131 --> 01:59:36,700
um,

4719
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:38,020
I don't know how to describe them because,

4720
01:59:38,050 --> 01:59:38,291
you know,

4721
01:59:38,291 --> 01:59:39,490
people like to throw labels around,

4722
01:59:39,491 --> 01:59:43,220
but they're like a european
nationalists and I,

4723
01:59:43,250 --> 01:59:45,310
I know people have called
them white nationalists,

4724
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:45,581
but again,

4725
01:59:45,581 --> 01:59:46,710
I don't know enough about their group,

4726
01:59:46,711 --> 01:59:47,990
so I think it's fair to say that that's,

4727
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:49,030
that might be the case.

4728
01:59:49,060 --> 01:59:50,800
Forgive me for being
ignorant for the most part,

4729
01:59:50,801 --> 01:59:51,461
but their ideology,

4730
01:59:51,461 --> 01:59:52,600
I know people are going to tear me apart.

4731
01:59:53,170 --> 01:59:54,003
She gets in a boat,

4732
01:59:54,610 --> 01:59:55,760
they go up to one of these.

4733
01:59:55,761 --> 01:59:55,930
My,

4734
01:59:55,930 --> 01:59:56,140
uh,

4735
01:59:56,140 --> 01:59:58,330
one of these migrant vessels that does,

4736
01:59:58,331 --> 01:59:58,570
uh,

4737
01:59:58,570 --> 01:59:58,770
they,

4738
01:59:58,770 --> 01:59:59,010
they,

4739
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:00,580
they say it's a search and rescue vehicle,

4740
02:00:00,581 --> 02:00:00,920
but this,

4741
02:00:00,920 --> 02:00:05,110
that's been a point of a debate and she
like waves a flyer in the air and then

4742
02:00:05,111 --> 02:00:05,350
she,

4743
02:00:05,350 --> 02:00:06,580
she says on the stream,

4744
02:00:06,590 --> 02:00:07,421
like get in front of them,

4745
02:00:07,421 --> 02:00:08,080
get in front of him.

4746
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,620
But I believe she never did jack
connie banter and there are like,

4747
02:00:11,621 --> 02:00:13,150
what you're doing may
have caused loss of life,

4748
02:00:13,160 --> 02:00:13,993
your band.

4749
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:17,770
A lot of people then started to point
out that there's a website called it's

4750
02:00:17,771 --> 02:00:19,480
going down and this is a,

4751
02:00:19,481 --> 02:00:19,900
you know,

4752
02:00:19,900 --> 02:00:20,770
consider to be far left.

4753
02:00:20,771 --> 02:00:21,604
Extremists site.

4754
02:00:21,610 --> 02:00:25,750
One of the articles was teaching people
or advocating for pouring concrete on

4755
02:00:25,751 --> 02:00:28,330
train tracks to disrupt,

4756
02:00:28,360 --> 02:00:31,090
derail the strains can cause loss of life.

4757
02:00:31,630 --> 02:00:32,110
So jack,

4758
02:00:32,110 --> 02:00:34,630
so I saw this and I thought
this is really fascinating.

4759
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:37,840
I'd like to know why patrion band
southern and why they don't take action in

4760
02:00:37,841 --> 02:00:38,674
this regard.

4761
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:39,720
I reached out to jack conti.

4762
02:00:39,721 --> 02:00:40,201
I tweeted at him,

4763
02:00:40,201 --> 02:00:40,550
he said he'd,

4764
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:40,751
he'd,

4765
02:00:40,751 --> 02:00:42,520
he'd call me on the phone and I said,

4766
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:42,760
you know,

4767
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:43,670
I'd like to understand your,

4768
02:00:43,671 --> 02:00:43,910
your,

4769
02:00:43,910 --> 02:00:44,180
your,

4770
02:00:44,180 --> 02:00:45,011
your decision making,

4771
02:00:45,011 --> 02:00:45,844
how this came to be,

4772
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,230
what brought you to the
attention of lauren,

4773
02:00:47,231 --> 02:00:48,040
what about this?

4774
02:00:48,040 --> 02:00:48,761
He ended up banning,

4775
02:00:48,761 --> 02:00:53,761
iT's going down and then they wrote an
article titled tim pool and the alt right

4776
02:00:53,950 --> 02:00:54,510
get,

4777
02:00:54,510 --> 02:00:54,830
you know,

4778
02:00:54,830 --> 02:00:56,560
it's going down band
from patron or something.

4779
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:57,810
And that's been cited.

4780
02:00:57,860 --> 02:01:00,580
Jimmy dore had it on his show
and a bunch of other like,

4781
02:01:00,590 --> 02:01:00,980
just,

4782
02:01:00,980 --> 02:01:01,290
you know,

4783
02:01:01,290 --> 02:01:02,140
temple's not outright.

4784
02:01:02,320 --> 02:01:02,921
And I said,

4785
02:01:02,921 --> 02:01:03,754
listen man,

4786
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:05,590
I didn't advocate for them to be banned.

4787
02:01:06,190 --> 02:01:07,360
I don't want anyone band,

4788
02:01:07,870 --> 02:01:08,380
right?

4789
02:01:08,380 --> 02:01:11,380
I just want to know what their decision
making process was and this was the

4790
02:01:11,410 --> 02:01:13,720
thing that was going viral among
people on twitter who are or,

4791
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:14,020
you know,

4792
02:01:14,020 --> 02:01:14,860
asking about this.

4793
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:19,580
And so now I get accused of
campaigning to get them back just like,

4794
02:01:19,660 --> 02:01:19,900
you know,

4795
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:20,830
I live for darcy was with,

4796
02:01:20,831 --> 02:01:21,100
with,

4797
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:21,910
with um,

4798
02:01:21,910 --> 02:01:22,743
with jones,

4799
02:01:23,290 --> 02:01:24,510
but a well,

4800
02:01:24,520 --> 02:01:27,850
and then immediately they slapped
that distinction on you as soon as.

4801
02:01:27,910 --> 02:01:29,820
I mean just calling someone outright to.

4802
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:31,030
It's so strange how,

4803
02:01:31,420 --> 02:01:31,721
you know,

4804
02:01:31,721 --> 02:01:32,501
I don't know if you know,

4805
02:01:32,501 --> 02:01:37,501
but all in the world of standup
comedy used to be progressive liberal,

4806
02:01:37,700 --> 02:01:38,380
like,

4807
02:01:38,380 --> 02:01:40,790
like weird coffee shop type rooms.

4808
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:42,260
It was all comedy.

4809
02:01:42,410 --> 02:01:45,590
They don't even use that term
anymore because it's so toxic.

4810
02:01:45,650 --> 02:01:48,140
And I try to avoid saying I'll use
the alternative media all the time.

4811
02:01:48,170 --> 02:01:51,230
And this has happened over the
course of just a couple of years.

4812
02:01:51,231 --> 02:01:51,690
I mean,

4813
02:01:51,690 --> 02:01:56,420
the thing is shifted and it's moving
and evolving and morphing so quickly.

4814
02:01:56,480 --> 02:02:01,070
You want to know what's really crazy for
years on my wikipedia page at claimed

4815
02:02:01,071 --> 02:02:02,240
that I invented a zipline.

4816
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:05,060
Zipline like a blimp.

4817
02:02:05,090 --> 02:02:05,923
Yes.

4818
02:02:06,620 --> 02:02:07,160
Yeah.

4819
02:02:07,160 --> 02:02:07,611
It's funny,

4820
02:02:07,611 --> 02:02:07,880
right?

4821
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:08,061
Well,

4822
02:02:08,061 --> 02:02:11,200
wikipedia said I was Brian
Collins brother for decades.

4823
02:02:11,480 --> 02:02:11,690
Here's,

4824
02:02:11,690 --> 02:02:12,523
here's the thing.

4825
02:02:12,770 --> 02:02:13,730
When I went to Sweden,

4826
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:15,470
I specifically stated,

4827
02:02:16,040 --> 02:02:16,510
uh,

4828
02:02:16,510 --> 02:02:16,751
let me,

4829
02:02:16,751 --> 02:02:16,890
let,

4830
02:02:16,890 --> 02:02:16,981
let,

4831
02:02:16,981 --> 02:02:17,110
let,

4832
02:02:17,110 --> 02:02:17,201
let,

4833
02:02:17,201 --> 02:02:17,691
let me back up.

4834
02:02:17,691 --> 02:02:20,570
Paul Joseph Watson of info
wars put out a call saying,

4835
02:02:20,571 --> 02:02:23,960
I challenge any journalists to spend
a weekend in malmo and I'll cover your

4836
02:02:23,961 --> 02:02:24,794
costs.

4837
02:02:25,310 --> 02:02:27,200
Everybody's bombarding him saying,

4838
02:02:27,230 --> 02:02:27,471
oh,

4839
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:27,801
pay me,

4840
02:02:27,801 --> 02:02:28,610
pay me.

4841
02:02:28,610 --> 02:02:29,780
And he's kind of just ignoring it.

4842
02:02:30,050 --> 02:02:31,280
People are threatening to sue him.

4843
02:02:31,370 --> 02:02:32,001
You better pay.

4844
02:02:32,001 --> 02:02:32,834
You promised.

4845
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:36,200
I had already set up a go fund
me for the project before,

4846
02:02:36,201 --> 02:02:38,480
I believe it was before he announced
I made a video about it saying,

4847
02:02:38,481 --> 02:02:39,131
Donald Trump says x,

4848
02:02:39,131 --> 02:02:39,200
y,

4849
02:02:39,200 --> 02:02:39,410
and z.

4850
02:02:39,410 --> 02:02:40,400
We're going to go to the story.

4851
02:02:40,940 --> 02:02:42,080
When I saw he made this call,

4852
02:02:42,081 --> 02:02:43,490
I think it was actually
emily who noticed it.

4853
02:02:44,300 --> 02:02:44,930
I said,

4854
02:02:44,930 --> 02:02:45,141
hey,

4855
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:45,974
I'll do it.

4856
02:02:46,070 --> 02:02:47,450
And he was like to be.

4857
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:48,460
I think that's something like,

4858
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:49,281
I was just taking the piss,

4859
02:02:49,281 --> 02:02:49,701
but yeah,

4860
02:02:49,701 --> 02:02:49,911
sure.

4861
02:02:49,911 --> 02:02:50,721
I'll send you a donation,

4862
02:02:50,721 --> 02:02:51,531
and I laughed and I was like,

4863
02:02:51,531 --> 02:02:51,831
hey man,

4864
02:02:51,831 --> 02:02:52,190
I'll take,

4865
02:02:52,190 --> 02:02:52,311
you know,

4866
02:02:52,311 --> 02:02:53,810
if he wants to throw my at my go fund me.

4867
02:02:54,620 --> 02:02:59,120
Here's what ends up happening
as people then claim I was uh,

4868
02:02:59,121 --> 02:03:01,520
I went there because Paul
Joseph Watson challenged,

4869
02:03:01,550 --> 02:03:02,000
challenged me.

4870
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:02,833
Not true.

4871
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:07,400
He donated about nine percent of our total
fund that we raised and I was already

4872
02:03:07,401 --> 02:03:08,234
planning on going there.

4873
02:03:08,510 --> 02:03:09,343
Wikipedia.

4874
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:10,430
Uh,

4875
02:03:10,430 --> 02:03:13,260
there was a challenge on my
wikipedia page where they,

4876
02:03:13,420 --> 02:03:14,360
someone said,

4877
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:16,730
you wrote tim pool went there because it,

4878
02:03:16,731 --> 02:03:17,780
paul just wasn't challenged him to.

4879
02:03:17,781 --> 02:03:18,614
That's not true.

4880
02:03:18,980 --> 02:03:19,820
What's your proof?

4881
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:22,640
This youtube video from
tim pool where he sAys,

4882
02:03:22,850 --> 02:03:24,080
we've already arranged this.

4883
02:03:24,081 --> 02:03:25,250
We're not going here because of paul.

4884
02:03:25,251 --> 02:03:26,084
Joseph watson.

4885
02:03:26,150 --> 02:03:28,820
The response that's not a reliable source.

4886
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:30,890
Someone came back with a reliable source,

4887
02:03:30,891 --> 02:03:31,121
you know it,

4888
02:03:31,121 --> 02:03:34,550
it was a huffington post article
that quoted my youtube video.

4889
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:38,743
How's that?

4890
02:03:39,170 --> 02:03:40,010
I don't understand.

4891
02:03:40,400 --> 02:03:42,170
Why couldn't you just take my word for it?

4892
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:44,630
Why did you have to get
huffington post to just quote me?

4893
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:47,050
That was apparently so I,

4894
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:47,893
you know,

4895
02:03:48,250 --> 02:03:49,041
that's enough.

4896
02:03:49,041 --> 02:03:49,810
I guess so.

4897
02:03:49,810 --> 02:03:53,120
So the reason I bring this up is
because what happens then if you're a

4898
02:03:53,121 --> 02:03:57,470
conservative and a bunch of friends who
work for various news organizations all

4899
02:03:57,471 --> 02:03:58,041
at the same time,

4900
02:03:58,041 --> 02:04:02,330
write 10 articles saying joe rogan is
all right now on wikipedia at 10 articles

4901
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:03,980
pop up immediately saying this is a fact.

4902
02:04:04,040 --> 02:04:08,090
Ten different organizations have written
it and there it is in your and your

4903
02:04:08,091 --> 02:04:08,660
page.

4904
02:04:08,660 --> 02:04:11,180
And the crazy thing is the
uk does this all the time,

4905
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:11,661
you know,

4906
02:04:11,661 --> 02:04:13,160
they call various personalities,

4907
02:04:13,161 --> 02:04:13,641
alt right?

4908
02:04:13,641 --> 02:04:14,330
They call sargon.

4909
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:15,163
They call it [inaudible].

4910
02:04:15,800 --> 02:04:18,140
Just go to wikipedia and look up the
phrase it means white nationalists,

4911
02:04:18,141 --> 02:04:18,974
neo confederate.

4912
02:04:19,280 --> 02:04:20,990
It's like literally about
a white ethno state.

4913
02:04:21,110 --> 02:04:23,360
These people have denounced
this and that and you know,

4914
02:04:23,370 --> 02:04:27,740
it's like going to chicago was a really
fascinating phenomenon on patrion where

4915
02:04:28,310 --> 02:04:33,310
all of a sudden these left wing outlets
said sargon was banned for a going after

4916
02:04:33,501 --> 02:04:34,334
the alt right.

4917
02:04:34,460 --> 02:04:34,851
And I'm like,

4918
02:04:34,851 --> 02:04:35,684
well hold on.

4919
02:04:35,870 --> 02:04:37,290
You've wriTten in the past that he was.

4920
02:04:37,291 --> 02:04:38,060
All right.

4921
02:04:38,060 --> 02:04:42,170
Well when you say you like the
media is not the organization,

4922
02:04:42,370 --> 02:04:43,530
same organizations,

4923
02:04:43,531 --> 02:04:44,460
but different authors.

4924
02:04:44,490 --> 02:04:44,791
Well,

4925
02:04:44,791 --> 02:04:45,820
I don't wanna I don't want to,

4926
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,670
but not the same journalists.

4927
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,590
Um,

4928
02:04:48,590 --> 02:04:48,940
I,

4929
02:04:48,940 --> 02:04:50,010
I will lean towards,

4930
02:04:50,011 --> 02:04:50,521
I believe.

4931
02:04:50,521 --> 02:04:50,911
Yes.

4932
02:04:50,911 --> 02:04:51,431
Because it's,

4933
02:04:51,431 --> 02:04:51,750
it's,

4934
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:52,920
it's so,

4935
02:04:52,980 --> 02:04:53,970
whenever it's convenient,

4936
02:04:53,971 --> 02:04:54,480
they just throw,

4937
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,170
throw that.

4938
02:04:55,170 --> 02:04:57,000
There are some people who write.

4939
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,130
The problem is if I may,

4940
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:00,210
if I name these people,

4941
02:05:00,480 --> 02:05:01,050
they're going to,

4942
02:05:01,050 --> 02:05:03,690
they're going to point their pens in my
direction and then all of these things

4943
02:05:03,691 --> 02:05:04,471
are going to swing at me.

4944
02:05:04,471 --> 02:05:06,120
And the other thing too
is I don't want to do,

4945
02:05:06,121 --> 02:05:06,870
I don't want to forget them.

4946
02:05:06,870 --> 02:05:07,920
It's not important anyway.

4947
02:05:07,950 --> 02:05:11,790
What's really important is the actual
reality of how that's done there are,

4948
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:14,040
I really want to name this organization.

4949
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:16,110
It's one of the prominent well known,

4950
02:05:16,111 --> 02:05:18,870
but they repeatedly write stories
that are just so over the top.

4951
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:20,250
I roll my eyes and I'm like,

4952
02:05:20,810 --> 02:05:21,600
do you will.

4953
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:22,740
I will say The huffington post,

4954
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:23,520
you know,

4955
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,930
is another organization that wrote

4956
02:05:26,590 --> 02:05:27,423
like,

4957
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:28,140
um,

4958
02:05:28,140 --> 02:05:28,591
oh god,

4959
02:05:28,591 --> 02:05:29,090
what was it?

4960
02:05:29,090 --> 02:05:29,400
Some,

4961
02:05:29,400 --> 02:05:29,720
some.

4962
02:05:29,720 --> 02:05:34,720
This guy wrote about nazis on steam
steam that steam has a knotty problem and

4963
02:05:35,881 --> 02:05:37,710
very clearly like anybody was like,

4964
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:39,500
it was a game

4965
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:44,550
because apparently he was
referencing a very small like,

4966
02:05:44,670 --> 02:05:45,480
here's what happens.

4967
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:45,781
Okay.

4968
02:05:45,781 --> 02:05:46,950
I don't know too much about this.

4969
02:05:46,951 --> 02:05:49,290
I know there was criticism in the
journalism space around what he did,

4970
02:05:49,860 --> 02:05:52,950
but it's like you find three guys
on twitter who are saying something.

4971
02:05:52,951 --> 02:05:53,371
They quote,

4972
02:05:53,371 --> 02:05:54,300
tweet them and say boom,

4973
02:05:54,301 --> 02:05:56,400
fact like you find one guy who says,

4974
02:05:56,401 --> 02:05:56,641
you know,

4975
02:05:56,641 --> 02:05:57,960
I just plain don't like this group.

4976
02:05:57,961 --> 02:05:58,490
And they'll be like,

4977
02:05:58,490 --> 02:05:58,710
oh,

4978
02:05:58,710 --> 02:05:59,850
nazis don't like this group.

4979
02:05:59,851 --> 02:06:01,680
And they'll write a big story about
it because they found one tweet.

4980
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:02,720
You know what I mean?

4981
02:06:02,720 --> 02:06:03,300
Yeah.

4982
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:04,890
So apparently,

4983
02:06:05,510 --> 02:06:06,240
you know,

4984
02:06:06,240 --> 02:06:08,760
this guy in the huffington post wrote
a story about how people on gab,

4985
02:06:08,770 --> 02:06:11,730
we're presenting really discussing
recipes for food and I'm just,

4986
02:06:11,731 --> 02:06:16,731
I'm wondering what's newsworthy about
a random gab users mascioli recipe.

4987
02:06:17,220 --> 02:06:17,371
Oh,

4988
02:06:17,371 --> 02:06:18,060
I saw that.

4989
02:06:18,060 --> 02:06:18,811
It was hilarious.

4990
02:06:18,811 --> 02:06:19,051
But,

4991
02:06:19,051 --> 02:06:19,290
but,

4992
02:06:19,290 --> 02:06:20,123
but then again,

4993
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:21,360
is that comedy article?

4994
02:06:21,420 --> 02:06:22,051
Yeah,

4995
02:06:22,051 --> 02:06:23,160
it's an opinion piece.

4996
02:06:23,430 --> 02:06:24,780
It's just calling people assholes.

4997
02:06:24,810 --> 02:06:26,880
But then there's senior editor,

4998
02:06:26,881 --> 02:06:29,100
a senior writer who travels
and covers news on the ground.

4999
02:06:29,101 --> 02:06:30,060
Why but put.

5000
02:06:30,070 --> 02:06:30,510
Hold on.

5001
02:06:30,510 --> 02:06:32,820
Isn't that funny or isn't it interesting?

5002
02:06:32,821 --> 02:06:35,400
I mean it's just some shitty recipes.

5003
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:40,560
like the only thing that's odd about it
is that it's a gab shitty recipe because

5004
02:06:40,561 --> 02:06:42,240
it was just a shitty recipe online.

5005
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:43,074
But that's my question.

5006
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:44,400
Say it was on medium,

5007
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:45,841
which by the way,

5008
02:06:45,841 --> 02:06:47,730
we can't leave without
talking about Jeff Bezos.

5009
02:06:47,910 --> 02:06:48,300
Alright,

5010
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:49,780
well we can get into that.

5011
02:06:49,790 --> 02:06:50,040
Let's,

5012
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:50,700
let's talk about it.

5013
02:06:50,700 --> 02:06:52,500
But if it was on medium,

5014
02:06:52,501 --> 02:06:53,280
if someone said like,

5015
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:56,700
look at these dummies with
their terrible fucking recipes,

5016
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:58,440
it would still be almost as interesting,

5017
02:06:58,441 --> 02:07:00,290
but it's flavored by.

5018
02:07:00,300 --> 02:07:02,710
You're allowed to mock
them because it's your job.

5019
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:03,170
But.

5020
02:07:03,170 --> 02:07:03,481
But it's,

5021
02:07:03,481 --> 02:07:05,250
it's almost like they're uneducated.

5022
02:07:05,400 --> 02:07:05,910
You know,

5023
02:07:05,910 --> 02:07:10,910
vox ran an article claiming that people
who hold alt right views are like 11

5024
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:14,340
million or some huge number
and that's just like,

5025
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:15,293
it's absurd.

5026
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:17,700
That's not 11 million american.

5027
02:07:17,870 --> 02:07:20,880
What you defined outright as being
some sort of a white supremacist.

5028
02:07:20,881 --> 02:07:21,780
I will quote the associated.

5029
02:07:21,781 --> 02:07:21,960
Okay.

5030
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:22,793
Associated press.

5031
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:27,630
The aap guidelines are that alt
right means white nationalist,

5032
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:28,290
a designer.

5033
02:07:28,290 --> 02:07:28,801
Can I ask you this?

5034
02:07:28,801 --> 02:07:29,634
Who defined that?

5035
02:07:30,150 --> 02:07:30,840
How does it,

5036
02:07:30,840 --> 02:07:31,560
why are they.

5037
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:35,320
Because Richard Spencer is the
man who popularized the term.

5038
02:07:35,840 --> 02:07:36,300
Yeah.

5039
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:37,810
So he's not the one who coined it,

5040
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:40,990
but he popularized it and
he is a white nationalist.

5041
02:07:41,090 --> 02:07:41,310
Right.

5042
02:07:41,310 --> 02:07:41,620
So,

5043
02:07:41,620 --> 02:07:42,130
I Mean,

5044
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:42,370
you know,

5045
02:07:42,370 --> 02:07:43,720
if you want to be a part of his movement,

5046
02:07:43,721 --> 02:07:46,000
there are certain things that
are attached to it and uh,

5047
02:07:46,050 --> 02:07:46,421
other,

5048
02:07:46,421 --> 02:07:49,150
other people have written
huge things about what it is.

5049
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:51,280
So the ap said,

5050
02:07:51,310 --> 02:07:52,770
these are our guidelines and I'll,

5051
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:53,950
I'll defer to the associated press.

5052
02:07:53,951 --> 02:07:54,910
I have a lot of respect for them.

5053
02:07:55,600 --> 02:07:56,350
There you go.

5054
02:07:56,350 --> 02:07:56,591
You know,

5055
02:07:56,591 --> 02:07:57,180
so if,

5056
02:07:57,180 --> 02:07:58,600
if there's a news organizations,

5057
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:00,850
there was a willamette weekly,

5058
02:08:01,050 --> 02:08:02,770
this is god man.

5059
02:08:02,771 --> 02:08:03,604
I just really,

5060
02:08:03,610 --> 02:08:03,881
I,

5061
02:08:03,881 --> 02:08:04,610
I,

5062
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:05,590
I worked for vice,

5063
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:07,510
I was actually a one.

5064
02:08:07,600 --> 02:08:11,680
I'm one of the key reasons vice news
exists and I look back on it now.

5065
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:13,780
It makes me kind of sad how
they've written some of these,

5066
02:08:13,781 --> 02:08:15,130
most of these ridiculous articles.

5067
02:08:15,131 --> 02:08:16,510
I'm really proud of a lot
of stuff they've done,

5068
02:08:16,780 --> 02:08:17,041
but I,

5069
02:08:17,041 --> 02:08:17,860
I quit.

5070
02:08:17,860 --> 02:08:22,630
I quiT when I got an offer from
fusion and fusion is an abc,

5071
02:08:22,631 --> 02:08:23,770
univision joint venture.

5072
02:08:24,850 --> 02:08:25,180
When I,

5073
02:08:25,180 --> 02:08:25,991
when I started there,

5074
02:08:25,991 --> 02:08:28,420
they said we won't be
partisan for some reason.

5075
02:08:28,421 --> 02:08:31,390
They decided to go far left and start
pushing a lot of things that I thought

5076
02:08:31,391 --> 02:08:32,224
were wrong.

5077
02:08:32,290 --> 02:08:32,771
They,

5078
02:08:32,771 --> 02:08:33,580
uh,

5079
02:08:33,580 --> 02:08:36,490
told me to in effect lie right.

5080
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:37,860
So the,

5081
02:08:37,861 --> 02:08:41,500
the thing I'll bring up is I
just have such disdain for these,

5082
02:08:41,501 --> 02:08:46,501
these news organizations and how they
use definitions that suit their needs to

5083
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:49,000
get the clicks they want
your ultra right today.

5084
02:08:49,001 --> 02:08:49,520
You're not outright.

5085
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:50,680
Tomorrow's fine,

5086
02:08:51,090 --> 02:08:51,870
right?

5087
02:08:51,870 --> 02:08:52,060
The,

5088
02:08:52,060 --> 02:08:52,241
the,

5089
02:08:52,241 --> 02:08:54,240
the click thing isn't an issue,

5090
02:08:54,300 --> 02:08:54,640
right?

5091
02:08:54,640 --> 02:08:55,380
Um,

5092
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:58,650
how much of an issue is that journalists
are essentially fighting for their

5093
02:08:58,651 --> 02:09:01,530
lives because newspaper is almost dead.

5094
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:03,451
It's online.

5095
02:09:03,451 --> 02:09:04,920
Publications are trying.

5096
02:09:04,980 --> 02:09:06,420
They're trying to get subscriptions.

5097
02:09:06,421 --> 02:09:10,440
Like I subscribe to several different
news online publication that used to be

5098
02:09:10,441 --> 02:09:11,071
newspapers,

5099
02:09:11,071 --> 02:09:14,070
but the last time I picked
up an actual newspaper,

5100
02:09:14,730 --> 02:09:19,730
it's so much so that I felt like I had
a joke about reading something in the

5101
02:09:20,191 --> 02:09:21,750
paper and uh,

5102
02:09:21,810 --> 02:09:22,890
like turning the pages.

5103
02:09:22,891 --> 02:09:27,210
I almost felt like I'm a liar for doing
a joke about turning the page of a

5104
02:09:27,211 --> 02:09:27,631
paper.

5105
02:09:27,631 --> 02:09:28,140
Right.

5106
02:09:28,140 --> 02:09:29,940
I don't remember the last
time I fucking did that.

5107
02:09:29,970 --> 02:09:33,900
Everything I've read is either
on a tablet or on a laptop or

5108
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:34,600
do you know,

5109
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:36,760
do you know what the
galman amnesia effect is?

5110
02:09:36,820 --> 02:09:37,653
No.

5111
02:09:38,590 --> 02:09:40,210
When you're an expert in mma,

5112
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:41,890
you're like one of the foremoSt experts.

5113
02:09:42,310 --> 02:09:45,040
Have you ever read a news article
about mma that was so wrong?

5114
02:09:45,820 --> 02:09:46,121
Okay,

5115
02:09:46,121 --> 02:09:47,620
so that same newspaper,

5116
02:09:47,621 --> 02:09:48,454
you're reading it,

5117
02:09:48,640 --> 02:09:50,860
you see that store and you laugh how
ron it could be you turn the page and

5118
02:09:50,861 --> 02:09:51,870
there's a story about Syria and you go,

5119
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:52,743
I didn't know that.

5120
02:09:53,830 --> 02:09:55,900
Why would you forget how wrong they were?

5121
02:09:55,901 --> 02:09:59,260
But the reason I bring this up is the
analogy is that you turn the page.

5122
02:09:59,520 --> 02:09:59,930
Nobody does.

5123
02:09:59,930 --> 02:10:00,730
You click the link.

5124
02:10:00,730 --> 02:10:00,980
Right?

5125
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:01,220
Right.

5126
02:10:01,220 --> 02:10:01,481
But,

5127
02:10:01,481 --> 02:10:01,660
uh,

5128
02:10:01,660 --> 02:10:02,740
but let's talk about clicks.

5129
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:05,290
One of the things we talked about
the other day is traffic assignment.

5130
02:10:05,830 --> 02:10:07,510
So I know you asked me this.

5131
02:10:07,540 --> 02:10:08,290
They're fighting for their lives.

5132
02:10:08,290 --> 02:10:09,041
It's a serious issue,

5133
02:10:09,041 --> 02:10:12,670
but I just like to point out their
lives never existed in the media space.

5134
02:10:12,671 --> 02:10:12,830
Yeah,

5135
02:10:12,830 --> 02:10:17,450
please explain that because that was one
of the most illuminating aspects of our

5136
02:10:17,451 --> 02:10:18,440
conversation on the phone.

5137
02:10:18,760 --> 02:10:19,091
yeah.

5138
02:10:19,091 --> 02:10:19,750
Um,

5139
02:10:19,750 --> 02:10:20,020
it's,

5140
02:10:20,020 --> 02:10:22,720
it's publicly known but not talked
about a whole lot that these media

5141
02:10:22,721 --> 02:10:23,381
organizations,

5142
02:10:23,381 --> 02:10:27,430
mostly these digital new startups
don't actually get a lot of views.

5143
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:30,370
So what they do is it's
called a traffic assignment.

5144
02:10:30,930 --> 02:10:34,850
There's a company called comscore
that tracks the viewership.

5145
02:10:34,851 --> 02:10:36,050
The unique views these sites have.

5146
02:10:36,530 --> 02:10:40,160
If you're trying to attract investment
and you say we get 20 million views per

5147
02:10:40,161 --> 02:10:40,550
month,

5148
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:41,383
they're going to say,

5149
02:10:41,450 --> 02:10:42,171
that's cool,

5150
02:10:42,171 --> 02:10:43,340
but this site get 60.

5151
02:10:43,550 --> 02:10:44,383
What do they do?

5152
02:10:44,600 --> 02:10:44,751
Well,

5153
02:10:44,751 --> 02:10:45,710
there are some sites.

5154
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:47,000
This is according to variety.

5155
02:10:47,150 --> 02:10:48,620
Modern farmer.com.

5156
02:10:49,160 --> 02:10:49,930
What is that?

5157
02:10:49,930 --> 02:10:50,200
I have,

5158
02:10:50,200 --> 02:10:50,751
I have no idea.

5159
02:10:50,751 --> 02:10:51,584
I've never heard of it,

5160
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:55,250
but there are many sites which you've
probably seen where it's like the top 25

5161
02:10:55,251 --> 02:10:56,680
celebrities who you know,

5162
02:10:56,810 --> 02:10:57,620
mess up their makeup.

5163
02:10:57,620 --> 02:10:58,190
Yes.

5164
02:10:58,190 --> 02:11:01,220
You click the page and I'll show you a
photo in order to see the next photo.

5165
02:11:01,250 --> 02:11:02,810
You got to click the next page.

5166
02:11:02,990 --> 02:11:03,830
That's that way.

5167
02:11:03,831 --> 02:11:08,420
They turn you one person to
25 unique views are 25 years.

5168
02:11:08,421 --> 02:11:09,254
I don't wanna say unique.

5169
02:11:09,710 --> 02:11:12,590
Then accompany like vice for instance,

5170
02:11:12,740 --> 02:11:17,030
we'll buy the assignment of your
traffic and attribute it to themselves.

5171
02:11:17,360 --> 02:11:21,260
So when the comscore numbers come out it
will say all of those views from those

5172
02:11:21,261 --> 02:11:22,670
clickbaits sites are actually vice.

5173
02:11:23,090 --> 02:11:23,450
Right.

5174
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:24,500
That's fucking crazy.

5175
02:11:24,530 --> 02:11:26,540
And so there was a controversy a bit.

5176
02:11:27,620 --> 02:11:28,101
Again,

5177
02:11:28,101 --> 02:11:29,270
I'm quoting variety here.

5178
02:11:29,271 --> 02:11:29,961
I don't want to get sued,

5179
02:11:29,961 --> 02:11:34,961
but variety said that their traffic went
down 17 percent because someone they

5180
02:11:35,031 --> 02:11:38,970
were buying traffic assignment from was
like going through turmoil and shake and

5181
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:39,411
being shaken,

5182
02:11:39,411 --> 02:11:43,820
shaken up and another one of their
traffic assignment partners switched to I

5183
02:11:43,821 --> 02:11:44,200
think like,

5184
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:44,570
you know,

5185
02:11:44,570 --> 02:11:45,860
got sold to nbc or something.

5186
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:46,761
So.

5187
02:11:46,761 --> 02:11:47,600
So what ends up happening?

5188
02:11:47,930 --> 02:11:48,201
Well,

5189
02:11:48,201 --> 02:11:50,150
I can say I'm a little bit.

5190
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:54,170
There was a company that was a
prominent digital news outlet.

5191
02:11:54,530 --> 02:11:59,530
I knew someone there who was a decently
high up who told me our company is

5192
02:12:00,081 --> 02:12:03,350
contemplating whether or not we should
engage in traffic assignments to inflate

5193
02:12:03,351 --> 02:12:04,184
our numbers.

5194
02:12:04,490 --> 02:12:05,001
And I said,

5195
02:12:05,001 --> 02:12:05,960
don't do it like,

5196
02:12:05,961 --> 02:12:06,794
that's wrong.

5197
02:12:06,810 --> 02:12:07,311
And they said,

5198
02:12:07,311 --> 02:12:08,240
but we need investment.

5199
02:12:09,860 --> 02:12:12,170
So I wonder if is that fraud?

5200
02:12:12,640 --> 02:12:13,190
yes.

5201
02:12:13,190 --> 02:12:16,500
But if comscore is,

5202
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:19,850
is just lumping the numbers
together and I go to you and say,

5203
02:12:19,910 --> 02:12:21,230
according to comscore,

5204
02:12:21,290 --> 02:12:23,600
our network brings in 60 million.

5205
02:12:23,720 --> 02:12:24,553
I didn't lie.

5206
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:25,483
That's all true.

5207
02:12:25,910 --> 02:12:26,630
Yes,

5208
02:12:26,630 --> 02:12:27,410
that's true.

5209
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:28,250
So here's what happens.

5210
02:12:28,490 --> 02:12:30,020
These companies get massive investment.

5211
02:12:30,530 --> 02:12:32,750
They don't actually generate
enough clicks or enough money.

5212
02:12:33,320 --> 02:12:35,360
Then once the investment runs out,

5213
02:12:36,080 --> 02:12:37,220
those jobs never existed.

5214
02:12:37,400 --> 02:12:37,911
Those were,

5215
02:12:37,911 --> 02:12:39,620
those were padded by investors.

5216
02:12:40,460 --> 02:12:41,390
So god,

5217
02:12:41,391 --> 02:12:42,224
that's squirrely.

5218
02:12:42,590 --> 02:12:43,311
Everything collapses.

5219
02:12:43,311 --> 02:12:44,270
It seems like fraud.

5220
02:12:44,540 --> 02:12:44,751
I mean,

5221
02:12:44,751 --> 02:12:45,200
it does to me.

5222
02:12:45,200 --> 02:12:45,620
Yeah.

5223
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:47,540
That seems like if that was,

5224
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:48,910
if you were doing that with,

5225
02:12:48,911 --> 02:12:49,580
uh,

5226
02:12:49,580 --> 02:12:51,260
some tech stock.

5227
02:12:52,420 --> 02:12:52,900
Yup.

5228
02:12:52,900 --> 02:12:53,420
Yeah.

5229
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:53,890
Right?

5230
02:12:53,890 --> 02:12:54,723
Yup.

5231
02:12:55,080 --> 02:12:57,200
Musically or something like that,

5232
02:12:57,230 --> 02:12:57,840
you know,

5233
02:12:57,840 --> 02:12:58,030
uh,

5234
02:12:58,030 --> 02:13:01,850
I was told by another individual who was
at one of these digital companies that

5235
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:06,680
he felt like what we were seeing was
akin to the securities a problem,

5236
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:10,590
the mortgage back securities
from designate that,

5237
02:13:10,690 --> 02:13:11,810
if that's a better analogy.

5238
02:13:11,840 --> 02:13:12,170
Right?

5239
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:12,651
That's what he said.

5240
02:13:12,651 --> 02:13:13,270
He said,

5241
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:14,103
think about this.

5242
02:13:14,210 --> 02:13:15,510
You've had all of these big companies,

5243
02:13:15,511 --> 02:13:16,101
these big investment,

5244
02:13:16,101 --> 02:13:17,090
hundreds of millions of dollars,

5245
02:13:17,091 --> 02:13:20,150
$200,000,000 invested into these digital
media outlets because they're seeing

5246
02:13:20,151 --> 02:13:20,984
these numbers,

5247
02:13:21,230 --> 02:13:24,200
but underneath there's
nothing there and it's crazy.

5248
02:13:24,201 --> 02:13:25,430
So if you're investing money,

5249
02:13:25,431 --> 02:13:26,270
so if you've got some,

5250
02:13:26,300 --> 02:13:27,133
some cash,

5251
02:13:27,350 --> 02:13:30,740
you've worked your ass off and you've
generated a lot of money and you're like,

5252
02:13:30,741 --> 02:13:30,921
look,

5253
02:13:30,921 --> 02:13:32,340
we're going to get into the digital space.

5254
02:13:32,580 --> 02:13:36,210
We have a website that has 90 million
clicks and we're going to take that,

5255
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:38,910
and then you find out you
just got fucking host.

5256
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:40,020
How has that not fraud?

5257
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:42,570
Because buyer beware.

5258
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:43,410
Well,

5259
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:46,080
because there's laws that legalized fraud.

5260
02:13:46,290 --> 02:13:46,740
You know?

5261
02:13:46,740 --> 02:13:47,460
Here's the thing,

5262
02:13:47,460 --> 02:13:47,681
right?

5263
02:13:47,681 --> 02:13:48,480
I use a lot.

5264
02:13:48,480 --> 02:13:49,313
Is it a law?

5265
02:13:49,400 --> 02:13:50,680
But it's.

5266
02:13:50,870 --> 02:13:51,090
It's,

5267
02:13:51,090 --> 02:13:51,390
it's,

5268
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:52,141
it's an interesting loophole.

5269
02:13:52,141 --> 02:13:54,390
It's not fraud because
they didn't lie to you,

5270
02:13:54,570 --> 02:13:55,403
they didn't deceive you.

5271
02:13:55,650 --> 02:13:58,020
You had every opportunity to look at those
numbers and see where they came from,

5272
02:13:58,021 --> 02:13:59,220
to understand what their network was.

5273
02:13:59,250 --> 02:13:59,521
Okay,

5274
02:13:59,521 --> 02:14:01,380
well that may be the case,

5275
02:14:01,381 --> 02:14:03,000
but the act of doing it,

5276
02:14:03,090 --> 02:14:05,100
the act of the fact that
you can do it and it really,

5277
02:14:05,101 --> 02:14:05,934
you're getting monitoring.

5278
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,430
It's fucking crazy shady,

5279
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:09,031
but I'll tell you,

5280
02:14:09,031 --> 02:14:09,570
I'll tell you what,

5281
02:14:09,570 --> 02:14:10,231
I'll something else too,

5282
02:14:10,231 --> 02:14:10,421
and I,

5283
02:14:10,421 --> 02:14:12,250
and I say this with
the utmost respect for,

5284
02:14:12,251 --> 02:14:13,590
for shane smith who,

5285
02:14:13,591 --> 02:14:14,424
um,

5286
02:14:14,760 --> 02:14:15,001
you know,

5287
02:14:15,001 --> 02:14:15,834
I worked at vice,

5288
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:16,650
we've gone out for drinks.

5289
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:17,400
They flew me.

5290
02:14:17,400 --> 02:14:18,090
I love shane.

5291
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:18,923
He's cool dude,

5292
02:14:19,080 --> 02:14:19,913
but he's brilliant.

5293
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:20,671
Absolutely brilliant.

5294
02:14:20,671 --> 02:14:20,910
He is,

5295
02:14:20,910 --> 02:14:22,750
he is a master of a,

5296
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:25,290
I don't know what you would call it,

5297
02:14:25,291 --> 02:14:26,124
but it's a form,

5298
02:14:26,300 --> 02:14:26,520
you know,

5299
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:26,781
so I,

5300
02:14:26,781 --> 02:14:29,430
I grew up with a bunch of hacker buddies
and in a small little hacker community

5301
02:14:29,431 --> 02:14:33,800
and social engineering is something that
I've been relatively well versed in and

5302
02:14:33,810 --> 02:14:34,643
shane,

5303
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:37,920
whether he knows it or not really really
understands how people think and how to

5304
02:14:37,921 --> 02:14:39,060
get them to do things.

5305
02:14:39,570 --> 02:14:40,420
So I'll give you a,

5306
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:42,210
a fascinating example.

5307
02:14:42,630 --> 02:14:45,450
I left a vice in 2014 and after I left,

5308
02:14:45,451 --> 02:14:48,420
some of the people I had had brought on
through recommendation were still there.

5309
02:14:48,810 --> 02:14:49,950
This buddy of mine says,

5310
02:14:50,910 --> 02:14:51,450
dude,

5311
02:14:51,450 --> 02:14:52,140
good news.

5312
02:14:52,140 --> 02:14:53,560
I'm going to be running the,

5313
02:14:53,640 --> 02:14:57,390
I'm going to be helping produce the
news program for the cable channel.

5314
02:14:58,110 --> 02:14:58,501
I was like,

5315
02:14:58,501 --> 02:14:58,621
wow,

5316
02:14:58,621 --> 02:14:59,281
congratulations.

5317
02:14:59,281 --> 02:15:00,690
Does that mean you're moving to toronto?

5318
02:15:01,320 --> 02:15:01,651
He goes,

5319
02:15:01,651 --> 02:15:05,070
why would I move to toronto and I was
like to work on the cable channel.

5320
02:15:05,430 --> 02:15:06,330
This is back in 2014.

5321
02:15:06,331 --> 02:15:07,164
He goes,

5322
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:09,240
we were talking about we're
getting a cable channel.

5323
02:15:09,241 --> 02:15:10,051
I'm going to work on the new show,

5324
02:15:10,051 --> 02:15:10,411
and I was like,

5325
02:15:10,411 --> 02:15:10,890
dude,

5326
02:15:10,890 --> 02:15:12,090
it was a rogers deal.

5327
02:15:12,540 --> 02:15:13,770
The cable channels in Canada.

5328
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:15,160
It wasn't a couple years later,

5329
02:15:15,161 --> 02:15:16,320
so they got the us based channel,

5330
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:21,030
but what happened was a bunch of my
friends who worked at vice didn't know the

5331
02:15:21,031 --> 02:15:22,650
cable channel they got
was based in Canada,

5332
02:15:22,980 --> 02:15:27,060
but they believed they were going to be
working on a cable channel in the us.

5333
02:15:27,120 --> 02:15:30,960
that's important because you need people
to really want to work there and be

5334
02:15:30,961 --> 02:15:34,860
passionate and shane was a master of
giving you just enough information so that

5335
02:15:34,861 --> 02:15:38,370
you believed in what you were doing
without realizing it's actually not that

5336
02:15:38,371 --> 02:15:39,340
great and I've got.

5337
02:15:39,341 --> 02:15:40,021
I'm not trying to be dick.

5338
02:15:40,021 --> 02:15:40,950
I think shane's fantastic.

5339
02:15:40,951 --> 02:15:41,761
I don't blame him for this,

5340
02:15:41,761 --> 02:15:42,594
but it's clever.

5341
02:15:42,930 --> 02:15:45,750
You get a bunch of employees who believe
they are going to be on this big new

5342
02:15:45,751 --> 02:15:46,770
american cable channel.

5343
02:15:47,070 --> 02:15:47,191
Well,

5344
02:15:47,191 --> 02:15:48,270
shane never said american.

5345
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:49,170
He just said cable channel.

5346
02:15:49,350 --> 02:15:51,900
It's your fault for assuming
it was going to be in America,

5347
02:15:52,380 --> 02:15:53,940
but that meant a lot to those employees.

5348
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:55,410
So you're able to boost the morale,

5349
02:15:55,411 --> 02:15:58,680
get everybody really excited until
they find out it was in Canada.

5350
02:15:59,010 --> 02:15:59,843
And then they were like,

5351
02:15:59,850 --> 02:16:00,151
wait,

5352
02:16:00,151 --> 02:16:00,810
what?

5353
02:16:00,810 --> 02:16:00,961
What?

5354
02:16:00,961 --> 02:16:02,670
Eventually they did get their us channel,

5355
02:16:02,671 --> 02:16:03,720
but that's shane's.

5356
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:04,430
Uh,

5357
02:16:04,430 --> 02:16:05,131
he's brilliant.

5358
02:16:05,131 --> 02:16:05,461
He really is.

5359
02:16:05,461 --> 02:16:05,670
He's a,

5360
02:16:05,670 --> 02:16:06,503
he's a,

5361
02:16:06,510 --> 02:16:07,470
you ever play civilization?

5362
02:16:07,471 --> 02:16:08,220
The video game?

5363
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:08,850
No,

5364
02:16:08,850 --> 02:16:09,391
it's fantastic.

5365
02:16:09,391 --> 02:16:10,020
I love this game.

5366
02:16:10,020 --> 02:16:13,140
I'm playing civ six right
now and you can get.

5367
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:14,550
They're called great people.

5368
02:16:14,880 --> 02:16:15,713
They're called great people,

5369
02:16:16,210 --> 02:16:16,440
uh,

5370
02:16:16,440 --> 02:16:17,580
that if you earn enough points,

5371
02:16:17,581 --> 02:16:18,090
you'll get,

5372
02:16:18,090 --> 02:16:19,260
you'll get like galileo,

5373
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:20,700
he'll appear in your civilization museum.

5374
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:23,310
I firmly believe that in 100 years,

5375
02:16:23,311 --> 02:16:24,660
the next civilization 50,

5376
02:16:24,690 --> 02:16:26,760
you'll be able to earn a great merchant,

5377
02:16:26,790 --> 02:16:28,870
shane smith because of how I.

5378
02:16:28,970 --> 02:16:31,330
I know he was able to build this empire.

5379
02:16:31,331 --> 02:16:34,600
He did it through very clever
ways of getting investment.

5380
02:16:34,601 --> 02:16:37,420
And admittedly I really liked the
stuff they used to do back in the day.

5381
02:16:37,840 --> 02:16:38,673
I think the guys,

5382
02:16:38,770 --> 02:16:39,290
wow,

5383
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:39,471
he,

5384
02:16:39,471 --> 02:16:43,090
he knows how to do it and the reason I
bring him up is because the big story

5385
02:16:43,091 --> 02:16:47,230
about traffic assignment was vice
losing like 17 percent because of that

5386
02:16:47,231 --> 02:16:48,100
practice they were doing.

5387
02:16:48,130 --> 02:16:51,160
So he really knew how to
do the smoke and mirrors.

5388
02:16:51,220 --> 02:16:52,530
You know what,

5389
02:16:52,660 --> 02:16:53,560
when you look at the other,

5390
02:16:53,800 --> 02:16:54,880
when you look at how it pays out,

5391
02:16:55,180 --> 02:16:56,800
pans out to all the other news outlets,

5392
02:16:57,460 --> 02:16:58,600
then having gets laid off,

5393
02:16:58,930 --> 02:16:59,763
you have to one,

5394
02:16:59,830 --> 02:17:03,430
you don't have to wonder why a thousand
jobs just got lost in the past week.

5395
02:17:04,020 --> 02:17:05,350
It was just investment money.

5396
02:17:05,680 --> 02:17:07,090
And once they reached their threshold,

5397
02:17:07,510 --> 02:17:08,890
it all came crashing down.

5398
02:17:09,090 --> 02:17:09,560
God,

5399
02:17:09,560 --> 02:17:09,810
the,

5400
02:17:09,810 --> 02:17:12,160
the modern farmer example,

5401
02:17:12,560 --> 02:17:13,720
like modern farmer,

5402
02:17:13,721 --> 02:17:14,500
what is it?

5403
02:17:14,500 --> 02:17:15,850
I think with just the clicks,

5404
02:17:15,851 --> 02:17:16,560
just the,

5405
02:17:16,560 --> 02:17:16,750
the,

5406
02:17:16,750 --> 02:17:21,750
the fact that you can actually buy those
clicks anD attribute them to something

5407
02:17:22,091 --> 02:17:22,924
different.

5408
02:17:23,350 --> 02:17:25,220
And then you can tell people
in the oil will come in.

5409
02:17:25,230 --> 02:17:25,990
And he was like,

5410
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:26,820
yeah,

5411
02:17:26,820 --> 02:17:27,820
I'll do that.

5412
02:17:27,821 --> 02:17:30,130
And send them over to joe rogan.com.

5413
02:17:30,150 --> 02:17:30,271
He.

5414
02:17:30,271 --> 02:17:30,610
Oh yeah,

5415
02:17:30,610 --> 02:17:33,010
and as those other really
clever things to like,

5416
02:17:33,011 --> 02:17:33,844
um,

5417
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:35,590
I don't think this one is on par,

5418
02:17:35,591 --> 02:17:38,710
but make you have one youtube
channel with a thousand subs,

5419
02:17:38,830 --> 02:17:39,551
make 10 more,

5420
02:17:39,551 --> 02:17:40,660
ask all your subs and subscribe.

5421
02:17:40,690 --> 02:17:42,100
Now you've got 10,000 subs,

5422
02:17:42,730 --> 02:17:43,563
get it wrong.

5423
02:17:43,600 --> 02:17:46,540
Same thousand people 10
times and you've got,

5424
02:17:46,780 --> 02:17:49,510
you go around telling people I've got
10,000 subscribers when in reality it's

5425
02:17:49,511 --> 02:17:50,980
just a thousand people on 10 channels.

5426
02:17:52,470 --> 02:17:55,120
So it was really clever ways to
inflate your numbers and this attraCts

5427
02:17:55,121 --> 02:17:55,954
investment.

5428
02:17:56,190 --> 02:17:56,440
It'll,

5429
02:17:56,440 --> 02:17:56,891
it also,

5430
02:17:56,891 --> 02:17:57,581
but more importantly,

5431
02:17:57,581 --> 02:18:00,760
it allows leverage in dealing with
ads with ad buyers and ad networks.

5432
02:18:00,820 --> 02:18:04,300
What are people doing when they're
boosting up their instagram numbers?

5433
02:18:04,720 --> 02:18:05,021
Uh,

5434
02:18:05,021 --> 02:18:06,310
I don't know a lot about instagram.

5435
02:18:06,650 --> 02:18:07,151
Kind of pull it up.

5436
02:18:07,151 --> 02:18:09,780
I can't show you her and I just
went to a website by youtube.

5437
02:18:09,781 --> 02:18:12,190
Use.com for $2,800.

5438
02:18:12,191 --> 02:18:14,820
You can have a million views and that's,

5439
02:18:14,900 --> 02:18:15,420
but there's,

5440
02:18:15,420 --> 02:18:15,720
there's,

5441
02:18:15,720 --> 02:18:16,030
there's,

5442
02:18:16,030 --> 02:18:16,331
there's,

5443
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:17,080
um,

5444
02:18:17,080 --> 02:18:17,740
there's,

5445
02:18:17,740 --> 02:18:19,030
there's good reasons to do it.

5446
02:18:19,270 --> 02:18:20,470
Not if you want to be a youtuber,

5447
02:18:20,950 --> 02:18:22,180
if you want to be successful on youtube,

5448
02:18:22,181 --> 02:18:23,860
buying views ensures
you will never make it,

5449
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:25,900
but look at it this way.

5450
02:18:27,340 --> 02:18:28,480
No one do this.

5451
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:29,590
No one.

5452
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:33,220
I am not advocating for
one about to explain film.

5453
02:18:33,221 --> 02:18:34,300
10 videos,

5454
02:18:34,390 --> 02:18:39,390
a full season of the joe rogan travel
adventure by a million views on each to be

5455
02:18:40,451 --> 02:18:41,500
pat it out over a month.

5456
02:18:42,130 --> 02:18:44,050
Go to a and e.

5457
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:44,411
Look at this show.

5458
02:18:44,411 --> 02:18:46,360
We launched million views per episode.

5459
02:18:46,420 --> 02:18:47,253
You want to buy it?

5460
02:18:47,950 --> 02:18:48,670
Wow.

5461
02:18:48,670 --> 02:18:49,421
Got a bunch of fans,

5462
02:18:49,421 --> 02:18:50,980
a million people watch youtube episodes.

5463
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:52,143
Fantastic.

5464
02:18:52,330 --> 02:18:52,720
You've seen it.

5465
02:18:52,720 --> 02:18:53,280
You see what I mean?

5466
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:53,830
Yes.

5467
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:55,030
Well if you're full of shit,

5468
02:18:55,560 --> 02:18:56,231
but hey man,

5469
02:18:56,231 --> 02:18:58,720
there are people who it's snake
oil is people who do this,

5470
02:18:59,020 --> 02:18:59,853
but here's the thing.

5471
02:18:59,980 --> 02:19:01,990
You get access to a
network with real views.

5472
02:19:02,040 --> 02:19:02,873
You'll get traffic.

5473
02:19:03,140 --> 02:19:03,700
You know,

5474
02:19:03,700 --> 02:19:05,470
if you can trick your
way into getting on tv,

5475
02:19:05,471 --> 02:19:06,304
fake it till you make it.

5476
02:19:06,820 --> 02:19:07,390
It's dirty.

5477
02:19:07,390 --> 02:19:08,280
It's illegal,

5478
02:19:08,350 --> 02:19:08,670
right?

5479
02:19:08,670 --> 02:19:09,503
I was illegal.

5480
02:19:09,700 --> 02:19:10,533
that's fraud.

5481
02:19:10,540 --> 02:19:12,470
Well actually I don't know if that.

5482
02:19:12,520 --> 02:19:13,560
I don't think it is fraud if.

5483
02:19:13,600 --> 02:19:13,820
Well,

5484
02:19:13,820 --> 02:19:16,660
I'm the clicks like that.

5485
02:19:16,750 --> 02:19:17,110
I think,

5486
02:19:17,110 --> 02:19:18,100
I think New York,

5487
02:19:18,200 --> 02:19:21,700
there was someone sent me an article that
the attorney general of one state may

5488
02:19:21,701 --> 02:19:22,600
have been New York said,

5489
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:25,810
misrepresenting yourself
online through fake views,

5490
02:19:25,811 --> 02:19:26,950
clicks and likes is illegal.

5491
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:31,730
I think what they were saying is that
using Other people's images to create fake

5492
02:19:31,731 --> 02:19:34,010
accounts is like invasion
of privacy or something,

5493
02:19:34,280 --> 02:19:35,210
but we're getting to that point.

5494
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:36,860
But you know,

5495
02:19:37,160 --> 02:19:39,110
there's people who play that game.

5496
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:41,360
I guess you can really.

5497
02:19:41,390 --> 02:19:42,081
You can really pull it off.

5498
02:19:42,081 --> 02:19:43,340
I've met a lot of people who.

5499
02:19:44,150 --> 02:19:44,931
There's a bunch of tricks,

5500
02:19:44,931 --> 02:19:45,530
man.

5501
02:19:45,530 --> 02:19:45,801
You ever.

5502
02:19:45,801 --> 02:19:46,041
You ever.

5503
02:19:46,041 --> 02:19:48,170
You know what team follow
back is from twitter.

5504
02:19:48,860 --> 02:19:50,990
you could have seen the hashtag.

5505
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:51,973
What does that mean?

5506
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:53,121
It may have changed,

5507
02:19:53,121 --> 02:19:55,910
but essentially I follow
you follow me that way.

5508
02:19:55,911 --> 02:19:56,980
You'll see some people have,

5509
02:19:57,030 --> 02:19:59,830
they'll be following 100,000 people
and there'll be followed by a hunt,

5510
02:19:59,860 --> 02:20:00,020
you know,

5511
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:03,800
90,000 people and then they walk
around bragging about how he got 90,000

5512
02:20:03,801 --> 02:20:04,551
followers and it's like,

5513
02:20:04,551 --> 02:20:05,384
well hold on.

5514
02:20:05,860 --> 02:20:07,940
Like you just have an agreement with them.

5515
02:20:07,941 --> 02:20:08,774
You're not influential.

5516
02:20:09,080 --> 02:20:11,330
It was a trick that people would
do to inflate their numbers,

5517
02:20:11,510 --> 02:20:12,920
but those numbers are legitimate.

5518
02:20:12,921 --> 02:20:14,350
If you do post something on twitter,

5519
02:20:14,420 --> 02:20:15,830
it will reach 90,000.

5520
02:20:15,860 --> 02:20:16,281
Absolutely.

5521
02:20:16,281 --> 02:20:17,330
So there's definitely merit in.

5522
02:20:17,660 --> 02:20:17,991
Oh yeah,

5523
02:20:17,991 --> 02:20:18,111
yeah,

5524
02:20:18,111 --> 02:20:18,330
yeah.

5525
02:20:18,330 --> 02:20:18,440
It,

5526
02:20:18,440 --> 02:20:18,571
it,

5527
02:20:18,571 --> 02:20:18,860
it,

5528
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:19,050
I,

5529
02:20:19,050 --> 02:20:19,701
I've seen it work.

5530
02:20:19,701 --> 02:20:20,540
I've seen it translate,

5531
02:20:20,960 --> 02:20:21,770
but it's just a,

5532
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:22,040
it's a,

5533
02:20:22,040 --> 02:20:22,641
it's a trick.

5534
02:20:22,641 --> 02:20:24,140
It's a trick of getting the system.

5535
02:20:24,440 --> 02:20:24,740
Yeah,

5536
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:26,450
there's a lot of sneakiness going on,

5537
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:26,661
but.

5538
02:20:26,661 --> 02:20:26,901
Well,

5539
02:20:26,901 --> 02:20:28,640
I have fake twitter followers.

5540
02:20:29,460 --> 02:20:30,291
I didn't pay for them,

5541
02:20:30,291 --> 02:20:32,210
but I've found them through one of those.

5542
02:20:32,211 --> 02:20:34,220
How many of your twitter
followers are fake?

5543
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:34,880
Those,

5544
02:20:34,880 --> 02:20:35,810
those aren't so good.

5545
02:20:35,990 --> 02:20:36,261
Yeah.

5546
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:36,441
What,

5547
02:20:36,441 --> 02:20:37,161
what does that mean?

5548
02:20:37,161 --> 02:20:37,994
Is it like.

5549
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,670
So many of the people don't engage?

5550
02:20:40,910 --> 02:20:41,990
I think that's what it's based on.

5551
02:20:41,991 --> 02:20:42,231
Right?

5552
02:20:42,231 --> 02:20:43,400
And that doesn't make sense.

5553
02:20:43,510 --> 02:20:43,661
Well,

5554
02:20:43,661 --> 02:20:47,060
it doesn't make sense also because
what if they just are logged in?

5555
02:20:47,061 --> 02:20:47,810
They just read.

5556
02:20:47,810 --> 02:20:48,410
Exactly.

5557
02:20:48,410 --> 02:20:49,640
And that's most twitter users,

5558
02:20:49,670 --> 02:20:49,851
right?

5559
02:20:49,851 --> 02:20:51,950
Which is still engaging.

5560
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:54,710
You're just not going two ways.

5561
02:20:54,740 --> 02:20:57,770
So that's one of the big problems with
tracking fake accounts is that it's just

5562
02:20:57,890 --> 02:20:58,760
someone's opinion.

5563
02:20:59,330 --> 02:21:00,470
They're most hot.

5564
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:01,461
So there's two things.

5565
02:21:01,461 --> 02:21:05,240
Most high profile accounts will read is
having a ton of fake followers because

5566
02:21:05,241 --> 02:21:07,790
people will sign up just to follow you
and read what you have to say because

5567
02:21:07,791 --> 02:21:08,660
they want your feet.

5568
02:21:08,730 --> 02:21:10,010
They want do they want joe,

5569
02:21:10,011 --> 02:21:10,431
they want,

5570
02:21:10,431 --> 02:21:10,850
you know,

5571
02:21:10,850 --> 02:21:12,950
bill clinton or whoever and they
wouldn't have that feed of people.

5572
02:21:12,951 --> 02:21:13,220
They don't,

5573
02:21:13,220 --> 02:21:15,980
they don't interact and so
then they're labeled fake.

5574
02:21:16,340 --> 02:21:19,580
The other thing is when
people make fake bot farms,

5575
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:22,910
they purposefully will follow
people like you so they look real.

5576
02:21:23,360 --> 02:21:24,680
So you do get fake ones.

5577
02:21:24,740 --> 02:21:25,340
Sure.

5578
02:21:25,340 --> 02:21:25,911
And it's hard to know,

5579
02:21:25,911 --> 02:21:26,090
you know,

5580
02:21:26,090 --> 02:21:28,430
people point to politicians and always
like to claim their fake followers,

5581
02:21:28,431 --> 02:21:29,264
but I'll tell you what,

5582
02:21:29,660 --> 02:21:30,050
you could.

5583
02:21:30,050 --> 02:21:32,390
You could easily go online and
buy followers for someone else.

5584
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:33,310
It happened.

5585
02:21:33,310 --> 02:21:34,590
I believe this happened to the daily dot.

5586
02:21:34,800 --> 02:21:35,610
I say I believe alex,

5587
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:36,680
I don't wanna get sued just so you know,

5588
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:41,000
the daily.one day jump like 30,000
twitter followers and had to put out a

5589
02:21:41,001 --> 02:21:42,890
message saying someone
bought followers for us.

5590
02:21:42,890 --> 02:21:43,671
We didn't do thiS.

5591
02:21:43,671 --> 02:21:45,260
We are actively trying
to remove them right now.

5592
02:21:45,261 --> 02:21:47,750
It's difficult because you don't know
who's real and who's fake after it

5593
02:21:47,751 --> 02:21:48,584
happens.

5594
02:21:48,950 --> 02:21:49,251
Man.

5595
02:21:49,251 --> 02:21:49,461
There's,

5596
02:21:49,461 --> 02:21:49,960
there's tears.

5597
02:21:49,960 --> 02:21:51,120
You possIbly remove them though.

5598
02:21:51,121 --> 02:21:55,010
You'd have to find out what the timeline
was and how quickly they came in and go

5599
02:21:55,011 --> 02:21:56,220
to each individual account.

5600
02:21:56,221 --> 02:21:56,840
Yeah.

5601
02:21:56,840 --> 02:21:57,590
Well there's,

5602
02:21:57,590 --> 02:22:00,320
there's a thing that I think there's an
app that allows you to purge what they

5603
02:22:00,321 --> 02:22:01,154
view as fake.

5604
02:22:01,310 --> 02:22:03,680
You can block and unblock them and
they're not following it anymore.

5605
02:22:03,800 --> 02:22:05,270
But it's tough,

5606
02:22:05,271 --> 02:22:05,511
man.

5607
02:22:05,511 --> 02:22:05,761
They're,

5608
02:22:05,761 --> 02:22:06,060
they're,

5609
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:07,460
they're terrifying ways to,

5610
02:22:07,461 --> 02:22:08,294
uh,

5611
02:22:08,450 --> 02:22:08,691
you know,

5612
02:22:08,691 --> 02:22:10,820
I mentioned buying views will
destroy your youtube channel

5613
02:22:12,320 --> 02:22:13,580
because youtube knows their fake,

5614
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:14,180
right?

5615
02:22:14,180 --> 02:22:14,391
Yeah.

5616
02:22:14,391 --> 02:22:17,750
So think about what you can do to
other people if you have three grand,

5617
02:22:17,751 --> 02:22:21,420
do you want to damage
by their youtube vibe,

5618
02:22:21,430 --> 02:22:24,290
by views for them attributed to
them and get them in trouble.

5619
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:28,560
But I will say for people like you and um,

5620
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:29,431
to an extent,

5621
02:22:29,431 --> 02:22:32,430
people like me because I have contacts
at google that wouldn't work on us.

5622
02:22:32,860 --> 02:22:33,900
I just make a phone call and say,

5623
02:22:33,901 --> 02:22:34,830
I just wanted you to know and they go up,

5624
02:22:34,831 --> 02:22:35,664
no problem.

5625
02:22:35,850 --> 02:22:38,040
But let's say you're somebody
with 100,000 subscribers,

5626
02:22:38,430 --> 02:22:38,701
you know,

5627
02:22:38,701 --> 02:22:39,481
you're making a living,

5628
02:22:39,481 --> 02:22:40,440
you've got a career on youtube,

5629
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:42,720
but you don't have a manager with youtube,

5630
02:22:42,721 --> 02:22:44,040
you don't have contacts with google.

5631
02:22:44,490 --> 02:22:45,660
If someone attacks your account,

5632
02:22:46,170 --> 02:22:47,003
you're out,

5633
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:47,400
you know,

5634
02:22:47,400 --> 02:22:47,650
they,

5635
02:22:47,650 --> 02:22:48,483
they can just do that.

5636
02:22:48,970 --> 02:22:49,650
Scary.

5637
02:22:49,650 --> 02:22:50,483
Yeah.

5638
02:22:50,640 --> 02:22:50,851
Yeah,

5639
02:22:50,851 --> 02:22:51,684
man.

5640
02:22:52,440 --> 02:22:53,280
Jeff bezos.

5641
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:54,181
Oh yeah.

5642
02:22:54,181 --> 02:22:55,014
Jeff bezos,

5643
02:22:55,100 --> 02:22:55,421
man.

5644
02:22:55,421 --> 02:22:57,360
Crazy is the national inquirer.

5645
02:22:57,840 --> 02:22:59,040
Allegedly we should say,

5646
02:22:59,070 --> 02:22:59,903
allegedly,

5647
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:01,500
I believe allegedly,

5648
02:23:01,530 --> 02:23:02,280
I don't want to get sued.

5649
02:23:02,280 --> 02:23:03,960
Tried to extort him.

5650
02:23:04,530 --> 02:23:08,610
And it's about the jamal [inaudible]
shogi investigation from the Washington

5651
02:23:08,611 --> 02:23:08,971
post.

5652
02:23:08,971 --> 02:23:10,170
it's all connected to that.

5653
02:23:10,320 --> 02:23:10,750
I read,

5654
02:23:10,750 --> 02:23:12,000
I read a bit about it.

5655
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:12,480
Um,

5656
02:23:12,480 --> 02:23:15,750
I started reading more when ronan farrow
came out and claimed that they went to

5657
02:23:15,751 --> 02:23:16,584
him too.

5658
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:19,770
so I'm not as versed like I haven't read.

5659
02:23:20,070 --> 02:23:21,300
I read through the day they,

5660
02:23:21,370 --> 02:23:21,991
meaning the inquiry.

5661
02:23:21,991 --> 02:23:22,491
The inquiry.

5662
02:23:22,491 --> 02:23:22,561
Yeah.

5663
02:23:22,561 --> 02:23:23,250
Ronan farrow.

5664
02:23:23,250 --> 02:23:23,700
um,

5665
02:23:23,700 --> 02:23:24,181
it was a store,

5666
02:23:24,181 --> 02:23:26,250
I think it was from the
week where I run in.

5667
02:23:26,251 --> 02:23:28,080
Pharaoh says that they approached him and,

5668
02:23:28,081 --> 02:23:28,914
and you know,

5669
02:23:28,920 --> 02:23:30,030
put pressure on him as well.

5670
02:23:30,620 --> 02:23:30,810
But,

5671
02:23:30,810 --> 02:23:31,200
you know,

5672
02:23:31,200 --> 02:23:33,360
the interesting thing is
when I read that story,

5673
02:23:33,361 --> 02:23:34,480
I kind of laughed because I was like,

5674
02:23:34,500 --> 02:23:36,540
remember gawker member when they public,

5675
02:23:36,541 --> 02:23:37,500
when they outdid peter teal,

5676
02:23:37,501 --> 02:23:38,460
and then yes,

5677
02:23:38,570 --> 02:23:39,210
you know,

5678
02:23:39,210 --> 02:23:40,470
a hulk hogan,

5679
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:41,630
like,

5680
02:23:41,630 --> 02:23:42,001
you know,

5681
02:23:42,001 --> 02:23:44,790
these people are really brave to go up
against billionaires like this and try

5682
02:23:44,791 --> 02:23:45,810
and drag them.

5683
02:23:46,040 --> 02:23:46,620
Yeah,

5684
02:23:46,620 --> 02:23:47,970
I'll also point out it's kind of scary.

5685
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:50,730
You live in a world where a billionaire
can destroy your company because they're

5686
02:23:50,731 --> 02:23:51,564
angry at you.

5687
02:23:52,020 --> 02:23:52,730
But my,

5688
02:23:52,730 --> 02:23:57,450
it's also kind of scary that they can use
this to extort him so that he doesn't,

5689
02:23:57,630 --> 02:24:02,070
he takes the Washington post or attempting
to get them to take the Washington

5690
02:24:02,071 --> 02:24:05,970
post and remove a legitimate news
story about an actual murder.

5691
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,410
I don't trust the Washington post,

5692
02:24:07,411 --> 02:24:08,130
but you know,

5693
02:24:08,130 --> 02:24:08,963
that's an aside.

5694
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:10,770
That Is like,

5695
02:24:11,090 --> 02:24:11,923
if you get it,

5696
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:13,643
you know,

5697
02:24:14,490 --> 02:24:15,960
when I look at what the
national enquirer did,

5698
02:24:16,590 --> 02:24:18,360
it just reminds me of what the media does.

5699
02:24:18,960 --> 02:24:20,760
They know what they can do
and they know how to do it.

5700
02:24:20,820 --> 02:24:22,500
The media is influenced its power.

5701
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:23,310
You know,

5702
02:24:23,310 --> 02:24:23,670
uh,

5703
02:24:23,670 --> 02:24:24,480
brands,

5704
02:24:24,480 --> 02:24:25,313
they're scared,

5705
02:24:25,410 --> 02:24:26,243
they're scared.

5706
02:24:26,370 --> 02:24:28,860
So you look at what happens with some
of these twitter accounts that will lead

5707
02:24:28,861 --> 02:24:31,890
campaigns where they encourage all
their followers to send emails.

5708
02:24:32,510 --> 02:24:32,960
It's,

5709
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:33,400
it's,

5710
02:24:33,400 --> 02:24:35,340
it's not the same as
black male by no means,

5711
02:24:35,730 --> 02:24:37,560
but when you know
there's an attack factor,

5712
02:24:37,740 --> 02:24:38,100
like,

5713
02:24:38,100 --> 02:24:38,880
you know,

5714
02:24:38,880 --> 02:24:40,440
what does that wild sardines company,

5715
02:24:40,620 --> 02:24:42,990
they don't want to deal with
a brigade from activists.

5716
02:24:43,320 --> 02:24:46,800
You tweeted them your fence with them
and they immediately cancel on your show

5717
02:24:46,801 --> 02:24:48,960
and they disvalue unless you do something,

5718
02:24:48,961 --> 02:24:50,010
unless you say something,

5719
02:24:50,011 --> 02:24:51,090
unless you disavow something,

5720
02:24:51,780 --> 02:24:52,051
you know.

5721
02:24:52,051 --> 02:24:53,190
So granted,

5722
02:24:53,191 --> 02:24:54,390
It's leaps and bounds worse when,

5723
02:24:54,420 --> 02:24:54,750
when,

5724
02:24:54,750 --> 02:24:56,490
when the national inquirer allegedly,

5725
02:24:57,120 --> 02:24:57,450
you know,

5726
02:24:57,450 --> 02:24:59,370
tries to extort Jeff Bezos.

5727
02:24:59,530 --> 02:25:01,230
The craziest thing about it is allegedly,

5728
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:01,891
again,

5729
02:25:01,891 --> 02:25:04,680
allegedly that the investigator,

5730
02:25:04,681 --> 02:25:05,520
I think his name is becker,

5731
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:10,770
was entertaining the possibility that a
government entity intercepted the texts,

5732
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:12,780
the nude selfies from those.

5733
02:25:13,170 --> 02:25:15,990
But I did see another journalist
tweet that they're not entertaining,

5734
02:25:15,991 --> 02:25:16,890
that they're not pursuing it.

5735
02:25:16,910 --> 02:25:17,611
It was just a thought.

5736
02:25:17,611 --> 02:25:18,660
So maybe it's not real.

5737
02:25:18,750 --> 02:25:18,871
Well,

5738
02:25:18,871 --> 02:25:21,510
part of the thought was that
his girlfriend's brother,

5739
02:25:21,511 --> 02:25:24,100
who a trump supporter might
might've somehow or another got

5740
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,170
screen grabs of her phone.

5741
02:25:26,890 --> 02:25:28,300
It was really interesting when bezos said,

5742
02:25:28,330 --> 02:25:32,570
because he owns the post people per
people presume he's their enemy and that's

5743
02:25:32,610 --> 02:25:32,810
it.

5744
02:25:32,810 --> 02:25:35,650
That's another point I would bring up
to when it comes to like banning Alex

5745
02:25:35,650 --> 02:25:35,980
Jones,

5746
02:25:35,980 --> 02:25:38,590
just because someone's reporting something
doesn't mean they're advocating for

5747
02:25:38,591 --> 02:25:39,424
it,

5748
02:25:39,490 --> 02:25:40,540
but sometimes they are.

5749
02:25:40,541 --> 02:25:42,550
It's like you've got to
understand the nuance in that.

5750
02:25:42,810 --> 02:25:43,160
Yeah.

5751
02:25:43,160 --> 02:25:44,050
But yeah,

5752
02:25:44,051 --> 02:25:47,020
I mean bezos is probably not
the person you'd want to target.

5753
02:25:47,021 --> 02:25:49,930
I could you imagine what would happen if
bayzos showed up at the Washington post

5754
02:25:49,931 --> 02:25:50,231
and said,

5755
02:25:50,231 --> 02:25:51,064
guys killed the story.

5756
02:25:51,670 --> 02:25:53,400
Every journalist would tweet it based.

5757
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:54,610
I'll shut up and just killed our story.

5758
02:25:54,640 --> 02:25:54,920
Yeah.

5759
02:25:54,920 --> 02:25:56,340
It's almost impossible.

5760
02:25:56,370 --> 02:25:56,560
So,

5761
02:25:56,560 --> 02:25:57,550
so unrealistic,

5762
02:25:57,551 --> 02:25:58,720
but maybe there's more to it.

5763
02:25:59,110 --> 02:25:59,650
I mean,

5764
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:00,050
yeah,

5765
02:26:00,050 --> 02:26:00,211
the,

5766
02:26:00,211 --> 02:26:01,120
the real,

5767
02:26:01,660 --> 02:26:02,330
the,

5768
02:26:02,330 --> 02:26:05,140
and this is the big
conspiracy theory was that,

5769
02:26:05,141 --> 02:26:05,710
you know,

5770
02:26:05,710 --> 02:26:07,330
trump always calls him jeff bozo.

5771
02:26:07,720 --> 02:26:08,061
Right,

5772
02:26:08,061 --> 02:26:08,280
right,

5773
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:08,441
right.

5774
02:26:08,441 --> 02:26:11,860
Someone from that side
is involved in this.

5775
02:26:12,130 --> 02:26:12,570
Yeah.

5776
02:26:12,570 --> 02:26:13,060
And you know,

5777
02:26:13,060 --> 02:26:15,170
because trump's always had this
relationship with the inquirer.

5778
02:26:15,860 --> 02:26:16,430
Big concern.

5779
02:26:16,430 --> 02:26:16,521
Yeah.

5780
02:26:16,521 --> 02:26:16,651
Right,

5781
02:26:16,651 --> 02:26:17,230
right.

5782
02:26:17,230 --> 02:26:17,471
Yeah.

5783
02:26:17,471 --> 02:26:18,760
so I don't,

5784
02:26:18,761 --> 02:26:19,121
I don't know.

5785
02:26:19,121 --> 02:26:19,570
I guess I,

5786
02:26:19,570 --> 02:26:20,080
you know,

5787
02:26:20,080 --> 02:26:23,680
this is relatively new story and I've
been here so I don't know as much about it

5788
02:26:23,681 --> 02:26:24,410
as I probably should,

5789
02:26:24,410 --> 02:26:28,810
which just shows you how crazy digital
media is it digital things like sending

5790
02:26:28,811 --> 02:26:30,910
things through the air and it's just

5791
02:26:32,470 --> 02:26:34,300
that people can get intercepted.

5792
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:35,403
That's whY,

5793
02:26:35,640 --> 02:26:35,880
you know,

5794
02:26:35,880 --> 02:26:36,070
when I,

5795
02:26:36,070 --> 02:26:38,050
when I mentioned earlier
the potential for civil war,

5796
02:26:38,051 --> 02:26:39,010
like we don't know what
it could look like.

5797
02:26:39,011 --> 02:26:39,790
This could be it,

5798
02:26:39,790 --> 02:26:41,890
it could be special
interests using information.

5799
02:26:41,891 --> 02:26:43,020
It's the infOrmation war,

5800
02:26:43,060 --> 02:26:43,240
you know,

5801
02:26:43,240 --> 02:26:44,200
things that people have talked about.

5802
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:46,060
I was thinking about this a while ago.

5803
02:26:46,061 --> 02:26:46,301
It's like,

5804
02:26:46,301 --> 02:26:46,541
man,

5805
02:26:46,541 --> 02:26:46,871
why?

5806
02:26:46,871 --> 02:26:48,940
Why did people shoot
each other 100 years ago?

5807
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:49,630
I mean still do,

5808
02:26:49,630 --> 02:26:50,380
but like,

5809
02:26:50,380 --> 02:26:50,591
you know,

5810
02:26:50,591 --> 02:26:51,040
world war ii,

5811
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:51,670
why are they running it?

5812
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:53,620
Because they wanted to gain control.

5813
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:54,220
They wanted,

5814
02:26:54,220 --> 02:26:58,330
they wanted to centralize power or
they wanted to push an ideology or a

5815
02:26:58,331 --> 02:26:59,650
government or expand their power.

5816
02:27:00,340 --> 02:27:01,450
You don't need to shoot
somebody to do that.

5817
02:27:01,900 --> 02:27:05,230
You just need to convince them you're
right or you need to get them to fight

5818
02:27:05,231 --> 02:27:06,064
each other.

5819
02:27:06,160 --> 02:27:07,480
So I think it's fair to say,

5820
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:07,781
yeah,

5821
02:27:07,781 --> 02:27:09,250
the russians are absolutely
screwing with us,

5822
02:27:09,580 --> 02:27:12,580
but we've learned through if you trust
the reporting and it's hard to know

5823
02:27:12,581 --> 02:27:14,650
what's real or not that
the russian campaigns,

5824
02:27:14,651 --> 02:27:16,510
we're not only promoting trump supporters,

5825
02:27:16,570 --> 02:27:17,920
but they were promoting
black lives matter.

5826
02:27:18,370 --> 02:27:20,110
Why gIve him to fight?

5827
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:20,441
Well,

5828
02:27:20,441 --> 02:27:21,490
they weren't just doing that.

5829
02:27:21,491 --> 02:27:26,200
There's a fantastic podcast that sam
harris released recently with a woman.

5830
02:27:26,201 --> 02:27:26,441
Let me,

5831
02:27:26,441 --> 02:27:29,920
let me get her name so I can
see if you can find a jamie.

5832
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:32,080
It's called the information war.

5833
02:27:32,110 --> 02:27:33,730
That's the name of the podcast.

5834
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:34,900
But uh,

5835
02:27:34,900 --> 02:27:35,680
they were,

5836
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:40,000
they were doIng all sorts
of different things,

5837
02:27:40,180 --> 02:27:43,030
like not just trying to.

5838
02:27:43,370 --> 02:27:44,660
Rene de arrest,

5839
02:27:44,920 --> 02:27:49,270
teresita and I'm working on getting
her down here soon that they were.

5840
02:27:49,271 --> 02:27:52,420
They also had like a Texas culture.

5841
02:27:52,650 --> 02:27:54,700
They had trans rights.

5842
02:27:54,701 --> 02:27:55,230
They have,

5843
02:27:55,230 --> 02:27:55,600
they,

5844
02:27:55,600 --> 02:28:00,130
they even organize facebook campaigns
where they had a pro Texas group and a pro

5845
02:28:00,131 --> 02:28:02,300
muslim group meet across
the street from each other.

5846
02:28:02,301 --> 02:28:03,070
Yeah,

5847
02:28:03,070 --> 02:28:03,671
I mean they're,

5848
02:28:03,671 --> 02:28:06,130
they're sowing seeds of descent,

5849
02:28:06,160 --> 02:28:08,800
like organizing it and I think I,

5850
02:28:08,801 --> 02:28:11,500
I'd be willing to entertain
the possibility that what
we call the culture war

5851
02:28:11,501 --> 02:28:13,990
today was seated specifically
by special interests,

5852
02:28:14,020 --> 02:28:14,853
potentially Russia.

5853
02:28:15,610 --> 02:28:16,443
Nothing we can do about it.

5854
02:28:16,630 --> 02:28:17,410
It's done.

5855
02:28:17,410 --> 02:28:17,661
You know,

5856
02:28:17,661 --> 02:28:17,801
when,

5857
02:28:17,801 --> 02:28:18,040
when,

5858
02:28:18,040 --> 02:28:19,660
when people adopt an ideology,

5859
02:28:20,230 --> 02:28:22,040
you can easily that and some people

5860
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:23,390
refuse to cross that divide,

5861
02:28:23,780 --> 02:28:24,080
you know?

5862
02:28:24,080 --> 02:28:24,261
Yeah.

5863
02:28:24,261 --> 02:28:27,530
But it's just so funny how many
different ways they were attacking this.

5864
02:28:27,531 --> 02:28:29,560
They had a blue lives matter groups,

5865
02:28:29,670 --> 02:28:31,130
black lives matter groups,

5866
02:28:31,131 --> 02:28:34,160
and they put people at odds with each
other and one of the big ones that they

5867
02:28:34,161 --> 02:28:35,570
did was they,

5868
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:40,670
they targeted african americans and we're
trying to get them to vote for anyone

5869
02:28:40,671 --> 02:28:41,504
other than hillary.

5870
02:28:41,660 --> 02:28:45,360
And this is like an engineered campaign
that jill stein's our vote and we like,

5871
02:28:45,361 --> 02:28:46,880
we can't vote for hillary.

5872
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:48,710
Like hillary does not support us.

5873
02:28:48,711 --> 02:28:49,820
We can't vote for hillary.

5874
02:28:49,821 --> 02:28:51,260
And so it made it very tribal.

5875
02:28:51,370 --> 02:28:52,120
The first thing we have,

5876
02:28:52,120 --> 02:28:57,120
we have to assume is that it was effective
and what we view in the culture war

5877
02:28:57,281 --> 02:29:00,430
was exacerbated by these campaigns.

5878
02:29:00,850 --> 02:29:01,271
We don't know,

5879
02:29:01,271 --> 02:29:04,180
we don't know to what extent they
had an influence over the us,

5880
02:29:04,510 --> 02:29:08,230
but I will say I think it's fair to point
out they play a role and then we can

5881
02:29:08,231 --> 02:29:08,950
see what happens.

5882
02:29:08,950 --> 02:29:09,783
Charlottesville,

5883
02:29:10,010 --> 02:29:10,320
you know,

5884
02:29:10,320 --> 02:29:14,950
where we can see the dramatic escalation
where you end up with some crazy guy

5885
02:29:15,190 --> 02:29:19,030
associated with white nationalism
ramming a car into a bunch of protesters.

5886
02:29:19,550 --> 02:29:19,790
It's,

5887
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:19,960
you know,

5888
02:29:19,960 --> 02:29:23,620
people get riled up to a point as a
really great video called this video will

5889
02:29:23,621 --> 02:29:25,060
make you angry by,

5890
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:25,660
um,

5891
02:29:25,660 --> 02:29:29,950
cgp grey where he talks
about how these groups,

5892
02:29:30,250 --> 02:29:32,110
they argue amongst each other,

5893
02:29:32,380 --> 02:29:33,460
not against each other.

5894
02:29:34,030 --> 02:29:36,610
They make each other angry By
posting images of the other,

5895
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:37,160
you know,

5896
02:29:37,160 --> 02:29:38,110
there's certain subreddits.

5897
02:29:38,111 --> 02:29:39,910
Why I don't want to start a brigade,

5898
02:29:39,911 --> 02:29:43,300
but they'll post memes nonstop
attacking a particular politician.

5899
02:29:43,720 --> 02:29:45,880
They're not arguing with
the left or the right.

5900
02:29:46,360 --> 02:29:49,180
They're arguing to themselves
about what's wrong with the other.

5901
02:29:49,590 --> 02:29:51,760
And so these groups grow
and get angrier and angrier.

5902
02:29:51,880 --> 02:29:53,380
And then when they finally
meet in the real world,

5903
02:29:53,381 --> 02:29:54,520
you get extreme violence.

5904
02:29:55,210 --> 02:29:56,860
So it's very,

5905
02:29:56,950 --> 02:30:00,100
it's very possible to seed those
communities and rile people up,

5906
02:30:00,470 --> 02:30:01,360
push these things.

5907
02:30:01,530 --> 02:30:02,250
Yeah.

5908
02:30:02,250 --> 02:30:03,210
well it's also,

5909
02:30:03,700 --> 02:30:07,110
it seems pretty straightforward how to
manipulate them and how to appeal to

5910
02:30:07,111 --> 02:30:10,890
their tribal nature and it's
terrifying how easy it is.

5911
02:30:10,950 --> 02:30:11,850
Yeah man.

5912
02:30:11,900 --> 02:30:12,151
But you know,

5913
02:30:12,151 --> 02:30:14,790
the store is so terrifying
how few people are aware that,

5914
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:19,530
I mean there's a lot of these really
toxic pages that you'll find that they're

5915
02:30:19,531 --> 02:30:20,970
commenting on things that are,

5916
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:24,270
whether it's instagram or
twitter or whatever they're not,

5917
02:30:24,570 --> 02:30:26,460
they're not really who you think they are

5918
02:30:26,730 --> 02:30:27,690
and what ends up happening.

5919
02:30:28,260 --> 02:30:29,940
The average person say on twitter,

5920
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:33,000
we'll look at their mentions and
see 10 tweets where they say,

5921
02:30:33,150 --> 02:30:34,650
you shouldn't talk about this anymore.

5922
02:30:34,651 --> 02:30:35,400
How dare you.

5923
02:30:35,400 --> 02:30:38,610
And they'll assume everyone when
in reality could be one person,

5924
02:30:39,090 --> 02:30:39,930
but it works well.

5925
02:30:39,931 --> 02:30:40,360
And this is,

5926
02:30:40,360 --> 02:30:44,070
this is what gets companies to run
away from sponsoring shows and stuff.

5927
02:30:44,100 --> 02:30:45,570
They think everyone's attacking them.

5928
02:30:46,290 --> 02:30:46,951
It could be one person.

5929
02:30:46,951 --> 02:30:48,090
Where do you think this goes?

5930
02:30:48,210 --> 02:30:48,571
If you're,

5931
02:30:48,571 --> 02:30:50,940
if you're looking aT this
like this is fairly new,

5932
02:30:50,941 --> 02:30:51,211
right?

5933
02:30:51,211 --> 02:30:54,330
all of this stuff is fairly
new and and really kind of a,

5934
02:30:54,390 --> 02:30:58,190
this is uncharted territory in terms of
how to navigate this stuff and they're

5935
02:30:58,410 --> 02:31:01,920
sort of figuring out what the
influences are as we go along.

5936
02:31:01,950 --> 02:31:02,783
And again,

5937
02:31:02,790 --> 02:31:04,140
10 years ago this didn't even exist.

5938
02:31:04,141 --> 02:31:05,760
So this is all all new.

5939
02:31:05,790 --> 02:31:06,690
Where do you think it's going?

5940
02:31:06,770 --> 02:31:07,300
Usd.

5941
02:31:07,300 --> 02:31:08,133
Stabilization,

5942
02:31:08,220 --> 02:31:08,861
real and edit.

5943
02:31:08,861 --> 02:31:09,650
Dangerous.

5944
02:31:09,650 --> 02:31:10,483
Dangerous level.

5945
02:31:11,990 --> 02:31:13,850
So patrion,

5946
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:14,600
right?

5947
02:31:14,600 --> 02:31:15,111
It's the,

5948
02:31:15,111 --> 02:31:16,940
it's the independent economy.

5949
02:31:16,941 --> 02:31:17,751
If you're a youtuber,

5950
02:31:17,751 --> 02:31:18,680
if you're a podcaster,

5951
02:31:18,710 --> 02:31:19,530
if you're an,

5952
02:31:19,530 --> 02:31:20,790
if you're a cost play or whatever.

5953
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:25,260
Well they decided to band Some people
for reasons that don't make sense.

5954
02:31:25,261 --> 02:31:27,180
Like sargon didn't violate the tos,

5955
02:31:27,181 --> 02:31:27,870
but they banned in many ways.

5956
02:31:27,870 --> 02:31:29,140
So sargon goes to subscribe.

5957
02:31:29,141 --> 02:31:33,150
Star activists then decide sargon and
shouldn't be allowed to make money,

5958
02:31:33,151 --> 02:31:33,984
period.

5959
02:31:33,990 --> 02:31:34,830
So they start,

5960
02:31:35,010 --> 02:31:35,430
you know,

5961
02:31:35,430 --> 02:31:36,280
campaigning unsubscribed,

5962
02:31:36,330 --> 02:31:36,571
star,

5963
02:31:36,571 --> 02:31:37,590
subscribes to our loses,

5964
02:31:37,591 --> 02:31:41,460
access to paypal and stripe so it
can no longer process payments.

5965
02:31:41,461 --> 02:31:43,470
Who made that decision to remove it?

5966
02:31:43,830 --> 02:31:44,940
Most likely pay pal,

5967
02:31:44,941 --> 02:31:45,271
I believe.

5968
02:31:45,271 --> 02:31:46,410
I believe they sent on the website.

5969
02:31:46,440 --> 02:31:47,060
Paypal,

5970
02:31:47,060 --> 02:31:47,340
you know,

5971
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:48,690
because what happens is people get scared,

5972
02:31:48,720 --> 02:31:48,880
oh,

5973
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:50,130
we don't want to be involved in this.

5974
02:31:50,580 --> 02:31:51,540
While something else happened,

5975
02:31:51,660 --> 02:31:53,820
subscribes are reactivated there.

5976
02:31:53,821 --> 02:31:54,990
They've got new payment processor,

5977
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,860
which means we've seen
the budding off of an,

5978
02:31:57,940 --> 02:31:58,280
of a,

5979
02:31:58,280 --> 02:31:59,430
of a mirror economy,

5980
02:31:59,760 --> 02:32:00,690
which is dangerous.

5981
02:32:01,320 --> 02:32:05,850
The fact that americanS in general
can't share the same platform and had to

5982
02:32:05,851 --> 02:32:06,810
create an alternate,

5983
02:32:06,990 --> 02:32:10,110
an alternate that had to be
supported by separate means.

5984
02:32:11,100 --> 02:32:12,600
If this continues in that direction,

5985
02:32:12,660 --> 02:32:15,660
we're going to end up with tons of
systems that operate for only certain

5986
02:32:15,661 --> 02:32:16,650
political factions.

5987
02:32:17,270 --> 02:32:17,580
jack,

5988
02:32:17,580 --> 02:32:18,140
uh,

5989
02:32:18,140 --> 02:32:18,960
jack conte,

5990
02:32:18,960 --> 02:32:19,310
the page,

5991
02:32:19,310 --> 02:32:22,410
the ceo of patriot said to I believe cnbc.

5992
02:32:22,411 --> 02:32:24,780
You can't say anything
you want in the world.

5993
02:32:25,290 --> 02:32:27,700
What does what I say in the
world had to do with what you,

5994
02:32:27,750 --> 02:32:28,740
what service you provide.

5995
02:32:29,340 --> 02:32:29,581
Now,

5996
02:32:29,581 --> 02:32:30,330
by all means,

5997
02:32:30,330 --> 02:32:30,991
if you want to bend them,

5998
02:32:30,991 --> 02:32:31,824
you can,

5999
02:32:31,890 --> 02:32:34,110
but you can then see the
adopting of ideology.

6000
02:32:34,530 --> 02:32:38,280
Someone posted a funny comment accompany
that refuses to sell water to a

6001
02:32:38,281 --> 02:32:40,830
dehydrated man in the desert
because they think the wrong thing.

6002
02:32:41,340 --> 02:32:42,240
But then what happens?

6003
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:46,920
Different companies emerge and you'd
get tribes that are divided not only by

6004
02:32:46,950 --> 02:32:47,731
their ideology,

6005
02:32:47,731 --> 02:32:50,130
but literally they're unable
to communicate with each other.

6006
02:32:50,880 --> 02:32:52,410
That can only lead to one thing.

6007
02:32:52,950 --> 02:32:54,180
The tribes getting physical,

6008
02:32:54,690 --> 02:32:55,351
charlottesville,

6009
02:32:55,351 --> 02:32:56,990
portland ball to a.

6010
02:32:56,991 --> 02:32:59,370
I'm a boston berkeley,

6011
02:32:59,970 --> 02:33:00,960
san bernardino.

6012
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:02,640
These various instances where the.

6013
02:33:02,820 --> 02:33:04,290
They've claShed and bashed each other.

6014
02:33:04,291 --> 02:33:05,190
People have been killed.

6015
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:06,990
Some people show up with guns.

6016
02:33:08,190 --> 02:33:09,023
I think that's.

6017
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:10,070
I don't I,

6018
02:33:10,070 --> 02:33:10,950
I've got to be honest.

6019
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:13,380
I don't think there's a way to fix it.

6020
02:33:13,440 --> 02:33:14,550
I don't really.

6021
02:33:14,600 --> 02:33:15,301
There is a,

6022
02:33:15,301 --> 02:33:16,470
a hilarious comment.

6023
02:33:16,720 --> 02:33:17,131
I'm sorry.

6024
02:33:17,131 --> 02:33:21,750
Comic programmer humor on reddit and
they said when you talk to an airplane

6025
02:33:21,751 --> 02:33:23,550
engineer or mechanic,

6026
02:33:23,551 --> 02:33:23,880
they say,

6027
02:33:23,880 --> 02:33:24,181
oh yeah,

6028
02:33:24,181 --> 02:33:25,950
these things are engineered safety.

6029
02:33:25,951 --> 02:33:26,141
You're,

6030
02:33:26,141 --> 02:33:28,140
you're more likely to get new car
accident and died in an airplane.

6031
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:28,831
You know,

6032
02:33:28,831 --> 02:33:30,300
when you talk to electrical engineers,

6033
02:33:30,330 --> 02:33:30,691
oh god,

6034
02:33:30,691 --> 02:33:33,000
we've got so many redundancies
that the system will fail.

6035
02:33:33,001 --> 02:33:33,834
If you know,

6036
02:33:33,930 --> 02:33:34,980
when you talk to a programmer,

6037
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:35,640
everything's,

6038
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:36,450
everything's bad.

6039
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:37,500
Voting machines or corrupt,

6040
02:33:37,530 --> 02:33:38,370
the system is failing.

6041
02:33:38,370 --> 02:33:39,203
We can't secure it.

6042
02:33:40,140 --> 02:33:42,600
like there was a kid at
defcon hacker convention who.

6043
02:33:42,601 --> 02:33:43,620
Active voting machine like that,

6044
02:33:44,030 --> 02:33:44,910
like the whole system is.

6045
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:46,080
I got to say,

6046
02:33:46,080 --> 02:33:47,550
you know that story I
told you about high times,

6047
02:33:48,030 --> 02:33:49,200
imagine if someone did that,

6048
02:33:49,320 --> 02:33:53,250
but it was a political story in how
easy would it be to rile people up and

6049
02:33:53,251 --> 02:33:53,770
getting violent.

6050
02:33:53,770 --> 02:33:53,961
It's,

6051
02:33:53,961 --> 02:33:54,340
it's,

6052
02:33:54,340 --> 02:33:54,620
it's,

6053
02:33:54,620 --> 02:33:54,861
it's,

6054
02:33:54,861 --> 02:33:55,890
it's dangerously easy.

6055
02:33:55,891 --> 02:33:56,724
It's terrifying.

6056
02:33:56,860 --> 02:34:00,390
It's very easy to get people
riled up with fig stories and,

6057
02:34:00,450 --> 02:34:01,201
and you know,

6058
02:34:01,201 --> 02:34:02,340
and once they go viral

6059
02:34:03,930 --> 02:34:04,763
there's no stopping it.

6060
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:09,330
And I think we're seeing a really even
more terrifying phenomenon in that even

6061
02:34:09,331 --> 02:34:11,160
when we have evidence
in front of our eyes,

6062
02:34:11,220 --> 02:34:12,053
covington,

6063
02:34:12,240 --> 02:34:13,073
people refuse.

6064
02:34:13,370 --> 02:34:14,610
Reza aslan for instance,

6065
02:34:14,850 --> 02:34:15,683
he won't back down.

6066
02:34:16,020 --> 02:34:16,860
It's like the,

6067
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:17,330
the,

6068
02:34:17,330 --> 02:34:17,920
the,

6069
02:34:17,920 --> 02:34:22,920
it was the first video that just shows
the one kid standing next to philips that

6070
02:34:23,081 --> 02:34:23,500
goes viral.

6071
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:25,060
I can understand why people
saw that and were like,

6072
02:34:25,061 --> 02:34:25,894
whoa.

6073
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:27,490
But the second video that went viral,

6074
02:34:27,491 --> 02:34:31,210
almost the exact same time showed
phillips walk up to the kid immediately

6075
02:34:31,211 --> 02:34:33,520
disproving the original narrative
of the kid approached him.

6076
02:34:33,910 --> 02:34:35,290
but even bill maher still got it wrong.

6077
02:34:35,890 --> 02:34:36,250
You know?

6078
02:34:36,250 --> 02:34:38,650
So even when people can
see exactly what happened,

6079
02:34:38,800 --> 02:34:39,850
it doesn't fit their narrative,

6080
02:34:39,851 --> 02:34:40,560
don't believe it.

6081
02:34:40,560 --> 02:34:40,900
And,

6082
02:34:40,900 --> 02:34:43,900
and there was an article that I think it
may have been in gizmodo or deadspin or

6083
02:34:43,901 --> 02:34:44,734
something that said,

6084
02:34:45,570 --> 02:34:46,600
don't listen to them.

6085
02:34:46,660 --> 02:34:48,820
We all know what we saw and it's like,

6086
02:34:48,821 --> 02:34:49,410
dude,

6087
02:34:49,410 --> 02:34:52,930
that's if we're getting to the point where
kids at a blackout basketball game we

6088
02:34:52,931 --> 02:34:54,970
have aren't black body paint
and throwing up three pointers.

6089
02:34:54,971 --> 02:34:56,020
Signs is nazis.

6090
02:34:56,530 --> 02:34:56,921
How do you,

6091
02:34:56,921 --> 02:34:58,270
how do you bring those
people back from that,

6092
02:34:58,271 --> 02:34:58,930
from the brink?

6093
02:34:58,930 --> 02:34:59,200
And,

6094
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:00,011
and I'll say this too,

6095
02:35:00,011 --> 02:35:01,450
like I obviously have been,

6096
02:35:01,480 --> 02:35:01,741
you know,

6097
02:35:01,741 --> 02:35:01,960
I've,

6098
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:02,670
I've,

6099
02:35:02,670 --> 02:35:03,250
uh,

6100
02:35:03,250 --> 02:35:05,170
didn't mention alt right
violence all that often.

6101
02:35:05,530 --> 02:35:07,330
But then you have to realize
the alt right is tiny,

6102
02:35:07,390 --> 02:35:07,661
tiny,

6103
02:35:07,661 --> 02:35:07,841
tiny,

6104
02:35:07,841 --> 02:35:08,320
tiny.

6105
02:35:08,320 --> 02:35:08,621
They're,

6106
02:35:08,621 --> 02:35:09,454
they're rare.

6107
02:35:09,460 --> 02:35:10,420
They've admitted defeat.

6108
02:35:10,450 --> 02:35:10,630
You know,

6109
02:35:10,630 --> 02:35:11,650
Richard Spencer said,

6110
02:35:11,710 --> 02:35:13,900
I think he said this at
antifa one or something.

6111
02:35:14,230 --> 02:35:14,950
No one showed up.

6112
02:35:14,950 --> 02:35:15,910
He had an event in Florida.

6113
02:35:15,911 --> 02:35:16,780
11 people shut up.

6114
02:35:16,781 --> 02:35:17,710
I'm not worried about that guY.

6115
02:35:18,070 --> 02:35:20,860
I'm worried about these fringe
ideologies that are racist,

6116
02:35:21,040 --> 02:35:22,360
intolerant and violent.

6117
02:35:22,630 --> 02:35:24,400
Slowly seeping into our culture.

6118
02:35:24,790 --> 02:35:29,790
Like when you see a politician's openly
embrace like race based government

6119
02:35:31,991 --> 02:35:32,824
policy,

6120
02:35:33,360 --> 02:35:34,830
it's really does worry me,

6121
02:35:35,020 --> 02:35:35,800
you know,

6122
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:36,430
my I,

6123
02:35:36,430 --> 02:35:40,960
I think I have this perspective growing
up in a mixed race family where I've

6124
02:35:40,961 --> 02:35:44,410
been insulted by the left for being
white and I've been insulted by far right

6125
02:35:44,411 --> 02:35:47,950
racists for being and so
I don't like either of it.

6126
02:35:48,040 --> 02:35:48,873
I reallY don't,

6127
02:35:49,300 --> 02:35:53,170
but the white supremacists types are
falling apart and they don't threaten me

6128
02:35:53,171 --> 02:35:53,720
anymore.

6129
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:53,890
They,

6130
02:35:53,890 --> 02:35:54,250
they,

6131
02:35:54,250 --> 02:35:55,083
they just don't,

6132
02:35:55,300 --> 02:35:59,620
but the left wing racism and the
and these ideas of racial equity and

6133
02:35:59,621 --> 02:36:02,290
determining what your worth based on
the color of your skin are becoming more

6134
02:36:02,291 --> 02:36:03,130
and more pervasive.

6135
02:36:03,670 --> 02:36:05,340
the lawsuit with harvard that,

6136
02:36:05,420 --> 02:36:07,330
that asians have a harder standard,

6137
02:36:07,690 --> 02:36:10,690
a tougher standard for getting in even
though agents or a smaller minority than

6138
02:36:10,691 --> 02:36:11,524
white people.

6139
02:36:11,530 --> 02:36:12,490
Why does that make sense?

6140
02:36:12,850 --> 02:36:16,360
why should I have to approach
someone and justIfy my race to them?

6141
02:36:16,361 --> 02:36:17,081
That terrifies me.

6142
02:36:17,081 --> 02:36:17,914
It really does,

6143
02:36:17,950 --> 02:36:18,411
and we will.

6144
02:36:18,411 --> 02:36:20,830
We see kirsten gillibrand tweet
the future as intersectional.

6145
02:36:21,550 --> 02:36:25,450
Intersectionality is that
ideology of race based polIcy.

6146
02:36:25,870 --> 02:36:27,340
[inaudible] has put forth,

6147
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:27,760
puts,

6148
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:29,860
puts forth the green new
deal that says racial equity.

6149
02:36:31,290 --> 02:36:31,870
I,

6150
02:36:31,870 --> 02:36:33,970
I prefer to judge someone on
the content of their character,

6151
02:36:33,971 --> 02:36:34,870
not the color of their skin.

6152
02:36:35,210 --> 02:36:35,480
Well,

6153
02:36:35,480 --> 02:36:35,891
it's also,

6154
02:36:35,891 --> 02:36:37,900
that's the kind of talk
that gets trump reluctant.

6155
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:39,190
Oh god.

6156
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:40,060
And that's that one.

6157
02:36:40,110 --> 02:36:41,920
That's one of my biggest
pet peeves because,

6158
02:36:42,090 --> 02:36:42,400
you know,

6159
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:43,750
I've talked about progressive tax.

6160
02:36:43,810 --> 02:36:47,860
I think we can do a lot for a public
option for expanding medicaid.

6161
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:48,460
Uh,

6162
02:36:48,460 --> 02:36:48,730
the,

6163
02:36:48,730 --> 02:36:51,430
the idea of a green new deal at
its core to me is fascinating.

6164
02:36:51,730 --> 02:36:51,970
Can,

6165
02:36:51,970 --> 02:36:52,803
can the government,

6166
02:36:52,810 --> 02:36:53,081
you know,

6167
02:36:53,081 --> 02:36:56,020
can we allocate tax money to
invest in new technologies,

6168
02:36:56,021 --> 02:36:59,830
fusion nuclear and reduce carbon
emissions and do great things.

6169
02:37:00,010 --> 02:37:01,240
Can we make high speed rails?

6170
02:37:01,720 --> 02:37:02,770
But then when you come out and say,

6171
02:37:02,780 --> 02:37:06,220
pay the unwilling and these other
equity things in intersectionality,

6172
02:37:06,221 --> 02:37:06,690
I'm like,

6173
02:37:06,690 --> 02:37:07,120
that's not,

6174
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:08,050
that's not what I'm talking about.

6175
02:37:08,380 --> 02:37:09,280
I can't support that.

6176
02:37:09,520 --> 02:37:11,680
The unwilling is the
most preposterous one.

6177
02:37:11,890 --> 02:37:14,770
The idea that someone's unwilling to
work and we need to provide them with a

6178
02:37:14,771 --> 02:37:15,604
living.

6179
02:37:15,680 --> 02:37:16,520
That's insanity.

6180
02:37:16,521 --> 02:37:16,701
I mean,

6181
02:37:16,701 --> 02:37:18,470
that's the ultimate progressive bend,

6182
02:37:18,920 --> 02:37:20,300
but in that's where it keeps going,

6183
02:37:20,301 --> 02:37:22,670
but where they're trying to out
progressive the next concept,

6184
02:37:22,671 --> 02:37:22,860
but,

6185
02:37:22,860 --> 02:37:25,880
but hold on in a socialist or
communist society stuff to work.

6186
02:37:25,990 --> 02:37:26,420
Yeah.

6187
02:37:26,420 --> 02:37:30,650
I don't know what society exists where
you expect people to undertake the

6188
02:37:30,651 --> 02:37:33,230
greatest construction project
in the history of humanity,

6189
02:37:33,530 --> 02:37:36,320
a massive train network that
makes all planes obsolete,

6190
02:37:36,321 --> 02:37:38,390
but at the same time tell people they
don't have to work if they want money.

6191
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:39,171
Well,

6192
02:37:39,171 --> 02:37:40,610
this is what we're saying is like,

6193
02:37:41,090 --> 02:37:45,710
as these ideologies get
more and more ridiculous,

6194
02:37:45,950 --> 02:37:48,500
they try to out progressive the next step,

6195
02:37:48,520 --> 02:37:51,320
like it's a fundamental right
for you to earn a living.

6196
02:37:51,460 --> 02:37:51,700
And,

6197
02:37:51,700 --> 02:37:54,530
and pew pew research recently
put out a poll last week,

6198
02:37:54,550 --> 02:37:55,383
couple weeks ago,

6199
02:37:55,430 --> 02:37:55,911
democrat,

6200
02:37:55,911 --> 02:37:56,691
the democratic party,

6201
02:37:56,691 --> 02:37:58,730
54 percent want more moderate policies.

6202
02:37:59,300 --> 02:37:59,821
So I'm,

6203
02:37:59,821 --> 02:38:00,654
I fall in that bracket,

6204
02:38:01,010 --> 02:38:01,371
but still,

6205
02:38:01,371 --> 02:38:04,520
you still have about 43 or so that
want more left leaning policies.

6206
02:38:04,540 --> 02:38:05,870
But what that means is the party split.

6207
02:38:06,200 --> 02:38:06,670
And so here,

6208
02:38:06,670 --> 02:38:07,221
here's the problem.

6209
02:38:07,221 --> 02:38:08,054
I see.

6210
02:38:08,330 --> 02:38:09,410
If you're going to put me up,

6211
02:38:09,610 --> 02:38:09,930
if you're gonna,

6212
02:38:09,930 --> 02:38:10,041
say,

6213
02:38:10,041 --> 02:38:10,191
tim,

6214
02:38:10,191 --> 02:38:10,940
you got to vote,

6215
02:38:10,940 --> 02:38:11,600
you have to vote,

6216
02:38:11,600 --> 02:38:12,470
you have to make a choice.

6217
02:38:12,680 --> 02:38:15,650
You've got a moderate conservative who
believes things I really don't agree

6218
02:38:15,651 --> 02:38:16,100
with,

6219
02:38:16,100 --> 02:38:18,890
but he doesn't want to give money to
people that don't work and he doesn't

6220
02:38:18,891 --> 02:38:21,680
believe in identitarian politics
and race equity or whatever.

6221
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:24,290
And then you've got the democrats
who are so far left to me,

6222
02:38:24,291 --> 02:38:25,430
I can't even see them anymore.

6223
02:38:25,720 --> 02:38:26,553
Who do you think,

6224
02:38:26,570 --> 02:38:27,120
you know,

6225
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:32,000
a social liberals and liberals are gonna
vote for the closest person to them

6226
02:38:32,001 --> 02:38:33,410
politically will be a conservative.

6227
02:38:33,610 --> 02:38:34,430
You know,

6228
02:38:34,430 --> 02:38:35,300
that's what scares me.

6229
02:38:35,810 --> 02:38:36,560
You know,

6230
02:38:36,560 --> 02:38:39,680
we had this great future with a potential
for a public option for expanding

6231
02:38:39,681 --> 02:38:41,030
medicaid for.

6232
02:38:41,090 --> 02:38:41,451
I mean,

6233
02:38:41,451 --> 02:38:41,691
look,

6234
02:38:41,691 --> 02:38:41,901
I,

6235
02:38:41,901 --> 02:38:44,060
I really do believe social
programs are important.

6236
02:38:44,061 --> 02:38:44,894
We can do more.

6237
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:46,610
I like a lot of what bernie has to say.

6238
02:38:46,760 --> 02:38:48,110
I think we need to reform education,

6239
02:38:48,111 --> 02:38:50,270
but I think education could be expanded.

6240
02:38:50,450 --> 02:38:50,811
Again,

6241
02:38:50,811 --> 02:38:51,750
I'm interested in the ideas.

6242
02:38:51,770 --> 02:38:52,850
I want to advocate for them,

6243
02:38:52,851 --> 02:38:53,870
but we need to figure out how to do it.

6244
02:38:54,380 --> 02:38:54,990
But my po,

6245
02:38:54,990 --> 02:38:56,750
like where I fit politically,

6246
02:38:56,751 --> 02:38:57,770
I'm politically homeless.

6247
02:38:58,220 --> 02:39:00,500
I don't agree with someone
judging me based on my race.

6248
02:39:00,590 --> 02:39:01,423
I've been through that.

6249
02:39:01,670 --> 02:39:02,210
Hell no.

6250
02:39:02,210 --> 02:39:03,043
Never again.

6251
02:39:03,140 --> 02:39:05,840
People vandalizing my home because they
didn't like that at a brown mom and a

6252
02:39:05,841 --> 02:39:06,440
white dad.

6253
02:39:06,440 --> 02:39:07,400
I don't want to live in that world.

6254
02:39:07,610 --> 02:39:09,260
I don't want you to look
me in the eyes and say,

6255
02:39:09,560 --> 02:39:10,131
I tell people,

6256
02:39:10,131 --> 02:39:10,641
look at this way.

6257
02:39:10,641 --> 02:39:11,474
When it comes to harvard,

6258
02:39:12,440 --> 02:39:14,690
I want you to look into the eyes
of that little asian boy and say,

6259
02:39:15,140 --> 02:39:15,830
honey,

6260
02:39:15,830 --> 02:39:16,910
you can't go to harvard.

6261
02:39:17,120 --> 02:39:17,953
You're asian.

6262
02:39:17,960 --> 02:39:19,700
You look too much like those people.

6263
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:20,780
How does that make sense?

6264
02:39:21,020 --> 02:39:24,710
Why is it that just because this
kid looks similar to this kid,

6265
02:39:24,740 --> 02:39:26,870
you're going to tell him he
has a harder standard for pat,

6266
02:39:26,900 --> 02:39:28,250
for the sats to get into the school.

6267
02:39:28,850 --> 02:39:29,211
I just,

6268
02:39:29,211 --> 02:39:29,281
I,

6269
02:39:29,281 --> 02:39:29,990
I refuse.

6270
02:39:29,990 --> 02:39:30,710
I absolutely do.

6271
02:39:30,710 --> 02:39:31,431
It's disgusting.

6272
02:39:31,431 --> 02:39:34,780
And the fact that it's coming from
harvard is so confusing that the high.

6273
02:39:34,781 --> 02:39:37,160
I mean that is the school,

6274
02:39:37,400 --> 02:39:37,720
right?

6275
02:39:37,720 --> 02:39:37,880
When,

6276
02:39:37,880 --> 02:39:39,560
when you think about higher learning,

6277
02:39:39,800 --> 02:39:40,350
where'd you grow up?

6278
02:39:40,350 --> 02:39:41,660
Where my dad graduated from harvard.

6279
02:39:41,690 --> 02:39:42,500
Well,

6280
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:43,160
harvard,

6281
02:39:43,160 --> 02:39:43,700
harvard.

6282
02:39:43,700 --> 02:39:46,850
That's the school and the fact
that they're practicing this way,

6283
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:49,640
they say it's because
if they didn't do that,

6284
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:51,770
the student body would
be overwhelmingly asian,

6285
02:39:51,860 --> 02:39:53,960
disproportionate to the
ketchup white people.

6286
02:39:54,110 --> 02:39:54,943
I don't care.

6287
02:39:55,130 --> 02:39:55,350
I,

6288
02:39:55,350 --> 02:39:56,183
I,

6289
02:39:56,760 --> 02:39:59,300
I don't think you get to look at
someone and say you look too much.

6290
02:39:59,301 --> 02:40:00,200
Like they do know.

6291
02:40:00,201 --> 02:40:00,830
It's crazy.

6292
02:40:00,830 --> 02:40:01,420
It's,

6293
02:40:01,420 --> 02:40:02,930
it's not a meritocracy.

6294
02:40:03,320 --> 02:40:03,940
If you do that,

6295
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:04,700
um,

6296
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:06,470
I want to talk to you about
the universal basic income.

6297
02:40:06,500 --> 02:40:07,333
What do you think about,

6298
02:40:07,400 --> 02:40:11,300
what do you think about
artificial intelligence and
artificial intelligence and

6299
02:40:11,301 --> 02:40:14,790
automation and the removal of all these
jobs is a real concern that a lot of

6300
02:40:14,791 --> 02:40:15,624
people have.

6301
02:40:15,780 --> 02:40:20,780
And then the way to mitigate it that's
being bandied about is universal basic

6302
02:40:21,331 --> 02:40:25,690
income that they would give you a certain
amount of money and I think the idea

6303
02:40:25,691 --> 02:40:26,910
is that everyone would get it.

6304
02:40:27,180 --> 02:40:28,560
Even wealthy people would get it.

6305
02:40:28,660 --> 02:40:29,010
Yeah.

6306
02:40:29,010 --> 02:40:31,140
And that would be the
only way to make it fair,

6307
02:40:31,141 --> 02:40:33,030
but where the fuck is
that money coming from?

6308
02:40:33,060 --> 02:40:34,680
And then what do you think about it?

6309
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:35,760
I don't think.

6310
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:36,940
I'm not an economiSt man,

6311
02:40:37,320 --> 02:40:37,671
but I don't.

6312
02:40:37,671 --> 02:40:38,610
I don't think it's feasible,

6313
02:40:38,611 --> 02:40:39,450
at least right now,

6314
02:40:39,990 --> 02:40:44,010
I do believe that on a technological
level we will eventually reach like a star

6315
02:40:44,011 --> 02:40:48,120
trek kind of future where
it's not about communism,

6316
02:40:48,121 --> 02:40:50,940
it's just literally like we
have no scarcity is gone.

6317
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:52,380
Like they have replicators,

6318
02:40:52,710 --> 02:40:54,090
but when it comes to
universal basic income,

6319
02:40:54,091 --> 02:40:56,190
people need to understand some
basic economic principles.

6320
02:40:56,970 --> 02:40:58,740
If everybody gets a thousand dollars,

6321
02:40:58,890 --> 02:40:59,723
okay,

6322
02:40:59,790 --> 02:41:00,890
that's $300,

6323
02:41:00,891 --> 02:41:02,100
million thousand dollars.

6324
02:41:02,150 --> 02:41:02,460
Right?

6325
02:41:02,460 --> 02:41:02,790
Right.

6326
02:41:02,790 --> 02:41:03,601
But it's not everybody.

6327
02:41:03,601 --> 02:41:04,980
It's everybody of working age,

6328
02:41:04,981 --> 02:41:05,460
right?

6329
02:41:05,460 --> 02:41:06,060
Yes.

6330
02:41:06,060 --> 02:41:06,391
So,

6331
02:41:06,391 --> 02:41:06,960
so let's,

6332
02:41:06,960 --> 02:41:07,530
let's,

6333
02:41:07,530 --> 02:41:08,260
let's do this.

6334
02:41:08,260 --> 02:41:09,570
I own a,

6335
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:10,433
I own a burger shop.

6336
02:41:10,980 --> 02:41:12,630
I need to hire someone to flip burgers.

6337
02:41:13,050 --> 02:41:14,730
So I say we pay 10 bucks an hour.

6338
02:41:14,850 --> 02:41:15,301
It's a,

6339
02:41:15,301 --> 02:41:15,600
it's not,

6340
02:41:15,600 --> 02:41:16,021
it's not a lot,

6341
02:41:16,021 --> 02:41:16,801
but we're a small business.

6342
02:41:16,801 --> 02:41:17,790
We can't really afford to pay more.

6343
02:41:17,791 --> 02:41:18,331
Is that acceptable?

6344
02:41:18,331 --> 02:41:20,580
They say I get a thousand bucks a month.

6345
02:41:20,581 --> 02:41:20,911
Why would I,

6346
02:41:20,911 --> 02:41:21,540
why would I spend,

6347
02:41:21,540 --> 02:41:22,080
you know,

6348
02:41:22,080 --> 02:41:22,500
if,

6349
02:41:22,500 --> 02:41:26,310
if you know that not really well the is
that the thousand bucks a month that you

6350
02:41:26,311 --> 02:41:26,790
get,

6351
02:41:26,790 --> 02:41:29,670
you get to keep and then the time
is worth more than 10 bucks an hour.

6352
02:41:30,510 --> 02:41:31,343
I don't care what,

6353
02:41:31,490 --> 02:41:31,980
when I,

6354
02:41:31,980 --> 02:41:32,761
when I was 17,

6355
02:41:32,761 --> 02:41:33,540
18,

6356
02:41:33,540 --> 02:41:35,490
I worked for american eagle airlines.

6357
02:41:35,790 --> 02:41:39,030
I was lifting like 50,000 pounds per day
and I was getting 10 bucks an hour and

6358
02:41:39,110 --> 02:41:39,943
in jacked.

6359
02:41:40,280 --> 02:41:40,860
No,

6360
02:41:40,860 --> 02:41:41,300
I was.

6361
02:41:41,300 --> 02:41:42,510
I've been skateboarding my whole life,

6362
02:41:42,511 --> 02:41:43,680
so I was certainly,

6363
02:41:43,710 --> 02:41:43,921
you know,

6364
02:41:43,921 --> 02:41:44,670
in shape.

6365
02:41:44,670 --> 02:41:45,210
But if you gave,

6366
02:41:45,210 --> 02:41:45,990
if you told me,

6367
02:41:45,990 --> 02:41:46,320
hey,

6368
02:41:46,320 --> 02:41:48,790
you know how you're making less than a
thousand bucks a month working fulltime

6369
02:41:48,840 --> 02:41:49,590
after taxes,

6370
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:50,730
how about we just give
you a thousand bucks?

6371
02:41:50,731 --> 02:41:52,590
I bet I'll be the skatepark yeah,

6372
02:41:52,750 --> 02:41:52,990
I'll,

6373
02:41:52,990 --> 02:41:53,370
I'll,

6374
02:41:53,370 --> 02:41:53,551
you know.

6375
02:41:53,551 --> 02:41:56,010
So there's some positives that
people will pursue their passions,

6376
02:41:56,011 --> 02:41:56,844
but hold on.

6377
02:41:57,030 --> 02:41:58,830
How many people do you
know want to be comedians?

6378
02:41:58,831 --> 02:41:59,664
And they're not funny.

6379
02:42:00,110 --> 02:42:00,840
A few.

6380
02:42:00,840 --> 02:42:01,261
Quite a few.

6381
02:42:01,261 --> 02:42:03,990
And imagine if you said we're going to
subsidize your endeavor into a thing.

6382
02:42:03,991 --> 02:42:07,320
You're not good at how many People
are really good at being carpenters,

6383
02:42:07,321 --> 02:42:08,760
but they wished they'd
be pro football players.

6384
02:42:09,060 --> 02:42:12,030
How many people are really good at being
teachers but want to be a famous actor?

6385
02:42:12,420 --> 02:42:16,740
So what do you think would be some sort
of an appropriate response to automation

6386
02:42:16,741 --> 02:42:18,750
and artificial intelligence?

6387
02:42:18,780 --> 02:42:18,960
I mean,

6388
02:42:18,960 --> 02:42:21,980
you can't just have millions and
millions of people just have nowhere to,

6389
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:22,590
you know.

6390
02:42:22,590 --> 02:42:23,220
And that's,

6391
02:42:23,220 --> 02:42:24,053
that's a,

6392
02:42:24,110 --> 02:42:24,640
a technical,

6393
02:42:24,640 --> 02:42:25,473
let's say.

6394
02:42:26,480 --> 02:42:27,640
This is why I uh,

6395
02:42:27,750 --> 02:42:27,950
you know,

6396
02:42:27,950 --> 02:42:28,261
I've,

6397
02:42:28,261 --> 02:42:29,820
I've never been a pot sMoker.

6398
02:42:30,210 --> 02:42:30,660
I,

6399
02:42:30,660 --> 02:42:31,800
I smoked like once in my life.

6400
02:42:31,820 --> 02:42:32,220
I want to try.

6401
02:42:32,220 --> 02:42:32,640
No,

6402
02:42:32,640 --> 02:42:33,473
no,

6403
02:42:33,690 --> 02:42:34,523
it's just not my thing,

6404
02:42:34,800 --> 02:42:37,590
but everyone always would think I was
stoned because I would talk about this

6405
02:42:37,591 --> 02:42:39,300
kind of stuff with my friends
while they were stoned.

6406
02:42:39,480 --> 02:42:42,000
The philosophical consequences
of technological innovation.

6407
02:42:42,780 --> 02:42:46,830
It is not the postMaster's fault that he
spent 30 years becoming the best of the

6408
02:42:46,831 --> 02:42:48,390
best in working at the post office.

6409
02:42:48,750 --> 02:42:52,290
That technology emerged that is going
to displace him and make him put them in

6410
02:42:52,291 --> 02:42:52,860
the poor house.

6411
02:42:52,860 --> 02:42:53,340
Right.

6412
02:42:53,340 --> 02:42:54,780
When I was about 19 years old,

6413
02:42:54,781 --> 02:42:58,710
I was skateboarding in downtown chicago
and I saw an old black homeless man and

6414
02:42:58,711 --> 02:43:00,270
I had some leftover food and I was like,

6415
02:43:00,271 --> 02:43:00,421
hey,

6416
02:43:00,421 --> 02:43:01,254
what's up dude?

6417
02:43:01,260 --> 02:43:01,831
You want some food?

6418
02:43:01,831 --> 02:43:02,140
And he was like,

6419
02:43:02,140 --> 02:43:03,120
oh thanks man.

6420
02:43:03,600 --> 02:43:04,500
And I was just like,

6421
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:05,371
I got to know,

6422
02:43:05,371 --> 02:43:06,300
can I ask you a question?

6423
02:43:06,660 --> 02:43:07,800
how did you become homeless?

6424
02:43:08,250 --> 02:43:09,083
And he said,

6425
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:09,840
uh,

6426
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:10,131
you know,

6427
02:43:10,131 --> 02:43:10,830
it man,

6428
02:43:10,830 --> 02:43:11,020
he's,

6429
02:43:11,020 --> 02:43:12,220
I think he was like 60 something.

6430
02:43:12,250 --> 02:43:13,540
He said I used to have a job.

6431
02:43:13,810 --> 02:43:14,170
Uh,

6432
02:43:14,170 --> 02:43:15,080
I worked all day day.

6433
02:43:15,081 --> 02:43:15,914
I had a family.

6434
02:43:16,410 --> 02:43:16,751
Uh,

6435
02:43:16,751 --> 02:43:17,531
eventually,

6436
02:43:17,531 --> 02:43:17,941
you know,

6437
02:43:17,941 --> 02:43:18,430
um,

6438
02:43:18,430 --> 02:43:18,700
my,

6439
02:43:18,700 --> 02:43:19,031
my,

6440
02:43:19,031 --> 02:43:19,360
uh,

6441
02:43:19,360 --> 02:43:20,410
didn't have kids.

6442
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:22,630
My friends started
getting old and move on.

6443
02:43:22,631 --> 02:43:23,411
I lost touch with a lot of them.

6444
02:43:23,411 --> 02:43:28,411
Some of them died and one day I got told
that my job wasn't needed anymore and

6445
02:43:28,571 --> 02:43:29,830
so I could know anything.

6446
02:43:29,950 --> 02:43:31,210
Went on unemployment for a little bit.

6447
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:32,230
But my,

6448
02:43:32,260 --> 02:43:32,531
you know,

6449
02:43:32,531 --> 02:43:33,550
the job I was good at,

6450
02:43:33,610 --> 02:43:34,480
it didn't exist.

6451
02:43:34,540 --> 02:43:34,841
Right.

6452
02:43:34,841 --> 02:43:35,710
I can't remember exactly what he said.

6453
02:43:35,711 --> 02:43:36,910
There's this 14 years ago,

6454
02:43:37,330 --> 02:43:38,021
but he was like,

6455
02:43:38,021 --> 02:43:39,070
so everywhere I went,

6456
02:43:39,071 --> 02:43:39,600
I said,

6457
02:43:39,600 --> 02:43:40,390
I'll do anything,

6458
02:43:40,390 --> 02:43:41,223
I'll do anything.

6459
02:43:41,410 --> 02:43:44,590
But even the small jobs that paid a little
bit to flip burgers weren't enough to

6460
02:43:44,591 --> 02:43:45,424
cover mY rent.

6461
02:43:45,790 --> 02:43:49,870
After a few months I got evicted then
because I didn't have a place to live,

6462
02:43:49,871 --> 02:43:50,561
I couldn't go to the job.

6463
02:43:50,561 --> 02:43:52,180
I did have started sleeping outside.

6464
02:43:52,181 --> 02:43:53,020
And I've been here ever since.

6465
02:43:53,760 --> 02:43:54,100
I'm like,

6466
02:43:54,100 --> 02:43:54,933
that said,

6467
02:43:55,180 --> 02:43:55,660
you know,

6468
02:43:55,660 --> 02:43:56,051
and that's,

6469
02:43:56,051 --> 02:43:56,350
that's,

6470
02:43:56,350 --> 02:43:57,250
that's a sad reality.

6471
02:43:57,251 --> 02:43:58,084
What do you do?

6472
02:43:58,120 --> 02:43:59,440
I don't know doc,

6473
02:43:59,770 --> 02:44:00,670
but your hooks you up.

6474
02:44:00,760 --> 02:44:01,420
But that's the thing.

6475
02:44:01,420 --> 02:44:02,051
She goes too far.

6476
02:44:02,051 --> 02:44:05,980
But this is why I believe in some
kind of social policy and safety net,

6477
02:44:05,981 --> 02:44:06,701
social security,

6478
02:44:06,701 --> 02:44:07,810
something to help these people.

6479
02:44:08,020 --> 02:44:08,950
Well for sure.

6480
02:44:09,340 --> 02:44:09,701
You know,

6481
02:44:09,701 --> 02:44:11,410
if we have a real community,

6482
02:44:11,500 --> 02:44:14,130
you would help out the people that
are in your community too big.

6483
02:44:14,470 --> 02:44:14,860
Yes.

6484
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:15,180
That's the,

6485
02:44:15,180 --> 02:44:15,550
you know,

6486
02:44:15,550 --> 02:44:15,760
you know,

6487
02:44:15,760 --> 02:44:16,750
communism works really,

6488
02:44:16,751 --> 02:44:18,160
really well when you
have like five people.

6489
02:44:18,650 --> 02:44:18,940
Yeah.

6490
02:44:18,940 --> 02:44:21,580
I try explaining to people they
always make this political,

6491
02:44:21,870 --> 02:44:22,750
the political compass.

6492
02:44:22,810 --> 02:44:23,890
Authoritarian lIbertarian left,

6493
02:44:23,891 --> 02:44:24,724
right?

6494
02:44:24,790 --> 02:44:25,270
And they,

6495
02:44:25,270 --> 02:44:25,600
they.

6496
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:28,720
People like to claim that anarchists
like the violent smashy ones,

6497
02:44:28,721 --> 02:44:30,610
an antifa are libertarian left.

6498
02:44:30,611 --> 02:44:30,920
And I'm like,

6499
02:44:30,920 --> 02:44:31,041
no,

6500
02:44:31,041 --> 02:44:31,101
no,

6501
02:44:31,101 --> 02:44:31,181
no,

6502
02:44:31,181 --> 02:44:31,990
no.

6503
02:44:31,990 --> 02:44:35,170
Like the libertarian left
quadrant are pot smoking,

6504
02:44:35,171 --> 02:44:38,770
hippies live on farms and arco
communism makes a ton of sense.

6505
02:44:38,771 --> 02:44:41,560
when it's you and your buddies
working together on a farm sharing

6506
02:44:41,561 --> 02:44:42,430
responsibilities.

6507
02:44:42,670 --> 02:44:46,690
It doesn't make sense for a community
of 300 million people and you have to

6508
02:44:46,691 --> 02:44:50,770
trade extremely specific resources
to make a computer happen.

6509
02:44:51,130 --> 02:44:51,490
Right?

6510
02:44:51,490 --> 02:44:52,001
At that point,

6511
02:44:52,001 --> 02:44:54,700
do you need to be able to quantify
the value of Specific objects?

6512
02:44:54,701 --> 02:44:56,840
And that's why communism
doesn't work for massive,

6513
02:44:57,080 --> 02:44:57,913
massive scale,

6514
02:44:58,360 --> 02:44:59,193
but

6515
02:45:00,310 --> 02:45:03,020
I will say when a artificial intelligence,

6516
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:03,910
a different conversation,

6517
02:45:03,970 --> 02:45:04,211
you know,

6518
02:45:04,211 --> 02:45:05,060
technological advancements,

6519
02:45:05,140 --> 02:45:07,660
advancement is going to
result in like luddite riots.

6520
02:45:07,840 --> 02:45:08,231
You know,

6521
02:45:08,231 --> 02:45:08,510
people,

6522
02:45:08,510 --> 02:45:08,770
you know,

6523
02:45:08,770 --> 02:45:09,820
the opioid crisis.

6524
02:45:10,230 --> 02:45:10,450
I,

6525
02:45:10,450 --> 02:45:11,231
I could be wrong.

6526
02:45:11,231 --> 02:45:14,920
I read that there was a connection
between unemployment from these factories

6527
02:45:14,921 --> 02:45:17,800
getting shut down and
depressed dudes popping pills.

6528
02:45:18,370 --> 02:45:19,030
there was a,

6529
02:45:19,030 --> 02:45:23,410
a masculinity report was published by
harry's shaving company and they said the

6530
02:45:23,440 --> 02:45:27,490
over the overwhelming majority of what
contributes to a man's happiness as

6531
02:45:27,491 --> 02:45:28,360
gainful employment,

6532
02:45:28,540 --> 02:45:28,890
like,

6533
02:45:28,890 --> 02:45:29,830
like 80 percent.

6534
02:45:30,610 --> 02:45:32,260
So what happens when a factory shuts down?

6535
02:45:32,500 --> 02:45:34,810
You got a bunch of young dudes
who wanted to do something.

6536
02:45:34,811 --> 02:45:35,644
they want to matter,

6537
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:36,581
but they can't.

6538
02:45:36,581 --> 02:45:37,150
There's no,

6539
02:45:37,150 --> 02:45:37,990
there's no where to go anymore,

6540
02:45:37,991 --> 02:45:39,190
especially in a small town.

6541
02:45:39,220 --> 02:45:39,851
But I'll tell you what,

6542
02:45:39,851 --> 02:45:41,770
men percosets feel real good.

6543
02:45:42,320 --> 02:45:42,551
you know,

6544
02:45:42,551 --> 02:45:43,031
those drugs,

6545
02:45:43,031 --> 02:45:43,870
they feel fantastic,

6546
02:45:43,960 --> 02:45:44,793
but they'll kill you.

6547
02:45:45,220 --> 02:45:46,480
So that's,

6548
02:45:46,481 --> 02:45:46,661
you know,

6549
02:45:46,661 --> 02:45:49,420
I think this contributes to the
popularity of bernie sanders and trump.

6550
02:45:49,870 --> 02:45:51,070
They talked about the working class.

6551
02:45:51,071 --> 02:45:52,180
I talked about these
free trade agreements,

6552
02:45:52,181 --> 02:45:52,721
hurting people.

6553
02:45:52,721 --> 02:45:55,690
they talked about gettIng the factories
back together and that means a lot to

6554
02:45:55,691 --> 02:45:58,660
people who have been popping
pills who are depressed,

6555
02:45:58,661 --> 02:46:01,330
who are sad and scared and so a
lot of people in this country.

6556
02:46:01,780 --> 02:46:02,770
So to wrap this up,

6557
02:46:03,010 --> 02:46:04,150
I'm the only.

6558
02:46:05,290 --> 02:46:06,670
The only other thing that I think

6559
02:46:08,440 --> 02:46:11,120
I would like to at least make

6560
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:16,120
an attempt at is what would be the path
for a person who's been banned from

6561
02:46:17,211 --> 02:46:18,440
these social media sites?

6562
02:46:18,460 --> 02:46:18,770
What,

6563
02:46:18,770 --> 02:46:23,510
what do you think would be a reasonable
way to bring people back into the

6564
02:46:23,511 --> 02:46:24,344
conversation,

6565
02:46:26,210 --> 02:46:28,010
whether it's youtube or whatever.

6566
02:46:28,370 --> 02:46:31,280
What would be a reasonable way mean?

6567
02:46:31,281 --> 02:46:32,114
Don't you think?

6568
02:46:32,120 --> 02:46:33,190
Just shouldn't be in a bag.

6569
02:46:33,200 --> 02:46:33,550
Honest,

6570
02:46:33,550 --> 02:46:34,383
reinstate it.

6571
02:46:34,410 --> 02:46:35,300
Just anybody,

6572
02:46:35,480 --> 02:46:35,961
anybody.

6573
02:46:35,961 --> 02:46:36,980
No matter what they've done.

6574
02:46:37,280 --> 02:46:38,030
well,

6575
02:46:38,030 --> 02:46:38,990
if you commit a crime,

6576
02:46:39,070 --> 02:46:39,903
you got to,

6577
02:46:40,040 --> 02:46:40,281
you know,

6578
02:46:40,281 --> 02:46:40,701
you get caught,

6579
02:46:40,701 --> 02:46:41,360
you go to jail,

6580
02:46:41,360 --> 02:46:41,870
right?

6581
02:46:41,870 --> 02:46:42,621
Then when you get out,

6582
02:46:42,621 --> 02:46:44,060
you're free to engage in normal,

6583
02:46:44,170 --> 02:46:44,720
you know,

6584
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:45,740
civic behavior.

6585
02:46:45,860 --> 02:46:50,860
Do you think that the concept of a
permanent ban is in some way almost an

6586
02:46:52,700 --> 02:46:53,780
american concept?

6587
02:46:54,580 --> 02:46:55,131
Oh man.

6588
02:46:55,131 --> 02:46:55,640
I don't know.

6589
02:46:55,640 --> 02:46:56,690
To get that specific,

6590
02:46:56,750 --> 02:46:58,250
like while we're into freedom of speech,

6591
02:46:58,270 --> 02:46:59,103
what does that mean?

6592
02:46:59,390 --> 02:47:04,390
I believe that as long as these companies
are monopolies and they are the public

6593
02:47:04,611 --> 02:47:05,444
sphere,

6594
02:47:05,630 --> 02:47:09,620
it is wrong to permanently exile someone
for saying a bad word for holding the

6595
02:47:09,621 --> 02:47:14,390
wrong opinion will mean a lot of these
like learn to code or they're fucking

6596
02:47:14,391 --> 02:47:15,230
preposterous.

6597
02:47:15,230 --> 02:47:18,710
I mean to ban someone permanently for
something that well for saying a man is

6598
02:47:18,711 --> 02:47:19,580
never a woman.

6599
02:47:19,650 --> 02:47:19,941
Right.

6600
02:47:19,941 --> 02:47:20,840
That was a permanent ban.

6601
02:47:21,650 --> 02:47:22,790
Men aren't women though.

6602
02:47:23,010 --> 02:47:23,400
Yes.

6603
02:47:23,400 --> 02:47:23,690
That's.

6604
02:47:23,690 --> 02:47:25,340
That's absurd and terrifying.

6605
02:47:25,450 --> 02:47:25,970
Yeah,

6606
02:47:25,970 --> 02:47:26,650
but even.

6607
02:47:26,650 --> 02:47:29,300
I'm like milo being banned.

6608
02:47:29,360 --> 02:47:29,661
Right?

6609
02:47:29,661 --> 02:47:29,901
Why?

6610
02:47:29,901 --> 02:47:31,370
Because he was tweeting at a celebrity.

6611
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:32,540
You're supposed to tweet it.

6612
02:47:32,550 --> 02:47:34,140
Celebrities only that it was a.

6613
02:47:34,220 --> 02:47:34,521
I mean,

6614
02:47:34,521 --> 02:47:39,380
the criticism of that movie was no
different than the criticism of any movie

6615
02:47:39,381 --> 02:47:40,440
that they thought sucked.

6616
02:47:40,610 --> 02:47:40,870
Right.

6617
02:47:40,870 --> 02:47:43,910
But it happened to be about
a feminist idea or a woman's.

6618
02:47:43,940 --> 02:47:44,780
And what was,

6619
02:47:44,781 --> 02:47:45,830
what was interesting is that,

6620
02:47:45,870 --> 02:47:46,131
I mean,

6621
02:47:46,131 --> 02:47:46,761
it's been so long,

6622
02:47:46,761 --> 02:47:47,900
so forgive me if I get this wrong,

6623
02:47:47,901 --> 02:47:51,740
but I believe leslie jones was tweeting
her followers to go to my low as well or

6624
02:47:51,741 --> 02:47:52,820
something that I believe so.

6625
02:47:53,140 --> 02:47:53,680
Well,

6626
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:54,080
you know,

6627
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:54,501
she's,

6628
02:47:54,501 --> 02:47:55,220
she's,

6629
02:47:55,220 --> 02:47:56,210
she's done some,

6630
02:47:56,900 --> 02:47:58,760
some questionable tweets herself.

6631
02:47:58,790 --> 02:47:59,270
Hey look,

6632
02:47:59,270 --> 02:48:00,530
people block me for no reason.

6633
02:48:00,860 --> 02:48:01,101
Uh,

6634
02:48:01,101 --> 02:48:02,810
I have no idea why some
people have locked me.

6635
02:48:02,870 --> 02:48:03,130
Yeah.

6636
02:48:03,130 --> 02:48:06,380
I've gone to people's pages and
found that unblocked block lists.

6637
02:48:06,440 --> 02:48:06,980
Yeah.

6638
02:48:06,980 --> 02:48:07,131
Well,

6639
02:48:07,131 --> 02:48:08,630
there's a solution if you don't,

6640
02:48:08,631 --> 02:48:09,320
if you don't.

6641
02:48:09,320 --> 02:48:10,070
So what they say,

6642
02:48:10,070 --> 02:48:10,880
what they say is,

6643
02:48:10,880 --> 02:48:11,690
um,

6644
02:48:11,690 --> 02:48:13,220
it's actually really
interesting precedent.

6645
02:48:13,550 --> 02:48:16,080
The daily stormer encouraged.

6646
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:18,200
This is I'm going off of some
news reports that could be wrong,

6647
02:48:18,201 --> 02:48:19,940
encouraged people to send,

6648
02:48:19,970 --> 02:48:20,180
you know,

6649
02:48:20,180 --> 02:48:24,500
racist images and start sending mean
thanks to this woman who I think,

6650
02:48:24,570 --> 02:48:28,010
I believe it was an asian or black and
a court ruled that the first amendment

6651
02:48:28,011 --> 02:48:31,370
will not protect you if you encourage
others to engage in harassment.

6652
02:48:32,270 --> 02:48:33,051
It's really interesting.

6653
02:48:33,051 --> 02:48:36,110
Then when we cOnsider what's going to
happen with the lawsuits towards all of

6654
02:48:36,111 --> 02:48:39,620
the people who smeared and defamed and
called for action against the covington

6655
02:48:39,621 --> 02:48:40,454
kids,

6656
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:43,160
that precedent that was used against
daily stormer is not going to be used

6657
02:48:43,161 --> 02:48:46,280
against these high profile celebrities
and personalities and are there lawsuits

6658
02:48:46,281 --> 02:48:47,750
that are being formed right now for that?

6659
02:48:47,870 --> 02:48:48,081
Yeah.

6660
02:48:48,081 --> 02:48:49,190
The big news,

6661
02:48:49,280 --> 02:48:51,230
the five Lawyers,

6662
02:48:51,231 --> 02:48:52,460
I think I remember the guys name,

6663
02:48:52,940 --> 02:48:54,280
huge list to ethnography.

6664
02:48:54,310 --> 02:48:56,750
Use your list a lot of like,

6665
02:48:57,130 --> 02:48:57,963
you know,

6666
02:48:58,010 --> 02:49:00,020
a lot of people did like their tweets,

6667
02:49:00,590 --> 02:49:03,710
but a lot of people didn't retract
like bill maher four days later.

6668
02:49:03,711 --> 02:49:07,920
It'S like after people are already
offering to represent these and threatened

6669
02:49:07,921 --> 02:49:08,250
lawsuits,

6670
02:49:08,250 --> 02:49:09,960
bill maher then comes out
with his bad information,

6671
02:49:10,350 --> 02:49:10,771
but anyway,

6672
02:49:10,771 --> 02:49:12,660
ultimately to the point of redemption,

6673
02:49:13,350 --> 02:49:16,380
we shouldn't permanently exile people for
saying things that we think are wrong.

6674
02:49:16,780 --> 02:49:18,840
What really scares me
about the Alex Jones thing.

6675
02:49:19,290 --> 02:49:19,770
I'm not.

6676
02:49:19,770 --> 02:49:20,960
What I'm about to say is not declined.

6677
02:49:20,970 --> 02:49:23,040
the Alex Jones is mentally
deficient or anything like that.

6678
02:49:23,041 --> 02:49:23,610
That's not my.

6679
02:49:23,610 --> 02:49:24,840
That's not whatever you want.

6680
02:49:24,841 --> 02:49:25,674
The point is,

6681
02:49:25,800 --> 02:49:29,040
if your justification for banning him
is that he said san diego wasn't real,

6682
02:49:29,370 --> 02:49:33,990
does that mean people who are who don't
have a grasp on reality aren't allowed

6683
02:49:33,991 --> 02:49:34,824
to use social media?

6684
02:49:34,980 --> 02:49:35,221
Is that,

6685
02:49:35,221 --> 02:49:38,400
does that mean that people who
are stupid ontologic social media,

6686
02:49:38,700 --> 02:49:42,270
people who are mentally ill have to
have an intelligence test to use social

6687
02:49:42,271 --> 02:49:42,660
media?

6688
02:49:42,660 --> 02:49:43,493
That's insane.

6689
02:49:44,060 --> 02:49:47,970
People are allowed to say what they want
to say and I think so long as twitter

6690
02:49:47,971 --> 02:49:48,804
is a monopoly,

6691
02:49:49,320 --> 02:49:50,340
they should probably.

6692
02:49:50,370 --> 02:49:54,030
We should probably have some protections
on the ability to engage in public

6693
02:49:54,031 --> 02:49:54,720
discourse.

6694
02:49:54,720 --> 02:49:56,400
I'll give you a really imporTant point.

6695
02:49:57,060 --> 02:50:00,900
Occupy wall street took place in zucotti
park in New York on what's called a

6696
02:50:00,901 --> 02:50:03,050
privately owned public space pops.

6697
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:05,580
This space is owned by a private entity.

6698
02:50:05,910 --> 02:50:06,600
However,

6699
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:09,960
they had no legal grounds for evicting
the protesters from the park because it

6700
02:50:09,961 --> 02:50:10,794
was encouraged.

6701
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:12,270
The public was encouraged to come,

6702
02:50:12,810 --> 02:50:16,230
so I would argue if twitter has actively
encouraging public participation,

6703
02:50:16,260 --> 02:50:18,390
they lose the protections
to band whoever they want.

6704
02:50:18,840 --> 02:50:22,980
I think it's rather terrifying that
you would seed political power in this

6705
02:50:22,981 --> 02:50:24,780
capacity to foreign interests.

6706
02:50:24,781 --> 02:50:27,430
Stockholders and private individuals
at a massive corporation,

6707
02:50:27,470 --> 02:50:27,710
mr.

6708
02:50:27,710 --> 02:50:28,543
Monopoly,

6709
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:29,900
that's not even beholden to the u.

6710
02:50:29,901 --> 02:50:31,020
S to a certain degree,

6711
02:50:31,620 --> 02:50:32,200
you know,

6712
02:50:32,200 --> 02:50:36,720
I forgive me for being a little bit of a
liberal who wants regulation on massive

6713
02:50:36,721 --> 02:50:37,530
corporations,

6714
02:50:37,530 --> 02:50:38,700
but I'm just,

6715
02:50:38,701 --> 02:50:38,860
I,

6716
02:50:38,860 --> 02:50:41,790
I'm surprised I don't see it
from other people on the left.

6717
02:50:41,980 --> 02:50:45,430
It's a very compelling argument and
I think the more it's fleshed out,

6718
02:50:45,431 --> 02:50:46,510
the more it seems to.

6719
02:50:46,840 --> 02:50:48,160
we definitely have an issue.

6720
02:50:48,310 --> 02:50:50,590
It's a giant issue and it doesn't go

6721
02:50:50,740 --> 02:50:50,940
away.

6722
02:50:50,940 --> 02:50:51,940
You just banned people.

6723
02:50:52,150 --> 02:50:52,570
Oh no.

6724
02:50:52,570 --> 02:50:53,830
You create parallel economies,

6725
02:50:53,831 --> 02:50:57,550
worlds and you end up with a backlash.

6726
02:50:58,270 --> 02:50:59,103
Yeah.

6727
02:50:59,230 --> 02:51:00,063
Well listen man.

6728
02:51:00,100 --> 02:51:00,650
Um,

6729
02:51:00,650 --> 02:51:01,760
I'm really happy you came.

6730
02:51:01,820 --> 02:51:04,520
I'm really happy we did
this and just thank you.

6731
02:51:04,550 --> 02:51:09,320
Thank you for educating me on this and
giving you a perspective and it's a very,

6732
02:51:09,690 --> 02:51:13,340
very articulate and very intelligent
perspective and I really appreciate it.

6733
02:51:13,341 --> 02:51:18,110
And I think for everyone this helps
us to sort of get an understanding of,

6734
02:51:18,770 --> 02:51:19,090
you know,

6735
02:51:19,090 --> 02:51:19,740
this,

6736
02:51:19,740 --> 02:51:20,170
this,

6737
02:51:20,170 --> 02:51:22,790
the whole spectrum of what's
going on with all this stuff.

6738
02:51:23,140 --> 02:51:23,560
Yeah.

6739
02:51:23,560 --> 02:51:24,730
And alice add by saying,

6740
02:51:24,731 --> 02:51:25,990
I don't think I'm the
smaRtest person in the world.

6741
02:51:26,140 --> 02:51:26,820
I probably got a lot.

6742
02:51:26,820 --> 02:51:27,910
I probably get a lot wrong.

6743
02:51:28,250 --> 02:51:31,390
I do my best to try and
have my facts straight.

6744
02:51:31,391 --> 02:51:32,470
If I don't forgive me,

6745
02:51:32,471 --> 02:51:32,741
fact,

6746
02:51:32,741 --> 02:51:33,730
check me all the time,

6747
02:51:34,030 --> 02:51:34,211
you know,

6748
02:51:34,211 --> 02:51:35,640
do your due diligence,

6749
02:51:35,770 --> 02:51:38,050
but I appreciate your perspective.

6750
02:51:38,110 --> 02:51:38,810
Thank you brother.

6751
02:51:38,810 --> 02:51:38,950
Thank you,

6752
02:51:38,950 --> 02:51:39,783
man.

6753
02:51:39,880 --> 02:51:40,121
Thank you.

6754
02:51:40,121 --> 02:51:40,954
We'll do this again.

6755
02:51:41,040 --> 02:51:41,270
Yeah,

6756
02:51:41,270 --> 02:51:41,490
tim,

6757
02:51:41,490 --> 02:51:41,701
pull.

6758
02:51:41,701 --> 02:51:42,534
Ladies and gentlemen.

6759
02:51:42,700 --> 02:51:43,533
Bye.

6760
02:51:45,800 --> 02:51:46,633
Cool.

6761
02:51:59,660 --> 02:52:00,460
Okay.

6762
02:52:00,460 --> 02:52:00,730
Okay.
