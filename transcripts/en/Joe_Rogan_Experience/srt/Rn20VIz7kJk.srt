I think it was 25.
Um,

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,553
I was on a ski trip.
My fraternity brothers were in Park 

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,533
City,
Utah.

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:20,990
Yeah.
Park City and uh,

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,300
we've just been partying.
I,

11
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:22,811
I,
uh,

12
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:23,644
I met this chick in the lyft line,
ended up getting her number and it went 

13
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,360
to the bar and I got like everybody shit
face.

14
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:32,550
It was like $300 bucks or I'd cut the 
whole bar drunk.

15
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:35,190
We were having fun.
We go back to her house or banging until

16
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:38,910
like seven in the morning or six in the 
morning and then I get a call,

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,830
like I just showered.
I was like,

18
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,080
just started sleeping on my buddy's 
like,

19
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:44,280
hey,
it's the last fucking day.

20
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,900
Like we're going like,
let's ride.

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,630
And I was just like,
ah,

22
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,441
fuck it.
All right.

23
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:51,710
Sure.
So I took a shot at drink of coffee,

24
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,040
got my shit on,
went out.

25
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,510
We reached out to booze.
Yeah,

26
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,280
shot of Tequila.
Jesus Christ.

27
00:00:56,281 --> 00:00:57,000
Wow.
Was like,

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,571
fuck.
I mean,

29
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,740
you know what I mean,
if you don't,

30
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:00,180
if you keep drinking,
you don't get hung out.

31
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:02,820
Right?
So I'm just like fuck it.

32
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,210
So when wrote all day and then that 
night,

33
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,044
I don't know,
I don't know if it was like a stomach 

34
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,354
flu or what,
but I was just like puke in and I just 

35
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:14,010
like felt like shit and I just like 
couldn't keep anything down.

36
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:14,844
I remember I paid like the hotel guy 
like 100 bucks or getting a bunch of 

37
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,810
gatorades.
It couldn't even like leave my room.

38
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,693
So next day go to the airport and I knew
that if I got Nivea I would feel better 

39
00:01:24,571 --> 00:01:25,860
because I've like had some,
you know,

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,030
when you get dehydrated that's usually 
like the root of most of your problems.

41
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,640
So I just ended up buying an ivy from 
this medic because the guy's like,

42
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:34,230
well if I hook this up to you,
you know,

43
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:35,850
like you're not gonna be able to fly.
And I was like,

44
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:36,700
dude,
like you know,

45
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,810
I gave him a bunch of bullshit out.
Scott,

46
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,733
you know,
fucking medic from the military and you 

47
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,144

this and that and I qualified to do 

48
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,020
that,
you know,

49
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,180
and it was a guy in a fucking salary,
the bag,

50
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,610
you know,
basically just gave it to me.

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,160
I hooked it up myself,
like on the plane.

52
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,530
Had you ever done this before?
Yeah,

53
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:54,600
we did it a couple times when we were in
buds,

54
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,880
like if we went out drinking or whatever
and uh,

55
00:01:56,881 --> 00:01:57,714
and we had to train the next day or this
is a commercial flight or a private 

56
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:01,200
flight?
Commercial.

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,240
Yeah,

58
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,890
You Hook up an IV bag?

59
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,360
Yeah.
Well in the bathroom like,

60
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,380

before I got on there.

61
00:02:07,381 --> 00:02:08,520
Right.
So I go in the bathroom,

62
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:09,850

63
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,240
Yeah.
You ain't gotta wait like an hour.

64
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:12,751
Right.

Go to Vegas.
How long did you let it drip in there?

68
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:21,540

137
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,940

138
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:19,681
Hey,

So I didn't really know the dosing or 

142
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:26,650

So he gives me the 100 milligram one,

00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:28,240
which is like for fucking,

148
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,640
but I know I'm all coked up.

154
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,470
I'm like,
give me the fucking thing.

155
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,050
So it gives me another user only take 
half.

156
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:53,591
He's like,
don't,

157
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,520
you know,
don't take this.

158
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,860
And so anyways,
so I'd take another half,

159
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,800
wait like five minutes,
do some more blow.

160
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,230
And I'm like,
oh my Dick's not hard.

161
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,073
Like the girls aren't even around,
like I have no sexual esteem is no even 

162
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,680
reason for my Dick.
The yard.

163
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,514
Right.
But it's like in my mind I'm like 

164
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,890
overthinking it,
which makes it worse.

165
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,120
Right.
So like fuck it.

166
00:05:10,121 --> 00:05:12,890
So I take the other half,
so now I'm like 200 milligrams into this

167
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:14,570
fucking bag or which is like,
you know,

168
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,720
double the absolute Max from what you 
know.

169
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,110
Some guys have to get their Dick 
drained,

170
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:20,731
right?
Yeah,

171
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,161
yeah.
Well,

172
00:05:21,161 --> 00:05:26,161
we'll get to that,
so go back to my hotel and I'm like,

173
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,600
fucking banging this shit out of this 
girl.

174
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,051
Like,
you know,

175
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:31,240
I mean I got like veins coming out of my
head.

176
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:33,940
I'm sweating profusely and I'm like 
doing blue.

177
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,340
I'd fucked her for like maybe like 45,
50 minute.

178
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:39,280
Like it wasn't not pleasurable at all.
This was like work,

179
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,430
right?
I'm just like.

180
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,310
And after like,
fuck man,

181
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,840
I think it was like 50 minutes.
I just like,

182
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,520
I had to quit.
Like I was just like,

183
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,121
I just,
you know,

184
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:49,100
I just knew there was zero chance of me 
coming and I was like,

185
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,040
punished this chicken up and I'm just 
like.

186
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:56,041
And I like didn't like I was tired of 
when the bathroom took a cold shower,

187
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,680
my dick,
like go down.

188
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,023
Like I and I ordered some room service,
ended up like tucking it up into my 

189
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,950
waist.
And um,

190
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,290
because like there's just no going down 
with this bucket thing.

191
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:09,740
Right?
So ether room service I think.

192
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,693
Oh yeah.
Then I actually ended up taking a value 

193
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:13,430
in,
went to sleep,

194
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,220
Bangor again,
woke up,

195
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,054
went and ate some Mexican food.
I was like betting on the sports game 

196
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,773
and I started getting like this pain in 
my shoulder and I didn't really know 

197
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:26,800
what it was,
is like kind of just felt like a,

198
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,643
like an ache.
So started doing pushups that didn't 

199
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:32,600
really make it feel any better.
And I was like stretching my arm.

200
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,360
I was like trying to sleep,
but I couldn't even lay on that side.

201
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:36,370
I'm just like,
what the fuck?

202
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:37,204
Like heart attack never even entered 
into the realm of possibility of shit 

203
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:41,650
that could be wrong.

204
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:42,483
Me,
right.

205
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,590
Like fucking 25 I guess like shoulder 
pain.

206
00:06:45,591 --> 00:06:46,221
Like wow,
you know,

207
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,800
I,
I had no idea about having a hard day.

208
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:52,850
So call my mom tardy at the family 
doctor on the phone.

209
00:06:52,851 --> 00:06:55,910
She calls this dude up and I'm like 
getting like kind of shorter breaths.

210
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,763
I'm like fuck.
So I just hang up the phone and I find 

211
00:06:58,611 --> 00:07:03,440
out the hospitals like 10 minutes away.
So I'm like,

212
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,470
fuck it.
I'll just get a cap,

213
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,010
be faster.
I should have got an ambulance,

214
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,750
but I got a cab,
you know,

215
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:09,584
note to self,
always get an ambulance if you got any 

216
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:11,534
shit because I got the cab.
I was in the waiting room for like 50 

217
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,620
minutes.
I pulled out like 10 grand on my pocket.

218
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:16,401
I told the Lady,
I was like,

219
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,620
I'll give you 10 grand.
Let me talk to the fucking doctor.

220
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,180
Like something's wrong.
I don't know what's wrong,

221
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:22,160
but I know something's wrong.
Anyway,

222
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,810
she take the 10 grand,
fuck no,

223
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,580
let me sit in the fucking waiting room 
and like 30,

224
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,790
40 minutes go by.
Finally could see my doctor.

225
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,561
He's like,
Holy Shit,

226
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:31,394
like you're having a full blown heart 
attack all this stuff and giving the 

227
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:39,020
Nitroglycerin and I call my dad and my 
mom was like,

228
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:39,801
you know,
telling my mom,

229
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,390
I'm like,
I'm thinking I'm fucking done.

230
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,224
Right.
And because this has been going on for 

231
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:45,080
awhile and I'm like having a hard time 
breathe in.

232
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:45,914
I'm like in pain.
And so they gave me the nitroglycerin 

233
00:07:49,911 --> 00:07:51,410
right?
And I start feeling better.

234
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:54,140
They do an angiogram or whatever where 
they check out the heart.

235
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,290
That said there was no damage.
Parents come out the next day,

236
00:07:57,291 --> 00:08:00,480
I have another one and I'm like.
And I tell the doctor I'm going say.

237
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,480
And then my doctor was Conrad Murray 
too,

238
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:03,920
by the way,
which was Michael Jackson,

239
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:07,560
Dr Guy that smoked him and the craziest.
I your talk it.

240
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,463
And the spookiest thing about the whole 
deal was my grandfather had the same 

241
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:12,944
doctor in the same motherfucking 
hospital exactly one year prior and 

242
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,780
died.
So I'm just like,

243
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:18,614
you know,
this is not looking good for the home 

244
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:20,444
team.
This was before he killed Michael 

245
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,740
Jackson is asked to write sound like,
you know,

246
00:08:24,741 --> 00:08:26,240
fuck,
I'm just in the hospital.

247
00:08:26,241 --> 00:08:27,350
So I call my dad.
I'm like,

248
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,840
I'm having another heart.
I tell the nurse and they're like,

249
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,520
no,
like your thing looks fine.

250
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,810
I call my dad.
I'm like,

251
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:35,300
there's something wrong with dad,
like comes down to the hospital and sure

252
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,500
enough,
like I'm having a second,

253
00:08:36,501 --> 00:08:37,670
like minor heart attack.
I'm like,

254
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,623
what the fuck?
So they do a bunch of tests and say my 

255
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:44,120
heart's fine and then they ask you for 
like the list.

256
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,750
So I got to like give them the list of 
my ex girlfriends there.

257
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,380
My Mom's there,
my dad's there,

258
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,820
and I'm just like,
started off with like,

259
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:50,631
oh well,
you know,

260
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,730
the smoking the pot.
And he's like,

261
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:53,211
well,
you know,

262
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:54,310
like,
you better tell us like,

263
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,010
what you've been like,
it's important.

264
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,630
We need to figure out what's going on 
with you.

265
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,190
And I'll say,
ah,

266
00:08:59,191 --> 00:08:59,940
and you know,
I did,

267
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,840
you know,
I did some,

268
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,930
you know,
ecstasy,

269
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,310
cocaine and like,
my dad like looks over at me like,

270
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,300
what the fuck,
you know,

271
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:09,960
my dad like Super Square and um,
anyway,

272
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,370
so then I was like,
yeah,

273
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,253
I think it took some Viagara.
My girlfriend's like fucking rioting 

274
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,170
now.
And he's like,

275
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:16,961
how much?
I'm like,

276
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:19,070
200 milligrams just like,
what is twitter?

277
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,150
I'm like,
I don't fucking know.

278
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,320
It's a good thing,
you know,

279
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,460
seemed like water,
you know,

280
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,070
like that's like an insane amount.

281
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,340
Like.
Anyway.

282
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:29,580
So I,
uh,

283
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,473
I,
I ended up staying in the hospital for 

284
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,364
like four days.
I actually fucked my girlfriend in the 

285
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:36,260
hospital with all these cords and crazy 
shit.

286
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,510
Jesus smoked a joint in the hospital 
thing.

287
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,950
I fucked her,
like I had a buddy of mine bringing like

288
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:45,810
wine coolers in Chinese food,
I think the worst patient of all time.

289
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:47,750
Right.
And somehow like,

290
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:50,160
you know,
I'm so give me all these fucking pills.

291
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:50,994
I got to take their telling me like I 
got to take these pills for the rest of 

292
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:54,870
my life for the rest of your life.
That's what they said.

293
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:56,850
And I was just like,
after like three days,

294
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:59,040
like I fucked my girlfriend eight,
the Chinese food.

295
00:09:59,041 --> 00:09:59,551
I was like,
okay.

296
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:04,551
I'm like back to being invincible again 
through all the shit is a heart attack.

297
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,370
Exactly.
I've heard that,

298
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,140
that phrase.

299
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,140
But what is the exact medical thing 
that's going on?

300
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,940
You know,
for guidance had to.

301
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,220
I should know.
Um,

302
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,333
I don't know,
I think it's just like basically when 

303
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:19,210
your heart's not getting enough oxygen 
or something or um,

304
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,580
I don't know,
it's just not functioning properly.

305
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,500
Usually there's like a.
yeah,

306
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,393
there's like a blocked artery.
There's something and I think like coke 

307
00:10:27,721 --> 00:10:29,670
is a,
is a vasoconstrictor,

308
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,900
whatever,
so maybe like constricted my veins.

309
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:34,830
So there wasn't like an Agra visal 
dilator,

310
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,240
so does shouldn't have bounce it out,
I think,

311
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,400
but I don't know.
You know what I mean?

312
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,234
I don't know.
I don't really know the science behind 

313
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:41,214
it,
but I know that like coke and wag or I 

314
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,710
don't think you're supposed to make 
some.

315
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:45,900
I Dunno it.
Wow.

316
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,460
I mean,
I know I did a lot of both.

317
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,910
Should've canceled out,
but I guess it didn't.

318
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,080
I guess what the body was like so 
confused it going.

319
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,630
So a director is like,
fuck,

320
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:56,240
you had to shut down.
I don't know.

321
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,100
Wow.
Wow.

322
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,390
That's fucking terrifying.
