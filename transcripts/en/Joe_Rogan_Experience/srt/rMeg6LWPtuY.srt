1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,800
The general good experience and so yeah,

2
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,350
so finally in all this time,

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,030
you know Dana and the UFC is saying
we want ben to asking me about benioff

4
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:10,281
skirt.

5
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:12,810
I'm ranked number seven
in the world or you know,

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,720
somewhere around there,

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,553
12 and l.

8
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,340
and so I remember I was going to the
Asian food store cause I was gonna make

9
00:00:18,341 --> 00:00:21,420
some tom cost soup and
bjorn calls me and said,

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,430
you're released full,

11
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,353
full,

12
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,050
you're released.

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,850
You can go.

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,221
And I say,

15
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:27,054
I appreciate that.

16
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,580
So Friday morning,

17
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:29,191
it's Thursday night,

18
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:29,761
Friday morning,

19
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,481
it's in November,

20
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:31,820
sometime in May,

21
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,450
mid November morning they fax
over the release my management,

22
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:40,260
fax it to UFC headquarters and all
of a sudden that afternoon there's a,

23
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:40,490
you know,

24
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,040
like little scrum wherever was asking
Dana questions and the data says we're not

25
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:44,874
interested in Ben.

26
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,403
And I said,

27
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,110
wait,

28
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,470
what just happened there?

29
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:50,671
Right?

30
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,740
Because for the last three months they
were saying we were interested in wearing

31
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,770
short words twisted.

32
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,300
Now I finally produced this full release
for Bella tour that I got and now

33
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:00,774
they're not interested.

34
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,651
And so I said,

35
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,220
wow,

36
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:05,060
I just got caught in the
middle of this and uh,

37
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,780
was there a reason given well,

38
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:06,961
so.

39
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:07,201
Okay,

40
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:07,861
so the Monday.

41
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,860
So then I say F that I buy my,

42
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:12,510
I bought a plane ticket
to Vegas for Monday,

43
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,501
so that was Friday.

44
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,334
That happens.

45
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:14,790
I say,

46
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,623
fuck that.

47
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,890
I'm going to Vegas,

48
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:18,030
I'm not taking this shit,

49
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:18,864
you know.

50
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,390
So a Monday I buy my
plane ticket to Vegas,

51
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:22,290
I fly out to Vegas.

52
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,770
Do you have to headquarters a lot?

53
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,710
I met with Lorenzo.

54
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:30,711
Dana was on the little speakerphone
dealy and they offered me a contract,

55
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:35,670
but it would be confidential and I would
have to fight one fight for the world

56
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,504
series of fighting,

57
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,943
which is like,

58
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,420
well that's bizarre.

59
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,050
What?

60
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,800
Yeah.

61
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,220
At the same fight for the world series
a funding relationship with the world

62
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,054
series,

63
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,390
like a feeder organization at that time.

64
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:47,881
Something.

65
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:48,151
Yeah.

66
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:48,451
I mean,

67
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:49,200
I,

68
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,980
yeah,

69
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,390
Morrowind,

70
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,900
Mariah's just engage you.

71
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:53,730
Both those kids came
from champs over there.

72
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,470
I think the relationship is very hazy
between the old world series of fighting

73
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:01,140
in the UFC because there was also
people don't want the other way.

74
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:01,381
Right.

75
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,630
Andre Arlovski gets dropped from the FC,

76
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:04,590
goes to world series.

77
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,090
Anthony Johnson,

78
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,391
boom.

79
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:07,224
All these people.

80
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,310
So they say one fight,

81
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:09,144
one fight,

82
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,043
world series of fighting.

83
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,000
We will pay Zoopla.

84
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:11,843
We'll pay you.

85
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,260
Would you do one fight?

86
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,000
Okay.

87
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,360
I say let that's eft up,

88
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,590
but okay.

89
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,281
I said,

90
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:18,300
I don't think anyone's going to go for it,

91
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,134
but I'll do it.

92
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,303
So I leave.

93
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,331
And uh,

94
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:24,810
about six hours later I
got a phone call and says,

95
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,400
that deal is no longer available.

96
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,660
We're not going to make you an offer.

97
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,550
Yeah.

98
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,380
So wow.

99
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,590
And you have no idea why?

100
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:33,110
Well,

101
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,260
I,

102
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:33,390
I,

103
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,740
so here's my guess.

104
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,900
I've never got to sit face
to face meeting and say,

105
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,410
what was your problem with me?

106
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:39,720
I think there's four things.

107
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,913
My mind,

108
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,540
number one,

109
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,530
he didn't really like me.

110
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,720
I'm stemming from the.

111
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:47,310
I called them out on the steroid thing,

112
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,670
you know,

113
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:50,440
where he said it's impossible
and this is where our disagree.

114
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,740
It's impossible to test all UFC athletes.

115
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:53,041
I said,

116
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:53,641
let's not true.

117
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,950
You sat does it all over the
world for all kinds of athletes.

118
00:02:55,951 --> 00:02:56,550
Right.

119
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,181
You can do it.

120
00:02:57,181 --> 00:02:58,140
It's just expensive,

121
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,921
but let's just call it.

122
00:02:58,921 --> 00:02:59,754
What is.

123
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,760
You're a private business.

124
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,110
You don't have to do drug testing.

125
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,660
It's basically they do it now.

126
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,810
Do it now.

127
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,070
Do it through Usada.

128
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,120
So you're totally right.

129
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,421
Yeah.

130
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,650
So I was correct and now.

131
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,071
But that was,

132
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,281
you know,

133
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,900
when Dana is wrong in an argument,

134
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:14,830
but he's got this huge army that
follows him and he said I'd rather hit.

135
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,030
I think his quote was Bev,

136
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,220
I'd rather watch [inaudible]
fucking bad ass him fight,

137
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:18,700
you know,

138
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,990
I think he said something like,

139
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,730
ambien takes.

140
00:03:21,731 --> 00:03:23,110
Ben Asked her if it goes asleep.

141
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,551
Yeah,

142
00:03:23,551 --> 00:03:23,821
there,

143
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:24,431
there was a few of them.

144
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:25,630
So the personal attacks started.

145
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:25,781
Right?

146
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,290
So that,

147
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,310
that's number one.

148
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,693
But uh,

149
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,571
you know,

150
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,380
it's that thing,

151
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:30,711
you know,

152
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:30,901
you're,

153
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:33,440
you're experiencing this
thing that she can't do.

154
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:34,910
She's the wife is not a comedian.

155
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,631
It's another thing.

156
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:39,680
I think comics also have a bond that
that I feel like the outside person can

157
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:42,200
never totally understand as well.

158
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,970
Just the way we joke
around with each other,

159
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,190
like if just the things you
and I have said to each other,

160
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,310
if we said these things in
an office like Holy Shit,

161
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,070
lost human resources
would both go to jail.

162
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,770
I think you'd go to jail more than me.

163
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,101
I am the worse,

164
00:03:56,101 --> 00:03:57,620
but thank God that NBC last it,

165
00:03:57,621 --> 00:04:00,530
those friends writers made a
lot of progress for us because.

166
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,391
Okay,

167
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,140
so there was this famous
lawsuit on friends.

168
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:07,220
The writer's assistant sued the writers
in the writer's room because they were

169
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,510
saying something about the actresses are
saying like fucking them with twigs or

170
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:14,840
something crazy and they sued.

171
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:18,130
The writer's assistant sued the
writers for sexual harassment and said,

00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:23,960
because they said it was
part of our creative process.

175
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,070
Well it is.

176
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,270
It certainly is.

177
00:04:26,271 --> 00:04:27,350
And especially with Comedians,

178
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,730

shit to each other.

179
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,350

Fuck you bro.

188
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,450
First of all my top favorites.

189
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,820
Me,

190
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,653
I'm a top.

191
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,690
You're just going to give in.

192
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,553
You're just going to give in,

193
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:48,870
you know,

194
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,180
spinning your hand and
rubbing on your butt.

195
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:55,370
And we will do that to each other because
it's how we make each other laugh that

196
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:57,080
we need something really extreme.

197
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,280
You wanna you want to be for the fight
came like they do on the use of drug

198
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,840
testing a roses,

199
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:09,320
walking back through the hallway with
her official as she crossed paths with

200
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:09,430
you,

201
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,600
Ana and all by herself.

202
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,070
And you wanna go ahead.

203
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:13,711
Oh yeah.

204
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:17,250
She like in a different tone
of voice to like the weirdest,

205
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,040
like she didn't seem like
herself or something.

206
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:21,600
I mean I'm sure she's getting in fight
mode or whatever and it's just like

207
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:22,550
breaking in or close.

208
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,210
And she's like,

209
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,720
and that gave her like the so you know,

210
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,700
and she gave me the what's
up and then she was like,

211
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,320
I'm just like,

212
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,850
I think she asked me something like,

213
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,450
as you buy the ticket or I was like,

214
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,663
just like,

215
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,450
you believe them or do you believe
in them or something like that.

216
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,271
Do you believe him?

217
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,260
Did you buy the ticket?

218
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,270
And then she walked off

219
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,291
and did say no.

220
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,124
And I was just like,

221
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,413
it was like,

222
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,460
did you buy the test?

223
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,940
She's keyser soze.

224
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,710
I didn't do that like all week long.

225
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,460
Like even in a little way in,

226
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:53,910
you know,

227
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,970
after the way as a sort of
like all kinds of stuff.

228
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,880
We were fucking shit man.

229
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,160
Rose

230
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,210
came back to the locker room.

231
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,350
Now we're ready all week.

232
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,550
We've been deflecting shit.

233
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,440
We've been deflecting shit.

234
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:04,430
And I rose is a very
emotional person in temporary.

235
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,180
Like she's,

236
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,140
we got to keep rolling,

237
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,750
keep rolling straight because she comes
in with the wrong look on her face.

238
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,320
I'll,

239
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,153
something's wrong.

240
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,710
She goes off and does the
drug test and comes back.

241
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,940
And when she sat down,

242
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,260
she says,

243
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,813
we have to,

244
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,250
we have to have a meeting now that's cold.

245
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,590
We have to have a meeting
is called for shutting down.

246
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,580
Everybody get the fuck out.

247
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,810
We were bouncing.

248
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,850
We have to have a meeting is like kind
of another way of saying start to count

249
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:27,684
down with leaving.

250
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,820
We have to have a meeting.

251
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,841
And when she said that,

252
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:30,620
the way she said it,

253
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,730
I meant everything came over me like,

254
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,593
Oh fuck,

255
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,763
what happened?

256
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,851
And then when she said,

257
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:36,350
would you want to sit in the back?

258
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:37,250
What do you want to told to,

259
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:37,940
do you believe him?

260
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,840
Did you buy the ticket?

261
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,900
And then left without any explanation.

262
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:42,681
Yo.

263
00:06:42,681 --> 00:06:43,250
When Roe,

264
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,390
when Roe said that to me,

265
00:06:44,391 --> 00:06:46,130
my fucking head exploded it.

266
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:46,964
And the only thing I can say,

267
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,440
Oh shit,

268
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,630
I don't want to have to fucking
think about this all night.

269
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,183
Oh,

270
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,280
why did you stop being religious?

271
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,091
Uh,

272
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:01,610
I started in high school and
stopped in graduate school.

273
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:05,000
So when you started being
religious in high school,

274
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,340
so it wasn't something that
your family introduce you to.

275
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,940
My parents were pretty secular.

276
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,700
They,

277
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,820
they weren't antireligious it,

278
00:07:11,821 --> 00:07:12,020
what,

279
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,980
that wasn't a thing then,

280
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,180
but this is 1971 when I
was in high school and the,

281
00:07:16,181 --> 00:07:17,960
in the sort of Nissan born again,

282
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:20,900
movement was starting and there
was no religious affiliation.

283
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:21,471
It was just like,

284
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:22,520
it's me and Jesus.

285
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,000
That's it.

286
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,530
It's just you and the Lord.

287
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,690
There's a lot of these um,

288
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,430
very charismatic hip,

289
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,720
young preachers that are doing sort of
a thing like that where they don't even

290
00:07:32,721 --> 00:07:37,150
have their own church to like rent
time in the church and they have these

291
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,180
meetings where it's not,

292
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:44,380
it's just nondenominational and they just
talk about God and yet they get a lot

293
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:45,710
of people fired up.

294
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,400
Yup.

295
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,761
And uh,

296
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:47,130
you know,

297
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,330
the place I went to this place called
the barn in Locker Santa where I grew up

298
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,040
in,

299
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:52,251
you know,

300
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,360
they played guitar and

301
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,000
sang to a sex cult.

302
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,630
It was kind of one starts banging people.

303
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,030
I was hoping for something like that,

304
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,530
but no,

305
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,363
no,

306
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,423
that,

307
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,580
that is one of the
problems with the utopia,

308
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,740
the 19th century utopian experiments,

309
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:09,350
they always turned into this
free sex for the leader.

310
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:09,831
Well,

311
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:14,000
it always seems like whenever there's
a man that's in a position where people

312
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:15,260
start worshiping him,

313
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:15,620
right,

314
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:15,921
you know,

315
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,350
and then they start
hanging on his every word.

316
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:18,591
He's like,

317
00:08:18,591 --> 00:08:20,540
I started going to start
fucking some of these people.

318
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:21,950
Well,

319
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,250
I do.

320
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,290
I covered Jim Jones and uh,

321
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:24,501
you know,

322
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:27,470
the way I phrase it is
that no one joins a cult.

323
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,200
They join a group that they
think is going to do good,

324
00:08:30,201 --> 00:08:30,890
save the world.

325
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,480
Kind of helped me improve my life,

326
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,710
improve the lives of others.

327
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,390
And there's pictures online.

328
00:08:35,391 --> 00:08:37,340
You can see if Jim Jones with Jerry Brown,

329
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,350
governor Jerry Brown in his
first round and you know,

330
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,730
they were man in the soup kitchens.

331
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,720
He was very liberal,

332
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,900
open to African Americans being
part of the church in San Francisco.

333
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:45,980
They're gays women.

334
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:46,821
Uh,

335
00:08:46,821 --> 00:08:47,041
you know,

336
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,320
it was a really cutting edge,

337
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,131
pioneering thing.

338
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,330
And at the time it seemed like,

339
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:50,500
yeah,

340
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:50,700
that,

341
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,560
that's a cool thing.

342
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,640
I'm going to join this group,

343
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,480
not me,

344
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:53,811
but you know,

345
00:08:53,811 --> 00:08:57,720
the people that did this in the fifties
and sixties when he was coming up and

346
00:08:57,721 --> 00:08:59,070
then into the seventies and then,

347
00:08:59,570 --> 00:08:59,970
then,

348
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:00,241
yeah,

349
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:02,820
he started having sex
and drugs and then the,

350
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,031
you know,

351
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:06,750
the feds started kind of poking around
and taxes and that's when they went to

352
00:09:06,751 --> 00:09:07,790
South America speaking,

353
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,070
which I think this week is
the spike specialists now,

354
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,820
the paramount network on
Waco and waco going on,

355
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,780
like right now.

356
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,970
I think it's like a started Sunday.

357
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:18,240
Yeah.

358
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,570
Yeah.

359
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,260
I think it's a six part series
or something along those lines.

360
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:22,591
See,

361
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:23,331
that's an interesting one.

362
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:23,740
Yeah.

363
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,060
Uh,

364
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,290
I'm,

365
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,820
I'm absolutely convinced most of
these guys believe what they say now.

366
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:28,060
Maybe,

367
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:31,680
maybe they're bullshitters at the
start or they only partially believe,

368
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:32,170
but they,

369
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,390
they repeat their rhetoric,

370
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,370
their followers give them
positive reinforcement.

371
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:36,240
They come to believe it.

372
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,200
And uh,

373
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,411
you know,

374
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,101
David Koresh,

375
00:09:38,101 --> 00:09:39,960
he was right down the barrel.

376
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:40,500
He choked,

377
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,333
totally believed,

378
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,930
willing to die for his beliefs.

379
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:45,300
And he also was having sex with everybody.

380
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,030
Yes.
