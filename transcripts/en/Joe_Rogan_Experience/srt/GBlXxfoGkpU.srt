1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:02,860
Two,
one end.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:04,470
We're live.
Justin ran.

3
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:05,600
How are you sir?
I'm great.

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,440
It's going on brother,
man.

5
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:10,170
I'm excited to be back here.
And they're kicking ass digging wells.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,760
All of the above trying fights.
Have you had now back in Beltour?

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,380
Only a two to uh,
but I haven't been back since the first

8
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:22,170
or second one.
So this is what you are.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,220
Yeah.
You were here before your first one,

10
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,540
which was a,
you had a long break for five years and

11
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:35,541
two months and I hadn't even really
trained any at that point.

12
00:00:35,731 --> 00:00:39,480
Like I was.
I was just doing the wells and going to

13
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,930
Congo and then uh,
got back into fighting and only had a

14
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,010
little bit of time to train,
but it's,

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,210
it was uh,
it was okay.

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,010
But this time,
do you have it for your first fight?

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,370
I think actually whenever I was here
with you,

18
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:51,400
I uh,
I,

19
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,520
I fibbed a little where I said,
uh,

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,480
it was a little longer because I didn't
know if my opponent was going to watch

21
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,050
her or whatever,
but uh,

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,780
my,
my fight camp got cut in half.

23
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,700
Um,
I was traveling,

24
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:03,390
traveling,
traveling,

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,790
the book was getting ready to come out
and other stuff and try and write the

26
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,840
book and prepare and trying to figure
all that out where were just talking

27
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:12,670
before we got on and about just life
stuff and scheduling it and everything

28
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:16,890
and they had the book and then Congo and
then telling people about it and then

29
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,340
also training for a fight and I didn't
know how to balance those real well.

30
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:20,631
But,
uh,

31
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:22,490
I play in 12 weeks,
all of a sudden,

32
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,950
Congo corruption took me to Congo for,
for three weeks at the beginning,

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,860
so we cut it down to nine weeks and then
whenever I got back or while I was

34
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:30,510
there,
I found out they were moving the fight

35
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:32,070
up on me three weeks.
Um,

36
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,860
and so it cut my camp down to about six,
seven weeks.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,070
So six,
seven weeks after being off for more

38
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:39,210
than five years.
Yeah.

39
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:42,000
And I had trained a few times before
that,

40
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,720
uh,
I mean like within the few months

41
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,553
before,
but um,

42
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,280
but I,
I think it was probably tops two months,

43
00:01:50,281 --> 00:01:52,830
a nine weeks.
We'll pause.

44
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,050
Weren't you just like,
just getting over malaria?

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,153
Yeah,
and I was,

46
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,010
uh,
that's,

47
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,710
that's the tough stuff.
That's a tougher in the fight.

48
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:03,450
I feel like.
Fuck man,

49
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,420
we have one of our guys in Congress
that's got,

50
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,610
had malaria,
one of our jewelers I just recently got

51
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,120
real sick and it's kind of like
constantly,

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,980
it's just part of life there,
Jesus.

53
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,440
And it doesn't matter what kind of
medication you take before you go out

54
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:18,140
there.
And I was actually taking a.

55
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,460
actually our director at water four was
taking,

56
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:22,140
um,
malarone.

57
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,200
It's like the best anti-malaria pill.
I think it's something like seven,

58
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,490
$8 every pill.

59
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,510
So,
uh,

60
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:30,840
it's,
it's the creme de la creme of Larry meds

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,900
and it didn't work on him and I was
actually going into Congo actually.

62
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:39,690
I stopped in London,
did one of those Ted talks at a

63
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:44,691
university called Warwick University.
And the day of the talk I was at a 100,

64
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:48,420
three degree temperature,
one to three point two.

65
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,060
And um,
and I thought it was pulling out.

66
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,080
They thought it was pulling out.
We were at the hospital for four or

67
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:55,020
five,
six hours.

68
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,460
Um,
oh,

69
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:58,920
and dude,
even the opportunity to go speak at that

70
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,020
is because their team was all fans of
jre.

71
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,160
Wow.
Yeah.

72
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,180
That's awesome.
Yeah,

73
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:06,160
that was the opportunity gap because of,
because of this.

74
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,230
And man it was,
it was,

75
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:10,120
uh,
it was tough during the talk.

76
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,380
And then,
um,

77
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,880
whenever I got into Congo they told me I
had the flu in London and the doctors

78
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:18,130
there and that's what I feel like here
to.

79
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,120
There can be tropical medical medicine
specialist here and they're probably

80
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,330
really great.
But I would trust a doctor that's lived

81
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,460
in the climate,
the tropical climate around malaria that

82
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:29,710
seen it,
that knows all the symptoms,

83
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:32,260
well knows to look for it because no one
gets it over here.

84
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,090
Yeah.
And so whenever I got into Congo,

85
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,890
I flew from,
yeah,

86
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:40,750
from work to Congo in whenever I landed,
instead of going straight to the forest,

87
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:43,500
uh,
they took me to like a air strip at a

88
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,210
hospital in the middle of nowhere.
Um,

89
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,940
so I landed,
went straight to the hospital and then

90
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,320
right there they're like,
you don't have the flu,

91
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,520
you have malaria.
And I'm like,

92
00:03:51,521 --> 00:03:52,660
but I,
I've been,

93
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,340
I've been in the states,
I just fought and then I have a in

94
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:59,590
Europe,
like there's no normal area really

95
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:01,630
there,
but it was because it's still living

96
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,230
inside me.

97
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,063
There's like,
um,

98
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,440
I think there's three strands.
One live in your body for three years,

99
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,200
five years.
I think the other is like 30 to life or

100
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,770
something.
Yeah.

101
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,720
And so it just comes back.
Yeah,

102
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:14,080
it can.
Like when your body's really rundown,

103
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,210
when you're really tired,
immune system's low,

104
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,810
like training for a fight,
like training for a fight or right after

105
00:04:19,811 --> 00:04:20,620
the fight.
Uh,

106
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,850
right off the fight.
Went to London,

107
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:23,260
spoke,
then I went to Congo.

108
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,640
But right after the fight.
So you were recovering from malaria.

109
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,550
You go through your six week fight camp,
you have your fight,

110
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,040
your rundown.
And then after the fight you got malaria

111
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,360
again?
Yes.

112
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:39,100
Now the sickness.
I've had it now three times.

113
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,560
Oh my kids.
So at least confirmed twice.

114
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,150
The third time they're like,
yeah,

115
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:44,310
you have it for sure.
But they,

116
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:48,340
you with malaria,
you have to get the test,

117
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:50,770
the blood test while you have a certain
degree,

118
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,640
temperature fever,
uh,

119
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,360
whenever it's cycling out of your liver
and coming out,

120
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:58,420
they have to draw the blood at that
exact time to get it.

121
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,800
And so that's why I was misdiagnosed
four times in the Congo and um,

122
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,760
what a sneaky fucking disease.
Yeah,

123
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,250
it's nuts.
It's crazy because they'll,

124
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,110
they'll hide in your liver and then they
send them out in your bloodstream,

125
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,480
like a,
like a platoon.

126
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,840
They go and wreck havoc and then they
retreat right back to the liver.

127
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,060
Really?
They live in your liver?

128
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,980
Yeah.
That's where they're hiding away for

129
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:20,950
three or five or 30 years.
Oh my God.

130
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:22,780
And what does,
is there any solution?

131
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,300
Is there anything they could do?
Um,

132
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,430
I don't think so.
And I had a couple of things that

133
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,050
happened where,
um,

134
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,410
you know,
I started trying to take the anti

135
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,070
malaria meds,
but I started getting,

136
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,370
it's the only medicine I've ever really
reacted to where get nauseous,

137
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,840
start dragging it.
It's awful.

138
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:38,531
Yeah.
Even,

139
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:39,820
uh,
even um,

140
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,060
oh,
I'm pasty white and I get real sun

141
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:43,894
sensitive.

142
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,300
I know another medicine called
[inaudible],

143
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,230
which is a think it's developed in
Switzerland or Sweden,

144
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,020
supposed to be an awesome new malaria
medicine.

145
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,600
It's actually the one thing my body kind
of responds to,

146
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,430
but um,
but it's actually really dangerous

147
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,950
because a,
I've seen people that are there for aid

148
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:03,200
work and different stuff.
And do they have to,

149
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,570
they have to retreat if they're there
with kids and stuff.

150
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,630
They moved there to the country they're
taking off because um,

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,970
cause kiddos or even adults have mental
breaks that they can't come back from.

152
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,980
Like you can have psychotic episodes
for.

153
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,620
I think they said like if it lasts
longer than a week,

154
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,690
it's probably in the last like three
months.

155
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,270
It will last longer than three months.
It's probably the last forever.

156
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,610
Wow.
Yeah.

157
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,191
So,
um,

158
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,660
so this is from the medication?
Yeah,

159
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:28,640
it's just the medication and it gives
you terrible,

160
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:29,960
terrible nightmares.

161
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,910
I almost went to Tanzania this summer.
What was going to go on Safari?

162
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,180
And too many people scare the shit out
of me with malaria talk.

163
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,250
Yeah,
I was going to take my whole family and

164
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:40,701
I'm like,
look,

165
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,100
I'll take some millennial malaria
medication and feel like shit,

166
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:46,220
I'm not giving it to my six year old is
not happening.

167
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,900
That would be.
I'm not doing enough when you.

168
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,060
Yeah,
but that's a real concern.

169
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,740
Right?
Tanzania has malaria as well,

170
00:06:51,741 --> 00:06:52,431
right?
Yeah,

171
00:06:52,431 --> 00:06:57,260
they do it because it's more of a,
an arid climate and we're,

172
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,840
it's,
they have less there.

173
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,750
It's not so tropical there.
I've been to Tennessee a couple times

174
00:07:02,751 --> 00:07:05,240
and seeing the bar,
I mean it's just um,

175
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,330
I met wasn't there,
but I was saw it and it was a,

176
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:09,980
I don't know,
man.

177
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,180
It's,
it's a crazy,

178
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:15,440
crazy place because you go from Congo
where they have all these tropical

179
00:07:15,441 --> 00:07:19,040
diseases and you go same continent,
you just go over a little bit and

180
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,310
there's all these other kinds of
parasites in Congo there you have very

181
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:27,230
little of a,
I believe they're called jiggers with aj

182
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,470
and I'm very careful when you say that
word,

183
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,370
but jiggers with aj I'm wrong.

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,560
It sounds like you should stop,
but they're these crazy parasites at

185
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:45,230
borough in your feet and especially kids
and elderly.

186
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,110
Um,
and especially kids and elderly.

187
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,270
Um,
well honestly,

188
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,230
I think one reason with poverty,
the kids don't get shoes until they can

189
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:56,330
work in biome and uh,
the elderly,

190
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,380
if they're not able to work and provide
for themselves and you know,

191
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,750
it's harder for them to,
to,

192
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,250
to get shoes and stuff,
but also it's just where they live

193
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,790
because on the sandy or it's either
sandy or the clash or silty soil that's

194
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:12,170
real red and Uganda,
man.

195
00:08:12,171 --> 00:08:14,810
It just wreaks havoc on those kids to
where they're having to have people come

196
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:19,811
in every week to different villages,
sit there with a safety pins and all

197
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,820
sorts of these little hooks that they
dig into people's feeds.

198
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,620
And um,
Oh God,

199
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:25,040
dude,
it's,

200
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,260
it's painful.
Whenever I've seen people getting it

201
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:28,940
done,
they're literally putting their.

202
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,240
And I've had one in my foot and it kind
of came and gone.

203
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,990
It's not that bad when it's just one,
but whenever your whole foot or your

204
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,860
whole heel or all the,
you know,

205
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,490
the balls of your feet are just covered
in.

206
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,660
I mean,
I'm talking 20,

207
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:42,291
30,
40,

208
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,560
50 of these parasites.
They're just brutal.

209
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:48,380
So every step you see them when they're
walking,

210
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,090
they're grimacing.
When you're taking it out there

211
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:53,510
screaming.
God Damn Africa.

212
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,190
Africa is just,
it's such a strange,

213
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:59,990
strange continent,
but me and the people are,

214
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,310
are beautiful in their hearts.
You know,

215
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:06,120
they're awesome.
They're a half her probably more than

216
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,410
half.
If you're not a good one,

217
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,540
you're very terrible.
Yeah,

218
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:13,380
that's simple.
Obviously from the outside,

219
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,960
that's what it looks like.
Someone like me who tries to pay

220
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:19,860
attention as much as I can,
but there's only so much you could

221
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,210
actually know about it without being
there,

222
00:09:21,211 --> 00:09:22,044
I think,
right?

223
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,850
Yeah,
I think so.

224
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:27,540
I think whenever you get there,
I don't know,

225
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,870
fall in love with the people and to
build up the relationships.

226
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,220
That's why you can see past all the
garbage,

227
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,330
all the discomfort.
You said that you were held up with

228
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,340
corruption,
Congo corruption.

229
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,930
What happened?
So they,

230
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,730
they called me and said,
um,

231
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,953
my team,
uh,

232
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,900
is Astrid Papa.
Papa y is like a father figure to me.

233
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,960
He's the one that had this vision.
I came alongside him and it's just been,

234
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:55,440
it's been awesome to see what's happened
in um,

235
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,860
whenever I went to him.
Actually.

236
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,570
What,
what was the question?

237
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,590
You're just asking.
I don't even remember what I say.

238
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,300
I said about the corruption corruption
there.

239
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:06,841
Yeah,
yeah.

240
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:10,650
He called me and said a fat you to get
back here and like three weeks and I'm

241
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,520
like,
what?

242
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,700
I'm training for the fight,
like it's coming up and I can't leave.

243
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,080
No,
he says if you don't come back.

244
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:18,420
No.
Like I don't know when you can come

245
00:10:18,421 --> 00:10:19,110
back,
they'll,

246
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,290
they're going to revoke your visa.
They're going to.

247
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:23,460
And I'm like,
what for?

248
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,230
And so they said,
check your passport.

249
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,990
They said your visa is expiring in three
weeks.

250
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,760
And I'm like,
it should be expiring.

251
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:32,880
I have a five year visa,
but then you have to come in and out of

252
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,830
the country every 11 months because if
you don't,

253
00:10:34,831 --> 00:10:39,360
you lose that five year visa.
And so whenever I left with my wife,

254
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:44,390
literally they just so that they can get
money out of us and steel and build,

255
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:50,550
asked for 1400,
sometimes $2,500 to get a visa like

256
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:51,800
this.
Um,

257
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,511
you know,
they,

258
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:54,470
they write down on your visa when they
stamp it,

259
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,210
the date they write it in.
And so now I know,

260
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,640
look,
every single time they're writing to

261
00:10:59,641 --> 00:11:03,510
make sure they write the right date
because she backdated it like six months

262
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,360
or something like that,
or maybe nine months and then all of a

263
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,010
sudden I had to get back there because
they're like,

264
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:08,970
nope,
it's gonna expire.

265
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,340
And they thought they gave him.
Actually it might've been less than

266
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:13,170
three weeks.
I think it had to go for three weeks is

267
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:16,530
what happened because I like a week
notice I just took off when it's

268
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:19,090
actually the cheapest trip I've ever got
there because it was like the last seat

269
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,180
I was by the toilets in the back the
whole time.

270
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,770
But there's only $800 round trip,
which was incredible.

271
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,570
That's pretty crazy.
You can go to Africa for 800 bucks.

272
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,433
Yeah,
that was,

273
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,650
I never seen it like that,
but it was a good school.

274
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,780
So I went and I mean it helped because
that saved me some money that was going

275
00:11:35,781 --> 00:11:38,040
to have to pay to try to get out of the
corruption and stuff.

276
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,750
But luckily we went there,
they didn't think I would just dropping,

277
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,930
you know,
be there in five,

278
00:11:42,931 --> 00:11:43,764
six,
seven days.

279
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,970
So I took off,
went and we spent three weeks trying to

280
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,730
just negotiate with the courts and
everything else and say,

281
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:51,720
look,
this is,

282
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,950
you guys did this,
you sent me an up all this other stuff

283
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:55,840
and trying to prove them wrong.
They're never wrong,

284
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,890
you know,
they're always right.

285
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,010
And uh,
trying to show them even receipts and

286
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:02,020
pictures,
we were showing them pictures from Ben's

287
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,670
wedding.
He's like my best friend,

288
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:05,620
like a brother,
a translator for me.

289
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,460
He's our team leader and I'm literally,
we're showing pictures of me at his

290
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:12,580
wedding and luckily it was dated and
everything,

291
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:16,990
like I was here in the country when you
said I had already left for five months

292
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,610
before.
So,

293
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:19,291
um,
it's just not,

294
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,460
it's like the backdating is intentional
to do it.

295
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,000
I'll do it on purpose.
So that for me and my wife,

296
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:25,930
both,
they,

297
00:12:25,931 --> 00:12:28,030
uh,
they made it the same date which was

298
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,220
like six months or eight months early.

299
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,890
I'm like,
we left earlier than what we did.

300
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,500
So from the outside,
when you're visiting them,

301
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:37,230
did they,
do they think somehow or another that

302
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:40,870
you're wealthy and that they can take
advantage of you?

303
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,730
They know,
they know you're on television,

304
00:12:42,731 --> 00:12:43,970
do they know all that?
No,

305
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,410
no,
we keep that really kind of when I'm,

306
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:50,560
there I am a,
let me see if I can get the right.

307
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,400
I am a professor of appropriate
technologies that appropriate

308
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:59,200
technologies or like a community
development or sustainable solutions and

309
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,650
I go there and I'm teaching the students
at the university how to,

310
00:13:02,651 --> 00:13:05,260
uh,
and only I only do like a week or two

311
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:07,930
seminar with them.
The rest of them with my well drilling

312
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:11,700
team and that's my covering.
I go there as a quote unquote a

313
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:13,990
professor commission give that up on the
Internet.

314
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,190
Yeah,
I'm even people.

315
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,070
No,
no,

316
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:16,901
no.
It's okay.

317
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,630
But I do that because,
you know,

318
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:24,631
when I go in and really it's not because
I'm on TV or anything like that or they

319
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:27,670
think I have money,
they just think anyone that's not

320
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:31,240
Congolese has money.
And so because that's what they've seen

321
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:35,140
from people coming in and throwing money
around.

322
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,060
So they want their.
Yeah,

323
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:40,210
in a lot of the ngos are like,
they,

324
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,920
they have quotas and everything else and
the other just a huge budget and they

325
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:45,380
got to spend it.
They got to meet those,

326
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,460
those quotas.
So sometimes they throw it around and

327
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:51,010
they're not,
they're not trying to be frugal with the

328
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:53,680
money because it's not theirs.
They didn't go out and get it or

329
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,500
fundraising or get a grant for it or
anything like that.

330
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:59,800
It just got to spend.
So they'll just give it away.

331
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:03,300
Do the people that live in the Congo,
like the,

332
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:05,020
the pygmies,
do they still get malaria?

333
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,410
Is it really common with them yet?
We're really common.

334
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,170
Um,
but it's,

335
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,670
it's,
um,

336
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,010
it's weird because whenever people come,
I guess they're more acclimated to it,

337
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,520
but it still kills so many.
Um,

338
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,840
and then,
but whenever I get it,

339
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,713
they're,
they're saying,

340
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,140
you know,
the doctor here told me because of the

341
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:28,630
malaria meds,
it would be better for you to go because

342
00:14:28,631 --> 00:14:30,580
you're already getting sick,
too sick with medicine,

343
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,380
just go get malaria and then get it
diagnosed quick enough,

344
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,550
get the cure and now your body's
actually gonna adapt to it and the next

345
00:14:39,551 --> 00:14:40,950
time you get it will be less and less
women.

346
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,910
So they told you to get malaria.
Fucking Christ one of the worst diseases

347
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,910
person can get.
Right?

348
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:48,400
Yeah.
But honestly I've seen people,

349
00:14:48,401 --> 00:14:51,590
even even Ben Ben's nuts,
like the year that I was there,

350
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:55,490
he had malaria,
now it's almost killed them before too,

351
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,520
but he had malaria like three or four
times in a year.

352
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,520
And um,
and it just kind of really,

353
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:04,760
really common there.
But once you,

354
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,460
if you can survive it the first couple
times,

355
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,910
then they say after that it gets more
bearable because you feel it coming.

356
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:15,911
You feel the heat waves coming over you.
And then you fill the shoulder joint

357
00:15:16,371 --> 00:15:20,450
pains and elbows and it just down your
whole spine and your finger joints are

358
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:22,970
just throbbing,
like you can feel your pulse.

359
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,670
So it's an inflammation disease.
Uh,

360
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:29,000
it's a blood parasite disease and had
just a.

361
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,060
But it causes some inflammation.
The parasite somehow or another does

362
00:15:32,061 --> 00:15:33,000
that to your joints.
Yeah.

363
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,890
And it released causes a lot of pain.
I know that.

364
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,753
And it,
uh,

365
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,250
it was,
it.

366
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,290
I lost 33 pounds,
five days.

367
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,090
Um,
Jesus Christ,

368
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:43,640
33 pounds in five days.
Thirty three pounds.

369
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,780
Dr Oz,
Dr. Oz would sell that I could.

370
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:49,310
I could be in here.

371
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,690
I got a new,
a la diet for he can he really do the

372
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:55,470
Congo Diet?
Really hot,

373
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,110
too hot.
So that's a massive sacrifice.

374
00:16:00,111 --> 00:16:03,260
You're willing to take time to do that.
And this,

375
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,070
the fact that it's,
it exists inside your body for an

376
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:09,590
undetermined stated time.
That's um,

377
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,910
that's pretty wild,
man.

378
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,070
It's,
it's scary.

379
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,250
Um,
yeah.

380
00:16:16,251 --> 00:16:19,040
Honestly,
I feel like I was in a much scarier

381
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:24,041
place personally before,
before I found this before I found them

382
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:29,920
before I got given a second family or
accepted into a second family and even

383
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,700
more scarier because you were depressed
because you just will depress suicidal

384
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,550
thoughts.
I had for like 10 years,

385
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,830
just battled it from 13 years old,
23.

386
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,410
And so,
um,

387
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:42,963
so yeah,
that,

388
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:47,450
that was a lot scarier to me than
suicidal thoughts when you're 13.

389
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,260
Yeah,
for sure.

390
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,960
And I mean I was,
I was the one that like,

391
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:52,160
you know,
the kid in the,

392
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,160
in the class that,
I mean I wasn't,

393
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,750
I wasn't like,
I wouldn't say I was,

394
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,633
how do I say it?

395
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:02,190
It was extremely brutal,
but it was happening to.

396
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:04,160
I mean everyone gets bullied for the
most part.

397
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,470
Somebody is bullying you.
Yeah.

398
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,030
Well,
when I was growing up that from,

399
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:10,940
from third grade until eighth grade for
sure,

400
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,240
it was brutal.
Seventh and he throws me usually smaller

401
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:16,450
than I was like,
dude,

402
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,450
I was smaller.
It takes a lot of balls to bully you and

403
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,670
a backfire.
It's actually kind of why I found

404
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,280
fighting or net,
why it is kind.

405
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,220
It is because a,
I was 13 years old and I had just gotten

406
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,450
so well.
Two things.

407
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:35,960
Have you ever seen in Texas for high
school homecomings?

408
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,120
They have mums.
Have you heard of that?

409
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,030
Now it's a mom fixes tradition.
That's crazy.

410
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,673
Now.
All,

411
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,120
all,
all the kids love them.

412
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,930
Everything else.
But you get these corsages or fake

413
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:52,470
flowers that they put real big up top
and then they are streamers with literal

414
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,320
bells and whistles,
full sized teddy bears.

415
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,420
You can have two,
three teddy bears and when I was in high

416
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:58,470
school,
the girl would wear it on her,

417
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,420
her shoulder and the weird around his
arm.

418
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,970
Now in Texas,
they literally have to put a harness

419
00:18:02,971 --> 00:18:06,000
around him and hold these things up
because they're so big and there you go.

420
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:10,630
Texas my fuck
that.

421
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,450
That's homecoming in Texas.
Why?

422
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,250
Look at that?
I'm telling you,

423
00:18:14,251 --> 00:18:16,620
it's the whole state,
the whole state.

424
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,130
I mean every,
every homecoming that comes around tech

425
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,540
Texans are nuts about this.
I mean,

426
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,760
I lived in Texas and I was like four
months old,

427
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:26,490
so it was a.
they're nuts and they've gotten bigger

428
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:29,020
and bigger and bigger every single year
and a.

429
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,230
How am I just hearing about the proud of
it?

430
00:18:31,231 --> 00:18:33,780
It's weird.
I mean just hearing about this Jamie.

431
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,780
I think those are literally like two and
$300.

432
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:37,980
No.
Yeah.

433
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,170
When I was in high school,
they're like 7,100.

434
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,400
Oh my God.
Look at all those girls.

435
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,700
Look at that picture that you had done
there.

436
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:44,400
There's giant group of girls with all
this.

437
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,620
This is ridiculous.
That not nuts.

438
00:18:46,621 --> 00:18:48,420
How do you.
How do you go to the dance like that?

439
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,570
How do you go to the game like that?
I don't understand.

440
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,750
Literally the boyfriends are walking
behind him holding the stuff up for him

441
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:57,450
because why aren't the.
It's getting too heavy or their neck

442
00:18:57,451 --> 00:18:58,820
hurts,
but they want to wear it.

443
00:18:58,821 --> 00:18:59,740
It's a tradition.
Yeah.

444
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,260
Everybody gets excited.
The bigger and the bigger the mom,

445
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,030
the better.
The more,

446
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,540
the more your date to you.
Is this a mom company that you just

447
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:13,320
clicked on every single grocery store in
Texas?

448
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,890
Why?
Whenever it comes to like a September,

449
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:17,431
October,
November,

450
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,870
around homecoming time,
high school.

451
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,900
Like this is people's jobs,
like seasonal jobs.

452
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,400
He sit around and they take special
orders.

453
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:26,010
They make them for you or they sound
where he can make them yourself.

454
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,010
That's so strange.
Isn't it?

455
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,640
Nuts?
How many is this?

456
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,710
It always baffles me when I find out
about something for the very first time.

457
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,460
I don't know why I'm so confused by it.
I would like to find out where the

458
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:39,294
traditional,
uh,

459
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,570
came from probably.
But I mean people are just so ingrained

460
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,910
in you.
If you're texting that you have to get

461
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:46,050
moms.
And so,

462
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,790
uh,
is there any other students find out if

463
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:50,280
other states except that I literally,
Oklahoma doesn't do it.

464
00:19:50,281 --> 00:19:51,760
Louisiana doesn't.
New Mexico,

465
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,930
Texas,
twelfth things.

466
00:19:54,931 --> 00:19:58,610
Non Texas.
Need to know about homecoming moms.

467
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,290
What in the fuck your mom started as a
simple flower.

468
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,610
Hold on,
scroll up a little bit.

469
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:10,380
Mum started as a simple flower.
Guys give them to their homecoming date.

470
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,120
Oh,
that's hilarious.

471
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:15,570
Girls also give guys one called a
garter,

472
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,930
like a gardener.
Other you put it on your on your arm or

473
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,780
garter belt or over here side.
How busy.

474
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,870
Like one of those things that tie boxer.
Yeah.

475
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,570
Being able to make moms can make you
rich.

476
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:28,680
Oh God.
See?

477
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:33,681
Sixty to $300.
$300 for fake flowers on her bucks.

478
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,200
It ain't cheap to electrify a mom.
Oh my God.

479
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,750
That's so crazy.
You can put led lighting.

480
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:43,731
Look at that.
Scroll up,

481
00:20:43,731 --> 00:20:46,410
scroll up a little bit,
but you can put led lighting and moms.

482
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,640
I didn't know how many are doing this
back when I was in high school,

483
00:20:48,641 --> 00:20:50,500
but nowadays you really want to impress
your date.

484
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,580
The latest and mum lighting technology
will help you do just that.

485
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,290
That is hilarious.
You know,

486
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,890
this isn't even like a juke website
right now.

487
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,850
They're taking it serious,
real serious,

488
00:21:01,851 --> 00:21:03,880
strange [inaudible].

489
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,570
It's really weird.
And so when I was in middle school,

490
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,090
seventh grade,
I

491
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,140
got a Christmas tree on her tits.
That's ridiculous.

492
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,400
They uh,
uh,

493
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,280
so you want to save?
I saved it up and my allowance asked one

494
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,980
of my crushes to go to the homecoming
game with me.

495
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,220
She said yes to my surprise,
went to the game and uh,

496
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,700
spent pretty much all my allowance on a,
the her mom and uh,

497
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,080
her name's Jessica and I took her to the
game and uh,

498
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:40,600
I'm up in the stands with her and home
or halftime comes around.

499
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:45,100
I'm up to the very top left and all of a
sudden everyone looks back up over the

500
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:48,670
right shoulders at us.
And this one guy,

501
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:53,260
he was Kinda my,
my belief through elementary and middle

502
00:21:53,261 --> 00:21:55,240
school for sure.
And um,

503
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,220
his name was justin as well.
And so he walks up and puts his arm out

504
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,510
to her and she puts her arm around his
and he grabs the streamer that says,

505
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:07,390
uh,
Justin and Jessica and the year on it or

506
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:07,900
whatever.

507
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,830
And uh,
he says,

508
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,480
thanks for getting her this.
And I'm like,

509
00:22:10,481 --> 00:22:11,081
what?
And he goes,

510
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,250
you didn't think she'd come with you,
did you?

511
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,640
And so he just kind of walks down all
the schools looking.

512
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,620
They're all laughing and having fun.
But,

513
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,910
and,
and that one hurt,

514
00:22:18,911 --> 00:22:20,770
but what was worse with the next year,
because,

515
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,920
you know,
people liked that part of,

516
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,083
I don't know,
I think

517
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,450
for me,
when I see bullying now,

518
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,830
I just spoke at a middle school and I
told one of the teachers asked,

519
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,150
what should you tell a kid that's
battling with suicidal thoughts or

520
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:39,970
depression even,
maybe suicidal thoughts.

521
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,283
And I'm like,
well,

522
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:43,210
if this is 300,
400 kids in here,

523
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:47,710
like for sure one person is dealing with
these issues right now.

524
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,690
And I would say,
you know,

525
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:54,310
the thing that probably saved me was my
parents didn't own a gun.

526
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:56,530
I'd probably only Texans that don't own
guns.

527
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,670
And uh,
then,

528
00:22:57,671 --> 00:22:59,330
um,
I don't know.

529
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:04,350
I mean,
I guess one of the main things was um,

530
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,100
well I don't even know that I've ever
said this publicly,

531
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,200
but I remember,
um,

532
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:16,170
having attempted suicide once and then
I'm thinking about it again and then I'm

533
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,500
thinking,
you know,

534
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,960
what would this,
what would the student,

535
00:23:19,961 --> 00:23:20,890
my mom,
you know.

536
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,260
And so I love my mom.
I'm a mama's boy.

537
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,360
Dad's great too.
But that's just who I am.

538
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:28,600
She's a tough cookie.
She's where I got my competitiveness.

539
00:23:28,601 --> 00:23:30,910
She was a national champion in barrel
racing,

540
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,490
state champion in tennis.
And so she always pushed me,

541
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,720
my dad,
if he,

542
00:23:34,721 --> 00:23:36,610
uh,
if he was at a wrestling tournament and

543
00:23:36,611 --> 00:23:39,850
it's the finals even state,
I would dislocate my thumb or something

544
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:41,500
to come up.
You don't have to wrestle in the next

545
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,540
match.

546
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,760
Like it's the finals.
My Mom's like,

547
00:23:42,761 --> 00:23:44,290
he's getting out there.
So my mom,

548
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,440
mom's the one pushing him,
shut up,

549
00:23:45,441 --> 00:23:47,750
Jimmy,
he's going gonna he's going to go out

550
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,160
there and he's going to wrestle him.
He's going to win.

551
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:53,320
And so my dad was more of one wanting to
protect me and she's the one who pushed

552
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,990
me out there.
Um,

553
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,910
so I guess,
uh,

554
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,850
saying that except for,
oh,

555
00:23:58,851 --> 00:24:01,820
that thought was just ringing in my
head.

556
00:24:01,821 --> 00:24:05,480
And so whenever I finally verbalized
that and start talking to people,

557
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,160
that's what really helped,
you know,

558
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:09,730
it didn't have to be a bunch of people
that didn't have to go around and be,

559
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,350
um,
I don't know,

560
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,120
a drama queen or do it for attention or
whatever,

561
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:19,121
but just find one person and for me at
that age it was having a great mom and

562
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,730
um,
parents that loved me and I think that's

563
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,000
probably absolutely what saved me at
that time.

564
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,500
And so I was telling these kids,
you know,

565
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:29,330
hey,
tell if even if it's just your mom.

566
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,900
So I was taking pictures with some of
the kids afterwards and stuff and I'll

567
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,770
walk out to leave and I'm in the hall in
this mom stops me because she's with her

568
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,860
little guy and he's crying.
So a mom had come to school.

569
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,660
I had heard there was anti anti-bullying
doc.

570
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,290
She came up and I see this little guy,
he reminded me,

571
00:24:45,291 --> 00:24:46,940
a lot of me,
the only difference was,

572
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,670
uh,
was he had these kind of big glasses on,

573
00:24:49,671 --> 00:24:54,671
but he was a little chubby and had just
had one of those things that you'd see

574
00:24:54,741 --> 00:24:57,080
stereotypical,
like this kid's going to get picked on.

575
00:24:57,590 --> 00:25:02,590
And so I'm probably a lot like me.
He's used to getting his fat pinch tune,

576
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:05,780
nipples twisted and you know,
all that different stuff.

577
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,180
And so,
um,

578
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,830
he was out there just balling with his
mom.

579
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,600
His mom asked if I can talk to him for a
little bit.

580
00:25:11,601 --> 00:25:16,601
I did and she was saying that he had
never opened up with her and uh,

581
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,220
in the last two years,
but she knew he had been dealing with

582
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,710
really bad depression and right there he
told her,

583
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,720
I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts
for two years.

584
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:27,460
And so I don't know why I even brought
that up except for like,

585
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,620
it's nuts.
My parents have a,

586
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,710
have a photography company and they made
a memorial a few years back for a little

587
00:25:33,861 --> 00:25:38,420
boy who was getting bullied.
Didn't think he had an option out and he

588
00:25:38,421 --> 00:25:41,190
took his life at nine years old.
Oh my goodness.

589
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,520
Well,
I think it was a swing set out back.

590
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,240
So I'm like,
oh Jesus Christ.

591
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,650
And so,
um,

592
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,000
I saw the plaque and everything made up
for them and just gut wrenching.

593
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,120
And so as I say that in the first story
wasn't kind of one that kind of brought

594
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,650
everything to a head was I was in middle
eighth grade this time,

595
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,180
um,
got invited to a Jennifer's birthday

596
00:26:08,181 --> 00:26:10,220
party.
Really excited.

597
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:12,920
I got one of the real limitations in my
hands and

598
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,150
made the plans talk to my mom,
asked if I could go talk to some of the

599
00:26:17,151 --> 00:26:20,240
people who else is going.
That was just kind of a Dorky kid

600
00:26:20,241 --> 00:26:21,074
anyways.
But,

601
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,520
um,
uh,

602
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,320
on the invitation I noticed,
man,

603
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:27,050
it says costume contest and the winner
gets a prize.

604
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,150
Why certain research,
all this other stuff,

605
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,020
other people are doing it too.
And um,

606
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,130
I found out that her dad worked at Dr
Pepper in that their house was decorated

607
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,000
with all this other stuff.
And then,

608
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,430
um,
and then she loved transformers.

609
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,860
And so I thought,
what if I combine two things,

610
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,270
what if I could meet myself a cardboard
transformer from head to toe?

611
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:52,350
I think it was a 24 pack or only had 12
packs around the arms,

612
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,270
legs,
boots I had.

613
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,600
I had a chest plate at a sword out of
cardboard,

614
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:01,230
a country kid texted you see those moms,
we can do pretty much anything with duct

615
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,610
tape.
And uh,

616
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:05,790
so duct tape,
cardboard just made it up and walked

617
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,300
into the party.
And um,

618
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,910
her grandma opened the door.
She goes,

619
00:27:08,911 --> 00:27:10,410
oh,
Jennifer's going to love this.

620
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,560
Walked into.
They literally had a Dr Pepper machine

621
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:15,200
where it was like old school ones you
didn't have to pay,

622
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,740
just push the button.
It pops out.

623
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,180
Thirteen year old kid.
He loved that.

624
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:23,220
So we had dr pepper can one end of the
Dr Pepper Cardboard Sword in the other

625
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,190
walk to the backyard when whenever the
door opens,

626
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,380
I opened the door and breathe there with
like some flashes of lights and fingers

627
00:27:31,381 --> 00:27:32,490
pointing,
people laughing.

628
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,440
And um,
I remember Jennifer saying,

629
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,200
can't believe you thought you were cool
enough to come to my party.

630
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,970
And I was the only one that was dressed
up.

631
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,730
Everybody else had gotten there early
and they all been planning and even the

632
00:27:41,731 --> 00:27:44,670
invitations are fake just so that I
would come there and dress up.

633
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,420
Another kid said,
I'm,

634
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,690
you're worthless.
So in that moment I felt worthless.

635
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,350
And then,
um,

636
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,880
the main bully said you should just kill
yourself.

637
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,110
And so whenever he said that,
13 years old battle with depression and

638
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:59,940
suicidal thoughts,
all that different stuff minute,

639
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,570
it took me on a downward spiral
tailspin.

640
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,240
It really sucked.
I didn't know how to cover it up.

641
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,680
And then I guess I'm getting back to
them and may route where I found that 13

642
00:28:10,681 --> 00:28:15,360
years old at like a flea market in the
Texas and walking down these aisles and

643
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,670
looking for a bb gun and all of a sudden
I get to the site,

644
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:20,610
used video shop and it's got UFC vhs.

645
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,910
I think it was two through 10 or 10 to
11 or something like that.

646
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:24,900
And,
um,

647
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,900
so I just let bottom all you were on
there and do that as a horrible story,

648
00:28:30,271 --> 00:28:32,910
man.
That is a terrible story.

649
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:37,260
How the fuck does kids be so mean?
I mean that is honestly,

650
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,880
I don't think it's,
I mean that crazy compared to,

651
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:46,000
I mean it is,
it's very like a methodical,

652
00:28:46,001 --> 00:28:48,330
like very planned out.
I'm in,

653
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:50,520
a lot of people were in on it.
I think that probably was one of the

654
00:28:50,521 --> 00:28:53,280
things like,
honestly Jennifer was that the biggest

655
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,740
crush I ever had in,
you know,

656
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,420
elementary,
middle school growing up,

657
00:28:57,421 --> 00:28:59,400
you know.
And so she was the one that really

658
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:01,140
wanted impressed.
That's why I did that research,

659
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:01,861
you know?
And then you know,

660
00:29:01,861 --> 00:29:04,110
that she was in on it.
These other guys planned it,

661
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:06,120
but she went along with it,
um,

662
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,780
to her to have her say that to you,
like the,

663
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,910
I can't believe you thought you were
cool enough to come to my party.

664
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,750
Yeah.
Fuck man.

665
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah.
I ended up leaving.

666
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,090
Um,
and this is before cell phones.

667
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,410
I didn't have a cell phone until I was
like 16 and 17 and I'm,

668
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,910
so I'm 13,
run out,

669
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,410
found a dairy queen.
And,

670
00:29:28,411 --> 00:29:31,980
uh,
when the back and where the drive

671
00:29:31,981 --> 00:29:32,970
through is,
there was like a,

672
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,670
I don't know,
the dumpster and they get like the fence

673
00:29:35,671 --> 00:29:38,190
around it and I just was able to open
it,

674
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:42,760
sit there and just cried basically until
someone came out to throw away the

675
00:29:42,761 --> 00:29:44,380
trash.
And then they're like,

676
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,690
oh,
how many got down,

677
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,620
what do you need?
And all this other stuff.

678
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:48,850
Can you call your mom?
I'm like,

679
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,610
if I have a phone.
And so I walked inside,

680
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,320
called her,
but she wasn't there.

681
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:55,930
So took a little while to get ahold of
my mom.

682
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,943
And then,
um,

683
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,503
yeah,
I mean it was just,

684
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:03,160
it was nuts because it's weird how you,
you will believe,

685
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:07,200
especially in today's age with social
media and all the tweets and things that

686
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,043
people just throw away.

687
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,670
I throw around,
um,

688
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,841
you know,
it's nuts.

689
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,460
How can see somebody don't even know
them.

690
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,790
They might have one follower,
but somehow it can still,

691
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,880
if you let it,
it can still affect you instead of just

692
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,030
shrugging it off.
That's a totally different thing though.

693
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:25,930
So insanely something on twitter and
someone saying something and looking you

694
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:26,870
in the eyes.
Yeah.

695
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,010
And planning out this big deception.
Yeah.

696
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,740
But you're such a nice guy.
I got to understand what,

697
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,270
what the fuck.
Cause it's selling to be such a shithead

698
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,330
like that.
Well,

699
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,800
I don't know man.
I think,

700
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,840
I think um,
I've,

701
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,160
I've matured a lot where,
I mean obviously 20 minutes at 13,

702
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,810
but uh,
uh,

703
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:52,590
I think I just became an easy target and
because you're just a nice guy and they

704
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:54,970
just,
maybe I wouldn't stand up for myself and

705
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
maybe I wasn't the biggest kid,
but I was Chubby and bigger and uh,

706
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,230
uh,
yeah,

707
00:31:02,231 --> 00:31:04,600
I think it just was easy to pick on me
in the locker rooms,

708
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,434
pick on me in the.

709
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,420
I don't know,
I think I think have the stats I was

710
00:31:07,421 --> 00:31:11,680
looking at with something like 87
percent of bullying doesn't happen in

711
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:14,800
the presence of
adults.

712
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:15,634
Adults.
Right.

713
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,470
And then,
uh,

714
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,260
I forget,
but you know,

715
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,430
even the people around like how you're
saying,

716
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,770
you know,
two people plan it out and everything

717
00:31:23,771 --> 00:31:26,620
else look you in the eyes.
I think that might've been what took me

718
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:29,020
back the most because I was like,
man,

719
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:33,540
like this is if you're sitting by,
this is what I tried to tell some of the

720
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:38,541
kiddos growing up now it's like if you
think that by laughing at me or if

721
00:31:39,071 --> 00:31:40,810
you're there and you're not bullying,
but you're giggling,

722
00:31:40,811 --> 00:31:42,400
you're laughing,
like you're definitely a part of it.

723
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,920
You're an encourager,
but then if you're,

724
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,930
even if you're silent and you're just
watching it and you don't like now your.

725
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:50,710
If you see it,
you have a choice.

726
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,490
You do something bad at your economic.
And so I feel like that's a passive

727
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:58,930
standby kind of encouragement where in.
So for me it was like everyone was

728
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:00,610
there,
people were saying it,

729
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,890
people were laughing,
people were watching,

730
00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,020
but nobody was standing up for me.
So it was a think that was what hurt the

731
00:32:08,021 --> 00:32:08,854
most.
We'll see.

732
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,760
So there's two giant instances.
The one with the other guy named Justin,

733
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:17,820
so they plan that out to fuck man.
You went to school with little kids?

734
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:20,140
Yeah,
it was actually part of the same kids.

735
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,490
So yeah.
Damn.

736
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,231
Yeah.
And then,

737
00:32:23,231 --> 00:32:24,940
uh,
so from that,

738
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,860
um,
yeah,

739
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:27,340
that,
that's,

740
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,340
that's definitely been the biggest
battle of my life has been depression,

741
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,440
suicidal thoughts,
and it was all from that bullying.

742
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:38,620
There was nothing other than that for
the depression.

743
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,320
Yeah.

744
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:43,250
Yeah.
I mean it went from technically I would

745
00:32:43,251 --> 00:32:46,310
say I went from third grade to 10th
grade and then whenever I started

746
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:48,170
wrestling and my parents transferred me
out of the school,

747
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,170
everything else then.
But the bullying is what caused all

748
00:32:51,171 --> 00:32:54,090
these suicidal thoughts.
There's nothing else that was bombed you

749
00:32:54,091 --> 00:32:59,091
out about life that is so fucked up at
some shitty mean kids can all of a

750
00:32:59,781 --> 00:33:01,790
sudden throw this monkey wrench in your
life.

751
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:04,720
And then I've,
I've learned,

752
00:33:04,721 --> 00:33:07,610
and I mean,
of course you know,

753
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,120
a lot.
I used to looking back at it,

754
00:33:09,121 --> 00:33:11,930
it shouldn't have.
I shouldn't have ever let it get to the

755
00:33:11,931 --> 00:33:14,010
point to where,
you know,

756
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,220
I think I should hurt myself or kill me.
You know what?

757
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,590
Just a real quick put that together with
the pygmies and Congo,

758
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,680
whenever I opened up and shared with
some of them around the campfire,

759
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,630
just hanging out,
talking,

760
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,170
sharing life stories.

761
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:32,710
I shared that and I just remember the
looks on several people's faces just so

762
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:37,760
baffled.
Like did he just say he wanted to hurt

763
00:33:37,761 --> 00:33:39,230
himself?
You suicide.

764
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:41,720
He wanted to kill himself.
I'll let him and stuff and then I start

765
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:44,570
asking me does that not happen here?
And they're like,

766
00:33:44,571 --> 00:33:45,590
whoa.
Some of them were like,

767
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,690
well,
we've heard of that happening before and

768
00:33:47,691 --> 00:33:48,390
yeah,
there's,

769
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,540
there's this guy that was that guy and
that guy and that guy.

770
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:54,140
We heard that someone in their village
had hurt themselves or killed themselves

771
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:56,810
or something,
but most of the people I think were

772
00:33:56,811 --> 00:33:57,540
like,
no,

773
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,750
I've never heard.
Why would anyone.

774
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,920
If you hurt yourself,
you're only like,

775
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,590
it's only hurting you.
That's not going to help anything.

776
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,440
We just wanted the pain to end.
Yeah.

777
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:08,240
Yeah.
Here I just wanted the pain to end,

778
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:10,490
but there it's like it's not because
they.

779
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:13,310
If,
if I look at it as a little kid,

780
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:16,820
I got bullied by something,
some stupid kids,

781
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:22,450
and then look at if I look at what
they're going through and it makes it,

782
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:25,610
it makes it,
it shrinks it,

783
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:29,810
it makes it microscopic.
Whenever you stop just focusing on your

784
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:32,120
own problems and you start looking at
others,

785
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:35,600
other problems that maybe you can be a
part of helping solve that problem.

786
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:40,970
So this bullying all throughout your
childhood led into adulthood and the

787
00:34:42,111 --> 00:34:46,940
only thing that made it better was you
go into the Congo and helping out these

788
00:34:46,941 --> 00:34:51,590
pygmies and building wells and,
and sort of dedicating and devoting your

789
00:34:51,591 --> 00:34:54,110
life to their life.
Yeah.

790
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,670
I would say practically that has been,
you know,

791
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:01,310
to have a sense of purpose.
I mean I think it's a,

792
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,150
it's a lot of different things,
but that all Kinda came together.

793
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,030
But for me,
yeah,

794
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,520
I mean when you're not living for
yourself and you live in for others,

795
00:35:10,521 --> 00:35:11,780
you just want.
I mean,

796
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,090
I didn't know that for me,
I had a big paradigm shift or change in

797
00:35:17,091 --> 00:35:18,650
my life.
Whenever you know,

798
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,150
coming out of the addiction,
I felt like,

799
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,280
I mean,
like I don't have to walk around and hit

800
00:35:22,281 --> 00:35:24,730
myself in,
stay away from people because they're

801
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,930
either going to hurt me or I'm going to
want to hurt them.

802
00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:28,123
Like,
uh,

803
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,800
I don't have to do that.
I can,

804
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,030
I can help people.
I can want to love them.

805
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:33,550
I can,
you know,

806
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,770
figure out something that I did at first
started at what really started helping a

807
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:40,200
lot.
Was involved with a lot of different

808
00:35:40,201 --> 00:35:43,770
stuff from a juvenile detention center.
Going in and meeting with some of those

809
00:35:43,771 --> 00:35:48,771
kids once a week to a homeless shelter
to becoming a official volunteer at the

810
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,830
Denver Children's hospital and taking
the grudge guys through there.

811
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,830
And I think like Rashad and Dwayne and
Shane Carlin and Brendan and all these

812
00:35:58,681 --> 00:35:59,251
guys,
you know,

813
00:35:59,251 --> 00:36:02,520
they were going and they actually saw me
going through the really tough,

814
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,610
uh,
addictions and getting kicked off grudge

815
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:10,500
fight team.
And then a year later I'm luckily able

816
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,590
to organize an event where the.
They wouldn't let us come in just as

817
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:15,960
fighters to visit the kids because they
were like,

818
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,180
fighters,
why would you guys come and visit us?

819
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,190
And uh,
that's violent.

820
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,250
And so I decided to become a volunteer
here,

821
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,310
go through all the processes and the
training and all the other stuff.

822
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,090
And then I love volunteering there.
And then after they got to know me,

823
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:30,983
I'm like,
Hey,

824
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:35,910
can we do a team visit us in there?
The best visit they had ever had was the

825
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,530
bikers.
I'm like,

826
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:40,560
this biker gang guys.
They always brought pizza on Wednesday

827
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,393
night or something.

828
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:43,740
And uh,
and they literally did look,

829
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,780
look rough and tumble.
And um,

830
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,310
and then they said ours was a second
pass.

831
00:36:47,311 --> 00:36:48,500
And I'm like,
you know,

832
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:49,890
and they said,
well,

833
00:36:49,891 --> 00:36:51,780
I won't say the teams,
but some of the other,

834
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,730
uh,
big major league sports,

835
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,980
they said those have been any named some
of them.

836
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,930
And they're like,
they've been some of your absolute

837
00:36:57,931 --> 00:36:58,970
worst.
I'm like,

838
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,270
man,
see you thought fighters are going to

839
00:37:00,271 --> 00:37:02,550
come in here and I don't know if you
thought were going to beat up the kids

840
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,384
or something.
But,

841
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,470
but uh,
no,

842
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,870
we were passionate about the sport.
I mean,

843
00:37:06,871 --> 00:37:11,310
I think passionate means you love
something so much that you'll suffer for

844
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:15,360
it were,
or even a suffering looks like

845
00:37:15,361 --> 00:37:19,320
enjoyment.
Our becomes enjoyment because you love

846
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:21,630
it and you're passionate about it.
And so,

847
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:24,390
I mean whenever you're a fighter,
you're getting beat up and all the other

848
00:37:24,391 --> 00:37:24,720
stuff.

849
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,380
And we,
man,

850
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,520
we're,
we're passionate people.

851
00:37:26,521 --> 00:37:31,521
We really love each other.
It's all team come camaraderie and yeah,

852
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:36,050
there's an intense camaraderie between
people that train together because you

853
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:40,980
go through such difficult sessions and
difficult sparring and difficult moments

854
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:45,390
and conditioning and all that stuff and
you push each other and it's a different

855
00:37:45,391 --> 00:37:46,350
kind of bond.
Right?

856
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,281
Yeah.
And on that,

857
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:51,930
I think I saw someone recently posted
something that was pretty cool where it

858
00:37:51,931 --> 00:37:54,510
showed a,
like a Jujitsu gentleman.

859
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,373
It was,
um,

860
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,160
showing all the different people and in
it it said something like,

861
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,300
this is the,
where's the one place you will,

862
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:03,630
you can find.
It was really just people in these

863
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,030
different skin colors.
And I forget how it was worded,

864
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:09,540
but yeah.
And we all get along and there's all

865
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,374
piece.
It's like,

866
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,120
I love that.
Yeah,

867
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,860
I do as well.
Did you,

868
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,950
do you stay in any way in touch with
those kids from back in the day from the

869
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,350
kids that bullied you?
You.

870
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,460
It was actually funny after the ultimate
fighter,

871
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:26,520
um,
I got invited out by one of the guys.

872
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,240
Um,
and uh,

873
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,330
just because I think a couple of people,
they'll just,

874
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,980
yeah,
saw one of the guys who was one of the

875
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,150
main guys and he's like,
Hey,

876
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,860
I'm walking around downtown Fort Worth
and say,

877
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,100
why don't we go out here?
Whatever.

878
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:42,671
I'm like,
all right,

879
00:38:42,671 --> 00:38:43,504
I'll go.
And.

880
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,100
Well he had actually brought me into,
uh,

881
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,250
the Sushi restaurant in all around the
table was most of the people that were

882
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,350
not most is probably only eight or 10
people,

883
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,190
but they were some of the main kids that
were at that party when I dressed up and

884
00:38:57,191 --> 00:38:57,850
everything.
Why?

885
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,683
Man,
if you,

886
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,800
if we'd have known you were a fighter or
you know,

887
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,980
you could kick their butts and we
wouldn't have done that to you.

888
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:05,130
And I'm just like it.
So I told him I was going to the

889
00:39:05,131 --> 00:39:08,230
bathroom just left from,
I think that's the only time I've ever

890
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:09,850
done anything like that,
but I'm just like,

891
00:39:09,851 --> 00:39:11,500
I can't,
I can't be around these guys.

892
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:16,000
Did you,
did you sense any feeling of remorse

893
00:39:16,001 --> 00:39:17,830
from them or they just want to be
friends?

894
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,570
One,
one or two of them?

895
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:22,210
One guy for sure.
He's,

896
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,680
he's,
he's pretty cool now.

897
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,720
And um,
but then one is a,

898
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:30,300
is a knucklehead for sure and still pick
them.

899
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,900
You know,
it's that classic thing of kids ganging

900
00:39:34,901 --> 00:39:38,050
up on one kid.
That's a weird instinct that sometimes

901
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:40,630
children have.
You remember that movie Carrie,

902
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:41,763
when they,
uh,

903
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,400
she goes to the prom and the,
do you ever seen these basic moving?

904
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,100
It's based on a great Stephen King Book.
He didn't know.

905
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:53,140
I know that cover the,
the Sissy space movie was really trippy.

906
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,100
John Travolta's in it back in the day,
young and handsome.

907
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,590
Um,
but it's,

908
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,480
you know,
that's the themes that they push her.

909
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,140
She has these crazy telekinetic powers
and they push her to this point and they

910
00:40:05,141 --> 00:40:08,710
do it by mocking her and bullying her.
They take her to the prom and they pour

911
00:40:08,711 --> 00:40:11,410
pig's blood on her head,
which winds up killing everybody.

912
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,521
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

913
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:13,660
It's pretty,
pretty crazy.

914
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:18,661
But that's that thing that happens when
kids gang up on a kid that they feel

915
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:20,890
like is vulnerable.
Like,

916
00:40:20,891 --> 00:40:23,890
what the fuck is that man?
What a horrible instinct like.

917
00:40:23,891 --> 00:40:26,860
Is that
what I mean?

918
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,360
I,
I just,

919
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:33,450
I struggle to understand where that
instinct comes from or why people do it.

920
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,560
It's um,
especially little kids know.

921
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,880
I mean,
I guess I could understand that if the

922
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:43,090
kids have been abused themselves,
they want to lash out there angry and

923
00:40:43,091 --> 00:40:45,010
hurt.
But oftentimes it's just,

924
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:49,120
they find someone who's vulnerable.
It's like they find the pecking order

925
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,690
and they'd find that one person that can
get away with and they all funnel their

926
00:40:52,691 --> 00:40:56,290
insecurities and their anger and their
aggression on this one person just

927
00:40:56,291 --> 00:41:00,130
because with no regard whatsoever,
what kind of impact it's gonna have on

928
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:01,110
that kid.
Yeah.

929
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,010
I think.
I think one of the things that makes it

930
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:06,490
so much worse now is.
I mean,

931
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:09,010
I don't know.
I get to hear some of the stuff that

932
00:41:09,011 --> 00:41:13,690
they can't escape it because it follows
them home cyberbullying and they get the

933
00:41:13,691 --> 00:41:16,750
text and the,
all this stuff is so it's constantly.

934
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,260
So I could at least escape it from eight
to three,

935
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,920
eight to three I was at school,
but when I came home I was,

936
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,120
I was okay.
And um,

937
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,210
maybe that gave me a break but a little
bit of a break from it.

938
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,010
But I mean,
that's,

939
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,930
that's the world that we live in and the
stuff that's happening.

940
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:32,950
I mean,
what you said happened.

941
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,070
Germany

942
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,720
and other like school shootings that
have happened here.

943
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:39,080
I was in Aurora when the,
the movie theater thing happened.

944
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,900
Um,
and it's just terrible.

945
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,240
But then I,
there's absolutely,

946
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,230
without a doubt the zero excuse for you
don't ever do anything like that.

947
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:51,890
But then I kind of have looked at it
maybe once before.

948
00:41:51,891 --> 00:41:53,570
It might be stupid for me to talk about
it now.

949
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,590
But um,
I kind of can see where they've been

950
00:41:57,591 --> 00:42:00,590
pushed over the edge and wait,
no excuse,

951
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,540
they should not ever do anything like
that.

952
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,700
But um,
for me it's like,

953
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,320
man,
they,

954
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,950
they,
it was never a fair fight.

955
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:12,460
They were always cornered a outnumbered.
I'm beaten down over and over and over,

956
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,630
and then they just snapped.
And uh,

957
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,330
now it's terrible.
Don't.

958
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:19,460
Yeah.
I don't know if that's the case of the

959
00:42:19,461 --> 00:42:20,560
Aurora shooter.
No,

960
00:42:20,561 --> 00:42:20,960
no,
no.

961
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,190
He's completely insane.

962
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,910
Yeah.
But I think it certainly can happen to

963
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,790
people where they get to this point when
not only do they not want to live,

964
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,670
they don't want you to live anymore
either because I mean,

965
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:34,970
I'm sure if you had been in a situation
where you knew someone,

966
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:37,410
you had a friend who was in the same
boat as you,

967
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,181
you know,
like,

968
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:40,070
um,
those kids from columbine,

969
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,570
whether the two kids got together and
they sort of helped each other do

970
00:42:44,571 --> 00:42:47,930
something really fucked up if you were
involved with the wrong people at that

971
00:42:47,931 --> 00:42:50,600
time.
Someone had a gun and you knew where

972
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:53,660
these kids were and you know,
you wanted to do that to yourself.

973
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,910
Who knows what you would have wanted to
do to them as well.

974
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:56,790
Yeah.
It's a,

975
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:58,520
it's kind of a scary thing to think
about.

976
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:01,040
I did have a dark period.

977
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,260
It was,
I think it was in between seventh and

978
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,730
eighth grade where they're hanging out
with a lot of the,

979
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:06,430
I don't know,
just the,

980
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:11,580
the kids that were involved in just
darker thoughts,

981
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,610
music,
stuff like that where it,

982
00:43:13,611 --> 00:43:14,650
um,
where,

983
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,580
you know,
hanging out with them and we're all,

984
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:18,700
we're all depressed,
you know,

985
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:21,440
and we're,
we're listening to that Papa Roach Song,

986
00:43:21,441 --> 00:43:23,330
the last resort,
you know?

987
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,150
Uh,
I think it's like cut myself bleeding,

988
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:28,910
you know,
I'm never gonna I don't want to breathe

989
00:43:28,911 --> 00:43:30,560
again or live again or something like
that.

990
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:32,520
And then all of a sudden they're
bringing out a,

991
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,740
what are those?
The big,

992
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,140
big black cats are those employees or
something like that.

993
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,620
There's a bunch of frogs where we lived
in the country and they'd go get the

994
00:43:39,621 --> 00:43:43,160
frogs blow up a frog,
given another frog blow up a frog Jesus

995
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:43,790
frog.

996
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:44,410
And also like,
Hey,

997
00:43:44,410 --> 00:43:47,450
this is,
this is a little way too dark.

998
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,593
Sorry.
The,

999
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:50,960
how do you blow up a frog?
You stick it in his mouth,

1000
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,140
stick in his mouth and just light it
written in front.

1001
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,900
Sorry for anyone and the frog wasn't
just keeps it in his mouth or something.

1002
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,280
They're hopping,
hopping,

1003
00:43:58,281 --> 00:44:00,200
hopping with it in his mouth,
his mouth,

1004
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:04,940
because I think maybe with mat they use
those because they're big,

1005
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,580
so you stick it in there and kind of
can't get it out.

1006
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,230
Can't get it.
Oh God,

1007
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,160
yes.
A brutal.

1008
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,240
Anyway,
when that happened,

1009
00:44:11,241 --> 00:44:11,811
I was like,
okay,

1010
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,790
I need to.
I need to change the.

1011
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:16,610
That was a group of like five or six
kids that were just in a very,

1012
00:44:16,611 --> 00:44:21,611
very dark place and even ones in jail.
So fuck dude,

1013
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,330
what a bar bombing me.
I'm just going to do that every time

1014
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:29,720
you've been here.
It's just been all joyful and loving and

1015
00:44:29,721 --> 00:44:31,740
all that.
I didn't know your history

1016
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,031
well.
Hey Man.

1017
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:35,280
It's just honest expression.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1018
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,300
It's just it.
It makes me as an adult,

1019
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:43,320
I almost want to go back in time and
stop it from happening.

1020
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:45,030
You know,
it makes me,

1021
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,610
it makes me very sad.
It's just,

1022
00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:52,080
it's one of the worst aspects of human
beings that they could plan something

1023
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:56,250
like that and do that and just try to
ruin someone's life just for sport,

1024
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,460
just for fun for no reason.
You didn't do anything to them.

1025
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:00,294
It's just,
yeah,

1026
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:01,470
it's fucked up man.

1027
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:06,630
I see it as a thing that actually helped
shape and mold me now in a way of like,

1028
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,060
I look at it,
it was Loretta while we're writing the

1029
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:10,894
book,
she's like,

1030
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,030
do you not see all these kind of
parallels?

1031
00:45:13,031 --> 00:45:14,680
And I'm like,
what do you mean you grew up?

1032
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,090
He got really,
really bullied.

1033
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,600
Then I tried to help people that are
like maybe the most bully people on

1034
00:45:19,601 --> 00:45:21,160
planet earth and like,
Oh,

1035
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,730
I guess I see that.
No,

1036
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,590
and,
or was it last month?

1037
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:26,590
Last trip,
but the second last trip to Congo,

1038
00:45:26,610 --> 00:45:30,280
that ad was there and we're having to
get a mechanic to help.

1039
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:34,540
We were tired and different stuff.
And also I'm a drunk mechanic comes out

1040
00:45:34,541 --> 00:45:38,200
and he's always drunk and uh,
and he comes out talking with us.

1041
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,630
It's a little boy walks by.
He's literally,

1042
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:44,410
he should be in school,
but because his family's so poor,

1043
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,710
he's out selling eggs and if he's
selling eggs you can make,

1044
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,830
you know nothing,
but we'll never be able to go to school

1045
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:51,340
probably.

1046
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,740
And he's just trying to make money to
feed his family.

1047
00:45:53,741 --> 00:45:54,820
And he's literally five,
six,

1048
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:57,520
seven years old and he's coming around
with selling the eggs.

1049
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,110
Normally they sell them hard boiled.
Um,

1050
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:03,310
but sometimes they don't when they're,
when they're walking around you want eat

1051
00:46:03,311 --> 00:46:05,770
it then.
But this kids were all raw and so it's

1052
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:07,600
even harder for them to sell them.
Um,

1053
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:11,290
but the drunk guy picked up the egg.
He's looking at it,

1054
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:14,410
shakes a little bit,
finds out it's raw and just smashes him.

1055
00:46:15,250 --> 00:46:16,900
The Kid,
this is an adult,

1056
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,010
30 something year old man,
and this is literally a five,

1057
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:21,461
six,
seven,

1058
00:46:21,461 --> 00:46:24,310
eight year old kid.
Just smashes it over his head and the

1059
00:46:24,311 --> 00:46:26,780
kid looks up at him with just fear.
I mean,

1060
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,660
it's not smart for me because,
uh,

1061
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:30,280
because,
you know,

1062
00:46:30,281 --> 00:46:33,460
I'm the outsider to the government's
eyes and everything else,

1063
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,440
but like I almost got in a fistfight
with him.

1064
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,560
I remember just pulling my hand straight
back and,

1065
00:46:38,530 --> 00:46:41,170
and just almost just back in them right
across the face.

1066
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:42,480
And then Ben's like,
Whoa,

1067
00:46:42,481 --> 00:46:43,090
Whoa,
whoa.

1068
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:44,860
Then I grabbed the,
I think I grabbed a shirt,

1069
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,500
grab the shoulder and I said,
Ben,

1070
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:50,170
translate from real quick if he ever
leaves his hands on that kid or any

1071
00:46:50,171 --> 00:46:51,970
other kid,
I'm only my hands on him.

1072
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,990
And so just make sure you understand
that this kind of thing.

1073
00:46:54,991 --> 00:46:57,610
And um,
I don't even know a woman that except

1074
00:46:57,611 --> 00:46:59,380
for.
I mean I just don't get,

1075
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,660
get people sometimes.
Um,

1076
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,840
let's,
we'll get into some positive stuff with

1077
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:05,980
that.
That will just blew me away.

1078
00:47:05,981 --> 00:47:08,530
I was like,
you're an old guy picking on a

1079
00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:10,420
kindergartener.
I just,

1080
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,393
as a,

1081
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,690
as a person,
I don't understand it,

1082
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:19,960
but I also don't understand it.
Like logically I don't understand like

1083
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:22,020
where that inclination comes from it,
like what,

1084
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:25,210
what is it about a human being that
makes them want to do that?

1085
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:27,570
Like what,
how,

1086
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:30,160
how did that develop?
How is it so common?

1087
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:32,150
Um,
I don't know.

1088
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,970
I guess when you
put someone down you feel better about

1089
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:38,790
yourself and to really,
I mean,

1090
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,890
I know what I've found is the exact
opposite.

1091
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:43,900
When you help somebody,
it actually helps you.

1092
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,960
Of course somebody you feel more loved
when you,

1093
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,680
you know,
so um,

1094
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:51,820
so it's counterintuitive,
but that's kind of what people do re do

1095
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:54,960
the opposite of what we could or should.
But it's so common.

1096
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,670
I wonder,
like what is the cause,

1097
00:47:57,671 --> 00:48:01,630
the root cause of it or does it play
some sort of evolutionary role?

1098
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,630
Like what is it like,
like pecking order with chickens?

1099
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,540
Like they try to find out who's the
weakest one and they all attack.

1100
00:48:07,541 --> 00:48:10,510
They'll all tackling the weakest chicken
that'll all peck at it.

1101
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,180
It's like,
what the fuck is that?

1102
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:16,360
Like why is it,
are they trying to weed out the weak?

1103
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,190
Is it an evolutionary thing?
Is it,

1104
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:21,670
are they terrified of someone doing that
to them?

1105
00:48:21,671 --> 00:48:23,860
So they strike first?
Well,

1106
00:48:23,861 --> 00:48:26,260
you know what,
there's actually a pretty incredible

1107
00:48:26,261 --> 00:48:27,290
video.
Hang onto.

1108
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:29,410
So yeah,
because of the voice is actually a

1109
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:33,830
pretty incredible video that uh,
it was absolutely terrible whenever I

1110
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:35,230
gave the speech or whatever.
But I,

1111
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:37,800
I played part of the video,
cut it down to like three minutes and

1112
00:48:37,801 --> 00:48:40,170
say like 12,
I think it's called the battle at

1113
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:41,230
Kruger.
Have you seen that?

1114
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,430
No,
it's in Africa.

1115
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:45,170
Oh,
I have seen this.

1116
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:50,080
The water buffaloes are back in.
The crocodile lion takes the,

1117
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,930
the back of the pack.
The smaller,

1118
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,110
weaker,
younger lions all go after that one,

1119
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,850
tackle it splashing water.
They're dragging the baby out of the,

1120
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,830
out of the lake or river and all of a
sudden a huge crocodile comes and grabs

1121
00:49:05,831 --> 00:49:10,480
it and they have a tug of war match with
this baby.

1122
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,060
I think it was a Cape Buffalo Buffalo.
Yeah.

1123
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,613
And so,
uh,

1124
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,330
it wasn't a will to be straight.
It was Keto flu.

1125
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,370
I think it was one of those.
And uh,

1126
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:19,660
and yeah,
it's not split.

1127
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:24,660
What I love almost in that analogy of
where you know if you're standing by

1128
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,970
like you're encouraging it or if you're
not doing anything,

1129
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:29,410
you're encouraging it,
but if you just stand up,

1130
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,200
oh,
that's the stat I saw where 87 percent

1131
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:34,960
of bullying happens in the presence of
nobody,

1132
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,110
but in the times that it is around
people.

1133
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:41,560
If one person says one thing to the
bully,

1134
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:47,200
90 percent of the time it's 80 to 90
percent of the time it stops within five

1135
00:49:47,201 --> 00:49:48,220
seconds.
The bullying,

1136
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,740
it just stops and it doesn't have to be
anything aggressive.

1137
00:49:50,741 --> 00:49:53,270
It can be a man lay off of them and then
if you.

1138
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,800
After that,
it's something like 95 percent of the

1139
00:49:56,801 --> 00:49:59,080
time.
If you invite the bullied victim to come

1140
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:01,840
into your group or hang out or sit at
your table or whatever,

1141
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,110
then it stops even even better right
away.

1142
00:50:05,111 --> 00:50:07,810
When you don't address the bully.
You addressed the person that's getting

1143
00:50:07,811 --> 00:50:09,820
bullied.
So it seems like the people that are

1144
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:12,450
bullying,
they almost need reinforcement and they

1145
00:50:12,451 --> 00:50:14,170
get.
They're getting reinforced by people

1146
00:50:14,171 --> 00:50:17,620
being complicit or being silent or
they're joining like those lines.

1147
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,850
One line decided to take out the little
guys.

1148
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,370
They just food.
You were handled.

1149
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,690
That's how they stay alive.
That's a natural instinct.

1150
00:50:25,691 --> 00:50:28,210
This is a weird either.
This,

1151
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,270
the one thing I do like about it though
is with those two stats,

1152
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,310
like say something,
don't be passive.

1153
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,060
Whenever one Cape Buffalo turned around,
a couple of other ones did too.

1154
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:38,770
And then we'll.

1155
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,960
One came in there in the middle of the
law.

1156
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,690
One hit one line through it in the air
and then all of them tucked tail and

1157
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:45,620
ran.
Yeah.

1158
00:50:45,621 --> 00:50:48,020
Once I realized what a Cape Buffalo can
actually do to them,

1159
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,620
man,
that's so terrible.

1160
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:51,441
You know,
Cape Buffalo,

1161
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:56,441
I was apparently are some of the most
dangerous animals in Africa and they

1162
00:50:56,751 --> 00:51:00,290
will charge.
You can just so used to being around

1163
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,430
people,
um,

1164
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,070
or around animals rather than trying to
kill them.

1165
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,430
Yeah.
I almost got us arrested and not a,

1166
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,640
not just a little bit where we
accidentally,

1167
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:13,700
um,
believe the Serengeti in Tanzania and

1168
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:16,700
we're on the border of Kenya and
Tanzania and we're taking a shortcut

1169
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:19,820
from some locals,
which is always fine if you're from

1170
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:22,460
there.
And we saw this awesome,

1171
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:24,080
but we didn't know we were going through
the Serengeti.

1172
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,690
They just thought it was a shortcut.
We didn't pay for a park,

1173
00:51:26,691 --> 00:51:28,460
pass her,
anything like that.

1174
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,840
And also I see this gigantic Cape
Buffalo skull just sitting in the middle

1175
00:51:32,841 --> 00:51:33,830
of nowhere.
I'm like,

1176
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:35,570
let's get that,
let's take it back.

1177
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:37,460
And so we put that in the back of the
truck.

1178
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,150
All of a sudden we're driving and uh,
we get pulled over by the park rangers.

1179
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:44,430
Then they see the Cape Buffalo skull.
They say we're poachers say this,

1180
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,400
that,
and the just swarmed by,

1181
00:51:46,401 --> 00:51:47,600
uh,
by all these,

1182
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,880
these park rangers,
like three or four different vehicles

1183
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,720
and arrest me,
all this different stuff and enter crew.

1184
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,400
And uh,
luckily anyways,

1185
00:51:55,401 --> 00:51:57,200
that's a random thing.
But luckily we just said,

1186
00:51:57,201 --> 00:51:58,730
hey,
can I just put it right back where it

1187
00:51:58,731 --> 00:51:59,630
was?
I didn't,

1188
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,180
I didn't mean to.
I didn't know we were in a national

1189
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:04,040
park.
Yeah.

1190
00:52:04,041 --> 00:52:06,740
They don't take any bullshit from
poachers out there.

1191
00:52:06,741 --> 00:52:09,980
It's very dangerous.
They kill poachers on site.

1192
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:12,740
Yeah.
They can kill them.

1193
00:52:12,741 --> 00:52:14,180
Where it's,
a lot of times it's,

1194
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:18,500
I'm literally the life in prison
sentence for poaching.

1195
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:19,100
Yeah.
For,

1196
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,200
for,
for um,

1197
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:23,900
like endangered species for sure,
with like,

1198
00:52:23,901 --> 00:52:25,490
uh,
the Okapi,

1199
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,680
um,
one of my last trips and we'll try to,

1200
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,610
I think I maybe said that earlier,
where a on one of the past episodes

1201
00:52:31,611 --> 00:52:36,611
where someone tried to sell me the meat
in the fur of an Okapi and then,

1202
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,380
um,
oh,

1203
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:39,830
cubbies are in danger.
Yes.

1204
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,010
And they're only found in the one area
that we're,

1205
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:48,130
we're kind of working in and uh,
and the rebel groups there went to will

1206
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:52,540
wildlife reserve for them protecting
them and uh,

1207
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,560
they wouldn't hurt her,
like,

1208
00:52:54,561 --> 00:52:55,670
uh,
I don't know,

1209
00:52:55,671 --> 00:52:59,360
15 or 20 of them sleep that were there
trying to help stimulate,

1210
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,700
you know,
come help them come back in the wild and

1211
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:03,320
everything else.
There's wouldn't killed them all.

1212
00:53:04,090 --> 00:53:05,180
Um,
yeah.

1213
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,960
And then another guy was trying to sell
me a,

1214
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,900
a,
a rhino horn.

1215
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,140
Um,
and that's just brutal.

1216
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,320
Now poaching sucks,
but I love how the pygmies culture has

1217
00:53:17,691 --> 00:53:18,500
with,
with hunting.

1218
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:20,600
I even have a,
a quick video.

1219
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:21,550
Um,
if I,

1220
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:22,490
I think,
um,

1221
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:26,230
did you see what they're doing where
they're making three d printed a

1222
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,760
cloned rhino horns and they're going to
flood the market with them?

1223
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,460
That's a great idea.
Yeah.

1224
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,070
To see if he could find that out with
Jim Shark fins too,

1225
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:36,090
right?
Yeah,

1226
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,810
yeah.
They're um,

1227
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,340
Amelie's people.
Each arc fens needs.

1228
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:44,580
It's fucked up that they're killing them
all and make soup out of them,

1229
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,140
but she's,
at least they're eating them.

1230
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,170
These are the Rhino thing is insane.
Yeah,

1231
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,050
that's it.
It's absolutely based on nothing.

1232
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,950
I mean the I medicine,
but it's crazy.

1233
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:01,970
I just can't imagine that.
Here we are in 2016 with Viagra and

1234
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:06,570
Cialis and all these different boner
pills you buy at the gas station.

1235
00:54:06,571 --> 00:54:08,510
That red bad takes.
When I was pulling this up,

1236
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:12,230
I've found this bias and also three d
printing and vinyl,

1237
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:16,370
not the solution to poaching crisis
experts say,

1238
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,290
I agree that that's the best way.
Well,

1239
00:54:19,291 --> 00:54:20,760
I don't know if it's the best way
either.

1240
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:24,570
I mean,
I just can't imagine that the rhinos are

1241
00:54:24,571 --> 00:54:27,450
literally on the verge of going extinct
because people want to kill them and

1242
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:30,610
take their horns,
which do nothing and it's.

1243
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:33,600
Isn't it like the same substances like a
fingernail or toenail?

1244
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,190
It is.
Exactly.

1245
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,900
That's exactly what it is.
It's like hair.

1246
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,250
Yeah,
it's.

1247
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:42,810
But they have this erroneous idea that
you eat it and it makes your dick hard.

1248
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:51,350
What the fuck is going on with Asia?
That's a broad statement and that's why

1249
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,110
I bought it.
I generalize,

1250
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,420
generalize that a billion people folks
going on with Asian move.

1251
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,850
I mean I wonder.
I think it's also a status symbol.

1252
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:04,851
I was reading that even though it might
not necessarily be real or really work,

1253
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:11,510
but it's such an ancient cultural status
symbol thing that like these businessmen

1254
00:55:12,361 --> 00:55:14,830
will get together and they'll have like
Rhino Horn tea,

1255
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,513
you know,
and they.

1256
00:55:16,770 --> 00:55:21,270
But they think it's cool because it's
illegal and you can't get it and it's

1257
00:55:21,271 --> 00:55:24,900
dangerous and it's got to come from
Africa and so it must really work.

1258
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:29,400
I don't know,
maybe that's what they think though.

1259
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:33,550
If favorite things work this expensive,
maybe it doesn't matter their their

1260
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,440
grandfathers said it worked.
His grandfather said it work.

1261
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,480
Why don't you google that,
Jamie?

1262
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:39,060
Does Rhino Horn actually work?
No,

1263
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:42,210
I didn't know.
I mean maybe it doesn't work as good as

1264
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:44,370
other stuff for fingernails.
Does that ever does.

1265
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:46,530
You just got to need eat enough
fingernails.

1266
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,580
Imagine
what's an acceptable source to find?

1267
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:57,720
I don't think there wouldn't be one from
China.

1268
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,720
Isn't that funny?
Like you have to find a website that you

1269
00:56:00,721 --> 00:56:01,650
trust,
right?

1270
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:06,940
It's got to be like wired.com or story
on factor fiction use on it,

1271
00:56:07,111 --> 00:56:08,790
but what does it.
What does that say?

1272
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,420
PBS is probably valid.
A lot of information.

1273
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:15,870
I'd have to read first,
but just one article about Rhino Horn

1274
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,940
use fact or fiction.
I always,

1275
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,310
when I'm exhausted and I look at
something like that,

1276
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:23,100
I go to the very bottom and say,
hmm,

1277
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:27,150
how do they wrap this up?
Overall not much evidence to support the

1278
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,530
claim to what?
The healing properties of the horns.

1279
00:56:29,531 --> 00:56:31,480
There you go.
That's a good little tip I just learned

1280
00:56:31,481 --> 00:56:32,740
from.
If you're not really.

1281
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,370
This isn't life dependent.
This is not something that you really.

1282
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:41,080
It's not really a factor in your life.
Just go to the bottom line.

1283
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:43,530
It is very strange.
Oh,

1284
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,570
okay.
Not believed as once believed.

1285
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,660
It's not as once believed,
rather made simply from a clump of

1286
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:53,560
compressed or modified here,
recent studies by researchers and Ohio

1287
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:54,580
University,
whole Ohio.

1288
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:56,680
There you go.
Using computerize.

1289
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:01,900
What does that Word Tomography?
Ct Scans have shown that the horns are

1290
00:57:01,901 --> 00:57:04,510
in fact similar in structure to horses,
hooves,

1291
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:09,540
turtle beaks and cockatoo bills.
The studies also revealed at the centers

1292
00:57:09,541 --> 00:57:14,541
of the horns have dense mineral deposits
of calcium and Melanin of finding that

1293
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:19,480
may explain the curve and shape sharp
tip of the horn.

1294
00:57:19,481 --> 00:57:22,930
The calcium would strengthen the horn
while the melanin would protect some of

1295
00:57:22,931 --> 00:57:26,680
the core from being degradated by
ultraviolet radiation from the Sun,

1296
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:31,660
Huh?
Softer outer portion worn away over time

1297
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:36,070
by the sun and typical rhino activities
bashing horns with other animals rubbing

1298
00:57:36,071 --> 00:57:38,800
on the ground.
The inner core would be sharpened into a

1299
00:57:38,801 --> 00:57:40,630
point,
much like a wooden pencil.

1300
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,410
Yeah.
There were in the horn that this kid was

1301
00:57:45,411 --> 00:57:47,180
basically trying to sell it.
He was like 15,

1302
00:57:47,181 --> 00:57:49,540
16 years old.
His Dad was the poacher and uh,

1303
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:51,740
his dad didn't want to get arrested so
he sends his kid,

1304
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,130
um,
and uh,

1305
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:58,210
it had all sorts of like us deep deeply
scratches inside of it and stuff and are

1306
00:57:58,281 --> 00:58:01,160
just all over Canada.
The top was nicked up and stuff.

1307
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:05,270
University of Hong Kong found that large
doses of Rhino Horn extract could

1308
00:58:05,271 --> 00:58:10,271
slightly lower fever in rats.
Imagine if Rhino Horn was a cure to

1309
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:14,650
malaria when we would start breeding
them right for like we do with chickens.

1310
00:58:14,651 --> 00:58:19,651
And how strange it just.
I mean,

1311
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:23,090
obviously it's not happening in the
western world.

1312
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:27,290
It's not happening here,
but it could I guess.

1313
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:30,770
Right?
I mean some people are just fucked up.

1314
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,020
Some people,
they don't care if something's about to

1315
00:58:33,021 --> 00:58:34,580
go extinct.
They just want,

1316
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:38,480
they want what they want and if they
want that Rhino Horn for whatever

1317
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,830
strange reason,
it's just.

1318
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:41,641
Yeah,
well it's like,

1319
00:58:41,641 --> 00:58:44,350
it's like a,
it's like kind of with the trees,

1320
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:47,670
you know,
we were getting ready to replant.

1321
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:51,260
Um,
I think it's 1000 more trees which would

1322
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:56,270
take her total up the $4,500 on the land
for the pygmies and around there,

1323
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:59,100
the reason that,
I mean China and all these other places

1324
00:58:59,101 --> 00:59:01,050
are coming in,
they're cutting down the rear hardwoods,

1325
00:59:01,051 --> 00:59:04,070
the Mahogany and,
and reason king leopold went,

1326
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,450
there was the rubber boom and the trees
there and everything else.

1327
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:07,750
But then,
um,

1328
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,470
it's just nuts to me because I think
they're,

1329
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:12,480
you know,
they want it for greed,

1330
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:13,560
money,
everything else.

1331
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:17,270
But then the people in the country,
they're starting to,

1332
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:18,390
to,
to learning,

1333
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,040
get educated in the fact that like,
Hey,

1334
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,520
if we're cutting down all these trees,
we better start replanting some because

1335
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:25,160
it takes so long for them to grow back.

1336
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:26,383
And so,
uh,

1337
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,310
no,
but it's just for charcoal or fire and

1338
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:30,470
they're like,
once that's gone,

1339
00:59:30,471 --> 00:59:32,250
what do you have?
And yeah,

1340
00:59:32,510 --> 00:59:37,080
Booney actually the town that all of our
well drillers live in.

1341
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:38,720
And at the university they,
um,

1342
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,230
they used to be in a rainforest,
now you have to drive three,

1343
00:59:42,231 --> 00:59:47,210
four hours to get to the closest florist
you have to drive three or four hours

1344
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:49,640
away.
And it used to be in the center of the

1345
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,300
center of the reinforced,
but the edge of the reinforced almost to

1346
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:55,070
be a forest.
And that's not three or four hours

1347
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:55,970
drive.
Yeah,

1348
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,840
it's all just because of deforestation
all chopping down for logging.

1349
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,600
Fuck man,
I was in Canada.

1350
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:03,480
And um,
they,

1351
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:06,050
they do a pretty good job of regulating
it and BC.

1352
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,320
But it's still disturbing because you,
you come across these,

1353
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:13,100
these big gigantic fields where the
trees are just gone.

1354
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,600
All the trees had been cut and you know,
they plant som and they have the,

1355
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:23,240
they also have like purchase,
they leave purchase for animals,

1356
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:24,620
which is,
uh,

1357
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:29,300
probably like an awesome spot for like a
hawk or an eagle or something like that

1358
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,900
because everything's cut down.
They can see every street to the press.

1359
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,130
But it's,
um,

1360
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:36,800
these cut out of,
I forget what they call it,

1361
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:39,230
these patches where everything's cut
down.

1362
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:42,110
It's so disturbing.
It's like I get,

1363
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,780
I get that they replant,
I get that they have a cycle.

1364
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:47,690
I get that,
but it just bugs me that people could do

1365
01:00:47,691 --> 01:00:48,524
that.
They just.

1366
01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,710
Giant swaths of the landscapes shaved
off and turned into toothpicks or

1367
01:00:53,961 --> 01:00:55,940
whatever the fuck they do with it.
Yeah.

1368
01:00:55,970 --> 01:01:00,970
And so I was in a village before my
wife's first time to Congo and it was,

1369
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:05,030
I mean it was almost like,
you know,

1370
01:01:05,090 --> 01:01:08,540
lush,
untouched virgin forest and then all of

1371
01:01:08,541 --> 01:01:12,110
a sudden a come back next time with her
coming in with worse,

1372
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:12,920
come back in.

1373
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:16,370
It's probably a month or so because we
went to a couple of other villages,

1374
01:01:16,450 --> 01:01:18,810
go back,
start going to the same hike and all of

1375
01:01:18,811 --> 01:01:22,100
a sudden there's this huge clearing at
least 10 acres,

1376
01:01:22,101 --> 01:01:26,420
probably 20,
25 and it was just nothing there except

1377
01:01:26,421 --> 01:01:30,500
for a few remaining huge cut down trees
that I could stand in front of and the,

1378
01:01:30,940 --> 01:01:33,240
the,
of the base or whatever it was way

1379
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:37,040
telling them I was a little midget next
to that or fuck man.

1380
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,570
So yeah,
it's pretty crazy.

1381
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,610
And I was telling her,
I'm like,

1382
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:41,570
baby,
like when I was like,

1383
01:01:41,571 --> 01:01:44,180
take some picture of this,
I think I have some pictures right here

1384
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,580
of where,
where we are right now on this trail.

1385
01:01:46,581 --> 01:01:50,750
And like there used to be trees here and
it was nuts because all of a sudden for

1386
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:52,940
me,
if I'm in the rain forest is great

1387
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:54,860
actually.
I mean it's hot in a malaria,

1388
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:56,930
but uh,
but uh,

1389
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,020
she,
her but being under the canopy of the

1390
01:02:00,021 --> 01:02:02,120
rain forest,
going to love that because it's shaded

1391
01:02:02,121 --> 01:02:04,100
and everything else still hot,
still humid,

1392
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,590
but a little bit better.
Not getting burned on,

1393
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:08,511
especially.
Yeah,

1394
01:02:08,511 --> 01:02:10,930
you're really pale in on the hike.
I was getting burned and I'm like,

1395
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,773
man,
this is a nuts.

1396
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,900
Especially on that malaria medication.
Right.

1397
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,210
Right.
Um,

1398
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,420
that they were talking on this,
uh,

1399
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,980
documentary I was watching about the
deforestation

1400
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,980
of the Amazon,
about how fast it's happening and how

1401
01:02:22,981 --> 01:02:26,670
terrifying it is.
And a big part of it I guess is not

1402
01:02:26,671 --> 01:02:27,990
even.
Well there's logging,

1403
01:02:27,991 --> 01:02:31,170
but there's also they cut it down to
make room for cattle grazing.

1404
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:36,950
And when they were showing the,
just the sheer size of the deforestation

1405
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:43,011
of how much they've done in so quickly.
And then I'm also the people that live

1406
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:48,110
in these areas where if they resist the
loggers or they're resist it,

1407
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,020
skip murdered,
especially the indigenous people that

1408
01:02:52,021 --> 01:02:56,090
are more out there and it happens with
the pygmies because they are the weaker

1409
01:02:56,091 --> 01:02:59,310
and more vulnerable things that can push
around and they can't push back.

1410
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:03,290
And so when you consider your life and
you consider this horrible,

1411
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:04,980
uh,
these stories that you're telling us

1412
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:07,440
about your upbringing,
how disturbing it is,

1413
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:12,210
does it feel to you,
since you've found this like sense of

1414
01:03:12,211 --> 01:03:13,620
purpose in this,
um,

1415
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,630
this real connection with these people
in the Congo that almost like these

1416
01:03:18,631 --> 01:03:22,650
horrible events in your life or setting
you up to be the perfect person to find

1417
01:03:22,651 --> 01:03:23,484
these folks?

1418
01:03:24,030 --> 01:03:25,110
Without a doubt.
For me,

1419
01:03:25,111 --> 01:03:26,010
honestly,
it's,

1420
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:29,700
it's almost like a,
it's the right word.

1421
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:34,110
Maybe maybe sort of my chance at kind of
redemption or,

1422
01:03:34,170 --> 01:03:37,170
or just not,
not being the kid that I grew up being.

1423
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,350
Not that was a bad kid or anything,
but just I hated myself and like,

1424
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:44,100
you know what I get to,
he just stopped hating myself.

1425
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,920
I need to stop and I get to start loving
others.

1426
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:48,180
Well,
not just that,

1427
01:03:48,181 --> 01:03:50,400
you also have this massive impact on
other people.

1428
01:03:50,401 --> 01:03:53,010
You have all these people that love you.
You have this amazing wife.

1429
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:56,790
Now you have this amazing pygmy family.
You have your regular family.

1430
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:57,820
To me,
he's like,

1431
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:01,500
you have so much positive going on now.
It's really kind of incredible.

1432
01:04:01,501 --> 01:04:06,501
It's almost like you are the horrible
experiences you had as a young kid have

1433
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:11,700
sort of made you into this incredible
adult.

1434
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,400
Oh,
I think

1435
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,440
I don't know about that because
I don't even know how this.

1436
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,630
Honestly,
there's,

1437
01:04:27,100 --> 01:04:32,100
there's not a good explanation that I
could probably explain that like it

1438
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:37,140
should be working or that it's working
like it is because it will with me at

1439
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:40,690
the front of it because I don't have any
community development training or would

1440
01:04:40,691 --> 01:04:41,760
you agree?
Um,

1441
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:44,190
I actually don't speak the language I'm
learning,

1442
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:48,720
but how much can you speak when he kind
of wrote a mentoree?

1443
01:04:48,810 --> 01:04:51,410
I don't even like Como te Amo.
Joe?

1444
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,280
Yeah.
I couldn't say my name is this,

1445
01:04:53,281 --> 01:04:55,440
where's the bathroom?
Are you doing okay?

1446
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:58,320
You're sure you,
you're like,

1447
01:04:58,321 --> 01:04:59,310
oh,
you lost me.

1448
01:04:59,410 --> 01:05:03,110
It's tough if it,
the saying is it's proof.

1449
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,650
What does it sound like?
What do they sound like?

1450
01:05:04,660 --> 01:05:09,660
We're talking a Jimmy Pilsen pick me up
that's called this kind of like our

1451
01:05:13,711 --> 01:05:15,200
walkie talkies.
Oh yeah,

1452
01:05:15,201 --> 01:05:17,320
I yelled that out and let people know
where you are.

1453
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,980
What.
So what are

1454
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,930
you saying when you're saying that?
That is actually,

1455
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,310
that's not a word.
It's just like,

1456
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,070
yeah,
that's actually I'm over here.

1457
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:27,670
It's Kinda thing like that or we're just
checking where even just excitement,

1458
01:05:27,671 --> 01:05:30,040
just fun.
I mean whenever we go on hikes,

1459
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:31,180
those hikes or long,
right?

1460
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:34,810
And there's no tv or you can text her
scroll,

1461
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:36,410
Scroll the Internet.
Um,

1462
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,660
you,
yeah,

1463
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,130
have each other,
which is always great.

1464
01:05:39,131 --> 01:05:40,510
But then he'd goof off.
I mean,

1465
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,570
I actually know what,
uh,

1466
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:46,330
I,
I bet in one of those videos it has them

1467
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:49,900
speaking and it's pretty awesome.
I remember that when you're saying,

1468
01:05:49,901 --> 01:05:52,930
when you're saying the hikes,
like you talking like recreational

1469
01:05:52,931 --> 01:05:53,764
hikes.
No,

1470
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:54,760
no,
no.

1471
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:57,880
You just got to get you here and talk
with someone talking about hikes in La.

1472
01:05:57,881 --> 01:05:58,251
It's like,
oh,

1473
01:05:58,251 --> 01:05:59,880
I want to take my little dog to run you
in.

1474
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,053
We're going to go hiking.

1475
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,330
Like he say hiking,
and that's what people think of some

1476
01:06:04,331 --> 01:06:07,260
recreational activity with none of those
little,

1477
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:12,360
a little camel things,
the little camelback water reservoirs

1478
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,940
you put on your back when you suck on
the straws are walking.

1479
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:17,800
It was funny.
I and staying hydrated,

1480
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,070
I took,
I took a couple of those to Congo the

1481
01:06:21,071 --> 01:06:24,670
first couple of times and I realized
just how impractical they are and in a

1482
01:06:24,671 --> 01:06:27,130
real longterm,
not at,

1483
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,710
not a day hike or three day weekend or
something.

1484
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,800
A lot of guys don't like those.
A lot of guys don't like them.

1485
01:06:32,801 --> 01:06:35,650
They'd rather have a.
How do you say that word now?

1486
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,550
Jean Valjean.
Jean Valjean.

1487
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,120
How do you say it?
I think it's like,

1488
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,920
what is that?
It's just like a certain type of

1489
01:06:41,921 --> 01:06:43,570
plastic.
I think it's really hard.

1490
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,690
Durable plastic that.
Yeah,

1491
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:48,130
that people use for water jugs.
But uh,

1492
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:53,050
that's what I would rather because the
other ones too already clean and yeah,

1493
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,630
sort to fill up just all sorts of stuff.

1494
01:06:55,870 --> 01:06:57,790
But some people like it because they
don't,

1495
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,400
they don't have to stop.
They can just keep walking and just suck

1496
01:07:00,401 --> 01:07:03,700
on that thing as they're walking.
I've never used one though.

1497
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,890
Yeah,
I used it for the first two times I

1498
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:07,150
went,
which was like a,

1499
01:07:07,420 --> 01:07:10,390
about a month each.
And you switched to water bottles?

1500
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,720
Yeah.
And then even the,

1501
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:16,090
they have those camelback kind of like,
I think they're called like a platypus

1502
01:07:16,091 --> 01:07:20,230
or something that's um,
it's a gravity filter for water where

1503
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,850
you have a dirty water bagging.
If a clean the dirty hang,

1504
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,880
hang the dirty and it goes down through
a filter and into the clean bag.

1505
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,260
I've seen that.
That's interesting.

1506
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,243
Yeah.
Posed.

1507
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,200
See if you could find that.
Does that work?

1508
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:36,520
Those are the,
I think they work great here in the

1509
01:07:36,521 --> 01:07:39,240
states where you're not dealing with
much.

1510
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:42,580
Right.
But whenever the water is dirty,

1511
01:07:42,581 --> 01:07:46,300
like really dirty it,
they break pretty quick so you have to

1512
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,560
backwash from and other.

1513
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,600
There's,
there's some that are that are good,

1514
01:07:49,601 --> 01:07:51,310
but even the maintenance of them just
really,

1515
01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:55,600
really tough.
So they work for like one filtration but

1516
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:59,800
they won't work the first time I went
for about a month,

1517
01:07:59,890 --> 01:08:04,890
I had it for a week or two and then all
of a sudden it was heartbreaking because

1518
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:07,780
I was even filtering the water,
you know,

1519
01:08:07,990 --> 01:08:10,600
in the town that's coming from wells
because I don't know if they,

1520
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,970
if they did it properly right when they
call and,

1521
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,280
and I had been sick enough.
I'm like,

1522
01:08:16,430 --> 01:08:17,510
yeah,
I hear Ya.

1523
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:20,510
So I'm filtering that stuff.
And then by the time I get out to the

1524
01:08:20,511 --> 01:08:23,990
forest I was able to use a few days and
then it was out in the sun was stuck

1525
01:08:23,991 --> 01:08:26,680
with just chlorine tablets the rest of
the time.

1526
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:29,070
And you can boil it,
but it's,

1527
01:08:29,190 --> 01:08:32,240
it's just impractical.
Where every single time you want to

1528
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:33,770
drink,
you take,

1529
01:08:33,771 --> 01:08:34,890
uh,
you know,

1530
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:37,610
take a container down to dirty water,
which could be 30,

1531
01:08:37,611 --> 01:08:38,630
45 minutes away.

1532
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:41,360
I'm bringing it back,
boil it,

1533
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,590
right,
bring it back,

1534
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:44,630
boil it a filter.
Yeah.

1535
01:08:44,631 --> 01:08:45,560
And then all of a sudden,
all the,

1536
01:08:46,110 --> 01:08:49,780
the ashes getting in it.
And then it's the hot humid rainforest

1537
01:08:49,850 --> 01:08:53,840
on the equator.
And boiling water doesn't cool down

1538
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,510
basically ever there.
So,

1539
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:57,620
uh,
it's,

1540
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:59,570
it's,
it's impractical to do it that way.

1541
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:01,520
Fuck.
But what I love now is,

1542
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:02,320
Oh,
you know,

1543
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,850
it's guy.
Let's do it.

1544
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:07,010
So this is this girl,
first of all,

1545
01:09:07,011 --> 01:09:09,260
she's way too hot to be in this video is
very distracting.

1546
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:10,310
But,
uh,

1547
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:14,120
they're gonna take this in what looks
like a very clean stream.

1548
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,490
So this is so much different than when
you.

1549
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,280
But people should also be aware that
clean streams,

1550
01:09:19,281 --> 01:09:22,830
although they may look clean,
you can still get Giardia from them yet

1551
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:24,770
that,
that's exactly what I learned from,

1552
01:09:24,771 --> 01:09:26,460
uh,
his name is buddy of mine.

1553
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:27,303
We,
Matt,

1554
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:31,250
he was the director of implementation.
Now he's like the chief operating

1555
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:33,200
officer and he,
uh,

1556
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:37,790
he came out there and one of the things
he really drilled into us for a well

1557
01:09:37,791 --> 01:09:39,350
drilling team.
We're learning from a great guy.

1558
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,610
He's saying,
Hey,

1559
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:41,443
you can,
uh,

1560
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,260
you can drill 100 wells or 200 wells,
but if you didn't do it right and proper

1561
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,470
that I would have rather done one the
right way or none,

1562
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:54,950
none.
If you do it the right or the wrong way

1563
01:09:54,951 --> 01:09:56,270
100 times,
200 times,

1564
01:09:56,790 --> 01:09:59,120
um,
and you are giving a village.

1565
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:01,820
Like he's,
he just hit home hard because he's like,

1566
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:03,740
look,
we're learning every single step.

1567
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,140
You can't skip one week.
Got a drill us anywhere,

1568
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:07,490
you know it,
you know,

1569
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:11,480
because we can't skip a step or miss
something and then all of a sudden they

1570
01:10:11,481 --> 01:10:13,340
are looking at it,
drinking it.

1571
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:15,130
It tastes good.
It's a,

1572
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,100
it's clean,
it's cool,

1573
01:10:16,101 --> 01:10:17,600
it's crisp,
it's in a well,

1574
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,140
but yet it can still still be
contaminated,

1575
01:10:21,141 --> 01:10:22,700
dirty.
And so get real sick if you don't

1576
01:10:22,701 --> 01:10:26,660
properly construct well no matter what.
Well it is the wells here anywhere.

1577
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,910
What is the,
what are the factors like when you say

1578
01:10:28,930 --> 01:10:31,640
product properly construct,
like what are the issues that you have

1579
01:10:31,641 --> 01:10:32,930
to avoid?
Yes,

1580
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:36,790
we man,
our teams getting great.

1581
01:10:36,791 --> 01:10:37,670
But by the way,
real quick,

1582
01:10:37,671 --> 01:10:40,880
last time I was on the show,
I think we had completed 20 water wells.

1583
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,690
I went back and looked at that 20 water
wells today.

1584
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:48,870
I got a picture sent to me and it's our
45th water.

1585
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,410
Whoa,
that's incredible dude.

1586
01:10:51,411 --> 01:10:53,310
I love it.
Absolutely love it.

1587
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:55,790
And so what's so great is seeing that,
you know,

1588
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:56,900
they're,
they're,

1589
01:10:57,650 --> 01:11:00,460
they're taking this on as,
as their own thing,

1590
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:01,670
flying on their own two wings.

1591
01:11:01,670 --> 01:11:05,240
They,
they were empowered in a way that's

1592
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:05,810
like,
hey,

1593
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:07,430
you can,
you can do this,

1594
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:09,760
you can do it for yourself,
for your countrymen.

1595
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,440
Um,
you guys are going to be more passionate

1596
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,290
about ending the suffering because you
know the suffering because you have

1597
01:11:16,291 --> 01:11:17,760
suffered,
you've lost family members,

1598
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:20,880
you have sick kids all at different
stuff.

1599
01:11:20,881 --> 01:11:25,881
And so they're going to be able to be a
better champion for this cause then I

1600
01:11:26,221 --> 01:11:28,890
could be,
because I mean maybe we have different

1601
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:31,690
resources where I get to,
you know,

1602
01:11:31,691 --> 01:11:34,620
you share your platform with me,
which has been incredible.

1603
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,920
Um,
and the kickstarter and the documentary

1604
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:40,680
coming out,
all the different stuff is really great.

1605
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,633
But,
um,

1606
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:43,140
but I know that the team,
they're like,

1607
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:43,983
I,
I,

1608
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:46,080
I couldn't do anything without them
doing it.

1609
01:11:46,081 --> 01:11:49,320
And how great they've gotten button.
Well that's a beautiful thing that

1610
01:11:49,321 --> 01:11:51,420
you've helped them help themselves.

1611
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:53,790
Taught them how to help themselves.
Yeah.

1612
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:56,070
Well that right there.
Look at that picture.

1613
01:11:56,490 --> 01:11:57,450
There we go.
Yeah.

1614
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,790
I love it.
That's that to me,

1615
01:11:59,820 --> 01:12:04,820
if I could explain it as better than um,
I've been to the world.

1616
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,120
I was just at UFC 200,
uh,

1617
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:10,370
was that uh,
uh,

1618
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:12,900
the world series,
NBA finals,

1619
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:16,200
superbowl packy all fights.
I mean,

1620
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,170
I've been to all these things and I mean
those crowds,

1621
01:12:19,171 --> 01:12:20,820
those huge crowds are 30,
40,

1622
01:12:20,850 --> 01:12:25,850
50 100,000 different stuff and that
little crowd of 100 hundred 20 like to

1623
01:12:26,191 --> 01:12:29,460
me it drowns out the sound of a entire
stadium.

1624
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:33,120
Like it's a different kind of,
it's a different kind of gratitude,

1625
01:12:33,121 --> 01:12:37,980
thankfulness when you suffered your
whole life and then you,

1626
01:12:38,490 --> 01:12:42,420
you get to partner with people in a non.
Not even talking about me like our team,

1627
01:12:42,870 --> 01:12:43,800
our well drillers,
you know,

1628
01:12:43,801 --> 01:12:46,350
they see them coming in,
staying with them,

1629
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,690
living like they're living,
eating like they're eating,

1630
01:12:49,020 --> 01:12:51,690
sitting around the campfire,
like they sit around which nobody else

1631
01:12:51,691 --> 01:12:52,524
does that with them.

1632
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:55,220
And so sleeping in the Hudson,
these sleep and um,

1633
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:58,440
which nobody else would do a in that
area.

1634
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,070
Um,
and then like you just develop this bond

1635
01:13:02,071 --> 01:13:05,430
and really quickly and where all of a
sudden they're jumping in and helping

1636
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:08,040
with the construction of the well and
everything else.

1637
01:13:08,041 --> 01:13:10,650
Now they do the simple daily routine
stuff.

1638
01:13:10,651 --> 01:13:13,180
Not the technical stuff,
but then yeah,

1639
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:15,390
our guys are there.
They're getting to down,

1640
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:17,190
which was pretty cool.
That's amazing though.

1641
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:20,530
Now you're at 45 wells.
Yeah.

1642
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,280
And what is.
Do you have an ultimate goal or would

1643
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:28,281
you just like to continue?
I think the my ultimate goal lines up

1644
01:13:28,501 --> 01:13:33,270
with water for his ultimate goal,
which I love and then with our drillers

1645
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:36,690
in Congo,
like our goal is to end the water crisis

1646
01:13:36,691 --> 01:13:40,500
of possible.
We think it is possible and we have the

1647
01:13:40,501 --> 01:13:42,150
technology.
We should be able to do it in our

1648
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:42,984
lifetime.

1649
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:48,410
Like before you were me past this earth.
Like we should have the technology to

1650
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:51,240
get everyone clean water.
Isn't it crazy shit that is,

1651
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:53,940
that's our issue.
When when over here in America we have

1652
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:57,850
so many trivial things that we're
constantly worrying about and fretting

1653
01:13:57,870 --> 01:14:02,400
when when they get down to basic human
necessities like water,

1654
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:06,030
the ability to get clean water,
which is without that,

1655
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:08,670
all the,
all the other things that we argue or

1656
01:14:08,671 --> 01:14:09,990
bicker about,
they're all.

1657
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,580
It's all nonsense.
Absolutely.

1658
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:15,070
That's something that,
oh man,

1659
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,170
that's something that I,
I almost like,

1660
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,960
okay,
get this crazy culture shock because I

1661
01:14:19,961 --> 01:14:24,450
feel like I'm in two different worlds
and when I'm there,

1662
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:27,070
so I mean there's,
it's uncomfortable,

1663
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,490
but because I'm passionate about it,
you know,

1664
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,750
I enjoy it.
But then getting back here,

1665
01:14:31,751 --> 01:14:32,650
sometimes it's like,
man,

1666
01:14:32,651 --> 01:14:35,920
like everything,
lot of times everything that we're

1667
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:37,210
chasing,
even me,

1668
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,650
it doesn't really matter in the big
grand scheme of things,

1669
01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:42,523
you know,
how can we,

1670
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:47,500
how can we get for ourselves,
how can we give to another person?

1671
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:48,700
Because like,
I mean,

1672
01:14:48,701 --> 01:14:51,250
it truly is like,
that's better than I know you have to

1673
01:14:51,251 --> 01:14:53,530
take care of yourself so you can take
care of someone else.

1674
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:54,520
Like I,
I get that.

1675
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:59,340
Um,
I just think it's kind of like this art

1676
01:14:59,341 --> 01:15:03,430
culture here.
You see kids and even adults,

1677
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:05,260
that's mine,
right?

1678
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:05,920
I mean,
that's,

1679
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:07,540
that's our culture.
We say that's mine.

1680
01:15:07,541 --> 01:15:08,410
Give me that.
It's mine.

1681
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:10,690
In Congo,
if a,

1682
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:14,320
if a kid,
if a kid that had the eggs,

1683
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:18,310
instead of having an egg,
if he had a bag of peanuts and he bought

1684
01:15:18,311 --> 01:15:22,180
it for himself and then I walked by
sitting down with them if a friend or

1685
01:15:22,181 --> 01:15:25,360
not even just introducing myself,
he's gonna offer me his food.

1686
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:28,870
He said instead of it's mine,
he's going to say you want some.

1687
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:32,060
And so it's different in that culture
where it's not,

1688
01:15:32,130 --> 01:15:35,410
they don't have anything,
but they'll give you everything that got

1689
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:36,610
like,
for instance,

1690
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:37,990
um,
that,

1691
01:15:37,991 --> 01:15:39,640
that knife last time,
uh,

1692
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:43,090
that I was able to bring back,
that chief Leo may made,

1693
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,560
um,
you know,

1694
01:15:44,561 --> 01:15:46,990
he,
he made a bow and Arrow and I'm actually

1695
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:47,950
bringing that to you.

1696
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:52,090
It was under our crawlspace and I lost
it when now everyone know where it is.

1697
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:54,370
But uh,
it's pumped to bring that back to you.

1698
01:15:54,371 --> 01:15:57,820
But I mean for them to give that kind of
stuff away.

1699
01:15:58,570 --> 01:16:02,980
Whenever Leo May,
he's the chief of his village and now

1700
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:04,930
because he's got a job,
he might have more.

1701
01:16:04,931 --> 01:16:08,590
But whenever I knew him,
he had maybe he was lucky if he had two

1702
01:16:08,591 --> 01:16:11,980
changes of clothes because most of the
pygmies have the clothes on their back.

1703
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,380
They don't even have a blanket,
the fires their blanket.

1704
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,510
Um,
and so it's just completely night and

1705
01:16:19,511 --> 01:16:21,520
day difference.
There's a lot of people that listen to

1706
01:16:21,521 --> 01:16:22,900
this,
that have gotten this far,

1707
01:16:22,901 --> 01:16:24,310
that want to figure out how they can
help.

1708
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:26,590
So what,
what can people do to donate?

1709
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:28,600
We're working.
They go,

1710
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,490
yeah.
I mean water for his website.

1711
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:33,370
Is that the best place to start or
forgotten.com?

1712
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:37,420
Both of them are one in the same for the
forgotten Dr. Yeah.

1713
01:16:37,421 --> 01:16:39,310
Dot Com.org.
They both work,

1714
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,680
both work for the [inaudible] dot com
and there's a big yellow donate button.

1715
01:16:44,681 --> 01:16:48,320
Click on that and have added folks.
Thank you man.

1716
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:52,540
It's been a,
it's been crazy what's going on.

1717
01:16:52,550 --> 01:16:53,820
We're getting ready to do something that
I'm,

1718
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:56,950
I'm pumped about me and Papa y and Ben
and Matt,

1719
01:16:56,951 --> 01:17:00,060
we had talked about it and kind of
dreamed it up and uh,

1720
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:04,720
and we were saying how awesome would it
be in the center in Buena,

1721
01:17:04,721 --> 01:17:08,590
which is kind of a city center,
maybe half less than half a million

1722
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:09,500
people for sure.
But um,

1723
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:11,320
you know,
in the city center where there's a

1724
01:17:11,321 --> 01:17:13,250
university,
there's a community development program

1725
01:17:13,251 --> 01:17:18,251
that's literally changing their part of
Congo by not waiting on the government

1726
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:23,360
or by not waiting on an NGO,
like they're just taking the initiative

1727
01:17:23,361 --> 01:17:24,194
themselves.

1728
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:29,290
And so we've seen that they're so bought
in that whenever we presented an idea of

1729
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:34,510
what if we could start a sustainable
solutions appropriate technology center

1730
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:38,810
where there's land,
water and food solutions and then after

1731
01:17:38,811 --> 01:17:41,330
that maybe we can get into solar and
maybe after that we can do this or that

1732
01:17:41,331 --> 01:17:42,380
or you know,
whatever.

1733
01:17:42,381 --> 01:17:46,490
But at that place will have different
stations where here's land,

1734
01:17:46,491 --> 01:17:50,960
you can come learn about land rights,
how to replant the trees,

1735
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:52,520
the forestry aspect,
you know,

1736
01:17:52,521 --> 01:17:55,100
all that different stuff.
The ports of land and we have people

1737
01:17:55,101 --> 01:17:56,960
there that can help and show them
things.

1738
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:01,790
If a chief wants to come in and book our
well drilling team for their community,

1739
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:02,930
for their,
they can come in,

1740
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:04,730
see how we do it,
why we do it,

1741
01:18:05,330 --> 01:18:07,250
everything about it.
We wouldn't have a little conference

1742
01:18:07,251 --> 01:18:10,070
room where we can train people up on the
wash program because now we're doing

1743
01:18:10,071 --> 01:18:10,610
that.

1744
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:12,260
All the villages that we've drilled
wells in,

1745
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:14,930
we're going back in,
we're doing the wash program,

1746
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:18,830
water and sanitation and hygiene.
And so with that,

1747
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,110
I mean if you didn't have the,
have outhouses,

1748
01:18:21,290 --> 01:18:23,330
what do they use for their.
Getting them there,

1749
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:24,470
getting them now.
And so,

1750
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:25,760
uh,
for the year I was there,

1751
01:18:25,820 --> 01:18:29,270
there was one or two of the 10 villages
we were in,

1752
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:33,560
had a quote unquote latrine,
but it was only like three or four feet

1753
01:18:33,561 --> 01:18:34,394
deep,
which isn't,

1754
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:36,950
isn't a safe some,
most of them are just going in the

1755
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:37,641
woods.
Yeah.

1756
01:18:37,641 --> 01:18:40,060
And honestly like that's if.
Yeah,

1757
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:44,150
until you do it the right way with cars
outside of there,

1758
01:18:44,151 --> 01:18:46,100
some of those,
some of those latrines in the city's

1759
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:46,941
man.
I,

1760
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:50,450
I definitely think I've gotten sick from
a fly that maybe waited there.

1761
01:18:50,451 --> 01:18:51,284
So I mean,
I don't know,

1762
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:53,930
but um,
but yeah,

1763
01:18:53,931 --> 01:18:57,110
so we get to go in there now,
teach them how to dig the latrines,

1764
01:18:57,111 --> 01:18:59,510
make sure it's way far enough away from
the water.

1765
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,740
Well,
um,

1766
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:01,920
and then,
you know,

1767
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,780
outside of that,
that's another issue too.

1768
01:19:03,781 --> 01:19:06,200
Erratic and can contaminate the water if
you want.

1769
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:09,830
If you have to keep um,
what is I think 30 meters away,

1770
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:13,160
uh,
or more any latrines.

1771
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:15,830
And then if it's a,
uh,

1772
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:19,550
like a,
was that a dump?

1773
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,830
The trash dump?
Um,

1774
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:22,930
it has to be 50 meters or more
batteries,

1775
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:24,970
different stuff like that.
And um,

1776
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,350
and so yeah,
we make sure in this is what's not.

1777
01:19:27,351 --> 01:19:29,310
So uh,
uh,

1778
01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,350
one of my last trips I went and we're
going through Uganda on the border of

1779
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:38,210
Congo and there's these people,
they're so proud of their water well,

1780
01:19:38,211 --> 01:19:41,060
and I love that.
But then I feel like the people,

1781
01:19:41,061 --> 01:19:42,490
whoever did it,
um,

1782
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:46,160
I don't know,
cut them really short,

1783
01:19:46,161 --> 01:19:48,470
they're just,
they shouldn't be drilling wells because

1784
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:53,510
I went to the restroom and then also I
look out the window and I'm at a gas

1785
01:19:53,511 --> 01:19:55,440
station you got,
is a lot nicer than Congo.

1786
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:57,950
Um,
I mean there's still terrible brutal

1787
01:19:57,980 --> 01:20:00,830
party parts of that,
but just night and day difference.

1788
01:20:01,420 --> 01:20:04,190
Um,
and whenever I looked out and see

1789
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:06,410
there's,
here's the 18 wheeler filling up,

1790
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:09,060
here's someone else up in,
in between that I'm,

1791
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:11,790
I'm at the toilets at the other side.
There's a trash dump.

1792
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,700
There's 18 wheelers and trucks filling
up with fuel.

1793
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:18,180
And right in the middle of the two fuel
pumps is a water.

1794
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:21,120
Well,
they drilled it on the,

1795
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:26,270
on the lot of the gas station with a
trash dump with a latrines and toilets.

1796
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:28,590
And so it was completely contaminating
in.

1797
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,670
The line was so long in.
And Ben was trying to tell him like,

1798
01:20:32,671 --> 01:20:34,980
hey,
just want to tell you because we love

1799
01:20:34,981 --> 01:20:36,540
you.
That water is really not safe.

1800
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,770
Same thing,
Matt,

1801
01:20:38,010 --> 01:20:40,340
Matt kind of ingrained,
ingrained that into a store.

1802
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:41,570
It's like,
um,

1803
01:20:42,300 --> 01:20:43,680
you know,
you got to do it the right way.

1804
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:47,790
And so ben was taught that,
so these recent well that these guys had

1805
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:50,850
put in and it was one of the,
and there's a big line of people to try

1806
01:20:50,851 --> 01:20:53,010
to get to this,
telling you there was at least 20,

1807
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:54,620
30 people in line.
Um,

1808
01:20:54,990 --> 01:20:58,470
and Ben was trying to tell them in the
most appropriate way possible.

1809
01:20:58,471 --> 01:21:02,010
They're like not crush the hopes and
dreams of the village there,

1810
01:21:02,850 --> 01:21:04,050
but you also want to know like,
hey,

1811
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:05,670
this water can,
it looks safe.

1812
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:07,720
It's not.
So uh,

1813
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:11,070
so that's why we're testing our wells
and whatever happened in that,

1814
01:21:11,180 --> 01:21:13,020
which is you had to leave.
Yeah,

1815
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:17,010
I mean it's a town we don't,
I've been in the town maybe twice,

1816
01:21:17,430 --> 01:21:18,530
but um,
yeah,

1817
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:20,850
it was the first time that I saw last
time.

1818
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,600
Jesus.
Yup.

1819
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,340
So,
uh,

1820
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:25,320
but that's what's creating a lot of
people don't know,

1821
01:21:25,321 --> 01:21:27,890
like a,
I think it's no,

1822
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:28,470
I know it is.

1823
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:32,610
Half the hospital beds in the world
right now are because of dirty water or

1824
01:21:32,611 --> 01:21:35,910
water borne related diseases,
half,

1825
01:21:35,911 --> 01:21:36,744
half and half.
Right.

1826
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:40,380
So if,
if we were able to,

1827
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,810
if,
if as human beings,

1828
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,940
if we could join forces unite,
Kinda like everyone did against a

1829
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:50,130
bullet,
if we attack the problem head on and

1830
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:52,470
just because we got it,
we don't pretend to everybody else has

1831
01:21:52,471 --> 01:21:55,290
it.
Like we could really in this thing,

1832
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,153
we could,
uh,

1833
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:58,980
we could fix it.
Like the tools are there,

1834
01:21:59,010 --> 01:22:01,140
the water is there,
it's under her feet.

1835
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,020
And here we wasted it.
And there we,

1836
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:04,710
they're,
uh,

1837
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:05,543
they're,
they don't have it.

1838
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:08,070
We don't hear about Ebola anymore.
It's like,

1839
01:22:08,071 --> 01:22:10,650
it's over.
It's like they moved on to Zika,

1840
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:11,920
Zika,
Zika,

1841
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:14,420
Zika.
Are All the Olympians are going to get

1842
01:22:14,421 --> 01:22:14,770
it?
Yeah.

1843
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:17,430
They're fucked all of them.
Oh,

1844
01:22:17,431 --> 01:22:18,090
this is crazy.

1845
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:19,350
When I got back,
they were,

1846
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:24,270
the CDC was testing me on two different
rounds of treatments trying to figure

1847
01:22:24,271 --> 01:22:27,000
out what.
So on that trip I told you going in,

1848
01:22:27,001 --> 01:22:29,210
I got malaria right now,
malaria.

1849
01:22:29,211 --> 01:22:32,580
I keep me ask you this because you have
malaria can somehow get it from,

1850
01:22:32,581 --> 01:22:36,900
you know,
if a mosquito stings you while you have

1851
01:22:36,901 --> 01:22:38,280
malaria and instinct,
somebody else,

1852
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:40,470
they can't get it.
Uh,

1853
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,150
I mean that's what I never heard of.
I've never thought of that one.

1854
01:22:45,151 --> 01:22:47,460
But remember that when people were
worried about that with HIV,

1855
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:49,950
they're worried about mosquito
transmission.

1856
01:22:49,951 --> 01:22:52,170
That was like the big thing.
Keep away from gay people in the summer.

1857
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:54,800
No,
I,

1858
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:56,850
I,
I had never thought of that.

1859
01:22:56,851 --> 01:22:59,100
But I know that don't shoot here on the
swamp.

1860
01:23:01,080 --> 01:23:03,030
I know that the,
yeah,

1861
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,000
the doctors that,
you know,

1862
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:06,440
they're always saying you're,
you're fine.

1863
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:09,160
I mean I can,
I can fight and everything else.

1864
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:10,300
That's crazy.
My blood.

1865
01:23:10,301 --> 01:23:12,550
And you have malaria and you could
fight.

1866
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:13,700
Yeah.
But I,

1867
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:15,460
I literally don't because it's in my
liver.

1868
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:18,850
I think you'd have to go into the liver
unless it was a current outbreak.

1869
01:23:18,851 --> 01:23:20,610
That,
what about a liver kick?

1870
01:23:20,970 --> 01:23:22,840
Got Liver kicked.
Don't,

1871
01:23:22,841 --> 01:23:24,760
don't let out the Bazooka,
just get.

1872
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:27,620
Um,
no,

1873
01:23:27,640 --> 01:23:28,750
but it's,
it's,

1874
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,800
it's been a lot of fun too.
I don't know,

1875
01:23:31,820 --> 01:23:36,620
I,
I think what maybe kinda shifted was the

1876
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,710
kinda grown up,
you know,

1877
01:23:38,740 --> 01:23:41,350
getting bullied.
You're only looking at why am I getting

1878
01:23:41,351 --> 01:23:43,990
bullied and all this stuff's true and I
am not a good person.

1879
01:23:44,530 --> 01:23:46,600
And then nobody likes me,
whatever.

1880
01:23:47,020 --> 01:23:51,130
Then when I got 23 fighting,
still not really fulfilled.

1881
01:23:51,131 --> 01:23:53,260
I was living for more for myself there.
And I'm like,

1882
01:23:53,261 --> 01:23:54,094
man,
what?

1883
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:58,960
What am I doing with my life?
And now it's so cool because seeing that

1884
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:03,070
and being able to tell you that last
time I was here 20 water wells or 25.

1885
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:06,760
But regardless we've,
we've done 20 or 25 more.

1886
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:11,320
And so that to me is a life that I get
to look at.

1887
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:14,110
And if I were to,
if I were to die,

1888
01:24:14,111 --> 01:24:18,130
I know,
I know without a shadow of a doubt that

1889
01:24:18,131 --> 01:24:22,060
my life meant something.
And I know that I would,

1890
01:24:22,150 --> 01:24:25,470
I never felt that before,
during the depression,

1891
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:29,590
addiction and all that other stuff.
But now I know that the life I live

1892
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:32,050
hopefully will outlive my life.
You know,

1893
01:24:32,051 --> 01:24:35,440
like the,
I want this team to doing what they're

1894
01:24:35,441 --> 01:24:37,720
doing,
climb higher than I can climb,

1895
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:38,440
run farther than that.

1896
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,900
I can run,
jump higher than I can jump,

1897
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:42,460
you know,
like I want my.

1898
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,720
What's that saying?
I want my,

1899
01:24:43,721 --> 01:24:48,580
a ceiling to be there for.
I want them to go farther than I can go

1900
01:24:48,640 --> 01:24:53,440
because then that means that I actually
made an impact that matters,

1901
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:56,080
that matter to them enough that it
continued,

1902
01:24:56,650 --> 01:25:01,650
that it had a residual effect that just
kept kept on going and me,

1903
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:06,430
and that's really shifted kind of kind
of everything in my life.

1904
01:25:06,431 --> 01:25:07,000
Like,
man,

1905
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,040
this is,
this is what life is about.

1906
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:13,240
Like if I know I've been signing my book
recently or ever since it came out,

1907
01:25:13,241 --> 01:25:18,130
but I signed it live to love,
love to live and I know that can sound

1908
01:25:18,131 --> 01:25:21,820
cheesy or goofy or whatever,
but that's something that just really

1909
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:26,140
helped me whenever I was sobering up was
man,

1910
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:30,490
if that's what I focus on,
if I can live my life to love,

1911
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:33,210
love now,
love the live,

1912
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,760
but everyone wants to love their own
life that they live and so they're just

1913
01:25:36,761 --> 01:25:40,180
focused on that and get this and get
this materialistic thing and get this

1914
01:25:40,181 --> 01:25:41,950
different chick because she didn't make
me happier.

1915
01:25:42,250 --> 01:25:43,600
You know,
this or that or whatever.

1916
01:25:43,780 --> 01:25:44,830
Whenever it's like,
you know what?

1917
01:25:44,831 --> 01:25:45,664
Like,
Hey,

1918
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:47,800
let's focus.
Let's.

1919
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:51,490
I don't know if that's.
If that's a natural inclination to

1920
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:55,990
gravitate towards unattainable things
like Ferrari's and mansions and you see

1921
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:58,470
those things on tv and the movies and
you just,

1922
01:25:58,810 --> 01:26:03,040
that shows you that you've made it and
when you don't have anything in,

1923
01:26:03,280 --> 01:26:04,100
you're wanting for

1924
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,370
things and you don't have money and
you're struggling,

1925
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:10,820
you look at someone who's got all those
things and money and you think,

1926
01:26:10,850 --> 01:26:13,760
if I only had that all my worries would
be gone,

1927
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:17,720
then I would be happy.
But if you have that and nobody likes

1928
01:26:17,721 --> 01:26:19,430
you,
you life is shit.

1929
01:26:19,690 --> 01:26:20,380
Yeah,
it's,

1930
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,890
it's still shit.
Meanwhile,

1931
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:26,000
you are in a hut in the middle of
nowhere with,

1932
01:26:26,030 --> 01:26:29,870
well the middle of the Congo with all
these people and you're having a great

1933
01:26:29,871 --> 01:26:34,490
time and you're making wells and you're
loving life that,

1934
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:35,480
that picture that

1935
01:26:36,430 --> 01:26:37,450
came up,
I think why?

1936
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:41,560
Why I got so excited was um,
because that night in that village,

1937
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:45,310
I mean we,
I'm not kidding.

1938
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,930
Danced and danced and danced and in and
in feast it.

1939
01:26:49,931 --> 01:26:53,200
I mean we just all came together just to
celebrate,

1940
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:55,510
celebrate life,
celebrate each other,

1941
01:26:55,660 --> 01:26:56,381
celebrate.
Guess what?

1942
01:26:56,381 --> 01:26:58,780
Our kids are going to be sick anymore.
Different stuff like that too,

1943
01:26:58,790 --> 01:27:03,790
where it's just a life where like,
like what you were just saying,

1944
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:06,010
you're always comparing,
comparing,

1945
01:27:06,011 --> 01:27:07,900
comparing.
For me,

1946
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:09,220
man.
Comparison.

1947
01:27:09,550 --> 01:27:11,860
I think for most people,
um,

1948
01:27:12,130 --> 01:27:16,030
comparison is probably the number one
fif what robs us of joy,

1949
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:19,180
of,
of being able to be at peace is we're

1950
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:21,310
always comparing ourselves and we always
compare up.

1951
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,440
We never compared down,
um,

1952
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,290
or just compare ourselves to people that
are just like us.

1953
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,890
We always look at that.
What you're saying is unattainable and

1954
01:27:29,891 --> 01:27:31,270
I'm always pursuing that.

1955
01:27:31,270 --> 01:27:34,190
And my whole thing has been like
recently just man,

1956
01:27:34,240 --> 01:27:35,980
I just want,
I think our,

1957
01:27:36,160 --> 01:27:40,960
I've learned it from our team in Congo.
Like that's been the greatest gift.

1958
01:27:40,961 --> 01:27:42,970
Like you were saying that,
you know,

1959
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,690
there's been a lot of great stuff that's
been happening and that's true.

1960
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,770
But I,
and started thinking now I think it

1961
01:27:50,771 --> 01:27:52,200
sounds Cliche,
but I'll say it anyways,

1962
01:27:52,220 --> 01:27:57,220
where men like
they've given me more of a gift than I

1963
01:27:57,341 --> 01:27:58,780
can.
I can give them.

1964
01:27:58,960 --> 01:27:59,361
I mean,
you,

1965
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:01,210
you see,
I told you that the grown up and

1966
01:28:01,211 --> 01:28:02,044
everything else,
but to,

1967
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,480
to find a life of,
of purpose,

1968
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:08,830
have passion of helping one another of,
I don't know,

1969
01:28:08,860 --> 01:28:11,440
our mission statement is defend the weak
love,

1970
01:28:11,441 --> 01:28:14,650
the unloved and power,
the voiceless than the vision statement

1971
01:28:14,651 --> 01:28:17,860
is overcoming oppression with
overwhelming opportunity.

1972
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:21,010
And so if we can go into these
communities and we've seen incredible

1973
01:28:21,011 --> 01:28:21,980
stuff,
that's what's gonna be in the Doc.

1974
01:28:21,990 --> 01:28:24,220
This last trip,
me,

1975
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:25,690
Ben,
Matt and Derek,

1976
01:28:25,691 --> 01:28:27,760
the filmmaker,
we would not be,

1977
01:28:28,270 --> 01:28:30,610
they wouldn't be ashamed.
Me saying this,

1978
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:33,550
we were in tears after an interview
with,

1979
01:28:33,551 --> 01:28:37,090
uh,
one of the former slave masters that ran

1980
01:28:37,091 --> 01:28:38,620
a hospital,
um,

1981
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:40,900
in actually,
if you could pull up a picture,

1982
01:28:40,901 --> 01:28:43,120
it's called Cap Toula.
Um,

1983
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,600
and we were at this,
this hospital.

1984
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:51,200
And it's tough because we were trying to
get treatment for Cap Tuliza.

1985
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:53,670
He's a buddy of mine that passed away.
Um,

1986
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:56,050
and we spent seven months taking the
hospital to the hospital,

1987
01:28:56,100 --> 01:28:58,370
the hospital,
and they're just send them away because

1988
01:28:58,371 --> 01:29:00,680
it was the pygmy in.
And it's like,

1989
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:02,070
I,
my

1990
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,710
first song actually if you bring up the
maybe the first cap,

1991
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:09,870
that's when I saw them,
that's when I saw him for the very first

1992
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:13,000
time or looking at a guidance is
extremely amazing.

1993
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:16,650
Yeah.
And so for me,

1994
01:29:16,660 --> 01:29:18,540
so what is going on with his health
right here,

1995
01:29:18,570 --> 01:29:19,950
right there.
We didn't know.

1996
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,690
But uh,
I had,

1997
01:29:21,710 --> 01:29:24,210
uh,
I mean a gut feeling that it could have

1998
01:29:24,211 --> 01:29:27,720
been tuberculosis because we've,
we've helped several of the pygmies have

1999
01:29:27,721 --> 01:29:30,540
tuberculosis and stuff,
little grilling Faena and some others.

2000
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:31,740
Um,
fema,

2001
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:34,760
nettle root cause of tuberculosis.
There was some sort of a study on that.

2002
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:36,900
Reasons that you have a low immune
system.

2003
01:29:36,901 --> 01:29:39,090
And uh,
there was something that just came out

2004
01:29:39,091 --> 01:29:41,760
like really recently about tuberculosis.
Were there.

2005
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:44,940
I had something to do with fire.

2006
01:29:46,930 --> 01:29:47,763
Hmm.

2007
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:48,460
Oh,
if,

2008
01:29:48,460 --> 01:29:52,630
if it's something to do with smoke,
I believe that because the bacteria from

2009
01:29:52,631 --> 01:29:56,800
person to person through microscopic
droplets releasing the air can happen

2010
01:29:56,801 --> 01:30:00,880
when someone in the untreated active
form of tuberculosis cough speaks,

2011
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:02,410
sneezes,
Spitz,

2012
01:30:02,440 --> 01:30:05,230
laughs or sayings,
Jesus Christ.

2013
01:30:05,231 --> 01:30:07,510
Mind you get tuberculosis from a shitty
song.

2014
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:12,850
Like some dude breaks out the Banjo,
like that scene in animal house breaks

2015
01:30:12,851 --> 01:30:16,030
out a guitar and started saying it and
it gives you tuberculosis as well as an

2016
01:30:16,031 --> 01:30:21,031
ir beating.
Let's see if this.

2017
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,170
Was there,
some connection with fire.

2018
01:30:23,171 --> 01:30:25,990
I swear I read something really recently
about that.

2019
01:30:26,620 --> 01:30:29,590
Some connection between tuberculosis.
Is that it?

2020
01:30:30,010 --> 01:30:33,910
Here it is.
Was tuberculosis born of fire by

2021
01:30:33,911 --> 01:30:37,180
damaging lungs and bringing people
together?

2022
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:42,720
Fire may have turned a soil.
Microbes into global pathogen.

2023
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:46,960
Whoa.
Many thousands of years ago.

2024
01:30:46,980 --> 01:30:47,813
Chile.
African night.

2025
01:30:47,890 --> 01:30:50,860
That's interesting.
So they think that might have started it

2026
01:30:50,870 --> 01:30:54,490
all around a fire in a cave and that
were always in the fire.

2027
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:55,780
I can't.
I can't sleep with.

2028
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:58,750
That's why the bugs are even worse on me
because I.

2029
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:02,980
I have many times slept in the huts
whenever the fires go in,

2030
01:31:03,370 --> 01:31:05,380
but it just fills up with smoke toward
my eyes.

2031
01:31:05,381 --> 01:31:07,900
Just tears are coming down with the
light.

2032
01:31:07,901 --> 01:31:09,310
A fire in their hut.
Yeah,

2033
01:31:09,311 --> 01:31:11,920
that's their.
That's how they keep the bugs out.

2034
01:31:12,370 --> 01:31:13,510
Oh,
well it's one of the ways,

2035
01:31:13,511 --> 01:31:17,790
but it's mainly for warmth,
but a benefit is there's less bugs and

2036
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:18,730
then uh,
it,

2037
01:31:18,731 --> 01:31:22,030
uh,
and it can help waterproof.

2038
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:26,880
They're tweaking leaf huts were enough
smoke and everything had kinda like a

2039
01:31:26,970 --> 01:31:28,000
tar.
So yeah.

2040
01:31:28,690 --> 01:31:30,400
Your lungs too though,
right?

2041
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:31,061
Of course.
Yeah.

2042
01:31:31,061 --> 01:31:34,530
And there's so many kids that are
getting in at this sustainable solutions

2043
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:36,090
center that we're hoping to,
you know,

2044
01:31:36,430 --> 01:31:38,590
get up and running.
We're wanting one for cooking where they

2045
01:31:38,591 --> 01:31:43,591
can use either corn cobs or a or corn
husk or peanut shells or different

2046
01:31:44,201 --> 01:31:48,280
things where they can put those into
little briquettes and then they can use

2047
01:31:48,281 --> 01:31:50,270
that and recycle it and everything else
in it,

2048
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:52,450
it burns longer,
uh,

2049
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:54,190
at,
at the same temperature.

2050
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:55,810
And uh,
yeah.

2051
01:31:55,811 --> 01:31:58,570
And you don't have to force anything and
you're not breathing in that terrible

2052
01:31:58,571 --> 01:32:00,310
smoke.
Coconut charcoal

2053
01:32:00,310 --> 01:32:02,350
is a really fun.
Um,

2054
01:32:02,530 --> 01:32:03,970
there's uh,
some company,

2055
01:32:03,971 --> 01:32:07,120
a grilled tomato company.
You know what a tomato is one of those

2056
01:32:07,121 --> 01:32:08,760
Japanese grills.
Yes,

2057
01:32:08,770 --> 01:32:10,300
like a green egg,
that kind of thing.

2058
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:14,800
And they sell a charcoal made out of
coconut and apparently it's one of the

2059
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:18,040
best charcoals because it's really
sustainable,

2060
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:23,041
it's really easy to grow and it's a,
it's much wages throw it away.

2061
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,950
So yeah,
exactly.

2062
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,680
People throw the outside of the cook
another way,

2063
01:32:29,681 --> 01:32:31,300
but apparently it's really good for
charcoal.

2064
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:35,890
So Bella tour has embraced this
narrative.

2065
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:40,690
They've embraced your story and they've
made it a big part of your fighting

2066
01:32:40,691 --> 01:32:41,790
there to,
uh,

2067
01:32:41,860 --> 01:32:45,610
let everybody know that you're doing it,
not just because you want to compete,

2068
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:50,611
but also because you want to expose the
world to this passion that this project,

2069
01:32:52,451 --> 01:32:53,240
this,
this,

2070
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:56,290
this sort of life direction that you've
taken.

2071
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:58,060
Yeah,
absolutely.

2072
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,920
And I,
it's really cool that they've done that.

2073
01:33:00,190 --> 01:33:00,761
Yeah,
no,

2074
01:33:00,761 --> 01:33:02,370
I,
I agree in that.

2075
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,270
That was the,
I love it dude.

2076
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:06,190
I love the UFC.
That's what I was 13 years old.

2077
01:33:06,191 --> 01:33:09,820
Found the stapes and I'm just on that
real quick,

2078
01:33:10,130 --> 01:33:13,180
uh,
why bottle those tapes put 'em under my

2079
01:33:13,181 --> 01:33:17,770
bed and I would wait for my parents to
go to work or to go to sleep and I'd be

2080
01:33:17,771 --> 01:33:19,110
popping them in.
Uh,

2081
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:20,070
the,
you know,

2082
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:23,800
the vhs and my dad comes in and I turn
it off real quick,

2083
01:33:23,801 --> 01:33:25,890
lay down,
act like I'm asleep and it's,

2084
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,800
you know,
the vcrs,

2085
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:29,490
vhs is still moving in the,
the,

2086
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,540
I don't know,
the screen still lit up and everything,

2087
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,530
but he had confiscated that tape.
Then when he found the rest he thought

2088
01:33:35,531 --> 01:33:36,550
it was a,
all porn,

2089
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:41,790
but it was a binding confiscated a lot.

2090
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:45,640
I think me being 13 being picked on it.
He didn't want me to start fighting

2091
01:33:45,641 --> 01:33:48,850
people at school and different stuff.
And so just a,

2092
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,470
just a precaution.
But he always,

2093
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:53,980
he told my mom he's going to do that one
day if we let him keep that stuff.

2094
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:55,701
I was like,
no,

2095
01:33:55,701 --> 01:33:56,640
it won't.
But in my head I'm like,

2096
01:33:56,641 --> 01:33:57,310
yeah,
I will.

2097
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:02,310
I remember looking at the vhs tape and
when I turned it over and saw the

2098
01:34:03,880 --> 01:34:07,120
Jujitsu and sumo and boxing and
wrestling and all these different

2099
01:34:07,121 --> 01:34:09,820
things,
like it came alive to me and it's like,

2100
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:11,440
oh my goodness,
these guys.

2101
01:34:12,070 --> 01:34:14,230
Well,
I think I originally connected with it

2102
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,030
because because I,
I'm like,

2103
01:34:16,150 --> 01:34:19,600
well these guys are anything like me,
they could stick up for themselves.

2104
01:34:19,601 --> 01:34:21,070
They can,
they're an athlete,

2105
01:34:21,071 --> 01:34:23,290
they're popular,
probably said being the laughingstock at

2106
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:26,170
the party.
It might be invited to the party or it

2107
01:34:26,171 --> 01:34:27,004
might be their party.

2108
01:34:27,850 --> 01:34:29,740
And so I mean I,
I liked that aspect,

2109
01:34:29,741 --> 01:34:33,670
but then I just fell in love with the
sport of it and you're watching it and

2110
01:34:33,671 --> 01:34:37,630
seeing how everything and now being a
fan and watch now it's evolved and

2111
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:38,500
everything else.
It's just,

2112
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,560
it's not seeing the guy like Dan
Henderson that's been fighting,

2113
01:34:41,561 --> 01:34:43,210
I think isn't it?
Twenty years straight.

2114
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,150
20,
20,

2115
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:47,140
straight.
So I was there when he was fighting in

2116
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:49,870
97 and I wasn't there for his first
fight.

2117
01:34:50,140 --> 01:34:52,510
He fought in [inaudible] 96 I think in
Brazil.

2118
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,240
Yup.
I think that was his first.

2119
01:34:54,370 --> 01:34:56,830
I actually watched that first fight in
the last couple of weeks.

2120
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,680
Really?
Yeah,

2121
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,110
because

2122
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:59,380
dude,
I loved him.

2123
01:35:00,040 --> 01:35:00,873
Awesome.
Yeah.

2124
01:35:01,210 --> 01:35:04,460
And see him even I.
because whenever he stepped in,

2125
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:06,440
he was just a wrestler that had heavy
hands,

2126
01:35:06,620 --> 01:35:08,220
but then he just,
he didn't even have to be.

2127
01:35:08,810 --> 01:35:09,643
Yeah,
you're right.

2128
01:35:09,740 --> 01:35:11,950
You're right.
Getting it was just a down and I'm

2129
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:17,140
taking them down and pound on them and
he figured out over time how to utilize

2130
01:35:17,751 --> 01:35:19,130
his power.
That's what I want to get.

2131
01:35:19,131 --> 01:35:24,110
Maybe I could bribe a den or big country
or someone to teach me that big right

2132
01:35:24,111 --> 01:35:28,610
hand.
Do you think someone that I don't mean

2133
01:35:28,611 --> 01:35:33,190
Dan's one of the guys that have come on,
but big country always has power.

2134
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:37,190
Big country was known way back in the
day as being a Jujitsu guy.

2135
01:35:37,220 --> 01:35:40,230
He was one of Mark Landmines guys.
And he was a,

2136
01:35:40,340 --> 01:35:42,890
you know,
like really respected as a grappler

2137
01:35:43,150 --> 01:35:47,060
black belt.
But to go from that to being this crazy

2138
01:35:47,061 --> 01:35:50,990
knockout brawler,
it's like people rarely see big country.

2139
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,450
He'd never seen submitted anybody.
I mean,

2140
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:56,340
the closest thing was when he took Kimbo
down and got him into the mounted

2141
01:35:56,350 --> 01:35:58,970
crucifix and just elbowed them until the
referee stopped the fight.

2142
01:35:59,650 --> 01:36:01,650
But then the whole season,
uh,

2143
01:36:02,030 --> 01:36:03,410
he,
I think there were a couple elbows,

2144
01:36:03,411 --> 01:36:07,490
but when they finally stopped it,
we were all counting every single punch

2145
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:08,450
and then,
uh,

2146
01:36:08,450 --> 01:36:11,670
but he was just,
just tapping his forehead like this one

2147
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:14,270
because it wasn't intelligently
defending himself,

2148
01:36:14,271 --> 01:36:16,530
but he didn't even have to hurt them to
stop the fight.

2149
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,170
I just tapping his forehead.
Well,

2150
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:20,300
he was almost like a,
you know,

2151
01:36:20,301 --> 01:36:23,150
when you,
what does that called in wrestling when

2152
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:25,790
you have so many points?
It's a technical.

2153
01:36:26,070 --> 01:36:26,920
Yeah.
That fall,

2154
01:36:27,240 --> 01:36:29,760
fall almost like that.
It's like you're never coming back to

2155
01:36:29,761 --> 01:36:32,660
this 10,
10 run rule and little league baseball.

2156
01:36:32,770 --> 01:36:34,040
Yeah,
10 points up.

2157
01:36:34,041 --> 01:36:34,750
You just call it.

2158
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:37,490
And uh,
the big countries got very good

2159
01:36:37,530 --> 01:36:40,250
submissions.
But everybody expected that from him

2160
01:36:40,251 --> 01:36:42,530
when he started fighting.
Like if you remember back when he was

2161
01:36:42,531 --> 01:36:45,200
fighting for a lead ECC,
which was like the most corrupt

2162
01:36:45,201 --> 01:36:50,201
organization in the early days of MMA.
He had Andre Arlovski down control up

2163
01:36:50,480 --> 01:36:54,290
working for Komora,
had that control and had that double

2164
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:56,990
wrist lock position and it was working
for the Camorra and they stood them

2165
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:59,300
right up.
And I remember watching TV going,

2166
01:37:00,250 --> 01:37:03,060
it's cool screaming at the TV,
it's Co rob,

2167
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:06,590
they had a 15 second rule,
like if you went,

2168
01:37:06,591 --> 01:37:09,110
if you went to the ground,
if nothing happened in 15 seconds,

2169
01:37:09,500 --> 01:37:11,780
I think jake shields submitted Paul
Daley.

2170
01:37:11,781 --> 01:37:14,270
It was one of the few submissions and
that lead to ECC,

2171
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:16,280
but it's just,
he just mounted them and just

2172
01:37:16,370 --> 01:37:18,230
immediately went to an arm bar and
locked it in.

2173
01:37:19,250 --> 01:37:20,280
Well,
yeah,

2174
01:37:20,570 --> 01:37:22,820
I think it's Paul Daley.

2175
01:37:23,380 --> 01:37:25,700
I might be wrong.
I was actually,

2176
01:37:25,730 --> 01:37:27,420
um,
I mean,

2177
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:29,600
no,
with kimball stuff happening.

2178
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:31,160
It's pretty roomy.
It's sad.

2179
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,850
Very sad that man.
I mean apparently he had a doctor

2180
01:37:34,851 --> 01:37:35,684
telling them,
you know,

2181
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:36,920
for people don't know what we're talking
about.

2182
01:37:36,921 --> 01:37:40,490
Kimbo died really recently of a heart
disease and he had a doctor telling them

2183
01:37:40,491 --> 01:37:43,250
recently that uh,
he needed a heart transplant.

2184
01:37:43,730 --> 01:37:47,740
I guess he had some sort of congenital
heart disease that um,

2185
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:49,700
I mean,
how could that be,

2186
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:50,620
you know,
you look at them,

2187
01:37:50,630 --> 01:37:52,820
you guys a studies in great shape.
I mean,

2188
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:56,340
how could you imagine that he,
his heart was so bad

2189
01:37:56,340 --> 01:37:58,230
that they were telling me you needed a
heart transplant

2190
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:01,600
and this.
Yeah,

2191
01:38:01,740 --> 01:38:05,070
this could probably sounds cliche again
too,

2192
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:09,330
because knowing him being on ultimate
fighter and a and him cooking the best

2193
01:38:09,331 --> 01:38:10,740
steak I've ever had.
Sorry,

2194
01:38:10,741 --> 01:38:11,730
big Josh.
Um,

2195
01:38:11,910 --> 01:38:13,680
uh,
but he,

2196
01:38:13,681 --> 01:38:14,840
uh,
I don't know yet,

2197
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,870
even though we had a bad heart.
I think emotionally I had a good heart

2198
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:20,590
and um,
he was always a good guy.

2199
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:22,290
He's a very friendly guy.
Yeah.

2200
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,390
Even even with,
um,

2201
01:38:25,370 --> 01:38:29,850
I mean technically we were supposed to
fight I think three times before or two

2202
01:38:29,851 --> 01:38:32,730
times elite ECC.
I wish my name was in the hat for that.

2203
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:36,120
Um,
and then because I was like in 19 or 20

2204
01:38:36,121 --> 01:38:39,360
year old kid,
I had a decent record and then,

2205
01:38:39,361 --> 01:38:42,330
um,
but it was bad matchup so they scrapped

2206
01:38:42,331 --> 01:38:43,910
it a get.
It wasn't smart then,

2207
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:45,870
uh,
then on the ultimate fighter I was

2208
01:38:45,871 --> 01:38:48,450
actually matched up with them and uh,
then Roy got it.

2209
01:38:48,940 --> 01:38:51,660
Um,
and then we were talking about it and

2210
01:38:51,661 --> 01:38:53,970
Bella tour were at our last fight.
Um,

2211
01:38:54,090 --> 01:38:56,880
February 19th I think,
Houston Toyota Center.

2212
01:38:57,090 --> 01:39:00,000
Um,
and backstage,

2213
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:03,010
uh Oh,
actually that was this,

2214
01:39:03,070 --> 01:39:06,840
this will be good in a way that the dude
just loved on.

2215
01:39:07,050 --> 01:39:08,220
Been My,
uh,

2216
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:13,410
brother and translated from Congo.
He got to actually come from Congo for

2217
01:39:13,411 --> 01:39:14,730
the,
my second fight.

2218
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:18,060
And so the first fight actually,
if you can pull up that video,

2219
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:20,130
it's a,
it's called,

2220
01:39:20,131 --> 01:39:22,170
um,
fight day,

2221
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,870
uh,
talking to my guys.

2222
01:39:25,350 --> 01:39:26,820
But um,
it's just,

2223
01:39:26,821 --> 01:39:28,020
uh,
it's less than a minute I think.

2224
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:29,230
And it's,
uh,

2225
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:31,470
they,
they surprised me for my first fight

2226
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:32,820
back.
Um,

2227
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,690
they surprised with Josh woke me up and
it was a guy that's like when my father

2228
01:39:36,691 --> 01:39:37,151
figure.
Got It.

2229
01:39:37,151 --> 01:39:39,750
It's like my brother and uh,
just awesome.

2230
01:39:39,751 --> 01:39:42,240
Fight Day.
My first thing you'd see in here is

2231
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:43,074
this,

2232
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:54,250
this was so awesome.
Who is this that's laying down to us?

2233
01:39:55,390 --> 01:39:57,020
Media.
Is that your voice?

2234
01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:02,040
You're going to watch it?
Yeah.

2235
01:40:02,070 --> 01:40:05,850
You can't fall in from presenter,
but we'll record this shit.

2236
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:10,040
Is it even tells you it's a beard?
He had talking beard.

2237
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:12,480
Yeah,
I miss.

2238
01:40:12,481 --> 01:40:17,481
You guys
can stop it at a minute.

2239
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,450
Yeah.
Yes sir.

2240
01:40:23,451 --> 01:40:25,670
The battle's already won before the
fight.

2241
01:40:25,671 --> 01:40:28,890
Hey,
your go back to can

2242
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:30,420
you can,
you can stop it now.

2243
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:31,343
And then,
um,

2244
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:33,280
it was uh,
it was really cool.

2245
01:40:33,281 --> 01:40:34,620
Like,
I mean Josh was filming because he

2246
01:40:34,621 --> 01:40:36,180
didn't want,
I guess it was a surprise they were

2247
01:40:36,181 --> 01:40:39,120
going to call me and everything else,
but they were in Uganda getting more

2248
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:41,160
well drilling supplies and because you
can't,

2249
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,900
you can't skype from,
from Congo.

2250
01:40:43,440 --> 01:40:48,240
So they were at a decent enough hotel,
had wifi and they were able to skype

2251
01:40:48,241 --> 01:40:51,610
with me the day of my first fight back
and uh,

2252
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:54,280
me and it was awesome.
It was so much motivation.

2253
01:40:54,281 --> 01:40:58,780
Seeing them here in them and then having
them come for the second fight was just

2254
01:40:58,781 --> 01:41:01,140
a and b.
There he was actually,

2255
01:41:01,150 --> 01:41:05,140
he was actually in my corner.
What you're doing is helping them by

2256
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:08,500
building wells is there.
Once you do that,

2257
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:12,550
like say if you establish a series of
wells and well building and everybody

2258
01:41:12,551 --> 01:41:15,040
has fresh water,
do you want to take it?

2259
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,030
Another step?
Did you,

2260
01:41:16,060 --> 01:41:21,060
did you want to try to give them safer
housing or cleaner housing?

2261
01:41:21,191 --> 01:41:23,980
Do you want to try to teach them how to
build houses or are you,

2262
01:41:24,340 --> 01:41:27,430
are you planning on an escalating it
from where you're at right now?

2263
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:28,660
Yeah,
in fact,

2264
01:41:28,670 --> 01:41:31,360
I went about it and it was a,
it was a learning lesson.

2265
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:34,420
I don't regret it because I've got some
great training here in California as a,

2266
01:41:34,630 --> 01:41:36,100
I think it's,
is it called Hisperia?

2267
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,360
California?
And uh,

2268
01:41:37,361 --> 01:41:41,290
there's something called cal earth and
they built eco domes are earth bag homes

2269
01:41:41,380 --> 01:41:42,940
and uh,
what they call them,

2270
01:41:42,941 --> 01:41:44,650
super adobe,
the technical term,

2271
01:41:45,190 --> 01:41:48,770
but they make,
it looks like pygmy huts out of sandbags

2272
01:41:48,850 --> 01:41:52,070
that they fill up with sand doing a
circle and supposedly there are

2273
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:53,890
earthquake proof,
tornado proof,

2274
01:41:53,891 --> 01:41:56,350
all this different stuff.
And this is it.

2275
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:58,570
Yeah,
right there in a dome is the strongest

2276
01:41:58,571 --> 01:42:02,440
structure known to Man Arches after
that,

2277
01:42:02,441 --> 01:42:03,580
or volt than the arch.

2278
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:06,880
But yeah,
I was in these exact buildings.

2279
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:09,960
That's like a hobbit house.
What a cool looking little house house.

2280
01:42:10,460 --> 01:42:12,640
It'll back up.
But I,

2281
01:42:12,850 --> 01:42:16,900
I went there because that's an Aztec
God,

2282
01:42:16,901 --> 01:42:20,020
right?
That's that Aztec snake,

2283
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:21,220
snake,
feathered,

2284
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:22,570
plumed serpent.
God,

2285
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:23,740
Costa Rica.
It might be,

2286
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:24,853
oh,
okay,

2287
01:42:24,940 --> 01:42:27,280
that makes sense.
Cal Earth greenbuild actually level

2288
01:42:27,281 --> 01:42:28,170
those guys there.
They have,

2289
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:30,860
we have a lot of likeminded,
um,

2290
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,250
beliefs of,
of how to help people.

2291
01:42:33,640 --> 01:42:34,780
And uh,
but yeah,

2292
01:42:34,781 --> 01:42:39,520
I loved it because housing was because I
slept in the Hudson the first two times

2293
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:43,360
I went and got rained on and literally
one time woke up in the mud,

2294
01:42:43,361 --> 01:42:46,420
like sunk halfway because it just rained
and rained and rained and rained and we

2295
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:48,190
were just lying in mud.
Yeah.

2296
01:42:48,191 --> 01:42:52,420
To where it just kept coming through was
just washing down the hill and when my

2297
01:42:52,421 --> 01:42:55,830
wife was there as doing it again and
hold the pygmies get up and uh,

2298
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,790
they came out and I didn't know what
they were doing.

2299
01:42:57,850 --> 01:42:59,380
Um,
I thought someone was going on because

2300
01:42:59,410 --> 01:43:03,430
everyone was around or hunting circle.
I'm digging this trench so it wouldn't

2301
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:07,600
come in and get emily wet and uh,
they're just so caring.

2302
01:43:07,601 --> 01:43:09,550
So awesome.
And uh,

2303
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,470
but when I saw the Hud,
those eco domes,

2304
01:43:11,471 --> 01:43:12,730
earth bag homes,
I was like,

2305
01:43:12,790 --> 01:43:15,070
man,
that's something culturally sound.

2306
01:43:15,370 --> 01:43:18,990
That is something that they would want
to live in because it looks like that I

2307
01:43:18,991 --> 01:43:22,900
looked like their similar and so this is
something that you want to try to

2308
01:43:22,901 --> 01:43:25,960
implement with without a doubt,
but it has to be the right timing

2309
01:43:25,961 --> 01:43:27,720
because what happened was,
um,

2310
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:28,770
I,
I,

2311
01:43:28,770 --> 01:43:33,760
I knew pop one in the schools working on
land and I was going to help with that

2312
01:43:33,761 --> 01:43:36,790
too.
I had no clue how to,

2313
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:38,670
how to get clean water.
Um,

2314
01:43:39,010 --> 01:43:39,850
I was looking forward.
I was,

2315
01:43:39,851 --> 01:43:41,320
I was in my backyard.

2316
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:44,980
I bought everything from Lowe's back
yard and he was like a website,

2317
01:43:45,090 --> 01:43:49,270
I think literally something like how to
drill your own well.org or something.

2318
01:43:49,660 --> 01:43:52,790
And it's this guy who stand on the back
of his pickup truck and he's,

2319
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:55,130
he's drilling a well,
but what I didn't know is that's not

2320
01:43:55,131 --> 01:43:57,860
drinkable water the way he's doing it
and everything else.

2321
01:43:57,861 --> 01:44:01,250
And so I'm in the backyard like five,
$600 of stuff.

2322
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:03,890
Put Pvc,
trying to drill my own well by myself.

2323
01:44:04,170 --> 01:44:05,080
Um,
and uh,

2324
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:07,220
trying to learn like me and it's so
hard.

2325
01:44:07,730 --> 01:44:12,020
There's gotta be an easier way.
And so I kinda stepped around that

2326
01:44:12,021 --> 01:44:12,710
because my,
you know what,

2327
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:15,230
I can't help them with housing if I go
here and get trained,

2328
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:18,740
sandbags are cheap,
get a couple shovels,

2329
01:44:18,950 --> 01:44:22,160
make some mud and get some cement and
make a plaster to go around it to

2330
01:44:22,161 --> 01:44:23,030
waterproof it better.

2331
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,440
Um,
and that's gonna work.

2332
01:44:24,470 --> 01:44:27,230
But then when we kind of pastor on how
to make it,

2333
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:31,490
make it out of a,
a mix of a cement and um,

2334
01:44:31,550 --> 01:44:33,240
soil.
And uh,

2335
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:34,730
if,
if it's got the right mixture,

2336
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:36,870
which I'm forgetting right now,
um,

2337
01:44:36,980 --> 01:44:41,540
it can be just as strong as or
waterproof as a concreter yeah.

2338
01:44:41,870 --> 01:44:45,260
So it's a,
it's a really great thing.

2339
01:44:45,261 --> 01:44:47,420
But when I get there and all of a sudden
I see,

2340
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:48,770
you know,
hey,

2341
01:44:48,770 --> 01:44:51,170
uh,
first,

2342
01:44:51,171 --> 01:44:52,940
if they don't have any land of their own
than building,

2343
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:54,920
these things are going to be worthless.
Someone else can move into them.

2344
01:44:55,070 --> 01:44:56,780
And uh,
so they got to have land.

2345
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:57,830
Firstly,
there's a process,

2346
01:44:57,831 --> 01:45:01,730
like the most important things land in
the water is water is next then food.

2347
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:04,100
And then for that,
yes it can be healthy.

2348
01:45:04,101 --> 01:45:09,101
I want to stay in a sweet spot in the
Middle Lane and not spread ourselves too

2349
01:45:09,381 --> 01:45:12,770
thin because you thought about this,
but these people that you dealt with in

2350
01:45:12,771 --> 01:45:15,440
California trying to bring them in and
have.

2351
01:45:15,730 --> 01:45:16,580
Yeah,
that would be cool.

2352
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:19,880
Take over that aspect of it.
Yes,

2353
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:22,460
that would be cool.
The only thing that we are,

2354
01:45:22,461 --> 01:45:26,480
is we try to be really protective of the
big means.

2355
01:45:26,570 --> 01:45:29,150
Um,
and because uh,

2356
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:31,560
kind of bringing in a lot of outsiders,
um,

2357
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:36,170
most outsiders that visit them,
that's not a good experience.

2358
01:45:36,171 --> 01:45:38,240
And so just bringing a lot of random
people,

2359
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:41,060
if it was a couple of people that really
highly skilled,

2360
01:45:41,061 --> 01:45:44,000
had the right hearts,
their vision lined up with our vision of

2361
01:45:44,001 --> 01:45:47,090
how we can I do the commute development
because we want to.

2362
01:45:47,330 --> 01:45:48,530
There's,
I think there's a great book,

2363
01:45:48,531 --> 01:45:52,520
I think it's called a helping without
hurting or how to help without hurting

2364
01:45:52,521 --> 01:45:56,350
or something like that and have it and
you it to them.

2365
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:58,880
And it's,
it's really great about how you can go

2366
01:45:58,881 --> 01:46:03,881
about helping people in a way that helps
them more than helps you in a way of,

2367
01:46:04,161 --> 01:46:06,580
like,
a lot of people help because it's going

2368
01:46:06,581 --> 01:46:09,770
to make them feel warm and fuzzy and um,
and,

2369
01:46:09,930 --> 01:46:12,410
and yeah,
and you just do that enough for random

2370
01:46:12,411 --> 01:46:13,070
people.

2371
01:46:13,070 --> 01:46:15,200
But what if you can make a difference
that,

2372
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:18,050
that lasted longer and it's great to do
both.

2373
01:46:18,051 --> 01:46:19,340
Right?
It's great to do both.

2374
01:46:20,270 --> 01:46:24,080
I actually love my.
See someone else do some random act of

2375
01:46:24,081 --> 01:46:24,930
kindness.
Like it,

2376
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,210
it warms my heart.
I love it.

2377
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:31,720
But how can we help in a way that,
that really changes the game of,

2378
01:46:32,590 --> 01:46:34,330
of things there?
Well,

2379
01:46:34,440 --> 01:46:36,260
I think you definitely already doing
that.

2380
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,060
I mean,
you're certainly spreading it.

2381
01:46:38,180 --> 01:46:42,090
I think you feel like it's a long job
and your job is not nearly done button.

2382
01:46:42,120 --> 01:46:45,500
I don't think it ever ever will be.
Oh well for water.

2383
01:46:45,501 --> 01:46:47,240
I,
I've definitely hope for that.

2384
01:46:47,241 --> 01:46:48,320
But then,
I don't know,

2385
01:46:48,321 --> 01:46:51,750
I think I just feel,
I don't know,

2386
01:46:51,810 --> 01:46:54,840
whenever he was it,
when you have that heart connection,

2387
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:55,920
it's kind of like,
well,

2388
01:46:56,190 --> 01:46:59,240
I want to see these people if they have,
if they have everything I got to like,

2389
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:02,310
I still want to hang out with them all I
can of course.

2390
01:47:02,340 --> 01:47:03,140
But,
um,

2391
01:47:03,140 --> 01:47:03,931
no,
you know what though?

2392
01:47:03,931 --> 01:47:06,060
It's been really cool to see.
Um,

2393
01:47:06,480 --> 01:47:11,480
so there's these guys from Uganda that
came in and helped train us in there

2394
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:15,270
called young men drillers.
And there were these guys that were,

2395
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:19,050
you've heard of the LRA and Joseph Kony
and different stuff like that.

2396
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:23,340
One of the guys was,
he told me around a campfire that he was

2397
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:28,380
one of two.
It might've been three survivors of a

2398
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:28,950
three,
four,

2399
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:31,590
500 person village.
The railroads came in,

2400
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:33,180
killed everybody.
He barely escaped.

2401
01:47:33,270 --> 01:47:35,670
And um,
then another kid and another kid.

2402
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:41,320
And it's so cool to see these young guys
all of a sudden stand up in water for,

2403
01:47:41,371 --> 01:47:44,610
got involved with them and train them up
on how to drill wells in their own

2404
01:47:44,611 --> 01:47:45,720
country.
And these are,

2405
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,390
when I say young men drillers,
like I think someone were 16,

2406
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:49,770
17,
18 when they started,

2407
01:47:50,220 --> 01:47:53,700
well then all of a sudden they cranked
out over 100 water wells over 100 water

2408
01:47:53,701 --> 01:47:54,240
wells.

2409
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:55,410
They've been doing it longer than we
have.

2410
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:57,810
We haven't done any.
I'm in the Congo.

2411
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:01,830
We try to get them out to us to help
matt comes in to train us and to

2412
01:48:01,860 --> 01:48:04,230
continue training with them.
And then they were going to leave that

2413
01:48:04,231 --> 01:48:06,470
team.
You've got the main three guys from him,

2414
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:11,220
the drillers behind to train us to
invest and impart their knowledge and

2415
01:48:11,221 --> 01:48:12,210
us,
uh,

2416
01:48:12,480 --> 01:48:16,020
Matt was doing real intensive training
and then these guys are going to stick

2417
01:48:16,021 --> 01:48:18,300
around for the next three months,
make sure we could bust out,

2418
01:48:18,600 --> 01:48:19,410
you know,
a,

2419
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:22,500
a few wells and do it the right way.
And so it's so cool.

2420
01:48:22,501 --> 01:48:25,950
They came and stayed with us and so cool
to see what they've gone through all

2421
01:48:25,951 --> 01:48:30,951
that where one of the guys,
it was probably every other night or

2422
01:48:31,081 --> 01:48:34,490
every three nights,
he's waking up in night terrors where he

2423
01:48:34,491 --> 01:48:35,910
is just screaming.

2424
01:48:35,910 --> 01:48:38,150
And I had never been around that before,
um,

2425
01:48:38,151 --> 01:48:41,040
but the things he saw,
things he's been through are just so

2426
01:48:41,041 --> 01:48:44,470
tough.
But then to see he chose that he's going

2427
01:48:44,471 --> 01:48:46,260
to take a different path.
He's gonna,

2428
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:48,480
he's gonna,
he's gonna find something that you can

2429
01:48:48,481 --> 01:48:50,940
help people with in these,
going to give it to others in a

2430
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:54,450
different country in Congo.
So they came and lived with pygmies for

2431
01:48:54,451 --> 01:48:56,220
three years or three months.
It was awesome.

2432
01:48:56,520 --> 01:49:01,260
Now a ben and a couple of our other
drillers are in Cameroon.

2433
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:03,060
Um,
and I,

2434
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:06,000
I kinda had this thing that I haven't
really spoken out,

2435
01:49:06,001 --> 01:49:09,450
but I would love to see the piggies and
Congo.

2436
01:49:09,500 --> 01:49:11,490
I'll have water.
But then after that,

2437
01:49:11,730 --> 01:49:14,430
you know,
the other pygmies are suffering in very

2438
01:49:14,431 --> 01:49:18,270
similar ways to the pygmies and Congo.
And so what's so cool is that,

2439
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:19,890
okay,
the young men drillers comes out,

2440
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:22,260
invest in us,
pours their hearts lives.

2441
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:24,330
They almost died.
Come in to us.

2442
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:26,490
Their car flipped,
ran over a lady,

2443
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:28,650
a taxi driver was driving and he ran
away.

2444
01:49:29,040 --> 01:49:30,960
She died.
Oh fuck.

2445
01:49:30,990 --> 01:49:32,910
They ran over a lady.
No,

2446
01:49:32,911 --> 01:49:34,140
they didn't.
The cab driver,

2447
01:49:34,141 --> 01:49:36,420
cab driver did and he bailed.
He,

2448
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,240
he was from Congo,
they were from Uganda and at the border

2449
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:41,700
they had to get in with a Congolese taxi
driver,

2450
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,120
who will they do that?
They couldn't even speak the same

2451
01:49:45,121 --> 01:49:47,470
language and he gets in a wreck.
He knows Congo,

2452
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:49,480
he does that drive all the time to the
border.

2453
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:54,040
And so he just bales in literally the
people in a place called a new yoga,

2454
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:59,010
which means a snake.
And it was a place of a rebel group that

2455
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:01,090
used to be there and everything.
And so was very,

2456
01:50:01,091 --> 01:50:04,300
very bad part of town.
There's gold mines on both sides of him.

2457
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,870
Luckily this lady took them in and held
him in there and called,

2458
01:50:07,871 --> 01:50:10,540
uh,
the military because people literally

2459
01:50:10,541 --> 01:50:13,210
had an ad whenever the not the military
about the cops.

2460
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,010
And it was just a little shack.
I mean,

2461
01:50:15,030 --> 01:50:15,410
he was like,
well,

2462
01:50:15,410 --> 01:50:17,860
people are going to kill them because
they thought that she had killed a

2463
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:18,670
woman.
Yes.

2464
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:21,970
And it in there.
It doesn't matter if you know you're

2465
01:50:21,971 --> 01:50:24,490
guilty and we'll ask questions later
and,

2466
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:26,320
uh,
someone,

2467
01:50:26,350 --> 01:50:28,990
it's mob justice.
Someone's got to pay if this person was

2468
01:50:28,991 --> 01:50:31,090
just hurt somebody,
even if you weren't driving,

2469
01:50:31,091 --> 01:50:33,850
even if you were one of our guys was
thrown from the vehicle,

2470
01:50:33,851 --> 01:50:37,720
the car went,
rolled and running away fearing for

2471
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:39,540
their lives.
They had a,

2472
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:43,720
I think $15,000 of well drilling
equipment and the trunk plus they had a,

2473
01:50:43,721 --> 01:50:48,721
uh,
a solar pump solar filter and it did

2474
01:50:49,001 --> 01:50:50,740
like 400 gallons of water a day.

2475
01:50:51,290 --> 01:50:52,440
And,
or foreign leaders,

2476
01:50:52,441 --> 01:50:55,410
a hundred gallons.
And anyways,

2477
01:50:55,510 --> 01:50:58,300
they looted the,
I think they set the car on fire.

2478
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:01,150
I know they alluded it,
but then at the police station,

2479
01:51:01,151 --> 01:51:05,080
little shack people outside hadn't
shetty's a literal torches.

2480
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:07,740
I like those hoes that,
uh,

2481
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:11,890
for farming and wants to have o tires,
they're going to put tires around them

2482
01:51:11,891 --> 01:51:13,810
and set them on fire.
Oh God.

2483
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:18,840
And so luckily I'm me and I
very luckily his miracle had a that papa

2484
01:51:22,061 --> 01:51:23,880
why is such a great,
uh,

2485
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,610
like an old piece of peacekeeper.
Like he can go somewhere and talk with

2486
01:51:27,611 --> 01:51:31,510
him when that 70 dispute and bring them
some sort of agreement and he was able

2487
01:51:31,511 --> 01:51:35,260
to go out there on behalf of Blur Uganda
guys doesn't even really know him yet.

2488
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,530
Gets them out and while they're leaving
pop wise,

2489
01:51:38,531 --> 01:51:40,180
really respected because of,
uh,

2490
01:51:40,300 --> 01:51:40,720
you know,
he,

2491
01:51:40,720 --> 01:51:42,640
he's actually helping people in their
country.

2492
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:44,530
They like,
people know him when he's walking around

2493
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:45,364
because he's like,
oh,

2494
01:51:45,640 --> 01:51:48,100
those are the,
that's the crew that's actually putting

2495
01:51:48,220 --> 01:51:51,970
what they're learning and action.
And so he went up there and as they're

2496
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:54,070
getting ready to leave.
So we came up to him and whispered to

2497
01:51:54,071 --> 01:51:55,310
him and says,
uh,

2498
01:51:55,390 --> 01:51:58,840
we know where all your stuff is.
And he's like,

2499
01:51:58,841 --> 01:52:00,280
what?
Like everything that was stolen.

2500
01:52:01,240 --> 01:52:03,730
He's like,
I think it was something like he said it

2501
01:52:03,731 --> 01:52:07,750
to him there or later,
why they didn't keep it and why they

2502
01:52:07,751 --> 01:52:09,880
gave it back.
But whenever they got there,

2503
01:52:09,940 --> 01:52:11,710
it was a,
the case,

2504
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:15,450
they've broken the lock,
opened it up and uh,

2505
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,650
was Oh,
one other,

2506
01:52:16,660 --> 01:52:19,240
they open up that solar pump has got
these two different.

2507
01:52:19,241 --> 01:52:20,560
Uh,
Oh man,

2508
01:52:20,890 --> 01:52:23,660
it was more words but canisters on it
and it,

2509
01:52:23,790 --> 01:52:27,370
and they left it because they thought it
was a pump and so they left that and all

2510
01:52:27,371 --> 01:52:30,250
our wells drilling equipment and we were
able to reclaim everything,

2511
01:52:30,310 --> 01:52:31,030
get them to us.

2512
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:32,680
They lived with us for three months,
then,

2513
01:52:32,690 --> 01:52:36,250
uh,
there supply chain from Uganda to Congo.

2514
01:52:37,170 --> 01:52:41,350
Now wrap this up where it's so cool to
see where now I'm no joke.

2515
01:52:41,351 --> 01:52:44,950
The guys that came out to learn from
Cameroon that work with the pygmies in

2516
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,900
Cameroon are named a willy and turbo was
their,

2517
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:50,780
their,
their names from Cameroon.

2518
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:52,370
And uh,
actually that,

2519
01:52:52,470 --> 01:52:54,800
that uh,
that big heavyweight,

2520
01:52:54,890 --> 01:52:58,130
um,
what is his name in the UFC now?

2521
01:52:58,340 --> 01:53:00,560
A Francis and Francis.
Yeah.

2522
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:05,330
Now he's him in check Congo.
Both check on was from Congo,

2523
01:53:06,050 --> 01:53:07,580
I believe.
I'm not sure which one he is from.

2524
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:11,990
God knows huge dude.
He is fucking you beast.

2525
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:15,380
Just a scary guy man.
And both those guys ended up in France

2526
01:53:15,381 --> 01:53:19,370
because
the French speaking countries,

2527
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:22,430
both Congo in Cameroon.
And so it's just cool to see how,

2528
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:27,670
how the trickle effect comes from these
guys that are lucky to be alive then

2529
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:30,410
from growing up,
then they're lucky to be alive,

2530
01:53:30,411 --> 01:53:31,430
coming to help us.

2531
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:35,570
Then they decide to stay in the country
that they're were almost murdered in for

2532
01:53:35,571 --> 01:53:40,370
an extra three months so that we get it
down to where we really know what we're

2533
01:53:40,371 --> 01:53:43,550
doing and then they can go back and we
have this great relationship,

2534
01:53:43,760 --> 01:53:45,800
but now another can come and learn from
us.

2535
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:49,610
And now we're sending our team out to
different parts of the continent to

2536
01:53:49,670 --> 01:53:54,670
Rwanda to Kenyetta Cameroon to um,
I think Rwanda,

2537
01:53:55,980 --> 01:54:00,350
Uganda in training up these other teams
have that are wanting to have a desire

2538
01:54:00,620 --> 01:54:01,500
to,
uh,

2539
01:54:02,660 --> 01:54:04,020
to do the same thing.
The,

2540
01:54:04,250 --> 01:54:05,880
a crazy story,
man.

2541
01:54:06,030 --> 01:54:06,950
They're so lucky.

2542
01:54:09,020 --> 01:54:11,480
They'll stick them and tires and light
them on fire.

2543
01:54:11,481 --> 01:54:12,314
Yeah.
I saw a guy,

2544
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:17,870
ben and I both saw guy beat to death
because they called him a thief.

2545
01:54:18,220 --> 01:54:19,710
And then rumors were that,
uh,

2546
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:23,240
we were kind of far away.
I try to get up Kinda,

2547
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:25,160
Kinda too scary.
Close bins.

2548
01:54:25,170 --> 01:54:27,320
Literally pull my shirt away because I'm
seeing this,

2549
01:54:28,010 --> 01:54:31,220
know who he is and he's getting beaten
and kicked and most of their stuff.

2550
01:54:31,230 --> 01:54:32,460
But Ben's like,
effort,

2551
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:33,740
we gotta go,
we gotta go.

2552
01:54:33,860 --> 01:54:38,810
And so he pulled me away and then when
we came back later I couldn't even bend

2553
01:54:38,811 --> 01:54:41,180
my body like that.
Like it's like a contortionist kind of

2554
01:54:41,181 --> 01:54:44,030
thing where it was like bent up like a
pretzel and just laying there.

2555
01:54:44,031 --> 01:54:48,110
And supposedly the rumor was that just
some drunk guys started,

2556
01:54:48,120 --> 01:54:50,930
rumor called him a thief,
called him a thief and when someone says

2557
01:54:50,931 --> 01:54:53,200
thief,
they pounce on the thief.

2558
01:54:54,200 --> 01:54:57,770
And so sometimes it's really a thief or
whatever.

2559
01:54:57,771 --> 01:55:01,100
But then other times it's some innocent
guy in,

2560
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:02,443
you know,
they can.

2561
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:04,380
Crazy stuff can happen.
Yeah.

2562
01:55:04,400 --> 01:55:05,810
I can only imagine.
Yeah.

2563
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:08,360
And uh,
but it's,

2564
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:10,220
you've seen some shit,
dude,

2565
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:11,570
man,
it's been a,

2566
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:13,940
it's been different,
but I wouldn't change it.

2567
01:55:13,941 --> 01:55:15,020
It's,
it's beyond.

2568
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,930
It literally is wild.
Like I couldn't,

2569
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:20,053
I couldn't,
uh,

2570
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:23,090
I couldn't have dreamed it up for
myself.

2571
01:55:23,091 --> 01:55:24,670
And what's,
what's kind of funny as them,

2572
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,990
I think,
not funny.

2573
01:55:26,991 --> 01:55:29,270
It's actually a.
have you ever heard of,

2574
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:33,490
I think it's a book called what?
They don't teach you at Harvard law.

2575
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:36,290
What they don't teach you at Harvard
business or something like that?

2576
01:55:36,460 --> 01:55:38,180
No,
I think the author's name is mark.

2577
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:41,930
Well,
he did some pretty incredible and I

2578
01:55:41,931 --> 01:55:43,500
heard,
I heard about it when I was high school,

2579
01:55:43,890 --> 01:55:46,950
but Kenny Monday,
which he got the,

2580
01:55:46,960 --> 01:55:47,970
it came full circle.

2581
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,180
He coached me in high school then for my
comeback fight and he coached me a

2582
01:55:51,181 --> 01:55:54,420
little bit in mma at the beginning.
But then for my comeback fight and this

2583
01:55:54,421 --> 01:55:56,800
last one he was in my corner.
Um,

2584
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:57,780
but anyways,
he told me,

2585
01:55:57,810 --> 01:55:58,231
you know,
hey,

2586
01:55:58,231 --> 01:55:59,970
if you want to wrestle,
go home,

2587
01:55:59,971 --> 01:56:03,810
write down your goals.
Like write them down in this book talks

2588
01:56:03,811 --> 01:56:08,811
about how if they polled some class,
some senior class in at Harvard and

2589
01:56:11,461 --> 01:56:16,170
asked who has goals that are,
who knows their goals and some like 87

2590
01:56:16,171 --> 01:56:20,250
percent didn't know,
like besides I'll get my college degree

2591
01:56:20,251 --> 01:56:21,750
from Harvard and then I'll figure it
out.

2592
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:23,910
Then they asked,
who knows,

2593
01:56:23,940 --> 01:56:25,280
who knows?
Your um,

2594
01:56:25,440 --> 01:56:29,490
I think that was 87 percent of them or
something like that and then a or 83

2595
01:56:29,491 --> 01:56:32,790
percent something and um,
then it was,

2596
01:56:33,210 --> 01:56:38,210
it was a 13 percent or something like
that where they had,

2597
01:56:38,311 --> 01:56:40,050
um,
I'm sorry I'm screwing this up,

2598
01:56:40,051 --> 01:56:41,850
but it was a,
they,

2599
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,070
it's an incredible stat.

2600
01:56:44,310 --> 01:56:48,150
It's so 87 or 83 percent didn't know
their goals.

2601
01:56:48,690 --> 01:56:50,790
Thirteen or 17 percent did know their
goals,

2602
01:56:50,791 --> 01:56:54,270
but they didn't have them written down
and then only three percent of the class

2603
01:56:54,510 --> 01:56:57,720
had written concise,
direct goals of what they wanted to do

2604
01:56:57,721 --> 01:57:00,390
in their life.
I think if you went back 10 years later

2605
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:03,600
and the ones that had goals but didn't
have them written down,

2606
01:57:03,780 --> 01:57:08,610
were making twice as much on average
than all the other 83 or 87 percent that

2607
01:57:08,700 --> 01:57:11,070
didn't have goals.
And then the people had written down

2608
01:57:11,071 --> 01:57:13,200
goals.
They're making 10 percent,

2609
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:14,153
10 times.
Yeah,

2610
01:57:14,190 --> 01:57:16,320
10 times as all the other 97 combined

2611
01:57:16,630 --> 01:57:20,250
here is why three percent of Harvard
Mbas make 10 times as much as the other.

2612
01:57:20,251 --> 01:57:23,670
Ninety seven.
Sarika behind Harvard Mba program is

2613
01:57:23,671 --> 01:57:26,580
extremely competitive.
And today admits approximately 15

2614
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:30,600
percent of the applicants and 19 sixties
acceptance rate was about 30 percent

2615
01:57:30,601 --> 01:57:35,400
down to 25 percent in the 19 seventies,
fluctuated between 10 and 15 percent

2616
01:57:35,401 --> 01:57:37,710
ever since.
Students who make it past the

2617
01:57:37,711 --> 01:57:41,460
application process are typically
standouts and already fairly successful

2618
01:57:41,461 --> 01:57:45,030
by most traditional definitions.
They have an undergraduate degree,

2619
01:57:45,031 --> 01:57:48,660
typically three to five years of working
experience hold on,

2620
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,120
uh,
and when considered suitable for

2621
01:57:51,121 --> 01:57:53,520
acceptance into the Harvard business
school,

2622
01:57:53,521 --> 01:57:53,881
blah,
blah,

2623
01:57:53,881 --> 01:57:54,181
blah,
blah,

2624
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:56,430
blah.
So,

2625
01:57:56,730 --> 01:57:58,770
okay,
so it's explaining about writing your

2626
01:57:58,771 --> 01:58:02,160
goals down and having a clear direction.
Make sense

2627
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:03,133
in,
in,

2628
01:58:03,380 --> 01:58:04,620
um,
for,

2629
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,020
for me in seeing that,
hearing that.

2630
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:12,440
And then having coach Monday tell me
that I'm honestly wrestling MMA,

2631
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:16,260
having goal to focus on having a gold
write down.

2632
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:20,670
Um,
I think that really helped me escape the

2633
01:58:20,671 --> 01:58:24,510
depression for her for a while,
for a few years because now I found

2634
01:58:24,511 --> 01:58:26,630
something that I could focus on and I
was passionate about it could,

2635
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:28,110
you know,
that was my outlet.

2636
01:58:28,680 --> 01:58:31,620
And um,
but he also told me one step further,

2637
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:34,290
think of said this publicly,
publicly.

2638
01:58:34,380 --> 01:58:35,213
But,
um,

2639
01:58:35,460 --> 01:58:38,630
he told me write down be what's your
goal,

2640
01:58:38,631 --> 01:58:39,870
and like,
I want to be a state champion.

2641
01:58:40,770 --> 01:58:41,620
And he said,
okay,

2642
01:58:41,621 --> 01:58:44,020
go home,
write that down and put it somewhere.

2643
01:58:44,021 --> 01:58:45,610
You can see it either on your,
you know,

2644
01:58:45,640 --> 01:58:49,210
your bathroom mirror or somewhere.
I put it above my bed.

2645
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:51,910
Um,
but I didn't ever write down state

2646
01:58:51,911 --> 01:58:54,920
champion Rodeo national champion,
sir.

2647
01:58:54,950 --> 01:58:56,530
Working towards it was state champion
that year,

2648
01:58:56,531 --> 01:58:59,740
the next having a great,
great training partner and I'm,

2649
01:58:59,760 --> 01:59:02,860
I'm kind of jazzed up that the Olympics
has coming up into some guys that are

2650
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:04,720
going.
Robby Smith,

2651
01:59:04,721 --> 01:59:06,610
he's a heavyweight.
He was my roommate at the Olympic

2652
01:59:06,611 --> 01:59:10,960
training center and travail lag if we
wrestled together and high school and

2653
01:59:10,961 --> 01:59:14,290
then after and um,
so I'm pumped about it.

2654
01:59:14,291 --> 01:59:16,300
But cds,
guys obtaining their goals,

2655
01:59:16,301 --> 01:59:20,530
their dreams and writing them down,
we'll then with coach money's like,

2656
01:59:20,531 --> 01:59:22,420
Hey,
get some of your favorite wrestling

2657
01:59:22,421 --> 01:59:25,100
moves,
some pictures so you can visualize and I

2658
01:59:25,101 --> 01:59:27,940
just see the words,
but see the actual thing that you want

2659
01:59:27,941 --> 01:59:28,900
to do,
like see it.

2660
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:33,580
And so I went and I put one wrestling
move on the left and another on the

2661
01:59:33,581 --> 01:59:35,980
right and uh,
and man,

2662
01:59:35,981 --> 01:59:40,981
I just would go to sleep dreaming about
it basically in wake up motivated to,

2663
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:46,390
to attain that goal national champion
and having a guy that's Olympic gold

2664
01:59:46,391 --> 01:59:48,660
medalist teaching you the basics like
you,

2665
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:50,290
you'll get good quick that way.

2666
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:55,270
But I'm also having the goals like I was
the first national championship I won,

2667
01:59:55,740 --> 01:59:58,180
um,
was with a move on the left and the

2668
01:59:58,181 --> 02:00:00,640
second national championship was with
move on the right.

2669
02:00:00,910 --> 02:00:02,830
Um,
and it was just,

2670
02:00:02,860 --> 02:00:04,510
it was nuts to see how all that works
out.

2671
02:00:04,511 --> 02:00:06,370
And looking back on this book and seeing
like,

2672
02:00:06,371 --> 02:00:09,240
man,
you gotta write down and I,

2673
02:00:09,241 --> 02:00:12,460
I need to update that now.
I've been working on it everything else.

2674
02:00:12,461 --> 02:00:13,810
But uh,
I think a lot of us do.

2675
02:00:14,140 --> 02:00:16,570
Yeah.
I think focusing on one individual goal

2676
02:00:16,571 --> 02:00:19,660
like that or writing something down,
having a very clear thing that you're

2677
02:00:19,661 --> 02:00:22,390
working towards.
It takes away a lot of the ambiguity

2678
02:00:22,391 --> 02:00:25,630
about that people have about wanting to
be successful.

2679
02:00:26,500 --> 02:00:29,110
And I'll just wanting to be successful,
just wanting to do well,

2680
02:00:29,290 --> 02:00:31,060
that's not enough.
You have to have like a real,

2681
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,210
like something that you're looking
towards something you're moving and

2682
02:00:34,211 --> 02:00:35,980
working towards a plan and initiative.

2683
02:00:35,980 --> 02:00:39,280
And yet,
well that's probably one of the biggest

2684
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:44,070
strengths that our team has.
Has had a,

2685
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:46,600
the 18 employees we have,
um,

2686
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:51,030
and at water four we write down what we
want to do and it's so cool.

2687
02:00:51,700 --> 02:00:53,850
When I came on the show the first time,
um,

2688
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:58,750
I had gone in,
I'd only experienced the terrible stuff,

2689
02:00:58,780 --> 02:01:03,700
like nothing had happened yet.
I'm only corruption and me holding the

2690
02:01:03,701 --> 02:01:07,080
little guy that died and all this just
brutal stuff on.

2691
02:01:07,081 --> 02:01:08,950
But it came back and I finally was like,
okay,

2692
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:12,940
I can't say no anymore.
I got to do something.

2693
02:01:13,060 --> 02:01:16,660
And so let's just write it down and do
it and start speaking about it and

2694
02:01:16,661 --> 02:01:19,330
thrown it out there.
And then to see the other team.

2695
02:01:19,331 --> 02:01:20,890
Like they,
they're coming in with,

2696
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:22,390
uh,
with the real,

2697
02:01:22,420 --> 02:01:24,190
like,
here's The big vision stuff.

2698
02:01:24,400 --> 02:01:26,740
But here's filling in all the details,
how we're going to get it done.

2699
02:01:27,310 --> 02:01:29,560
And me and my,
my first time to write things down was

2700
02:01:29,590 --> 02:01:34,030
one water,
well on 300 acres of land and maybe we

2701
02:01:34,031 --> 02:01:38,350
could build a school and get a teacher
and they would help with education

2702
02:01:38,351 --> 02:01:41,120
because the pygmies don't have any
representation in the government because

2703
02:01:41,121 --> 02:01:43,880
nobody's educated and that's their
excuse,

2704
02:01:43,881 --> 02:01:47,300
at least in Congo what to here.
And so it was like school,

2705
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:48,650
that'd be great.
One water,

2706
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:52,370
well and 300 acres.
And now it's by the end of this year

2707
02:01:52,371 --> 02:01:55,640
will be 3000 acres of land credible.
They literally own,

2708
02:01:55,820 --> 02:01:59,480
there'll be 10 times more.
40th five wells at 45 wells.

2709
02:01:59,510 --> 02:02:01,070
That's amazing.
Teen employees.

2710
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:04,780
Um,
we've got three working farms right over

2711
02:02:04,790 --> 02:02:06,410
how long,
how many years you've been doing this

2712
02:02:06,411 --> 02:02:08,720
now?
A five.

2713
02:02:09,830 --> 02:02:11,930
That's pretty incredible.
Over five for sure.

2714
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:14,000
That's an incredible commitment.
Well,

2715
02:02:14,040 --> 02:02:15,950
thanks.
It's been a,

2716
02:02:17,390 --> 02:02:20,510
it's been awesome.
Watch even even like being able to go

2717
02:02:20,511 --> 02:02:24,950
back and had all these pictures to show
you a Leo may growing Papaya trees and

2718
02:02:24,980 --> 02:02:28,950
stand in front of banana trees and all
the different stuff in the ground on

2719
02:02:28,951 --> 02:02:30,560
what the water that they're getting from
the wells.

2720
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:32,240
Well that's the rain forest and
everything.

2721
02:02:32,241 --> 02:02:34,160
So it's,
it's pretty fertile.

2722
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,680
Yeah.
You can spit a seat on the ground.

2723
02:02:35,681 --> 02:02:38,300
That's gonna gonna Sprout up somehow in
the reinforced.

2724
02:02:38,840 --> 02:02:41,060
That's great too.
Are you bringing in seeds over there for

2725
02:02:41,061 --> 02:02:43,930
these people?
And they have,

2726
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:47,990
they have good seeds there and uh,
a lot of those trees were doing

2727
02:02:47,991 --> 02:02:50,780
seedlings and they take and they know
how to garden and farm and all that

2728
02:02:50,781 --> 02:02:51,381
stuff.
Yeah.

2729
02:02:51,381 --> 02:02:54,110
Especially at the university because
they have a whole agriculture department

2730
02:02:54,140 --> 02:02:56,750
that teams up with the community
development department that they come

2731
02:02:56,751 --> 02:02:59,780
and teach the pygmies how to do it.
They come in and teach them and then

2732
02:03:00,170 --> 02:03:02,150
they start learning how to do it for
themselves.

2733
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:06,140
And this was,
I think I can tell you two moments real

2734
02:03:06,141 --> 02:03:11,141
quick where you went back and seeing Leo
May and walking in and seeing all those

2735
02:03:12,500 --> 02:03:14,960
banana trees blew me away.

2736
02:03:14,960 --> 02:03:19,960
And then now there is just so cool
because I was leaving and there's a

2737
02:03:20,961 --> 02:03:23,170
little guy named Ipi than I've seen them
grow up.

2738
02:03:23,180 --> 02:03:25,670
I have watched them grow up and I saw
whenever his,

2739
02:03:26,690 --> 02:03:31,070
his water source was absolutely
disgusting.

2740
02:03:31,160 --> 02:03:35,810
Like you could not ever imagine a human
being drinking,

2741
02:03:36,140 --> 02:03:38,070
drinking it.
And uh,

2742
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:40,460
that was,
that was their water source where they

2743
02:03:40,461 --> 02:03:42,010
get water.
What is that?

2744
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:47,060
It's this little stagnant pond kind of
thing with all this mouse over it.

2745
02:03:47,150 --> 02:03:48,620
That's.
Yeah.

2746
02:03:48,621 --> 02:03:51,260
Now what's so cool?
Just picture green.

2747
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:51,930
Yeah.
No,

2748
02:03:51,930 --> 02:03:54,200
it's like water at all.
There's definitely,

2749
02:03:54,240 --> 02:03:55,310
it's a big,
thick thing.

2750
02:03:55,311 --> 02:03:57,770
So they'll get a stick and they'll push
them to sell us to Jamie.

2751
02:03:57,830 --> 02:03:59,270
This photo,
that's what I had.

2752
02:03:59,271 --> 02:04:04,271
And then it all lost on.
What do other people could say?

2753
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:07,990
Oh,
I see.

2754
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:09,410
Oh,
how's that working?

2755
02:04:10,220 --> 02:04:11,900
That's ridiculous.
What is it?

2756
02:04:12,010 --> 02:04:13,010
What,
what is wrong with the,

2757
02:04:13,011 --> 02:04:14,510
uh,
connection to you?

2758
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:19,310
It didn't
because everything crashed on me.

2759
02:04:19,311 --> 02:04:19,990
I had,
dude,

2760
02:04:19,990 --> 02:04:24,650
I didn't even sleep last night at all,
zero because I was trying to send videos

2761
02:04:25,370 --> 02:04:29,480
to water for an update video and he was
at a hotel.

2762
02:04:29,490 --> 02:04:33,140
It was a little roach motel,
but it took like two hours and send one

2763
02:04:33,141 --> 02:04:35,360
video.
Then I have to do another and then all

2764
02:04:35,361 --> 02:04:36,290
of a sudden it,
uh,

2765
02:04:36,590 --> 02:04:39,030
it just,
I've lost the powerpoint that went back

2766
02:04:39,031 --> 02:04:39,570
to.
Well,

2767
02:04:39,570 --> 02:04:42,450
speaking of videos,
let's watch the video that you said

2768
02:04:42,490 --> 02:04:43,980
[inaudible] did for you.
Yeah,

2769
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:44,730
yeah,
that'd be great.

2770
02:04:44,730 --> 02:04:46,410
Let's watch that.
I want to see that.

2771
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:49,230
What is this?
What I'm looking at right here?

2772
02:04:49,650 --> 02:04:50,483
That's,
uh,

2773
02:04:50,830 --> 02:04:51,370
we're,
we're,

2774
02:04:51,370 --> 02:04:53,040
we're,
we drilled one of the new wells.

2775
02:04:53,400 --> 02:04:55,230
What is those things in their hands?
Uh,

2776
02:04:55,231 --> 02:04:56,380
jerry cans.
They're filling.

2777
02:04:56,381 --> 02:04:57,270
Oh,
oh,

2778
02:04:57,271 --> 02:04:58,104
I see.
Okay.

2779
02:05:00,180 --> 02:05:01,170
In fact,
okay,

2780
02:05:01,171 --> 02:05:03,140
so let's play this foundations.

2781
02:05:08,520 --> 02:05:12,570
Justin wren versus Josh Barnes.
This story of that fight was the time

2782
02:05:12,571 --> 02:05:17,040
off of a very talented fighter.
It been away from the sport for years.

2783
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:19,380
One of those guys,
when he was active,

2784
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:21,870
when he was at his peak,
was considered one of the hottest

2785
02:05:21,871 --> 02:05:24,300
prospects in the heavyweight division,
talented wrestler,

2786
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:25,730
aggressive,
well rounded,

2787
02:05:25,810 --> 02:05:30,100
welcome
at the time off the ring,

2788
02:05:30,101 --> 02:05:32,050
rust,
the time away from the sport against

2789
02:05:32,051 --> 02:05:34,390
Josh Burns,
a guy who traditionally wasn't a very

2790
02:05:34,391 --> 02:05:37,360
fast starter.
We thought he'd have time to warm up and

2791
02:05:37,361 --> 02:05:38,440
he did.
Burns,

2792
02:05:38,441 --> 02:05:40,690
came right after him.
A Guy I think was trying to take

2793
02:05:40,691 --> 02:05:44,310
advantage of the fact that rent had been
off for so long ran,

2794
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:48,310
handled it extremely well.
Rent had been away for a long time,

2795
02:05:48,311 --> 02:05:51,050
so you could see the surprise.
You could see the fatigue,

2796
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:55,000
you could see the question of himself.
You could see those times when things

2797
02:05:55,001 --> 02:05:56,720
started working out and it started
coming back.

2798
02:05:59,020 --> 02:06:03,100
The story of all his time off was on his
face and his in his performance.

2799
02:06:03,120 --> 02:06:07,660
Yeah,
that's the guy making up for time off in

2800
02:06:07,661 --> 02:06:11,200
one fight.
What's easy to forget with Justin wren

2801
02:06:11,201 --> 02:06:15,700
story with him helping out the pygmies
with all he's done socially,

2802
02:06:15,850 --> 02:06:18,190
all he's done politically for that
tribe.

2803
02:06:18,290 --> 02:06:23,290
They can't go in there with me and the
pressure of having a big story on your

2804
02:06:24,941 --> 02:06:26,770
shoulders,
everybody rooting for you,

2805
02:06:26,840 --> 02:06:30,130
everybody reading your book,
that's not easy thing to carry into a

2806
02:06:30,131 --> 02:06:32,920
fight.
Every talks about how great the story is

2807
02:06:32,921 --> 02:06:35,020
and what it does for a fighter and what
it does for their career.

2808
02:06:35,380 --> 02:06:39,970
It's also a gigantic burden and not just
fighting for yourself anymore.

2809
02:06:40,330 --> 02:06:42,310
You're fighting for everyone who looks
up to you.

2810
02:06:42,460 --> 02:06:45,220
Winning that night was a big deal for
him.

2811
02:06:45,280 --> 02:06:46,870
People don't understand what he was
carrying.

2812
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:51,070
He was carrying ring Ross and he was
carrying the hopes and dreams of

2813
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:53,200
everybody.
He was fighting for it and he managed

2814
02:06:53,201 --> 02:06:58,200
it.
One

2815
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:01,680
slash 27 real quick and pause it.
Just one minute,

2816
02:07:01,681 --> 02:07:05,200
27 seconds because I just,
it's great.

2817
02:07:05,290 --> 02:07:06,540
It's right there.
So,

2818
02:07:06,541 --> 02:07:09,330
uh,
the girls on the left through the cage,

2819
02:07:09,680 --> 02:07:10,770
this is the only time that's ever
happened.

2820
02:07:10,771 --> 02:07:13,380
That's my wife.
This is her first fight of mine to ever

2821
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:16,380
go to or see.
And we've been together for four or five

2822
02:07:16,381 --> 02:07:17,890
years.
And um,

2823
02:07:18,420 --> 02:07:22,200
it's so funny because I was throwing the
knees right here and this is the ring

2824
02:07:22,201 --> 02:07:24,530
road.
The Dominick Cruz can say it's a,

2825
02:07:24,531 --> 02:07:25,770
it's,
there's not ring rust.

2826
02:07:25,771 --> 02:07:30,771
He's just way too mentally tough and uh,
and stubborn and he's away come the

2827
02:07:30,990 --> 02:07:32,610
awesome competitor.
But a dude,

2828
02:07:32,630 --> 02:07:33,210
I,
well,

2829
02:07:33,210 --> 02:07:37,090
one I didn't train like I really should
have turned that had a big factor.

2830
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:37,691
Yeah.
And two,

2831
02:07:37,691 --> 02:07:40,800
it was a minute,
but one of the ring rust kind of things

2832
02:07:40,810 --> 02:07:41,643
was,
um,

2833
02:07:42,130 --> 02:07:44,230
I could hear the commentators and I
could,

2834
02:07:44,980 --> 02:07:49,000
I looked out,
the first person I see is my wife and I

2835
02:07:49,001 --> 02:07:53,110
see her make eye contact with her,
like we stared into each other's eyes

2836
02:07:53,410 --> 02:07:55,180
and I know this is gonna sound goofy.

2837
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:57,640
But uh,
she got a new outfit on and I'm just

2838
02:07:57,641 --> 02:07:58,840
like,
she's beautiful.

2839
02:07:59,170 --> 02:08:00,670
And then all the sudden I see her and
she's like,

2840
02:08:01,150 --> 02:08:03,250
oh,
I'm going to fight.

2841
02:08:03,251 --> 02:08:04,540
And he was like punching me and I was
like,

2842
02:08:04,780 --> 02:08:05,613
ah,
crap.

2843
02:08:05,710 --> 02:08:06,543
So,
uh,

2844
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:08,260
no,
it was actually right.

2845
02:08:08,261 --> 02:08:12,130
There was the closest part where I
almost finished them there with some

2846
02:08:12,250 --> 02:08:13,600
knees are Coulda,
Shoulda,

2847
02:08:13,630 --> 02:08:14,680
woulda.
And,

2848
02:08:14,681 --> 02:08:16,720
um,
and then I stopped looking at it,

2849
02:08:16,721 --> 02:08:20,320
my wife see her and grace,
which he came to Congo with us too.

2850
02:08:20,800 --> 02:08:22,330
And uh,
I see them and I'm like,

2851
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:25,480
what am I doing after the fight,
I instantly thought what was I doing in

2852
02:08:25,481 --> 02:08:28,180
the fight looking out,
seeing my wife and thinking she's

2853
02:08:28,181 --> 02:08:30,100
beautiful.
So,

2854
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:31,690
uh,
I don't know why I brought that up

2855
02:08:31,691 --> 02:08:33,730
except for this,
you know what I mean?

2856
02:08:33,731 --> 02:08:35,230
It was,
it was unique.

2857
02:08:35,350 --> 02:08:37,060
And um,
it was,

2858
02:08:37,061 --> 02:08:39,550
uh,
it was a blessing in that video actually

2859
02:08:39,551 --> 02:08:40,384
was,
uh,

2860
02:08:40,900 --> 02:08:42,190
I'm,
I'm glad to show it because of that.

2861
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:43,023
But then,
um,

2862
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:45,280
I meant to show you the one that came
first,

2863
02:08:45,281 --> 02:08:46,360
which,
um,

2864
02:08:46,990 --> 02:08:50,380
we don't play that.
But what happened for the first flight

2865
02:08:50,381 --> 02:08:51,910
back,
which just kind of nuts that,

2866
02:08:51,911 --> 02:08:54,550
um,
those guys,

2867
02:08:54,610 --> 02:08:58,120
the guys surprise me and called me in
the morning and I was able to see them

2868
02:08:58,121 --> 02:08:59,860
and they were able to encourage me for
the fight and say,

2869
02:08:59,861 --> 02:09:00,071
well,
no,

2870
02:09:00,071 --> 02:09:02,860
you're fighting for us.
All that is really great than emily sent

2871
02:09:02,861 --> 02:09:05,530
me a picture of her with.
It's so awesome.

2872
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:09,400
Her with like 10 or 12 kids around her
and they all had the biggest smiles.

2873
02:09:09,580 --> 02:09:10,540
She says,
remember,

2874
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:17,080
remember who you fight for and Wifi.
And so a lot of pressure.

2875
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:20,170
It is,
but at the same time she,

2876
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:21,360
she's,
she's so awesome.

2877
02:09:21,390 --> 02:09:24,220
Loves me and I've some reason I like
pressure.

2878
02:09:25,470 --> 02:09:27,300
I like to be under the gun or something
like that.

2879
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:28,570
What's next for you?
Man?

2880
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:30,520
Man,
I think um,

2881
02:09:33,310 --> 02:09:36,850
I think I just,
we just got pretty much settled into

2882
02:09:36,910 --> 02:09:41,910
Colorado and joining them and may seen
up there kind of a team take down was

2883
02:09:43,031 --> 02:09:45,700
great.
It kind of dissolved and I'm team

2884
02:09:45,701 --> 02:09:50,560
takedown dissolved.
You sort of just Johnny Hendricks left.

2885
02:09:50,561 --> 02:09:53,050
Is that what he's not on there.
But once you left,

2886
02:09:53,370 --> 02:09:56,320
yeah,
the coaches are gone.

2887
02:09:56,410 --> 02:09:58,600
Um,
that came in from out of state and that

2888
02:09:58,630 --> 02:09:59,740
was a weird situation,
right?

2889
02:09:59,741 --> 02:10:03,310
It was some wealthy guy was financing
the entire thing,

2890
02:10:03,311 --> 02:10:03,821
right.
One.

2891
02:10:03,821 --> 02:10:04,600
And he's,
he's a,

2892
02:10:04,600 --> 02:10:05,740
he's a great dude.
And then uh,

2893
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:07,960
and then he brought in a bunch of other
people.

2894
02:10:07,961 --> 02:10:11,200
But I think,
I think for them it was just a,

2895
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:14,130
I don't know,
I think they might've got burned every,

2896
02:10:14,170 --> 02:10:18,240
well they had a deal right where they
would pay guys a salary and then salary

2897
02:10:18,250 --> 02:10:20,680
require your rent,
your groceries.

2898
02:10:20,730 --> 02:10:24,190
But when you won you were supposed to
give them a percentage of your winnings.

2899
02:10:24,191 --> 02:10:25,890
I think it was 50 percent,
50,

2900
02:10:26,330 --> 02:10:28,810
50 percent.
But you get your house payment,

2901
02:10:28,811 --> 02:10:31,180
your car,
your insurance and health insurance.

2902
02:10:31,181 --> 02:10:32,230
You get your gross.
Great.

2903
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:34,880
Until fighters making,
making 10 million bucks.

2904
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:35,910
And they're like,
what?

2905
02:10:36,660 --> 02:10:37,910
Yeah,
that's very true.

2906
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:40,010
Because if they're only spending 50 or
70 years,

2907
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:41,770
who will agree to that?
To Johnny Hendricks?

2908
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:42,613
Agree to that.
Yeah.

2909
02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,900
So he was giving 50 percent of his
purse.

2910
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,930
Yeah.
I think most every team takedown guy was

2911
02:10:47,990 --> 02:10:49,340
a johnny,
might've been a little.

2912
02:10:49,341 --> 02:10:51,530
I think it might've been a little
different than everybody else's.

2913
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:53,960
Like a crazy deal.
And how much were they paying?

2914
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,530
Not Love.
I love all the guys there.

2915
02:10:55,850 --> 02:10:57,470
They're awesome dudes.
I'm,

2916
02:10:57,860 --> 02:11:02,330
I wouldn't even want to quote it,
but I know over 50,

2917
02:11:02,390 --> 02:11:04,580
maybe under $100 a year.

2918
02:11:04,750 --> 02:11:06,590
Yeah.
But uh,

2919
02:11:06,860 --> 02:11:09,650
well that's a good investment if you get
5 million bucks back,

2920
02:11:09,740 --> 02:11:10,551
that's,
that's true.

2921
02:11:10,551 --> 02:11:11,510
And,
but it was,

2922
02:11:11,511 --> 02:11:13,430
yes,
it didn't work out because when Johnny

2923
02:11:13,431 --> 02:11:14,750
started making real money,
that's when he.

2924
02:11:15,780 --> 02:11:17,390
Is that when he left or was there other
issues?

2925
02:11:17,680 --> 02:11:18,650
I think it was,
it was,

2926
02:11:18,710 --> 02:11:19,880
it was that.
And then I think,

2927
02:11:19,881 --> 02:11:22,460
uh,
I think internally there was some,

2928
02:11:22,710 --> 02:11:26,810
some butting of heads between a few
different people between me,

2929
02:11:26,870 --> 02:11:28,250
maybe coaches,
maybe management,

2930
02:11:28,251 --> 02:11:30,440
maybe fighters too.
And um,

2931
02:11:30,680 --> 02:11:32,390
so now you're in Colorado.
Now I'm in Colorado.

2932
02:11:32,570 --> 02:11:37,570
Were you trained in Colorado a while?
Be My home gym will be Grudge Training

2933
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:39,800
Center,
which is actually pretty cool.

2934
02:11:39,801 --> 02:11:42,320
There's a instructor named drew,
that's pretty great.

2935
02:11:42,430 --> 02:11:44,360
He came in,
he opened,

2936
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:46,790
I think he opened up,
maybe I'm wrong on that one,

2937
02:11:46,791 --> 02:11:50,780
but 10th planet Jiu Jitsu and I think
boulder,

2938
02:11:50,781 --> 02:11:53,270
but now he has one in Arvada which is
inside of grudge.

2939
02:11:53,360 --> 02:11:55,450
And so now we had a 10th planet in there
and he's,

2940
02:11:55,490 --> 02:12:00,490
he's actually so in some slick darce
jokes and uh,

2941
02:12:00,710 --> 02:12:02,000
and yeah,
that's awesome.

2942
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:05,420
Some stuff that's his belt too.
I have a fight lined up for you maybe,

2943
02:12:05,540 --> 02:12:07,280
um,
maybe November,

2944
02:12:07,281 --> 02:12:10,730
December where we're looking at that and
the thing that I want to do is getting a

2945
02:12:10,731 --> 02:12:14,060
real.
I haven't given myself time to settle,

2946
02:12:14,061 --> 02:12:19,061
to really train to really focus and I
know that now it's a time crunch,

2947
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:21,050
you know,
29.

2948
02:12:21,830 --> 02:12:25,610
I know that the youngest heavyweight I
think is still jds and junior.

2949
02:12:25,611 --> 02:12:28,850
Dos Santos and I'm in the top 10.
He's 32.

2950
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:34,750
I mean Barnett's I think 38 and time to
mature later.

2951
02:12:35,910 --> 02:12:38,240
Forty two.
Well Brock has pretty much done now.

2952
02:12:38,690 --> 02:12:42,360
I think that last positive tests to
positive tests in a row.

2953
02:12:43,010 --> 02:12:45,080
He got one before the fight.
One after the fight.

2954
02:12:45,170 --> 02:12:47,680
It's most likely one and done.
Yeah.

2955
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:48,980
Um,
so I,

2956
02:12:48,981 --> 02:12:50,530
I got,
I got some time.

2957
02:12:50,550 --> 02:12:52,700
You thinking about going to the UFC,
are you.

2958
02:12:52,730 --> 02:12:57,340
So you have this ballot tour deal is,
are you enjoying competing for Beltour?

2959
02:12:57,550 --> 02:13:01,760
I,
I have thoroughly appreciated how

2960
02:13:01,990 --> 02:13:03,860
they've been treating me.
They've been.

2961
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:07,010
But you're mentioning all these MMA
fighters from the UFC.

2962
02:13:07,040 --> 02:13:08,900
So are you,
are you thinking about going over there?

2963
02:13:08,901 --> 02:13:12,920
Is that what's going on or I mean,
I would never be against that because I

2964
02:13:12,921 --> 02:13:16,010
love the UFC.
Love MMA and that's a big,

2965
02:13:16,011 --> 02:13:18,200
big platform.
How long has your deal at bell or four?

2966
02:13:18,290 --> 02:13:21,600
I have two more fights and um,
so I'll,

2967
02:13:21,601 --> 02:13:25,400
I'll,
I'll fight to more and for me,

2968
02:13:25,460 --> 02:13:29,660
I mean reason we're in Colorado.
First is I wanted to get my wrestling

2969
02:13:29,661 --> 02:13:32,250
back because I'm pretty disappointed.
My first two,

2970
02:13:32,480 --> 02:13:37,480
I honestly winning this was the first
two times winning felt really good

2971
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:39,510
because I did it.

2972
02:13:39,690 --> 02:13:42,630
I didn't do it for me,
but then the same time right away the

2973
02:13:42,631 --> 02:13:45,330
competitor comes in and is like messed
up here,

2974
02:13:45,331 --> 02:13:45,631
here,
here,

2975
02:13:45,631 --> 02:13:46,460
here,
here,

2976
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:49,380
and I think pretty much every guy taking
the ground finished.

2977
02:13:49,381 --> 02:13:51,570
It's like,
why am I trying to outbox the boxers

2978
02:13:51,900 --> 02:13:53,490
whenever I need to.
I need to wrestle.

2979
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:55,890
You need to take them down.
Is it difficult for you to balance the

2980
02:13:55,891 --> 02:13:57,420
two worlds?
Because you know,

2981
02:13:57,421 --> 02:14:00,630
you have one that demands incredible
attention,

2982
02:14:00,640 --> 02:14:04,140
your fighting career demands incredible
attention and then you have the other

2983
02:14:04,141 --> 02:14:09,141
that also demands incredible attention.
You have an amazing commitment to these

2984
02:14:09,421 --> 02:14:13,830
pygmy people and uh,
this incredible passion and love for it.

2985
02:14:13,890 --> 02:14:18,890
But then you also have your urine,
the date most dangerous combat sport in

2986
02:14:19,111 --> 02:14:20,310
the world.
I mean,

2987
02:14:20,340 --> 02:14:22,800
it,
it requires massive attention.

2988
02:14:22,801 --> 02:14:24,450
Like we were talking about Francisca.
No,

2989
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:29,190
like if you're gonna Fight Francis,
now you got a fucking batten down the

2990
02:14:29,191 --> 02:14:29,700
hatches.

2991
02:14:29,700 --> 02:14:33,570
You got to be in incredible shape and
for being consistent,

2992
02:14:34,260 --> 02:14:37,270
dedicated and no excuses.
And um,

2993
02:14:37,530 --> 02:14:41,400
that's,
that's what left a pretty sour taste in

2994
02:14:41,401 --> 02:14:45,780
my mouth after these last two fights
because I knew I hate doing that.

2995
02:14:45,781 --> 02:14:48,810
Like a rushing it or getting in whenever
prepared.

2996
02:14:48,811 --> 02:14:51,300
And um,
are you training at all when you're in

2997
02:14:51,301 --> 02:14:53,490
the Congo and how often do you end the
Congo?

2998
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:57,570
A now I'm now I'm going to start going
back just after every fight.

2999
02:14:57,740 --> 02:14:59,970
When I fight,
go back for a couple of weeks.

3000
02:15:00,060 --> 02:15:02,550
I'm trying to be real safe this time it
took my own food.

3001
02:15:02,820 --> 02:15:06,960
I'm like all of it,
like an entire check bag was just kind

3002
02:15:06,961 --> 02:15:10,650
bars,
Lara bars and all these different green

3003
02:15:10,651 --> 02:15:12,150
smoothies and different stuff.
So I was,

3004
02:15:12,151 --> 02:15:13,740
I was,
I wasn't even eating any food,

3005
02:15:13,741 --> 02:15:16,020
they're still got sick and so had
malaria.

3006
02:15:16,020 --> 02:15:19,600
Then after that I got shingles,
which is crazy.

3007
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:23,280
It was completely across my forehead and
over here.

3008
02:15:23,281 --> 02:15:25,920
So there's like the middle of the trip
that's coming back at case,

3009
02:15:26,150 --> 02:15:27,810
right?
Isn't that like kind of a herpes,

3010
02:15:28,140 --> 02:15:33,140
a it chick?
It's the adult form of the chicken pox.

3011
02:15:33,760 --> 02:15:35,530
It's a,
it's brutal.

3012
02:15:35,531 --> 02:15:37,860
Like it was.
It was a different pain than I've ever

3013
02:15:37,861 --> 02:15:42,750
felt because it's a nerve pain and that
was out in the forest and there was a

3014
02:15:43,260 --> 02:15:44,071
couple,
two,

3015
02:15:44,071 --> 02:15:47,820
three days where we were there for the
documentary,

3016
02:15:47,821 --> 02:15:49,140
for the water wells,
everything else.

3017
02:15:49,141 --> 02:15:53,100
And we got a team that came and so we
gotta we gotta get it done.

3018
02:15:53,101 --> 02:15:57,000
So I kind of stayed back a couple of
days but then while we're out there in

3019
02:15:57,001 --> 02:15:59,100
different stuff,
like a rebel group actually came,

3020
02:15:59,101 --> 02:16:04,101
like I believe it was three miles from
us and only about a mile away from our

3021
02:16:05,191 --> 02:16:07,650
truck.
And so I'm sick.

3022
02:16:08,040 --> 02:16:11,520
I can't get back to the hospital that I
just came out of from getting treatment

3023
02:16:11,521 --> 02:16:15,150
for malaria to get treatment for
shingles and then,

3024
02:16:15,151 --> 02:16:16,470
uh,
so that was tough,

3025
02:16:17,070 --> 02:16:20,190
but for me to answer your question like
I want to be,

3026
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:24,390
I want to be realistic,
but at the same time a quote my mom

3027
02:16:24,391 --> 02:16:26,250
taught me,
I forget who it was,

3028
02:16:26,251 --> 02:16:27,570
but she said something like,
uh,

3029
02:16:28,370 --> 02:16:33,370
I'm an optimist is someone who goes
after moby Dick in a rowboat and takes

3030
02:16:34,271 --> 02:16:35,210
the tartar sauce with them.

3031
02:16:38,360 --> 02:16:43,300
Optimists goes after moby Dick in a
rowboat and takes the tartar sauce with

3032
02:16:43,301 --> 02:16:44,620
them.
So for me,

3033
02:16:44,621 --> 02:16:47,200
I want to be,
I want to swing for the fences,

3034
02:16:47,530 --> 02:16:50,110
make the biggest impact possible,
but at the same time,

3035
02:16:50,111 --> 02:16:52,660
like we,
we're restructuring stuff.

3036
02:16:52,661 --> 02:16:55,870
We had meetings at water four and I
think just getting everyone on the same

3037
02:16:55,871 --> 02:16:56,830
page.
Well me too,

3038
02:16:56,831 --> 02:17:01,360
because I was listening to the biggest
thing possible is the UFC heavyweight

3039
02:17:01,361 --> 02:17:02,740
championship now,
without a doubt.

3040
02:17:02,950 --> 02:17:06,100
Is that a first ballot where then UFC or
is that a thought that you have in your

3041
02:17:06,101 --> 02:17:08,270
mind with.
Well yeah,

3042
02:17:08,271 --> 02:17:11,680
the one will be on one of those goals.
Okay.

3043
02:17:11,740 --> 02:17:16,180
At UFC 200 is good.
Sound goofy to anybody else.

3044
02:17:16,181 --> 02:17:17,920
I think a lot of athletes would probably
get it,

3045
02:17:18,220 --> 02:17:20,230
some might not,
but you know,

3046
02:17:20,290 --> 02:17:22,990
I,
I bought a UFC replica belt because,

3047
02:17:22,991 --> 02:17:23,824
uh,
I want to,

3048
02:17:23,920 --> 02:17:26,620
I'm not gonna hang it or anything,
but I want to have times where I set

3049
02:17:26,621 --> 02:17:29,530
that down on a table or a desk and look
at it,

3050
02:17:29,531 --> 02:17:32,830
think about it,
dream about it and know that before I go

3051
02:17:32,831 --> 02:17:34,630
out the door training,
um,

3052
02:17:34,680 --> 02:17:35,350
you know,
that's,

3053
02:17:35,350 --> 02:17:36,340
that's a goal of mine,
you know,

3054
02:17:36,341 --> 02:17:41,170
if I could get there then I know this
fight for the forgotten can be set up

3055
02:17:41,171 --> 02:17:42,180
for,
you know,

3056
02:17:42,190 --> 02:17:43,960
the,
maybe the rest of,

3057
02:17:44,130 --> 02:17:45,790
of my life there,
you know,

3058
02:17:45,820 --> 02:17:49,010
it could keep going on and on further
than it would if I didn't.

3059
02:17:49,070 --> 02:17:51,490
Realistically to try to attain that sort
of a goal.

3060
02:17:51,730 --> 02:17:54,190
Like it's going to require more than
just staring at a belt or writing

3061
02:17:54,191 --> 02:17:56,440
something down.
You're gonna you're gonna need to go on

3062
02:17:56,441 --> 02:17:57,610
a rampage.
Yeah.

3063
02:17:57,611 --> 02:17:58,271
We've,
we've,

3064
02:17:58,271 --> 02:18:00,100
uh,
we've surrounded it.

3065
02:18:00,101 --> 02:18:02,980
Will water forest surrounded,
fight for the forgotten with like a team

3066
02:18:02,981 --> 02:18:07,981
of like eight people from media to my
sports agent to lawyers and I'm just,

3067
02:18:11,680 --> 02:18:13,600
all these,
all these people are incredible.

3068
02:18:13,630 --> 02:18:16,660
And I'm sitting in the room with them at
a conference table like this.

3069
02:18:16,661 --> 02:18:17,730
And I'm like,
like,

3070
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:21,190
what am I doing in a room with these
incredible people?

3071
02:18:21,430 --> 02:18:23,140
And they're all,
yeah,

3072
02:18:23,141 --> 02:18:26,980
they're all focused on me.
And knowing the story in like lookout,

3073
02:18:28,070 --> 02:18:30,420
I don't know if you'd call it raw or
pure or like,

3074
02:18:30,820 --> 02:18:32,980
like in they're getting behind it,
which has been incredible.

3075
02:18:32,981 --> 02:18:37,981
But then they just overwhelmed me saying
we want to free you up in a way.

3076
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:41,170
We're kind of talking a little earlier
was alluding to it,

3077
02:18:41,171 --> 02:18:42,340
but,
um,

3078
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:42,941
you know,
I,

3079
02:18:42,941 --> 02:18:46,510
I really got to readjust everything in
my life of how I'm training because

3080
02:18:46,620 --> 02:18:47,950
when,
now that I'm getting settled into

3081
02:18:47,951 --> 02:18:49,050
Denver,
um,

3082
02:18:49,360 --> 02:18:53,260
out all go up to number one to three
times a week and then also be under the

3083
02:18:53,261 --> 02:18:55,660
Olympic training center.
I've been talking with Brandon slay,

3084
02:18:55,720 --> 02:18:58,330
the old freestyle coach,
which he actually just moved to penn

3085
02:18:58,331 --> 02:18:59,170
state.
Um,

3086
02:18:59,770 --> 02:19:00,190
but,
uh,

3087
02:19:00,190 --> 02:19:02,650
talking with uh,
and had access there at the Olympic

3088
02:19:02,651 --> 02:19:05,530
training center and about,
hopefully I can get in touch with Matt

3089
02:19:05,530 --> 02:19:06,940
Lindland.
He's the new head coach for the Greco

3090
02:19:06,941 --> 02:19:08,230
team there.
Um,

3091
02:19:08,290 --> 02:19:09,280
but with,
uh,

3092
02:19:09,670 --> 02:19:14,260
have you ever heard of Adam Wheeler?
Adam wheelers an absolute beast and I

3093
02:19:14,261 --> 02:19:16,600
wonder if I have that video in there,
but,

3094
02:19:16,601 --> 02:19:18,400
uh,
there's one if you just search Adam

3095
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,470
Wheeler on Youtube,
should we called ISO pure.

3096
02:19:20,471 --> 02:19:25,120
But this dude is an Olympic bronze
medalist and a black belt in Jujitsu.

3097
02:19:25,390 --> 02:19:29,750
Anyone Nogi world's heavyweight.
And so he's a beast,

3098
02:19:29,810 --> 02:19:32,180
just an absolute monster.
And so,

3099
02:19:32,500 --> 02:19:34,640
uh,
I was helping them train for the 2008

3100
02:19:34,641 --> 02:19:38,240
Olympics and stuff and um,
it was pretty great.

3101
02:19:38,270 --> 02:19:39,020
Oh,
here it is.

3102
02:19:39,020 --> 02:19:40,010
This guy's a beast.

3103
02:19:43,270 --> 02:19:44,500
We're not hearing anything,
Jeremy.

3104
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:46,650
Correct.
She got into wrestling.

3105
02:19:46,651 --> 02:19:51,651
So I was in high school.
There was a point when I'm starting to

3106
02:19:51,661 --> 02:19:54,840
getting into a little bit of trouble and
just hanging out with the wrong crowd.

3107
02:19:56,010 --> 02:19:58,500
My wrestling coach,
he's the one that Kinda put me back on

3108
02:19:58,501 --> 02:20:01,800
the right track.
He taught me what work ethic was.

3109
02:20:04,890 --> 02:20:07,800
I try to be the guy who motivates
people,

3110
02:20:07,860 --> 02:20:11,340
pushes people.
The most peer moment of my athletic

3111
02:20:11,341 --> 02:20:14,990
career is 100 percent the Olympics.
Even though I didn't win,

3112
02:20:14,991 --> 02:20:19,020
I still was on that podium representing
my country for the sport that I put so

3113
02:20:19,021 --> 02:20:22,370
many hours into.
That feeling is indescribable.

3114
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:24,360
And the point is,
is the guy you're,

3115
02:20:24,680 --> 02:20:26,370
you're working with or something.
Yeah.

3116
02:20:26,371 --> 02:20:28,050
And sorry,
I probably should have set that up a

3117
02:20:28,051 --> 02:20:31,470
little better,
but this guy is an absolute monster and

3118
02:20:31,471 --> 02:20:32,540
we've,
we're,

3119
02:20:32,550 --> 02:20:34,140
we're,
we're getting together and starting to.

3120
02:20:34,350 --> 02:20:37,060
We're going to start working out and
he's at Prime Jujitsu,

3121
02:20:37,090 --> 02:20:39,450
knew in Colorado Springs,
but they cross train with eastern's and

3122
02:20:39,900 --> 02:20:42,240
here's the thing.
I'm all over the place,

3123
02:20:42,241 --> 02:20:45,240
but he is the only guy to be trained.
So we're all jumping.

3124
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:49,020
Do Squat jumps a row by row with these
bleachers.

3125
02:20:49,440 --> 02:20:52,860
And I promise he's skipping one at least
and sometimes too.

3126
02:20:53,010 --> 02:20:54,660
And he just,
he was flying up there.

3127
02:20:54,661 --> 02:20:56,880
People be halfway,
three quarters of the way.

3128
02:20:56,881 --> 02:21:00,990
This guy is six foot four,
235 pounds solid muscle freakish

3129
02:21:01,080 --> 02:21:02,350
athlete.
And uh,

3130
02:21:02,430 --> 02:21:04,520
he's just.
So there's a training partner for

3131
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:06,900
training partner so,
well I guess what I was trying to allude

3132
02:21:06,901 --> 02:21:11,010
to is me and I feel like how water
forests around me with such an

3133
02:21:11,011 --> 02:21:16,011
incredible team to achieve success that
we fight for the forgotten in now and

3134
02:21:16,411 --> 02:21:18,000
really trying to do that with,
uh,

3135
02:21:18,210 --> 02:21:22,410
with fighting because if I don't then
I'm gonna fail and I'll be wasting time.

3136
02:21:22,770 --> 02:21:24,310
But if I,
cause this isn't a,

3137
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:26,910
it's not a,
it's not patty cake,

3138
02:21:26,911 --> 02:21:27,780
right?
I mean we're,

3139
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:31,760
we're going in there and we're throwing
down and I've got my head on straight.

3140
02:21:31,990 --> 02:21:33,990
You as you move up in competition for
sure.

3141
02:21:33,991 --> 02:21:35,160
Without a doubt.
I mean,

3142
02:21:35,340 --> 02:21:39,780
when you're looking at the competition
you faced in beltour there good steps.

3143
02:21:40,010 --> 02:21:43,740
It's tough guys to fight against their.
They're good steps.

3144
02:21:44,010 --> 02:21:46,440
But if you were the timing of
everything.

3145
02:21:46,650 --> 02:21:47,850
Yeah,
yeah.

3146
02:21:47,851 --> 02:21:48,340
If I,
I'm,

3147
02:21:48,340 --> 02:21:50,090
it's A.
Yeah,

3148
02:21:50,100 --> 02:21:51,630
it's not,
it's not.

3149
02:21:52,890 --> 02:21:55,800
I guess a swinging for the fences are
taking the tartar sauce with me.

3150
02:21:56,010 --> 02:21:57,060
If I see that,
uh,

3151
02:21:58,260 --> 02:22:00,030
that it's not going to happen,
then you know,

3152
02:22:01,260 --> 02:22:04,200
I hate saying that because I want to
fight so bad,

3153
02:22:04,350 --> 02:22:06,630
but fight for the forgotten is more
important in a way.

3154
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:10,140
But I mean I think it's possible.
I really do and I think,

3155
02:22:11,370 --> 02:22:13,530
I think it's possible to.
I think you've also brought a lot of

3156
02:22:13,531 --> 02:22:17,910
people in to help you with fight for the
forgotten to pick up the slack as well

3157
02:22:18,180 --> 02:22:21,120
and you've started a movement.
I mean there's a lot going on here

3158
02:22:21,121 --> 02:22:25,080
besides just your involvement.
You've started this movement and being

3159
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:26,370
with water for

3160
02:22:26,380 --> 02:22:29,880
and,
and writing the book and letting people

3161
02:22:29,881 --> 02:22:34,290
know about on these podcasts and,
and educating people to what your goal

3162
02:22:34,291 --> 02:22:36,270
is and what,
what you've been able to accomplish over

3163
02:22:36,271 --> 02:22:37,770
there.
He started a movement.

3164
02:22:37,771 --> 02:22:41,100
So I think man,
I mean if you really can do it,

3165
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:45,750
it would be absolutely incredible and it
certainly would shine even more light if

3166
02:22:45,751 --> 02:22:49,800
you could really become successful as an
MMA fighter from here on out.

3167
02:22:50,190 --> 02:22:50,451
No,
I,

3168
02:22:50,451 --> 02:22:53,390
I agree with that with,
but it's going to require everything

3169
02:22:53,580 --> 02:22:56,100
requires everything.
And I feel like there's,

3170
02:22:56,220 --> 02:23:00,110
there's two parts of this where I'm mean
the,

3171
02:23:00,840 --> 02:23:03,690
the fight for the forgotten guy in me
wants to be,

3172
02:23:04,670 --> 02:23:06,480
wants to be humble and everything will
say,

3173
02:23:06,530 --> 02:23:07,680
you know,
it's not going to happen.

3174
02:23:07,681 --> 02:23:10,560
Listen to all the right things,
which is the same on the other side of

3175
02:23:10,561 --> 02:23:13,620
the coin.
But I'm a at the same time.

3176
02:23:13,740 --> 02:23:18,570
I feel like if,
if I can just get the time,

3177
02:23:18,630 --> 02:23:20,650
I haven't been getting the time,
uh,

3178
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:22,170
to train.
And

3179
02:23:23,790 --> 02:23:25,800
one of the things that you have to make
the time.

3180
02:23:25,820 --> 02:23:27,390
Yeah,
we have to make the time and it's got to

3181
02:23:27,391 --> 02:23:30,450
be the priority.
And I don't think I,

3182
02:23:30,690 --> 02:23:35,070
it can't be some six to eight hours.
I mean like 68 whenever I was telling

3183
02:23:36,150 --> 02:23:38,940
the guys at water four and it's just
because they don't know.

3184
02:23:39,020 --> 02:23:42,280
They've been incredibly supportive.
But whenever I broke it down like winter

3185
02:23:42,330 --> 02:23:43,980
training schedule,
what time do you train a day?

3186
02:23:44,520 --> 02:23:46,320
I mean,
they know some nfl guys and stuff like

3187
02:23:46,321 --> 02:23:51,321
that that might train once a day for
four or five times a week or maybe twice

3188
02:23:52,830 --> 02:23:53,641
a day with them.
And they,

3189
02:23:53,641 --> 02:23:54,780
it's just so different that they're
like,

3190
02:23:54,781 --> 02:23:56,700
oh wow.
So that's why they've rallied around me

3191
02:23:56,820 --> 02:24:00,570
and I think that through that it's going
to free me up to really good all the

3192
02:24:00,571 --> 02:24:02,730
right places.
Get up to grudge for my strike and get

3193
02:24:02,731 --> 02:24:04,320
to the Olympic training center from a
wrestling.

3194
02:24:04,560 --> 02:24:07,350
Get around these black belts in world
champs in Jujitsu.

3195
02:24:07,410 --> 02:24:11,460
Get around the 10th planet guys.
Get around this so that we can,

3196
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,490
we can take this the farthest that we
can.

3197
02:24:14,670 --> 02:24:15,560
Beautiful.
Yeah.

3198
02:24:16,110 --> 02:24:17,460
All right man.
Well listen,

3199
02:24:17,510 --> 02:24:18,870
um,
again,

3200
02:24:18,871 --> 02:24:21,990
one more time for people at home.
Fight for the forgotten.org.

3201
02:24:21,991 --> 02:24:25,020
Fight for the forgotten.com.
Uh,

3202
02:24:25,560 --> 02:24:28,800
what is your big pygmy on,
on twitter,

3203
02:24:29,280 --> 02:24:32,370
on twitter and instagram?
That's the big pygmy.

3204
02:24:32,800 --> 02:24:35,730
I've translated some abouti among both.
They go,

3205
02:24:35,731 --> 02:24:37,830
yeah.
So it's the big pygmy fight for the

3206
02:24:37,831 --> 02:24:38,700
forgotten to work.
Oh,

3207
02:24:39,060 --> 02:24:41,680
this is something that,
that I just found out that water four.

3208
02:24:41,690 --> 02:24:44,640
Does that mean $25?
Some of the people have been so

3209
02:24:44,641 --> 02:24:46,890
generous.
Donors have given a full water well,

3210
02:24:47,100 --> 02:24:49,590
but even just $25 a month,
if that's possible,

3211
02:24:50,610 --> 02:24:54,090
it gives water to 15 people per year.
If you do it the next year,

3212
02:24:54,091 --> 02:24:56,460
it's another 15 people that could save
their lives,

3213
02:24:56,461 --> 02:24:58,080
save kids' lives.
And so,

3214
02:24:58,081 --> 02:24:59,910
um,
I just know it's being used the right

3215
02:24:59,911 --> 02:25:02,400
way and a passionate about it,
seeing it in action.

3216
02:25:02,401 --> 02:25:05,100
So you're a beautiful soul,
Justin wren,

3217
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:06,060
you really are.
Man.

3218
02:25:06,061 --> 02:25:09,990
What you're doing is absolutely amazing
and I'm so happy that we can help you

3219
02:25:09,991 --> 02:25:12,780
out in any way.
So thank you very much for coming on

3220
02:25:12,781 --> 02:25:14,670
again,
and let's do this again,

3221
02:25:14,671 --> 02:25:15,630
brother.
Love you man.

3222
02:25:15,631 --> 02:25:17,490
Thank you so much.
You've got community,

3223
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,760
best fans.
I'm honored and I'm honored to be able

3224
02:25:20,761 --> 02:25:22,620
to help you tell your story is powerful.
Thank you.

3225
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:24,490
Thank you my.
All right folks,

3226
02:25:24,580 --> 02:25:26,230
we'll be back tomorrow with Duncan
trussell.

3227
02:25:26,231 --> 02:25:27,850
See you.
That's going to be a great one.
