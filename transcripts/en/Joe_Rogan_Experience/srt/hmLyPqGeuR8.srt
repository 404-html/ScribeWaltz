1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:01,810
What,

3
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:02,870
what happens is,

4
00:00:02,871 --> 00:00:04,520
is that with these careers is,

5
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:05,813
um,

6
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,253
Gail again,

7
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:07,940
you know,

8
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,150
a year after Gilligan's
island goes off the air goes,

9
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:11,750
uh,

10
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,860
Bob Denver goes,

11
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:13,160
uh,

12
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,791
fuck this,

13
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,620
I'm not wearing that stupid white hat.

14
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:17,460
And the red crew neck sweater thing,

15
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:19,910
the white pants like bull shit.

16
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,440
And then he does about 10
years of this is bullshit.

17
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,050
And then he does about five
years of soul searching.

18
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,110
And then at some point he opens the
closet and grabs that hat and going down,

19
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,590
open that fucking boat show in Long Beach
and walk out of here with nine grand.

20
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,520
And then it starts and then it
starts to wax the stylish about it.

21
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,500
So I think,

22
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:41,631
uh,

23
00:00:41,631 --> 00:00:45,460
the dice man put down the pack of
cigarettes in the leather vest and said,

24
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:45,711
uh,

25
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm going to do some other things and
at a certain point realize ain't paying

26
00:00:49,341 --> 00:00:50,170
the bills doing it.

27
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,660
Do you remember when he had a sitcom?

28
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,171
He went,

29
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:53,010
he went clean for,

30
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,900
he had a sitcom on CBS and it was called,

31
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,550
bless this house or something like that,

32
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,151
wasn't it called?

33
00:00:57,151 --> 00:01:01,140
That was like when kiss went on mass and
it was with the woman from raging bull.

34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,433
Yeah.

35
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,120
Yeah.

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,030
What the fuck is common?

37
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,913
Rossby

38
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,270
I mean salad,

39
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:14,170
the fuck was her name because she was
super hot and then she got Chubby as fuck.

40
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,303
Yes.

41
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:17,110
Oh,

42
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,680
Deann,

43
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:17,921
no,

44
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:18,880
not the Angelo.

45
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,750
Um,

46
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,770
fuck is her name.

47
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,290
Cathy Moriarty and Moriarty's

48
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,950
Mr. Hot as fuck.

49
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,510
And then you know,

50
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,470
much like all of us,

51
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,150
she fell upon us all the
daisy Duke girl added Bach,

52
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,470
sorry to comic book convention.

53
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:36,280
It was the saddest thing you will ever
see her sitting there with her little

54
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:36,731
shorts,

55
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:38,710
but they weren't as
sharp as they used to be.

56
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,560
And she just,

57
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,300
just sitting there,

58
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,230
no one talking to her.

59
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,790
No one even knowing that
she's sitting there,

60
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:43,810
I just walk up and I'm like,

61
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,940
this is daisy Duke right here.

62
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:46,810
She goes and I'm like,

63
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,051
Oh,

64
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:48,040
you're signing autographs.

65
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,311
She goes,

66
00:01:48,311 --> 00:01:49,300
$25 I'm like,

67
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,163
oh no.

68
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,041
And I was like,

69
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:51,701
can I take a picture?

70
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:52,091
And she goes,

71
00:01:52,091 --> 00:01:52,241
yeah,

72
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:53,200
that's $10 I'm like,

73
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:53,291
no,

74
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,220
it's the notes with my camera.

75
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:54,690
And she goes,

76
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:54,940
yeah,

77
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,773
it's $10.

78
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,220
But it was the saddest thing ever.

79
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:57,401
I'm like,

80
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:58,110
no thank you.

81
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,901
And I just walked away.

82
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:02,410
And this little daisy Duke just sit
in the corner by herself sitting at a

83
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:03,160
folding chair.

84
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:03,941
Can I tell you something?

85
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:04,774
That's Saturn,

86
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:05,980
uh,

87
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,810
moments ago when Joe was like,

88
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,441
you know,

89
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,274
what's the name of that

90
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:09,970
sir?

91
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,940
And they put the fatwa on the guy.

92
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,860
Remember Andy wrote Satanic Verses.

93
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:15,221
Remember that?

94
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:16,360
What was the name of that guy?

95
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:16,780
And I'm like,

96
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,530
yeah,

97
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,320
you know that author,

98
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,061
remember he had to,

99
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:22,930
he had to hide because they'd
put a hit on him and Cat Stevens,

100
00:02:22,931 --> 00:02:23,350
uh,

101
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:23,591
you know,

102
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:25,960
gave a two thumbs up and
what's the name of that author?

103
00:02:25,961 --> 00:02:26,380
And I'm like,

104
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:26,820
uh,

105
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,111
yeah,

106
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:27,400
I,

107
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,810
I damn couldn't tell you,

108
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:29,644
but when you're like,

109
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,580
um,

110
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,071
I saw it.

111
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:31,810
Daisy Duke,

112
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,643
Catherine Bach,

113
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,130
fucking sad.

114
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:36,501
Well,

115
00:02:36,501 --> 00:02:37,011
we were a kid.

116
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:37,844
She was

117
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,561
sad that,

118
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:40,670
that's where my knowledge base.

119
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,540
Not that old though.

120
00:02:41,541 --> 00:02:42,171
How old is she?

121
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:42,531
She,

122
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:45,440
she looks probably about 50.

123
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,180
So it's just the booze is,

124
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,310
it looked just like sadness,

125
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,263
sadness,

126
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,191
booze or drugs.

127
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:52,411
It's a,

128
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,610
it's amazing how the booze really jacks.

129
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:54,860
Yeah,

130
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,050
it was a little freckles
weren't there as much anymore.

131
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:57,950
She's done.

132
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,120
But then you look at like,

133
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,560
um,

134
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,260
Christie Brinkley

135
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,390
is still hot as fuck.

136
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,141
Well something or another,

137
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:06,010
she's keeping it together and she's
like 53 I have this fun imaginary game.

138
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,430
No,

139
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,260
I like to play when I get stone,

140
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,740
which is a sort of the acts,

141
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,531
it's like it's,

142
00:03:12,531 --> 00:03:13,480
it's a cross.

143
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,343
Okay.

144
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:19,380
And let's say when you
were in junior high,

145
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,190
let's say you're,

146
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:26,140
let's say you're in the seventh grade
for the sake argument and a dukes of

147
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,910
hazard is hitting its prime,

148
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,210
the good old boy and a blown up down
house with the crossbow and whatnot.

149
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,270
And you're,

150
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,950
you're just sitting there and you're
seeing an episode that has Catherine Bach

151
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,940
tight daisy dukes,

152
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:43,030
and she does that thing where she leans
over the open hood and the steam comes

153
00:03:43,031 --> 00:03:43,864
out and everything.

154
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,910
And now there you are little pecker wood,

155
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,280
New Jersey in seventh grade and you're,

156
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,290
now you're at the bottom of each acts.

157
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,570
You couldn't get further away.

158
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:52,880
There's,

159
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,140
it's not like you stole
a bus ticket to La.

160
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,980
You could fuck Catherine Bach.

161
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:57,760
No Way.

162
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,020
You're a million miles away.

163
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,770
So true.

164
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,250
Okay.

165
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,083
But now,

166
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,500
now you start heading up the legs
of the acts and just a good old.

167
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,340
Now we move on.

168
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:07,174
10 years.

169
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,620
Joseph,

170
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,011
Joseph,

171
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:09,970
standup comedian,

172
00:04:09,971 --> 00:04:10,900
getting started,

173
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,640
having a little success,

174
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,720
making a little money,

175
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,960
grown into his body and become
sexual sexually charged.

176
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,620
He's 23,

177
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,920
2123 years of age now.

178
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,350
A dukes of hazards been off the air,

179
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:26,890
you know,

180
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,490
uh,

181
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,240
15 years.

182
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,710
Yeah,

183
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:29,380
they've been off.

184
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,621
Well,

185
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:29,861
no,

186
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:30,600
I'm saying at this point,

187
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:30,820
yeah.

188
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,061
Okay.

189
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,320
Let's say it's been off 10 years,

190
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,101
10 years,

191
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:33,910
but she's still,

192
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,870
she's 36.

193
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,950
They'll look looking pretty tight.

194
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,610
You know,

195
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,443
whatever looking at,

196
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,250
but Joe's not looking too bad either.

197
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:40,980
And Joe starting to do a little standup,

198
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:41,740
whatever.

199
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,910
At what point,

200
00:04:42,911 --> 00:04:43,744
Joe,

201
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,350
at what point do you cross her?

202
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,720
Like at a certain point,

203
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:50,441
I mean,

204
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:51,880
when you're in the seventh grade,

205
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,680
you were sold your fucking soul and killed
your step mom to get one liquor that

206
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:57,190
pussy.

207
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,850
Right.

208
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,840
But now,

209
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,830
but now,

210
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:02,370
but if I asked you repulsive
if I asked you this second.

211
00:05:02,371 --> 00:05:02,560
Yeah.

212
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
Well then obviously you guys crossed.

213
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,290
Yes.

214
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,700
What Year did you cross?

215
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:07,480
That's,

216
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
that's my game.

217
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,350
And then,

218
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,460
but and then there's something like,

219
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,681
Ooh,

220
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,280
you haven't crossed Christie Brinkley yet,

221
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:14,920
or maybe you're meeting maybe
about nine months away from,

222
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,540
from just hitting right in the middle.

223
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,970
If Chritton and Christie
Brinkley's still above me.

224
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,243
She's got me.

225
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:21,491
Yeah,

226
00:05:21,491 --> 00:05:22,101
she's shy,

227
00:05:22,101 --> 00:05:27,101
but maybe she's still hot and she's
53 you know she's like 57 oh Jesus.

228
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,061
That's my point.

229
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:29,500
She's going to be 60 maybe I,

230
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,140
maybe I crossed her at
57 but she looks great.

231
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,251
Maybe.

232
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:34,750
Maybe she does it with TV.

233
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,680
You can never really tell.

234
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,120
I'll have to ask Christine.

235
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:37,390
We'll,

236
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,750
we'll see what we can agree
to be an awesome coach.

237
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,150
The Catherine Bach thing,

238
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:44,500
it all depends on how much
Catherine Bach took care of herself,

239
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,450
whether or not she was
still sharing movies.

240
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:46,910
You know what I mean?

241
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:47,743
Yeah.

242
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:48,311
There's,

243
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:51,160
there's some women that even though
they've kind of deteriorated,

244
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:54,010
there's still have a level
of respect when news radio,

245
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,710
she's been off TV for 14 years.

246
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:58,640
You know what saying once
fear factor happened,

247
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:00,010
I had her mine,

248
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,700
she was mine when I was hosting,

249
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,630
if I wanted to get Katherine,

250
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:04,610
I don't work out some
sort of bracket list,

251
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,151
you know what I mean?

252
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:05,961
We're just really,

253
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:09,440
you could find all the chicks you wanted
to fuck when you were in the eighth

254
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:11,840
grade and see when you cross that

255
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,950
there is nothing stranger than watching
a woman go from being beautiful and

256
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,970
having ultimate power.

257
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,590
A really super hot chick,

258
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,341
super hot.

259
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:24,230
21 year old chick has almost,

260
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,640
it's almost voodoo.

261
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,151
You know,

262
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:28,760
like their body and the
way they move and like toy,

263
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:33,140
they smell and if they like you and if
they're smart too and if you're not sure

264
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:33,974
if you can get them,

265
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,150
God damn,

266
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,060
it's almost fucking viewed.

267
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,000
It's ultimate power.

268
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:39,650
It's super celebrity power.

269
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,130
The reason why celebrities get so
ridiculously fucked up trumps everything.

270
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,430
The reason why celebrities gets so
ridiculously big headed and she goes,

271
00:06:46,431 --> 00:06:47,211
everywhere you go,

272
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:48,440
people are kissing your ass.

273
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,311
Everywhere you go,

274
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:49,790
people are,

275
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,570
here's you know,

276
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:51,590
free bottle service.

277
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:53,090
Here's a limousine for free,

278
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,710
please eat at my restaurant.

279
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:55,700
You're amazing.

280
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,120
You've changed my life and you start
thinking that will start the shot.

281
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,320
That's an awesome thought,

282
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:00,830
Mr Rob.

283
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,550
But girls from the moment
they're little from the moment.

284
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:05,540
They literally are so cute.

285
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,620
You're so beautiful.

286
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,730
And then they're in high school.

287
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,200
Then it becomes currency.

288
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,350
It becomes the thing that defines them
and then it goes away and it goes away

289
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:15,644
slowly.

290
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,431
It goes away.

291
00:07:16,431 --> 00:07:19,040
Weird when they start looking
like that rough bar girl,

292
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,341
you know,

293
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:21,680
like still hot but in her
thirties but you know,

294
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:24,600
he could see her at a cigarette and maybe
I'd get a couple of shots of Jack in

295
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,330
you and let's just go fucking the woods.

296
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:26,900
You know,

297
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,070
just some crazy bitch.

298
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:28,460
It's just,

299
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,120
she's not the 21 year old grows that
cheerleader who it was impossible to get.

300
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,470
Now she's just wild bitch.

301
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:33,950
He's just,

302
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,101
yeah,

303
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:34,790
you feel forced.

304
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,810
You're trying to pay her bills.

305
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,010
She had been divorced,

306
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:37,520
you know,

307
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,890
and then eventually they become monsters.

308
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:42,140
They become this weird thing,

309
00:07:42,141 --> 00:07:43,160
especially if they get,

310
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,750
they go down the surgery route,

311
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,460
please ladies,

312
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:48,350
please just get old.

313
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,060
Don't go crazy,

314
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,770
don't fuck with your lips in your neck
and all that nutty shit does not make you

315
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:55,430
look better.

316
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,220
It makes you look different and that
different is not a good different,

317
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,390
it's a weird monster.

318
00:07:59,391 --> 00:07:59,990
Different,

319
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,750
well also you

320
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:05,750
guys are going through historically a
bad phase because your mother didn't have

321
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:12,360
to worry about plastic surgery because
it didn't really exist and your daughter

322
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,780
won't really have to worry about it
because they'll have perfected it.

323
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,080
You even are,

324
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,430
you are in network engineering.

325
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,631
Yeah.

326
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:21,390
You're in the experimental
phase and it ain't working out.

327
00:08:21,391 --> 00:08:26,391
It's Sorta like CGI that it's a bad
generation because our folks were watching

328
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,770
movies that every stunt
was an actual stunt,

329
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:32,880
just done by duty,

330
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:33,780
didn't give a shit.

331
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,720
And our kids enjoy CGI.

332
00:08:36,721 --> 00:08:38,100
That works so effectively.

333
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,030
You can't tell.

334
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,840
We went through a whole phase where we
had to watch shitty movies with really

335
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:47,841
bad effects because they were perfecting
it on our watch and we were sitting in

336
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:52,851
the theater will now we're in the theater
of plastic surgery and all you women,

337
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,030
it's accent.

338
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,870
