1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,530
A record and Sun.
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,470
welcome to the broadcast

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:11,710
and we're on right now,
which I may get it.

4
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:16,711
So you can see that had twitter for like
cooking up twice.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,140
That's a terrible way to start off the 
show.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:24,130
No one heard that shit.
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:27,160
People online right now?
There's 100 people online.

8
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,780
I'm sure.
See how many people we got?

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,820
90 four people.
Did anybody hear that?

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,220
Tastes terrible.
God Damn Joke.

11
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,930
Wow.
This is blockies.

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,280
Fuck.
Look how goofy looks.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:38,700
Cool.

14
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,310
Serious fucking delay to what's 
happening.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,960
Eddie and Joe,
why don't we come back to Philly.

16
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,380
Will be back to philly eventually.
Um,

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,780
I don't know when the UFC is going to be
back in Philly,

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,200
but people have been calling for young 
Eddie Bravo to be on the Joe Rogan 

19
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,220
podcast here.
Ladies and Gentlemen,

20
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:00,910
there is Eddie Bravo man.
There's like a five second delay.

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,870
It's awkward.
Uh,

22
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,140
so we're here in Charlotte,
North Carolina.

23
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,810
Pretty fucking bad ass town.
And it,

24
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,250
it's nice hair and people are all 
friendly.

25
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:12,290
Yeah,

26
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,840
I like it.
I like it.

27
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,870
I rented a car for the first time coming
to a UFC city and you get to know the 

28
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,580
city a lot better when you have to know 
what the hell you're going,

29
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,940
you know,
we're so used to jumping in bands and 

30
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:29,240
and just not paying attention and we 
really don't even know anything about 

31
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,890
the city.
Renting cars is the key.

32
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,920
Yeah.
Drive around and get to know the place.

33
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,970
I like it here,
man.

34
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:35,130
It's real.
It's all spread out.

35
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,240
It's a,
you know,

36
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,330
it's like no congestion creep,
oral friendly.

37
00:01:39,331 --> 00:01:42,540
There's no tension here.
It's a good size city.

38
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:45,390
Charlotte's a good size city.
It's not too crazy.

39
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,530
Yeah,
the super friendly.

40
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:51,531
I drove into the weigh ins and they were
charging for parking and since I drove 

41
00:01:51,531 --> 00:01:56,331
and then go into where the UFC van,
I pulled up to the girl taking them on 

42
00:01:56,331 --> 00:01:56,331
and go,
listen,

43
00:01:56,331 --> 00:02:00,831
I actually work for the UFC.
I just don't have my laminate but I'll 

44
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:00,831
pay whatever.
She's like,

45
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:01,130
no,
just drive right in.

46
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,620
I just drove right in.
Park went up to.

47
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,240
I needed to get back stage and again I 
didn't have my credentials.

48
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,960
So there's like security,
they're like North Carolina security.

49
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:12,210
I'm like,
I need to get my credentials.

50
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:13,600
Is there any like,
I mean,

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,800
can you direct me to a spot where I 
could speak to someone because just go 

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,520
backstage and just walked backstage and 
went right in zero security.

53
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,710
Now you're telling stalkers how they 
could meet providers,

54
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,830
you know,
next time it's going to Carolina,

55
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:28,670
you have some ammo.
Let's.

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,320
Okay.
I can't read this shit too far.

57
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,220
He's your eyes bad.
Is My eyes bad?

58
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,430
Be Bad?

59
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,890
Well,
we froze up.

60
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,710
Ustream kind of sucks,
you know,

61
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:47,260
they all suck at these things because 
the Internet is not quite ready for this

62
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:47,760
shit yet.

63
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,950
Uh,

64
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:55,370
so me just answer questions and share 
what stuff have we done in town.

65
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:56,750
We haven't done shit in town.
Really.

66
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,010
I went river rafting last Monday.

67
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,500
Last time I had a show at,
um,

68
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,410
a place called Ms Dot south.
Then a lot of fun.

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,180
Great crowd,
good times.

70
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,270
Then afterwards it was a gentleman's 
club down the street.

71
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,480
We had to bring some dudes came to my 
show.

72
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,090
They had a two books.
They wanted eddy design.

73
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,150
It's actually kind of funny story and 
they wanted a eddie the science books,

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,420
so we had to get the books over to 
Eddie,

75
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,620
but um,
and then we went to a waffle house and 

76
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:31,620
fucked up some waffles.
Yeah,

77
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,470
that was a good times.
Good Times my friend.

78
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:40,471
Good Times.
What do I think about synthetic 

79
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:40,471
cannabis?
That's legal.

80
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:40,900
That's kind of interesting.
Shit.

81
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,200
You know about that man?
They have the marinol.

82
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:44,860
No,
no,

83
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:46,420
it's a synthetic cannabis.
It's like,

84
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:47,590
you know how they had that,
uh,

85
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:50,590
when the whole balco scandal came out,
what it was,

86
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,970
was a steroid that they had made.

87
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:55,780
It was just slightly different from 
regular steroids in was undetectable and

88
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:59,170
tests because the regular steroids,
what they were looking for in the test,

89
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:02,230
they weren't looking for this stuff.
Well that's the same thing with this.

90
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:07,231
There's a synthetic cannabis that you 
could smoke it as the same effects and 

91
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:09,550
it doesn't show up in tests.
What does it look like?

92
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,590
It looks like wheat and actually it 
looks like.

93
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,050
Wait.
Yeah,

94
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,570
it looks like not a plant.
Yeah.

95
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,350
And they just wow.
They've just grown it and I mean,

96
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:19,870
it makes sense.
I mean they've figured out a way to um,

97
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,670
I didn't know about the botanists have 
figured out a way a long time ago to put

98
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,830
thc into other things.
They like,

99
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:31,831
there was an article online where there 
was this guy was trying to put the 

100
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:31,980
tomatoes,
get tomatoes to grow tac,

101
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:34,570
like they can fuck with plants and have 
them,

102
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,280
you know,
you know,

103
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,320
different plants produce more vitamin C 
and different plants do certain things 

104
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,320
and you know,
they're,

105
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,400
they're trying to figure out how to make
these,

106
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:44,290
uh,
I guess they have figured out how to,

107
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,790
how to make we'd.

108
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,450
That doesn't show up in drug tests.
Pretty crazy.

109
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:54,570
And it's legal.
So like if you worked for ups or 

110
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,270
something like that and they drug test 
you and you can't smoke weed,

111
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,050
you can smoke the fuck out of this 
stuff.

112
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,940
How long has this been out?
It's been out for awhile,

113
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,060
man.
They're trying to make it illegal.

114
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:03,010
It's a big deal.
Now we're trying to make it illegal.

115
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,880
30 bitches.
So you could sell in any way that 

116
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,660
they're selling on in high times 
magazine is where they send all that 

117
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,200
bullshit.
That stuff's not real at all.

118
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,110
Yeah.
What's up with that shit is wack.

119
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,380
That is the weakest shit ever.
That fake weed and they sell that is so 

120
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,830
dumb.
But they say that that's like a big part

121
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:28,831
of their advertising revenue.
I think that's just because they're 

122
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:28,831
fucking lazy.
You know,

123
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,440
you're telling me that everyone's so 
afraid of we.

124
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,070
They can't advertise their products and 
your magazine come on,

125
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,910
but yet you can sell fake weed.
You're just ripping people off.

126
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:39,190
That's all that is.
That stuff doesn't get anyone high.

127
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:42,580
But this other stuff does.
That sort of stuff is real.

128
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:44,500
Shit.
Eddie.

129
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,530
Eddie's here.
Talk about Ufos already.

130
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,000
Michael Chavela the guy from a k one and
you know a dream.

131
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:57,180
You know the Australian dude that we 
hung out with in Australia,

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,600
he's A.
I'm a big Ufo guy and he was a downtown 

133
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,570
Roswell Museum and he actually saw a Ufo
and took photos of it and shit.

134
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,720
Fuck yeah,
that's pretty crazy.

135
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,310
I mean,
who the fuck knows,

136
00:06:10,311 --> 00:06:10,640
man?

137
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,700
You have any UFO questions?
Go ahead and shoot.

138
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,840
Did I finish the entire plate of food?
You Post on twitter?

139
00:06:19,841 --> 00:06:22,570
I finished most of it.
I fuck up some food folks,

140
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,380
especially after shows after shows like 
a fuck up some food,

141
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,860
you know,
as the UFC to burn off a lot of energy.

142
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:31,510
Just talking.
It doesn't seem like you would,

143
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,050
but you do

144
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,980
that.
He actually flap on Saturday.

145
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,100
What does that mean?

146
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,960
Oh,
oh,

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,550
he's going down.

148
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,510
Did I watch that train wreck?
Prison wives of the Discovery Channel?

149
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,780
No.
There's a show about chicks whose 

150
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:52,870
husbands are in prison.
Oh,

151
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:57,490
I might have to see what channel 
discovery channel.

152
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,860
It might be good.
Oh,

153
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:02,840
the history channel documentary.
I know what I saw.

154
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:03,740
Yeah,
I saw that one too.

155
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:04,640
That was kind of interesting.

156
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,440
That was the best documentary I've ever 
seen on your first.

157
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,540
Uh,
definitely.

158
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:09,770
I know what I saw.
I didn't have.

159
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:13,240
It was one of those rare documentaries 
that let you have those two.

160
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,220
Didn't have like that.
The other side,

161
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,780
you know,
they didn't have a guy going,

162
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:21,110
well you know,
it's all just mythology and you know,

163
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:26,111
it's in their minds and they're all 
crazy and why are they landing in Idaho 

164
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:26,720
all the time?
Why not in big cities?

165
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:31,721
And they didn't have any of those guys 
because it was so ridiculous because 

166
00:07:31,721 --> 00:07:34,631
that's so many high ranking military 
officers coming forward that one case in

167
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:40,721
England on a US base with that 80 
witnesses and three of the guys went up 

168
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:46,661
to it and touched it and wrote down 
notes on it and they all came up in the 

169
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:48,470
Ministry of Defense.
Totally.

170
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:52,850
They said this is not a concern of 
national defense.

171
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,880
That's what.
That's the content.

172
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,620
So that is that alone right there.
It's pretty crazy.

173
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,310
And those Arizona Arizona Lights,
I mean people saying there's,

174
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,500
I don't know how many witnesses,
but

175
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:12,130
the Arizona life's pretty crazy.
I know a dude who lives in Arizona saw 

176
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:12,130
that.
He said he saw the fucking,

177
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:15,620
the big pyramid thing flying through the
air and they sang.

178
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:20,300
It's like bigger than a aircraft carrier
football field.

179
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,670
He said it was gigantic.
You said it was a gigantic,

180
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:25,600
big pyramid shaped thing flying to 
Scotland.

181
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,890
Who the fuck knows,
you know,

182
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,130
my,
my take on Ufo.

183
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,450
Um,
they've been really were aliens that 

184
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,741
could come here from another planet.
What do you think that there will be so 

185
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:37,340
silly that they would,
they wouldn't disguise themselves.

186
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:42,460
I think a lot of the shit we see all the
time could be Ufo as I told you about 

187
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,630
that crazy dude that told me that,
uh,

188
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,700
he was showing me pictures of clouds.
There's a dude that I know is a 

189
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,230
comedian,
is a very nice guy and uh,

190
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,350
the other day,
uh,

191
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:54,980
I'm talking to him at the Improv and a 
homeboy says,

192
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,030
what do you think about Ufo?

193
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,910
And I said,
well,

194
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,810
you know,
hey man,

195
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,310
uh,
I don't know.

196
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:02,010
I haven't seen one,
but I don't discount the idea.

197
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,040
I mean it's certainly possible.
Obviously we have spaceships and for 

198
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,070
someone from other planets,
if they're more intelligent than us,

199
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:13,071
for sure they could have space ships.
So he starts pulling on his iphone and 

200
00:09:13,071 --> 00:09:16,650
the dude has like dozens of pictures of 
clouds on his phone.

201
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,120
And I'm,
I'm like,

202
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,690
what,
what does that,

203
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,280
what do you think about this?
We'll get this right there,

204
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,440
and I go to cloud.
And he goes,

205
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:24,540
yeah,
but it's an unusually shaped cloud.

206
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,800
Look at it.
And I'm like,

207
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,050
oh no,
he's crazy.

208
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,030
I'm like,
he's fucking crazy.

209
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,390
This dude takes pictures of clouds,
all different clouds.

210
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,570
And he's convinced that these clouds are
Ufos.

211
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,650
But at one point on one hand you've got 
to think like if you really are so 

212
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,590
superintelligent that you can visit from
other planets,

213
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,150
why would you,
you know,

214
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,240
for sure we're working on cloaking 
devices right now.

215
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:53,370
There is already this Japanese jacket 
that's been invented that basically 

216
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,780
takes an image of what's behind you and 
broadcast it on the front of the jacket.

217
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,020
It's basically like Predator type shit.
You remember from the movie the 

218
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,600
Predator.
And they really have this already.

219
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,920
I mean it's not perfected,
but we can't travel to other planets yet

220
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:08,970
either.
You know what I'm saying?

221
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,030
So if someone from another planet is so 
much more highly intelligent than we 

222
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,841
are,
that they can actually travel here from 

223
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:18,780
other galaxies are or older other solar 
systems for sure.

224
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,500
They've figured something like this out.
So when you're seeing the sky,

225
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,450
I mean,
it's very possible,

226
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,480
you know that what you're seeing is if,
if there are Ufo as you would see an 

227
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,170
image of the sky behind the behind the 
UFL being projected onto you.

228
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,770
So you wouldn't see shit,
you know,

229
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,800
that said you,
if you could take into account how many 

230
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Ufos are reported.
I mean,

231
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,550
it's like there's some ridiculous amount
of,

232
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,580
of Ufo is reported and if you take into 
account how many people see and don't 

233
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:51,621
report,
they don't say anything because they 

234
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:51,621
want to look foolish.
You know,

235
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:51,621
that's a,
that's a lot of Goddamn Ufo.

236
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:56,130
False.
I think a lot of what people are seeing 

237
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:56,220
is military jets that they don't 
understand.

238
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,560
Like when I was in,
um,

239
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:02,630
we did fear factor down near Edwards air
force base and they had stealth bombers 

240
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,630
flew up.
Dude,

241
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,190
you,
you see a stealth bomber.

242
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:06,630
You think that's a goddamn space.
Yet,

243
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,740
yeah,
the French government did a test with 

244
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:11,740
some.
There was a serious,

245
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,500
a review of all the.
There's like 50,000

246
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,690
or something,
something 50,000

247
00:11:17,691 --> 00:11:20,780
since certain year there's probably way 
more,

248
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,080
but they came to the conclusion that I'm
95 percent of reported cases can be 

249
00:11:28,401 --> 00:11:30,550
explained away with that,
like military others,

250
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,660
high ranking military or this top secret
military planes and different lights,

251
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,780
but they said five percent,
most likely our aircraft from other 

252
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:42,470
worlds.

253
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:47,900
Well,
I don't know why they can say aircraft 

254
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:47,900
from other worlds because I don't 
necessarily think we have a.

255
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,010
it's more likely to take inventory of 
what exists in this moment.

256
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:54,190
They're saying they're saying that 
that's

257
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,640
probably what that is.
More of.

258
00:11:55,641 --> 00:11:59,090
The more likely it's some 
extraterrestrial craft then.

259
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,120
I mean they got.
There's five percent of it.

260
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:06,121
Just because it's not from our 
government or the Russian government 

261
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:07,650
doesn't necessarily mean even as from 
another planet.

262
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,120
We don't know what the fuck is in the 
ocean.

263
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,550
No,
no,

264
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,640
no.
It's a lot of Ufo is get cited.

265
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,130
Called.
There was a whole a history channel 

266
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,130
documentary about that and people go,
well,

267
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,240
that's ridiculous.
That's nonsense.

268
00:12:19,241 --> 00:12:24,241
That's silly.
It's silly that you can set a fucking 

269
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:26,490
picture that you could take this fucking
thing and send a video across the sky 

270
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:32,161
into somebody else's phone in Australia.
That's way more silly than some people 

271
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:36,421
from another planet have visited here or
that there's something living in the 

272
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:36,421
ocean,

273
00:12:36,421 --> 00:12:38,860
especially when you have guys like x 
Pentagon,

274
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,980
high ranking officials like Philip 
Corso,

275
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:46,000
who before he died,
he wrote a book and he explained his job

276
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:50,500
in the government in the Pentagon was 
taking crashed ufo stuff,

277
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,740
taking it to like a Hughes aircraft and 
Lockheed and all these different 

278
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,750
aerospace companies to reverse engineer.
He's saying he was like,

279
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,470
there's many interviews on youtube with 
Philip course.

280
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,250
He's dead now.
He was on dateline and they try to like,

281
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,990
ridicule,
but you know,

282
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:08,920
um,
how do you.

283
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,500
J Dot Allen Hynek too is another 
excellent example that jail.

284
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:16,501
And Hank was the guy who was in charge 
of project blue book and he was told to 

285
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:18,670
by the government when they had this 
thing to explain away everything,

286
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:20,440
swamp gas,
you know,

287
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:25,441
a mass hysteria,
anything they could do to explain away 

288
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:28,860
ufo cases,
but as he became more involved in 

289
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,890
project blue book and as he investigated
more and more sightings and you know,

290
00:13:30,891 --> 00:13:35,891
and dealt with more and more evidence,
he became absolutely convinced that you 

291
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:35,891
have.
Those were real.

292
00:13:35,891 --> 00:13:37,570
So Jay Allen Hynek,
who was,

293
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,600
you know,
a guy actually working to discredit ufo 

294
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,270
eventually came out and started a 
supporting the whole Ufo movement.

295
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:48,130
So I think it's,
it's not,

296
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,320
it's not ridiculous to think that we've 
been visited.

297
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:53,290
I mean we go to the Congo all the time 
and stare at chimpanzees,

298
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:58,390
you know,
I mean if you were from another planet 

299
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:58,390
and you had the ability to travel here,
why wouldn't you check out people?

300
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,980
People are fucking completely 
ridiculous.

301
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,990
They're probably fascinating.
I mean,

302
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:04,840
what would be more.
We studied lower forms of animals.

303
00:14:04,841 --> 00:14:09,841
We always have.
And we have been doing this since the 

304
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:09,841
beginning of time.
I mean,

305
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:13,591
people,
people have always been interested in 

306
00:14:13,591 --> 00:14:16,350
botany and we've always been interested 
in studying different monkeys and in 

307
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:21,631
different weird animals and other.
I mean that's the whole thing with 

308
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:21,631
Darwin,
you know,

309
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:21,631
he took a,
you know,

310
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,840
it took a,
an account of all these different 

311
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,461
animals that he came across.
We've always done shit like that and I 

312
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:31,480
think if we were a much higher 
intelligence than human beings,

313
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,970
we would want to do that with people 
would want to check out and see what the

314
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,030
fuck people are up to see if people are 
evolving,

315
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,040
see what the bottleneck is as far as 
like social and cultural evolution and 

316
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,411
see what the bottleneck is as far as 
technological evolution and whether or 

317
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:50,101
not our technology is surpassing our,
our ability as a human being like too to

318
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,530
make rational decisions.
And I think it probably is right now.

319
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,940
You know,
they just fired up the large Hadron 

320
00:14:59,940 --> 00:14:59,940
collider yesterday.
You know,

321
00:14:59,940 --> 00:14:59,960
yesterday was the first test

322
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,300
north who is watching,

323
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:10,630
what is that equal out too?
I think that looks like a nail due to 

324
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,080
reno.
I don't know,

325
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,390
it looks like a whole hot to,
you don't know a hot is a,

326
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,920
is a Portuguese Brazilian guy say pull 
out all the time.

327
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,830
It's like,
it sort of means like fuck or balls.

328
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,180
It means like a bunch of different 
things.

329
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:29,060
They say it all the time.
Ms Dot bawls.

330
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,560
I think it just a budges yeah,
yeah.

331
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,770
I heard a bunch of different 
translations,

332
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,680
but to me too is the fighting vampire,
you know what I mean?

333
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,630
Is a famous bar,
gracie black belt and um,

334
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,010
I guess he looks like Dracula or 
something.

335
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:50,450
So I called him last.
He's the Brazilian vampire.

336
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:56,640
That's funny.
Am I not going to accommodate?

337
00:15:56,641 --> 00:15:57,780
Yeah,
I'm going to compensate.

338
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,110
That shit's in the.
I'm going to leave in a half an hour.

339
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,320
We're chilling here in the hotel room.
We're getting ready to go down there and

340
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:04,950
commentate.
Yeah.

341
00:16:04,951 --> 00:16:07,590
I'm like,
what do I think about scientology?

342
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:12,650
I think it's awesome if you're gay and 
you want to cover it up and they're 

343
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,340
really good at that shit.
It's all nonsense.

344
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,950
All,
all religions are nonsense.

345
00:16:16,951 --> 00:16:18,210
You know?
You know,

346
00:16:18,211 --> 00:16:21,990
just as much as I know as far as like 
what happens when you die.

347
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:22,830
No one knows.

348
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,620
I didn't let you know what.
I think religion is awesome if you do it

349
00:16:27,621 --> 00:16:28,980
right,
if you do it right,

350
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,590
if you do the right thing and help your 
neighbors.

351
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,740
Like my grandma was hardcore Catholic 
and I wouldn't try to convince her like 

352
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,590
if she was still allowed to get out of 
that,

353
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:42,591
she was doing.
She was going to church every day and 

354
00:16:42,591 --> 00:16:43,050
that praying is like meditating.
She was meditating.

355
00:16:43,051 --> 00:16:46,380
So I think just like having the healthy 
heart.

356
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,240
You could.
Some people can do kettlebells,

357
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,850
some people could run on a treadmill,
some people run stairs,

358
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,940
some people do martial arts.
That's for a healthy heart and it all 

359
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,070
works.
And I think religion,

360
00:16:56,071 --> 00:17:01,071
whether you're doing the Jesus or the 
ally or the Buddha or meditation or 

361
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:02,310
yoga,
it doesn't really matter.

362
00:17:02,311 --> 00:17:06,570
As long as you get your frequency at the
right spot with the universe.

363
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,370
It doesn't matter if you do the Jesus 
thing,

364
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:10,530
you know?
So I think that.

365
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:12,870
I think you're right.
I think whatever you,

366
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,940
whatever it gets you in that right 
frequency,

367
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,500
you can worship your iphone.
If you actually believe that and you can

368
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:22,590
meditate to your iphone,
I think the universe don't give a fuck.

369
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,620
They're like,
how are you going to get to our 

370
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:27,620
frequency?
That's all that.

371
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,260
My real problem is people.
The real problem is the same.

372
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,050
Do you know what it is?
It's the same thing when whenever,

373
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,240
when someone believes in something,
even if they believe in something 

374
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,641
completely irrational,
they want everyone else to believe in 

375
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:38,820
it,
to everyone else to be on their team.

376
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,970
That's why like if you ever talked to 
people that use windows and they find 

377
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,160
out that you use Mac and they're like,
what the fuck man,

378
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:49,161
I use Mac for faggots and then he crazy 
like they want you to use windows and 

379
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:50,100
it's like want you to be

380
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,560
Muslim?
They want you to be a scientologist.

381
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:54,630
They want you to be a Catholic.
You know,

382
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,450
that's the real problem is that people 
want you to,

383
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,770
to

384
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:58,190
two

385
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,380
subscribed to their ideology,
but the idea behind it,

386
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:04,450
you know,
being a better person and you know,

387
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,290
and treating everybody as if they're 
yourself and you know that all that,

388
00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:09,730
that's the way to go.
I mean,

389
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:14,731
it really is,
but the fucking handing out the basket 

390
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:14,731
and fucking kids and all that other shit
that,

391
00:18:14,731 --> 00:18:16,780
you know,
involved in relationships with kids.

392
00:18:16,781 --> 00:18:20,470
I have to admit I'm not into that.
I'm against that.

393
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,110
I saw that deliver us from evil.
They recommended.

394
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,150
Come on.
He recommended this documentary and you 

395
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:28,150
guys should check it out to.
It's called deliver us from evil.

396
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,090
If you want to find out how fucked up 
the Catholic Church really is.

397
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,490
Oh my God.
Is this incredible?

398
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,630
Yeah.
Well,

399
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:39,631
I couldn't watch the whole thing.
I've watched about an hour and 10 

400
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:42,331
minutes to get to the point where it 
turns out that guy's done like hundreds 

401
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:42,331
of kids.

402
00:18:42,331 --> 00:18:43,300
Yeah.
I couldn't take it.

403
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,680
I wanted to kill him.
I,

404
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,740
I mean,
it's,

405
00:18:45,741 --> 00:18:50,741
it's really a really sick,
sick documentary about this priest who 

406
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:54,800
is responsible for molesting hundreds of
kids and you know,

407
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,690
they covered it up.
They kept moving on,

408
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:58,860
they moved them all over the country and
uh,

409
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,790
really it's incredible.
And that's what's going on right now.

410
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,060
That gigantic scandal that's happening 
right now with the pope.

411
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,510
The pope had knowledge of all this 
fucking shit that was going on.

412
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,830
There's so many pedophiles,
not all pedophiles.

413
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,890
I bet they're all pedophiles because it 
was just because it was,

414
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:22,670
if it was just,
if it was half of them or a quarter 

415
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,140
home,
there would be busting each other out.

416
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,280
They would,
there would be people coming forward 

417
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:28,280
saying,
we've got to stop this shit.

418
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,890
They're all covering each other's asses.
I mean,

419
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:34,891
think about it there.
They chose a job where they can get any 

420
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:34,891
pussy.

421
00:19:34,891 --> 00:19:35,540
Well,
the whole idea,

422
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,650
you know what I mean?
That's got to drive you insane.

423
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,660
And anybody who accepts a job where you 
can get laid that you gotta be fucked up

424
00:19:43,371 --> 00:19:44,570
already.
You already got.

425
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,870
And I think my,
my theory is that when these guys grow 

426
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,030
up gay,
they're relieved,

427
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,130
they're grown up in a religious home.
That.

428
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,050
And then once they find out they're gay,
they realize,

429
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,090
Oh shit,
maybe Satan is inside of me.

430
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,860
I got these gay feelings.
Oh my God,

431
00:19:58,010 --> 00:19:58,920
I gotta fight.
Same.

432
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,640
So they become ultra religious,
ultra Catholic,

433
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,790
and then they're trying to prove to God 
that they're going to fight the gay.

434
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,900
They're gonna devote their life to God.
They become a priest and then Bam,

435
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,990
they hold it together for years.
And then they lose it.

436
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,700
You ever seen that video?
God hates fags.

437
00:20:13,701 --> 00:20:14,780
No.
The Guy who,

438
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:19,781
uh,
who's a gay guy who was singing about 

439
00:20:19,781 --> 00:20:19,781
being Christian,
never seen that going to sign that shit.

440
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,320
You know what I gotta get the fuck out 
of here.

441
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,380
I got to leave my man.
We don't have to leave for 20 minutes.

442
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,730
We leave the shower stuff.
Yeah.

443
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:27,980
But the fights don't even start for more
than hour.

444
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,230
And I got to get my hair did.
Come on,

445
00:20:30,231 --> 00:20:30,600
man.
You're here.

446
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:35,601
It looks like you got to check this out 
and people don't get to see you on 

447
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:35,601
Youtube.
How long it takes to blow dry my hair.

448
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,080
Know how much you don't have to wash it 
here.

449
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,570
Ten minutes.
Now.

450
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,560
Got to find this video because it's so 
ridiculous.

451
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,980
It's a dude who's a gay dude who's 
fighting

452
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,440
against it and he says,
Jesus is the only man for me.

453
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,120
It's just genius.
Hold on.

454
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:58,710
It's like A.
Those guys at Bora Bora Bora bought 

455
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,190
Bruno fucks with God.
Hates fags on it's real.

456
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,010
This is a real song.
You have to see this because it's so god

457
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,030
damn genius.

458
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,410
This guy was the guy.
Here it is.

459
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,080
This is a real soft.

460
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,110
First of all,
his mustache.

461
00:21:20,111 --> 00:21:21,160
A lot.
Hold on,

462
00:21:21,161 --> 00:21:26,161
let me put this up to you guys.
I just put it up on twitter.

463
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,890
It's so stem.
He'll come on.

464
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:12,810
We'll look at the fucking mustache.
That's the proof is real.

465
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,150
This is a real fucking.
Sorry man.

466
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,370
This is so real.
Christian guy came in through the five 

467
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:49,460
senses that we have is it's just not put
together.

468
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:09,700
You've got to go find and put all the 
parts together,

469
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,200
but the world has,
you know,

470
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:28,020
how these feelings,
the helmet Razah bar and help them hear 

471
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:34,940
me.
It's fucking mustache.

472
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,270
To be a gay dude and be religious and to
think that God hates you.

473
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,650
You can always be afraid if you haven't 
seen that video,

474
00:23:57,651 --> 00:24:00,770
you got to watch it because it's 
completely ridiculous and by the way,

475
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:03,480
totally real.
You know the fucking dude is a,

476
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,380
is a gay guy who converted to 
Christianity and he's like,

477
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,140
you know,
try to tell people the right way to go.

478
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,680
Wow.

479
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,760
It's pretty awesome.
It's pretty awesome stuff.

480
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,110
Where's your lighter?
Yeah,

481
00:24:19,111 --> 00:24:19,980
put it up in the air,
Bro.

482
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,510
Well,
as get lighter considered.

483
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,800
Do we watch tim and Eric?
Yeah,

484
00:24:25,801 --> 00:24:26,000
man.

485
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Tim and Eric Rocks.
That's probably top three favorite 

486
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:31,190
shows.
Not In celebrity rehab.

487
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,840
That fucking thing.
A dance floor.

488
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:36,640
Dale,
if you haven't seen that,

489
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,910
go do a google search for dance floor.
Dale is got to be one of the funniest 

490
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,180
fucking videos I've ever seen in my 
life.

491
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,060
The weirdest,
funniest things on the Internet ever.

492
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,680
Dance floor,
Dale,

493
00:24:47,681 --> 00:24:49,000
you gotta.
See this gotTa,

494
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,050
find it,
find it.

495
00:24:50,051 --> 00:24:51,250
It's online,
it's on my website.

496
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,840
You can find it on Joe Rogan.net

497
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,120
season three of 10 minute Erica,
because they keep having recurring 

498
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,680
sketches and they just get funnier and 
funnier the more the more developed.

499
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,940
Here's a good question for you.
What does Damien Maia and his Jujitsu 

500
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,911
bring to the table that latest didn't?
Versus Silva because Damien Maia is 

501
00:25:09,911 --> 00:25:11,810
fighting Anderson Silva next month and 
Abu Dhabi next week.

502
00:25:11,811 --> 00:25:13,760
Dude,
I have a dummy next week.

503
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:18,860
I think Damien Maia is a better guard.
Poorer the Talus does talus would pull 

504
00:25:18,871 --> 00:25:20,430
guard,
but he wouldn't clench up first.

505
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:22,160
So you know,
filter doesn't.

506
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:27,250
It's not going to just fall in.
You got to really shoot deep with an 

507
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,060
under hook and you've got to make the 
guy sprawl and if he doesn't sprawl,

508
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,760
you know,
because you didn't take a deep shot,

509
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,800
you're not going to pull them into your 
garden.

510
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:37,140
David Maya likes to shoot deep and pull 
guard.

511
00:25:37,141 --> 00:25:42,141
I think that'll be the difference.
There's no way he's going to stand with 

512
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:42,141
Anderson Silva,
you know,

513
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:46,340
just based on,
not just based on Anderson Silva's 

514
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,161
career and what he's done,
but based on his last fight where he 

515
00:25:49,161 --> 00:25:51,390
tried to stand for a little bit with 
Nate Marquardt and he,

516
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,420
he's going to pull guard immediately.
Trust me.

517
00:25:53,421 --> 00:25:55,030
He's not going to fuck around anymore.

518
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,650
That shit.
I hope that's true,

519
00:25:56,651 --> 00:25:58,780
but I didn't think he was going to try 
to stand with nate either.

520
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,330
Well,
they stood with them for one punch and 

521
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:04,330
that was just one punch too long and 
he's not going to.

522
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,610
He's training with vandelay and vandelay
brawler,

523
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,860
you know,
do you think that,

524
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:12,861
uh,
that style of getting in there and just 

525
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:12,861
mixing it up and get ugly,
just not,

526
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:17,700
it's not a good style for a guy who was 
not very technically proficient 

527
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:17,700
instruction,
striking,

528
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,820
you know,
he's just so good on the ground.

529
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:23,480
Why give your opponent any kind of 
chance,

530
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:29,050
especially Anderson Silva,
what are you going to try and mix it up 

531
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,050
a little bit with them?
That's a big fucking mistake.

532
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,780
He's gonna.
He's gonna.

533
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Pull guard immediately.
Trust me or try to take them down 

534
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:34,960
because,
you know,

535
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,580
Anderson Silva isn't some NCAA national 
champion or anything,

536
00:26:37,581 --> 00:26:40,910
so I'm sure Damien Maia is really going 
to take a shot for real,

537
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,200
for real,
trying to take them down.

538
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,700
But if he has any trouble he will pull 
guard.

539
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,740
No problem.
I guarantee that.

540
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,090
Yeah,
we've definitely seen Anderson been 

541
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:52,860
taken down before it got taken down many
times by um,

542
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,210
uh,
travis luder now Travis Luder probably 

543
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:58,210
had the most success.
But you gotta think about that fight.

544
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:03,071
Travis luder fought Anderson 11 weeks 
after Anderson had knee surgery on both 

545
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:07,601
knees,
so that probably wasn't the best 

546
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:07,601
representation of his,
his,

547
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:11,650
his wrestling.
Then Dan Henderson took them down as 

548
00:27:11,650 --> 00:27:14,411
well and when Dan Henderson took him 
down because he wasn't able to do 

549
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:14,490
anything to let me just kind of like 
held them down on the ground,

550
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,850
punched him a few times but really 
couldn't get anything going.

551
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,380
No.
So that's the big question is,

552
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,330
is Anderson's Jujitsu good enough to 
stifle a Damien Maia?

553
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,350
Because Damien Meyer had a hard time 
with Dan Miller and his last fight 

554
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:28,350
really couldn't get anything going with 
them.

555
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:30,190
I mean he grounded,
pounded him and you know,

556
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,200
he'd beat them by decision but never 
came close to finishing with a 

557
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:35,200
submission.
No,

558
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,520
no.
And I think Dan Miller is a real good,

559
00:27:37,521 --> 00:27:42,521
real tough guy,
but I think Anderson's Jujitsu is at 

560
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:45,310
least as good as millers.
I mean on paper at least he's a black 

561
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:45,310
belt

562
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:47,760
mothers of Rambo.
But Miller has wrestled his whole life.

563
00:27:47,761 --> 00:27:52,761
There's a big difference.
That's a different kind of animal when 

564
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:52,761
you're grappling with a real legit 
wrestler.

565
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,920
And Anderson Silva has long limbs.
I like going with guys that have long 

566
00:27:58,111 --> 00:27:59,330
arms.
It's hard.

567
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,150
Rubber guards a lot easier with taller 
guys.

568
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,640
It's harder for them to pull out of 
anything.

569
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,140
I have long arms like the small one,
45 short five foot five,

570
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:15,230
stocky wrestler types.
That's hard to get any rubber guard on 

571
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:15,230
because they popped their arms out 
there,

572
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,050
you know,
out so easily.

573
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,910
They're really small.
So I think,

574
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:20,040
uh,
I think David Maya is going to have more

575
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:22,500
success with his Jujitsu,
with,

576
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:25,290
with Anderson Silva.
If he gets him to the ground then he did

577
00:28:25,291 --> 00:28:28,170
with Miller because Miller again,
he's only a brown belt,

578
00:28:28,171 --> 00:28:29,700
but damn,
he wrestled his whole life.

579
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:30,490
That's,
that's,

580
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,600
that's a different kind of animal right 
there.

581
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,500
A chimpanzee

582
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,030
think about Anderson is that Anderson 
has had elbow problems for years.

583
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,300
He's said a bone chunks floating around 
his elbow that may training really 

584
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,441
difficult.
He would have to ice his elbows after 

585
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:51,411
training.
Sometimes it couldn't do any weight 

586
00:28:51,411 --> 00:28:51,450
lifting and strength and conditioning 
because it's elbows hurt.

587
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,420
He finally got all that shit fixed.
You've got the elbow chunks,

588
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:59,540
the piece of bone taken out.
So we're going to see an Anderson Silva 

589
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,060
that's in a better condition than we've 
seen him in a long,

590
00:29:00,061 --> 00:29:05,061
long time.
He's at a problem throwing his right 

591
00:29:05,061 --> 00:29:05,061
hand because of it,
which is really hard to believe when you

592
00:29:05,061 --> 00:29:09,351
see his fights.
Big Country Nelson went tonight by fat 

593
00:29:10,141 --> 00:29:11,520
mission.
How dare you?

594
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,810
Let me tell you something,
man.

595
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:15,240
Fat.
A big guy like Roy Nelson,

596
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,880
he that waits centralized in his 
stomach.

597
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:21,570
He knows that a hold you with that shit 
that can keep you in a certain position.

598
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:23,760
He's really good at keeping his weight 
on you.

599
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,260
We have a dude that we trained with 
Brent grandkids inside control.

600
00:29:28,261 --> 00:29:33,261
Man,
that motherfucker is really hard to get 

601
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:33,261
off you and he's built similar to big 
country,

602
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:36,000
not as fat,
but he's got a big gut and you know,

603
00:29:36,001 --> 00:29:39,420
and he's talented as well.
He's a good Jujitsu guy and when he gets

604
00:29:39,421 --> 00:29:41,830
on top of you and you know he gets a 
good position on you,

605
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:47,040
is really hard to shake them off you.
He plants that weight down on you and 

606
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,511
holds you in place and big country.
If I had to guess what's gonna Happen 

607
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:51,511
Tonight?
What's truth?

608
00:29:51,511 --> 00:29:55,480
You know,
I would say that big contract he gets 

609
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:55,480
them down to ground is going to be a lot
of trouble.

610
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,320
Oh yeah,
yeah,

611
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,230
yeah.
But struve has a lot of potential.

612
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,460
He might be,
he might be the underdog in this fight.

613
00:30:02,461 --> 00:30:07,461
He probably should be based on his 
experience and is really young and 

614
00:30:07,461 --> 00:30:09,250
country's been grappling for a long time
and he's really good on the ground.

615
00:30:09,251 --> 00:30:11,150
People haven't really seen that.
He likes to stand in back,

616
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,630
but country Nelson's really good on the 
ground.

617
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,040
Really good.
Really good.

618
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,310
Frank Mir,
was it like 11?

619
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,840
Nothing in a submission,
man.

620
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,660
Yeah.
He's really.

621
00:30:19,661 --> 00:30:22,840
He's got a great half guard game too.
We just haven't really seen it.

622
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:28,110
But true in the long run has so much 
potential.

623
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,740
I mean that guy that's like,
he's like 26,

624
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:35,590
eight or something like that.
He's super tall and he loves Jujitsu.

625
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:40,650
You never see that.
You never see tall guys like that who 

626
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:40,930
were athletic and coordinated.
Love Jujitsu.

627
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:42,610
I mean you've seen.
We've seen 70 shell.

628
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:44,720
He didn't like Jiu Jitsu.
Um,

629
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,900
I don't know what other tall guy,
but you know,

630
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:51,901
random ran a Kendall grove.
That's another tall guy who likes to 

631
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:55,080
Jitsu,
but he was true if he continues to 

632
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:59,761
evolve and,
and remains a student of the game and 

633
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:02,611
everything,
of course striking and wrestling as 

634
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:02,611
well.
But in Jujitsu,

635
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,880
the way he's moving and you know,
we've talked several times about a 

636
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,820
Jujitsu and strategy and philosophies 
and stuff,

637
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,030
and he's on the right track.
He's that he,

638
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,080
he,
you know,

639
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,140
I don't,
I don't know if we can be country at 

640
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,140
this point in his career.
Maybe,

641
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,890
maybe not,
but get that guy another five,

642
00:31:17,891 --> 00:31:18,910
six,
seven years,

643
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,020
if it continues to evolve,
he can be a serious threat with that.

644
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,660
Would that height his guard could be 
insane.

645
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:30,850
Yeah.
And he decided to be a Ninja office 

646
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,600
back.
Fuck is only 22.

647
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:35,060
That's the other thing about that kid.
He's real young.

648
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,550
He's got a massive,
massive amount of time ahead of him,

649
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,040
you know,
and a lot of potential.

650
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:44,041
And he's got crazy heart.
Remember in Germany when you got cut 

651
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:44,041
wide open.
I was bleeding all over the place.

652
00:31:44,041 --> 00:31:48,881
And who did you fight that fight?
He got in trouble and you got cut real 

653
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:52,120
bad and he still pulled it out and one 
of submitting the dudes.

654
00:31:52,121 --> 00:31:54,410
So it was uh,
it was pretty bad ass.

655
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,930
Do another youth stream tonight.
Maybe.

656
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,980
Maybe we will get back to the hotel,
it'll be late here and I don't go to bed

657
00:32:00,981 --> 00:32:03,650
until late on the west coast,
so it will be early for me.

658
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,820
So yeah,
we can do that.

659
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:07,640
We could come after the after party and 
do it,

660
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,620
do it.
Non Sober,

661
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,100
sober version of the dream because I got
to go do the broadcast and right now go 

662
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,630
me or Ken Flo,
who the fuck knows sun?

663
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,840
That's why they got to do it.
I think it's exciting having gotten me 

664
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:22,840
over here.
I would have liked to see them over here

665
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,630
years ago,
but,

666
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,990
you know,
he's still young and he's got a lot to 

667
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:28,990
prove,
you know,

668
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:29,090
and I think uh,
he's training real hard.

669
00:32:29,091 --> 00:32:32,390
He looked really in real good shape and 
he's saying all the right things that he

670
00:32:32,391 --> 00:32:37,391
wants to really make another run and get
another run at Bj Penn and he's 

671
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:38,630
obviously got to get through Tennessee 
to do that.

672
00:32:38,631 --> 00:32:40,070
So I think going to be real interesting.

673
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,680
He's a solid wrestler and there's a big 
power puncher,

674
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,940
you know,
he hits hard.

675
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:44,860
So,
uh,

676
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,690
I think Kenny's going to try to use his 
legs.

677
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,900
He Kenny's got real good leg kicks,
real good movement.

678
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,330
He's going gonna try to use his 
footwork,

679
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,390
working with leg kicks,
and then if it goes to the ground,

680
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,310
who tried to submit them and cut them up
with elbows.

681
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:03,460
The thing about Gomez Gomez has not 
fought anybody ever with the elbow 

682
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:03,920
rules.
You know,

683
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:06,410
elbows are different man,
especially the cage,

684
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:08,270
you know,
cage and elbows,

685
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,420
you know,
those are two totally different things 

686
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,821
that he's never experienced before.
So it's going to be going to be 

687
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:15,821
interesting.
That'll be interesting.

688
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:15,821
And Kenny,
man,

689
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:16,610
he gets better every time.

690
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:20,340
I gotta get Outta here guys.
I gotta get ready to shower.

691
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,530
You got to leave in 10 minutes.
Thank you very much.

692
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,650
I'll do this again.
Come over my house and we'll do a full 

693
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:29,770
version.
All.

694
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,730
Alright.
You want to leave with us?

695
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:36,820
You know what?
I'm going to just take my own car and 

696
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,520
got the rental.
I'll see you in 10 minutes.

697
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,430
No,
5:15.

698
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,540
It's only four or five right now.
Ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:47,540
And then

700
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,750
finally were alone.
So that's the story I got to leave in 10

701
00:33:53,761 --> 00:33:54,570
minutes,
so I should,

702
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,220
I should uh,
get my shit going.

703
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,160
Yeah.
I wanted to do just a little shell 

704
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,911
because I couldn't do one last week 
because I had a staph infection that I 

705
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:04,560
had to deal with so I didn't fucking 
die.

706
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,540
That's the problem with Jujitsu,
man.

707
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:11,630
You know,
you role with 30 motherfuckers and get 

708
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:11,630
weird skin shit,
you know,

709
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:13,530
we're diseases.
I know a to got herpes on his head.

710
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,760
What?
Yeah,

711
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:19,440
you can get a,
you can get herpes from Jujitsu.

712
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:24,650
Not Good.
The deal with me getting a Sirius radio 

713
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:25,800
show,
I'm going to do a weekly show.

714
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:30,890
Uh,
I think I'm going to do like a six week 

715
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:31,250
run,
a trial run and it's all dependent on my

716
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,760
scheduling because,
uh,

717
00:34:32,761 --> 00:34:34,950
I just signed a deal to write a book.

718
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:40,310
I've been writing it for awhile but 
they've been negotiating a deal and we 

719
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:40,770
finally got the right deal.
And um,

720
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,120
I was in New York last week and I met 
with the publishers and they came out to

721
00:34:45,121 --> 00:34:47,310
see me when I performed at Gotham.
So,

722
00:34:47,311 --> 00:34:52,311
uh,
I got a nice deal and I'm getting ready 

723
00:34:52,311 --> 00:34:53,460
and the deal is that I have to finish 
the book by August,

724
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:54,240
so,
uh,

725
00:34:54,241 --> 00:34:59,241
I'm going to be guns blazing trying to 
write this thing and finish it and most 

726
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:01,480
of the stories it's going to be mostly 
about my,

727
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,530
uh,
the beginning days of doing standup 

728
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,871
because I have so many crazy stories 
about bad road gigs and just struggling 

729
00:35:09,031 --> 00:35:14,031
on the road and you know,
what it's like to be an really an 

730
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:15,090
amateur comedian trying to,
you know,

731
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,610
go out there and get people to laugh for
money and you know,

732
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:22,660
and how fucking crazy it is and how 
unsure it is and how you really have no 

733
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,840
idea if it's ever going to work out and 
you feel,

734
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,000
you know,
it's a completely insecure.

735
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,060
You know,
you feel like there's no way this is 

736
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,220
ever going to really turn out to be a 
career and how nutty some of the fucking

737
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,150
gigs I've done.
Well,

738
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:40,490
why wasn't you at weigh yesterday?
I don't even think I'm going to answer 

739
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:40,790
that just because it's so retardedly 
Britain.

740
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,530
Uh,
but if somebody else asks if I'll answer

741
00:35:43,531 --> 00:35:48,531
it two ways because I didn't get any 
time I got on my flight,

742
00:35:48,721 --> 00:35:53,721
didn't lend until 4:00,
so they had Goldberg dual the weigh ins 

743
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:54,010
and then,
uh,

744
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:56,120
I had my show last night.
Yeah,

745
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:59,820
because we were in New York and then I 
flew back from New York Sunday.

746
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,710
I had Monday to stay home with my family
and then Tuesday flew out again.

747
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:10,430
So unless I'd stayed here in Charlotte,
there was no way really I was going to 

748
00:36:10,430 --> 00:36:11,910
be able to get to the weigh ins.
But no,

749
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,270
I didn't.

750
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,880
I didn't really,
uh,

751
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:19,050
this as too much traveling.
I need to be home at least a couple of 

752
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:22,400
days a week.
Otherwise I go nutty when you have 

753
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,400
babies,
man,

754
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,400
who just can't wait to go home and see 
him,

755
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,920
you know.
Um,

756
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,740
how's hardees?
Hardees fine.

757
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,870
Hardy didn't have any problems.
There was nothing wrong with them.

758
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,010
I can't believe it.
Uh,

759
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,450
you know,
his shoulder,

760
00:36:30,451 --> 00:36:32,250
his arms,
you know,

761
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,540
uh,
I think,

762
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:38,630
uh,
George St Pierre didn't quite have the 

763
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:38,630
arm bar.
Right.

764
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:38,630
But,
uh,

765
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,340
the Camorra there was one point in time,
the more I thought it was just going to 

766
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,340
rip off.
I mean it looked,

767
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:48,020
it looked pretty bad.
Bring back some chicks from the after 

768
00:36:49,831 --> 00:36:51,340
party at least.
No,

769
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,810
I can't do that anymore.
I made babies and I made it,

770
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,270
made a wife and all that.
All that shit.

771
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,230
When I do want to show the zs Enzo 
Ferrari,

772
00:37:01,231 --> 00:37:03,030
I don't know him,
but I think,

773
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,890
yeah,
I think he's on that show.

774
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:07,650
The Kevin being sure that I'm doing this
weekend,

775
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,730
April foolishness.
I think it's,

776
00:37:11,010 --> 00:37:13,200
it's either Friday or Saturday night,
one of those.

777
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,060
I'm not sure which I'll tell you right 
now.

778
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:19,890
Salary.

779
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:27,950
Yeah.
Saturday.

780
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:33,430
Except the Gibson amphitheater and 
universal and I'm pretty sure it's way 

781
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,220
sold out.
Those guys always sell out their shows.

782
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,040
It's a really good line up to a lot,
a lot of funny comedians.

783
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,950
I did it last year with Patton Oswald.
Did it.

784
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,920
Raven Ray Romano.
Patton Oswald.

785
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:44,550
Jeff Ross.
Uh,

786
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,210
a bunch of good guys.
I know Jeff's on it again this year.

787
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:48,910
I think Jay Morris out again this year 
too.

788
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,600
Is error.
Yani,

789
00:37:52,601 --> 00:37:54,500
hot or what?
She's hot,

790
00:37:54,501 --> 00:37:56,750
if you're not gay,
if you're gay,

791
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,810
she's probably not the buffer.
Three 60 tonight.

792
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,340
I think he said he would never do that 
again.

793
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:06,670
I think he said the buffer three is 
going to retire and to put that shit in 

794
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:06,800
the books,
it's over Sun.

795
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:13,150
What do I think about crop circles?
I think they're incredible geometric 

796
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,090
patterns when they're not humans made 
him.

797
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,780
Who the fuck knows,
you know,

798
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,890
I mean,
there's a lot of people that argue that 

799
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:23,051
it's impossible for people to make them 
that they've know three times the size 

800
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,741
of a football field and they appear 
overnight and they were in perfect 

801
00:38:26,741 --> 00:38:27,950
geometric patterns and circles and 
everything.

802
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:30,260
I don't know know.
I think it's very intriguing,

803
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:35,670
you know,
at the very least some of them are 

804
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:35,670
fascinating because there is so fucking 
huge,

805
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,900
you know,
and if really,

806
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,930
I mean,
if people really are making these 

807
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:42,930
things,
you know,

808
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:47,250
and uh,
they're flattening them out and just 

809
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:47,250
leaving them there.
It's like,

810
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,160
wow,
there's such incredible geometric art.

811
00:38:48,161 --> 00:38:49,900
You would think that they would want to 
take credit for that.

812
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,760
You know,
if it's just a hoax,

813
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:54,580
it's incredible that it's a hoax that 
they've kept up for this long.

814
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,120
Like how sneaky are they and what's the,
what's the benefit of that?

815
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,800
What's the,
uh,

816
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,370
what's the reward?
I don't know.

817
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:05,430
I mean,
I don't have an opinion one way or the 

818
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:05,430
other though.
I,

819
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,660
um,
I think it's also possible that it could

820
00:39:07,661 --> 00:39:12,100
be some sort of an experiment that they 
do to impose geometric patterns in these

821
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:12,820
fields.

822
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,440
It might be something that they do,
you know,

823
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,680
from the sky or something like that.
And who the fuck knows how they're doing

824
00:39:17,681 --> 00:39:20,620
it?
If you talk to some people that say that

825
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,690
these patterns,
the way they're made,

826
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:23,970
that the,
uh,

827
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:28,990
the,
the nodes of these plants have been 

828
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:31,441
blown out.
Like they've had energy pulse through 

829
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:31,441
them.
Like microwaves,

830
00:39:31,441 --> 00:39:31,600
like expanded.
I don't know.

831
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:35,200
I don't know though.
I really personally have not done enough

832
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,230
research and really paid attention to 
both sides of the argument.

833
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,980
I know one side of the argument is that 
it's bullshit.

834
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:43,780
And the other side of the argument is 
that it's aliens.

835
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,940
You know,
on both of them seem pretty ridiculous,

836
00:39:45,941 --> 00:39:50,941
so I'm not,
I'm not exactly sure what I think about 

837
00:39:50,941 --> 00:39:50,941
that shit.

838
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:56,680
So what did I think about the Luke 
Stewart Andre Galvao fight?

839
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,600
I thought that fight was really 
interesting.

840
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:01,940
I was blown away by that.
Luke Stewart Guy.

841
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:05,510
That guy has incredible sweet man.
He's relentless.

842
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:10,690
I thought he won the fight.
I thought he beat him with stand up and 

843
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,420
I thought his ground game and negated 
golf vowels,

844
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:18,200
grand game and he swept him a bunch of 
times and I thought he asked him,

845
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,880
you know,
I thought it was a real close fight,

846
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:22,130
but I thought a steward edge them.
But man,

847
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,450
he uh,
he blew me away.

848
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Luke Stewart is a bad motherfucker and 
I'm really looking forward to his next 

849
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,480
fight.
That was really,

850
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,590
really impressive.
UFC One 15.

851
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,500
Cincinnati,
they say that might be possible if um,

852
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,570
if the,
the um,

853
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:38,510
Vancouver thing falls through.
I don't know if that's fallen through or

854
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:43,511
not A.
I haven't heard it directly from the 

855
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:44,180
horse's mouth.
So when I hear it I'll find out

856
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:48,470
anymore documentaries like the union 
coming out.

857
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,410
Yeah,
I did a documentary on Dmt,

858
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,740
it's called DMT,
the spirit molecule and it should be 

859
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:59,590
done in May and probably out for release
sometime around the summer.

860
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,770
I know they're taking it to film 
festivals and uh,

861
00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:10,210
that bring it all over the place,
but it's a documentary mostly about 

862
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,140
different people's experiences on dmt.
And I,

863
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:13,100
uh,
I'm the narrator.

864
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:16,220
So that's the deal.
Do I know who bob?

865
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:22,210
Yeah.
Bob was always that guy who claims to 

866
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,071
have worked for area 51 and you know,
he's Kinda been discredited with a lot 

867
00:41:24,071 --> 00:41:25,160
of things,
especially like his education,

868
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:30,190
I guess he kinda like told some lies 
about where he went to school and what 

869
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:31,520
degrees are in,
but very,

870
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,960
very intelligent guy and obviously knew 
a lot about that area,

871
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:40,961
about area 51,
whether or not he really did have any 

872
00:41:40,961 --> 00:41:44,231
contact with you,
fos or with alien spacecraft or any of 

873
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:44,231
that stuff.

874
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:47,450
I mean it could be total 100 percent or 
shit or it could be true.

875
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:48,770
I mean,
it's really hard to tell,

876
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:54,130
but when a guy who lies about his 
education lies about certain aspects of 

877
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:59,051
his background,
you kind of assume that he's probably 

878
00:41:59,051 --> 00:41:59,051
lied about other things as well,
you know,

879
00:41:59,051 --> 00:41:59,240
I don't know.
I don't know.

880
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:04,360
Again,
I don't really have an opinion either 

881
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,360
way.
Interesting to watch them talk though.

882
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,360
He's very confident,
you know,

883
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,140
he's very confident which could mean 
either a who's crazy and that's why he's

884
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,950
confident or be.
He's telling the truth.

885
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,030
I'm alright.
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here because,

886
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,860
uh,
the car is picking me up in two minutes.

887
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,220
I just wanted to,
uh,

888
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,660
to bust out a nice quick one right here 
for you guys and say what's up?

889
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,930
So,
um,

890
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,720
thank you everybody for tuning in and 
we'll do one probably this weekend.

891
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:30,170
I'll have eddie come over to my house 
and we'll do like a full long ass one,

892
00:42:30,171 --> 00:42:32,660
maybe Friday.
