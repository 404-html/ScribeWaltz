00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,980
Hello freaks. I'm fucking multitasking
right now as I speak to you.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,500
I am actually tweeting that
were live and a lot of people,

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,460
oh like dude, you can't do
that. And I'm like, dude, I can,

4
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,620
I'm fucking bad ass.
I don't like that.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,880
I also turned the volume off on
my computer at the same time.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,160
I give zero fucks.
I really do.

7
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,860
Boom tweet.
Dun Dun Dun.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,250
This episode of the Joe Rogan
experience podcast is brought to you by

9
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:38,980
Squarespace.
Squarespace is having a contest.

10
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:40,750
That's why we're doing
two of them this week.

11
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,650
And what Squarespace is is the easiest,

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,880
simplest way to get a
really bad ass website.

13
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,530
And when I say a bad ass website,

14
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:53,260
I mean they look fucking completely
and totally professional.

15
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:56,590
It looks like you spent a
shitload of dollars doing it,

16
00:00:56,591 --> 00:00:58,690
but in fact you did it yourself.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,720
It's super easy to do.

18
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:06,750
And Squarespace is having a contest right
now to sort of accentuate that because

19
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:12,520
the feedback of Squarespace has been
so excellent and their contest is a,

20
00:01:12,521 --> 00:01:14,710
we're going to pick,
we have the up to this week,

21
00:01:14,711 --> 00:01:19,510
January 17th it ends and we're
going to pick four of the baddest,

22
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,590
most sweetest websites and for
the people that you have created,

23
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:25,510
those four baddest,
sweetest websites,

24
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:29,080
we're going to give them my free gear
of Squarespace and we're going to send

25
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:33,980
those winters a swag bag with items
like a Squarespace, apple keyboard,

26
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:38,050
t-shirt, mole skin, and more. What
do they have sound on their website?

27
00:01:38,051 --> 00:01:42,320
How dare they fucking age of they
live in, in these freaks. Oh,

28
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:46,630
they put sound on my website when it
opens up so that it immediately starts

29
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:49,540
annoying. The shit out of
you is a video I was playing.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,600
You know those old school websites,

31
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:55,270
you'd go to them and they immediately
start mind use to my space.

32
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:58,000
I remember there's like five different
songs going at the same time and glitter

33
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,090
tags. Don't forget glitter
tags work later. Tags.

34
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,520
What'd you just take a modafinil?
What that is?

35
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,140
No, you sure you don't want
to Xanax? No, no, no. This is
a, it's actually like speed.

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,930
Really? Yeah. It was just the opposite.
It's not really speed. It's, um, it's,

37
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,440
it's actually called Nuvigil
is what it is. That if I'm a,

38
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,940
if I'm tired and I want to fire him
my brain up, I can pop one of those.

39
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:28,720
And it's actually an experiment because
I tried something called sledging this

40
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,600
weekend and Jamie and I were actually
just talking about it. This guy, a doctor,

41
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:34,870
Mark Gordon was here and he
gave me these, uh, these, uh,

42
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,380
smart drugs and uh,
just we tried it.

43
00:02:38,381 --> 00:02:42,370
We both tried a dose of it and a
interesting, interesting stuff.

44
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:46,150
So I'm comparing it to just feel more
lucid. I don't know. I'm not sure.

45
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:50,410
I'm not sure. You know, it's
hard. It's hard to tell.

46
00:02:50,411 --> 00:02:54,100
Like what was my, the fact that
I got a good eight hour sleep.

47
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:57,190
What was the fact that they good food?
What was the why?

48
00:02:57,191 --> 00:03:00,010
I think they're all sort,
they all play a part

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,540
of the thing to really find out,

50
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:05,140
you'd have to have a baseline where
you ate like the exact same foods,

51
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,440
did the exact same activities,
got the exact same amount of sleep.

52
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,340
You'd have to have that baseline
and then add in something.

53
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,020
But I take so many different nutrients,

54
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,020
vitamins and fucking nootropics and
all these different things without

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,370
prescriptions. And that's all legal
stuff. So most of it is nutrients.

56
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:26,100
Most of them, it's just vitamins,
keeping the brain sharp. Dominic,

57
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:28,890
you guys stay on the ball.
They think it's amazing, man.

58
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,560
Margic you already go on stage.

59
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:33,380
All of a sudden your mind clicks into
a different gear. Well, you know,

60
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,800
well first of all, you and I are
both eating Dick on stage four.

61
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:41,750
That's fucking terrible feeling.
So you're prep as a side.

62
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,880
Let me get through these commercial.
Okay, so we can just start podcasts. Uh,

63
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:51,260
anyway, go tweet, build the
website and tweet the website.
The Squarespace contest.

64
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,930
What are we talking about?
Squarespace. Your Fox. Pay Attention.

65
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,200
It's tweet it to Hashtag j r e
Squarespace before January 17th.

66
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:05,050
So go to squarespace.com enter in the
code word Joe and the number one which,

67
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:08,300

68
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,190
January and uh, and you can
save some money as well. The,

69
00:04:13,191 --> 00:04:16,670
um, the thing that's beautiful
about Squarespace, if you
could do anything online,

70
00:04:16,671 --> 00:04:17,630
like if you can,

71
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,460
if you can just normal shit like drag
and drop and click and if you know how to

72
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:26,710
select things, you could do
this. And the way that's, it's,

73
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,020
it's so easy and so intuitive that they
have it set up so that you don't even

74
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:32,960
have to enter in your credit card
information. Just go there and try it.

75
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,300
If you like it and you say this is
pretty bad ass, boom, then from there,

76
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,040
then you give them some money, but
until then you, you're not obligated.

77
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,970
Just go give it a shot.
Use the offer code Joe and the number one,

78

and that's Joe and the number one that's

79
00:04:51,351 --> 00:04:56,170
purchase@squarespace.com to do, do, do,

80
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,500
do, do Squarespace. Yeah.

81
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:03,420
Where's spaced on my is tagged.
Jrd Squarespace.

82
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:05,350
Squarespace. Do you think
you could do this? You,

83
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,680
you are not a real computer wizard. I'll
tell you that you're a genius comedian.

84
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:11,410
But as far as computers,
dessert, I would not,

85
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,330
I would not put you in
the wizard category.

86
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,060
I think you could build
a website on Squarespace.

87
00:05:16,061 --> 00:05:19,330
We should have a context to see if dom
or Eric and bill the webspace on squares.

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,660
If we got you lick it up. You can figure
it out. If you had like a hot assistant,

89
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,850
you know, maybe a hot Japanese
assistant. Ms. Dot. Yeah.

90
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:33,970
None of them. None of them. When my,

91
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,460
when my computer comes on and
I go, yes, I did again, my man,

92
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,770
you're wrong baby. Uh, we're also
brought to you by ting. Ting is, uh,

93
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,960
one of the Squarespace and ting or two
of my favorite podcast sponsors because

94
00:05:54,381 --> 00:05:57,350
they're both two podcast sponsors that
I haven't had a single person tell me

95
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:01,110
anything bad about. And then of course
someone listening to this right now.

96
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:01,750
I was like,
yeah,

97
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,060
Oh God.
Oh,

98
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:09,010
the first fuck tin can suck my Dick
in squares spaces filled with cons.

99
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,560
Fuck you,
Joe Rogan.

100
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,500
Um, ting is a great, is a great way to
save money and use a sprint backbone.

101
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,350
You don't have to worry about being on
some mom and pop cell phone network.

102
00:06:19,351 --> 00:06:22,890
They use one of the biggest cell phone
networks in the country and they do it,

103
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:25,650
you know, it's weird. They're from Canada
and they don't, you know, they're like,

104
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:28,470
they don't operate in Canada. They
operate in the United States. I mean,

105
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,580
you could roam in Canada,

106
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:32,580
but they're a Canadian company that works
in the United States. Yeah. It's weird.

107
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:37,260
It's from Toronto. I, but yeah.
Um, I think, yeah. Um, anyway,

108
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,930
great guys and their
idea of great gals too.

109
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:43,310
I'm sure there's some awesome gals working
there. I don't want to be sexist. Um,

110
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:43,951
but their,

111
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:48,690
their ideas sell you awesome cell phone
service and do so in an ethical way.

112
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,740
A NO BS mobile service,
if you will. And um,

113
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,360
they have no contracts,

114
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:58,830
no early termination fees and they even
have an early termination fee relief

115
00:06:58,831 --> 00:07:02,160
program. If you're paying an early
termination fee to come to ting,

116
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:05,730
they will give you up to $75 back.

117
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,060
They will credit you 25% of
your early termination fee,

118
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:13,830
which is up to $75 per device.
It's really a great company.

119
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,660
I really liked the idea behind this.

120
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,740
Sell you something that's really excellent
and do it in a way that doesn't make

121
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:20,730
you feel like you're getting fucked.

122
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,990
98% of all people who
switched to ting saved money.

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,760
I mean, I've had three very good friends
that have done it. Brian's done it.

124
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,630
Dr Chris Ryan did it and you know,
they rave about it, it's excellent.

125
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,270
And you really do save
money. Um, kinds of money.

126
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,810
The other guys charge you if you go over
your allocated minutes, texts and data.

127
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:43,230
But if you have a heavier month on Ting,
you just pay for what you used.

128
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,820
It's really simple.

129
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,890
So no mysterious items on your bill
and unlimited devices on one plan.

130
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:53,940
You can have as many devices as you want
on one plan, sharing, pooled minutes,

131
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,680
messages, megabytes, everything.

132
00:07:55,681 --> 00:08:00,660
Each device on a plan costs a
flat $6 per month. They have,

133
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,130
it's really good deals.

134
00:08:02,131 --> 00:08:06,270
And the phones they sell are all
the highest end android phones.

135
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,220
All the really cool ones. Like the
galaxy note three, which is what I have.

136
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:16,050
And Brian has the um, the galaxy s four,
which is an another excellent phone.

137
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,060
The HTC one is an excellent phone.

138
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,140
It used to be at one point in time that
iPhone was the king and everything else

139
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:26,590
just sucked. But it's very close now. And
then I fact I give the edge to android.

140
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,170
It's just because their
screens are bigger.

141
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:30,410
It's a way better experience if you're,

142
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,110
if I'm reading my text messages or
watching a video that someone sent me,

143
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,610
it's just a better experience
on that big screen. Sorry Paul.

144
00:08:38,611 --> 00:08:43,140
I know you can't hearing this from me
and I know we were together for so long.

145
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,750
You know what I wanted is that new
flexible phone? Have you seen that?

146
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,400
It flexes the whole phone, but that's,
I believe it's just the screen, right?

147
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,560
I'm a screen. Isn't that what that
stuff's called? It's like a type of class.

148
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:55,020
That plastic you could
work out with the phone.

149
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:59,940
You could do a little in between the legs
like Suzanne Somers and get your thigh

150
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:04,030
master. Ron Her don't make fun of
her. She's a beautiful woman is hot.

161
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,970
order. Shit, if you know what you like
and if you've used it consistently,

162
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,380
you can get it done and get it done this
way and not have to think about it as

163
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:49,260
much.

168
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:12,780

not going to get there intellectually,

169
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,970
but if you could just, just become a
man through these, lose too much weight.

170
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,430
Looking at my face, I want you to
be brutally honest. You're not gone.

171
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,830
Your delicious. Thank you.
You look soft and lovable.

172
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,570

before I came over. Smooth skin.

173
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:34,620
You actually still not a man who has
to work too hard outside in the cold,

174
00:10:34,621 --> 00:10:38,240
frigid temperatures. I haven't done
anything since I started doing standup.

175
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:41,850
I never worked. I don't have a
tool and I went to, that's good.

176
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:43,920
That's a real comic.
That's why you're still flooding.

177
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,830

O. N. N. I. T. A.

181
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,410
I can't even continue doing these type
of like super descriptive commercials

182
00:11:04,411 --> 00:11:07,320
because the people that have heard
it a million times are freaking out.

183
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,120
But if you're interested,
go to on it.

Joe Rogan podcast.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,870
What's up baby? Everything's
good. Joe. You're a real
comedian. Dom Irrera you know,

189
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,290
you're just saying that for folks who
didn't listen to the commercial part,

190
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,830
you don't have a tool. You
know, you'd ever done a thing.
He never turned a wrench.

191
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,950
There's two bucks. There's
two, two bucks in my house.

192
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:53,180
And they were the lifts to women that live
with me. That having a broad tool box,

193
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,130
I can't even lift it is
when they can't lift.

194
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,890
I don't know how soap you lifted it.
That's hilarious.

195
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,730
Every time somebody shakes my hand,
they go mijo just soft hands. Oh,

196
00:12:04,731 --> 00:12:09,550
the butter like butter. Smooth.
Yeah. That's, uh, that's,

197
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,620
I really do believe that there's a real,

198
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:16,600
there's a real factor in that you've
remaining on top of your game all these

199
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,240
years. It was like you surely you
truly like completely. You know,

200
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:23,500
you're a comedian. That's it. That's
what you're capable of. I love it.

201
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,180
I could do it in a hammock. I followed
crystal Lee and the other night at the,

202
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,680
he did a standing ovation and lift factor,
right? I walk in and this was true.

203
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,940
I had just woken up.

204
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,900
I took a nap like at nine o'clock at
night and the audience was standing.

205
00:12:37,901 --> 00:12:41,290
I don't know. I said, first of all,
it's Chris just got a standing ovation.

206
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:46,030
I just woke up. I said, uh,
I was just in the bath tub,

207
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:48,760
like a big fat fag.
So Lazy.

208
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,870
The only reason I was taking a bath
cause to the stand up and shape, right?

209
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,720
And I said to the crowd,
and then what would you do if you were me?

210
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:58,750
What the fuck am I supposed to
do? Fly around the room, you know?

211
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,340
What do you mean after he,
after he,

212
00:13:00,341 --> 00:13:03,160
after he had a standing ovation and am
I supposed to fly around the room and

213
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:07,180
said no, tell me what to do. They were
with me because it was honest, you know.

214
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:11,500
But the thing is what and what you were
saying about just I give a fuck. Totally,

215
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,110
but I don't give a fuck. Like I could
do it in a hammock at this point.

216
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:19,090
Let's just my head out doing stand.
That's actually not a bad idea.

217
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,950
That be pretty funny. For 30 a good
act. They were just laying there. Yeah.

218
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,350
Especially like if it was a
part of like a comedy festival.

219
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,510
Even a regular set. Ladies and
gentlemen, we present you dom.

220
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:35,230
I Rarer Anna Hammer and you just
swinging back and forth with a wireless

221
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:38,410
microphone in the air
and talking shit man.

222
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,300
Have things changed since
I started doing the show?

223
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,820
Redman is now taking x on
the road with him. Yeah.

224
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:47,530
Believe he took Tiffany Haddish, which
I said, you know Tiffany? Yeah, sure.

225
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:48,700
I said it's beautiful,
right?

226
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,270
But I said I would be afraid to fuck
Tiffany or even at him cause I just,

227
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:56,320
I'm intimidated by her and the Senseo.
You call that a Dick White boy.

228
00:13:56,650 --> 00:14:00,580
I'll snap that motherfucker off. Have you
ever seen her queef until Michael Fun.

229
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:04,350
She closed it in Dallas and
it brought down the house.

230
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:07,020
People just couldn't
understand it was happening.

231
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,170
Like it was like a good ten second pause
where everyone's face. It was like,

232
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,920
wait that, that just happened,
that and then it just destroyed.

233
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,760
So she just put the microphone in her
box and she had been on stage for 30

234
00:14:17,761 --> 00:14:20,370
minutes. I had a wet pussy. She's mostly,

235
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,180
she had a whip was even being on stage,
especially said turn yourself.

236
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,680
What's amazing that
honestly really the cheese,

237
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:31,810
the first one to think of sticking a
microphone in her pussy and [inaudible].

238
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,440
I don't remember it being done before.

239
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,770
I would have thought that someone
would have picked that up by now.

240
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,770
He's a cunt pioneer. Yeah. But
if you really think about it,

241
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:44,320
isn't it incredible
that it's 2014 for her?

242
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,500
What was it like 2012
when did she start queen?

243
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,520
She was on the podcast and the
icehouse chronicles like what?

244
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,800
Two years ago maybe.

245
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,270
Maybe it might've been either 12 2012
or 2013 either one of them either a year

246
00:14:56,271 --> 00:15:00,440
or two a year and a half ago.
But she was, she was quite often,

247
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:03,590
and I was thinking then I was like,
I don't think anybody does this.

248
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,750
It's kind of amazing.

249
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,420
But you would've thought that somebody
would have locked that down. I mean,

250
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:11,870
that's been around for a long time.
The fact that no one's stuck a microphone.

251
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,530
Has any guy just committed to just
farting on stage all the time?

252
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,150
I mean as as one. Is this her
doing it? Okay, let's hear it.

253
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:23,833
Okay.

254
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,710
[inaudible]

255
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,123
hey

256
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:34,990
[inaudible]

257
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,830
part of a fart too,
man.

258
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:41,750
I got tell you really
impressed pitches on stage.

259
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:43,160
If you see it close up,

260
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:47,210
tilt her back a little and you
could see her sucking air in.

261
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:51,170
So now you have to follow that.
Tony did, and he's sick right now.

262
00:15:51,171 --> 00:15:54,380
He might've from the microphone,
I think. Oh Geez. Oh,

263
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:56,630
could you imagine if he really died?

264
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,600
You actually caught aids from microphone.
You're like, what the fuck man.

265
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:07,010
Not saying the Tiffany Haddish
I say that. All right. But yeah.

266
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,150
God Damn Man.

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,420
Okay.

268
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,670
She's a lot of fun though, man.
I'm so proud of her. She's,

269
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:16,590
she's on the Arsenio Hall now are trying
to build out after this episode. Well,

270
00:16:16,591 --> 00:16:19,650
it is fascinating to me. I
mean it's just, first of all,

271
00:16:19,651 --> 00:16:23,600
it's fascinating because it's,
even though you say a woman's onstage,

272
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,110
she could rapper sure. Vagina. She could
point to it. She could show it to you.

273
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,660
But when someone starts talking with it,

274
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,970
like you know that noise came from
that vagina that is several levels.

275
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,720
She's just have a levels more intimate.
Her Pussy,

276
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:41,140
he's talking to you.

277
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,840
There's Texas girls didn't know
how to act either. Their faces.

278
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,680
No one should know how to act.
Listen, no one on the planet.

279
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,650
We know that act is cause we're deviants.

280
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:56,430
We're deviants and we've been around
fucked up people our entire lives.

281
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,750
I mean you,

282
00:16:57,751 --> 00:17:01,200
you've been around no one but fucked up
people since we started working together

283
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,620
and I've been around no one but fucked
up people for a decade before that.

284
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,700
So our, you know, our
perspective is a bit skewed.

285
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,470
The boyfriend drive to the thing telling
his girlfriend and the show maybe a

286
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,900
little.
Yeah.

287
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,060
Imagine if a girl was like,

288
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:23,061
really seriously Christian and I'll go
to the show because I think Brian rent

289
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:24,030
bands.
Cute.

290
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:29,030
But I heard that this girl
Tiffany Haddish Mike say tannic.

291
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:31,320
No,
Joe.

292
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,650
Do you remember the hooker
that we interviewed a long
time ago on the Joe Show?

293
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:37,670
Yeah. Yeah, in the parking
lot of the comedy store.

294
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,680
She was like telling us how she did the
business and stuff. I was really stoned.

295
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:44,220
I was like, I wonder if she's
still a hooker. And I found
her online still hooker.

296
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,630
Oh my God. Then what, like 10 years. She
didn't, she didn't get out of law school.

297
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,230
No.
Geez.

298
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:55,110
It's so weird how easy it was to
find her too. Yeah, it's, I'm torn.

299
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,070
I gotta be honest.

300
00:17:56,071 --> 00:18:01,071
I'm torn on the whole idea of prostitution
because I feel like I always feel

301
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,740
like you should be able to do
whatever the fuck you want.

302
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,620
If you want to have sex
with someone for free,

303
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:12,720
you should be able to have sex with
someone for free. If a guy wants $1,000,

304
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,360
if you jerk him off and you're like,
all right,

305
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,810
then you should be able to do that. It
should be legal. That should be no more,

306
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,530
no more,

307
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:23,070
no more different than if you wanted
to get a massage like no one wants a

308
00:18:23,071 --> 00:18:25,860
massage. You man, you're
paying them to massage you.

309
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:29,370
When you go to a spa and you
get a rub down for an hour,

310
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,680
that person does not want to do that.

311
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:34,650
You're giving them money and they're
making you feel good with their fingers,

312
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,830
like you should be able do whatever the
fuck you want and it's all our societal

313
00:18:37,831 --> 00:18:42,630
standards that are fucked
up and weird about sex.

314
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,943
That said,

315
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:47,340
when I hear that someone's a hooker
like that and it's been a hooker for 10

316
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,890
years, that does not
feel good. It feels sad.

317
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,400
It feels like she's a lost and she's in
a bad place and I'm torn because I don't

318
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:58,650
know if that's my own bias perceptions.

319
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,950
Like maybe she's meeting a bunch of
people that are like really desperate for

320
00:19:01,951 --> 00:19:03,450
touch and you know,

321
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:07,700
maybe she picks good clientele
and they have sex and she,

322
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:11,220
that's what she gets paid. And who gives
a fuck? Maybe it's not. Maybe it's that.

323
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:16,380
I mean, but instantly you say that she's
still a hooker. I'm like, but I'm like,

324
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:19,980
I'm questioning myself. I'm like, why? You
know, why does it always have to be bad?

325
00:19:19,981 --> 00:19:23,400
Is it because we've associated sex
with something that you're naughty,

326
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:24,510
you're not supposed to do it.

327
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,380
So someone doing it for a living and
somehow or another a bad thing I used to

328
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,520
get after I fucked a regular
girl, like on the road. Why?

329
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:35,850
Just taking just cause it was wild.
There was the curiosity of it.

330
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,650
If I had one answer, Tj's left,
he seriously, I would get like,

331
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:43,890
I have like say like a waitress
or something on the road club.

332
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:49,440
Then she'd go and then they call
a prostitute, right? Total addict.

333
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,350
Oh, that's hilarious. Thank God
for blood pressure medications.

334
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,900
Do you think that's part of, that's just
being an Italian? Yeah, I really do.

335
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,800
Um,
you know,

336
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:02,760
there's always been that like ridiculous
stereotype of Italians is like

337
00:20:02,761 --> 00:20:07,620
oversexed goons definitely is a reason
why that stereotype is and not for

338
00:20:07,621 --> 00:20:12,480
Chinese guys. Okay. There's a reason
why that stereotype is not for,

339
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,560
you know,
fill in the blank.

340
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,710
It's like for oversexed a Pysch goons
for Italians is because they are like,

341
00:20:18,711 --> 00:20:22,490
fuck shelfy for five years,
every day, every day, a couple,

342
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,620
at least a couple of times a day.
Even when she was reading,

343
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,100
I didn't need to know that, but
now that I do, I feel better.

344
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,610
Yeah. It's uh, it's uh, the,
my, all my ancestors, my
fucking, my family back home.

345
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,510
Like, although the Italians I knew and
that I grew up with, they were savages.

346
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,050
They would have grandmas,

347
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:44,460
they call him like they take the Gomar
out on a Friday night and then the white

348
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:49,390
powder on a Saturday. Did you see that
new movie? American hustle? I fell asleep.

349
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:54,020
I heard that movie sucks from so many
people. I don't know. I'm asleep.

350
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:58,510
I don't know. Do you like it? You gotta
Watch it again? I enjoyed that movie.

351
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,540
I have it at home. They sent it to
me so I sent it to me. It's like,

352
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,400
oh did he bragging about the stag thing?

353
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:08,500
They said what kind of a brag is that
if it gets bootlegged we know where it

354
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:11,720
came from cause dom I rare really knows.
Those knew I had to agree to a,

355
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:14,990
I had accepted the agreement like
they're going to trace it right.

356
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,080
Well there's a new thing they have now.

357
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,070
Somebody told me about online we
can get movies as they come out,

358
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:25,750
they cost 500 bucks and it's like you
have like a box in your house and that box

359
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:30,040
stores a certain amount of movies. Wow.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll send you the information.

360
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,980
I sent it to the guy who did the
ab in this place, my buddy and uh,

361
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,100
he said, yeah, it's legit. He said it's
a new thing. It sets up to your house.

362
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,220
You could store like x amount of movies.
You could have like 10 movies on it.

363
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:45,400
And they one time and they're all in
your name and they don't go anywhere.

364
00:21:45,401 --> 00:21:48,580
They just plug it in this box and you
can play it on your TV and the each movie

365
00:21:48,581 --> 00:21:51,730
cost like 500 bucks.
Wow. Which is weird man.

366
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,970
It's like Dan is a lot of fucking money.
But I was at the movie theater,

367
00:21:54,971 --> 00:21:59,770
I went to see American hustle and this
couple behind us just kept talking and it

368
00:21:59,771 --> 00:22:01,720
was a,
not very many people in the theater,

369
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,270
so they were talking pretty loud
because there was no one next to them.

370
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,280
And people just don't realize,

371
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,770
they probably don't even realize you're
being rude because they thought they

372
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:12,040
were far away. But you don't realize
how far your voice carry shit.

373
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:13,960
Nobody else is trying to,
yeah,

374
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:16,840
I was just going to say that I was
going to bring that up and it's really

375
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:19,330
frustrating. But you know, I just
dealt with it and watched the movie.

376
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:20,230
I didn't say anything,

377
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:25,540
but a guy got shot in Florida so a
retired cop had a gun on him and he was

378
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,700
texting. It wasn't even,
and he was texting,

379
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,510
texting in the theater and this cop wound
up getting in an altercation with them.

380
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,190
I mean that's step one and then step,
you know,

381
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:37,630
ultimate step 10 or whatever it is, is
he shot him. Who knows what happened.

382
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:40,570
The cop could have asked him and the
you could have gone, fuck you bitch.

383
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:44,200
Or of course has gotten crazy, you
know, 72 years old or something to,

384
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:46,930
well maybe he's just ready to
die on his own. And he was like,

385
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,180
start killing kids until one of them
gets me. That's why I like arc light.

386
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
Cause normally you could pick your seats,

387
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:56,020
but then if there's somebody
that's talking or something,

388
00:22:56,021 --> 00:22:58,300
there's like a guy that just pretty
much stands in that movie. They,

389
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,580
they're on it like that.
Yeah, you're right.

390
00:23:00,581 --> 00:23:03,220
There's another place called Sinny
apolis that's even more dope.

391
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:08,200
They have these giant lounge chairs fully
recross the recline, they sell food.

392
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:11,650
The food's really delicious and
it's a way better experience.

393
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,840
People don't fucking dog,

394
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,930
so it might be worth the
500 bucks is my point.

395
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:20,060
To have a new movies as they come out,
we might be worth,

396
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:23,170
what you do is you get the box and you
set up a camera in a dark room and you

397
00:23:23,171 --> 00:23:26,440
film it and then when we make a DVD of
it and then we sell it to her friends for

398
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:30,340
$20 each and you get the $500 but you
want to go to jail and just retarded.

399
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:33,150
Which one is the,
that was my first line to him when I,

400
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,000
first time we did the show, it was
the way we met. What are you retarded?

401
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,480
I loved how you handled it.
It was beautiful. It is.

402
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:47,690
How do you handle it? You, oh, are
you handling it when you met him,

403
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,940
called him what it is? Well, I
think I was right, but I love him.

404
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,430
I don't know if I would pay
500 bucks for a movie though.

405
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,020
That seems like a lot of goddamn money.

406
00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:01,020
That seems like at this point in time it's
like, come on, unless you really don't,

407
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:01,490
you know,

408
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,610
unless you're really annoyed by the
public and then have that much money,

409
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:08,120
it doesn't matter. But the problem is
the more you do shit like that, if you,

410
00:24:08,121 --> 00:24:11,210
you know, you could become a hermit
man, you could be, we come a hermit.

411
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:13,190
If you really paid attention
to how goofy people are,

412
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,970
you get really at one point in time forced
yourself into the mountain somewhere

413
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,760
and just fucking be completely isolated.
You handle it well.

414
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,150
You handled it really well. You have
a lot of patients. It's not hard.

415
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,560
It's a bunch of people being nice to you.

416
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
But when we're shooting pool and
somebody wants to take a picture,

417
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:28,270
that's a little too much.
Well,

418
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,740
it gets annoying that that gets annoying
when you're in the middle of some

419
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:35,030
obvious activity. Or, um, when you're
eating, you're eating is a dumb one.

420
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:38,420
That's like, come on. I'm saying with
a mouthful to shake your hand too.

421
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,640
They want to shake your hand. They want
you to come. I've had a lady in, um,

422
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,480
Vegas asked me to come over towards,
I'm in the middle of eating.

423
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,910
I had a mouthful of food.
Hi, we're from Canada.

424
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:50,420
We would like it if you could come
over to our table. And I'm like, what?

425
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,550
Like I'm eating. No, I'm not going to get
away. Like how, why would you ask someone?

426
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,760
I couldn't imagine going up to someone
I didn't know and just ask them to come

427
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:01,280
over to our table.
We're big fans of fear factor.

428
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,770
I could come over to our table.

429
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,430
I remember when Bruce Willis for first
started getting famous Spec of the Improv

430
00:25:10,431 --> 00:25:12,680
in the 80s and this guy comes up to me,

431
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:15,580
he starts shaking his hand and he wouldn't
let it go and just keep sending with

432
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,730
Bruce just looking at me and he goes, and
the guy goes, don it, get the, get the,

433
00:25:18,731 --> 00:25:20,670
get the camera,
get the camera out of the car down.

434
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:23,060
Like he was holding them hostage.
So they took a picture.

435
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,780
That's when I first saw it at any,

436
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,810
anyone of my friends get that glimpse of
fame and the annoying part of it. Wow.

437
00:25:28,811 --> 00:25:31,790
He just held onto and get the camera
and he's shaking bruises and Bruce was

438
00:25:31,791 --> 00:25:35,090
looking at me like I'm supposed to do
it. Can't win. When he'd be pulled away,

439
00:25:35,091 --> 00:25:38,660
you'd fucking punch him. Whether you
do, some people are definitely crazy.

440
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,050
Some people are just too excited to
meet someone like Bruce Willis too.

441
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,900
It's like, it's not natural. I don't
know what they think's going to happen.

442
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,170
It's kind of cool, like if you see
Bruce Wells, like Ooh, that's Bruce was,

443
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,950
that's a, you know, that's the guy from
moonlighting as the guy from die hard.

444
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,670
Yeah. That's Bruce Willis. He was
in fucking pulp fiction. Yeah.

445
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:58,370
I always tell people just enjoy their
work. Enjoy the work. Leave him alone.

446
00:25:58,371 --> 00:26:01,910
Because if they met some people, they'd
be such a fucking disappointment to them.

447
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,510
Yeah. You know, mall. I
don't know man. It's just,

448
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,390
some people just aren't used to it.
In California,

449
00:26:08,391 --> 00:26:12,080
I think way more people are used to see
famous people don't bother you here.

450
00:26:12,081 --> 00:26:14,840
They don't say thank you. I like your
work til after the check has done.

451
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,040
So they're not trying to pump up the tip.
You know? There's a little bit of that,

452
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,790
I'm sure. Um, but California
doesn't give a fuck.

453
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,480
It's like if you're famous or not famous,
there's so many famous people here.

454
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:27,620
It's not that big of a deal.

455
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,580
But if you're a famous person like say
and you moved to Iowa or something like

456
00:26:31,581 --> 00:26:33,640
that, that wasn't your be, oh, you know,

457
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,610
I know that just as a
comedian because in Columbus,

458
00:26:37,611 --> 00:26:39,980
Ohio I get recognized more
than I can recognize that here.

459
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,810
But I might get recognized
but they don't give a fuck.

460
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,890
Well you have a big following.
You know,

461
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:47,670
it's Kinda interesting how comics develop
followings in one city or another.

462
00:26:47,671 --> 00:26:51,540
And I'm never really quite understood
that. But you know how there's that issue,

463
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,640
like the, the best examples that
Guy Bob Marley, I love Bob Marley.

464
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,170
Great Guy, great salted, the
goofball sweetheart of a guy.

465
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,930
I've known him for 20 plus years.
Bob,

466
00:27:03,931 --> 00:27:08,490
I knew Bob when Bob was an open mic or
in Maine who would come down and do a

467
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,870
Nick's comedy stop and he
would, uh, he did a guest set,

468
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,560
one of our shows on the
road cause he was like a,

469
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:17,850
the Bangor House comedian and this place.

470
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,000
But it's so real sweetheart
of a guy and a very funny guy.

471
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:25,620
But my point is that he's a huge
act in Maine. Yeah. Like people,

472
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,670
he sells books and albums and you might
have heard of them like most of you

473
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,690
know, fuel. If you're
a comedy fan, you know,

474
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:38,040
you might've heard them on
Sirius satellite radio or
seen him on comedy central

475
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:40,620
or something like that,
but he would have no idea.

476
00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:44,860
Tell me a great story about Billy
crystal. They get into a, um, an elevator,

477
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,430
him and Chuck Bra,

478
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,910
Butch Bradley and Billy Crystal
was in Bible goes in and Brooklyn,

479
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,830
hey Billy will, you know, nice to meet
were comedians. And he just kind of went,

480
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:57,130
you know, like kind of ignored
him. And Bob says to me,

481
00:27:57,131 --> 00:28:00,820
cause I didn't know whether the fuck can
push the stop button and beat the fuck

482
00:28:00,821 --> 00:28:04,990
out or just let it go.
He said, so he let it go.

483
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,820
Wow. Billy crystal probably stopped being
a comedian somewhere along the line.

484
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,900
Well, you know what I mean about stop
being a comedian. Oh yeah. If that,

485
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:14,630
if you do that,
you stopped being a comedian.

486
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,420
Well he was always really nice to
me and then one time I interviewed,

487
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:21,470
I interviewed him and De Niro for this
comedy central thing and he was real smug

488
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:24,390
and shit.
Like he turned against me and I was like,

489
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:27,560
good scenario like is kind of
thick, you know. And I said to him,

490
00:28:27,561 --> 00:28:32,030
cause he sang when mentally
like he's not real, he's not,

491
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:36,410
he's not there, you know, like real quick.
I mean he's a great actor, but uh, that's,

492
00:28:36,411 --> 00:28:39,620
that's a whole different story.
But the Nero, I said to him,

493
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,680
cause he sang and analyze that and I said,
I love your singing. And I always look,

494
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,450
there's more than anything, I love your
singing obviously. I'm kidding. I go,

495
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,340
I says, you had the definitive Tevye in
fiddler on the roof and De Niro goes, oh,

496
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,270
thank you. It's all right.
Like you don't fucking get it.

497
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:56,570
He was barely paying attention
to and Billy was like,
that's exactly what it was.

498
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,660
I'm Billy was like, you know, kind of
snapping at me. I'm thinking, man, Bill,

499
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,120
you turn on me.
I'm another comedian just to go with it.

500
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,340
I think sometimes a guy like him,

501
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,250
we'll get tired of being the
center of attention, you know,

502
00:29:07,251 --> 00:29:12,090
because I think also to be that kind
of an actor, he's not who deniro. Yeah.

503
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,700
To be that kind of an actor.

504
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,630
Don't you think he's lost some of his
legacy though by the doing these stupid

505
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:18,700
films? He's definitely has.
But I'll tell you what.

506
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:22,900
He was in American hustle and he's fucking
gangster in it. Yeah, he's bad ass.

507
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:25,720
I love the guy.
He's has very small part,

508
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:28,840
but it's vintage dinero but
that's my question. Like what?

509
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,230
When you work that much and you have
taxi driver and raging bull in your

510
00:29:34,661 --> 00:29:37,990
itinerary, your resume, where are
you going to go from there? I mean,

511
00:29:37,991 --> 00:29:41,320
he was just wants to work. So he's doing
the Fockers and all this stuff. Well,

512
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,190
maybe he enjoys

513
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,230
it. The thing, I mean, it's like he
obviously enjoys working, you know,

514
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,190
it's a lot of pressure to be so big that
you can't just do medium shit, you know?

515
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,270
Well, he put in some of the
greatest performances of
all time, the Cape Fear. Oh,

516
00:29:55,271 --> 00:29:56,920
he's fucking Jesus Christ.

517
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,450
When he was in the empty
theater with the, the, yeah.

518
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,810
The girl when she be putting his finger,
his finger in her mouth,

519
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:09,610
that was fucking wild. It was
wild. It was a fucking crazy movie.

520
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,900
He was one of the scariest guys ever as
a medicine guy. And taxi drivers. Yeah.

521
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:18,370
Well, he always deteriorated.
Even in King of comedy,

522
00:30:18,371 --> 00:30:22,420
he got crazier and crazier as the movie
went on. King of comedy. Oh my God.

523
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,240
If Rupert Pumpkin, you know what
I saw the other day, um, uh,

524
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:28,030
I'm going to have to sit down
and watch the whole thing,

525
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:30,430
but I was flipping through
the channels and it was on,

526
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,640
was it flipping through
channels or was I want whatever.

527
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,960
Somehow or another I was watching a
small piece of it, deer hunter. Oh yeah.

528
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,880
I was having a fucking God, damn,
that's a good movie. I got to stop it.

529
00:30:42,881 --> 00:30:43,451
And I said,
you know,

530
00:30:43,451 --> 00:30:46,720
I can't start it in the middle here and
just watch it from here. I'm going to,

531
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm going to come back to this,
watch this as a full movie. I did.

532
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:52,000
That movie deserves to be
washed as a full movie,

533
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,830
just flipping through the
channels and catch that.

534
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:58,350
Not because this is sons of Italy
day, but the switch to one of the, no,

535
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:02,590
to put the switch to one of the
Italian Pachino in dog day afternoon.

536
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,760
You ever see that fantastic movie? I saw
it again last year. Fucking incredible.

537
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:10,190
Fantastic movie. But yeah.
What a weird plot too. Oh yeah.

538
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,290
There was just shrinks change
your story. Yeah. Yeah.

539
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,210
But it like the geneal
though. I mean, um, uh, uh,

540
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:21,430
John could says no. Uh, who's the,
it was that it was the Cino. No,

541
00:31:21,431 --> 00:31:26,110
but she knows buddy who's pitching from,
he was famous phrase though. He, yeah,

542
00:31:26,111 --> 00:31:30,790
exactly. Yeah. He played such
a weird freaky character.

543
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,680
And pachino was so on. It was like there
was, it was such a different person,

544
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,310
like this kind of guy who's robbing
a bank to pay for a sex change.

545
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,853
Yeah.
Yeah.

546
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:46,840
Normal seemed a little too together
to be that guy almost a little too.

547
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,520
They went outside. That was one of
Attica came from Attica. Attica.

548
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,980
That was a big movie, man. Yeah,

549
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,280
we can now he's reading about him because
they didn't want to cast him in the

550
00:31:57,281 --> 00:32:01,300
Godfather. Michael Corleone, you know
who they wanted for it to Redford.

551
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,540
Really? Robert Redford.
Right. And then they,

552
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:09,730
then they watched and somehow the Coppola
one that him and he finally got him in.

553
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:12,400
And how great.
How great was he in that movie?

554
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,850
He was spectrum transition
between Michael and the Godfather.

555
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,120
I think those guys that do those
movies like the Chino and De Niro,

556
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,490
Harvey Keitel and all these
like historical actors. Um,

557
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,420
after a while it just fucking working,
you know,

558
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:32,770
so I can till the next really big project
comes up till something that comes up.

559
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:37,200
Don't die on us. Don't tell
us a little bronchitis, Joan.
I ain't no, not bragging.

560
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,220
I know.
Um,

561
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,490
but it's like to keep up
that level of work, you know,

562
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,940
to keep up the level of
work that they did like,

563
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:49,940
like Samuel Jackson and pulp fiction
to keep up that level of work. I mean,

564
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:54,050
that's like spectacular goddamn movie.
And how do you follow yourself?

565
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,850
And that part is so perfect.

566
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,500
[inaudible] that's one of the most
menacing parts ever. As another menacing,

567
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,820
like the, the menacing part of
a, of a [inaudible] Cape Fear.

568
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:09,540
Sam Jackson's Menisci part as a hit man
who's talking shit to you before she

569
00:33:09,541 --> 00:33:13,040
asks you about your cheeseburger
that is d to tasty burger.

570
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,540
He was fucking horrifying,
man. I was [inaudible] about
the scene in true romance.

571
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:22,520
There's talking about the w who was
in the, uh, you're talking about,

572
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:27,400
we need to talk about Africa. Yeah. Yeah.
Gary Oldman is, are we talking about,

573
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:31,810
was it Gary Oldman? Christopher Walker
when he was talking about Sicilians. Yeah,

574
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:35,420
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Dennis.
Hi Walker and Dennis Hopper.

575
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:39,440
That was one of the heaviest fucking
scenes and but some comedy in it. Hmm.

576
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:43,880
Yeah. Same. A Jackson in pulp
fiction was a motherfucker dude.

577
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,940
When he would quote the Bible to
you before he would shoot you,

578
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:49,820
his wallet said bad motherfucker on it.

579
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:54,710
Jerry curls running around in a
suit shooting people. That was a,

580
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,450
that was a wild park. Yeah. He's a,

581
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,140
he's a good medicine motherfucker.

582
00:34:00,170 --> 00:34:04,040
He's got crazy eyes and thanks for
doing my podcast anytime my brother

583
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:08,720
appreciate it. Can I do a shameless
plug? Yeah, sure. Do you mind?

584
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:13,490
Because he's fucking clubs. This shows so
big. Everybody asked me if I can do it,

585
00:34:13,491 --> 00:34:17,300
if I can run 30 seconds. Is that
okay? What are you talking about?

586
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,950
Just mentioned where I'm going to be
stuff written down yet because they drive

587
00:34:21,951 --> 00:34:23,660
me fucking crazy.
It's driving you crazy.

588
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,860
Any club that knows I'm going
to do this show. All right.

589
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,220
I'm doing side splitters and Tampa.
Can I do this? Yeah, go ahead.

590
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,210
Just does this in Tampa,
Knoxville and side splitters,

591
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:40,460
left factory Chicago Long Beach, Vegas,
funnybone, Columbus, Denver comedy works,

592
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:45,240
Stress Factory and Kilkenny Ireland.
This is all great, but this is Nike.

593
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,700
Let me tell you the best way in the
future. Just get a Twitter that you do.

594
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:53,390
You post on a regular basis and have all
your dates up on Twitter and then send

595
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:56,810
people to your Twitter or send people
to your calendar who you're talking to.

596
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:59,540
These people are not going to remember
all these things. That's the problem.

597
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,820
When you say a bunch of things in a row
that loses their meaning. If you say Tom,

598
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,310
I rera.net or.com,
boom,

599
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,160
the size following me on Twitter. How
much do you do a on Twitter? Do you,

600
00:35:11,161 --> 00:35:15,080
do you get on Twitter all the time? Not
all the time, but I do it if I get drunk.

601
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:20,030
You know, there's some profound
ball, great way to promote Gig.

602
00:35:20,031 --> 00:35:24,950
But yeah, your braid at that shit. Was it
all? Yeah. Do you do it before each week?

603
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:28,100
Taj got me into it. He
did it. He did a retweet.

604
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,780
I went from like four followers
to 10,000 because he retweeted me.

605
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,600
Read and read it. Yeah. Yeah. Touches.
Uh, he's, he's gigantic. Right.

606
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:40,080
And you know what's weird about
Twitter and like just being,

607
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,640
being around for awhile,
Justin Bieber has like 44 million,

608
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,480
something like that. And Paul
Mccartney has a million. Right.

609
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,180
And I know it's different worlds,
but isn't that incredible though?

610
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,480
It is kind of incredible.
It seems like a,

611
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,280
I mean I don't think Paul Mccartney
is tweeting all the time in the, yeah.

612
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,080
Does he use it? Cause Justin
Bieber actually uses, yeah. Yeah.

613
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,390
That's the big thing with one of those
guys. He's always in the laugh factory.

614
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:07,800
You know, he wants to do stand
up. What are you putting on? Oh,

615
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:12,360
it's just a story of a Bieber getting
his house raided this morning. Oh yeah.

616
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,070
Cocaine so far in it. And
they're looking forward to he,

617
00:36:17,071 --> 00:36:21,300
cause he recently Egged his neighbors
house and caused over at 15 to $20,000

618
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:23,270
worth of damage, allegedly, allegedly.

619
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:28,100
But supposedly there's video allegedly
and I guess over $400. It's a, you know,

620
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,260
a felony. So they, uh,
they're raiding his home,

621
00:36:31,261 --> 00:36:34,110
looking for any connections to that.
And you know,

622
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,520
if they find any drugs on the way,

623
00:36:35,521 --> 00:36:39,690
they can just arrest him for anything
crazy as they need 10 cop cars to arrest

624
00:36:39,691 --> 00:36:44,040
Justin Bieber. Oh Wow. They
took him in. Yeah. Yeah.

625
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:47,670
I think what the deal is is like if
recently in the news they've been just,

626
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:50,320
he's been just terrorizing his
neighborhood. He's been terrorizing.

627
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,130
They just got a posse with them,
you know, which is hilarious.

628
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,340
That would suck if you had
some multimillion dollar
house and you lived in this

629
00:36:56,341 --> 00:36:59,880
really nice place and then you had
this crazy fuck living next door to you

630
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:03,320
driving down the street like 50 miles
per hour while your daughter's in this

631
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,840
draft, that would suck. You think
will end up killing himself. Well,

632
00:37:06,841 --> 00:37:11,450
if he's doing the coke, it's
not a good sign. I ran IRA.
No, doing the coke is not,

633
00:37:11,451 --> 00:37:14,190
not nobody just like
is really good at coke.

634
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:17,520
Like there's some people that are
good at surfing. Surfing's hard.

635
00:37:17,521 --> 00:37:20,050
If I tried surfing, I'd fall flat
on my fucking face. I mean hell,

636
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,220
if you get good at surfing, you do it
for a while. You learn how to perfect it.

637
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,910
No one ever gets that way with coconut
in. He said to you a long time ago, Joe,

638
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:30,930
that uh, when you did pot, it changed
you and I think it really helped you.

639
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,150
I never said that about coke
when there was, you know,

640
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:36,630
Tony's doing a lot more coke lately.
Usually done his life together. Yeah.

641
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:40,170
A lot of people say that about meth guys
do math and all of a sudden they really

642
00:37:40,171 --> 00:37:41,490
fucking straighten up.

643
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,450
Get the life in order to
pull your gums look good.

644
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,690
Well that's the problem with
labeling a drug is a drug, you know,

645
00:37:48,691 --> 00:37:52,260
like saying it's a drug. If it seems like
they're all the same thing, you know,

646
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,730
they're the, what a drug is, is
something that affects your brain.

647
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:00,870
But the vast majority of them are good.

648
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,730
Like there's a lot of good drugs.
There's a lot of like a to drug.

649
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,920
I don't think it affects your
friends. A good drug to drug. I mean,

650
00:38:07,921 --> 00:38:12,330
you might not like it, but
I like a fucking cup of
coffee. It's good. You know?

651
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,440
Uh, I liked the fact that,
uh, you know, there's,

652
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,860
there's drugs that could
help people that are sick.

653
00:38:19,861 --> 00:38:23,460
There's drugs that can help people
that are in intense pain. There's drug,

654
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:26,640
there's a lot of drugs that have
like some real beneficial effects.

655
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,470
And then there's drugs
that will ruin your life.

656
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,630
There's drugs and nobody survives.
There's the, the opiates, the heroin,

657
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,470
the math, the, the speeds,

658
00:38:35,471 --> 00:38:38,320
the ones where you hear about these
terrible stories of people's lives

659
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:42,070
completely fallen apart. You can, I mean,
you can kind of include pot in there.

660
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:46,390
I've heard people talk about other
people that ruin their life on pause,

661
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,550
but that's them inside.
That's just the,

662
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:50,620
they're looking for something
to ruin their life. I agree.

663
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,940
And I'd see that the same way as gambling.
You know, uh, the gambling thing.

664
00:38:55,270 --> 00:39:00,270
People think that a compulsive gambling
is a very different than drug addiction.

665
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,490
I don't think it's different at
all. No, I think it's all the same.

666
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,390
Some somehow or another,
you get hooked on a drug.

667
00:39:07,391 --> 00:39:09,910
Except this time you're getting
a drug from taking a risk.

668
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,170
I believe you can have that with sex. Oh
sure. With anything. It's masturbation.

669
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,910
This guys that have masturbated there,

670
00:39:15,911 --> 00:39:19,450
Dick Ra and then like tried to
figure out other ways of jerking off.

671
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:22,930
I'm not looking at you in the eyes
cause it's you. I'm just saying.

672
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,270
Yeah. If everything we, it's weird isn't
it? That people get addicted to stuff.

673
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,360
The physical addictive part is really
weird that we like a chemical attaches

674
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,100
itself to our system and
then you need that chemical.

675
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,620
I guess what they say about Amy Winehouse.

676
00:39:38,621 --> 00:39:42,010
They found no drugs in her system and
they think that she just quit drinking.

677
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,840
And if you are really serious alcoholic
and you just cut it off entirely,

678
00:39:46,841 --> 00:39:51,400
you can actually die for it and go into
convulsions. Wow. I didn't know that.

679
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Amy Winehouse, when
she died, apparently it was just boobs,

680
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,770
you know, and everybody looks at her and
you think of her as this, uh, this mess.

681
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,633
You know,
this,

682
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:06,040
this awful drug addict boozer pill pop in,
but really,

683
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:10,090
you know, it was alcohol. Well, I love the
drink, you know, it's still drink a lot,

684
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:14,950
but I, uh, I would never wake up and
drink. Like that's, that's, I mean,

685
00:40:14,951 --> 00:40:19,270
I'm not saying that's a good,
I'm not condoning light type of drink and,

686
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,640
but man, when you wake up and have
a couple of shots, that's a Tirtun,

687
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,840
you're not going to last long doing that.
That you're,

688
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,030
you're really putting
your liver into overdrive.

689
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:32,920
Amy Winehouse was talented as fuck
though. God Damn, she could sing.

690
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:34,760
She had such a sultry voice.

691
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,320
But do you ever hear about people not
talented because he, nobody cares. I mean,

692
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:41,440
it's like, look at all the
great people that died at 27,

693
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,700
like the people from the sixties Joplin
shampooing smarts and all three of them

694
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:50,350
died at 27. Yeah, 27 minutes.
That was a baby at 27.

695
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,510
And it was so stupid. Like it was play
basketball. I was in the comedian yet.

696
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,950
Well, I think we missed,
um, that generation that,

697
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,600
that Hendrix and Janice Joplin generation,

698
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:03,490
if you talk to anybody
that went through that,

699
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,760
they say that the change from the time
of their parents was so massive and it

700
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:12,820
was so much different than anything
that's cultured ever seen before.

701
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:17,350
It was a revolutionary change
and that was all fueled by drugs.

702
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,220
All of that.
That was marijuana and LSD specifically.

703
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,140
That's what was changed
and all those people,

704
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:28,740
and that's why they came up with that
sweeping psychedelic act in 1970 that made

705
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:29,980
everything illegal.

706
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,640
They didn't even have to have
like proof bioavailability.

707
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,240
Like they made some stuff illegal.
That doesn't even affect you.

708
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,760
It doesn't even work. It was legal. It
was legal before that, right? Yeah. Acid.

709
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,970
Mushrooms. I just used to get people
at Cary grant used to take acid.

710
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:54,320
Wow, that's heavy. Yeah. Well they
say, supposedly according to Mckenna,

711
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:58,640
the federal government, uh, originally
came up when they found out about acid,

712
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,350
they thought it was going
to be a truth serum.

713
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,800
They thought that they were going to be
ready to give it to the enemy, grab them,

714
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:05,240
hook them up with acid,

715
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,530
and then they would tell him all the
coordinates for the MTA enemy basis and

716
00:42:09,531 --> 00:42:12,470
then they found out it was not a truth.
Here I'm, there's no fucking way.

717
00:42:12,471 --> 00:42:14,290
This is the truth here.
If you ever take it. No.

718
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,800
So then they decided that it was going
to be something that they would give

719
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:21,200
their soldiers in case
they ever got caught.

720
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:23,930
You wouldn't tell the truth,

721
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:28,400
but could you fucking imagine
the there you're getting,

722
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,810
you're in war. Okay. You're some poor
kid. You've been shipped off to Germany,

723
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,840
you got a machine gun in your hand.
People are shooting at, you know,

724
00:42:35,841 --> 00:42:39,560
bullets are whizzing overhead
and you get captured. Well,

725
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:42,860
how fucking terrified of you. You're
shitting your pants. You're going to die.

726
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:46,850
Oh my God, I'm getting captured by
the Nazis. And then you'd take acid

727
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:52,400
like was there ever worst advice ever?
I mean,

728
00:42:52,401 --> 00:42:55,910
proof positive that the government is
not looking out for your best interests.

729
00:42:56,210 --> 00:43:01,070
They give you fucking acid to take when
you get captured by enemy. Holy Fuck.

730
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:02,810
That's so ridiculous.
Well,

731
00:43:02,811 --> 00:43:06,440
that was always like a paranoia of mine
is getting somebody to put something in.

732
00:43:06,441 --> 00:43:08,960
My drink should be.
There's a lot of assholes out there.

733
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:13,250
I never leave but drink on the bar.
I never, you know, I always tell,

734
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:14,360
especially women don't,

735
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:17,570
don't trust anybody and listened to me
with somebody who loves you. You know,

736
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:21,710
I've talked to many people that believe
that they were drugged many people.

737
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:24,920
I think that there's a lot of guys out
there that do that on a regular basis.

738
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:29,950
It's one of the most disgusting things
about men is this thing that you keep

739
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:33,290
hearing about. I mean, I'm sure it
happens with women that women do it too,

740
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:35,960
whether to other women or whether the men,

741
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,810
but I hear about it with
men doing it to women a lot.

742
00:43:38,811 --> 00:43:42,200
It's scary that someone
would be willing to do that.

743
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:47,030
That there's such a fucking sociopath
that d willing to drug someone who wants

744
00:43:47,031 --> 00:43:50,240
to be with somebody who's just asleep. I
mean, I guess it's a different kind of,

745
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,163
they just wanted,

746
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,380
I think it's part of it is they know
they're doing something evil. Yeah.

747
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,740
I think part of it is they know they're
getting away with something and they

748
00:43:57,770 --> 00:44:00,860
just want to do it. Cause it's
a crazy rush. Yeah. You know,

749
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,510
I was thinking about that with rape.
You know,

750
00:44:02,511 --> 00:44:05,750
there was a woman who was raped
in the lower east side, uh,

751
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,210
like not of her body hang out with this
thing. I can't believe I went there.

752
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:16,370
That's not funny. Tom. Stop
laughs. Funny Joe. It's
horrible. It's quick. But anyway,

753
00:44:16,371 --> 00:44:20,300
uh, I was thinking about like, how to fuck
these stay hard. I mean, it's gotta be,

754
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:20,870
uh,

755
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:24,970
just anger and violence because it can't
be sex or anything because I was like,

756
00:44:24,971 --> 00:44:27,690
hey, how are you gonna stay hot when
you're hurting somebody? You know, there,

757
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:31,800
there's some people take their clothes
off and fucking, it's crazy. Yeah.

758
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:36,120
I think some people just have
a horrible view of humanity,

759
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,670
of themselves, of other people. You know,

760
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,690
that almost all comes down to,

761
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,050
if you're willing to do that to somebody
else like that, you don't love yourself.

762
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,390
You don't love yourself,
you haven't been treated with love.

763
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,450
It's really that simple, if you
will. If you want to hurt someone,

764
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,790
scare them and put terror in them,
and that somehow or another,

765
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:57,150
it gives you joy or gives you some
sort of a rush and you're willing to

766
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:59,520
sacrifice this person's safety and health.

767
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,650
You don't understand the connection
between human beings like you.

768
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,380
You've been raised in a terrible way.

769
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,350
Whatever's happened to you
along the way is a disaster.

770
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,110
It just shows you terrifying
aspect of society.

771
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,620
How differently can be programmed. Yeah.
You could react like that, you know?

772
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:14,311
Oh yeah.
I mean,

773
00:45:14,311 --> 00:45:18,060
think about all the different variables
when it comes to creating a human being.

774
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:20,760
And you know, if you get
abused, that's the big one.

775
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:24,280
And people that have been abused and the
recidivism rate for people that were,

776
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:28,140
uh, raped themselves, you know, the,

777
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,310
the way that they turn to, uh, to
violence and violent sexuality, it's,

778
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,770
it's really, really common. You
know? And then the people that do it,

779
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,840
the people that abused kids are abused.
Anybody.

780
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:44,460
The real issue with the is
they don't seem to get better.

781
00:45:44,970 --> 00:45:47,460
Like it's a weird thing.
Like they always have that desire.

782
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:50,820
They had this guy on a talk show once
and he was talking about it and it was,

783
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,230
he was a sex Predator and he
was a reform sex predator.

784
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:58,710
You did time and all that jazz and
it would just talk about how when the

785
00:45:58,711 --> 00:46:02,490
thoughts come up he just fights,
fights them back. So he was reformed.

786
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:06,180
Cause a lot of them say that they can't
pay reform. Well he says he can't.

787
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:08,060
I mean he's controlling it.
Right.

788
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:12,120
But I mean the fact is he's also admitting
that he has these feelings all the

789
00:46:12,121 --> 00:46:16,200
time. It's a fucked up thing.
Like what did it, what is that?

790
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,130
I mean we want to hate and we
want to judge and you know,

791
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,600
it is an awful,

792
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,660
awful aspect of humanity but just strictly
scientifically like what is that he

793
00:46:27,871 --> 00:46:31,300
was molested most likely, right? Yeah.

794
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:35,640
Most likely unless there's something else
wrong and the development of the mind,

795
00:46:35,641 --> 00:46:40,020
some blood got cut off to the wrong
area. I mean, I don't know, I'm guessing,

796
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,810
but fuck man, that's a
terrible combination. We,

797
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,440
we must figure out how to eliminate
that if you will eliminate it.

798
00:46:49,441 --> 00:46:51,950
If you look at all the,
like the, you know,

799
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,960
look at the 180 degrees of possibilities
of people from really nice people too.

800
00:46:57,301 --> 00:47:01,860
Really fucking evil people.
The really evil is a small number.

801
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,280
If you could just eliminate all the
really fucked up shit people do well on a

802
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:10,620
murder and rape. If you could
just take away murder and rape,

803
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:14,760
just those two murder, rape and robbery,
I can understand murder more than rape.

804
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,270
Well, I can understand it. Yeah.
And most especially, you know,

805
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:21,680
when you hear about how hot people get
just to know a row at a movie theater,

806
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,100
you know, guy shots got shoots,
a guy for texting, you know,

807
00:47:25,230 --> 00:47:28,290
and whatever words were exchanged,
but yeah.

808
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:32,320
But if you could eliminate just that small
amount, boy would things be different?

809
00:47:32,321 --> 00:47:36,430
Man, if you could just figure
out a way to not develop rapists,

810
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:40,150
not grow up murderers, not let you know,
if we just figured out how to do that.

811
00:47:40,420 --> 00:47:42,190
Just those things that
none of us have done.

812
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:45,910
Just those things that most of our
friends haven't done. Just take those,

813
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,400
you know,
just those,

814
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:51,850
those are the rare occurrences and
eliminate them or drastically reduce them.

815
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,330
The whole world would be different.
Remember that comedian Vince something?

816
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:59,860
Vince champ or yeah, the one was the
rapist and he would go into colleges,

817
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:02,770
colleges,
but also the patterns seem to be,

818
00:48:02,771 --> 00:48:07,230
he'd go into the music department where
it was sound proof the room and when the

819
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,410
girl be playing piano,
there's some practicing piano and that's,

820
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,780
that's what he would do. You
know, he had the whole thing
down. Oh No. Oh, that's us.

821
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:17,260
His name and Vince Chat. I think
it was Vince champ. I don't know.

822
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:21,970
I think that's the name because
a on the wall, the Austin club,

823
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,740
cap city, they used to have this Vince
champ joke. I forget what the joke,

824
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:31,480
really, very distasteful about.
Like when he got arrested for rape.

825
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:35,310
There's some joke about it.
Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot.

826
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:38,140
That's a long way from a Dui.
Yeah.

827
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:41,050
Well it's also like a really
creepy thing at this guy doing,

828
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,230
he was doing it over and over again and
he was telling them to pray for him.

829
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,340
Oh really? Yeah. Yeah. He was,

830
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:52,630
he would rape these girls and tell them
to pray for him. Was that the right name?

831
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:57,340
Right ban? It looks like it. Yeah. Yeah.
That's my guy. Or Black Guy. Black, black.

832
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:02,350
Like there's all these reports saying
like, he was a nice guy. Everyone said

833
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,670
it's fairly religious. Fell out. Yeah.

834
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,170
And he's still in jail. Oh yeah.
He'll be in jail for a while.

835
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,930
Yeah. They keep me in jail for a long
time. When you're a serial rapist, I mean,

836
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,080
how long is he in jail? Right. That
down alone with my comedy club,

837
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:24,370
it's gotta be more than 25 years. Right.
Convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery.

838
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,290
He stole two.
That wasn't enough.

839
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,960
And when not just talking jokes,
dumb.

840
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:35,140
He probably took like little pieces
of things from them or something.

841
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,680
That's oftentimes people
supposedly do that.

842
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:42,970
Take little pieces of something from
you but connects them like as a trophy.

843
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,220
Several rapes of the the music,
like playing the piano exam.

844
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,620
So awful.
19 year old,

845
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:57,190
he was convicted and given life sentences
for two assaults in Iowa with time

846
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:58,600
served for could be Harry,

847
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:03,080
he could be released in 2025
he'll be 64 years old. Cute.

848
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:07,840
How his life? 2025 how to do that. Yeah.

849
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,220
Life doesn't really mean life
anymore. It's like 30 years. His life.

850
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:15,400
Well they're too busy putting people in
jail for POCs so there's no fucking room.

851
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:17,680
Yeah, that's dear. What they're
doing with the people in Denver,

852
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:22,540
the not letting them use banks. I mean
weed is legal there. They're selling weed.

853
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,060
They made over a million dollars in the
first day and the government says you

854
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:29,810
can't put your money in the bank. Well,
what are you going to do? Exactly.

855
00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:32,210
Wait, the people that are
selling the weed, exactly.

856
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:34,550
The people that are
owning these pot shops.

857
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:38,510
So this is the doctors or anything like,
like California. There's just no, no, no,

858
00:50:38,511 --> 00:50:42,020
this is stores. This is
just, damn. Then? Well,

859
00:50:42,021 --> 00:50:44,720
it's just like anything else.
It's in a store.

860
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:48,440
It's like selling tense or
fucking microphone arms, you know,

861
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:49,850
it's whatever he's selling a product.

862
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,230
But the fact that this is
available for sale and they,

863
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:55,940
they have licenses and they start
selling it and retail outlets, outlets.

864
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,190
But the government says you
can't put your money in the bank.

865
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,960
So they run into like some
serious danger because you're,

866
00:51:01,961 --> 00:51:04,160
you're talking about
massive amounts of cash.

867
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:07,490
But they probably had a lot of cash
before it was legal. I don't think so.

868
00:51:07,730 --> 00:51:08,391
Why would you think so?

869
00:51:08,391 --> 00:51:11,360
I mean some people are just people that
took a chance and started a business.

870
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:11,631
Yeah.

871
00:51:11,631 --> 00:51:15,430
But they didn't pay with credit cards
for when they sold pot of the streets.

872
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:16,670
I need dealers,
you know?

873
00:51:16,671 --> 00:51:19,450
How do you know that they were dealers
before this house? I don't, this is the,

874
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:24,020
see this is now that it's legal in the
state. This is like a protected business.

875
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:26,360
It's a business.
I mean it's a real legal business.

876
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,980
They have a license to
do it and everything.

877
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:32,570
So it becomes a weird thing when you don't
let those people put the money in the

878
00:51:32,571 --> 00:51:35,510
bank because you're creating
a really dangerous situation.

879
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:37,880
That doesn't make sense.
Yeah, it's really dangerous.

880
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:41,450
I never thought the eleague legality of
pod made sense and I don't even smoke

881
00:51:41,451 --> 00:51:44,750
cause I have no agenda. It's just
such a stupid thing as such. I mean,

882
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:46,160
compared to anything else.

883
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,030
Well it shows you how the government is
not looking out for your best interest.

884
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,900
If they're willing to take these people
who are doing something that they voted

885
00:51:53,901 --> 00:51:58,490
on and they deem lawful and take these
people and put them in a weird situation

886
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,370
where they can't put their money
in a bank, you're being a bully.

887
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:05,780
Like you're being a cunty shitty bully
and it's not, it doesn't make sense.

888
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,300
Like you're not protecting
anybody with this. This is,

889
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:10,720
this is actually putting people in danger.
So what do you do?

890
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:12,050
You're not going to arrest them.

891
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:16,100
You're going to agree to the state says
it's legal in states rights as you know,

892
00:52:16,101 --> 00:52:20,300
as we all agreed on when they formed
this silly country states' rights as

893
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:21,500
opposed to take precedent,

894
00:52:21,501 --> 00:52:25,250
it's supposed to be the number one thing
and then the federal government is only

895
00:52:25,251 --> 00:52:28,820
in charge in times of crisis
and emergency in war and,

896
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:32,460
but you're supposed to be able to
vote on things like in, in your state.

897
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,990
The premise, it's like a little
spite move. It's a cut move.

898
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,440
It's a total cunt move. And it's not
just a cut move, it's, it's, it's,

899
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:43,630
it's nerve wracking. It's a, it's
like you're forcing these people to,

900
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,340
to stockpile money.
If they want to be in business,

901
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:48,110
they'd have to take bags
of money out of there.

902
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:51,230
Anybody could just rob them at any point
in time and you know it and they know

903
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:55,310
it. And so you put them in this situation
where they become targets and it's a

904
00:52:55,311 --> 00:52:58,140
really sneaky way of being a cunt.
Well,

905
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:00,590
you would think that they would want
the money to become part of the system

906
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:01,940
because more money,

907
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:06,560
someone's resisting and they think somehow
or another as they lose ground over

908
00:53:06,561 --> 00:53:07,371
and over and over again,

909
00:53:07,371 --> 00:53:10,340
they're going to do this one thing
that's going to be good and get,

910
00:53:10,341 --> 00:53:12,860
get him back to the victory column,
but it's not.

911
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,950
There's too much information now.
It's not going to work anymore.

912
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:16,910
He can't do it anymore.

913
00:53:16,911 --> 00:53:20,090
You can't tell us that we can't do
something that's normal and natural.

914
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:21,260
There's nothing wrong with pod.

915
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:24,890
If you tell us we can't put money
in the bank because we sell pot,

916
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:27,780
then we tell you what fucking bank,
what are you talking about?

917
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:31,830
Who runs this bank? Why? How can you
decide what the fuck happens in this bank?

918
00:53:31,831 --> 00:53:34,470
Is the government, the bank
connected? Like what's going on here?

919
00:53:34,471 --> 00:53:38,600
How can you make this decision?
But who owns the money?
Right? You know, why can't,

920
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,130
why can't someone who's legally
making it put it in the bank?

921
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,720
What are you trying to pull here?
Well,

922
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:44,730
you're doing a business
move is what you're doing.

923
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,760
You're blocking someone out of business.
That's what you're doing.

924
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,610
What's known as they still got those.
They sell pot and shrubbery.

925
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,820
So there's there Megan, the
money. What do you do? How do you,

926
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,150
who dictates which money came from the
pilot? I mean you'll have to ever see it.

927
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:01,710
Oh, okay. Dot. Merera I counted
to one. Oh Lord is a whip Joe.

928
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:05,580
It's why, you know you can't deduct
everything if you deduct too much.

929
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:09,360
The government goes after you just in
spite and then they go after your ass.

930
00:54:09,670 --> 00:54:11,840
They'll pick up your ass every four years.

931
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:15,480
So like I remember when before they had
the claim stuff and I was a valet in

932
00:54:15,481 --> 00:54:18,690
Brooklyn, I w we wouldn't
make so much fucking money.

933
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:22,170
I had a suitcase full of full of ones.
It looked like I rubbed the dollar store.

934
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:23,940
It was the greatest then know.

935
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,550
Now waiters and waitresses
have to claim everything.

936
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:31,770
But that was a great world in the
eighties before the oil changed.

937
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:35,740
They came down hard on them. On tips.
Yeah. Do you ever work for tips?

938
00:54:35,741 --> 00:54:40,550
Show you um, sort of,
I worked at a car wash.

939
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,710
You got paid in tips there. All
right. A couple of different places.

940
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:48,690
Driver kind of limo driver. Yeah. You
got tips as a limo driver, but you know,

941
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,510
it's not the big part. It
never had a waiter though. No,

942
00:54:51,511 --> 00:54:55,580
I never worked as a waiter. I worked as
a cook a couple of places. Really? Yeah.

943
00:54:55,970 --> 00:54:56,731
Or it does cook it.

944
00:54:56,731 --> 00:55:00,660
A Papa Ginos and Massachusetts and
a place called Newport creamery.

945
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:04,410
That's gotta be fucking cheeseburgers
and Shit. That was a kid in high school.

946
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,240
It was good gig.
Everyone was fucking everybody.

947
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,463
Oh my God.

948
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:14,870
There was these hot girls that worked
at Newport creamery and me and a couple

949
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:18,120
other savages guys. And uh, it was,

950
00:55:18,121 --> 00:55:22,170
we were all coming into puberty.
Everybody was like 16,

951
00:55:22,171 --> 00:55:25,950
17, you know, we were all coming into,
I shouldn't even say puberty. We're,

952
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,020
we're becoming uh,
men,

953
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:31,800
young adults and men and
everybody was fucking, everybody.

954
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,430
There was like this constant hookup.
It was like all this gossip,

955
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:40,800
flip cheeseburgers, getting
laid dues. Great. It's all
bores. All high school kids.

956
00:55:40,801 --> 00:55:43,170
It was a complete,
utter orgy.

957
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,900
Hell was this,

958
00:55:45,901 --> 00:55:49,980
the girl who was the fucking worked
at the counter would blow you and,

959
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:54,570
and this and this guy was trying to bang
everybody and this guy didn't give a

960
00:55:54,571 --> 00:55:59,571
fuck and this girl fuck these three guys
one night she got hammered and it was

961
00:56:00,421 --> 00:56:03,870
craziness. We know there's a girl at the
lift factor. It really wants to fuck you.

962
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:06,990
You, yeah. And I told her, she lives like,

963
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:12,180
she's asking me last night, she knows
I talk about this in the air. No, no.

964
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:16,050
Everything's cool. I totally, you're
married and happy and loving family.

965
00:56:16,051 --> 00:56:20,430
So I said leave him alone. Thank you.
Appreciate it. Well you got a damn wolves.

966
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:23,990
I think it'd be

967
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:25,460
way creepy.
Or if you were a chick though,

968
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:27,470
if you're a famous check that
a bunch of guys wanted to fuck,

969
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:30,480
that would be very unnerving.
That shit would be

970
00:56:30,910 --> 00:56:35,720
Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer.
Yeah. All the comedian.

971
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:38,620
Yeah. We've seen a lot of
guys want to fuck her. Oh
yeah. Do you want to fuck her?

972
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:42,190
Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I
do. It's a weird time for confession.

973
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:47,290
I feel better now. Get it off my
mind. My mind. Where'd that come from?

974
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,190
All of a sudden you're talking about
Amy Schumer. Amy Schumer. What's that?

975
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,550
You have walk went off to Amy Schumer. No,
I don't do it. I know what I go off to.

976
00:56:54,551 --> 00:56:55,930
Individuals groups.

977
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:02,650
Do you have like a wall?
Oh, female comedian. Oh,

978
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,550
Sarah Silver.
Blue Janeane.

979
00:57:05,551 --> 00:57:10,360
Garofalo although I like
women. Oh, how dare you.

980
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:15,610
How dare you? She's a woman. She the
funniest. Let me tell you something.

981
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,470
I worked in Montreal for fucking years.
I'm one thing.

982
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:22,480
She has his balls and
she's a good actress,

983
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:27,010
but I have never seen anybody suck the
energy out of a room that you know how a

984
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:31,090
member of the club soda and she
is so fucking strong a woman,

985
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,840
but she's so fucking with people. She
was so bad that they didn't know what to.

986
00:57:34,841 --> 00:57:38,110
I saw people like trying to think of
something funny that happened to them that

987
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:42,400
day, so maybe they could smile
and she died so badly and then I,

988
00:57:42,401 --> 00:57:45,490
and she turns to me and it's like almost
in slow motion, like a twilight zone.

989
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,390
She goes down, did you give me the line?
I got to Janine, I don't kill the lights.

990
00:57:48,391 --> 00:57:51,430
I'm pissed hosting the show. Whatever you
want. Do you want to come off? She goes,

991
00:57:51,431 --> 00:57:55,600
no, I'll stay. I'll stay in fucking
die for three more minutes. Oh,

992
00:57:56,070 --> 00:57:57,250
it was brutal.
Anyway,

993
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,170
well she's a person that,
she's very smart, obviously.

994
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:04,320
She's very opinionated.
She was a good radio host.

995
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:08,340
She was on that Air America show. She's
just snotty. Fuck. It's the very smart,

996
00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:11,400
but she's smart in that,
in that intelligence,

997
00:58:11,401 --> 00:58:14,670
you can sometimes be like really
caught up in it and take yourself super

998
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:17,550
seriously. And then when you do, a lot
of times you lose your sense of humor.

999
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:21,190
She was so rude to me.
I did mark Merrin's podcast and uh,

1000
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,240
in Austin and she was on,

1001
00:58:23,241 --> 00:58:27,890
and she said they were talking about
some terrorist thing and I just,

1002
00:58:27,891 --> 00:58:31,280
I said, oh, that, you know, I named
the wrong guy. Right. I was just like,

1003
00:58:31,281 --> 00:58:34,310
not paying attention. Her and Norton
and people, she goes, is he serious?

1004
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,390
It's easier. Like I wasn't
there. He's serious. I just
wanting to fucking throttle.

1005
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,780
And I just was nice. And then when I
went on stage with her, I was flying.

1006
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,520
That's a very Hollywood move of
what is he serious? Is he serious?

1007
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:51,420
Well, you know, you interrupted, they're
really exciting. Talk About Obscure Shit,

1008
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:54,840
right?
Or political shit or you know,

1009
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:58,440
world leaders that they think
need to be addressed. Yeah.

1010
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,550
People get angry if people are
not on the same page. You know,

1011
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,230
I think it's funny when
I talked to someone,

1012
00:59:04,231 --> 00:59:06,750
they don't even know what the fuck
Twitter is. I think it's funny.

1013
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,330
I don't get angry at them. I don't
care. Like she don't know Twitter,

1014
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:11,730
like really what you
know is what you know.

1015
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:15,360
I mean, look, I know a lot about sports.
You don't follow the NFL like I do,

1016
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,690
but I would never be like, can appoint
Joe. How could you not know that?

1017
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:19,800
The only thing I could

1018
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,860
see it'd be annoying is
if you were interrupting.

1019
00:59:22,010 --> 00:59:25,400
If it was like it was like a really
important conversation for them and they

1020
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:27,200
thought they were really
getting out a good point.

1021
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:30,680
And you were crack at some chuck about
the wrong guy. No, I didn't do that.

1022
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:33,650
I just was asking was that the guy?

1023
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:37,340
And then that's when she said it was
the guy who was the president of Iran.

1024
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,220
They were talking about people
take themselves really seriously.

1025
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,170
But I've done that before.

1026
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:45,500
I've taken myself too seriously before
or getting too caught up in an idea

1027
00:59:45,501 --> 00:59:47,660
before the point where, uh, you know,

1028
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,260
think it's more important than
just being a person you have.

1029
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,330
It's part of that Ismet which makes
you such a fucking hilarious comedian

1030
00:59:53,331 --> 00:59:58,331
because your point of view is
unobstructed eagle or once you believe in

1031
00:59:58,971 --> 01:00:01,940
something and that's it. And I like
that, just kind of commitment to it,

1032
01:00:02,450 --> 01:00:03,590
you know what I mean?
I mean,

1033
01:00:03,591 --> 01:00:07,100
when you like the things
about the universe and when
you get into certain things,

1034
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:08,660
I don't know how much you really know,

1035
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:13,070
but I feel it's almost like you're
preaching, but not in a bad way. Not In a,

1036
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:16,550
not in a pedantic way, but just
in a way it's like, Holy Shit.

1037
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:18,080
I think that's why he has so many fans.

1038
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:22,100
Cause you felt fucking strong in your
beliefs. Some more people waiver then you.

1039
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,800
Hmm. Um, maybe, I don't know, man.

1040
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,810
When we talk about things like the
universe or just the realities of this

1041
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,970
strange dimension that we exist and we
have that same thought about we are,

1042
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,640
we've applied the same thought about
the Earth's orbit and we have no control

1043
01:00:37,641 --> 01:00:40,970
over it. Cause I told you that
[inaudible] thing that I have, right?

1044
01:00:40,971 --> 01:00:44,180
We'll walk onto the beach and be afraid
that would be sucked into the atmosphere.

1045
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:46,730
And that's fucking where
it gets pretty crazy.

1046
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:51,290
And like I'd be the first one since
the blessing mother that ascended into

1047
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:53,240
heaven. You know, you're
just laying on the beach.

1048
01:00:53,241 --> 01:00:56,240
All of a sudden I'm fucking
shooting up into the sky. The Sky.

1049
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,690
That's a weird fear. I
know. But I always worked.

1050
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,350
I always carry anchors
with me to the beach.

1051
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,730
We're so lucky that this is a time
where you could go onto just, you know,

1052
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:12,760
space.com or any io nine.com there's a
million different websites that could

1053
01:01:13,071 --> 01:01:17,870
show you these crazy videos of the
universe and crazy new things every day.

1054
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:23,150
I think this would be a shame to not
like take part in the wonder of that all

1055
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:27,620
because it's all going on right now and
he's the revelations that these guys are

1056
01:01:27,621 --> 01:01:32,180
figuring out on a weekly, monthly and
yearly basis are fucking incredible.

1057
01:01:32,181 --> 01:01:37,181
They just took a photograph of a planet
and a star do something million light

1058
01:01:37,851 --> 01:01:42,050
years away. It's already burned out,
but we just got the light from it. Yeah.

1059
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:45,110
Is that true? Yeah. And it's already,
it's already gone in reality,

1060
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:50,030
but it took so long for the light to
get here. We just got, it hurts my brain

1061
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:55,220
that it's my brain.
When you're looking at a star,

1062
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,640
you're seeing a star that
may be already gone. Well,

1063
01:01:58,641 --> 01:02:01,580
the thing that fucks me up is that
there's no end to the universe.

1064
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,660
Cause I'm used to doing in like the
end of the trail, the end of this,

1065
01:02:05,661 --> 01:02:07,910
the end of a relationship,
some kind of fucking and,

1066
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,800
but there's no end to the immense
enormity of space that that blows me away.

1067
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:16,220
Well, not only is there no way, I'm a
comedian, this is what they're saying now.

1068
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:20,220
It doesn't make any sense to me,
but they could break. They believe

1069
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:24,450
that the universe may be broken
down into individual sizes,

1070
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:29,810
but then these individual universe is
exist in parallel with a bunch of other

1071
01:02:31,441 --> 01:02:34,440
like infinite number of
individual universities.

1072
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:38,160
So what they think is that this is
impossible for me to even understand,

1073
01:02:38,161 --> 01:02:39,360
so I shouldn't even be relaying it.

1074
01:02:39,361 --> 01:02:44,361
But this is as how it's been explained
inside every black hole they think is the

1075
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:48,270
portal to another universe inside
every galaxy as a black hole.

1076
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,030
So when you look out,
you see 100 million galaxies,

1077
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:55,680
what you're seeing is 100 million
universes and each side each, each galaxy,

1078
01:02:55,681 --> 01:02:59,730
if you go through the black
hole and the cough probably do,

1079
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,890
and somewhere on that,
on those plants.

1080
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:04,590
Imagine if Tiffany Haddish was the first
person at Queen for no microphone and

1081
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:08,130
the university and the whole universe,
the whole.

1082
01:03:08,131 --> 01:03:11,150
If maybe that's what brings the
aliens here, we never thought of that.

1083
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:13,620
We can do that. And we never
thought of that. Not into a mic.

1084
01:03:13,621 --> 01:03:17,910
At least this is truly groundbreaking,
this American art form of stand up comedy.

1085
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,710
But the so what they're, what they're
saying is it's like, it's like a fractal.

1086
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:26,850
A fractal is you ever seen like a
fractal image? No. A fractal images,

1087
01:03:26,851 --> 01:03:31,440
a geometric image that as you get closer
and closer and smaller and smaller and

1088
01:03:31,441 --> 01:03:35,250
closer and you realize that the same image
repeats itself over and over and over

1089
01:03:35,251 --> 01:03:39,330
again, infant in an infinitely. Um,
one of the more fascinating ones.

1090
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:40,950
It's called the Mandelbrot set.

1091
01:03:41,550 --> 01:03:45,780
Google Mandelbrot set fractal,
um,

1092
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:49,050
video cause there's a video
where they show how it works.

1093
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:53,790
It's each, first of all, it
looks like a design. Like you
just look at it, you look,

1094
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,180
it's like, okay, it's just some weird
design. It looks like, uh, like uh,

1095
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,300
I dunno like a logo for a
cartoon or something like that.

1096
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:03,960
Like just some weird design. But then
as you get closer and closer to this,

1097
01:04:03,961 --> 01:04:08,370
design it, it branches out all along.
The edges are not smooth around.

1098
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:12,810
The edges are in fact the
exact same pattern of the,

1099
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,330
of the Mandelbrot set,
the way it looks on the outside.

1100
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:18,690
And then as you get closer and you see
it again and closer and you see it more,

1101
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:22,950
it never ends. It's infinite.
Like what do you got there?

1102
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,510
Mandelbrot set.
You see that thing to the right of it?

1103
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:31,560
See the thing to the right black one.
That's the Mandelbrot set. No, no, no.

1104
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:36,450
The one above it. The one
above that. The see that one?

1105
01:04:36,451 --> 01:04:39,600
The black one? Yeah, that's it. The
black one. That's the Mandelbrot set.

1106
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:44,130
It's a,
fractals are fascinating man,

1107
01:04:44,131 --> 01:04:48,270
because they're able to create these
things with computers that you know,

1108
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:51,300
didn't exist 50 years
ago and I'm actually,

1109
01:04:51,301 --> 01:04:53,190
I don't even know when
they invented fractals,

1110
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:56,040
I think it might've been even
more recently than 50 years ago,

1111
01:04:58,050 --> 01:05:01,800
but the idea behind them all
is, um, that they're infinite.

1112
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:06,500
That as you go deeper into the,
the macro, into the micro, you,

1113
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:09,330
you see that this pattern repeats
itself over and over again.

1114
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:11,170
This is the best way to describe it.

1115
01:05:11,171 --> 01:05:15,360
The fractal is a mathematical set that
typically display self similar patterns,

1116
01:05:15,361 --> 01:05:18,070
which means that they are
the same from near as far.

1117
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,820
Often they have an irregular
or fractured appearance,

1118
01:05:22,180 --> 01:05:23,440
but not always.

1119
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:28,860
Fractals may be exactly the same at every
scale or as illustrated in figure one.

1120
01:05:30,371 --> 01:05:32,470
They may be nearly the
same at different scales.

1121
01:05:32,471 --> 01:05:35,980
The definition of fractal goes
beyond self similarity anyway,

1122
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:39,700
what they think is that
the universe is like this.

1123
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,860
I think that inside every, every
black hole is a whole nother universe.

1124
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:46,630
Not only is it infinite,

1125
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:50,590
but it might even have its own laws and
made it have his own physical laws of

1126
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:53,770
movement and weight and gravity and
light and all those things might be

1127
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:56,680
different. It might be off, it might
be completely different existence,

1128
01:05:57,130 --> 01:06:01,990
and then inside those universes
are hundreds of billions
of galaxies and inside

1129
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:05,170
them hundreds of billions
of infinite new universes.

1130
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:06,820
Why always stick of that when they say,
you know,

1131
01:06:06,821 --> 01:06:09,970
we're searching for a place that
has water so that could have life,

1132
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,720
but how do we know that there can't
be different kinds of lives that don't

1133
01:06:13,721 --> 01:06:16,330
depend on water? It's,
it all hurts my head.

1134
01:06:16,670 --> 01:06:19,670
It all hurts my head and that's
why I'm a comedian. Laser just,

1135
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,260
it really does hurt my head when I,

1136
01:06:24,270 --> 01:06:27,430
when I start thinking about that each
galaxy would actually be infinite.

1137
01:06:27,431 --> 01:06:31,660
Like they'll say that even though maybe
the universe is 15 billion light years

1138
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:35,240
across, it's still infinite
because even though it,

1139
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:38,980
it's impossible to measure
a billion light years. Yeah.

1140
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:40,360
15 billion light years.

1141
01:06:40,361 --> 01:06:45,361
Light travels at 186,000 miles
per second billion and 15 billion.

1142
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:52,030
I mean that's the idea is that the big
bang occurred 14 something billion years

1143
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:55,240
ago and from then on it's
just been this expansion,

1144
01:06:55,241 --> 01:06:58,090
the slow expansion to what we are today.

1145
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:01,150
To what club are you working on this
week? I'm not working. I'll take it.

1146
01:07:01,151 --> 01:07:04,870
I'm going pig hunting. Are you
really the Callan? No, no, no.

1147
01:07:04,871 --> 01:07:07,660
The Steve Vernella.
We're not filming this.

1148
01:07:07,661 --> 01:07:10,180
We're just going to go shoot
some wild boars. Are you serious?

1149
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:14,940
I'm totally serious. Wow. You've got
this whole ultra, that life man. The, um,

1150
01:07:14,950 --> 01:07:17,860
I'm very excited about this whole
hunting thing. I've become obsessed.

1151
01:07:17,890 --> 01:07:21,070
He said you should get a Gopro man. I
would really like to see like, you know,

1152
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:24,970
you can get a GoPro that attaches to your
chest or your helmet or whatever rifle.

1153
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:28,690
Yeah. The GoPro on the rifle would
be the way to go. Right? Yeah.

1154
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:31,150
You see the bullet come out.
I wonder if you can do that.

1155
01:07:31,470 --> 01:07:34,660
Where did he go pick honey? They, they,
it was a ranch. We're going to a ranch.

1156
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:39,730
They put the pigs out there. No, no, no,
no. They're wild. They're wild boars. Wow.

1157
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:43,150
Yeah. They're uh, they're these
crazy looking monster animals.

1158
01:07:43,151 --> 01:07:46,830
Here are some of the wellbore. Yeah,
I've seen, I've seen them. Well,

1159
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,110
wild boars are one of the few animals
that you can hunt all year round because

1160
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,960
they have to keep the population in
the tone check if they don't keep the

1161
01:07:52,961 --> 01:07:55,720
population in check to the
results are disastrous.

1162
01:07:56,020 --> 01:08:00,040
Like perfect example is they opened up a
highway in Texas the night they open it

1163
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:02,770
up. There was some insane
number, like 40 accidents,

1164
01:08:02,771 --> 01:08:05,320
car accidents where people
hitting base. Really? Yeah.

1165
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:09,130
Because they're fucking everywhere.
Texas has an insane amount of pigs,

1166
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:13,240
insane amount, and they're, they're really
out of control to the point where they,

1167
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:14,980
uh,
they eradicate them through helicopters.

1168
01:08:15,330 --> 01:08:18,740
They have helicopters that fly over herds
and just gun them all down. Oh yeah.

1169
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:22,970
It's crazy. Now, do you eat
them? Oh yeah. Oh, they're
delicious. They're really good.

1170
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:26,090
They're really tasty. And
they're, you know, of course,

1171
01:08:26,091 --> 01:08:29,150
depending on what they're eating,
if you get pigs that are near people,

1172
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,940
you're going to get pigs. You know,
they might be eating some garbage.

1173
01:08:31,941 --> 01:08:32,960
They might get ahold of some people,

1174
01:08:32,961 --> 01:08:37,100
but if you're having pigs that are living
out in the wild, there are sort of a,

1175
01:08:37,101 --> 01:08:40,010
they're omnivores, you know, they'll
eat some meat. They'll eat grass is,

1176
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:42,260
they'll eat plants like vegetables.
They eat a lot of things,

1177
01:08:42,261 --> 01:08:45,950
but they're super lean and they're,
uh, they're fucking mean looking.

1178
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:46,610
What does that,

1179
01:08:46,610 --> 01:08:51,440
uh, this is guy named Caleb that I met in
Austin and this is his dogs attacking a

1180
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:54,170
wild boar that got on his farm.
I believe it was

1181
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:59,880
okay. This, I don't want to see his men. I
don't want to see this gross. It's crazy.

1182
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,940
There's a one way they hunt them,
man.

1183
01:09:02,941 --> 01:09:06,510
They use dogs and they sick dogs on
him and the dog's hold it in place.

1184
01:09:06,511 --> 01:09:10,670
Then they come along and cut the pigs
throat. When I say they not this,

1185
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:15,600
this ranch, and they do that in Hawaii
a lot and they do that. And um, uh,

1186
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:19,110
Texas a lot. They use a, these dogs,

1187
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,250
the dogs hold the pig down and they stab
them. It's really kind of fucking crazy.

1188
01:09:23,670 --> 01:09:27,630
I think that a shooting an animal,
it's probably the most ethical way to,

1189
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:31,410
I mean period of ending an animal's life.
If you're gonna eat meat,

1190
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,660
even if you're buying
meat that's in a store,

1191
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:37,610
you're dealing with the fact that that
animal was a fucking slave and animals

1192
01:09:37,650 --> 01:09:41,760
just sitting around waiting for its
death from the moment it was alive.

1193
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,390
But if you get an animal in the wild,
like you're dealing with something,

1194
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:50,100
then it's completely off the grid and
then you're stepping into its world for a

1195
01:09:50,101 --> 01:09:54,120
bit and taking something out of it and
eating that and that's going to be your

1196
01:09:54,121 --> 01:09:55,000
food.
Okay.

1197
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:59,250
Yeah. With having the pigs are attacking
his property as dogs found him on his

1198
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:02,910
product. The dogs were just like walking
around and then the pig attack the dogs.

1199
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,380
Yeah, they'll kick your talks until
your dog will. They go after a person.

1200
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,810
They'll kill people if you
have them in a pen. You know,

1201
01:10:08,811 --> 01:10:11,660
that's a real common thing with
pigs. By the way, these wild pigs,

1202
01:10:11,690 --> 01:10:15,440
according to Steve Vanilla, even wild
boars, it's essentially the same animal.

1203
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,800
They can interbreed. They breed back
and forth to each other. You know,

1204
01:10:18,801 --> 01:10:21,170
there's different strains,
but they're essentially the same animal.

1205
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,230
But if you have a,

1206
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:26,390
you keep domestic pigs and you
fall in when you're feeding
them, good luck, Billy.

1207
01:10:26,460 --> 01:10:29,750
Yeah. They might eat you. They might
just bite the fucking shit out of you.

1208
01:10:29,751 --> 01:10:32,690
And once they bite you and they find
out that they can eat you, they're not,

1209
01:10:32,691 --> 01:10:34,460
they don't care about you.
They're going to keep eating.

1210
01:10:34,461 --> 01:10:37,460
You were going to hold you down and
fucking eat and no evidence. Yeah.

1211
01:10:37,461 --> 01:10:41,240
They'll eat everything and they'll eat.
They'll eat your got damn teeth. They'll,

1212
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:45,140
you'd everything. They'll smash
everything up there. Fucking monsters.

1213
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:50,060
Man and they taste delicious. Nothing
like Bacon. Well, in the F in the south,

1214
01:10:50,061 --> 01:10:54,950
they have a lot of the wild boars and
the domestic hogs. They like sort of uh,

1215
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:59,750
uh, interbreeding and they're making
these giant fucking wild pigs.

1216
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,820
Have you ever seen or heard of Hogzilla
okay, pull up the image of Hogzilla.

1217
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:06,650
You won't even believe
this is a real animal.

1218
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:11,300
They're having these pigs that are like
the size of cows, like a normal pig.

1219
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:15,090
You know, they get pretty
big, you know, domestic pigs,
they get pretty huge. I mean,

1220
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:18,030
I think they can get a
thousand pounds easily. Yeah.

1221
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:22,170
But these fucking things are ridiculous.
Look at the size of that.

1222
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,560
But that's a perspective one. There's
one where it's hanging upside down.

1223
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,910
That's not the Hogzilla one either.

1224
01:11:26,910 --> 01:11:31,680
That's a different in different
large wild boar. That's it.

1225
01:11:32,010 --> 01:11:34,140
Holy Shit. Look at that. Okay.

1226
01:11:34,141 --> 01:11:37,860
That guy is standing right behind that
fucking thing. He's not too far away. See,

1227
01:11:37,861 --> 01:11:40,680
because his foot is parallel
to the paw of the pig.

1228
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:43,860
So the argument that this
is like a perspective shot,

1229
01:11:43,861 --> 01:11:48,530
I think fades away because that guy is
touching that thing that's a big no zero

1230
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:52,080
chance. You come across some of them
where you go, no, no, no, no. Those are,

1231
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:55,450
that's like a deep south thing.
That's a Georgia thing. They've,

1232
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:59,230
they've had that in uh,
I think fucking freaky man.

1233
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,260
Georgia's where they've
gotten the biggest ones.

1234
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,690
So that's a certain kind of
breeding. They breed them. Well, the,

1235
01:12:05,691 --> 01:12:08,520
the wild pigs and the
domestic pigs are breeding.

1236
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:12,870
And then sometimes if they get out,
they can get really big. I mean,

1237
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:15,720
who knows what could be. It
could be that, I'm just guessing,

1238
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:17,820
but it could be that someone
fucked around with genetics.

1239
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:21,900
Look at the size of that thing.
Jesus fucking Christ Dama rarer.

1240
01:12:22,410 --> 01:12:26,640
That is a huge, and telling me it's
fist to, oh, they're run, they run,

1241
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:31,080
they run fast and they're muscular shit,
man. Oh, they're notoriously tough.

1242
01:12:31,290 --> 01:12:35,120
But the flesh is really leading the
way. Good for, you mentioned the old g,

1243
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:38,970
the guy who got killed by a pig.
It's not the first people try not to live.

1244
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:41,390
I wouldn't, I wouldn't think people
would be laughing. Dom, I don't,

1245
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:44,100
what the fuck is wrong with you?
So someone lost her life.

1246
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:45,810
I can't look at that thing.
They it to a pig.

1247
01:12:45,870 --> 01:12:49,980
Look at that fucking pig to tell me don't
think that pig would take you out the

1248
01:12:49,981 --> 01:12:53,270
pigs running after you Joe. I
don't think, I don't know that you,

1249
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,520
if you knew it had a little bit nimble,
nimble him.

1250
01:12:56,580 --> 01:12:59,100
Well your tongue is very
into taking that Xanax.

1251
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:06,900
Yeah, pigs are giant. They can get really
big, real aggressive and they have um,

1252
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:11,760
what is this? It's just mixed in with
the pig photos. It makes no sense.

1253
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:15,540
Um, anyway. Yeah. So pig hunting.

1254
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:21,090
So he goes, I'm doing this weekend. Where
are you working? Uh, Tampa side splitters.

1255
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:26,160
Sorry about the shameless plug. No
worries. An effective, I'll do it again.

1256
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:29,950
People racing at a ranch.
Are you a camping? I'm doing,

1257
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:34,960
I stayed at the hotel. Oh,
talking to Joe. Yeah. Yeah.

1258
01:13:34,961 --> 01:13:38,610
I just did a ranch.
She'd be fascinating.

1259
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,210
Who you going with this guy?
Steve Rinella.

1260
01:13:42,510 --> 01:13:44,760
He's going to be on the podcast Friday.
Oh cool.

1261
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:47,250
Does he is an expert on this
stuff. Yeah. He's a hunter.

1262
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:52,020
He has a TV show called the meat
eater. That's a check it out. Yeah.

1263
01:13:52,230 --> 01:13:53,880
It's exciting stuff.
What's it on in Discovery?

1264
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,550
No meat eaters on like
the sportsman's network.

1265
01:13:56,550 --> 01:13:58,390
I think you got so many
fucking networks do that.

1266
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:00,760
You know they have a military network.
Yeah.

1267
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:02,880
It's all just people get shooting shit.

1268
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:08,260
What was the Hitler network? Well, that's
history. There's a, they called it.

1269
01:14:08,261 --> 01:14:10,920
It will hit. The history is
all like shitty reality shows.

1270
01:14:10,921 --> 01:14:14,110
I moonshiners it's been me and him.
The history channel,

1271
01:14:14,111 --> 01:14:16,390
they showed Hitler more than
anything. Do they really? Well,

1272
01:14:16,391 --> 01:14:18,250
every time I turn it on,
yeah.

1273
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:21,160
History seems to be more like
reality shows now than anything.

1274
01:14:21,161 --> 01:14:25,000
They're all given up. It's almost like
you have to have reality shows on. Yeah.

1275
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:28,720
She tried to put Nova on every night
and fucking science documentaries.

1276
01:14:28,721 --> 01:14:33,460
People just go click and asked whatever
they want to watch. Some rednecks. Yeah.

1277
01:14:33,461 --> 01:14:37,120
What's a duck dynasty? Yeah. Have
you seen moonshiners and is it good?

1278
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:38,610
It's the dumbest one of all time.
But yeah,

1279
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:43,600
it's the most fake domus one of all time
because cops are looking into the car,

1280
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:47,800
like they're shooting this from the car.
The cops looking into the fucking car.

1281
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:51,670
There's a television camera and the cop
doesn't bring it up. The cops like a,

1282
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,470
so where are you off to?
What's going on?

1283
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:57,520
He's looking into the car at the
fucking camera. He's not going,

1284
01:14:57,521 --> 01:15:00,610
what's the camera? What's going on?
What are you doing? No one says, well,

1285
01:15:00,611 --> 01:15:02,770
we're here shooting a TV
show that never comes up.

1286
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:06,490
No one ever says we're shooting a TV show.
So these cops are lying.

1287
01:15:06,491 --> 01:15:08,850
Everyone's lying there.
All fakers they're just staring at,

1288
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:13,570
what if they do another
tick? They probably do their
fucking selling moonshot.

1289
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,180
That's illegal. If it was moonshine,
they would all be arrested.

1290
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:17,650
There would be no show.
I mean,

1291
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:21,540
what they're saying is that they have
these backyard stills, they make moonshot.

1292
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:24,010
So I think now with the trying
to do is say that it's a,

1293
01:15:24,011 --> 01:15:29,011
it's all fiction and then everything has
been legal and nothing illegal and that

1294
01:15:29,261 --> 01:15:33,280
they're making, it's only water in those
stills and it's all just, you know,

1295
01:15:33,281 --> 01:15:35,860
but why do they even have wasn't
shine when alcohol's legal?

1296
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:37,960
Because they want to make their own.

1297
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:40,590
They don't want to have to put a
tax stamp on it. They want to beat,

1298
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,540
be able to make it super potent.
Oh,

1299
01:15:43,030 --> 01:15:45,580
you should be able to make moonshine just
like you should be able to make beer.

1300
01:15:45,581 --> 01:15:47,160
You can make it absent.
Okay.

1301
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:52,540
I think you can get absence and
certain um, certain, uh, dosages.

1302
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:57,240
We were in Ireland and Mitch Hedberg said
to me, you know, he goes, there's Donald,

1303
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,400
he says, I'm, I'm been sober all day. Go,
Oh good for you Mitch. And I love Lynch.

1304
01:16:00,401 --> 01:16:02,900
And he goes, yeah, cause I
want to do absent tonight. No,

1305
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:04,990
look and see what it's like
from zero to a hundred.

1306
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:08,730
So the only reason he was staying sober
was to see how fucked up he got on.

1307
01:16:09,230 --> 01:16:13,460
You know, like furniture, Polish,
basically his stuff for Polish,

1308
01:16:13,780 --> 01:16:17,070
it's like alcohol. Absence is like,
have you ever had it? Yeah. Yeah.

1309
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:21,730
I've had it a couple of times. It's weird.
It's a too strong, it's a weird feeling.

1310
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:25,750
It's a, it's like a cousin of drunk.
It's like drunks next door neighbor.

1311
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,960
It's like you don't hallucinate.
They're all partying in the same party,

1312
01:16:28,961 --> 01:16:31,420
but there's a fence between them.
No, there's no hallucination.

1313
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:32,820
It's just like being drunk.
Yeah.

1314
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:37,720
It's just a weird drunk tastes way
or it's like black licorice ish.

1315
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:42,370
Yeah. I'm not so sure. I like
it. What'd you did? You took
a shot or like a real, oh,

1316
01:16:42,371 --> 01:16:46,690
I had several. Yeah. No kidding. Yeah,

1317
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:50,890
I had it a long time ago in Canada.
That was the first time I ever did it.

1318
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:54,070
I never see you drunk. Yeah.
I'm pretty smart about that.

1319
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:55,680
It's not a good thing to do though.

1320
01:16:55,780 --> 01:16:59,680
I really right with that beautiful car
you have. Well Dad, I don't do definitely,

1321
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:02,930
but getting drunk period in public.
Yeah,

1322
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:07,450
we should get drunk. Did you have
some night you want to get drunk?

1323
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:09,830
Is that what you're saying?
I want to smoke. I told you.

1324
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,100
Well let's do it. Well we should
do as book partners. Safe thing

1325
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:15,990
drunk on the podcast and you
should smoke pot as well.

1326
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:20,700
That'll be our next podcast. Sounds
good. Well we plan to it right now.

1327
01:17:20,701 --> 01:17:21,534
You've got two hours.

1328
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:28,420
We don't even have a one 30 and dom I
rarer is not a man that likes to do things

1329
01:17:29,971 --> 01:17:32,250
impulsively.
It likes to plan things.

1330
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:33,970
It looks to schedule.

1331
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,410
Talking about you last night about what
a fucking animal you are like you're

1332
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:41,470
just like so like he can't,
you shoot pool with Joe for an hour.

1333
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:46,300
It's got to be three hours. Everything
he does. I said I feel bad for his wife.

1334
01:17:48,040 --> 01:17:51,970
She's got to be tough. I'm
obsessive. It's probably not healthy.

1335
01:17:52,030 --> 01:17:55,540
You got a lot of energy man. It's,
I don't see where it hurts you.

1336
01:17:55,541 --> 01:17:58,590
You got a great career with
the fuck. Great Life. Well yeah

1337
01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:01,080
I think I'm being obsessive though.

1338
01:18:01,081 --> 01:18:03,240
Could definitely hurt if it
gets out of control. Yeah.

1339
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:07,110
It's just a matter of
channeling like obsessive,

1340
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:12,380
obsessive thinking or the tendency to
like follow things down to the ground and

1341
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:14,010
chase them down till they're dead.

1342
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,380
But you've changed Joe,
like I told you, you like,

1343
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:19,150
you know the thing about Michael
Jordan where they go, well he,

1344
01:18:19,151 --> 01:18:21,990
he didn't beat his mother
and Ping Pong and whatever.

1345
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:24,780
He has to beat everybody and
everything and I think, well, you know,

1346
01:18:24,781 --> 01:18:27,300
there comes a point where he's
going to have, so you know,

1347
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:30,750
and not that you were ever an
answer because you never wear it,

1348
01:18:30,751 --> 01:18:35,751
but you were so mad at yourself when we
used to shoot pool and stuff and you've

1349
01:18:35,971 --> 01:18:38,870
lightened up considerably. Well, I
realized somewhere along the line

1350
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,300
way that that is a,

1351
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:45,070
that's a very faulty way of thinking
and that that's all it is. Yeah.

1352
01:18:45,100 --> 01:18:48,130
It's like being upset because
you did something wrong.

1353
01:18:48,460 --> 01:18:50,320
Doesn't make the doing
something wrong better.

1354
01:18:50,410 --> 01:18:55,410
And just like outwardly expressing it
in fact is indulgent and they're really

1355
01:18:56,291 --> 01:19:00,970
intelligent thing to do is to accept the
fact that there's this shift in the way

1356
01:19:00,971 --> 01:19:04,510
you feel because you're upset that
something went wrong or whatever.

1357
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:09,150
But you got to internalize that. And
that's part of being a man and being a,

1358
01:19:09,151 --> 01:19:13,690
a spoiled little boy or a,
a brash young cocky boy.

1359
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:17,680
You people like fucking get mad and
throw things around when when they,

1360
01:19:17,740 --> 01:19:20,230
when they're upset, you know,
if they miss a shot, I mean,

1361
01:19:20,231 --> 01:19:23,740
I've seen guys in pool tournaments miss
a shot, snap their stick on the ground.

1362
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,960
Well, yeah, I played with
this guy, Harland Jamieson,

1363
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:29,290
the olds bananas and I don't know
if you've ever worked at club and in

1364
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,350
Poughkeepsie. Yeah. Poughkeepsie.
And then that one, and he came back,

1365
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:35,680
we'll be shooting pool and he was a
pretty good player and he would bang the

1366
01:19:35,681 --> 01:19:39,550
fucking stick when the claim I was, and
I go, Harland, if you keep doing this,

1367
01:19:39,551 --> 01:19:43,090
I'm out of here. This is like fucking
right. And he did nothing against me.

1368
01:19:43,091 --> 01:19:46,510
But it's just such ridiculous behavior.
It's not a man's behavior.

1369
01:19:46,511 --> 01:19:48,610
It's the child's behavior.
I mean, he never did that.

1370
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:52,630
You would just get mad at yourself.
Yeah, well I would just, I would be,

1371
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:55,720
I would know it was always a
lack of concentration. I mean,

1372
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,930
she just shots that you miss where you
know, you just didn't hit it right.

1373
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:03,190
But there's also shots you miss where,
you know, it was a fairly makeable shot,

1374
01:20:03,191 --> 01:20:06,700
but you took it for granted and
you're like fucking idiot. You know,

1375
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:07,890
those are angry ones.

1376
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:13,010
It wasn't Mrs. It was more of lapses of
concentration that I was really upset at

1377
01:20:13,081 --> 01:20:17,370
myself for. But yeah, the shit doesn't
do you any good. No. Now laceless energy.

1378
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:21,750
Yeah. Now I just internalized or a
try very hard to just internalize,

1379
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,610
but that's um, that's just a factor
of getting older and smarter. Yeah.

1380
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,450
You hope doesn't happen everybody.
Huh? I know that's the saddest thing.

1381
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:33,810
When you find dudes that you didn't talk
to in a long time and they've regressed,

1382
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:38,400
they become more delusional
or more complaining. You know,

1383
01:20:38,401 --> 01:20:41,380
a lot of guys are complaining, talk to
me. I'm talking to him in a long time.

1384
01:20:41,381 --> 01:20:44,070
We talked to him in this,
this overwhelming coming.

1385
01:20:44,260 --> 01:20:47,480
Oh yeah, no, I hear that all the time.
I've got a friend who does cruise ships,

1386
01:20:47,481 --> 01:20:50,570
you know, and he doesn't like it. He's
got a family and he does other stuff too,

1387
01:20:50,571 --> 01:20:53,810
but he's always fucking wine.
He says, listen man, you're
making me. I said, look,

1388
01:20:53,811 --> 01:20:56,720
you see this thing? She just
car. You see this, you will boy.

1389
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,340
It was all bought through jokes.

1390
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:01,280
You know how fucking hard
some people work for nothing.

1391
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:04,880
They can't get shit jobs and I'm supposed
to feel bad for you because you're

1392
01:21:04,881 --> 01:21:09,530
going to Turkey. You know that's a hard
gig though. Oh, I wouldn't want to do it.

1393
01:21:09,560 --> 01:21:11,840
The cruise ship said currently.
So you're right though.

1394
01:21:11,841 --> 01:21:13,760
It's definitely better than coal mining.
Oh yeah.

1395
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:16,430
A lot of people would be super happy
to do it. I love when people go. What?

1396
01:21:16,431 --> 01:21:18,500
You did the hardest thing
in the world? No, I don't.

1397
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:22,070
But at the guy who discovered these,
what were just talking about,

1398
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:27,260
what were the mirror things?
They, fractals. Fractals.
Yeah, I'm fucked us that.

1399
01:21:27,261 --> 01:21:31,880
What kind of mine. Yeah. Super Smart
Science students and no one wants to fuck.

1400
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:36,440
That's what's up. Yeah, exactly.
When they get more time on her hands,

1401
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:37,740
once they start getting pussy throb,

1402
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:42,200
they're fucking signs deteriorates
drastically. You know,

1403
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:46,040
this is all like you have
to have no chance that pussy
to be sitting in front of

1404
01:21:46,041 --> 01:21:49,600
a computer banging this out cause there's
just some girls out there that would

1405
01:21:49,601 --> 01:21:51,980
just rob you of all ambition.

1406
01:21:52,090 --> 01:21:56,020
Whenever I think of uh, no chance of
the, I always think of that bit. You had,

1407
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:59,680
you know, the one that, the new
rules, but I always think of the guys.

1408
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:04,090
What was the guy's name? Who she married?
He was in his nine j Howard Marshall.

1409
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:08,020
Marshall. No chance of pussy
unless you're a trillionaire.

1410
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:14,220
Uh, 1904. Actually it was
when fractals were invented.

1411
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:19,380
I was way off. That's
fascinating. That's the,

1412
01:22:19,381 --> 01:22:23,820
the earliest modifications.
Yeah.

1413
01:22:23,821 --> 01:22:26,740
Who the fuck are those guys though?

1414
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:30,270
I mean you think about like the
things that we use on a daily basis,

1415
01:22:30,271 --> 01:22:33,510
like computers, all the things we need.
I have no idea how any of that works.

1416
01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:36,900
Not only do we not understand
how it works, but even if we did,

1417
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,780
even if we knew exactly how
the operating system works,

1418
01:22:39,781 --> 01:22:42,150
exactly how the memory is stored,

1419
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:45,700
which you could never make that thing,
you can never build anything,

1420
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:48,420
never invented on your own. I can't
make anything. Yeah. But I mean,

1421
01:22:48,421 --> 01:22:50,070
I'm not even you. I mean, any of us,

1422
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:54,720
it's fascinating how much of our society
relies on things that almost no one

1423
01:22:54,721 --> 01:22:56,910
understands.
I don't fucking understand plumbing.

1424
01:22:57,120 --> 01:23:00,410
I don't understand how you can get the
same water pressure on the 10th floor as

1425
01:23:00,420 --> 01:23:05,360
you have on a second floor. It's crazy.
It's madness. That's must be a river on a,

1426
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:09,660
down the roof. Yeah.
Water pressure. Weird.

1427
01:23:10,420 --> 01:23:15,250
Uh, you ever have, um, uh, like
a, a route get into your pipes?

1428
01:23:16,090 --> 01:23:19,180
No. Never had that happen. I had a route,

1429
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,810
got into my pipes and grew a
fucking tree. All this shit. I mean,

1430
01:23:22,811 --> 01:23:27,310
when I tell you grew up here right now.
Yes. Oh Man. Yes. When I went to Colorado,

1431
01:23:27,311 --> 01:23:31,120
when I was gone for awhile. The
uh, when you flush the water,

1432
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:32,380
the uh,

1433
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:37,620
apparently like there was these little
tiny cracks in the pipe from the toilet,

1434
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:41,950
uh, down to the street. That's
it. See that thing right there,

1435
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:46,990
that was a inside my toilet growing.
It looks like a Muskrat, right? Yes.

1436
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:51,220
That is, that is a fucking route. Oh
my God. That's the root of a tree.

1437
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:54,160
So it got through and then because
it was all that water in there,

1438
01:23:54,161 --> 01:23:56,440
it started growing like crazy and,

1439
01:23:56,441 --> 01:23:59,140
and was searching it cause
that's what routes do they,

1440
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,260
they grow down towards where
the water isn't, suck it out.

1441
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,150
That's how they get
moisture out of the ground.

1442
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:09,250
So it cracked my pipe open and
grew inside of it. That's real.

1443
01:24:09,620 --> 01:24:12,490
That's not made up that image. I mean
if you, if you're listening to this,

1444
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:15,880
it looks almost like an animal. Well
how do you find that? What's the,

1445
01:24:15,940 --> 01:24:18,880
is it on a flicker Joe Rogan route pipe?

1446
01:24:19,870 --> 01:24:23,200
Just like I didn't get blend tech right
there. Just Google Joe Rogan route pipe.

1447
01:24:23,290 --> 01:24:23,561
Yeah.

1448
01:24:23,561 --> 01:24:28,561
I wouldn't do that because it's filled
with poop that was fed by poop and peep

1449
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:34,240
and water and that thing grew like a like,
hey, we'd like a veritable read dumb.

1450
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:38,110
Yeah. I don't understand it either.
I've got a new thing recently, um,

1451
01:24:38,170 --> 01:24:43,060
that it's instant hot water. You know
the talk there. Tankless water systems.

1452
01:24:43,390 --> 01:24:48,100
So your water goes through this thing
and it instantly turns hot. It doesn't,

1453
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:51,130
you don't have a tank of water
just sitting around getting hot.

1454
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:56,120
That would be good for my sitz baths.
What's amazing is it like safe?

1455
01:24:56,680 --> 01:25:00,450
You never run out of hot water. That's one
thing that's cool. Like you know. Yeah,

1456
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:04,610
just got it. So like if someone's using
the water and like if you're young,

1457
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:06,280
you have a friend that
takes a long shower,

1458
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:09,160
well you go in after that
person and you're fucked.

1459
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:11,830
You know you're going to have to take a
mediocre ass shower cause there's no hot

1460
01:25:11,831 --> 01:25:13,420
water left with these things.

1461
01:25:13,421 --> 01:25:16,360
Now they have it so the water can
go through it and it's always hot.

1462
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:19,990
People will be coming over to your house
to take beds. That's, that's my plan.

1463
01:25:19,991 --> 01:25:21,970
And my friend that's a,
you get them naked.

1464
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,810
So it's in one place in the house or
is it like on every single like faucet

1465
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:28,440
there's like, oh no, no, no.
It's in one place. It's one,

1466
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:32,380
one area where the water comes in and
then it regulates it out from that. Oh,

1467
01:25:32,381 --> 01:25:34,720
it's ridiculous.
It's one of the weirdest things ever.

1468
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:38,260
It's just like how the weight, what
happens? Huh? So the water ends.

1469
01:25:38,261 --> 01:25:42,820
I mean it's hot as fuck too. It's not
like it's kind of hot. It's Kinda hot. No,

1470
01:25:42,870 --> 01:25:46,810
it's, it's boiling hot all the time
right out of the gate. So it's weird.

1471
01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:49,390
I don't know how the fuck did they get
their plumbers put that in or is that

1472
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:52,510
like a specialty regular plumbers? Yeah,
it's, it's something they put in now.

1473
01:25:52,511 --> 01:25:55,090
It's normal thing. And
you know, a lot of people,

1474
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:59,410
especially where we live are going full
solar because you can go full solar

1475
01:25:59,411 --> 01:26:03,090
where you don't even have to be attached
to the grid. There's enough sunshine,

1476
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,680
southern California. We could just
have these pretty cool, it's crazy.

1477
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:11,030
I had a guy come over last week, my
garbage disposal is down. And uh,

1478
01:26:11,060 --> 01:26:15,050
he recognized me, right.
And, uh, now we recognize me.

1479
01:26:15,051 --> 01:26:16,980
He also gave me coupons.
I'm thinking,

1480
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:20,350
I guess he recognized me but doesn't think
I'm doing too well. And then he said,

1481
01:26:20,380 --> 01:26:21,820
I got to tell you it's
a pleasure to meet him.

1482
01:26:21,821 --> 01:26:26,780
Mr O'hare o Herro Hara Hara
and my name is written on it.

1483
01:26:26,781 --> 01:26:30,800
I rarer, he just didn't look to, while
he's just not good at pronouncing things.

1484
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:35,360
Amy, I rera Save Shit. He
could be a little black Irish.

1485
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:38,630
I had a woman call me mister Irene.
Talk about lazy.

1486
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:43,790
I'll be up there in the second. Mr
Irene Room Service. She made a mistake.

1487
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:47,620
Don't get upset. Don't get upset. I like
it. And you just turned it into bits.

1488
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:52,170
Joe turned into comedy
gems and do you ever, oh,

1489
01:26:52,260 --> 01:26:56,840
come on. What about you? Don't
start with me and do you ever, um,

1490
01:26:56,900 --> 01:27:00,110
and I saw you at the ice house. Yeah.
Fucking Billy crystal. That's right.

1491
01:27:00,170 --> 01:27:04,820
We just said it. Fuck Chris. Talk
about throwing that in your memory,

1492
01:27:04,821 --> 01:27:07,940
but it can splurting it out an hour later.
Bobcat,

1493
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,700
Bob Marley's the nicest guy in the world.
Oh Man.

1494
01:27:10,730 --> 01:27:13,160
Crystal giving him the cold shoulder.
How dare you Billy.

1495
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:17,840
I know it'd be only knew
mustad sounds a little smug.

1496
01:27:17,870 --> 01:27:22,070
I gotta say that's unfortunate. Yeah.
And he's had a beautiful career, man.

1497
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:26,660
He's fucking smug. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, you know it's fucking,

1498
01:27:26,690 --> 01:27:29,120
it's a lot of pressure.
A lot of pressure on those guys.

1499
01:27:29,150 --> 01:27:31,160
A lot of times they crack fuck them.

1500
01:27:31,460 --> 01:27:34,570
They start buying it in their own
polo shirt. Yeah. I think that's a,

1501
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:38,450
the guys who don't are the guys who keep
doing standup because no matter what,

1502
01:27:38,451 --> 01:27:40,250
no matter how fun you are
of how famous you are,

1503
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:42,530
or rather when you get on that stage,
you have to be fine.

1504
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:45,620
They give you a couple of minutes.
But you gotta be funny, Joe.

1505
01:27:45,621 --> 01:27:50,390
I haven't been on stage since the Friday
before last the longest in probably 20

1506
01:27:50,391 --> 01:27:53,840
years because of being sick.
Yeah. Wow. But isn't that true?

1507
01:27:53,841 --> 01:27:56,030
Like that's how we do it.
Like a lot of people folks don't know,

1508
01:27:56,031 --> 01:27:59,180
like they've never ate five nights a
week off or two months out or something

1509
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:01,160
like that. It feels really
weird. But you come back,

1510
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:05,270
it can't be a wiseguy crack wise cracking
Italian community and what a hacking

1511
01:28:05,271 --> 01:28:08,300
cough. It doesn't work, you know? And
that's, that's why I couldn't go on.

1512
01:28:08,330 --> 01:28:09,200
I mean that could have made it,

1513
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,140
I've been on the stage with
fevers and torn muscles and shit,

1514
01:28:12,141 --> 01:28:16,460
but the cough would be fucking did me in,
I only had to cancel one gig ever.

1515
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:21,200
Wow. Um, as far as like a
weekend, it was a, I think maybe,

1516
01:28:21,201 --> 01:28:22,400
maybe when I was younger I did,

1517
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:26,000
but that I could remember like as a like
a Gig that was supposed to fly out to,

1518
01:28:26,001 --> 01:28:27,860
I took, I think I was supposed
to do it. Stress Factory.

1519
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:32,910
I'm pretty sure that was what it was.
Like any brand. I got the fever flu. Ooh.

1520
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:33,800
It was bad.
It was,

1521
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:37,310
it was one of those ones where it was
like on Monday I cancelled. I was like,

1522
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:41,840
there is no way. At least he
gave them that. Yeah. It was bad.

1523
01:28:42,370 --> 01:28:46,370
They'll fucking few flu that's going
around right now as a mother. Fuck Dude.

1524
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:50,600
I've talked to some people that got it
that like we're fine and then two days

1525
01:28:50,601 --> 01:28:54,260
later they're in the hospital
on Ivy. Really? Yeah. Holy Shit.

1526
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,060
They're showing in Houston
that people were like,

1527
01:28:56,061 --> 01:28:59,180
I think they were up to like 50
people have died from the flu.

1528
01:28:59,181 --> 01:29:03,300
I'm sure it's old people and babies, but
uh, well you know, if you fuck up man,

1529
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:08,260
that's the thing about
like being sick or um, not,

1530
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:10,980
not, not having a healthy
body, a healthy immune system.

1531
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,000
Like when you're not healthy all the time,
like he's pulling all nighters,

1532
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:16,650
getting a couple of hours
sleep before you get to work.

1533
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:20,130
You're working all day and drinking
coffee and your immune system is fucking

1534
01:29:20,131 --> 01:29:24,360
getting chipped away.
If that is when it enters into your life,

1535
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,970
like you can die,
you can die if you,

1536
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:30,720
if you're hung over and drawn
out and fucked up and then boom,

1537
01:29:30,721 --> 01:29:34,290
you get hit with the flu.
Holy Shit. You can get jacked.

1538
01:29:34,710 --> 01:29:37,120
I had so many people like
bummed me out first day,

1539
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:40,760
like act like they care and they
know. Oh yeah. You know? As I said,

1540
01:29:40,830 --> 01:29:43,080
I think I'm getting better. Yeah. He
goes, yeah. A friend of mine had done,

1541
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:46,860
you know lists like three months
or so. Thanks. You know, it's good.

1542
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:49,230
Thanks for cheering me up.
Just telling me his friends opposed to,

1543
01:29:50,230 --> 01:29:52,490
that's what I would say. Fuck him
friends. Your friends are posting.

1544
01:29:52,491 --> 01:29:56,190
I'm we be back in two days
a smack them three months.

1545
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:00,030
The fuck out of here.
I'm going to call it last three months.

1546
01:30:00,340 --> 01:30:05,040
It's not a goal anymore.
Yeah, it's an epic Tequila.
Asthma does what you have now.

1547
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,860
Do you have asthma? I got
something. This thing is this,

1548
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:10,650
this goes so I got to inhale it.
You know what's good for asthma?

1549
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:14,030
Pussy stank up was a that too,

1550
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:19,080
but a wade and my friend made it once
and I wish I could smoke right now,

1551
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:22,770
but I just don't know what would happen.
I've got to drive that panic. Yeah. Yeah.

1552
01:30:22,771 --> 01:30:25,800
He'd go into a tailspin. We'd have
to be like slid out of the corner.

1553
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:28,140
Are you allowed to do
that with Xanax though?

1554
01:30:28,141 --> 01:30:30,840
How does that work if you taken Xanax?
I don't know cause I never,

1555
01:30:30,841 --> 01:30:35,160
I mean Xanax is a tranquilizer.
Oh you might stop breathing.

1556
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:39,990
Xanax feels like Xanex feels like what
you would think normal people feel like.

1557
01:30:40,710 --> 01:30:43,770
No, it's not a high, it's just, I mean
I never take it enough to get high,

1558
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,450
but it's just like a relaxing,
you know,

1559
01:30:45,740 --> 01:30:50,400
just do some indicates what's a cause
the downer that we'd like, you know,

1560
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:54,990
there's an Oh is it? I'm sorry.
There was a article that said that.

1561
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,050
That's bullshit. I thought that was
really interesting. I know it's always,

1562
01:30:58,051 --> 01:31:01,230
it's pretty established know
some article that said that. Uh,

1563
01:31:01,800 --> 01:31:04,050
I don't know whether they're saying that
the people that are selling are full of

1564
01:31:04,051 --> 01:31:06,380
shit, but they were saying that you, the,

1565
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:09,060
the two different highs are
indistinguishable. And I was like, man,

1566
01:31:09,061 --> 01:31:11,370
I don't know about all
that bullshit article.

1567
01:31:11,640 --> 01:31:15,180
Well it seems like you're not
getting high enough to really,

1568
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:19,500
you'd have to do it and get out.
It's like a,

1569
01:31:19,650 --> 01:31:24,650
Somalia can tell the difference
between Lowe's and cabernets.

1570
01:31:25,171 --> 01:31:28,200
Like right off the bat. Right.
They can just tell. I can't tell.

1571
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:29,460
I don't know what the
fuck the differences.

1572
01:31:29,550 --> 01:31:32,160
I had no idea there was
a pot that was a downer.

1573
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:37,290
Well that's what most people think of
as for pot. They think of, Oh Gee Kush.

1574
01:31:37,320 --> 01:31:41,070
They think of like we just chill dog.

1575
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:46,400
It really just makes you just really not
give a fuck just kicking back and just

1576
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:52,080
your eyelids get heavy and
then this pot for me at least,

1577
01:31:52,081 --> 01:31:56,520
that makes me like really think about
shit and really get introspective and

1578
01:31:56,910 --> 01:32:00,610
breakdown my life and life itself.
The city and universes

1579
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:04,930
and shit like that. That's that to
me, whatever it is, whether it's uh,

1580
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:09,210
the different cannabinoids
are the different strain or
whatever the fucking has.

1581
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:13,550
There's a different response. I have
two different kinds of weed. I thought.

1582
01:32:13,750 --> 01:32:16,360
I Dunno, I don't, I mean maybe
a, maybe I'm wrong about it.

1583
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,870
Maybe I'm wrong about the, uh, the
way the, the mechanism is working.

1584
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,900
I just know when I get good stuff.
Well what fuck me up was,

1585
01:32:22,901 --> 01:32:27,730
I had no idea that it took a
while to hit you. Xanax, no pot.

1586
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:31,120
So when I first smoked,
this is why I had such a bad experience.

1587
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:34,840
I just kept smoking joint
after joint, like, you know,

1588
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:38,220
in in a half an hour I smoked like,
I dunno, three or four joints.

1589
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,470
There's just like, oh my God, these
guys are going, Holy Shit. Look at him.

1590
01:32:41,471 --> 01:32:42,304
And I'm thinking,

1591
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:45,190
and I did this with southern comfort
once and I almost died from alcohol

1592
01:32:45,191 --> 01:32:48,090
poisoning because I just kissing.
I was like, I just liked, you know,

1593
01:32:48,091 --> 01:32:52,300
it's like getting the crowd behind
him. Where were you? The Pot? Yeah,

1594
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:54,250
I was at the University of Pennsylvania.
Uh,

1595
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:58,630
I got an apartment down there and Philly
and just with a bunch of guys fucking

1596
01:32:58,631 --> 01:33:02,320
around who's pot wasn't, I dunno,
it wasn't mine. And you know,

1597
01:33:02,340 --> 01:33:05,790
so somebody else brought the pot and
then you just started smoking up a storm.

1598
01:33:05,791 --> 01:33:07,110
But I had never smoked.
And the,

1599
01:33:07,111 --> 01:33:10,810
and then it just kept smoking and this
was like really like a lot of smoke,

1600
01:33:10,811 --> 01:33:13,780
you know? I don't know. Even like, and
that's why I think I got so fucked up.

1601
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:17,680
Of course it everything like the Breck I
was why this was when there were albums

1602
01:33:17,681 --> 01:33:18,161
now and everywhere.

1603
01:33:18,161 --> 01:33:22,270
I remember watching the record revolved
and just getting lost in that, you know,

1604
01:33:22,540 --> 01:33:26,350
what was the song that was
playing? It was um, tomorrow,

1605
01:33:26,351 --> 01:33:30,300
never knows it was a Beatles
song and turning off your mind,

1606
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:34,180
relax and float down the stream,
you know, that's all it is,

1607
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:36,690
not dying or whatever.
And um,

1608
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:41,140
and that was real psychedelic kind of
song. Anyway, I was like, ah, fuck.

1609
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:46,420
I thought maybe my head felt smaller,
you know, just everything was weird.

1610
01:33:47,240 --> 01:33:49,340
That's why I had a bad experience.
That's what I want to try it again.

1611
01:33:49,341 --> 01:33:52,780
And so did you get paranoid?
Yeah, very, very bright orange.

1612
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:55,870
And what bike do you remember
specifically what you thought about?

1613
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:01,120
Just that the whole world looked different
to me and see the only time I was

1614
01:34:01,121 --> 01:34:04,720
ever, I had gotten fucked up on
cough medicine in high school.

1615
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:08,170
Did you ever do that?
I did cough medicine when I was an adult.

1616
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,350
I took Nyquil once when I was sick and
it was one of the happiest days of my

1617
01:34:11,351 --> 01:34:12,780
life.
So this was like,

1618
01:34:12,790 --> 01:34:17,470
I drank a whole bottle of
Romel RCF I swear to God.

1619
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:20,860
I mean, I, that was, I
think that's why, uh,

1620
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:26,000
up any kind of upper drugs have had
negative effects on me because of that.

1621
01:34:26,111 --> 01:34:28,900
And then I did the pot and so
that's why I never did them.

1622
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:33,160
And everyone's against drug. Well,
that seems like a very likely scenario.

1623
01:34:33,190 --> 01:34:36,250
If you smoke that much pot the
first time he did it, that is,

1624
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:39,640
you're going to freak the fuck out.
That's, that's, well, nobody told me,

1625
01:34:40,120 --> 01:34:43,510
nobody told me they were going wow, look
at him. And I was like, Oh yeah, look,

1626
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:47,780
one hint. Yeah, that's all
you need. Just one. She,

1627
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:52,540
that's not even a big one. Not even
a big one, just to tiny one. Just to,

1628
01:34:52,541 --> 01:34:56,530
to really feel what pot does.
You want a tiny amount of it.

1629
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:58,730
That way you distinguish

1630
01:34:58,730 --> 01:35:03,260
it from regular consciousness. He fuck
around with it, get a feel for it.

1631
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:07,640
See the, the, the good and the bad about
it. And occasionally going to push it.

1632
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,990
Occasionally going to get too small.
You're Gunsmoke two hits and three hits.

1633
01:35:10,991 --> 01:35:12,740
They ain't going to feel weird
as fuck and you gotta go,

1634
01:35:12,741 --> 01:35:14,990
you know me better back this down.
So we back this down,

1635
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:19,430
take it down to one again, bring it
down to one and just try one for awhile.

1636
01:35:19,460 --> 01:35:23,760
But when people start smoking a
whole joint or two g your code,

1637
01:35:23,930 --> 01:35:26,750
that's like he had never
ridden a motorcycle before
and you get on one of those

1638
01:35:26,751 --> 01:35:30,380
Ninja, you know, just go ahead
and done it. You know what?

1639
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:34,700
You can't do it. But those guys
who do it every day can do it.

1640
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:39,020
It's a similar thing in a way because
it's the experience of being really,

1641
01:35:39,021 --> 01:35:42,490
really high is manageable. Say if
you're a guy like Everlast, you know,

1642
01:35:42,610 --> 01:35:45,620
if you get high all the time and
you're just naturally cool, dude,

1643
01:35:45,621 --> 01:35:49,520
that can deal with shit. But if you're
a guy who's never gotten high before,

1644
01:35:49,521 --> 01:35:54,200
like that can fucking be marble.
Terrifying.

1645
01:35:54,380 --> 01:35:57,680
It was terrifying. What were you
thinking about when you said the world?

1646
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:02,390
It just didn't look the same. Uh, just
the proportions of things look different,

1647
01:36:03,110 --> 01:36:05,490
you know,
like as if I was zipping,

1648
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,540
my eyes were different lenses that
they changed, you know, for a while.

1649
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:10,530
And you know,

1650
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,970
I was just getting a thought in my
head that like giving them the song.

1651
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:19,160
W We keep playing in my head when it was
over. You know why it was pretty heavy.

1652
01:36:19,161 --> 01:36:23,900
I mean, I guess it was close
to a trip, you know? Wow. Yeah,

1653
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:28,490
that sounds like what I go through
every night. Like a typical day.

1654
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:31,120
I went through the end of the
tank last night. He went to what?

1655
01:36:31,370 --> 01:36:34,850
I went through that in the tank. Could
you do the tank? Yeah. Yeah. I've Joe,

1656
01:36:34,851 --> 01:36:37,020
you're unbelievable.
You're so funny.

1657
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:42,080
You got so many fucking varied interest
in all. I watch sports center lists. No,

1658
01:36:42,140 --> 01:36:44,450
that's what I did. But that's,
we're all different. Dot.

1659
01:36:44,451 --> 01:36:48,740
Merera I'm just trying to maintain and
not go off the rails into crazy town.

1660
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:54,090
So what do I do? I hunt bores
and aligned saltwater. Typical.

1661
01:36:54,150 --> 01:36:56,720
I'd throw kettle bells around
just trying to keep it together.

1662
01:36:56,780 --> 01:36:59,660
You got to fight this week?
No, this week is no UFC.

1663
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:01,940
This week I said I'm going for hunting.

1664
01:37:02,390 --> 01:37:05,640
The next UFC is not until the week
after that and Chicago, I'll tell you.

1665
01:37:06,050 --> 01:37:08,180
Thanks again for the Montreal tree.

1666
01:37:08,570 --> 01:37:12,880
Did you enjoy it more than enjoy the
Tammy pass could tell you another would

1667
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:15,650
have fucking,
I mean that guy like the excitement.

1668
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:19,550
I could just imagine like it's like
the gladiators, the Roman Empire.

1669
01:37:19,551 --> 01:37:23,240
Like the excitement in that room when
the French Canadian guy walked in.

1670
01:37:23,390 --> 01:37:26,660
George Saint Pierre. Yeah. Oh my God.
And then the fight itself and it was,

1671
01:37:26,661 --> 01:37:31,010
it was great. Yeah. Those live events or
there's something special like seeing,

1672
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:35,720
seeing the UFC live is this
very few things that have
as much electricity in the

1673
01:37:35,721 --> 01:37:39,560
air. So much potential drama and
while the fights are going on,

1674
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:42,750
there's so exciting. It's so
exciting. And I, you know, you,

1675
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:46,700
you invited me to a couple of them and
I was so amazed at how clear I see the

1676
01:37:46,701 --> 01:37:51,060
crowd is. It ain't like professional
wrestling crowd skate on his face.

1677
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:57,180
I mean, they're like really nice
people. They look, but they're not well,

1678
01:37:57,360 --> 01:38:02,360
I always hoped that it would go closer
and closer towards the ethics of martial

1679
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:08,250
arts because I think that if you
looked at the best guys ever,

1680
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:12,900
the best UFC fighters are martial artists
from hoists. Gracie, the original,

1681
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:13,500
you know,

1682
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:18,500
to look at like Leo Machida or Anderson
Silva or George Saint Pierre Silver

1683
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:21,810
broke his leg. Anderson brogues
lag. Yeah. The last fight.

1684
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:26,100
These guys are martial artists like
the Anderson bows for every match.

1685
01:38:26,101 --> 01:38:28,590
Liotta Machida bows,
George bows like they are,

1686
01:38:28,591 --> 01:38:33,510
they're literally upholding the
original codes of martial arts conduct.

1687
01:38:33,511 --> 01:38:37,050
I mean, they are martial artists
and those are the best guides.

1688
01:38:37,051 --> 01:38:41,460
It's not these brawler fuck you spit
in your face kicking the balls, guys.

1689
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,280
Those guys are not the,
the, the champions.

1690
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:48,830
The champions adhere to this sort
of philosophy and principle of,

1691
01:38:48,850 --> 01:38:52,290
of excellence that I think,
yeah, it kind of have to have,

1692
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:54,570
and the people that are attracted to that,

1693
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,740
there's going to be a bunch of
knuckleheads in the audience. I mean,

1694
01:38:56,750 --> 01:38:59,400
it's unavoidable.
You get 18,000 people,

1695
01:38:59,690 --> 01:39:02,130
you're going to get a few
dozen crazy people for sure.

1696
01:39:02,131 --> 01:39:05,070
There's no way around in
any game baseball, you know?

1697
01:39:05,160 --> 01:39:10,160
But overall I think that what the fighters
project that they project a level of

1698
01:39:10,261 --> 01:39:14,630
respect and a level of
discipline and dignity that a,

1699
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:18,120
the audience, they, I think they take
that in. I think they appreciate it.

1700
01:39:18,180 --> 01:39:22,470
Whereas when you're watching the WWE,
you'd know that it's scripted.

1701
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:27,540
It's a wild, crazy event and it's fun and
it's entertaining and it's acrobatics.

1702
01:39:27,541 --> 01:39:30,970
And you know, those guys like they
were in the rock is a serious athlete.

1703
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:33,300
Brock Lesner,
he's a serious athlete.

1704
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:36,120
Brock Lesnar was pretty successful in
the UFC for a guy that didn't have any of

1705
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:38,940
MMA fights to speak of
other than one before.

1706
01:39:38,941 --> 01:39:42,240
He entered into the biggest stage
on earth as a fighter. I mean,

1707
01:39:42,241 --> 01:39:44,310
he's a ballsy motherfucker,
you know?

1708
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:46,860
So no disrespect to the
wrestlers or anything like that,

1709
01:39:46,861 --> 01:39:49,150
but one of the reasons why the
audience will act like that,

1710
01:39:49,151 --> 01:39:51,620
it's because they could feel it.
It's not real. It's all horse shit.

1711
01:39:51,670 --> 01:39:55,140
They're just there. They're like trying
to suck excitement out of, out of the air.

1712
01:39:55,160 --> 01:39:58,260
But don't you think there's certain people
that believe it's real no matter what

1713
01:39:58,261 --> 01:39:59,550
you tell them?
100%.

1714
01:39:59,910 --> 01:40:04,910
I talked to a guy from a Abu Dhabi who
was telling me that his friend absolutely

1715
01:40:05,851 --> 01:40:08,450
believes that it's real and he
cannot argue with him about this.

1716
01:40:08,460 --> 01:40:11,430
Not so frustrated.
He didn't know what to say.

1717
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,170
My doctor thinks all professional
football is rigged. Really? I go,

1718
01:40:16,171 --> 01:40:19,920
how the fuck can they get to all these
guys? This is, I'm listening. He goes,

1719
01:40:20,070 --> 01:40:23,250
you're going to tell me that, you know,
Brady couldn't throw a pass. And I go,

1720
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:26,440
I don't know. But how do they get to
the center? How did they get, you know,

1721
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,040
it's the company becomes a
point where it's just paranoia.

1722
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,680
Some people don't like the wool
pulled out over them, you know,

1723
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:35,520
pulled over their eyes. So they, uh, they
like to look for it and everything. Uh,

1724
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:39,570
these motherfuckers are all in together.
Yeah. Right after you fcs all the time.

1725
01:40:39,571 --> 01:40:42,840
I'll get tweets like, yeah, you
know, it's a fuckin fixed fight.

1726
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:47,130
That was a bullshit. Fuck that flex fixed
and you know it. Oh, fights can be fixed.

1727
01:40:47,131 --> 01:40:48,380
I mean,
they certainly can.

1728
01:40:48,420 --> 01:40:52,410
Fights can be fixed basketball games
with ribs or a guy who missed his foul

1729
01:40:52,411 --> 01:40:53,680
shots at the, you know, but

1730
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:58,290
when you get to a whole fucking football
team, it's 22 guys plus Reps. I mean,

1731
01:40:58,330 --> 01:41:02,560
come on. Well, the thing
about basketball is you, uh,

1732
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:07,210
I mean they have absolutely proven that
referees have been involved. Oh yeah.

1733
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:10,680
They've, they've, they've proven
that they've shaved points. Yeah.

1734
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:11,860
They've proven that people have done,

1735
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:15,700
there's a guy who just got out of jail
for that. Yeah. The referee. Right? Yeah.

1736
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:19,210
And I had a friend who, um, who
was a rough day, but they did this.

1737
01:41:19,211 --> 01:41:20,290
I thought it was so classless.

1738
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:23,110
They would get first class
tickets and sell them back,

1739
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:27,340
getting checks cashed them in and get
coached tickets and pocket the money.

1740
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:32,890
That's, that's kind of fucking low
life sleazy. Yeah. That's, you know,

1741
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:36,640
it's not living your life either. What
do you get sit in first class? Fuck it.

1742
01:41:36,710 --> 01:41:38,830
I know you didn't have the ticket before,

1743
01:41:39,310 --> 01:41:41,710
but I think you should be allowed to
do it. I don't see a problem with it.

1744
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:46,500
I feel like, uh, if you're the one who,
uh, wants to sit in coach and you want to,

1745
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:49,240
we'd rather have the money.
I feel like you should be able to do that.

1746
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:53,860
I just think it's a lack of class, so it's
a little sleazy, but no, you know what,

1747
01:41:53,861 --> 01:41:56,230
I take that back.
I don't even think it's a little sleazy.

1748
01:41:56,231 --> 01:42:00,930
It's like some people like to take it on
board with you. Joe Rogan. I rare they,

1749
01:42:01,300 --> 01:42:02,740
some people don't mind coach.

1750
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:06,190
What if he's a little tiny guy and it'll
gets a window seat and he just kind of

1751
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:10,650
curl up? I mind coach. You do. You do.
Oh, I don't see, so that's for you.

1752
01:42:10,651 --> 01:42:13,960
It drives you crazy. If he can't go
back there anymore, I can't do it.

1753
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:17,260
It's the only thing about it. I just
don't give a fuck. I always fly for,

1754
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:21,740
I paid more for my ticket to
Australia then I made, I did.

1755
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:26,200
I did. I worked two weeks. I made
less money. Just didn't give a fuck.

1756
01:42:26,201 --> 01:42:30,040
I wonder to fly First Class Dad.
So Alaria s that's hilarious.

1757
01:42:30,041 --> 01:42:33,850
That is a total dom. I
rare or move, oh my age,

1758
01:42:33,851 --> 01:42:38,290
it gets such a kick out of it.
Oh, that's so funny. Well that's,

1759
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:41,830
but again, I hate to say this, but that
it really is why you're so funny still.

1760
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:45,550
It's like there's a, you know, we were
just talking about it the other day,

1761
01:42:45,551 --> 01:42:46,384
me and Tripoli,

1762
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:51,600
we're talking about how a lot of comics
that we liked back when we started,

1763
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:56,530
you know, they kind of sort of drift away
from it. You know, like even the greats.

1764
01:42:56,560 --> 01:43:00,490
Like look at Steve Martin. He doesn't
do stand up. Stopped a long time ago.

1765
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:04,360
You know, Robin Williams, like we'll
occasionally do stand up, you know,

1766
01:43:04,361 --> 01:43:07,920
but you think about the people
that you really admired back then.

1767
01:43:07,930 --> 01:43:10,450
It's not that many of them that
I like really active still,

1768
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:14,740
but the ones that are like,
a lot of times they change radically.

1769
01:43:15,160 --> 01:43:16,920
Like their acts change.
They,

1770
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:20,920
they kind of drift away from
whatever it was that made them good.

1771
01:43:21,280 --> 01:43:24,900
They just sort of get this weird sense
of complacency or something like that.

1772
01:43:24,901 --> 01:43:28,150
I don't know what happened. And also you,
they, they run out of juice. You know?

1773
01:43:28,151 --> 01:43:31,300
And when I'm not, to me, I consider
myself the oldest young comedian.

1774
01:43:32,410 --> 01:43:35,020
I don't even mean I really don't
feel old. I feel young. I feel,

1775
01:43:35,021 --> 01:43:38,170
and I'm lucky that I hang out with
guys a lot younger than me. I,

1776
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:42,820
I absorbed that and energy, you know what
I mean? You know, you included. I mean,

1777
01:43:42,821 --> 01:43:43,900
it's just the, uh, I,

1778
01:43:44,020 --> 01:43:47,760
I love being around that and cause I
find that not to put my generation down,

1779
01:43:47,761 --> 01:43:52,150
but a lot of them are fucking bitter and
bitterness goes nowhere. Yeah, exactly. So

1780
01:43:52,310 --> 01:43:53,090
it's just like,

1781
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:56,690
like the unnecessary anger yelling out
and smacking your stick on the ground.

1782
01:43:56,930 --> 01:44:00,020
Yes, exactly. Realize it for
what is it that makes you bitter?

1783
01:44:00,180 --> 01:44:03,380
You're unhappy with your success will
do something about it, you know? I mean,

1784
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:08,450
barring your physical health and
unforeseen circumstances that can't be

1785
01:44:08,451 --> 01:44:11,690
controlled, most people have a little
leeway room to, for improvement.

1786
01:44:12,080 --> 01:44:15,440
And the bitterness is not fucking
helping yet. Just this fucking guy.

1787
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:18,410
You told me this guy deserves
a sitcom. I tell you, this guy,

1788
01:44:18,411 --> 01:44:22,130
I middled for him in Cincinnati.
Do not follow me.

1789
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:27,250
Pat Cooper. Yeah. Yeah. He,
and he was thinking, you know,
I liked the guy, but he's,

1790
01:44:27,251 --> 01:44:29,690
you know, he's really angry.
He's telling me he's trying to,

1791
01:44:29,691 --> 01:44:32,140
he's thinking I'm too stupid to
realize what he's doing. He's gone.

1792
01:44:32,260 --> 01:44:34,990
He's fucking kids today.
These cocksuckers they got five minutes.

1793
01:44:34,991 --> 01:44:39,000
They got a sitcom. I've been around 40
years. But you're a good kid. I mean,

1794
01:44:39,010 --> 01:44:39,843
he throw it like that.

1795
01:44:39,910 --> 01:44:43,620
That's supposed to keep Pique my interest
and I don't have a fucking Citco like,

1796
01:44:43,630 --> 01:44:47,320
oh, well maybe I should tell you
something. Maybe you're not right.

1797
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:51,700
That guy was an interesting guy.
Is he still around? Yeah, I mean,

1798
01:44:51,701 --> 01:44:54,760
I can't hear anymore, so it's
kinda tough. Oh, that sucks.

1799
01:44:55,180 --> 01:44:57,760
He used to go on stern and rant and rave,

1800
01:44:58,180 --> 01:45:01,450
go fucking crazy and yell at people
and it's just like, oh my God. Like,

1801
01:45:01,451 --> 01:45:05,980
listen to them get wound up. But this,
there's an element of sadness in it,

1802
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:10,570
you know? Yeah. It's an
element of a burns. A lot of
bridges. Some of those guys,

1803
01:45:11,110 --> 01:45:13,480
he got mad at the Sopranos,
you know, getting any of you.

1804
01:45:13,481 --> 01:45:15,610
But what did he get mad as a promise for?
I don't know.

1805
01:45:15,611 --> 01:45:18,520
They didn't give him big enough parts or
some shit and they didn't get, you know,

1806
01:45:18,521 --> 01:45:20,380
whatever it was. It's
like, you know what I mean?

1807
01:45:20,381 --> 01:45:24,670
I love that rite of passage for Italians
that we were all supposed to be in the

1808
01:45:24,671 --> 01:45:28,390
sopranos. What the fuck? They only
got, they got a cast of 20 people.

1809
01:45:28,870 --> 01:45:30,970
There's a lot more
Italians, you know? Well,

1810
01:45:30,971 --> 01:45:34,690
I think there's a lot of people in that
show that also had not really done a lot

1811
01:45:34,691 --> 01:45:36,730
of acting before.
Like Stevie van Zandt,

1812
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:40,900
Little Steve and Bruce
Springsteen and our friend.

1813
01:45:41,320 --> 01:45:44,200
I mean our buddy. But it was
Joe. It was, they were, they,

1814
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:48,250
they had a core of real actors and they
had types and some of the types like

1815
01:45:48,251 --> 01:45:51,520
Steve developed into real good
actors, you know? But I mean,

1816
01:45:51,910 --> 01:45:53,200
that's what the show was.

1817
01:45:53,201 --> 01:45:58,201
It was the core of 80 Falco and you
came to Defini and Michael Imperioli

1818
01:45:58,290 --> 01:46:01,720
periodically, those guys. And then
they, I, that's the way they cast it.

1819
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:04,320
Yeah.
But I think what the appeal was,

1820
01:46:04,321 --> 01:46:07,740
one of the appeals was that these people
that were in these peripheral roles

1821
01:46:07,741 --> 01:46:10,550
that really shined and
benefited from it greatly. Our,

1822
01:46:10,590 --> 01:46:14,310
like our friend Steve Sherpa,
Steve was not like an experience actor.

1823
01:46:14,311 --> 01:46:17,970
He was booking the Riviera when
we met him. He's a great guy.

1824
01:46:17,971 --> 01:46:19,470
I fucking love that guy.

1825
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:24,120
But he went from doing that to
being a really successful actor,

1826
01:46:24,180 --> 01:46:28,260
boom like that, but a hard worker too. He
and capitalized on it and he, you know,

1827
01:46:28,261 --> 01:46:30,900
he's smart. Steve's
are very smart guy. So,

1828
01:46:31,230 --> 01:46:35,070
but my point is that other people saw
that and go, look, this fucking guy,

1829
01:46:35,071 --> 01:46:39,140
he was over.
He wasn't even jealous of me,

1830
01:46:39,390 --> 01:46:40,250
so it wasn't blown.

1831
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:44,370
We're told me I could do such a much
better detailed job with that role,

1832
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:47,140
that role.
I was cool.

1833
01:46:47,220 --> 01:46:51,120
It sounded like a little bit of
Quincy Italian and I was having twins.

1834
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:56,040
You lift your finger prints
that it sounded like dice.

1835
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:58,830
Oh,
I'm morphing.

1836
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:03,690
I'm a bunch of fucking characters
over the top. Oh, speaking of dice,

1837
01:47:03,720 --> 01:47:06,870
I saw blue jasmine. Did you
see blue jasmine, woody Allen.

1838
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:11,400
Woody Allen Fascinates me, man.
Oh yeah. He's fucking fascinating.

1839
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:15,940
He's the reason I got in the
though. Really? Yeah. When I
was a little kid. Um, he's,

1840
01:47:15,950 --> 01:47:18,450
he makes a new movie, like
basically every year, you know,

1841
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:21,780
and they're going to blue. He writes them
all himself and they're fucking good.

1842
01:47:22,080 --> 01:47:25,590
This blue jasmine was a good movie.
Um, he's one of the guys. I mean,

1843
01:47:25,650 --> 01:47:29,100
I think he's a creeper for sure. I
mean, that whole thing with, yeah.

1844
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:33,360
Daughter was just in, I don't,
I don't want to judge. I'm
trying to be a nice guy,

1845
01:47:33,361 --> 01:47:36,930
but I don't think he looked at her as
a daughter. I don't know what happened.

1846
01:47:36,930 --> 01:47:39,270
Whatever, whatever. I'd
have no idea. You know what?

1847
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:43,320
You got to got to admire him for,
she's not even hot, so you can't see,

1848
01:47:43,321 --> 01:47:45,660
I can't say he left his
wife for a hot young chick.

1849
01:47:45,930 --> 01:47:50,790
She's fucking holier than his way. Oh, I
guess. But she's young. It's different.

1850
01:47:51,540 --> 01:47:55,680
Um, anyway, you just try to help
them be, yeah. What was I saying?

1851
01:47:56,550 --> 01:48:00,360
So his movie, so I saw, this is how
I got to my woody Allen resurgence.

1852
01:48:00,361 --> 01:48:03,750
I saw at midnight in Paris. Did you
see that one? Yeah, it's fucking good.

1853
01:48:04,050 --> 01:48:05,820
It's a good movie. So
it's interesting. Yeah.

1854
01:48:05,910 --> 01:48:09,810
You know what you got to see though
some of the love and death checking out

1855
01:48:09,860 --> 01:48:13,920
because it, the fucking jokes are
hilarious. I think I have seen it.

1856
01:48:14,100 --> 01:48:18,240
I think that the French revolution,
the Russian French war,

1857
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:22,200
I don't remember what it was about. I
saw it a long time ago. I saw a sleeper.

1858
01:48:22,201 --> 01:48:24,390
I saw, um, uh, Annie Hall.

1859
01:48:24,750 --> 01:48:29,190
I seen a lot of his little or your
gas metronic in love and death.

1860
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:33,240
A Napoleon says to Diane Keaton, he
goes, how do you think of me as a man?

1861
01:48:33,241 --> 01:48:34,140
She goes,
I think at your best,

1862
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,120
but
these kinds of jokes.

1863
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:44,290
Oh, what a great line. A line
after line moving none other ones.

1864
01:48:45,610 --> 01:48:49,810
Your best bet. It's been a
minute. It goes, uh, you have
beautiful skin. She goes,

1865
01:48:49,811 --> 01:48:51,750
yes.
And it covers my entire body.

1866
01:48:55,110 --> 01:48:57,450
Well,
a midnight in Paris was really good.

1867
01:48:57,451 --> 01:49:01,410
And what's interesting about it is that
Owen Wilson plays woody Allen. Oh Wow.

1868
01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,220
Woody Allen can't play Woody Helen.
Yeah. He used to get the show on Wilson.

1869
01:49:05,240 --> 01:49:09,300
Exactly how he's doing.
Well,

1870
01:49:09,630 --> 01:49:12,930
he's not going new Yorkie.
He's going all the way Brooklyn,

1871
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:16,930
but he's basically that guy,
this nebbishy hotkeys.

1872
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:21,030
His wife is fucking around on him. It's
always in, in woody Allen's movies,

1873
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:25,050
someone always is having an affair right
under somebody's nose and it's chaos

1874
01:49:25,051 --> 01:49:28,460
and you find out, well you,
you were fucking this guy.
Right. In the other world,

1875
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:31,390
I mean, get over it. It's not
that big a deal like that.

1876
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:33,540
The way that people behave,

1877
01:49:33,740 --> 01:49:38,670
almost like as if he wishes that that
would be how people would behave at all

1878
01:49:38,671 --> 01:49:39,780
sexual indiscretions.
Right.

1879
01:49:39,990 --> 01:49:43,510
It's almost like he's flavoring
the world with a this diet.

1880
01:49:43,511 --> 01:49:47,460
Get them off the hook. What's it? Yeah,
because it's a very unnatural, like the,

1881
01:49:47,461 --> 01:49:51,040
the anger and reaction is people have,
it's like everything is real.

1882
01:49:51,041 --> 01:49:55,030
Except when it comes to like real
emotions dealing with loss or infidelity,

1883
01:49:55,210 --> 01:50:00,040
like then it becomes like,
well, get over it. I was right.
Dare you. You had to know.

1884
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:03,640
I didn't know, you know. Okay,
Harry, I was cheating. You know?

1885
01:50:03,641 --> 01:50:05,680
It's like one of those things and
the guy's like, I can't believe this,

1886
01:50:05,800 --> 01:50:08,890
and he leaves, but it's so unrealistic.
It's like everybody's like, whatever,

1887
01:50:08,891 --> 01:50:12,490
get over it. But in blue, jasmine
is another one that the, the uh,

1888
01:50:12,550 --> 01:50:14,980
Alec Baldwin Character,
I don't want to give a spoiler alert,

1889
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:18,280
but the reason why I brought it
up is dice is really good in it.

1890
01:50:18,640 --> 01:50:22,570
He's really good. He plays this
given to her. It was really short.

1891
01:50:23,720 --> 01:50:26,980
I like them short reason why he didn't
probably get any awards because it was

1892
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:31,000
probably, oh his, his thing was your movie
was too short. No, no. His, his role.

1893
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:34,840
He should've had a bigger part in it.
No, no, I think it was perfect. I mean,

1894
01:50:34,841 --> 01:50:38,920
it was a complex sort of a
role. It was, it was believable.

1895
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:41,950
There was a lot of, there was a lot
of good acting in that goddamn movie.

1896
01:50:41,951 --> 01:50:45,610
Cate Blanchett, the one woman who's
the lead is fucking sensational.

1897
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:48,150
You Know Sean Penn? Yes. Yeah.

1898
01:50:48,151 --> 01:50:51,270
When he said to me one night were at the
Improv and he just got a great memory

1899
01:50:51,271 --> 01:50:52,104
for comedy.

1900
01:50:52,290 --> 01:50:56,020
He said he remembered on all bitten and
he started telling me about it and I go,

1901
01:50:56,021 --> 01:50:57,180
all right,
if we're going to talk about comedy,

1902
01:50:57,181 --> 01:51:00,030
you gotta tell me what it was like
to work with Woody Allen. He said,

1903
01:51:00,031 --> 01:51:03,570
I'm glad you asked me that. He gave
me one note, the whole film. I said,

1904
01:51:03,571 --> 01:51:07,650
what was it? He goes, that last
scene you did. Uh, nothing was right.

1905
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:12,480
That was done. That's the only fucking
note. He had only direct nothing.

1906
01:51:12,481 --> 01:51:15,310
Nothing in that scene
was right. Wow. Yeah.

1907
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,410
Well, he's a master filmmaker. He's just
a weird guy. He's him. He's a genius.

1908
01:51:19,480 --> 01:51:22,830
Master filmmaker. Does blue
jasmine movies fucking really good?

1909
01:51:23,190 --> 01:51:25,560
I'd have to say he's the best writer.

1910
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:30,990
And then Larry David for comedy
in my, in my opinion, you know,

1911
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:35,490
you mean like joke writing or comedy
writing, right. Just common. Imovie and I,

1912
01:51:35,650 --> 01:51:36,483
Larry,
obviously

1913
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:40,840
it has not made the graduation to to
film. Like what are you, what he did,

1914
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:41,703
he shouldn't.

1915
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:44,270
His stuff is so good.
And curb your enthusiasm.

1916
01:51:44,271 --> 01:51:46,240
Just don't fuck with it and leave
it right there so that, that,

1917
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:47,930
that let them do whatever
the fuck he's doing.

1918
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:51,760
Let them make that exactly how he's
making it. Don't touch it. I watch

1919
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:56,500
a Seinfeld episode last night that
with the man's ear, the bra for men,

1920
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:02,400
the Bro and I had a prostate exam and I,

1921
01:52:02,741 --> 01:52:06,810
when I, when I was going to pee next,
it was going to be blood. Right, right.

1922
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:10,210
It was really fucking like I was,
it was really like fucking horrible.

1923
01:52:10,211 --> 01:52:15,040
I was like lightheaded and Shit and Jerry
was on the phone telling me about the

1924
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:18,790
fun about this episode before it happened
and we were fucking crying, laughing.

1925
01:52:19,780 --> 01:52:23,920
Just the idea of Jerry Stiller's tits
made us laugh for fucking five minutes.

1926
01:52:23,921 --> 01:52:27,890
What is this? I'm confused. What else do
you, pink blood. Oh, because I didn't see,

1927
01:52:27,910 --> 01:52:31,480
I didn't want to laugh. Oh, I'm
saying I didn't explain it right.

1928
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:34,720
I didn't want to laugh. I come back from
the hospital, I'm in this bed, man, Moon,

1929
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:36,880
fucking lightheaded or all Pale and shit.

1930
01:52:37,270 --> 01:52:40,030
And we started talking and he starts
telling me about this fucking, anyway,

1931
01:52:40,031 --> 01:52:43,330
I just reminded me of it because I
saw the episode last night and it's so

1932
01:52:43,331 --> 01:52:45,980
fucking brilliant. You
know the he, yeah, he

1933
01:52:46,250 --> 01:52:49,190
like everybody loves Raymond,
which was like a really standard,

1934
01:52:49,191 --> 01:52:53,810
like good quality sitcom. They had an
eight plot, basically maybe a B plot.

1935
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:57,470
Seinfeld had a, B, c, d, You know
what I mean? Just ridiculous.

1936
01:52:57,471 --> 01:53:01,010
Like Craig Kramer hits a golf
ball and it goes into the whales,

1937
01:53:01,280 --> 01:53:04,130
the blowhole and you know, they're
like, you know what I mean?

1938
01:53:04,160 --> 01:53:06,960
Like everything is connected and
how he did it was fascinating.

1939
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,520
22 minutes and clean and
Larry David's genius,

1940
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:14,360
but his best work is curby
enthusiasm in my opinion.

1941
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:15,500
It's Seinfeld is really good,

1942
01:53:15,501 --> 01:53:19,310
but curby enthusiasm and takes it to
the one where he had the water bottle in

1943
01:53:19,311 --> 01:53:21,830
his pants and he,
and I didn't want to tell the whole story.

1944
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,420
Hooker Carpool came and
tell you the stories that we
know that came out of Lowry

1945
01:53:26,421 --> 01:53:29,750
spoiled him that came out of Larry. I'm
not getting enough credit for Seinfeld.

1946
01:53:29,780 --> 01:53:32,540
I really believe that because
everybody would get credit.

1947
01:53:32,541 --> 01:53:35,750
George got credit for playing him
and you know, can Jason Alexander,

1948
01:53:35,751 --> 01:53:40,010
he's a terrific actor, but he was so much
in the background. He thought, fuck this,

1949
01:53:40,011 --> 01:53:42,320
I'm doing a show and he had
the power to do it. You know,

1950
01:53:42,321 --> 01:53:43,640
he put up his own money for that.

1951
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:47,990
Jason Alexander is a weird one because
nothing's really clicked for him since

1952
01:53:47,991 --> 01:53:49,940
doing that shit.
Who's so fucking good too.

1953
01:53:49,970 --> 01:53:53,950
He was so good on that show and now he's
taken to wearing a hairpiece. I know.

1954
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:57,920
And you know I saw the one last night
where where he wore a hairpiece on a show.

1955
01:53:57,921 --> 01:54:02,210
It's a joke as a joke and now he's wearing
one in real life. It's a what's like,

1956
01:54:02,330 --> 01:54:03,163
I dunno what,

1957
01:54:03,190 --> 01:54:05,540
unless you're going to do it like Carl
Reiner did where you just take it off

1958
01:54:05,541 --> 01:54:07,730
sometime and where I'm trying,

1959
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:10,310
I think it's funny cause they
going to try to fool anybody.

1960
01:54:10,340 --> 01:54:11,430
He's not trying to fool anybody.

1961
01:54:11,431 --> 01:54:14,180
You can't because everybody
knows that he was already bald,

1962
01:54:14,181 --> 01:54:18,020
and I think he just likes the way
it looks better, which good for him.

1963
01:54:18,260 --> 01:54:21,380
But why you worrying so much about what
you look like? It's a little weird.

1964
01:54:21,410 --> 01:54:23,240
I said, just wear a hat.
I don't wear anything.

1965
01:54:23,270 --> 01:54:25,460
It's not like it affects
his performance in some way.

1966
01:54:25,461 --> 01:54:28,400
Like if growing your hair
made you smarter somehow.

1967
01:54:28,640 --> 01:54:30,840
Like imagine if like
hair was like muscles.

1968
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:34,470
Like the bigger your muscles get stronger,
you get the longer hair gets smarter,

1969
01:54:34,471 --> 01:54:35,450
you get,
well,

1970
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:38,960
I could get wanting to have more hair
and if you could wear a toupee that would

1971
01:54:38,961 --> 01:54:39,794
make you smart.

1972
01:54:39,980 --> 01:54:43,040
It might've given the people were that
were that simple that you just had to

1973
01:54:43,041 --> 01:54:46,610
fiber optic to pay and you put on it
would mimic the effects of having a full

1974
01:54:46,611 --> 01:54:50,820
head of hair as far as your intelligence
goes or grow it even further when you

1975
01:54:50,930 --> 01:54:55,280
remember what goes on with the ego. Who
these guys, you know, and Jay Jason was,

1976
01:54:55,340 --> 01:54:58,730
I remember being on that set and he was
upset because he never wanted an Emmy.

1977
01:54:59,330 --> 01:55:03,230
Oh God. He won grammy awards. Dude,

1978
01:55:03,231 --> 01:55:06,980
I was on a set of news radio wants and
everybody was complaining. It was dark.

1979
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:10,730
It was like everybody was
bummed out because our ratings
were down and there was,

1980
01:55:11,210 --> 01:55:13,760
you know, it was like, God, we
can't get on Thursday night,

1981
01:55:13,761 --> 01:55:17,690
but this show goes on right before friends
or right after friends and blah, blah,

1982
01:55:17,691 --> 01:55:22,580
blah, blah, blah. And I remember thinking
like, we're on a sitcom. Oh yeah.

1983
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:26,810
Oh lucky you are to be on a sitcom.
And it's a really funny one.

1984
01:55:26,811 --> 01:55:30,950
And we're not appreciating it as it's
happening. Right as it's going on.

1985
01:55:31,160 --> 01:55:34,640
We're wishing we were number one
instead of whatever the fuck we were.

1986
01:55:34,641 --> 01:55:37,220
We weren't doing well like
news radio never did well.

1987
01:55:37,400 --> 01:55:39,620
It didn't do really well
until it was syndicated.

1988
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:43,850
They didn't know how to use you at all.
News radio did. Oh, I, some great parts.

1989
01:55:44,720 --> 01:55:48,450
I think they could have used you
more. Oh, that's very nice to you.

1990
01:55:48,451 --> 01:55:49,410
But that's just cause you love me.

1991
01:55:49,411 --> 01:55:52,260
I think they use me the perfect amount
and we consider the fact that we have so

1992
01:55:52,261 --> 01:55:56,210
many characters. Andy, Dick,
Vicky Lewis, Steven Root,

1993
01:55:56,211 --> 01:56:00,200
candy Alexander, Phil Hartman,
Dave Foley, Maura Tierney,

1994
01:56:00,210 --> 01:56:04,250
me the fucking shit. Yeah, that's a
lot. It was an eight person castle,

1995
01:56:04,251 --> 01:56:07,800
a lot of fucking people at 22 minute
show and you're bouncing everything back

1996
01:56:07,801 --> 01:56:11,370
and forth and you got two,
well three monsters on the cast.

1997
01:56:11,371 --> 01:56:14,460
You got Phil Hartman who's a
monster day, Foley, a monster,

1998
01:56:14,461 --> 01:56:15,810
and Andy Dick was a monster.

1999
01:56:16,170 --> 01:56:21,150
So those were like the go to guys for
like carrying scenes and big moments and

2000
01:56:21,470 --> 01:56:23,670
you know, I would come in with
something wacky on occasion,

2001
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:28,230
some wacky thing that I
would do. I thought they were
great about divvying it up.

2002
01:56:28,410 --> 01:56:31,670
The one who got the slight,
and my opinion is candy Alexander,

2003
01:56:31,910 --> 01:56:35,520
the black truck that was on the
show. She's a bad ass actress, man.

2004
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:40,470
That girl is a powerful, strong actress
and I just don't think they ever really,

2005
01:56:40,471 --> 01:56:45,060
totally got her. I don't think she
had enough roles where it was like,

2006
01:56:45,540 --> 01:56:50,440
but you know a bunch of white dudes
from Harvard. Right. So sexy blast,

2007
01:56:50,740 --> 01:56:55,150
we'll show you did right before the
hardball or a piece of Shit. Yeah,

2008
01:56:55,240 --> 01:56:58,830
that was cool. You got it right
away. I got lucky, that's for sure.

2009
01:56:59,100 --> 01:57:02,790
The two things that were the
luckiest that I ever got was uh,

2010
01:57:02,820 --> 01:57:06,180
getting hardball and from getting
hardboiled, getting news radio, you know,

2011
01:57:06,181 --> 01:57:11,070
the fear factor thing was a more of a
response to not wanting to be in the

2012
01:57:11,071 --> 01:57:12,480
acting world anymore.
You know,

2013
01:57:12,481 --> 01:57:16,520
when I took fear factor for the money
a but also be because I knew it wasn't,

2014
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:18,480
I didn't,
I wouldn't have to deal with actors.

2015
01:57:18,800 --> 01:57:22,620
I wasn't going to have to deal with
scripts and the creative aspect of bad

2016
01:57:22,621 --> 01:57:26,190
comedy because you go from a show like
news radio, which is a really good show.

2017
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:29,940
Try finding another really good
show. Good luck. Oh, I know.

2018
01:57:30,450 --> 01:57:34,260
I've been on them and I read from
something they would just, it was painful.

2019
01:57:34,261 --> 01:57:36,750
They were bad.
It just clumsy and clunky.

2020
01:57:37,020 --> 01:57:41,060
Joey got fired from a show that was
written for me. I couldn't play.

2021
01:57:41,130 --> 01:57:42,720
And the guy that was so fun and you know,

2022
01:57:42,970 --> 01:57:46,350
it was so happy when it went down
in flames because it was so bad.

2023
01:57:46,890 --> 01:57:48,630
They hired like this real actors guy.

2024
01:57:48,631 --> 01:57:51,360
Dan had day and he couldn't make
it work and it's just a day.

2025
01:57:51,360 --> 01:57:53,820
And why do I know that name?
He was the father and clueless.

2026
01:57:54,600 --> 01:57:58,740
It was sheriff's father
and includes. Wow. But uh,

2027
01:57:59,340 --> 01:58:02,100
would you do another
sitcom? Yeah, definitely.

2028
01:58:02,101 --> 01:58:04,260
If Paul Simms was going
to do another Sitcom,

2029
01:58:04,290 --> 01:58:05,940
the guy who made news radio
is you wanting to do it.

2030
01:58:05,941 --> 01:58:08,490
I almost did another one at his.
I'd love to work with you man.

2031
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:13,140
I did a pilot of a show called
um, overseas. It was a pilot.

2032
01:58:13,170 --> 01:58:16,740
I played like some guy that was on some
other country for some strange reason I

2033
01:58:16,741 --> 01:58:21,120
got stuck over there. So, but
uh, he's just a brilliant guy.

2034
01:58:21,121 --> 01:58:22,920
It's just such an out of the box guy.

2035
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:24,840
I know there's other out
of the box guys out there,

2036
01:58:24,841 --> 01:58:28,020
you know to think the guy who,
uh, what's his name? Dan Harmon,

2037
01:58:28,021 --> 01:58:30,240
the guy who makes community,
like everybody's saying the community,

2038
01:58:30,241 --> 01:58:32,760
it's just like a hundred times better
than seats. And now that he's back,

2039
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:36,600
he's back and chase. He's
gone. Yeah, he Chevy chase.
Yeah, that was the other thing.

2040
01:58:36,630 --> 01:58:39,830
Um, he's a happy go. Lucky Guy,
Huh? Yeah, it doesn't seem to, Huh?

2041
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,670
What's the guy's name?
Um,

2042
01:58:42,080 --> 01:58:46,660
the, the soup, uh, Joel Mchale, sorry.

2043
01:58:46,690 --> 01:58:50,170
Great Guy Too. By the way. I feel like
a Dick for not remembering your name,

2044
01:58:50,171 --> 01:58:51,400
but I blame the weed.
Uh,

2045
01:58:51,490 --> 01:58:55,060
Joel Mchale was on Opie and Anthony and
he was talking about Chevy chase that he

2046
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:58,420
just really didn't want to be there. How
do you get insulted that your own roast,

2047
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:02,080
you get insulted their rose. It's a roast.
You have, they're going to say things.

2048
01:59:02,130 --> 01:59:06,010
It's supposed to hurt your feelings.
Exactly. That's why you don't get a roast.

2049
01:59:06,450 --> 01:59:09,340
Do you gotta do organize around?
So I liked them.

2050
01:59:09,341 --> 01:59:12,520
I liked them when I did them and
I did, um, in the, uh, with those,

2051
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:13,690
like the real old guy,

2052
01:59:13,691 --> 01:59:17,800
I was like the young kid and it was Milton
Berle and all those guys in the 80s.

2053
01:59:18,070 --> 01:59:20,710
And I liked them because they were
like the real originators of the roast.

2054
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:24,910
Now how, how much can you talk about
how big Cloris Leachman is? Kindness,

2055
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,310
you know what I mean? It's like
how far is it? Is that come out?

2056
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:31,870
Is that like a big part of roasts and
now for the mandatory and how big is

2057
01:59:31,871 --> 01:59:32,860
Cloris?
Leachman?

2058
01:59:32,861 --> 01:59:37,660
Actually it came up about fucking
20 times when I went to see, um,

2059
01:59:38,590 --> 01:59:43,420
uh, Pamela Anderson Roast it. I think
it was, uh, or no, maybe it was her sag.

2060
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:46,780
I forget. I always get
those two mixed up. And uh,

2061
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,690
they just relentlessly
did the same fucking joke.

2062
01:59:49,691 --> 01:59:52,840
You could drive a car into
Pamela Anderson's Conn and
this is that, you know,

2063
01:59:52,841 --> 01:59:56,990
it was like, oh, this is so not true. I've
seen that video. Tommy leave video. Yeah.

2064
01:59:57,010 --> 02:00:01,030
You couldn't, tiny little
thing. Yeah, they got all
kind of cars. Are you driving?

2065
02:00:01,210 --> 02:00:05,590
I can't jerk off to a video like that.
No. No, not like too big. Well, no,

2066
02:00:05,591 --> 02:00:09,520
just a married couple that I don't want
to, I ain't want to see people that are,

2067
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:13,390
you know, like out of this
world. Not Real, real people.

2068
02:00:13,450 --> 02:00:17,590
Like our prostitute friend. I haven't
been with a prostitute and wow, how long?

2069
02:00:17,710 --> 02:00:22,150
Couple of days. But uh,
what time is it? No, I,

2070
02:00:22,660 --> 02:00:25,780
I took blood pressure medication
about two years ago and it made me,

2071
02:00:25,781 --> 02:00:28,510
like we were saying, made me
less Italian, a more Irish.

2072
02:00:28,570 --> 02:00:33,400
Do you think that you would ever be
into doing something to radically change

2073
02:00:33,401 --> 02:00:34,900
your health?
Like if someone,

2074
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:38,080
if you took on like someone
who told you what to eat,

2075
02:00:38,410 --> 02:00:39,940
gay worked you out every day,

2076
02:00:40,210 --> 02:00:44,020
put you through the paces and got
your body into a better shape,

2077
02:00:44,021 --> 02:00:48,730
better condition and actually, can I get
in better shape? It's almost impossible.

2078
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:51,490
I mean you're at the top like an Olympic.
We're going to like,

2079
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:55,600
we can wiki all the shit
out wall. Go fine. Tune it,

2080
02:00:55,601 --> 02:00:58,750
fine tune it a little bit,
a bit. Know where I am.

2081
02:00:58,750 --> 02:01:00,880
I'm totally fucking pleased with,

2082
02:01:01,100 --> 02:01:05,710
I love having a gut because I got
something to rest my hands on when I'm

2083
02:01:05,711 --> 02:01:07,300
thinking you have my favorite,

2084
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:12,400
my favorite line ever when it comes
to being gay, being in the closet,

2085
02:01:13,950 --> 02:01:16,900
you'd go, I wish I was in the
closet just so I could come out.

2086
02:01:17,240 --> 02:01:21,070
That's how little I give a fuck.
That was just a line for the show.

2087
02:01:21,071 --> 02:01:22,030
I know we did that on stage,

2088
02:01:22,110 --> 02:01:24,690
said I wish I was gay just so
I could come out of the closet.

2089
02:01:26,350 --> 02:01:28,000
Some exciting look at Todd glass.

2090
02:01:28,001 --> 02:01:30,970
He got more press on that fucking
hell and it made her career. Well,

2091
02:01:30,971 --> 02:01:33,670
I'll tell you what, when Todd glass
came on the podcast, he real I,

2092
02:01:33,671 --> 02:01:36,910
that is the first time I had
talked to him in person since uh,

2093
02:01:36,940 --> 02:01:40,310
he came out and I guess you're
supposed to say he seems so relieved

2094
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:44,420
and he was so relieved that he could come
on the Sean beat got barbecued who was

2095
02:01:44,421 --> 02:01:47,930
so relieved that we could all do that
together and the giggling and silly and he

2096
02:01:47,931 --> 02:01:50,840
wouldn't have to worry about feeling
like he's being attacked whether he was

2097
02:01:50,841 --> 02:01:53,600
hiding something. That's a
big thing for those guys, man.

2098
02:01:54,080 --> 02:01:57,470
Or for those girls or anybody who is
hiding something like that, you know?

2099
02:01:57,790 --> 02:01:59,510
No one should care,
man. No one should care.

2100
02:01:59,511 --> 02:02:02,570
You should be able to tell people that
you're into dressing like a girl should

2101
02:02:02,571 --> 02:02:04,710
be able to tell the people
that you like to fuck.

2102
02:02:04,711 --> 02:02:06,830
I should be able to tell
me whatever the fuck it is.

2103
02:02:07,270 --> 02:02:10,220
Ugly your fucking girl
and you were on you. Me,

2104
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,770
I fucking jaw. You would be a little
bit uglier than me. It's a little bit,

2105
02:02:15,980 --> 02:02:18,940
a little bit more confused me a
little bit. How to check the mail too.

2106
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,330
I like to think of a judge.
If I was going to go to uh,

2107
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:27,650
a girl to get a hand job, I might go to
you. Ah, but soft hair I would think.

2108
02:02:27,651 --> 02:02:32,510
Yeah. Soft hands. And there's a lot of
like, I'm not blowing anybody though.

2109
02:02:32,990 --> 02:02:34,550
That's where I draw the line.
Even if I was a cow.

2110
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:37,310
But if I think the blonde somewhere,
that condom,

2111
02:02:37,311 --> 02:02:41,420
it's just like fucking shaking their
hand through a window, you know, come on.

2112
02:02:41,540 --> 02:02:44,450
What's going on there? You know, you
need to put your hand on the glass.

2113
02:02:44,810 --> 02:02:46,390
You're not really shaking hands.
Yeah.

2114
02:02:46,600 --> 02:02:50,060
Someone just going up and down on your
Dick when there's a condom on it. Like,

2115
02:02:50,061 --> 02:02:54,740
what is that
weird barrier between you and pleasure?

2116
02:02:55,670 --> 02:02:58,940
And we need that because people have
diseases in their mouths and their decks

2117
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:05,390
were gross. People are gross or fucking
gross diseases. There was this hooker,

2118
02:03:05,391 --> 02:03:09,710
she's a porn. I love the porn star
fucking theory like everybody takes,

2119
02:03:10,110 --> 02:03:12,440
but they never say,
they say just he's a working actor.

2120
02:03:12,441 --> 02:03:15,470
I know what I'm saying is that he's a
star. He's not as starting the, anyway,

2121
02:03:15,471 --> 02:03:19,010
she came up, she came up to me at the
comedy store, gave me a hug. She goes,

2122
02:03:19,370 --> 02:03:20,420
then she Facebook being,

2123
02:03:20,421 --> 02:03:24,950
but my ex wife does my Facebook and she
wrote that to tell you that he did sound

2124
02:03:24,980 --> 02:03:28,490
okay. Uh, she, she came after me.

2125
02:03:28,491 --> 02:03:33,491
She says she would when she went to the
exchange sexual favors for comedy wisdom

2126
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:37,370
and my wife's and said, you know, she
goes, who is my ex wife? She goes,

2127
02:03:37,371 --> 02:03:39,710
who is this fucking nut?
I just ripped it up and throw it out

2128
02:03:41,820 --> 02:03:46,150
because she's sounding like a whore. I go,
but that's the good thing. Right. Anyway,

2129
02:03:46,160 --> 02:03:50,270
she doesn't know you very well know.
Anyway, she did get in touch with me and,

2130
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:53,990
but you know what? She was so fucking
annoying about comedy. It turned me off.

2131
02:03:54,140 --> 02:03:57,790
Really? Yeah, because she wanted way more
comedy that I wanted. Anything from her.

2132
02:03:58,520 --> 02:04:00,830
Well, when someone that
I saw in a lesbian video,

2133
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:04,900
when someone wants to learn
how to do comedy there,

2134
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:08,360
you know there's a few things you
could tell him, but there's very few.

2135
02:04:08,430 --> 02:04:10,730
It's the real thing that they
need to do is go on stage,

2136
02:04:11,060 --> 02:04:15,200
go onstage a lot and then
chop it down yourself.

2137
02:04:15,620 --> 02:04:19,730
Minimize the amount of words you use,
maximize the impact of those words,

2138
02:04:19,970 --> 02:04:21,890
figure those things out and fake.
Find out what it is.

2139
02:04:21,891 --> 02:04:23,030
It's funny and unique about you.

2140
02:04:23,031 --> 02:04:24,950
Listen to yourself because
a few things you could tell.

2141
02:04:24,951 --> 02:04:27,470
Some of them when they want to
go over individual bits with you,

2142
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:29,090
they basically want
you to write their act.

2143
02:04:29,090 --> 02:04:32,050
And that happens to a lot of
boyfriends. I mean that's a, it's,

2144
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:36,470
it's a joke that I've heard
used on several different
comedians that are female

2145
02:04:36,471 --> 02:04:39,930
that wind up dating men that are also
comedians and then start writing their

2146
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:44,790
acts. I mean, we know guys who have done
it. It happens all the fucking time.

2147
02:04:45,060 --> 02:04:49,410
And you know, that's not as fun.
That's, that's weird. That's a weird,

2148
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:50,910
but it's seat.

2149
02:04:51,300 --> 02:04:55,230
But then this case is like Thompson Jura
and Christina Palicki where I'm sure

2150
02:04:55,231 --> 02:04:58,440
they go over bits with each other,
but they go over bits as peers.

2151
02:04:58,770 --> 02:05:01,160
You know what I'm saying?
Like Tom's not rewriting her act.

2152
02:05:01,210 --> 02:05:05,730
She's not rewriting Thom Zak. They're both
holds for, yeah. Yes. But that's ideal.

2153
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:06,420
You know,
like,

2154
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:09,180
that's why I love when something like
that happens because people always like to

2155
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:11,020
use that, uh, that thing.

2156
02:05:11,021 --> 02:05:16,021
Like that's standby cliche
that two comedians can never
be husband and wife and

2157
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:20,880
be happy to people that are,
you know, in the same position,

2158
02:05:21,090 --> 02:05:24,000
the same sort of occupation. They
would just wind up fighting each other.

2159
02:05:24,450 --> 02:05:27,630
Tom and Christina get along great
and they're both fucking great.

2160
02:05:27,631 --> 02:05:30,720
They're both really funny people.
They're like, you see them together,

2161
02:05:30,721 --> 02:05:35,310
the laughing together and they're always
laughing with each other and like they

2162
02:05:35,311 --> 02:05:37,920
enjoy each other's company
and they're both really good.

2163
02:05:38,430 --> 02:05:40,650
It's so rare when you see something
like that. It's so awesome.

2164
02:05:40,651 --> 02:05:43,680
I think that's the aberration. I don't
think it's normal, but it's possible.

2165
02:05:43,681 --> 02:05:46,860
It's possible. It's totally
possible. That's what I like.

2166
02:05:46,930 --> 02:05:50,940
I liked that it's possible. That ruined
my marriage. Yeah, the competition. Yeah,

2167
02:05:51,270 --> 02:05:55,380
because like I was getting hired for
Saturday night live like in 1980 and I got

2168
02:05:55,381 --> 02:05:58,440
like three episodes. It's a long
story. It's not even worth it.

2169
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:01,380
Sound like Brian Calendar right now.
I'll do it real big deal.

2170
02:06:01,381 --> 02:06:03,690
I was just like the greatest
comedian of all time. No, no,

2171
02:06:03,691 --> 02:06:06,730
I didn't mean it like this.
I just put the story was to let,

2172
02:06:06,780 --> 02:06:09,420
the story was actually too long,
but anyway, she would come.

2173
02:06:09,430 --> 02:06:12,120
I'm not on the fucking show
and I'd come home. She goes,

2174
02:06:12,121 --> 02:06:15,630
did you mention me to them? Like,
oh, I'm not. I said, mentioned you.

2175
02:06:15,631 --> 02:06:18,750
I don't even have a fucking voice. I
don't even have an agent. You know?

2176
02:06:18,751 --> 02:06:22,460
So that was, that really kind of ruined
a lot of things. Yeah, that's rough. Oh,

2177
02:06:22,470 --> 02:06:23,340
did you mention me?

2178
02:06:23,670 --> 02:06:27,980
I had a friend who got apart and his
girlfriend started crying immediately and

2179
02:06:27,981 --> 02:06:31,770
it's like, when is something going to
happen for me? Oh No. It was a, it was so,

2180
02:06:31,890 --> 02:06:34,770
it was so uncomfortable to be
around. Yeah, that's, it was,

2181
02:06:34,771 --> 02:06:38,220
she was doing it like in front
of me and I was like, okay. Uh,

2182
02:06:38,310 --> 02:06:41,640
she was crying in front of you. Oh
yeah. Yeah. He, he, he goes, guess what?

2183
02:06:41,640 --> 02:06:45,060
I got the part. Oh. And
she starts crying. Like,

2184
02:06:45,061 --> 02:06:46,140
when is something going to happen to me?

2185
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:51,120
I think for some people they're just
not cut out for the pressure of,

2186
02:06:51,540 --> 02:06:54,450
of like trying to audition
and go after things.

2187
02:06:54,451 --> 02:06:57,420
Like one of the things that people
point out is I'll crazy actresses are,

2188
02:06:57,421 --> 02:07:00,240
and actors are, but I think one of
the reasons why they're so crazy,

2189
02:07:00,241 --> 02:07:02,400
it's not just that they came here crazy,

2190
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:07,500
but that the process itself is so
terrifying and mind numbing and obsessive

2191
02:07:07,800 --> 02:07:11,440
because it's so difficult to get cast
in something so difficult when you

2192
02:07:11,441 --> 02:07:15,120
competing against thousands of other
people on a daily basis for a limited

2193
02:07:15,121 --> 02:07:17,190
amount of roles and every,
and you're, you know,

2194
02:07:17,191 --> 02:07:19,830
you're barely getting by and then
you finally do get something.

2195
02:07:19,831 --> 02:07:22,620
I think all those years and
years and years of rejection,

2196
02:07:22,621 --> 02:07:27,000
and then you could really fuck with
people's heads. But yeah, it's really bad.

2197
02:07:27,001 --> 02:07:29,100
Especially when they're
already a little bit insecure.

2198
02:07:29,101 --> 02:07:30,450
They're already a little bit nutty.

2199
02:07:30,810 --> 02:07:34,050
They already maybe possibly a little bit
depressed, maybe a little bit chemical,

2200
02:07:34,500 --> 02:07:36,010
you know? Yeah. I just

2201
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:38,500
never thought like anybody
else's success diminished me.

2202
02:07:38,950 --> 02:07:42,100
Like I didn't think because Eddie Murphy
got 48 hours that if he didn't get it,

2203
02:07:42,101 --> 02:07:44,340
I was going to get it. You
know? I just never thought like,

2204
02:07:44,620 --> 02:07:48,440
no, you never did. You never had
and you've never had like this, uh,

2205
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:52,690
this is a weird resentment than
a lot of people have towards, uh,

2206
02:07:52,750 --> 02:07:56,980
people that they've no relation
to. You know, look, you
fucking this guy, you know,

2207
02:07:56,981 --> 02:08:00,820
damn Wayman steam Wayne, since he's a
motherfucker. Damon Wayans ain't got shit.

2208
02:08:00,821 --> 02:08:03,010
I was like, you know, why?

2209
02:08:03,011 --> 02:08:06,040
What do you care about Damian Wayans is
he hitting to in any way affecting your

2210
02:08:06,041 --> 02:08:06,874
path?

2211
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:10,470
I mean, look at your career. Are you,
you have the, you have such a, I mean,

2212
02:08:10,900 --> 02:08:14,160
it's such a unique is redundant,
but I mean like,

2213
02:08:14,220 --> 02:08:18,520
I could never fucking announced
this. The fights like you do, you,

2214
02:08:18,630 --> 02:08:21,750
you're an expert on that shit. What
did he, there's no competition.

2215
02:08:21,751 --> 02:08:25,620
You're stand up and mine are so different
to hopefully the only end result is

2216
02:08:25,621 --> 02:08:26,454
they're both funny.

2217
02:08:28,060 --> 02:08:31,340
We're both very lucky. You know, we're
both very lucky that we figured out our,

2218
02:08:31,341 --> 02:08:33,810
our, our path in life.
You know, I just, I'm,

2219
02:08:33,870 --> 02:08:37,480
I'm in a weird spot where I'm extremely
lucky because I liked to do a lot of

2220
02:08:37,481 --> 02:08:41,140
things. Yeah. And I get lucky that
there's a job for those things.

2221
02:08:41,170 --> 02:08:46,060
Like if the UFC didn't exist, I would
watch an exact, I mean if the job,

2222
02:08:46,061 --> 02:08:48,820
rather than me being a commentator
didn't exist. If they just,

2223
02:08:48,821 --> 02:08:51,070
we just watched fights live and
no one ever talked about it,

2224
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:55,060
I would still be doing the same thing.
I'd be doing the exact same almost. Yeah.

2225
02:08:55,090 --> 02:08:58,360
I mean I would, I wish certain wouldn't
be breaking it down for a broadcast,

2226
02:08:58,361 --> 02:09:01,210
but I'll be watching every single
one of them. I'd watch everything.

2227
02:09:01,211 --> 02:09:03,730
I've watched them live if I could.
I did before I even worked there.

2228
02:09:03,730 --> 02:09:06,850
I just got super lucky.
You can hear how happy or doing the,

2229
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:10,600
you can hear it in your voice. You'll
love it. Yeah, I do enjoy it. It's fun,

2230
02:09:10,840 --> 02:09:14,140
but I'm, I'm just lucky. I'm
lucky. There's a lot of cool
shit to do in the world.

2231
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:17,140
You know, martial arts is just
one of many cool things. I mean,

2232
02:09:17,170 --> 02:09:21,820
I could probably learn new things
forever and ever and always be excited.

2233
02:09:21,821 --> 02:09:24,940
Like skateboarding seems like it'd be fun.
I just started learning how to ski.

2234
02:09:24,941 --> 02:09:27,130
Skiing is fun. It's exciting. I mean,

2235
02:09:27,131 --> 02:09:29,350
I bet it would be really fun to learn
how to play an instrument. You know?

2236
02:09:29,351 --> 02:09:33,010
If I had more time, I'd probably pursue
that. I started doing archery recently.

2237
02:09:33,370 --> 02:09:37,900
I got these targets. I set them up in my
backyard. I bought a bowtech experience.

2238
02:09:38,290 --> 02:09:42,140
60 pound poll, compound bow. Oh Dude.

2239
02:09:42,141 --> 02:09:45,580
It shoots things like a laser beam.
What's amazing? Come on. Oh please,

2240
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:48,400
come on over. Let's have a boat party.
Please hide those from the kids.

2241
02:09:48,700 --> 02:09:50,800
They can't touch it. They could never
pull it back in the first place.

2242
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:53,350
I mean hours a locked up the the bow.

2243
02:09:53,351 --> 02:09:57,790
It's so incredibly difficult to pull
back 60 pounds like he a grown man,

2244
02:09:57,791 --> 02:10:01,960
like yourself. Not like me. Of course
I could just pull that bitch back.

2245
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:02,650
Flip for real.

2246
02:10:02,650 --> 02:10:07,090
The really strong guys actually use a 70
pound bull beau guy in here yesterday.

2247
02:10:07,091 --> 02:10:10,630
It's probably 20 pounds lighter than me.
He actually uses a 70 pound bow,

2248
02:10:10,660 --> 02:10:13,300
so he's used a bow that's 10
pounds a stronger than mine,

2249
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:14,980
but I'm just learning how to do it now.

2250
02:10:14,981 --> 02:10:17,680
I'm not really concerned with it being
like the fastest boat in the world.

2251
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:22,370
I just enjoy hitting targets.
I have these rubber, um,

2252
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:26,440
squares like set up at different parts
of my yard and I get up on this little

2253
02:10:26,441 --> 02:10:31,240
platform in my yard. I get the dogs out
of the yard and shoot arrows. It's fun,

2254
02:10:31,241 --> 02:10:35,180
man. It's really exciting. It's when
you hit a target that you want to hit,

2255
02:10:35,390 --> 02:10:40,110
like whatever reason, you know your,
your, your body goes Ooh. Yeah. It's like,

2256
02:10:40,130 --> 02:10:43,970
it's more exciting than
shooting a basketball into
a net like basketball, new.

2257
02:10:43,980 --> 02:10:48,110
Ned's always been exciting like playing
horse like three points. Whoa. But,

2258
02:10:48,680 --> 02:10:51,390
but a fucking 50 yard
bullseye with an arrow.

2259
02:10:52,220 --> 02:10:55,360
There's something like it goes to
your DNA, some Robin Hood. Shit.

2260
02:10:55,361 --> 02:10:58,580
It's leftover third some watermelons
in the backyard. That sounds fun. Yeah,

2261
02:10:58,710 --> 02:11:02,360
but watermelons or food. I don't
want to waste food. I feel guilty.

2262
02:11:02,770 --> 02:11:06,310
I can't be wasted food. But I'll fuck
up a squirrel that got catch slipping.

2263
02:11:07,230 --> 02:11:10,040
I'll eat to squirrel that I catch from my
backyard. What do you think about that?

2264
02:11:10,070 --> 02:11:14,540
That rhino that that's in the news
fucked up. Fucked up. Fucked up. Crazy,

2265
02:11:14,541 --> 02:11:16,940
ridiculous. Doesn't make
any sense. Makes me sick.

2266
02:11:17,510 --> 02:11:21,110
I don't like the idea for you don't
know the story. There's a black rhino.

2267
02:11:21,380 --> 02:11:26,350
They audition, they auctioned off a a
right to hunt. This black rhino and the,

2268
02:11:26,370 --> 02:11:30,790
the winning bidder paid
$350,000 to kill this, uh,

2269
02:11:31,250 --> 02:11:34,250
endangered Anna. That's fucked
up. And because of that,

2270
02:11:34,280 --> 02:11:37,550
$1 million is going to go to the
preservation of the black rhino.

2271
02:11:37,551 --> 02:11:42,080
I think that's ridiculous.
I think that guy's an asshole.

2272
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:46,940
I don't care if that money goes to the
preservation would, this guy should do,

2273
02:11:47,450 --> 02:11:51,050
if he's really concerned, this guy,
this hunter is go hunt with a camera,

2274
02:11:51,110 --> 02:11:51,860
goddammit.

2275
02:11:51,860 --> 02:11:55,460
Go get a really good close up photograph
of this thing and know that you could

2276
02:11:55,461 --> 02:11:58,100
have killed it. No, you've could have
killed it. You don't have to kill you.

2277
02:11:58,140 --> 02:12:01,850
And then while you're there, go shoot some
shit that you can kill your in Africa.

2278
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:05,950
Go shoot some wild buck.
Go shoot some a ward hogs.

2279
02:12:05,960 --> 02:12:08,600
Go shoot some things that the
locals will eat, you know?

2280
02:12:08,601 --> 02:12:11,330
And then it actually benefits the
people there. If you go to Africa,

2281
02:12:11,331 --> 02:12:14,810
like I saw Matt Hughes
who's a former UFC champion,

2282
02:12:14,820 --> 02:12:17,360
one of the greatest mixed
martial arts fighters ever.

2283
02:12:17,570 --> 02:12:20,900
He's also a big hunter and he went to
Africa with his son and he took all these

2284
02:12:20,901 --> 02:12:25,880
photos of them shooting these animals
and people just were all up his ass.

2285
02:12:25,881 --> 02:12:29,420
They were just shitting all
over him and tell him, you know,

2286
02:12:29,421 --> 02:12:32,810
he's an asshole and he's not even eating
that food. These are trophy hunters.

2287
02:12:32,811 --> 02:12:33,860
He shot so many animals.

2288
02:12:34,220 --> 02:12:37,490
Well they don't realize is when you go
there and you do something like that,

2289
02:12:37,491 --> 02:12:42,410
they take the money that you use to pay
for your trip and that money goes to

2290
02:12:42,411 --> 02:12:46,010
preserve these animals.
Then the meat from hunting,

2291
02:12:46,011 --> 02:12:50,030
that animal goes to feed these local
villagers. Like they get very happy,

2292
02:12:50,240 --> 02:12:53,870
like they're excited. They get all
this lean, they don't have guns,

2293
02:12:54,020 --> 02:12:57,650
and so they get all this lean protein
free from these hunters and they get it

2294
02:12:57,651 --> 02:13:00,890
every day because every
day they're bringing in new
hunters and everyday they're

2295
02:13:00,891 --> 02:13:02,120
harvesting new animals.

2296
02:13:02,540 --> 02:13:06,140
Like people don't like it because
they feel like it should be a direct

2297
02:13:06,141 --> 02:13:08,000
relationship.
You should shoot a deer,

2298
02:13:08,001 --> 02:13:10,760
then you eat the deer or give some of
the meat out to your friends or something

2299
02:13:10,761 --> 02:13:12,380
like that,
which I kind of agree with.

2300
02:13:12,590 --> 02:13:15,820
I don't want to be the guy that's like
going somewhere to kill animals for a

2301
02:13:15,830 --> 02:13:17,840
bunch of different people.
But if you did,

2302
02:13:18,020 --> 02:13:20,510
that's actually a very
selfless thing to do. I mean,

2303
02:13:20,511 --> 02:13:24,440
he's enjoying the hunting aspect of it,
but he's also donating all these,

2304
02:13:24,710 --> 02:13:28,190
all this meat to poor people,
but nobody wants to see it that way.

2305
02:13:28,190 --> 02:13:31,530
Everybody has this black or white
thing when it comes to animals.

2306
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:35,580
Either you love animals and respect
them and you don't shoot them,

2307
02:13:35,880 --> 02:13:38,430
or you hate animals and you
were fucking evil person.

2308
02:13:38,431 --> 02:13:40,290
Even if you both have the same diet.

2309
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:43,710
I mean the idea that someone would want
to kill that thing when we know there's

2310
02:13:43,711 --> 02:13:47,970
only like a few thousand of them
left, that's fucking crazy. You know?

2311
02:13:48,150 --> 02:13:50,550
I hope so many steps in and I hope,

2312
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:53,250
I mean really that's something that
the president should talk about.

2313
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:56,610
The president should have a fucking
joint conference where he talks about

2314
02:13:56,640 --> 02:14:01,320
seaworld and killing black
rhinos and B, just say, what did,

2315
02:14:01,321 --> 02:14:05,010
what would we do if someone came here
from looking? They sought off the horn.

2316
02:14:05,460 --> 02:14:08,760
Oh my God. That's fucked
man. Know why? Right? Yeah.

2317
02:14:08,761 --> 02:14:11,700
Because Chinese dudes think that it
makes your dick hard on her pills.

2318
02:14:11,790 --> 02:14:15,230
They haven't figured out if I
angry at, I guess, you know.

2319
02:14:15,270 --> 02:14:18,780
No Way Rhino Horn is as good as Viagra,
by the way. You know what Rhino Horn is?

2320
02:14:18,781 --> 02:14:22,410
Its hair. You're eating hair?
Yeah. That horn his hair.

2321
02:14:22,620 --> 02:14:27,480
It's thickly knotted hair that grows into
a point. Yeah. It's not like an antler,

2322
02:14:27,481 --> 02:14:28,710
like this deer antler here.

2323
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:32,100
This antler falls off every year
and you find them on the ground.

2324
02:14:32,101 --> 02:14:36,210
They're called sheds and they grow
every year and then you know, they,

2325
02:14:36,211 --> 02:14:39,750
they butt heads with those
things on that side bar. Well,

2326
02:14:39,780 --> 02:14:42,570
that's not the case of the Rhino
with a rhino. It's actually hair.

2327
02:14:43,020 --> 02:14:45,900
It's like the same thing to fingernails.
It may not. It's like Keratin.

2328
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:50,550
It's kind of crazy shit man. But the, the
idea that anybody would pay to do that,

2329
02:14:50,551 --> 02:14:54,960
like don't do it man. Don't fucking
kill rhinos. These aren't in the,

2330
02:14:55,110 --> 02:14:58,320
like there's been an argument
against killing elephants, but,

2331
02:14:58,460 --> 02:15:02,550
and there's certain areas of Africa where
they have an overpopulation issue with

2332
02:15:02,551 --> 02:15:05,430
elephants and they've taken
to assassinating elephants.

2333
02:15:05,580 --> 02:15:06,540
They've taken a hunting though.

2334
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:10,050
It's really freaky because
they're bringing in hunters
and it was a TV show on

2335
02:15:10,051 --> 02:15:13,810
the other night where this guy went to
Africa and just snuck up on an elephant

2336
02:15:13,811 --> 02:15:17,610
and shot it in the fucking head. And it
doesn't seem right. It seems fucked up.

2337
02:15:17,730 --> 02:15:20,800
Did you ever play with every bulls?
No. No. Never played it. Right.

2338
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:23,970
The gave the food to the villagers
and they were saying this though, uh,

2339
02:15:23,971 --> 02:15:28,170
years food. Cool. So yeah, I guess,
but there's something about elephants.

2340
02:15:28,171 --> 02:15:32,790
It freaks me out. It freaks me out.
They kill elephants. Wales. Yeah. To me,

2341
02:15:32,791 --> 02:15:34,020
elephants are smart as shit.

2342
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:36,900
They recognize each other when they
haven't seen each other in 20 years.

2343
02:15:37,710 --> 02:15:42,030
Did you know that? Really? Yup. That's
the whole memory thing then. Yes.

2344
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:44,820
Yes. Will they have really
good minds. Their minds are.

2345
02:15:44,821 --> 02:15:47,700
They're much more complex than we
ever thought they gonna. In fact,

2346
02:15:47,701 --> 02:15:48,534
they can create art.

2347
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:51,660
You can teach an elephant to use a
paintbrush and they can draw themselves.

2348
02:15:51,690 --> 02:15:54,480
Really? You never seen that? Oh
my God, wait, do you see this?

2349
02:15:54,720 --> 02:15:56,430
I'm going to show you something. You
know what? I'm going to believe a thrill.

2350
02:15:56,640 --> 02:16:00,780
It's an elephant painting himself and
when you see it and how good it is,

2351
02:16:00,930 --> 02:16:04,380
it's like what my five year old would do.
It's like a five year old human,

2352
02:16:04,620 --> 02:16:07,770
I don't know if that
represents like the same,

2353
02:16:08,150 --> 02:16:12,540
if that's the same intelligence is
like a small child, but God damn it,

2354
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:16,140
it seems like there's something really
serious going on behind the scenes there.

2355
02:16:16,890 --> 02:16:21,510
They're able to draw themselves.
Dot Merera they're able to self portrait.

2356
02:16:21,660 --> 02:16:24,030
Pull ahead because there's a
long ass video, but look at this.

2357
02:16:24,180 --> 02:16:27,510
He's using his and you would think,
okay, this is bullshit. This is fake. No,

2358
02:16:27,690 --> 02:16:28,590
he really is.

2359
02:16:28,830 --> 02:16:33,700
He's his own trunk and he's
trying to draw what he sees.

2360
02:16:34,720 --> 02:16:38,080
Look at, he's drawing tusks. Dom
Arrera. He's drawing the legs.

2361
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:41,830
It's like perfect and like how he got
it perfect, but like fucking incredible.

2362
02:16:41,860 --> 02:16:45,040
Incredible. That's an intelligent
animal and in my opinion,

2363
02:16:45,041 --> 02:16:49,870
hunting that animal should be,
Aye. Look how good that is.

2364
02:16:49,871 --> 02:16:54,820
God dammit. And saying that should be the
last resort for real. Yes. It's for real.

2365
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:55,420
Like Shit.

2366
02:16:55,420 --> 02:16:59,560
It should be the last resort when it
comes to preserving these animals.

2367
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:01,660
That's ridiculous.

2368
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:06,800
What they should do is figure out a way
to either move them to areas where there

2369
02:17:06,801 --> 02:17:11,801
are populations have drastically decreased
or find some way to give them some

2370
02:17:12,101 --> 02:17:15,820
food that makes them less
likely to get pregnant. I mean,

2371
02:17:15,821 --> 02:17:18,310
who knows what strategies
they could come up with,

2372
02:17:18,311 --> 02:17:20,980
but shooting them seems really sad to me.

2373
02:17:21,750 --> 02:17:22,100
Okay.

2374
02:17:22,100 --> 02:17:25,800
Yeah. That's amazing. That's super smart.
And that's smarter than a wolf. Okay.

2375
02:17:25,980 --> 02:17:27,310
That's unbelievable.
Yeah.

2376
02:17:27,570 --> 02:17:30,240
I mean that's the argument against
killing wolves is that they're smart and

2377
02:17:30,241 --> 02:17:32,150
they're very much like dogs and you know,

2378
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:36,750
but that's way smarter than a fucking
both. That's smarter than a monkey man.

2379
02:17:36,751 --> 02:17:40,920
That's smart as shit. How smarter these
God damn things. Okay, cool. Yeah,

2380
02:17:40,921 --> 02:17:44,250
it's interesting to watch you do it.
This is not bullshit. Look them. Do it.

2381
02:17:44,370 --> 02:17:49,290
See now you can see the actual
full elephant. Look at this.

2382
02:17:49,320 --> 02:17:51,570
I mean this is utterly incredible.

2383
02:17:54,460 --> 02:17:55,420
Utterly incredible.

2384
02:17:55,600 --> 02:17:58,940
Eight every in a bag.
It,

2385
02:18:00,130 --> 02:18:04,110
it's amazing. Wow. Yeah. I Dunno man.

2386
02:18:04,440 --> 02:18:09,000
Then the relationship with
the relationship between
you're going to die. Nope.

2387
02:18:09,240 --> 02:18:13,930
The relationship that we have between
other animals is a very strained one.

2388
02:18:14,100 --> 02:18:16,470
It's very strange how we,

2389
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:20,790
because we have some animals that we
use for food and some animals that we

2390
02:18:20,791 --> 02:18:25,050
decide to use as a resource and you
know, it's, it's all very cruel.

2391
02:18:25,290 --> 02:18:26,970
I don't understand the rationalization.

2392
02:18:26,971 --> 02:18:29,730
Sometime between with
animals you picked to kill,

2393
02:18:29,850 --> 02:18:33,330
to eat in the sense that
people are pescatarians.

2394
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:36,430
What makes them think fish
are happy to be on a hook and,

2395
02:18:36,450 --> 02:18:38,580
well the idea is that fish
don't take care of their young.

2396
02:18:39,610 --> 02:18:40,100
Okay.

2397
02:18:40,100 --> 02:18:43,100
Dov or dolphins swim fish. Yeah.
Fish don't take care of the young.

2398
02:18:43,101 --> 02:18:45,500
So they're like, fuck these fish.
Look how good that is tomorrow.

2399
02:18:45,910 --> 02:18:50,570
He true fucking flowers in his, in his
trunk. Oh, it's insane. It's insane.

2400
02:18:51,050 --> 02:18:55,040
It's insane. How, how talented
this elephant as a drawing. I mean,

2401
02:18:55,041 --> 02:18:57,840
that's better than most people
could probably draw now.
I think if you kill that,

2402
02:18:57,850 --> 02:19:01,970
that that's murder. Yup. Look at this.
Look at this thing. Painting the sky, man.

2403
02:19:02,320 --> 02:19:04,730
Are you fucking shitting me?
It's painting a word.

2404
02:19:05,990 --> 02:19:06,800
Yeah.

2405
02:19:06,800 --> 02:19:11,460
Jesus Christ. This is the sad, so
sad. It's just sad. I Dunno. Youtube.

2406
02:19:11,690 --> 02:19:14,870
It's under a, if you guys want to see
it, it's under elephant's painting.

2407
02:19:14,900 --> 02:19:17,840
Elephants suit. That's the,
remember the name of him.

2408
02:19:17,841 --> 02:19:20,990
He was writing his name and he
knows how to write his name. I mean,

2409
02:19:20,991 --> 02:19:23,630
this is insanity. Do you kill
that thing? That's murder.

2410
02:19:25,150 --> 02:19:27,740
That's like a big giant person. Or
sometimes it's just, it doesn't,

2411
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:30,260
that doesn't make any sense to me.
Whatever that is.

2412
02:19:30,261 --> 02:19:32,630
It doesn't make any sense to
me. Mindblowing. Mindblowing.

2413
02:19:33,410 --> 02:19:38,390
Unbelievably fascinating. But to
those villagers, one years food,

2414
02:19:39,230 --> 02:19:42,510
we just eat [inaudible]. I mean,
I can't fucking believe that.

2415
02:19:43,250 --> 02:19:44,780
It's hard to believe.
Yeah.

2416
02:19:45,380 --> 02:19:48,440
I think if I walk out of here
and I hear you guys laughing, no

2417
02:19:50,050 --> 02:19:53,780
intelligent animals, intelligent
animals are, uh, am I, in my opinion,

2418
02:19:53,781 --> 02:19:56,330
we should treat them very differently
than we treat everything else. Well,

2419
02:19:56,331 --> 02:19:58,340
I never believed that
animals couldn't think.

2420
02:19:58,670 --> 02:20:01,640
I always believe they always sit in with
dogs. Don't think it's just instinct.

2421
02:20:01,670 --> 02:20:03,890
I don't buy that. No
animals. Fucking thank man.

2422
02:20:04,220 --> 02:20:06,350
Of course they think they just
don't think as well as we do.

2423
02:20:06,380 --> 02:20:09,590
So we like to say they don't think they're
just, they're limited. I mean their,

2424
02:20:09,591 --> 02:20:13,160
their, their bodies are about survival
and breeding survival and breeding.

2425
02:20:13,161 --> 02:20:15,400
And those are the only things they
don't create culture. You know,

2426
02:20:15,460 --> 02:20:18,380
we become ultra complex because
we create culture and we,

2427
02:20:18,381 --> 02:20:20,930
because we have the ability
to manipulate our environment.

2428
02:20:21,140 --> 02:20:24,650
So that's why we categorize dolphins in
this weird gray area that allows us to

2429
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:28,250
enslave them because they can't create
culture and because they can't manipulate

2430
02:20:28,251 --> 02:20:29,510
their environment,
they don't have fingers,

2431
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:32,840
we don't see any evidence of
their intelligence. But meanwhile,

2432
02:20:32,841 --> 02:20:36,020
there's tons of scientific evidence of
the fact that they can communicate with

2433
02:20:36,021 --> 02:20:40,850
each other, that they have a language lab
ILX that they have family communities,

2434
02:20:40,851 --> 02:20:45,530
that they recognize each other long
distances that they pulled together.

2435
02:20:45,980 --> 02:20:49,390
I mean it's, it's an, it's an intelligent
thing that you're in slaving. It's all,

2436
02:20:49,410 --> 02:20:53,330
it is. It's, there's no if, ands, or
buts about it. It's a bad argument.

2437
02:20:53,360 --> 02:20:55,190
Whether it's an Orca,
you know,

2438
02:20:55,191 --> 02:20:57,700
orchids are fucking even
smarter than dolphins there.

2439
02:20:57,701 --> 02:21:02,000
There's super intelligent animals.
It's madness. It's madness,

2440
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:02,990
it's total madness.

2441
02:21:03,290 --> 02:21:07,520
And when you see an elephant that can
paint a fucking picture better than most

2442
02:21:07,521 --> 02:21:12,140
of us in this room, what does that, that
that elephant paints better than you?

2443
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:15,320
That's the most phenomenal thing I've
ever seen an animal do. It's incredible.

2444
02:21:15,350 --> 02:21:17,540
It's incredible. Have you ever
seen chimps spelled her name?

2445
02:21:17,570 --> 02:21:19,490
Chimps can spell their
name. Uh, for candy.

2446
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:24,080
They teach them how to solve complex
puzzles and they give them candy and then

2447
02:21:24,081 --> 02:21:28,010
they can remember the order of files.
They can count things from one to seven,

2448
02:21:28,011 --> 02:21:30,770
one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven. And they, they, you know,

2449
02:21:30,771 --> 02:21:34,070
like the images will go blank and
they'll remember which one was one,

2450
02:21:34,071 --> 02:21:37,580
which one was two. And we'll
reveal like each and development,

2451
02:21:37,610 --> 02:21:41,300
make it flip over in order. Something
that I would struggle with. Sure. Yeah.

2452
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:45,500
He's locking up chimps is conti to
putting them in a zoo is stupid.

2453
02:21:46,010 --> 02:21:49,070
They should have them in an area where
they live in the wild and observe them.

2454
02:21:49,100 --> 02:21:49,933
That's it.

2455
02:21:50,270 --> 02:21:53,600
All this other stupid shit where even
if they make enough wild that it seems

2456
02:21:53,601 --> 02:21:57,170
wild to them. Yeah. Maybe if
you have a really large place,

2457
02:21:57,470 --> 02:22:01,220
but like that lady in Connecticut that
was living with one and the one they

2458
02:22:01,221 --> 02:22:06,050
wound up biting her friend's face off,
that is criminal negligence.

2459
02:22:06,350 --> 02:22:09,080
I mean that's no different than building
bombs in your yard and your friend

2460
02:22:09,081 --> 02:22:11,990
comes over and you're below your
friend's face off was so fucking Straw.

2461
02:22:12,400 --> 02:22:14,900
Just not just strong, but
violent as fuck. And guess what?

2462
02:22:14,901 --> 02:22:18,260
She gave the chimp Xanax. Really? Yeah.

2463
02:22:18,261 --> 02:22:22,820
She gave the chimps Xanax and
wine bitch was crazy. Well,

2464
02:22:22,821 --> 02:22:27,690
she had this 200 pound murderous monster
living in her house is yoked up super

2465
02:22:27,691 --> 02:22:32,280
monster. He was in the, he was in a
cage. Right? It's where a diaper. Yeah.

2466
02:22:32,550 --> 02:22:33,750
I don't think he was in a cage.
Oh,

2467
02:22:33,751 --> 02:22:37,070
I thought he was in a cage when he reached
out from her. No, no, no, no, no, no. He,

2468
02:22:37,080 --> 02:22:39,930
he lived in, uh, he, he wanted
around and do whatever you want it,

2469
02:22:40,170 --> 02:22:43,850
but the woman was babysitting
them. No. What happened was the,

2470
02:22:43,860 --> 02:22:47,430
a woman's friend came over.
A woman's friend came over.

2471
02:22:47,431 --> 02:22:51,270
The chimp did not like the woman's friend.
The woman's friend kept him from her.

2472
02:22:51,271 --> 02:22:53,310
Maybe.
Maybe he thought of her as his girlfriend.

2473
02:22:53,700 --> 02:22:56,670
So he just attacked and just
ripped her apart. Holy Shit.

2474
02:22:56,700 --> 02:22:59,140
Look at the muscles on this fucking
things. Are you kidding me? Man?

2475
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,470
That looks like who some are Paul Harris,
but even more muscular.

2476
02:23:04,530 --> 02:23:08,010
He's definitely on it. I could see him
using kettle bells and battle ropes.

2477
02:23:08,660 --> 02:23:10,530
Zombie ones.
Chimps gives zero fucks.

2478
02:23:10,950 --> 02:23:13,350
That's one of the scariest animals in
the world. If it's trying to get you,

2479
02:23:13,770 --> 02:23:15,390
because if they got ahold of you,

2480
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:19,170
like you might be able to even fight
off a bear to the point where the bear

2481
02:23:19,171 --> 02:23:20,730
decides like, you're too crazy. Fuck it.

2482
02:23:20,731 --> 02:23:23,490
I'll leave them alone if the bear
wasn't hungry, if it's a nutty bear,

2483
02:23:23,880 --> 02:23:26,870
but a chimp is not going to let you win,
you know they're,

2484
02:23:26,871 --> 02:23:30,210
they're having a contest with you and
they're going to bite your fingers off.

2485
02:23:30,390 --> 02:23:32,760
They're going to beat you census,
they're going to pull your genitals off.

2486
02:23:32,761 --> 02:23:34,750
They'll pull your pants
off and bite your ass hole.

2487
02:23:34,850 --> 02:23:38,220
It's like they know how to hurt you.
They're smart.

2488
02:23:38,970 --> 02:23:42,160
I think it would be one of the most
terrifying animals have to face in an

2489
02:23:42,161 --> 02:23:43,670
encounter.
Yeah.

2490
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:47,040
I'd probably take my chances with
like something like a shark before it

2491
02:23:47,041 --> 02:23:50,730
champions. People have lived, I mean,
people live in chimpanzee fights too,

2492
02:23:50,760 --> 02:23:53,760
but they get ripped apart.
Sometimes people they get rescued.

2493
02:23:53,761 --> 02:23:57,030
It's usually in preserves that all
this stuff happens too, by the way,

2494
02:23:57,270 --> 02:24:00,150
in the wild. It's very rare that
a chimpanzee attacks a person,

2495
02:24:00,450 --> 02:24:03,570
but did you see that picture that I had
on Twitter the other day of a Jaguar

2496
02:24:03,571 --> 02:24:05,850
that had got killed with his bare hands?
This is,

2497
02:24:05,851 --> 02:24:07,800
we don't make men like this anymore.
[inaudible].

2498
02:24:08,070 --> 02:24:12,180
It's an old black and white
Joda motherfucker killed
a Jaguar with his hands.

2499
02:24:12,181 --> 02:24:17,160
Bare hands. It says it's on my Twitter
page. It's just I think yesterday. Yeah.

2500
02:24:17,161 --> 02:24:20,250
Look at this motherfucker,
Carl eight glee. I salute you.

2501
02:24:20,251 --> 02:24:23,520
You fucking savage of a man.
You real man.

2502
02:24:23,521 --> 02:24:27,390
You make me feel weak as a bitch.
Look at that. God Damn savage,

2503
02:24:27,540 --> 02:24:31,860
he killed a leopard with his hands.
That's how you know.

2504
02:24:32,220 --> 02:24:35,310
That's how you know you can hold up
under pressure when you're duking it out

2505
02:24:35,311 --> 02:24:38,550
with a cat. That's a big cat
too. It's not a big leopard.

2506
02:24:38,910 --> 02:24:43,400
What do you think that
weighs? 20 yeah. No,

2507
02:24:43,440 --> 02:24:48,420
that's not that heavy. That's
like 70 pounds. 60 70 pounds.

2508
02:24:48,610 --> 02:24:51,600
The neck or you see how, look at,
look at it compared to his body. No,

2509
02:24:51,601 --> 02:24:53,790
it doesn't say how he did it.
At least I didn't read it.

2510
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:57,300
Look at it in relationship to his body.
You know it's, it's a perspective thing.

2511
02:24:57,301 --> 02:25:00,420
If you brought the head all
the way down to the ground,

2512
02:25:00,450 --> 02:25:04,500
the head is a suspended about where his
knee is. It's hanging by its back feet.

2513
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:08,030
If you brought the head all the way to
the ground, it really wouldn't even be as,

2514
02:25:08,130 --> 02:25:12,440
as long as his, uh, his most of his upper
body. Why was he even engaged with you?

2515
02:25:12,441 --> 02:25:15,840
And it must've his lower body, right. Did
he come after him? He had attacked him.

2516
02:25:15,940 --> 02:25:17,910
Oh, jumped him. Try to eat them.

2517
02:25:18,480 --> 02:25:23,130
People had been selling ever since I been
putting up pictures from trail cameras,

2518
02:25:23,380 --> 02:25:26,740
people have been sending me trail camera
photos of mountain lions that they

2519
02:25:26,741 --> 02:25:30,010
catch in their yards or mountain lions
that they catch near their house.

2520
02:25:30,040 --> 02:25:34,930
A guy sent me one today from Florida
of these two fucking muscular Florida

2521
02:25:34,931 --> 02:25:39,460
panthers. You know, I've never seen a
panther. Never seen a mountain lion. No.

2522
02:25:39,461 --> 02:25:41,710
I've seen my online, but I've never
seen a panther the same animal.

2523
02:25:42,550 --> 02:25:45,190
It's a smaller though,
isn't it? Um, maybe,

2524
02:25:45,191 --> 02:25:48,060
maybe it doesn't get into food or maybe
I was in the keys a couple of weeks ago

2525
02:25:48,061 --> 02:25:49,930
when we were talking about that,
cause they have the signs up.

2526
02:25:50,440 --> 02:25:54,370
It'd be aware of them, you know? Well,
like most fucked up things in Florida,

2527
02:25:54,371 --> 02:25:55,540
the population is growing.

2528
02:25:55,780 --> 02:25:58,600
The population of fucked up
people in Florida is growing.

2529
02:25:58,601 --> 02:26:00,760
The population of fucked
up cats is growing.

2530
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:04,600
The population of alligators is growing.
Population of bath salts,

2531
02:26:05,080 --> 02:26:07,850
abusers is growing. Foreign
is fucking crazy. And Don,

2532
02:26:07,851 --> 02:26:09,260
my ray was going to be
there this weekend lady.

2533
02:26:09,470 --> 02:26:13,720
That can segue now that's a segue.
I want to put that in my driveway.

2534
02:26:13,750 --> 02:26:16,270
Just scared to go to people. He, Brian,

2535
02:26:16,271 --> 02:26:20,020
can we set up a Gopro on the Werewolf
please? We do that. Let's figure that out.

2536
02:26:20,050 --> 02:26:23,790
That's your next project that is fucking
tearing apart from the Werewolf drop

2537
02:26:23,791 --> 02:26:26,740
found every time I walk in here though
is do you see a picture of Eddie Bravo,

2538
02:26:26,741 --> 02:26:29,770
Eddie Bravo radio. Use The podcast
studio the other night. Powerful.

2539
02:26:29,771 --> 02:26:31,060
Jamie stepped in and saved the day.

2540
02:26:31,420 --> 02:26:35,020
He Bravo's computer crashed and Eddie
called me up like last minute and he's

2541
02:26:35,021 --> 02:26:38,530
like, dude, I'm fucked. Like the
podcast is in a half an hour, you know,

2542
02:26:38,531 --> 02:26:42,970
and my computer's crashed and I didn't.
So he came over and use this place. Um,

2543
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:46,780
but when he did, he took all his
clothes off and took a photo of him.

2544
02:26:46,781 --> 02:26:50,920
Fucking the Werewolf pull
that shit up is Eddie Bravo.

2545
02:26:50,980 --> 02:26:55,150
He will commit to things in a
way that very few people can.

2546
02:26:55,510 --> 02:26:58,320
I'd love this fucking
dude. He's so crazy. This,

2547
02:26:58,390 --> 02:27:02,770
this is a total Eddie Bravo picture
that he would send you like this, uh,

2548
02:27:03,370 --> 02:27:07,840
epitomizes why I love this dude is one
of the reasons why he got a job as a

2549
02:27:07,841 --> 02:27:09,070
writer on the man show.

2550
02:27:09,250 --> 02:27:12,730
And he probably has crazy lucky
look at least committing to it.

2551
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:15,730
He screamed at the top of his lungs,

2552
02:27:15,731 --> 02:27:19,420
all of his clothes are off and he's
banging the Werewolf from behind.

2553
02:27:19,510 --> 02:27:21,670
It would have been a little bit better
if he had like a little bit more of an

2554
02:27:21,671 --> 02:27:24,520
angle so we could actually see his
ass cheeks. So we know he's really,

2555
02:27:24,521 --> 02:27:28,300
really naked. He's so crazy
though. Look at him. He's so silly.

2556
02:27:31,580 --> 02:27:36,370
I love that too. Powerful.
Eddie Bravo. So, uh, yeah,

2557
02:27:36,371 --> 02:27:38,950
we're going to let other people
do it too. So you know, any,

2558
02:27:38,951 --> 02:27:40,450
all of our friends who do podcasts,

2559
02:27:40,451 --> 02:27:43,150
I know Tommy wanted to use it at one
point in time and Dunkin's going to use it

2560
02:27:43,151 --> 02:27:46,420
like whenever they need to do shit
on with cameras and what have you.

2561
02:27:46,930 --> 02:27:49,750
I think it makes this place
more the merrier. The more, uh,

2562
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:52,450
I feel like the more good
conversations we have in this place,

2563
02:27:52,660 --> 02:27:55,220
I feel like it's soaks into the
wall. So it's good in a jail. Yeah.

2564
02:27:55,390 --> 02:27:58,120
I love this fucking place. When I
come here, I feel like I'm at home.

2565
02:27:58,450 --> 02:28:02,050
I feel like this is our, uh, our
weird little, oh, it's very cool.

2566
02:28:02,080 --> 02:28:06,460
Portal to the rest of the world. I
like to lift factory the, you know,

2567
02:28:06,550 --> 02:28:09,830
but just for the comfort of being on the
stage, I'm comfortable. Well, that's a,

2568
02:28:09,860 --> 02:28:13,710
also a stage. He performed that for
like two and a half decades. Right.

2569
02:28:13,810 --> 02:28:17,920
That's a great place. So yes, since
the late eighties. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

2570
02:28:17,921 --> 02:28:22,100
That's even more, right. What does
that 46, 40. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

2571
02:28:22,630 --> 02:28:24,800
Yeah. 46. 2014. Oh,

2572
02:28:26,990 --> 02:28:30,920
26 rather. Yeah. Yeah. I say you
are. I'm 46. That's what I meant. Uh,

2573
02:28:30,921 --> 02:28:35,170
I graduated in 85. I was 21,
so it's probably at the lift.

2574
02:28:35,180 --> 02:28:39,230
I was 89 and 90 doing half talking
and half a adding my age on there.

2575
02:28:39,231 --> 02:28:43,730
So what year I was,
um, in 86 I was not 21.

2576
02:28:43,731 --> 02:28:48,330
I was 21 in 88. Joe, wait, here we
do a full photo. Come to comedy will,

2577
02:28:48,480 --> 02:28:51,140
I mean I can't do math when
you're talking to me. Oh, sorry.

2578
02:28:51,530 --> 02:28:54,200
It's still complicated. Full
frontal comedy. 93 I think.

2579
02:28:54,840 --> 02:28:59,180
Did we the one in um,
Montreal? No, no, that was uh,

2580
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:03,710
uh Oh that was dangerous zone. That was
also a showtime, right? Yeah, I think so.

2581
02:29:03,770 --> 02:29:05,030
I think it must have been 94 then.

2582
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:10,520
That's when don my railroad and I
became pool playing partners. Wow. Oh,

2583
02:29:10,521 --> 02:29:13,460
we met in Amsterdam billiards.
So we first found out that we both,

2584
02:29:13,490 --> 02:29:18,260
we each played pool. It's right. Total
luck by chance. I was in town doing a Gig.

2585
02:29:18,261 --> 02:29:21,050
Don was doing a Gig and we went up by
knocking some balls around together and I

2586
02:29:21,051 --> 02:29:23,240
said, you got a good stroke
there, Mr Right Herrera,

2587
02:29:23,270 --> 02:29:27,650
you got them out of bed and play
pretty good fella for a comedian.

2588
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:32,390
The all Comedians Pool League is a U.
R e should fear,

2589
02:29:32,630 --> 02:29:36,360
um, me. Um, uh, uh,

2590
02:29:36,510 --> 02:29:40,790
what's his name from Adam for our please.
Very good. And please very consignments.

2591
02:29:40,820 --> 02:29:43,010
Greg Fitzsimmons please. Very
good. There you go. That's good.

2592
02:29:43,011 --> 02:29:45,020
And what I was trying to
think of as Craig Anthony,

2593
02:29:45,500 --> 02:29:50,190
Craig Anthony from the
movies are Anthony, uh, shit.

2594
02:29:50,200 --> 02:29:54,470
Mike Robinson. Kay Robinson. Craig
Anthony. Who's Craig Anthony? Uh,

2595
02:29:54,500 --> 02:29:57,890
the guy from breakfast. Someone's
Craig Anthony. Why do I know that name?

2596
02:29:57,891 --> 02:30:00,200
Craig Robinson from, yeah, he's
cranky and seeing a fighter.

2597
02:30:00,700 --> 02:30:03,950
I didn't drink Robinson. Craig Robinson
from this is the end. Did you see that?

2598
02:30:03,951 --> 02:30:05,120
They just see him and this is the end.

2599
02:30:05,180 --> 02:30:08,740
That's the little bit of smoothies on the
office, right? James Franco? Yeah. Yeah.

2600
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:12,090
Good guy. He's a poet. Craig. Anthony,
you're thinking of a post that's where is,

2601
02:30:12,830 --> 02:30:16,100
yeah, Craig Robinson. Sorry,
Craig. Craig is hilarious. He's,

2602
02:30:16,130 --> 02:30:17,510
and he's a really good pool player too.

2603
02:30:17,511 --> 02:30:20,900
Apparently Vinny fat Burrito can
play too. Yeah. Yeah. Allegedly.

2604
02:30:20,990 --> 02:30:23,630
I've never seen him, but I've heard he
plays really good. Tried to hustle me.

2605
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:28,060
Oh too slick. No Way. Oh,
I got a helical tussle.

2606
02:30:28,061 --> 02:30:30,620
Dama rare fucking happen.
You don't have a gambling issue.

2607
02:30:30,621 --> 02:30:34,940
Do I love to gamble but I don't gamble
much money. I love gambling on football.

2608
02:30:35,120 --> 02:30:37,580
Yeah, it's fun. The juice of it is,

2609
02:30:37,581 --> 02:30:42,581
is a riot just gabbing a little spark to
the game and I'm talking like 50 bucks

2610
02:30:42,741 --> 02:30:46,820
and nothing that I think that should
be legal man. Oh, it's so stupid.

2611
02:30:46,821 --> 02:30:50,690
Bums me out that that's not, I feel like
you should be able to bet at any corner.

2612
02:30:51,050 --> 02:30:54,890
You know, there should be some sort
of a way that you could, uh, you know,

2613
02:30:55,040 --> 02:30:59,810
like fucking regulate how it
gets taxed or it, you know,

2614
02:30:59,811 --> 02:31:01,910
where we can all meet
and gamble on things.

2615
02:31:01,911 --> 02:31:03,470
We should be able to
bet against each other.

2616
02:31:03,500 --> 02:31:07,070
We should be able to put our money jointly
into something and it gets deposited

2617
02:31:07,071 --> 02:31:08,330
into either one of our accounts.

2618
02:31:08,331 --> 02:31:10,970
If we win and the government takes a
little piece off the top to make sure it

2619
02:31:10,971 --> 02:31:13,220
gets taxed and that's it.
Let people gamble.

2620
02:31:13,250 --> 02:31:17,390
You go to any police station and the
have football pools. Yeah. Why not?

2621
02:31:17,450 --> 02:31:19,040
What's wrong with that
and not say nothing.

2622
02:31:19,140 --> 02:31:21,750
They shouldn't get in trouble for
that either. It's fucking ridiculous.

2623
02:31:25,240 --> 02:31:29,140
I'm telling him, uh, Brian Dunning that
I'm doing a podcast. What was he? I now,

2624
02:31:29,230 --> 02:31:33,960
yeah. Anyway, that's it.
Dot. Merera that's it.

time pal. I know. I love that.

2627
02:31:40,991 --> 02:31:43,690
It's a great history. Yeah, it's been
a lot of fun. If I had some good times,

2628
02:31:44,170 --> 02:31:45,730
I could be in it for you.
I know you do,

2629
02:31:45,731 --> 02:31:48,770
but that's because you're
on Xanax and I'm, I'm,

2630
02:31:49,190 --> 02:31:54,160
I wouldn't even fight back cause
I'm on pot. I love you buddy.
