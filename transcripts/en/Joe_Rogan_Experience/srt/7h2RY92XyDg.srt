00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,830
Hello Freak bitches.
There's nothing reason to going on right

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,000
here.
There's no reasonable consideration of

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,480
the pros and cons of this issue.
And no one's,

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:14,050
there's no one's stepping in the middle,
right?

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:18,220
It's like the FBI and apple dispute.
That's what it's like.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,620
It's the same thing.
You got it all on one side.

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,870
You've got all on the other.
And the reality is,

8
00:00:22,871 --> 00:00:24,760
you know what,
we could have found a solution here

9
00:00:24,761 --> 00:00:26,360
somewhere if,
uh,

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,600
you know,
if,

11
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,120
if,
if we'd been added on,

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,120
I,
although who knows,

13
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,420
I don't know.
Apple seems to be inclined to draw a

14
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:35,370
line under this protection

15
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,240
killer issue.
Issue is they're trying to get into that

16
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:40,880
guy's phone.
The killer who killed those people in

17
00:00:40,881 --> 00:00:43,820
San Bernandino.
They want to get into his phone and uh,

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,720
the FBI wants apple to engineer some
sort of a back door.

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,531
Well,
here's,

20
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:50,150
here's what it is.
So this guy,

21
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,860
uh,
side for had,

22
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:53,330
he had,
uh,

23
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:54,770
three phones,
at least that we know about,

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,890
two of them,
he destroyed.

25
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:57,330
He completely destroyed him.
And,

26
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:57,991
and the,
the,

27
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,770
the bureau's been looking,
they did nothing recoverable off those

28
00:01:00,771 --> 00:01:02,540
systems.
And they've asked a lot of people for

29
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,480
assistance.
So they had the other phone,

30
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:06,410
which was in his truck,
which is his work phone.

31
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:10,250
It was belonged to the county.
And so they went to the county bureau,

32
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:14,120
did they went to the county when they
pulled his phone out of the truck and

33
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:17,810
they said,
we need to get the information off of

34
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:18,980
this thing because you know what,
a phone,

35
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,900
a phone nowadays everybody keeps
everything on their phone.

36
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,030
Right.
And so they uh,

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,480
they got the support they pulled and
they found out that he had shut off the

38
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:29,510
function that a uploads data to the
cloud,

39
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,160
uh,
in October.

40
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,430
And so they were able to get everything
up to October,

41
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:36,860
but then that's two full months prior to
the attack.

42
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,031
So they said,
okay,

43
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,900
well we can't get this and that.
And the,

44
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:41,270
the,
the phone has,

45
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,800
you know,
this default position where if you try

46
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:45,560
the password 10 times in a racist,
everything.

47
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,140
So they took the phone,
the bureau took the f,

48
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:51,290
the phone to apple and this was well
before they had to go and get a court

49
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:53,420
order.
Well before it became public knowledge,

50
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,110
they actually went and had numerous
quiet conversations with apple and they

51
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,450
went to apple and they said,
literally set,

52
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,540
you can take the phone,
keep it on your campus,

53
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:03,890
keep it in your facility,
put it,

54
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:04,520
no,
we don't.

55
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,200
You know,
wherever put in your lab,

56
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:11,060
all we're asking is for you to create a
systems information file that you can

57
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,140
force on that phone,
that one phone and pull the tech,

58
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,600
which then allows you to brute force the
password,

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,410
right?

60
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:22,070
And get the texts off of there,
get the data off of there and exists.

61
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,310
And then you can destroy the sif,
the systems information file.

62
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,430
You can keep the phone,
we don't even need to touch it.

63
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,210
We,
you know,

64
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,940
whatever you just give us the shit
that's on the phone.

65
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,420
An apple has,
has been helpful in the past.

66
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,330
They've been,
they've been helpful in the past and

67
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,520
this time for some,
for whatever motivation they've decided

68
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,260
to draw a line in the sand and say,
no,

69
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:49,130
we're not going to do this.
And it's not as if they haven't been

70
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:50,720
helpful.
And there's an ongoing dialogue.

71
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:53,720
And so it's,
it's disingenuous to say that apple is

72
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:54,620
now,
you know,

73
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,490
uh,
the bulwark for privacy because they

74
00:02:58,491 --> 00:03:00,700
have been in the past and they will
continue to be helpful,

75
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:03,370
I suppose in their own way.
But for this particular phone,

76
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,740
for this one time where they could have
held onto the phone,

77
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,300
created that Sif destroyed the sif at,
at that moment that they've pulled the

78
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,350
texts officer,
that's it.

79
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,620
That's done.
So now what Tim Cook is saying is not

80
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:17,200
that it's creating a backdoor.
He's not saying that he's saying it

81
00:03:17,201 --> 00:03:21,070
creates a precedent,
but the precedent was already that if

82
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:24,400
the bureau goes through the,
the,

83
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,440
the process the congress has set and
then goes through that process and gets

84
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:33,220
a court order and the court,
then it looks at it and says,

85
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,570
yes,
you've got probable cause you've got

86
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:36,670
reasonable concern here.
Uh,

87
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,330
they provide a court order,
then they go and they make this request

88
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,190
for assistance.
They're also talking about a dead guy

89
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:45,700
talking about a guy who shot 14 paper
was killed,

90
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,140
14 people.
Um,

91
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,870
I've heard all sorts of things.
I've heard people say to me,

92
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,010
and I,
and again,

93
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,150
I understand,
don't get me wrong,

94
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:56,050
because I understand fully the
importance of finding the right place on

95
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:58,660
the pendulum for Security and privacy.

96
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,100
I get that.
I get that.

97
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:02,080
And that's an important discussion.
I'm not saying it's not,

98
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:03,190
it's,
you should always have that

99
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:06,130
conversation,
but part of that is then during the

100
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,980
course of that conversation,
Congress,

101
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,110
the courts,
they make those decisions.

102
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:12,870
Where does that pendulum,
you know,

103
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,120
settle between security and privacy?
And that settles here.

104
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:16,720
Okay,
fine.

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,320
Then that's what the bureau or whomever
has to go through to get approval to get

106
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,750
some assistance.
And that's where it stands.

107
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,190
But you know,
to say that because now you've got all

108
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,840
three branches of government have said,
yeah,

109
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:32,440
we think that really we could use this
information off of this phone.

110
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,030
But I've heard everybody say,
well,

111
00:04:34,031 --> 00:04:35,920
why don't they just do the rest of the
investigation?

112
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,390
Well,
of course they fucking done the rest of

113
00:04:37,391 --> 00:04:39,820
the investigation.
They don't all the other investigative

114
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,010
steps.
So what are you're saying in a situation

115
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:42,844
like this?

116
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,620
Uh,
you just want them to do 80% of the

117
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:46,000
investigation.
And if you've got,

118
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:48,010
you know,
that you've got material on here who,

119
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,310
which may lead to operational activity,
uh,

120
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:52,810
in,
in finding other people who were

121
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:57,730
involved or finding people overseas who
were in somehow assisting or whatever it

122
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:59,050
may be.
If you're saying,

123
00:04:59,051 --> 00:04:59,711
well,
just know,

124
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:01,150
you know what,
for the sake of this,

125
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:04,060
we're not asking for a back door.
They're asking for that.

126
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,130
So that,
that one phone,

127
00:05:06,131 --> 00:05:09,340
and that's where this whole thing is
really headed south and it's become this

128
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,630
idea that,
you know,

129
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,330
which is erroneous.
But I understand what Tim Cook is saying

130
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:15,070
about the precedent,
although not really,

131
00:05:15,071 --> 00:05:16,660
because again,
they've done this before.

132
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,000
For some reason for this one,
they're drawing a line.

133
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,530
So anyway,
I,

134
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:22,360
but I've heard that,
why don't they just do the rest of the

135
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,220
investigation and skip this part?

136
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,280
What I don't,
I don't,

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,830
I don't follow that logic train.
And then the other people,

138
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,581
other people were saying,
well,

139
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,020
why don't they just get it off the
metadata?

140
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,380
And that's another one of those things
where people never believed what the

141
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,680
government was saying,
but the metal fucking data was numbers

142
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,450
and volume.
That was it.

143
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,040
There was no information to be had
there.

144
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,070
You could sit in a fucking room full of
metadata and not know what the hell

145
00:05:45,071 --> 00:05:47,080
you're looking at.
You had to go through the court process

146
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,910
to then get that particular numbers,
uh,

147
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,840
information.

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,230
So here's my question,
because this is what came up with the

149
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,850
Edward Snowden thing.
They were saying that the government is

150
00:05:54,851 --> 00:05:59,510
monitoring all cell phone data
constantly and they can get information

151
00:05:59,511 --> 00:05:59,961
all the time.
Well,

152
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:02,510
this kind of proves that not to be true.
Yeah.

153
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,980
But people don't look at it that way.
They don't,

154
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,280
they don't,
they don't make that leap back and say,

155
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,620
oh,
well maybe that was a fallacy.

156
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,160
Yeah,
sure.

157
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,310
The metadata was sweeping up all that,
that those numbers and volume.

158
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,010
But again,
it's not enough to what end.

159
00:06:16,011 --> 00:06:17,090
Yeah.
And so some people would say,

160
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:18,620
once they realize what it was actually
doing,

161
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:19,221
then they say,
wow,

162
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:22,160
but that's so what?
So they're just collecting this shit in

163
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:23,360
the basement.
It's not doing any good.

164
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:25,250
So they shouldn't even collect that
information.

165
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,900
So what Edward Snowden was talking about
is essentially just when it pertains to

166
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,370
email,
I mean,

167
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,930
he said they're collecting all this
information that the NSA is collecting

168
00:06:35,931 --> 00:06:38,900
all this information in regards to cell
phone data,

169
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,730
the recording,
every phone call,

170
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,560
the recording,
all these text messages.

171
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,430
Yeah.
Um,

172
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,620
so is that not true?
Well,

173
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,650
no,
I frankly,

174
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:47,350
I'm here.
Of course nobody's going to,

175
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,250
again,
this is a very emotive,

176
00:06:49,251 --> 00:06:50,420
right?
So there's all these people out there,

177
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,440
they're going to say,
fuck you.

178
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,610
You don't know what the fuck are you
talking about?

179
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:55,430
Yeah,
no,

180
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,420
there is nobody right now unless you're
a terrorist,

181
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,100
a terrorist suspect or a criminal.
This,

182
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,170
nobody in the government hooks up fuck
about you.

183
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,740
I'm here to tell you your Dick pics or
safe ladies and Gentlemen,

184
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,350
Dick Pics are absolutely safe.
Jina pictures that you've been floating

185
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:12,040
around telling your boyfriend or,
okay girls,

186
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:14,360
it's secure.
Nobody's going to route those around

187
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,880
that.
And are you out for those as a piece of

188
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:19,640
shit and UNAMERICAN in the first place?
Yeah.

189
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,160
So that's a,
that's a really eyeopening thing though

190
00:07:22,161 --> 00:07:25,310
because this case kind of throws that
all into jeopardy cause everybody was

191
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:26,360
like concerned.
Like,

192
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,700
Hey,
the government can check in on all your

193
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:32,840
phone calls and all your text messages.
Well this would clearly be a case where

194
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,520
they would want to do that so that they
don't,

195
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:38,900
if they can't do it here without the,
did the judge granting this order and

196
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,030
what,
so tell me why did,

197
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,060
there was a recent court order there
ruled in favor of apple.

198
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,990
They did.
And that was in New York and that was an

199
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:49,150
interesting case as well.
And that's probably going to set a

200
00:07:49,151 --> 00:07:52,780
precedent for maybe,
maybe we'll see cause it's a little bit

201
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:56,080
different what the judge essentially was
saying in that case and it involved,

202
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:56,510
uh,
uh,

203
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:57,400
uh,
uh,

204
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,920
narco trafficking investigation that was
going on.

205
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,190
And by the way,
this isn't just for terrorism.

206
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,200
Imagine what if this was for Pete
Ophelia,

207
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,210
I mean,
I imagine a large Pete Ophelia ring.

208
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,740
What are you going to say?
No,

209
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:12,100
we don't want to catch those fucking
Douche bags that are involved in that

210
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,770
because privacy,
you know,

211
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,460
I understand the privacy aspect,
but each case has to be looked at on its

212
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:20,800
merits.
And if you say through the courts and

213
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,750
through the,
through the congress that these are the

214
00:08:22,751 --> 00:08:25,570
hoops that the bureau has to jump
through and they jumped through those

215
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,340
hoops,
then then what?

216
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,920
Then it's up to each company to decide
where they want to support it or not.

217
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,210
I don't know that,
that seems strange.

218
00:08:31,211 --> 00:08:33,010
But anyway,
the point being is that the one in New

219
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,390
York,
the judge essentially was saying,

220
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,260
well look,
you want us,

221
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:38,470
you want the courts to make a decision
on this for something that Congress

222
00:08:38,471 --> 00:08:40,620
should really make a decision on this.
And so he,

223
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,750
in a way,
his decision was a pushback against the

224
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:45,060
concept of the,
that the,

225
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:46,930
uh,
the bureau was basing this on,

226
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:49,390
which is a very old law.
And so the judge is saying,

227
00:08:49,391 --> 00:08:52,030
look,
you're relying on a law that's a couple

228
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,280
of hundred years old or whatever.
Um,

229
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,990
maybe instead we should be having this
looked at it through the legislature.

230
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,810
And so there was a,
there was an interesting sort of

231
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,540
legality to his,
his response to this,

232
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,380
but it,
it definitely,

233
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,740
uh,
favorite apple and,

234
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,590
and,
and and sure.

235
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,000
That's great.
Let's legislate it.

236
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,450
But do you think that just maybe,
um,

237
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,740
there are times when from an operational
perspective,

238
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,370
you might want to move a little bit
quicker than asking Congress to take up,

239
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,280
uh,
an issue and debate it and then maybe

240
00:09:23,281 --> 00:09:25,490
eventually come up.
So maybe occasionally you're going to

241
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,250
have moments like this,
the San Bernardino shooting where you've

242
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:33,690
got a phone in your hand and all you're
asking apple to do is take possession of

243
00:09:33,691 --> 00:09:35,130
it.
And who knows?

244
00:09:35,131 --> 00:09:38,070
Maybe their problem is they're worried
that if they create the sif at that

245
00:09:38,071 --> 00:09:39,810
moment,
someone's going to steal it from them.

246
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,750
I met one of their employees,
so maybe they got an internal security

247
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,540
issue because then they can destroy it.
The bureau is not asking for that phone

248
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,010
back.
They're not asking for that Sif.

249
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,030
They're not asking them for to do it on
any other,

250
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:49,600
what is this?

251
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,990
Sif is a systems information file.
Okay.

252
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,380
So you just force it onto that phone and
that bypasses the capacity.

253
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:58,770
Essentially what the court has done is
made a very conservative,

254
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,880
conservative interpretation of the law.
Right.

255
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,910
And basically saying that this needs to
be,

256
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,930
this is a place with the courts should
be deciding,

257
00:10:06,931 --> 00:10:08,430
we believe you should be taking this to
Congress.

258
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:11,850
And so therefore I don't see why you're
legislating or asking us to make a

259
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,140
decision on this.
You see,

260
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:15,420
I understand the common person's
perspective.

261
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:19,290
They don't trust the government,
the whole Edward Snowden leaks thing.

262
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,380
Everybody's freaking out about that.
And then they look at this saying,

263
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:24,240
well,
this is the slippery slope.

264
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,790
Again,
this is the thing that if the government

265
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:30,930
has access to your phone,
like we're talking about a fucking mass

266
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:35,070
murderer and a guy who's already dead
and we have one phone.

267
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,941
Yeah,
yeah.

268
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:36,480
It's,
and,

269
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,480
and,
and so to say that you're going to only

270
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,210
do a limited investigation,
even though you know you've got

271
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:43,680
potential information,
right?

272
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,350
And your way to do it,
like on an individual basis,

273
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:48,630
just one phone only.
That's what they're asking for.

274
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,110
That's what they're asking.
But can it be that you could never grant

275
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,180
ag?
I mean it's,

276
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,810
it's,
it doesn't make any sense to me.

277
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,180
Well,
you wouldn't want to get access to that

278
00:10:57,181 --> 00:11:00,570
guy's fucking data.
And here's where I think going back to

279
00:11:00,571 --> 00:11:03,570
that overriding theme,
which is nothing resides in the center

280
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:04,920
anymore.
You're right.

281
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,660
We do have to be concerned about
privacy.

282
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:07,650
And I agree.
Okay,

283
00:11:07,651 --> 00:11:08,880
what happens if you don't?
Big Brother.

284
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,770
But there are times when,
you know,

285
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,830
operational concerns probably override
a,

286
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,940
at least an element of this where you
have common pr or a reason to,

287
00:11:19,301 --> 00:11:21,990
people can exist in the comment in the
middle and say,

288
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,430
yeah,
on this occasion,

289
00:11:23,431 --> 00:11:26,370
because you've gone through all these,
these orders and because we've set up

290
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:27,480
this protection now,
meaning,

291
00:11:27,481 --> 00:11:28,790
you know,
apple holds onto it and have it,

292
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,980
but you know,
it,

293
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:30,960
that's not the way it works.

294
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,310
And so therefore apple comes out and
says there,

295
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,780
and then the misinformation,
ah,

296
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,690
they're trying to create a backdoor to
our apple devices.

297
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,430
By the way,
what do you think apple does with their

298
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:42,090
devices that they sell in China?
Do you think the Chinese government

299
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:45,180
would allow apple if someone's got to
talk about this in the media,

300
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:48,270
do you think the Chinese government
would allow apple to sell devices that

301
00:11:48,271 --> 00:11:50,050
they can't get into?
I,

302
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,540
uh,
