1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:02,850
Five,
four,

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:04,230
three,
two,

3
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,420
one.
Dr.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,800
Rhonda,
Patrick.

5
00:00:07,801 --> 00:00:09,570
Hello.
Hello.

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,600
Welcome back.
You've got a big fat book of notes over 

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,471
there.
It's like it's something I use like 

8
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:24,411
before I'm giving a talk or something 
like that where I like to something 

9
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:29,391
about writing,
handwriting things like helps me 

10
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:29,391
remember.
Oh yeah,

11
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:33,920
this,
they've shown that I do that before 

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,721
shows.
If you looked at my notebook and you 

13
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:35,940
think if you ever thought that I like 
actually wrote in my notebook,

14
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:38,760
you'd think I'm a crazy person because 
I'm reading the same thing over and over

15
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:40,020
again.
Like all work.

16
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:44,430
No play makes jack a dull boy.
I just like before a set,

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,740
what I do is I just write out the key 
things that I wanted to work on and I'll

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,750
write them out over and over again.
So like I'll have 100 page notebook and 

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,230
it's like 100 pages of like half of it's
the same stuff over and over again.

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,270
I'm Kinda the same way.
Like I,

21
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:01,360
I'll write out things like that are in 
more detail and then like you said,

22
00:01:01,361 --> 00:01:03,960
all like righteous,
just like a cue,

23
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,060
like it's different when you're giving a
talk,

24
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:09,600
at least like in academia,
like a powerpoint talk you have to slide

25
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:12,140
and this slide cues like a couple of 
minutes of talk.

26
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:17,141
So you've got like,
it helps you remember what you're going 

27
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:17,350
to talk about.
Yeah,

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,350
that would help for comedy.
I bet.

29
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,290
Probably a good idea.
I should have a slide show,

30
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:27,630
you know,
like that would actually be a really 

31
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,811
good idea for like particular points 
where you could show that you weren't 

32
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,090
lying.
Like look this is a real thing.

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,400
You know,
you have like a reference there because 

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,750
there's a couple of things that I'm 
talking about in my new set where I have

35
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:41,751
to,
I have to reassure people that I'm not 

36
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:41,751
making this up because it's so 
ridiculous.

37
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:46,610
You know?
And I'm like one of them was this woman 

38
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,790
who proposed as a high school student.
She was a 25 year old police officers,

39
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,360
super attractive,
and she poses a high school student and 

40
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,900
convinced a young boy to sell her 
marijuana and then arrested him.

41
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,770
So it was just an experiment?
No,

42
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,150
it was a sting operation.
Wow.

43
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,550
And he was a regular kid.
He was an honor roll kid.

44
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,470
Oh my God.
Now he's a felon.

45
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,330
That is crazy.
Yeah,

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,420
there it is.
Teen falls in love with undercover cop 

47
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:14,970
and marijuana sting gets arrested.
Yeah.

48
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,360
So this is one of them.
I would love to be able to put that up 

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,720
and go see because you could.
I guess you could just make stuff up if 

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,590
you wanted to know what comedians do.
They make stuff.

51
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,350
I mean you can a lot,
but if you made something up like,

52
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:33,351
Hey,
there was a story in the news and just 

53
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:33,351
made it up.

54
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:33,351
That sounds crazy.
I guess it.

55
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:33,351
Who cares if it's funny.
You know,

56
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:35,210
people just come to laugh,
but yeah,

57
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:40,250
I guess you're right.
People like comedians usually make up 

58
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,620
personal stories.
Sometimes they say it's true and I'm 

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,710
like,
it's so outrageous is really true.

60
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:46,230
Like,
I don't know because it's just so funny,

61
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,880
you know,
like some of the stories that,

62
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,950
that some of these comedians tell when 
I'm just like,

63
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,260
how can this be true?
They said it was true,

64
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:54,330
but it's like,
are they my friend part of comedy?

65
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,090
Can you do that?
You definitely tell my friend Dom irrera

66
00:02:57,091 --> 00:02:59,200
has a really funny joke about that.
He goes,

67
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,160
he goes,
he's a true

68
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,580
story.
He goes,

69
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:05,581
hey,
how about you just make something up 

70
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:05,581
that's funny.
You know,

71
00:03:05,581 --> 00:03:06,240
like it doesn't have to be true buddy 
rich.

72
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:11,250
I can't say it's true.
So it's Kinda like messing with you 

73
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,341
because the whole time they're doing,
you're likely true because that's 

74
00:03:14,341 --> 00:03:16,120
fucking hilarious.
Sometimes it's true.

75
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,920
Sometimes it's not.
I guess it depends.

76
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,290
Depends on the person.
I assume everything in your notebook.

77
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,290
It's true.
I hope so.

78
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,590
The other thing that helps me like said 
this,

79
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,210
this helps,
you know,

80
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:33,211
writing it down helps me,
but also there's the running running 

81
00:03:33,211 --> 00:03:37,450
like helps.
So actually this was very interesting 

82
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:37,900
because the study just came out not long
ago showing that if you.

83
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:43,470
So if you run the four,
you're going to learn something and you 

84
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,650
want to like,
let's say you want to like,

85
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,600
you know,
do something short term recall,

86
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,880
so you're gonna go up on stage and say 
something,

87
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,950
you know,
say a skid or whatever,

88
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,200
and um,
if you run right before that,

89
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:55,330
it improves the short term memory.

90
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,700
So your short term recall if you run 
right before,

91
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:02,701
whatever it is,
you're quickly read over something and 

92
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,491
then you want to remember it.
But if you are learning something and 

93
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:09,061
then you run after you learn it and then
like the next day you want to remember 

94
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:09,520
it.
So it's more of a longer term memory.

95
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,180
It improves that.
So it's like whether or not you're 

96
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,970
running before,
after you learn it affects the short 

97
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:17,970
term versus long term memory.
Wow.

98
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,320
How did they work that out?
That's bizarre.

99
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,350
Well,
it,

100
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:23,020
it wasn't like they were testing for 
that.

101
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:25,210
They just found it out through because 
they were just,

102
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,010
you know,
doing running before,

103
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:30,210
after they're probably looking at just 
to see how it affects short and longterm

104
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,710
memory recall.
And they were surprised to find out this

105
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,320
was a study that was done.
Um,

106
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,040
I can't remember where it was done.

107
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:41,070
I know I tweeted about it not long ago 
because it was like within this last 

108
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:41,710
month that it came out.
So,

109
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,650
you know,
it's like if you want to,

110
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,700
if you want to.
So like while I'm,

111
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,910
you know,
learning new material throughout the 

112
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,580
day,
then I go for a run in the evening and 

113
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:53,580
then the next day I'll be able to recall
it better.

114
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,540
Theoretically now I'm subject to the 
placebo effects.

115
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,440
I know about this.
I'm like,

116
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:58,270
oh,
that's a problem.

117
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:02,590
I don't run normally,
but I did a five k on Monday,

118
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,820
like I don't run at all.
But a buddy of mine had a five k race in

119
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,821
Vegas.
So I flew in for him and my friend 

120
00:05:11,821 --> 00:05:13,060
Cameron Hanes and um,
I ran it and it was surprisingly hard.

121
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,510
Just like all the working out I do.
So only three miles.

122
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,080
It's like three point one or someone 
like her heart is a fucking hard.

123
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,580
It's not easy.
Yeah.

124
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:26,581
No.
So do you do any like aerobic between 

125
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:30,211
kickboxing,
Jujitsu and I do elliptical machine and 

126
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:34,970
I do a lot of yoga but doing,
I'm trying to do yoga three times a 

127
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,981
week.
I'm not always successful at getting 

128
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:37,981
there.
I got there last week,

129
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:38,440
three times a week.
But um,

130
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,020
I don't run so I figured.
But all that stuff I do,

131
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:41,990
I'm like,
I'll have,

132
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,150
I'll be fine.
Nope,

133
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,920
not really.
So you didn't train at all,

134
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:48,760
you just kind of like on the fly just 
did this five k and I saw,

135
00:05:48,761 --> 00:05:51,640
I saw you post something about this and 
I'm isn't,

136
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,740
doesn't cameron?
Isn't he like some kind of like crazy 

137
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,071
runner?
He's preparing right now for the 

138
00:05:59,071 --> 00:05:59,071
[inaudible] which

139
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:02,960
is 235 or 234 miles.
Something crazy like that.

140
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,780
And Jamie's a runner.
So when Jamie shakes his head like that,

141
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,950
you know,
it's really gross.

142
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,500
Yeah.
That's incredible.

143
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:10,670
Yeah,
he's a nut.

144
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,970
He did two.
Oh five last year he did the big foot 

145
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:15,970
200,
which is 205 miles.

146
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:20,381
Plus it has something insane like 55,000
feet of elevation change over the course

147
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:27,011
of the entire race because you're 
constantly going up and down and up and 

148
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,340
down and at some points in the race it's
so steep and the terrain,

149
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,700
it's an outdoor race over Mount Saint 
Helens.

150
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,180
So sometimes the terrain is so brutal 
that the top speed is two miles an hour 

151
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,180
or

152
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,390
he's going to be like one of those like 
amazing super agers like,

153
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,510
like,
like that.

154
00:06:42,511 --> 00:06:45,150
Just very mentally sharp when he's in,
when he's older.

155
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:47,940
Either that or he's not going to be,
that's been shot like it's been shown.

156
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,550
Like if you.
Part of being a super ager,

157
00:06:50,551 --> 00:06:54,720
like being a super ager means your old 
but your,

158
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,790
you're physically fit,
you're mentally sharp and mentally 

159
00:06:59,790 --> 00:06:59,790
sharp.
Is,

160
00:06:59,790 --> 00:06:59,790
is really the key thing,
you know,

161
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:04,041
cause we start losing brain mass at like
the age of 20 and by the time if you can

162
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:09,291
actually make it to 100 years old,
you lose like 20 percent of your brain 

163
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:12,261
mass.
So they found that one of the keys to 

164
00:07:12,261 --> 00:07:16,310
maintaining your brain mass is pushing 
past that comfortable zone physically.

165
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,210
So like,
you know,

166
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:23,330
exercise wise and also mentally just,
you know,

167
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,280
obviously like,
like learning new things and challenging

168
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:31,281
yourself so you know,
so when you're working out you don't do 

169
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:31,281
this kind of like,
you know,

170
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:33,900
half ass thing,
you have to push yourself,

171
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:38,901
you have to really push yourself and 
that seems to be key for becoming a 

172
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:39,270
super ager.

173
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,070
That's crazy than it works with your 
brain.

174
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,880
Why exercise?
I mean exercise has profound effects on 

175
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,661
your brain.
I mean specifically if you're looking 

176
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:50,661
at,
you know,

177
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:51,980
a robotic aerobic exercise,
a row,

178
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,760
it's hard aerobic exercise as you said,
doing a five k running three miles.

179
00:07:56,761 --> 00:08:01,761
I mean you do,
you do a lot of training and yet that 

180
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:01,800
was still hard for you,
you know,

181
00:08:01,801 --> 00:08:04,680
because during that type of aerobic 
exercise is difficult.

182
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:10,010
Um,
studies have shown that even just like 

183
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:11,100
20 to 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 
can,

184
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,040
in healthy young men increase serum 
bdnf.

185
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:16,080
So which is brain drive neurotrophic 
factor.

186
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:21,350
This is a growth factor that is involved
in growing new brain cells and in 

187
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,040
allowing the existing brain cells to 
survive.

188
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:24,160
So,
you know,

189
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,660
talking about combating brain atrophy,
you're talking about commenting that the

190
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:31,200
fact that your brain is atrophying,
starting at the age of 20,

191
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,490
that's the way to do it.

192
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,180
Your brain starts to atrophy at 20.
At 20 you start to lose brain mass.

193
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,950
Yeah,
I know.

194
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:39,870
It's really frightening.
20,

195
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,190
you start at the peak at 20.
It was so stupid at 20.

196
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:46,260
I'm so much smarter than I was when I 
was 20.

197
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,130
No,
I agree.

198
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:52,190
I agree.
I mean it's not necessarily like brain 

199
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:52,470
mass and intelligence.
I mean,

200
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,510
I don't know if you know that there's 
definitely a correlate but,

201
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,820
but like when you start losing mass in 
your hippocampus,

202
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:02,120
I mean that's memory learning,
you know,

203
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,880
that part of the brain.
Um,

204
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,490
but there's just so many studies showing
that exercise roebuck exercise and also,

205
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,780
you know,
it doesn't have to be Arabic.

206
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,810
You can do resistance training.
That sort of stuff also affects the 

207
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:14,810
brain as well.
But for me,

208
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:19,461
like I've been a runner since high 
school and track I guess long a long 

209
00:09:19,461 --> 00:09:20,740
time and for me,
you know,

210
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,810
I've done like a few races,
I've done a marathon and I don't feel 

211
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,060
like marathons are my thing.

212
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,070
Like I felt like that was just really 
rough,

213
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,340
you know,
like it was.

214
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,830
I mean I'll run three miles and I will 
feel challenged.

215
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Like if I push myself I can do that and 
that I feel like doing that a couple 

216
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,180
times,
three times a week is plenty for me.

217
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,990
But when I run,
you know,

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,990
for me it's my,
I entered this like state of,

219
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,930
of like daydreaming,
sort of.

220
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:50,090
I get creative,
you know,

221
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,020
when I'm going on a,
like a three mile run,

222
00:09:52,021 --> 00:09:54,210
I'm just,
I start thinking about things,

223
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:59,460
um,
if I have an important decision to make 

224
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:00,870
or something that's causing me some,
some sort of anxiety,

225
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,680
I go for a run.
And I feel like I can address that issue

226
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,770
better.
And what's interesting is that there 

227
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,400
have been studies that have shown that 
going for a run,

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,860
um,
and specifically aerobic exercise,

229
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,330
it activates the part of your brain and 
Bolt and executive function,

230
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:20,460
which helps you make decisions.
You know,

231
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,440
it's,
it's Kinda like that overarching part of

232
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:24,210
your brain that helps with all the 
planning,

233
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:25,080
long term planning,
all that.

234
00:10:25,081 --> 00:10:26,430
And so I always,
I do,

235
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,610
I feel like if I go for runs and it's 
bothering me,

236
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:32,490
if I'm anxious and I always feel better 
100 percent of the time,

237
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,520
like there's not a single time that I go
for a run and I'm like,

238
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:36,660
damn,
I feel worse.

239
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,630
Why did I do that?
You know,

240
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,100
it's like I feel,
I feel like crap while I'm doing it.

241
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:41,520
I'm like,
Oh,

242
00:10:41,521 --> 00:10:42,850
this is.
Well,

243
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,230
I

244
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:48,780
human mind.
I mean this is all just theoretical in 

245
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:51,271
my own theories.
I think the human mind is designed to 

246
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:54,271
confront serious things like predators 
and dangerous enemies.

247
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,871
And,
and we don't really get much of that in 

248
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:02,080
this life.
So when a person is dealing with stress,

249
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:05,770
I think the mind is preparing for some 
things that don't exist.

250
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,200
So even if you can work things out 
logically,

251
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:13,120
there's still remains like this residual
effect of all these human reward systems

252
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:18,121
that are kind of in place when the time 
we really did have to have all those 

253
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:21,880
rules,
those reactions in place to deal with,

254
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,630
you know,
a dangerous invaders or you know,

255
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,740
horrible natural conditions,
you know,

256
00:11:28,741 --> 00:11:31,180
whatever they would be that we hardly 
ever experienced any more.

257
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,450
So like when I work out,
if I have anything that's bothering me 

258
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,651
or troubling me,
I think I get like a distorted 

259
00:11:40,651 --> 00:11:43,540
perception of the danger of it or the 
physical real.

260
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:47,800
Like it could be something real simple.
Like I have an issue at work that I have

261
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:52,801
to deal with.
Like maybe I have to make a decision or 

262
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:55,321
maybe you know,
I'm stressed about something and I feel 

263
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:56,260
this no matter how much I work it out 
logically,

264
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,680
I still feel this physical,
like residual issue.

265
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,070
And that issue only seems to be resolved
for me because I don't run with hitting 

266
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:07,240
the bag.
Like for me it's a punching bag,

267
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,760
which is really hard to do.
Like when you,

268
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,780
when you do rounds,
like kickboxing rounds on a bag,

269
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,360
have a timer and I could set it for 
three to five minutes.

270
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,250
It'll,
it'll allow you to set it all the way 

271
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:22,250
down to one and then it has like 
intervals.

272
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,640
So it gives me like 30 seconds.
Every 30 seconds of Buzzer go off and it

273
00:12:24,641 --> 00:12:25,390
has two lights.

274
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,600
One light is yellow and one light is 
blue.

275
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:33,750
And so the yellow light,
I kind of a go at like 60,

276
00:12:33,851 --> 00:12:36,010
70 percent.
And then the blue light I sprint.

277
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,100
So it's like sprint,
try to catch your breast print,

278
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,220
tried to catch your breath.
And I do that for seven to eight rounds.

279
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:46,840
And when I do that I don't give a fuck 
about anything after it's over.

280
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,580
I'm like,
who cares?

281
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,610
Like it's amazing what it does because 
like my mind still has all the same 

282
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,510
data.
I still understand all,

283
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:58,600
whatever it is,
like work related nonsense.

284
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,260
I still understand all the issues about 
it and they're all,

285
00:13:02,261 --> 00:13:07,261
there's no new information,
but now the information is coming into 

286
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:07,261
my brain and it's going,
oh,

287
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:11,731
this isn't a foreign invader.
These aren't vikings that are coming 

288
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:12,190
over and have a fucking boat.
That dragon's head at the front of it,

289
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,600
swinging swords.
I.

290
00:13:13,601 --> 00:13:16,000
This is just some nonsense,
whatever it is,

291
00:13:16,001 --> 00:13:21,001
you know,
agent issue or manager issue or tax 

292
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:22,810
issue or whatever the fuck it is.
That seems so physically daunting before

293
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:27,811
the exercise,
but then afterwards when that aspect of 

294
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:28,210
the problem is alleviated,
that stress,

295
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,450
it's almost like my,
our bodies are just like confused as to 

296
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:33,640
what these problems actually are.

297
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,620
I'm like,
I love,

298
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,280
I love your,
your interpretation because it's exactly

299
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,340
the way that I would like to talk about 
why we need this type of stress.

300
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:50,460
I actually just like you said,
I actually think that from an 

301
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,491
evolutionary evolutionary perspective 
that we were meant to be stressed.

302
00:13:55,511 --> 00:14:00,511
We were meant.
We were meant to be out side either 

303
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:00,760
hunting,
tilling the land for food,

304
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,200
you know,
to prepare food.

305
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm bombarded by UVB radiation,
which is stressful.

306
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,270
We were designed to have stress and what
I mean by designed was we have genetic 

307
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:17,170
switches which are supposed to be turned
on.

308
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:22,500
These genetic switches that are 
activated by stress are supposed to be 

309
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,140
turned on and just like you said,
we're in a building novel time now where

310
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:30,190
we don't have to go outside,
we don't have to till the land,

311
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:32,630
we don't have to hunt for our food,
we can sit,

312
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,740
we can sit on the couch on her butt all 
day and order delivery or go to the 

313
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,260
grocery store and we don't have to eat 
foods with polyphenols.

314
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,900
Flavonoids are things that are also 
slightly stressful,

315
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,180
you know,
so this is kind of that concept before 

316
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:51,010
me says,
but I like the way you explained it 

317
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,571
because I really agree with you think 
that humans were meant to be stressed 

318
00:14:54,571 --> 00:14:56,570
exercise as a form of that stress.
And there's different,

319
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,580
various different types of,
of that stress.

320
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,080
Um,
and I,

321
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,810
and I think that we were supposed to 
switch on those,

322
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,840
those genetic switches,
those genes that are helping us deal 

323
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:07,840
with stress.
So like,

324
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,790
you know,
like you said you have a problem and I'm

325
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,090
the same way with my Ronald,
have some something that's bothering me.

326
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:19,091
I have to deal with whatever it is.
I mean in my mind I blow it up and may 

327
00:15:19,091 --> 00:15:22,331
not even be that big of a deal,
but I go for a run with no new 

328
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:25,310
information with nothing new,
you know,

329
00:15:25,311 --> 00:15:30,311
like I feel better.
And I think that's partly because I'm 

330
00:15:30,311 --> 00:15:32,180
switching on all these,
you know,

331
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,180
stress response pathways that helped me 
deal with the stress better.

332
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,540
These antiinflammatory pathways,
just all this really good,

333
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:43,630
you know,
these good genetic switches that are 

334
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:43,630
being

335
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,120
just switched on.
So when it totally makes sense,

336
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,200
I think this new time that we live in,
I just don't necessarily understand that

337
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,500
the body understands where the stress is
coming from.

338
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:56,501
I think you know,
your body is a physical organism and 

339
00:15:56,501 --> 00:15:59,561
nature is an absolutely brutal thing and
it has been for us as well as for all 

340
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:03,401
these other animals forever.
But now for us it's not really that 

341
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,820
brutal anymore.
And so all these mechanisms are in place

342
00:16:04,821 --> 00:16:08,270
to protect you.
And they don't get served and for me,

343
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,130
martial arts is always been like the 
best one to deal with.

344
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,170
Oh,
we're weight lifting's good to like a 

345
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:19,310
good kettlebell workout does it too.
But like the big ones for me are Jujitsu

346
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:22,610
and kickboxing because Jujitsu is 
really,

347
00:16:22,611 --> 00:16:26,780
really hard to do and it's also you are 
solving problems.

348
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,330
So I think Jujitsu serves two purposes.

349
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,450
It's incredibly grueling as far as like 
the sparring process of just rolling and

350
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,850
competing with each other.
Even in a friendly role.

351
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,990
Like with a guy that I really like and 
we're laughing and we slap hands every 

352
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,030
time someone gets tapped out or 
whatever.

353
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,740
It's so difficult.
Like your,

354
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
your,
your body's taxed so hard and your mind 

355
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,870
is taxed because you're dealing with 
countering.

356
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,200
You're dealing with setting up moves,
you're dealing with,

357
00:16:57,230 --> 00:16:59,780
you're thinking several steps ahead and 
then you're.

358
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:04,810
You're adjusting those thoughts based on
whatever this person that you're 

359
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:07,310
sparring with is doing too.
So people get really,

360
00:17:07,311 --> 00:17:10,820
really addicted to Jujitsu for all the 
right reasons.

361
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:16,060
And one of the things that I've found as
that Jujitsu people like for the most 

362
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,021
part,
are way more mellow than most people 

363
00:17:20,021 --> 00:17:21,440
would expect.
Like way more chill about stuff like way

364
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:26,441
less likely to respond to something in a
DM or an imbalanced way because they 

365
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:33,310
whatever your body,
whatever these requirements are that 

366
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,270
we're addressing,
your body has all that in Jujitsu,

367
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,330
but without the real real violence,
you know what I mean?

368
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,450
Like the ones trying to kill you,
they're just trying to do this thing to 

369
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:47,231
you and you're trying to do that thing 
to them and those things mimic actual 

370
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:49,620
combat,
actual real life and death struggle in a

371
00:17:49,621 --> 00:17:50,430
friendly.

372
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:55,840
And it also has this camaraderie built 
into it too because you've kind of 

373
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,711
understand that you're going through 
this incredibly intense thing together 

374
00:18:00,711 --> 00:18:04,520
and you also understand that it takes a 
unique person to go through that and get

375
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,260
past all these psychological hurdles,
all these physiological hurdles,

376
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:15,560
and then you also are aware that this 
person understands like really clearly 

377
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,830
the kinship that you all share in having
this experience together.

378
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,450
That's really,
that's really neat.

379
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,660
I kind of relate.
I mean,

380
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,420
not to the same degree,
like what you're,

381
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,540
what you're describing is on a whole 
other level.

382
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:32,541
But um,
I experienced something similar when 

383
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:32,541
I'm,
when I'm out surfing,

384
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:33,870
um,
you know,

385
00:18:33,871 --> 00:18:34,670
it's,
I'm,

386
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm getting the physical exercise,
but I'm also like a tackling these fears

387
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:43,761
of these big waves and getting pulled 
under and drowning and getting tangled 

388
00:18:44,131 --> 00:18:45,450
with my court,
you know,

389
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:50,630
there's like a million and every time I 
do I always have that fear paddling out 

390
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:50,820
there.
But I get out there,

391
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:54,090
there's a group of surfers and we're all
sitting out there and there is a sort of

392
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:00,170
friendship that we develop out there 
because we all love surfing and we've 

393
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:00,170
all like,
we know,

394
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:00,570
we know.
It's like,

395
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:01,440
oh,
here comes the wave.

396
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:03,000
We're helping each other.
Like,

397
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,710
look,
there's one on the outside paddle out,

398
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,790
you know.
So it's Kinda like I'm completely like a

399
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,640
different level from what you're 
describing with Jujitsu,

400
00:19:11,641 --> 00:19:14,190
but still I kind of can relate a little 
bit,

401
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,930
you know,
read.

402
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,320
I don't know if it is a different level 
and a lot of Jujitsu people surf as 

403
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,681
well.
I think there's like a similar 

404
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:25,571
attraction to it,
but because also you're a monster 

405
00:19:25,571 --> 00:19:27,971
dodger,
like you're out there in the monster 

406
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:27,971
soup.
Yeah,

407
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:28,000
it's,
it's,

408
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,540
um,
that's what that is.

409
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,970
It's crazy that I still haven't,
you know,

410
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:36,971
you'd think that after doing it for so 
many years that I would get over that 

411
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:36,971
fear,
but.

412
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,000
So they're so powerful.
Yeah.

413
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,650
I mean,
how can you get over that fear?

414
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:47,651
I'm my friend,
Shane Dorian is a big wave surfer and 

415
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,370
he's been on the podcast before and he's
a big time Paul Hunter too.

416
00:19:49,371 --> 00:19:52,210
And we talk all the time about this and 
you know,

417
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,130
um,
the way he describes it is just,

418
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,410
it's so attractive.
Like,

419
00:19:57,411 --> 00:20:02,411
I wanna try it,
but there's not enough hours in the day 

420
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:02,411
for me.
There's not,

421
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:02,411
I'm,
I'm,

422
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:03,530
I get too addicted to things and it's 
just.

423
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,890
And I have a fucking real fear of 
sharks.

424
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,320
It's real.
Sharks are scary,

425
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,200
scary or so.
But they're real.

426
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:12,950
They're out.
Yeah.

427
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,090
Oh Jesus.
What is this?

428
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:16,400
Jamie?
Shane Dorian is big wave.

429
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,070
Oh my God.
My hands are sweating.

430
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,530
Watching.
He is out of his fucking mind.

431
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:24,200
Totally.
He's a legit maniac.

432
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:26,890
Wow.
Like that is what is how.

433
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,010
How high would you say that wave is,
Scott?

434
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:29,990
To be 50 feet,
right?

435
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Say It's in Hawaii.
It's called jaws is the name of the 

436
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,260
jobs.
Oh my God.

437
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:39,110
Look at the size of that is so insane.
It's so insane.

438
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,530
Like losing my mind is when I see these 
guys big wave surfing like this,

439
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,380
my heart starts racing.
I'm so anxious.

440
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,220
Right?
God,

441
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,310
it's so insane.

442
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,930
That's more than 50 feet.
Right.

443
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,830
I would say at the very peak of it,
it does look like it's more than a 50 

444
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,370
foot faith now when it comes down to 
does it say there on the youtube thing,

445
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,200
what it comes down on you?
I mean,

446
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:01,450
it doesn't really like that if it that,
if that.

447
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,480
If you got smushed,
like if you fell and that came down on 

448
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,480
you,
I mean you're,

449
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:06,880
you're probably fucked.
Right?

450
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,260
That's the fear.
Yeah.

451
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,090
I mean damn.
I mean the biggest way I've,

452
00:21:11,091 --> 00:21:15,010
I've ever surfed is like overhead,
you know,

453
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,160
like over time and a half overhead,
so not even double overhead.

454
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,020
So.
And that was like,

455
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,850
I had a couple of,
um,

456
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,270
scary moments where I was just tumbling 
during donuts and I couldn't find which 

457
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:27,490
way was up or down,
you know,

458
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:31,340
it's like I've had one time I was 
surfing out in this place.

459
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:36,340
I'm in San Diego called sunset cliffs 
and it's a brief break and it's really 

460
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:36,340
hard to get out there so you have to 
like,

461
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:41,370
time you have to like jump out when the 
after the wave breaks and then you 

462
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:43,210
paddle out and there's all these kelp 
beds.

463
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,940
And I was surfing there this one time 
and this was back when I was really dumb

464
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,710
and didn't wear a leash because it was 
like Alicia is,

465
00:21:49,711 --> 00:21:51,520
you know,
I like to dance on my board and they get

466
00:21:51,521 --> 00:21:52,950
in my way.
And so I didn't release.

467
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,000
But um,
I,

468
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,960
I,
you know,

469
00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,550
there was a big wave and I was writing 
it and I wiped out and I like got caught

470
00:22:00,551 --> 00:22:02,540
in the kelp.
Oh Shit.

471
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,320
And so it was like the sky,
you know,

472
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,480
you have this moment where you panic and
that's really bad,

473
00:22:07,481 --> 00:22:09,550
like panicking when you're like in the 
water,

474
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,350
cause panic takes like your energy.

475
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,280
And I panicked and I was because I 
thought it was going to die.

476
00:22:15,281 --> 00:22:19,670
I was going to suffocate kelp bed.
So I remember having nightmares,

477
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,930
I've had nightmares about it.
Like that stuck with me.

478
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:26,140
That was like,
that was one of those moments that,

479
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,570
you know,
sort of traumatizing in a way.

480
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,200
How long did it take to get out of the 
Kelp?

481
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,160
I don't remember.
I don't remember because it was just,

482
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:35,530
I think the panic sort of just lost 
track.

483
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:40,560
It seemed like forever to me.
Like I don't know how long it actually 

484
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:44,821
took and of course I lost my board and I
like swimming and I got cut up on the 

485
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:46,980
reef.
Yeah,

486
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,850
reefs are brutal.
Brutal.

487
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,460
Yeah.
I actually stick to a beach breaks now,

488
00:22:51,461 --> 00:22:52,360
but I don't,
like you said,

489
00:22:52,361 --> 00:22:55,290
I don't even get to surf that much 
anymore because I just don't have.

490
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,550
So people that when they surf breaks 
that are over those reefs.

491
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:03,250
Like you just can't wipe out.
If you wipe out,

492
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,230
you're going to go right into all that 
Jag and shit.

493
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,330
Yeah.
It depends on where the reef is.

494
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:10,300
Like,
like I was riding the wave in kind of in

495
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:12,670
more so I was closer to where the wreath
was.

496
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,220
But yes you can.
It's,

497
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:17,020
it's dangerous.
They're beginners should not ever go out

498
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,330
on a reef.
And I've seen many beginners out there,

499
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,680
but it's,
yeah,

500
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:24,280
it's definitely more dangerous.
Feel the scratches and cuts.

501
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:26,650
Yeah.
Pretty,

502
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,730
pretty,
pretty brutal.

503
00:23:27,731 --> 00:23:29,680
But any shark encounters?
No.

504
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,630
I'm the only sharks.
I've actually.

505
00:23:31,631 --> 00:23:32,680
Actually,
I shouldn't say that's not,

506
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,040
that's not actually accurate.
I don't have any scary shark encounters.

507
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,150
Um,
I served for a long time in La Jolla and

508
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,210
there's a breeding ground,
therefore I'm leopard sharks,

509
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,040
which are not

510
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,100
to be confused with tiger sharks.
Tiger sharks are definitely scary.

511
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:54,310
Leopard sharks are the ones that have 
the spots on them and they're really 

512
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,970
harmless.
They're kinda like nurse sharks.

513
00:23:55,971 --> 00:23:56,610
Yeah.
Oh,

514
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,960
don't eat.
They're not like,

515
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,180
I really do like sand sharks.
There's this around.

516
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,270
Yeah.
Yeah.

517
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,700
And they're really cool to look at.
But I've never had,

518
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:09,020
I've never actually known anyone that 
serves in southern California that has,

519
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:14,160
you know,
with all the surfers that I've known 

520
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,160
that has had an encounter in southern 
California with a shark.

521
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,640
Do you know people that have encountered
them in the bay area?

522
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You.
The Bay area is a big breeding ground 

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,000
for great whites.
I would never surf there.

524
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Really?
No.

525
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,420
I would never say,
oh,

526
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:25,360
I would never surf there.
Yeah.

527
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,240
The sharks

528
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,410
look say yeah,
the sharks.

529
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,330
But they're all.
It's all connected.

530
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,950
It's like,
don't go outside.

531
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:36,030
There's a bad neighborhood somewhere.
Will stick and move around.

532
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,390
I guess just in my head,
I was sort of like convinced myself that

533
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:41,310
they're not,
they're not coming to San Diego.

534
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,700
There's a video of a drone flying over 
Malibu where some guy takes a drone and 

535
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:51,720
he's flying over the Malibu surf and 
he's like,

536
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,960
the drone is like maybe a few hundred 
yards away from some surfers and you see

537
00:24:57,241 --> 00:25:01,530
a big fucking great white just swimming 
along,

538
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,630
just swimming along and show me this 
video.

539
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,390
Drone shark footage.
So here's these people.

540
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,540
They're all on this board.
They came and were just southern 

541
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:11,540
California,
new big deal,

542
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,670
and when the drone keeps going further 
and further out,

543
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,880
you see this fucking whopper shark 
that's not far away from these people 

544
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,620
will find it here.
Jamie will find it.

545
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,650
There's one right there.
Where's this?

546
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,820
Oh,
nothing.

547
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:29,700
Oh,
nothing.

548
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,940
Just a shark right there.
Right there.

549
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,640
That's the fuck.
Dammit.

550
00:25:35,641 --> 00:25:36,900
Joe.
Don't show me this.

551
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:39,270
You know,
you're a smart woman.

552
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,600
You understand monster soup.
I try not to think about the sharks.

553
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,880
Well,
it's a gold look.

554
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:49,881
There's two of them.
Interesting book that surfer and two 

555
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:49,881
sharks.
No big deal guys.

556
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,350
That's pretty scary.
Yeah,

557
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,850
it's supposed to be scared.
Just I know.

558
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,080
I don't know.
Apparently Catalina,

559
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:03,260
that whole area outside of Catalina is a
crazy shark fishing mecca where I have a

560
00:26:04,171 --> 00:26:09,171
friend of mine from Texas and he 
traveled to Catalina Island and he said 

561
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,660
it is the most savage stretch of water 
in all of North America.

562
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,450
He said,
it's just infested with Maaco sharks,

563
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,200
and they go out there to catch me kosher
are delicious.

564
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,530
Mako sharks are really,
really good to eat too.

565
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,520
They taste like swordfish.
That tastes amazing.

566
00:26:23,521 --> 00:26:26,720
Are they dangerous?
Like they'll fuck you know,

567
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:29,640
fight you,
but the thing about sharks,

568
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:34,670
now it's because people are so silly 
because of the awareness of shark fin 

569
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:35,270
soup,
you know,

570
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:40,340
because shark fin soup is the practice 
of acquiring shark fins is really brutal

571
00:26:41,911 --> 00:26:44,070
and not sustainable.
All it's

572
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,070
really horrific and a lot of Asian 
fisheries engage in these unsustainable 

573
00:26:49,951 --> 00:26:54,951
practices where they'll scoop up 
thousands and thousands of sharks cut 

574
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:59,361
their fins off and then throw them right
back in the water so they waste most of 

575
00:26:59,361 --> 00:27:02,931
the shark in order to get the fins for 
shark fish soup and so because they're 

576
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:07,701
trying to raise awareness of this now,
people are getting really upset at 

577
00:27:07,701 --> 00:27:11,040
anyone who catches sharks even if they 
catch sharks legally for food,

578
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,460
because sharks are not endangered and as
well as any in any more sense than tuna 

579
00:27:17,411 --> 00:27:22,411
is endangered because tuna are in vastly
diminished numbers than they were just a

580
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:28,610
few decades ago.
If you talked to anyone who's a 

581
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:28,610
commercial fisherman or even a a sport 
fisherman,

582
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,460
if these guys that run these charter 
boats,

583
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,130
they'll tell you like to use to catch 
way more tuna.

584
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:37,190
It used to be way more prevalent.
I think there was something that you 

585
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,320
addressed in that Jiro Dreams of Sushi 
movie as well,

586
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,130
is that the commercial fishing is just 
brutalizing the tuna Martin,

587
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,520
but yet everybody is still eats tuna and
they don't think twice about it because 

588
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,121
this campaign against shark fin soup is 
made people like really upset at people 

589
00:27:50,791 --> 00:27:52,470
that catch sharks to eat.

590
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Even people that eat meat,
it's like we're so simplistic in like 

591
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,150
are protesting and like people just have
it in their head that I heard you're not

592
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:05,151
supposed to eat sharks anymore.
Like can you catch and sharks you 

593
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:05,151
fucking asshole.
Like,

594
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:09,360
like that is the one thing that you want
to talk about like fish that don't do no

595
00:28:09,361 --> 00:28:11,910
harm to human beings.
Like sharks aren't on that list.

596
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,030
You know,
in this,

597
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,600
this is scary God damn animal and if you
could eat that,

598
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:17,970
I say Kudos.
Kudos to you

599
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:21,420
because sharks are higher up on the food
chain.

600
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:26,750
Don't they have higher mercury levels?
That's a good question because I know 

601
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,930
like swordfish,
like I would not eat swordfish.

602
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,560
Really?
Oh No,

603
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,320
no.
Yeah.

604
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,320
There is like,
oh,

605
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,400
I wish I could remember the amount.
It's something like 150 micrograms per 

606
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,950
four ounces or something.
So compare that to a wild Atlantic 

607
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,340
Salmon,
which has like four micrograms.

608
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,720
Whoa.
Yeah.

609
00:28:45,721 --> 00:28:50,721
Swordfish.
So the ones that are really safe to eat 

610
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:54,100
that I know of are the wild wildlands 
salmon,

611
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,530
wild Alaskan,
sorry.

612
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:58,980
Analytic Wild Alaskan Salmon,
cod.

613
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,440
Um,
let's see.

614
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,920
White tuna is okay,
but the albacore tuna has a little bit 

615
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,340
more mercury.
I think it's like,

616
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,770
you know,
twice as much or something.

617
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,130
But I'm old.
I'm a little thinking that shark would 

618
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:16,230
be high on the mercury level.

619
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,760
That's interesting.
I'd like to find that out because I know

620
00:29:18,761 --> 00:29:22,210
that people have had issues that eat a 
tremendous amount of Sushi.

621
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:25,720
People that eat Sushi like every day.
I know they have had issues with mercury

622
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:30,721
in the past.
I actually had an arsenic issue with 

623
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:32,170
sardines,
sardines,

624
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:36,340
or bottom dwellers,
and I used to eat sardines all the time.

625
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,740
I have,
I love Sardi.

626
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,010
Yeah,
I love sardines too.

627
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,980
And if you eat canned sardines too much,
I

628
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,680
got some blood work done and the doctor 
was like,

629
00:29:44,681 --> 00:29:48,100
you have some significant amounts of 
arsenic in your system.

630
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:49,120
I'm like,
am I being poisoned?

631
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:49,810
He's like,
no,

632
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,040
not,
not that.

633
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:56,100
He goes,
it's not like someone's trying to kill 

634
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,100
you,
but it is like a dietary issue.

635
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:56,260
And then he asked me what I ate and I 
said,

636
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,610
you know,
we went through all my food.

637
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:58,300
He's like,
nothing else.

638
00:29:58,301 --> 00:29:58,810
I go,
he goes,

639
00:29:58,811 --> 00:29:59,680
what about seafood?
I go,

640
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,360
oh yeah,
I eat seafood.

641
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,650
Oh yeah,
I eat a lot of sardines.

642
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:03,760
He was like,
that's it.

643
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,140
I didn't know.
Sardines,

644
00:30:05,141 --> 00:30:07,150
uh,
accumulate arsenic.

645
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,280
Does that make sense?
So I backed off.

646
00:30:09,281 --> 00:30:11,290
I didn't eat sardines at all for three 
months.

647
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:13,300
Came back,
the issue was completely resolved.

648
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,150
Yeah.
You know what I'm besides sweat,

649
00:30:16,151 --> 00:30:18,670
you sweat out a lot of these heavy 
metals like mercury,

650
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,390
arsenic,
um,

651
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:24,370
garlic,
some of the Beta mercaptans and garlic.

652
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
They key late,
they bind and key late mercury and help 

653
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,560
pull it and excrete it out of your body 
through the urine.

654
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,290
So like when I,
whenever I make salmon or fish,

655
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:40,291
which I actually do eat a lot of salmon,
it probably like two or three times a 

656
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:40,291
week.
Um,

657
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:43,030
I always have fresh garlic with it.
Oh Wow.

658
00:30:43,031 --> 00:30:48,031
That's amazing.
And Salmon is outstanding to because 

659
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:48,031
it's so high in essential fatty acids 
strictly.

660
00:30:48,031 --> 00:30:49,660
It's really good for you.
Exactly.

661
00:30:49,661 --> 00:30:54,661
Yeah.
It's really high in Omega three fatty 

662
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:54,661
acids,
EPA and Dha.

663
00:30:54,661 --> 00:30:58,111
So.
And it's got a modest amount of vitamin 

664
00:30:58,111 --> 00:30:59,851
D.
whenever I'm sick I eat giant cloves of 

665
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:03,211
garlic.
I'll just break it down to point where 

666
00:31:03,211 --> 00:31:05,731
it makes me feel horrible.
I'll have like a big glass of Kombucha 

667
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:09,360
and I'll take like a lump of garlic and 
I'll break off like four or five cloves 

668
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:13,900
and I'll just take off the skin and chew
those bitches down and Chug it.

669
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,960
With Kombucha it's off,
like sometimes it,

670
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,300
it's painful as it's going down.
Like my,

671
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:23,230
my system is like,
what in the fuck is this?

672
00:31:23,231 --> 00:31:25,810
Like,
I could feel it inside my body burning.

673
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,650
I love it.
I've,

674
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,680
I've done the same thing previously.
I mean,

675
00:31:28,681 --> 00:31:30,510
I don't do that anymore,
but uh,

676
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,440
yeah,
I mean garlic is very powerful.

677
00:31:32,441 --> 00:31:35,110
Antimicrobial compounds in it.
So,

678
00:31:35,111 --> 00:31:37,420
I mean,
that makes perfect sense.

679
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,130
Lots of last time I did it,
I went,

680
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,880
I had to take a knee,
a knee to knee.

681
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,790
Really?
Yeah.

682
00:31:45,791 --> 00:31:47,350
Like,
I didn't actually go down,

683
00:31:47,351 --> 00:31:51,620
but what I did was I put both my arms on
the counter and I went down like this,

684
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,260
like,
oh,

685
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,710
because it was just burning,
going down.

686
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,260
I just was like,
well,

687
00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:02,020
this is probably not even working.
I'm just being retarded.

688
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:07,290
No.
Getting back to some of those like 

689
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:07,290
pungent compounds that are in these,
these,

690
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:09,250
these plants.
I mean that kind of gets back to what we

691
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:13,270
were talking about a minute ago with 
switching on those genetic switches that

692
00:32:13,271 --> 00:32:16,800
are meant to be switched on there.
Man,

693
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,580
we're supposed to eat these kinds of 
foods,

694
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,920
garlic,
Broccoli,

695
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,170
cauliflower,
Kale,

696
00:32:23,171 --> 00:32:25,180
these things that have that pungent 
mustard,

697
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:26,500
you know,
that,

698
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,150
that pungent tastes.
I mean,

699
00:32:28,151 --> 00:32:29,190
these things are,
um,

700
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,770
you know,
various different polyphenols and 

701
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,961
compounds and one in particular I become
obsessed with lately is sulfur fain and 

702
00:32:36,961 --> 00:32:38,920
that's present in most of the 
cruciferous family,

703
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,670
Kale,
Broccoli,

704
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,160
cabbage,
Brussel sprouts,

705
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:45,770
Wasabi,
Bok Choy,

706
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,430
just,
you know,

707
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,560
that whole family of vegetables,
pretty much.

708
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:52,250
I eat those vegetables a lot,
but I become very obsessed with this,

709
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:57,040
this compound that is,
it's actually sulforaphane refrains,

710
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,080
not in the plant.
It gets formed once you break the plant 

711
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:06,560
tissue once it's like chewed or crushed 
or blended or whatever,

712
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:11,561
chopped somehow because it's stored as a
precursor and then once the tissue gets,

713
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,840
you know,
chapter or whatever,

714
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:20,130
uh,
then it forms sulforaphane and that's 

715
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,130
part of it's,
you know,

716
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,130
hormetic response.
It's,

717
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:24,620
it's plant response to try to ward off 
insects or whatever thing.

718
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,090
So that's,
that's why it forms,

719
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,890
but it actually,
when we ingest it,

720
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,480
it's a really,
really,

721
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:31,220
really good for us,
you know.

722
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:34,690
So the sulfur in particular,
um,

723
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,090
which is actually really,
really high in Broccoli sprouts.

724
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:42,800
Have you ever had Broccoli sprouts?
Broccoli sprouts actually contained like

725
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,140
a hundred times more of it than mature 
Broccoli.

726
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:49,960
So it's like probably the best source of
sulfur,

727
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,330
dietary source of sulfur fain out there 
on your instagram that you,

728
00:33:54,331 --> 00:33:55,670
you make shakes with that,
right?

729
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,260
I do,
yeah.

730
00:33:57,261 --> 00:34:02,261
I've become sort of convinced that it's 
a very powerful anti aging and also 

731
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:08,561
powerful nootropic in a way.
I guess I could say.

732
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,700
Um,
and I can elaborate,

733
00:34:10,701 --> 00:34:15,701
but you know,
so I've been doing these shakes where 

734
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:15,701
you can,
you can sprout,

735
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:18,080
you can sprout your own sprouts at home 
for a relatively cheap.

736
00:34:18,081 --> 00:34:23,081
You just buy some organic weed dealer.
That's what about three point five 

737
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:26,570
pounds of Broccoli spouts,
wink,

738
00:34:26,571 --> 00:34:29,530
wink.
That's what they call it.

739
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,730
These kids,
believe it or not though,

740
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,410
if you freeze them.
So I was actually,

741
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,480
I'm freezing.
So those bags are going in the freezer 

742
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,350
when you freeze them because when you 
freeze the plant,

743
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:41,360
the tissue also gets like broken.

744
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:47,050
It actually doubles.
In some cases you can up to double the 

745
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,281
amount of sulfur Fein because it like 
has a longer time to form this so you 

746
00:34:51,281 --> 00:34:53,960
can have more concentrated.
I learned that the hard way,

747
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,020
but um,
what hardware,

748
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:02,070
let me just,
because it's so pungent and powerful 

749
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:02,360
that if you make a shake with it and 
you're doing,

750
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:07,510
like at first I was doing fresh shakes 
and then we start freezing them and I 

751
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:12,041
was making shakes that were from 
previously frozen sprouts and it's like 

752
00:35:12,041 --> 00:35:13,820
I needed like half the dose,
um,

753
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:14,930
you know,
to feel,

754
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,250
to feel the same thing or if I feel I'm 
okay.

755
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,530
So I guess I should probably,
you know,

756
00:35:21,531 --> 00:35:25,640
it's kind of just like,
like when you drink coffee,

757
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,350
you know,
how you kind of just,

758
00:35:27,351 --> 00:35:31,910
you feel a little happy and good and you
feel a little more alert.

759
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,190
Um,
sort of like that.

760
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,900
And it was.
The thing is,

761
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:40,901
is that it's been shown.
So there have been clinical studies in 

762
00:35:40,901 --> 00:35:45,360
humans and this is very interesting 
because it's been shown like if you give

763
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,500
it,
you give,

764
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,210
you know,
even just a small amount.

765
00:35:48,211 --> 00:35:53,211
I think it was like between seven to 30 
milligrams of sulfur free in a day to 

766
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:58,470
two young adults with autism that it 
improved their autistic scores by like 

767
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:01,950
34 percent.
And artistic scores,

768
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:06,951
they liked the,
there's a range of different tests that 

769
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:09,600
are done to like measure different 
various brain functions,

770
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,530
but improve this and this.
He autistic autistic individuals by like

771
00:36:13,531 --> 00:36:15,600
34 percent.
The same was done.

772
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:20,710
Um,
in a pilot study for people with 

773
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,970
schizophrenia were like improve their 
symptoms so they're just,

774
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:23,280
their brain functions better.
Wow.

775
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:24,210
Yeah.
So,

776
00:36:24,211 --> 00:36:26,130
and this is like pretty,
um,

777
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,800
the,
the results were so powerful that,

778
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,450
you know,
this was done at Johns Hopkins.

779
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,130
The study is now being repeated,
um,

780
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:38,270
you know,
because it's like this is what is going 

781
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,270
on here.
Like how is this affecting the brain?

782
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:38,530
And I think,
you know,

783
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,960
if you look at a lot of the animal 
studies,

784
00:36:39,961 --> 00:36:42,570
there's lots and lots of animal studies 
that have been done,

785
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:43,980
which are,
you know,

786
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,930
people aren't quite as convinced because
it's like,

787
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,580
well,
how much of this relates to humans,

788
00:36:47,581 --> 00:36:51,330
but it's been shown to be as effective 
as um,

789
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,720
the,
the antidepressant Prozac in alleviating

790
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:59,721
depression and mice.
And they do all these battery of tests 

791
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:01,210
were they stress the mice out and make 
them depressed and social defeat in like

792
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,440
the hanging by their tail.
It's actually just kind of gnarly.

793
00:37:04,441 --> 00:37:06,000
But,
and then there's like,

794
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:11,060
you know,
a bunch of tests they do to see if 

795
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,060
they're depressed and you give them,
you know,

796
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,370
your,
your placebo,

797
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,640
you give them Prozac or you give them 
the,

798
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,990
the Broccoli sprout extract and it 
performed just as well.

799
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,940
Um,
so it helps depression,

800
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,880
it's been shown to help with 
neurodegenerative diseases,

801
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,370
all sorts of things.
But the point is,

802
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:28,371
I think that the reason it's actually 
affecting all these brain functions and 

803
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:33,111
why even you know,
someone like me may notice a small 

804
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:36,471
effect from,
from eating them is because it has very 

805
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:38,430
profound effect on inflammation.
And that is because,

806
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,740
as I mentioned,
it's,

807
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:45,170
it switches on one of those switches 
that was meant to be switched on a 

808
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,330
pathway called NRF two and our body that
controls over 200 genes.

809
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:53,331
And so for Fein is the most potent 
naturally occurring compound that we've 

810
00:37:53,881 --> 00:37:56,010
discovered yet that activates this 
pathway.

811
00:37:56,011 --> 00:38:01,011
So it's no other plant compound or 
they're naturally occurring plant 

812
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:04,521
compound can activate this pathway is 
potent as sulforaphane and nrf two is,

813
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:10,970
I mean,
it's been shown in multiple studies to 

814
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,651
be involved in delaying aging and a lot 
of that happens through lowering tons of

815
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:17,820
different inflammatory genes,
activating anti-inflammatory genes,

816
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,360
lowering oxidative stress,
glutathione related enzymes.

817
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:26,360
It helps with detoxifying compounds that
we're exposed to on a daily basis like 

818
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,950
percentages and things.
So I think that we're having a low level

819
00:38:28,951 --> 00:38:31,770
of this like inflammation stuff that 
we're constantly being exposed to and it

820
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:33,390
affects the brain,
you know,

821
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:36,280
so if you're,
if you get a dose of this,

822
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:41,310
you,
you may notice a small effect now with 

823
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:41,310
someone that has autism or 
schizophrenia,

824
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,440
inflammation and oxidative stress had 
been shown in previous studies on 

825
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,831
multiple previous studies to,
to play a role in the etiology of those 

826
00:38:49,831 --> 00:38:54,151
diseases.
So I think that's how it may be 

827
00:38:54,151 --> 00:38:55,360
effecting the brain,
but it's not just affecting the brain.

828
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:57,740
And probably one of the most well known,
um,

829
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:02,500
functions of sulfur Fein is that it's 
like a very powerful,

830
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,430
a cancer preventative,
um,

831
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,340
compound.
So it's,

832
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:08,680
you know,
it's been shown to prevent cancer.

833
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:09,880
Uh,
for example,

834
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,940
if you have men that had prostate cancer
when they were given 60 milligrams of 

835
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,660
sulfur,
feign a day for,

836
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,450
I think it was like a month,
I don't remember exactly how long,

837
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:24,630
but it lowered its slowed the doubling 
rate of a tumor biomarker called 

838
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,060
prostate specific Antigen Psa,
which is what is usually measured when 

839
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,400
men have prostate cancer.

840
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,340
You mentioned the progression of it 
because it has a doubling rate.

841
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,680
It doubles every so often,
but it slowed that doubling rate by 86 

842
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,040
percent,
which is pretty,

843
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,750
pretty profound.
Of course,

844
00:39:40,751 --> 00:39:45,751
there's lots and lots of associative 
studies that have shown cruciferous 

845
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:45,751
vegetables,
you know,

846
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:47,620
if you eat more of them,
you have lower risk of bladder,

847
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,150
ovarian,
prostate,

848
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:51,250
kidney,
just all sorts of cancers.

849
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Um,
but there's the clinical trials I think 

850
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:56,640
are what's really telling because 
they're,

851
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:01,950
you know,
you're giving someone this compound and 

852
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,811
it's slowing a tumor.
Progressive Progression Marker by 86 

853
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:03,811
percent.
Um,

854
00:40:03,811 --> 00:40:06,190
there's another study which is really 
interesting also,

855
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,410
and this is kind of like what really got
me interested.

856
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,040
I'm not sure if other people are 
interested in it,

857
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,050
but um,
you know,

858
00:40:14,051 --> 00:40:17,890
we're exposed to two compounds from like
air pollution.

859
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,290
So like living in Los Angeles for 
example,

860
00:40:20,291 --> 00:40:25,291
is probably definitely one of the places
that you're going to be more exposed to 

861
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:25,291
the.

862
00:40:25,291 --> 00:40:29,080
So some of these airborne carcinogens,
so benzenes one of them Aqualina.

863
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,930
These things are in the air.
We're breathing them in.

864
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,850
We're,
we're getting to some degree,

865
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:38,851
we have it.
We have benzene in our system and it is 

866
00:40:38,851 --> 00:40:41,761
a carcinogen.
It's been shown to cause cancer 

867
00:40:41,761 --> 00:40:45,121
specifically linked to leukemia,
has a smokers get a ton of it because 

868
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,820
it's in,
it's in cigarettes.

869
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,170
So cigarettes smokers are like really 
loaded up with benzene.

870
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,440
But there was a study where people were 
given like 40 milligrams of sulforaphane

871
00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:00,980
in the form of a Broccoli sprout drink a
day for like a week and starting on day 

872
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,911
one of tea drinking this drink,
they excrete id 61 percent of the 

873
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,620
benzene,
like on day one,

874
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:11,260
61 percent of benzene which is coming 
out of their urine,

875
00:41:11,261 --> 00:41:12,970
like as you measure metabolites.
And I was like,

876
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,010
wow,
that is amazing.

877
00:41:15,011 --> 00:41:17,170
Like getting rid of some of that stuff,
you know,

878
00:41:17,171 --> 00:41:17,680
I,
you know,

879
00:41:17,681 --> 00:41:22,681
because I'm definitely want to get rid 
of the benzene and all that stuff that 

880
00:41:22,681 --> 00:41:22,681
I'm being exposed to.

881
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:26,830
So that really got my attention too 
because it was just so significant and a

882
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,950
profound effect just after one day.
Um,

883
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:35,190
so that,
that was another sort of thing that got 

884
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,500
me really it.
And then the aging stuff where it's been

885
00:41:36,501 --> 00:41:40,580
shown some inflammation has been 
identified as a key age or of aging.

886
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,130
Taking sulforaphane has been shown to 
lower inflammatory markers in people,

887
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,220
um,
by like 20 percent c reactive protein,

888
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:52,280
other inflammatory markers.
Of course there's like dozens of studies

889
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:53,990
in animals that have been done,
but I'm sort of,

890
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:56,180
I think the human studies are more 
interesting to talk about.

891
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,150
So definitely more relevant.
Um,

892
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:04,990
and then also it's been shown to effect 
a cardiovascular health because of the 

893
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:09,401
inflammation.
I think so type two diabetics that were 

894
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:09,401
given,
uh,

895
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:09,401
some,
some dose,

896
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,890
I think it was something around 40 
milligrams as well as of sulforaphane.

897
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:14,690
They were given this daily and for a 
month,

898
00:42:14,691 --> 00:42:18,560
for four weeks and it lowered their 
triglycerides by 20 percent.

899
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:22,010
It lowered their atherogenic index,
which is measuring,

900
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,770
you know,
the dangerous type of Ldl,

901
00:42:24,771 --> 00:42:27,260
small dense ldl triglycerides,
looking at all these things,

902
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:32,300
lower that by 50 percent,
improve their blood sugar by almost 20 

903
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,760
percent.
So that's like I'm getting my mouth,

904
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,250
I'm trying to get my mom on this.
I'm,

905
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,440
you know,
my mom,

906
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:41,530
she,
she definitely has got like high 

907
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:41,530
triglycerides,
you know,

908
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,440
thing.
So I'm really convinced.

909
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:47,441
And then there's been studies in animals
that's just shown that it like delays 

910
00:42:47,441 --> 00:42:50,141
aging.
So I'm convinced that I think it's one 

911
00:42:50,141 --> 00:42:53,261
of those things like you get it in Kale 
and I think that I've been getting a 

912
00:42:53,261 --> 00:42:55,640
good dose of it.
I've been drinking Kale smoothies.

913
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:00,650
I'm pretty regularly since I'm probably 
like 2010.

914
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,590
Yeah,
probably about six or seven years.

915
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:08,950
And I do feel like it's like help age,
like help me age like a little better.

916
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,150
I mean,
it could be completely in my mind,

917
00:43:11,151 --> 00:43:12,880
but just because I know it killed has 
held,

918
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,290
killed with healthy,
but I think that I've found something to

919
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:20,291
take it to another level where I think 
that I'm pretty convinced that if I 

920
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:21,830
continued taking the Sulforaphane,
um,

921
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:27,130
I think it will absolutely affect the 
way I age and I think it will affect my 

922
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:27,130
brain aging as well.
I mean,

923
00:43:27,130 --> 00:43:30,380
it's been shown to at least an animal 
studies to affect brain aging,

924
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,680
traumatic brain injury.
I mean if you administered after 

925
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:35,680
traumatic brain injury,
it improves.

926
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,301
Outcome,
improves your brain swelling and all 

927
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:40,301
that by like 50 percent,
you know,

928
00:43:40,301 --> 00:43:44,201
just all sorts of nones.
It's just like I could go on and I have 

929
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:47,591
a video.
I did like a 45 minute video where I'm 

930
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,130
literally just talking about this for 45
minutes and then I went on Youtube.

931
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,690
It's on youtube.
Yeah.

932
00:43:50,691 --> 00:43:52,280
And I,
um,

933
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:54,530
I did this,
this research took month,

934
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,260
many months and it's like a 16 page 
article I wrote.

935
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,600
Um,
and I hope to get published.

936
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:01,700
I think I'm going to submit it for 
publication because it's just,

937
00:44:01,701 --> 00:44:06,701
it was a lot of work and I haven't seen 
anything in the literature as 

938
00:44:06,701 --> 00:44:08,060
comprehensive covering every base.
Like I just,

939
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:11,450
I tried to cover everything that was 
like a good study,

940
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:12,830
you know,
that was important.

941
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:14,930
And I'm so,
so um,

942
00:44:14,931 --> 00:44:17,160
and then I flew out to Johns Hopkins,
uh,

943
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,180
recently I was invited to give a talk 
there and I met it just so happens the 

944
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:23,750
guy who discovered that,
first of all,

945
00:44:23,751 --> 00:44:26,240
the guy who discovered Sofer Fein is 
there,

946
00:44:26,241 --> 00:44:27,740
but he's much older.
I didn't meet with.

947
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:30,150
I met with someone who trained with him,
um,

948
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:33,300
who discovered that Broccoli sprouts are
the best source of sulfur.

949
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,700
And so he made that discovery back in 
the nineties.

950
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:41,120
Um,
and I interviewed him and he just went 

951
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:41,540
on and on and on and talked about so far
are like,

952
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,970
in addition to like what I had already 
talked about on one of the videos I did.

953
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,560
And he actually had some really 
interesting stuff to talk about in terms

954
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,250
of like,
um,

955
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:51,390
you know,
you.

956
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,330
So in order to get the sulfur thing,
you have to,

957
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:59,750
the plant has to be crushed or chopped 
and that's because it has an enzyme in 

958
00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,981
it called my Ra cynase.
And my Ross cynase is I'm heat 

959
00:45:03,981 --> 00:45:04,110
sensitive.
So when you,

960
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,060
when you,
when you steam your Broccoli,

961
00:45:06,061 --> 00:45:09,300
when you boil your Kale,
when you saw your kill,

962
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:14,690
any of that stuff,
unfortunately your inactivating my 

963
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,370
Roston a's.
And so you're not getting as much sulfur

964
00:45:16,371 --> 00:45:21,371
fain,
you're getting dramatically less 

965
00:45:21,371 --> 00:45:21,810
dramatic,
almost not almost nonexistent.

966
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,830
The precursor Glucoraphanin is still in 
that plant.

967
00:45:25,831 --> 00:45:30,831
So,
so you're getting the precursor and we 

968
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:32,670
do have some bacteria,
some types of bifido bacteria in our gut

969
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,850
that contain the,
my ra,

970
00:45:33,851 --> 00:45:38,851
Annie's enzyme,
highly variable from individual to 

971
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:41,571
individual,
but so you can convert some of that to 

972
00:45:41,571 --> 00:45:45,390
sulforaphane.
But what was interesting that he 

973
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:45,960
mentioned is you can actually sprinkle 
mustard powder,

974
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,600
like mustard powder that you buy,
um,

975
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:54,950
after you saw your Kale or after you 
steam your vegetables or what if you 

976
00:45:55,051 --> 00:46:00,051
cook,
if you apply heat to any of your 

977
00:46:00,051 --> 00:46:01,791
cruciferous vegetables afterwards,
you put the muscle paddle on mustard 

978
00:46:01,791 --> 00:46:02,820
powder.
It has active my Ross and he's in it and

979
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:07,821
it's pretty.
The myrosinase in the mustard seed is 

980
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:11,361
more heat stable so you can actually 
convert your precursor into the soul for

981
00:46:13,531 --> 00:46:15,090
fame by adding the mustard powder.
And I was like,

982
00:46:15,091 --> 00:46:16,740
that is a really great wow.

983
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,760
Like thing to know because now I'm like,
because I do cook a lot of.

984
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,960
I saw take all the time.
Um,

985
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:22,530
I,
you know,

986
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,010
I steam my Broccoli,
put some butter and salt,

987
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,430
pepper.
That's how I eat my broccoli.

988
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:31,670
So it wasn't very useful.
Are there any compounds in Kale or 

989
00:46:32,161 --> 00:46:37,161
broccoli or anything else that makes 
them more bioavailable when you do cook 

990
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:37,161
them?
Um,

991
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:41,960
yeah.
I mean a lot of the minerals and stuff 

992
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:41,960
in it,
like magnesium,

993
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:41,960
the calcium,
those things are,

994
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:44,520
those things become more bioavailable 
when you cook them.

995
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:48,840
And so you would get that benefit.
Plus if you just cooked it,

996
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,080
the mustard.
So when the master seed powder,

997
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:57,081
you have to make sure it's.
What I like to do is sprinkle a little 

998
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:57,081
bit on my hand and lick,
lick it,

999
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,130
like it's got to give.
It has to have that bite.

1000
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,750
If it doesn't have the bite,
it's like,

1001
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:03,570
it's been degraded.
It's been on the shelf for too long.

1002
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,310
It's been an Amazon shelves for too 
long.

1003
00:47:05,311 --> 00:47:05,970
Whatever,
you know.

1004
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:07,230
So,
um,

1005
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:12,290
yeah,
it has to have that light mustard bite 

1006
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:12,290
to it.
Could you regular mustard?

1007
00:47:12,870 --> 00:47:13,800
I don't think so.
Now.

1008
00:47:13,801 --> 00:47:16,260
Mustard seed.
The mustard seed.

1009
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,960
Yeah.
Uh,

1010
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:21,060
so that.
So that was a very useful like,

1011
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,790
you know,
because the Sulforaphane,

1012
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,610
it's really good joe.
I really am.

1013
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:29,660
I'm trying to get people to.
I think the more people that get the 

1014
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:30,310
sulforaphane in life,
I think they're gonna be healthier.

1015
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:33,490
I think it can help prevent cancer,
lower inflammation.

1016
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,400
I'm just so many different good things.
So smokers,

1017
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:37,960
for God's sake,
if you're a smoker,

1018
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,740
they should be taking sulfur free.
They should be drinking those shakes.

1019
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:43,630
I'm drinking,
drinking like every day,

1020
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:49,420
you know,
because they are getting so much 

1021
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:49,420
benzene.

1022
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:51,930
So two questions about this one.
Where does someone get Broccoli sprouts?

1023
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:53,770
Where,
where would you get that?

1024
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,240
Well,
also the thing is,

1025
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:58,900
is that you can borrow,
you can buy Broccoli sprouts already,

1026
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:03,901
sprouted at like whole foods or sprouts 
or whatever your local grocery store is.

1027
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:12,170
Most,
most grocery stores contain a have 

1028
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:12,170
Broccoli,
sprouts,

1029
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:16,740
sprouts.
It's very rarely that you find Broccoli 

1030
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:16,740
sprouts,
isn't it?

1031
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:17,260
At whole foods?
They're at sprouts.

1032
00:48:17,530 --> 00:48:20,680
But the problem,
here's the problem with buying sprouts,

1033
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,760
um,
they're very prone to,

1034
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:29,820
to bacterial contamination.
The cookie Kolai that the longer they 

1035
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,320
sit on the shelf and a lot of times when
you go into these grocery stores,

1036
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,800
they're sitting on the shelf and so 
they're probably likely a little more 

1037
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,571
contaminated with Nikolai then if you 
were to sprout them yourself and get 

1038
00:48:42,571 --> 00:48:45,330
them fresh so you can buy them.
Um,

1039
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:50,140
but I think,
and they also charge like it's like five

1040
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:53,020
bucks for like a little package of it,
you know,

1041
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,630
it's like one shake,
right?

1042
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,080
Yeah,
I'd say one shake,

1043
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:59,440
whereas you can spend 20 bucks and get 
like a pound of seeds.

1044
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,890
And so how do you grow it?
Um,

1045
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:03,630
well there's lots of different methods 
you can,

1046
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,110
you can use hemp.
Like,

1047
00:49:05,111 --> 00:49:08,190
so previously we used to do these hemp,
um,

1048
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:11,770
hemp bags where we just put,
you put the seeds in the bag and you add

1049
00:49:11,771 --> 00:49:13,060
some water.
Uh,

1050
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:18,120
you basically just keep adding water to 
them and let it drip and they sprout 

1051
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:20,970
within like four days.
Then we started doing this jar method 

1052
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:24,001
where now we have mason jars with a lid 
on top that has like little holes that 

1053
00:49:24,001 --> 00:49:25,150
are big enough for water to come out 
obviously,

1054
00:49:25,151 --> 00:49:27,820
but not for the seeds to come out.
And so,

1055
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,250
you know,
you get these jars and you add water,

1056
00:49:30,251 --> 00:49:32,620
let it sit for like six hours and then 
dump it out.

1057
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:37,770
And then you just,
after that you continually just add the 

1058
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,171
water and dump it out and add the water 
interpreter and kind of leave it tilted 

1059
00:49:40,171 --> 00:49:42,460
so that the water isn't just like,
you don't want the water just sitting in

1060
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:45,220
there so that it's like growing bacteria
and stuff.

1061
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:48,760
So like let you know,
tilt the water and just wet.

1062
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,460
Yeah.
And it really just takes like four days.

1063
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,970
And then you have sprouts.
The only thing is you have,

1064
00:49:54,010 --> 00:49:55,670
you do have to be,
you know,

1065
00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:00,870
clean like your counters all dirty and 
your hands are dirty and all the dish 

1066
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:05,560
where you're using this dirty,
then you're probably going to 

1067
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:05,560
contaminate them.
So you have to like,

1068
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,750
be a little fastidious about the way you
spread out these things.

1069
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,010
Um,
you know,

1070
00:50:09,011 --> 00:50:11,890
but I think once you're aware of that,
then it's okay.

1071
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:13,480
The other thing is,
um,

1072
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:17,020
and this is something that I'm going to 
talk to to the expert.

1073
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:22,020
His name is Dr Jed Fahy.
I recently interviewed him on my 

1074
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:25,261
podcast.
He mentioned something to me that like 

1075
00:50:25,261 --> 00:50:26,740
caught my interest.
He said the seed itself,

1076
00:50:26,741 --> 00:50:31,741
the Broccoli seed itself has the enzyme,
it has the precursor to sulforaphane.

1077
00:50:31,911 --> 00:50:35,780
And if you break or crush the seed or 
chew the seed,

1078
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,700
then you're actually getting.
So for refrain.

1079
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:43,090
So you can actually crush up the seed 
and like a coffee grinder or something 

1080
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,210
and like take a shot of it.
But the thing is,

1081
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:48,350
is there's been no research doing this 
method.

1082
00:50:48,351 --> 00:50:50,480
So all these studies that I just talked 
about in humans,

1083
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:54,730
those were all done from like Broccoli 
sprout powder extract from the sprouts.

1084
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,770
Powder extracts is something they 
goodbyes a supplement.

1085
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,580
Great question.
Um,

1086
00:50:59,690 --> 00:51:04,690
so.
Well the powder extracts were mostly 

1087
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:04,690
made by researchers.
In fact Jed,

1088
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:05,630
jed is supplied a lot of,
um,

1089
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,490
a lot of different universities with 
the,

1090
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,750
with the extract himself.

1091
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,230
Um,
but there are so supplement wise,

1092
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:16,040
that's the other thing that he really 
sort of illuminated for me because,

1093
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,780
because he's actually been measuring 
this certain supplements that are on the

1094
00:51:20,781 --> 00:51:23,330
market and like if they actually have 
what they say they have.

1095
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,960
Um,
and so because myrosinase is so 

1096
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,781
unstable,
it is hard to make a supplement with 

1097
00:51:31,781 --> 00:51:34,451
sulfur roofing.
There is one supplement only one that I 

1098
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:37,991
know of that actually has sulforaphane,
the actual active compound and that's 

1099
00:51:38,391 --> 00:51:43,391
called prostitution.
And that's only available in France by 

1100
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:48,011
the way.
I have no affiliation with any of these 

1101
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:48,011
supplement companies at all.
I'm just telling information.

1102
00:51:48,011 --> 00:51:51,230
It's only available in France.
It's only available in France and so and

1103
00:51:51,231 --> 00:51:56,231
that.
So he actually tested that one and 

1104
00:51:56,231 --> 00:51:58,631
people that were given Prostif I'm the 
bioavailability of the soul for roofing 

1105
00:51:59,031 --> 00:52:04,031
with 70 percent,
so 70 percent of it ended up like in 

1106
00:52:04,031 --> 00:52:04,031
their bloodstream.

1107
00:52:04,031 --> 00:52:07,900
Um,
there's another supplement called Avma 

1108
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,441
[inaudible].
Avma McCall has Glucoraphanin plus 

1109
00:52:10,441 --> 00:52:11,470
myrosinase in it,
so it doesn't have the Sulforaphane,

1110
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,480
has the two compounds that can form,
so for a friend,

1111
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,350
but it hasn't been together,
um,

1112
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:21,400
that has been tested and that was a bout
40 percent by bioavailability.

1113
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:26,180
So about 40 percent of it was you were 
actually getting sulforaphane 40 percent

1114
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:31,181
of the time and that was also tested.
There's another supplement and that is 

1115
00:52:31,371 --> 00:52:36,371
available in the US.
There's another supplement by thorne 

1116
00:52:36,371 --> 00:52:40,360
called Coursera I think.
And Chris Sarah only has the precursor 

1117
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,950
no enzyme,
so you're totally relying on your gut 

1118
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:45,290
bacteria.
And some people it's very variable,

1119
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:47,870
so that only had a 10 percent 
bioavailability.

1120
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,090
Um,
other than that,

1121
00:52:50,091 --> 00:52:53,780
those are the three supplements that he 
really could.

1122
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,800
And this isn't a study who just 
published recently that he got behind.

1123
00:52:57,801 --> 00:53:00,680
I asked him about a few others because I
had actually been taking,

1124
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:04,340
uh,
there's another one called Brocka Max by

1125
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:09,341
jarrow and he kind of was like asked him
about it and he was kind of like 

1126
00:53:09,341 --> 00:53:12,380
[inaudible] has some of what it says in 
there but not all,

1127
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:13,160
you know.
And,

1128
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:15,470
and the problem is,
is that these supplements,

1129
00:53:16,070 --> 00:53:21,070
I mean there's a lot of,
a lot of the times like he was telling 

1130
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:21,400
me like,
Jeez,

1131
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,450
like seven out of 10 times these 
supplements had like cloverleaf in them 

1132
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:26,450
when they're supposed to have like

1133
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:30,690
the cruciferous precursor Glucoraphanin.
So it's just like,

1134
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,270
it's kind of disgusting how supplement 
company,

1135
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:38,060
how somebody a supplement companies are 
totally just putting all this cloverleaf

1136
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:39,930
and whatever.
And there was a study that came out like

1137
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,090
a couple of years ago on this,
like,

1138
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,570
like 75 percent of all these,
like herbal Achalasia,

1139
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,470
like all these,
you know,

1140
00:53:46,471 --> 00:53:47,800
compounds that are,
you know,

1141
00:53:48,010 --> 00:53:50,310
you know,
marketed for whatever,

1142
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:54,000
don't actually even contain economically
or whatever they say they contain.

1143
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:56,010
It's really,
it's really kind of bad.

1144
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,390
So it's a giant issue and if you're a 
company that sells that stuff,

1145
00:54:00,391 --> 00:54:04,050
a lot of times you're not even,
you're not even getting it directly from

1146
00:54:04,051 --> 00:54:05,280
the source,
you know,

1147
00:54:05,281 --> 00:54:07,710
they're buying it from companies that 
supply it to them.

1148
00:54:07,711 --> 00:54:12,711
And a lot of times these companies are 
in China and places where there were 

1149
00:54:12,711 --> 00:54:13,470
regulations are not that strict.

1150
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,260
You can,
you can get just with.

1151
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,280
I mean,
we had an issue with that when we first 

1152
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:21,540
started making Alpha brain where we 
would get stuff tested,

1153
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:27,350
we get batches tested in the batches of 
different individual ingredients would 

1154
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:32,271
have stuff in it that they weren't 
supposed to have in it just because 

1155
00:54:32,271 --> 00:54:32,271
they're mixing it all up in the same 
bins.

1156
00:54:32,271 --> 00:54:33,000
Oh yeah,
that's true.

1157
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:35,250
There's also that.
Yeah,

1158
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:37,350
I mean there's just,
you got to find a reliable brand,

1159
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,390
you know,
and I think,

1160
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:44,440
you know,
Thorn Thorn seems to be a pretty 

1161
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:44,440
reliable one that,
um,

1162
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,050
I've seen multiple,
multiple different,

1163
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:48,840
you know,
times where scientists were like,

1164
00:54:48,841 --> 00:54:49,600
yeah,
we've tested that.

1165
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:51,660
It,
it's more expensive,

1166
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:56,900
but they seem to be pretty reliable.
So it seems like the best method is a 

1167
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:59,580
sprout your own Broccoli sprouts.
So I think that's the best method and it

1168
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:01,140
seems like very cost effective to.

1169
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,700
Exactly.
It's cost effective.

1170
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:05,610
You don't,
you don't have to have extra cash to buy

1171
00:55:05,611 --> 00:55:10,611
all these expensive supplements because 
the all the ones I just mentioned that 

1172
00:55:10,611 --> 00:55:11,760
actually are effective and have what 
they say they're not cheap.

1173
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:14,880
So that those bags that you had,
that instagram photo,

1174
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,950
is that all sprouts that you'd made 
yourself a mason jars at two,

1175
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,860
six,
six,

1176
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:21,130
six.
Oh Wow.

1177
00:55:21,131 --> 00:55:22,190
That's not that bad.
Yeah.

1178
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,460
I mean they get really dense to.
They fill up inside the jar.

1179
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:27,750
Yeah.
Yeah.

1180
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:29,640
I have like other pictures somewhere on 
there.

1181
00:55:29,641 --> 00:55:32,640
They were there with the jars,
but I'm thinking I might just do a quick

1182
00:55:32,641 --> 00:55:37,641
spreading video like a fiber six minute,
like I'm already going in my head about 

1183
00:55:38,071 --> 00:55:39,960
how I'm going to start sprouting.
Awesome.

1184
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,060
And they're good.
Like,

1185
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,120
you know,
you don't have to do.

1186
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,010
I always sort of take it to the next 
level.

1187
00:55:44,010 --> 00:55:46,740
Like I make my shake and it's like,
um,

1188
00:55:47,070 --> 00:55:49,020
but they're good on salads.
I mean,

1189
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,000
you know,
you can sprinkle them on anything,

1190
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,080
you know,
it's,

1191
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:57,470
I really,
I really liked them on salads quite a 

1192
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:57,470
bit.
So that's amazing.

1193
00:55:57,470 --> 00:55:57,620
Now,
uh,

1194
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:59,060
there you go.
Oh,

1195
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:01,230
there we go.
Does the.

1196
00:56:01,231 --> 00:56:01,680
Yeah.
So those.

1197
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:05,730
So those are the mason jars that have 
holes already in them.

1198
00:56:06,850 --> 00:56:09,150
Yes.
You can actually buy this sprouting kit.

1199
00:56:09,151 --> 00:56:11,820
So these actually we found these are the
old lids we were using.

1200
00:56:11,821 --> 00:56:16,821
We actually found better lids that have 
even smaller holes because some of the 

1201
00:56:16,821 --> 00:56:19,290
seeds were getting out of this,
but this came as a kit,

1202
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:23,770
a sprouting kit you can buy on Amazon.
It has like a little wooden going to set

1203
00:56:23,771 --> 00:56:26,170
the mason jars in so they're like tilted
and you can like,

1204
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,820
you know,
drip the water out.

1205
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,170
They came with those lids.

1206
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:34,950
But then we did some experimentation and
found other leds that are superior to 

1207
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:34,950
those.
But those,

1208
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:37,030
how much maintenance is involved in 
making these.

1209
00:56:37,031 --> 00:56:39,190
Like how often do you have to attend to 
these things?

1210
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,710
Oh,
it's just like after the first initial,

1211
00:56:41,711 --> 00:56:43,720
like six our water.
You know what?

1212
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:46,870
You let them sit.
It's like twice a day in the morning and

1213
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:49,690
evening dump water on them,
but you have to rip them out.

1214
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:53,590
And how long does it take to grow that?
That was about five days,

1215
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,150
I think.
Four or five days.

1216
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:57,790
So for a guy like me who goes away on 
weekends a lot,

1217
00:56:58,030 --> 00:57:02,350
I'd have to make sure that I am home for
a stretch where you can.

1218
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,870
So,
so you could have Harvard is actually.

1219
00:57:04,871 --> 00:57:07,570
So here's the thing,
the longer you're letting them sprout.

1220
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:09,970
So I was just trying to maximize and 
went more dense,

1221
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:14,971
you know,
because I wanted to get my bang for my 

1222
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:14,971
buck.

1223
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:18,300
But you can actually,
you could have Harvard is harvested 

1224
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:18,300
though,
is probably like early,

1225
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,030
like three days,
three and a half days.

1226
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,820
Um,
and actually the longer you wait,

1227
00:57:21,821 --> 00:57:24,130
the more you have to be careful with 
contamination too.

1228
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:29,460
So it's like,
it's better probably even to harvest 

1229
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:29,460
them sooner.
Freeze them.

1230
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:29,740
So they're like,
you know,

1231
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:33,220
no bacteria that way you're just,
you're safe.

1232
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,530
And you're just putting them in a ziploc
storage bags.

1233
00:57:35,790 --> 00:57:40,790
Yeah.
Do you ever vacuum seal things and 

1234
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:41,050
freeze them?
And now I should do that with me.

1235
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:42,700
Yeah,
it's a good idea.

1236
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:43,570
I mean,
that,

1237
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,640
that would,
that would be a good idea to do.

1238
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:47,230
Wow,
that's a,

1239
00:57:47,231 --> 00:57:49,840
that's really intense stuff.
The other question that I wanted to have

1240
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:55,250
a talk to you about was when you were 
saying schizophrenia and how so fewer 

1241
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:01,060
feign can prevent or somehow mitigate 
the effects of schizophrenia.

1242
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:06,390
Do you think that there is a possible 
correlation between a lot of these 

1243
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:10,270
mental health diseases and a lack of 
proper nutrition?

1244
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:11,890
Oh,
absolutely.

1245
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,160
I think that a lack of proper nutrition 
is a huge component of a lot of mental 

1246
00:58:18,941 --> 00:58:21,100
diseases and psychological diseases in 
general.

1247
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:22,420
Um,
in fact,

1248
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:27,780
inflammation is now it's really been 
identified as I caused playing a causal 

1249
00:58:30,281 --> 00:58:32,210
role in depression.
Um,

1250
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,720
and that's something that,
you know,

1251
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:37,570
so with the depression thing,
uh,

1252
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,160
it's,
here's,

1253
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,780
here's kind of a funny story and it's 
not that funny.

1254
00:58:40,781 --> 00:58:43,810
It's actually kind of eye opening,
but back in the,

1255
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:47,600
so the CDC has estimated that about 11 
percent of,

1256
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:53,060
of um,
Americans are on some sort of 

1257
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:53,060
antidepressant.
Eleven percent.

1258
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:55,120
That's a lot.
So here's the story behind that.

1259
00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,400
So crazy it is,
and I know several people that are on 

1260
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:02,740
them or have taken them or you know,
you know,

1261
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:08,130
whatever.
But the story behind that is kind of 

1262
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:10,150
interesting because back in like the 
early seventies,

1263
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:15,240
um,
a lot of these clinical trials were 

1264
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,611
being done on antidepressants with 
people that had depression and at that 

1265
00:59:17,981 --> 00:59:20,640
time people that had depression,
um,

1266
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,520
that were involved in these trials

1267
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:26,360
were people that were severely depressed
and hospitalized,

1268
00:59:26,361 --> 00:59:29,450
so they were so depressed that they had 
been hospitalized for depression.

1269
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:32,450
I don't know many people that had been 
hospitalized for depression nowadays,

1270
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:37,451
but so they were hospitalized for 
depression and then they were given 

1271
00:59:37,451 --> 00:59:40,760
either placebo or an depressant and a 
multiple trials.

1272
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:44,210
You know,
FDA had reviewed these trials 70 percent

1273
00:59:44,211 --> 00:59:46,060
of the time,
the antidepressant.

1274
00:59:46,130 --> 00:59:51,130
So the antidepressant worked in 70 
percent of the patients compared to 30 

1275
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:51,650
percent of the patients were placebo 
worked,

1276
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,620
right?
Seventy percent is pretty good if you're

1277
00:59:54,621 --> 00:59:56,680
comparing that to 30 percent in placebo,
it's like,

1278
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,610
well that's efficacious.
That seems to work.

1279
00:59:58,611 --> 01:00:03,611
Right.
What then happened after those trials 

1280
01:00:03,611 --> 01:00:05,300
were done starting in the seventies and 
eighties,

1281
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,920
is that the clinical diagnostic manual,
it's called the dsm.

1282
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:13,760
At that time it was the DSM two,
they changed all their,

1283
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:16,160
um,
their diagnosis,

1284
01:00:16,370 --> 01:00:17,510
um,
you know,

1285
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,280
markers and,
and uh,

1286
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:23,180
symptoms for depression and they 
expanded it a great,

1287
01:00:23,181 --> 01:00:23,870
great deal.

1288
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,590
And they then called depression major 
depressive disorder.

1289
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,850
So it became this sort of like broader,
you know,

1290
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,760
a disease,
quote unquote,

1291
01:00:34,761 --> 01:00:39,761
where it was like,
it's not just these people that are 

1292
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,981
severely hospitalized,
it's people that are feeling depressed 

1293
01:00:41,981 --> 01:00:42,470
and anxious and sad or what,
you know,

1294
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:45,590
it's just basically you're,
you're getting a bigger group of people,

1295
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:48,030
which is probably a great opportunity 
for,

1296
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:53,060
for a pharmaceutical company.
But then when clinical trials were 

1297
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,550
repeated on this new population of 
people,

1298
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:57,530
so these,
these are clinical trials that were done

1299
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,970
from like the eighties all the way up 
until like the 2000 year,

1300
01:01:01,971 --> 01:01:05,150
2000 when those were reviewed,
reviewed by the FDA.

1301
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:11,140
What was found was quite shocking and 
that was that only 40 percent of people 

1302
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,970
were now responding to like 
antidepressants.

1303
01:01:13,971 --> 01:01:17,000
SSRI is other norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors,

1304
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:20,450
lots of whatever the standard of care is
compared to 30 percent placebo.

1305
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:25,690
So now you're talking about only 10.
They're performing only this 

1306
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,800
antidepressants performing only 10 
percent better than placebo.

1307
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,330
It's like,
okay,

1308
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:34,810
something so clearly.
It's not that the antidepressants don't 

1309
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:37,931
ever work,
it's just that we are now over 

1310
01:01:37,931 --> 01:01:41,471
prescribing them to people that you know
or have this major depressive disorder 

1311
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,760
and they're not working on people that 
weren't,

1312
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:44,450
you know,
the,

1313
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:49,780
the initial group of people that were 
like severely depressed and 

1314
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:49,780
hospitalized,
you know.

1315
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,020
So it's like,
okay,

1316
01:01:51,021 --> 01:01:53,870
that's,
that's a big problem because they're,

1317
01:01:53,871 --> 01:01:58,871
I mean they're prescribed like,
I mean I just like,

1318
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:00,590
I can't even believe it,
you know,

1319
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,080
I just have so many personal stories.
People I know,

1320
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:04,580
you know,
that have gone,

1321
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:07,100
you know,
going through some crisis and personal,

1322
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:09,740
a divorce,
whatever,

1323
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:15,070
and also in their given you some crazy 
center giving some crazy drug and they 

1324
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:15,410
changed the personality of the person.

1325
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,540
And I'm just like,
please get off of this.

1326
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,430
Like,
you know,

1327
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,620
it's not like.
And like I said,

1328
01:02:19,621 --> 01:02:21,990
it's not like they don't ever work,
it's just that,

1329
01:02:21,991 --> 01:02:26,991
you know,
I think once the clinical diagnostic 

1330
01:02:26,991 --> 01:02:31,990
book changed the whole procedure for 
diagnosing depression and became major 

1331
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:36,441
depressive order disorder,
all of a sudden you're getting people 

1332
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:36,510
that are now like having just,
you know,

1333
01:02:36,810 --> 01:02:41,810
whatever stressful event in their life 
that's making them a little depressed 

1334
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:45,330
the time which everyone's probably 
experienced are now being given this 

1335
01:02:45,330 --> 01:02:46,410
antidepressant when they don't really 
need it.

1336
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,770
And there are effects that are not good 
with taking some of these,

1337
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,640
you know,
and a depressant.

1338
01:02:50,650 --> 01:02:53,730
So it was a big effect on Libido.
Yeah.

1339
01:02:53,731 --> 01:02:54,350
Onto the lobby.

1340
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:59,670
Yeah.
I know a lot of people that have taken 

1341
01:02:59,670 --> 01:02:59,670
it where their sex drive just goes away.

1342
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:03,320
Yeah.
There's actually a gene that's a gene 

1343
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,550
polymorphism,
a variation in a gene that,

1344
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:09,620
that is linked to that.
So people that have it have even more 

1345
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:11,940
severe effect where they really don't.
They really have like sexual dysfunction

1346
01:03:11,941 --> 01:03:14,100
and response to a.
It just shuts down.

1347
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,060
Yeah.
Yeah.

1348
01:03:15,061 --> 01:03:16,920
It doesn't happen to everyone quite as 
much,

1349
01:03:16,921 --> 01:03:21,921
but there,
there's a percentage of people that it 

1350
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:21,921
really,
really affects.

1351
01:03:21,921 --> 01:03:22,530
And there's lots of other things.
I mean it's just,

1352
01:03:22,531 --> 01:03:24,870
it's changing your brain chemistry,
right?

1353
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,050
It's not exact.
It's an inexact science.

1354
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:33,070
No,
there's a lot of experimentation going 

1355
01:03:33,070 --> 01:03:34,921
on with it.
I had a friend of mine who had gone to 

1356
01:03:34,921 --> 01:03:37,651
several doctors and they had prescribed 
a bunch of different things to him and 

1357
01:03:37,651 --> 01:03:41,881
he was severely depressed and eventually
they gave up and he had to find a much 

1358
01:03:41,881 --> 01:03:45,700
better doctor that his care,
his whatever his insurance package would

1359
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:49,180
not pay for.
And once you found that doctor,

1360
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:54,390
then the doctor was just more 
knowledgeable about what potential 

1361
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:56,320
different ones.
I mean,

1362
01:03:56,321 --> 01:03:57,700
I don't know how many different ones 
there are,

1363
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:00,130
but they got them on something that 
actually worked.

1364
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:05,180
He's off it now.
It took them awhile and then eventually 

1365
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,070
got happy.
And then oddly enough,

1366
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:12,300
which is an interesting thing because 
people always want to connect 

1367
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:14,080
depression.
They want to say depression is a disease

1368
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:16,390
and they want to say it almost like,
oh,

1369
01:04:16,391 --> 01:04:17,230
you got herpes.

1370
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,370
Like,
you know what I mean?

1371
01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:19,060
It's like,
well,

1372
01:04:19,061 --> 01:04:20,290
you've got depression.
Oh,

1373
01:04:20,291 --> 01:04:22,450
well you need medicine.
And for him,

1374
01:04:22,870 --> 01:04:27,870
the.
One of the big factors in fixing 

1375
01:04:27,870 --> 01:04:29,290
everything was his own success,
his own personal success,

1376
01:04:29,291 --> 01:04:31,150
and then he became more happy and then 
his,

1377
01:04:31,510 --> 01:04:35,870
the medication helped.
He became more successful and then as he

1378
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:40,871
became eventually really successful,
he started to experience like a better 

1379
01:04:40,871 --> 01:04:42,880
quality of life.
He was happier,

1380
01:04:42,881 --> 01:04:47,881
he was more confident and then he slowly
weaned himself off and now he has no 

1381
01:04:47,881 --> 01:04:51,631
need for them to mean.
That is so fascinating because so we're 

1382
01:04:51,631 --> 01:04:53,560
not talking about necessarily a disease,
like he does not have cancer.

1383
01:04:53,561 --> 01:04:55,870
It's not like that they cured him of a 
disease.

1384
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:01,260
It's,
it was a blanket that was keeping him 

1385
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:01,260
warm,
you know,

1386
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:05,821
it was something that was,
was allowing him to bridge the gap 

1387
01:05:05,821 --> 01:05:08,590
between an unhealthy mental state and 
healthy mental state.

1388
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,680
But a lot of that health had to do with 
his own life.

1389
01:05:11,681 --> 01:05:13,120
He still eats like shit.
I mean,

1390
01:05:13,121 --> 01:05:16,450
he's not like the healthiest guy.
He eats a lot of fucking candy,

1391
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,360
but a really healthy now as far as like 
his mind,

1392
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:22,090
he's very happy.
He's not lying,

1393
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:23,260
you know,
he's not faking it.

1394
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:25,300
So to me it's always.
I mean,

1395
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,380
when,
when you know,

1396
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:31,381
I've talked to friends that have had 
really good results with 

1397
01:05:31,381 --> 01:05:35,281
antidepressants,
so I think there are some dark moments 

1398
01:05:35,281 --> 01:05:36,730
in people's lives where that can kind of
get them out of that,

1399
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:42,150
but then part of me doesn't buy that.
That's the way to go because part of me 

1400
01:05:42,281 --> 01:05:42,760
is like,
okay,

1401
01:05:42,761 --> 01:05:44,830
well did you exercise?
No.

1402
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:48,010
Did you take like really healthy foods?
No.

1403
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,690
Did you clean your life up?
No.

1404
01:05:49,691 --> 01:05:52,270
Did you like how,
what happened here?

1405
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:57,540
And one of the things that a lot of 
these antidepressants do is they make 

1406
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,910
you not feel bad about stuff like about 
anything.

1407
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,670
Like A.
I had a friend who was on Zoloft and she

1408
01:06:03,671 --> 01:06:05,830
said like,
she took it for a year and she's like,

1409
01:06:05,850 --> 01:06:08,890
I kind of lost a year of my life.
Like I didn't give a fuck about anything

1410
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:10,510
during that year.
Like anything can happen.

1411
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,050
It's scary.
Yeah.

1412
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,680
But that not giving a fuck,
not,

1413
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,170
not feeling bad.
You also,

1414
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:22,650
you don't feel great either.
You don't feel like you don't feel like 

1415
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:22,870
God,
it's a good time to be alive.

1416
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:23,950
Look at me,
I'm healthy.

1417
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:24,740
I can move,
you know,

1418
01:06:24,741 --> 01:06:28,600
like all those thoughts don't sort of 
come into play.

1419
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,230
It's like it dulls everything.
It dulls the highs and the dolls,

1420
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:33,910
the lows and it keeps the pain away.

1421
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:36,750
That's kind of interesting because 
believe it or not,

1422
01:06:36,751 --> 01:06:40,110
that's actually a symptom of depression.
I think it's called Hedonia or something

1423
01:06:40,111 --> 01:06:44,070
where someone's not really responsive to
anything.

1424
01:06:44,071 --> 01:06:45,500
It's like you can't,
like,

1425
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,640
you just can't like,
you know,

1426
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:49,980
you know,
like excite them or,

1427
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:52,680
or like make them super anxious either.
They're just kind of like,

1428
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:58,490
you know.
So that's actually kind of interesting 

1429
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:59,730
that she was experiencing that while on 
an antidepressant.

1430
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:02,760
Will the results vary pretty widely?
Totally.

1431
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,650
Yeah.
I mean with the same drugs,

1432
01:07:04,651 --> 01:07:05,190
right?
Yeah,

1433
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:05,820
yeah.

1434
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:08,080
Now is that because of biodiversity,
like what,

1435
01:07:08,081 --> 01:07:13,081
what's causing that?
That you could take something and you 

1436
01:07:13,081 --> 01:07:15,630
would have a totally different reaction?
I can take something and it would just

1437
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:16,720
perfect.
Yeah.

1438
01:07:16,790 --> 01:07:17,350
I,
you know,

1439
01:07:17,351 --> 01:07:22,351
I honestly,
I don't think we actually know really 

1440
01:07:22,351 --> 01:07:23,200
why that is,
but what we do know is that there are,

1441
01:07:23,201 --> 01:07:25,200
I mean there are different,
you know,

1442
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,400
we are different people and I've got 
different genes that are regulating how 

1443
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:32,410
much serotonin I making,
how much dope immune I'm making,

1444
01:07:32,411 --> 01:07:36,010
how much I'm metabolizing it,
how quickly I'm metabolizing it than you

1445
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,980
and other people.
And so when you like MP and this is,

1446
01:07:38,981 --> 01:07:41,500
this absolutely does affect how some of 
these drugs are,

1447
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:43,230
you know,
when they're taken,

1448
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:48,231
how,
how they are with their biological 

1449
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:48,231
effect is now,
you know,

1450
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:48,231
why,
why,

1451
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:49,990
I don't know,
you know,

1452
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:51,870
so it's,
there's definitely like a,

1453
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:56,871
a genetic variation that,
that affects the way our 

1454
01:07:56,871 --> 01:08:00,751
neurotransmitters are being fired away 
in the way are I'm being metabolized.

1455
01:08:00,971 --> 01:08:05,971
And so if you're,
if you're adding a drug that's changing 

1456
01:08:05,971 --> 01:08:06,460
the way something's being metabolized 
already,

1457
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:08,920
then it's gonna affect people 
differently I think.

1458
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,050
I think that's one reason,
but honestly,

1459
01:08:11,051 --> 01:08:12,070
I don't know.
Who knows?

1460
01:08:12,071 --> 01:08:13,830
There's maybe like other,
you know,

1461
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,620
life situations.
Well,

1462
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:18,950
other dietary situations,
all these things probably play a role,

1463
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:24,320
you know,
with the inflammation I was talking 

1464
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:24,320
about actually playing a causal role.
I mean,

1465
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,990
there've actually been,
studies were normal,

1466
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:30,260
healthy people are injected with either 
a placebo,

1467
01:08:30,261 --> 01:08:32,800
which is saline water,
saltwater,

1468
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:37,490
or they're injected with something that 
our gut produces called endotoxin.

1469
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:42,760
Our gut produces it when our immune 
cells in our gut attack the bacteria in 

1470
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:46,010
our gut because endotoxin is actually a 
component of the bacterial cell membrane

1471
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,420
and that is released upon inflammation.
So when you're eating a terrible diet,

1472
01:08:50,421 --> 01:08:52,260
lots of refined sugar,
um,

1473
01:08:52,290 --> 01:08:53,870
and that's,
that's actually been shown,

1474
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:58,960
um,
you release endotoxin and it causes 

1475
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,571
inflammatory response.
So when people are injected with 

1476
01:09:01,571 --> 01:09:03,320
endotoxin or they're injected with 
proinflammatory cytokines,

1477
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,870
interferon gamma,
which we also make in our body,

1478
01:09:05,871 --> 01:09:08,450
when we're inflamed,
people start to,

1479
01:09:08,451 --> 01:09:12,700
at normal healthy people start to 
experience feelings of depression.

1480
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,890
They start to feel depressed,
anxious,

1481
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:17,070
social withdraw.

1482
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:21,290
People with the placebo did not 
experience that.

1483
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:26,620
Um,
also they had elevated levels of other 

1484
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:26,620
inflammatory biomarkers,
biomarkers in their blood.

1485
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,330
So it really like,
and this is just,

1486
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:34,510
this is causal.
And when we're talking about injecting 

1487
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,680
in relation to inflammation,
all of a sudden they're experiencing 

1488
01:09:36,680 --> 01:09:38,741
these depressive symptoms.
It was actually people that were then 

1489
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:39,410
given.
I'm one of the omega three fatty acids,

1490
01:09:39,411 --> 01:09:44,411
EPA.
They're given an actually a pretty high 

1491
01:09:44,411 --> 01:09:46,241
dose of it.
I think it was close to like two grams 

1492
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:46,241
or something,
uh,

1493
01:09:46,241 --> 01:09:46,241
completely,
um,

1494
01:09:46,490 --> 01:09:48,170
alleviated any of those symptoms so 
that.

1495
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:53,200
So those people that were getting the 
inflammatory cytokine or the endotoxin 

1496
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,440
and the EPA did not experience those 
symptoms.

1497
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,960
So it was really like inflammation,
you know,

1498
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:58,310
driven,
uh,

1499
01:09:58,311 --> 01:10:00,440
these symptoms that were not experienced
in the placebo.

1500
01:10:01,010 --> 01:10:02,000
Um,
so that's kind of,

1501
01:10:02,001 --> 01:10:04,230
and there's been multiple studies 
showing this not,

1502
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:05,390
you know,
it's not just one studies,

1503
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,970
multiple studies,
multiple studies.

1504
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,680
Again,
this is kind of like a new method people

1505
01:10:09,681 --> 01:10:12,410
are using to explore how inflammation 
affects depression.

1506
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:17,950
It also has been shown the same sort of 
scenario where there's a placebo and 

1507
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:18,620
they're injecting a inflammatory 
cytokine.

1508
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:25,030
Dopamine levels lower in the brains of 
people that were injected with the 

1509
01:10:25,030 --> 01:10:26,570
proinflammatory cytokines,
but not the saline water.

1510
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,090
And also the reward pathway in the 
brain,

1511
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,280
um,
is also decreased.

1512
01:10:31,281 --> 01:10:32,360
So,
you know,

1513
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:33,410
again,
like I was mentioning,

1514
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,200
you're not that excitable,
you don't,

1515
01:10:35,350 --> 01:10:37,160
you know,
it's just kinda like and that,

1516
01:10:37,161 --> 01:10:42,161
and that was not,
that did not happen in the placebo 

1517
01:10:42,161 --> 01:10:44,351
group.
So this was not just an effect of being 

1518
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:44,351
shot up with something,
you know.

1519
01:10:44,351 --> 01:10:44,450
So,
um,

1520
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,010
when,
when,

1521
01:10:46,011 --> 01:10:47,380
uh,
scientists have looked at some,

1522
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,310
some of the mechanisms and explored 
will,

1523
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:53,240
how is it that inflammation is affecting
dopamine in the brain?

1524
01:10:53,241 --> 01:10:55,730
How is it that it's effecting people's 
mood?

1525
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:58,760
It's thought now there's a variety of 
mechanisms.

1526
01:10:58,761 --> 01:10:59,630
One is that,
you know,

1527
01:10:59,631 --> 01:11:04,631
these inflammatory cytokines,
they actually cross the blood brain 

1528
01:11:04,631 --> 01:11:07,691
barrier,
the get into the brain and they disrupt 

1529
01:11:07,691 --> 01:11:10,720
dopamine release.
They disrupt serotonin release that 

1530
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:10,720
disrupt norepinephrine release,
you know,

1531
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,920
they're disrupting these 
neurotransmitters being released.

1532
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:18,380
Um,
the other thing is that there's been 

1533
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:19,860
recently a discovered that the lymphatic
system is actually directly connected to

1534
01:11:19,861 --> 01:11:24,861
the brain through the meninges.
And then it was previously thought that 

1535
01:11:24,861 --> 01:11:27,861
that was like cutoff.
The brain was protected from the 

1536
01:11:27,861 --> 01:11:30,591
lymphatic system,
but it turns out we were wrong in 

1537
01:11:30,591 --> 01:11:33,750
everything that we learned in text books
for years and years and our science 

1538
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,750
classes was not accurate.
Actually,

1539
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:38,211
we are.
Our lymphatic system is connected and 

1540
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:38,211
what that means is that our immune 
system,

1541
01:11:38,211 --> 01:11:43,040
the chemicals,
the inflammatory cytokines were 

1542
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:43,040
producing,
you know,

1543
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,670
from our immune cells are getting into 
the brain and disrupting 

1544
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:50,010
neurotransmitter release and other 
things.

1545
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:55,010
So there's obviously a really strong 
connection to inflammation and 

1546
01:11:55,141 --> 01:11:58,200
depression that's shown to be causal.
But when you think about it,

1547
01:11:58,201 --> 01:11:58,830
it's like,
well,

1548
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,570
what causes inflammation?
Okay,

1549
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:05,571
well we can talk about the sugar stuff 
because that's been shown eating a 

1550
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:06,810
terrible diet does.
But the other thing that causes it,

1551
01:12:06,811 --> 01:12:11,811
and it's what you,
you mentioned that is a stressful event 

1552
01:12:11,811 --> 01:12:13,590
in someone's life,
an emotional event,

1553
01:12:13,591 --> 01:12:14,580
you know,
a breakup,

1554
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:16,320
um,
a tragedy,

1555
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,660
work related stress,
social anxiety,

1556
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:23,661
whatever it is,
anything that causes you to release 

1557
01:12:23,661 --> 01:12:23,790
cortisol,
stress hormones,

1558
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:29,150
believe it or not,
those things actually affect 

1559
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,740
inflammation in your gut.
So it's like a two way street here.

1560
01:12:31,741 --> 01:12:34,800
I think that previously you and I have 
talked about in other podcasts,

1561
01:12:34,801 --> 01:12:38,180
like how gut microbiome bacteria,
you know,

1562
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:43,220
you can take microbiome bacteria from an
anxious mouse and transplanted into a 

1563
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:44,610
nonanxious mouse and make us anxious and
vice versa,

1564
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:44,910
right?

1565
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:49,200
So there's like some sort of gut brain 
access through with something called the

1566
01:12:49,201 --> 01:12:50,350
vagal nerve.
Well,

1567
01:12:50,351 --> 01:12:55,351
it goes both ways.
You can go from the brain down to the 

1568
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:55,351
gut.
So it's been shown that like,

1569
01:12:55,351 --> 01:12:57,510
um,
cortico releasing hormone,

1570
01:12:57,511 --> 01:12:59,230
which is a stress hormone,
you know,

1571
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,580
we get through the vagal nerve when you 
release it,

1572
01:13:02,581 --> 01:13:07,581
goes into the gut.
It activates immune cells which then 

1573
01:13:07,581 --> 01:13:10,230
activate other proteins in the gut that 
chew up there called proteases.

1574
01:13:10,231 --> 01:13:13,640
They chew up the gut barrier and then 
you start to release more influent,

1575
01:13:14,850 --> 01:13:19,850
inflammatory cells,
which then like get in contact with 

1576
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:19,850
bacteria,
more inflammation,

1577
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:20,820
and then it goes back.
It's like this feedback loop.

1578
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:25,590
So I think that's how stress also part 
of the mechanism,

1579
01:13:25,591 --> 01:13:29,520
how a stressful event and any sort of 
breakup or tragedy,

1580
01:13:29,550 --> 01:13:32,370
those sorts of things also cause 
inflammation.

1581
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:34,020
They cause inflammation.
In fact,

1582
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:39,910
it's a totally off topic,
but that's one reason why people should 

1583
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:41,940
never go and like get like blood work 
done,

1584
01:13:41,941 --> 01:13:46,590
like like a day or two after some kind 
of traumatic event because get fired.

1585
01:13:46,591 --> 01:13:47,870
Don't get your blood work done.
Yeah.

1586
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:51,360
Like do you not get your blood or break 
up or whatever?

1587
01:13:51,870 --> 01:13:53,040
Yeah,
because they will like,

1588
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:55,560
it will skew everything.
Wow.

1589
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:56,310
Everything.

1590
01:13:56,660 --> 01:13:58,120
Well that's,
that's so amazing.

1591
01:13:58,121 --> 01:14:01,960
And when you discuss this and when you 
lay all these facts out,

1592
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:07,140
it makes it seem so irresponsible that 
10 percent of the people are on this 

1593
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,380
drug.
Eleven percent,

1594
01:14:08,381 --> 01:14:11,740
excuse me,
are on this drug or whatever,

1595
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:15,970
a pet category of these drugs instead of
dealing with it.

1596
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,240
I mean it seems like it's,
it's,

1597
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:24,510
we're in a weird place when it comes to 
the holistic treatment of the human 

1598
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:24,580
body.
We're,

1599
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:28,000
we're in a very weird place where we 
have all this information now,

1600
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:33,450
but it doesn't seem like it's being 
applied when it comes to the average 

1601
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:37,381
person who is suffering the average 
person who is dealing with the disease 

1602
01:14:37,381 --> 01:14:41,250
or depression,
which I guess you could call a disease 

1603
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:45,120
and it just seems so insane that with 
all we know that we're treating it only 

1604
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:48,520
with this chemical pathway.
We're only treating with a pill.

1605
01:14:48,521 --> 01:14:50,450
This pharmacy,
you know,

1606
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:53,740
this Pharma collage,
local solution to this,

1607
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:56,860
which just seems so limited,
upsetting.

1608
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:59,370
It's so upsetting.
It's very upsetting.

1609
01:14:59,371 --> 01:15:01,740
I am like,
it's like a mission of mine,

1610
01:15:01,741 --> 01:15:02,670
you know,
I think,

1611
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:08,740
you know,
I think that the problem is multifold 

1612
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:08,740
one is that you have,
you know,

1613
01:15:08,740 --> 01:15:13,470
psychiatrists and they're trained a 
certain way and people when their 

1614
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:17,061
patients come in,
they expect that they're going to come 

1615
01:15:17,061 --> 01:15:17,061
pay.
They come in because they want a pill.

1616
01:15:17,061 --> 01:15:21,800
Most of the time they do,
they come in because they don't want to 

1617
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:21,800
deal with it and they want a pill.
And so,

1618
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:26,590
you know,
that's kind of a problem because they 

1619
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:29,250
need.
People need to understand that these 

1620
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:29,250
pills are not the magic bullet.
I mean I just told you,

1621
01:15:29,250 --> 01:15:33,531
only 40 percent people are responding to
these antidepressants that are standard 

1622
01:15:33,531 --> 01:15:35,220
of care compared to 30 percent that 
respond to placebo.

1623
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,440
A sugar pill like that is ridiculous,
you know?

1624
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:43,700
So I think I would love if there was 
some way to get a physician or I'm 

1625
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:51,260
usually their psychiatrist that people 
go to for these sorts of problems to 

1626
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,340
like push someone to say you have to go 
run,

1627
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,770
you know you're going to run six miles a
week,

1628
01:15:55,771 --> 01:15:57,210
you're going to run,
you're going to do that.

1629
01:15:57,210 --> 01:15:59,330
That is going to help you.
Like,

1630
01:15:59,370 --> 01:16:00,080
you know,
it's,

1631
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:02,160
in fact,
it's been shown.

1632
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,000
It's been shown in multiple studies.
That exercise helps improve depression.

1633
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:11,001
And one of the ways it does it very 
interestingly is that aerobic exercise 

1634
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:13,860
specifically has been shown that whole 
serotonin pathway.

1635
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,400
We're talking about inflammation 
inhibiting release of Serotonin.

1636
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:19,860
Well guess what?
Inflammation affects serotonin.

1637
01:16:19,861 --> 01:16:21,210
And another way,
Sarah,

1638
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:24,090
the precursor to Serotonin,
Serotonin Tryptofan,

1639
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:26,700
when you have inflammation.
So like I said,

1640
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:30,120
an emotional event causes inflammation,
doesn't have to be your sugar diet.

1641
01:16:30,121 --> 01:16:31,290
Okay.
What are,

1642
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,210
you know,
inflammation can be caused by your,

1643
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:38,211
your cortisol release.
When you have that inflammation in your 

1644
01:16:38,341 --> 01:16:41,040
body thinks that it needs to fight off 
something,

1645
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:42,480
but that's what it thinks.
It's like,

1646
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:43,080
okay,
this,

1647
01:16:43,081 --> 01:16:44,820
I'm sick,
I've got foreign invader,

1648
01:16:44,821 --> 01:16:47,400
I need to kill it.
And so the trip to fan,

1649
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,940
which usually is being transported into 
the brain to make Serotonin,

1650
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:54,570
which plays a role in how you feel it 
plays a role in lots of brain functions,

1651
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:58,260
then gets diverted into another pathway 
because your body's like,

1652
01:16:58,261 --> 01:16:59,700
wait a minute,
I don't need to feel good.

1653
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,220
I need to,
I need to survive and need to live.

1654
01:17:02,610 --> 01:17:07,610
So the trip to fan gets converted into 
this whole other pathway called 

1655
01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:08,280
learning,
which helps with.

1656
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:14,290
It means basically immune cells need it 
to a different immune cells needed to 

1657
01:17:14,290 --> 01:17:15,050
make different types of immune cells.
So your body is like,

1658
01:17:15,051 --> 01:17:15,500
okay,
the trip,

1659
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:17,580
your going to this other pathway,
I need more immune cell,

1660
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:22,600
blah blah blah.
But the problem is that the journey and 

1661
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,330
then gets converted into.
So now what you have is you're depleting

1662
01:17:23,331 --> 01:17:24,560
your brain of Serotonin.
Boom,

1663
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:25,460
right there,
right?

1664
01:17:25,461 --> 01:17:30,461
That's the first thing.
So if you're not sick and if you have 

1665
01:17:30,461 --> 01:17:30,980
chronic inflammation,
you're chronically stressed,

1666
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:36,250
chronically eating a terrible diet,
then you are going to constantly be 

1667
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:40,181
diverting the Serotonin.
You know the trip to fan and his other 

1668
01:17:40,181 --> 01:17:42,911
pathway.
You're going to be depleting your 

1669
01:17:42,911 --> 01:17:42,911
cranium Serotonin,
right?

1670
01:17:42,911 --> 01:17:43,250
So that's one thing.
This is a twofold problem.

1671
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:48,251
Then that whole kind of yearning thing 
gets converted into something called 

1672
01:17:48,251 --> 01:17:51,401
quinolinic acid,
which actually crosses over the blood 

1673
01:17:51,401 --> 01:17:53,771
brain barrier,
becomes a neurotoxin and also has been 

1674
01:17:53,771 --> 01:17:56,981
shown to cause depression.
So not only you're not getting 

1675
01:17:56,981 --> 01:17:56,981
Serotonin,
you're getting this gnarly shit and your

1676
01:17:56,981 --> 01:18:01,070
brain that's not supposed to be there.
I'm an exercise.

1677
01:18:01,190 --> 01:18:06,190
It's been shown specifically aerobic 
exercise causes your muscle to soak up 

1678
01:18:06,190 --> 01:18:11,111
the Kenyan running.
I'm actually another precursor to it so 

1679
01:18:11,111 --> 01:18:12,800
that it can't form quinolinic acid.
So it doesn't form the,

1680
01:18:12,850 --> 01:18:16,190
the neurotoxin park part,
but you know,

1681
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:19,160
exercise also caused you to make to.
It makes trip to fan.

1682
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:20,290
Go into your brain,
you know,

1683
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:25,440
it alleviates some of the competition 
with branch chain amino acids like 

1684
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:25,440
leucine and lysine,
leucine,

1685
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:26,330
so that's another way it's doing a 
million things,

1686
01:18:26,331 --> 01:18:27,530
brain derived neurotrophic factor.

1687
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:32,530
We talked about at the beginning of the 
podcast that also plays a role in 

1688
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:32,530
depression,
helping prevent depression,

1689
01:18:32,530 --> 01:18:33,620
you know,
so neurogenesis,

1690
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:38,680
neurogenesis,
all that stuff that helps growing new 

1691
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:38,680
brain cells,
making new connections helps.

1692
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:40,850
Helps you deal with stress.
That's why you make it.

1693
01:18:40,851 --> 01:18:45,851
When you stress your body,
it seems like there could be some sort 

1694
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:48,881
of a whole holistic approach like or 
clinic that looks at all of these 

1695
01:18:48,881 --> 01:18:52,841
factors.
It looks at all these factors and 

1696
01:18:52,841 --> 01:18:52,841
prescribes instead of just prescribing a
pill,

1697
01:18:52,841 --> 01:18:57,610
prescribes a very specific diet and 
exercise routine and maybe even 

1698
01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,021
meditation,
maybe even something that the practices 

1699
01:19:02,021 --> 01:19:03,950
or or or or enhances mindfulness or 
promotes mindfulness.

1700
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:09,100
Something that allows you to manage the 
way you're viewing and taking in 

1701
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:15,160
scenarios and scenes and events in your 
life and then processing them in a more 

1702
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:20,321
healthy manner.
It seems like all of these things would 

1703
01:19:20,321 --> 01:19:22,250
be as effective or maybe more effective 
than just a pill.

1704
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,980
I agree with you and I'm hopeful for the
future.

1705
01:19:24,981 --> 01:19:29,981
I think that the more.
There's a lot of scientists that are 

1706
01:19:29,981 --> 01:19:32,750
studying this now.
I mean it's becoming very common to look

1707
01:19:32,751 --> 01:19:34,820
in the scientific literature and,
and see,

1708
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,240
you know,
scientists researching inflammation and 

1709
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:43,271
the role of inflammation and depression 
and the role of exercise in helping 

1710
01:19:43,271 --> 01:19:43,610
treat it and the role of other,
you know,

1711
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:47,360
dietary and lifestyle factors in causing
and treating depression.

1712
01:19:47,361 --> 01:19:49,520
So I think that,
you know,

1713
01:19:49,521 --> 01:19:54,521
I,
I really am hopeful that in the near 

1714
01:19:54,521 --> 01:19:54,710
future that it,
like you said,

1715
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:58,520
it's going to be a multipronged approach
where it's not just a magic pill.

1716
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:01,380
And I'm not saying that's not also going
to be included in some,

1717
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:04,190
you know,
I'm just saying I think,

1718
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:07,710
I think the Diet lifestyle,
meditation exercise,

1719
01:20:07,711 --> 01:20:08,010
if we

1720
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:11,360
could just get that into like,
you know,

1721
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:16,500
the clinical world and if people were 
motivated enough to realize this will 

1722
01:20:16,531 --> 01:20:19,080
really help them.
Like it really will.

1723
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,170
People will be so much happier.
I really,

1724
01:20:22,230 --> 01:20:23,690
I really think so.
So um,

1725
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,890
people just don't want to fuck an 
exercise.

1726
01:20:25,891 --> 01:20:28,200
It's weird.
They would so much rather go to a doctor

1727
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:29,690
and get a pill.
It's,

1728
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:32,100
it's so strange.
It's a lot of people.

1729
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,530
Well,
it's this fear of discomfort.

1730
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:39,420
People have this extreme feeling in 
their mind,

1731
01:20:39,780 --> 01:20:41,880
uh,
when it comes to their associations with

1732
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:44,580
exercise,
they want to avoid discomfort.

1733
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:49,581
They feel like any type of exercise is 
just like something to be avoided.

1734
01:20:50,071 --> 01:20:51,570
That's not for me.
Fuck that.

1735
01:20:51,571 --> 01:20:53,130
I don't want to sweat.
I don't want to strain.

1736
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:58,460
And a lot of times this association that
they have is about the beginnings of 

1737
01:20:58,460 --> 01:20:58,800
getting in shape.

1738
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,100
It's not about once you're actually fit 
because once you're actually fit,

1739
01:21:02,101 --> 01:21:03,630
exercise is something you look forward 
to.

1740
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:05,250
It's an alleviation of stress.
It's,

1741
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,400
it feels great.
Like if I can't get a workout in,

1742
01:21:08,410 --> 01:21:09,750
I look at my schedule,
I go,

1743
01:21:09,751 --> 01:21:10,380
ah,
shit,

1744
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:15,381
I don't have any time for a workout,
which means I'm not going to get that 

1745
01:21:15,381 --> 01:21:15,720
good feeling.
And so instead of looking at it like,

1746
01:21:15,721 --> 01:21:17,730
oh,
I've got to go grunt and sweat,

1747
01:21:18,570 --> 01:21:21,720
I'm thinking I'm not going to feel good,
I'm not going to feel relaxed,

1748
01:21:21,721 --> 01:21:25,420
I'm not going to feel carefree and I'm 
not going to feel even appreciative,

1749
01:21:25,421 --> 01:21:30,421
like my appreciation of things.
And it gets enhanced greatly after 

1750
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:31,980
exercise.
I just feel better.

1751
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:35,370
I feel like I can take things in for 
what they are rather than,

1752
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,520
you know,
whatever the sensory data that I'm 

1753
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,960
getting from any event is just one more 
distraction that gets in my way.

1754
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:43,470
And,
and you know,

1755
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:48,480
that that's a lot of times how I look at
things if I'm overstressed or if I'm 

1756
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,440
working too much.
Totally beautifully put.

1757
01:21:49,500 --> 01:21:50,790
Um,
because that,

1758
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:55,820
that that's exactly like,
at least what's been shown from like 

1759
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,431
neuro imaging studies is that exercise 
does what you're talking about is that 

1760
01:21:58,431 --> 01:22:02,781
executive function.
You're talking about feeling good 

1761
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:03,350
without that sensory stuff,
which is the Amygdala,

1762
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,360
the emotional center that's been shown 
to be decreased in activity after 

1763
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:09,060
exercise where the executive function is
increased.

1764
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:10,440
So it's,
it's just,

1765
01:22:10,441 --> 01:22:12,330
it's done exactly in the right 
direction.

1766
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:13,170
Right.
So you're,

1767
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:18,680
you're able to logically think about 
this more and you feel good and it's 

1768
01:22:18,680 --> 01:22:20,280
like you're not that,
that sensory response that like gut,

1769
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:26,870
you don't feel it as much that that part
of your brain is actually quieter after 

1770
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:27,720
exercise.
Meditation does a similar thing,

1771
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:32,000
but if there was just a way to get this 
knowledge to,

1772
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,280
to pay for people to understand people 
that are adverse to exercising,

1773
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,260
you know,
if there was just some way,

1774
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:42,560
and I'm really trying to find a way 
because there are many people that I 

1775
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,621
care about in my life that are that way 
and that feel depressed and are on some 

1776
01:22:47,401 --> 01:22:52,401
sort of know antidepressant,
which doesn't really work for them 

1777
01:22:52,401 --> 01:22:52,470
still.

1778
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:58,070
And so I'm trying to find a way.
I like how like I can tell them I'm 

1779
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:00,450
having this conversation with you and 
you get it because you experience it,

1780
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,340
you exercise,
you,

1781
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:03,060
you know,
you,

1782
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:05,100
you eat healthy,
you experienced these things.

1783
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:06,070
But for someone that's

1784
01:23:06,070 --> 01:23:10,070
never experienced it,
how do you communicate it to the.

1785
01:23:10,071 --> 01:23:12,280
It's so hard for people to start 
anything new.

1786
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:17,430
It's,
it's hard for people to start a pottery 

1787
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:17,740
class that's not gonna,
you know,

1788
01:23:17,741 --> 01:23:22,741
it's not going to be involved with any 
physical pain or any stress or any 

1789
01:23:22,741 --> 01:23:23,200
exhaustion.
There's no,

1790
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,290
there's not that feeling that you get 
when you're really tired,

1791
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:31,291
you know,
the feeling that you get for me is 

1792
01:23:31,291 --> 01:23:32,140
particularly difficult.
Doing boring stuff like on an elliptical

1793
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:34,390
machine,
like elliptical machine to me.

1794
01:23:34,980 --> 01:23:36,910
Uh,
it's a great workout.

1795
01:23:36,911 --> 01:23:41,911
It's awesome if I'm at a gym because if 
I go to a gym like at a hotel and you 

1796
01:23:41,911 --> 01:23:43,300
know,
they have some bullshit weights and,

1797
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:44,830
but they have an elliptical machine.
I go,

1798
01:23:44,890 --> 01:23:47,770
okay,
if this thing has a high setting,

1799
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,920
I could get a real workout on this.
But those times when you're tired and 

1800
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:54,550
you don't want to do it,
they're so fucking boring.

1801
01:23:54,820 --> 01:23:58,900
It just,
you'd have to listen to something.

1802
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:02,410
You have to watch something like others 
stimuli has to come in,

1803
01:24:02,411 --> 01:24:07,411
in order to get you pumped up.
But I know this because I've done it a 

1804
01:24:07,411 --> 01:24:11,460
thousand times,
for someone who hasn't done it a 

1805
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:11,460
thousand times,
you,

1806
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:12,040
they get to that point like,
fuck this,

1807
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:13,630
I'm out of here.
Oh my God,

1808
01:24:13,631 --> 01:24:15,100
let me get a donut.
You know,

1809
01:24:15,101 --> 01:24:15,970
give me a coffee.
I'm gonna.

1810
01:24:15,971 --> 01:24:17,820
Go outside and smoke a cigarette.
Woo.

1811
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:18,910
I feel better,
you know,

1812
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:24,040
and it's so hard to get past that 
because we have all these connections in

1813
01:24:24,071 --> 01:24:27,250
our mind when it comes to comfort,
comfort and stress,

1814
01:24:27,251 --> 01:24:30,850
comfort and like our bodies for whatever
reason,

1815
01:24:31,260 --> 01:24:32,440
uh,
most people,

1816
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:36,220
their associations are to avoid anything
that's uncomfortable.

1817
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:41,400
But it's so illogical because when you 
look at comfort and you look at success 

1818
01:24:42,521 --> 01:24:47,521
and progress and the eventual,
the feelings of accomplishment and of 

1819
01:24:48,130 --> 01:24:52,180
getting past certain hurdles and in 
terms of like how you feel about life,

1820
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,820
a lot of those are connected to 
discomfort.

1821
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:59,140
Discomfort is your friend.
It really is like discomfort and,

1822
01:24:59,510 --> 01:25:04,510
and not being happy and content with 
certain situations in life or certain 

1823
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:06,940
feelings in life.
There are massive,

1824
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:11,170
massive motivators and they're,
they're amazing at,

1825
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:16,620
at facilitating change.
And yet our instinct is to avoid those 

1826
01:25:17,261 --> 01:25:22,261
and just sit on the couch and watch some
fucking reality show about dudes and 

1827
01:25:22,261 --> 01:25:25,420
make moonshine with our jaw open.
Like it's bizarre.

1828
01:25:25,450 --> 01:25:26,950
It is.
It's too much,

1829
01:25:26,951 --> 01:25:31,951
too much of that.
Like stimuli or where you don't have to 

1830
01:25:31,951 --> 01:25:32,710
do anything and you can still like get,
get that sensory information.

1831
01:25:33,590 --> 01:25:38,590
The need to act like to need to actually
go out there and act is so strong.

1832
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:43,450
It's such an important thing.
But yet we resisted many people.

1833
01:25:43,451 --> 01:25:44,590
I know you don't.
I don't,

1834
01:25:44,591 --> 01:25:47,290
but so many people do.
But I feel the thing,

1835
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:48,310
you know,
I don't,

1836
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:52,090
I don't allow it to work,
but I feel that fuck this,

1837
01:25:52,091 --> 01:25:53,860
I don't want to work out.
I feel it all the time.

1838
01:25:53,861 --> 01:25:58,861
Almost every time before I work out I 
have at least an inclination of blow it 

1839
01:25:58,861 --> 01:26:00,850
off.
I don't ever embrace it,

1840
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,220
but it's there.
It's there with everybody.

1841
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:08,570
Like no one is like completely 100 
percent healthy and without any 

1842
01:26:08,570 --> 01:26:08,960
resistance.

1843
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,920
Yeah.
I wonder if also that has.

1844
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:12,640
We're talking about this being a super 
ager.

1845
01:26:12,641 --> 01:26:16,170
I wonder if there is some association.
There were,

1846
01:26:16,260 --> 01:26:17,710
you know,
where we're looking at,

1847
01:26:17,770 --> 01:26:22,030
we're looking at how it's important to 
push past that uncomfortableness,

1848
01:26:22,031 --> 01:26:25,660
whether it's physical or mental and 
that's linked to being a super ager,

1849
01:26:25,870 --> 01:26:30,870
but what if it's just like the ability 
to make yourself do that is important 

1850
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:31,540
too,
right?

1851
01:26:31,541 --> 01:26:34,840
It's not just the act that you're doing,
it's not just the strenuous exercise,

1852
01:26:34,930 --> 01:26:37,960
which is obviously good and we know that
it's good from science,

1853
01:26:37,961 --> 01:26:40,840
but what if it's just being able to like
push yourself.

1854
01:26:40,841 --> 01:26:45,250
Like maybe some people don't have that 
ability for whatever reason or they just

1855
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,120
haven't tapped into it enough because I 
haven't really experienced it.

1856
01:26:48,140 --> 01:26:50,860
I think that's it.
I think it's a learned thing,

1857
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:53,110
you know,
because if I take time off,

1858
01:26:53,111 --> 01:26:58,111
like um,
I got sick recently and I couldn't work 

1859
01:26:58,111 --> 01:27:00,580
out for like a week or six days or so,
and the,

1860
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:06,030
the act of getting back into the gym,
I think a lot of ways we rely on 

1861
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:10,801
momentum.
We rely on the momentum of past 

1862
01:27:10,801 --> 01:27:12,760
experiences where you're just 
conditioned to do that.

1863
01:27:12,761 --> 01:27:17,260
It's one of the things that you do and 
for me at least when I get,

1864
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:22,320
when I would get like really disciplined
and really I get really consistent with 

1865
01:27:23,591 --> 01:27:25,930
my workouts.
One of the things that I feel,

1866
01:27:25,931 --> 01:27:30,931
I almost feel momentum.
I feel like there's like a push behind 

1867
01:27:30,931 --> 01:27:30,931
me.
Like,

1868
01:27:30,931 --> 01:27:31,420
all right,
we're,

1869
01:27:31,450 --> 01:27:32,740
you know,
like after I get out of the gym,

1870
01:27:32,741 --> 01:27:33,940
I have a really good workout.
I'm like,

1871
01:27:33,941 --> 01:27:35,140
yeah,
now I'm doing it.

1872
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:40,350
I'm doing it all the time now and I'm 
looking forward to the next time and it 

1873
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:43,411
makes that resistance much weaker and it
makes my motivation and my discipline 

1874
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:44,680
much stronger.

1875
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:48,460
I think a lot of it is based on just the
consistency,

1876
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:53,600
you know,
it's one of the things that I talked 

1877
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:53,600
about recently on the podcast.
I said,

1878
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:53,600
you know,
blowing something off.

1879
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:58,750
It's not just not good,
like blowing off of an exercise that you

1880
01:27:58,751 --> 01:28:02,350
planned is not just bad for you 
physically.

1881
01:28:02,620 --> 01:28:06,940
It's also bad mentally because then that
option is now available.

1882
01:28:07,060 --> 01:28:12,060
The option to fuck off is available and 
you did it before and you're probably 

1883
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,600
going to do it again and you'll get 
mediocre results,

1884
01:28:13,601 --> 01:28:18,601
not just in that aspect of your life,
but maybe in all aspects of your life 

1885
01:28:18,601 --> 01:28:20,500
because I think that option to fuck off 
when you embrace it,

1886
01:28:20,501 --> 01:28:25,501
that is a pathway that you might choose 
when it comes to dealing with conflict 

1887
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:27,160
and your personal life,
dealing with business decisions,

1888
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:31,630
dealing with career decisions like an 
uncomfortable decision that you might be

1889
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:36,930
faced with where you,
maybe you need to make a change as far 

1890
01:28:36,930 --> 01:28:40,381
as like what your pathway is in life,
but you don't do it instead you fuck 

1891
01:28:40,381 --> 01:28:42,910
off.
And that the inclination to fuck off.

1892
01:28:42,911 --> 01:28:47,260
I think that gathers momentum as well.
The inclination to be disciplined.

1893
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,950
That comes with momentum too.
And I think both things like you,

1894
01:28:50,951 --> 01:28:55,951
did you take a path,
the path of the healthy person or the 

1895
01:28:55,951 --> 01:28:59,611
path of the fuck off,
like both of them are available and 

1896
01:28:59,611 --> 01:28:59,611
whichever path you embrace.

1897
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:00,830
Totally.
Totally.

1898
01:29:00,831 --> 01:29:02,410
I,
I think that um,

1899
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,510
the same thing goes for like lying to.
I mean when you,

1900
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:11,660
I think it's very bad to lie,
like even if it's something that is 

1901
01:29:11,660 --> 01:29:13,210
really benign,
like what they call it,

1902
01:29:13,211 --> 01:29:14,600
a little tiny white light.
Great.

1903
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:15,540
Yeah.
That,

1904
01:29:15,541 --> 01:29:20,541
you know,
because then you start making these 

1905
01:29:20,541 --> 01:29:21,960
neural connections in your brain and you
start to like get used to doing it.

1906
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:26,990
Like you were saying and I think that it
just kind of dawned on me as you were 

1907
01:29:26,990 --> 01:29:30,921
saying this,
that with the motivation and the 

1908
01:29:30,921 --> 01:29:31,890
momentum you were talking about,
I think that's the same way.

1909
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:34,280
I think you're like building these 
neural pathways,

1910
01:29:34,281 --> 01:29:39,281
these motivation pathways and,
and that's really important for that 

1911
01:29:39,281 --> 01:29:40,050
momentum to do it again and again,
you know,

1912
01:29:40,051 --> 01:29:45,051
there's been some studies,
a few of them that have been done where 

1913
01:29:45,051 --> 01:29:48,600
you can take a person and do that direct
transcranial stimulation,

1914
01:29:48,601 --> 01:29:53,601
which I don't know much about,
but I remember these studies and 

1915
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:57,230
stimulate a certain part of the brain 
that's involved in motivation and you 

1916
01:29:57,230 --> 01:29:58,980
can motivate them to go to the gym.
So you motivate them to actually go work

1917
01:29:58,981 --> 01:29:59,810
out.
So that's good.

1918
01:29:59,830 --> 01:30:04,830
More of those electrodes and they put on
a specific area of the outside of your 

1919
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:08,431
head and then it's like a little nine 
volt batteries attached to it and it 

1920
01:30:08,431 --> 01:30:08,530
just zaps you a little bit,

1921
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:14,060
saps you a little bit and like activates
a certain brain region and that brain 

1922
01:30:14,060 --> 01:30:17,791
region.
It's activating specifically with this 

1923
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:19,861
study I was talking about actually 
there's a couple of them were involved 

1924
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:21,730
in motivation and that's probably with 
you and I.

1925
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:26,730
We already have those pathways activated
because we are constantly forcing 

1926
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:27,910
ourselves to go.
I mean I feel the same way.

1927
01:30:27,911 --> 01:30:29,350
There are times I'm like,
God,

1928
01:30:29,351 --> 01:30:32,500
I don't want to go for a run.
Like once you do it,

1929
01:30:32,501 --> 01:30:34,570
God damn me feel great.
You feel great and you know what?

1930
01:30:34,571 --> 01:30:39,571
You accomplished something so it's not 
only like you're feeling great from all 

1931
01:30:39,571 --> 01:30:42,481
the neural mechanisms that are being 
activated and all the biochemistry 

1932
01:30:42,481 --> 01:30:43,360
that's going on,
but you've accomplished something.

1933
01:30:43,361 --> 01:30:48,361
You did.
You push past them and you didn't want 

1934
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:50,221
to do.
When you feel good about doing that 

1935
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:50,221
after magnetic

1936
01:30:50,221 --> 01:30:52,770
stimulation therapy,
Wilmington woman finds motivation.

1937
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:53,800
Energy.
Yeah.

1938
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:58,120
There's a a radio lab about this,
a radiolab podcast.

1939
01:30:58,121 --> 01:31:01,540
It's called nine volt nirvana and it 
pretty good.

1940
01:31:01,570 --> 01:31:02,520
I liked it.
I love it.

1941
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:05,830
I love radio lab and it actually deals 
with the first story.

1942
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,840
The opening story is amazing because it 
deals with this woman who went to this 

1943
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,060
like sniper training,
simulation video,

1944
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:18,610
video thing that they do where they.
They put you in front,

1945
01:31:18,611 --> 01:31:22,330
they give you like a fake gun and they 
put you in front of a video screen and a

1946
01:31:22,331 --> 01:31:27,331
scenario plays out and then the scenario
there's like a terrorist attack and you 

1947
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:29,260
have to take out the bad guys and they 
did it with her and she was.

1948
01:31:29,670 --> 01:31:32,080
It's 20 minutes long and she was 
terrible.

1949
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,810
She fucked it all up.
It was just like a disaster,

1950
01:31:34,811 --> 01:31:36,280
like she didn't respond correctly.

1951
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:41,400
Then they put these electrodes,
what would you exactly call them?

1952
01:31:41,471 --> 01:31:42,970
One of those things.
It's electrodes,

1953
01:31:43,120 --> 01:31:48,120
so they put these on her brain in the or
on the outside of her head in very 

1954
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:52,171
specific areas and stimulated it and 
then recreated it and in the recreation 

1955
01:31:53,080 --> 01:31:58,080
she was 100 percent effective.
She killed all the bad guys and she went

1956
01:31:58,151 --> 01:32:00,730
through this 20 thing and when it was 
over,

1957
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:06,090
when they told her that it was over,
she thought they were fucking with her 

1958
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:06,090
because she thought it was only two 
minutes.

1959
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,510
Like,
yeah,

1960
01:32:07,511 --> 01:32:11,590
like every is incredible.
It's amazing the way she describes it as

1961
01:32:11,591 --> 01:32:13,240
amazing.
It's amazing.

1962
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:14,910
It's a little scary too.
Um,

1963
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,230
just because,
I mean it's like,

1964
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:20,170
can you like program someone to do 
something?

1965
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:23,680
There's another study that was published
like two years ago,

1966
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:27,660
same thing,
trans cranial direct stimulation and um,

1967
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:28,930
I,
I liked him,

1968
01:32:28,931 --> 01:32:33,931
so not an expert on any of this,
but I just remember this study because 

1969
01:32:33,931 --> 01:32:36,250
it was trying to investigate what part 
of the brain's fault in consciousness.

1970
01:32:36,370 --> 01:32:41,370
Right.
And so she said that the study was 

1971
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:43,831
designed in such a way where she was 
reading a book and then they zapped or 

1972
01:32:43,831 --> 01:32:46,060
in a certain part of the brain and she 
stopped reading the book,

1973
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:49,990
this woman and just looked at them like 
a Zombie,

1974
01:32:50,020 --> 01:32:51,940
like no,
nothing,

1975
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:53,020
no talk,
no.

1976
01:32:53,021 --> 01:32:54,900
And then they zapped your again and she 
started right.

1977
01:32:54,930 --> 01:32:59,930
She picked up right where she left off.
I have no recollection at all of doing.

1978
01:33:00,910 --> 01:33:02,390
So this was like,
you know,

1979
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,900
trying to figure out if this part of the
brain is involved in consciousness.

1980
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,480
Anyways,
that was a little scary.

1981
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:07,950
Well that's.
Yeah,

1982
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:08,320
that is

1983
01:33:08,450 --> 01:33:09,490
real concern,
right?

1984
01:33:09,491 --> 01:33:14,491
Because one of the things about this 
transcranial direct stimulation of 

1985
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:18,910
Radiolab podcast was that they talked 
about how many people are out there just

1986
01:33:18,911 --> 01:33:23,911
fucking experimenting where there's a 
whole community online where people are 

1987
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:28,351
talking about like experimenting with 
the voltages and experimenting with the 

1988
01:33:28,351 --> 01:33:30,760
placement and one guy did something is 
lost his sense of taste like,

1989
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:36,020
but people are buying these and like 
doing it like you can go.

1990
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:41,980
It's like you'd go to fucking radio lab.
The consequences of a world where anyone

1991
01:33:41,981 --> 01:33:45,430
with $20 in access to radio shack and 
make their own brains Zapper.

1992
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:46,240
Yeah.
That is,

1993
01:33:46,380 --> 01:33:49,330
is that from radiolab?
They're their podcast page.

1994
01:33:49,780 --> 01:33:54,780
Wow.
It's amazing because there's apparently 

1995
01:33:54,780 --> 01:33:55,750
this gigantic community of it like,
hold on a second,

1996
01:33:55,751 --> 01:33:57,310
go back up there and make that larger 
again.

1997
01:33:57,640 --> 01:34:01,190
The last couple of years.
Itd tdcs,

1998
01:34:01,260 --> 01:34:06,130
trans direct cranial stimulation has 
been all over the news.

1999
01:34:06,131 --> 01:34:09,220
Researchers claim that juicing the brain
with just 2 million amps,

2000
01:34:09,670 --> 01:34:14,670
nine volt,
but think nine volt battery battery can 

2001
01:34:14,670 --> 01:34:15,370
help with everything from learning 
languages to quitting smoking,

2002
01:34:15,371 --> 01:34:20,371
to overcoming depression.
And so they brought it into a 

2003
01:34:20,371 --> 01:34:23,530
neuroscientist,
Michael Weiss and at Wright State 

2004
01:34:23,530 --> 01:34:23,980
Research Institute into the studio to 
tell them how it works.

2005
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:25,360
Really interesting.

2006
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:26,960
Very interesting.
I,

2007
01:34:26,961 --> 01:34:31,961
you know,
I feel like in terms of like treating 

2008
01:34:31,961 --> 01:34:32,930
depression or helping people get 
motivated to go to the gym,

2009
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:35,060
it may really have relevance,

2010
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:39,770
but it also might be like slapping a 
supercharger on an old chevy

2011
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:42,260
below the fucking engine on the thing.
You know,

2012
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:43,280
it's true.
It's true.

2013
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:44,990
I mean,
you don't really,

2014
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:47,240
you don't,
we don't really know enough about what's

2015
01:34:47,241 --> 01:34:52,241
going.
I certainly wouldn't be experimenting 

2016
01:34:52,241 --> 01:34:52,241
with that.
Amen.

2017
01:34:52,241 --> 01:34:52,241
Now let's do it.
Fuck it.

2018
01:34:52,241 --> 01:34:57,070
I'm thinking about going to radio shack 
radio shack right after I get outta 

2019
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:57,170
here.
Not really,

2020
01:34:57,171 --> 01:34:57,920
but sort of.

2021
01:34:58,250 --> 01:34:59,510
I mean,
it's just interesting.

2022
01:34:59,570 --> 01:34:59,840
It's,
uh,

2023
01:34:59,841 --> 01:35:04,841
it's,
it's amazing that we are really some 

2024
01:35:04,841 --> 01:35:07,580
sort of a system and you can choose that
system like electricity here,

2025
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,110
a little vitamin,
they're,

2026
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:10,210
you know,
a little,

2027
01:35:10,211 --> 01:35:12,080
um,
Broccoli sprouts here.

2028
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:17,290
It's like,
that's the weirdest thing about people 

2029
01:35:17,290 --> 01:35:20,211
and one of the weirdest things about 
people is how variable we are depending 

2030
01:35:20,211 --> 01:35:22,940
upon what we put inside of us.
And we don't think of it that way.

2031
01:35:22,941 --> 01:35:25,280
Most of the time we think of ourselves 
as ourselves.

2032
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,830
You know,
I'm sure you think of yourself as Rhonda

2033
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:32,830
Patrick,
but Rhonda Patrick relies on a bunch of 

2034
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:32,830
fucking chemicals to be Rhonda Patrick,
right?

2035
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:37,721
I mean,
there's a lot of stuff going on in 

2036
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:37,721
there.
It's not just,

2037
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:39,740
it's not this one like this is a laptop,
you know,

2038
01:35:39,741 --> 01:35:43,340
I'm not adding shit to this thing.
Like I can put programs in it and stuff.

2039
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:45,230
But I mean this is the,
everything in there.

2040
01:35:45,231 --> 01:35:46,640
It's kind of worked out.
You know,

2041
01:35:46,641 --> 01:35:48,950
there's a processor,
there's a motherboard,

2042
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:53,951
it's all the,
all this junk is in place and the 

2043
01:35:53,951 --> 01:35:54,770
electricity plugs into the back and it's
not really variable.

2044
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:55,770
You know,
the,

2045
01:35:55,771 --> 01:36:00,771
the human body.
So fucking variable and pliable and 

2046
01:36:00,771 --> 01:36:04,091
malleable.
There's so many different things that 

2047
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,920
you can do to make yourself better.
Like I had this conversation with a 

2048
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:09,431
friend of mine who's a not a physical 
fitness guy and he's kind of a realist 

2049
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:11,270
and nihilist,
I guess you would say.

2050
01:36:11,510 --> 01:36:15,110
I never say that word.
I just read it and he's,

2051
01:36:15,140 --> 01:36:20,140
you know,
he's a little bit of a curmudgeon and 

2052
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:20,140
he's like,
yeah,

2053
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:20,140
what's the point?
You know,

2054
01:36:20,140 --> 01:36:23,150
like really what is appointment?
You're always doing all his martial arts

2055
01:36:23,151 --> 01:36:24,080
and exercise.
I go,

2056
01:36:24,081 --> 01:36:27,470
okay,
if I could give you a pill and that pill

2057
01:36:27,530 --> 01:36:30,320
would turn you essentially into a super 
person,

2058
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,420
like you can do shit that you can't do 
now.

2059
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:34,180
You could lift weights,
you can't lift,

2060
01:36:34,370 --> 01:36:39,170
you could beat people up,
you could do physical fitness fits feats

2061
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:44,200
that,
you know what you right now are totally 

2062
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,530
insurmountable and outside the realm of 
possibility which take that pill.

2063
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:46,010
So,
so,

2064
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,600
so simple.
And he goes,

2065
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:48,470
no,
I wouldn't go.

2066
01:36:48,471 --> 01:36:49,670
You wouldn't?
Okay.

2067
01:36:50,050 --> 01:36:55,050
Um,
if I could give you a pill that would 

2068
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:57,941
prevent you from being a decaying old 
man and you could stay in the state you 

2069
01:36:57,941 --> 01:36:59,270
are right now,
would you take that?

2070
01:36:59,630 --> 01:37:00,110
He's like,
yeah,

2071
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:01,550
I probably would take that.
I go,

2072
01:37:01,551 --> 01:37:03,700
well that's how it feels like to me.
Motherfucker.

2073
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:07,130
Like that's how it feels like to me.
Like you're a decaying old man,

2074
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:08,630
you know,
like he's not much.

2075
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:12,080
I think he's a year older than me,
but he looks like he's 50 years old.

2076
01:37:12,081 --> 01:37:17,081
I mean he made his body's all humped,
he's cute legs go ponch it doesn't have 

2077
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:17,780
any muscle tone.

2078
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:18,620
And I'm like,
dude,

2079
01:37:18,650 --> 01:37:22,340
all of that is just physical fitness.
Like you're not broken.

2080
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:27,480
Like there's nothing wrong with you.
But if you got on like a steady yoga 

2081
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:31,421
routine and started doing some 
resistance training and started maybe 

2082
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:32,060
swimming or something like that a year 
from now,

2083
01:37:32,061 --> 01:37:33,830
you would have a completely different 
body,

2084
01:37:34,100 --> 01:37:35,210
you know?
And so talking to me,

2085
01:37:35,211 --> 01:37:38,090
I'm like,
I've done it my whole life.

2086
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:41,990
So like stuff that I can do stuff that 
you don't think is possible.

2087
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:46,300
And to me it's like two times a week,
three times a week I do that stuff like,

2088
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:51,310
this is not like your body is like a 
race car that you can juice up yourself.

2089
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:55,950
Like you can add the fat tires,
you can add the improved suspension,

2090
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:58,110
you can beef up the horsepower in the 
engine,

2091
01:37:58,111 --> 01:38:03,111
you could do all that yourself.
Or You could just choose to have this 

2092
01:38:03,111 --> 01:38:04,140
shitty body that's always fallen apart 
on you.

2093
01:38:04,220 --> 01:38:06,610
Right?
I mean you're,

2094
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,900
you and I are both choosing to do as you
know,

2095
01:38:08,901 --> 01:38:13,901
we're,
we're both kind of obsessed with 

2096
01:38:13,901 --> 01:38:13,901
nutrition and aging and being,
you know,

2097
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:18,950
as,
as optimal as we can in terms of our 

2098
01:38:18,950 --> 01:38:21,241
health.
But ultimately what we are doing is 

2099
01:38:21,241 --> 01:38:22,380
delaying the aging process by switching 
on all these switches and like,

2100
01:38:22,400 --> 01:38:27,400
you know,
exercise and getting all the 

2101
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,171
micronutrients and avoiding the refined 
sugar which is causing inflammation and,

2102
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:34,450
and all that stuff.
And it's really because that stuff is 

2103
01:38:34,450 --> 01:38:35,090
part of the aging process and it 
accelerates the aging process.

2104
01:38:35,091 --> 01:38:38,180
You know,
where I don't think people that don't do

2105
01:38:38,181 --> 01:38:42,230
this stuff realize that it's like,
it's not just about looking good,

2106
01:38:42,290 --> 01:38:47,290
it's about aging.
It's about like being older and being 

2107
01:38:47,290 --> 01:38:51,821
fit and being mentally sharp and not 
being degenerate and decrepit and how.

2108
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:54,890
I mean,
how awful would that be?

2109
01:38:54,891 --> 01:38:56,840
It'd be like 60,
which is young.

2110
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:59,490
I mean 60 is still young and to be like,
you know,

2111
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:01,180
yeah.
Broken,

2112
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:03,170
which is really common.
It's super common,

2113
01:39:03,171 --> 01:39:05,330
especially for sedentary people.
Exactly.

2114
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:10,370
It's under Ip.
Most sedentary people are people that 

2115
01:39:10,370 --> 01:39:12,821
also choose to eat terrible diets,
so it's like not only are they 

2116
01:39:12,821 --> 01:39:17,411
sedentary,
they're also eating crappy food and not 

2117
01:39:17,411 --> 01:39:20,720
getting all the nutrients they need.
So it's just like this mega explosion,

2118
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:22,430
dynamite of just bad

2119
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:27,870
increasing inflammation.
I think intelligent people like my 

2120
01:39:27,870 --> 01:39:31,071
friend,
he is intelligent and I think he 

2121
01:39:31,071 --> 01:39:33,381
connects vanity with those things and he
thinks vanities for fools and he thinks 

2122
01:39:33,381 --> 01:39:34,230
it's a,
it's a,

2123
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:37,890
it's a trait that he finds 
reprehensible.

2124
01:39:37,891 --> 01:39:40,500
He just doesn't like it.
He sees people that are,

2125
01:39:40,940 --> 01:39:43,140
you know,
whatever.

2126
01:39:43,141 --> 01:39:47,610
Maybe it's flashy clothes,
maybe it's the way they wear their hair,

2127
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:49,560
whatever it is he thinks is 
preposterous.

2128
01:39:49,561 --> 01:39:52,230
He connects that with physical fitness.
I'm like,

2129
01:39:52,231 --> 01:39:57,231
man,
but it's your vehicle and it's like how 

2130
01:39:57,231 --> 01:39:57,960
you get through this life and it's how 
you think it's,

2131
01:39:58,020 --> 01:40:03,020
it's,
it's so many different things that are 

2132
01:40:03,020 --> 01:40:04,941
all connected into one super organism,
which is the life that you're living.

2133
01:40:05,991 --> 01:40:06,540
It's,
it's,

2134
01:40:06,890 --> 01:40:08,420
you know,
I mean,

2135
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:13,710
I think everybody knows now.
I mean it's not something we grew up 

2136
01:40:13,710 --> 01:40:16,941
knowing,
but everybody knows now about your gut 

2137
01:40:16,941 --> 01:40:16,941
biome.

2138
01:40:16,941 --> 01:40:19,820
This is a really huge factor in how you 
exist as an organism or as maybe even an

2139
01:40:21,991 --> 01:40:25,230
organism is the wrong word because we're
essentially ecosystems,

2140
01:40:25,710 --> 01:40:26,280
you know,
and we're,

2141
01:40:26,281 --> 01:40:31,281
we're in charge.
This weird consciousness that has all 

2142
01:40:31,281 --> 01:40:34,551
this resistance and has all this 
inclination towards comfort and fucking 

2143
01:40:34,551 --> 01:40:38,751
off and blowing things off is what is in
charge of making all these things happen

2144
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:44,300
that keep this ecosystem healthy.
It's almost like if earth itself had 

2145
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,500
like a shitty manager,
you know,

2146
01:40:46,501 --> 01:40:50,610
if like there was a manager of a natural
manager of earth that was like,

2147
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,950
Oh God,
who cares if it rains?

2148
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:55,900
Oh God,
you know,

2149
01:40:55,901 --> 01:40:57,280
like,
let's let you know I'm,

2150
01:40:57,310 --> 01:41:00,160
I'm going to stop growing things.
I don't give a shit anymore.

2151
01:41:00,161 --> 01:41:03,490
It's all stupid anyway.
I mean it's literally like the,

2152
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,120
the,
just blow it out.

2153
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:08,110
Fuck it.
Let's just kill all the life.

2154
01:41:08,380 --> 01:41:09,910
It's all going to die eventually.
I mean,

2155
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,920
the sun only lasts 7 billion years and 
see that is the perspective a lot of 

2156
01:41:14,920 --> 01:41:16,930
people take with aging where it's like,
well,

2157
01:41:16,931 --> 01:41:18,340
you're going to die.
You're going to age.

2158
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:20,050
You can't stop aging.
And it's like,

2159
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:21,040
yes,
you're right.

2160
01:41:21,100 --> 01:41:24,850
But that's not the point.
The point is to age better.

2161
01:41:25,170 --> 01:41:30,170
Like that's the point.
The point is to increase your health 

2162
01:41:30,170 --> 01:41:30,170
span,
you know?

2163
01:41:30,170 --> 01:41:30,640
And that is,
we know is possible.

2164
01:41:30,641 --> 01:41:32,050
Like that can be.
There's some,

2165
01:41:32,110 --> 01:41:37,110
there's some of these centenarians and 
Supercentenarians I've seen that are 

2166
01:41:37,110 --> 01:41:37,250
like in,
you know,

2167
01:41:37,270 --> 01:41:42,270
over 100 years old and they're like 
riding bikes and racing and it's like 

2168
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,390
they're old.

2169
01:41:43,450 --> 01:41:46,030
They are very old.
They're experiencing a very good quality

2170
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:51,031
of life and experiencing a quality of 
life that these other people that don't 

2171
01:41:51,031 --> 01:41:55,741
exercise feel.
They physically feel their own body 

2172
01:41:55,741 --> 01:41:56,590
diminishing and they just feel it's 
inevitable.

2173
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,820
It's just,
it is what it is.

2174
01:41:57,821 --> 01:41:59,770
You're wasting your time.
You're out there running around,

2175
01:41:59,950 --> 01:42:03,130
but no we're not because this experience
right now,

2176
01:42:03,131 --> 01:42:06,100
it's not like no one's under the 
illusion that you're gonna live forever,

2177
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:11,280
but you are enhancing the experience 
that you're currently involved in right 

2178
01:42:11,591 --> 01:42:14,050
now and you are alive.
You are alive.

2179
01:42:14,080 --> 01:42:19,080
You do experience this life,
but do you experience this life 

2180
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:19,080
optimally?
Is it,

2181
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:23,340
is it as enjoyable as it can be?
And we all know that there's a spectrum 

2182
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:24,970
for that.
Enjoyability like we've all had times in

2183
01:42:24,971 --> 01:42:29,971
our life where it's not been so great 
and then times in a life where 

2184
01:42:29,971 --> 01:42:30,100
everything came together like what a 
fucking great day,

2185
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:30,560
Woo.

2186
01:42:30,860 --> 01:42:35,860
Like make more of those,
like you could make more of those and 

2187
01:42:35,860 --> 01:42:39,301
then the whole things better.
And I think when that whole thing is 

2188
01:42:39,301 --> 01:42:39,520
better,
it affects everybody.

2189
01:42:39,521 --> 01:42:44,521
You touch everybody that's around you,
everybody you come in contact with and 

2190
01:42:44,521 --> 01:42:45,880
that in turn,
I mean it sounds so grandiose,

2191
01:42:45,881 --> 01:42:49,480
but in turn can affect the entire race 
of human beings.

2192
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,950
I agree.
Totally.

2193
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,220
Totally agree.
And I love the way you put it about like

2194
01:42:54,240 --> 01:42:55,900
the feeling good.
It's not just about,

2195
01:42:56,650 --> 01:42:58,690
you know,
staving off cancer,

2196
01:42:58,691 --> 01:43:03,691
you know,
it's not just about what's going to 

2197
01:43:03,691 --> 01:43:03,691
happen 20,
30 years from now.

2198
01:43:03,691 --> 01:43:04,630
It's about now it's about not being 
depressed.

2199
01:43:04,631 --> 01:43:05,440
We know that,
you know,

2200
01:43:05,441 --> 01:43:07,570
it's about feeling better.
It's about being smarter,

2201
01:43:07,571 --> 01:43:09,040
it's about having more executive 
function,

2202
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:12,700
having more longterm planning,
less emotional Amygdala,

2203
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:16,300
you know,
anxiety that is like right here,

2204
01:43:16,301 --> 01:43:17,470
right now that is happening.

2205
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:18,400
That is so,
you know,

2206
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:20,950
it's not just longterm effects which you
also are,

2207
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:23,530
you know,
also effecting which is very good.

2208
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:26,500
So it's like a win win.
You're not just affecting the future.

2209
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:29,200
You're affecting right now how you feel,
how you perform,

2210
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:30,010
you know,
it's,

2211
01:43:30,830 --> 01:43:35,830
yeah,
it's an important concept that I 

2212
01:43:35,830 --> 01:43:39,360
continue to try to get across to people 
and it also will optimize everything 

2213
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:40,840
else you do,
whether it's creative pursuits,

2214
01:43:40,841 --> 01:43:42,880
whether it's relationships that you get 
into.

2215
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:47,920
A lot of those things are predicated on 
how you feel as you enter them,

2216
01:43:47,921 --> 01:43:51,040
how you feel when you participate in 
them and you can enhance,

2217
01:43:51,740 --> 01:43:52,010
you can

2218
01:43:52,010 --> 01:43:53,370
enhance that.
And I mean,

2219
01:43:54,050 --> 01:43:59,050
there's a weird thing that people do 
where they want to pretend they're not 

2220
01:43:59,050 --> 01:43:59,050
trying to do better.
You know,

2221
01:43:59,050 --> 01:43:59,510
I'm fine.
Everything's great.

2222
01:43:59,570 --> 01:44:01,490
Like it's not,
that's not true.

2223
01:44:01,491 --> 01:44:02,000
You're,
you're,

2224
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:04,550
you're putting out effort.
It's a matter of you.

2225
01:44:05,060 --> 01:44:10,060
You have a mindset or you have a 
connection in your brain with putting 

2226
01:44:10,281 --> 01:44:15,281
out more effort and connecting that to 
discomfort and that connecting things to

2227
01:44:15,771 --> 01:44:17,150
discomfort.
Have you ever,

2228
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:22,470
um,
Steven Pressfield has a book called the 

2229
01:44:22,470 --> 01:44:23,300
war of art have brought up in this 
podcast a million times.

2230
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:26,480
I actually have a copy of it.
I'll give it to you afterwards because I

2231
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:28,840
bought like 50 copies of it.
I handed it,

2232
01:44:28,850 --> 01:44:32,390
I handed out to people,
it's great and he's been on this podcast

2233
01:44:32,391 --> 01:44:37,391
before and his book is essentially 
mostly about the creative pursuit and 

2234
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:42,671
it's about resistance that people feel 
when you know you should write or you 

2235
01:44:42,671 --> 01:44:45,440
know you should paint or whatever it 
used to sculpt whatever these things are

2236
01:44:45,441 --> 01:44:50,441
that you pursue and that there's this 
thing that comes up that tries to keep 

2237
01:44:50,441 --> 01:44:53,090
you from doing that,
this resistance,

2238
01:44:53,330 --> 01:44:55,310
and he's like,
this is a battle that you will fight for

2239
01:44:55,311 --> 01:44:56,120
the rest of your life.

2240
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:58,610
But the key is to fight it,
not to give in,

2241
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,200
don't give in to that resistance to 
fight,

2242
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:04,910
just to fight that resistance and in 
doing so everyday you do so you have won

2243
01:45:04,911 --> 01:45:07,460
the battle for that day and you will 
continue to fight that battle.

2244
01:45:07,610 --> 01:45:09,950
And if you continue to fight that battle
with that same mindset,

2245
01:45:09,951 --> 01:45:12,830
you will win.
And this is a guy that like up until the

2246
01:45:12,831 --> 01:45:15,200
time he was 40 years old,
he was basically a loser.

2247
01:45:15,470 --> 01:45:17,780
He wasn't doing well.
It was like a failed writer.

2248
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:20,900
And then he kind of just figured it out 
and got his shit together and then wrote

2249
01:45:20,901 --> 01:45:24,350
books about it and now he's a really 
accomplished author and it's a,

2250
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:26,720
it's an amazing story and he's a really 
cool guy too.

2251
01:45:26,721 --> 01:45:29,250
I had them on for a podcast and you 
know,

2252
01:45:29,470 --> 01:45:34,470
in his enthusiasm and the way he 
approaches it in this book because it's 

2253
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:39,520
very pragmatic,
like you can see the steps and he left.

2254
01:45:39,590 --> 01:45:43,970
He lays it all out in a way that's very 
easy to digest.

2255
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:45,560
Awesome.
Yeah,

2256
01:45:45,620 --> 01:45:47,270
I'd love to read it.
I mean,

2257
01:45:47,310 --> 01:45:47,890
I,
I,

2258
01:45:47,950 --> 01:45:51,160
I think that's something that's a very 
important part of,

2259
01:45:51,220 --> 01:45:56,220
um,
of the human experience is pushing past 

2260
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:57,590
that resistance to whatever.
And,

2261
01:45:57,660 --> 01:45:58,550
and you're right,
it,

2262
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:01,130
once you do it,
you get better at it next time too.

2263
01:46:01,250 --> 01:46:01,970
I mean,
it's still there,

2264
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:03,590
but you,
you do get better at it next time.

2265
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:08,770
There's also a problem.
I think that what it comes up when you 

2266
01:46:08,770 --> 01:46:11,870
and I are doing these podcasts where 
there's so much data,

2267
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:17,380
there is so much to take in.
I mean we have done how many podcasts 

2268
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:17,680
now?
Like sixth or seventh?

2269
01:46:17,681 --> 01:46:21,920
One a lot and every one of them is three
hours of like,

2270
01:46:21,921 --> 01:46:24,530
what the fuck,
how does she know all this?

2271
01:46:24,531 --> 01:46:27,080
And just notebooks,
like when I put it up on twitter,

2272
01:46:27,280 --> 01:46:27,960
you know,
the,

2273
01:46:27,970 --> 01:46:29,540
that you're going to be here.
Everybody's like,

2274
01:46:29,541 --> 01:46:31,220
get your notebook out.
And I mean,

2275
01:46:31,221 --> 01:46:34,460
that's like the number one response in 
the comments.

2276
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:35,820
That's awesome.
Yeah.

2277
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:37,550
Cool.
There's a lot of stuff that I,

2278
01:46:37,790 --> 01:46:39,750
I enjoy learning,
you know,

2279
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,710
so it's something that I like to learn 
about,

2280
01:46:42,770 --> 01:46:45,200
um,
things that can make me better or things

2281
01:46:45,201 --> 01:46:47,330
that can make other people better 
mentally,

2282
01:46:47,331 --> 01:46:49,380
physically healthy,
aging and all that.

2283
01:46:49,381 --> 01:46:49,980
So I like to

2284
01:46:49,980 --> 01:46:51,540
share that with,
with people.

2285
01:46:52,290 --> 01:46:53,810
Have you heard of this?
Um,

2286
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:59,300
we're talking about an aging pill and it
kind of came into my mind when you were 

2287
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:00,980
talking about giving your friend that if
you could take a pill I could,

2288
01:47:01,220 --> 01:47:03,900
you know,
delay the way you age or make you live.

2289
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:06,210
You no longer are better.
Um,

2290
01:47:06,510 --> 01:47:09,420
have you heard of like nicotinamide 
riboside or Nicotinamide Adenine?

2291
01:47:09,540 --> 01:47:11,610
Dinucleotide not at all.
Not at all.

2292
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:12,480
No.
Oh Wow.

2293
01:47:12,481 --> 01:47:13,560
It's like,
it's kind of like,

2294
01:47:13,561 --> 01:47:18,561
I guess it's maybe it's not made its way
into the popular media media as much as 

2295
01:47:18,561 --> 01:47:23,241
I thought,
but it's definitely blown up in the 

2296
01:47:23,241 --> 01:47:23,241
science.
So,

2297
01:47:23,241 --> 01:47:23,241
um,
there's,

2298
01:47:23,241 --> 01:47:25,700
it's so nicotinamide riboside and 
nicotine,

2299
01:47:25,750 --> 01:47:29,580
my model nucleotide there,
they're like precursor forums to vitamin

2300
01:47:29,581 --> 01:47:34,581
B three and in the body they get 
converted into something called Nad.

2301
01:47:35,300 --> 01:47:40,300
And Nad is something that you absolutely
have your mitochondria which make energy

2302
01:47:40,890 --> 01:47:42,270
have to have to make energy.

2303
01:47:42,270 --> 01:47:45,240
Like you can't oxidize fat,
fatty acids,

2304
01:47:45,241 --> 01:47:50,241
you can't oxidize glucose,
you can't make energy from any of the 

2305
01:47:50,241 --> 01:47:52,881
food you eat without an because your 
mitochondria and need it to make the 

2306
01:47:52,881 --> 01:47:56,151
energy.
So it's very important for your 

2307
01:47:56,151 --> 01:47:56,151
mitochondria to function,
to make energy.

2308
01:47:56,151 --> 01:47:56,300
But also,
um,

2309
01:47:57,060 --> 01:48:01,260
it's very important.
It's like the levels of Nad always rise.

2310
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:03,330
Like when you're fasting in between 
meals.

2311
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,740
So like between breakfast and lunch or 
breakfast and dinner,

2312
01:48:06,750 --> 01:48:11,750
whatever your nad levels go up like 
slowly after a meal and during the 

2313
01:48:11,750 --> 01:48:14,370
fasting state and also when you 
exercise.

2314
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:16,440
So the levels of Nad will,
will,

2315
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:18,720
will go up somewhat.
But I'm the,

2316
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:21,240
so these are precursors to Nad,
right?

2317
01:48:21,720 --> 01:48:25,650
I'm telling you this because this is 
kind of the studies that have been done.

2318
01:48:25,651 --> 01:48:30,651
All the mechanisms go back to this 
forming nad nad is something that 

2319
01:48:30,651 --> 01:48:30,810
decreases with age.

2320
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:32,130
Um,
it's something that,

2321
01:48:32,131 --> 01:48:32,630
you know,
it's just,

2322
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:35,310
it's very important for aging.
Anytime you're inflamed,

2323
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:38,550
all the nad gets sucked,
sucked up into that inflammation because

2324
01:48:38,551 --> 01:48:40,020
your energy to,
you know,

2325
01:48:40,500 --> 01:48:45,500
energy,
it requires energy to like have your 

2326
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:45,960
immune cells to be activated and 
fighting off whatever they think they're

2327
01:48:45,961 --> 01:48:49,350
fighting off whether or not it's refined
sugar or actual infection,

2328
01:48:49,620 --> 01:48:50,750
but,
um,

2329
01:48:51,420 --> 01:48:52,590
DNA damage,
sex it up.

2330
01:48:52,591 --> 01:48:53,370
So it's like,
you know,

2331
01:48:53,371 --> 01:48:58,371
it's,
it's basically a limiting factor in a 

2332
01:48:58,371 --> 01:49:01,011
lot of ways.
So there's been all these studies over 

2333
01:49:01,011 --> 01:49:01,011
the past,
I don't know,

2334
01:49:01,011 --> 01:49:03,420
I'd say like six years,
probably now,

2335
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:07,710
five or six years where various 
scientists are,

2336
01:49:07,890 --> 01:49:08,850
have been,
um,

2337
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,300
feeding mice.
You know,

2338
01:49:11,510 --> 01:49:16,510
this nick attendant,
my driver's side or nicotine mind 

2339
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:16,510
monitor nucleotide,
and they're finding that,

2340
01:49:16,510 --> 01:49:16,620
you know,
for example,

2341
01:49:16,621 --> 01:49:19,050
if you feed them nicotine and wide 
mononuclear nucleotide,

2342
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:23,040
um,
it delays aging in their liver and their

2343
01:49:23,041 --> 01:49:26,790
bones in their eyes,
their muscle.

2344
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,640
I'm there.
So it's basically like their tissues are

2345
01:49:29,641 --> 01:49:32,610
aging better,
they have enhanced endurance,

2346
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:37,640
they have a better mitochondrial 
function and these are doses like human 

2347
01:49:37,640 --> 01:49:41,190
equivalent dose to like 24 milligrams 
per kilogram body weight per day,

2348
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:46,220
which could be a lot if you weigh a lot,
but I'm showing that it improves 

2349
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:50,481
mitochondrial function and nicotine 
riboside which gets converted into 

2350
01:49:50,481 --> 01:49:54,241
nicotinamide Adenine dinucleotide.
It's kind of confusing on it just 

2351
01:49:54,241 --> 01:49:54,241
anyways.
Lots of studies on that.

2352
01:49:54,241 --> 01:49:58,621
Showing that it like if you give it to 
mice that have some sort of 

2353
01:49:58,621 --> 01:49:58,930
mitochondrial defect in their muscles,
all atrophying,

2354
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:04,230
a Co completely reverses that.
Their muscles are like they're making 

2355
01:50:04,230 --> 01:50:07,561
lots of Mitochondria and they're 
improves muscle function and enhanced 

2356
01:50:07,561 --> 01:50:09,670
performance anyways.
Like you get the idea like lots and lots

2357
01:50:09,671 --> 01:50:14,671
of animal studies.
Recently there's been a human clinical 

2358
01:50:14,671 --> 01:50:17,491
trial done with nicotinamide riboside 
and that just to show that it's safe and

2359
01:50:18,431 --> 01:50:20,910
that it actually does increase nad 
levels in,

2360
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:22,570
in human blood,
which it does,

2361
01:50:22,900 --> 01:50:27,900
um,
even even as low as a 100 milligrams 

2362
01:50:27,900 --> 01:50:28,690
dose a day and this is a supplement that
people can buy.

2363
01:50:28,730 --> 01:50:33,010
So the nicotine in my mano,
nucleotide is not,

2364
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:36,730
that's found in Broccoli.
Broccoli's really high in it.

2365
01:50:37,370 --> 01:50:40,770
Cucumbers are really high in it.
Cabbage is high and in May,

2366
01:50:41,200 --> 01:50:46,200
but nicotine might arrive aside which 
gets converted into that which 

2367
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:49,180
eventually makes its way to nad is,
it is a supplement.

2368
01:50:49,450 --> 01:50:52,120
So a few scientists actually,
um,

2369
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:54,220
some big name scientist in the aging 
field,

2370
01:50:54,221 --> 01:50:58,030
like linen warranty and a couple of 
others have started a supplement company

2371
01:50:58,450 --> 01:51:00,830
called a Elisia.
Come to me,

2372
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,100
me that pad,
I've,

2373
01:51:02,101 --> 01:51:04,870
I forgot to put a pad over here.
I've got to write that down.

2374
01:51:05,150 --> 01:51:05,990
Thank you.
Yeah.

2375
01:51:06,050 --> 01:51:09,640
And so it's called a lease iom and it 
has nicotine in them.

2376
01:51:09,700 --> 01:51:11,560
Like the Matt Damon Movie.
Yeah.

2377
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:14,410
E L Y S I,
u m.

2378
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:15,790
Oh look at this.
They have it.

2379
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:19,570
So it has nicotine in my and by the way,
I know it's affiliation.

2380
01:51:19,570 --> 01:51:23,170
I don't have any affiliation with any,
a supplement company.

2381
01:51:23,171 --> 01:51:28,171
What is the company?
I think it's a company called the 

2382
01:51:28,171 --> 01:51:28,180
company's called Lisa.
Whereas the supplements,

2383
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:33,210
the supplements called Elysium.
But how do you spell the actual 

2384
01:51:33,210 --> 01:51:34,960
nicotinamide?
Nicotinamide,

2385
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:40,080
and I see a nick o,
t I n a,

2386
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:45,451
m I d e right beside R I b o s I d e.
yeah.

2387
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:52,390
So it's interesting.
It's also there's another company I 

2388
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:54,670
think thorne makes makes one.
I'm with it in it,

2389
01:51:54,671 --> 01:51:55,800
but born.
Yeah.

2390
01:51:55,860 --> 01:52:00,860
Thorn.
The thing that's interesting about the 

2391
01:52:00,860 --> 01:52:00,960
Elysium though that I found,
because I started looking into this,

2392
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:04,000
I've met lenny warranty.
He's the guy who um,

2393
01:52:04,540 --> 01:52:09,540
who,
whose lab the whole pathway that Rivera 

2394
01:52:09,540 --> 01:52:12,820
trawl Axon was discovered that act.
So Nad switches on this whole,

2395
01:52:12,821 --> 01:52:17,821
like genetic pathway,
that's like anti aging and it just 

2396
01:52:17,821 --> 01:52:18,130
changes all these epigenetic factors.
Okay.

2397
01:52:18,370 --> 01:52:21,130
Without getting into all the details and
like boring people to death,

2398
01:52:21,160 --> 01:52:25,540
it's like it actually,
it's basically nad levels rise that acts

2399
01:52:25,541 --> 01:52:28,600
as a switch.
This rises Nad levels.

2400
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:30,760
So this is a supplement that's rising 
nad levels,

2401
01:52:31,030 --> 01:52:36,030
but what's interesting about the 
illicium is that it has something in it 

2402
01:52:36,030 --> 01:52:38,791
called terrorists still being Charles 
still being is found in blueberries and 

2403
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:40,630
blueberries is probably the one of the 
best sources of it.

2404
01:52:41,290 --> 01:52:46,290
But what was so interesting,
I was trying to figure out like why are 

2405
01:52:46,290 --> 01:52:47,020
they putting,
trying to figure out why they're putting

2406
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:52,040
terrell still being with the 
nicotinamide riboside because 

2407
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,140
nicotinamide riboside is affecting nad 
it's affecting mitochondrial biogenesis,

2408
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:56,900
which it's been shown to increase 
mitochondrial biogenesis.

2409
01:52:57,170 --> 01:52:58,610
Like I said,
these mice and mice,

2410
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,270
you know,
we're,

2411
01:52:59,271 --> 01:53:04,271
we're um,
we're performing like 42 percent better 

2412
01:53:04,271 --> 01:53:06,200
at different endurance activities after 
being supplemented with this.

2413
01:53:06,380 --> 01:53:08,120
So that's insane.
Yeah.

2414
01:53:08,180 --> 01:53:13,180
It's.
But they're giving a lot like the 32 to 

2415
01:53:13,180 --> 01:53:14,250
24 to 32 milligrams per kilogram body 
weight.

2416
01:53:14,251 --> 01:53:16,840
It would be the human equivalent dose.
So you know,

2417
01:53:16,940 --> 01:53:17,900
figure that out.
That's a lot.

2418
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:20,630
That's probably like four grams a day or
something like that.

2419
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:24,320
Right.
For like a 160 or 80 pound person,

2420
01:53:24,500 --> 01:53:25,490
something like that.
I don't know.

2421
01:53:25,520 --> 01:53:30,520
Anyways,
the Terrell still beans interesting 

2422
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:30,520
because,
well,

2423
01:53:30,520 --> 01:53:31,490
in and of itself,
it's interesting because it's actually,

2424
01:53:31,491 --> 01:53:35,130
it's chemically similar to raspberry 
trawl and um,

2425
01:53:35,630 --> 01:53:40,630
but it's four times more bioavailable 
than was trial and it actually has been 

2426
01:53:40,630 --> 01:53:44,711
compared side by side in mouse studies 
to like to a different mouse studies 

2427
01:53:45,231 --> 01:53:50,231
that I've looked at cognitive function 
and it's better at improving cognitive 

2428
01:53:50,231 --> 01:53:54,131
function in animals.
Then risperidol is largely because it's 

2429
01:53:54,131 --> 01:53:55,370
four times more bioavailable.
Uh,

2430
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:56,210
so anyways,
I was like,

2431
01:53:56,211 --> 01:53:58,040
well,
I don't know if that's why they're doing

2432
01:53:58,041 --> 01:54:00,230
it because it's not affecting the same 
pathway.

2433
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:05,830
But then I came across something really 
interesting in that is I'm terrible 

2434
01:54:05,830 --> 01:54:07,370
still being actually has been shown.
Again,

2435
01:54:07,371 --> 01:54:12,371
this is an animal study to increase the 
type of bacteria in the gut that causes 

2436
01:54:13,160 --> 01:54:14,350
the,
um,

2437
01:54:15,110 --> 01:54:18,680
conversion of certain compounds,
Alijah Tannins,

2438
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:21,170
which are found in berries and some 
nuts,

2439
01:54:21,230 --> 01:54:26,230
but really high and pomegranate Alijah 
tannins get converted into something 

2440
01:54:26,230 --> 01:54:27,620
called teros still,
I mean called,

2441
01:54:27,621 --> 01:54:28,170
um,
your,

2442
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,260
uh,
within a by your gut bacteria,

2443
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:32,870
which is what pterostilbene is 
increasing that gut bacteria.

2444
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:38,020
So Tara soybeans actually increasing the
production of your urine within a from 

2445
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:39,140
berries that are having this other 
compound.

2446
01:54:39,590 --> 01:54:44,590
You're in a.
What that does is this has been shown 

2447
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:48,191
also in other studies.
It causes my defeat Mito faigy or my 

2448
01:54:48,191 --> 01:54:52,871
topic g,
which is the clearing away of damaged 

2449
01:54:52,871 --> 01:54:56,231
mitochondria a.
So you're basically clearing away 

2450
01:54:56,231 --> 01:54:56,930
damaged mitochondria like they eat 
themselves.

2451
01:54:56,930 --> 01:55:01,930
So faigy would be eating itself,
kind of like [inaudible] or [inaudible] 

2452
01:55:01,930 --> 01:55:05,550
as it's called,
which is a self sort of a damaged cell 

2453
01:55:05,550 --> 01:55:08,201
that gets cleared away and eats itself.
That happens a lot during the fasting 

2454
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:08,201
state.
Well,

2455
01:55:08,201 --> 01:55:11,840
this Mito faigy is doing it specifically
for Mitochondria and this the reason why

2456
01:55:11,841 --> 01:55:15,680
this is so cool and I'm going to try to 
not bore you,

2457
01:55:15,681 --> 01:55:17,670
but I can go on and on.
I said,

2458
01:55:17,870 --> 01:55:21,770
I'm worried about.
The reason this is so cool is because.

2459
01:55:21,771 --> 01:55:26,771
So you know,
Mitochondria are very important for the 

2460
01:55:26,771 --> 01:55:26,771
way we age.
It's not just muscle function,

2461
01:55:26,771 --> 01:55:31,601
brain function.
They're providing energy for everything 

2462
01:55:31,601 --> 01:55:31,640
like period,
like your mitochondrial decay,

2463
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:33,830
you decay.
That's the way it is like period.

2464
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:37,670
So their mitochondria as you are aging,
they're decaying,

2465
01:55:37,671 --> 01:55:39,050
they're getting damaged and all this 
stuff.

2466
01:55:39,290 --> 01:55:41,510
Well,
they have this whole repair system where

2467
01:55:41,511 --> 01:55:42,560
you,
where you have,

2468
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,820
um,
lots of Mitochondria inside one cell,

2469
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:47,220
let's say you have one damage,
Mitochondria and one healthy.

2470
01:55:47,400 --> 01:55:50,790
What they do is they fuse together,
exchange all their content and fizz back

2471
01:55:50,791 --> 01:55:55,791
apart.
So they were kind of like repair each 

2472
01:55:55,791 --> 01:55:55,791
other.
So you have a healthy one,

2473
01:55:55,791 --> 01:55:58,461
a damaged one.
The healthy one kind of mixes with the 

2474
01:55:58,461 --> 01:55:59,910
unhealthy one.
And then you have to healthyish ones,

2475
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:04,911
right?
So this is happening constantly inside 

2476
01:56:04,911 --> 01:56:04,911
every cell.
If you ever,

2477
01:56:04,911 --> 01:56:08,901
if you look at the Mitochondria,
it's never like you never see 

2478
01:56:08,901 --> 01:56:08,901
Mitochondria by themselves are always 
like,

2479
01:56:08,901 --> 01:56:11,070
like a network.
Like they look like Vermicelli Spaghetti

2480
01:56:11,370 --> 01:56:13,320
because they're constantly doing this.
Well,

2481
01:56:13,350 --> 01:56:18,350
if you clear away the damaged ones and 
you increase mitochondrial biogenesis 

2482
01:56:19,111 --> 01:56:24,111
with nicotinamide riboside.
So not only are you getting rid of the 

2483
01:56:24,111 --> 01:56:27,740
damaged pool,
you're now creating new ones that are 

2484
01:56:27,740 --> 01:56:27,750
like brand new,
healthy,

2485
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:32,751
young brimming,
young mitochondria like you had when 

2486
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:32,751
you're a young person,
young child.

2487
01:56:32,751 --> 01:56:33,930
So now your,
your,

2488
01:56:34,020 --> 01:56:39,020
your pool that you're mixing with,
it's like not mitochondrial biogenesis 

2489
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:39,870
is good in and of itself because you're 
making new mitochondria,

2490
01:56:40,140 --> 01:56:43,410
but having damaged one still around can 
still dilute the pool out,

2491
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,180
you know,
it's still diluted.

2492
01:56:45,360 --> 01:56:48,690
So if you get clear out those damaged 
ones and you're making new ones,

2493
01:56:48,691 --> 01:56:53,691
it's kind of like boom,
you're going to get like young new 

2494
01:56:53,691 --> 01:56:56,110
mitochondria.
So I think that possibly is a,

2495
01:56:56,111 --> 01:56:59,340
another reason why they combine those.
I mean it's completely speculation.

2496
01:56:59,341 --> 01:57:00,540
I'm just.
But anyways,

2497
01:57:00,541 --> 01:57:01,930
he learned some cool shit about 
terrorists.

2498
01:57:03,030 --> 01:57:04,500
You're lifting A.
Yeah,

2499
01:57:04,501 --> 01:57:06,990
my might've age is a very interesting 
thing,

2500
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:12,340
you know,
exercise to some degree it can increase 

2501
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:12,340
it.
Fasting does.

2502
01:57:12,340 --> 01:57:13,340
And why does fasting increases?
Um,

2503
01:57:13,470 --> 01:57:14,620
when you're fasting,
you,

2504
01:57:14,640 --> 01:57:17,160
you try to.
So Nad levels rise,

2505
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:20,640
you try to,
to conserve some of your energy.

2506
01:57:20,641 --> 01:57:22,770
And the way you do that is by eating 
different Organelles,

2507
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:24,420
eating,
eating the cell itself,

2508
01:57:24,480 --> 01:57:26,550
which can then provide energy for other 
cells.

2509
01:57:26,551 --> 01:57:31,551
So you.
So usually what happens is fasting will 

2510
01:57:31,551 --> 01:57:34,260
selectively get rid of some of those 
damaged cells are damaged Mitochondria.

2511
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,090
So that,
that happens during,

2512
01:57:36,091 --> 01:57:37,610
during the fasting.
Does that make sense when you.

2513
01:57:37,630 --> 01:57:40,380
Yeah,
so it's interesting though that the body

2514
01:57:40,381 --> 01:57:44,620
manages it so well that it goes after 
the damaged ones before I know it's,

2515
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:45,150
it's,
well,

2516
01:57:45,151 --> 01:57:48,090
there's lots of like molecular 
mechanisms that have been,

2517
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:49,650
you know,
figured out why that is.

2518
01:57:49,651 --> 01:57:54,651
And that's because the damage one there,
their mitochondrial membrane potentials 

2519
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:57,000
like different and it's just,
it's all this complicated stuff,

2520
01:57:57,001 --> 01:58:02,001
but it's like,
it all works out perfectly where it's 

2521
01:58:02,001 --> 01:58:02,001
like these,
these,

2522
01:58:02,001 --> 01:58:02,660
these enzymes that like targeted to,
to,

2523
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:04,050
to um,
know,

2524
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,930
to basically become,
um,

2525
01:58:06,360 --> 01:58:11,360
to undergo Mito faigy.
It's like they recognize this certain 

2526
01:58:11,360 --> 01:58:14,391
one with a lower membrane potential 
which happens to be more of a damaged 

2527
01:58:14,391 --> 01:58:17,771
mitochondria and it's just kinda like,
it's kind of beautiful how it just all 

2528
01:58:17,771 --> 01:58:17,771
works out that way,
you know?

2529
01:58:17,771 --> 01:58:20,410
Um,
what was I going to say?

2530
01:58:20,411 --> 01:58:24,030
I completely like was going to say I 
lost my train of thought there.

2531
01:58:24,031 --> 01:58:26,280
But um,
yeah.

2532
01:58:26,281 --> 01:58:27,980
So anyways,
the fact that you can like,

2533
01:58:28,050 --> 01:58:31,230
have new mitochondria is like pretty.
I mean,

2534
01:58:31,231 --> 01:58:34,410
that's Kinda like the big thing with,
with aging and it's been that for a long

2535
01:58:34,411 --> 01:58:39,411
time is like young new mitochondria.
I know you're probably aware of this 

2536
01:58:39,411 --> 01:58:43,551
study,
but they injected old mice with the 

2537
01:58:43,551 --> 01:58:43,551
blood

2538
01:58:43,551 --> 01:58:47,220
of young mice and they found that the 
old mice started behaving more lively 

2539
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:52,771
and then they did the reverse.
They injected the young mice with the 

2540
01:58:52,771 --> 01:58:54,020
blood of old mice and the mice struggled
and,

2541
01:58:54,430 --> 01:58:59,430
and deteriorated and now there's some 
crazy new startup were for was like 

2542
01:58:59,430 --> 01:59:04,320
eight grand.
They fill you up with a blood of young 

2543
01:59:04,320 --> 01:59:04,420
people.
Okay.

2544
01:59:04,421 --> 01:59:07,120
I'm glad you mentioned that recently.
Actually.

2545
01:59:07,121 --> 01:59:08,920
I know Peter Teal,
the paypal.

2546
01:59:08,980 --> 01:59:10,300
Yes,
he does that.

2547
01:59:10,310 --> 01:59:12,850
He's he.
He's the guy that he's.

2548
01:59:12,940 --> 01:59:15,040
He's on trump's board now,
isn't he?

2549
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:20,790
Yeah.
He's like one of the first people that 

2550
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:20,790
trump hired,
which is fascinating.

2551
01:59:20,790 --> 01:59:21,290
So fascinating.
Yeah.

2552
01:59:22,300 --> 01:59:23,080
Yeah,
he does.

2553
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:25,390
He's talked about how he's like,
he gets blood injections.

2554
01:59:25,570 --> 01:59:26,290
Okay.
So here's,

2555
01:59:26,291 --> 01:59:29,320
what has he said about it?
I don't remember exactly what,

2556
01:59:29,321 --> 01:59:34,321
just that.
I don't think he said anything about 

2557
01:59:34,321 --> 01:59:35,791
whether it's doing anything,
but I think let's just start showing up 

2558
01:59:35,791 --> 01:59:35,791
younger.

2559
01:59:35,791 --> 01:59:36,940
Well,
now he's got a snapchat filter on.

2560
01:59:37,630 --> 01:59:42,630
Well,
here's the thing that was really 

2561
01:59:42,630 --> 01:59:43,981
interesting about this whole thing 
because I've been following this field 

2562
01:59:43,981 --> 01:59:46,771
for awhile too,
because I find it very interesting for 

2563
01:59:46,771 --> 01:59:46,771
multiple reasons.
One,

2564
01:59:46,771 --> 01:59:47,140
it's like it could be applicable,
right?

2565
01:59:47,141 --> 01:59:49,640
I mean easily,
but various look at him.

2566
01:59:49,670 --> 01:59:50,620
Look,
looks young as fuck.

2567
01:59:50,621 --> 01:59:55,150
He's nine years old.
Wants inject himself with young people's

2568
01:59:55,151 --> 02:00:00,151
blood or is doing it.
Trump delegate and gawker bankrupt or.

2569
02:00:00,251 --> 02:00:01,360
Oh yeah,
he's the guy who,

2570
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:06,450
he,
he financed whole cogans attack on 

2571
02:00:06,450 --> 02:00:09,460
Gawker because gawker outed him as 
being.

2572
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:12,750
Did they outed him as gay or they 
attacked him and they,

2573
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:14,870
they got really shitty with him and you 
know,

2574
02:00:14,950 --> 02:00:18,610
he's a fucking billionaire.
So he went off and um,

2575
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:21,850
thank you for turning off your ad 
blocker.

2576
02:00:21,940 --> 02:00:26,940
Enjoy the Forbes ad light experience.
Flutter off Nick Denton files for 

2577
02:00:26,940 --> 02:00:27,670
personal bankruptcy.

2578
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:28,240
Yeah,
he,

2579
02:00:28,241 --> 02:00:30,490
uh,
he went after that guy because of it.

2580
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,930
Yeah.
Um,

2581
02:00:32,950 --> 02:00:34,240
so when you go back to the other 
article,

2582
02:00:34,410 --> 02:00:36,520
I want to change the articles there.
Um,

2583
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:41,580
so what he's doing a given fields 
obsession with warding off death.

2584
02:00:41,890 --> 02:00:46,890
It comes as no surprise to silicon 
valley billionaire is interested in 

2585
02:00:46,890 --> 02:00:50,010
lease one radical way of doing it,
injecting himself with a young person's 

2586
02:00:50,010 --> 02:00:50,320
blood.
Wow.

2587
02:00:50,500 --> 02:00:55,500
INC magazine published part of a year 
old interview with thiel and which the 

2588
02:00:55,500 --> 02:00:59,641
venture capitalists explains that he's 
interested in power of biosis twist 

2589
02:00:59,641 --> 02:01:04,001
called,
which includes the practice of getting 

2590
02:01:04,001 --> 02:01:06,540
transfusions of blood from a younger 
person as a means of improving health 

2591
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:08,310
and potentially reversing aging.
Said,

2592
02:01:08,330 --> 02:01:10,750
I'm looking into this stuff.
I think it's really interesting.

2593
02:01:10,780 --> 02:01:11,100
Blah,
blah,

2594
02:01:11,120 --> 02:01:12,520
blah,
blah.

2595
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:16,210
It's unclear whether the 48 year old 
entrepreneur is currently receiving.

2596
02:01:16,240 --> 02:01:18,490
Guaranteed you is,
um,

2597
02:01:18,610 --> 02:01:21,340
reports that are fuel capital employee.

2598
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:25,180
Actually the personal health director 
has a personal health director,

2599
02:01:25,630 --> 02:01:28,270
personal health director to Peter Thiel.
That's hilarious.

2600
02:01:28,271 --> 02:01:30,130
That's what you do when you're all 
baller.

2601
02:01:30,910 --> 02:01:34,510
I'm going to get a personal health 
director is the same company.

2602
02:01:34,511 --> 02:01:39,511
Ambrosia LLC.
This is the one that we were talking 

2603
02:01:39,511 --> 02:01:39,511
about the other day.
Yeah.

2604
02:01:39,511 --> 02:01:39,890
Yeah.
Interesting.

2605
02:01:39,891 --> 02:01:43,490
So this is actually happening.
Says thiel spends $40,000

2606
02:01:43,491 --> 02:01:48,491
per quarter per quarter to get an 
infusion of blood from an 18 year old 

2607
02:01:49,701 --> 02:01:54,701
based on research conducted at Stanford 
on extending the lives of mice.

2608
02:01:55,280 --> 02:01:59,180
So he's got one fucking 18 year old that
he's vampiress one kid.

2609
02:01:59,181 --> 02:02:02,660
He's given them beats and Broccoli 
sprouts and making them run up hills.

2610
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:08,360
That's what you would have to hope that 
kids not doing meth,

2611
02:02:08,650 --> 02:02:10,810
you know,
like he's got this 18 year old.

2612
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:13,630
All these biomarkers in the blood,
I would imagine.

2613
02:02:13,640 --> 02:02:15,500
Yeah,
because you have to make sure.

2614
02:02:15,501 --> 02:02:16,430
I mean,
that's so weird.

2615
02:02:16,431 --> 02:02:18,920
We're going to farm off young people 
and.

2616
02:02:19,130 --> 02:02:20,840
Oh Wow.
That is so crazy.

2617
02:02:20,900 --> 02:02:23,960
He's given $6,000,000
to biomedical.

2618
02:02:24,080 --> 02:02:26,330
Jen,
gerontologist,

2619
02:02:26,340 --> 02:02:29,930
traumatologists all opry to gray.
That crazy fucker.

2620
02:02:30,180 --> 02:02:32,740
I had him on it.
I had him on my podcast too.

2621
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:33,770
Yeah,
he's interesting.

2622
02:02:33,860 --> 02:02:37,190
But he drinks.
He boozes like every night.

2623
02:02:37,370 --> 02:02:40,750
He was like three in strong at 11 in the
morning when I walked into his office.

2624
02:02:40,751 --> 02:02:41,540
He.
Yeah,

2625
02:02:41,541 --> 02:02:43,790
that's what I was saying when I was 
hanging out with them.

2626
02:02:43,820 --> 02:02:44,480
He's like,
well,

2627
02:02:44,590 --> 02:02:47,270
he,
he's basing all of.

2628
02:02:47,271 --> 02:02:51,110
He's putting all of his eggs in the 
basket of science.

2629
02:02:51,290 --> 02:02:54,350
He thinks that science and things like 
with Peter thiels doing it's going to be

2630
02:02:54,351 --> 02:02:56,480
able to mitigate all this stuff that 
he's doing,

2631
02:02:57,020 --> 02:02:57,530
but I'm like,
dude,

2632
02:02:57,531 --> 02:03:00,410
you're fucking stuck in a position where
it's like,

2633
02:03:00,411 --> 02:03:01,790
okay,
they can delay the aging,

2634
02:03:01,791 --> 02:03:04,790
but like you're stuck like now,
okay,

2635
02:03:04,830 --> 02:03:08,480
you can't make you like 18,
but we can stop you from dying,

2636
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:09,290
but you know,
so it's like,

2637
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:10,790
that's possible.

2638
02:03:10,790 --> 02:03:11,870
So He's going to be stuck.
Like,

2639
02:03:12,720 --> 02:03:14,090
well,
he also does an exercise.

2640
02:03:14,710 --> 02:03:18,050
I found him to be perplexing.
I really enjoyed talking to him,

2641
02:03:18,260 --> 02:03:23,260
but I found him to be quite perplexing 
because of the booze and because of the 

2642
02:03:23,260 --> 02:03:24,410
lack of exercise and his big fucking 
crazy gandalf beard.

2643
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:26,120
Like what's going on with you?
Dude?

2644
02:03:26,121 --> 02:03:28,060
There's a lot going on here and like 
this is.

2645
02:03:28,090 --> 02:03:30,260
There's a lot,
a lot of image here,

2646
02:03:30,410 --> 02:03:33,230
you know,
disagree on a lot of nutrition.

2647
02:03:33,320 --> 02:03:35,150
Oh well hold on a second,
let me talk about that.

2648
02:03:35,151 --> 02:03:40,151
But in some say that the pay to 
participate study with the potential to 

2649
02:03:40,151 --> 02:03:42,590
collect up to four point 8 million from 
as many as 600 participants as mounts to

2650
02:03:42,591 --> 02:03:43,280
a scam.

2651
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:50,410
What certain is,
it's based on some intriguing if 

2652
02:03:50,410 --> 02:03:50,450
inconclusive science,
a car,

2653
02:03:50,451 --> 02:03:55,451
maisie in a 32 year old Princeton 
graduate and competitive rower said he 

2654
02:03:55,451 --> 02:03:59,381
was inspired by studies on mice.
That research it's sewn together with 

2655
02:03:59,381 --> 02:04:01,280
their veins conjoined in a procedure 
called Para biosis.

2656
02:04:01,281 --> 02:04:02,480
Okay.
That's what we're talking about.

2657
02:04:02,481 --> 02:04:06,200
That study about mice.
So what did you guys disagree with?

2658
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:07,670
Um,
well,

2659
02:04:07,671 --> 02:04:09,470
just the role that nutrition plays in 
aging.

2660
02:04:09,650 --> 02:04:12,010
So he didn't think it was a big role.
We didn't think it was a big race.

2661
02:04:12,020 --> 02:04:13,580
He's boozing.
Yeah,

2662
02:04:13,870 --> 02:04:15,110
it in.
He's not working out.

2663
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:20,440
I mean,
how can you ignore all the science on 

2664
02:04:20,440 --> 02:04:20,890
the positive benefits of exercise and 
nutrition?

2665
02:04:20,910 --> 02:04:25,910
Oh,
there's lots of studies showing that 

2666
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:25,910
that diet and lifestyle,
you know,

2667
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:26,360
have a huge impact on,
on aging.

2668
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:32,560
I mean,
just one more thing about this pair 

2669
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:32,560
biosis there because it's kind of.

2670
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:33,280
People were thinking that it was the 
young.

2671
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:35,720
There was something in the young blood 
that was,

2672
02:04:35,721 --> 02:04:40,721
um,
present the 11 that it just said on the 

2673
02:04:40,721 --> 02:04:40,721
screen.
That was actually 11.

2674
02:04:40,721 --> 02:04:41,050
What does that,
right,

2675
02:04:41,120 --> 02:04:42,360
it's a growth factor.
11.

2676
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:45,630
Yeah.
So it was thought that this was what was

2677
02:04:45,631 --> 02:04:50,631
responsible for rejuvenating tissues and
growing new brain cells because that's 

2678
02:04:50,631 --> 02:04:51,440
what happened when you gave it to the,
um,

2679
02:04:51,660 --> 02:04:56,660
older mice.
But then other studies started to come 

2680
02:04:56,660 --> 02:04:58,950
out also out of Stanford showing that in
fact,

2681
02:04:59,160 --> 02:05:01,380
it may not be something that's in the 
young blood,

2682
02:05:01,381 --> 02:05:05,190
but something that's in the old blood 
that's actually causing the aging,

2683
02:05:05,400 --> 02:05:09,330
something called a v Cam,
one that starts to,

2684
02:05:09,420 --> 02:05:14,420
you start to make it as you're getting 
older and it causes inflammation in the 

2685
02:05:14,420 --> 02:05:18,861
brain and starts messing up things.
So there was a recent study that just 

2686
02:05:18,861 --> 02:05:22,521
came out and show that if you like,
make an antibody against that v Cam one 

2687
02:05:22,521 --> 02:05:23,310
and prevent it from doing its action.

2688
02:05:23,820 --> 02:05:25,680
It's like you can stop that from 
happening.

2689
02:05:25,710 --> 02:05:27,960
So anyways,
there's a lot to be figured out,

2690
02:05:28,430 --> 02:05:33,430
body that they're currently working on.
They're trying to make some kind of 

2691
02:05:33,430 --> 02:05:37,040
some,
some something that you can take God 

2692
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:37,040
damn solution that was going to be 
weird.

2693
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:39,840
It's going to be weird if you see like 
old people become young,

2694
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:45,020
it's not going to be weird if people 
don't get any older will be kind of 

2695
02:05:45,020 --> 02:05:45,600
weird.
But like if I came,

2696
02:05:45,820 --> 02:05:48,270
I ran into you like 20 years from now 
I'm like Damn Rhonda,

2697
02:05:48,271 --> 02:05:50,550
you exactly the same.
It will be cool,

2698
02:05:50,670 --> 02:05:55,670
but it wouldn't freak me out.
What would freak me out of Arnold 

2699
02:05:55,670 --> 02:05:56,460
Schwartzenegger started looking like it 
was when he was 20 again.

2700
02:05:56,710 --> 02:06:01,710
Like that would freak me out.
Like if we start seeing the change in 

2701
02:06:01,710 --> 02:06:02,820
the process,
we started seeing things reverse,

2702
02:06:03,180 --> 02:06:08,180
not just halt or slow down,
which we kind of have seen with like 

2703
02:06:08,180 --> 02:06:08,180
really healthy people.

2704
02:06:08,290 --> 02:06:13,290
Like some people know,
some people kind of defy aging least to 

2705
02:06:13,290 --> 02:06:16,170
a certain extent.
Like Tom Cruise is a perfect example.

2706
02:06:16,171 --> 02:06:18,000
I want to know what they're filling that
dude up with.

2707
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:23,480
Who else?
I think who I was thinking that defied 

2708
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:23,880
aging like famous wise,
Keanu reeves.

2709
02:06:23,881 --> 02:06:26,940
I feel like that guys look the same for 
like a long time.

2710
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:28,560
Yeah.
And he's in his fifties now.

2711
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,920
He looks great.
He looks great and I think he smokes 

2712
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:33,920
too.
Yeah,

2713
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:34,900
no,
yes.

2714
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,160
Yeah.
So that's,

2715
02:06:36,260 --> 02:06:38,760
that's just show you.
He's got some kind of like genetic there

2716
02:06:38,761 --> 02:06:41,780
are.
There definitely are Tom Cruise 1983,

2717
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:46,820
2014.
They're injecting him with some kind of 

2718
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:46,820
young fluid.
No,

2719
02:06:46,820 --> 02:06:47,320
I'm sorry.
I'm,

2720
02:06:48,690 --> 02:06:53,690
I mean look,
he's got fucking ungodly sums of money 

2721
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:57,880
and that's part of a part of the issue,
you know,

2722
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:02,940
I mean they've uh,
they that you can definitely do things 

2723
02:07:02,940 --> 02:07:04,590
with money that badge and make you look 
younger.

2724
02:07:05,170 --> 02:07:07,200
Trying to figure out what surgery wise 
and stuff.

2725
02:07:07,230 --> 02:07:08,730
I don't think he's doing surgery though.
No,

2726
02:07:08,990 --> 02:07:10,910
no.
Well I don't.

2727
02:07:11,010 --> 02:07:15,600
One of the things that they think is a.
What does that picture up above?

2728
02:07:15,690 --> 02:07:17,990
What's that one with the shirt off?
One up there.

2729
02:07:17,991 --> 02:07:21,690
Is that him working out of there?
See that chose aging.

2730
02:07:22,290 --> 02:07:25,620
So one on the right,
like he's got substantially less tone to

2731
02:07:25,621 --> 02:07:27,180
his muscles,
but that could just be.

2732
02:07:27,450 --> 02:07:31,230
He's been busy.
Says the maverick days are over,

2733
02:07:31,650 --> 02:07:33,000
hold on,
go back.

2734
02:07:33,930 --> 02:07:38,930
What does that say?
Is it from 1986 to right on the set 

2735
02:07:38,930 --> 02:07:39,720
yesterday?
So yeah,

2736
02:07:40,360 --> 02:07:44,920
that's also that there's not that much 
of a variability there that could easily

2737
02:07:44,921 --> 02:07:47,080
be,
just hasn't been working out as hard.

2738
02:07:47,081 --> 02:07:49,270
I mean when you're on a movie set,
you're working 15,

2739
02:07:49,271 --> 02:07:54,271
16 hours a day sometimes.
Especially these gigantic big budget 

2740
02:07:54,271 --> 02:07:55,120
budget blockbusters where you're,
you know,

2741
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:58,270
involved in these crazy stunts and all 
that stuff.

2742
02:07:58,790 --> 02:08:00,160
So interesting.

2743
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:01,380
Yeah.
Um,

2744
02:08:01,830 --> 02:08:06,830
but you know,
back to this like diet aging thing that 

2745
02:08:06,830 --> 02:08:06,830
like Aubrey and I just read on,
I mean it's,

2746
02:08:06,830 --> 02:08:11,600
it's so,
it's so weird that someone that's he's 

2747
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:11,600
familiar with the aging literature 
would,

2748
02:08:11,600 --> 02:08:14,760
would disagree with,
with some of the science out there.

2749
02:08:14,761 --> 02:08:16,740
Like there's been studies looking at,
for example,

2750
02:08:16,741 --> 02:08:21,741
people that have like 1:12
ounce can of like sugar water or sugar 

2751
02:08:22,711 --> 02:08:26,280
soda,
some kind of sugary drink a day.

2752
02:08:26,910 --> 02:08:28,380
They have,
if you look at them,

2753
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:30,750
their telomeres in their white blood 
cells.

2754
02:08:30,751 --> 02:08:34,530
So telomeres are a biomarker for aging.
When you look at their team number link,

2755
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:39,560
their telomeres are shorter compared to 
people that don't have that soda every 

2756
02:08:39,560 --> 02:08:42,450
day and that corresponds to like four 
point six years of biological aging.

2757
02:08:42,930 --> 02:08:46,530
I mean that's like someone that's the 
same exact age as you,

2758
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,540
but has a team member that looks,
you know,

2759
02:08:48,870 --> 02:08:51,560
either five years older,
younger,

2760
02:08:51,590 --> 02:08:52,860
same.
Yeah.

2761
02:08:52,861 --> 02:08:53,730
It's totally insane.
All,

2762
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:56,940
all based off of like this refined sugar
soda.

2763
02:08:57,170 --> 02:09:02,170
I wonder if it's all a personal thing 
with him because he knows that he's not 

2764
02:09:02,170 --> 02:09:05,141
addressing that and his own life.
Maybe that's why he's decided to put up 

2765
02:09:05,141 --> 02:09:05,330
these blinders and ignore the science.

2766
02:09:05,930 --> 02:09:10,930
Well,
I think also he's interested in 

2767
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:10,930
extending lifespan to like a massive 
point.

2768
02:09:10,930 --> 02:09:15,110
Sugary soft drinks may be linked to 
accelerate a DNA aging study.

2769
02:09:15,290 --> 02:09:16,310
So he's.
I mean,

2770
02:09:16,370 --> 02:09:21,370
like I said,
he's putting all his eggs in the basket 

2771
02:09:21,370 --> 02:09:22,430
of science just of who knows.
I mean there's,

2772
02:09:23,030 --> 02:09:28,030
it's,
it's kind of interesting that he is 

2773
02:09:28,030 --> 02:09:29,990
doing that though because he will 
concentrate very heavily on that.

2774
02:09:30,350 --> 02:09:35,350
And again,
when you were talking about all this 

2775
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:35,350
nutrition and exercise,
the benefits of it like,

2776
02:09:35,350 --> 02:09:36,530
God,
there's so much to study,

2777
02:09:36,920 --> 02:09:41,920
there's so much that it maybe his,
maybe his desire to shoe that and go 

2778
02:09:42,711 --> 02:09:47,711
straight to the science of it only and 
talk about genetic manipulation and all 

2779
02:09:47,711 --> 02:09:49,670
these other different variables.
Like maybe,

2780
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:53,540
maybe there's something to that.
Maybe you really can't spend enough time

2781
02:09:53,750 --> 02:09:55,070
in both fields.

2782
02:09:55,630 --> 02:09:56,440
Totally.
Yeah,

2783
02:09:56,441 --> 02:09:57,640
I think that makes sense.
And I,

2784
02:09:57,641 --> 02:10:00,160
and I do think that there's hope for,
you know,

2785
02:10:00,161 --> 02:10:05,161
things like genetic engineering and stem
cell therapies that will help tune 

2786
02:10:05,161 --> 02:10:07,900
humans up eventually.
And that will make a big difference in.

2787
02:10:08,720 --> 02:10:11,210
Have I talked to you about my stem cell 
experiments?

2788
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:12,100
No.
No.

2789
02:10:12,260 --> 02:10:15,380
Okay.
I have been getting stem cell shots.

2790
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:19,250
I got them for an injured shoulder to 
shoulder that.

2791
02:10:19,251 --> 02:10:20,810
Um,
I had a rotator cuff tear,

2792
02:10:20,811 --> 02:10:25,670
biceps tendon tear and labral tear in my
shoulder and it was most likely had been

2793
02:10:25,671 --> 02:10:30,671
dislocated before and I didn't know 
which is just the side effects of years 

2794
02:10:31,581 --> 02:10:34,250
of doing difficult stuff with your.
Especially Jujitsu.

2795
02:10:34,520 --> 02:10:37,850
Jujitsu is all about joint manipulations
and joint locks.

2796
02:10:37,851 --> 02:10:40,250
And Chokes and grappling and there's a 
lot of,

2797
02:10:40,590 --> 02:10:42,740
just a lot of damage that your body goes
through.

2798
02:10:42,741 --> 02:10:46,100
Everybody and I know that does Jujitsu 
at a certain point in time either has to

2799
02:10:46,101 --> 02:10:51,101
get some form of surgery or has some 
pretty significant injuries that they 

2800
02:10:51,101 --> 02:10:51,590
have to work around.
So,

2801
02:10:51,591 --> 02:10:52,760
uh,
I,

2802
02:10:52,761 --> 02:10:53,580
he,
um,

2803
02:10:54,440 --> 02:10:55,820
went to a doctor that was like,
well,

2804
02:10:56,330 --> 02:10:58,980
you probably have to get surgery,
like this is gonna if,

2805
02:10:59,150 --> 02:11:04,150
if not now,
sometime really soon because every time 

2806
02:11:04,150 --> 02:11:05,600
I would work out and we get really sore 
and I'd have to ice it afterwards,

2807
02:11:06,380 --> 02:11:09,870
I get these shots and they're doing them
from the,

2808
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:14,900
they're extracting the stem cells from 
women's placenta and they take the stem 

2809
02:11:15,231 --> 02:11:20,231
cells and then they shoot them into the 
area where you have the injury and the 

2810
02:11:20,231 --> 02:11:22,220
results are fucking freakish.

2811
02:11:22,550 --> 02:11:25,700
You heal like wolverine.
I mean it's really bizarre.

2812
02:11:25,940 --> 02:11:29,270
And now this same shoulder that I had,
you know,

2813
02:11:29,271 --> 02:11:32,930
like a real problem with,
I was worried about needing surgery.

2814
02:11:33,290 --> 02:11:37,350
I do 90 pound presses with kettlebells 
with one shoulder and it's not,

2815
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:39,350
have no pain,
no pain,

2816
02:11:39,380 --> 02:11:42,520
no discomfort.
It's not bothering me at all and it's,

2817
02:11:42,640 --> 02:11:47,480
it's unbelievable how much strength and 
function that the shoulder has now.

2818
02:11:47,540 --> 02:11:52,540
That's really cool.
I didn't realize they were doing that 

2819
02:11:52,540 --> 02:11:52,670
with placental stem cells.
Placental stem cells are like,

2820
02:11:53,180 --> 02:11:55,870
kind of like a goldmine because they,
um,

2821
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,780
they possess a tap of stem cell called 
multiphoton stem cell,

2822
02:11:59,781 --> 02:12:04,781
which is able to form multiple different
types of cartilage cells that form 

2823
02:12:04,781 --> 02:12:07,580
cartilage cells that form bone,
even cells that form neurons,

2824
02:12:07,790 --> 02:12:10,040
so they're able to form lots of 
different types of cells.

2825
02:12:10,270 --> 02:12:15,270
Um,
and usually placenta just like thrown 

2826
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:15,270
away.

2827
02:12:15,270 --> 02:12:19,500
So that's kind of cool that they're,
I guess there's companies that are 

2828
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:21,290
freezing them down and I'm finding 
donors that match.

2829
02:12:21,340 --> 02:12:22,880
Yeah.
Let me tell you the name of the company.

2830
02:12:22,881 --> 02:12:24,520
So people who are listening,
it's in the.

2831
02:12:24,530 --> 02:12:29,530
My doctor's name is Dr Roddy Mcgee and 
he's in Las Vegas and the company is a 

2832
02:12:33,600 --> 02:12:36,200
listed here.
That's good.

2833
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:39,620
I've got it on my instagram and my pen 
ready here to let me know.

2834
02:12:39,621 --> 02:12:40,970
I won't let you down.
Just give me a second.

2835
02:12:40,971 --> 02:12:45,971
I'll scroll through my instagram and 
I'll find him because it wasn't that 

2836
02:12:45,971 --> 02:12:45,971
long ago that I was there,
but,

2837
02:12:45,971 --> 02:12:46,250
um,
I,

2838
02:12:46,251 --> 02:12:51,251
uh,
I posted something about it on 

2839
02:12:51,251 --> 02:12:51,251
Instagram,
but I am a,

2840
02:12:51,251 --> 02:12:51,710
I'm a believer in it and I've had some 
friends,

2841
02:12:51,711 --> 02:12:56,711
my friend John Dudley who's an archer,
was experiencing a tendinitis in one of 

2842
02:12:57,291 --> 02:13:02,291
his elbows for a long time.
I mean he had it and it was something 

2843
02:13:02,481 --> 02:13:07,481
that he had been working through for 
quite a few years and he had one stem 

2844
02:13:07,851 --> 02:13:10,850
cell shot and within two weeks the pain 
was completely gone.

2845
02:13:11,150 --> 02:13:12,470
It was just,
yeah,

2846
02:13:12,471 --> 02:13:17,471
it's freaky what they're able to do.
I'm fine to get stem cell therapies.

2847
02:13:17,661 --> 02:13:22,661
I mean,
that's something that I'm extremely 

2848
02:13:22,661 --> 02:13:24,701
excited about for the future.
But have you ever tried a hydrolyzed 

2849
02:13:24,701 --> 02:13:25,700
collagen powder or like bone broth?
Yes,

2850
02:13:25,790 --> 02:13:28,640
I drink bone broth every morning.
I love them.

2851
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:30,000
So,
um,

2852
02:13:30,150 --> 02:13:31,400
that,
that's another thing like,

2853
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:31,950
because I,

2854
02:13:32,190 --> 02:13:35,540
I've been getting into the bone broth,
but I was doing hydraulic add,

2855
02:13:35,550 --> 02:13:40,550
hydrolyzed collagen powder to like my 
coffee in the morning and also my 

2856
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:40,650
smoothies.
Then what does that do?

2857
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:41,430
Well,
it's this,

2858
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:43,770
it's just like a,
it's got a lot of the same things.

2859
02:13:43,771 --> 02:13:46,290
Is Bone broth bone broth?
Probably actually even better because it

2860
02:13:46,291 --> 02:13:49,680
has more stuff,
but it's been shown in animal studies.

2861
02:13:49,681 --> 02:13:54,681
If you take the hydrolyzed collagen 
powder and like radio label it so you 

2862
02:13:54,681 --> 02:13:57,561
can follow where it goes and an animal.
It goes right to the cartilage in the 

2863
02:13:57,561 --> 02:13:58,230
joints and ligaments.
Um,

2864
02:13:58,860 --> 02:14:03,860
I used it.
It has helped me heal like injured 

2865
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:03,860
wrist,
you know,

2866
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:04,950
obviously like my injuries are like way,
way,

2867
02:14:05,030 --> 02:14:08,520
like less magnitude and something that 
you're experiencing in your shoulder.

2868
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:13,850
It is a total sports medicine in Vegas.
That's the name of the company that,

2869
02:14:14,820 --> 02:14:15,150
that.

2870
02:14:15,660 --> 02:14:19,050
Does this stem cell injections or that.
What about the company that you applied?

2871
02:14:19,051 --> 02:14:22,050
Biologics.
It's called a flow graft.

2872
02:14:22,560 --> 02:14:26,290
Amniotic fluid therapy,
that's what they're calling it a,

2873
02:14:26,310 --> 02:14:28,260
but it's total sports medicine in Las 
Vegas.

2874
02:14:28,261 --> 02:14:30,600
That's where I got the stem.
So biologics,

2875
02:14:30,601 --> 02:14:32,580
is that the company that freezes the 
Placenta?

2876
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:35,400
Yes.
Applied biologics flow graft,

2877
02:14:35,401 --> 02:14:38,190
amniotic fluid therapy.
And um,

2878
02:14:38,250 --> 02:14:39,200
my friend,
uh,

2879
02:14:39,430 --> 02:14:44,430
Rodney Mcgee,
Dr Rodney Mcgee is a total sports 

2880
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:44,610
medicine in Vegas.
He's awesome.

2881
02:14:44,820 --> 02:14:47,280
He's such a knowledgeable guy too.
If you ever wanted to talk to him,

2882
02:14:47,281 --> 02:14:50,100
I get you in contact with them and he 
can explain all the details.

2883
02:14:50,101 --> 02:14:54,330
He talks like you took a fucking geek 
out together and confuse the shit out of

2884
02:14:54,350 --> 02:14:55,800
anybody standing next to you.
Well,

2885
02:14:55,801 --> 02:15:00,801
you know,
pretty soon they actually there you can 

2886
02:15:00,801 --> 02:15:00,801
make stem cells from skin cells now.
Yeah,

2887
02:15:00,801 --> 02:15:02,100
I've heard that.
I know they did that with a woman.

2888
02:15:02,100 --> 02:15:07,100
They created a new bladder for her.
She had bladder cancer and they created 

2889
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:11,181
a completely new bladder from her skin 
cells in a laboratory environment and 

2890
02:15:11,791 --> 02:15:14,400
then replaced her,
her damaged bladder.

2891
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:19,460
That's amazing.
I had only heard about the clinical 

2892
02:15:19,460 --> 02:15:19,590
study that they did with [inaudible] 
where like the woman,

2893
02:15:19,620 --> 02:15:22,320
some woman was,
had some sort of blindness and they were

2894
02:15:22,321 --> 02:15:24,510
able to use skin cells from her own 
skin.

2895
02:15:25,570 --> 02:15:26,330
You know,
clocks.

2896
02:15:26,340 --> 02:15:29,400
I'm into becoming retinal cells,
but bladder is really cool too.

2897
02:15:29,401 --> 02:15:34,401
I mean,
so there's these lots and lots of 

2898
02:15:34,401 --> 02:15:34,401
animals studies,
but every once in a while there's like a

2899
02:15:34,401 --> 02:15:36,180
new clinical study where they're just 
kind of piloting,

2900
02:15:36,430 --> 02:15:38,730
you know,
doing this and seeing the safety in,

2901
02:15:38,740 --> 02:15:43,740
in humans and that is where I'm like,
I can't wait like it's crazy stem cell 

2902
02:15:44,701 --> 02:15:47,150
injections for my brain,
you know,

2903
02:15:47,310 --> 02:15:52,310
I'm shooting her rent money or it's 
going to be very bizarre when we get 

2904
02:15:53,701 --> 02:15:55,950
past a healthy human state.

2905
02:15:56,220 --> 02:15:58,560
That's what I'm really not just 
concerned,

2906
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:02,280
not concerned about rather,
but curious about like it's curious,

2907
02:16:02,281 --> 02:16:05,820
it's not even a strong enough word,
but I feel like within our lifetimes,

2908
02:16:05,821 --> 02:16:07,590
maybe it's 50 years or whatever it's 
going to be,

2909
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:12,800
they're going to be able to engineer a 
human body to perform and I'm sure 

2910
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:17,780
you're aware of myostatin inhibitors and
the benefits that they've shown that the

2911
02:16:18,091 --> 02:16:20,850
accidental ones that they've done with 
like whippets and cows,

2912
02:16:21,030 --> 02:16:24,450
but now they've started to do it on 
purpose for mice and they're,

2913
02:16:24,840 --> 02:16:27,670
the mice are living longer.
They're super nice.

2914
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:30,610
They're are like way more muscular.

2915
02:16:30,790 --> 02:16:34,120
I think they're like two to three times 
more muscular than the average mouse.

2916
02:16:34,300 --> 02:16:39,300
They look freakish when they kill them.
When they killed him and they skin them 

2917
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:42,391
and they show the body of the miles 
compared to with the muscle structure 

2918
02:16:42,391 --> 02:16:42,400
and comparison to the body of a natural 
mouse.

2919
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:44,800
It's like,
what in the fuck are you doing here?

2920
02:16:44,801 --> 02:16:47,080
Like this is,
this is like the hulk.

2921
02:16:47,350 --> 02:16:50,140
It's like you're making a,
a tiny thing,

2922
02:16:50,410 --> 02:16:52,870
you know,
and you're putting all this extra muscle

2923
02:16:52,871 --> 02:16:55,090
on it and for whatever reason it's 
living longer.

2924
02:16:55,560 --> 02:16:56,240
Yeah.
That is,

2925
02:16:56,290 --> 02:16:58,780
that's the interesting part that it's 
living longer.

2926
02:16:59,050 --> 02:17:01,290
Trying to figure that out.
Like what you know,

2927
02:17:01,390 --> 02:17:03,460
because usually there's some sort of 
trade off where you're like,

2928
02:17:03,461 --> 02:17:05,230
well,
let's see if we could find that.

2929
02:17:05,231 --> 02:17:06,010
Jamie,
the thing,

2930
02:17:06,011 --> 02:17:11,011
the Mile Staton inhibitor studies they 
did on mice because their physical 

2931
02:17:11,011 --> 02:17:12,100
performance was extraordinary.

2932
02:17:12,100 --> 02:17:14,380
Like they could do things that the other
mice just could not do,

2933
02:17:14,770 --> 02:17:17,090
but on top of that they actually live 
longer.

2934
02:17:17,370 --> 02:17:18,070
Yeah,
that's,

2935
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:21,730
that's very interesting.
I know they were doing it with like pigs

2936
02:17:21,731 --> 02:17:25,010
too or something.
I seen some pigs or they'd done since,

2937
02:17:25,110 --> 02:17:27,940
I think they were doing gene engineering
on them with the and inhibitor.

2938
02:17:27,941 --> 02:17:30,430
But yeah,
it's all,

2939
02:17:30,460 --> 02:17:35,460
it's all very interesting.
They've done it with animals that you 

2940
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:35,460
use.
I mean they're,

2941
02:17:35,460 --> 02:17:40,231
they're thinking that you could do it 
with animals that we use for food and 

2942
02:17:40,231 --> 02:17:41,170
they would just,
they would provide more meat that way,

2943
02:17:41,560 --> 02:17:44,630
which is kind of interesting.
But what's man exactly what.

2944
02:17:44,770 --> 02:17:46,470
I found some,
a couple of different studies.

2945
02:17:46,480 --> 02:17:48,820
Some were older than like 10 years,
so I don't know.

2946
02:17:48,910 --> 02:17:50,110
Oh,
okay.

2947
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:55,230
It's cliche.
Muscle mass and muscle fiber in aged 

2948
02:17:55,230 --> 02:17:58,171
mice,
but does not increase bone density or 

2949
02:17:58,171 --> 02:17:58,171
bone strength.
Huh?

2950
02:17:58,171 --> 02:17:58,500
Be a problem.
Snap.

2951
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:05,920
That's an old study.
The [inaudible] from 2009.

2952
02:18:06,150 --> 02:18:09,190
It's 2013 is the one I clicked on.
Interesting.

2953
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:12,580
Uh,
maybe 2013 is probably where I saw it.

2954
02:18:12,610 --> 02:18:17,610
But the,
some of those images click on those 

2955
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:17,610
images,
Jamie,

2956
02:18:17,610 --> 02:18:17,610
because some of those images,
um,

2957
02:18:17,890 --> 02:18:22,890
you could see they had the like go down 
there with the mice carcasses right 

2958
02:18:22,890 --> 02:18:24,870
there.
I can see the difference in the size and

2959
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:25,760
no,
that's not it.

2960
02:18:25,870 --> 02:18:30,870
It's not necessarily a,
I think it's actually the one where you 

2961
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:30,870
made.
Was that

2962
02:18:30,870 --> 02:18:32,070
uh hm.

2963
02:18:32,730 --> 02:18:35,190
Well there's plenty to look at,
but yeah,

2964
02:18:35,191 --> 02:18:40,191
there it is.
You could see the difference in the 

2965
02:18:40,191 --> 02:18:42,750
muscle size from the average mouse,
which is on the left versus the 

2966
02:18:42,750 --> 02:18:45,570
milestone and mouse,
the milestone knockout mouse.

2967
02:18:45,810 --> 02:18:50,810
But look at what they're standing there.
That one mouse just looks like a giant 

2968
02:18:50,810 --> 02:18:53,580
ass power lifter mouse.
These are strange times when it comes to

2969
02:18:53,581 --> 02:18:55,890
the science.
Really strange times.

2970
02:18:56,660 --> 02:18:57,880
I mean,
muscle mass is,

2971
02:18:58,530 --> 02:19:01,830
that's exactly what I saw.
That's exactly the one that I saw

2972
02:19:02,910 --> 02:19:04,940
pool.
Good Lord.

2973
02:19:06,230 --> 02:19:07,250
It's incredible.

2974
02:19:07,720 --> 02:19:10,060
I mean,
you've got like two levels of it.

2975
02:19:10,061 --> 02:19:12,280
You've got level one,
level a,

2976
02:19:12,281 --> 02:19:14,560
and level b.
you've got the natural mouse,

2977
02:19:14,561 --> 02:19:16,690
which is on the left.
What is this image?

2978
02:19:16,691 --> 02:19:17,450
What does this,
uh,

2979
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:18,790
image title,
Jamie.

2980
02:19:18,791 --> 02:19:19,510
Sorry.
Okay.

2981
02:19:19,511 --> 02:19:22,600
Bodybuilding and Myostatin.
And there's an image of three mice.

2982
02:19:22,601 --> 02:19:24,520
One is a control,
which is the average mouse.

2983
02:19:24,850 --> 02:19:26,900
The other ones has dominant negative.
Uh,

2984
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:31,040
how does that work?
Go at Trib Trib two eyes,

2985
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:36,530
uh,
and the other one is follow staten and 

2986
02:19:36,530 --> 02:19:39,140
in the false downton want it is just a 
fucking Lee Haney of mice,

2987
02:19:39,660 --> 02:19:41,540
you know,
that's a giant ass mouse.

2988
02:19:41,750 --> 02:19:46,750
It's ridiculous.
It's like double the size of the middle 

2989
02:19:46,750 --> 02:19:49,901
mouse,
which is double the size of the other 

2990
02:19:49,901 --> 02:19:51,390
mount.
Either of those pathways are or what 

2991
02:19:51,390 --> 02:19:55,451
they do,
but clearly they regulate muscle mass 

2992
02:19:55,451 --> 02:19:57,480
was going on.
That would be kinda weird to like do an 

2993
02:19:57,480 --> 02:20:01,361
injection and like all of a sudden 
you're gaining lean muscle mass without 

2994
02:20:01,361 --> 02:20:02,630
like doing not doing anything.

2995
02:20:02,650 --> 02:20:07,650
Yeah.
It doesn't look like those mice are 

2996
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:07,650
working out.
No.

2997
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:07,650
That would be super weird.
You know,

2998
02:20:07,650 --> 02:20:08,690
that would,
I don't know.

2999
02:20:08,810 --> 02:20:10,730
Well that's one of the misconceptions 
about steroids.

3000
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:12,440
You know,
people think like you do.

3001
02:20:12,441 --> 02:20:15,200
Steroids just get bigger and muscular.
You actually have to work it out.

3002
02:20:15,260 --> 02:20:18,620
What this is a guy says is a milestone.
This is bullshit.

3003
02:20:19,160 --> 02:20:24,160
This is bullshit.
This is just don't even click on that 

3004
02:20:24,160 --> 02:20:27,370
can take that fucking off.
That's lies that these goddamn 

3005
02:20:27,370 --> 02:20:27,680
supplement companies that do that,
that's really gross.

3006
02:20:27,710 --> 02:20:32,710
One of the things they do is they pay 
someone to get in really great shape so 

3007
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:33,770
someone gets in really great shape,
like they'll give them steroids,

3008
02:20:33,771 --> 02:20:36,290
they'll pump them up and then they pay 
him to get fat.

3009
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:41,830
So they pay him to stop working out,
they get fat and then they changed the 

3010
02:20:41,830 --> 02:20:42,260
way the lighting is like.

3011
02:20:42,290 --> 02:20:47,290
One of the things that you could see 
when you're dealing with fraudulent 

3012
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:47,290
companies is,
uh,

3013
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:51,610
these shirt off picks before and after 
what a transformation is like in the,

3014
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:56,780
the good picture there,
Tan and the lighting is really good for 

3015
02:20:56,780 --> 02:20:57,440
accentuating muscle.
Uh,

3016
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:58,450
you know,
the,

3017
02:20:58,451 --> 02:21:00,770
the shape of the muscles and the shadows
and everything.

3018
02:21:00,771 --> 02:21:02,660
They look ripped.
And then the other one,

3019
02:21:02,661 --> 02:21:06,110
they're like pasty and white and they 
pay these guys to get fat.

3020
02:21:06,350 --> 02:21:07,910
A friend of mine,
they paid him to do it.

3021
02:21:08,450 --> 02:21:10,340
Yeah.
These things right here.

3022
02:21:10,520 --> 02:21:13,940
Like that guy on the right,
the after is the fucking before.

3023
02:21:14,120 --> 02:21:19,120
And the guy on the left that before is 
they paid that guy to stop working out 

3024
02:21:19,120 --> 02:21:20,750
and give facts.
People live with themselves.

3025
02:21:20,751 --> 02:21:22,280
Like doing that.
Like I just don't.

3026
02:21:22,400 --> 02:21:25,520
It seems like people are douchebags 
fraudulent.

3027
02:21:25,690 --> 02:21:26,920
There's a lot of monsters out there.

3028
02:21:27,070 --> 02:21:28,100
This is from bigger,
stronger,

3029
02:21:28,101 --> 02:21:30,290
faster.
I think this was actually taken like the

3030
02:21:30,290 --> 02:21:31,490
same day.
Oh,

3031
02:21:31,491 --> 02:21:36,491
what did some photoshop they do that.
They do that too,

3032
02:21:37,581 --> 02:21:39,860
for sure.
They definitely do that too.

3033
02:21:39,861 --> 02:21:44,861
And um,
our friend Chris Bell and Mark Bell who 

3034
02:21:44,861 --> 02:21:44,861
were in bigger,
stronger,

3035
02:21:44,861 --> 02:21:45,710
faster,
you know,

3036
02:21:45,910 --> 02:21:47,660
they know a lot more about that than we 
do.

3037
02:21:47,661 --> 02:21:50,750
Then there's a picture of him right 
above that that if you haven't seen that

3038
02:21:50,751 --> 02:21:52,910
documentary,
I highly recommend it bigger,

3039
02:21:52,911 --> 02:21:53,630
stronger,
faster,

3040
02:21:53,631 --> 02:21:57,770
which talks about the supplement 
industry and the use of steroids and all

3041
02:21:57,771 --> 02:21:59,760
these different things.
But that's one of the interesting.

3042
02:21:59,810 --> 02:22:01,370
Yeah,
it's one of the weird practices they do,

3043
02:22:01,371 --> 02:22:04,640
like if you look at any of those before 
and after pictures,

3044
02:22:04,641 --> 02:22:06,680
it's mostly what you're seeing.
I mean,

3045
02:22:06,681 --> 02:22:11,681
unless they're like a really ethical 
company and they hired someone to take 

3046
02:22:11,681 --> 02:22:14,681
their product and continue to work out.
But even then it's like when you show a 

3047
02:22:14,681 --> 02:22:14,990
before and after,
what was the guy doing before?

3048
02:22:14,991 --> 02:22:16,910
What was the guy doing after?
How much of that has diet?

3049
02:22:16,911 --> 02:22:19,310
How much that is exercise,
like how do you know,

3050
02:22:19,311 --> 02:22:21,660
you know,
did you get a blood test on this guy?

3051
02:22:21,661 --> 02:22:22,830
Is he on steroids?
Like what?

3052
02:22:22,890 --> 02:22:24,080
What's,
what's happening here?

3053
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:26,250
Yeah.
I think we should just focus on

3054
02:22:26,490 --> 02:22:27,590
ways we can actually.
Yeah,

3055
02:22:28,200 --> 02:22:31,140
science and ways we know like we can 
increase muscle mass,

3056
02:22:31,141 --> 02:22:31,920
you know,
obviously,

3057
02:22:32,350 --> 02:22:37,350
you know,
weight lifting and I don't mean to beat 

3058
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:37,350
up on Aubrey de grey,
but when you,

3059
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:40,140
when you brought up the science of 
nutrition and the factors,

3060
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:41,050
you know,
the,

3061
02:22:41,051 --> 02:22:42,900
the,
the positive benefits of it.

3062
02:22:42,990 --> 02:22:46,590
Like what was his reaction and what 
episodes of this podcast,

3063
02:22:46,910 --> 02:22:51,420
the podcast that I did,
I can't remember what episode,

3064
02:22:51,421 --> 02:22:55,770
but it's been a year and a half.
At least I would say.

3065
02:22:55,980 --> 02:22:59,250
Um,
I can't remember his exact reaction.

3066
02:22:59,251 --> 02:23:04,251
I mean,
you can tell if you listen to the pot I 

3067
02:23:04,251 --> 02:23:04,251
talk,
I talk a lot about,

3068
02:23:04,251 --> 02:23:08,270
we talk a lot about crispr and stem cell
and a lot of these possible therapies 

3069
02:23:09,421 --> 02:23:11,970
that are being used that can potentially
extend lifespan.

3070
02:23:12,330 --> 02:23:17,330
But there's a point in the podcast where
nutrition comes up and you can tell it 

3071
02:23:18,001 --> 02:23:23,001
gets a little awkward between the two of
us because we kind of have different 

3072
02:23:23,001 --> 02:23:25,701
viewpoints and I'm,
I'm sort of not trying to be rude 

3073
02:23:25,701 --> 02:23:25,920
because look at them,
they're fucking wizard.

3074
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:31,340
We were like so close and his office and
he's anyways,

3075
02:23:32,610 --> 02:23:35,310
he's an odd guy.
That beard is fucking awesome though.

3076
02:23:35,370 --> 02:23:38,640
God Damn that point was just that you 
can't,

3077
02:23:38,820 --> 02:23:42,660
you're not gonna,
you're not gonna extend lifespan by,

3078
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:48,170
you know,
40 or 50 percent with diet and that's 

3079
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:48,170
what he wants to do.
Right.

3080
02:23:48,170 --> 02:23:50,910
And that's fair.
But the point that I think,

3081
02:23:50,970 --> 02:23:51,950
you know,
it's,

3082
02:23:52,060 --> 02:23:57,060
it's one thing to say that and another 
thing to kind of disregard nutrition 

3083
02:23:57,060 --> 02:23:57,060
altogether,
you know,

3084
02:23:57,060 --> 02:24:00,360
because that's because that's just 
stupid nutrition plays a role in the way

3085
02:24:00,361 --> 02:24:02,100
you age.
And so I think that should be,

3086
02:24:02,670 --> 02:24:07,670
you know,
it shouldn't be something that people 

3087
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:07,670
should completely disregard,
disregard and not think about and not.

3088
02:24:07,670 --> 02:24:09,900
And not even not thinking about.
But when they talk publicly,

3089
02:24:10,110 --> 02:24:11,070
talk it down.
Like,

3090
02:24:11,071 --> 02:24:13,320
I don't like that.
Like that's fine.

3091
02:24:13,321 --> 02:24:15,450
If you want to focus on technologies 
and,

3092
02:24:15,510 --> 02:24:16,850
and I agree with that,
I mean I'm,

3093
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:18,450
I'm all about,
you know,

3094
02:24:18,600 --> 02:24:21,960
all these gene therapy technologies and 
crispr and you know,

3095
02:24:22,260 --> 02:24:24,840
induced pluripotent stem cells and I'm a
huge,

3096
02:24:24,841 --> 02:24:29,841
huge fan of all that,
but I don't think that being a fan of 

3097
02:24:29,841 --> 02:24:32,500
that and being excited about what the 
science and what new technologies are,

3098
02:24:32,770 --> 02:24:35,040
are gonna be able to bring us,
should,

3099
02:24:35,080 --> 02:24:40,080
you know,
make us talk about like kind of poop on 

3100
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:40,080
nutrition,
right?

3101
02:24:40,080 --> 02:24:44,120
Watching the also a big factor is the 
way you feel and a big factor too.

3102
02:24:45,301 --> 02:24:50,301
I mean,
I assume they just doesn't just want to 

3103
02:24:50,301 --> 02:24:50,301
extend a shitty life,
right?

3104
02:24:50,301 --> 02:24:52,380
You want to extend a life where you feel
wonderful,

3105
02:24:52,381 --> 02:24:53,140
right?
Right.

3106
02:24:53,141 --> 02:24:56,820
And well if your booze and all the time 
like he is that guy boozes every day.

3107
02:24:57,330 --> 02:24:59,820
I talked to him like we were drunk as 
fuck in New York.

3108
02:24:59,821 --> 02:25:00,620
I went to that.
Um,

3109
02:25:01,080 --> 02:25:03,750
what is it,
2045 conference.

3110
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:04,770
Uh,
there's a,

3111
02:25:04,771 --> 02:25:09,771
a conference in New York where all of 
these nutty people who think you're 

3112
02:25:09,771 --> 02:25:13,440
going to be able to download your brain 
into a super computer and the year 20,

3113
02:25:13,441 --> 02:25:18,441
45 like this extended life conference 
and a lot of it was run by this Russian 

3114
02:25:18,441 --> 02:25:19,580
billionaire that I talked to,
which was,

3115
02:25:19,820 --> 02:25:23,680
who was a very odd character,
but he was building a robot that they

3116
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:26,320
were not satisfied with the results of 
this robot.

3117
02:25:26,980 --> 02:25:27,700
So they,
uh,

3118
02:25:27,730 --> 02:25:31,000
they never a unearthed it.
They never unveiled it rather.

3119
02:25:31,480 --> 02:25:35,050
But these all these people is 20,
45 conference in New York.

3120
02:25:35,051 --> 02:25:40,051
We're all like this gathering of these 
super geeks that are all in various ways

3121
02:25:41,650 --> 02:25:44,530
trying to extend life.
And Aubrey de Grey was there as well and

3122
02:25:44,560 --> 02:25:46,720
I met him at the bar and we just got 
fucking hammered.

3123
02:25:47,320 --> 02:25:48,970
We got hammered and we're talking.
I'm like,

3124
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:51,080
is,
are we extending life that's going on?

3125
02:25:51,090 --> 02:25:52,480
It feels like we're just drinking 
guinness.

3126
02:25:54,140 --> 02:25:57,610
You are causing massive inflammation.
Brain cell death.

3127
02:25:57,700 --> 02:26:00,370
This is terrible.
What are we doing?

3128
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:07,380
But you know,
those are two very contrary ways of 

3129
02:26:07,380 --> 02:26:09,190
existing to,
to extend life.

3130
02:26:09,191 --> 02:26:13,270
But yet to diminish the potential of the
life you're currently experiencing,

3131
02:26:13,450 --> 02:26:13,830
but,
you know,

3132
02:26:13,950 --> 02:26:14,890
I guess he's having fun,

3133
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:15,690
you know?
Yeah.

3134
02:26:15,691 --> 02:26:16,500
I don't,
you know,

3135
02:26:16,501 --> 02:26:19,260
he was an interesting guy and I enjoyed 
talking to him,

3136
02:26:19,261 --> 02:26:24,261
but I don't want to talk bad about him.
But when I was very shocked when I 

3137
02:26:24,261 --> 02:26:27,561
walked into his office that literally 
like 11 in the morning and he had 

3138
02:26:27,561 --> 02:26:28,300
already down two beers and you respond 
is third.

3139
02:26:29,630 --> 02:26:32,280
And I was just like,
I didn't,

3140
02:26:32,780 --> 02:26:35,040
I wasn't expecting that.
I wasn't.

3141
02:26:35,070 --> 02:26:37,050
I mean,
it was completely shocking to me.

3142
02:26:38,310 --> 02:26:43,110
God bless him out there hammering it.
Who knows?

3143
02:26:43,140 --> 02:26:43,950
Yeah.
Yeah.

3144
02:26:43,951 --> 02:26:46,800
But I guess there's a lot of different 
approaches and I think he's,

3145
02:26:46,860 --> 02:26:48,450
his approach is welcomed.
It's interesting.

3146
02:26:48,451 --> 02:26:48,920
It's an,
it's,

3147
02:26:48,980 --> 02:26:53,980
it's just as important to have a guy 
like that that's kind of fucking up his 

3148
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:56,000
body and still still after it.
Like,

3149
02:26:56,001 --> 02:26:57,090
it's,
it's interesting,

3150
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:58,720
right?
Um,

3151
02:26:59,020 --> 02:27:01,140
you know this,
like I was saying though,

3152
02:27:01,160 --> 02:27:04,800
the thing that with him and I,
you know,

3153
02:27:04,801 --> 02:27:09,801
the,
the major differences is focusing on 

3154
02:27:09,801 --> 02:27:09,801
nutrition and that's something that,
um,

3155
02:27:09,801 --> 02:27:12,750
that I want to get the message across 
that I want something to do right now.

3156
02:27:12,910 --> 02:27:14,550
So maybe you can do right now until an 
end.

3157
02:27:14,551 --> 02:27:18,660
In the meanwhile still telling people 
about the awesome science coming out.

3158
02:27:18,661 --> 02:27:21,360
But until then,
let's keep,

3159
02:27:21,570 --> 02:27:23,970
let's keep it going.
They're not mutually exclusive.

3160
02:27:24,030 --> 02:27:26,280
They're not,
they're not mutually exclusive.

3161
02:27:27,090 --> 02:27:27,990
The other,
you know,

3162
02:27:27,991 --> 02:27:30,630
one of the things that when we were 
talking about the muscle mass,

3163
02:27:30,631 --> 02:27:33,960
I started thinking about this time 
restricted eating.

3164
02:27:34,410 --> 02:27:37,410
Have you heard about this at all time?
Restricted eating a little bit,

3165
02:27:37,920 --> 02:27:40,830
like eating within a certain time 
period.

3166
02:27:40,831 --> 02:27:45,831
That correlates,
corresponds to like the day it has 

3167
02:27:45,831 --> 02:27:48,780
really profound effects on muscle mass 
without any other factors that having to

3168
02:27:48,781 --> 02:27:53,781
exercise or anything.
That's something that's extremely 

3169
02:27:53,781 --> 02:27:53,781
interesting.
Interesting.

3170
02:27:53,781 --> 02:27:56,370
But this time restricted eating is,
it's very important for,

3171
02:27:56,400 --> 02:28:01,400
for health and metabolism.
It's also something I've been obsessed 

3172
02:28:01,400 --> 02:28:03,540
with since like probably early summer 
I've been doing it like just,

3173
02:28:04,280 --> 02:28:09,280
you know,
really fanatically making sure that I'm 

3174
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:09,280
eating within like uh,
uh,

3175
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:11,820
no more than 12 hour period.
I try to do like 10 hours.

3176
02:28:12,180 --> 02:28:16,520
So like when you wake up in the morning,
you have a cup of coffee or you know,

3177
02:28:16,770 --> 02:28:21,620
you eat even a cup of black coffee,
the first thing you put into your system

3178
02:28:21,621 --> 02:28:22,100
that's not

3179
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:26,330
water starts all these metabolic enzymes
start some in your liver,

3180
02:28:26,570 --> 02:28:31,570
your gut starts using these enzymes and 
those enzymes are on a clock because 

3181
02:28:31,570 --> 02:28:35,441
humans are diurnal creatures where we're
meant to be awake and working and active

3182
02:28:35,960 --> 02:28:38,120
and thinking during the day and we sleep
at night,

3183
02:28:38,150 --> 02:28:43,150
which is different from nocturnal 
creatures like some rodents and other 

3184
02:28:43,150 --> 02:28:43,150
animals that are,
you know,

3185
02:28:43,150 --> 02:28:44,120
sleep during the day and,
or night.

3186
02:28:44,330 --> 02:28:47,120
So because we're men,
we are active during the day.

3187
02:28:47,121 --> 02:28:48,140
We're diurnal,
all these,

3188
02:28:48,141 --> 02:28:50,150
all of our metabolism,
metabolism,

3189
02:28:50,151 --> 02:28:52,910
enzymes and all these things are active 
during the day.

3190
02:28:53,470 --> 02:28:56,330
Um,
and things that activate them are light,

3191
02:28:56,840 --> 02:29:01,730
light exposure and also food intake.
And xenobiotic is also something,

3192
02:29:01,731 --> 02:29:05,540
so anything that gets metabolized like 
buyer buyer system by your liver,

3193
02:29:05,550 --> 02:29:08,810
whatever activates these enzymes and 
once they're activated,

3194
02:29:09,380 --> 02:29:12,110
they're on this like 12 hour clock where
it's like,

3195
02:29:12,111 --> 02:29:14,870
okay,
so you're metabolizing glucose,

3196
02:29:14,871 --> 02:29:16,310
fatty acids,
all these things,

3197
02:29:16,311 --> 02:29:21,311
you know,
well if you're eating within that 12 

3198
02:29:21,311 --> 02:29:23,801
hour clock,
but when you go beyond that 12 hour 

3199
02:29:23,801 --> 02:29:26,471
clock,
that's when things start to go really 

3200
02:29:26,471 --> 02:29:28,010
wrong because your metabolism enzymes 
start to shut down and they're not doing

3201
02:29:28,011 --> 02:29:28,700
things properly.

3202
02:29:28,700 --> 02:29:33,700
So you're not like insulin responsive,
you're not even fatty acids and things 

3203
02:29:33,700 --> 02:29:37,601
like that.
Just metabolism in general is not 

3204
02:29:37,601 --> 02:29:37,601
working as well,
you know,

3205
02:29:37,601 --> 02:29:40,280
after 12 hours.
And so that's kind of a big eyeopener.

3206
02:29:40,310 --> 02:29:41,680
I know there was,
um,

3207
02:29:42,350 --> 02:29:45,290
a lot of people think they eat 12 hour 
time period.

3208
02:29:45,291 --> 02:29:46,610
Like if you were to survey them,
like,

3209
02:29:46,611 --> 02:29:49,040
Oh yeah,
I don't eat more than 12 hours.

3210
02:29:49,041 --> 02:29:54,041
But there's actually a study done by a 
friend of mine who's a expert in this 

3211
02:29:54,041 --> 02:29:54,880
field.
He's at the Sulk Institute.

3212
02:29:54,881 --> 02:29:58,490
His name is satchin panda.
I'm very good scientists.

3213
02:29:58,550 --> 02:30:02,720
I interviewed him on my podcast and he's
done a lot of research on this,

3214
02:30:02,900 --> 02:30:07,900
this topic,
and he did the human study where he had 

3215
02:30:07,900 --> 02:30:09,950
like this app where people logged there,
they took pictures of the food that they

3216
02:30:09,951 --> 02:30:11,560
ate and it like,
you know,

3217
02:30:11,600 --> 02:30:16,600
sent it to some database they had and it
had a timestamp on it so they could see 

3218
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:16,600
when the clock,
when they,

3219
02:30:16,600 --> 02:30:18,560
when their first cup of coffee or 
whatever was in the morning,

3220
02:30:18,561 --> 02:30:19,190
and then when they were eating.

3221
02:30:19,210 --> 02:30:23,450
And I turned out most people were 
actually eating in a 15 hour clock.

3222
02:30:23,750 --> 02:30:26,330
So they were having their cup of coffee,
you know,

3223
02:30:26,331 --> 02:30:28,100
at eight,
seven in the morning.

3224
02:30:28,101 --> 02:30:28,880
And they were,
you know,

3225
02:30:28,890 --> 02:30:31,790
they're eating at like nine,
nine,

3226
02:30:31,791 --> 02:30:32,780
10,
10:00.

3227
02:30:32,781 --> 02:30:34,730
Yeah.
So they're eating much later.

3228
02:30:35,050 --> 02:30:36,230
Um,
the,

3229
02:30:36,620 --> 02:30:39,050
the thing is,
is that when you do that,

3230
02:30:39,051 --> 02:30:41,480
you start to gain more,
more fat.

3231
02:30:41,481 --> 02:30:44,000
You start to become more insulin 
insensitive and you start to like,

3232
02:30:44,001 --> 02:30:47,120
your muscle starts to waste regardless 
of what you eat,

3233
02:30:47,300 --> 02:30:49,040
regardless of what you eat.
So,

3234
02:30:49,180 --> 02:30:50,120
so okay.
No,

3235
02:30:50,121 --> 02:30:52,610
I take that back.
So you,

3236
02:30:52,611 --> 02:30:54,920
if you eat healthy,
if you eat healthy,

3237
02:30:54,980 --> 02:30:57,770
so if you're eating a terrible diet,
if you're eating a terrible diet,

3238
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:00,560
and this has been shown in mice like 
Lard,

3239
02:31:01,160 --> 02:31:03,800
fat plus sugar,
those two together,

3240
02:31:03,801 --> 02:31:08,801
which is the actual bad combination,
but you brought that up and I'm gonna 

3241
02:31:08,801 --> 02:31:09,450
make a note to keep those two are the 
bad combination.

3242
02:31:09,451 --> 02:31:10,790
So if you eat,
if you're eating that,

3243
02:31:10,791 --> 02:31:15,791
if you're feeding the mice that and you 
let them eat whenever they want so they 

3244
02:31:15,791 --> 02:31:18,941
can eat their nocturnal,
but I'm just going to call it day and 

3245
02:31:18,941 --> 02:31:19,160
their day is actually night.
Just know that that's true.

3246
02:31:19,380 --> 02:31:20,130
If they're eating

3247
02:31:20,130 --> 02:31:22,890
during the day and night,
they gain like,

3248
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:24,420
you know,
tons of ways to come.

3249
02:31:24,430 --> 02:31:25,830
Fat become like,
you know,

3250
02:31:25,831 --> 02:31:27,840
type two diabetic,
fatty liver.

3251
02:31:27,841 --> 02:31:30,190
I mean they're just a mess.
They're breaking down like,

3252
02:31:30,480 --> 02:31:34,200
like earlier than they should.
But if you eat normal,

3253
02:31:34,201 --> 02:31:36,870
so if you're eating a healthy diet 
that's not high fat,

3254
02:31:36,871 --> 02:31:39,330
high sugar,
you don't necessarily,

3255
02:31:39,331 --> 02:31:41,550
you're not necessarily gonna gain more 
fat,

3256
02:31:42,020 --> 02:31:47,020
you don't,
you don't become type two diabetic and 

3257
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:47,020
all that.
If you're not eating all the crap.

3258
02:31:47,020 --> 02:31:50,870
So you probably just going to be okay,
but if you take that same mouse who 

3259
02:31:50,910 --> 02:31:55,910
eating a healthy diet and you make it 
eat within a time restricted window of 

3260
02:31:55,910 --> 02:31:58,050
at least 12 hours,
actually the best wisdom,

3261
02:31:58,080 --> 02:32:02,040
nine to 10,
they gain way more muscle mass.

3262
02:32:02,070 --> 02:32:04,200
This is on a normal diet,
just way more muscle mass.

3263
02:32:04,201 --> 02:32:09,201
And if they ate within a nine hour 
window they had like a really improved 

3264
02:32:09,201 --> 02:32:09,201
endurance.

3265
02:32:09,201 --> 02:32:11,670
That's something I've noticed in myself.
I eat within a nine hour window and I go

3266
02:32:11,671 --> 02:32:16,671
for a run the next morning.
My endurance is like very noticeably 

3267
02:32:16,921 --> 02:32:19,860
improved,
like extremely noticeably improved.

3268
02:32:19,890 --> 02:32:22,850
So do you have like a timer or like how 
do you do,

3269
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:25,200
do you time yourself at the beginning of
your day?

3270
02:32:25,201 --> 02:32:27,510
Like when you first eat and then.
Yeah.

3271
02:32:27,511 --> 02:32:32,511
So I typically will make.
So my friend Kevin rose has an APP that 

3272
02:32:32,511 --> 02:32:34,110
like um,
it's called darn what did he.

3273
02:32:34,770 --> 02:32:36,800
Kevin rose has an APP.
Yeah.

3274
02:32:37,030 --> 02:32:37,730
Yeah,
I've had them on.

3275
02:32:37,731 --> 02:32:38,730
I love that guy.
Yeah,

3276
02:32:38,731 --> 02:32:41,560
he's awesome.
He just cute agenda proponent as well.

3277
02:32:42,030 --> 02:32:47,030
Yeah.
He doesn't actually do Keto anymore 

3278
02:32:47,030 --> 02:32:48,771
because it's uh,
after he got a bunch of blood work done 

3279
02:32:48,771 --> 02:32:49,830
and I mean there's,
there's different,

3280
02:32:49,831 --> 02:32:54,831
you know,
genes that people have that can affect 

3281
02:32:54,831 --> 02:32:54,831
the way they respond to that sort of 
diet.

3282
02:32:54,831 --> 02:32:55,650
Most of the time people can respond 
good,

3283
02:32:55,651 --> 02:33:00,651
but there's a dizzy was on here just one
of them long ago introducing zero that's

3284
02:33:00,870 --> 02:33:04,410
app to help you fast.
So he has an app that helps you do that.

3285
02:33:04,411 --> 02:33:06,090
That actually works really well.
Personally,

3286
02:33:06,091 --> 02:33:11,091
what I do is I'm just kind of crazy 
about it and I just remember it that 

3287
02:33:11,091 --> 02:33:11,091
day.
So I'm like,

3288
02:33:11,091 --> 02:33:13,770
okay,
I had my first cup of coffee at 8:00

3289
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:18,770
AM,
but his app actually is really cool 

3290
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:18,770
because it really helps you keep 
dragging.

3291
02:33:18,770 --> 02:33:19,770
It sends you reminders so like helps 
you.

3292
02:33:19,771 --> 02:33:22,200
And it's a free app.
So powerful.

3293
02:33:22,201 --> 02:33:23,700
Kevin rose.
Anyways,

3294
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:28,760
it's really cool because you can just 
like literally these mice were gaining 

3295
02:33:28,760 --> 02:33:32,181
more muscle mass just not by doing 
anything but eating within this time 

3296
02:33:32,181 --> 02:33:33,080
restricted window.
And um,

3297
02:33:33,180 --> 02:33:36,300
the thing that was also very interesting
about this was that,

3298
02:33:36,360 --> 02:33:41,360
um,
you could cheat a couple of days a week 

3299
02:33:41,360 --> 02:33:45,230
so they could like,
like let's say weekends when you have 

3300
02:33:45,230 --> 02:33:45,510
like social events and you're like out 
drinking or whatever,

3301
02:33:46,260 --> 02:33:51,260
you can,
you can cheat two nights and still have 

3302
02:33:51,260 --> 02:33:51,810
the same benefits so that at least in 
mice,

3303
02:33:51,811 --> 02:33:53,130
we don't know if that's the same for 
humans.

3304
02:33:53,160 --> 02:33:58,160
Sachin's doing,
trying to aggregate some data with 

3305
02:33:58,160 --> 02:34:01,011
humans.
He actually has an ongoing trial that 

3306
02:34:01,011 --> 02:34:01,011
anyone can sign up for.
Um,

3307
02:34:01,011 --> 02:34:05,240
it's called my circadian clock and it's 
an also an app on his phone that you 

3308
02:34:05,240 --> 02:34:07,290
just basically all you do is sign a 
consent form,

3309
02:34:07,710 --> 02:34:12,110
take pictures of your food and uh,
and like allow certain data,

3310
02:34:12,200 --> 02:34:13,410
you know,
different,

3311
02:34:13,411 --> 02:34:14,970
different fitness data for them to 
collect.

3312
02:34:14,971 --> 02:34:16,920
And so they're doing this clinical 
study,

3313
02:34:17,410 --> 02:34:19,030
humans from data that they're 
aggregating,

3314
02:34:19,031 --> 02:34:22,150
which is kind of cool.
Jen is fasting tracker right now.

3315
02:34:23,020 --> 02:34:23,800
Yeah.
And you can do,

3316
02:34:23,801 --> 02:34:26,230
he has different options for Kevin's 
fasting.

3317
02:34:26,231 --> 02:34:29,230
It's like the circadian option,
which is the one I'm talking about.

3318
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:34,590
And then there's like people that are 
doing intermittent fasting and what's 

3319
02:34:34,590 --> 02:34:35,580
the circadian option?
That's the time restricted eating.

3320
02:34:35,600 --> 02:34:40,600
That's certainly.
That's just basically circadian is the 

3321
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:40,600
circadian clock you're on.

3322
02:34:40,600 --> 02:34:42,160
So that's what.
It's this 24 hour cycle day,

3323
02:34:42,280 --> 02:34:47,280
day night cycle.
So eating within at least a 12 hour 

3324
02:34:47,280 --> 02:34:49,720
window is so 12 hour is the most you 
ever most.

3325
02:34:49,721 --> 02:34:54,721
So if you get up at 8:00
in the morning and that's when you have 

3326
02:34:54,721 --> 02:34:54,721
your first cup of coffee,
that's when it starts.

3327
02:34:54,721 --> 02:34:56,560
Not with food.
It starts with First Cup of coffee.

3328
02:34:56,561 --> 02:35:01,561
Because that's interesting because a lot
of people don't think that they think 

3329
02:35:01,561 --> 02:35:02,110
that they're still fast and they have a 
cup of coffee and then they go run.

3330
02:35:02,350 --> 02:35:05,710
That's the thing.
I'm so because coffee,

3331
02:35:05,711 --> 02:35:10,711
even if it's black,
so people think if they have black 

3332
02:35:10,711 --> 02:35:10,711
coffee,
they're fasting and they go run.

3333
02:35:10,711 --> 02:35:12,790
But black coffee is caffeine is a 
xenobiotic.

3334
02:35:12,791 --> 02:35:15,370
It's something that has to be 
metabolized by liver enzymes.

3335
02:35:15,371 --> 02:35:18,580
Your gut processes it.
So anything that happens in water,

3336
02:35:18,910 --> 02:35:20,680
exactly.
Anything other than water.

3337
02:35:20,740 --> 02:35:25,740
And the same goes for like taking 
vitamin pills and drinking herbal tea 

3338
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:25,740
late at night,
like the same,

3339
02:35:25,740 --> 02:35:26,980
the same thing goes.
Even herbal tea.

3340
02:35:27,280 --> 02:35:31,600
Herbal tea is also got irb stuff in it.
So Kevin non-caffeinated herbal tea.

3341
02:35:32,130 --> 02:35:34,350
Yeah.
Because those are xenobiotics camomile.

3342
02:35:34,540 --> 02:35:36,910
I mean that stuff's got to be processed 
by your liver,

3343
02:35:37,130 --> 02:35:38,410
your gut.
It's not,

3344
02:35:38,440 --> 02:35:41,320
it's not water.
You know.

3345
02:35:41,321 --> 02:35:46,321
So I mean,
and this is something that's kind of a 

3346
02:35:46,321 --> 02:35:46,321
big question and that is,
well,

3347
02:35:46,321 --> 02:35:47,230
if the fascinate,
let's say you're,

3348
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:52,320
you're eating within a nine hour window 
or 10 hour window is optimal.

3349
02:35:53,200 --> 02:35:58,200
Nine hours is really what I found to be 
optimal for endurance in terms of the 

3350
02:35:58,200 --> 02:35:59,920
animal studies,
like 10 hours.

3351
02:35:59,921 --> 02:36:02,920
Also if they eating their healthy diet 
within 10 hours,

3352
02:36:02,921 --> 02:36:07,030
they still had um,
they increase their lean muscle mass.

3353
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:11,020
They didn't have to do anything else.
No extra exercising it just because what

3354
02:36:11,021 --> 02:36:13,480
was happening is they were,
they were basically,

3355
02:36:13,530 --> 02:36:18,530
I'm,
their mitochondria are working better 

3356
02:36:18,530 --> 02:36:18,530
and they were also.

3357
02:36:18,530 --> 02:36:19,980
I'm getting rid of fat easier.
So you know,

3358
02:36:19,990 --> 02:36:23,140
so it increased their lean muscle mass.
That's incredible because I,

3359
02:36:23,440 --> 02:36:26,710
I late at night all the time.
Well you're a comedian.

3360
02:36:26,950 --> 02:36:31,950
I mean that's probably,
you probably eat after a show or 

3361
02:36:31,950 --> 02:36:31,950
something.
He came home last night at 2:00

3362
02:36:31,950 --> 02:36:32,230
in the morning,
pigged out after a show.

3363
02:36:32,260 --> 02:36:36,220
I mean it was healthy food.
I like Kiefer and pistachio nuts.

3364
02:36:36,820 --> 02:36:41,770
I buy those big jugs of shelled 
pistachios shells,

3365
02:36:42,010 --> 02:36:47,010
so I just eat like piles of pistachios 
because I feel like I'm not eating 

3366
02:36:47,010 --> 02:36:47,530
anything bad.
That's good for you.

3367
02:36:47,890 --> 02:36:51,210
But this knowledge now knowing this,
I'm going to.

3368
02:36:51,250 --> 02:36:54,280
I'm going to cut that out now.
Please let me know how that goes.

3369
02:36:54,520 --> 02:36:55,870
I'm going to start right now.
Yeah,

3370
02:36:55,871 --> 02:36:57,100
that's awesome.
I mean,

3371
02:36:57,101 --> 02:36:58,060
like I said,
you can cheat.

3372
02:36:58,061 --> 02:36:59,980
There is cheating at least in mice 
twice.

3373
02:37:00,040 --> 02:37:01,510
Twice a week was okay.

3374
02:37:01,630 --> 02:37:03,580
Two Times a week is a good cheat.
Yeah.

3375
02:37:03,581 --> 02:37:05,230
And that's kind of cool because it's 
like a weekend.

3376
02:37:05,231 --> 02:37:05,700
Right?
Right.

3377
02:37:06,160 --> 02:37:07,990
You know,
so you have your social event it,

3378
02:37:07,991 --> 02:37:10,360
it's hard to do with social events and 
stuff.

3379
02:37:10,361 --> 02:37:15,361
If you have like something late and you 
kind of have to fast are all early in 

3380
02:37:15,361 --> 02:37:16,070
the morning all the way up and so you 
can do it later,

3381
02:37:16,520 --> 02:37:21,520
you know what I mean?
But I do a lot of workouts fasted now 

3382
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:24,740
and one of the things that I like to do 
is I'd get up in the morning without 

3383
02:37:24,740 --> 02:37:26,470
having anything and then I work out.
But I've been having coffee so I,

3384
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:28,430
I thought I was fasting.
He will see.

3385
02:37:28,431 --> 02:37:33,431
The thing is,
and this is kind of what I was talking 

3386
02:37:33,431 --> 02:37:33,431
with Satya and about,
is that it's,

3387
02:37:33,431 --> 02:37:37,960
if you're fasting itself,
the fasting itself is having a positive 

3388
02:37:37,960 --> 02:37:38,120
effect on all these enzymes.

3389
02:37:38,420 --> 02:37:42,590
So maybe there's some sort of canceled 
out.

3390
02:37:42,800 --> 02:37:43,610
It's not,
not,

3391
02:37:43,730 --> 02:37:45,890
it's not as good.
Not as good I would say.

3392
02:37:46,250 --> 02:37:51,250
So just water.
We don't have actual empirical data on 

3393
02:37:51,250 --> 02:37:51,250
that saying,
okay,

3394
02:37:51,250 --> 02:37:55,361
well you know,
and that's something that Satya and 

3395
02:37:55,361 --> 02:37:55,361
would like to look at and humans because
it's like a big question.

3396
02:37:55,361 --> 02:37:57,480
What if you are just fasting,
uh,

3397
02:37:57,490 --> 02:37:59,870
in the bay?
In theory it's not,

3398
02:37:59,980 --> 02:38:02,360
you're starting all those clocks.
The clocks are difficult.

3399
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:05,030
Caffeine starts the clocks that's around
so,

3400
02:38:05,180 --> 02:38:05,860
but then again,
you know,

3401
02:38:05,950 --> 02:38:08,330
like I said,
fasting changes your metabolism in a way

3402
02:38:08,331 --> 02:38:09,350
too.
That makes it better.

3403
02:38:09,351 --> 02:38:12,710
So maybe it's not quite as bad.
Not quite as bad,

3404
02:38:12,711 --> 02:38:14,120
but not as formal.
Exactly.

3405
02:38:14,270 --> 02:38:15,410
I like that.
That's perfect.

3406
02:38:15,760 --> 02:38:18,350
Yeah.
So shoot for nine hours.

3407
02:38:19,070 --> 02:38:21,500
That was like that nine hours is the 
best,

3408
02:38:21,800 --> 02:38:24,050
especially for endurance,
like enhancements,

3409
02:38:24,380 --> 02:38:27,440
like really.
So if you get up and you're at,

3410
02:38:27,560 --> 02:38:29,570
you know,
you're up at 8:00

3411
02:38:29,571 --> 02:38:31,040
in the morning or 7:00
in the morning,

3412
02:38:31,041 --> 02:38:36,041
whatever it is,
you almost have to eat dinner like at 

3413
02:38:36,041 --> 02:38:36,041
five.

3414
02:38:36,041 --> 02:38:36,680
Yeah,
that's the problem.

3415
02:38:36,681 --> 02:38:41,681
You have to,
you have to either fast in the morning 

3416
02:38:41,681 --> 02:38:44,230
where you have to eat early,
which is really hard for working people 

3417
02:38:44,230 --> 02:38:45,470
nine to fivers yeah,
I mean it's like you're eating breakfast

3418
02:38:45,471 --> 02:38:48,570
before you go to work unless you're not 
right now.

3419
02:38:48,700 --> 02:38:50,840
And that's kind of the problem for 
people that are going,

3420
02:38:50,870 --> 02:38:52,660
you know,
humans,

3421
02:38:53,540 --> 02:38:54,780
we have,
you know,

3422
02:38:54,890 --> 02:38:57,550
life is kind of different now,
but it's,

3423
02:38:57,640 --> 02:39:02,640
you know,
there are people that we're talking 

3424
02:39:02,640 --> 02:39:04,061
about you,
they just take their breakfast to work 

3425
02:39:04,061 --> 02:39:04,061
and they wait so they'll wait till like 
10:00

3426
02:39:04,061 --> 02:39:07,841
to eat or something like that because 
also there's people that like to go to 

3427
02:39:07,841 --> 02:39:08,480
the gym after work and so that's more 
time.

3428
02:39:08,481 --> 02:39:11,030
It's like you gotta get a racist clock,
I got to eat,

3429
02:39:11,190 --> 02:39:16,190
you know,
so really if you can start the clock 

3430
02:39:16,190 --> 02:39:18,371
later,
if that's possible for people that are 

3431
02:39:18,371 --> 02:39:18,590
working like that,
they don't have flexible hours,

3432
02:39:18,900 --> 02:39:23,900
um,
then then it would be better to start 

3433
02:39:23,900 --> 02:39:23,900
the clock later.

3434
02:39:23,900 --> 02:39:27,100
And there's a lot of human data on this,
like just looking at like the 

3435
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:30,311
associations between people that eat 
within an 11 hour period and fast for 13

3436
02:39:31,161 --> 02:39:32,750
hours.
For example,

3437
02:39:32,751 --> 02:39:34,850
women that do that,
that have already had breast cancer,

3438
02:39:34,851 --> 02:39:38,480
they reduced their breast cancer risk 
recurrence by like 40 percent,

3439
02:39:38,870 --> 02:39:39,740
you know?
Wow.

3440
02:39:39,780 --> 02:39:41,270
Yeah.
Because it lowers,

3441
02:39:41,600 --> 02:39:42,130
it,
it,

3442
02:39:42,260 --> 02:39:46,220
it causes insulin sensitivity,
it lowers igf one levels.

3443
02:39:46,460 --> 02:39:47,220
I mean,
it's just like,

3444
02:39:47,250 --> 02:39:50,840
it lowers all these hormones and things 
that are known to promote cancer growth.

3445
02:39:50,870 --> 02:39:53,690
It's really a powerful thing and 
improves metabolism,

3446
02:39:53,930 --> 02:39:56,700
really improves metabolism and that's 
something that um,

3447
02:39:56,960 --> 02:40:01,960
a couple of scientists that I've talked 
to that are at UCFC are looking at and 

3448
02:40:01,960 --> 02:40:04,110
actively seeing that it just,
it seems to be really important.

3449
02:40:04,111 --> 02:40:07,640
And obviously people doing shift work,
like nurses are kind of.

3450
02:40:07,730 --> 02:40:12,730
I mean that's the problem.
The other kind of fucked when you're 

3451
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:12,730
doing that late shift stuff and they are
there.

3452
02:40:12,730 --> 02:40:14,020
They have twice the cancer incidents 
like

3453
02:40:14,270 --> 02:40:15,360
yeah,
twice,

3454
02:40:15,390 --> 02:40:19,110
twice shift workers.
They're also much more likely to be type

3455
02:40:19,111 --> 02:40:20,260
two diabetic.
You know,

3456
02:40:20,261 --> 02:40:22,890
it's because you're eating,
you're eating.

3457
02:40:23,330 --> 02:40:25,500
Like when you're at night,
you're eating,

3458
02:40:25,501 --> 02:40:27,660
you know,
your metabolism is all screwed up.

3459
02:40:27,900 --> 02:40:32,900
Not only are you like when you're eating
after the 12 hour clock are you not as 

3460
02:40:32,900 --> 02:40:36,420
insulin sensitive and so your blood 
glucose levels are higher also.

3461
02:40:36,750 --> 02:40:39,300
You're confusing your clock.
So it Kinda like it says,

3462
02:40:39,301 --> 02:40:41,430
okay,
I'm restarting now because it's late.

3463
02:40:41,460 --> 02:40:45,260
I'm getting my first signal in its after
it's been after 12 hours.

3464
02:40:45,261 --> 02:40:47,350
And it confused it,
so then when you go to sleep,

3465
02:40:47,351 --> 02:40:52,351
say you eat at two in the morning and go
to sleep and you wake up the next 

3466
02:40:52,351 --> 02:40:55,700
morning and you have your meal,
it's already going to have started that 

3467
02:40:55,700 --> 02:40:58,521
clock a while ago,
so you won't be as insulin sensitive 

3468
02:40:58,521 --> 02:41:01,790
because the earlier in the day you're 
the more the more insulin sensitive you 

3469
02:41:01,790 --> 02:41:01,790
are.

3470
02:41:01,790 --> 02:41:05,300
So you know what I mean?
So you kind of like confused in the 

3471
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:05,300
clock.
It's like this.

3472
02:41:05,300 --> 02:41:09,640
I'm a very complicated but I think 
important mechanism and system for 

3473
02:41:10,381 --> 02:41:13,470
people to understand and time restricted
time restricted eating,

3474
02:41:14,100 --> 02:41:19,100
like I have really implemented that 
because I think that's something that 

3475
02:41:19,100 --> 02:41:22,190
also will affect the aging process.
I've talked to people like at 

3476
02:41:22,190 --> 02:41:26,451
conferences I've given a talk at that 
have come up to me afterwards and there 

3477
02:41:26,451 --> 02:41:30,340
they were talking about how they've been
on a ketogenic diet for two years and 

3478
02:41:30,340 --> 02:41:30,660
how it would reverse your type two 
diabetes.

3479
02:41:30,661 --> 02:41:35,661
It's been great,
but still their fasting blood glucose 

3480
02:41:35,661 --> 02:41:37,410
levels were still in the high end,
you know,

3481
02:41:37,500 --> 02:41:39,450
even though they're no longer a type two
diabetic,

3482
02:41:39,590 --> 02:41:44,590
which is really good.
And they started doing the time 

3483
02:41:44,590 --> 02:41:47,181
restricted eating or they're eating 
within a nine hour window and it 

3484
02:41:47,181 --> 02:41:47,181
completely resolved.

3485
02:41:47,181 --> 02:41:50,900
It,
completely resolved it and it actually 

3486
02:41:50,900 --> 02:41:53,130
had multiple people tell me that.
And so the amazing thing is the increase

3487
02:41:53,131 --> 02:41:56,010
in muscle,
the muscle is really the increase,

3488
02:41:56,050 --> 02:41:57,870
the,
the interesting part.

3489
02:41:58,170 --> 02:42:03,170
I would like to like talk to such and 
more about that and have him do more 

3490
02:42:03,170 --> 02:42:03,230
experiments of possible,
uh,

3491
02:42:03,360 --> 02:42:07,080
because we didn't dive as much into that
on the podcast and we chatted,

3492
02:42:07,081 --> 02:42:09,840
but he is such a phenomenal scientist 
and he's very,

3493
02:42:10,090 --> 02:42:13,320
uh,
proactive and into health and all this,

3494
02:42:13,321 --> 02:42:18,321
you know,
preventative medicine and he's just a 

3495
02:42:18,321 --> 02:42:19,230
great,
great person at the salk institute in La

3496
02:42:19,230 --> 02:42:21,000
Jolla.
Very prestigious place to be.

3497
02:42:21,020 --> 02:42:22,730
It's a lot of really good scientists 
there.

3498
02:42:22,810 --> 02:42:27,810
Jude,
do your podcast with him through skype 

3499
02:42:27,810 --> 02:42:27,810
or did you know?
I met with him there.

3500
02:42:27,810 --> 02:42:28,830
Yeah,
yeah,

3501
02:42:29,190 --> 02:42:30,570
yeah.
I usually try to,

3502
02:42:30,571 --> 02:42:32,790
um,
I like to meet with people when I,

3503
02:42:32,820 --> 02:42:34,420
when I interviewed them,
so,

3504
02:42:34,570 --> 02:42:35,110
so I,
uh,

3505
02:42:35,730 --> 02:42:39,210
I've noticed so I can't have done skype 
ones and they're just,

3506
02:42:39,360 --> 02:42:42,270
it's like there's a disconnect.
There's something missing.

3507
02:42:42,800 --> 02:42:44,550
Yes.
It was nice for you is you actually have

3508
02:42:44,551 --> 02:42:47,830
a studio and people come to your studio.
So right now I'm,

3509
02:42:47,980 --> 02:42:50,510
I'm like going around to institutes and 
what,

3510
02:42:50,550 --> 02:42:55,550
you know,
if I'm at a place where I'm giving a 

3511
02:42:55,550 --> 02:42:55,550
talk and I'm like this great scientist 
there,

3512
02:42:55,550 --> 02:42:56,040
I'm going to ask people to,
to intervene.

3513
02:42:56,050 --> 02:43:01,050
How do you suppose name s a t a c h I n 
Satchin Panda.

3514
02:43:04,050 --> 02:43:09,050
He is a great name.
Actually his first name is such and to 

3515
02:43:09,050 --> 02:43:09,180
Nanda,
that's his,

3516
02:43:09,181 --> 02:43:11,920
because he's Indian,
so we shortened to Satchin

3517
02:43:12,400 --> 02:43:16,210
but he's um,
he's a really good person to talk to you

3518
02:43:16,211 --> 02:43:18,520
too.
Like he is very uh,

3519
02:43:18,760 --> 02:43:19,450
you know,
just,

3520
02:43:19,451 --> 02:43:21,820
he speaks eloquently.
He explained things well.

3521
02:43:21,821 --> 02:43:23,920
He's a little bit of an Indian accent,
but you know,

3522
02:43:23,921 --> 02:43:25,690
it's just,
it's kind of like cute,

3523
02:43:27,460 --> 02:43:29,830
but his science has changed my life.
Like,

3524
02:43:29,950 --> 02:43:32,650
Oh yeah,
all my circadian knowledge.

3525
02:43:32,651 --> 02:43:33,000
I've,
I've,

3526
02:43:33,060 --> 02:43:38,060
I've been following him for a few years.
I've really looked up to him for if in 

3527
02:43:38,060 --> 02:43:38,230
fact I don't even know if I told them 
this,

3528
02:43:38,231 --> 02:43:40,300
but I was interested in doing a post doc
with him.

3529
02:43:40,730 --> 02:43:43,060
Certain point,
like after I'd finished my phd because I

3530
02:43:43,061 --> 02:43:48,061
thought his,
he was back back in 2012 when I 

3531
02:43:48,061 --> 02:43:50,851
graduated.
He was making these discoveries about 

3532
02:43:50,851 --> 02:43:51,370
late night eating and how it like,
how it makes you,

3533
02:43:51,371 --> 02:43:52,040
um,
you know,

3534
02:43:52,090 --> 02:43:57,040
more so you basically more insulin 
resistant,

3535
02:43:57,041 --> 02:44:02,041
how it's like screwing up brain function
to all these things that I didn't even 

3536
02:44:02,041 --> 02:44:02,041
talk about and start.

3537
02:44:02,041 --> 02:44:06,780
I got really interested in it because I 
know a lot of people that eat late at 

3538
02:44:06,780 --> 02:44:08,320
night and people that are having trouble
losing weight and all that,

3539
02:44:08,321 --> 02:44:09,520
they're eating late at night,
so.

3540
02:44:09,640 --> 02:44:11,020
Wow,
that's amazing.

3541
02:44:11,030 --> 02:44:13,810
I'm going to listen to his podcast with 
you and,

3542
02:44:14,040 --> 02:44:15,480
or your podcasts with.
Yeah,

3543
02:44:15,880 --> 02:44:17,080
check that out.
That's a,

3544
02:44:17,140 --> 02:44:18,820
that sounds awesome.
That'd be cool.

3545
02:44:19,830 --> 02:44:22,720
So the saturated fat sugars,
what you wanted to narrow that down?

3546
02:44:22,970 --> 02:44:27,970
I did,
because you actually sent me an article 

3547
02:44:27,970 --> 02:44:30,451
about that,
which I found was really fascinating 

3548
02:44:30,451 --> 02:44:31,270
there.
Although saturated fat is important,

3549
02:44:31,271 --> 02:44:34,300
it's how would you describe it as a 
precursor to hormones?

3550
02:44:34,380 --> 02:44:37,300
It's,
it's not just a precursor to hormones,

3551
02:44:37,330 --> 02:44:39,130
so saturated fat,
saturated fat,

3552
02:44:39,550 --> 02:44:44,550
increases ldl cholesterol,
ldl lipoproteins,

3553
02:44:45,650 --> 02:44:47,670
proteins which carry cholesterol and 
fatty acids.

3554
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:50,140
We always call it cholesterol.
It's a type of it.

3555
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:55,500
It's a transporter of cholesterol,
but it also transports fatty acids and 

3556
02:44:55,500 --> 02:44:55,500
other things.

3557
02:44:55,500 --> 02:44:57,380
But the thing is is,
you know,

3558
02:44:57,490 --> 02:45:01,120
the Ldl is very,
very important because,

3559
02:45:01,500 --> 02:45:06,500
um,
every time you make a new cell in your 

3560
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:06,500
body,
which is happening constantly,

3561
02:45:06,500 --> 02:45:07,570
you're always making new immune cells 
are making new kidney cells.

3562
02:45:07,571 --> 02:45:09,190
You're making new liver cells.
I mean,

3563
02:45:09,880 --> 02:45:12,370
it's happening all the time.
Anytime you make a new cell,

3564
02:45:12,371 --> 02:45:17,371
you need ldl there to transport 
cholesterol and fatty acids because cell

3565
02:45:18,041 --> 02:45:19,510
membrane,
the cell itself,

3566
02:45:19,720 --> 02:45:24,720
the membrane is made of it.
It has fatty acids and cholesterol and 

3567
02:45:24,720 --> 02:45:25,870
phospholipids and other things.
But so you need that cholesterol.

3568
02:45:26,020 --> 02:45:28,060
When you damage the cell,
you know,

3569
02:45:28,061 --> 02:45:30,760
and you're repairing that damage.
Cholesterol needs to be there.

3570
02:45:31,060 --> 02:45:31,660
So,
I mean,

3571
02:45:32,320 --> 02:45:33,940
you really,
really need cholesterol.

3572
02:45:33,941 --> 02:45:35,920
LDL cholesterol is very important for 
that,

3573
02:45:35,980 --> 02:45:38,800
for that reason,
and without it you're kind of screwed,

3574
02:45:39,430 --> 02:45:44,430
right?
I mean you can't like repair damaged as 

3575
02:45:44,430 --> 02:45:46,591
well.
You're not going to make as many new 

3576
02:45:46,591 --> 02:45:47,881
cells.
So all these people that are avoiding 

3577
02:45:47,881 --> 02:45:48,280
saturated fat and cholesterol in their 
diet,

3578
02:45:48,340 --> 02:45:53,340
they're doing the literal doing 
literally doing their cell regeneration 

3579
02:45:53,810 --> 02:45:55,330
the disservice.
Well,

3580
02:45:55,331 --> 02:46:00,331
I don't want to make that broad state 
because I don't know what else they're 

3581
02:46:00,331 --> 02:46:02,950
either,
maybe they're getting other types of 

3582
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:02,950
fatty acids that also helped.
But yes,

3583
02:46:02,950 --> 02:46:04,030
people that are like on stands for 
example,

3584
02:46:04,390 --> 02:46:09,390
which is a very broad way of inhibiting 
like cholesterol synthesis

3585
02:46:11,060 --> 02:46:13,040
brought like fullstop.
Um,

3586
02:46:13,130 --> 02:46:16,850
that's why a lot of those people on 
statens I'm one of the major,

3587
02:46:16,851 --> 02:46:19,790
major side effects is muscle atrophy and
muscle wasting.

3588
02:46:20,080 --> 02:46:21,220
You know,
because your muscles,

3589
02:46:21,230 --> 02:46:26,230
one of those cells,
you're constantly repairing damage and 

3590
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:26,230
making the muscle.
And it's a big,

3591
02:46:26,230 --> 02:46:28,790
big problem.
Huge problem with Staton staton users.

3592
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:31,310
It also.
So a colleague of mine,

3593
02:46:31,830 --> 02:46:36,830
Ron Kraus,
he's at a children's hospital in 

3594
02:46:36,830 --> 02:46:40,061
Oakland.
He has been studying status and their 

3595
02:46:40,061 --> 02:46:42,731
effect on Mitochondria and he was 
telling me that it's like toxic to 

3596
02:46:42,731 --> 02:46:45,600
mitochondria and he's trying to figure 
out why is.

3597
02:46:45,630 --> 02:46:48,050
It's like,
maybe that's partly why it's.

3598
02:46:48,051 --> 02:46:51,410
I'm also causing muscle wasting.

3599
02:46:51,790 --> 02:46:56,790
So if people don't consume saturated 
fats or they lower their radically lower

3600
02:46:57,461 --> 02:47:02,461
the saturated fat in their diet,
how does their body produced new cell 

3601
02:47:02,461 --> 02:47:02,500
membranes?

3602
02:47:03,060 --> 02:47:03,600
Well,
I mean,

3603
02:47:03,601 --> 02:47:04,470
you still,
you're,

3604
02:47:04,471 --> 02:47:09,030
you're making cholesterol in your body 
and you're making it from there.

3605
02:47:09,031 --> 02:47:12,090
Getting fatty acids.
They're getting it from plants.

3606
02:47:12,120 --> 02:47:13,890
I mean plant sterols,
they're getting them from,

3607
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:15,630
from other sources,
you know,

3608
02:47:15,631 --> 02:47:20,280
but I think the problem with the,
with the saturated fat was,

3609
02:47:20,360 --> 02:47:24,450
it's not so much that because people 
still get it to some degree.

3610
02:47:24,451 --> 02:47:26,280
I mean it's like,
but it's not an optimal.

3611
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:28,050
Yeah.
I mean,

3612
02:47:28,110 --> 02:47:29,750
I don't know.
I can't attack.

3613
02:47:29,850 --> 02:47:33,060
I'd have to see like the person.
I think it varies depending on what else

3614
02:47:33,061 --> 02:47:34,370
they're eating.
But you know,

3615
02:47:34,380 --> 02:47:39,380
the Pr,
I think the problem was that saturated 

3616
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:39,380
fat was demonized.

3617
02:47:39,380 --> 02:47:40,800
Well,
it was demonized in a very corrupt way,

3618
02:47:40,920 --> 02:47:42,080
which is the,
the,

3619
02:47:42,090 --> 02:47:44,580
the recent New York Times article that 
was released,

3620
02:47:44,581 --> 02:47:49,581
which was a mindblower,
which detailed how the sugar industry 

3621
02:47:49,590 --> 02:47:54,590
had bribed scientists to release data 
blaming saturated fat for heart disease 

3622
02:47:56,641 --> 02:48:01,641
and obesity and all these issues when it
was in fact sugar that was causing all 

3623
02:48:01,641 --> 02:48:05,361
that.
So they were literally rigging the 

3624
02:48:05,361 --> 02:48:08,061
system and paying scientists and it was 
a horrible article because that 

3625
02:48:08,061 --> 02:48:10,830
propaganda and these lies that they 
spread,

3626
02:48:10,831 --> 02:48:12,720
I believe it was in the fifties,
here it is,

3627
02:48:12,721 --> 02:48:17,721
how the sugar industry shifted the blame
to fat and it's if you get a chance and 

3628
02:48:17,851 --> 02:48:21,210
you want to feel sick at what can be 
done with money,

3629
02:48:21,600 --> 02:48:24,870
watch or read that because it's just,
it's awful.

3630
02:48:24,950 --> 02:48:27,730
It is really awful.
And um,

3631
02:48:27,900 --> 02:48:32,900
it was an internal sugar industry 
document that was discovered by a 

3632
02:48:32,900 --> 02:48:33,870
researcher at the University of 
California in San Francisco.

3633
02:48:33,871 --> 02:48:36,740
And it was published,
he said Monday when this was out,

3634
02:48:36,750 --> 02:48:40,290
I believe it was a couple of months ago,
but it was amazing.

3635
02:48:40,291 --> 02:48:45,291
It suggested that five decades of 
research into the role of nutrition in 

3636
02:48:45,291 --> 02:48:49,041
heart disease,
including many of today's dietary 

3637
02:48:49,041 --> 02:48:51,171
recommendations may have been largely 
shaped by the sugar industry and 

3638
02:48:51,171 --> 02:48:55,731
propaganda and money.
They spent money to literally bribe 

3639
02:48:55,731 --> 02:48:57,540
scientists to release false data.

3640
02:48:58,540 --> 02:49:00,700
It's horrible,
really nasty,

3641
02:49:00,790 --> 02:49:03,040
but I mean the thing is not that much 
money either there.

3642
02:49:03,041 --> 02:49:03,250
Here's

3643
02:49:03,250 --> 02:49:04,190
a goal.
Go back to it.

3644
02:49:04,700 --> 02:49:09,700
Here.
They paid three Harvard scientists 

3645
02:49:09,700 --> 02:49:12,270
equivalent of $50,000
in today's dollars to publish in 1967.

3646
02:49:12,271 --> 02:49:15,090
Review of research on sugar,
fat and heart disease.

3647
02:49:15,140 --> 02:49:19,140
Studies using the review were handpicked
by the Sugar Group and the article which

3648
02:49:19,141 --> 02:49:20,680
was published in the prestigious New 
Jersey.

3649
02:49:20,700 --> 02:49:25,700
New England Journal of medicine minimize
the link between sugar and heart health 

3650
02:49:25,700 --> 02:49:29,510
and cast aspirations on the role of 
saturated fat even though the influence 

3651
02:49:29,510 --> 02:49:31,620
peddling revealed and documents dates 
back to nearly 50 years.

3652
02:49:32,070 --> 02:49:37,070
More recent reports show that the food 
industry has continued to influence 

3653
02:49:37,070 --> 02:49:37,070
nutrition science.

3654
02:49:37,860 --> 02:49:42,860
This had such a negative like con.
There was such negative consequences 

3655
02:49:45,121 --> 02:49:47,490
from this,
from from the demonization and saturated

3656
02:49:47,491 --> 02:49:52,080
fat because people then obviously 
started eating more refined,

3657
02:49:52,140 --> 02:49:54,630
like for breakfast in the morning 
instead of having eggs,

3658
02:49:54,900 --> 02:49:59,900
you're having like cereal,
but the real problem was the trans fats 

3659
02:49:59,900 --> 02:50:01,890
because trans fats can,
can have similar,

3660
02:50:01,891 --> 02:50:03,960
but their hydrogenated hydrogenated 
fats,

3661
02:50:03,961 --> 02:50:05,450
which you know,
you take like a,

3662
02:50:05,950 --> 02:50:08,910
a mono saturated fat and hydrated and 
you can have similar properties,

3663
02:50:08,940 --> 02:50:10,890
properties as a saturated fat like 
butter,

3664
02:50:10,980 --> 02:50:14,730
how it's solid and then melts at a 
higher temperature.

3665
02:50:15,240 --> 02:50:20,240
But these trans fats,
I mean I remember my mom had a big tub 

3666
02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:24,231
of margarine.
I mean we used to put margin on our 

3667
02:50:24,231 --> 02:50:26,490
mashed potatoes and everybody thought it
was healthy and it was so.

3668
02:50:26,790 --> 02:50:28,560
I mean,
it's not just unhealthy.

3669
02:50:28,561 --> 02:50:30,570
I mean it was literally,
that's what's called,

3670
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:32,850
it causes heart disease because the 
trans fats,

3671
02:50:32,851 --> 02:50:37,851
like I said,
you take these fats up into your new 

3672
02:50:37,851 --> 02:50:37,851
cells,
right?

3673
02:50:37,851 --> 02:50:37,851
Because that's part of what,
you know,

3674
02:50:37,851 --> 02:50:42,200
fatty acids and cholesterol,
that's part of what you're doing with 

3675
02:50:42,200 --> 02:50:44,211
them in your body.
The transplants get taken up and the 

3676
02:50:44,211 --> 02:50:46,551
whole structure of it's screwed up.
So when this happens in the endothelial 

3677
02:50:46,551 --> 02:50:47,790
cells lining your blood vessels,
it makes them real stiff,

3678
02:50:47,880 --> 02:50:51,270
real stiff and like,
I mean it's just like screws it up.

3679
02:50:51,480 --> 02:50:54,310
So trans fats are like,
we have known about the,

3680
02:50:54,350 --> 02:50:59,350
like the fact that trans fats are 
playing a causal role in heart disease 

3681
02:50:59,350 --> 02:51:03,351
for decades and the FDA finally in 2015,
2015,

3682
02:51:03,571 --> 02:51:08,571
okay.
Finally banned them from the u s and 

3683
02:51:08,571 --> 02:51:11,601
gave all the companies that are still 
putting them in their process foods and 

3684
02:51:11,601 --> 02:51:15,440
a lot of fast foods companies use crisco
because it's cheaper three years to get 

3685
02:51:15,440 --> 02:51:17,970
it off the market.
So we have until 2018 Jesus Christ,

3686
02:51:17,971 --> 02:51:19,500
three years to get rid of poison.

3687
02:51:19,500 --> 02:51:22,350
And that's after already like decades of
knowing.

3688
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:25,050
It's like,
you know that this is like,

3689
02:51:25,170 --> 02:51:27,030
it's like so bad,
so,

3690
02:51:27,031 --> 02:51:30,260
so bad for you.
Anyways,

3691
02:51:30,261 --> 02:51:31,290
that's a,
that's a whole.

3692
02:51:31,470 --> 02:51:36,470
That's one of the major repercussions.
And then obviously then people became 

3693
02:51:36,470 --> 02:51:38,220
scared of saturated fat.
And the thing,

3694
02:51:38,250 --> 02:51:43,250
the thing with the sugar,
and this is kind of what you were 

3695
02:51:43,250 --> 02:51:44,630
initially hinting at,
is that a lot of there,

3696
02:51:44,670 --> 02:51:47,100
there have been a lot of studies that 
have linked,

3697
02:51:47,410 --> 02:51:49,420
you know,
that weren't corrupt by the shirt,

3698
02:51:49,430 --> 02:51:54,430
like these were the early study,
but there have been studies that have 

3699
02:51:54,430 --> 02:51:54,430
linked saturated fat and take to heart 
disease and,

3700
02:51:54,430 --> 02:51:58,470
and a lot of those studies were also 
because people were eating,

3701
02:51:58,620 --> 02:52:03,620
in addition to saturated fat,
they didn't correct for like refined 

3702
02:52:03,620 --> 02:52:04,440
sugar intake,
which is really what the problem is.

3703
02:52:04,441 --> 02:52:06,730
And that has now shown in multiple 
studies.

3704
02:52:06,730 --> 02:52:11,730
So you know,
and this came down to actually being 

3705
02:52:11,730 --> 02:52:12,700
able to have new technology available 
that was able to then,

3706
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:14,490
you know,
ldl is not,

3707
02:52:14,560 --> 02:52:19,560
there's not just one ldl cholesterol in 
the body comes in all sizes and types.

3708
02:52:19,990 --> 02:52:22,720
The type that we're talking about,
the good type is the large,

3709
02:52:22,721 --> 02:52:25,030
buoyant type.
And that's what saturated fat increases.

3710
02:52:25,450 --> 02:52:30,450
There's also,
it gets processed into smaller parts 

3711
02:52:30,450 --> 02:52:33,421
that are small,
dense ldl and that's what gets 

3712
02:52:33,421 --> 02:52:34,120
basically,
it can't get recycled back to the liver.

3713
02:52:34,121 --> 02:52:39,121
So it stays around the bloodstream and 
undergoes inflammatory transformations 

3714
02:52:39,121 --> 02:52:39,790
and sticks in the blood vessels.
It causes all this problem,

3715
02:52:39,791 --> 02:52:42,220
right?
That's what refined sugar increases.

3716
02:52:42,221 --> 02:52:43,780
And that's been shown in clinical 
studies.

3717
02:52:44,020 --> 02:52:49,020
So like healthy young men that were 
given 20 ounces of soda a day for three 

3718
02:52:49,020 --> 02:52:53,371
weeks.
It totally healthy young young men 

3719
02:52:53,371 --> 02:52:53,410
increase this,
increased their ldl,

3720
02:52:53,770 --> 02:52:58,770
small dense ldl particles like massively
increased small dense ldl particles and 

3721
02:52:58,770 --> 02:53:00,160
also increase their inflammatory 
markers.

3722
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:02,980
C reactive protein,
but like almost 100 percent,

3723
02:53:03,400 --> 02:53:07,900
which is like crazy.
So we're talking about like,

3724
02:53:08,100 --> 02:53:13,100
you know,
the refined sugar is what can make 

3725
02:53:13,100 --> 02:53:16,141
saturated fat dangerous is when you 
combine the two because the ldl gets 

3726
02:53:16,141 --> 02:53:18,040
processed into the small dense and it's 
refined sugar that does that.

3727
02:53:18,570 --> 02:53:21,430
So,
so small dense ldl versus ldl.

3728
02:53:21,460 --> 02:53:26,460
Yeah.
And so the thing is is that even now 

3729
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:27,160
it's not standard of care at a lag.
Measure all the particles sizes.

3730
02:53:27,161 --> 02:53:30,490
It's like we've known about this for at 
least a decade now.

3731
02:53:30,840 --> 02:53:32,650
Like so Ron Kraus,
he is,

3732
02:53:32,651 --> 02:53:34,720
um,
he's the guy who actually pioneered this

3733
02:53:34,721 --> 02:53:36,850
assay and figured out how to measure 
them.

3734
02:53:36,880 --> 02:53:37,870
The small,
dense ldl.

3735
02:53:37,871 --> 02:53:42,280
It's called the ion mobility as say a,
it's in a quest labs does it,

3736
02:53:42,281 --> 02:53:47,281
but you can also ask your physician,
you can ask your physician to measure 

3737
02:53:47,281 --> 02:53:47,281
the particle size.
Um,

3738
02:53:47,281 --> 02:53:52,110
but the thing is,
is that because it's not something 

3739
02:53:52,110 --> 02:53:54,721
that's standard of care,
when you go in to measure ldl 

3740
02:53:54,721 --> 02:53:54,760
cholesterol and it's above a certain 
number,

3741
02:53:55,090 --> 02:53:56,740
physicians are like freaking out and 
they're like,

3742
02:53:56,741 --> 02:53:57,460
you should get on Stanton's.

3743
02:53:57,460 --> 02:54:00,580
But the reality is that you need to look
at the small dense ldl.

3744
02:54:00,610 --> 02:54:05,610
That's what's actually puts you at risk 
for heart disease and that's just not 

3745
02:54:05,610 --> 02:54:07,390
standard of care that you have to like 
specifically ask for it,

3746
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:12,780
you know,
and so crazy that there's such a vast 

3747
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:12,780
difference in the consequences for your 
health.

3748
02:54:12,780 --> 02:54:15,010
But yet it's not tested even though the 
knowledge is there.

3749
02:54:15,340 --> 02:54:20,340
Well,
that's what I was saying with the Trans 

3750
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:20,340
Fat.
I mean the knowledge was there.

3751
02:54:20,340 --> 02:54:23,310
Like I was talking to my,
like 88 year old mentor Bruce Ames and 

3752
02:54:23,310 --> 02:54:24,730
he was like,
I remember back in the eighties though,

3753
02:54:24,731 --> 02:54:26,500
we stayed away from that and never gave 
margin.

3754
02:54:26,501 --> 02:54:27,430
And my children,
I'm like,

3755
02:54:27,431 --> 02:54:29,380
well you're a scientist.
Like my mom wasn't,

3756
02:54:29,381 --> 02:54:32,140
you know,
like he's known about this for like when

3757
02:54:32,141 --> 02:54:33,910
I was like,
like five,

3758
02:54:34,030 --> 02:54:39,030
you know,
he's known for 30 fucking years and now 

3759
02:54:39,030 --> 02:54:39,880
2015 is when,
you know,

3760
02:54:39,970 --> 02:54:43,060
there's always a lag between research 
and the application of it.

3761
02:54:43,061 --> 02:54:45,890
But I mean,
I don't know how much of A.

3762
02:54:46,210 --> 02:54:47,710
I don't know what it takes to,
you know,

3763
02:54:47,711 --> 02:54:52,711
maybe these regulatory committees May.
There's probably a lot more than I know 

3764
02:54:52,711 --> 02:54:54,410
that goes into like figuring out like 
how you make these regulations.

3765
02:54:54,490 --> 02:54:57,880
It's only financially motivated.
That's what's disgusting about it.

3766
02:54:57,881 --> 02:55:00,940
They're given these companies three 
years to get poison out of food.

3767
02:55:01,030 --> 02:55:03,410
That is what really upsets me.
I'm like,

3768
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:04,310
okay,

3769
02:55:04,310 --> 02:55:07,050
you finally finally have banded in the 
US,

3770
02:55:07,070 --> 02:55:12,070
but you're given three years,
like three years for people to profit 

3771
02:55:12,070 --> 02:55:15,041
off of poisoning for killing.
People don't realize you should have a 

3772
02:55:15,041 --> 02:55:19,481
fucking cancer recommendation or a 
warning the same way you have on 

3773
02:55:19,481 --> 02:55:20,120
cigarettes.
And it's not even like you can go.

3774
02:55:20,121 --> 02:55:24,290
Like people go to the supermarket and 
you'll say no trans fats on their food.

3775
02:55:24,291 --> 02:55:26,420
And all that,
but when they go to fast food or they go

3776
02:55:26,421 --> 02:55:28,400
to some restaurant where they're using 
Chris crisco's,

3777
02:55:28,430 --> 02:55:30,330
they're not even going to know they're 
getting it.

3778
02:55:30,331 --> 02:55:35,150
And I'm telling you this was awesome.
Oh man,

3779
02:55:35,360 --> 02:55:36,950
totally.
God Damn on the budget.

3780
02:55:36,951 --> 02:55:39,290
This was great.
You blow my mind every time.

3781
02:55:39,291 --> 02:55:42,110
This is amazing.
There's a lot to study folks,

3782
02:55:42,111 --> 02:55:47,111
so go over this podcast 30 or 40 times 
and I know I'm going to go over it.

3783
02:55:47,161 --> 02:55:51,360
A few found my fitness on twitter.
What your,

3784
02:55:51,410 --> 02:55:54,290
your podcast found my fitness.
I have a podcast.

3785
02:55:54,291 --> 02:55:58,790
It's called found my fitness and 
actually I just released a podcast today

3786
02:55:59,180 --> 02:56:04,180
with Dr Roland Griffiths,
who is the notorious Psychedelic 

3787
02:56:04,180 --> 02:56:08,561
psilocybin researcher.
I met with him when I was at Johns 

3788
02:56:08,561 --> 02:56:10,220
Hopkins outside of my realm,
but you should listen to it.

3789
02:56:10,280 --> 02:56:15,280
It's interesting.
I will definitely do that and let's do 

3790
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:15,280
it again soon.
It's been too long.

3791
02:56:15,280 --> 02:56:15,980
So much fun.
Thank you so much.

3792
02:56:15,981 --> 02:56:16,850
Thanks for.
I appreciate it.

3793
02:56:16,851 --> 02:56:17,870
All right folks.
We'll see you.

3794
02:56:17,930 --> 02:56:18,380
Bye.

3795
02:56:21,450 --> 02:56:26,450
The.

3796
02:56:37,620 --> 02:56:38,250
Yeah?
Yes.
