1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
Or live that always sounds so fake,
so it was hard to get these things

2
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:07,920
started,
so he's hard to just just start talking.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,330
Not Hard,
but I'm learning from you that the way

4
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:17,220
you define things in your own mind.
A language.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,200
Yeah.
Language they use.

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,630
Yeah.
The way you define things can oftentimes

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:25,350
shape exactly how those things manifest
themselves in real life.

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:25,800
Right?
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,830
You say more about yourself and what you
actually know.

10
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,540
Not Swear.
Mind coaching comes in.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,720
You say more about yourself.
You give away a law.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,950
He did.
He went.

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,920
Sometimes it doesn't make sense.
The talking about something and they

14
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,500
saying that they're really positive
about something and then you think,

15
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:44,210
well that doesn't match up.
So it's a bit like I'm a barking peg.

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,460
Pigs don't bog.
It just makes sense.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,010
That's how I defined it anyway.
A barking when I had to throw through

18
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,900
the filter more fuckers.

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,570
You're talking about cheap mushroom
days,

20
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,190
I'm afraid.
Yeah,

21
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,680
it's a,
there's a very interesting thing we just

22
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:03,870
did,
we just did something called timeline

23
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,360
therapy that you,
uh,

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,200
were telling me about.
The Joe Schilling told me about Ian

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,460
Mccall.
Got really interested in it,

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,740
um,
and what you would use if for folks

27
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:20,010
who've never heard of any before,
but he's been on the podcast before

28
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:22,410
Vinnie's,
a mental coach and a hypnotist,

29
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,670
and before our first session,
the last time you came on the podcast,

30
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:27,121
I was like,
well,

31
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,830
I don't know about all this hypnosis
stuff.

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,620
Maybe just a bunch of fucking crazy
people and people talk to them and I

33
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,370
mean,
you for sure have seen those

34
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,760
televangelists that put their hands on
people and they'd go into spasms and

35
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,040
they fall down on the floor and they
claim to be curative.

36
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,860
Illnesses.
Hysteria,

37
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:47,900
isn't it?
What is that makes the Hallux politics

38
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:49,463
bullshit?

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,590
Or is it something going on with some of
those?

40
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,000
Pinkus is a hypnotic state.
It doesn't mean that it's,

41
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,830
it's a positive one,
but as a hypnotic state,

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,820
they get this.
Anyone that does that,

43
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,240
I've been on a couple of podcasts now,
went on the two with a cold,

44
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,710
the dash radio story time with uncle
creepy.

45
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,690
And the first thing of that interview is
set.

46
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,990
Obviously a huge tip.
No,

47
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,863
he.
So looking at,

48
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,380
you know,
I can't be hypnotized,

49
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,750
we'll find out.
So.

50
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,571
Right.
You know what I mean?

51
00:02:15,571 --> 00:02:18,750
People love to say that though I can't
be hypnotized,

52
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:20,100
bro.
Come get me Bro.

53
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,020
I don't care.
Fine.

54
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,220
I mean,
I think we may have discussed this the

55
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,250
last time,
but we may not have.

56
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:29,470
I think stand up comedy is hypnosis.
They.

57
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,570
So you know what everything is.
These algae,

58
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,590
you're not in a hypnotic state listening
to you,

59
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,240
Nazi state,
not listened to.

60
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,140
Music,
TV,

61
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,400
having a bath,
shower,

62
00:02:38,401 --> 00:02:39,234
rituals,
whatever.

63
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:42,990
So do you think that the term hypnotic
is problematic because people think that

64
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:46,680
it takes away control from you and it
puts you into this Netherworld or

65
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:48,500
something like that.
Can Do.

66
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,340
But I'll hypnosis itself.
Hypnosis.

67
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:54,120
So you do it yourself.
I'm only a potion of inflammation as my

68
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:58,560
first teacher said Keith Mayer and it
went to Liverpool football club.

69
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,510
Great Guy.
Uh,

70
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,160
he said that

71
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,940
we're only post one of information.
So we just guide the way and show the

72
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,500
Pearson which way to go,
you know?

73
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,050
Yeah.
It for the ICT said last time,

74
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,160
I don't do for all.
Look at him and on,

75
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,660
you know,
like that.

76
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:14,500
I mean it's fine if you want to go with
show and you want to getting involved in

77
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,940
that and way,
great.

78
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,370
You won't have sex of the chair or
whatever.

79
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:20,590
That's okay for me.
Yeah,

80
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,310
I do.
I don't do it for you.

81
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,720
What do you do it for 'em?
I do because I liked people succeed and

82
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,750
I know it sounds cliche and very hippy,
but I love it.

83
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,600
I like people doing well.
I like,

84
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,940
I like he section as some sort of weird
noble side of me really.

85
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,340
I think when people conquer fear,
when people conquer something,

86
00:03:40,341 --> 00:03:41,650
nothing.
There's nothing bad in there.

87
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,610
Well,
I think one of the things that we talked

88
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:46,730
about when we were doing a timeline,
I was talking about some of my

89
00:03:46,731 --> 00:03:51,020
experiences when I was younger that have
kinda like clung to me unfortunately or

90
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:53,150
fortunately in and you know,
you were,

91
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,500
you were talking about your own and I
think that when you've had some bad

92
00:03:57,501 --> 00:04:02,210
experiences in your life and when you've
had some things in your mind that stand

93
00:04:02,211 --> 00:04:05,690
out as a very memorable moments and
points in your life,

94
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,730
those things can kind of,
they don't just define you,

95
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:13,460
but that also can set you up for the
future.

96
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,060
Like how you think about other people or
how you think about other things,

97
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,680
shapes your life completely and having
these bad moments and realizing what

98
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:25,580
they were and how they defined you now
gives you motivation to help other

99
00:04:25,581 --> 00:04:27,860
people get over their bad moments.

100
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,090
Yeah.
It's just with time line therapy,

101
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:33,470
which is devised by.
I'm Tad James and uh,

102
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,680
um,
a very,

103
00:04:34,681 --> 00:04:37,620
very successful guy at Saint James
Company.

104
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:40,020
My teacher work for them directly
calling MCI.

105
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,950
So I'm a direct descendant.
Really have that.

106
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,030
The technique is amazing.
I mean,

107
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:48,780
I love it and I said to you earlier,
I believe everyone in the world should

108
00:04:48,781 --> 00:04:50,340
do it and that's not a sales pitch by
the way.

109
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,110
That's just my opinion.
You know,

110
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,520
I just think it's fabulous.
You know,

111
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,690
people have things going on,
like let's say you've got an iphone six

112
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:00,960
or an iphone or whatever.
If you don't use the APPS,

113
00:05:00,961 --> 00:05:04,230
keep playing over and over again.
If that's still going on,

114
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,170
they are going to take some sort of toll
on you when you shut them down and

115
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,450
think,
well actually she'll sit down and you

116
00:05:09,451 --> 00:05:11,760
save your battery and memory and the
shapes your life.

117
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,420
You know what?
I've been saying that for awhile.

118
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,530
It turns out it doesn't.
Somebody just.

119
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,710
Some dude just tweeted me.
Yeah.

120
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:22,250
It's not like a computer where the
computer is constantly has these things

121
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:25,070
running in the background and it's using
up resources and battery power.

122
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:26,960
Apparently with phones it does not do
that.

123
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,490
Malacca d fragmentation.
You're on an old computer when you do

124
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,590
frog it that then instead that's my app
saying,

125
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:33,424
God,
I want it.

126
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,710
I did too.
I used to use that as an example,

127
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,170
but some,
some dude who actually knows what he's

128
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:41,500
talking about correcting me,
which is taking over Internet.

129
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,363
Oh,
we,

130
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,620
we cannot,
we must plow for it except our defeats

131
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,670
let's say now it's ruined.
Yeah.

132
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,260
Um,
but I think that,

133
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,370
you know,
your,

134
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,340
um,
your own personal experiences is one of

135
00:05:55,341 --> 00:05:57,890
the reasons why you've become a coach,
not a mind coach,

136
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:02,840
but a martial arts coach and that these
experiences of negative moments in your

137
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:06,120
life where you've overcome them and you
realize I can help someone else who is

138
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:07,830
in that sort of same situation.
Yeah,

139
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:08,664
of course.

140
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,190
It's just like he's just,
it's nice to just say it's a,

141
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:14,390
it's not that important.
You know,

142
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,610
people believe that these sometimes.
I mean the got,

143
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,320
there is problems that are massive,
you know,

144
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:20,270
I'm not gonna lie in some things I can't
solve.

145
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,050
I'm not Moses.
But um,

146
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,100
there is the risk things that,
you know,

147
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:29,750
if you can help somebody out and they
can get rid of it or change the way they

148
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,590
think.
I ego schilling money did sign my

149
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,400
therapy.
His relationship with his dad was miles

150
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,160
better before he passed away.
Isn't that pretty powerful?

151
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:39,100
Yeah.
Joe talked about it on the podcast.

152
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:43,150
He talked about it just completely
changed his whole perception of his

153
00:06:43,151 --> 00:06:46,840
relationship with his dad,
who his dad was in his life and he let

154
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:47,674
it all go.

155
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,510
Yeah.
I just helped him tremendously.

156
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,190
What more can you say that,
that really as a coach me and had said,

157
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,170
you know,
no,

158
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,360
they didn't get a fight with Justin
scoggins and that because of the weight,

159
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:02,020
whatever her name was saying that his
life has changed since doing timeline

160
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,570
therapy and doing the,
you know,

161
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,180
work with me not just timeline therapy
and not just hypnosis with my coach and

162
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:09,520
in general because it's multifaceted.
Rarely.

163
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,740
And um,
he said his lives changed.

164
00:07:11,741 --> 00:07:13,120
He,
he's a different person.

165
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:14,580
People have noticed,
you know,

166
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,810
so that's for me,
great news.

167
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:20,430
I think sometimes it just takes the
realization of what's been fucking with

168
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:24,960
you that once you realize what it is,
then you have it in your mind and then

169
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:28,530
you can kind of look at it for what it
really is instead of this thing that's

170
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:33,060
playing in the background that you can't
quite identify or you or you know it

171
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,280
exists,
but you ignore it and you just.

172
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:36,840
You don't.
You don't ever get over it.

173
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,720
Yeah.

174
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,240
He sees he's interested in either a
client the other week called joy.

175
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:46,241
She's 80 years of age and she was going
to a wedding in Spain for her grandson

176
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,600
and she was beside herself.
She was terrified,

177
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,471
you know,
and we did it.

178
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,160
Just a few things,
you know,

179
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:55,450
little things to make you consider
different ways of looking at the anxiety

180
00:07:55,451 --> 00:07:58,320
she was getting.
Anxiety is basically a massive with your

181
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:01,240
unconscious mind is to focus on what you
want because if you're in an anxious

182
00:08:01,241 --> 00:08:02,860
state,
you focus in on what you don't want,

183
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,450
right?
There's different levels of it.

184
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,300
Of course,
when she was focusing on what may go

185
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:09,460
wrong,
seller saying all this will go into a

186
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:12,100
wedding is a celebration of two People's
matrimony,

187
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,980
whatever,
and it's going to be nice and Dah,

188
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:14,201
Dah,
Dah,

189
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:15,190
Dah.
She wasn't focused on that.

190
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,480
We've spoken to something else.
I changed that and like she was happy

191
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:22,120
and she went to the wedding and so now
he's got,

192
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:23,180
I mean,
she's 80 years of age.

193
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:24,520
You may not be going to Lowe's a
wedding,

194
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,050
let's be honest.
But if,

195
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,000
for me,
the job itself,

196
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,930
what can you say about nice transforms
people,

197
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:32,911
you know,
and I,

198
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:33,600
I

199
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,640
adora no,
I know you do.

200
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,030
I really,
you really,

201
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,260
it comes out of you when you do it.
You really do love it.

202
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,430
Um,
it's,

203
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:45,120
uh,
it seems to me that human beings don't

204
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:49,320
really live long enough to figure out
what this is.

205
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,570
You know,
I think that is one of the major

206
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:54,030
problems that a lot of us have.
We have a certain amount of momentum

207
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:55,980
that comes from our childhood,
whether it's

208
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,330
good or bad.
And we followed that momentum into our

209
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,670
adulthood.
Sometimes trying to hit the break,

210
00:09:03,671 --> 00:09:08,670
sometimes trying to correct the course
and oftentimes using things like alcohol

211
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:13,671
or drugs or gambling or anything to
distract us from the pain of whatever,

212
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,980
the instability,
whatever,

213
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:18,330
whatever it is,
it's fucking with us.

214
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,150
And then you get to be a certain age.
You realize like,

215
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,210
I'm barely figuring this thing out and
I'm almost dead.

216
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,000
You know,
it's the last thing.

217
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:30,980
He's signing all the papers on the year
on pass know we should do.

218
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,570
Yeah,
you definitely don't want that.

219
00:09:33,571 --> 00:09:35,870
But you also,
you,

220
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,410
I think
there's a big thing that people always

221
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,150
talk about,
like living in the moment.

222
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,060
It is a very,
it's a very difficult thing to do for

223
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,280
some strange reason.
Yeah.

224
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,840
Because you know,
you worried about Somara yeah.

225
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,520
Like worried about light around or
you're worried about yesterday,

226
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,500
yesterday.

227
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,570
Worried about last year.
That's why it Easter.

228
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,700
I'm,
I'm not gonna pretend to walk in a

229
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,560
cloud,
you know,

230
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,430
and,
and trying to come in with all these

231
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:06,140
long statements and write these things.
You know,

232
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,860
it's no one does,
but that's towson.

233
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,820
But that's a problem with religion,
right?

234
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,970
With religion.
To do that,

235
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,130
one of the bigger issues is that the
people that are sort of proselytizing or

236
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:21,150
the people that are promoting it there
in some ways,

237
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,670
many of them,
especially priests and things along

238
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,320
those lines,
which is why it's so disappointing when

239
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:27,030
you hear about child sex abuse,
monks,

240
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,970
priests,
they're pretending to be something holy

241
00:10:29,971 --> 00:10:34,140
and special and above you,
which is why they can bestow this

242
00:10:34,141 --> 00:10:37,640
knowledge upon you while they can.
They're talking directly from God

243
00:10:37,641 --> 00:10:39,930
wouldn't know.
Were all peasants in this weird

244
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,270
exchange.
Yeah.

245
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,550
No,
not conduit.

246
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,810
So are they,
you know,

247
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,730
and I think,
I think good get delusions have gotten.

248
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:49,110
I think a lot of people do.
You know,

249
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:52,740
and I've met,
I've met you and I'm a fan of yours and

250
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,080
they really enjoyed it.
I think I,

251
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:57,210
like I said before,
you never had Wim Hoff who I love

252
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,830
Russell Brown,
brilliant.

253
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,210
You know,
in Dr Rhonda,

254
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:04,580
Patrick and Joe and Ian and you know
that that component and all the fights

255
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,310
companion and I love that.
Me,

256
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,100
I like it the way that normal and I
don't think he,

257
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,250
I don't think it gives us the right to
try and walk them.

258
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:11,520
Walk.
Uh,

259
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:11,831
yeah.
Um,

260
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:12,260
well,
no,

261
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,130
not,
I've been spot if he ties because of

262
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,350
your shell.
Even in Thailand and not black,

263
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,870
I still wouldn't be any different.
Well,

264
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,010
you especially because you're so aware
of these traps that the mindsets,

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
it is a weird dance that we do in this
life where you're trying to sort of

266
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:35,220
manage the mind and figure out what it
is that's holding you back or helping

267
00:11:35,221 --> 00:11:38,550
you or you know,
just sort of guide yourself through this

268
00:11:38,551 --> 00:11:41,700
existence.
Nine Times out of 10 your unconscious

269
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,700
mind is trying to help you,
but people decipher it wrongly.

270
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,480
I think it stays.
It's the language that you mind speaks.

271
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,640
I'll get into it.
Understand that to move away from chaos.

272
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,770
Like I said,
we're going to do a technique if that's

273
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:53,660
all right.
Yeah.

274
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,160
You just

275
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,010
want everybody not to be driving when
doing this.

276
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,850
All operating.
Any machinery here.

277
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,590
We're going to do a technique,
folks strapping,

278
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:03,010
but he relax,
you know,

279
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,710
and I want to share that,
um,

280
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,420
because you know,
chaos is not easy,

281
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,760
life is easy,
life isn't easy.

282
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,980
You got all sorts of cesium bursts in
burst.

283
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:12,880
Exactly.
You know,

284
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:16,510
you can be me going along and all of a
sudden you get sideswiped by something,

285
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,240
you know what I mean,
and can,

286
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,630
you know,
not if for sex or,

287
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,270
you know,
etc. So it's about trying to calm the

288
00:12:22,271 --> 00:12:23,690
chaos down and,
and,

289
00:12:23,691 --> 00:12:26,260
you know,
and just get your mind to settle and

290
00:12:26,261 --> 00:12:28,390
give yourself even a few moments of
peace.

291
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:31,120
Even a few momentS of patient the day
would be,

292
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:35,050
you know,
it would be beneficial to everybody.

293
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:35,884
I think,
you know,

294
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,720
that's what I think anyway,
you know,

295
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,810
my opinion.
No,

296
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,510
I agree.
And for what it's worth,

297
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,920
I agree.
I,

298
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,170
I think we could all use some peace and
reflection.

299
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,560
So that's a big thing.
Yeah.

300
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,860
And I think like many of us are in a,
in a lot of ways are a prisoner of doubt

301
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,300
and fear.
Those are,

302
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:01,330
those are two big factors in a lot of
people's lives and a lot of people's

303
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,020
response to doubt and fear is to not do
anything,

304
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,870
to not take any chances to try to live
safe,

305
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,080
to try to live like very a very
controlled and simple existence,

306
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,110
but then you miss out on experiences to
look back on is that you also miss out

307
00:13:21,111 --> 00:13:26,111
on the the.
There's just living life without fear

308
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,040
doesn't mean there's not going to be
moments where you're scared and and

309
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:34,940
taking chances because those moments
when you do take chances are you do

310
00:13:34,941 --> 00:13:39,020
something new and it could be as simple
as like being a 50 year old man starting

311
00:13:39,021 --> 00:13:41,270
jujitsu or 50 year old woman,
you know,

312
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,800
starting a martial arts class or
something.

313
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,210
Something like,
I can't believe I'm doing this,

314
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:49,070
but those moments where you put yourself
into vulnerable positions can be very

315
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:52,550
beneficial for you.
So it's not a matter of avoiding

316
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:56,420
everything that causes you fear.
It's a matter of embracing the

317
00:13:56,421 --> 00:14:01,421
uncertainty of life and trying to
experience it with as much positivity

318
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:07,460
and as much openness and as much with
the least resistance as possible.

319
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,590
Yeah.
Everything was new.

320
00:14:08,591 --> 00:14:12,460
Once
everyone's done something learned

321
00:14:12,461 --> 00:14:14,630
something the first time,
the first time he.

322
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,140
Does that make sense?
You know,

323
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,470
and for me so people don't understand.
Is that a massive,

324
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,980
massive amount of successes you've had
in your life that you thought was

325
00:14:23,981 --> 00:14:28,981
impossible to tie in your life?
Riding a bike for me driving that was

326
00:14:29,381 --> 00:14:31,600
awful.
Driving mouth wash.

327
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,660
I don't know,
I was just one of those things that got

328
00:14:33,661 --> 00:14:38,170
into my head that I was really shy.
Another car I love rubbish.

329
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:43,171
I love that expression and the british,
I was rubbish at it and I'm so they are

330
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:48,601
to basically do it because I lived far
away from my kids and now I can drive

331
00:14:48,941 --> 00:14:49,950
and,
and it,

332
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:53,420
it was something out I to really push
myself to do.

333
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,780
But I think we're all a collection of
successes trying case writing the date.

334
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,850
Right.
You know all what reed,

335
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,720
you know,
telling the time,

336
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,800
you know,
these loads are thinking what we treat.

337
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,520
So you're busy kicking the shit
ourselves about what we've done wrong,

338
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,103
you know,
for me,

339
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:12,140
when I watched holly holm fight last
time when she fought,

340
00:15:12,141 --> 00:15:14,680
she looked shellshocked and I,
I,

341
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,000
that's my opinion.
She looked shellshocked.

342
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:18,530
Do you think she was perhaps

343
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,850
shellshocked by the last to misha tate
and then jumping right back into the

344
00:15:21,851 --> 00:15:23,900
octagon?
Or do you think that was.

345
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,280
She was fighting a very,
very difficult opponent

346
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,840
both because valentina

347
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,400
is a volunteership genco.
The woman who she fought is one of the

348
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:36,130
most experienced strikers in all of mma.

349
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,890
Period.
well the sister was on a infusion season

350
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:42,020
six with us in Thailand.
Yeah.

351
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,400
So she,
she's from Peru,

352
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,760
things lives in Peru,
but now she,

353
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,050
she's russian.
I understand that.

354
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,360
But she still looked shellshocked.
Do you know what I mean?

355
00:15:49,361 --> 00:15:49,710
And,
and,

356
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,280
and I think that's,
it's part of the process.

357
00:15:54,281 --> 00:15:58,060
I mean I think a lot of gems because
it's macho because it's fight in a year

358
00:15:58,061 --> 00:15:59,770
you'd be all right.
And pat on thE back bar.

359
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,250
You did great today.
If you have a demon like this,

360
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:08,000
it's like you do know whitewash and you
put all your white in and then you your.

361
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,290
I served almost conditioning.
Oh right.

362
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,270
I have got my diet right amman point for
from a weight,

363
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:13,751
blah,
blah,

364
00:16:13,751 --> 00:16:15,790
blah.
My coach says mma bjj is great or

365
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,680
whatever,
or boxing or whatever the sport may be,

366
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,380
or even if it's not sport,
you know your boss or whatever,

367
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:23,230
and then all of a sudden you put one red
sock in your wash.

368
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,760
Everything goes pink so that little
thought that can infect you.

369
00:16:27,761 --> 00:16:28,594
So you say,
oh,

370
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,680
you might sit there and the loneliest
places I think find someone and lost it

371
00:16:32,681 --> 00:16:36,050
in the changing rooms.
I think that's my opinion of fighters

372
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,040
did lose in the changing rooms to have
one sort of negative thought.

373
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,800
The mind whispers something,
it becomes a shower and all of a sudden

374
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:42,970
you drag it with you.
Well,

375
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,860
fighter fights can be lost,
but no matter how positive you are

376
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,410
fighting anderson silva and you pee in
his prime.

377
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,430
Yeah,
you're probably,

378
00:16:51,431 --> 00:16:52,690
fuck yeah,
there is that.

379
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:56,800
That's why I said he's not a guarantee.
Using a mind coach isn't a guarantee

380
00:16:56,801 --> 00:16:58,570
you're going to win.
For me,

381
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,260
it's more help.
Astronomer condition is not going to

382
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,350
make you win,
but it's a massive help you.

383
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,350
Of course it is.
I mean,

384
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,330
I,
I,

385
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,980
I know the benefit of it.
you know the benefit of it because you

386
00:17:08,981 --> 00:17:12,430
did a little bit of hypnosis,
josie and the benefit of it in his life

387
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:13,820
as well as any fight in.
You know,

388
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:17,050
liam harrison is a good friend of mine.
Jordan watson,

389
00:17:17,051 --> 00:17:19,240
the other people that have worked with
another people that will work in the

390
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:22,780
future.
It does give you a of nerves and self

391
00:17:22,781 --> 00:17:26,270
doubt.
Is it massive hole in your boat if

392
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,900
you're going to do something where you
have to have confidence for everything

393
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:29,740
in life?
Yes indeed.

394
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:34,210
This one of the things that I like about
fighting is that it's so condensed.

395
00:17:34,211 --> 00:17:37,180
It's,
it's a very extreme situation.

396
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,910
It's,
it's sort of like problem solving,

397
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,440
condensed to like one of the most
intense versions of it that we possibly

398
00:17:44,441 --> 00:17:47,440
can experience other than war,
war,

399
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,400
probably being the most intense of
problem solving,

400
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,980
but it's,
you're presenting with all these

401
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,540
incredibly difficult challenges and you
have to figure your way through it and

402
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:00,960
with a poor mindset or a faulty mind
that you're,

403
00:18:00,961 --> 00:18:01,670
you're,
you're,

404
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,270
it's like having a flat tire or having
bad breaks.

405
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,660
It's like you're traveling in a very
precarious way.

406
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,450
It's you,
you have a lot of holes in whatever

407
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:17,030
method of distribution that your
thoughts and your actions are,

408
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:21,690
are passing through your system,
your system of life,

409
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,850
like who you are,
the way you think about things.

410
00:18:23,851 --> 00:18:26,010
When you think about yourself,
where you would think about other people

411
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,440
like that shapes all the results,
all the interactions that you have with

412
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:33,720
people are shaped.
It's one of the things that I've always

413
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:37,710
said about like a lot of these
interactIons that police officers have

414
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,573
with,
uh,

415
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,580
with people like how many of these
interactions would be completely

416
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:45,930
different with a more calm police
officer,

417
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,520
a better person who's better at handling
people and how many of them are shaped

418
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:55,521
by someone who's just not that smart or
too authoritarian or doesn't know how to

419
00:18:56,071 --> 00:19:00,130
read people well or doesn't know how to
broach a conversation well.

420
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:02,300
Again,
it goes back dealing with something in

421
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,440
their own mind.
yes.

422
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,540
Dating me,
something in narrow mind,

423
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,120
like we talked about limitless,
didn't we?

424
00:19:07,121 --> 00:19:10,400
The movie bradley cooper first takes the
pill and he saw,

425
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,320
he said the chinese lady on the top of
the stairs,

426
00:19:12,321 --> 00:19:14,180
I think she's his lung lady ladies show
you or something.

427
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,890
She's going bananas,
right?

428
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,660
Just going bananas are him,
you know,

429
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,440
talking rubbish and I'm.
Tcc has given him lots of grief and

430
00:19:21,441 --> 00:19:22,071
blah,
blah blah.

431
00:19:22,071 --> 00:19:25,610
But it went beyond.
It all is something that was upsetting

432
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,444
her.
Right?

433
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,570
That's,
that's what you come across a lot in

434
00:19:29,571 --> 00:19:32,570
timeline already in anything.
Rarely is there.

435
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,170
They're actually taught,
they're Not really taught,

436
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,710
people are not theIr behaviors as
cliched nlp,

437
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,610
nlp chat,
but if people are not happy in neuro

438
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:43,190
linguistic programming,
what is that about?

439
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:45,620
A maker engineer.
Robin's right.

440
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,200
YeAh.

441
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,110
Anthony robbins and john grinder.
Richard bandler were the first people to

442
00:19:51,111 --> 00:19:53,440
do it.
They modeled a hypnotherapist called

443
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:57,110
milton erickson,
milton erickson language.

444
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,880
Milton erickson was very,
very good hypnotherapists and very,

445
00:20:01,881 --> 00:20:04,070
very clever on indeed.
So yeah,

446
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,200
and the,
some of that I used some of that,

447
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,510
you know,
but um,

448
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:09,270
you get,
you get,

449
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,970
as you get anything,
you don't understand this,

450
00:20:10,971 --> 00:20:11,320
you know,
you,

451
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,180
you do your podcast energy as you get
more and more into it,

452
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:16,490
you get a feel of fur and that's what
you do with my job,

453
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,180
wIth the mind coaches they get afraid
of.

454
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,600
But I don't always use hypnosis.
I do use it and it was his,

455
00:20:20,601 --> 00:20:22,710
but not always because it's not always
necessary.

456
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,370
It's getting people thinking,
reframIng something.

457
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,800
So maybe thought of it like that and
move that out the way.

458
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:30,610
And that's,
that changes people's opinions and,

459
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,270
and come out massive effects on them.

460
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:36,820
So the more people you interact with,
the more people you apply these

461
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:38,740
techniques to,
the better your understanding of how

462
00:20:38,741 --> 00:20:39,700
these techniques work.

463
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,260
Yeah,
I rolled a better understanding of

464
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:43,230
people.
I think you've got to be out at sorts of

465
00:20:43,231 --> 00:20:46,370
people as well doing this gel,
but I think you've got to be at a church

466
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,280
now.
Not saying I'm massively,

467
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,680
no loads of stuff,
but I don't know little bits about

468
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,760
things,
you know,

469
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,310
and I don't pretend to know about a lot
of things,

470
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,600
but he's just about just being able to
communicate with people and actually get

471
00:20:58,601 --> 00:20:59,630
them,
you know,

472
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,380
actually getting them.
People pretty much want the same thing.

473
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,890
You know what I mean?
Everyone wants to live life as,

474
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,940
as,
as exciting or as easy as possible.

475
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,490
You know,
you know,

476
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,650
like I said before,
it's just about language.

477
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,870
It's just about deciphering the
language,

478
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:21,871
what they're actually talking and not
even really as easy as possible because

479
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,820
a lot of people want a life full of
adventure,

480
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:27,580
but what they don't want to do is trip
over themselves.

481
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,480
Like if you have a difficulty and Saved,
you're going to climb a mountain.

482
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:34,300
Right?
I think that climbing a mountain is

483
00:21:34,301 --> 00:21:36,010
difficult enough.
Yeah,

484
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,760
it's hard.

485
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,020
You have to figure out what way to grip.
You have to have strong hands and strong

486
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:44,080
feet.
You have to have an overall awareness of

487
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:48,930
your body and balance and you have to be
physically fit enough to build a pool

488
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,940
yourself and climb up this mountain.
If you're paralyzed with fear,

489
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,770
if you are consumed with self doubt,
if you were overrun with guilt,

490
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,390
if your body is just dealing with the
minds,

491
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,240
all the haunts of your past,
that's the compounds.

492
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:12,250
Whatever difficultY and it makes it way
worse.

493
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,500
That's what,
you know,

494
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,070
people come to me after fights and the,
you know,

495
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:21,280
they talk about the last fight is still
involved in it.

496
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,480
You know,
they don't tAke the positive from it and

497
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:26,180
I'd say take the ponds and new blah blah
blah.

498
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,330
But I mean,
you hard to say,

499
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,230
well,
it's hard to do rather than to out

500
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,064
today.

501
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,680
Let's go to the moon.
Right.

502
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,050
Basically.
You know what I mean?

503
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,580
So you just.
For me,

504
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:42,030
he's like just just getting the person
just to sometimes forget something,

505
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,040
you know what I mean?
And just move on and write.

506
00:22:45,041 --> 00:22:45,910
Okay,
that's something.

507
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,650
What did you learn this,
this and this.

508
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:48,484
Well,
that's the point.

509
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,580
That's what we know when we was doing
timeline therapy,

510
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,860
you know,
there was things you learn from that

511
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:58,110
situation that got you here.
Got you.

512
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,060
The ufc come and say successful,
stand up on a lot.

513
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:04,030
He's got your way.
You've got because of them things that

514
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,320
molded you.
You know,

515
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,680
some people do get consumed by fear,
which is why I.

516
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,800
That's why I like to change,
you know,

517
00:23:11,801 --> 00:23:13,120
I like to change the.
Yeah,

518
00:23:13,121 --> 00:23:15,700
there's the,
there's a big problem that a lot of

519
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:18,730
people have where they define themselves
by their past.

520
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,040
They look at their past,
they don't think they could ever grow

521
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,850
from that.
They think that is who I am.

522
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:25,710
I'm not losers.
I'm the guy who crashed his car on that

523
00:23:25,711 --> 00:23:26,910
guy that,
you know,

524
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,500
whatever it was that moment that never
did it.

525
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:30,730
So therefore,
you know,

526
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,190
like money is the root of all evil.
All you have money or they saw your

527
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,160
keynote,
you have to tread on people to be a

528
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,350
success as cliched saying.
Just pop up from nowhere.

529
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,720
You know?
That's a real weird one that comes up a

530
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,330
lot that almost like it's impossible to
be successful

531
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:51,330
in altruistic that year.
That money is acquired only by stepping

532
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:54,470
on other people and fucking over people
and anybody that's really big in

533
00:23:54,471 --> 00:23:57,590
business get like.
I read that once from someone who

534
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,950
actually a very smart person and said,
show me someone who's really good in

535
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:02,930
business and I guarantee you they fuck
someone over,

536
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,050
and I like that as everyday that's,
that's as a scapegoat.

537
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,900
The scapegoat for your own financial
failure.

538
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,550
Closest thing.
The more money you get,

539
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,500
the more money.
The more people you can help.

540
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:14,920
There's that for sure.
There's more opportunity.

541
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,360
Yeah,
that's what I believe and I'm believing

542
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,380
and I think it's cliched.
The other thing about money is to just

543
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:25,920
to keep people down.
I think that's that existed.

544
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,940
You know what I mean?
His language to keep people down,

545
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:31,260
to keep people just there,
to keep them in the place.

546
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,670
Well,
it's also self self prescribe to a lot

547
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:38,040
of people do it to themselves.
No one's doing it to you.

548
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,140
You just want to.
You want to give yourself a little

549
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:45,141
excuse for not going after whatever your
goals are or not pursuing whatever

550
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:48,030
interest you actually have and just
playing it safe.

551
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:51,840
That playing it safe.
I think a big part of that is what we

552
00:24:51,841 --> 00:24:53,190
were talking about earlier,
is this,

553
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:57,180
this need to avoid any further pain.
Yeah.

554
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,820
You know,
one thing wanting to Japan is like

555
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,970
you're not allowed to like yourself.
I mean,

556
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,210
you know,
you're not allowed to be not fun.

557
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:10,960
I mean it's all right.
You gotta have fun and laugh at yourself

558
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,960
and not take yourself massively tissues.
Well,

559
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,900
the things that you want to be serious,
you should be supporting yourself less

560
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:18,610
than 100 percent.
Support is sabotage,

561
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,470
which has a say in which I believe it's
true.

562
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,970
You know,
if you're not supporting yourself,

563
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,920
aesop mythology,
not only you but you sabotage and

564
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:27,400
everybody else around you.
And I think people struggle with that be

565
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,680
in being all right to themselves.
You know,

566
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:34,770
the so easy to shit and stupid and fat
and so easily swallowed that you,

567
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:40,270
you know,
people be become used to it and then

568
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:43,210
they want to be a success.
It doesn't make sense.

569
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,210
Now I recently the,
you know,

570
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:50,270
these people that want to fight and then
he got lost me fight and blah blah blah.

571
00:25:50,561 --> 00:25:53,710
And then you find out what they did onto
the runup or what did you do?

572
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,570
Oh,
I got drunk,

573
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:59,350
let's say a week before.
Hello fucking surprise if you're not

574
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,340
live in it and if you're not,
you know,

575
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:02,390
getting,
you know,

576
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,950
really immersing yourself in every way
in the language that you speak to

577
00:26:05,951 --> 00:26:08,200
yourself and in the way that you do
everything else.

578
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,430
What do you expect your mind not going
to support you if you don't support it.

579
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:17,120
That was one of the things that I felt
when jon jones tested positive for

580
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:19,670
cocaine three weeks out of his fight
with daniel cormier,

581
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,504
I was like,
ooh.

582
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,740
Like he's not even as I look,
I only was anything wrong with doing.

583
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,440
I don't know if there's anything wrong
with doing cocaine.

584
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:29,660
I just,
I don't think it's a positive drug put.

585
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:32,630
Some people enjoy it.
some people enjoy drinking.

586
00:26:32,631 --> 00:26:34,610
I enjoy drinking.
I don't think that's a positive drug

587
00:26:34,611 --> 00:26:36,800
necessarily either,
so I don't know because I don't have

588
00:26:36,801 --> 00:26:39,800
experience with cocaine,
but that's not something you're supposed

589
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:42,830
to be doing three weeks outside of a
world title fight with one of the best

590
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,530
wrestlers in the sport.
One of the most difficult challenges

591
00:26:46,531 --> 00:26:50,640
you've ever faced in your professional
career and you're out doing blow just 21

592
00:26:50,641 --> 00:26:52,050
days before.
That's crazy.

593
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,520
Yeah.
Sometimes the most talented take the

594
00:26:54,521 --> 00:26:57,970
gifts that they've been given and just
abused them in a way.

595
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,830
I met.
I met jon jones.

596
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:00,664
He's,
um,

597
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,610
it's different to say the least.
In what way?

598
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,510
She's just a bit.
It was a dot.

599
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:10,660
I didn't know it was,
it was kind of only met him briefly.

600
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,620
Why was it.
I might been Russia at the legend that

601
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:17,080
is a show there.
And uh,

602
00:27:17,081 --> 00:27:17,914
yeah,
he was just,

603
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,560
he was very sort of,
it was all over the place bouncing

604
00:27:20,561 --> 00:27:23,710
around and I just,
I just didn't expect him to be like

605
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,720
that.
What do you mean by all over the place?

606
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,760
Bouncing just a.
He just said to me,

607
00:27:27,761 --> 00:27:29,800
hi blue eyes.
I would like hello.

608
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,450
He's massive from dangerous and I'm not.
I was like,

609
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:37,180
hi.
I just found it a bit strange.

610
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,730
Maybe I read it with you.

611
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,900
I just found him different.
Let's just say that I just found him

612
00:27:43,901 --> 00:27:47,430
different and I,
I'm trying to read into this and I'm

613
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,430
trying to avoid it badly.
I don't know him,

614
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,830
but I met.
It was,

615
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,330
it was different.
Let's put it that way,

616
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,830
you know,
but um,

617
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,150
if,
if they,

618
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,480
if someone,
I don't know,

619
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,890
you don't know what's gone on in his
life and uh,

620
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,210
you know,
you don't know what's going on in his

621
00:28:04,211 --> 00:28:06,700
life and you could say that about.
Everyone could say that about a serial

622
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:07,420
killer couldn't.
Yeah.

623
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,950
What are we doing?
What's going on in his life?

624
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,560
It's not useful,
you know,

625
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,100
really.
I mean there is some things that you

626
00:28:12,101 --> 00:28:13,630
shouldn't do and you know,
he shouldn't be doing it,

627
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,150
but these reason,

628
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,160
if you listen to john's coaches,
they will tell you that john surrounds

629
00:28:19,161 --> 00:28:24,161
himself with the wrong people.
And john is an extremely talented guy,

630
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,980
amazing.
It's only like maybe one of the most

631
00:28:27,981 --> 00:28:32,630
talented guys to ever compete in the
sport and incredibly strong mentally

632
00:28:32,631 --> 00:28:36,530
too,
because despite all of his issues with

633
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,970
maybe not preparing as well as you could
when the chips are down,

634
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,460
that guy gets through things.
He overcomes.

635
00:28:43,461 --> 00:28:46,130
Adversity is not a front runner.
He's the one that broke his toe,

636
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:47,480
isn't a.
That was terrific.

637
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,850
So he's coming and he didn't even
realize that was happening,

638
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:54,230
that that happened actually in the final
flurry where you stopped shale son and a

639
00:28:54,231 --> 00:28:57,620
more impressive performances when he
fought vito belfort,

640
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,380
vito,
or completely hyperextended his arm and

641
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:03,400
he would not tap you.
It was for his title vii tour.

642
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,630
Came that close.
Was it for the title?

643
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,700
I believe it was.
It might've been non title fight,

644
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,510
but vetoer came find out that was a
title fight or non title fight.

645
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,110
Either way,
vidor came that close to legitimately

646
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:20,010
beating John Jones.
That close god fully locked in armbar.

647
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,000
That would have made 90 percent of the
professional fighters in the world tap.

648
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,630
Well,
that's what makes him who he is.

649
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,930
But he put it,
but you couldn't say no to.

650
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,280
It was a title fight.
Yeah.

651
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,100
Jamie just looked at it.
He couldn't say no to some below.

652
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,870
Well he could say no.
You want.

653
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,360
Didn't want us to get
some sort of.

654
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,370
I don't know if it's weakness.
I don't know.

655
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,120
There's some sort of weakness but isn't

656
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,400
say that.
Don't know if it is a.

657
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,160
It's not.
It shouldn't be something you should be

658
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:47,800
doing.
It's also indulgence.

659
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:51,070
It's like
he likes to party,

660
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,230
you know?
But then there's.

661
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,900
Isn't there also the issue that fighters
in particular,

662
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,210
especially guys that have a lot of hard
gym sessions and a lot of hard fights,

663
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:06,010
they have impulse control problems and
those impulse control problems.

664
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,320
I'm obviously not a scientist or a
doctor,

665
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:11,500
but when you talk to neurologists and
neuroscientists,

666
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,660
they will tell you that there are direct
correlations between head impacts and

667
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:21,661
poor impulse control is absolutely a
direct impact and I'm not looking for a

668
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:26,770
scapegoat in my own life,
but I've looked back at some of the poor

669
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:28,660
decision making that I've done in my
life,

670
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,800
particularly in my fighting times like
back then and I was like,

671
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,170
I wonder if a lot of that was getting
hit in the head a lot.

672
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,490
Like,
like it can't be good to get kicked in

673
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:41,050
the head.
It's just never good.

674
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,310
Not the best is not good and so if
you've been kicked in the head or

675
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,800
punched in the face or whatever,
any kind of impact.

676
00:30:47,801 --> 00:30:49,790
And that's the thing about football
players.

677
00:30:49,791 --> 00:30:53,470
They're saying now,
is it even a shot to the chest even

678
00:30:53,471 --> 00:30:57,010
getting tackled like someone rams at you
and slams their shoulders into your

679
00:30:57,011 --> 00:31:00,250
chest.
The brain gets jostled around.

680
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,950
You might not have a bruise on your
face,

681
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:07,300
but your brain is receiving essentially
the same impact as a punch.

682
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,110
Just kinda crazy.
You know,

683
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,750
a lot of people might not like they
split.

684
00:31:13,751 --> 00:31:17,020
It is a shame that jon jones is gone.
Do you know what I mean?

685
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:18,840
Because he's got to look back on him.
Yeah.

686
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,950
You know what I mean?
He's got to look back on him and they

687
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,240
fuck,
you know,

688
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:25,590
he's also got to figure out what it is
that he took no data.

689
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:26,950
They don't even.
Exactly.

690
00:31:26,951 --> 00:31:31,930
They have an isolated what he took,
but the whole lifestyle,

691
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:36,820
it's most certainly an issue and it's
almost like one of those things where

692
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,950
you say you don't know what you got
until it's gone.

693
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,350
Well,
it was kind of gone for a little while,

694
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:44,590
but not really.
He was always still in the mix and there

695
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:48,710
was always multimillion dollar fights,
a waiting and then he fought over in st

696
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:51,100
prue.
So he's back in the mix and everything's

697
00:31:51,101 --> 00:31:55,600
looking good.
He's slated to fight at ufc 200 against

698
00:31:55,601 --> 00:31:58,240
daniel cormier is going to make 10
million bucks.

699
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,480
It's going to be giant and then whoosh.
It's gone for something that if you talk

700
00:32:04,521 --> 00:32:09,220
to people that are experts in
performance enhancing drugs,

701
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:12,310
they'll tell you that this clomiphene is
what he got popped for,

702
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:17,170
which is an anti estrogen supplement
that's not even beneficial.

703
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,040
The only time that stuff's beneficial is
a set of essentially when you're coming

704
00:32:21,041 --> 00:32:23,760
off of steroids,
but yet he didn't test positive for

705
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:27,670
steroids before or after.
So it could have been a tainted

706
00:32:27,671 --> 00:32:29,530
supplement.
It could have been a mistake.

707
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:33,070
It could have been.
Who knows what wacky shit he was taken.

708
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:33,970
I mean,
I don't know.

709
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,200
I just think that,
you know,

710
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:39,310
people forget that they lot.
Sometimes you still to have guidance,

711
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,500
you know,
you still go have a guide and you know,

712
00:32:42,501 --> 00:32:43,460
to just say,
look,

713
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,840
is that the best thing you should be
doing?

714
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,640
Also wants to talk.
So you know what I mean?

715
00:32:46,641 --> 00:32:50,630
It's that that's not going to be high
five and you cause you're going to stick

716
00:32:50,631 --> 00:32:53,350
a load of bugle you nose.
Isn't it harder though?

717
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,440
I think for champions,
because once they like dominate someone

718
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:00,530
to kick someone's ass,
like say if you find the most difficult

719
00:33:00,531 --> 00:33:01,820
fight of your career,
you fight,

720
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,223
you know,
uh,

721
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:05,450
whether there's daniel cormier,
whoever it is,

722
00:33:05,451 --> 00:33:09,080
you dominate them,
you win and beautiful fashion and then

723
00:33:09,081 --> 00:33:09,910
you know,
you like,

724
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,690
god damn it,
I am the fucking man,

725
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,830
and then you just want to do whatever
you want to do after that and indulgence

726
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:18,200
and chaos and yeah,
he did it,

727
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,740
but it comes to bite you on the ass all
the time.

728
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,510
It does,
but god dammit,

729
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:28,511
it is a fucking story that plays itself
out over and over and over and over and

730
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:31,790
over.
And there's a bunch of these

731
00:33:31,791 --> 00:33:35,630
distractions stories like the ronda
rousey story is ultimately a story of

732
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:37,310
distraction.
I mean,

733
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:41,690
here's this woman who is just a freak,
right?

734
00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,130
A completely dominant female ass kicker.
Something that we've never had before.

735
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,930
I mean,
we had like female fighters before,

736
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,850
like you remember christy martin was
sort of a.

737
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,100
So yeah,
like there was like a little bit of it

738
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:57,410
with laila ali.
People were kind of paying attention to

739
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,450
her,
but no one was paying attention to

740
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:02,420
anyone even remotely on the scale of
ronda rousey.

741
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,610
But what happens then?
Well,

742
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:07,760
all of a sudden hollywood opens up
doors.

743
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,760
You start doing movies,
you get all these offers,

744
00:34:10,761 --> 00:34:13,940
you the darling of talk shows.
You're in fucking commercials all the

745
00:34:13,941 --> 00:34:14,774
time.

746
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,840
Everybody wants to kiss your ass and
there's people that are coming up all

747
00:34:20,211 --> 00:34:25,211
around you that are assassins and
they're not getting all this attention.

748
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,910
They're just hungry.
They're not like holly holm.

749
00:34:28,911 --> 00:34:31,010
When she fought,
ronda was a massive underdog.

750
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:32,060
Meantime,
meanwhile,

751
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,080
she was a 19 time world boxing champion.
She was a far more accomplished striker

752
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,140
than ronda and ronda fought the exact
wrong fight when you're fighting a 19

753
00:34:41,301 --> 00:34:45,080
time world boxing champion.
Whereas misha tate fought the exact

754
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,180
right fight,
standing outside,

755
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,340
barely,
barely engage her with strikes.

756
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,780
Just push her,
push her,

757
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:52,810
but backdrop,
pusher and backup pusher.

758
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:56,510
Constantly move,
constantly vary your approach and then

759
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,990
when you get ahold of her account and
she did that in the second round and

760
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,990
then ultimately she did it in the fifth
round and submitted her and that's what

761
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:06,380
one or the fight,
the difference between someone who has

762
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,440
everything to gain like that.
Someone who is hungry and then the

763
00:35:12,681 --> 00:35:16,130
fucking mindset of someone who becomes
super successful.

764
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:17,730
Like a Mike Tyson in his prime.
Yeah.

765
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:19,130
Yeah.
Like just.

766
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:21,560
You've just started fucking off.
You start believing that no one's going

767
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,770
to beat your ass and then you fight
buster douglas with very little training

768
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,570
and he fucking puts that leather.
Your face and reality hits you.

769
00:35:29,571 --> 00:35:31,730
When that referee standing over you
counting,

770
00:35:31,731 --> 00:35:32,750
you realize,
oh,

771
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:36,950
this is happening to me now.
it must be difficult.

772
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,070
Any muslim

773
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:40,110
bez,
but fighting is not easy to say.

774
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,093
No.
It's definitely not.

775
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,170
I mean,
I was talking to somebody yesterday.

776
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:46,220
We went out to a thai restaurant with
some friends from back.

777
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,100
Brian [inaudible] moves me,
bail my may have come to see our and

778
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:53,800
we'll just talk and him was talking
about fighting a fight so hard and only

779
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,720
nervous or scared or whatever.
You was screaming ouT you,

780
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,490
you were there corner screaming shirt.
You think in what they telling him

781
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,490
you're in the crowd if you're not,
if you're not zoned in properly.

782
00:36:05,491 --> 00:36:07,120
And it's not easy.
I mean,

783
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,350
you know,
invite as you know,

784
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,910
all of a sudden the defined something,
they might not have been the hardest kid

785
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:13,200
at school,
you might not have been,

786
00:36:13,201 --> 00:36:14,070
you know,
the most popular.

787
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:17,130
All of a sudden after a few fights he
just seemed like whack.

788
00:36:17,131 --> 00:36:19,890
He's like John Jones or,
or rhonda and all of a sudden you're in

789
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:22,990
this loads of money and people are
paying you attention that,

790
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:24,230
you know,
wouldn't assaults.

791
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:27,390
See what school and stuff like that.
It's a muslim.

792
00:36:27,391 --> 00:36:30,330
Be easy,
but nevertheless you still got some.

793
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,680
You've still got.
I think that,

794
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,010
you know,
you've got to maintain the rules.

795
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:38,820
You've got to abide the rules.
You have to have someone who helps you.

796
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:41,860
I think every fighter,
I mean I shouldn't say every fighter

797
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:43,480
because some kind of figured out on
their own.

798
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,330
There's some guys that don't seem to
fall into those traps,

799
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,960
but most fighters can use some sort of
guidelines and there's also these

800
00:36:51,971 --> 00:36:54,640
facilitators that manifest themselves in
your life.

801
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,960
These people that want to make your life
easier so they could be a part of your

802
00:36:58,961 --> 00:37:01,450
life.
So they want to bring over girls.

803
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:05,020
They want to bring over booze.
They want to get you into the club.

804
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:06,670
They want to.
They want to like,

805
00:37:06,671 --> 00:37:07,750
hey,
this is a,

806
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:09,670
that guy that he's going to set
everything up for you.

807
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:12,130
I'll take care of it.
And when they're doing is these guys

808
00:37:12,131 --> 00:37:15,670
are.
They get into your life and the way they

809
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:19,570
get into your life as by making things
easier for you so they can be a part of

810
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:20,350
the,
you know,

811
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:22,390
Mike Tyson camp or whatever it is.

812
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:25,030
And then next thing you know,
you've got this entourage of 20 people

813
00:37:25,031 --> 00:37:28,320
hanging around you and most of them are
just fucking idiots and don't know who

814
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:30,910
they are.
And you're paying for their existence.

815
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:35,200
You are funding their existence and what
they do is they hold doors open for you

816
00:37:35,201 --> 00:37:38,170
and they check you into hotel rooms.
They do all these things that you could

817
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:40,960
do on your own.
They sort of make it easier and in

818
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:45,961
making it easier,
they sort of defined what is okay and

819
00:37:46,601 --> 00:37:47,291
then like,
you know,

820
00:37:47,291 --> 00:37:48,370
no big deal.
Just going to go party.

821
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,810
You gonna fuck this guy up.
Anyway man,

822
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,900
let's go hit the club.
And then next thing you know you're out

823
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,490
late at night,
not getting rest.

824
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:58,830
Your coach is texting you,
are you in bed and you're not because

825
00:37:58,831 --> 00:38:01,020
you're hanging around with these fucking
cling on

826
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,560
and then when you've lost,
they vanish,

827
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,990
they vanish and then you've lost.
You vanish.

828
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,340
And then you've got to pick up the
pieces.

829
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,810
That's as one interesting more I'd like
to do is I'd like to people for me to be

830
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:17,690
able to hire me,
obviously to be able to talk soon,

831
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,400
you know,
not just use it now.

832
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:21,110
She was like,
this is on my mind.

833
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:22,010
Well this,
this and this.

834
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:27,340
Not to potter a block on before they do
something that's fucking stupid.

835
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:30,450
Do you know what I mean?
I'd like to do that and I think you'll

836
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,600
do that anyway.
Do you know what I mean?

837
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,490
But I just.
It's difficult.

838
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,040
It's difficult

839
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,440
to make it stick.
Yeah.

840
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,120
Like if you have a good idea in your
head about like,

841
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:42,520
you know what I need to do with my life?
I need to eat healthy,

842
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:45,040
I need to exercise.
You need to follow my dreams.

843
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,173
Okay,
good.

844
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,400
Right now that's a.
That's a good thought right now,

845
00:38:48,401 --> 00:38:50,890
but how do you keep that?
How do you make it stick?

846
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,980
and that's a big issue with people that
go up and they go down.

847
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,470
I mean how ridiculous our new year's
resolutions.

848
00:38:56,471 --> 00:38:59,800
How many people have come to you after
new years in there that are going to

849
00:38:59,801 --> 00:39:01,850
lose 50 pounds?
I'm going to stop smoking,

850
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,610
I'm not going to eat any unhealthy.
And then you see them like a couple of

851
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,700
weeks later,
they look great.

852
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,560
Well you're sticking to it.
That's awesome man.

853
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,180
Congratulations by the money,
isn't it?

854
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:12,820
And then five months later they're fat
again.

855
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:16,180
And looking stupid and it's so normal,

856
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,930
so funny,
isn't it?

857
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,090
Have clubs go right?
You joined in january,

858
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,430
you get free january and then you blah
blah blah.

859
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:25,090
And they go god often when really join
in fee and then the jain,

860
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,150
that's it.
New year,

861
00:39:26,151 --> 00:39:31,151
new me january this 30 new year new me.
And then they just like january the

862
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,990
third.
Oh well blah blah blah.

863
00:39:35,991 --> 00:39:38,510
can't be asked.
Or I was listening to this type of least

864
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:39,170
resistance.

865
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:41,840
I was listening to a ted talk.
It was a ted podcast.

866
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:42,471
And in this,
uh,

867
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:45,440
it was also a ted talk with.
They're talking about time in the way

868
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:49,610
people perceive time and the way people
perceive time.

869
00:39:49,611 --> 00:39:53,630
They always perceive that they are now a
finished product.

870
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,490
This is like a big thing that people
like to do.

871
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,380
They're like,
they look at themselves like,

872
00:39:57,381 --> 00:39:57,891
wow,
you know,

873
00:39:57,891 --> 00:40:01,910
when I was 20 I didn't know shit,
but now that I'm 30 I got it together.

874
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:03,110
And then when they're,
do they go,

875
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:04,790
well,
when I was 30 I thought I knew

876
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:08,480
something,
but now I know things and they always

877
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:10,940
want to thank that.
They're done growing,

878
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,150
but what this podcast is sort of
emphasizing is that people are in a

879
00:40:14,151 --> 00:40:18,740
constant state of change and evolution.
If you're thinking about things,

880
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,230
you know the expression,
no one's perfect.

881
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,180
This true.
No one is perfect,

882
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:27,860
so if in fact you're not perfect,
that means you're considering whatever

883
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:31,190
you've done that maybe you could have
done better or maybe we could have

884
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:34,460
handled better or maybe could have
thought about in a better way or a more

885
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:37,160
beneficial way.
And then you grow and learn from that.

886
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,730
Yeah,
and it comes to the state of flux.

887
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:40,731
You know,
I'm,

888
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:45,030
I'm a different person as it was.
I was there nearly spot on a year and

889
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:48,310
I've learned more and changed and
different opinions.

890
00:40:48,311 --> 00:40:50,330
Nothing if you read anything or you
know,

891
00:40:50,331 --> 00:40:52,490
because with youtube and got the likes
of you,

892
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:55,150
you know rhonda,
patrick and about tumeric,

893
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,320
the I learned from,
from listening to you and listening to

894
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,510
people and off facebook and I got
tumeric user group because they tend to

895
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,220
cut off rights and before went to the
doctors can't do anything.

896
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,920
Just off the pipe.
Take piracy at one.

897
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,640
Your arthritis from kickboxing.
Yes.

898
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,310
Belly dancing.
Elaborate,

899
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,800
lying.
Don't be sad about dancing,

900
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,090
but I'm some whatever.
Anyway,

901
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,940
that's a real common one,
right?

902
00:41:21,941 --> 00:41:23,640
With the ankles and stuff.
Yeah.

903
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,791
And um,
I,

904
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:26,020
I just,
the doctor said,

905
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:27,730
you know,
that's it.

906
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,990
Basically you take policy elmo.

907
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,620
So put on facebook paracetamal
paracetamal.

908
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,680
Liza painkiller small.
So I just felt,

909
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:37,650
you know,
and you know,

910
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,050
you can't keep taking ibuprofen or might
be saying to jo about ibuprofen and it

911
00:41:42,051 --> 00:41:43,130
causes inflammation.
Anyway,

912
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,130
so I,
I'll put it on facebook said,

913
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,790
does anyone got an experienced
arthritis?

914
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,470
One of my friends,
lee fraser,

915
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,230
can't praise them enough to be honest.
Functionally,

916
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,060
he said he takes tumeric.
So start every search and it,

917
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,250
you'd mentioned it to joe.
We're curcumin.

918
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Curcumin is the ingredient.
So I looked on a human user group and

919
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:04,220
then they said they think about golden
paste,

920
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,850
which is tumor at black pepper and
coconut oil.

921
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,800
You cook it for seven minutes with
water,

922
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:13,060
make a paste of it.
And I mean look on facebook,

923
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,230
use a grave and you,
you,

924
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:19,450
you basically take that.
I've been taking it regularly and

925
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:21,980
there's no pain,
no pain whatsoever.

926
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,310
So it's brilliant.
It's the same information as you grind

927
00:42:25,311 --> 00:42:26,440
up the tumeric?
No.

928
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,720
You're making it in a,
in a supplement form or you're getting

929
00:42:29,721 --> 00:42:33,150
it from a route you get cheaper.
Get tumeric?

930
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:33,641
No.
yeah,

931
00:42:33,641 --> 00:42:34,720
the powder.
okay.

932
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:35,471
So you're not getting,
you know,

933
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,850
you could buy the root.
The root is real common now.

934
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:40,230
It's really interesting little pool
miracle.

935
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,103
No,
no,

936
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,370
not really shitty supermarket over
there.

937
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,820
I'm not going to slack off or anything
as a supermarket is another one.

938
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,710
Lakh it off talking rubbish.
So no,

939
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,470
the powder works and you know,
you Just don't know the actual

940
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:02,030
measurements of it.
But say it's a cup of water,

941
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:05,210
half a cup of tumeric.
You cook it for seven minutes on a low

942
00:43:05,211 --> 00:43:07,160
heat.
So it starts getting into a paste.

943
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,690
You add black pepper,
like maybe two teaspoons of it because

944
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:15,860
it's an active ingredient that makes it,
makes it 400 times more absorbable and

945
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:16,910
nobody really.

946
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:18,170
Yeah.
Wow.

947
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:20,270
Black pepper.
Pepper green.

948
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:21,730
Huh?
Man.

949
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:24,500
Why does it have to be cooked?
I don't know.

950
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,750
I'm not good with send to do.
I could try.

951
00:43:26,751 --> 00:43:27,201
Yeah.
Well,

952
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,320
how does it taste when you eat it?
No,

953
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:33,110
the best
thing is just like,

954
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,340
what would you either have pain or.
Oh,

955
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,600
that was horrible.
I'm the king of drinking disgusting

956
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:40,610
things.
I drink a lot of shitty things.

957
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,010
Um,
but he does work.

958
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,050
Tried my kale shake recipe and almost
vomited.

959
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,800
I've a friend who,
I have a friend called,

960
00:43:47,801 --> 00:43:49,880
um,
Nathan Wright and his hands.

961
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:53,390
He said he couldn't,
his hands were that bad with arthritis

962
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:57,470
that you couldn't spray deodorants and
he stunk it and that's his words,

963
00:43:57,471 --> 00:44:00,170
not mine.
And then he started taking this tumor it

964
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,260
paste and he's fine.
He says he's coming like an 80 slash 90

965
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:04,130
percent better.
I mean,

966
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:06,500
come on.
do you use fish oil and if you altered

967
00:44:06,501 --> 00:44:07,940
your diet,
may.

968
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:08,811
Yes,
yes,

969
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:11,120
I do take a lot of fish oil.
How much do you take?

970
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,990
Um,
I take two massive tablespoons of it

971
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,360
when I'm at home because I've been in
the state.

972
00:44:17,361 --> 00:44:22,361
So I thought I was taking five capsules.
We war and was taking ubiquinol,

973
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,520
coenzyme q 10,
but it is a little bit of higher level

974
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,690
one and um,
yeah,

975
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:31,070
and,
and me makes me,

976
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,240
my,
my friends now

977
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,300
orin has just got this a tumeric and
arnica tight oil type stuff.

978
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:40,050
Gone.
Three leopards,

979
00:44:40,051 --> 00:44:41,720
lemonade,
liniments that I've,

980
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:45,120
you know,
see you're going to trial and that had a

981
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:49,170
massage it yesterday.
Clear up your words or tyler intimate is

982
00:44:49,171 --> 00:44:50,100
what you're saying.
Yes.

983
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,550
Smells the same as tile.
If we explain to people with ms dot

984
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:59,290
lindemann tie fighters would use for
sore muscles and things along those

985
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:03,150
lines like wintergreen menthol and,
and stuff like that.

986
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:05,570
I don't know what tiger balm was a big
one that,

987
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,880
a bit like that,
but it's,

988
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:09,120
it's what does that stuff do?
It's very good.

989
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,480
Um,
arnica gets bruises I want to share with

990
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:15,000
you.
Don't like it gets rid of bruises.

991
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:17,690
Um,
so how does it really work at?

992
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:20,160
Well,
I've only just started using it,

993
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,190
but as far as I'm concerned,
I liked it.

994
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,450
I have a friend who's a doctor and he
told me that all that stuff like bengay

995
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:28,351
and I go,
oh,

996
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,290
that's stuff that makes me feel better.

997
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:30,630
He goeS,
he goes,

998
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:32,950
it's a topical analgesic and go,
what does that mean?

999
00:45:32,951 --> 00:45:34,050
He goes,
it makes your skin red.

1000
00:45:34,370 --> 00:45:36,750
Oh,
it makes you feel like a was happening.

1001
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:41,070
You like heat there and feels good,
but It goes in order for that stuff to

1002
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,980
absorb deeply into your system,
into your,

1003
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,080
into your,
get into your tissue.

1004
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,670
He's like,
you would have to get into your

1005
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:50,260
bloodstream and then it would be toxic.
Yeah,

1006
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,630
and I was like,
oh yeah,

1007
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,650
good.
When you take like one of those,

1008
00:45:56,070 --> 00:45:59,100
some tiger balm.
I have these patches that I'll put on,

1009
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:01,110
like if I have a muscle pull or
something like that,

1010
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:05,370
I'll put a tiger balm patch on it and it
somehow or another relaxes it in some

1011
00:46:05,371 --> 00:46:07,170
sort of a way,
but it might be psychological.

1012
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,100
Psychological are nice.
I like,

1013
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:11,640
it.
Smells nice.

1014
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,610
Normal smell,
arnica title.

1015
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:20,790
Intimate stuff your friend uses to
america's world as well.

1016
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:24,000
Yeah,
there's loads his spiel on it,

1017
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,230
you know,
and on the ball,

1018
00:46:25,231 --> 00:46:28,000
but I just want of these people,
you know,

1019
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:31,020
when I had a massage of it yesterday,
now I feel

1020
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,160
relaxed.
Will they say that most of the issues

1021
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:37,800
that people have,
whether even lIke a lot of diseases,

1022
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:42,980
the stem from inflammation and a lot of
inflammation is caused by diet.

1023
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:44,850
It's caused by,
you know,

1024
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:49,200
just eating bad food and not being
healthy into your body has this reaction

1025
00:46:49,201 --> 00:46:51,840
to this food and it's inflammatory
reaction.

1026
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:55,230
Yeah.
He said he's certainly not easy.

1027
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,480
What fleet you find out,
what gives you inflammation and what

1028
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,550
doesn't?
I don't know.

1029
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:04,580
I think most vary from person to person
and most things and you know,

1030
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:07,380
an allergy thing,
the golden pace,

1031
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,300
the tumeric thinkers were brilliant for
me.

1032
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:11,280
I can't,
I can't praise that enough.

1033
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:14,310
that's interesting.
And so how quickly did it take,

1034
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,170
like how long did it take before it was
like you were really rock solid with it.

1035
00:47:19,171 --> 00:47:22,950
We realized that this was really
beneficial for about two days.

1036
00:47:23,130 --> 00:47:24,080
Two days.
Honestly.

1037
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,640
That's incredible.
And I was,

1038
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,990
I was really working for the american
industry.

1039
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,680
I was young and you can buy this now.
I was really pissed off because the docs

1040
00:47:34,071 --> 00:47:34,751
are went,
oh,

1041
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,780
there's nothing you can do.
And sometimes you say to the doctor,

1042
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:39,880
I think I've got this,
that and the other one because they

1043
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,800
think that you're self diagnose
anything.

1044
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,693
No,
you know,

1045
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:44,370
you know,
this sort of like a,

1046
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,920
you know,
and just start.

1047
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:47,140
And I just said,
look,

1048
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,550
you know,
and she said,

1049
00:47:48,550 --> 00:47:50,260
well,
it's arthritis,

1050
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,130
you know,
you just paracetamal and I think one

1051
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,140
one.
And then when I put on facebook,

1052
00:47:56,141 --> 00:48:00,430
which is a good tool for sometimes for
getting information like the internet

1053
00:48:00,431 --> 00:48:02,860
is,
and he worked a treat and then he got

1054
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:05,320
into this group and yeah,
it was brilliant and it's worked for me

1055
00:48:05,321 --> 00:48:06,250
fantastically well.

1056
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,200
Yeah,
you have to sort of separate the

1057
00:48:08,201 --> 00:48:10,990
bullshit from the reality.
But if you can do that,

1058
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:12,790
you can definitely find a lot of stuff
online.

1059
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:17,791
And it's confusing to me when doctors
dismiss dietary solutions because very

1060
00:48:21,161 --> 00:48:24,400
few doctors are really well educated in
nutrition,

1061
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:30,180
especially educated in the understanding
of the mechanisms involved in absorbing

1062
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:36,390
nutrients and what compounds or
accentuates nutrition absorption and

1063
00:48:37,421 --> 00:48:39,410
what's beneficial.
There's so,

1064
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,270
so many doctors are just,
they,

1065
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:43,300
they,
they poo poo it because they don't

1066
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:45,190
understand that they have no knowledge
of it.

1067
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,590
Well my friend,
when he,

1068
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,140
when when he taught tumor tumeric,
it went to the doctor's and the doctor

1069
00:48:50,141 --> 00:48:50,801
was saying,
you know,

1070
00:48:50,801 --> 00:48:54,540
you can take these whatever I think it
is.

1071
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:56,500
And he said,
saved my destiny,

1072
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,110
destiny.
Any always have stopped having the.

1073
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:01,720
because he had a regular checkup.
We had gout really badly.

1074
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,100
And he went in and then.

1075
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,570
And then the doctor said,
he said,

1076
00:49:04,571 --> 00:49:06,760
I've been taking tumeric.
And he said to me,

1077
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:07,860
he said,
there's the doctor said,

1078
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,680
well our third of that,
but it's not been tested tumeric.

1079
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:11,800
And said that.
He said,

1080
00:49:11,801 --> 00:49:12,880
well,
I've heard it works,

1081
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:15,880
but it's not been tested.
So they're aware I think.

1082
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:19,750
I think there are.
I don't want to piss on docsis double

1083
00:49:19,751 --> 00:49:21,880
blind,
placebo controlled studies from any

1084
00:49:21,881 --> 00:49:25,210
major university that shows the
beneficial effects of turmeric or is it

1085
00:49:25,211 --> 00:49:27,550
just probably make any money?
Does it tumeric?

1086
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,380
What should you know?
I mean,

1087
00:49:29,381 --> 00:49:30,790
it seems like it should,
right?

1088
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:33,490
I mean,
isn't there a massive industry and

1089
00:49:33,491 --> 00:49:36,460
helping people with inflamed,
inflamed tendons?

1090
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:38,770
The problem with those things is you
can't control it.

1091
00:49:38,771 --> 00:49:40,860
Like if you do a Study on,
you know,

1092
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,000
whatever,
fill in the blank of tylenol or

1093
00:49:43,001 --> 00:49:44,950
something like that.
Someone created tylenol,

1094
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:45,430
right?

1095
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:48,550
So if you do a study on tylenol and you
so it shows its efficacy,

1096
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,970
then you could sell more of it.
But if you do a study on turmeric,

1097
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,810
I'm like,
great,

1098
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:54,280
glad.
Thanks for funding this study.

1099
00:49:54,281 --> 00:49:57,130
I'm going to go sell it now and I'm
going to point to your study and I'm

1100
00:49:57,131 --> 00:50:00,160
going to make a ton of money off of your
study and I can just grow it in my

1101
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,600
backyard.
I mean that's,

1102
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:05,290
that's the problem with marijuana.
The plan is a problem with any sort of

1103
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:06,970
spin.
It's a survey.

1104
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:11,030
It's like 100 people surveyed.
I've never been asked about,

1105
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:15,520
we're not talking about surveys,
we're talking about double blind placebo

1106
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:18,820
controlled studies on information.
If they did something along those lines,

1107
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:24,210
like one of the big issues that's going
on with medical marijuana is the

1108
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,220
pushback from pharmaceutical companies
that are trying to stop medical

1109
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:33,220
marijuana from becoming legal nationwide
and they they've halted at least delayed

1110
00:50:33,921 --> 00:50:38,750
this supreme court's changing of the
designation from a schedule one to

1111
00:50:38,751 --> 00:50:42,590
schedule two in this country.
Schedule one shows no medicinal value

1112
00:50:42,591 --> 00:50:44,270
whatsoever.
That's where marijuana is.

1113
00:50:44,271 --> 00:50:47,610
Meanwhile,
marijuana is passed as a medical

1114
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:50,570
supplement in,
I don't know how many states now.

1115
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:54,320
I think it's like 20 and it's legal in
four or five states now.

1116
00:50:54,321 --> 00:50:56,870
It's legal in Washington dc.
It's legal in Colorado.

1117
00:50:56,871 --> 00:51:01,100
It's legal in Washington state.
It's legal in Oregon just

1118
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:04,730
recreationally,
so it's obviously there is some benefit

1119
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:08,540
of it medically if all these doctors are
prescribing and it shows massive

1120
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:13,541
reduction in tumors with the use of cbd,
it helps control pain simpson oil.

1121
00:51:14,330 --> 00:51:15,111
Yes.
Yeah.

1122
00:51:15,111 --> 00:51:18,260
I mean,
it's incredible how much benefit there

1123
00:51:18,261 --> 00:51:21,260
is in this one plant,
but yet the pushback from the

1124
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:25,100
pharmaceutical industry is still
incredibly strong because they don't.

1125
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:29,030
I posted something really recently how
much money.

1126
00:51:29,031 --> 00:51:32,030
The pharmaceutical.
There was a chart that showed how much

1127
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:35,720
money the pharmaceutical industry stands
to lose.

1128
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:40,160
If medical cannabis is made legal
nationwide and readily available,

1129
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:43,910
it's billions of dollars every year
they're going to lose because all these

1130
00:51:43,911 --> 00:51:46,460
solutions that they offer,
there's better,

1131
00:51:46,461 --> 00:51:50,330
simpler,
simpler and far cheaper solutions with

1132
00:51:50,331 --> 00:51:52,640
cannabis,
especially because it's one of the

1133
00:51:52,641 --> 00:51:55,580
easiest things to grow.
I mean a lot of people grow their own

1134
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:57,410
tomatoes in their backyard and things
like that.

1135
00:51:57,411 --> 00:51:59,570
Like pot.
All you do is plant it,

1136
00:51:59,571 --> 00:52:00,980
throw some water on it.
It's done.

1137
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,790
Not in england.
In england,

1138
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:05,430
they won't grow unless you got.
Well,

1139
00:52:05,431 --> 00:52:10,110
I don't know why.
It's not the best weather of way.

1140
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:12,330
You know what I mean?
I guarantee you we'd will grow in

1141
00:52:12,331 --> 00:52:17,331
england to try and some some lights and
let's try it and film it live and let

1142
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,010
live.
How illegal illegal is.

1143
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:28,070
Pot and in england you can get.
You can get arrested.

1144
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,220
He can.
I don't know.

1145
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,890
I'm not very good with it being
dangerous.

1146
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,140
Meanwhile,
nobody's drunk and I've never seen more

1147
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:35,610
drunk.
People say,

1148
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,620
god damn you.
People love to drink.

1149
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,750
It's hilarious,
but you're good at it.

1150
00:52:39,751 --> 00:52:44,100
That's what I'm looking for.
Way better at being drunk.

1151
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:46,200
Yeah.
I think I'm rubbish at drinking.

1152
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:47,610
I'm.
Oh god,

1153
00:52:47,611 --> 00:52:49,110
yeah.
Oh yeah.

1154
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,390
When I start crying,
cry,

1155
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,990
sing,
dance hall.

1156
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,210
Just
memory loss,

1157
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,520
you know,
the usual,

1158
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,260
the usual stuff that.
But you know,

1159
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:05,490
I don't know with cannabis in it,
I don't take it,

1160
00:53:05,491 --> 00:53:07,920
but I mean to see what's going on.
I think belief,

1161
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,170
I believe that there's a cure for
everything on the planet.

1162
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:13,050
I think we've,
we these loads of stuff that we haven't

1163
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:19,530
explored that the mind as well.
Just stuff to explore yet the mind is a

1164
00:53:19,531 --> 00:53:24,330
fascinating solution to a lot of issues
that people have and sinking positive or

1165
00:53:24,331 --> 00:53:25,980
thinking negative or worry

1166
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,140
and the stress.
And we were talking earlier about

1167
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:33,141
cortisol and the stress response to
literally thinking about something

1168
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:37,710
affects your physical health and
thinking about things in the wrong way.

1169
00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:39,630
Affects your physical health.
Yeah,

1170
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,080
and when we got we got,
I think we got more things to worry

1171
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:45,240
about.
I think we've got more things to worry

1172
00:53:45,241 --> 00:53:47,010
about now,
but they're actually not anything to

1173
00:53:47,011 --> 00:53:48,960
worry about.
Does that make sense?

1174
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,070
When you look at facebook and you get
model,

1175
00:53:51,071 --> 00:53:55,280
the someone's fucking idiot,
trump supporter healthier,

1176
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:58,440
you don't know anything about that and
you start typing something while I'm

1177
00:53:58,450 --> 00:54:00,090
doing that.
When you get involved in something or

1178
00:54:00,091 --> 00:54:02,130
you get angry about something,
I do it,

1179
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,570
you know,
I'm not going to lie and they,

1180
00:54:03,571 --> 00:54:08,400
you think to yourself fucking medu in
years ago when you and the caveman was

1181
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:11,960
only worried about if they're going to
get somethings going to eat them all,

1182
00:54:11,961 --> 00:54:15,180
they've got something and I think that
might have been easier.

1183
00:54:15,181 --> 00:54:17,190
Of course he died of diseases and he
died,

1184
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:20,610
may have died younger to whatever,
but I mean they lived the mall and

1185
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:25,050
easeful life now facebook though.
So didn't even,

1186
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:28,230
didn't have anything to look and they
didn't have comments on youtube.

1187
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,680
Like John Wayne Powell was saying he was
gay.

1188
00:54:30,681 --> 00:54:31,770
He gets mad.
Yeah.

1189
00:54:31,771 --> 00:54:34,440
But I mean I just,
I call it the same.

1190
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,530
I got almost,
I was cold virus all for game of

1191
00:54:37,531 --> 00:54:40,710
thrones,
which I was quite pleased about it.

1192
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:41,521
I was like,
oh,

1193
00:54:41,521 --> 00:54:44,520
I'll take lord various little penis.
Nothing wrong with that.

1194
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,211
No,
I know,

1195
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:46,320
but I just think,
you know,

1196
00:54:46,321 --> 00:54:50,220
I don't get it.
Things don't guys don't get haters.

1197
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:51,730
I don't understand them,

1198
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,790
but don't you though,
because when we were talking about all

1199
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:58,390
these different things that happen in
life that sort of set you up for the

1200
00:54:58,391 --> 00:55:03,391
next stages of life and define you and
sort of alter and affect your decision

1201
00:55:04,931 --> 00:55:07,420
making process and your behavior
process,

1202
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,920
don't you think that a lot of these
people just live very unfortunate

1203
00:55:12,921 --> 00:55:17,921
existences and whether it's by chance or
whether it's by bad decision making that

1204
00:55:19,841 --> 00:55:22,240
has just compounded itself over the
years.

1205
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,150
When you see some of the hateful things
that people posted about,

1206
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,400
let's say john wayne parr,
who's the nicest guy,

1207
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:31,570
brilliant guy and multiple time world
champion.

1208
00:55:31,571 --> 00:55:32,950
Incredibly complex,
nice.

1209
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,230
His kids a great,
fantastic as kids.

1210
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,070
So cool.
By the way,

1211
00:55:36,071 --> 00:55:37,930
there's a video of his kid hitting the
pads.

1212
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,350
you want to see something impressive.
His kid is fighting.

1213
00:55:41,351 --> 00:55:44,020
I think she's fighting on the 20th,
20th,

1214
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:48,490
jasmine and jazzy and he sent me this
video of her hitting the pads.

1215
00:55:48,491 --> 00:55:49,500
You know,
like a whole,

1216
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,930
you know,
the son can do flips.

1217
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,760
Oh yeah.
Your family.

1218
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,700
They're pretty incredible.
His wife was a fighter.

1219
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,540
Well that's.
I went and stayed with them.

1220
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:03,510
They went to that show and not listen
nothing but respect for john wayne pies.

1221
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:06,080
A lovely guy.
And he's got a great sense of humor as

1222
00:56:06,081 --> 00:56:06,800
well,
you know,

1223
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,940
don't take themselves too seriously.

1224
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,130
I know he's very self deprecating.
he's very aware of how good he is,

1225
00:56:12,131 --> 00:56:14,500
but he's also very self deprecating.
Like,

1226
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:16,150
watch this.
Let's watch this video.

1227
00:56:16,151 --> 00:56:16,984
This is her.

1228
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,790
Nope.
What happened?

1229
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,453
What'd you

1230
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,710
change the screens?
Your computer fail

1231
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,150
Thailand.
And this girl's like,

1232
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,370
what is she 10,
something like that.

1233
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,140
Jimmy in Australia.

1234
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:47,910
Oh,
there's another one.

1235
00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:49,740
There's one that I looked at.
There was different.

1236
00:56:49,741 --> 00:56:50,880
It was on youtube.
Oh,

1237
00:56:50,881 --> 00:56:52,110
she's 13 years old.
Okay.

1238
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,870
But my point is,
you know,

1239
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:58,320
there's people that hate on this guy and
they,

1240
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,330
they're not.
Well no,

1241
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:03,480
like they're not happy.
They're not looking at him going,

1242
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:06,630
you fucking loser.
They don't like finding a reason why

1243
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,940
he's there.
Just trying to find a reason.

1244
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:11,140
I got it.
I got one about math.

1245
00:57:11,230 --> 00:57:14,640
A pest say nobody knows nothing slip.
When did you get this?

1246
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:16,470
Just one of the comments,
you know,

1247
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,880
and I was just like.
And he was like,

1248
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:19,560
yeah,
you know nothing about hypnosis,

1249
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:20,341
right?
Well,

1250
00:57:20,341 --> 00:57:24,570
I'm here and your salary,
he doesn't mean to mean you know

1251
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,480
nothing.
You know nothing about derren brown a

1252
00:57:27,481 --> 00:57:28,920
lot.
I've only been to see him three times.

1253
00:57:28,921 --> 00:57:32,610
I had all thEse books and he's amazing,
amazing guy and I know that,

1254
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:33,480
you know what I mean?

1255
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,820
But he just,
just thinking you'll get whatever you

1256
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:36,810
get,
whatever you do.

1257
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:41,580
I deem this like,
I think joe joe chilean said jesus was

1258
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,210
great.
It invite him to a party.

1259
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,240
You could turn this water into wine.
He could.

1260
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:46,260
Hey,
you grabbed that dad,

1261
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:48,170
don't worry,
we'll bring you butts alive.

1262
00:57:48,370 --> 00:57:49,810
You broke your leg a.
Yeah,

1263
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:50,730
go.
You know,

1264
00:57:50,731 --> 00:57:53,160
we'll go fishing and catch all the fish.
It was a great guy.

1265
00:57:53,190 --> 00:57:55,560
He's still killed him.
YOu know you're going to get,

1266
00:57:55,561 --> 00:57:58,950
people are going to hate you just
because it's more about latin than

1267
00:57:58,951 --> 00:58:01,200
isabel.
Here it is more about the news about

1268
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:02,220
you.
That is a.

1269
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:06,960
That's a big factor with online
interaction with people where you are.

1270
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:11,130
What you're doing is you're interacting
with their own paths and their own

1271
00:58:11,131 --> 00:58:16,131
failures and the vast majority of people
in this life are not living fulfilled

1272
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,920
and happy existence of faceless
assassins huntley.

1273
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,950
The faceless assassins really like
snipers of nothingness.

1274
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:26,070
Oh,
you mean commenters?

1275
00:58:26,071 --> 00:58:27,840
Yeah,
but they're not really faceless.

1276
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:29,280
Right?
Like at the end of the day,

1277
00:58:29,281 --> 00:58:32,580
if you get to who they really are and
what's really bothering them,

1278
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,730
they're no different than you or I.
They just.

1279
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,100
They got a fucked up start in this life
and they never recovered.

1280
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,250
That's what most of it is extending into
me.

1281
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,510
No,
I've always been like this.

1282
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:48,150
There's a whole video.
I did a on youtube and be the hero of

1283
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:49,800
your own movie scene.
It's very good.

1284
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:54,120
If you were in a movie and the movie
started right now and you're a fucking

1285
00:58:54,121 --> 00:58:55,770
failure,
just think about where your life's at.

1286
00:58:55,860 --> 00:58:57,570
What would the hero do?
What would you do?

1287
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,550
Address one?
No,

1288
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,760
my friend warren brown.
What should they yourself,

1289
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:05,180
but he's on a tv show called.
Did they make him double seven?

1290
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,220
A lot of white people freaking out
catalogs.

1291
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:10,710
he has bought martini.
Shaken,

1292
00:59:10,711 --> 00:59:12,150
not stirred.
Don't care what color he is,

1293
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,530
but he was a.
Wore a knee,

1294
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,270
worked for them,
and he's doing a show now for discovery

1295
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,250
and he's training to be a kickboxer.
He's gonna have a fight.

1296
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,230
It just says he's gonna fight.
Yeah.

1297
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:23,840
Who's he fighting?
I don't know.

1298
00:59:23,841 --> 00:59:24,640
Yeah.
How old is he?

1299
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,300
He's,
I think he's 42.

1300
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:29,330
He's gonna.
Have his first ever kickbox and my

1301
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:32,960
friend karen kettle,
he's training each training and they've

1302
00:59:32,961 --> 00:59:34,400
been all over it.
It's a show with discovery.

1303
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:37,600
Was meant to be on it and be the mind
coach for the show that.

1304
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,860
is there any video of him training?
Not yet.

1305
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,110
Not yet.
Can find some.

1306
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,740
Jim warren warren who was on the show
with him.

1307
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,010
Oh right.
Not yet.

1308
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:49,493
Sorry.

1309
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:53,333
Oh,
jesus.

1310
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:55,740
Daniel.
Sam as well from england.

1311
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:02,130
Not bad stuff.
It's hard to say,

1312
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:02,993
oh,
it's terrible.

1313
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:07,090
Someone's going to tell him to keep his
fucking hands up.

1314
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:10,960
Look at his kicks though.
Not too bad.

1315
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:13,090
Not too bad.
If you stand right in front of him,

1316
01:00:13,091 --> 01:00:17,040
will fuck you up your game.
Now he's getting.

1317
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:20,710
He's got to be.
If he's actually going to have a fight

1318
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,980
and he's gay.
God,

1319
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,330
he's so off balance though,
right when I say that he falls.

1320
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,790
It's like you're watching it's
fundamentals.

1321
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:31,810
It's almost like he really shouldn't be
hitting pads here.

1322
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:34,630
If I was coaching the garlic that I
would tell him,

1323
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,680
all I want you to do is touch these
things over five years old,

1324
01:00:37,681 --> 01:00:39,560
five years old,
so he's gotten better.

1325
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,030
Well,
hey man,

1326
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:46,090
that's really good.
Then if that's five years ago and he's

1327
01:00:46,091 --> 01:00:49,870
been steady at it since then,
that's really good because he's got some

1328
01:00:49,871 --> 01:00:53,080
basic movements down the waste,
throwing his weight into things.

1329
01:00:53,081 --> 01:00:54,690
He just,
you know,

1330
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:57,280
tried.
You guys tried to hit things hard before

1331
01:00:57,281 --> 01:00:58,114
they learn how to hit,

1332
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,300
right?
Correct.

1333
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,700
Yeah,
because his friend who was in it in

1334
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:05,990
luther,
that the other detective was warren

1335
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:07,250
brown.
He's my mate,

1336
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,590
my friend.
He wants two world titles in thai

1337
01:01:09,591 --> 01:01:12,410
boxing,
so I think they'd been talking about in

1338
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:14,240
warren's been helping him and karen.
Karen's been helping him,

1339
01:01:14,241 --> 01:01:17,510
but it should be a good show because you
see all of them seem train in and

1340
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:21,360
between movies like is made when we
spielberg the dark tower or something

1341
01:01:21,361 --> 01:01:23,480
with where's he going to fight?
I don't know.

1342
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,030
Maybe in Thailand,
Thailand and I think going deep.

1343
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,610
I know you got to give him respect
rules.

1344
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:35,370
The whole.
I think he's fighting k one rules which

1345
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:40,410
dumps are easier to get elbowed in the
face and of clench and all.

1346
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,920
I saw business,
but you've got to give.

1347
01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:45,200
Given respect to like that.
I don't like the way he's testing

1348
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:49,160
himself,
but he did a video on youtube about life

1349
01:01:49,161 --> 01:01:51,780
and that now he envisioned himself doing
this something new.

1350
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,200
I really like that.
I was going to take what I weren't part

1351
01:01:54,201 --> 01:01:55,960
of the show.
I really wanted to do that.

1352
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:57,770
I.
I was gutted,

1353
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:00,740
gutted
word you just said.

1354
01:02:03,570 --> 01:02:05,510
What did you say?
It's part and parcel.

1355
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:08,810
That's what I kept saying last time I
was a upset guilted.

1356
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:13,040
You were upset because I went,
what was it was going to be part of the

1357
01:02:13,041 --> 01:02:15,520
show is a mind coach,
you know,

1358
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,050
because fighters have coaches now.
But anyway,

1359
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,100
logistically didn't and stuff like that,

1360
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,490
but I mean I wish him all the best and
karen and everyone on the show,

1361
01:02:23,491 --> 01:02:24,990
it would be brilliant.
So who's coachIng him?

1362
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,430
Kiran kettle.
Oh,

1363
01:02:26,431 --> 01:02:29,090
from csa know karen.
Korean.

1364
01:02:29,230 --> 01:02:30,300
Okay.
Karen.

1365
01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:35,350
Karen cattle east from england.
Kurian from csa is a irish gentleman,

1366
01:02:36,451 --> 01:02:39,480
right?
What is his last syrian he's carrying?

1367
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,680
Carrying.
I don't know.

1368
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,550
I forget his last name was.
He thinks gibbons?

1369
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:45,540
Yeah.
Fitsgibbons.

1370
01:02:45,541 --> 01:02:46,261
Yeah.
He's a good coach.

1371
01:02:46,261 --> 01:02:47,560
He coaches.
Aila doesn't eat.

1372
01:02:47,561 --> 01:02:50,990
And um,
Kevin Ross has a good culture in gust on

1373
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,940
bellarmine.
Yeah.

1374
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,870
Very good.
Have you seen the fight between

1375
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,760
mohammed,
uriah in northern venmo?

1376
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,380
No.
Can you flush your right now if we just

1377
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:05,050
spell it out?
A curator isj a r a y aj

1378
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:12,610
a r a y a v ben meaux,
b a n m o h he's only just watched the

1379
01:03:14,761 --> 01:03:16,120
third round at his face.

1380
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:20,610
He didn't get a word that I could tell.
I spelled it out slowly.

1381
01:03:20,910 --> 01:03:25,910
J a r a y a versus bevmo b e n m o hate.
I'm writing it with my finger.

1382
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:33,410
Oh,
what'd you say?

1383
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:34,463
Yeah,
the moroccan.

1384
01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:37,710
Did you say h or h?
Why say hey?

1385
01:03:37,711 --> 01:03:41,030
change.
Because it's how you go see each.

1386
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:42,030
Yeah.
Hates,

1387
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:45,150
hates you guys do that too with z.
Say zed.

1388
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:45,960
Yeah,
we do.

1389
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,250
What the fuck is that?
We do.

1390
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,180
I don't know why.
How did it get abandoned?

1391
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:55,140
Sydney to industry to keep up like this
seems to be some disconnect between some

1392
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:57,720
of the words like tires you guys use or
why?

1393
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:02,370
And color with no view.
And we uncover what the fuck is that

1394
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,730
about?
do you have extra hughes lane or just.

1395
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:05,850
Yeah,
we just felt fro.

1396
01:04:05,851 --> 01:04:10,200
They said why?
Why is tired t y r e golf august.

1397
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:11,850
Who invented tires?
I think we did.

1398
01:04:11,851 --> 01:04:14,380
So you might want to fuck off.
Go now.

1399
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:17,370
So,
uh,

1400
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:21,480
what do you want me to see about this?
One of the best kickboxing fights I've

1401
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,890
ever seen in my life.
Really?

1402
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:27,230
Absolutely ridiculous.
It was a last year on infusion.

1403
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,210
Much common sense on.
I work for these,

1404
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,000
but these two knock the proverbial holes
out of each other.

1405
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:36,780
May 27th of March.
March 27th,

1406
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:38,003
27th.
Okay.

1407
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:39,750
What does mch is that saying?
Oh,

1408
01:04:39,751 --> 01:04:40,620
it's the.
Okay,

1409
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:43,400
I see what you're saying.
So in round,

1410
01:04:43,410 --> 01:04:46,930
just put round three on.
He got an end with fusion is with an e

1411
01:04:46,931 --> 01:04:51,150
folks.
E n s u s I o n is a moitai

1412
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,280
organization.
Yes.

1413
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,323
In european?
Yeah.

1414
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:54,910
In holland.
Yeah.

1415
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:59,920
And they do in a 200,000 euro tournament
in september the 17th.

1416
01:05:00,511 --> 01:05:04,890
But this kid to rise 19
and uh,

1417
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:09,840
it's,
it's absolutely ridiculous fight.

1418
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:10,920
Wow.
Okay,

1419
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,020
I'll check it out.
I'll check it out.

1420
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:16,080
I'm a obviously a big fan of kickboxing
and I'm,

1421
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:18,140
uh,
I'm super psyched that gloria is going

1422
01:05:18,141 --> 01:05:22,510
to put on badr hari versus rico
verhoeven if bought her heart,

1423
01:05:22,511 --> 01:05:25,000
gets out of jail in jail.

1424
01:05:25,470 --> 01:05:26,840
He's not in jail,
at least not right now.

1425
01:05:27,970 --> 01:05:30,220
But there's a long time between now and
december.

1426
01:05:30,430 --> 01:05:33,130
We'll see a cute.
He makes.

1427
01:05:33,190 --> 01:05:36,250
He makes John Jones look like a fucking
choirboy true.

1428
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:39,760
Doesn't mean we here.
We just say,

1429
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,620
oh,
it's an interesting fight.

1430
01:05:41,621 --> 01:05:43,210
I mean,
for sure barter can win,

1431
01:05:43,211 --> 01:05:44,350
for sure.
Rico can win.

1432
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:47,530
Rico's been much more active reach.
Ricoh has incredible cardio.

1433
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:51,400
If you go to the bar,
hurry that beat alistair overeem in the

1434
01:05:51,401 --> 01:05:52,510
rematch,
you know,

1435
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:56,620
you go to that bot or the bot or who was
in his peak mean bought her was a

1436
01:05:56,621 --> 01:05:59,710
monster,
but it's been a long time and he's not

1437
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:01,600
been very active over the last few
years.

1438
01:06:01,601 --> 01:06:03,940
And he said,
what's up?

1439
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:06,100
Switch on.
It's which wateR turns up.

1440
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:09,910
But it's also like all of the legal
issues that he's gone through.

1441
01:06:09,911 --> 01:06:10,740
All the,
the,

1442
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:13,900
the,
the behavioral issues.

1443
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:18,370
I mean he's had a lot of problems,
allegedly broke some guy's leg and a

1444
01:06:18,430 --> 01:06:19,210
nightclub.

1445
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:23,140
They say it held the guy down,
stomped his shin and smashed his leg.

1446
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:26,680
That's crazy shit man.
And who knows?

1447
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:28,690
Who knows,
who knows what the fuck is going on with

1448
01:06:28,691 --> 01:06:32,470
that dude?
I'm know his mom and dad and that real

1449
01:06:32,471 --> 01:06:34,390
nice people.
He's a nice guy and still full.

1450
01:06:34,510 --> 01:06:37,360
You know,
fathers probably the most exciting

1451
01:06:37,361 --> 01:06:39,550
heavyweight.
And he's a wild man.

1452
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:43,270
He's a fucking wild man and he's legit
knockout power.

1453
01:06:43,271 --> 01:06:47,050
And the other thing is he throws caution
literally to the wind.

1454
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,070
I mean,
he,

1455
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,610
he unloads with full power shots,
wade's forward,

1456
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:52,900
throws,
bombs,

1457
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:57,460
like he throws out all ideas of like
being technical and being,

1458
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:01,360
um,
being really cautious and like setting

1459
01:07:01,361 --> 01:07:03,100
traps.
He's not setting traps.

1460
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,990
He's dropping missiles on you.
It gets to them and say,

1461
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:09,490
I've heard that if a froze up,
I don't think he'd get nervous that he

1462
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:11,710
throws up,
throws up for the fight,

1463
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:12,450
gets ready.

1464
01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:16,180
so none of this makes sense.
If you see the way he fights fights,

1465
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:18,770
like it's fucking case.
It doesn't,

1466
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,870
you know,
if somebody killed somebody he loves,

1467
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,530
that's fights.
He fights like a wilD man,

1468
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,650
but it's so exciting.
But rico is a different kind of fighter.

1469
01:07:26,651 --> 01:07:31,360
Rico is a very athletic,
big heavyweight who is a amazing cardio

1470
01:07:31,750 --> 01:07:34,780
outstanding technique.
His boxing is outstanding.

1471
01:07:34,781 --> 01:07:37,060
His kickboxing was outstanding.
Huge,

1472
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:42,040
huge guy.
He's a natural to 30 to 50 plus and he's

1473
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:44,540
in incredible shape.
There's bought her.

1474
01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:49,890
The thing about this is the glory of
preview videos to highlight that they're

1475
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:53,230
putting on pretty sure.
The thing about rico is that ricoh has

1476
01:07:53,231 --> 01:07:56,800
been super active while bought,
has been dealing with all these problems

1477
01:07:56,801 --> 01:08:00,820
and rico's has been getting better and
rico's been beating guys that,

1478
01:08:01,150 --> 01:08:03,610
you know,
he had some problems with some guys in

1479
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:08,140
the past and you see him now and he's
just a much better fighter in every

1480
01:08:08,141 --> 01:08:09,460
shape way,
shape or form.

1481
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:10,511
Yeah.
When he fell out,

1482
01:08:10,511 --> 01:08:12,280
benjamIn accountability fall numbers.
Really.

1483
01:08:12,281 --> 01:08:14,500
I mean you spent.
It was sparring with ties and fuel or it

1484
01:08:14,501 --> 01:08:18,610
wasn't a good an old decent heavyweights
and beat and daniel geeta who's good.

1485
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:21,470
Daniel geeta farts a good example
because they had fought before and it

1486
01:08:21,471 --> 01:08:24,500
was a very close fight,
but in the rematch it was not close at

1487
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:26,060
all.
Ricoh kinda ran away with it.

1488
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:31,250
Rico's on another level right now,
but the thIng about baader is like when

1489
01:08:31,251 --> 01:08:35,750
he was at his best and you kind of got
to assume that it's possible that he

1490
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:38,750
could go back to how he was when he was
at his best.

1491
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:42,950
When he went bought or was at his best.
He was a fucking hurricane in there.

1492
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,720
He was.
I remember that.

1493
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:46,400
I've seen,
I've seen him because he fought a lot on

1494
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:51,050
it.
Shell time and the moroccans absolutely

1495
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:53,900
love him,
but a bit light geria amateur writers

1496
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,030
coming right now and les ballet,
they loved them.

1497
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,300
Who was it that he stomped in the head?
Remy bone

1498
01:09:00,090 --> 01:09:03,590
gag is when he was on the floor.
Yeah,

1499
01:09:03,591 --> 01:09:05,240
he got disqualified for that one,
right?

1500
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:05,931
Uh,
yeah,

1501
01:09:05,931 --> 01:09:09,680
I got disqualified for both the whole
thing to a bunch with a little bit like

1502
01:09:09,681 --> 01:09:11,660
he was kinda like acting it up a little
bit.

1503
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:13,610
I'm saying nothing.
I have to go to holland.

1504
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:19,450
You're saying nothing
smart on his part.

1505
01:09:19,641 --> 01:09:22,670
Like listen to the fights over if I just
lay here for the moment.

1506
01:09:22,850 --> 01:09:26,750
Yeah.
It just seemed a little like this guy

1507
01:09:26,751 --> 01:09:29,470
who's been beaten up his entire career
and you know,

1508
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,650
taking amazing shots.
All of a sudden one kick when he's down

1509
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:36,050
and he just decided like,
here it is right here.

1510
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:40,150
That one kick.
That was it.

1511
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,800
It can't go on.
No way.

1512
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:43,903
Right.
I mean,

1513
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:47,540
it wasn't a nice thing that he did.
It certainly is grounds for

1514
01:09:47,541 --> 01:09:52,310
disqualification.
But to see him rolling around on the

1515
01:09:52,311 --> 01:09:53,360
ground,
like he can't,

1516
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:56,300
he can't function anymore.
I'm like,

1517
01:09:56,301 --> 01:09:57,050
oh,
okay.

1518
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:00,340
It has to get swelling was worse.
He did when he was on the floor.

1519
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:02,090
Well,
he's fucking crazy.

1520
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:03,500
Why is he,
why is he like that?

1521
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:04,560
Does anybody know?
Don't know.

1522
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:06,390
I just think he's great.
He said,

1523
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,130
nice if me.
It was really,

1524
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,600
really nice with me and I'm like,
well,

1525
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,650
he's all about.
We make out of cross date.

1526
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:15,990
Yeah,
he's just the wrong guy.

1527
01:10:15,991 --> 01:10:17,570
Of course you don't want to fuck wIth
badr.

1528
01:10:17,571 --> 01:10:20,480
Hari is.
He's a dangerous,

1529
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:22,400
dangerous man.
So if you want to do this technique,

1530
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:26,630
so what is it you want to.
So basically eight sites,

1531
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:27,800
it's a calming technique.

1532
01:10:27,930 --> 01:10:28,491
Okay.
Yeah,

1533
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,370
we were about to do this earlier.
We got so distracted to carry on.

1534
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:33,380
You're going to tell people in their
cars to be careful.

1535
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:35,900
Don't please don't do this while you're
driving.

1536
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:40,640
What are we doing here?
And you're using a machinery or anything

1537
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:43,090
dangerous.
She wAs still just unsure.

1538
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:48,160
A basic technique is a submodality move.
So you sort of sub modalities.

1539
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:51,230
Let's go with something that's going on
in the background.

1540
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:52,580
Um,
so it just,

1541
01:10:52,670 --> 01:10:55,100
it just calms you down so people can use
it for,

1542
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:59,180
I don't know,
before training or stressful day or

1543
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:00,170
whatever they want to do.
Well,

1544
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,350
after a stressful day,
lunches,

1545
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:04,040
you know,
get some time to sleep or whatever.

1546
01:11:04,450 --> 01:11:09,450
So self hypnosis technique correctly,
I'm not allowed to share with you.

1547
01:11:09,771 --> 01:11:10,490
Yeah,
please.

1548
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:12,200
Okay.
So I'm trying to step back a bit.

1549
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:14,110
so

1550
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:14,943
sit back.
Okay.

1551
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:20,040
What I want you to do is find a
comfortable chair or you can on your bed

1552
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,330
or whatever,
and you while you listen to this,

1553
01:11:21,331 --> 01:11:24,090
and I want you to yourself just close
your eyes a moment.

1554
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:27,450
I want you to imagine that your in a
room,

1555
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:34,310
this room can be an equally you wish and
in front of you as a window,

1556
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,610
the window was slightly open.
I want you to move towards that window

1557
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,050
as you go towards that window.
I want you to imagine outside that is

1558
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:46,890
traffic,
bumper to bumper cars,

1559
01:11:47,620 --> 01:11:49,660
traffic.
When we know what traffic causes,

1560
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:50,850
when you're in a traffic jam,
you know,

1561
01:11:50,851 --> 01:11:54,540
in them situations.
I also want you imagine that there's a

1562
01:11:54,541 --> 01:11:59,190
dog running around and barking a really
big dog and making lots of noise.

1563
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:05,040
There's also a modern woman arguing in
the street and I've been a blazing raul

1564
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:09,160
the window next door of the house,
the 11.

1565
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:14,410
They're blaring out really loud music.
There's also a group of schoolchildren

1566
01:12:14,610 --> 01:12:17,940
coming from,
but from school I'm making noise.

1567
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,510
I want you to notice what you notice
here,

1568
01:12:21,511 --> 01:12:23,400
what you hear,
and feel what you feel about the

1569
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:25,350
situation.
With the window open.

1570
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:31,140
Now I want you to start moving Backwards
further and further away from the window

1571
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:36,890
so the window gets smaller and smaller
as you move really,

1572
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:42,381
really bad from the window I went to
allow that window's smaller and smaller

1573
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:46,860
as you go.
Really wary away from the window,

1574
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,780
so wIndows really,
really small.

1575
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,840
I want you to walk out that room and
closed the door

1576
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:54,763
and just be.

1577
01:12:58,190 --> 01:13:01,260
I'm not saying
does it?

1578
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:02,110
Yes.

1579
01:13:02,110 --> 01:13:04,800
Skin away from the window.
Get away from that window so that she

1580
01:13:04,801 --> 01:13:06,640
could make a bumper sticker.
Get away from the window.

1581
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:10,580
He's just so you just so you just
withdraw it away from the window all the

1582
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,150
way from chaos and just quIet and
yourself down.

1583
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:16,690
So now using that as a,
a tool,

1584
01:13:16,720 --> 01:13:19,840
like how would want implement that in
their life like that sort of a.

1585
01:13:19,970 --> 01:13:22,250
So these,
these loads of different ways of,

1586
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:27,430
of induction into hypnosis is the,
is zillow two different ways with that.

1587
01:13:28,861 --> 01:13:30,710
I just,
I just like it personally,

1588
01:13:31,190 --> 01:13:36,190
learn off a lady called dolores ashcroft
whiskey and just move away from things

1589
01:13:37,101 --> 01:13:39,890
that are going on and just give yourself
like just even a few minutes of just

1590
01:13:40,010 --> 01:13:41,030
quiet.
And when you,

1591
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,610
when you shut down,
you shut the door and he'd just be,

1592
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:46,820
you can just imagine yourself sitting
and then you can start using your

1593
01:13:46,821 --> 01:13:51,620
breathing techniques or just allowing
yourself to just sit just for a few

1594
01:13:51,620 --> 01:13:53,570
minutes and see.
See what comes up for you.

1595
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,060
See how calm he can.

1596
01:13:56,530 --> 01:14:00,340
We were talking about something before
the podcast that I wanted to talk to you

1597
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:01,174
about.
Okay.

1598
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:02,250
Uh,
in,

1599
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:04,180
in,
in relationship to archery.

1600
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:09,310
and that there is a thing that happens
in archery called target panic.

1601
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,010
And what target panic is people

1602
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:17,010
that in the moment they start freaking
out and they can't stay calm and they

1603
01:14:17,441 --> 01:14:19,270
can't they.
What they do is they.

1604
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:23,200
They try to get that pin,
like when when you're shooting a bow

1605
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:28,630
that you have a site and on that site
has a pin and the pin is it's.

1606
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:35,070
It's set up to where whatever yardage
you're trying to shoot at and your boat

1607
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,660
gets cited in and once your boa is cited
In,

1608
01:14:37,661 --> 01:14:42,661
you can kind of dial your scope to or
your your site to like 20 yards,

1609
01:14:42,851 --> 01:14:43,990
30 yards,
40 yards.

1610
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:48,880
And what happens is people put that pin
on the target,

1611
01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:51,630
whether it's at a competition or whether
it's bowhunting,

1612
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:54,940
whatever it is,
you put that pin on a target and the

1613
01:14:54,941 --> 01:14:58,140
moment that's on the target,
you start freaking out because the,

1614
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:02,290
the moment that this all is going down
is happening soon.

1615
01:15:02,470 --> 01:15:05,500
And people hammer that trigger on the
hammer that trigger,

1616
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:09,130
they jerked the pin offline,
they don't stay still.

1617
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:13,150
They panic.
And this target panic causes bad shots.

1618
01:15:13,990 --> 01:15:18,340
And you introduced me to this idea
called hakalau.

1619
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:21,100
Hakalau explained to me,

1620
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:22,750
hello,
how can I always.

1621
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:27,040
I'm from a belief system from Hawaii
called huna eisa.

1622
01:15:27,070 --> 01:15:31,900
It's a hypnotic state and I'm nauseous
all the time in driving,

1623
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,760
watching tv,
as we said earlier,

1624
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:36,300
when you drive and you don't even
realize how you got home,

1625
01:15:36,350 --> 01:15:38,010
you just on autopilot,
right?

1626
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,940
Yes.
He just kept no goget.

1627
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:40,931
No,
that's the word.

1628
01:15:40,931 --> 01:15:42,180
Yes.
And um,

1629
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:45,310
he's driving it now.
She's basically so huck allow spelling,

1630
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:46,840
hakalau,
h a,

1631
01:15:46,900 --> 01:15:48,310
k,
h haitian,

1632
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:52,610
these motherfuckers and there
brutalization of our god given language.

1633
01:15:52,820 --> 01:15:52,970
How

1634
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,930
about presidents?
Language is hate a k,

1635
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:59,110
a l o is it?
You've got my dad's gone.

1636
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:01,050
The hackle hello?
Hello?

1637
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:04,510
Kate.
J k l a,

1638
01:16:04,511 --> 01:16:06,330
u l a u?
Yeah.

1639
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:08,670
So he's,
he's a hypnotic state and the,

1640
01:16:08,671 --> 01:16:10,710
it's quite easy to do.
Um,

1641
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:13,900
we,
I've done it with a lot of people and it

1642
01:16:13,901 --> 01:16:16,420
works very,
very well to use to calm yourself down a

1643
01:16:16,421 --> 01:16:18,370
little bit.
So as I said before,

1644
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:20,590
what you do is I'll just sit down and do
it.

1645
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:23,980
So you're basically using lots of
different ways of doing it.

1646
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:27,400
You can find a spot on the wall that's
higher than your eye line,

1647
01:16:27,790 --> 01:16:30,900
so you kind of look it up on a diagonal
and if you imagine that you can,

1648
01:16:30,940 --> 01:16:34,840
you're looking for your third eye
looking for the middle of your eyebrows

1649
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:38,680
and what you do is you focus on a spot
on the wall and why are you focusing all

1650
01:16:38,681 --> 01:16:43,540
your energy on that spot you imagined
that you can see all the way to the left

1651
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,780
and all the way to the right.
Imagine that you can see really high

1652
01:16:47,781 --> 01:16:50,710
above self and below yourself,
and then you imagine while you're

1653
01:16:50,711 --> 01:16:52,390
looking at,
you can imagine you can use your

1654
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:56,140
awareness to touch everything in the
room so you can see behind yourself,

1655
01:16:56,141 --> 01:16:58,960
very rarely above yourself and below
yourself and around yourself.

1656
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:02,500
And what that does is it just,
it calms you down and gives you a bigger

1657
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:04,810
periphery.
It's peripheral vision is increasing

1658
01:17:04,811 --> 01:17:08,010
your peripheral vision,
which is extremely good for combat

1659
01:17:08,170 --> 01:17:09,590
combat athletes,
et cetera.

1660
01:17:09,591 --> 01:17:10,150
And,

1661
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:12,380
you know,
just being calm and just putting

1662
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:14,630
yourself in a common situatIon.
Like we talked about,

1663
01:17:14,890 --> 01:17:18,770
bossy allometry young girl didn't
earlier ease and hair color all the

1664
01:17:18,771 --> 01:17:19,990
time.
He's amazing.

1665
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:21,440
yeah,
he's a pretty bad ass.

1666
01:17:21,441 --> 01:17:24,710
He's amazing.
So explain to me why increasing your

1667
01:17:24,711 --> 01:17:27,980
peripheral benefits you like what,
what does it do?

1668
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:28,873
Well,
because if you,

1669
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,240
when people say have tunnel vision,
you know,

1670
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,101
you'll,
you'll see that.

1671
01:17:31,101 --> 01:17:33,290
Why don't you write some of asians like
that?

1672
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:36,590
you don't see anything else.
You see that in street fights,

1673
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:37,481
you see the,
like,

1674
01:17:37,481 --> 01:17:39,230
I've,
I've talked about this one street fight

1675
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:40,211
where,
uh,

1676
01:17:40,211 --> 01:17:45,050
I watched in front of the comedy store.
These two guys were arguing and uh,

1677
01:17:45,170 --> 01:17:50,170
this one guy had zero idea how to fight.
I mean like literally zero.

1678
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:54,440
And he's standing in front of this other
guy and they start throwing Blows.

1679
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:57,050
And this guy literally,
he's wIncing,

1680
01:17:57,170 --> 01:18:01,610
his eyes are almost closed and he's
doing this because it may,

1681
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:05,720
it standing square in front of this guy
and is literally like throwing his

1682
01:18:05,721 --> 01:18:06,554
hands.

1683
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:09,350
A bus moves in front of us.
I can't see what happens.

1684
01:18:09,470 --> 01:18:11,720
The bus pulls forth and the guy's
flattened,

1685
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,330
just laying flat out and the other guys
were running away,

1686
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:17,810
so this guy cracked him.
The other guy didn't know what the fuck

1687
01:18:17,811 --> 01:18:20,810
he was doing either.
He was lucky that the first guy over by

1688
01:18:20,930 --> 01:18:22,060
the bus then.
No,

1689
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:22,501
no,
no,

1690
01:18:22,501 --> 01:18:22,790
no,
no,

1691
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:23,031
no,
no,

1692
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:23,301
no,
no.

1693
01:18:23,301 --> 01:18:25,940
He just got knocked out on the street.
They were in this treat when this

1694
01:18:25,941 --> 01:18:29,420
happened though,
but my point is that you could tell that

1695
01:18:29,421 --> 01:18:34,280
this guy was frozen in this moment.
He wasn't aware of this guy throwing his

1696
01:18:34,281 --> 01:18:38,510
hands on them and moving his head out of
the way and being completely aware most

1697
01:18:38,511 --> 01:18:41,750
of the time in,
in really incredibly stressful

1698
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:43,190
situations.
Your,

1699
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:46,700
your point of vision closes and you
tense up.

1700
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:50,390
Yeah.
So by expanding your peripheral vision,

1701
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:52,430
you think you can relax.

1702
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,260
It could be come on,
you come extra law.

1703
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:00,500
What is going on?
When you're expanding your peripheral

1704
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:01,730
vision,
putting your unconscious.

1705
01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:07,160
So say you're opening your unconscious
via just like just seeing more than you

1706
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:10,190
can actually say.
So say if you were in a an archery

1707
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:12,320
competition,
you're shooting at this target.

1708
01:19:12,321 --> 01:19:16,160
That's like 70 meters away and you
really have to concentrate and you're

1709
01:19:16,161 --> 01:19:19,400
looking at that spot and you're like,
when there's all these nerves and

1710
01:19:19,401 --> 01:19:21,860
everything like that and you're drawing
your bow back and you're constantly on

1711
01:19:21,861 --> 01:19:24,680
that spot.
How would one implement that then?

1712
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:26,320
Well,
you can do hunkeler.

1713
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:28,670
You do that.
You do that first.

1714
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,090
explain that so you find a spot and you
find a spot that's higher than the

1715
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:32,990
target.
FoR instance,

1716
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,790
say the sockets here,
you'd find it's august.

1717
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:36,870
That's just above.
SaY elvis.

1718
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,740
okay,
so you look for a few feet above the

1719
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,150
target.

1720
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,350
Just find a spot.
Concentrate on.

1721
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:44,450
Just allow yourself to spread your
awareness.

1722
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:46,520
There's also,
there's another way of they get wet.

1723
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,050
You can have your palms out like this,
right?

1724
01:19:49,370 --> 01:19:52,120
And then when you bring your palms and
when you can see out,

1725
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:54,240
so you can see,
you can see it on palm,

1726
01:19:54,260 --> 01:19:56,140
you dRop your hands,
seven.

1727
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:58,570
You'd also put your hand over your hat
and then when you,

1728
01:19:58,571 --> 01:20:00,200
when you can see your fingers over your
head,

1729
01:20:00,201 --> 01:20:04,040
you drop that to so spread.
You spread your arms out,

1730
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:07,470
you can't see your arms.
And then you start bringing them and the

1731
01:20:07,471 --> 01:20:08,040
moment you

1732
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:10,140
see your hands,
you drop your hands,

1733
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:14,400
but you keep your eyes forward so you
keep your eyes focused on wherever that

1734
01:20:14,401 --> 01:20:19,401
spot is over your head.
Then you let your hands down and why is

1735
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:21,110
what is going on when I'm doing that

1736
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:21,931
based?
No.

1737
01:20:21,931 --> 01:20:24,310
The focus point it just banged awareness
picker.

1738
01:20:24,660 --> 01:20:26,790
Just make sure your site bigger.
So when you,

1739
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:27,990
when you're in the periphery.
Yeah.

1740
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,100
Have a calmness about you.

1741
01:20:29,370 --> 01:20:32,660
And what is the philosophy when they
talk about hakalau in w?

1742
01:20:32,720 --> 01:20:34,530
What did you say?
The name of the luna.

1743
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,560
Who knows what is.
What is the thought process about

1744
01:20:37,561 --> 01:20:38,400
hakalau?
Is that,

1745
01:20:38,430 --> 01:20:41,860
is that a part of their practice as part
of that practice?

1746
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:43,080
You do this thing with their arms.

1747
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:44,160
Oh,
well no.

1748
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,230
These loads of different ways of doing.
I'm not aware of.

1749
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:47,380
They do it with the hands.
I know.

1750
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:49,810
I just know techniques you've been
taught or whatever,

1751
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:53,380
but I know that you know the staring at
the spot on the wall and allowing your

1752
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:55,000
periphery just to spread.
Yeah,

1753
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,920
it works.
And what is,

1754
01:20:56,921 --> 01:20:58,240
what,
why is it work?

1755
01:20:58,241 --> 01:21:01,120
Like what's going on?
It calms your mind.

1756
01:21:01,121 --> 01:21:04,690
And if you're focusing on something.
So if you're focusing on,

1757
01:21:04,691 --> 01:21:05,860
I don't know,
whatever you're shooting,

1758
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:08,590
right?
If you're looking at law and yet you've

1759
01:21:08,591 --> 01:21:10,690
got this background shit going on,
blah,

1760
01:21:10,691 --> 01:21:11,170
blah,
blah.

1761
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:13,450
More than likely that ski focus.
It's not,

1762
01:21:13,451 --> 01:21:14,510
that's not your focus guys,

1763
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:17,340
the one you're pointing to your head
people to listen to and you're saying

1764
01:21:17,341 --> 01:21:17,671
blah,
blah,

1765
01:21:17,671 --> 01:21:20,390
blah.
You mean like the inner dialogue,

1766
01:21:20,391 --> 01:21:21,750
the chuck,
don't fuck this up,

1767
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:24,290
don't miss miss.
Breathe properly,

1768
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:25,124
braised properly.

1769
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:26,950
And when you,
when you,

1770
01:21:27,100 --> 01:21:31,330
when you get control of yourself by just
focusing your awareness,

1771
01:21:31,810 --> 01:21:32,850
which is your,
your,

1772
01:21:32,910 --> 01:21:35,500
your,
your area said,

1773
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:37,240
relax.
then you start.

1774
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:39,340
Then you just get yourself into a
composition.

1775
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,940
So say if someone was in a hunting
situation,

1776
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,530
there was a deer.
the deer is moving to 30 yards away and

1777
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,990
it's moving right into what you would
call it,

1778
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:52,991
a shooting lane in between two trees.
How would you try to initiate haka loud?

1779
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:56,670
Because you do.
Before you Started,

1780
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:59,140
are you to keep.
Practice it all the time.

1781
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:00,190
When did you participate?
Yes,

1782
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:02,320
when you brought it all the time it
becomes a part of.

1783
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:04,900
Yeah.
It's like anything mind coaching or

1784
01:22:04,901 --> 01:22:09,901
being been using the techniques.
I teach people these you got practice,

1785
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,400
you can't just,
I'll just go,

1786
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,360
hello.
And that's it.

1787
01:22:13,361 --> 01:22:16,240
And you have to practice it and practice
it and practice it and it becomes,

1788
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:17,760
it becomes more and more.
Yeah.

1789
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:22,730
So this seems like such a simple
solution to a very complex issue.

1790
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,680
There's a lot of what is going on with
archery is what's called a.

1791
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:31,190
There's a lot of different theories are.
One of the theories is w recoil bracing,

1792
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:34,370
like you know that something's going to
happen so you're preparing for this

1793
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:37,730
thing to happen and then in preparing
for that thing to happen that is

1794
01:22:37,731 --> 01:22:41,660
becoming more of your focus then
actually making it work correctly.

1795
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:42,760
Yeah,
but it.

1796
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:46,030
But it does calm me down.
So even in the aspects of shooting,

1797
01:22:46,031 --> 01:22:48,360
I'm surely that,
I don't know.

1798
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:51,910
I don't do it,
but I mean surely it's calming down that

1799
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:54,250
you're aiming for,
for aiming at something.

1800
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,450
Right?
So,

1801
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:59,230
but it's also being focused,
completely focused on the result and not

1802
01:22:59,380 --> 01:23:01,180
negative.
Just focus your awareness.

1803
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:02,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

1804
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:05,380
the more that you do it,
the more people do inspiring as they get

1805
01:23:05,381 --> 01:23:07,290
less hit.
They got,

1806
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:10,820
they get less hit inspiring.
I know where there's a weight lifter

1807
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:12,270
called Emma James,
that's,

1808
01:23:12,510 --> 01:23:17,510
it seems like a 20 old time will have a
lifting lady person and um,

1809
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,210
she uses alcohol and it works.
And what does she do?

1810
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,900
She just basically same thing.
Smokers.

1811
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:27,320
And are there other methods other than
those straight straightening your arms

1812
01:23:27,321 --> 01:23:28,080
out,

1813
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,880
looking forward.
The best one,

1814
01:23:30,060 --> 01:23:31,550
my personal opinion,
you know,

1815
01:23:31,630 --> 01:23:33,150
people may argue it,
but you know,

1816
01:23:33,450 --> 01:23:38,040
my personal opinion is you say you folks
find a spot on the wall and allow your

1817
01:23:38,041 --> 01:23:40,650
awareness just a spread.
So you imagine you can see all the way

1818
01:23:40,651 --> 01:23:42,510
to the left and all the way to the
right.

1819
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:44,790
So you're out in the woods,
you pick a spot on a tree.

1820
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,610
Yeah.
And you keep practicing and keep doing

1821
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:50,820
it and you will,
it will eventually be embedded.

1822
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:55,410
So why is expandIng your peripheral
vision calming?

1823
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:57,790
I don't know,
it just,

1824
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,800
it just seems to calm the whole body
down.

1825
01:24:00,810 --> 01:24:01,680
He sees,
again,

1826
01:24:01,681 --> 01:24:04,050
you're not full.
You focusing on spreading your

1827
01:24:04,051 --> 01:24:05,820
awareness.
You're not focusing on panic.

1828
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:10,620
Are you focusing on anything else so
surely if you're just focusing on seeing

1829
01:24:10,621 --> 01:24:14,280
and just moving out and so allowing
yourself just to spread.

1830
01:24:14,430 --> 01:24:16,950
I'm doing it now.
You know you can just.

1831
01:24:17,250 --> 01:24:19,170
You can just feel it.
WHen I do seminars,

1832
01:24:19,171 --> 01:24:23,090
which you do a lot of you doing seminar,
you're talking to people and this,

1833
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,350
this and this.
you can spot people tHat are wondering

1834
01:24:25,351 --> 01:24:28,080
mentally so you can see them.
Then you just turn it until you

1835
01:24:28,081 --> 01:24:29,540
understand and then just go.
Yeah,

1836
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:30,540
because you.
You have to.

1837
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:34,170
You have to guide the audience.
She knows certainly when you're doing

1838
01:24:34,171 --> 01:24:36,180
comedy,
I think you do anyway.

1839
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:38,040
I think you'll be doing.
You'll do it in comedy.

1840
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:41,790
I think when you're on the stage,
you'll do it in comedy anyway because

1841
01:24:41,791 --> 01:24:44,970
you can become a ladder.
Everybody sort of.

1842
01:24:45,810 --> 01:24:50,550
You definitely go into a state of hello
is it induces a state.

1843
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:53,020
When you're doing comedy,
you're in the moment,

1844
01:24:53,650 --> 01:24:57,250
but you're also a passenger,
you know,

1845
01:24:57,260 --> 01:25:00,310
to do comedy,
you almost have to get out of your own

1846
01:25:00,311 --> 01:25:03,070
way,
but you also have to have prepared the

1847
01:25:03,071 --> 01:25:05,530
material enough to where you know where
you're going with it

1848
01:25:05,540 --> 01:25:07,820
so you can relax.
Think about thinking about archery.

1849
01:25:07,821 --> 01:25:11,390
Then you know you have to go your own
way because the only person that's

1850
01:25:11,470 --> 01:25:12,303
panicking,
ego,

1851
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:13,230
the animal,
all that,

1852
01:25:13,230 --> 01:25:16,640
whatever you shoot and exactly right,
he's exactly the same.

1853
01:25:16,641 --> 01:25:20,200
You're moving yourself out of the way to
get yourself into the zone way you're

1854
01:25:20,201 --> 01:25:21,320
going to do.
Trust me.

1855
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,630
Just just try it and if you know

1856
01:25:23,140 --> 01:25:28,030
definitely well,
that's an interesting solution to a

1857
01:25:28,031 --> 01:25:32,440
really common issue with archers like
tournament archers,

1858
01:25:32,860 --> 01:25:37,860
they panic so much that they've come up
with a method of allowing this boat to

1859
01:25:38,411 --> 01:25:43,411
go off without them doing it on purpose.
It's a surprise release hypnosis.

1860
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,390
that's a hypnotic state.
Yeah.

1861
01:25:46,480 --> 01:25:50,140
They have this thing called a hinge
release and what a hinge release as you

1862
01:25:50,141 --> 01:25:52,840
clip it onto your bow and as you pull it
back,

1863
01:25:52,841 --> 01:25:56,650
instead of hitting a trigger,
you're slowly moving your hand and you

1864
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,310
never know when it's going to go off.
He just slowly curling your finger and

1865
01:26:00,311 --> 01:26:03,350
there's a little hinge inside of it and
once it gets past a certain point,

1866
01:26:03,530 --> 01:26:06,620
it just goes off.
So instead of like hammering the trigger

1867
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:11,300
goes off completely by surprise.
So they figured out a solution to

1868
01:26:11,301 --> 01:26:15,450
whatever this thing is that fucks with
people's heads.

1869
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:19,220
But what you think is that if you can do
It in practice,

1870
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:23,560
you can do It in a real life situation.
If you expand

1871
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:25,550
your peripheral vision,
isn't it?

1872
01:26:27,140 --> 01:26:27,750
Look,
you know,

1873
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,580
like we talked the last time it was
unable to talk about golovkin.

1874
01:26:30,910 --> 01:26:34,510
He talks about feeling innocent.
So how he says about about punches,

1875
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:37,780
but I feel this,
I feel like it says feel all the time

1876
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,940
and he feels,
he feels,

1877
01:26:40,060 --> 01:26:41,470
I feel this,
I know him.

1878
01:26:41,471 --> 01:26:45,070
I feel he is an awareness.
The spansion of awareness.

1879
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:46,151
You know,
in english.

1880
01:26:46,151 --> 01:26:50,050
You know that when you flip the bird in
english is that it's two fingers,

1881
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:53,380
you know what it's from.
It's from when we had was with the

1882
01:26:53,381 --> 01:26:55,450
french or the french,
you know the capture,

1883
01:26:55,490 --> 01:27:00,490
the arches that cut the fingers off.
So that's just to say this before.

1884
01:27:00,791 --> 01:27:01,451
Yeah.
Yeah.

1885
01:27:01,451 --> 01:27:03,400
But that's to do with the to say fuck
off.

1886
01:27:03,401 --> 01:27:05,590
I've got my two fingers and that's from
archer.

1887
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:08,410
That makeS sense.
But it's not a state.

1888
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,550
Do you know the mongols didn't use it
that way.

1889
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,350
They use their thumb,
they hook it with their thumb and then

1890
01:27:14,351 --> 01:27:16,240
they grabbed their finger like this and
they pull it back.

1891
01:27:16,241 --> 01:27:20,500
That way they had their own little weird
because you have a release in your hand.

1892
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:23,980
You do it this way because you can get a
consistent anchor point.

1893
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:24,970
So it's running your chin.

1894
01:27:26,370 --> 01:27:28,560
If you drop the ball,
if you drop the boat,

1895
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,280
the arrow drops.
Yes.

1896
01:27:30,870 --> 01:27:31,830
Certainly.
Yeah.

1897
01:27:31,831 --> 01:27:34,440
I've heard that one year you have to
stay completely still.

1898
01:27:34,441 --> 01:27:38,370
Is the arrow releases coming from robin
hood country as a natural thing?

1899
01:27:38,930 --> 01:27:39,763
Yeah.
It's just,

1900
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:40,880
it's.

1901
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,480
But there's a bunch of different kinds
of.

1902
01:27:42,481 --> 01:27:44,610
Bose is a bunch of different ways of
shooting,

1903
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:48,090
like when you're shooting with a recurve
bow or a traditional bow,

1904
01:27:48,270 --> 01:27:51,030
you're pulling it back and just letting
it go really quickly,

1905
01:27:51,090 --> 01:27:53,310
bang with,
with a compound bow,

1906
01:27:53,311 --> 01:27:57,510
you're settling in and relaxing and
trying to stay calm and keep the pin

1907
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:01,230
relatively close to the area,
but concentrating on the spot and then

1908
01:28:01,231 --> 01:28:05,790
you release and as you release,
it's got to be in one smooth motion with

1909
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:09,790
your hand pulls back as you do it.
So there's no yanking this way of

1910
01:28:09,810 --> 01:28:13,440
pulling that way or there's nothing
that's gonna affect the travel of the

1911
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:14,274
arrow

1912
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:18,070
level that there's a lot of minDset
going into a level of self trust.

1913
01:28:18,220 --> 01:28:23,160
Isn't aware that there's a big level of
self trust and not saying anything small

1914
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,530
or anything else.
He said,

1915
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:26,680
learning to trust yourself and trusting
your,

1916
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:28,480
trusting your mind.
You know,

1917
01:28:28,481 --> 01:28:29,800
and,
and I just think that with,

1918
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:33,540
with mine coaching stuff,
with techniques that you know,

1919
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:37,390
that you get to learn and get to,
to having your locker,

1920
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:40,040
I think it's massively beneficial as
you're alive.

1921
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,620
You will do it.
I mean if you,

1922
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:44,650
you know,
I can always record something and send

1923
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:48,850
you it before you go to this thing that
you're doing and see what happens.

1924
01:28:48,851 --> 01:28:51,340
I'd be interesting for me to see what
happens because I've never worked with

1925
01:28:51,341 --> 01:28:53,620
anyone in the zone archery.
It is.

1926
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:56,530
It is a lot of preparation for one
moment.

1927
01:28:56,740 --> 01:29:01,200
Might happen once a year and that's one
of the big things about it is like when

1928
01:29:01,201 --> 01:29:03,590
someone prepares for like a bow hunt in
particular,

1929
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:05,910
the lease a tournament,
you have multiple shots,

1930
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:08,070
you can shoot many,
many times you get more relaxed,

1931
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:12,660
but when someone prepares for a hunt,
you are preparing year round.

1932
01:29:12,661 --> 01:29:14,220
You're shooting arrows constantly.
It's,

1933
01:29:14,221 --> 01:29:15,054
it's,
it's an.

1934
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:18,950
I can't believe how hard it is.
I mean when I first started doing and I

1935
01:29:18,951 --> 01:29:19,741
was like,
what's the big deal?

1936
01:29:19,741 --> 01:29:21,450
You stand there,
you keep your arms straight,

1937
01:29:21,451 --> 01:29:23,370
you pull the bow back.
No,

1938
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:26,760
there's a lot going on and there's so
much to consider.

1939
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:28,800
The position,
the placement of your feet,

1940
01:29:28,801 --> 01:29:31,830
the position of your front shoulder,
how you're gripping the bow,

1941
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:34,530
pulling back to the same consistent
anchor point,

1942
01:29:35,070 --> 01:29:38,040
looking through the peep site correctly,
Make sure you send her the peep site

1943
01:29:38,041 --> 01:29:41,620
with the site housing on the bow
releasing with no movement whatsoever,

1944
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,430
making sure that everything is done
perfectly and keeping the mind

1945
01:29:44,431 --> 01:29:48,510
concentrating specifically on a spot.
You have to look where you want to hit.

1946
01:29:48,660 --> 01:29:52,080
You can't look in the vague area and you
can't hope you're going to hit

1947
01:29:52,081 --> 01:29:54,690
something.
You have to be absolutely convinced

1948
01:29:54,691 --> 01:29:55,410
you're going to hit something.

1949
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:56,270
Yeah,
and you will.

1950
01:29:57,770 --> 01:30:00,190
You will look at you positive thinking,
you will.

1951
01:30:00,370 --> 01:30:01,910
You will,
because that's the intention.

1952
01:30:01,911 --> 01:30:05,210
So if your intention set your intention,
set your site,

1953
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:08,030
which is exactly the same as it not set
your sight on right,

1954
01:30:08,031 --> 01:30:11,900
and this is what I'm going to do set you
say on your intention where you go and

1955
01:30:11,901 --> 01:30:12,980
say,
this is what I'm going to do.

1956
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:17,570
Set your intention and that is a big
part of why people fuck up.

1957
01:30:17,690 --> 01:30:19,100
They go,
I hope this works.

1958
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,760
This works.
The even said that strikes part,

1959
01:30:22,761 --> 01:30:23,900
do or do not,
there is no try.

1960
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:25,370
You know,
you set your intention.

1961
01:30:25,371 --> 01:30:27,100
I know it's cliche,
but you know,

1962
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:30,800
we set your intention will a lot of
times cliches are there for a reason,

1963
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:33,260
but they're the,
they're real.

1964
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:35,030
They represent reality.
Yeah.

1965
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:36,770
Yeah,
and I think in this one it does.

1966
01:30:37,150 --> 01:30:40,790
It's,
it's just an extreme thing and it's also

1967
01:30:40,791 --> 01:30:44,570
a thing of this archery thing and
bowhunting in particular where a lot of

1968
01:30:44,571 --> 01:30:47,870
people who are engaging in it,
they might not have a lot of experience

1969
01:30:47,871 --> 01:30:50,480
in performing under extreme pressure.
Yeah.

1970
01:30:51,170 --> 01:30:54,710
So you don't have a lot of opportunities
where you're performing under extreme

1971
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:58,820
extreme pressure and then you have an
incredibly intense moment where it's

1972
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:01,550
literally life or death to this animal.

1973
01:31:01,550 --> 01:31:02,420
Yeah.
Yeah.

1974
01:31:02,850 --> 01:31:07,650
But at least we'll talk and we'll talk
because they want you to change the

1975
01:31:07,651 --> 01:31:10,780
language around it to give you a motor,
the motor.

1976
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:14,120
Because it is complicated.
I get la please.

1977
01:31:14,130 --> 01:31:16,500
We got to make it as less complicated as
we can.

1978
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:18,990
So it's.
So it's a smooth thing.

1979
01:31:18,991 --> 01:31:20,850
You said it's complicated,
but it's not complicated like the

1980
01:31:20,851 --> 01:31:23,370
english language,
the english language is unbelievably

1981
01:31:23,371 --> 01:31:25,560
complex.
Thousands of letters and I mean

1982
01:31:25,561 --> 01:31:29,280
thousands of words and you're,
you're using them all in different ways

1983
01:31:29,281 --> 01:31:31,620
and inflection and we all do that
effort.

1984
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,910
So think I think,
I think you can,

1985
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:36,090
you know,
we're doing the techniques and helping

1986
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,110
you out.
My certainly.

1987
01:31:37,111 --> 01:31:37,944
Well,
because you know,

1988
01:31:38,070 --> 01:31:40,740
you're a very nice man.
I'll give you credit for sure.

1989
01:31:41,390 --> 01:31:42,850
I want you to.
I want to,

1990
01:31:43,050 --> 01:31:46,170
I really wanted to talk to you about
this because I've seen all these

1991
01:31:46,171 --> 01:31:51,171
different methods that people use to try
to overcome target panic and one of them

1992
01:31:51,841 --> 01:31:56,280
is um,
a positive affirmation or positive,

1993
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,780
a way of looking at it.

1994
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:02,780
Like my friend shane dorian was here and
he was talking about his friend and his

1995
01:32:03,731 --> 01:32:06,970
friend right before he goes to shoot the
arrow.

1996
01:32:06,971 --> 01:32:08,290
And he said his friends are really nice
guy.

1997
01:32:08,530 --> 01:32:11,020
His friend says,
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1998
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,440
That's what he says in his head,
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1999
01:32:14,630 --> 01:32:18,220
Like he says that in his head.
He's absolutely convinced this is what

2000
01:32:18,221 --> 01:32:19,630
he's going to do.
It's not.

2001
01:32:19,631 --> 01:32:23,350
I hope this arrow lands perfectly.
I hope I make a great shot.

2002
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:27,040
He affirms in in his head where there's
no wishy washiness about it.

2003
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:28,900
When I send intention,
yeah,

2004
01:32:29,950 --> 01:32:34,060
I'm a
full and you said you,

2005
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:34,810
you,
you.

2006
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:36,640
And they said,
when you change the language around,

2007
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:38,110
when he changed the language around
anything,

2008
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:40,740
it becomes,
it becomes more useful to you.

2009
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:44,050
You know Lisa Dennis that I said,
he said,

2010
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:45,130
yeah,
it's an affirmation,

2011
01:32:45,131 --> 01:32:47,830
but it's also setting your intention in
every way.

2012
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:49,510
If you think about it,
she did not.

2013
01:32:49,511 --> 01:32:51,610
Bow is setting your intention and every
single light,

2014
01:32:51,611 --> 01:32:53,950
isn't it?
Because yOur intention is the beast,

2015
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:56,920
if you will,
and you're setting your intention so

2016
01:32:56,921 --> 01:32:59,210
you've got a calm this.
Yeah,

2017
01:33:00,020 --> 01:33:00,800
we'll.
Yeah,

2018
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,840
we'll,
we'll get it.

2019
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:04,480
We'll get it.
We'll get it.

2020
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:07,840
Well,
I would really like to see if this is

2021
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:12,841
effective or if it helps other archers
because that's one of the things that me

2022
01:33:12,911 --> 01:33:16,930
getting involved in bow hunting or been
exposed to this common problem that

2023
01:33:16,931 --> 01:33:19,810
people talk about it.
I'm absolutely fascinated by common

2024
01:33:19,811 --> 01:33:23,680
problems.
The problems that seem to represent a

2025
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:27,880
pattern of thinking that's really almost
natural,

2026
01:33:28,060 --> 01:33:30,520
but obviously should be avoided.
Yeah,

2027
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:31,740
yeah,
yeah,

2028
01:33:32,020 --> 01:33:35,680
exactly.
It's just about you focusing your

2029
01:33:35,681 --> 01:33:37,970
attention on what you want.
That sounds.

2030
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:40,600
That'S how you get things in life.
You focus on what you want,

2031
01:33:40,601 --> 01:33:41,500
not what you don't want.

2032
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:45,280
You focused on totally on up and you
will get things that will trip you.

2033
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,380
Don't live on a cloud and never,
never,

2034
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:49,720
never say that.
What you do is you focus on what you

2035
01:33:49,721 --> 01:33:53,260
want and you keep focusing on what you
want and to deal with things that get in

2036
01:33:53,261 --> 01:33:54,670
your way,
but keep focusing on what you want.

2037
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:56,020
That's the.
That's the.

2038
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:59,020
I don't focus on the problems.
Focus on what you want.

2039
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:02,800
Focus on how difficult is this problem
and how difficult it says,

2040
01:34:03,510 --> 01:34:05,320
because all of you telling you you're,
you're all you're doing,

2041
01:34:05,321 --> 01:34:07,110
you're young conscious.
Then you only formation.

2042
01:34:07,120 --> 01:34:10,030
You've given it some harder it.
So then what does it become?

2043
01:34:10,031 --> 01:34:12,370
It become something that becomes
something huge,

2044
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,140
and this comes back to what we were
talking about,

2045
01:34:14,141 --> 01:34:18,040
the very beginning of this podcast.
The language that you use in your own

2046
01:34:18,041 --> 01:34:23,041
mind can be very self-defining and can
sort of really not just define you,

2047
01:34:24,461 --> 01:34:29,461
but define your future and how you,
how you interact with life and I didn't

2048
01:34:29,921 --> 01:34:34,390
tell people I interview are you get you
come across a now you perceive yourself

2049
01:34:34,391 --> 01:34:37,120
in order to projects everything into,
into what happens,

2050
01:34:37,121 --> 01:34:40,700
you know,
and I think that's the idea if it's,

2051
01:34:40,890 --> 01:34:43,870
is just changing the language,
the way you speak to yourself.

2052
01:34:44,570 --> 01:34:47,260
if you can change the language ways you
speech of your life will change

2053
01:34:47,261 --> 01:34:49,910
exponentially.
That's my change.

2054
01:34:49,911 --> 01:34:54,130
The language folks change the language
and obviously this is also,

2055
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:57,530
it's not an instantaneous process,
right?

2056
01:34:57,750 --> 01:34:58,583
He's practice.

2057
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:02,850
The first time you did spend in bucket,
you didn't land on the target and was

2058
01:35:03,150 --> 01:35:05,270
brilliant like a senior wiley and now
buck.

2059
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:08,270
Well ian's and other british to
wellbeing.

2060
01:35:08,640 --> 01:35:10,990
What does that.
Oh well eating.

2061
01:35:11,150 --> 01:35:13,860
Well he is a is a wellington.
I don't know,

2062
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:18,840
it's just the slang term for kicking.
Very welli when you kick,

2063
01:35:18,930 --> 01:35:20,790
when your well eat something,
you kick in it because you know

2064
01:35:20,791 --> 01:35:22,530
wellington boots.
Oh,

2065
01:35:22,531 --> 01:35:23,370
okay.
So yeah,

2066
01:35:23,371 --> 01:35:24,580
but when i'Ve seen you,
you know,

2067
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,770
the senior that spinning back,
kick it out,

2068
01:35:26,790 --> 01:35:29,270
usually showing john same per judge.
St louis.

2069
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:30,900
That was right.
You know,

2070
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:32,780
so first time you did that,
you didn't do correctly.

2071
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:35,670
Nobody.
It's all about practice in mind.

2072
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:37,890
Coaching isn't an instantaneous thing
for phobias.

2073
01:35:37,891 --> 01:35:39,950
Yes.
Works.

2074
01:35:40,160 --> 01:35:42,540
Yes,
but I mean for,

2075
01:35:42,630 --> 01:35:44,640
for certain things in life,
you've got to,

2076
01:35:44,641 --> 01:35:47,850
you've got to keep doing it.
It's just nice thing is practice,

2077
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:49,480
you know?

2078
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:52,090
Yeah.
And that's the case with everything,

2079
01:35:52,091 --> 01:35:55,540
including thinking,
thinking is a skill.

2080
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,580
Yes.
I'm thinking of something that you have

2081
01:35:57,581 --> 01:36:02,581
to develop and develop proper technique
and adhere to these proper techniques.

2082
01:36:04,780 --> 01:36:05,190
Always.

2083
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:06,900
Yes.
That's why I don't do one offs.

2084
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:11,040
I used to do one off,
so he used to be one off sessions for

2085
01:36:11,041 --> 01:36:13,560
people,
like one to ones and do a session one

2086
01:36:13,561 --> 01:36:15,510
session.
I don't do one anymore.

2087
01:36:15,570 --> 01:36:19,920
I do more do thinG called four weeks to
freedom on our people that sign up for a

2088
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:23,040
year with me as well because he seeks it
an ongoing process.

2089
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:24,290
I sTill love it.
My,

2090
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:25,650
my teacher column,
mci,

2091
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:29,820
I still,
I still pull up ruminate things and he

2092
01:36:29,910 --> 01:36:32,330
puts my thinking on the right path or
whatever east.

2093
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:34,530
No one's.
We're not a finished products.

2094
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:36,150
I'm certainly not a finished product,
you know,

2095
01:36:36,151 --> 01:36:38,160
but it's just about practice.

2096
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:41,630
That's really what's important.
Like people would try to point out

2097
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:46,670
inconsistencies in someone's behavior as
a sign that maybe that person shouldn't

2098
01:36:48,141 --> 01:36:51,890
be the one that's being a mental coach,
like yourself or someone who is maybe

2099
01:36:51,891 --> 01:36:53,720
not succeeded in everything they've ever
tried.

2100
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:57,350
How could this person possibly be a
mental coach when they're not even

2101
01:36:57,351 --> 01:37:01,070
capable of running their own light,
but know that every human being is

2102
01:37:01,071 --> 01:37:04,580
essentially the same in that regard is
that no matter where you are,

2103
01:37:04,640 --> 01:37:07,250
you could probably do better and no
matter who you are,

2104
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:11,300
you have learned along the way.
A lot of it by failure.

2105
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:14,850
Yeah.
I'm going back as well because I'm

2106
01:37:15,450 --> 01:37:19,230
fumbling because he does things that I
think you'll change the face of parks

2107
01:37:19,231 --> 01:37:20,580
and I really do.
Why do you think that?

2108
01:37:20,830 --> 01:37:23,280
I've seen what he does.
He does like the short test.

2109
01:37:23,281 --> 01:37:25,470
Have you seen that or he does the
different numbers.

2110
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,900
What he's like,
he's a short test way.

2111
01:37:27,901 --> 01:37:32,730
You wanted 25 and they're all in a
square and then they see this.

2112
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:35,610
All the numbers are in squares as well
and he has to touch them and.

2113
01:37:35,680 --> 01:37:36,620
Oh,
I see what you're saying.

2114
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:39,870
It just loads of different mind.
Stuffy reaction drill.

2115
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:40,570
Yeah,
but he's.

2116
01:37:40,570 --> 01:37:43,590
He's building his awareness.
He's building his intelligence.

2117
01:37:43,591 --> 01:37:46,530
That's why he's called himself hightech.
He's building his intelligence.

2118
01:37:46,531 --> 01:37:48,720
He's building his awareness.
He said,

2119
01:37:48,721 --> 01:37:50,400
then these next fight he's not going to
get here,

2120
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:53,370
is not to get hit.
What happens?

2121
01:37:53,371 --> 01:37:56,450
Was he his head,
you have a pull thing.

2122
01:37:56,490 --> 01:37:57,870
He's got.
He's got a mind coach,

2123
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:00,300
he's got a mind coach and when he lost
the salito,

2124
01:38:00,710 --> 01:38:03,900
nobody got like where the weight was
wrong and he got punched in the balls

2125
01:38:03,901 --> 01:38:06,770
and all that sort of stuff in salita
just out of our program.

2126
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:08,790
Rarely I guess he's too heavy,
this,

2127
01:38:08,791 --> 01:38:10,990
this and this,
but he didn't dwell on that.

2128
01:38:11,220 --> 01:38:13,140
He went back straight away.
Beat Gary Russell.

2129
01:38:13,141 --> 01:38:15,690
He's a great fight.
It's so under each because he didn't

2130
01:38:15,691 --> 01:38:17,340
dwell on it because he had a mind coach
saying,

2131
01:38:17,341 --> 01:38:19,520
look,
control your emotions mean brian tolbert

2132
01:38:19,530 --> 01:38:20,580
of consuMer.
We're talking about.

2133
01:38:20,581 --> 01:38:23,820
I read about that.
He was saying that his Mind coAch got

2134
01:38:23,821 --> 01:38:26,820
him to not focus just to control his
emotions and that's what it's about is

2135
01:38:26,821 --> 01:38:28,620
controlling your emotions,
controlling your,

2136
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:31,800
controlling you,
because you are your emotions after all

2137
01:38:32,310 --> 01:38:37,110
and just getting free.
What other People wouldn't and he isn't.

2138
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,230
He fighting salito in a rematch.
isn't that?

2139
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:42,300
I think it's muted,
but I don't.

2140
01:38:42,301 --> 01:38:44,760
I've heard also that you're going to
move up to lightweight and fight.

2141
01:38:44,761 --> 01:38:48,660
Manchester's a sonny terry flanagan for
the Wbl title,

2142
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:50,520
uh,
next year.

2143
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:52,170
Interesting.
But he's amazing.

2144
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,870
I've never seen anyone do what he does.
I'm putting out,

2145
01:38:54,890 --> 01:38:56,910
which was very good.
Roy jones was very good,

2146
01:38:56,911 --> 01:39:00,360
but he just seems to glide around people
and just,

2147
01:39:00,750 --> 01:39:02,780
it just seems to know what you're going
to do before you do it.

2148
01:39:02,781 --> 01:39:03,840
He's exceptional.

2149
01:39:03,930 --> 01:39:07,020
What's exceptional about him is that
he's not outside.

2150
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,250
He's inside and he's not getting hit.
Yeah.

2151
01:39:09,540 --> 01:39:13,470
That's one of the most impressive things
about him is that he stays in the pocket

2152
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:19,230
in any somehow is so slick and so,
so well schooled by his father as well.

2153
01:39:20,851 --> 01:39:21,660
Right?
Yeah.

2154
01:39:21,660 --> 01:39:23,160
Yeah.
A lot of people were disappointed.

2155
01:39:23,161 --> 01:39:25,170
and andre ward's performance on saturday
night.

2156
01:39:25,770 --> 01:39:27,480
I think the opponent had a lot to do
with it.

2157
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:30,420
Um,
I think against,

2158
01:39:30,510 --> 01:39:33,210
I think gangs kovalev it will be very,
very interesting.

2159
01:39:33,450 --> 01:39:34,410
Yeah.
Well what's,

2160
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:37,350
here's trinkle standing right in front
of this dude.

2161
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:39,810
Just beautiful counters,
man.

2162
01:39:39,811 --> 01:39:41,480
It's just so crazy.
Like,

2163
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:43,890
like he's just not there when the guy
goes to hit him.

2164
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:48,480
So he's insane how good he is.
He's so aware though.

2165
01:39:48,481 --> 01:39:51,810
He says awareness is awareness is so
perfect,

2166
01:39:51,811 --> 01:39:54,300
is distance and he's timing.
And what did he fight for?

2167
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:56,130
A world title fight and his second
profile.

2168
01:39:56,190 --> 01:39:57,180
Yes.
Yeah,

2169
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:01,650
and he's won two worlds out.
The different weights and seven fights.

2170
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:05,070
He's just so good at is his movement is
so incredible.

2171
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:07,110
You know,
you see a guy like lowman chenko and you

2172
01:40:07,111 --> 01:40:11,310
see gennady golovkin and kova live and
you go,

2173
01:40:11,311 --> 01:40:13,470
god damn,
these russians are bad motherfuckers.

2174
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:17,160
Mind coaches,
all of them maybe even the russians

2175
01:40:17,161 --> 01:40:19,350
used,
were the first people to start using,

2176
01:40:19,730 --> 01:40:21,210
you know,
mental couches and stuff.

2177
01:40:21,660 --> 01:40:24,890
This footwork is insane.
And again,

2178
01:40:24,891 --> 01:40:29,700
like what's insane about it is he's
right in front of the guy and yet he's

2179
01:40:30,120 --> 01:40:34,050
so elusive with his footwork,
who that step to the right upper cut

2180
01:40:34,051 --> 01:40:35,640
step to the left,
upper cut.

2181
01:40:35,730 --> 01:40:37,380
Just god damn.
He's good.

2182
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:40,510
And he pulls the hands as well.
Pose the hands down and frozen.

2183
01:40:40,780 --> 01:40:41,670
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2184
01:40:41,730 --> 01:40:42,720
He's really good at that.

2185
01:40:43,220 --> 01:40:44,580
He's a,
he's a freak.

2186
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:48,750
He's a real freak.
And so these russians,

2187
01:40:49,170 --> 01:40:50,520
they,
that's the way they school.

2188
01:40:50,530 --> 01:40:51,510
They're amateurs.
They,

2189
01:40:51,720 --> 01:40:53,470
they give them a lot of mind.
Yeah,

2190
01:40:53,471 --> 01:40:56,590
they do.
And launch uncle also was doing

2191
01:40:56,920 --> 01:41:00,020
gymnastics and ballet.
Ballet,

2192
01:41:00,310 --> 01:41:01,840
ballet is coming up again,
isn't it?

2193
01:41:02,130 --> 01:41:03,460
You know,
tumeric,

2194
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:06,200
tumeric and so.
Well,

2195
01:41:06,250 --> 01:41:09,400
I would think that that would help
because just the ability to control your

2196
01:41:09,401 --> 01:41:12,160
body.
Gymnastics in particular is fantastic

2197
01:41:12,161 --> 01:41:13,420
for that.
The ability to,

2198
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:18,430
like hixon gracie famously was into yoga
and he was into this very specific type

2199
01:41:21,251 --> 01:41:25,180
of yoga that's very gymnastics oriented.
Gymnastic on natural.

2200
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:26,231
And,
uh,

2201
01:41:26,231 --> 01:41:28,900
there's a lot of flexibility and
movemenT.

2202
01:41:28,900 --> 01:41:31,300
It's more of like a flowing type of yoga
thing,

2203
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:36,780
but it's just the movements and those
flowing type movements are one of the

2204
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:42,001
reasons why he was so good at jujitsu is
because his ability to control his body

2205
01:41:42,911 --> 01:41:47,800
was truly exceptional and he had very
unusual ability to control his body

2206
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,790
awareness,
isn't it?

2207
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:54,970
It's also strength in weird motions.
Yoga is a big part of that too.

2208
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:57,100
He was,
he was also a yogi and let,

2209
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,510
not just gymnastic and natural,
but like regular yoga he could do just

2210
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:03,280
to had incredible flexibility standing
on a balance beam,

2211
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:05,920
standing in a full split,
holding his foot above his head,

2212
01:42:06,430 --> 01:42:08,590
you know,
and he's 200 pounds and he's fighting

2213
01:42:08,591 --> 01:42:13,591
professionally and valley tudo events.
It'S all mind and body connection

2214
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:17,170
states.
he's getting you in conjunction with

2215
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,870
strength and conditioning.
So great as well as these loads of

2216
01:42:19,871 --> 01:42:22,870
stuff.
Now this make it can make athletes like

2217
01:42:22,871 --> 01:42:27,700
incredibly,
incredibly successful llama llama,

2218
01:42:27,701 --> 01:42:30,760
chanko mad gulf kitten matt.
He's fighting kell brook soon in

2219
01:42:30,761 --> 01:42:33,670
england.
September the 10th in london aPparently.

2220
01:42:33,671 --> 01:42:34,970
Um,
they,

2221
01:42:35,090 --> 01:42:38,410
they don't.
A 30 day wayne think and brooks heavier

2222
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:42,360
than heavier right now than triple j.
Yeah,

2223
01:42:43,030 --> 01:42:46,010
it'd be good.
Good luck with all that because.

2224
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:47,410
Or should it be savvier?
Yeah,

2225
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:49,140
no,
I know,

2226
01:42:49,210 --> 01:42:51,330
but I really.
Well,

2227
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,480
because he's english
guy.

2228
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,960
I like him.
Beverly's laverty windsor knot up.

2229
01:42:58,780 --> 01:42:59,680
Well,
he's got a chance.

2230
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:01,540
He's a professional boxer and he's
excellent.

2231
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:04,960
Gennady golovkin something special.
There's something hit.

2232
01:43:04,961 --> 01:43:08,500
His body attack is fucking ruthless to
man that left hook to the liver.

2233
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:11,800
He throws good lord and the way it cuts
the ring down.

2234
01:43:11,801 --> 01:43:12,770
And,
and I,

2235
01:43:13,140 --> 01:43:15,040
I just liked him as a Person.
He's not the most,

2236
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:17,780
the most sparkling personality,
however,

2237
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:19,930
but I mean I just like him the way he
says.

2238
01:43:19,931 --> 01:43:21,250
I respect.
He's old school.

2239
01:43:21,251 --> 01:43:24,880
I respect him and blah blah blah.
What's interesting about him to me is

2240
01:43:24,881 --> 01:43:28,960
that he's so boyish and cute looking,
but he's a fucking killer.

2241
01:43:29,290 --> 01:43:31,050
I mean,
you look at the guy he's like,

2242
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:34,030
and he's like,
I bring big drama fight.

2243
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:34,970
He had been threatened.

2244
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:36,790
Yeah.
Big drama show.

2245
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:40,310
It's so strange.
he had a very,

2246
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,480
very special.
Yeah,

2247
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:42,390
he is.
He is.

2248
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,220
Well,
so is kovalev.

2249
01:43:44,440 --> 01:43:46,420
And that's why the andRe ward five
becomes so,

2250
01:43:46,421 --> 01:43:48,790
so intriguing because if he fights the
way,

2251
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:51,010
if andre ward fights away,
fought on saturday night,

2252
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,590
going to have a real hard time with
kobo,

2253
01:43:53,130 --> 01:43:56,870
last fight against chill amber.
It didn't look all that.

2254
01:43:56,871 --> 01:43:58,150
But she'll amber again.
See,

2255
01:43:58,230 --> 01:44:01,100
I think it was fighting in Russia.
There was a lot of pressure on him as

2256
01:44:01,101 --> 01:44:02,180
well,
you know,

2257
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:06,080
I mean fight.
I mean tony bell for him twice from

2258
01:44:06,081 --> 01:44:08,780
england now.
The wbc cruiserweight champion from

2259
01:44:08,781 --> 01:44:11,030
liverpool,
which I remember was the only guy to go

2260
01:44:11,031 --> 01:44:12,590
the distance except hopkins.
Right.

2261
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,600
In recent fights in recent fights.
Yeah.

2262
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,240
Yeah.
I mean I think you dropped something

2263
01:44:17,241 --> 01:44:21,440
round seven.
I think world will fight on the inside.

2264
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,120
I don't think you'll find on the
outside.

2265
01:44:23,120 --> 01:44:25,780
I think you'll find similar to the way
for french.

2266
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,160
I think that's.
That will Be the plan book.

2267
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:31,360
Great fight of flight.
A very,

2268
01:44:31,370 --> 01:44:33,260
very interesting fight where I lack of
award.

2269
01:44:33,290 --> 01:44:36,290
His intelligence.
He's so smart and you hear it when he

2270
01:44:36,291 --> 01:44:37,310
does commentary.
Yeah.

2271
01:44:37,340 --> 01:44:39,010
He's so aware.
Any fights.

2272
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:39,900
So smart.
Yeah.

2273
01:44:40,070 --> 01:44:42,720
He just,
he's just a very clever guy.

2274
01:44:42,721 --> 01:44:45,620
And everything he does,
he makes it awkward.

2275
01:44:45,621 --> 01:44:47,720
He fights different,
almost every fight.

2276
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:51,020
Sometimes he fights in the outside.
Sometimes he sticks to you like glue.

2277
01:44:51,420 --> 01:44:53,640
It's,
he's a very interesting fighter seeing

2278
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:55,800
jim lampley.
I'm asking him questions and he,

2279
01:44:56,110 --> 01:44:58,220
I think he,
he was an addict,

2280
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:00,990
so have some soul and died really
elephant data.

2281
01:45:01,040 --> 01:45:04,370
40 sex.
And his mom was a former drug addicts

2282
01:45:04,371 --> 01:45:06,500
and jim lampley astia and you could see
him like,

2283
01:45:06,501 --> 01:45:07,500
well open,
you know,

2284
01:45:07,540 --> 01:45:11,360
he started crying and stuff and he's
come through shit,

2285
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:12,680
you know,
so you know,

2286
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:13,000
we need.

2287
01:45:13,000 --> 01:45:14,840
He's still quite,
he wants to listen to nothing but

2288
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:17,150
respect for him.
He's amazing and he's,

2289
01:45:17,210 --> 01:45:20,480
he seems,
and I've not met him at like to a very,

2290
01:45:20,481 --> 01:45:23,840
very nice one.
Decent human being.

2291
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,260
When he fought the last time when he
fought on a second.

2292
01:45:27,261 --> 01:45:29,480
I know his first name is [inaudible].
Second name was barrera.

2293
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:34,080
He won't play where he caught it.
He caught the jap chap coat the job for

2294
01:45:34,081 --> 01:45:35,900
a right anD left talk slips on.
Wow.

2295
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:37,590
I mean it was just like,
he's just like,

2296
01:45:37,710 --> 01:45:38,930
he's dancing.
He's liking to.

2297
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:40,840
Hearst is fabulous.
Hawk,

2298
01:45:40,930 --> 01:45:42,470
alo,
kakao indeed.

2299
01:45:45,470 --> 01:45:46,700
Are there any other,
um,

2300
01:45:46,790 --> 01:45:49,760
methods of trying to expand your
peripheral?

2301
01:45:50,160 --> 01:45:53,060
Uh,
basically practice,

2302
01:45:53,510 --> 01:45:55,790
just practice.
So it's just something that you have to

2303
01:45:55,791 --> 01:45:59,780
be aware of.
The closing of the peripheral is also a

2304
01:45:59,781 --> 01:46:04,430
tightening of you and not good.
I would say so.

2305
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:09,710
But you could still focus even with
expanded peripheral yet you could still

2306
01:46:09,711 --> 01:46:13,880
focus on the task at hand.
If you do focus on the task at hand,

2307
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:18,110
he still is still focusing on the task
and hand stride drive is the same,

2308
01:46:18,111 --> 01:46:20,420
isn't it?
I mean if he was just driving and just

2309
01:46:20,421 --> 01:46:22,120
look forward,
you know,

2310
01:46:22,130 --> 01:46:24,290
you wouldn't see anything coming from a
junctIonal.

2311
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:27,110
You still look in the rear view mirror,
don't you?

2312
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,030
even though you're not really going to
get,

2313
01:46:29,720 --> 01:46:31,790
you're not gonna get more often than
not.

2314
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:33,530
You're not going to hit behind unless
you stopped,

2315
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:34,580
you know?
YeAh.

2316
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:37,790
That's the uh,
the stereotype about asians being bad

2317
01:46:37,791 --> 01:46:39,740
drivers.
A friend of mine who's asian tried to

2318
01:46:39,741 --> 01:46:44,480
tell me the reason for that is their
culture when they're in asia,

2319
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:45,241
especially in,
in,

2320
01:46:45,241 --> 01:46:46,250
in,
in China.

2321
01:46:46,520 --> 01:46:48,680
Nobody looks to the left and look to the
right.

2322
01:46:48,681 --> 01:46:50,100
It's like traditional to

2323
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:53,130
look straight ahead and uh,
do you mind your own business?

2324
01:46:53,131 --> 01:46:54,810
Don't be staring,
don't look off to the left.

2325
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:57,900
And so and also they run Into each other
like,

2326
01:46:57,901 --> 01:46:59,700
have you ever been on the streets of
China?

2327
01:46:59,701 --> 01:47:01,680
Apparently according to ari,
they just,

2328
01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:04,560
people just bumping into everybody.
They just bump into each other.

2329
01:47:04,561 --> 01:47:06,630
They're just so used to it.
It's not a rudeness thing.

2330
01:47:07,020 --> 01:47:08,400
It's just,
that's normal to them.

2331
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:11,190
So when they get in their cars,
they kind of do the same thing.

2332
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,110
It looks straight ahead.
They don't look to the left,

2333
01:47:13,111 --> 01:47:14,610
don't look to the right and just plow
ahead.

2334
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,380
Was not good for driving.

2335
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:18,870
I was hustling,
I was in Hong Kong and I was trying to

2336
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:21,180
get a flight service with k one.
It was a disaster,

2337
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:25,320
but I was trying to get the flight from
Hong Kong to grandchild this place and

2338
01:47:25,321 --> 01:47:28,800
they almost took the they desk
explaining the answers,

2339
01:47:28,801 --> 01:47:30,210
get this flight quick.
I was running through the,

2340
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:33,260
I felt like it was intake and I was
wondering about approach and the journey

2341
01:47:33,261 --> 01:47:35,370
is just people's barging in front of you
go,

2342
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:37,520
you know what she goes,
I don't know.

2343
01:47:37,570 --> 01:47:40,740
And then Jeremy Melendez,
kid who I know from a lives in Hong

2344
01:47:40,740 --> 01:47:42,360
Kong,
you were saying that the mainland

2345
01:47:42,361 --> 01:47:43,171
chinese,
uh,

2346
01:47:43,171 --> 01:47:44,880
miles different than the people from
Hong Kong.

2347
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,170
You have a different sort of,
you know,

2348
01:47:47,180 --> 01:47:48,790
um,
values and culture,

2349
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,020
different sort of.
Well,

2350
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,810
Hong Kong was a british empire,
right?

2351
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:54,090
Well still 1999 years.
That's ridiculous.

2352
01:47:54,091 --> 01:47:55,710
Why would they give it back?
Oh no,

2353
01:47:55,830 --> 01:47:57,000
fuck no,
fuck no.

2354
01:47:57,010 --> 01:48:00,570
All toys are made in Hong Kong.
They great.

2355
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:02,490
Yeah.
Well it used to be one thing that

2356
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:04,620
english people do.
They'll say somethIng and you ask a

2357
01:48:04,621 --> 01:48:06,090
question.
He's doing great,

2358
01:48:06,091 --> 01:48:09,450
isn't he?
The welsh do it as well.

2359
01:48:09,451 --> 01:48:10,650
She has a lounge thing.
Yeah.

2360
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:13,080
The wells do though.
I noticed you used to do that a lot.

2361
01:48:13,081 --> 01:48:14,580
Well,
you still do in commentary,

2362
01:48:14,581 --> 01:48:16,590
you'll say something very complImentary
and then you say,

2363
01:48:16,591 --> 01:48:17,670
isn't he?
Yeah,

2364
01:48:17,671 --> 01:48:20,100
I see it isn't even that.
So let's just get an agreement.

2365
01:48:20,820 --> 01:48:23,500
Unless it's we have julie kitchen over
compensate with a lot or garbage

2366
01:48:23,510 --> 01:48:27,260
starrett who would take common site with
your cow that,

2367
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:28,940
you know,
I am asking them for.

2368
01:48:28,941 --> 01:48:30,750
It doesn't need reassurance because I'm
insecure.

2369
01:48:32,660 --> 01:48:35,340
Insecure thing is a blanket that I need
words.

2370
01:48:35,870 --> 01:48:37,430
Again,
going back to what we talked about,

2371
01:48:37,431 --> 01:48:40,730
like language defining things.
It's like you're defining the fact that

2372
01:48:40,731 --> 01:48:44,020
even though you are observing things,
you are,

2373
01:48:44,390 --> 01:48:47,690
you're,
you're being conversational about it and

2374
01:48:47,691 --> 01:48:49,110
you're not being,
you know,

2375
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:53,600
you're not like the authoritarian.
You're not like the authority of all

2376
01:48:53,601 --> 01:48:56,120
information is being passed.
Are you saying you're looking for a

2377
01:48:56,121 --> 01:48:56,780
consensus?

2378
01:48:56,780 --> 01:48:57,613
Yeah,
of course.

2379
01:48:57,890 --> 01:48:59,180
Because when you,
when you come and say it,

2380
01:48:59,181 --> 01:49:00,750
and I know in,
in,

2381
01:49:00,751 --> 01:49:03,260
you know,
I'll come commentary is you've got to be

2382
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:05,360
careful with your language.
You've got to,

2383
01:49:05,361 --> 01:49:09,890
you've got to engage that,
engage the audience to drag them into

2384
01:49:09,891 --> 01:49:12,530
something just in a fight.
You know,

2385
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:14,330
you've got to,
you've got to it.

2386
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:17,670
While I'm bit more spectacular anyway
because I'm a bit high for,

2387
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:18,560
um,
I'm based off,

2388
01:49:18,840 --> 01:49:19,820
you know,
a bit squeaky,

2389
01:49:20,180 --> 01:49:24,710
but I'm like baker off of violet beaker
off the moffitt,

2390
01:49:25,010 --> 01:49:25,800
but it's like,
you know,

2391
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:30,260
you often drug the,
the audience in and I think it's nice.

2392
01:49:30,470 --> 01:49:31,640
Chavela is great.
Attack.

2393
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:32,910
Chavela was gray.
Yeah,

2394
01:49:32,990 --> 01:49:35,060
he's a fantastic.
Yeah.

2395
01:49:35,290 --> 01:49:38,260
It's like a whole litany of phrases that
he loves to use.

2396
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:39,450
Makes you jump.
Yeah.

2397
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:41,090
So you see it makes it,
makes you,

2398
01:49:41,480 --> 01:49:44,450
makes you jump as well.
So he'll say stuff that's on his mind,

2399
01:49:44,451 --> 01:49:46,830
like swearing and.
Yeah.

2400
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,830
For to know.
We're talking,

2401
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:47,980
we're

2402
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,060
talking about my friend michael chavela
who does commentary for access tv.

2403
01:49:52,330 --> 01:49:56,470
He does lion fight,
which is the premier organization in the

2404
01:49:56,471 --> 01:49:59,440
United States,
at least for moitai and the rest of the

2405
01:49:59,441 --> 01:50:01,540
world that she aka.
Yeah.

2406
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:05,260
That sold with the sixth liam harrison
fights.

2407
01:50:05,261 --> 01:50:09,730
Fabio pinker who soda is the,
a conor mcgregor and nate diaz.

2408
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:10,810
Pharaohs.
Yeah.

2409
01:50:10,811 --> 01:50:14,760
That's,
it's to me stunning that moitai isn't

2410
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:18,280
more popular worldwide,
but boxing is more.

2411
01:50:18,281 --> 01:50:20,530
Thai is so much more exciting than
boxing.

2412
01:50:20,830 --> 01:50:22,630
There's so many more variables.
It's so,

2413
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:27,130
so many more ways to win.
It's so much more effective and it's

2414
01:50:27,131 --> 01:50:31,400
just brilliant to watch.
When you watch a guy like sam chai or

2415
01:50:31,401 --> 01:50:34,150
yachts and cli or someone,
all the greats book cow,

2416
01:50:34,510 --> 01:50:39,510
you watch these guys fight and the
artistry and the beautiful techniques

2417
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:44,590
and moves and also the excitement,
the excitement of more tie.

2418
01:50:44,591 --> 01:50:46,300
It's just so spectAcular.

2419
01:50:47,110 --> 01:50:49,090
Some sunshine law,
oliver,

2420
01:50:49,750 --> 01:50:50,583
but he's like,
you know,

2421
01:50:50,590 --> 01:50:51,190
we'd,
we'd.

2422
01:50:51,190 --> 01:50:56,190
Liam knows we a big fanboy of lee and he
brings a stone.

2423
01:50:57,030 --> 01:51:01,300
Never really.
It never leaves anything behind a brings

2424
01:51:01,301 --> 01:51:03,160
a stone.
I don't tell him what a state is going

2425
01:51:03,161 --> 01:51:03,994
to be.
Wicked account.

2426
01:51:04,590 --> 01:51:07,080
I'm sweating in the hands.
Start sweating and own salsa.

2427
01:51:07,120 --> 01:51:10,300
So childish.
I really do need to grow uP and get a

2428
01:51:10,301 --> 01:51:11,640
proper job.
no,

2429
01:51:11,680 --> 01:51:13,890
you don't.
I'm sanchez.

2430
01:51:13,930 --> 01:51:15,340
Interesting too,
because he's.

2431
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:19,440
He's really light on his feet.
He fights different than most ties.

2432
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:23,590
Like he fights on the balls of the feet,
almost exclusively utilize a lot of

2433
01:51:23,591 --> 01:51:26,350
front side kicks,
like sort of a hat.

2434
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:31,380
It's like half tepe kick have front leg
side keeps you off balance a lot more,

2435
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:34,240
but ron isn't,
I mean sunshine I think was trying to

2436
01:51:34,241 --> 01:51:39,190
originally by a guy called some rock
come sing who won an olympic gold medal

2437
01:51:39,370 --> 01:51:41,050
as well,
and he's got a very flamboyant,

2438
01:51:41,051 --> 01:51:43,300
sent naked,
amazing skilled.

2439
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:45,130
Does that.
The guY that was supposed to fight john

2440
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:46,960
claude van damme was the one in las
vegas.

2441
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:50,170
Yeah.
Him that was never going to happen.

2442
01:51:50,171 --> 01:51:51,190
Right.
And um,

2443
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,700
he,
he was east.

2444
01:51:52,701 --> 01:51:53,534
So,
um,

2445
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:54,401
uh,
again,

2446
01:51:54,401 --> 01:51:57,000
he's aware but he's rock hard as well.
I mean,

2447
01:51:57,001 --> 01:52:00,640
you think he's just messing about,
but he's robbing me and I'm watching

2448
01:52:00,660 --> 01:52:01,750
again watching him.
Liam.

2449
01:52:02,110 --> 01:52:04,540
Liam smashed.
He's from like tibet and he's just had a

2450
01:52:04,550 --> 01:52:07,240
counter as well as kicking them as odd
as a coach.

2451
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:09,700
And he's still still,
he's a.

2452
01:52:09,701 --> 01:52:11,050
yeah,
he's a very special.

2453
01:52:11,170 --> 01:52:12,740
He's thIrty,
he's 36.

2454
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,310
He's not,
he's not getting any younger.

2455
01:52:15,650 --> 01:52:19,300
He just got involved in a mma.
He's been training.

2456
01:52:19,301 --> 01:52:21,730
There's some videos of him doing arm
bars and stuff.

2457
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:25,180
It's interesting because you gotta
wonder like if that's what he's deciding

2458
01:52:25,181 --> 01:52:27,100
to do.
And he fights all the time.

2459
01:52:27,101 --> 01:52:27,550
Yeah.

2460
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:31,360
That's the other thing.
Like I follow him on instagram and chai

2461
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:33,400
will have this thing like about to
fight,

2462
01:52:33,460 --> 01:52:34,800
smile,
smile,

2463
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:37,120
fist,
bicep.

2464
01:52:37,180 --> 01:52:38,650
He's fighting.
No emojis.

2465
01:52:38,680 --> 01:52:41,730
Some of the 11th in england because you
want to again,

2466
01:52:41,740 --> 01:52:44,040
kit mentioned kevin kettle and he's,
they just sell.

2467
01:52:44,050 --> 01:52:45,860
But um,
charlie peters,

2468
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:49,130
he's fighting charlie while he fights,
you know,

2469
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:51,140
at least six times a year.
Easy,

2470
01:52:51,330 --> 01:52:54,560
easy say hey,
fault and gloria didn't he in amsterdam

2471
01:52:55,270 --> 01:52:58,340
one.
And that's kickboxing roles without the

2472
01:52:58,341 --> 01:52:59,990
clench.
Without elbows.

2473
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:01,040
Yep.
Which is,

2474
01:53:01,340 --> 01:53:02,820
it's interesting that they chose those
rules.

2475
01:53:02,821 --> 01:53:04,850
I don't,
I'm not a big fan of that.

2476
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:07,910
I'm a big fan of the organization,
but I like elbows.

2477
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:09,040
I think elbows are.
I mean,

2478
01:53:09,050 --> 01:53:10,430
look,
if you can kick some in the head why?

2479
01:53:10,540 --> 01:53:11,270
Yeah.
Album,

2480
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:14,270
it's very effective when we're talking
about moitai.

2481
01:53:14,590 --> 01:53:15,421
Like why,
why,

2482
01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:17,030
why limit it,
you know,

2483
01:53:17,031 --> 01:53:19,970
why allow like leg kicks,
knees the head,

2484
01:53:20,030 --> 01:53:22,070
head kicks,
but don't allow elbows.

2485
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:25,790
That seems to me to be a little weird
thing that one thing that keeps keeps

2486
01:53:25,791 --> 01:53:29,570
more tie back is the traditional side of
it,

2487
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:32,190
which I love.
I love my crew,

2488
01:53:32,290 --> 01:53:36,700
my crew,
the can on the hand hold it back though

2489
01:53:36,910 --> 01:53:38,700
because people,
this is my opinion.

2490
01:53:38,701 --> 01:53:39,940
I may be wrong,
but he's like,

2491
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:41,690
you know,
people will sit there and they get the

2492
01:53:41,691 --> 01:53:44,390
bear or whatever and they come in and
they watch the fights and then they just

2493
01:53:44,391 --> 01:53:44,950
say,
well on.

2494
01:53:44,950 --> 01:53:47,660
He said we are a funder of martial arts
so you're not going to really see what

2495
01:53:47,661 --> 01:53:49,190
they see,
but I can see it from a,

2496
01:53:49,410 --> 01:53:49,900
you know,
what's that?

2497
01:53:49,900 --> 01:53:52,010
It's got a nice head for and what's up
music.

2498
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:56,990
Why they done seen was odd and also the
music while they're actually fighting is

2499
01:53:56,991 --> 01:53:59,060
a little odd.
But if you watched it you wouldn't hear

2500
01:53:59,061 --> 01:53:59,330
it.

2501
01:53:59,330 --> 01:54:00,810
I don't hear it.
Yeah,

2502
01:54:00,830 --> 01:54:01,700
I was,
you know,

2503
01:54:01,701 --> 01:54:03,980
and if you listen for it,
you obviously eric's focus,

2504
01:54:04,490 --> 01:54:08,450
but I love it only so great fight is
coming through and in england and

2505
01:54:08,451 --> 01:54:13,451
everywhere else and great things up with
will thai boxing council at thai boxing

2506
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:16,730
association at brian dell was involved
in loads of stuff coming through.

2507
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:19,880
she's good.
Your cow and you know and lights said

2508
01:54:19,881 --> 01:54:22,340
lion fight him on barlow.
He's one of my friends.

2509
01:54:22,341 --> 01:54:24,110
She's fighting a lion fight.
She's amazing.

2510
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:27,170
She's fighting so she will love her.
Yeah,

2511
01:54:27,190 --> 01:54:27,661
I'm,
I'm,

2512
01:54:27,661 --> 01:54:30,740
I'm just happy to.
Lion fight exists because it seems like

2513
01:54:30,741 --> 01:54:35,240
there's so few organizations that are
showing high level more tiny United

2514
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:37,190
States.
I mean if it wasn't for mark cuban's

2515
01:54:37,191 --> 01:54:39,380
access tv,
it's like there's not,

2516
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:41,470
there's not any other options.
Mia,

2517
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:43,610
there's some good fight as a gust on
bolinas.

2518
01:54:43,670 --> 01:54:44,260
Very gOod.

2519
01:54:44,260 --> 01:54:45,410
I like him.
He's great.

2520
01:54:45,411 --> 01:54:48,250
He's only other fee for us.
He's rock hard and he think he's six,

2521
01:54:48,290 --> 01:54:51,290
six and won.
He lost one fight and it was a very

2522
01:54:51,291 --> 01:54:54,380
highly disputed decision law against the
tie content,

2523
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:59,270
but
it's difficult.

2524
01:54:59,271 --> 01:55:03,980
I've watched it once and it's close
enough to watch it again to really

2525
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:05,870
solve,
analyze it by like his style.

2526
01:55:05,900 --> 01:55:08,840
I liked it.
Comes for his fight and he's only had a

2527
01:55:08,841 --> 01:55:10,480
few fights.
I think.

2528
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:13,190
Hopefully you'll be fine.
You'll find in england and soon enough.

2529
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:16,340
Yeah,
and of course Kevin Ross who said very

2530
01:55:16,341 --> 01:55:18,040
fun to watch too.
Yeah,

2531
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:20,060
he's.
He's highly skilled and zoya.

2532
01:55:20,100 --> 01:55:24,700
Frau is fighting and glory and he's
Kevin Ross has also funny and build

2533
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:26,150
toward kickbox too,
right?

2534
01:55:26,240 --> 01:55:26,930
Yeah.
Please.

2535
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:30,030
Just seeing these sudanese last one and
he's still a little bit more tight.

2536
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:34,120
It's very difficult to fight that style,
but I will obviously is.

2537
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:37,010
We have a good gym,
so the transition not transition.

2538
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:40,190
Isn't it funny that the two most people
that it looks like the same thing.

2539
01:55:40,250 --> 01:55:41,870
They'll look at it like whAt's the
difference?

2540
01:55:42,050 --> 01:55:45,450
And you know the.
The clench is a big factor in the elbows

2541
01:55:45,451 --> 01:55:46,980
are a big fan of the stance as well.
The,

2542
01:55:46,981 --> 01:55:48,240
the pace,
the stands,

2543
01:55:48,720 --> 01:55:52,650
you know giorgio petrosyan,
you could find some way tie style,

2544
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:56,970
but he can eat adopted the rules very
well because of his boxing skill.

2545
01:55:57,130 --> 01:55:59,040
How,
what does Georgia up to now he's

2546
01:55:59,041 --> 01:56:02,130
fighting soon in ballot or I don't know
why,

2547
01:56:02,160 --> 01:56:06,210
because he had that one devastating loss
to devastate you and diversity is

2548
01:56:06,211 --> 01:56:08,220
amazing.
production up close.

2549
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:13,110
I've never seen anybody like that.
Just slips shots and just luns and when

2550
01:56:13,111 --> 01:56:14,660
he hits,
when he lands with these countless,

2551
01:56:14,670 --> 01:56:16,800
they're not.
They're not soft delight,

2552
01:56:16,850 --> 01:56:19,230
whack.
You know you're in a position where you

2553
01:56:19,231 --> 01:56:20,580
can't hit him and he can hit you.

2554
01:56:20,860 --> 01:56:24,270
He's just poetry.
Emotion is absolutely super interesting

2555
01:56:24,271 --> 01:56:27,930
too because it is not like some physical
specimen or anything like that.

2556
01:56:27,931 --> 01:56:31,830
It's just an average guy,
but she's a very intelligent approach to

2557
01:56:32,160 --> 01:56:36,660
finding how color
is eyesight.

2558
01:56:36,710 --> 01:56:40,770
I mean these nobody's high site is
because he's so focused on what he does

2559
01:56:40,950 --> 01:56:44,220
and even what you're trained in,
everything is specific is a south pole

2560
01:56:44,221 --> 01:56:46,510
as well,
which you kind of limit the shots or

2561
01:56:46,511 --> 01:56:49,740
what you can at the south pole with you
know our sap or connect you with an

2562
01:56:49,741 --> 01:56:51,390
east.
Just got that down to a fine art and

2563
01:56:51,391 --> 01:56:54,660
so's marciel.
He says they've got that to a fine art

2564
01:56:54,661 --> 01:56:56,040
that the account was at yoga and for all
the,

2565
01:56:56,041 --> 01:56:58,200
all the,
they've seen it lots and lots of times.

2566
01:56:58,201 --> 01:57:02,370
Whereas if you haven't spotted lots of
samples and spent time with them than it

2567
01:57:02,371 --> 01:57:04,540
is difficult for you to adjust to,
you know,

2568
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:08,230
white cubans,
you have so many pass because of the

2569
01:57:09,420 --> 01:57:09,900
styles.

2570
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:12,590
Difficult to contend with sometimes.
Yeah.

2571
01:57:12,600 --> 01:57:15,420
It is funny that more people don't do
it.

2572
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:19,320
They don't compete as a southpaw.
There's a lot of teachers that are

2573
01:57:19,321 --> 01:57:21,660
starting to teach,
like emmanuel steward was doing that

2574
01:57:21,661 --> 01:57:26,220
towards the end days was a teaching guys
to fight with their strong hand forward.

2575
01:57:26,221 --> 01:57:28,680
So he's taking right handers and having
to fight southpaws.

2576
01:57:29,370 --> 01:57:33,630
Yeah.
Well the cutouts are left handed or left

2577
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:36,780
handed off.
A duck's Delaware is lefthanded fight in

2578
01:57:36,781 --> 01:57:39,120
an orthodox stance.
So he'd have his left arm,

2579
01:57:39,121 --> 01:57:41,340
which is his dominant hand forward.
Andre ward.

2580
01:57:41,770 --> 01:57:44,790
He's lefthanded,
but I don't know whether

2581
01:57:46,290 --> 01:57:47,880
or not.
It's interesting though,

2582
01:57:47,881 --> 01:57:49,740
isn't it,
to make that decision to use your

2583
01:57:49,741 --> 01:57:53,100
dominant hand as your front hand when
everybody else uses it as the power hand

2584
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:54,420
the backhand.
Yeah,

2585
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:57,350
I mean,
I don't know,

2586
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:59,520
it feels a bit,
but then again it would feel weird if

2587
01:57:59,521 --> 01:58:00,150
you don't do it.

2588
01:58:00,150 --> 01:58:02,000
This is like anything.
It's everything feels weird.

2589
01:58:02,010 --> 01:58:03,690
ReMember the first time you tried to
throw a left hook,

2590
01:58:03,770 --> 01:58:04,510
you're like,
what?

2591
01:58:04,510 --> 01:58:06,870
Yeah,
I'm lefthanded anyway.

2592
01:58:06,910 --> 01:58:08,130
Sorry.
Yeah,

2593
01:58:08,140 --> 01:58:11,000
so he's.
He's always been so always been a right

2594
01:58:11,001 --> 01:58:13,710
hook first year,
but I remember first time throwing a

2595
01:58:13,711 --> 01:58:16,080
hook,
thinking like what a bizarre way to

2596
01:58:16,081 --> 01:58:19,290
generate power and now it's second
nature.

2597
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:22,260
Now it just feels like you just,
you know it.

2598
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:25,970
Your body just moves that way.
I think john wayne pass lefthanded.

2599
01:58:26,200 --> 01:58:28,250
Izzy,
can you watch you on every doc?

2600
01:58:28,251 --> 01:58:31,770
He's lucky he's left kick,
but he trained with santee and noi for

2601
01:58:31,771 --> 01:58:35,720
many years and sanction knows something.
He knows his alphabet.

2602
01:58:36,030 --> 01:58:36,970
Joan,
my passcode.

2603
01:58:37,260 --> 01:58:38,160
Great.
Left cake.

2604
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:41,890
Yeah,
we're slowly starting to see real high

2605
01:58:41,891 --> 01:58:46,891
level more thai fighters compete in mma
and really more so in women's mma and I

2606
01:58:47,171 --> 01:58:50,080
mean we have a lot of high level people
in the men's mma of course,

2607
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:53,050
But in women's mma to on jacob.

2608
01:58:56,570 --> 01:58:57,850
What am I saying?
Her name?

2609
01:58:57,851 --> 01:59:00,910
Right?
You wanna young,

2610
01:59:01,870 --> 01:59:02,910
young jay.
Check.

2611
01:59:02,920 --> 01:59:04,360
Why am I saying it wrong though?
Young,

2612
01:59:05,260 --> 01:59:06,660
young jet.
Check,

2613
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:08,763
check.
Yeah,

2614
01:59:09,190 --> 01:59:11,460
but why am I saying it wrong?
It's one of those words were,

2615
01:59:11,461 --> 01:59:13,140
if you don't,
if you don't say it for a couple of

2616
01:59:13,141 --> 01:59:14,920
days,
you go back to it and go.

2617
01:59:14,921 --> 01:59:19,090
You want everybody says yohanna to which
actually you want to young jay check

2618
01:59:19,670 --> 01:59:20,503
thing.
I'm saying it right.

2619
01:59:21,100 --> 01:59:23,650
Feel off.
It's so different between the way she

2620
01:59:23,651 --> 01:59:24,940
says it.
She says it.

2621
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:25,391
You're like,
ooh,

2622
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:27,340
I don't even know if I can make that
noise in my face.

2623
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:30,700
You see why questions things?
See,

2624
01:59:30,701 --> 01:59:32,410
here's the thing.
When you look at it right there,

2625
01:59:32,440 --> 01:59:35,030
first of all,
what the fuck is going on with that?

2626
01:59:35,310 --> 01:59:38,740
Why is that?
He have a goatee like that does not help

2627
01:59:38,741 --> 01:59:39,370
me at all.

2628
01:59:39,370 --> 01:59:42,290
Like if she's.
If you pull up her name and you make me

2629
01:59:42,291 --> 01:59:44,710
re say her name or it doesn't help me at
all,

2630
01:59:45,130 --> 01:59:47,410
but whatever.
She's fucking awesome.

2631
01:59:47,470 --> 01:59:48,490
Which she is,
is.

2632
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:51,790
She's really incredible like her.
Her,

2633
01:59:51,820 --> 01:59:56,820
her technique or jab is just vicious.
She steps forward and blast that stiff

2634
01:59:57,941 --> 02:00:01,510
jab on girls.
Her front kicks her round,

2635
02:00:01,511 --> 02:00:03,970
kicks her,
her elbows when she's defending

2636
02:00:04,090 --> 02:00:06,280
takedowns,
her clinch work.

2637
02:00:06,340 --> 02:00:07,630
May god,
she's good.

2638
02:00:08,020 --> 02:00:11,560
She's so good.
She's one of the most technical strikers

2639
02:00:11,561 --> 02:00:14,500
in any division and she's in women's
mma.

2640
02:00:14,501 --> 02:00:16,390
Of course.
Volunteership chanko of course,

2641
02:00:16,391 --> 02:00:20,770
very,
very accomplished moy thai fighter who's

2642
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:23,900
now fighting in women's mma.
Yeah.

2643
02:00:23,920 --> 02:00:25,780
There's some good coaches coming.
Frivolous.

2644
02:00:25,810 --> 02:00:27,650
Bryan pope,
jelly as well from boxing.

2645
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:30,530
He's really good.
I watched him on patsy of the day and he

2646
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:32,600
what he's doing,
he's a good.

2647
02:00:32,610 --> 02:00:35,710
He's a good coach.
Go to the elbows and good with timing

2648
02:00:35,711 --> 02:00:36,770
and all that sort of business.

2649
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:41,320
what do you think that more time needs
in order to become as popular in the

2650
02:00:41,321 --> 02:00:43,600
United States as it is in other parts of
the world?

2651
02:00:44,150 --> 02:00:45,670
You a chance,
right?

2652
02:00:45,760 --> 02:00:48,100
Accounts.
It's not fun.

2653
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:51,180
It's not as if they got not got decent
people with it.

2654
02:00:51,570 --> 02:00:55,870
I'm here because let's say joe,
sheldon and amy can come in here with

2655
02:00:55,871 --> 02:00:56,531
you,
which is brilliant.

2656
02:00:56,531 --> 02:00:59,250
Thanks very much,
but I've come to see brian doebele from

2657
02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:02,400
wls,
my tie and east east full face light,

2658
02:01:02,740 --> 02:01:05,140
million miles an hour of everything.
And where's that?

2659
02:01:05,460 --> 02:01:07,440
Uh,
in fontana and uh,

2660
02:01:07,500 --> 02:01:09,350
in California and they,
you know,

2661
02:01:10,060 --> 02:01:11,530
the,
I've got the talent.

2662
02:01:11,620 --> 02:01:13,360
It's just a chance.
I actually don't know.

2663
02:01:13,361 --> 02:01:16,870
I think he's a lot of politics involved
or you know,

2664
02:01:16,871 --> 02:01:19,570
they're not getting the smokers have
been a band,

2665
02:01:19,870 --> 02:01:20,471
you know,
the,

2666
02:01:20,471 --> 02:01:21,304
the,
uh,

2667
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:22,373
qualified.
Yeah,

2668
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:24,940
we call them into clips.
They're banned everywhere.

2669
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:27,070
California,
I think California,

2670
02:01:27,071 --> 02:01:30,970
which is unfortunate because our,
they're going to get experience.

2671
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:32,470
They're not,
but they're also,

2672
02:01:32,471 --> 02:01:35,680
they're not going to die.
That's all people were worried about was

2673
02:01:35,860 --> 02:01:38,170
some of it.
Some people were being unethical and

2674
02:01:38,171 --> 02:01:43,171
they're smokers or they didn't have a
proper medical staff on think someone

2675
02:01:43,281 --> 02:01:47,840
got hurt and an mma smoker.
And I think that they kind of polluted

2676
02:01:47,841 --> 02:01:49,920
everything a bit loud.
People get hurt in the gym,

2677
02:01:50,630 --> 02:01:54,230
the gym in the washing machine.
But I'd love it to have a chance.

2678
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:57,200
I think it should be bigger in the
United States and they need to

2679
02:01:57,220 --> 02:02:00,320
compensate from england by the way.
I agree,

2680
02:02:00,500 --> 02:02:03,110
I really do think that it should be
bigger than the United States and I do

2681
02:02:03,111 --> 02:02:05,900
think that it's not something that's.
It's not like cricket,

2682
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:09,470
like good luck selling that,
but it's something that's universally

2683
02:02:09,471 --> 02:02:11,540
exciting.
I know you guys will enjoy cricket.

2684
02:02:11,570 --> 02:02:13,670
I don't even.
I don't even know what it means.

2685
02:02:14,150 --> 02:02:17,420
I don't even know anything about it.
Congratulations this far.

2686
02:02:17,450 --> 02:02:19,970
I'll football or american football or
baseball league,

2687
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:23,630
but moitai is universally exciting.
If you watch it,

2688
02:02:23,631 --> 02:02:27,920
it's universally exciting and in my
opinion it's one of the most effective

2689
02:02:27,921 --> 02:02:30,950
combat sports and as itself as an
individual unit.

2690
02:02:31,160 --> 02:02:32,400
Yeah.
Y'all call.

2691
02:02:32,630 --> 02:02:35,350

2698
02:02:45,951 --> 02:02:48,710
They're amazing.

2699
02:02:48,711 --> 02:02:49,730

but I really appreciate you coming down
here.

2705

Again,
I learn a lot every time I talk to you

2706
02:03:05,211 --> 02:03:10,040
and I think people do as well and to
appreciate the timeline therapy and if

2707
02:03:10,041 --> 02:03:12,400
people want to get ahold of you,
how did they do that?
