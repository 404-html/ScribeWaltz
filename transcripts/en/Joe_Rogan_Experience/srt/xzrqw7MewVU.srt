1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,780
Try by day Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,790
That's what's scary.

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:06,481
Not Scary.

4
00:00:06,481 --> 00:00:08,370
But to me it's just to see
what happens with Jon Jones.

5
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:08,910
Yeah.

6
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,140
Cause now they suspended for a year.

7
00:00:10,141 --> 00:00:10,650
Right.

8
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,390
And he's been out even longer.

9
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:13,351
And then before that,

10
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,240
so they're stripping and
style and then Dana obviously,

11
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:15,580
you know,

12
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,040
he never sticks to what he says.

13
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:18,871
Sometimes he does,

14
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,680
but he goes,

15
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,960
I'll never be a main event again.

16
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:24,810
Like we can't bill book him as the
main event because we can't trust them

17
00:00:24,811 --> 00:00:25,380
anymore.

18
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,100
Wow.

19
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,401
I know.

20
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:26,820
Right.

21
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,660
So for John,

22
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:28,620
granted he's doing that,

23
00:00:28,621 --> 00:00:32,070
that flow grappling event
against the fuck out of here.

24
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,190
That flow grappling.

25
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:35,160
He could have been fighting
for the UFC heavyweight title.

26
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:35,551
Oh No,

27
00:00:35,551 --> 00:00:38,880
I'm just saying Lisa Jones some active
like at least he's not Muhammad Ali.

28
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,321
Yeah,

29
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:40,680
I guess he's lost millions of dollars,

30
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:45,660
but at least he's doing something in
combat sport or he's only suspended for a

31
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,470
year retroactively.

32
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,130
It's July.

33
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,963
It's up in July.

34
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:48,451
Yeah.

35
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,700
So he has to get but still got a while.

36
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,800
Cause we married before I
did that huge laugh before.

37
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:55,170
You'll see 200 so when he comes back,

38
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,870
it's interesting to see
what we get out of it.

39
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,331
I know.

40
00:00:57,331 --> 00:01:00,510
And then he came back and he fought
over in saint proof and you know,

41
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:00,721
look,

42
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:01,351
kind of tentative.

43
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:05,070
And then you saw Jimmy Manoir run
through over in Saint [inaudible].

44
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,630
All these guys are getting better.

45
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,583
They're getting better,

46
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:08,970
they're rising up and you know,

47
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,760
rumble rumbles fight in
DC for the title again.

48
00:01:11,761 --> 00:01:13,320
That's going to be a
real interesting fight.

49
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:14,280
Super interesting.

50
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,200
You remember rumble did land
that huge shark you see in them?

51
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,601
Yeah.

52
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,230
Who knows?

53
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:19,771
In this fight,

54
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,240
he's got Neil Melanzane in his corner now.

55
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:22,560
He's had them for a few years now.

56
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,690
He's worked with a lot on his grappling.

57
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,000
He guaranteed was concentrated
a lot more as wrestling.

58
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,380
There's a lot of videos of him running,

59
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,071
wrestling drills,

60
00:01:29,071 --> 00:01:29,431
wrestling,

61
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,100
nonstop.

62
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,140
So he's preparing,

63
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,040
he's preparing to get up.

64
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,570
It's preparing for takedown defense,

65
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,141
fun fight,

66
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:34,410
man.

67
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,450
It's a toss up for me.

68
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,503
Toss up.

69
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,160
And then Jon Jones has all this laugh.

70
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,540
It comes back and he would say,

71
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,800
rumble for a reason.

72
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,130
Wins.

73
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:41,400
He's like,

74
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,120
what's up man?

75
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,301
Yeah.

76
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:42,900
Let's do it.

77
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,111
Well,

78
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:45,150
why do you think he's going to
get a straight shot at the title?

79
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:47,760
I don't even think know if it would get
a straight shot at the title and upon

80
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:48,580
coming back.

81
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:48,930
You don't.

82
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,730
He must like everyone
wants to see the in it.

83
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,470
Maybe that's why fans demand.

84
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,940
It might be something going on by then.

85
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:57,390
By the time this time rolls around
next year or July rolls around,

86
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,343
so he's gonna.

87
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,550
He's free in July.

88
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:00,384
Whether that means,

89
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:00,571
see,

90
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,890
I don't know how suspensions work,

91
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:06,220
but what I would had been explained
to me is performance enhancing drug

92
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:10,530
suspensions don't even allow you to train
with other fighters are on the roster.

93
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:11,700
Really?

94
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,240
Yes.

95
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,470
When your suspension is up,

96
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,610
then you can train with them.

97
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,620
I don't think you're even supposed to be
sparring with them once they hand down

98
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:19,171
and suspension.

99
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,250
How that regulation,

100
00:02:20,251 --> 00:02:21,330
do they know about that man,

101
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,080
look that up,

102
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:23,570
Jamie.

103
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,241
Think that's true.

104
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,170
Wrap this up soon.

105
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:25,441
Yeah.

106
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:26,400
I don't think that's true.

107
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,090
I hope it's not because it's crazy
because you could help your teammates,

108
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:31,080
even if you're suspended,

109
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:34,080
you could still train and help your team
and also sharpen your sword a little

110
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:34,311
bit.

111
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:34,441
Yeah.

112
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:35,850
It's like telling a guy
who was an accountant.

113
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:36,810
You're suspended for a year.

114
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:40,650
He can't even touch a calculator
when he's touching calculators.

115
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:41,371
Yeah.

116
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:42,210
He's going to touch on,

117
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,460
yeah,

118
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:42,940
go ahead.

119
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,650
Does that Tia Tia 83 Texas instrument?

120
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,300
Uh,

121
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,450
no.

122
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,880
They used to make them
have them in school.

123
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,460
Remember those?

124
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,580
Now it's now your phones.

125
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,343
Rq later.

126
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,273
It's fine.

127
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,940
Three was like a fucking elongated game.

128
00:02:59,290 --> 00:02:59,440
Yeah.

129
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,000
Like the calculator business man,

130
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:01,834
they took a hit.

131
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,660
There are no longer rent.

132
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:05,930
Who's buying calculus?

133
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:07,030
They're like blockbuster.

134
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,290
There's none of them left.

135
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,140
Man's over gain.

136
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,590
Jamie,

137
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,423
see anything.

138
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,260
The first article I clicked
on was the one from last year,

139
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,430
so I don't think so.

140
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,720
But if the other thing to your
point where you don't think he'll,

141
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,311
who says,

142
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,144
we'll get a title shot?

143
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,373
The lightweight,

144
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,860
uh,

145
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,870
the light heavyweight
division is just El dinosaurs.

146
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,500
Besides the top few guys.

147
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,760
There are so old.

148
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:28,391
John's like,

149
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,490
I'm not fucking fight.

150
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,060
And show gun again.

151
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,340
I don't know how dare you buy it again.

152
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,040
But Jimmy man was a very dangerous
fight for anybody right now.

153
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,700
He's a dangerous fight for John
to the man was clearly not.

154
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,840
You are reaching Matt Matt
on what lit up a OVN St Pru.

155
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,240
You see what happened
when he fought gusts?

156
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:46,930
When he got cracked?

157
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,261
Yeah.

158
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,820
Do you see what happened
when he fought rumble?

159
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,691
He got cracked.

160
00:03:49,691 --> 00:03:51,320
He got dealt with up restaurant.

161
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,570
He hadn't dealt with.

162
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:52,751
Right.

163
00:03:52,751 --> 00:03:53,351
It's part of the game.

164
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:57,250
Well Ovince saint [inaudible] just went
fucking the full distance with Jon Jones

165
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,600
and a tough fight with a sleepy.

166
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:00,940
John Jones had a broken arm.

167
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:01,870
Yeah.

168
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,630
Got His arm broken.

169
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,540
That broke that arm by throwing kicks.

170
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:04,930
Right?

171
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:05,051
Yeah.

172
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:08,800
But my point is he went the distance
and St Crute took them out pretty quick.

173
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,900
I think he's dying or I think,

174
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,800
and not saying per rather,

175
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,190
uh,

176
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,540
Jimmy man and what took
them out pretty quick.

177
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,430
I think Madden was super dangerous,

178
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,500
very dangerous.

179
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,840
Striking first round for
John has come back fight.

180
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,720
I think taking him down and
beating him up on the ground.

181
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,610
Be John's best 100% he's a trip.

182
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,391
I'm thrown to the ground.

183
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,224
It's a metal.

184
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,930
Also John's different than anybody else
in his length and is a bit tough to use

185
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:30,050
it.

186
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,210
It doesn't get hit really.

187
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,520
And his wrestling so fucking good.

188
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,001
Yeah.

189
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:35,770
He's just so scared.

190
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,930
Not scared to go to the
ground with anybody,

191
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,850
but you look at light,

192
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,783
light,

193
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,100
heavyweight division is
hurting the most out of anyone.

194
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:46,060
I think you could go down the Russia God
dog and we need some new blood in this

195
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:46,570
bitch.

196
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:46,781
Yeah,

197
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,320
you might be right about the,

198
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,420
the main event in Brazil
is Ryan Bader rivers.

199
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,920
Little Nog little dogs.

200
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:53,060
Like,

201
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,800
I'll fucking do it.

202
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,250
Y'All do what?

203
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,560
I've been fighting for 35 years,

204
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:56,730
you know,

205
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,700
when is a little night move?

206
00:04:57,701 --> 00:04:58,930
Like a goddamn toward us,

207
00:04:58,931 --> 00:04:59,800
but if you want to pay me,

208
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,634
I'll still do it.

209
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,300
He hasn't taken a same amount of
punishment that his brother has,

210
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:06,310
but he's taken some big law knockouts.

211
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:06,521
Yeah.

212
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:06,760
Hope,

213
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,110
hope,

214
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,630
hope neighborhoods.

215
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,060
So could you knocked him out with a risk?

216
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:10,363
My God,

217
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,530
he like clothes line down.

218
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,703
Yeah.

219
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,500
And then the rumble one was
just horrendous to suit.

220
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,010
I told you I was in the
back of the locker room,

221
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,750
uh,

222
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,870
warming up Pat Cummings.

223
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,220
I'm a fucker warmed up,

224
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,040
but basically doing like arm
stretches couldn't hit mitts.

225
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:24,874
He was so stiff.

226
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,421
I was like,

227
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,254
who's he fighting?

228
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,150
Like rumbles like,

229
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,820
ah,

230
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,750
he can't go out there.

231
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,281
I looked at his coach,

232
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:30,491
I'm like,

233
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:31,324
no,

234
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:31,751
no,

235
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:32,650
I can't speak Spanish,

236
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,350
but no Bueno or Portuguese,

237
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:35,621
sorry.

238
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:35,801
Yeah,

239
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:36,120
the,

240
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,020
there's no commute.

241
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,140
Like he can't go out to man.

242
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,620
I wanted to grab his leg
like a three year old,

243
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,400
not let them walk out
the side of the octagon.

244
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:46,090
I think Brazil is such a huge
hotbed for MMA right now.

245
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,380
It's so gigantic that they need
Brazilian stars and you know,

246
00:05:50,381 --> 00:05:51,970
for the main event in particular,

247
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:52,271
they're like,

248
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,910
just don't have a whole lot of options
in the light heavyweight division.

249
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:59,000
So someone fucking wake up a little
nug out of his slumber cause he's

250
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,630
recuperating a little log or big
nog little nug cause they're,

251
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,460
they're waking up as slumber cause
little big Nog is done right.

252
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,390
He's the little Nog they woke his
ass up and he's like Alpha Phi Beta.

253
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:08,661
I mean,

254
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:08,870
yeah,

255
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,150
I mean he's probably
asking for another fight,

256
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:12,350
but outside of him.

257
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,610
What other good light heavyweights from
Brazil that are in the UFC that you

258
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:17,630
could like sell a main event?

259
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:18,480
Our clover.

260
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:18,800
Yeah,

261
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,700
but they already fought.

262
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,091
Right.

263
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:24,380
But glow over just got cracked too and
he should probably take quite a while off

264
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,340
after that knock out.

265
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,920
That was a kind of knock out that
you need to like not do nothing.

266
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,300
Lay Low.

267
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,601
Yeah,

268
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,490
he got flat line.

269
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:30,950
I mean,

270
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,010
so you've got that light heavy.

271
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,870
You got Shogun,

272
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:33,730
which I don't know what's going on.

273
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,850
Shoguns gotta be done.

274
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:35,811
If he's not done,

275
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:38,210
he's probably real close to being this
what I'm saying like at light heavyweight

276
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:38,451
broke,

277
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,640
go through name in Brazil though.

278
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,690
Even more so like as far as like
Brazilian fighters as far as fame.

279
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,440
Fabulous.

280
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,700
Machida she suspended and
suspended for a long fucking time,

281
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,020
isn't he?

282
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,080
Doesn't Disney have a two year?

283
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,463
I'm not sure.

284
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,091
It's not good.

285
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:54,320
I don't know if they've decided or not,

286
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,200
but I felt like he got
suspended for two years.

287
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:57,711
I mean,

288
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,600
you just look at the
Brazilian fighters especially.

289
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,111
You're right.

290
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:02,600
Light heavyweight Machida
was going 85 anyway.

291
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:04,340
You can float between two of,

292
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,550
I'm just thinking two or five guys
he could line up with in Brazil.

293
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:08,803
Not a lot.

294
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:09,561
Not a whole lot.

295
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:09,771
I mean,

296
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:11,200
Beta already fought Leo.

297
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,650
You could sell that as a rematch cause
remember the little knocked him out in La

298
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:15,170
a bad.

299
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,003
Yeah,

300
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,780
but he suspended all the,

301
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:18,351
you're right though.

302
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:18,650
All the,

303
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,370
especially,

304
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,290
there's not a lot of new blood in Brazil.

305
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,340
Okay.
