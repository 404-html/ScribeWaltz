1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,120
The joe rogan experience.
You know,

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:07,040
I have to sit back and all the time and
try to think for myself that

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,260
you,
you've,

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,570
I love my library,
that I have all the books within it.

5
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:16,420
I love the cars that I have.
I love the relationships that I have,

6
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:18,970
but there's a give her instead of the
relationship,

7
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:21,130
but just the things and it's like these
are all great things,

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,970
but if I don't have them,
I am still me.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,400
I still have everything that I need in
this world.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:32,170
I don't like to think about them being
lost,

11
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,880
destroyed.
I certainly hate the idea of it being

12
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:35,350
destroyed because he was,
it wasn't in my hands.

13
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:39,190
I'd like them to still exist for others,
but without them.

14
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:44,670
I'm no different than who I am now.
And I guess that's kind of a thinking of

15
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:46,790
like the Stoics,
uh,

16
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,810
you've been more defined by your
accomplishments and your thinking and

17
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:52,300
your philosophy.
There's lots of things that people,

18
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,700
obviously they couldn't know about me.

19
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:55,543
They,
it,

20
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,070
because it's not the kind of thing that
is,

21
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:01,460
is just my who I am.
Right.

22
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,550
And I don't need someone to know whether
or not I'm smart or whether or not I

23
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,410
know this or whether or not I can do
that.

24
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,460
It's like I'll do it when I need to do
it and I,

25
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:15,310
I have to try and look to see that I
have my own inner peace is based on my

26
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:18,640
own self knowledge and knowledge also
that I am lacking,

27
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,040
that I can be better,
that I,

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,780
and if I want to,
I can choose to.

29
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:25,480
And those days that I don't,
it was a choice not to be better.

30
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,990
It wasn't that I couldn't because even
going and failing like we talked about

31
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:33,490
before is a worthwhile endeavor because
it will move you towards either a

32
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:36,580
eventually getting there or b,
that it's not something that's going to

33
00:01:36,581 --> 00:01:38,710
be yours,
but you know what it is and you know

34
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:41,620
what it takes to get there.
And that's a different perspective

35
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:43,210
altogether and

36
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,130
okay,

37
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,130
that is where I feel like that's where I
can be okay in this world and deal in,

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,800
in.
There's all kinds of things that you can

39
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:58,360
draw your focus and really eat at you
and bother you and you're giving weight

40
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:02,950
to these things and allowing them to
have an effect on you and that's

41
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:05,620
natural.
That's a normal thing and it's easy to

42
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:10,300
fall into.
But if you can be okay with all right,

43
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,960
if all I'm left with is just me and what
I have,

44
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,090
if I no longer have anything,
no,

45
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:17,620
no more luxuries,
no more this,

46
00:02:17,621 --> 00:02:20,350
no more of that.
Can you be okay with that?

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,970
You know,
what kind of life would you make of

48
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:24,490
this?
And I like to think the same one I have

49
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:26,950
now.
You can pick me up here,

50
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:30,550
take all my shit away,
throw me some other part of the world,

51
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:34,660
the third world country and it will be
jarring.

52
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,660
It will be difficult and there'll be
some lament of course,

53
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:42,690
but I will continue to be who I am.
I will see what is necessary to,

54
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,790
to communicate with others and to
continue to propagate this that I'm

55
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:51,400
trying to create in me.
That's hilarious.

56
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,680
Yeah.
Did of the new,

57
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,510
have you ever been a place where it felt
weird?

58
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,150
We found out that someone died there.
You ever been in a place where you felt

59
00:02:58,151 --> 00:02:59,980
the presence of it in?
That felt weird

60
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,730
because you know some violence was going
to pop off and I knew it,

61
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,400
right?
Oh yeah.

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,440
I was like,
let's get the fuck outta here.

63
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,540
Right.
As you can tell,

64
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,730
you can feel that somebody's dying.
No.

65
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,600
I was at a concert once in a brawl broke
out and I quit.

66
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:16,560
I was a security guard and a,
I was a neil young concert and it broke

67
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:19,350
out and I put a Hoodie on.
I zipped it up and covered my security

68
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:21,390
outfit.
I'd walk right the fuck out of there.

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,360
I was like,
you out of your fucking mind,

70
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,260
jumping into this fray,
getting clocked in the head by somebody.

71
00:03:28,261 --> 00:03:30,600
Like people were fighting and they were
there.

72
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,240
They canceled the show and kicked
everybody out.

73
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,730
People are lighting fires.
I was at a,

74
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:39,590
what was it?
Just not this odd vibe awards when when

75
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,330
Dr Dre got jumped at it and a young buck
stabbed a guy.

76
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,590
Oh,
I was there.

77
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,470
Wow.
And I was doing a show for UPN and this

78
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,730
was back when upn was still a network
and a one of the execs from upn was

79
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,700
there with her young son.
He will who wanted to see all the

80
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:58,540
rappers and he's sitting at the table
with us and I saw like the g unit group

81
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,850
come in.
Then I sort of death row guys come in

82
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:04,480
and I saw drays group commit and I'm
sitting there and I tell,

83
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:05,800
I forgot to get lady's name.
I said,

84
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,570
hey,
you might want to get your kid out of

85
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,620
here.
Something's about to go down.

86
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,000
Wow.
And she's like,

87
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:10,750
what do you mean?
I'm like,

88
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,130
it's about to,
it's about to go.

89
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,080
And she's like,
he's so excited.

90
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:15,900
He wanted to see dre and he loves 50
sending them,

91
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,590
listen,
get this kid.

92
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,760
It was a little white kid to them.

93
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,953
Oh my God,
there's,

94
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,150
can I go say hi and I'm like,
you get them out of here.

95
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,670
And when it's like the second time I
said it like,

96
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,710
Yo,
you might want to really get them out of

97
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,553
it.
It's going to pop off.

98
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,200
Boom.
Dre gets punched in the face,

99
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,220
Malay young bucks stabs guy.
And I'm like,

100
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:33,940
I told you Jesus.
And like two days later on set,

101
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,710
she's just like,
how did you know that?

102
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm like,
I know that.

103
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,920
I know the energy in the room.
I could feel it.

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,230
I've been around it too many times.
That's a crazy feeling to when people

105
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:46,240
are about to do something with this.
Yeah.

106
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,410
You see them,
you see them walk,

107
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,670
you see the look.
You know,

108
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,190
it's like,
it's sad,

109
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,510
but it's true.
Like when you grow up in the hood,

110
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:54,010
you have that instinct.
You have that,

111
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,170
that look,
you look at a guy walked past,

112
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:59,230
you would one time and you look at,
look around the room and okay,

113
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,240
it's about to go.
It's about to go.

114
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,080
People that have never experienced that
probably wouldn't know what to do.

115
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,250
Right.
They wouldn't,

116
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,080
they would think nothing of it like that
lady.

117
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,790
Like she never seen those signs before.
Yeah,

118
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,970
I've been on the road.
It's uh,

119
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,880
this was recently,
like maybe three months,

120
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:20,690
four months ago.
I had a my feature at my feature comic

121
00:05:20,691 --> 00:05:23,330
with me,
he's from Chicago actually and we're in

122
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:27,380
a club after the show and it's a couple
of guys talking in the corner and I said

123
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,490
something to a girl,
she's like,

124
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:31,370
Hey Tony Rock and have a little small
talk and she walks over to the group of

125
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:35,810
guys and one guy walks over and stands
at the end of the bar here and one guy

126
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:39,080
stands ended up out here and I turned to
my friend Dave and I go,

127
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,790
Yo,
you ever been a fight in a ball before?

128
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,050
And he said No.

129
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,160
I said,
get ready motherfucker.

130
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:46,580
You got to be in one cause I saw it,
Jesus.

131
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,770
And then third guy comes over.
So funny,

132
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,450
the third guy comes over and he's like,
Oh shit,

133
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,550
you are a comedian.
And I said,

134
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:52,911
yeah.
He said,

135
00:05:52,911 --> 00:05:54,530
I thought that was you was over there
talking and I was like,

136
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:56,960
I thought that was the comedian guy and
he's got a good picture man.

137
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,710
I took a picture with him and he's
called all the guy,

138
00:05:58,711 --> 00:05:59,100
but like,
yeah,

139
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,250
was was comedian.
It was him that was like,

140
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:03,860
he kinda just squashed it cause he,
I guess they didn't know who I was.

141
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,140
Oh,
it was going to go,

142
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:07,610
but because I said something to the
girl,

143
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,520
oh no,
it was the comedian is hit.

144
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,540
And I'm like,
hey fellows,

145
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,374
what's up now?
I,

146
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,180
you know,
I turned into the community like,

147
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:14,750
what's up guys?

148
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,650
I got to do and y'all,
all right,

149
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:17,320
what'd you guys need to drink?
Let's do a round of shots,

150
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,230
you know?
Oh man,

151
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,780
Dave's like,
that's done all that.

152
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:23,060
And I'm like,
I know mother fuckers going to go.

153
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,140
It was going to go.
Oh yeah.

154
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,940
If he ain't never been around violent
people,

155
00:06:28,941 --> 00:06:30,830
you probably don't smell that vibe.
Right.

156
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,350
You smell that vibe.
Who knows who's on steroids.

157
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,050
When you saw it,
it came through,

158
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,120
you know,
the guys that kind of like,

159
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:40,550
their body's changed some of the people
who dropped off radically.

160
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,440
Yeah.
So quick,

161
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,580
really quick.
It's like,

162
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,410
whoo,
I never thought,

163
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,610
yeah,
well not just change,

164
00:06:47,611 --> 00:06:50,570
but change to the point where like
you're not even the same person.

165
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:52,460
Yeah.
You're like doing an mph and the guys in

166
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:56,330
their 20s doing them an impression of
who they were just a couple of years ago

167
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:57,110
on the sauce.

168
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:59,210
Yeah.
Shit's happening man.

169
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,310
Well he got caught up in a band.
I'm snitching.

170
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,540
I saw the thing was he was the golden
snitch.

171
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,513
I,
he's a Mac.

172
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,360
He sent it to me.
He was texting me as well.

173
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,480
Novitsky he's a good guy,
man.

174
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,760
He's just like,
he's got a bad reputation from a lot of

175
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:15,500
people.
Like it'd be cool with them cause I know

176
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:17,690
me and I'm not cheating.
I'm not a guy that

177
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,350
now he's,
what is his official title?

178
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,310
It's like athletes.
Those how would cheat on,

179
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,970
wouldn't be hanging around him like the
way I would or wouldn't be as friendly

180
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:27,920
with them because they didn't want him
sniffing around.

181
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,190
Well he's there to make sure that
someone doesn't cheat on youtube though.

182
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,570
100% and I'm like,
please,

183
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,030
I'm,
I'm,

184
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,030
I'm not mad at it.
Yeah.

185
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,820
What's that?
Oh,

186
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,860
was we competed?
What does it say?

187
00:07:36,861 --> 00:07:41,861
The Golden Jeffrey.

188
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,320
John Devinsky.
The golden snitch is the vice president

189
00:07:47,321 --> 00:07:49,480
of athlete health and performance for
the UFC.

190
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,780
Holy Shit,
Brendan Show Up.

191
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:56,260
Made it.
Brendan Schaub living.

192
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,180
When did you smoke weed?
You ever get paranoid?

193
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,760
One time I did an edible.
I ate too much.

194
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:05,050
So you know Jim,
our neighbors.

195
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,240
Sure.
A very funny comic.

196
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,680
He gave me an edible one time and this
was before like anybody could just walk

197
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:12,580
into a dispensary.
Like,

198
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:15,820
cause now you just have to show your id
and you can get anything from the

199
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,290
dispensary.
But this was when you had to have a,

200
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,650
a card.
So he went in and got it for me and it

201
00:08:20,651 --> 00:08:24,010
was this lemon bar that said award
winning on it.

202
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,260
And me being the weed novice,
I was like,

203
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:28,270
oh this is going to be award winning
because of the taste.

204
00:08:28,271 --> 00:08:29,104
Right.
It's like,

205
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,470
I was like,
this is like a Paula deen recipe.

206
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,500
And so
I ate like half of it and I was by

207
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:42,640
myself and I woke up,
I was laying down and I was in my bed

208
00:08:42,641 --> 00:08:44,800
and I sat up and I said,
am I talking to myself?

209
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,210
I'm not talking to myself.
Oh my God,

210
00:08:46,211 --> 00:08:48,130
I am talking to myself.
I'm not talking to myself.

211
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,180
I am and I was saying this out loud.
I have to check.

212
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,220
I went on my phone to get on twitter to
see them,

213
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,520
make sure the world was still happening
because I was like,

214
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,160
I felt like I was in some weird twilight
zone.

215
00:08:59,161 --> 00:08:59,760
It was,
yeah,

216
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,790
it was awful.
So I got on there and then I made my

217
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,290
forced myself to go to sleep because I
was like,

218
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,750
I can't be awake like this.
So I forced myself to go to sleep.

219
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,160
I woke up the next morning,
I was still high for like five more

220
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:15,730
hours.
It was awful.

221
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,070
Yeah.
I gave my friend edible and he called me

222
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:21,820
up a day later and said,
I'm still high a day later if you don't

223
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:24,610
know what you're doing with it.
Because I had a conversation with

224
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:25,660
someone else the other day and they were
like,

225
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:28,180
I ate there,
I for some Rice Krispie treats and I was

226
00:09:28,181 --> 00:09:30,280
like,
why would you eat four of them?

227
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:34,520
He called the cops,
call the cops and then checked him.

228
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:36,940
Set you like went to a hospital because
he thought he was dying.

229
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,010
Do you ever see the one where it was a
nine one one call?

230
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:43,670
The cops took weed from these people.
They pulled them over and then the cops

231
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:47,810
use the weed to make pot brownies and
then they ate the pot brownies and they

232
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:51,080
called nine one on themselves.
They called for an ambulance.

233
00:09:51,081 --> 00:09:53,150
They said there were dying.
Please send help.

234
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,320
Time's moving very slowly.
But what's hilarious is it's a fucking

235
00:09:57,321 --> 00:10:02,270
nine one one call from a cop from a cop
and the cop is calling to get an

236
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:05,450
ambulance.
Can we say the time is moving slowly and

237
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:08,060
they stole the weed from these fucking
kids that they pulled over.

238
00:10:08,061 --> 00:10:10,340
The whole thing is just,
it's brilliant.

239
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,120
It's so funny.
Oh Man.

240
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,430
It's one of my all time favorite nine
one one calls cause it's just so sad.

241
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,783
Yeah,
yeah,

242
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,180
yeah.
Can,

243
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,520
can you,
can you please send help times moving

244
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:23,390
very slowly.

245
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,530
What to play it as I was looking up an
article about it,

246
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,670
uh,
the cop had to,

247
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,520
he resigned before he got in trouble
for,

248
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,060
he resigned.
Taking the weed and be using it so he

249
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:36,230
quit.
Yeah.

250
00:10:36,231 --> 00:10:38,510
That's probably good movement as part of
you at that point,

251
00:10:38,511 --> 00:10:39,620
you kind of have to,
yeah.

252
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:42,680
He called nine one one and we're talking
about in a podcast years later,

253
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:44,060
everybody's heard that.
Yeah,

254
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,700
I didn't.
You'd never that fucking a guarantee.

255
00:10:46,701 --> 00:10:49,340
The video is probably been played a
million times.

256
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,270
Easily more than a million.
Do you have a jamie?

257
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,870
Yeah.
I just,

258
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,820
I found this a shorter version.
Okay.

259
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,440
Listen to this.
Poor fucked.

260
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:01,160
Just think about this and to save

261
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,500
marijuana.
I don't know if they had something in

262
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:05,111
it.
Hey,

263
00:11:05,111 --> 00:11:07,410
police and rescue.
You guys have fever?

264
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,843
No,
I'm just,

265
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,690
I think we're dying.
Oh,

266
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,870
how much did you guys have?
I Dunno.

267
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,250
We made brownies and I think what that
time is going by really,

268
00:11:16,251 --> 00:11:17,660
really,
really low

269
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,970
lady laughing.
See,

270
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,610
pot is something that even when you're
having an overdose,

271
00:11:24,611 --> 00:11:25,630
people laugh at you.

272
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:35,540
Okay.
