1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
Started the recording,
started to broadcast.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:08,450
What the Fuck Ladies and gentlemen.
See it doesn't show that it started but 

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:10,520
I know it has.
I know,

4
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,350
but you got to like refresh it and shit.
He usually takes a couple of seconds.

5
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:15,210
That will do it.
It's bullshit son.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,220
Ladies and gentlemen.
That's me.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,410
There you go.
Every time we do this,

8
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:25,770
I could have sworn I muted it this time.
You know when you do it by yourself,

9
00:00:25,771 --> 00:00:28,050
you don't do it.
You catch yourself.

10
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,300
Yeah.
Maybe I'm going to distract you.

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,740
You do not.
No,

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,400
no,
no,

13
00:00:32,401 --> 00:00:35,160
no.
Don't make me make fun of you.

14
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:38,980
You stop.
Alright.

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,320
This mother fucker and his God damn 
ipad.

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,420
Fucking love it.
Listen,

17
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:50,421
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's a little gay but if it's good 

18
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:50,850
enough for the Romans,
that's good enough for the Greeks.

19
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,940
Look at you.
I got an ipad even though I said I 

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,490
wasn't going to get one for you to get 
one.

21
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,680
Like walked by,
said you guys got in them bitches.

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,480
St Guys said yes.
And I said okay,

23
00:01:00,481 --> 00:01:04,620
let's go first day.
It's kind of interesting.

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,040
You know,
what I am interested in is what's going 

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,081
gonna happen with these things,
like what are these things eventually 

26
00:01:13,081 --> 00:01:15,441
gonna,
eventually these things are going to be 

27
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:15,441
able to control your house and Shit.
You know,

28
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,830
you could already do that.
And if the dragon naturally speaking,

29
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:19,130
is any good on this.
Do you know it?

30
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:19,280
This.

31
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:24,340
It's alright.
It's alright if you have a headphone 

32
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,251
microphone thing plugged in to it.
I tried to do it like in a loud room in 

33
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:27,251
it.

34
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:30,930
Well I got to write a book now and uh,
I just signed a deal.

35
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,440
So it's fucking official.
I'm in the middle of writing this thing 

36
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:36,440
and I'm thinking,
God damn,

37
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,720
it takes a long time to write shit.
It might be easier to just talk it out,

38
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,400
but I don't think that stuff is any 
good.

39
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:46,401
Now.
Some of the people told me that I'm a 

40
00:01:46,401 --> 00:01:47,520
voice recognition software is really 
good on pcs,

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,540
but I'm not quite there on the Mac yet.
Have you heard of?

42
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,810
I didn't miss that because one of the 
best ones on the PC is dragon naturally 

43
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:58,130
speaking.
So it's the same technologies the same.

44
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,530
Everything's the same,
so there shouldn't be a difference,

45
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,670
but it's not the same version because 
it's a unix based for the Mac operating 

46
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,060
system.
Ryan is totally different.

47
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,290
It's like a different version.

48
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,780
It's the same programming language.
It's just,

49
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:11,790
it's,
I mean it's,

50
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:12,280
it's,
you know,

51
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:15,550
it's like a xbox and ps three.
I mean it's the same tech.

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,060
The programming is the same.
It's just two different ways.

53
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,500
Is that true?
Ladies and gentlemen,

54
00:02:19,501 --> 00:02:24,501
did it maybe you wizards out there and 
know whether or not he's speaking the 

55
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:24,501
truth because,
uh,

56
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:28,250
I believe Brian,
but I also believe that Brian did not 

57
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,250
know the answer.

58
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,160
Well,
it's just like I barely used dragon so I

59
00:02:31,161 --> 00:02:33,310
could be wrong.
I'm not a huge dragon nerd,

60
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:37,190
but to me it makes sense that if a 
company makes that kind of software,

61
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:40,940
it would be the same on pc and Mac and 
might have to get there a different way,

62
00:02:40,941 --> 00:02:44,000
but the actual brains of the software 
would be the same.

63
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,360
The same program.
There's something about actually writing

64
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:52,361
things too.
That's better than speaking it and 

65
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:52,361
writing it because like when I write 
something,

66
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:54,260
if I write a blog,
I don't type that fast,

67
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,260
so if I'm writing something,
each word that I'm thinking about,

68
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm writing really dwelling on it.
The other words that come

69
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,980
after it now,
that's why one of the things people are 

70
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,111
always really impressed about is the 
ability to speak without stammering and 

71
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:10,940
that have something to say.
I mean that's the reason why Obama got 

72
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:10,940
elected really is because not just 
because he's black,

73
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,360
but because he's black and he's just 
really good speaker,

74
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,030
you know,
he's really good at talking and there is

75
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,520
an art form to that.
It's a management of your,

76
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:22,030
the ability to recognize like what 
you're gonna say next and the inflection

77
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:24,670
you're gonna use and preparation and all
that shit.

78
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:25,190
It's,
it's,

79
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:25,460
it's,
uh,

80
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,670
there's an art to it,
but,

81
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,490
you know,
it's more interesting.

82
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:34,330
Usually when I read things that people 
wrote and they actually wrote it,

83
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,960
they sat down and they really thought 
about how this is going to be absorbed.

84
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,270
You know,
there's a craft,

85
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,840
there's a craft to both,
but there's a real craft to writing,

86
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,490
you know,
actual writing itself.

87
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:47,590
I really appreciate it when I read good 
writers,

88
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,130
don't you?

89
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,010
Yeah,
I,

90
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,640
you know,
I don't read that much,

91
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,200
but the few books that I choose,
I pick out certain things I want to read

92
00:03:55,201 --> 00:04:00,201
this.
I read all day on the Internet when it 

93
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:00,201
comes to a book.
I'm like,

94
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:03,081
all right,
I've read so much today I don't need to 

95
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:03,081
read anymore,
you know,

96
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:03,720
type thing.
So I've actually been reading less books

97
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,300
ever since the Internet kind of grabbed,
grabbed me,

98
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,050
I've noticed.

99
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,340
Yeah,
yeah,

100
00:04:08,341 --> 00:04:09,660
definitely.
Yeah.

101
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,180
Last good book I read was a book called 
early bird.

102
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,260
Highly recommended though.
It's about a guy that used to write for,

103
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:18,300
I think letterman and he retired.
This is real,

104
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,390
a real guy.
And he retired and he went to Florida 

105
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,061
and lived in a retirement home and he 
documented his life inside a retirement 

106
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:29,760
home being retired at the age of 35.
It was one of the funniest books.

107
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:34,890
It's weird how they,
the retirement village is like high 

108
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:34,890
school.
You know,

109
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,121
there's like the popular old people and 
they have like their cliques and stuff 

110
00:04:38,121 --> 00:04:38,490
like that and it's so weird.
You kind of go back to that,

111
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,200
that old school thing.
That's hilarious.

112
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,660
Early bird.
Yeah.

113
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:45,010
People are like that man.
They like that no matter what,

114
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,830
they're like that if they're 80,
they're like that.

115
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:48,870
If there were 180 for,
you know,

116
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,140
we're monkeys,
man.

117
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,520
We have a whole bunch of instincts that 
we follow that uh,

118
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,650
really are directly attributable to our 
time in the jungle,

119
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,550
you know?
I mean,

120
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:59,020
that's what I've said about human 
beings,

121
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,140
that there's something fucked up about 
us where we need.

122
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,880
You're distracting the shit out of me 
with that thing,

123
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:06,640
son.
Let's not be fucking browsing online.

124
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:06,730
Yeah.

125
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,670
Tom was actually seeing if we could get 
our live show on the IPAD.

126
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,030
Oh,
doing it live.

127
00:05:11,031 --> 00:05:15,290
So watched new fucking move.
Know.

128
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:16,970
Don't sit behind me because then I can't
talk to you.

129
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:19,550
I'm going to turn like this.
My neck hurts from Jujitsu.

130
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,310
Hey,
you fucking me.

131
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,360
Forgotten what we were talking about.
Uh,

132
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,150
yeah,
me too.

133
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,730
Damn.
Fucking stoners.

134
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,520
Uh,
we were talking about talking and 

135
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,020
writing and the last guy who got me into
writing or reading and writing really,

136
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:36,800
but,
uh,

137
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,500
I read the great shark hunt,
the hunter s Thompson Book.

138
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:41,200
It's kind of a compilation book of all 
of his,

139
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:42,770
uh,
his stories.

140
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,910
Fuck,
that dude could,

141
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,940
right?
That dude had some really interesting 

142
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:48,940
writing like guy you excited to read 
more about it,

143
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,450
you know,
and it's kind of like this weird blend 

144
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,291
of fiction and nonfiction.
That's one of the things that was so 

145
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:56,780
cool about hunter's writing is like this
guy was just crazy.

146
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,780
It was making all kinds of crazy shit up
about like Las Vegas and campaigns and 

147
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,590
dudes being on drugs.
You know,

148
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:05,570
when Ed Muskie was running for 
president,

149
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Hunter Thompson just started printing in
rolling stone magazine every week that 

150
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,710
it was like widely known.
This guy had an ebook again,

151
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,640
addiction and that he was bringing in 
Brazilian doctors.

152
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,650
Like nobody ever done that before.
Nobody's ever done like real serious 

153
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,790
coverage of like a political event and 
just started adding nutty shit to it.

154
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:27,791
That totally wasn't real.
So literally this guy changed the 

155
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:31,301
fucking course,
the election because that guy was like 

156
00:06:31,301 --> 00:06:33,310
one of the favorites and because hunters
writing about him having an evil game 

157
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,930
addiction,
which is this crazy exotic drug from 

158
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:37,930
Africa,
you know,

159
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,740
Hunter wrote this whole thing about it 
and this guy literally fell apart on the

160
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:44,741
campaign trail.
People were heckling him and he's doing 

161
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:44,741
these campaign speeches and just 
crumpled,

162
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:46,580
just bring some crazy shit that this guy
wrote.

163
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,950
And when they asked him about it and he 
goes,

164
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:49,370
uh,
well,

165
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:51,080
you,
you made up that stuff about,

166
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,210
you know,
ed muskie having an irrigator,

167
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,690
he goes,
well,

168
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:54,440
I didn't make it up.
I,

169
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:54,790
I,
I,

170
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,170
I didn't print.
I said it was a rumor and it goes in.

171
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,470
It was a rumor and I started in 
Milwaukee.

172
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,320
It was crazy.
It was just.

173
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,730
But he got away with it and he was just 
constantly on acid.

174
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,300
He was constantly doing masculine who's 
constantly doing cocaine.

175
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,480
I mean,
he was constantly getting fucked up and 

176
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,480
writing.
That's like Super Uber fucked up.

177
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,420
Is there a book or a movie that you 
would recommend about all this?

178
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:24,450
Yeah,
well I didn't even get into him until I 

179
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,060
watched the documentary Gonzo.
I'd like to move you fear and loathing 

180
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,470
in Las Vegas and I'd seen him on talk 
shows before.

181
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,280
I always knew that he was just kind of 
crazy guy.

182
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:32,710
There was this older dude who was really
nutty,

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,530
like to shoot guns and it looked like,
you know,

184
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,200
your friend's Dad,
but he was fucking completely psychotic,

185
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,560
you know,
it was just this guy left over from the 

186
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,691
sixties that somehow or another morphed 
into this like super violent fucking 

187
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:48,550
drug addled compound Chuckii.
That's what he used to call themselves.

188
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:48,850
You know,

189
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,510
I just added it to my netflix queue on 
my ipad.

190
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:51,780
Yeah,

191
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,470
good job.
Good job.

192
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,250
See that?
Where it's very good documentary,

193
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,730
but it's a really well made too.
So it really gets you into how fucking 

194
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,780
interesting this guy was.
And it brings me back to the same thing 

195
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:04,780
that I always think of,
man,

196
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,840
I'm when you're really that good.
He's so good.

197
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,350
I always wonder how fucking crazy you 
have to be to be really good.

198
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,220
You know,
like,

199
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:16,221
you know,
in almost everything like Michael 

200
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:16,221
Jackson and fucking sports,
anybody like tiger woods,

201
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,330
you know,
look how crazy is.

202
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,420
I almost think that you have to be a 
certain.

203
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:24,620
There's a certain amount of imbalanced 
to you to be really the best at anything

204
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:25,490
to be.
Excellent.

205
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,580
Yeah.
Well that's why you're considered the 

206
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,991
best.
Usually not in the same road as 

207
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:32,330
everybody else.
You're on the side street,

208
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,360
you know,
you're a little different than everyone 

209
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,360
else.
So that's the most successful people are

210
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,800
not just a common person in everything.
They do,

211
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,940
not just that.
What I'm saying is that the commitment 

212
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,190
that's involved in order to get to the 
highest levels of anything,

213
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,940
like you almost have to be completely 
not knowing that I hit those Rpms,

214
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,370
you know,
it's like um,

215
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:56,550
with so many things,
especially when it comes to the working 

216
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,550
world,
when it comes to like the world,

217
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,270
I could see a,
you know,

218
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:00,270
an argument for there's no,
there's never too much.

219
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,300
It's never too much art that you can 
produce because you just producing 

220
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,640
positive energy.
People that get addicted to success in 

221
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,280
the business world.
And try to be like the number one guy in

222
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,600
the business world.
I mean,

223
00:09:09,601 --> 00:09:14,601
that's one of the main reasons why we 
have all these problems today with 

224
00:09:14,601 --> 00:09:17,400
corporations or corporations are sort of
these consciousness list entities,

225
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:22,401
you know,
I mean now corporations basically are 

226
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:22,401
allowed to,
uh,

227
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:23,130
they're,
they're judged as an individual.

228
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,870
You know,
corporations are a thing,

229
00:09:24,871 --> 00:09:29,871
like they have rights and shit.
Like they can contribute to campaigns 

230
00:09:29,871 --> 00:09:32,340
now as much as they want.
They can do all kinds of crazy shit,

231
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,000
you know,
as,

232
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:36,630
as a corporation and get away with it 
because they don't think of it as them,

233
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:38,820
as an individual doing it.
They think of it as well,

234
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,850
you know,
it's all business and we're part of 

235
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,411
business.
Like they can do fucked up things in 

236
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:45,411
overseas countries,
you know,

237
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:49,310
third world countries and they don't 
even think that they're doing anything 

238
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,551
bad because what they're doing is 
they're just doing business and there's 

239
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:52,551
just a bunch of people involved doing 
it.

240
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,100
So no one person feels like total 
responsibility for what's happening,

241
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,410
you know?
And that's,

242
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,700
that's like a,
that's like a real problem that we have.

243
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:04,850
And I think one of the real problems 
that we have is related to people just 

244
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,850
being super competitive,
you know,

245
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:09,870
that's the only reason why these fucking
super crazy billionaire dudes would keep

246
00:10:09,871 --> 00:10:11,250
pushing forward,
you know,

247
00:10:11,251 --> 00:10:16,251
at a certain point in time,
how much fucking money do you have to 

248
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:16,251
have,
you know,

249
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:16,830
when you're one of those dudes that has 
like 30,

250
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:21,831
$40,
billion dollars and you're still trying 

251
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:21,831
to rape third world countries.

252
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,340
Like what the fuck is going on?
Like how much money do you need,

253
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:23,820
bitch,
you know,

254
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,220
that's a lot of goddamn money.
And what is that?

255
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:31,221
Why?
Why would they not be able to recognize 

256
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:31,221
that there's something wrong there?
Well then they're crazy.

257
00:10:31,221 --> 00:10:33,360
That's what it is to get at the highest 
levels of anything.

258
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,670
Whether it's golf or whether it's 
fucking,

259
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,720
you know,
whatever the fuck it is to get at the 

260
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:40,720
highest levels of anything.
You got to be a little naughty man.

261
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,960
Whether it's sports,
whether it's singing or performing the 

262
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,710
writing,
you know,

263
00:10:46,711 --> 00:10:47,590
I think,
you know,

264
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,200
to really achieve those,
those,

265
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,230
those crazy great highs,
like you almost have to like lose your 

266
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,880
connection to everybody else or lose 
control of your connection.

267
00:10:57,670 --> 00:11:02,670
You know,
it's weird because that's our high 

268
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:02,670
watermark,
you know,

269
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:06,970
and we're always aspiring towards higher
and higher levels of performance in 

270
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,010
everything we do.

271
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,320
Whether it's athletic or anything you 
do,

272
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:12,420
you're always trying to do better than 
you did before.

273
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,880
You know,
I mean that's like a human ethic that we

274
00:11:14,881 --> 00:11:19,881
have and it's a very strange man because
there's never a point in time where we 

275
00:11:19,881 --> 00:11:19,930
ever stepped back and go,
you know,

276
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:20,730
hey,
this is,

277
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,960
this is good.
We're good right here.

278
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:24,540
Let's just,
let's concentrate our time right now.

279
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:29,541
Instead of making more money,
let's try to concentrate all our time 

280
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:29,790
and trying to make things better for 
each other.

281
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,300
You know,
let's kind of try to concentrate our 

282
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:35,300
time and dealing with all these problems
that exist all over the world.

283
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,670
Instead of trying to fucking smash atoms
and create black holes.

284
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,020
Let's,
let's settle down.

285
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,470
You know,
and let's concentrate on some other shit

286
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:45,390
when we look at a surplus of money that 
we have,

287
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,600
but they don't ever think like that.
All they think of as more and more and 

288
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,271
more and more and more and more and more
like they're going to live forever and 

289
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:53,271
those motherfuckers drop a heart attacks
left and right.

290
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:54,100
Those like ceos

291
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,400
of big corporation type dudes,
those motherfuckers die like crazy.

292
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,370
They die all the time.
Those guys are,

293
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:04,590
you know,
like Dick Cheney's at 150 fucking heart 

294
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:04,590
attacks.
And one of the reasons is,

295
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,920
is because he's,
he's just such an evil cunt.

296
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,260
You know,
if you're that fucking evil,

297
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,540
you know you're going to have some 
goddamn heart attack you,

298
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:15,541
you're doing some wicked shit.
You're creating so much bad energy and 

299
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:16,540
you're pushing constantly,
constantly,

300
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,120
constantly.
You know,

301
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,550
what kind of balls do you have to have 
to be the fucking CEO of a corporation 

302
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,931
like Halliburton and then go from that 
to being the vice president of the 

303
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:32,460
United States and then go from that to 
signing billion dollar agreements with 

304
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,070
Halliburton.
We're billions.

305
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:36,940
Literally billions of dollars were lost,
like they don't know where it went.

306
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,520
Billions and corruption.
They have no idea where,

307
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:44,670
like all kinds of money went.
And the fact that that motherfucker 

308
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:44,670
profited on it.

309
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,000
He had shares in Halliburton while he 
was the fucking president.

310
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,210
I mean,
he got money from them while he was the 

311
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:54,210
president or vice president.
What do you mean really?

312
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,381
Was the president really was the fucking
marionette supposedly remember the days 

313
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:00,730
where he was always in the bunker.
Remember?

314
00:13:00,731 --> 00:13:03,010
They would always,
they would always talk about Dick Cheney

315
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:04,990
been in the bunker and where's this 
bunker?

316
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,180
These,
there's some Batman type shit,

317
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,560
you know,
what does he have?

318
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,160
What is the Dick Cheney bunker?
It's just probably like a golf club.

319
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,980
It's another nickname for a golf club.
He's at the bunker,

320
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:19,870
at the whorehouse dudes banging dudes,
you know,

321
00:13:19,871 --> 00:13:21,820
that was the big secret of the fucking,
uh,

322
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,800
the,
the whole,

323
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:23,980
uh,
Bush White House was,

324
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:27,130
there was a lot of gay shit going on.
A lot of gay shit.

325
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,600
That guy,
Jeff Gannon,

326
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:30,680
who's a reporter for,
um,

327
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:31,390
the White House.

328
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:36,390
He was a White House embedded reporter.
And he would love the super softball 

329
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,340
questions at President Bush,
like Mr Bush,

330
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,950
President Bush,
when or Mr President,

331
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:45,280
when are the Democrats just going to 
come to reality?

332
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,560
When are they going to come to their 
senses?

333
00:13:47,561 --> 00:13:50,020
Do you think that's ever gonna Happen?
He would say shit like that.

334
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,600
And other reporters were like,
who is this motherfucker?

335
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,630
And so the other reporters started 
investigating the student and they found

336
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,200
out that he had a fucking gay porn 
website with him,

337
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,600
him with like,
you know,

338
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,000
like fucking bare chested and like a 
towel over his cock and shit,

339
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:09,180
like super gay with dog tags on.
And it was gay porn geared towards guys 

340
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,480
with military fetishes.
Yes.

341
00:14:12,481 --> 00:14:13,330
What have you heard about that

342
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,900
typical guy?
Have you heard about that guy in the 

343
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,390
news recently that tickled parties?
Uh,

344
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,560
with,
uh,

345
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,590
he worked off.
Same thing like he worked for the 

346
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,290
government somehow or like the dude.
Does anyone know what I'm talking about?

347
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:31,291
The typical guy that had like ticklers 
that would come over and they would all 

348
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:31,291
have to tickle parties.

349
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,440
Well,
how about that fucking woman?

350
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:37,441
You can make the Madam,
how about that woman who was the madam 

351
00:14:37,441 --> 00:14:40,410
for that big fucking brothel in 
Washington dc and this chick claims 

352
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,300
she's got the fucking ends on everybody 
in Washington.

353
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,450
All of these senators that use to 
service all these different people and 

354
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,650
then she commit suicide and she even 
said she at her interviews,

355
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:54,650
if I commit suicide,
they did this to me.

356
00:14:54,651 --> 00:14:57,080
I am not going to kill myself.
I'm happy.

357
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:02,081
I want to live.
It was fucking gone and the whole case 

358
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:03,050
gone.
Dust in the wind,

359
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,950
dust in the wind would Jesse James did 
you see?

360
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,790
Oh my goodness.
And that's what happens man.

361
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:15,791
People get fucking wacky about Jesse 
James or tiger woods or whatever the 

362
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,200
fuck it is this week in the news and 
while all that's going on,

363
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,830
crime just left and right.
They're just stealing,

364
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:26,980
stealing money and fucking pitches and 
killing bitches are going to fuck 

365
00:15:27,021 --> 00:15:27,590
bitches.

366
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,250
It's the congressmen Eric Massa that had
to tickle part.

367
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,670
Oh,
interesting Democrats,

368
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:36,130
Senator Democrat,
senator.

369
00:15:36,131 --> 00:15:38,540
It was on the daily show.
He was on a daily show talking about it.

370
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,130
No,
I think they had it on the daily show.

371
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
That's where they talked about that.
So take a story.

372
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,530
New York Times,
somebody's twitter to look at.

373
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,870
Sweet.
Oh,

374
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,170
is that the the tweets or the chat 
thing?

375
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:51,560
This is on twitter right now.
People responding to you on twitter,

376
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:54,350
so if you go to Joe's website,
Joe Rogan net,

377
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,470
click on webcams.
You can see the chat we're talking 

378
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,470
about.

379
00:15:59,470 --> 00:15:59,470
Yeah,
yeah.

380
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,271
Or you can go to my ustream page.
You can see the whole chat on the 

381
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:06,130
extreme page.
What the hell is joe going on about 

382
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,130
things?
She can't just tune in.

383
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:09,340
Halfway in the middle we're talking 
about shit.

384
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,610
The way the human mind works,
man,

385
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,640
that there's an error and the way the 
human mind works and that's the reason 

386
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,940
why people are doing all this crazy shit
like trying to conquer the world and you

387
00:16:18,941 --> 00:16:23,941
know,
and billionaires are fucking torturing 

388
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,301
these third world countries and crushing
their resources and doing it all for 

389
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:27,301
money.
They're.

390
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:31,310
The reason why is there's a,
there's an error and the human mind and 

391
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:33,490
there's an error that causes us to never
have perspective.

392
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,640
We're always moving in a direction,
but we don't have a perspective like 

393
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,271
nobody ever stops and very,
very few people stop and realize that a 

394
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:43,670
certain point in time,
like I would rather live a,

395
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,690
an easy going really peaceful life and 
make less money and have less bullshit 

396
00:16:49,631 --> 00:16:53,170
and less drama in my life and you know,
and just be happy all the time.

397
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:56,830
Then be this like super ambitious,
you know,

398
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,600
gotta go get it.
Typical American,

399
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,830
you know,
and that,

400
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:05,010
that's a problem in that fucking typical
American attitude is bullshit because 

401
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,340
we're going to die.
We're fucking dying.

402
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:07,560
All of us.
There's just.

403
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,700
This is totally temporary.
So like the,

404
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,720
the one thing to do is to try to balance
it all out and have the most amount of 

405
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,160
fun possible and the most amount of 
positive time,

406
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,710
the most amount of positive energy 
during the time that you have.

407
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,490
But then there's the keeping up with the
Joneses thing.

408
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,630
This trick that gets us thinking that 
somehow or another,

409
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:30,010
like bigger houses and bigger cars or 
bullshit is going to make you happy.

410
00:17:30,011 --> 00:17:35,011
Some of the most miserable Fox that I've
ever met in my life were rich and 

411
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:36,550
famous.
Okay.

412
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,700
The some of the most miserable fucking 
human beings I've ever met.

413
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:43,570
Rich and famous and living in a 
torturous existence.

414
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,800
You know,
like we were talking about.

415
00:17:44,801 --> 00:17:47,560
Our friend on the way over here has got 
the female problem.

416
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,370
You know,
this guy is a very

417
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,810
successful guy.
He's like,

418
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,610
been on television.
He's,

419
00:17:53,611 --> 00:17:54,600
you know,
he's a,

420
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,930
he's a guy that people enjoy.
They go to see him.

421
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Has Life is all I know.
It's fucking chaos and it's just,

422
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,140
it's,
it's.

423
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:06,390
So.
It's a few steps before murder.

424
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:07,500
Suicide,
right?

425
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,970
It is.
It's right there.

426
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,520
It's not going to murder suicides door.
You know,

427
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,380
if you got that phone call in the middle
of the night,

428
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:15,880
you wouldn't be that surprised you.
But God damn it.

429
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,630
Damn.
Should've done something else.

430
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,200
Yeah.
This is nothing you can do.

431
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,270
That's,
that's the cold hard facts.

432
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,950
There's nothing you can do.
At the end of the day,

433
00:18:22,951 --> 00:18:26,670
these motherfuckers have to go home.
It's like you have to figure out what is

434
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,860
it that we're really doing here?
What is it,

435
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:31,500
and because they're so fucking many of 
us,

436
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,380
I think that human beings have lost this
sense of community.

437
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:39,410
I think human beings are programmed to 
be in tribes were programmed to be in 

438
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,180
tribes of like 50 to 200 people or maybe
more,

439
00:18:42,181 --> 00:18:44,670
but enough that you know everybody and 
you know,

440
00:18:44,671 --> 00:18:47,280
when we live alone,
we're fucking miserable.

441
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:52,281
Like that's why we don't trust hermits.
We don't trust people that go off into 

442
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:52,960
the woods by themselves.
We look at this sketch,

443
00:18:52,961 --> 00:18:54,690
you motherfucker,
he wants to be by himself.

444
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,920
You know,
we don't trust that shit because that's 

445
00:18:59,920 --> 00:18:59,920
not how you're supposed to be.
We're not programmed for that.

446
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,340
We're programmed to be in small groups 
of people so that we worked together and

447
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,440
we protect each other and we support 
each other.

448
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,410
But we're living in a group that's way 
too big.

449
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,010
Were tricked into believing that the 
were a part of some $300,

450
00:19:11,011 --> 00:19:13,380
million strong group.
You know?

451
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,470
That's why like wars work,
you know the reason why wars work is 

452
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,470
because we feel like,
well,

453
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,031
yeah,
we got to defend ourselves and we all 

454
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:23,031
know we have this sort of sense of 
loyalty,

455
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:26,130
defend ourselves,
but a certain port tenants like against 

456
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,130
what?

457
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,800
Hold on a second,
whose we are $300 million fucking people

458
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,540
and we're defending ourselves against 
what,

459
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:35,541
300 million other people from somewhere 
else and we don't even know what is 

460
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:35,541
going on.
Why are they really after us?

461
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,180
Like,
what's happening?

462
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,320
Well,
I'm getting this from you and I'm 

463
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,131
connected to you somehow.
Who the fuck are you and why these 

464
00:19:43,131 --> 00:19:45,681
people mad at you.
Why are these fucking people in this 

465
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,081
other country mad at you?
Why do they want to come over here and 

466
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:48,081
kill me?
Because some shit you did.

467
00:19:48,081 --> 00:19:52,340
What the fuck are we doing?
Until you know what we're doing 

468
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,250
overseas?
You can't support it.

469
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,900
You can't be involved.
You know,

470
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:58,330
there's a video that was released that 
you haven't seen yet that it was on Wiki

471
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:03,331
leaks where it shows this a Apache 
helicopter shooting these hellfire 

472
00:20:03,331 --> 00:20:04,740
missiles into these people and they 
weren't soldiers.

473
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,710
They were mistaken as soldiers and I 
don't know us did it.

474
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:09,630
I watched it.
The US duty.

475
00:20:09,631 --> 00:20:10,360
Yeah.
Yeah.

476
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:13,980
The 2007 and covered it up and then wiki
leaks got ahold of it.

477
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:18,981
Someone in the armed forces apparently 
was a whistleblower and just thought 

478
00:20:18,981 --> 00:20:21,240
that this was a horrible situation and 
needed to be corrected.

479
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,610
And these guys were like,
you know,

480
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:28,790
look,
I mean if they thought there were 

481
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,081
insurgents,
I could see how they develop this 

482
00:20:30,081 --> 00:20:30,930
antagonistic attitude towards the enemy 
because this guy's willing to.

483
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,640
They shot him up as one guy,
survivors.

484
00:20:32,641 --> 00:20:37,641
I just pick up a weapon,
just pick up a weapon like he's asking 

485
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:40,551
them to just pick up,
pick up a weapon so he could isom and 

486
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:40,551
he's got these 30 and they've looked at 
the,

487
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:44,660
they're the bad guy and this guy is out 
there and he's in the shit and he's 

488
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:44,660
trying to survive.

489
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,300
I mean that's the attitude you have to 
have.

490
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,260
If you don't have that attitude and 
you're in war,

491
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,810
you're going to get killed,
but what it shows you is like,

492
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:52,840
what the fuck are we doing there?
Like what?

493
00:20:52,841 --> 00:20:57,841
What is?
What are we doing that our American 

494
00:20:57,841 --> 00:21:00,601
friends are people who live over here in
this country are subject to becoming 

495
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:04,681
that guy are subject to being put in a 
situation when they are shooting at 

496
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:05,470
civilians accidentally and thinking 
they're insurgents.

497
00:21:05,471 --> 00:21:10,471
They have to live with these fucking 
memories because someone told us that 

498
00:21:10,471 --> 00:21:11,350
we're supposed to be over there for some
fucking strange reason,

499
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:16,620
some fake weapons of mass destruction 
and now some fucking democracy building 

500
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:18,580
project.
You were surprised though.

501
00:21:18,581 --> 00:21:22,380
An 18 year old made a debt bad decision.
That was an 18 year old pilots.

502
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,390
I know,
but half those people are so young that 

503
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,281
it's retarded and I didn't get smart and
I'm smart with like a z until you may 

504
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,760
25,
27.

505
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,690
I would probably say I started actually 
doing making better decisions.

506
00:21:34,691 --> 00:21:37,170
Not fucking crazy shit.
No,

507
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:37,840
listen,
no,

508
00:21:37,841 --> 00:21:42,841
no doubt about it.
I was retarded when I was 18 and if I 

509
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:43,150
was 18 and I was in war,
I would be doing the exact same shit.

510
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:48,370
I was hyper-aggressive extra violent and
ready to ready to do stupid shit.

511
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,690
You know when you're an 18 year old man 
and you're around a bunch of people who 

512
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,790
tell you you are supposed to be doing 
stupid shit,

513
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,550
you're supposed to be violent.
You're supposed to be attacking.

514
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,740
You're supposed to be a killer.
I mean,

515
00:21:59,741 --> 00:22:00,930
man,
you,

516
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,460
you could program the shit out of us,
man,

517
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:08,580
if you,
if you're a fucking angry 18 year old 

518
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:08,580
kid,
you know who has a,

519
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:13,440
a,
a need to belong to something and this 

520
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,950
need to belong takes you to another 
country and all of a sudden you're,

521
00:22:14,951 --> 00:22:16,170
you know,
you're in Afghanistan,

522
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,350
you're fighting for America.

523
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,250
You feel like,
you know,

524
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:21,880
you're representing some real shit.
And then someone's fucking telling you,

525
00:22:21,881 --> 00:22:23,530
you know,
this guy is telling you you're a goddamn

526
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,580
killer.
You know,

527
00:22:24,581 --> 00:22:26,260
you know you.
I'm fucking proud of you boys.

528
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,730
You go out there and go get it.
You know,

529
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,740
like total,
full metal jacket style.

530
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:35,010
You know,
man and any of us could get sucked into 

531
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:35,010
that.
I could've got sucked into it.

532
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,310
You could've got sucked into it.
We all could have,

533
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:38,380
but the idea that they're over there 
protecting us,

534
00:22:38,381 --> 00:22:39,430
like,
man,

535
00:22:39,431 --> 00:22:41,680
we have to sit down and fucking talk 
this through.

536
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,180
Like,
what are you talking about?

537
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,950
You know,
they're protecting us.

538
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,200
Like they're protecting our freedoms.
Look,

539
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,390
if they really were protecting our 
freedoms,

540
00:22:49,391 --> 00:22:52,810
what a noble thing.
If there really was some evil empire out

541
00:22:52,811 --> 00:22:57,811
there like,
like the Nazis that were trying to 

542
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:00,421
fucking take out Americans and there was
millions of them and they're storming 

543
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:00,421
the beaches and taking over countries.

544
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,200
That's not what's happening.
Okay.

545
00:23:02,201 --> 00:23:07,201
There's a bunch of fucking dudes living 
in caves and we don't even have to 

546
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:10,831
fucking go in with what we're doing now 
that's most successful because he's 

547
00:23:10,831 --> 00:23:11,290
fucking drones.
These,

548
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,470
these aircrafts that are shooting around
total straight video game type Shit,

549
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,480
Shooting Hellfire missiles into 
mountains and killing people.

550
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,840
I mean,
that's probably the best way to hunt 

551
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,671
these fucking dudes anyway.
If there really are terrorists out 

552
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,921
there,
like the whole thing is nuts and you 

553
00:23:28,921 --> 00:23:29,620
hear people like Michael Moore saying 
that there's only a hundred Taliban or a

554
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,620
thousand Taliban.
He said,

555
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,320
living in Afghanistan,
it was 100 or thousand.

556
00:23:33,321 --> 00:23:35,770
Neither one of them is nuts.
The fact that we got 30,000

557
00:23:35,771 --> 00:23:36,610
troops over there,
I was like,

558
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,010
what do we just sent $30,000
more like,

559
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:43,180
what the fuck are we doing?
It's all so scary that we're putting our

560
00:23:43,181 --> 00:23:45,310
trust into people that are known liars.

561
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,620
You know the idea of protecting America.
The idea of being a proud citizen is 

562
00:23:51,141 --> 00:23:52,850
standing up for your country.
That's all noble.

563
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,050
The real problem is who is giving the 
Goddamn fucking orders?

564
00:23:57,051 --> 00:24:02,051
People that totally cannot be trusted 
across the board full of Shit at every 

565
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:04,880
goddamn turn,
whether it's the Gulf of Tonkin,

566
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,750
whether it's a weapons of mass 
destruction in Iraq or whatever the fuck

567
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:10,340
it may be.
You know,

568
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,830
and it's not just Republican,
it's Democrat,

569
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:17,831
it's this fucking crazy healthcare thing
and it's fucking crazy thing that's 

570
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:22,781
going on with the bank.
Bail outs were all this money is just 

571
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:23,350
flying around and there's no 
accountability.

572
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,380
Nobody knows where the fuck it's going 
and these executives that came from 

573
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,540
these companies that got big fucking 
bail out checks.

574
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,790
They're taking big bonus checks and 
saying,

575
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,140
well,
if they don't get these bonuses,

576
00:24:33,141 --> 00:24:35,120
they quit like,
fuck you.

577
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,180
What is happening?
This is a goddamn money grab.

578
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,330
Like how is this money grab going on?
The money grabs grown out because 

579
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:44,030
they're all corrupt that Democrats and 
Republicans,

580
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,180
they all owe favors to people that got 
them in office and they suck Dick and 

581
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,200
kiss ass and they let this bullshit pass
through.

582
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,130
So it's not just the Republicans.
It's not just the people who want war,

583
00:24:55,131 --> 00:24:58,150
the military industrial complex,
it's fucking all of them.

584
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:02,090
It's all of them.
We live in a horribly corrupt system.

585
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,300
That is,
we're.

586
00:25:03,301 --> 00:25:06,980
We're like sick.
We're like the human race is sick.

587
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:12,190
There's something wrong with the way we 
think and behave and or it's right and 

588
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,811
we think it's wrong to think that 
because it doesn't know because it 

589
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:21,221
doesn't have to be this way.
If you want total enjoyment for the 

590
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:24,071
people that are participating in it,
it doesn't have to be this way and the 

591
00:25:24,071 --> 00:25:27,611
way it is right now,
it's this way because too many people 

592
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:30,851
are passive and they're sitting back and
they're just allowing this life to keep 

593
00:25:30,851 --> 00:25:31,130
rolling forward in the same direction.

594
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,770
It's going in a certain direction for 
sure,

595
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,040
but it doesn't have to be negative and 
it doesn't have to fucking involve war.

596
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,760
It doesn't have to involve all the shit 
that's going on in these other countries

597
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:42,920
were being tricked into thinking it does
it.

598
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:47,940
We're supposed to be getting past that 
shit and we're supposed to be evolving 

599
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,270
in a technological sense,
but we should be evolving socially too,

600
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,640
and we're not.
We're still socially the same way.

601
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,750
We're 30,
40,

602
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:59,090
50 years ago.
We're still doing the same dumb shit 

603
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,960
where it's gigantic groups of people led
by a couple of leaders will attack 

604
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,461
another gigantic group of people and a 
bunch of fucking people that have 

605
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:07,610
nothing to do with anything die and 
someone is getting money from it all.

606
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,930
It's.
That's all it is.

607
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:14,050
It's all about resources.
Every fucking one that's ever been 

608
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:17,201
fought ever there about resources and 
it's just crazy that in 2010 we know the

609
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:20,300
real problem is we live too long.

610
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:24,020
You know,
right now we live to be 80,

611
00:26:24,021 --> 00:26:26,450
9,100.
You live long enough to figure out.

612
00:26:26,451 --> 00:26:31,451
It's all bullshit.
Back in the day when you were fighting 

613
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:34,271
for the Roman empire,
you know you died a fucking plague when 

614
00:26:34,271 --> 00:26:34,790
you're 19.
You know what I'm saying?

615
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,220
If you live to be 30 you,
you,

616
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:38,390
you did a lot of shit.
You got a long ass life.

617
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,880
You know Jesus,
they killed him at 33.

618
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,380
If he was ever real,
you know what I mean?

619
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,580
Look at all the people that live back 
then.

620
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,790
You know the holidays.
Motherfuckers live forever.

621
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:48,850
You know,
you,

622
00:26:48,851 --> 00:26:51,140
you hear about some new lady in France,
it's just,

623
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,770
you know,
100 2,626

624
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,280
smoke cigarettes,
drank red wine,

625
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,060
but the one in 26,
it's incredible.

626
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,900
People live way low and you live if you 
live past a certain point,

627
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:08,901
like you and I are very fortunate 
because we're in the entertainment 

628
00:27:08,901 --> 00:27:11,880
industry so we don't have a specific job
that we have to do every morning like we

629
00:27:11,881 --> 00:27:15,630
don't have to go to work and work on say
insurance cases all day stuff that we're

630
00:27:15,631 --> 00:27:16,350
not interested in.

631
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,700
We're lucky that we get to create and 
we're lucky that we get to do stuff that

632
00:27:20,701 --> 00:27:22,590
we find interesting,
but it's all fun.

633
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,320
But for most people that's not the case.
And when,

634
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,380
when it's not the case and when your 
whole day is filled with work and I've 

635
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,380
been there before and you've been there 
before,

636
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,270
you don't fucking think too much.
You don't figure too much out.

637
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,660
You know when you're working eight hours
a goddamn day plus and you try and get 

638
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:38,660
some overtime,
man,

639
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:39,480
because you got extra bills and credit 
card debt and shit.

640
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,730
You know,
when it gets to a certain point in time,

641
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,050
you know,
at the end of your day,

642
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:48,051
man,
you don't got time to contemplate the 

643
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:49,170
universe or culture or you know,
why people behave the way they behave.

644
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,850
No,
you just fucking keep going.

645
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,560
You know,
life has got damn hard.

646
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:58,910
You just keep fucking going.
But you and I have way more time by 

647
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,810
ourselves to think on our own than most 
people.

648
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:03,180
So you get to a certain point in time 
and you know what,

649
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,910
by the time 42,
by the time you're like 42,

650
00:28:05,911 --> 00:28:10,911
like fuck man.
The whole hustle is so obvious and 

651
00:28:10,911 --> 00:28:14,301
stupid.
It's like the same hustle that would've 

652
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,460
gotten me when I was 18.
I would've got them joined the army for 

653
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,891
sure when I was 18 for when I'm 42.
It makes me angry because somebody my 

654
00:28:18,891 --> 00:28:21,360
age is doing this hustle on someone 
who's 18,

655
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,700
you know,
not even my age older than me.

656
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,500
You know?
I mean,

657
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:27,060
it's like you motherfuckers should have 
figured it out already.

658
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,790
You motherfuckers that are older than me
that are running the planet.

659
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:32,640
You should be delivering this message.
You should have figured this out.

660
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:36,090
You should know that we're,
we're living like retards,

661
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,170
that this is nonsensical,
that this is.

662
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:40,470
No,
this is not sustainable,

663
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,830
but we could live a sustainable life and
it doesn't involve going to countries 

664
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:47,520
where you've never been in fucking up 
people you've never met.

665
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,590
It doesn't involve that.
You know,

666
00:28:49,591 --> 00:28:52,110
and this fucking argument like about our
boys.

667
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:52,470
Well,
you know,

668
00:28:52,471 --> 00:28:57,471
what do you want our boys to die?
That's how they have to behave over 

669
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:57,471
there.
That's stupid.

670
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:57,471
That's a stupid argument.
Yeah,

671
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:59,490
I know that that's how they have to 
behave when they're at war.

672
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,650
A 100 percent,
but that's not the argument.

673
00:29:01,651 --> 00:29:02,570
The argument,
this is,

674
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,730
this is nonsense.
They shouldn't fucking be there in the 

675
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:07,860
first place.
It's not that they're not heroes.

676
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:09,600
It's not that they're not brave.
They are.

677
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:11,280
Absolutely.
You have to be.

678
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,920
I mean,
that's real fucking fighting.

679
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,580
That's real.
Live killing and fighting with tanks and

680
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:20,790
missiles and jets and shit.
That must be white knuckled.

681
00:29:20,791 --> 00:29:23,580
Terrifying.
You didn't even like hurt locker,

682
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:24,300
did you?
Nope.

683
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,210
How come he didn't like hurt locker?
I thought it was boring as fuck.

684
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:29,520
You need to go to a doctor,
get your balls checked out.

685
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,430
That movie was.
We talked about this a million times.

686
00:29:32,431 --> 00:29:33,930
I know it.
Did you gotta get your balls?

687
00:29:33,931 --> 00:29:34,800
Sorry.
I'll tell you what sucks.

688
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:36,540
Clash of the titans.
Oh yeah,

689
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,690
that's stupid.
It was dumb.

690
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,470
It was so dumb.
I mean,

691
00:29:41,471 --> 00:29:42,070
I like

692
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:47,100
the special effects are kind of bad ass.
The cracking was pretty dope when the 

693
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,100
cracking comes out,
you're like,

694
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,100
God

695
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,260
thing is just like a made for TV movie.
Special effects.

696
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:51,730
Sucked ass.
I heard,

697
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,950
I kinda liked the Medusa,
you know,

698
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:57,190
the problem was there wasn't enough shit
going down,

699
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:57,520
you know?

700
00:29:58,010 --> 00:29:59,780
Yeah.
I don't want to see it.

701
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,780
Do you see hot tub time machine?
Um,

702
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:05,180
no I haven't seen that or heard.
That was bad too.

703
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:10,181
But what is this gentleman saying?
I don't like to respond too much to 

704
00:30:10,181 --> 00:30:10,640
negative people that don't know what 
he's saying.

705
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,670
Of course he's reading it.
All he cares about is his internet 

706
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:15,800
reputation.
Not even listening.

707
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,150
Huh?
And then you're talking to me.

708
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,570
Some chick asked me a question on 
twitter today.

709
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:24,890
It was one of the,
the,

710
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,040
it was one of the most ridiculous 
questions that I've ever like heard 

711
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:30,550
ever.
So I like,

712
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:33,950
look at this.
This chick says to me,

713
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:39,220
her name is Taurus spa or 12.
I don't know what the fuck it is.

714
00:30:40,491 --> 00:30:42,140
It's on my twitter feed.
She says,

715
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:47,290
Joe,
you can't seriously not believe in 

716
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,290
evolution.
You don't believe in that God.

717
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,430
Listen,
listen,

718
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,770
listen how it's worded.
You can't seriously not believe.

719
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,930
Like I didn't even know what she was 
asking.

720
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:56,540
I had lost it.
So I said saying,

721
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,380
if I can't not just,
that means I can write what the fuck.

722
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,750
Yeah.
What does that mean?

723
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,840
And then I'm saying that I said that.
I'm not saying I don't,

724
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:11,860
not,
I'm saying she don't know if I do or 

725
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:11,860
don't.

726
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,010
Yeah,
it was like fucking do something about,

727
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:17,740
um,
twitter speak and uh,

728
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,030
something about,
uh,

729
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,880
tech speak that's making people really 
retarded.

730
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:27,750
Yeah.
And it's so much better than curse of 

731
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,351
man.
I just got a letter the other day in 

732
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:29,351
cursive and it made me cry.

733
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:30,960
I will take.
No,

734
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:31,950
no.
You know,

735
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:36,120
cursive doesn't imply stupid to me.
When I read something in tech speak like

736
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,470
you are.
I go,

737
00:31:37,471 --> 00:31:39,140
God damn it.
I do it.

738
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,390
When dudes do it,
it drives me nuts.

739
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:45,590
Yeah,
but my brain immediately skipped to and 

740
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,590
understand what it was supposed to save 
recursive.

741
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,520
I'm more like,
okay,

742
00:31:46,521 --> 00:31:47,250
that's Z.

743
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,530
that's why.
Oh,

744
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,620
you apostrophe r e dot.
When you get a Goddamn text message from

745
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:57,621
me,
you're going to get a fucking 

746
00:31:57,621 --> 00:31:57,621
apostrophe.
You're going to get a U Apostrophe r,

747
00:31:57,621 --> 00:31:59,730
e mold.
School's son.

748
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,730
I'm old school so I prefer a stick 
shift.

749
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,800
There's just too much God damn traffic 
in La,

750
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,190
but I really prefer to shift my own 
fucking gears.

751
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:09,450
You know what I'm saying?
Do you like to shift your own gears?

752
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:11,520
A nine in la now?

753
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:16,770
Fuck.
Fucking nice fucking BMW or nine slash 

754
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:16,770
11 turbo or some shit.

755
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,050
You want to sit down with automatics are
means manual.

756
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,390
I don't know.
My first sports car,

757
00:32:20,391 --> 00:32:23,690
there's nothing like it so far.
I have a little BMW m three.

758
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,660
I love that thing,
but it's got the paddle shifters and the

759
00:32:26,661 --> 00:32:31,661
paddle shifters are pretty dope and 
traffic because you really can't shift 

760
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:31,760
gears when you want and you really 
control the engine,

761
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:35,840
but there's something about pressing 
that foot clutch down.

762
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,980
Put Nat gearing,
click,

763
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,970
let the off hitting the gas at the same 
time.

764
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:42,860
It's like you're in tune with the 
machine,

765
00:32:42,861 --> 00:32:44,300
man.
You're in tune with the machine.

766
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,150
I'm just pressing buttons.
I'm hitting the gas and pressing buttons

767
00:32:47,151 --> 00:32:48,350
and it's fun.
I mean,

768
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:49,710
don't get me wrong.
The fucking car.

769
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,750
It's funny shit.
These little cars now they make like 

770
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:55,190
little bmws.
They handle so good.

771
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Then they're just like.
They figured it out now and there's a 

772
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,300
crazy horse power war now,
so like regular cars that you buy are so

773
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:04,670
much more fast than they've ever been 
before.

774
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,270
This BMT old BMW before this one had 333
horsepower.

775
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,900
This one has 420.
It's fucking ridiculous.

776
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:14,090
It's as fast as my old nine slash 11 
turbo.

777
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,180
That old porsche that I was to have.
That thing was stupid fast.

778
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,390
This thing is just as fast as that,
but handles way better.

779
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:25,391
Like the balance is like perfect.
It's like you feel like you can just 

780
00:33:25,391 --> 00:33:25,970
move it like it's not even real.
It's like the gold card or something.

781
00:33:25,971 --> 00:33:27,800
You know?
It's incredible what they're doing now.

782
00:33:27,801 --> 00:33:31,130
Those new,
like those new mustangs that the shelby,

783
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:31,880
the,
the.

784
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,730
What is the,
the,

785
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,400
the GT 500.
Those fucking things have 540 horsepower

786
00:33:37,401 --> 00:33:40,280
man.
And never buy unnecessary.

787
00:33:40,281 --> 00:33:42,050
Yes,
but fun as fuck.

788
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:47,680
That's fun as fuck dude.
If you had one of those Mustang's those 

789
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,010
really fast one.
Boom Dude.

790
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,950
That does nothing for me anymore when I 
was a kid.

791
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,090
Yes.
But nowadays I'm like,

792
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:53,810
no,
I want to live.

793
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:55,460
Okay.
What if you had a weekend car would,

794
00:33:55,461 --> 00:33:57,770
if you had this and you had like a 
Mustang gt,

795
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:02,771
$500 a weekend car,
you don't think that would be fun to 

796
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:02,771
fucking.
Just,

797
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:06,370
just not safely.
I'm not talking about going down 

798
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,251
residential roads 150 miles an hour,
but that merging onto the highway to 70.

799
00:34:11,121 --> 00:34:14,090
Like that song,
you feel that fucking roar that va knows

800
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,610
fat four inch pipes.
Are you kidding me?

801
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,800
That's fun as fuck.
That is fun.

802
00:34:18,801 --> 00:34:20,570
As far I guess I haven't done it in 
awhile.

803
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,030
Yeah,
you haven't done it awhile.

804
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,090
If he did it,
did it.

805
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:25,340
Every now and then he realized that's 
fun as fuck man.

806
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,760
There's a.
You know there is going to be a limit 

807
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:30,760
though.
A certain point in time.

808
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,601
Like how fucking fast these things go.
The new nine slash 11 turbo is zero to 

809
00:34:34,601 --> 00:34:37,370
60 in three goddamn seconds.
Three seconds.

810
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,540
One,
two,

811
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,880
three 60 miles an hour.
That's insane.

812
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,190
You have stuck in texts from a girl and 
shut that shit off.

813
00:34:46,191 --> 00:34:48,840
Twenty percent battery.
Low faggot.

814
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,990
Knowledge me,
dude,

815
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,020
please.
There I did.

816
00:34:54,021 --> 00:34:55,040
I acknowledged you.
Dude.

817
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:57,380
You're way behind.
Way Behind.

818
00:34:57,381 --> 00:34:59,980
What are you talking about?
Thing?

819
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,060
It's too much.
Too many people.

820
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:07,610
Too much.
Too many people.

821
00:35:07,611 --> 00:35:10,220
Have I ever seen the movie called 
falling down with Michael Douglas.

822
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,220
His grades are good goddamn movie.
I love it.

823
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:14,750
And that's how you feel when you live in
La,

824
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:16,460
in La.
After awhile you're like,

825
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,890
no,
there's too many humans.

826
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:22,610
They did population density studies with
rats who had took rats.

827
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:24,380
They put them in a box and there was,
you know,

828
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,770
there's a certain population of rats and
they were cool with each other and then 

829
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,471
they doubled it and they started getting
a little crazy and they tripled it and 

830
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:33,410
when they got to like a high number with
a wrapper on top of each other,

831
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,350
rats developed mental illnesses just 
like human beings do.

832
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,160
There's some would sit by themselves and
shake and just like face the corner.

833
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,240
I mean they literally,
the way human beings are is mirrored and

834
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,990
population density studies for all sorts
of animals.

835
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,490
So you know,
you take us and he put us in the same.

836
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,370
The reason why people yell at each other
on the highway.

837
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:59,710
That's craziness.
Why we get so angry and angry on the 

838
00:35:59,710 --> 00:35:59,710
highway with this because we grow on top
of each other.

839
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,470
Just eat each other's energy.
All Atlantic.

840
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,280
You're not supposed to live like that.
And so that movie,

841
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,530
that movie just resonates with 
everybody.

842
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:10,540
I think when he just went fucking crazy.
When you live in at a place like La,

843
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,630
La has got 20 million people in it.
I mean that was the reason why I moved 

844
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,771
to Colorado in the first place.
I wanted to get away from this heavy 

845
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:18,771
vibration of all these people.

846
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:24,080
You know,
I don't think this is a healthy way to 

847
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,080
live.
I don't think it's a healthy thing to be

848
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,080
like this many people.
To me,

849
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,070
I feel like I'm living in a game of 
musical chairs.

850
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Like one day some shit's going to go 
down and I'm just going to have to go 

851
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:31,340
further away,
you know?

852
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,420
I don't feel like I could stay here now.
Did you feel that earthquake the other 

853
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:35,420
day?
No,

854
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:35,420
I didn't.
No,

855
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:37,260
I didn't feel it either.
I was in the car either,

856
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:42,261
but it wasn't Mexican wave.
Our friend Duncan said that his 

857
00:36:42,261 --> 00:36:43,830
bookshelf was moving.
He said it felt like you were on a boat,

858
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,420
like you're waving.
That said,

859
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:47,250
our friend,
Duncan's done a lot of acid in his.

860
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,420
Well,
I heard from a few people.

861
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,920
Same thing,
same exact thing.

862
00:36:49,921 --> 00:36:52,740
Wavy motions,
like three people told me,

863
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,330
well,
it was a pretty big one.

864
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:55,800
It was a seven point.
Oh,

865
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:01,520
six point six point nine or something 
like that or something else in Baja 

866
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,350
California and that's like Mexico.
Right?

867
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,220
Then there was Jesse Ventura lives,
I don't know.

868
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,530
It's fucking government and then 15 
minutes later,

869
00:37:07,531 --> 00:37:12,531
20 minutes later there was like a four 
point three over north north of Los 

870
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:14,400
Angeles.
The government try to fly with me.

871
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,450
That's bad.
Jesse Ventura impression.

872
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,440
That's great.
He said that the dude who lives in 

873
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Mexico,
half the year,

874
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,320
seven point two,
I think that's pretty cool.

875
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,000
Seven point two,
seven point eight.

876
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,710
Indonesia.
Two hours ago.

877
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,070
Is that true?
Okay.

878
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,540
I'm going to have to check that shit out
because that's ridiculous.

879
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,690
I might have to run and hide in the 
basement and that Shit's real traffic.

880
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:40,970
Indonesia sir.
Let's move to North Carolina.

881
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,470
Yeah,
right.

882
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,720
How cool is that?
Right?

883
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,880
North Carolina has taken about that 
lately.

884
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:53,450
Massive earthquake rock,
southern Sumatra and Indonesia.

885
00:37:53,451 --> 00:37:56,450
Seven point eight on the Richter scale.
Whoa,

886
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,190
motherfucker.
It's true.

887
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:03,020
For minutes ago.
This is on these websites.

888
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:06,250
God Damn,
I love this little latest results thing.

889
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,940
It scrolls down.
It shows you all the shit.

890
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,060
I love that.
Google is the shit.

891
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:16,270
Okay.
I'm willing to give up some personal 

892
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:16,270
liberty so the google could be running.
Shit.

893
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,930
See what else we've got here,
son.

894
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,730
Um,
these podcast.

895
00:38:23,731 --> 00:38:28,731
Spent a lot of fun and met a lot of 
people last week on the road in New York

896
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,050
and in North Carolina.
And thank you all.

897
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:32,310
Oh very

898
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,600
much for coming out.
And uh,

899
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:36,100
I'm glad you enjoy the podcast.
We love doing it man.

900
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:40,780
It's fun as shit.
We a tesla got fucked by Rockefeller.

901
00:38:40,781 --> 00:38:41,440
Yes,
he did.

902
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:46,560
You know the,
the best version of that story is a 

903
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,790
Duncan trussell's drunk history.
I don't have a link to the video,

904
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:53,791
but I'll put it up before you guys.
I'm going to find the video for you 

905
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:54,100
because it's so cool.
It's funny or die.

906
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,210
Duncan trussell

907
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,290
drunk history.

908
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,090
They get Duncan Super,
super drunk and he asked.

909
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,630
There it is right there.
Job History.

910
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,720
Okay.
I'm going to put this shit on twitter.

911
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:14,360
Content.
Objective terms.

912
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,430
You going back to that,
your search results.

913
00:39:16,431 --> 00:39:19,480
There was a video in a daily motions 
stolen Fox.

914
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,280
That's hilarious.

915
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,070
Yeah,
it's amazing.

916
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:26,720
Okay.

917
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:29,140
Don't get in.
Was so wasted it.

918
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,370
They can get on like bottles of Tequila 
and shit out.

919
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,270
Absence Block.
Oh yeah.

920
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:35,050
Absence.
Right,

921
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,580
right.
Have you ever done that shit?

922
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,360
Never did.
The roommate never did enough to have 

923
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,360
it.

924
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:45,670
Like I feel it or anything I don't think
I did a long time ago.

925
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,860
What is is?
Um,

926
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,000
what does Duncan's a Duncan Trussell d 
one s or two

927
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:03,510
to t r U,
s s e l l

928
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,570
I have to keep my mouth props on the 
twitter.

929
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:26,350
It's hilarious.
You gotTa Watch this drunk history 

930
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:26,350
thing.
It's really a pretty spectacular.

931
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:28,770
But for the people that are tuning into 
itunes right now and you ain't,

932
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,100
you get no link.
You motherfuckers,

933
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,750
you don't even know what we're talking 
about.

934
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:35,630
Duncan trussell,
drunk history.

935
00:40:35,631 --> 00:40:36,890
If you google that,
they'll,

936
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,950
they'll be a website up where you can 
watch,

937
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,250
you can watch the youtube clip,
you can watch it on funny or die.

938
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:44,960
You can watch it a couple of different 
places.

939
00:40:44,961 --> 00:40:46,790
But it's hilarious.
And Yeah,

940
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:51,320
a Edison was a con westing house.
There were constant.

941
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:56,321
Tessa was a genius,
but in their Defense Tesla also fell in 

942
00:40:56,321 --> 00:40:58,580
love with a pigeon.
Yeah.

943
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,610
And he had an issue where he destroyed 
his sexuality,

944
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,840
like he had some fucking crazy problem 
with some actress and he fell in love 

945
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,960
with her and you know,
this is all like really vague stuff.

946
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,360
But the,
in his own words,

947
00:41:11,361 --> 00:41:14,940
he destroyed his sexuality and they 
don't know if they could cast,

948
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,100
rated themselves.
They don't know what.

949
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:19,220
It was also a lot of speculation that he
might've been gay or whatever to,

950
00:41:19,221 --> 00:41:19,830
you know,
he was,

951
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,370
he was definitely a loan.
But again,

952
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:27,371
I think you have to be alone to be like 
the fucking greatest genius that the 

953
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:27,470
world has ever known.
I mean that guy was nuts,

954
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:32,500
man.
That got created all kinds of shit 

955
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:32,990
alternating current and you know,
who you like literally.

956
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,920
I mean you created a way to fucking 
broadcast electricity through the air.

957
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,740
You know,
the only problem with it was a,

958
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,120
it would be like free Wifi.
They wouldn't be able to control it.

959
00:41:41,121 --> 00:41:43,160
Like to have it in your house,
you'd just be able to have it.

960
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,220
But I guess now you could have like a 
password you've paid for the password.

961
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:49,090
Well they already do that in some cities
they have city wide Wifi.

962
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:49,160
Yeah.

963
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,110
It's free.
Yeah.

964
00:41:50,111 --> 00:41:52,000
But I'm not talking about them.
I'm talking about electricity.

965
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:57,150
Oh,
talking about if they would be able to 

966
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:57,150
do that with electricity,
like and put a password on it.

967
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,260
The way we put a password on Wifi today.
Either way,

968
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:04,470
Nikolai Tesla is a perfect example of 
what we were talking about earlier is a 

969
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,190
dude who's just gigantic super fucking 
genius.

970
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:10,480
Like the greatest genius ever end.
Completely Bat Shit Insane.

971
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:15,890
Just just,
just out of his fucking mind claimed 

972
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,340
that all of his information he received 
from aliens that he would,

973
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:23,341
uh,
he would tune into alien signals and 

974
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:23,341
they would tell him I'd do all those 
stuff,

975
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:24,640
you know,
I want,

976
00:42:24,641 --> 00:42:29,641
I always wonder about that man.
I always wonder where the fuck ideas 

977
00:42:29,641 --> 00:42:30,410
come from.
You know,

978
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,580
what if ideas are literally like a 
living organism.

979
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,950
What if ideas are like,
you know,

980
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,080
you know,
when we think about like parasites,

981
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,750
we talked about this before,
like parasites infecting a host,

982
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:46,290
you know,
and they take over the host body like 

983
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:46,660
that grasshopper that gets infected by 
this worm.

984
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,200
The aquatic worms grows inside the 
grasshopper to maturity and then when it

985
00:42:50,201 --> 00:42:52,600
gets to maturity,
it convinces the grasshopper that it has

986
00:42:52,601 --> 00:42:57,601
to jump in the water and drown.
So the grasshopper commit suicide so 

987
00:42:57,601 --> 00:43:01,261
that this warm can come out of it.
What if like language and ideas 

988
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:05,821
literally are like another sort of 
organism and what if like they are 

989
00:43:05,831 --> 00:43:09,820
manipulating our consciousness.
You know what if like language and ideas

990
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:14,821
and all these different things that 
people come up with a creativity in 

991
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:14,821
people.
When people are creative about things,

992
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:15,820
they pull these things down out of the 
air.

993
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:16,750
I mean,
what are you doing?

994
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:17,650
You freak them out

995
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,720
because I could see it.
I can see today we're going to do this 

996
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,420
podcast.
Are you going to play on the fight?

997
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:27,980
I'm trying to do some tech support here 
to see if are you stream shows?

998
00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:29,420
It could be.
We don't need to see it.

999
00:43:29,421 --> 00:43:34,421
We can watch it on here.
I'm not really bothered because you were

1000
00:43:34,701 --> 00:43:37,070
not having a conversation.
The conversation,

1001
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:39,740
you're talking about theories and I'm 
listening to talk back then,

1002
00:43:39,741 --> 00:43:40,720
motherfucker.
I'm not gonna.

1003
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:45,740
Interrupt your theories.
I don't understand why you need to in 

1004
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,580
there and I've seen this flash of your 
fucking line saying that.

1005
00:43:46,581 --> 00:43:48,650
I am Brian,
why are you arguing with me?

1006
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:50,990
I am and we're know.
What am I lying.

1007
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:56,050
No,
defending yourself when I'm telling you 

1008
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,250
it's distracting.
Sorry for listening to you while looking

1009
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:02,090
at trying to do something and doing it 
more than it's tech support.

1010
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:04,310
Not at Brian.
Stop arguing with me.

1011
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:07,870
I'm not asking you to do this.
Jesus.

1012
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,370
That seems very unnecessary too.
It's not unnecessary.

1013
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,520
Brian,
you're distracting me.

1014
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,000
You Distract me by Web surfing in front 
of me and I'm looking at your screen.

1015
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,100
Was I web surfing?
Whatever you're doing,

1016
00:44:19,101 --> 00:44:24,101
I'm seeing you fucking flipping through 
pages and you're not listening to what 

1017
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:24,101
I'm saying.
Okay?

1018
00:44:24,101 --> 00:44:26,140
We're not having a conversation.
I.

1019
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:31,180
We weren't having a fight.
You're talking about theory about 

1020
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:31,180
something.
I'm listening to thing.

1021
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,220
We're doing right here.
This is 724 people

1022
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,950
understand.
It's called the podcast show.

1023
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:36,990
You were doing a theory.
I was listening to you watching you flip

1024
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:41,991
through this fucking thing.
You're not listening to me because I'm 

1025
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:41,991
trying to do something for the show.
Brian.

1026
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:42,660
Brian,
don't do it.

1027
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:43,840
I told you not to do it earlier

1028
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:50,610
is we're just had a little girl back.
Little hissy fit

1029
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,700
the IPADS,
fucking evil ipad.

1030
00:44:55,701 --> 00:44:57,530
He's right guys.
Had the IPADS.

1031
00:44:57,531 --> 00:45:00,530
Evil.
It's causing you to do that too.

1032
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,690
What do you do?
If I wasn't doing that,

1033
00:45:02,691 --> 00:45:05,540
I would have been doing the same thing.
We're talking.

1034
00:45:05,541 --> 00:45:07,530
I would expect that.
You know when you're talking.

1035
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:12,531
I do the same.
I think we know when people are talking 

1036
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:12,531
to each other,
they sit back,

1037
00:45:12,531 --> 00:45:12,770
the other person listens to you,
but you're doing a bunch of shit.

1038
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,690
I'm just telling you,
man,

1039
00:45:13,691 --> 00:45:16,660
I do a bunch of shit while I'm talking.
I know you're not listening to Joe,

1040
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,250
Joe,
Joe.

1041
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,210
It's not that.
If I were to go off for 15 minutes,

1042
00:45:20,211 --> 00:45:22,820
10 minutes at a time,
you would do the exact same thing.

1043
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:24,260
Yes.
You would not what?

1044
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:29,270
We're talking 20 minutes talking about 
20 minutes and would you want a podcast?

1045
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,720
We're not having this conversation 
though.

1046
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:34,160
Brian.
Jesus Christ.

1047
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:36,050
Why are you defending this?
Because your attention.

1048
00:45:36,051 --> 00:45:37,350
Really simple.
I'm not attacking.

1049
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,290
Yes twice to stop looking at that 
fucking thing that it's distracting.

1050
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:46,330
It will look at this thing.
Then it's in front of us doing the same 

1051
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:46,330
thing.
No,

1052
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:48,350
it's not because you're not flipping 
through things and moving stuff around.

1053
00:45:48,351 --> 00:45:51,440
I can tell you not paying attention and 
it's distracting me.

1054
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,910
Okay.
Sorry.

1055
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:54,830
Okay.
Damn.

1056
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,710
Have I looked into the Illuminati?
What if harp cause the earthquakes.

1057
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:01,510
Shut the fuck up.
Okay.

1058
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:04,390
Whoever you are.
God Damn it with your nonsense.

1059
00:46:04,391 --> 00:46:09,391
Go read some David eick books.
Well,

1060
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:11,860
red bands.
The man.

1061
00:46:11,861 --> 00:46:12,850
Shut the fuck up.
Jo.

1062
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,740
How dare you.
Listen,

1063
00:46:14,741 --> 00:46:16,720
we have moved on you fox,
but I have to.

1064
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:19,060
I have to set this board straight.
Well,

1065
00:46:19,061 --> 00:46:21,860
we got issues.
Okay.

1066
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,530
Let's go to what?
We're going to go to the Rogan board.

1067
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,710
Go to my website and find some of the 
questions.

1068
00:46:27,711 --> 00:46:30,140
People are there to try to change gears 
here.

1069
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:34,530
Okay.
Let's get some questions.

1070
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:37,840
Sarah,
can you give us.

1071
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,160
Can you talk about being more flexible?
Any books you already recommend on 

1072
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,800
stretching and flexibility?
Just take yoga.

1073
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:45,960
If you really want to learn how to suck 
your own Dick.

1074
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:47,340
That's why you're.
That's why you're asking.

1075
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:51,530
God Damn it.
You said you hung out with Ron Jeremy.

1076
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,040
Oh,
he was at the party.

1077
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:53,740
I was at the other day.

1078
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,910
Did you guys,
did you hang out with your talk and I 

1079
00:46:58,910 --> 00:46:59,850
said hi to on that about it.
He used to be able to suck his dick.

1080
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:04,590
That's why I had a bit my act about it,
but he got too fat.

1081
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:08,340
Then the joke was that that's all 
overrated.

1082
00:47:08,341 --> 00:47:09,270
Sucking your own Dick.
Is

1083
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,050
that guy never just sit at home and 
watches TV,

1084
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,540
does he?
Because that dudes out.

1085
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:15,520
I mean I see that guy at least once a 
month.

1086
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,810
Yeah,
somewhere he's,

1087
00:47:16,811 --> 00:47:17,770
you know,
it's kind of funny.

1088
00:47:17,890 --> 00:47:21,220
He's like really into being like a 
mainstream or like success,

1089
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,340
you know?
He would always tell me about things 

1090
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:27,601
that he's done,
like I'm not doing this new movie with 

1091
00:47:27,601 --> 00:47:27,760
this guy and I'm,
I do a cameo on this TV show,

1092
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:28,900
you know,
and he's like,

1093
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,500
I'm trying to make it as a mainstream 
actor.

1094
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:31,710
And I'm like,
Dude,

1095
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,460
you're fucking Ron Jeremy.
Okay,

1096
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:38,461
and do you understand that you'll like a
hero to ugly fat dudes all across the 

1097
00:47:38,461 --> 00:47:42,661
world.
You fucked the hottest women on the 

1098
00:47:42,661 --> 00:47:42,661
planet.
He's fucked all of them.

1099
00:47:42,661 --> 00:47:46,921
Every single one of them,
he has a giant Dick and he's fucked all 

1100
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:47,650
of them.
Hard slaps them around.

1101
00:47:47,651 --> 00:47:50,560
Fuck some doggy style nuts in their 
mouth and face.

1102
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,540
I mean,
he's a goddamn champion.

1103
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:53,710
He's a champion.

1104
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:59,010
And that was something that you thought 
was going to be the thing that you feel 

1105
00:47:59,010 --> 00:47:59,030
like it can be a champion about.
You know,

1106
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,160
like a lot of people are like,
Oh,

1107
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:01,810
you fucking 5,000
hot chicks.

1108
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,710
That'd be like,
Oh God,

1109
00:48:02,711 --> 00:48:03,850
I feel horrible.
You know

1110
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:06,070
what?
You really think people would think that

1111
00:48:06,071 --> 00:48:08,680
that's a bad thing.
Like a regular guy that never gets laid,

1112
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:13,681
that looks like him to a regular guy 
that looks like blasting logs look like 

1113
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:13,681
that.
That's true.

1114
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:15,560
He looked pretty fonzie back in the day.
Fuzzy.

1115
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,920
He was a decent looking guy when he was 
younger,

1116
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,120
but he was never like a hot stud,
you know?

1117
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,410
These girls are tens,
you know what I mean?

1118
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:28,470
And now he's like this gross fat hairy 
guy with great chest hairs and he's 

1119
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:33,361
still banging them all the new ones.
All the new ones have to to pay homage 

1120
00:48:33,361 --> 00:48:33,670
to the staff at the thing.
Right.

1121
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:35,530
He's like a superhero for horn.
Yeah.

1122
00:48:35,531 --> 00:48:37,780
If you're a dude who looks like him in 
Jersey,

1123
00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:39,440
you know you're a fucking mailman or 
you're,

1124
00:48:39,441 --> 00:48:44,441
you know,
you're delivering sausages to the 

1125
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:44,441
fucking local supermarket.
Ron.

1126
00:48:44,441 --> 00:48:47,590
Jeremy looks like you and he's banging 
tens and you can't get laid at all.

1127
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,680
You know,
you're lucky if you get some toothless 

1128
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,511
blowjob from some hunts point hooker 
that just makes you check your balls 

1129
00:48:54,511 --> 00:48:56,620
every five seconds for the next three 
days looking for herpes sores.

1130
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:57,750
You know what I mean?
You,

1131
00:48:57,751 --> 00:48:59,170
you,
you're lucky if that's,

1132
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:04,230
you know,
that's as good as you can get in and 

1133
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:04,230
that's going to cost you a hundred 50 
bucks or whatever the fuck it cost Ya,

1134
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,360
you know this,
this motherfucker's just bang and you 

1135
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:09,360
looks just like you and he's banging 
them all.

1136
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,790
But hang on,
I can't wait to these chest Harris.

1137
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,060
Turn Gray.
Really look sexy.

1138
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,310
You everything about shaving that

1139
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,660
I hated you.
I fucking hate shaving because what 

1140
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,900
looks better?
How like being an animal of being a man 

1141
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,051
or having white little red bumps 
everywhere with ingrown hairs and 

1142
00:49:28,051 --> 00:49:29,070
stubble.
And you look like A.

1143
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:31,510
I just think you're supposed to let it 
go.

1144
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:33,760
You're supposed to be a man.
Supposed to be an animal.

1145
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,790
Saving your fucking problem,
but she jitsu is if you,

1146
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:41,791
especially with you,
train with the guys grabbed you right 

1147
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:41,791
here.
Fuck that.

1148
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:41,791
Grab your,
you know,

1149
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,420
your,
your collar and when they grabbed your,

1150
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:48,450
your uh,
your collar that grab fistfuls of chest 

1151
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:48,450
hair and it hurts like a motherfucker 
might have gay man,

1152
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,400
Gay mad key.
You're supposed to have a gay man.

1153
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:57,050
Yeah.
But they grab it through through the 

1154
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:57,050
Geek.
I mean that's the.

1155
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:57,050
He gets caught up in the chest hairs 
back.

1156
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,340
There's a lot of like guard passes where
guys on top of you and he pushes down on

1157
00:50:00,341 --> 00:50:02,680
the collar and grabs it and they always 
get a fiscal.

1158
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:03,010
People

1159
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:08,210
grab your chest hair,
you get like ringworm staph effects and 

1160
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:08,210
there's no reason to be doing Jujitsu.

1161
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:12,900
Definitely hard to justify sometimes.
Think about injuries.

1162
00:50:12,901 --> 00:50:14,960
I mean I've gone through since doing 
Jujitsu,

1163
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,030
I've gone through two knee surgeries,
one meniscus,

1164
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:25,890
one reconstruction.
I've had all sorts of fucking back 

1165
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:26,270
problems.
And so why?

1166
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,920
Why the.
Why not?

1167
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:28,070
One

1168
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:31,610
of the things like if you had like a 
stove that smelled like gas,

1169
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:36,611
you're always burning herself.
There was always flames coming out of 

1170
00:50:36,611 --> 00:50:36,650
it.
Why would you keep on using that stone?

1171
00:50:36,651 --> 00:50:37,340
Why would they keep it

1172
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,190
surfing when the crash and get scratched
up?

1173
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:42,170
It's so much fucking fun to keep doing 
it.

1174
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:44,840
Jujitsu when you get good at it is 
really fun,

1175
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,070
Dude.
It's really fun.

1176
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:46,910
You're,
you're,

1177
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:51,970
you're going basically hand to hand 
combat and you're doing it with good 

1178
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:52,100
friends.
Like these guys that I did you just to,

1179
00:50:52,101 --> 00:50:53,130
with,
you know,

1180
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,820
you would trust each other with 
basically each other's lives,

1181
00:50:55,821 --> 00:50:56,570
you know,
when I do get,

1182
00:50:56,571 --> 00:51:01,571
gets my back and chokes me and I tapped.
I'm trusting that he's going to let me 

1183
00:51:01,571 --> 00:51:04,000
go before he fucking kills me because 
basically he's got to a point where he's

1184
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:09,010
killing me.
And that's the same thing with you when 

1185
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,591
you get on top of a dude and you're 
finishing off a choke or an arm bar or 

1186
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:14,441
something and the guy start tapping.
He's basically trusting that you're not 

1187
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:14,441
going to injure him,
you know?

1188
00:51:14,441 --> 00:51:15,050
And sometimes people get injured 
accidentally,

1189
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:17,390
but the amount of times that I don't get
injured,

1190
00:51:17,391 --> 00:51:19,760
it's way more the amount of continent.
Do you know?

1191
00:51:19,761 --> 00:51:24,761
I get injured but I've had these 
operations and shit over the course of 

1192
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:26,000
doing Jujitsu for 14 years.
It's a long ass time,

1193
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,340
you know,
and the first year,

1194
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:31,670
so first couple of years I had a knee 
issue that I had.

1195
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:34,820
I already had like the knee surgery on 
my left knee.

1196
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:35,860
The meniscus,
I have the,

1197
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,760
the meniscus problem for years before 
that.

1198
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:42,761
So it was a preexisting injury,
so really the only major one that I had 

1199
00:51:42,761 --> 00:51:45,821
was the knee surgery,
but he's just get it fixed and you 

1200
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:45,821
fucking heal up and you've just train 
smarter.

1201
00:51:45,821 --> 00:51:50,351
Next time you realize,
don't put yourself in bad positions and 

1202
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:50,351
don't train with spazzes.
That's another thing.

1203
00:51:50,351 --> 00:51:52,850
You've got to make sure you don't train 
with anybody that you don't trust.

1204
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,820
You know,
it's very important guys.

1205
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,990
Uh,
some guys are just a little too nutty.

1206
00:51:57,110 --> 00:51:59,090
They,
they fucking spazzed out on you when you

1207
00:51:59,091 --> 00:52:04,091
train and you gotta be real careful 
those dudes because they want to win so 

1208
00:52:04,091 --> 00:52:07,421
badly.
The best guys are the guys who were 

1209
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:07,421
really good because guys are really 
good.

1210
00:52:07,421 --> 00:52:09,710
Even though the tap you out,
even though you know they can beat you,

1211
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:12,050
they're going to beat you with technique
and you're much safer.

1212
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,300
You literally safer with a guy who can 
kick your ass,

1213
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,420
who's a black belt than you are with a 
guy who's strong,

1214
00:52:17,421 --> 00:52:19,380
who's a blue belt because that's strong 
blue.

1215
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,500
My fucking dive on your foot and break 
it.

1216
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:23,090
You know,
he might try to get you into foot locker

1217
00:52:23,330 --> 00:52:28,330
and get ahold of it so quick,
trying to tap you out that he hurts you 

1218
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:28,330
before you even get a chance to tap.

1219
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,090
You know,
it's a,

1220
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:32,240
it's a very tricky thing,
but doing it good is so much fun.

1221
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,320
Dude.
It's so much fun.

1222
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:36,590
It's so much fun and it's.
You don't think about anything else.

1223
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:38,630
It really is like a form of meditation.
You know,

1224
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,840
when you're in there and you're going at
it and your role in with each other,

1225
00:52:41,841 --> 00:52:44,330
you're not thinking about your bills,
you're not thinking about you gotta wash

1226
00:52:44,331 --> 00:52:46,220
your car and your laundry.
No.

1227
00:52:46,221 --> 00:52:48,200
You're thinking,
I've got to survive here.

1228
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:49,850
I got to get out of the situation.
I got gotta.

1229
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,280
You know,
I've got to get into full guard.

1230
00:52:52,281 --> 00:52:53,870
I got to pass his guard.
I got him out.

1231
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,480
I gotta I gotta finish him.
I got to stop them from finishing me.

1232
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,130
That's all you're thinking about is the 
moon,

1233
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,740
the moment and whenever you're involved 
in something like that,

1234
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:03,680
that's that intense.
It's like a form of meditation,

1235
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:08,970
you know,
but don't you think that way about like 

1236
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,620
art sometimes,
like when you're at your best and your 

1237
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:11,620
like with your video editing or whether 
you're creating something,

1238
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,250
like when you're right in the middle of 
it all,

1239
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:14,870
you only thinking about shit but what 
you're doing,

1240
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:15,500
you know?

1241
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,020
Yeah.
But it's always getting,

1242
00:53:17,050 --> 00:53:20,200
getting it done.
It's never like I'm enjoying it.

1243
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,700
Oh No,
fuck no.

1244
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,290
When I,
when I'm painting a painting,

1245
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:25,210
when I'm editing a video and I'm doing 
anything,

1246
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,280
it's getting it done.

1247
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,330
It's not,
I'm not having,

1248
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:32,810
I'm not having fun while doing it.
They all have spurts of fun while I'm 

1249
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:32,810
like going,
oh,

1250
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:37,431
that's a great idea,
but that's not like I'm like bone or 

1251
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:37,431
style going,
oh,

1252
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:37,431
I can't wait to finish this.

1253
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,770
Really?
Wow.

1254
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,190
Yeah,
you don't.

1255
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:41,500
Is that an attitude thing?

1256
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:42,640
Is it I,
you know,

1257
00:53:42,641 --> 00:53:44,920
I don't know.
I mean that I,

1258
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:49,921
I guess I consider that you creativity.
I consider I'm trying to get something 

1259
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:53,290
out of my brain and do something else as
fast as possible.

1260
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:58,291
While I have the idea in my head,
like I'm trying to take my ideas and 

1261
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:02,821
thoughts out of my head and put it in a 
form as fast as possible before I lose 

1262
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:04,840
the original thought,
right idea.

1263
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,490
So it's not like,
oh,

1264
00:54:06,491 --> 00:54:07,960
I love this idea.
I can't wait to do it.

1265
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:12,130
Mine is just trying to get what I want.
What I thought of out fast.

1266
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:15,550
I'm making notes with the iphone using 
that little uh,

1267
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:20,610
application.
But I don't like that I have to fucking 

1268
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:20,610
go in the menu,
find it,

1269
00:54:20,610 --> 00:54:20,770
press that,
press record.

1270
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:26,130
I think I'm going to get like a little 
tiny voice notes thing and when I have 

1271
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,160
ideas like that when I'm writing and I 
have an idea,

1272
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:32,190
but I'm trying to write it down,
I think I'm just going to press it and 

1273
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:32,190
say the idea into it.
So I know for sure that I'm not going to

1274
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:32,500
lose it,

1275
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,750
you know?
I mean like,

1276
00:54:33,751 --> 00:54:35,400
do you have your iphone night record,
abby?

1277
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:37,230
Just open up program,
hit record.

1278
00:54:37,290 --> 00:54:38,630
That's it.

1279
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:42,150
But I want to be able to just one press 
and it's recorded.

1280
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:45,360
You know what I mean?
Step two projects for real.

1281
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:46,440
I mean,
it sounds ridiculous,

1282
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,670
but it is.
I mean,

1283
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:48,540
it is that.

1284
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:52,550
Yeah,
I mean I have the biggest problem,

1285
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:57,551
like I will have an idea that might be 
the coolest thing I've ever thought of 

1286
00:54:57,551 --> 00:54:58,120
and if I,
uh,

1287
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,950
last or wait like five seconds,
10 seconds,

1288
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,390
I might accidentally think of something 
else.

1289
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:07,391
And that idea has gone down so much and 
now I know it's mostly when I was 

1290
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,620
smoking weed because lately I've been 
smoking weed maybe once,

1291
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,490
twice a week instead of almost everyday.
And My,

1292
00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:15,200
I feel so much sharper.
My memory is so much better.

1293
00:55:15,201 --> 00:55:20,201
It's amazing how much better I feel 
already and I'm just just from cutting 

1294
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:20,201
it.
Well

1295
00:55:20,201 --> 00:55:24,660
you also,
you also don't exercise that much 

1296
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:24,660
either.
That's a big part about the weed.

1297
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,990
You got to blow that out of your system,
you know,

1298
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:31,140
it's not just a.
If you just sit around and just keep 

1299
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,181
smoking weed everyday,
everyday we'd starts to lose the effect 

1300
00:55:33,181 --> 00:55:34,900
and then you start to have to get more 
weed too to kind of an ad.

1301
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,270
You're like,
you're like flooding your system.

1302
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,610
You know?
I think that when you smoke weed,

1303
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:44,900
you can you shit,
like if you want to do something 

1304
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:44,900
creatively,
you can't smoke too much.

1305
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:45,610
You gotta have one hit,
one hits good.

1306
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:50,820
If you have two or three,
you might lose track of what the fuck 

1307
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:50,860
you're talking about.
Sometimes it's fun to have two or three,

1308
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:53,530
but for the most part one it's a little 
bit.

1309
00:55:53,590 --> 00:55:58,590
I read this or this professor not read 
or saw this interview once with this 

1310
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,310
professor is a um,
uh,

1311
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,010
a,
a,

1312
00:56:00,011 --> 00:56:01,720
I think he was a physics professor.

1313
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,790
Pretty sure when he was talking about 
marijuana and he was saying that he 

1314
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:11,010
smokes a little bit.
He said that the key is to not overdo 

1315
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:12,010
it.
I smoked one hit and I go on walks and I

1316
00:56:12,011 --> 00:56:13,870
contemplate my theories,
you know,

1317
00:56:13,871 --> 00:56:17,560
and he says that that one hit,
he says it's like a magical push,

1318
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,020
like a little boost just helps give 
some,

1319
00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,100
give some,
a little momentum,

1320
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:22,720
little wind in his sails,
you know,

1321
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:25,060
and it starts the ball rolling.
You know,

1322
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:27,170
don't you ever think that like sometimes
you're creating something,

1323
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:29,650
you're trying to do something and you're
not smoking weed and you're like,

1324
00:56:29,651 --> 00:56:34,651
God,
so I get anywhere and then you smoke a 

1325
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:34,651
little weed and then also Bam,
right?

1326
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,640
The main thing I think it is,
it just gives you a different 

1327
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:40,640
perspective,
but the same idea that you,

1328
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,840
you're,
you're thinking almost like you're 

1329
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:44,840
multitasking,
you're thinking one way this way and you

1330
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,790
smoke weed and you can think of it a 
different way and that's one of the only

1331
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:49,320
ways you could ever do that.
You know,

1332
00:56:49,850 --> 00:56:53,100
it's changing your brain.
I mean you probably do it on cough syrup

1333
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,720
and think of it a different way,
you know,

1334
00:56:54,721 --> 00:56:55,480
but,
but we,

1335
00:56:55,590 --> 00:57:00,590
I think is most effective and fastest 
and reliable because you're so used to 

1336
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:00,590
that

1337
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,810
other side.
George Carlin had an interesting take on

1338
00:57:02,811 --> 00:57:04,310
writing what he would do,
who is right,

1339
00:57:04,311 --> 00:57:09,311
who would write everything first sober,
and then he would smoke a joint and go 

1340
00:57:09,311 --> 00:57:13,241
over it,
which I think is kind of interesting 

1341
00:57:13,241 --> 00:57:15,970
because it's kind of like he put up the 
skeleton of the house first and then he 

1342
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:15,970
starts adding up.

1343
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,370
Don't do it the other way around that 
because then it always sucks,

1344
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,030
you know,
I think if you,

1345
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:22,300
if you die

1346
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:27,450
sometimes you can come up with some 
crazy shit and then if you go over it 

1347
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:27,450
sober you go,
oh,

1348
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:28,630
this is too ridiculous.
And then you can edit it.

1349
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,030
I think the combination of the two is 
what's important.

1350
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:31,620
Yeah.
I don't know.

1351
00:57:31,630 --> 00:57:33,760
I don't know if it's necessary which 
order.

1352
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:38,930
I think.
I think thinking of the idea sober and 

1353
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,310
then going off on the idea stoned always
helps.

1354
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,600
I have better odds that way.

1355
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:44,010
Yeah.
Maybe I think,

1356
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,810
uh,
I might want to do that with my writing.

1357
00:57:45,811 --> 00:57:47,880
I might want to label it,
you know,

1358
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:52,890
uh,
like s t and s o stoned and sober and 

1359
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:54,760
like,
so I'll write s,

1360
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:55,920
t e s o,
so you know,

1361
00:57:55,921 --> 00:57:58,860
I did it stone and edited sober or like,
you know,

1362
00:57:58,950 --> 00:57:59,690
sos to.

1363
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:05,030
I have some funny stone jokes that I 
write and I look at them and they are 

1364
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:07,070
fucking crazy.
Let me see if I could pick out one

1365
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,630
real quick.
The bit that I do in my act.

1366
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:15,690
That is totally true that I wrote down 
something when I was high and then I 

1367
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,721
went to,
to read it when I was sober and it's 

1368
00:58:18,721 --> 00:58:18,730
like a unicorn is a donkey from the 
future.

1369
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:24,750
I looked at him like,
how could I have ever possibly thought 

1370
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:24,750
that that was something that I needed to
write down?

1371
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:29,340
That is for sure a sure.
A sure sign that I got way too fucked 

1372
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:29,340
up.
All right.

1373
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,820
Here's one of my stone jokes.
Marble,

1374
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,550
marble industry has to be hurting right 
now.

1375
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:39,410
Remember when you're a kid,
what the fuck does marbles nowadays?

1376
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,740
That's actually funny.

1377
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:44,560
That really is funny.
That's awesome.

1378
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:48,910
That's hilarious.
New Comedy tour.

1379
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:52,370
Have to show stoned half silver.
The problem with that is I would have to

1380
00:58:52,371 --> 00:58:54,950
like start out sober and then step off 
stage,

1381
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:00,190
go outside and get high and that's when 
the cops grabbed me because mother 

1382
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:00,190
fuckers

1383
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:00,190
twitter,
he laying in.

1384
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:04,611
Wait.
The words on twitter is when you find 

1385
00:59:04,611 --> 00:59:04,800
out that you're following a fake Lisa 
Kudrow,

1386
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:09,980
you feel ashamed and disgusted,
but you're not ashamed that you were 

1387
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:09,980
following her to begin with.

1388
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,780
I follow everybody.
I can.

1389
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,480
I mean there's no one that I follow a 
lot of real dummies,

1390
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:20,630
a lot of really dumb celebrities.
It's really annoying an end to 

1391
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:26,020
themselves.
I follow people that like give out like 

1392
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:29,051
really patronizing advice and like 
ridiculous God quotes and just really 

1393
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:30,870
dumb shit,
you know,

1394
00:59:31,310 --> 00:59:32,900
twit.
Some really dumb shit.

1395
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:36,110
Deepak Chopra is.
Some of this stuff is just like,

1396
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,940
why are you fucking talking about Deepak
Chopra?

1397
00:59:40,970 --> 00:59:43,640
You don't know who he is.
He's like some really famous authors.

1398
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:46,570
Like a ace has a lot of brilliant shit.
Now I've,

1399
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,280
let's do a lot of his interviews.
He says a lot of brilliant shit,

1400
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:52,310
but God damn some of his tweets make me 
want to kick him in the Dick.

1401
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,550
The balance.
He's missing the balance.

1402
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:56,840
My friends

1403
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,520
take a Brownie at the start.
That's not a bad idea,

1404
01:00:02,521 --> 01:00:07,521
but the problem with brownies,
brownies and comedy do not mix my 

1405
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:11,001
friend.
If I took a Brownie at the start of my 

1406
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:11,001
act and our end of the act,
when the Brownie kicked in,

1407
01:00:11,001 --> 01:00:13,320
I would be so high.
I would not be able to function.

1408
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:14,940
When I get really high on brownies,
man,

1409
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:17,430
I don't want him to be talking.
I don't want to talk to people.

1410
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,330
That stuff's too strong.
I can't trust edibles.

1411
01:00:20,930 --> 01:00:25,930
They're like,
it's like doing small amounts of 

1412
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,651
mushrooms now to me.
Like sometimes I feel like I'm really 

1413
01:00:27,651 --> 01:00:27,750
tripping and there's.
That's crazy.

1414
01:00:27,751 --> 01:00:28,920
That's great.
Yeah.

1415
01:00:28,921 --> 01:00:29,520
Yeah.
The,

1416
01:00:29,521 --> 01:00:29,940
the,
the,

1417
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,160
the eating.
It is spooky man.

1418
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,140
And for people that don't know,
it creates something.

1419
01:00:34,141 --> 01:00:36,630
When you eat it called 11 hydroxy 
metabolite,

1420
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,330
that's four times stronger than thc.
So when you eat,

1421
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:42,000
it literally is a totally different drug
than when you smoke it.

1422
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:43,650
That's why people,
when they eat brownies,

1423
01:00:43,651 --> 01:00:45,630
they always think they got laced with 
something,

1424
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,550
you know,
so I can't do that.

1425
01:00:47,551 --> 01:00:50,070
So that's the answer to that question.
There's no way I could eat a Brownie,

1426
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:55,250
go onstage than an hour in the brown 
kicks in because then I would just want 

1427
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,210
to lie on my back on stage and start 
talking about the universe and you know,

1428
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:02,480
some people might be into it,
but there'd be a lot of people that 

1429
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:02,480
would leave and go,
that fucking show sucked.

1430
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,930
It was really funny for like an hour and
then he just started talking crazy.

1431
01:01:07,260 --> 01:01:11,040
He's lying on his back saying it's 
connected to everything and people would

1432
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:12,540
just not,
not enjoy it.

1433
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,040
Just take a social dose.
Well,

1434
01:01:14,041 --> 01:01:19,041
that's what we're talking about.
We can't figure out what a social dose 

1435
01:01:19,041 --> 01:01:22,791
is because you don't,
unless you're making the brownies 

1436
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:22,791
yourself and then even if you make the 
Brahmins yourself,

1437
01:01:22,791 --> 01:01:26,901
you could fuck up the first time.
You get it too strong and I don't have 

1438
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:27,570
that time to be mastering the right dose
of Brownie.

1439
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:29,340
Smoking is the way to go.

1440
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:30,890
Yeah.

1441
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:34,460
Well,
I loved you in Calgary to jen Ab.

1442
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,570
Calgary was the shit that was fun,
man.

1443
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,130
That was a good fucking time.
A stone universe tour.

1444
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:42,420
Yeah,
I should do that.

1445
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:43,590
You know,
it would really be cool.

1446
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:45,480
Eventually.
Right now we can't do it,

1447
01:01:45,481 --> 01:01:48,960
but eventually when I get to a point 
where we can do stone shows,

1448
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:54,260
you know,
like I could do a show like somewhere 

1449
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,070
like in Amsterdam they have those cafes 
where they allow you to smoke weed.

1450
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:59,460
If we had a,
a place like that in America.

1451
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,280
Hopefully in November.
Yeah.

1452
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,270
Hopefully in November,
but I don't buy it,

1453
01:02:03,271 --> 01:02:08,271
man.
I think you don't think that's going to 

1454
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:10,011
fucking put the Kibosh on that shit.
The problem with the drug movement is 

1455
01:02:10,051 --> 01:02:14,220
that making drugs illegal is good for 
business and making drugs.

1456
01:02:14,221 --> 01:02:17,910
Legal puts a lot of people out of work.
He puts the dea out of work.

1457
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:20,880
It puts private prisons of work.
It puts prison guards out of work.

1458
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:24,360
It puts parole officers and fucking 
police officers.

1459
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:29,570
Literally 50 percent of the people that 
are in prison are in prison for 

1460
01:02:29,570 --> 01:02:33,831
nonviolent drug offenses.
How many of those are weed and what 

1461
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:33,831
happens when we become illegal?
The,

1462
01:02:33,831 --> 01:02:35,460
Oh,
it's a fucking colossal mess.

1463
01:02:35,670 --> 01:02:40,410
So what they're doing by keeping it 
illegal is really protecting business.

1464
01:02:40,411 --> 01:02:45,411
And it sounds crazy.
It sounds like nobody will be doing 

1465
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:45,411
that.
There's no way the government staff fuck

1466
01:02:45,411 --> 01:02:45,720
up.
No,

1467
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,220
it really is.
It's not fucked up.

1468
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:51,060
That literally is what it is.
The reason why it's still illegal is all

1469
01:02:51,061 --> 01:02:53,310
because of money.
There's no one dying.

1470
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:58,340
There's no one getting cancer.
There's no one losing their fucking 

1471
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:58,340
mind.
There's no yet.

1472
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:02,451
It's still illegal when you can go to 
cvs and buy jugs of wine and cheap 

1473
01:03:02,451 --> 01:03:06,921
liquor and cartons of cigarettes and you
could smoke cigarettes and drink 

1474
01:03:06,921 --> 01:03:07,680
yourself to death.
Easy,

1475
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,260
easy.
You know,

1476
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:11,660
literally you can't die with pot.
I mean you can't.

1477
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:16,880
I mean,
I guess you could do something really 

1478
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:16,880
stupid when you're stoned and wind up 
killing yourself,

1479
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,511
but if you're that dumb,
he probably would've done something 

1480
01:03:20,511 --> 01:03:20,511
stupid anyway.
You know?

1481
01:03:20,511 --> 01:03:20,660
And when they say,
don't dye pot though,

1482
01:03:20,661 --> 01:03:25,661
you could totally die if you say start 
panicking because your stone and then 

1483
01:03:25,661 --> 01:03:27,260
your heart had a heart attack.
Die.

1484
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:28,540
I've never heard of that.
Have you?

1485
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,770
You would you.
So you don't think that ever happened?

1486
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:33,230
Somebody got sue stone started freaking 
out.

1487
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:36,740
Then there are heart fails or something.
I've never heard of it.

1488
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,980
Have you heard of it?
Because they can't be saying that.

1489
01:03:39,981 --> 01:03:40,930
The weed is like,

1490
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:41,800
let's look,
let's,

1491
01:03:41,801 --> 01:03:43,380
let's Google this.
If you're a week ass

1492
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:46,200
bitch,
weak as weak ass.

1493
01:03:46,210 --> 01:03:48,140
I'm going to google weekends.
Attack.

1494
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:49,540
Yeah.
Heart attack.

1495
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:49,710
You.

1496
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:57,300
Let's see.
Can Marijuana caused harm tech?

1497
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,920
Yahoo answers.
Let's see.

1498
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,350
Marijuana said the trigger heart 
attacks.

1499
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:04,780
Okay.
This is just wiki answers.

1500
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:07,360
Wiki answers a stupid because people 
like answer.

1501
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:11,740
That's how I thought that that whales,
the killer whales used to kill people.

1502
01:04:11,741 --> 01:04:16,741
I read this online a couple of different
places to killer whales used to kill 

1503
01:04:16,741 --> 01:04:21,031
people until World War II and then 
people were using the whales as target 

1504
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:21,031
practice.
I've read this online and I talked about

1505
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:25,771
on the Adam Carolla show.
And even though I said I don't know if 

1506
01:04:25,771 --> 01:04:28,471
it's true,
I read it online that after World War 

1507
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:28,471
Two,
after the bombers,

1508
01:04:28,471 --> 01:04:29,980
killer whales stop killing human beings 
and actually started saving,

1509
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,720
which would be really fascinating.
Hold on a second.

1510
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:35,050
But it was true.
It was just fucking wicky answers,

1511
01:04:35,051 --> 01:04:37,090
man.
Some crazy whaling guy on wiki answers.

1512
01:04:37,091 --> 01:04:39,610
And I had to like chase it down on my 
website.

1513
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,070
Marijuana said the trigger heart 
attacks,

1514
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,720
Harvard,
Harvard,

1515
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,690
five times the amount of having a heart 
attack

1516
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:53,730
in the first hour after smoking pot,
a person's risk of heart attack could 

1517
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:54,970
rise almost five times.
God Damn.

1518
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,800
That's if you're a weak ass bitch

1519
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:00,820
or if you're just one step away from 
having a heart attack because they eat a

1520
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:01,660
lot of meat,
you know,

1521
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:06,670
or something like that.
And careful we guess bitches don't want 

1522
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:08,430
to write this.
Be careful where you use.

1523
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:11,180
That's why we didn't say that 
marijuana's are killed when.

1524
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,570
True it didn't.
It didn't.

1525
01:05:13,571 --> 01:05:15,340
Employees and anybody,
it didn't,

1526
01:05:15,341 --> 01:05:18,040
you know.
But if you have other problems and

1527
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:23,040
he smoked weed or absolutely you can.
Same thing could happen if you lik 

1528
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:23,070
shoes.
And you get him out,

1529
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:26,090
there might be something allergic on a 
shoe that,

1530
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:30,670
that could trigger off a sinus infection
that will make you die.

1531
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,110
I really don't know where you're going 
with this.

1532
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:32,650
I have no idea.

1533
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,940
Okay.
So I just told her that careful weak ass

1534
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:40,860
bitches,
marijuana can give you a heart attack if

1535
01:05:40,861 --> 01:05:42,780
your ticker socks and you can read the 
story.

1536
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:43,990
Um,
yeah.

1537
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:48,420
I mean if you really got to get a heart 
attack from weed because you're freaking

1538
01:05:48,421 --> 01:05:53,421
out.
I definitely think that there's another 

1539
01:05:53,421 --> 01:05:56,031
problem though.
The real problem is that you're in 

1540
01:05:56,031 --> 01:05:56,031
terrible shape and you need to take care
of your body.

1541
01:05:56,031 --> 01:05:56,280
That's the problem.
It's not pot.

1542
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:01,550
You know,
it's like the way I've always described 

1543
01:06:01,550 --> 01:06:02,090
pot not being able to help dumb people 
is that you can't,

1544
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:05,190
you put jet fuel,
jet fuel and a fucking lawnmower.

1545
01:06:05,191 --> 01:06:06,670
It's still a lawnmower.
You know,

1546
01:06:06,890 --> 01:06:11,890
you know,
you put jet fuel in a jet and it's 

1547
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:11,890
pretty bad ass.
But the bottom line is,

1548
01:06:11,890 --> 01:06:16,371
you know,
it's all about what kind of hardware 

1549
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:16,371
you're dealing with.
And some people just have wheat brains.

1550
01:06:16,371 --> 01:06:17,790
Their brains just suck.
I mean,

1551
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:20,310
have you ever met people and you look in
their eye and you're talking to them and

1552
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:20,970
you're like,
wow,

1553
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:23,510
like there's no hope for this dude.
This dude's just doll.

1554
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,810
Like I'm looking in his eyes.
I'm not making any connection.

1555
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:28,290
And just like talking to a dog,
he's like a fucking idiot.

1556
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:31,530
There are people and people don't want 
admit this for whatever reason,

1557
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,480
because there are people that aren't 
dumb.

1558
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:36,510
They're just troubled and their lives 
have fallen apart because they,

1559
01:06:36,511 --> 01:06:37,080
you know,
they,

1560
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:39,160
they've got all sorts of issues and you 
know,

1561
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:39,750
people go,
oh,

1562
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:41,640
that guy's a retard,
but he's not really retired.

1563
01:06:41,641 --> 01:06:42,510
You know,
he's kind of smart.

1564
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,650
There are people like that that are just
troubled and fucked up and you know,

1565
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:48,730
perhaps they never figured out what it 
is in this life that they're good for us

1566
01:06:48,731 --> 01:06:49,380
should be doing.

1567
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:54,620
But there's definitely people with cas,
nine volt brains that are just supposed 

1568
01:06:54,661 --> 01:06:58,500
to be out there digging ditches and to 
deny that it's just unscientific.

1569
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:00,930
If you look at the entire fucking 
universe,

1570
01:07:00,931 --> 01:07:05,931
man,
it's all about things improving and 

1571
01:07:05,931 --> 01:07:05,931
getting better.
And if you look at human beings,

1572
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,180
there's all sorts of things,
there's all sorts of programs and things

1573
01:07:09,181 --> 01:07:12,150
set up to make sure that the week can 
still survive.

1574
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:14,460
They don't drop off.
And when that happens,

1575
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:19,461
you're going to create a bunch of dumb 
people and having those dumb people 

1576
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:19,461
around.
Look,

1577
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:20,460
they all fit their purpose.
They're all here for a reason.

1578
01:07:20,461 --> 01:07:22,410
But if you're going to have a fucking 
Nikolai Tesla,

1579
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,330
if you're going to have,
uh,

1580
01:07:23,331 --> 01:07:28,331
an Einstein for sure,
you're going to have dick ditch diggers 

1581
01:07:28,331 --> 01:07:28,840
dudes who are here to ditch Dick's,
Dick's,

1582
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:29,670
Dick's,

1583
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:32,670
you'll have ditches you have.
It's probably,

1584
01:07:32,671 --> 01:07:37,671
they'd set the retard are so low in like
the 19 hundreds that they just haven't 

1585
01:07:37,981 --> 01:07:39,060
raised it yet.
You know,

1586
01:07:39,061 --> 01:07:41,580
there should be maybe a test or two that
we have,

1587
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:44,700
we haven't been doing that makes people 
that are considered dumb.

1588
01:07:44,701 --> 01:07:45,870
They're just retarded.
You know,

1589
01:07:45,871 --> 01:07:46,500
like,
like,

1590
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:47,850
like,
you know what I'm talking about?

1591
01:07:47,851 --> 01:07:50,220
Like this person is so dumb.
They are retarded.

1592
01:07:50,221 --> 01:07:52,710
But you know that their loved one's 
passed away for

1593
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,320
want to say that because we want to say,
Oh,

1594
01:07:54,321 --> 01:07:56,110
you know,
you give people a chance and you know,

1595
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,010
everyone's got a chance.
I think there are.

1596
01:07:58,011 --> 01:08:00,710
There are certain people where it's very
much cultural.

1597
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,010
It's very much they're,
they're,

1598
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:07,200
they're just,
they're raised in an environment where 

1599
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,971
no one's questioning anything there.
Their role models are all dunces that 

1600
01:08:09,971 --> 01:08:11,690
grew up in a family of people who scream
and yell at each other for no reason.

1601
01:08:11,691 --> 01:08:13,730
And they just,
they live in this stupid world.

1602
01:08:13,731 --> 01:08:18,731
And so they,
they imitate their and they become 

1603
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:18,731
stupid themselves.
There's,

1604
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:18,731
there's people like that.
So it's,

1605
01:08:18,731 --> 01:08:23,620
it's not an exact science,
but the problem is there's a lot of 

1606
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:23,620
really fucking dumb people,
man.

1607
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:25,900
When you see those videos of those 
people that go to those Sarah Pailin,

1608
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:30,940
book signings,
those teabag or people and they're all 

1609
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:30,940
up in arms against the government.

1610
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:34,100
There are some wooden minds and there 
just some doll motherfuckers,

1611
01:08:34,370 --> 01:08:35,000
you know,
that's,

1612
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:40,001
that's,
that's really a problem that everybody 

1613
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:40,001
has to have a say.
Like,

1614
01:08:40,001 --> 01:08:44,381
how do you fix that?
How do you fix what we got going on as 

1615
01:08:44,381 --> 01:08:45,980
far as like the idea of a democracy,
the idea of,

1616
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:50,120
you know,
half the people you know or more have to

1617
01:08:50,121 --> 01:08:54,230
agree or have to have to.
I mean the idea of a real democracy.

1618
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:59,231
If,
if more than 50 percent of people 

1619
01:08:59,231 --> 01:08:59,231
retarded,
which I think they are,

1620
01:08:59,231 --> 01:08:59,231
I would say more than 50,
more than 50 percent.

1621
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:02,840
How the fuck do you move forward?
How the fuck do you.

1622
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,840
The only way to do it is to make those 
people smarter,

1623
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,160
is to figure out a way to educate those 
people to,

1624
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:12,410
to raise the number of dom raised the 
number of uninterested,

1625
01:09:12,411 --> 01:09:14,920
uninvolved or 50 percent or retarded.
Like,

1626
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:18,620
like they have bad brains or just 
education environment.

1627
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:19,180
Well,
you know,

1628
01:09:19,190 --> 01:09:20,540
you know,
I have,

1629
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:25,690
I know people that are great people,
but for whatever reason they just don't 

1630
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:29,660
think the same way that other people,
my other friends do,

1631
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:30,590
you know,
like they don't,

1632
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:33,370
they're not thinking about like,
uh,

1633
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:36,170
putting your seatbelt on because they 
don't want to get in a car accident.

1634
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:38,180
Just get in the car and just drive.
You know.

1635
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:39,680
Right,
like there's,

1636
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,340
they just don't have as like a part of 
their brain is not working.

1637
01:09:43,650 --> 01:09:44,350
Like,
like,

1638
01:09:44,351 --> 01:09:45,340
uh,
the deep,

1639
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:47,850
like just thinking outside the box 
thing,

1640
01:09:47,890 --> 01:09:49,400
if you think that's how they were 
raised,

1641
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:50,970
is it nature or nurture?
I think it's,

1642
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:56,000
I think it's just,
they're not using the same parts of 

1643
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,000
brains,
their brain,

1644
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:56,480
you know,
it's almost like,

1645
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,940
I just don't think that they have that 
in him,

1646
01:09:59,270 --> 01:10:00,410
you know?
I don't know.

1647
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:01,300
I,
I really,

1648
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:05,130
I wonder how much of that is due to a 
environment,

1649
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:07,560
like how much of it is due to pollution,
you know,

1650
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:12,590
how much of it is due to what your 
mother was eating and doing while she 

1651
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:13,170
was watching is probably totally that.
Totally.

1652
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:15,300
That,
that has to have a big effect.

1653
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:15,810
You know?

1654
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,630
I mean if you go on Youtube and search 
me smoking cigarettes,

1655
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:24,750
you'll see some just guy in West 
Virginia just sit near smoking a 

1656
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,450
cigarette and you can tell just by 
looking at him,

1657
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:26,770
he's retarded,
but yeah,

1658
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:28,450
he is probably not considered retarded.

1659
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:30,060
No.
Any can vote.

1660
01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:31,090
Yeah.
Anticonvulsant.

1661
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:32,910
Yeah.
Like I had a conversation.

1662
01:10:32,911 --> 01:10:36,240
I've been having all these conversations
about religion on the Robin Board lately

1663
01:10:36,241 --> 01:10:37,980
because all this Catholic scandal that's
going on,

1664
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:43,140
and I don't know if you know the latest,
but they've proven that the pope knew 

1665
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:45,690
about pedophiles and hid the cases that 
went before he was the pope,

1666
01:10:45,691 --> 01:10:50,691
that he knew about these pedophile cases
and he did everything that he could to 

1667
01:10:50,691 --> 01:10:51,900
shield the information and protect the.
The priests.

1668
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:53,070
That's like,
man,

1669
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:58,100
how could you not think that the 
Catholic religion as a cult at that 

1670
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,100
point,
at that point,

1671
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,610
it's a cult,
right?

1672
01:10:58,650 --> 01:11:03,650
Yeah.
I mean it's a cold period definition 

1673
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:03,650
wise,
but at that point in time you're like,

1674
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:04,840
how could this possibly be good?
You know,

1675
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:07,350
if at the very top this kind of shit is 
going on,

1676
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:10,620
how do people get tricked into that?
How,

1677
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:12,360
how was that possible?
You know,

1678
01:11:12,380 --> 01:11:13,920
how,
how are people so silly

1679
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:17,130
that in 2010 this is still considered a 
possibility?

1680
01:11:17,131 --> 01:11:20,100
Like maybe they're right,
maybe these kid fuckers are on the ball.

1681
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:21,660
Maybe they're the ones that we need to 
follow.

1682
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:25,260
You know,
maybe this crazy organization in Italy,

1683
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:30,000
maybe they're the masters of all the 
knowledge like that's,

1684
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,440
that's.
Is that nature,

1685
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:32,520
is that nurture?
What does that.

1686
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:33,790
It's both.
I don't know.

1687
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:34,670
No,
I think it's.

1688
01:11:34,671 --> 01:11:39,671
I think it's the same thing that when 
you talk to certain people they don't 

1689
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:39,671
get technology like they,
they,

1690
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:41,660
they're not informed as much as other 
people.

1691
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:46,040
Is that nature is that nurture?
I mean how could people see to me and to

1692
01:11:46,041 --> 01:11:49,580
you when we look at gadgets and new 
things like you know what both,

1693
01:11:49,581 --> 01:11:52,070
like Brian,
we'll find some new thing online,

1694
01:11:52,071 --> 01:11:57,071
like Holy Shit,
look at this and they'll send it to me 

1695
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:57,071
or I'll send something to him,
you know,

1696
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:57,071
and you look at it,
you're like,

1697
01:11:57,071 --> 01:11:57,470
oh,
what are they doing?

1698
01:11:57,471 --> 01:12:00,470
Look what they're doing with that.
This multitouch fucking interface.

1699
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:02,780
Like a minority report type shit or 
anything,

1700
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:06,560
anything new thing.
That stuff becomes fascinating man.

1701
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:07,590
I think though the

1702
01:12:07,820 --> 01:12:12,820
later,
the more we kind of kill off a certain 

1703
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:16,000
age group of people that didn't grow.
I think the more people are going to 

1704
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,240
research for themselves,
religion and stuff like that.

1705
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:22,241
I think religion is probably their 
future and the religion is probably 

1706
01:12:22,241 --> 01:12:23,510
going to be a lot different in say the 
next hundred years.

1707
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:25,180
Yeah,
ever been ever.

1708
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:30,240
I think it's probably more people have 
realized how ridiculous it is now than 

1709
01:12:31,061 --> 01:12:32,210
ever before.
You know,

1710
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:37,230
I don't think there's ever been more 
questioners and there's probably never 

1711
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:37,410
been more options either.
You know,

1712
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:42,500
with scientology and the moonies and 
anything else and new ones that are 

1713
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:46,441
popping up left and right.
There's all these new ideologies that 

1714
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:46,441
are,
that are popping up left and right.

1715
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:48,490
People are offering like new 
alternatives,

1716
01:12:48,491 --> 01:12:52,210
you know,
and it can't last.

1717
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:53,920
It's just,
it's going to be too much.

1718
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:57,820
There's gonna come a point in time where
we know the truth.

1719
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,000
We know it's not going to be something 
that we have to like wonder and make a 

1720
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:03,310
judgment call on.
It's going to be like,

1721
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:04,750
oh,
I know you're full of shit.

1722
01:13:04,870 --> 01:13:06,010
Oh,
I know you're lying.

1723
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,610
Oh,
I know.

1724
01:13:06,611 --> 01:13:08,470
The information you're giving me is not 
truthful.

1725
01:13:08,471 --> 01:13:10,180
I can read this and I can understand 
this.

1726
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:13,960
We have an intuitive sense of what's 
wrong and what's right.

1727
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,350
We also have an intuitive sense of when 
people are lying,

1728
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:22,680
you know,
when someone is not being honest with 

1729
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:22,680
you or,
or when you ever been talking to someone

1730
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,791
that you know,
that they're secretly hoping that 

1731
01:13:26,791 --> 01:13:26,920
something goes wrong with you.
Like there's some secret hate,

1732
01:13:27,210 --> 01:13:28,670
you know,
you ever been talking to someone

1733
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:29,930
well on the Internet everyday.

1734
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:33,480
Yeah.
But you know,

1735
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:35,910
you know that feeling where somebody 
really is like,

1736
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,670
they're being douchey to you.
Like there's something there and it's,

1737
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:42,190
you can't describe it,
but you get a feeling from them.

1738
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:47,460
You know,
there's instinctual feelings that we 

1739
01:13:47,460 --> 01:13:47,460
have and deception is a big one.
Man.

1740
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,500
That's a big one.
When someone's being deceptive and 

1741
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,340
someone's lying to you or does that not 
drive you fucking bananas?

1742
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,810
Doesn't that drive you crazy?

1743
01:13:55,970 --> 01:13:57,710
Well,
yeah.

1744
01:13:57,711 --> 01:14:02,711
I mean,
but you have to also think that the 

1745
01:14:02,711 --> 01:14:03,530
person,
the reason why this person's acting like

1746
01:14:03,531 --> 01:14:08,531
this or something like that,
it's because it's something that they 

1747
01:14:08,531 --> 01:14:10,721
don't like that you've done to them.
Or is that something that you do or you 

1748
01:14:10,721 --> 01:14:10,930
know,
so then you have to eight.

1749
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:14,300
But that's not always the case.
Sometimes throwing shortcomings,

1750
01:14:14,301 --> 01:14:16,460
it's causing them to be a cure.
I mean,

1751
01:14:16,461 --> 01:14:21,461
you know,
I mean we're talking about earlier this 

1752
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:21,461
girl that's upset of this other girl,
you know,

1753
01:14:21,461 --> 01:14:22,100
I mean think about that.
I mean,

1754
01:14:22,101 --> 01:14:23,480
what does that,
where is that coming from?

1755
01:14:23,481 --> 01:14:25,270
That's not.
And no one did anything wrong there.

1756
01:14:25,470 --> 01:14:30,470
You know,
it's like sometimes it's their own 

1757
01:14:30,470 --> 01:14:30,470
shortcomings is people choosing you over
another person,

1758
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:33,380
someone seeing something that someone 
else has and saying,

1759
01:14:33,381 --> 01:14:35,450
well that should be me.
How can this guy successful?

1760
01:14:35,451 --> 01:14:37,670
How come this girl is so happy and I'm 
not.

1761
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:40,210
They get angry.
I mean there's,

1762
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:43,190
there's a lot of shit to human beings 
that's not logical,

1763
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:44,230
you know,
and,

1764
01:14:44,330 --> 01:14:47,270
but we can feel that when you're talking
to someone and you.

1765
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,160
I mean,
how many times you talked to a dude,

1766
01:14:49,161 --> 01:14:54,161
I've,
I've talked to a bunch of dudes where I 

1767
01:14:54,161 --> 01:14:55,631
know there's some,
some weird jealousy hate thing when I'm 

1768
01:14:55,631 --> 01:14:56,270
talking to them and I tried to be as 
nice as friendly as possible and like,

1769
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:58,040
listen man,
we're just meeting for the first time,

1770
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:59,060
but I don't really know.

1771
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,050
Okay.
You don't,

1772
01:15:00,051 --> 01:15:02,050
don't make this a personal issue,
you know,

1773
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,410
you think you have this,
this,

1774
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:08,580
this rivalry with me because you know,
you see me on television and you don't 

1775
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:08,990
like the fact that I'm doing something 
that you want to do,

1776
01:15:08,991 --> 01:15:10,220
but I'm just a dude.
You know,

1777
01:15:10,221 --> 01:15:11,150
you're a dude.
I'm a dude.

1778
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,480
And the reality is I'm not taking your 
job.

1779
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:19,510
Okay?
The reality is I got this job and the 

1780
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:19,510
other reality is you can get something 
like it.

1781
01:15:19,510 --> 01:15:19,700
Do,
you know,

1782
01:15:19,701 --> 01:15:23,120
you can become exactly like me except 
your own version of it.

1783
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:23,990
You know,
you can.

1784
01:15:23,991 --> 01:15:26,810
Anybody can do it.
Anybody can be successful in any,

1785
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:32,080
any area that they pursue.
You just have to figure out your way 

1786
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:32,390
through the fucking path.
It is possible,

1787
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:33,470
you know,
I mean,

1788
01:15:33,471 --> 01:15:38,471
look,
muggsy bogues was a fucking basketball 

1789
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:38,471
player who is five foot six,
you know,

1790
01:15:38,471 --> 01:15:39,530
I mean,
anything's possible.

1791
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:40,330
You know,
there's,

1792
01:15:40,340 --> 01:15:44,300
there's,
there's just has to be your own path.

1793
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:46,850
You know,
and I think human beings especially have

1794
01:15:46,851 --> 01:15:50,810
a real problem being jealous of other 
people and being upset at other people.

1795
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:55,960
But you can what?
One of my point is that you could feel 

1796
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,001
that when someone does that to you and 
we're going to be able to tell when 

1797
01:15:58,001 --> 01:16:00,671
people are lying,
we're going to eventually going to be 

1798
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:00,671
able to tell.
That's for sure.

1799
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:04,731
More like something that we're evolving 
in us with language and with 

1800
01:16:04,761 --> 01:16:08,180
consciousness.
We're figuring out deceptive behavior.

1801
01:16:08,181 --> 01:16:13,181
We're figuring it out because we 
understand that we recognize it in 

1802
01:16:13,181 --> 01:16:15,470
yourself and the more truthful you are,
the more easy it is to pick out laws and

1803
01:16:15,471 --> 01:16:16,400
other people.
Yeah,

1804
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:21,590
and just so much information to.
They were just like twitter alone is 

1805
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:25,511
probably killed a million relationships 
and a million rumors too and then I 

1806
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:30,780
can't do anything nowadays.
Like imagine being married and imagine 

1807
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:34,091
going to a bar and then you'd meet as 
girl and you start talking to her and 

1808
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:34,910
somebody goes,
Oh hey,

1809
01:16:34,911 --> 01:16:38,090
there's that person takes a photo of you
puts it on their twitter.

1810
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:43,070
Now you are just being caught in front 
of 5 million people.

1811
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:44,630
You know,
you can't.

1812
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:49,810
You pretty much have.
We going to have to all have to start 

1813
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:49,810
wearing disguises like fake mustaches 
and stuff.

1814
01:16:49,810 --> 01:16:52,030
And I know it's going to be,
it's going to be like that

1815
01:16:52,090 --> 01:16:54,520
fucking movie with Tom Cruise.
What was that?

1816
01:16:54,521 --> 01:16:55,330
Crazy.
But we want to.

1817
01:16:55,331 --> 01:16:58,670
Stanley Kubrick's last movies wore masks
on.

1818
01:16:58,671 --> 01:16:59,620
They.
They Bang each other.

1819
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:01,230
Oh yeah.
With a.

1820
01:17:01,231 --> 01:17:01,340
What the

1821
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:03,830
fuck was that with Nicole Kidman?
Nicole kid.

1822
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:08,210
What the hell was that moving?
Somebody knows Stanley Kubrick.

1823
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:10,750
Was that shit?

1824
01:17:10,890 --> 01:17:15,890
Some fucking come up with it.
I'm just going to sit here until 

1825
01:17:15,890 --> 01:17:17,240
somebody comes up with this chick says,
don't cheat.

1826
01:17:17,241 --> 01:17:19,900
Then.
How hilarious are you Jenna?

1827
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,760
BBB?
No.

1828
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,720
Nobody knows the answer.
This fucking movie.

1829
01:17:23,721 --> 01:17:25,310
What is this God damned movie?
Eyes Wide Shut.

1830
01:17:25,311 --> 01:17:27,290
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1831
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:28,580
Yeah,
yeah,

1832
01:17:28,581 --> 01:17:31,100
of course you shouldn't cheat.
But the problem is dudes want to.

1833
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:32,150
And we're programming

1834
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:34,550
what does not even cheating.
Like you could have just met this person

1835
01:17:34,551 --> 01:17:37,730
at a bar set high and just started 
talking.

1836
01:17:37,790 --> 01:17:39,040
But you know,
Mr.

1837
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:42,530
camera phone behind you took a picture 
of you and now you're fucking,

1838
01:17:42,531 --> 01:17:44,430
you know,
it doesn't like shit's all crazy.

1839
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:45,570
You can't do any short.

1840
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:47,070
But.
But the reality is,

1841
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:50,040
the reason why it's an issue at all is 
that human beings,

1842
01:17:50,041 --> 01:17:55,041
especially men,
are wired to try to populate an entire 

1843
01:17:55,041 --> 01:17:55,140
village because that's how the best 
sperm survives.

1844
01:17:55,500 --> 01:18:00,500
And you know,
that's why all these crazy conquer 

1845
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:00,500
motherfuckers like tiger woods,
you know,

1846
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,640
these guys that are so uber competitive.
That's why I had so many checks,

1847
01:18:02,641 --> 01:18:04,950
you know,
it was like guys just doing nature.

1848
01:18:04,951 --> 01:18:07,890
He spread his seed.
If this was 2000 years ago,

1849
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:10,950
that would be totally normal.
But it's like an offshoot,

1850
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:14,310
you know,
it's an offshoot of a,

1851
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:16,740
you know,
a fucking warrior instincts,

1852
01:18:16,741 --> 01:18:21,741
you know,
he's out there conquering and then he's 

1853
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:21,741
conquering.
No,

1854
01:18:21,741 --> 01:18:23,640
he's doing what he's supposed to do.
He's like driving forward.

1855
01:18:25,350 --> 01:18:28,290
Women are wired to grab a man and keep 
him for protection.

1856
01:18:28,291 --> 01:18:29,310
Yeah,
that's true too.

1857
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:33,300
That's definitely true.
Sex addiction is total bullshit.

1858
01:18:33,570 --> 01:18:35,120
Is it you sex addicted

1859
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:40,190
mother would have to disagree because I 
know some people that are totally 

1860
01:18:40,190 --> 01:18:40,190
addicted to sex and a different level 
than I am.

1861
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:42,700
You don't know.
You never met some friends of mine.

1862
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:45,070
Do you ever talk about the Saran wrap or
the

1863
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:46,890
lotion?
No,

1864
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:51,980
you said talking about front who uh,
you should do a thing called shooting 

1865
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:54,840
and what he would do is he would get 
these running pants,

1866
01:18:54,990 --> 01:18:58,170
like those on those really thin,
sort of like,

1867
01:18:58,790 --> 01:19:02,580
it's almost like a nylon nylon,
really silky running pants.

1868
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:07,730
And he would literally rub the crotch 
with a fine grit sandpaper and,

1869
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:14,000
and then he would a baby oil,
his balls and his shit is junk and baby 

1870
01:19:15,511 --> 01:19:16,260
oil,
everything.

1871
01:19:16,261 --> 01:19:21,261
So it's all nice and slippery.
So he takes this super thin running 

1872
01:19:21,421 --> 01:19:24,000
pants and he puts them on over his baby 
oiled shit.

1873
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:29,090
And then would go get lap dances and 
they were just shooting this past 

1874
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:30,350
[inaudible] girl would be hot and she'd 
be riding on.

1875
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:32,670
It's difficult hard.
It was literally like sex,

1876
01:19:32,671 --> 01:19:35,340
like a.
and he had,

1877
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:40,430
he was like obsessed with his work.
He has his own company and so he would 

1878
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,600
work like these long hours and you know,
and you know,

1879
01:19:41,670 --> 01:19:42,800
he was really successful.

1880
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:46,290
Millionaire had the whole thing.
No big fucking house in the hills.

1881
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:51,320
They,
he had the whole package and he worked 

1882
01:19:51,320 --> 01:19:54,170
all day.
He was so he had no time for 

1883
01:19:54,170 --> 01:19:56,601
relationships and he like had some bad 
experiences with women so he thought 

1884
01:19:56,601 --> 01:19:58,860
women were just trying to rip him off 
and this chip that he was dating,

1885
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:03,861
she,
she wound up cheating on him and he 

1886
01:20:03,861 --> 01:20:05,571
like,
he got his heart crush so he just 

1887
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:05,571
decided to just go shooting and this 
would be his day.

1888
01:20:05,571 --> 01:20:05,910
He would,
uh,

1889
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:07,500
go to work,
work day.

1890
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:11,350
Then he would get something to eat and 
then he would go shooting or he would go

1891
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:16,351
shooting on the way home and then he 
would get something to eat and then go 

1892
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:16,351
to bed,
do it all over again.

1893
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:20,021
And that was his.
All of his relationships were lap 

1894
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:20,021
dances.
He would just go,

1895
01:20:20,021 --> 01:20:20,470
we got caught eventually.

1896
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:25,470
Did any or he fucked up once and he went
and he put too much baby oil or I think 

1897
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:27,790
he used lube and literally his pants 
were soaked.

1898
01:20:28,060 --> 01:20:29,580
And so the girl,
the girl sat,

1899
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:31,020
I'm sure like,
what the fuck would she like?

1900
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:32,230
She's like,
pissed himself,

1901
01:20:32,231 --> 01:20:33,250
just like,
what are you doing?

1902
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,300
What's wrong with you?
It's like,

1903
01:20:34,430 --> 01:20:37,030
I'm sorry,
he said I was so embarrassed and he left

1904
01:20:37,031 --> 01:20:41,770
and he leaves with this puddle and his 
pants of baby oil and move and it's like

1905
01:20:41,771 --> 01:20:46,771
dripping into his socks and shit.
That's a Dixon Dixon mean.

1906
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,770
I think it's kind of like,
because he's into massages.

1907
01:20:50,771 --> 01:20:54,070
He was into like big rewarded for his 
hard work.

1908
01:20:54,220 --> 01:20:59,220
He was into like fine food and massages 
and if prostitution was legal he would 

1909
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:00,240
just hire a hooker.
So like if there's like a,

1910
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:02,650
if it was like an acceptable normal 
thing to do,

1911
01:21:02,651 --> 01:21:04,600
like you've lived in some foreign 
country,

1912
01:21:04,660 --> 01:21:05,150
you know,
they were,

1913
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:06,250
they allow prostitution.

1914
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:08,950
He would just go to the prostitutes and 
get serviced and then go home.

1915
01:21:09,370 --> 01:21:10,810
You know there's a fucking,
you know,

1916
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:16,320
I don't,
I don't understand how people have 

1917
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,530
allowed that to be illegal.
How do you stop that?

1918
01:21:17,860 --> 01:21:20,160
Why do you stop that?
Stop people.

1919
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:24,070
Health reasons I think you don't want 
fucking aids going ramp.

1920
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:29,120
It hurt everyone.
Having herpes really though is that 

1921
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:29,260
either.
But if you go to brothels,

1922
01:21:29,261 --> 01:21:31,570
they have to check those girls.
They test those girls.

1923
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,210
If you go to a brothel in a country 
that's respectable,

1924
01:21:34,211 --> 01:21:36,970
supposedly they're testing those girls 
just like they test porn stars,

1925
01:21:37,330 --> 01:21:42,330
you know,
I don't think it's a good argument 

1926
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:42,330
because I think that if you're paying 
attention more,

1927
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:43,720
it's a lot safer than if,
you know,

1928
01:21:43,721 --> 01:21:46,300
if it's some fucking underground thing 
where these,

1929
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:51,340
you know,
it's probably a lot of violence that 

1930
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:51,340
comes with it too though,
you know,

1931
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:52,010
people going a little bit too far and 
raping the person falling.

1932
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,510
But if wouldn't it be safer if they did 
it in a brothel where their security and

1933
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:58,290
when people get screened and they know 
someone's not crazy,

1934
01:21:58,690 --> 01:21:59,770
purity,
they're everywhere.

1935
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:05,070
I mean,
that makes much more sense to me than 

1936
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:05,710
some poor girl has to put a fucking add 
in some magazine and then show up.

1937
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,330
Normally that girl that came to the 
comedy store,

1938
01:22:07,331 --> 01:22:08,170
one night,
we'll talk to her,

1939
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:11,680
she said she was a hooker and she would 
respond to ads and she would,

1940
01:22:11,681 --> 01:22:13,060
uh,
she would only go to them,

1941
01:22:13,061 --> 01:22:18,061
right?
She wouldn't let them come to her as I 

1942
01:22:18,061 --> 01:22:19,411
would have worked.
She would go to them so that she had an 

1943
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:19,411
address,
you know,

1944
01:22:19,411 --> 01:22:19,420
and she would tell her friend,
hey,

1945
01:22:19,421 --> 01:22:21,080
this is where I went,
so if anything happens to me,

1946
01:22:21,081 --> 01:22:22,540
I don't come back,
you know,

1947
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:23,690
somebody killed me,
you know,

1948
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,340
and she would,
you know,

1949
01:22:25,420 --> 01:22:28,000
she would go to these places,
peoples places and she would fuck it was

1950
01:22:28,001 --> 01:22:29,080
like,
it was crazy.

1951
01:22:29,110 --> 01:22:31,120
She like super awesome about it.
You remember that Shit.

1952
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:32,850
What was it?
She was meth.

1953
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,490
She was a method,
wasn't that,

1954
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,150
but she told us,
told us what you did.

1955
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:39,500
Yeah,
I think she said she did the mess,

1956
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:41,290
you know,
and then you could,

1957
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:45,520
if you had like a real brothel,
I think there'll be a lot less crime.

1958
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:48,910
There will be certainly way less rapes 
if you just get laid,

1959
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:54,200
you know,
and people would settle down and you 

1960
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:54,200
know,
it's like the,

1961
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:56,500
this when you really did fall in love 
and you're really with a woman,

1962
01:22:56,501 --> 01:23:00,010
like there wouldn't be this,
like this overwhelming desire to be with

1963
01:23:00,011 --> 01:23:05,011
someone just to have sex because you 
could always have sex so you could just 

1964
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:05,011
pay for it if you want to.
But you know,

1965
01:23:05,011 --> 01:23:09,090
being in a relationship would,
a relationship where you really enjoyed 

1966
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:10,030
being with that person,
you know,

1967
01:23:10,100 --> 01:23:15,100
they wouldn't like,
especially if you live in a place where 

1968
01:23:15,100 --> 01:23:16,891
it's hard to get laid,
I'll give you live in Boston or 

1969
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:16,891
something like that.
It's hard to get laid in.

1970
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:18,100
Boston is.
It's not easy,

1971
01:23:18,101 --> 01:23:18,850
man.
Those gusts.

1972
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:20,530
What do you want to use?
Me?

1973
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:22,750
You just don't want to use me to get the
car.

1974
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:23,770
You drive home.

1975
01:23:24,050 --> 01:23:27,080
Oh,
I didn't even know women were the nights

1976
01:23:27,081 --> 01:23:28,430
until I moved to California.
Man,

1977
01:23:28,431 --> 01:23:29,240
I had no idea.

1978
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,610
No,
that's funny.

1979
01:23:31,611 --> 01:23:33,080
It's true.
Totally true.

1980
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:36,290
That's angry people.
So God damn cold.

1981
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:37,340
It's cold.

1982
01:23:37,870 --> 01:23:40,250
It's just a God damn disaster.
You know?

1983
01:23:40,251 --> 01:23:42,470
There's a lot of,
a lot of tension,

1984
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:43,880
you know,
and a lot of people,

1985
01:23:43,881 --> 01:23:45,440
they're all go get them to,
you know,

1986
01:23:45,441 --> 01:23:47,420
they moved their,
they're immigrants.

1987
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:52,690
You know,
the grandparents were immigrants and 

1988
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:52,690
they moved there from another country 
that's not some serious.

1989
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:53,540
Go get them shit.
Take all your stuff,

1990
01:23:53,541 --> 01:23:55,490
pack it,
get in a boat,

1991
01:23:55,730 --> 01:24:00,730
sail across the fucking world,
and starting some new place and learn 

1992
01:24:00,730 --> 01:24:05,381
the language and learn how to it.
That's how go get these people were.

1993
01:24:05,570 --> 01:24:07,910
So the people that initially came to 
this country on the east coast,

1994
01:24:08,030 --> 01:24:10,940
those are all savages.
And the people that went west or all the

1995
01:24:10,941 --> 01:24:13,580
people that want to get away from 
establishes all the people were like,

1996
01:24:13,581 --> 01:24:15,860
these fucking people are crazy.
Get Me Outta here.

1997
01:24:15,861 --> 01:24:19,640
And they all took off and the furthest 
they could get was here.

1998
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:24,760
That's why people in California are like
the most laid back in the most 

1999
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:24,760
progressive.
I mean,

2000
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:29,141
it literally is because they're the ones
that are the ancestors of the ones that 

2001
01:24:29,141 --> 01:24:29,141
wanted to get the fuck away from where 
they were,

2002
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:30,300
you know.

2003
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:35,400
So let's go try the thin running pants 
next time you're in Houston.

2004
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,950
Um,
I don't think so,

2005
01:24:37,951 --> 01:24:42,951
man.
I think you'd probably still get 

2006
01:24:42,951 --> 01:24:43,380
diseases within running pants,
but a listen,

2007
01:24:43,381 --> 01:24:45,720
it's a fucking,
it's an excellent possibility.

2008
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:48,040
I should add that whole story to my 
house.

2009
01:24:48,430 --> 01:24:51,450
Vegas routine.
It's totally true.

2010
01:24:56,630 --> 01:25:00,620
Joe Always talks about 2012 new topic.
Who the fuck are you talking about?

2011
01:25:00,621 --> 01:25:03,020
Dummy?
I'll keep answering this chick's tweets.

2012
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:06,770
When did we talk about 2012.
We didn't bring that up.

2013
01:25:06,771 --> 01:25:10,310
I have no idea.
Poker shut your mouth shut.

2014
01:25:10,311 --> 01:25:11,810
You're dirty.
Dirty mouth.

2015
01:25:12,290 --> 01:25:15,770
This guy says I use naturally speaking.
Nine point five on the PC.

2016
01:25:15,771 --> 01:25:18,110
It's pretty good.
I have a little bit of speech impediment

2017
01:25:18,111 --> 01:25:21,080
due to my cerebral palsy.
You speak much clearer than I do,

2018
01:25:21,081 --> 01:25:24,020
so you should have no problem.
I believe there's a new version.

2019
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:25,550
Huh?
I wonder though,

2020
01:25:25,551 --> 01:25:29,180
if that's the pc one is better.
Does anybody know if the better pc,

2021
01:25:30,990 --> 01:25:35,270
the pc one rather is better than the Mac
one or is it the exact same sense if,

2022
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,880
if the PC ones better used to be that 
way?

2023
01:25:38,150 --> 01:25:39,610
It used to be the,
the uh,

2024
01:25:40,290 --> 01:25:43,100
that the pc one was better.
It definitely used to be.

2025
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,740
But uh,
I don't know.

2026
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:48,120
Now the Mac users,
like eight percent.

2027
01:25:48,290 --> 01:25:49,640
Ten percent of the population or 
something.

2028
01:25:49,641 --> 01:25:51,060
What is it now?
Eight?

2029
01:25:55,130 --> 01:25:56,060
Yeah.
What percentage is it?

2030
01:25:56,061 --> 01:25:56,300
Man?

2031
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:57,360
I have no idea.

2032
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:04,650
There is a mental game,
one can play called channel the alien 

2033
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:04,650
when one

2034
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:09,100
can find the answers to complex 
questions simply by visualizing an 

2035
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,930
ancient alien from beyond pretending to 
channel the answers.

2036
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:14,630
Try it sometime.
You'll be surprised.

2037
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:20,830
Okay,
so would this guy is saying this holy 

2038
01:26:20,830 --> 01:26:23,651
chaos.
Twenty three is that you can find the 

2039
01:26:23,651 --> 01:26:27,641
wise answers to things by pretending to 
channel an alien who has the wise 

2040
01:26:27,741 --> 01:26:28,340
answers.

2041
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:36,940
What the fuck are you talking about?
Why don't even think about that.

2042
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:38,870
Are you getting.

2043
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:40,760
We'd Bitch.
Okay.

2044
01:26:40,770 --> 01:26:43,110
Because that shit is strong.
It's a little too strong for you.

2045
01:26:43,111 --> 01:26:45,060
You're,
you're off the track and into the woods.

2046
01:26:45,061 --> 01:26:50,061
Okay.
You're fucking train is knocking over 

2047
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:50,061
trees right now.
That doesn't make any sense.

2048
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:54,500
I,
I guess I kind of see what you're 

2049
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:54,500
saying.
You know,

2050
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,550
and I sort of do that sometimes where I 
say to myself,

2051
01:26:56,551 --> 01:26:57,930
okay,
if I wasn't me,

2052
01:26:58,140 --> 01:27:02,570
how would I advise myself?
And I pretend that I'm talking to a,

2053
01:27:02,660 --> 01:27:06,180
a much more intelligent version of me 
guiding my life.

2054
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:09,090
I do do that,
but I don't pretend it's God damn alien.

2055
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:14,660
You know?
I just try to think of what is 

2056
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:17,120
objectively separate myself from my life
and what's the best advice I could give 

2057
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:17,820
myself if I was smarter than I am.

2058
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,830
I started about it again and mad at 
myself.

2059
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:21,800
Yes.

2060
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:25,760
That's funny.
Tell me Shit ever.

2061
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:27,970
I think.
I think you're silly fellow.

2062
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:33,030
Channel the alien.
Okay.

2063
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:35,490
Louis Guy.

2064
01:27:36,270 --> 01:27:41,270
Puny human.
The reason red band isn't paying 

2065
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:43,071
attention,
it's because you talk about the same 

2066
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:43,071
shit every show.
Then don't tune in faggot.

2067
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:45,220
You don't have to like it.
It's all free.

2068
01:27:45,221 --> 01:27:49,360
Bitch Ron.
Jeremy fucked your roommate.

2069
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,190
Whoa.
Somebody's roommate.

2070
01:27:51,191 --> 01:27:52,240
Got Fuck by Ron.
Jeremy.

2071
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:56,290
Uh,
I'm glad you like them,

2072
01:27:56,291 --> 01:27:57,190
dude.
All right.

2073
01:27:57,220 --> 01:27:59,200
Let's go to page one.
She questions we've got here.

2074
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:05,770
How do you think the world would turn 
out if it were to be divided by 

2075
01:28:05,770 --> 01:28:09,671
believers and nonbelievers?
Would the believers eventually end up 

2076
01:28:09,671 --> 01:28:11,510
just raping and murdering the 
nonbelievers into their cult?

2077
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:13,510
I hate these questions.

2078
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:20,960
You know the,
the real problem with believers and 

2079
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:20,960
nonbelievers is nobody fucking knows you
don't know,

2080
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,860
and nobody knows.
You shouldn't be a goddamn believer.

2081
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:25,320
We should it be a questionnaire which 
try to figure things out,

2082
01:28:25,321 --> 01:28:30,321
but what I need,
whenever anybody tells you they got the 

2083
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:32,660
answers,
that person's either full of shit or 

2084
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:32,660
they want your money,
period.

2085
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:32,660
No one has the answers.
You don't know.

2086
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:34,140
It's impossible.
There's no way.

2087
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:38,380
Have I listened to any Daniel Dennett 
lectures?

2088
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:40,540
No.
I don't know who Daniel Dennett is.

2089
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:45,020
Do you know dental than it is now?
I will never find information.

2090
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:47,200
Some more information.

2091
01:28:47,230 --> 01:28:52,230
See,
that didn't go off on me about the last 

2092
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:52,230
APP.
Podcast.

2093
01:28:52,230 --> 01:28:52,650
How about politics?
Yeah.

2094
01:28:53,030 --> 01:28:55,030
Emailed me.
He made a threat about it.

2095
01:28:55,031 --> 01:28:57,370
He fucking tried to contact me on some.
I am.

2096
01:28:57,550 --> 01:28:59,020
It's an interesting topic.

2097
01:28:59,150 --> 01:29:04,150
No,
because I go back and forth on it and I 

2098
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:04,150
agree with you to a certain extent.
It really is silly.

2099
01:29:04,150 --> 01:29:09,070
I'm to do.
You can waste so much of your energy 

2100
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:10,560
thinking about politics,
but then you know,

2101
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,870
the argument is we're supposed to be 
governing ourselves,

2102
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:17,900
governing ourselves in this country and 
that you get the option to vote and you 

2103
01:29:18,171 --> 01:29:23,171
know,
you get the right to express your 

2104
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:23,171
opinion.
You can actually change the world.

2105
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:23,610
But I don't know if you can,
you know,

2106
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:28,660
I'm not completely convinced at this 
point with the amount of money that 

2107
01:29:28,660 --> 01:29:31,971
they're able to contribute to campaign 
funds that giant corporations are able 

2108
01:29:31,971 --> 01:29:31,971
to,
they're,

2109
01:29:31,971 --> 01:29:32,610
they're literally shaping the way people
see things,

2110
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:34,430
they're putting ads and,
and,

2111
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:39,480
and manipulating people's thoughts and 
getting people to believe things that 

2112
01:29:39,480 --> 01:29:39,540
aren't necessarily true.
Also,

2113
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,820
they can push a certain agenda so that 
somebody can make money.

2114
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,460
I mean,
the situation is totally corrupt.

2115
01:29:45,030 --> 01:29:50,030
I mean,
so much money is involved in politics 

2116
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:50,030
now and so much money is involved in,
you know,

2117
01:29:50,030 --> 01:29:54,981
in running the world and you know,
just look at what Obama's done with 

2118
01:29:54,981 --> 01:29:57,540
this,
all this fucking bailouts and this.

2119
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:00,990
When you look at this whole healthcare 
system thing,

2120
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,020
someone has to be making money.
There's no way they'd be putting this 

2121
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:07,320
much effort into this whole healthcare 
thing if it was just about,

2122
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:12,440
you know,
keeping people healthy and making sure 

2123
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:12,540
that people have medical coverage.
It's not there,

2124
01:30:12,541 --> 01:30:14,370
they're just there,
there's money involved in it.

2125
01:30:14,371 --> 01:30:19,371
It's corruption,
it's gonna get crazy and it's a goddamn 

2126
01:30:19,371 --> 01:30:20,760
money grabbed just like the bailout is.
And it's all very,

2127
01:30:20,761 --> 01:30:25,761
very boring to me.
And the real thing about it is it does 

2128
01:30:25,761 --> 01:30:29,361
get boring.
It's a real thing about it is you can 

2129
01:30:29,361 --> 01:30:29,361
never have all the information.
It's impossible.

2130
01:30:29,361 --> 01:30:34,250
It's a trap.
I care about the things I want to care 

2131
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:34,250
about,
about the government.

2132
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,850
Meaning if they decided to make a bill 
about banning the internet or that 

2133
01:30:37,850 --> 01:30:38,670
night,
cats are going to be illegal.

2134
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:40,740
They don't care about that part.
That's not part of it.

2135
01:30:40,830 --> 01:30:45,830
But I'm not going to sit there and try 
to figure out everything from a to z 

2136
01:30:45,830 --> 01:30:46,020
about our government and freak out about
it because you know what I.

2137
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:48,420
I'm freaking out about my mail being 
delivered today.

2138
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:49,110
You know,
I'm thinking,

2139
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:50,080
how am I going?
Shit.

2140
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:52,770
If I did that,
I'll just be an angry person.

2141
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,050
It would argue shit.
Yeah,

2142
01:30:55,190 --> 01:30:56,300
I agree with you.
I see you

2143
01:30:56,320 --> 01:31:01,320
point.
But people could also argue that that's 

2144
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,181
apathy.
People could say that that's what's 

2145
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:03,181
wrong with this country is that people 
don't care.

2146
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:06,870
But I say that until someone 
acknowledges the fact that this system 

2147
01:31:06,911 --> 01:31:11,911
is broken,
we need a radical overhaul of the 

2148
01:31:11,911 --> 01:31:16,321
system.
A complete restructuring of the way we 

2149
01:31:16,321 --> 01:31:16,321
do business in this country.

2150
01:31:16,321 --> 01:31:20,800
It's called moving to Canada.
It's not even moving to Canada because 

2151
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:20,800
they're corrupt too.
There's a big fucking.

2152
01:31:20,801 --> 01:31:21,110
Yeah,
there's

2153
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:23,120
a big scandal.
The Minister of Finance,

2154
01:31:23,121 --> 01:31:25,280
I believe it was involved in a big 
scandal in Canada.

2155
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:27,740
People are corrupt.
It's human beings.

2156
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:31,400
People are less corrupt in places where 
people are less ambitious like Canada,

2157
01:31:31,401 --> 01:31:33,140
where people are more laid back and 
friendlier,

2158
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:34,580
you know,
and that's one of the things that's cool

2159
01:31:34,581 --> 01:31:36,110
about Canada.
People are just like,

2160
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:38,810
they're less crazy up there.
They're a little cooler,

2161
01:31:38,811 --> 01:31:40,280
a little calmer,
you know,

2162
01:31:40,310 --> 01:31:43,460
I think that I think,
you know,

2163
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:48,490
you could waste your whole life trying 
to understand the system and be a part 

2164
01:31:48,490 --> 01:31:50,930
of it and argue and go to court and it 
will become your everything.

2165
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:56,290
And it's a system that we're born into.
We're born into this system that we did 

2166
01:31:56,290 --> 01:32:00,791
not choose.
We have no control of and it's so 

2167
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:00,791
comprehensive

2168
01:32:00,791 --> 01:32:05,310
and so fucking intertwined that just to 
study a single branch of it would take 

2169
01:32:06,281 --> 01:32:09,730
up all of your time if you just wanted 
to understand the stock market.

2170
01:32:09,940 --> 01:32:14,410
That shit would take up every fucking 
hour of every day of your life.

2171
01:32:14,470 --> 01:32:19,470
Just trying to figure out how all that 
shit worked and even then look at that 

2172
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:19,470
fucking guy that,
that,

2173
01:32:19,470 --> 01:32:20,500
that,
that Bernie made off.

2174
01:32:20,501 --> 01:32:25,501
Motherfucker.
That guy was ripping off people who 

2175
01:32:25,501 --> 01:32:25,501
understood the business.
That kind of ripped off everybody.

2176
01:32:25,501 --> 01:32:29,200
He ripped off millionaires and shit.
He ripped off fucking Steven Spielberg,

2177
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:34,201
you know,
he ripped off all these like really big 

2178
01:32:34,201 --> 01:32:34,570
name people.
So that means nobody knows how it works.

2179
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:39,630
Nobody understands that thing.
Could you imagine if your whole life is 

2180
01:32:39,630 --> 01:32:43,651
dedicated to studying the stock market?
You're supposed expert people ask you 

2181
01:32:43,651 --> 01:32:44,140
for advice.
Anyone you got fucked.

2182
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:50,120
You could say God damn con game.
Nobody understands it.

2183
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:52,310
Fuck politics.
It's not politics.

2184
01:32:52,311 --> 01:32:54,320
We're talking about now we're talking 
about the whole system.

2185
01:32:54,650 --> 01:32:57,110
We're talking about money,
we're talking about everything and we're

2186
01:32:57,111 --> 01:32:59,030
talking about this attitude of fuck 
politics,

2187
01:32:59,031 --> 01:33:02,280
just like what,
what can be done?

2188
01:33:02,490 --> 01:33:03,990
That's the big question.
What,

2189
01:33:03,991 --> 01:33:06,720
what can be done to make the world 
better?

2190
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:09,950
If you had any say in,
you know,

2191
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:14,990
trying to figure out what direction we 
could go to make everything easier for 

2192
01:33:14,990 --> 01:33:14,990
everybody.
What would you do?

2193
01:33:16,380 --> 01:33:19,920
Have everything be a lot.
Make a lot more sense.

2194
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,910
Because right now everything from the 
schools taxing.

2195
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:27,510
Do you know everything about the 
government makes no sense to the average

2196
01:33:27,511 --> 01:33:30,090
person,
but if they can have like a website,

2197
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:33,000
you have to go to everyday and go,
okay guys,

2198
01:33:33,001 --> 01:33:36,690
today's topic of the day.
Do you think that slavery's legal?

2199
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:37,470
Yes.
No.

2200
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:39,240
And then have the whole country vote 
right there.

2201
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:42,330
Make it super planned out and easy and 
make it something like that.

2202
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:44,850
Because right now no one gives a fuck 
what's going on on,

2203
01:33:44,851 --> 01:33:46,260
you know,
you started talking about it

2204
01:33:46,360 --> 01:33:51,360
occasion and money and stuff like that.
Then you get into really complex 

2205
01:33:51,360 --> 01:33:55,351
subjects.
It's not that simple as like having 

2206
01:33:55,351 --> 01:33:55,351
people vote because then he runs the 
same issue,

2207
01:33:55,351 --> 01:33:56,680
like people just put out propaganda,
Oh,

2208
01:33:56,681 --> 01:34:00,130
if slavery is not legal,
that means the Iraqis will attack us and

2209
01:34:00,131 --> 01:34:03,510
they'll rape your baby and next thing 
you know slavery's legal again.

2210
01:34:05,020 --> 01:34:05,990
Yeah,
I know,

2211
01:34:05,991 --> 01:34:10,991
but it shouldn't be.
It should be a vote though system 

2212
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:11,990
because right now it's like no one gives
them online.

2213
01:34:12,090 --> 01:34:17,090
Like if there's a vote online,
whether or not you should be killed 

2214
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:17,090
tonight.
Right now,

2215
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:20,910
if people watch this podcast,
maybe 60 percent of the people would 

2216
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:20,910
want you to.

2217
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:22,700
Obviously that's how crazy they are.
I know that.

2218
01:34:22,710 --> 01:34:26,040
That's true.
It is like allow penciled out of the way

2219
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:28,650
all this shit's all broken anyway.
You can't fix it.

2220
01:34:28,651 --> 01:34:33,651
No matter what.
Me read bad things about fucking any of 

2221
01:34:33,651 --> 01:34:36,471
it doesn't matter.
It's going to happen the way it's going 

2222
01:34:36,471 --> 01:34:39,581
to happen.
Just called yourself by your Internet 

2223
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:39,581
name.
I know.

2224
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:39,581
That's what that.
From that,

2225
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:39,870
from that thread,
everyone's.

2226
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:43,170
Everybody was calling me and I get third
person cares about a red band.

2227
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,360
You know what?
Raymond was designed for?

2228
01:34:45,361 --> 01:34:50,361
Mac,
computers and cats and you know I agree 

2229
01:34:50,361 --> 01:34:52,641
completely because who the fuck cares?
I can't change anything and even if I 

2230
01:34:52,641 --> 01:34:54,810
could one person,
I don't want to devote my life to see if

2231
01:34:54,811 --> 01:34:56,640
I could or not,
I don't give a fuck about that.

2232
01:34:56,641 --> 01:34:58,020
It's like baseball and it

2233
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:03,060
was a real problem is it does take away 
from everything that you enjoy and 

2234
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:03,060
people say,
well,

2235
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:07,310
you have to fight for your rights really
to you just have your rights.

2236
01:35:07,380 --> 01:35:10,310
That's the real God damn problem.
The real problem is that I have to think

2237
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:12,710
about this fucked up system.
Not all that.

2238
01:35:12,711 --> 01:35:16,160
It's so broken.
You have to keep an eye on it 24 hours a

2239
01:35:16,161 --> 01:35:21,161
day because people are just stealing and
getting us into wars and making terrible

2240
01:35:21,171 --> 01:35:26,171
decisions and they'll blame it on all 
these troubles that are happening in 

2241
01:35:26,171 --> 01:35:29,891
other countries.
But when you start fucking reading into 

2242
01:35:29,891 --> 01:35:29,891
it and you find out the shit that we do 
that causes all these troubles,

2243
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:31,130
you know,
God damn.

2244
01:35:31,131 --> 01:35:32,690
No wonder why everybody fucking hates 
us.

2245
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:34,340
We got our dirty little fingers in 
everything,

2246
01:35:34,490 --> 01:35:35,540
so it's like,
it's not me.

2247
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:40,600
It's not me that has my dirty little 
fingers in Afghanistan and Iraq and you 

2248
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,051
know,
and fucking all sorts of shit that goes 

2249
01:35:44,051 --> 01:35:44,051
on in third world countries and it's not
you either.

2250
01:35:44,051 --> 01:35:47,890
You should be able to fucking pursue 
what you want to do and the idea that 

2251
01:35:47,890 --> 01:35:48,140
you have to go over there and kill some 
people to do that.

2252
01:35:48,141 --> 01:35:50,780
It's just damn.
In 2010,

2253
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:54,710
we pretend like you go to Australia.
Like when we went to Australia recently,

2254
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:57,740
dude,
people in Australia are so fucking cool.

2255
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:01,910
They're so fun to be around such a 
friendly culture.

2256
01:36:02,300 --> 01:36:04,430
What if we decided to go to war with 
Australia?

2257
01:36:04,431 --> 01:36:09,431
I'm not.
Would that be all a sudden we're 

2258
01:36:09,431 --> 01:36:10,991
supposed to be tricked into believing 
that we have a problem with this 

2259
01:36:10,991 --> 01:36:11,450
continent that we'd never been probably 
happened in our lifetime.

2260
01:36:11,660 --> 01:36:16,660
If it didn't.
I mean it's because we're going to war 

2261
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:16,660
together as a group against some other 
motherfuckers.

2262
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:21,071
I mean,
that's really the only reason why we're 

2263
01:36:21,071 --> 01:36:22,511
not.
Because we've decided to band up and go 

2264
01:36:22,511 --> 01:36:22,790
jack these fools and take their shit,
but it's,

2265
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:24,740
it's,
it's amazing that you know,

2266
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:25,520
our system.

2267
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:30,820
There's no other system though,
I mean when you get 300 million people 

2268
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:30,820
in place,
what the fuck?

2269
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:35,441
There's no other model of how to run a 
300 million person empire and to do it 

2270
01:36:35,441 --> 01:36:38,030
correctly where people think it's fair 
because people are just.

2271
01:36:38,190 --> 01:36:43,190
It's part of life is an intelligence 
test and part of the intelligence test 

2272
01:36:43,190 --> 01:36:45,290
is how susceptible are you to 
manipulation.

2273
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:47,420
You know what I mean?
Literally it's like a game.

2274
01:36:47,480 --> 01:36:50,390
It's like there's people like these 
evangelists that you see,

2275
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:51,380
you know,
at 3:00

2276
01:36:51,381 --> 01:36:56,381
in the morning that are fucking talking 
a certain cadence and especially that 

2277
01:36:56,381 --> 01:36:56,840
black guy with a hot dog rolls in the 
back of his neck.

2278
01:36:56,841 --> 01:37:01,841
You know,
that guy I'm talking about that 

2279
01:37:01,841 --> 01:37:01,841
motherfucker is always,
you know,

2280
01:37:01,841 --> 01:37:05,920
spouting out some Bible Shit,
but he's doing it so charismatic and 

2281
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:08,831
he's sweating like a pig and everybody 
in the audience is going bananas and 

2282
01:37:08,831 --> 01:37:08,831
it's an intelligence test.

2283
01:37:08,831 --> 01:37:13,540
Intelligence test is,
do you believe this guy is so confident 

2284
01:37:13,540 --> 01:37:14,690
and speaking so clearly?
Do you believe what he's saying?

2285
01:37:14,691 --> 01:37:16,340
Because if you do,
you're a dumb ass.

2286
01:37:16,550 --> 01:37:21,550
You know,
he's just tricking you by being so 

2287
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:21,650
confident in what he's saying.
And that's what it really is.

2288
01:37:21,651 --> 01:37:26,651
It's like this whole,
this whole world is like a gigantic 

2289
01:37:26,651 --> 01:37:29,651
intelligence tests and even at the 
highest level people are failing left 

2290
01:37:29,651 --> 01:37:29,651
and right.
If you start getting into these,

2291
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,120
the,
the,

2292
01:37:30,121 --> 01:37:30,530
the,
you know,

2293
01:37:30,531 --> 01:37:32,370
the Republicans want to control the 
house and like,

2294
01:37:32,420 --> 01:37:34,730
what the fuck are you talking about?
Like,

2295
01:37:34,731 --> 01:37:37,460
look what you're talking about.
You're talking about nonsense.

2296
01:37:37,461 --> 01:37:40,340
If everybody just stepped back and said 
this is all nonsense,

2297
01:37:40,341 --> 01:37:42,620
this whole thing sucks.
Stop.

2298
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:46,250
We're not going to fucking keep going 
with windows 95.

2299
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,810
Shut the fuck up.
Okay.

2300
01:37:47,811 --> 01:37:50,450
Windows 95 sucks.
We need some new shit.

2301
01:37:50,451 --> 01:37:52,400
Okay.
Do you have empty?

2302
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:53,800
Do you have windows?
2,000,

2303
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:56,040
whereas Vista,
whereas windows seven,

2304
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,350
you motherfuckers.
Where's MCA?

2305
01:37:57,430 --> 01:38:02,430
Wes knows me.
Those dark dark time in American 

2306
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:02,440
history.
You know,

2307
01:38:02,441 --> 01:38:05,560
we need a better operating system.
And the problem is we don't,

2308
01:38:05,561 --> 01:38:08,820
we just keep patching up the same stupid
fucking system we've always had.

2309
01:38:09,630 --> 01:38:11,610
So what do you do?
Do you just sit back?

2310
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:13,070
No,
you don't move because you moved.

2311
01:38:13,071 --> 01:38:14,930
They're going to be under control of 
some other mothers.

2312
01:38:15,820 --> 01:38:20,820
I look at it,
it's like if you have a neighbor's dog 

2313
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:20,820
that's barking,
you know,

2314
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:22,140
you can either sit there and deal with 
it for as long,

2315
01:38:22,380 --> 01:38:25,320
but once it gets too bad you have to do 
something about it.

2316
01:38:25,321 --> 01:38:30,321
And so that's how I feel about it.
If I still wake up and everything's 

2317
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:33,921
fine,
nothing's really affecting me on an 

2318
01:38:33,921 --> 01:38:34,650
everyday basis,
enough to care about it,

2319
01:38:34,651 --> 01:38:37,410
then I'll be fine.
But if something crazy happens,

2320
01:38:37,470 --> 01:38:39,780
like they decided to do something that's
going to affect me,

2321
01:38:39,781 --> 01:38:40,950
then I'll just be like,
you know what?

2322
01:38:40,951 --> 01:38:45,951
Fuck you.
I'll move on because I don't give a 

2323
01:38:45,951 --> 01:38:45,951
fuck.
Like I'm not like United States or for,

2324
01:38:45,951 --> 01:38:46,050
for the rest of my life.
I don't care.

2325
01:38:46,051 --> 01:38:47,100
You know,
like I'm sure

2326
01:38:47,820 --> 01:38:52,820
move a bunch of times,
move around a bunch of times in this 

2327
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:53,710
country you realize the United States 
doesn't have one mentality and then when

2328
01:38:53,711 --> 01:38:56,000
you move or when you travel to other 
places,

2329
01:38:56,001 --> 01:38:56,440
you're like,
God,

2330
01:38:56,441 --> 01:38:58,430
I could live here,
can easily live with.

2331
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:00,210
It's a huge planner.
Dude.

2332
01:39:00,220 --> 01:39:05,220
England is pretty dope.
I like living in the weather kind of 

2333
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:05,220
socks or rains a lot,
but to the people you fun.

2334
01:39:05,220 --> 01:39:07,780
I enjoy it there.
I love doing shows in England.

2335
01:39:07,781 --> 01:39:09,790
England is fucking fun.
You know you could live in England,

2336
01:39:09,940 --> 01:39:12,270
you can live in Australia,
you'd have,

2337
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,270
you would have no problem in Sydney.
Do it.

2338
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:15,610
You'd have to wear sunscreen.
That's it.

2339
01:39:15,611 --> 01:39:17,740
They get no ozone.
Layer it up there to.

2340
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:20,020
Everybody gets jacked.
There's skin cancer,

2341
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:25,021
less ramp.
They have these big ads on billboards 

2342
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:25,021
about skin.
Cancer is everywhere.

2343
01:39:25,021 --> 01:39:27,130
It's a real problem.
But do the people are friendly though.

2344
01:39:27,140 --> 01:39:29,560
The weather's beautiful.
You know the fucking,

2345
01:39:29,590 --> 01:39:31,180
the coastlines.
Gorgeous.

2346
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,980
It has no problem there.
No.

2347
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:39,440
The idea that this one fucking place,
you know the from one ocean to another 

2348
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,320
ocean that's like so 5,000
years ago,

2349
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:46,860
you know,
that we're fighting for our land like 

2350
01:39:46,860 --> 01:39:47,680
Jesus Christ,
especially in America,

2351
01:39:47,681 --> 01:39:49,970
to think that where they just,
when we're,

2352
01:39:49,990 --> 01:39:53,800
you're a citizen in America,
you are just like riding in the balls of

2353
01:39:53,801 --> 01:39:55,480
the Dick.
That's fucking the world.

2354
01:39:55,670 --> 01:39:57,910
You're just a part of this gigantic 
machine.

2355
01:39:57,911 --> 01:40:00,010
It's just bone in the world.
You know,

2356
01:40:00,280 --> 01:40:04,900
two planes come over here and smash into
buildings and we lose our marbles and we

2357
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:09,990
wind up killing a million civilians in 
Iraq and justifying it that we're 

2358
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:11,200
keeping ourselves safe over here.
It's fucking nuts,

2359
01:40:11,201 --> 01:40:12,400
man.
What's the answer?

2360
01:40:12,401 --> 01:40:13,960
God dammit.
What's the answer?

2361
01:40:14,110 --> 01:40:15,850
Internet people.
What's the answer?

2362
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:18,040
Twitter people.
There's No God damn answer.

2363
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:21,550
There is no god Damn fucking answer.
It doesn't exist.

2364
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:26,780
You lose your marbles.
You can't buy new ones because they 

2365
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:26,780
don't make them anymore.

2366
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:26,780
Yeah.
The marble industries.

2367
01:40:26,780 --> 01:40:27,830
We're at A.
we're at a businessman.

2368
01:40:31,630 --> 01:40:32,290
Yeah.
Pretty soon.

2369
01:40:32,291 --> 01:40:34,000
I think it's almost going to be like how
the Internet,

2370
01:40:34,110 --> 01:40:39,110
uh,
kind of like in the old days I wasn't 

2371
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:40,660
talking to people from England every day
in Australia and that kind of broke that

2372
01:40:40,661 --> 01:40:45,661
wall.
I think in the future there's not gonna 

2373
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:45,661
be like,
well,

2374
01:40:45,661 --> 01:40:46,060
it's religion kind of fizzes out fizzles
out a little bit more.

2375
01:40:46,150 --> 01:40:51,150
I think even just countries are going to
fizzle out more because we're probably 

2376
01:40:51,150 --> 01:40:52,300
going to be just teleport into Japan 
every day.

2377
01:40:52,301 --> 01:40:52,870
You know,
like,

2378
01:40:52,930 --> 01:40:53,830
Hey,
every go to Japan,

2379
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:53,980
I'll be

2380
01:40:53,980 --> 01:40:56,800
right back to me.
Definitely dissolved.

2381
01:40:56,830 --> 01:40:58,870
And the only thing that keeps us in this
one,

2382
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:03,490
this one idea is travel,
another difficult to get in planes.

2383
01:41:03,491 --> 01:41:08,491
Then when you land,
you have to be screened for what's the 

2384
01:41:08,491 --> 01:41:08,491
next plan plan.
Plan.

2385
01:41:08,660 --> 01:41:13,410
It's probably going to be sending our 
brainwaves to another body in Japan that

2386
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,620
we have like a backup body and if we get
to a position or we talked about before,

2387
01:41:17,621 --> 01:41:22,621
like we talked about,
like twitter and facebook and this 

2388
01:41:22,621 --> 01:41:22,621
connectivity that people share right 
now,

2389
01:41:22,621 --> 01:41:24,940
it's like we're connected so much more 
now than we've ever been before.

2390
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:29,890
If we really do get to a place where no 
secrets will exist,

2391
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:34,920
where everyone will know everything,
you'd be able to read each other's mind 

2392
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:34,920
will be able to access each other's 
information.

2393
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:39,840
Maybe that's the only way we'll ever 
really have like a real government will 

2394
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:44,430
really realized that we really can't 
bullshit things that we used to have to 

2395
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:44,430
come clean about.

2396
01:41:44,430 --> 01:41:48,960
The fact that we live in a dictatorship 
that's dressed up as a democracy where 

2397
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:52,840
these gigantic corporations are making 
millions of dollars because we just have

2398
01:41:52,841 --> 01:41:57,841
to just,
just accept the fact that we're under 

2399
01:41:57,841 --> 01:41:58,080
their rule the same way they accepted 
the fact when they lived,

2400
01:41:58,081 --> 01:42:03,081
you know,
in England they were under the rule of 

2401
01:42:03,081 --> 01:42:04,711
the king and you know,
and all these different countries that 

2402
01:42:04,711 --> 01:42:04,711
are controlled by,
you know,

2403
01:42:04,711 --> 01:42:08,280
by monarchs,
they have to accept that it's clean and 

2404
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:11,431
then they know what the fuck it is.
Like in Thailand there's a Goddamn Qing 

2405
01:42:11,431 --> 01:42:11,431
period.
That's what it is.

2406
01:42:11,431 --> 01:42:12,140
There's a king and you got to deal with 
that shit.

2407
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:17,160
You can't talk shit about them and maybe
it's either that or we realize we can't 

2408
01:42:17,501 --> 01:42:22,501
do that anymore.
We realized we can't live like this 

2409
01:42:22,501 --> 01:42:22,501
anymore.
Maybe that's the only thing that's gonna

2410
01:42:22,501 --> 01:42:22,600
save us.
Maybe this technology,

2411
01:42:23,230 --> 01:42:28,230
you know,
maybe it'll get the people who are 

2412
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:30,391
actually running things to realize how 
ridiculous it is when everybody knows 

2413
01:42:30,391 --> 01:42:30,391
they're bullshit.

2414
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:31,730
I don't know man.
It's a fucking.

2415
01:42:31,780 --> 01:42:33,590
It's a tricky situation.
You know,

2416
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:39,770
student,
we are completely headed towards an age 

2417
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:42,600
for lies and deception will fade away.
Yet we will never understand all of 

2418
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:42,910
everything.
I think that's what we were just talking

2419
01:42:42,911 --> 01:42:44,770
about.
So that's contradictory.

2420
01:42:44,771 --> 01:42:45,700
Yeah.
Yeah,

2421
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:47,200
it is.
But we're just talking about what's,

2422
01:42:47,230 --> 01:42:52,230
what's here right now and you know what,
what may or may not be possible in the 

2423
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:52,230
future.
I mean,

2424
01:42:52,230 --> 01:42:55,150
the idea that we're gonna get to an age 
where everything is connected.

2425
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:57,430
That really is speculation,
man.

2426
01:42:57,431 --> 01:42:59,280
I mean,
we don't really know if we're ever going

2427
01:42:59,281 --> 01:43:04,281
to get that far.
We don't know if we're going to get hit 

2428
01:43:04,281 --> 01:43:05,881
by a gigantic meter or fucking polarized
caps or shift or when you look at the 

2429
01:43:05,881 --> 01:43:07,100
history of the earth,
who the fuck knows what the hell's going

2430
01:43:07,101 --> 01:43:07,840
to happen to us?

2431
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:10,540
You know,
there's always some new shit going down.

2432
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,600
No,
you know what the nuttiest thing about,

2433
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:16,780
about like I was watching these solar 
system documentaries today,

2434
01:43:17,170 --> 01:43:20,770
the nuttiest thing is how many different
planets had been hit by planets.

2435
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:22,280
You know,
like they were.

2436
01:43:22,281 --> 01:43:27,281
There was a thing on uranus about how 
they recognize those rings around your 

2437
01:43:27,281 --> 01:43:30,791
anus and they believed it was some sort 
of a collision and they were talking 

2438
01:43:30,791 --> 01:43:33,751
about moons colliding.
Then eventually your ransom Williams 

2439
01:43:33,751 --> 01:43:33,751
there,
they're real close to each other.

2440
01:43:33,751 --> 01:43:35,420
Eventually in a slam I knew each other 
like,

2441
01:43:36,110 --> 01:43:41,110
damn.
Imagine if we realize that earth was 

2442
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:44,971
getting hit by a planet.
It was like 100 years away if we saw 

2443
01:43:44,971 --> 01:43:44,971
planners.
Yeah,

2444
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:47,170
I mean how long would it take for a 
planet to hit us?

2445
01:43:47,380 --> 01:43:51,280
I mean like I think they were saying 
that your readiness is a year,

2446
01:43:51,310 --> 01:43:53,660
like a year and your readiness is like 
hundreds of years.

2447
01:43:54,110 --> 01:43:55,820
I think it was 160.
I don't remember what it was.

2448
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,490
It was a bunch of years.
They're there.

2449
01:43:57,500 --> 01:43:59,750
Their winter alone was like 60 plus 
years.

2450
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,850
I think that's what they're saying.
How,

2451
01:44:02,940 --> 01:44:04,220
how many,
you know,

2452
01:44:04,221 --> 01:44:09,221
that's a long ass time.
How many years would be able to 

2453
01:44:09,221 --> 01:44:09,320
recognize like if a plant was headed our
way,

2454
01:44:09,740 --> 01:44:13,070
like if there was an inter inter solar 
system,

2455
01:44:13,071 --> 01:44:15,850
intruder a got like a plant that's in 
another,

2456
01:44:15,860 --> 01:44:17,410
the solar system.
It's coming,

2457
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:22,580
it would be faster.
It just seems like it would just happen 

2458
01:44:22,580 --> 01:44:23,060
faster for some reason,
even though it probably isn't,

2459
01:44:23,450 --> 01:44:28,450
but why would it seemed like that if it 
takes a year for the earth to go around 

2460
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:28,450
the sun,
right?

2461
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:29,840
Doesn't.
That was not what the whole deal.

2462
01:44:29,841 --> 01:44:33,550
I mean it's like it's,
I guess spins like asteroids.

2463
01:44:34,180 --> 01:44:35,230
It goes around the sun and heat

2464
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:37,200
year.
Right?

2465
01:44:37,650 --> 01:44:40,650
That's pretty God damn close and it 
takes us a year to go around.

2466
01:44:40,860 --> 01:44:42,870
If some shit was coming in from another 
planet,

2467
01:44:42,871 --> 01:44:44,210
it wouldn't come that fast.
What it.

2468
01:44:44,340 --> 01:44:47,160
Unless we're moving towards it as it's 
moving towards us.

2469
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:52,250
Who the fuck knows?
The point is that's happened that 

2470
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:54,981
literally has happened to Earth.
There used to be earth one which was 

2471
01:44:54,981 --> 01:44:58,011
just a different planet and then it got 
hit by a planet and that created the 

2472
01:44:58,011 --> 01:44:58,530
moon fucking nuts,
man.

2473
01:44:59,490 --> 01:45:02,460
We that,
that would end all the bullshit.

2474
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:05,220
All the tiger woods,
all the Jesse James,

2475
01:45:05,221 --> 01:45:08,980
all the fucking healthcare and tea 
baggers and you know,

2476
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:12,330
rush limbaugh and Glenn back,
all that Shit would just stop.

2477
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:16,890
If we saw a giant planet in this guy 
that got a little bigger every day,

2478
01:45:17,190 --> 01:45:20,520
whole Lee fuck,
could you imagine

2479
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:25,790
it?
Probably be pretty cool if it wasn't 

2480
01:45:25,790 --> 01:45:26,050
going to hit in your lifetime.
Now it probably be pretty sweet,

2481
01:45:26,070 --> 01:45:29,010
like look at the death moon comment 
section to be used.

2482
01:45:29,370 --> 01:45:34,370
Just die of heart attacks and then other
people would just go raping and 

2483
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:38,271
pillaging and murdering.
That would be a bunch of different 

2484
01:45:38,271 --> 01:45:41,451
things would happen.
It would be people that would live like 

2485
01:45:41,451 --> 01:45:43,820
just savages.
They would just commit all sorts of 

2486
01:45:43,820 --> 01:45:46,140
incredible atrocities and steal and do 
all kinds of other shit and then there'd

2487
01:45:46,141 --> 01:45:47,910
be people that would just become total 
hippies.

2488
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:51,310
Just have orgies and probably what 
people want to trade route.

2489
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:53,600
Imagine.
Really you think so?

2490
01:45:53,601 --> 01:45:55,970
Some people would probably be like nine 
slash 11 times a million.

2491
01:45:55,980 --> 01:46:00,440
Just being sad and probably be so many 
specials on tv about it.

2492
01:46:00,660 --> 01:46:03,910
Song religion would pick up.
Look motherfucker,

2493
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:04,970
oh my God.

2494
01:46:05,290 --> 01:46:08,610
Figure out some passage in the Bible 
that related to this and that they.

2495
01:46:08,940 --> 01:46:12,610
They figured out a way to to to,
to connect the two of them together.

2496
01:46:12,640 --> 01:46:13,270
God,
Dan,

2497
01:46:13,271 --> 01:46:15,870
that would be incredible.
That would be the.

2498
01:46:15,880 --> 01:46:17,500
That's.
That's so possible.

2499
01:46:17,770 --> 01:46:20,320
That's happened.
It's happened in other solar systems.

2500
01:46:20,321 --> 01:46:22,090
I'm sure it's happened here.
You know,

2501
01:46:22,091 --> 01:46:25,300
it can happen in our lifetime.
That would be fucking bonkers,

2502
01:46:25,301 --> 01:46:27,850
man.
If we saw like it was 10 years away,

2503
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:33,330
like we have a real issue,
would they even tell us there would be 

2504
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:34,480
rumors on the Internet?
I don't think they would tell us.

2505
01:46:34,481 --> 01:46:35,710
I don't think anybody was talking about 
it.

2506
01:46:37,880 --> 01:46:39,780
What are the questions?
We'll go to this bridge.

2507
01:46:41,200 --> 01:46:46,030
I think my cat just took a shit in there
so I might smell her last scratching.

2508
01:46:46,780 --> 01:46:48,010
But you're a cat man.
Anyway.

2509
01:46:56,410 --> 01:46:57,040
Hey,
mayhem.

2510
01:46:57,041 --> 01:46:59,320
Miller 12.
When you say Joe was being a Dick,

2511
01:46:59,321 --> 01:47:04,321
I'm telling you it's distracting to me 
and it keeps me from able to do in this 

2512
01:47:04,321 --> 01:47:04,321
podcast.
Well,

2513
01:47:04,321 --> 01:47:07,450
I asked him to not do it.
So you're being a dick.

2514
01:47:09,520 --> 01:47:11,350
I wasted my question.
And religious bullshit.

2515
01:47:11,470 --> 01:47:13,030
Marbles are not dead.
Wow.

2516
01:47:13,060 --> 01:47:15,820
The marvel world is still huge 
apparently.

2517
01:47:18,240 --> 01:47:19,650
Okay.
Let's go with the questions.

2518
01:47:19,651 --> 01:47:24,580
Here were the best substitute for the 
current monetary system.

2519
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:26,590
This dude wants to know who the fuck 
knows,

2520
01:47:26,591 --> 01:47:26,830
right?

2521
01:47:27,910 --> 01:47:32,910
You can't.
I don't think you can have shit out 

2522
01:47:32,910 --> 01:47:35,501
there and the fucking numbers in 
computers that can't.

2523
01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:37,610
It's got to represent something.
Right.

2524
01:47:37,820 --> 01:47:40,700
That's the problem with money is it 
doesn't really represent anything,

2525
01:47:41,150 --> 01:47:46,150
you know,
kind of represents more ideas and 

2526
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:46,150
anything.
It's not like one piece of gold,

2527
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:47,840
you know,
is $1 and you know,

2528
01:47:47,841 --> 01:47:51,380
and that piece of gold was sitting in an
account somewhere and you can go,

2529
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,240
you know,
cashier,

2530
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:54,350
$100,
billion for 100 pieces of gold,

2531
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:55,980
you know,
the,

2532
01:47:56,450 --> 01:47:58,460
it has to mean something.
You can't have it.

2533
01:47:58,461 --> 01:48:01,970
Just all numbers in computers because 
people will just can fuck you.

2534
01:48:02,240 --> 01:48:04,220
You know,
like you've been going through,

2535
01:48:04,221 --> 01:48:05,720
I don't know how much you want to talk 
about this,

2536
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:08,420
but you've been going through some 
bullshit with the irs where they,

2537
01:48:08,421 --> 01:48:13,421
you know,
they audit you and fuck with you and go 

2538
01:48:13,421 --> 01:48:17,060
into numbers and like storing numbers 
and how much numbers did you put on this

2539
01:48:17,061 --> 01:48:20,360
and how many numbers went to that?
And politics to me

2540
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:24,320
is it,
my brain does not care about any of that

2541
01:48:24,530 --> 01:48:29,530
shit,
but that's how I've always been like 

2542
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:29,530
that.
Anything that I'm forced to do almost,

2543
01:48:29,530 --> 01:48:31,040
I almost don't care about,
you know.

2544
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:37,030
Yeah.
Well that's sort of one of the reasons 

2545
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,030
why,
you know,

2546
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,550
people sort of become artistic in the 
first place.

2547
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:42,810
You know,
I think one of the reasons why people 

2548
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:42,810
would call artistic is because you know,
you're,

2549
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:42,810
you're

2550
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:44,400
fighting against a bunch of shit you 
don't like and you,

2551
01:48:44,410 --> 01:48:49,410
you go against the grain and you wind up
doing something that's totally 

2552
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:49,410
unconventional,
you know,

2553
01:48:49,410 --> 01:48:53,940
that's how people come and positions and
comedians and artists and stuff on the 

2554
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:55,240
side street path.
Yeah.

2555
01:48:55,241 --> 01:49:00,241
That's why it's so weird when like a 
comedian enters into the world of 

2556
01:49:00,241 --> 01:49:02,050
politics or something like that.
Like Al Franken.

2557
01:49:02,051 --> 01:49:02,890
Franken.
Yeah.

2558
01:49:02,891 --> 01:49:07,891
That's strange.
But that dude is like a serious 

2559
01:49:07,891 --> 01:49:07,891
historian,
you know,

2560
01:49:07,891 --> 01:49:08,900
like that seems like it's sort of like a
project for him.

2561
01:49:08,901 --> 01:49:10,360
Like he really knows a lot of shit.

2562
01:49:12,270 --> 01:49:14,040
What about our kids?
I don't know.

2563
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:15,120
What about our kids,
man?

2564
01:49:15,150 --> 01:49:18,140
What the fuck is going to happen?
What is going to happen?

2565
01:49:18,170 --> 01:49:19,130
No one knows,
man.

2566
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:23,210
It's a strange world we live in.
It's a strange world.

2567
01:49:23,610 --> 01:49:25,010
That's the weirdest thing.
When you have kids,

2568
01:49:25,011 --> 01:49:30,011
you start wondering like,
how is this little person going to be 

2569
01:49:30,011 --> 01:49:30,011
survive?
How they're gonna?

2570
01:49:30,011 --> 01:49:30,680
How are they going to be happy?

2571
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:34,530
This crazy world and it gets nuttier and
nuttier and more goddamn earthquakes.

2572
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:36,430
You know,
earthquake in Baja,

2573
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,150
Mexico a couple of days.
Big One in Indonesia today.

2574
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:41,130
I mean,
we have an earthquake's everywhere.

2575
01:49:41,140 --> 01:49:42,600
Dude.
It's getting really weird,

2576
01:49:42,780 --> 01:49:43,080
right?

2577
01:49:43,180 --> 01:49:44,110
Yeah.
It's like that.

2578
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:46,900
Whoever opened up the treasure chest 
from Indiana,

2579
01:49:47,230 --> 01:49:48,100
raiders of the lost

2580
01:49:48,100 --> 01:49:48,650
Ark,
you know,

2581
01:49:48,660 --> 01:49:50,370
it seems like some fucked up.
I haven't

2582
01:49:51,170 --> 01:49:56,170
weird how many people want to think that
it's because of like a US government 

2583
01:49:56,170 --> 01:49:57,710
experiments that they're creating 
earthquakes.

2584
01:49:57,850 --> 01:49:59,660
Like how nutty is that?
How it is.

2585
01:49:59,661 --> 01:50:01,400
That idea that the US government is 
like,

2586
01:50:01,401 --> 01:50:06,401
I know that we need to do.
We need to just start causing 

2587
01:50:06,401 --> 01:50:06,401
earthquakes everywhere.
Stupid.

2588
01:50:06,401 --> 01:50:06,520
It's hilarious though.
I mean,

2589
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,950
it's hilarious how many people want to 
believe nobody.

2590
01:50:08,951 --> 01:50:13,951
Shit like that.
When it comes to anything that's 

2591
01:50:13,951 --> 01:50:13,951
happening,
they always want to find someone,

2592
01:50:13,951 --> 01:50:17,150
some human who's pulling the strings in 
some gigantic diabolical scheme,

2593
01:50:17,560 --> 01:50:22,560
you know,
that a diabolical scheme with an 

2594
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:24,970
earthquake machine that just pointing at
it all these third world countries and 

2595
01:50:24,970 --> 01:50:25,670
just fucking people up.
Like how hilarious is that?

2596
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:27,340
What a,
what a,

2597
01:50:27,350 --> 01:50:28,940
a ass way to look at the world.

2598
01:50:30,530 --> 01:50:31,910
No,
I don't think that's what's happening.

2599
01:50:32,120 --> 01:50:35,600
I think that the earth is getting very 
pissed off at us.

2600
01:50:36,050 --> 01:50:36,760
I think,
uh,

2601
01:50:36,810 --> 01:50:38,030
you know,
it's uh,

2602
01:50:38,060 --> 01:50:39,710
it's about time.
It's shaken us off.

2603
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:42,110
No,
not really consciously,

2604
01:50:42,111 --> 01:50:44,270
but I think surely like this just 
happens,

2605
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:45,190
you know?
I mean,

2606
01:50:45,200 --> 01:50:50,200
look at what's going on in the moon.
There's creators all over the moon and 

2607
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:50,200
that nobody ever did anything bad on the
moon.

2608
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:52,220
The moon is just a,
another little planet.

2609
01:50:52,250 --> 01:50:54,650
Shit happens.
Volcanoes erupt all over the world.

2610
01:50:54,890 --> 01:50:56,640
Earthquakes happen.
You know,

2611
01:50:56,690 --> 01:51:00,380
the topography of lifeless planets 
constantly changes.

2612
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:01,720
You know,
it's a.

2613
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:03,110
is it,
is it

2614
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:07,370
that we're having more earthquakes right
now or is just that we have twitter?

2615
01:51:07,720 --> 01:51:09,720
It could be that too.
Could be that.

2616
01:51:09,780 --> 01:51:10,650
Yeah.
I don't really know,

2617
01:51:10,651 --> 01:51:15,651
to be honest with you.
All I know is what I'm hearing that I'm 

2618
01:51:15,651 --> 01:51:16,110
hearing about them more than I ever 
heard about them before,

2619
01:51:16,111 --> 01:51:18,750
but I've not.
I've done looked at it at all.

2620
01:51:18,810 --> 01:51:22,410
I've done no research.
It does seem like we're hearing about it

2621
01:51:22,411 --> 01:51:24,090
way more than we ever heard about it 
before.

2622
01:51:24,130 --> 01:51:29,130
Yeah.
We also more information pumped through 

2623
01:51:29,130 --> 01:51:29,340
our eyeballs every day we've ever had in
our life.

2624
01:51:29,880 --> 01:51:30,390
Yeah.

2625
01:51:30,750 --> 01:51:34,200
Ten years ago I would only have found 
out on my laser disk player.

2626
01:51:34,940 --> 01:51:35,600
Yeah.

2627
01:51:36,390 --> 01:51:37,350
Well,
you know,

2628
01:51:37,380 --> 01:51:42,380
you would have found out 10 years ago if
it was really big newspaper people will 

2629
01:51:42,380 --> 01:51:46,041
be paid below up my pager.
I found a page of the other day that I 

2630
01:51:46,041 --> 01:51:47,310
used to have that my dog had bitten 
into.

2631
01:51:47,410 --> 01:51:49,560
It's all fucked up.
And Jack Solaris.

2632
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:51,840
Yeah.
I don't know man,

2633
01:51:51,930 --> 01:51:53,430
you know,
I got no answers to that.

2634
01:51:53,431 --> 01:51:54,270
I don't know if it's,
uh,

2635
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,370
it's happening more or just more 
information,

2636
01:51:56,371 --> 01:51:58,560
but there's definitely more information,
that's for sure.

2637
01:51:58,620 --> 01:52:03,620
That's 100 percent.
Whether or not the earthquakes are 

2638
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:04,220
happening more just seems like they are,
man.

2639
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:09,500
Everybody's scared.
I'm about to lose a shitload of viewers.

2640
01:52:09,501 --> 01:52:12,620
Last starts when you know what,
we're about two hours anyway,

2641
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:14,450
and that's why the way we like to end 
it,

2642
01:52:14,451 --> 01:52:16,970
so we'll have one more topic.
Try to end it well,

2643
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:19,070
and then we'll close it off.

2644
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:27,100
Is it weird that you're so into 
conspiracies,

2645
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:29,260
but hate movies that have a twist 
ending?

2646
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:34,410
I hate movies that have a twist ending.
I love fucking movies with good twisty 

2647
01:52:34,410 --> 01:52:38,521
ending that I didn't see comment.
What I don't like is when movies faked 

2648
01:52:38,521 --> 01:52:38,570
me out and they say,
oh,

2649
01:52:38,571 --> 01:52:43,571
it was just a dream that drives me 
bonkers and I'm not really into 

2650
01:52:43,571 --> 01:52:44,780
conspiracies.
I'm into the real concern there.

2651
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:48,770
Real things that people have conspired,
like Enron and you know,

2652
01:52:48,771 --> 01:52:53,771
I mean,
the problem with the whole term 

2653
01:52:53,771 --> 01:52:55,511
conspiracy theory is you bring it up 
like someone saw talks about conspiracy 

2654
01:52:55,511 --> 01:52:56,690
theories and they bring it up.
All the automatically.

2655
01:52:56,720 --> 01:53:01,720
You any rational person,
any thinking person does not want to be 

2656
01:53:01,720 --> 01:53:05,471
associated with conspiracy theories 
because conspiracy theories make you 

2657
01:53:05,471 --> 01:53:07,370
seem like a loon conspiracy theories the
way it's been labeled make,

2658
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:12,400
make it seem like you're a silly 
frivolous person that you believe in 

2659
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:12,400
ridiculous shit.
You know?

2660
01:53:12,850 --> 01:53:13,360
Yeah.
Well,

2661
01:53:13,361 --> 01:53:16,810
I think if you just tag it with the 
conspiracy theory name,

2662
01:53:16,811 --> 01:53:21,220
but I think if you don't believe that 
conspiracies,

2663
01:53:21,221 --> 01:53:26,221
but you think that's an interesting 
approach to an idea or something like 

2664
01:53:26,221 --> 01:53:29,610
like people that just think nine slash 
11 was done by our own government and 

2665
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:30,250
they don't think anything else in the 
and stuff like that.

2666
01:53:30,251 --> 01:53:31,300
That's a.
that's a sick way.

2667
01:53:31,301 --> 01:53:32,380
I think of anything.
You know,

2668
01:53:32,381 --> 01:53:35,100
you should never put all your eggs in 
one basket type

2669
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:37,790
that putting all your eggs in one basket
is a real problem.

2670
01:53:37,800 --> 01:53:39,960
We've talked about that before with our 
friends,

2671
01:53:39,961 --> 01:53:41,580
with,
with certain subjects.

2672
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:45,690
People love for there to be mysteries 
that they can unsolved.

2673
01:53:45,780 --> 01:53:49,410
They love for there to be some hidden 
information that they can unsolved,

2674
01:53:49,440 --> 01:53:51,690
whether it's about nine slash 11 or 
about anything,

2675
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:55,150
but the reality is,
you know,

2676
01:53:55,240 --> 01:53:57,150
unless you like really,
really,

2677
01:53:57,151 --> 01:54:02,151
really researched shit,
most people were just talking out their 

2678
01:54:02,151 --> 01:54:02,970
ass when it comes to subjects and when 
you do start researching shit,

2679
01:54:03,150 --> 01:54:08,150
you realize,
well you can't just blanketly discount 

2680
01:54:08,580 --> 01:54:13,580
or discredit all conspiracy theories 
just because it seems like a ridiculous 

2681
01:54:13,580 --> 01:54:14,100
thing because a lot of them are fucking 
real.

2682
01:54:14,400 --> 01:54:16,440
The Gulf of Tonkin,
the fucking operation.

2683
01:54:16,441 --> 01:54:18,780
Northwoods.
There's a lot of different shit that the

2684
01:54:18,781 --> 01:54:21,510
government has done and different 
companies have done.

2685
01:54:21,511 --> 01:54:23,670
Cigarette companies have conspired to,
you know,

2686
01:54:23,671 --> 01:54:28,671
to,
to hide the facts about tobacco and to 

2687
01:54:28,671 --> 01:54:29,250
make sure that people keep smoking them 
and people were addicted.

2688
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:31,650
This motherfucker's hook,
line and sinker with the cigarettes.

2689
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,230
You're locked in.
How many smoke today?

2690
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:37,050
Three.
Does that drive you bonkers?

2691
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:42,610
Yeah,
because it's relaxing when I smoke a 

2692
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:42,610
cigarette,
but you don't worry about it.

2693
01:54:42,610 --> 01:54:44,150
Every time I smoked a cigarette and my,
my ellipse caught on fire,

2694
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:45,220
then I would hate it.
Well,

2695
01:54:45,240 --> 01:54:46,850
what about like our friend that just 
died,

2696
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:48,560
you know,
stuff like that.

2697
01:54:48,680 --> 01:54:51,030
Thinking about your body just given out 
on you and that doesn't drive me now.

2698
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:53,810
Well I think it does to a point 
definitely.

2699
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,370
But I also think like,
shit,

2700
01:54:55,371 --> 01:54:59,510
I might have skin cancer right now.
I don't even know about it.

2701
01:54:59,511 --> 01:55:04,511
You know,
it's just either think about death all 

2702
01:55:04,511 --> 01:55:04,511
the time.
Are you done?

2703
01:55:04,511 --> 01:55:08,860
So the red band approach is just to live
life capital might be a happy person,

2704
01:55:09,111 --> 01:55:14,111
but everybody else fight your wars and 
do battle and then everyone else that 

2705
01:55:14,111 --> 01:55:16,260
find out that everyone's stressed.
Do you ever

2706
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:18,930
worry about your,
your think rather about not worried,

2707
01:55:18,931 --> 01:55:22,710
but do you ever consider your position 
in this world or do you just try to just

2708
01:55:22,711 --> 01:55:22,920
live?

2709
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:25,790
I don't think about anything like that 
at all.

2710
01:55:26,420 --> 01:55:31,420
Don't think about.
I think about my happiness and that 

2711
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:32,060
that's pretty much what I think about 
making sure that I am.

2712
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:35,090
I'm happy and people are happy around 
me.

2713
01:55:35,480 --> 01:55:39,470
I just wind to be happy person and I 
want my friends to be happy,

2714
01:55:39,590 --> 01:55:44,590
but I do it.
Do I care about any thing else about 

2715
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:44,590
like fucking or anything like

2716
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:44,680
that?
I try not to.

2717
01:55:44,740 --> 01:55:49,740
So when the storm troopers come,
you're just going to pack a bag and run 

2718
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:49,740
to the hills.
Fuck yeah.

2719
01:55:50,790 --> 01:55:52,950
Give a fuck about borders.
They grow in joke.

2720
01:55:53,160 --> 01:55:55,320
It's interesting because people can,
you know,

2721
01:55:55,330 --> 01:55:57,720
you can criticize that.
You can say that's apathy,

2722
01:55:57,870 --> 01:56:02,870
you know,
like this discussion that we had on the 

2723
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:02,870
board,
but I don't think that they're right.

2724
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:03,750
I don't think they're right.
I think at a certain point in time it is

2725
01:56:03,751 --> 01:56:06,510
a foolish notion to try to control a 
corrupt system.

2726
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:08,730
It's a foolish notion.
It really is.

2727
01:56:08,731 --> 01:56:11,520
I could see both sides of it.
I could see people saying,

2728
01:56:11,521 --> 01:56:12,780
well,
if everybody thought that way,

2729
01:56:12,781 --> 01:56:14,100
there'd be no government.
It'd be,

2730
01:56:14,110 --> 01:56:15,240
oh,
this is bullshit.

2731
01:56:15,241 --> 01:56:16,560
You know,
you have to fucking stand up.

2732
01:56:16,561 --> 01:56:19,050
I could see that argument,
but I could also see her respond.

2733
01:56:19,260 --> 01:56:20,070
I see your argument.

2734
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:21,910
I think you're right.
You know,

2735
01:56:22,270 --> 01:56:25,080
like a lot of people are already has 
that same argument.

2736
01:56:25,180 --> 01:56:26,430
He says,
why do I care?

2737
01:56:26,790 --> 01:56:28,410
It's not gonna affect me.
Why do I care?

2738
01:56:28,980 --> 01:56:33,420
And in a certain way it really doesn't,
but in a certain way it does like social

2739
01:56:33,421 --> 01:56:34,470
things,
like you know,

2740
01:56:34,471 --> 01:56:37,020
Obama not going after the medical 
marijuana.

2741
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,760
That's,
that makes a big difference to me.

2742
01:56:38,920 --> 01:56:40,340
You know,
that's big to me.

2743
01:56:41,100 --> 01:56:46,100
Real estate issues like legalizing 
medical marijuana in the state of 

2744
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:50,061
California,
that's something worth fucking voting 

2745
01:56:50,061 --> 01:56:50,061
for.
That was a huge thing.

2746
01:56:50,061 --> 01:56:53,160
That's real.
That's a real issue that got resolved 

2747
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:55,401
and it changed a lot of people's lives 
and it changed the whole climate of 

2748
01:56:55,401 --> 01:56:56,490
California.
People are way more relaxed.

2749
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:58,490
People are way chiller,
you know,

2750
01:56:58,500 --> 01:57:00,540
the access to weed is through the roof.
It's,

2751
01:57:00,541 --> 01:57:03,870
there's never been more access to in 
this country ever than right now.

2752
01:57:04,230 --> 01:57:06,960
That's a real issue that was resolved by
voting.

2753
01:57:07,170 --> 01:57:12,170
So it's almost like state voting,
voting on state issues like that where 

2754
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:13,050
you can actually pick the issue.
Like that's real shit.

2755
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:16,500
That's real.
Local politics seem to be real,

2756
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:21,920
you know,
this is the reason why California is so 

2757
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:21,920
in depth.
We got an actor to be the governor.

2758
01:57:21,920 --> 01:57:23,940
You know,
we went with a dude that seemed like,

2759
01:57:23,941 --> 01:57:28,941
you know,
it was a no nonsense and we took this 

2760
01:57:28,941 --> 01:57:31,641
fucking dude.
We was an action film star and we made 

2761
01:57:31,641 --> 01:57:31,641
him the governor and Shit.
Just hit the fan,

2762
01:57:31,641 --> 01:57:33,030
hit the fan running.
You know,

2763
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:34,800
it's fascinating,
you know,

2764
01:57:34,860 --> 01:57:37,920
because politics are local level seem to
be real.

2765
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:39,870
But politics on a national levels.
Yeah,

2766
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,180
it's not,
it doesn't seem very fucking real.

2767
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:49,280
The end.
That's the end of this podcast 

2768
01:57:49,280 --> 01:57:49,280
gentlemen.
Brian's good for two hours.

2769
01:57:49,940 --> 01:57:51,940
He starts fading.
It needs a,

2770
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:54,660
he needs his coffee in a binky.

2771
01:57:55,960 --> 01:57:59,170
So thank you very much for tuning in,
ladies and gentlemen.

2772
01:57:59,230 --> 01:58:04,230
And uh,
don't you worry about me and Brian and 

2773
01:58:04,230 --> 01:58:06,271
our argument.
I love this little fucker and he loves 

2774
01:58:06,271 --> 01:58:09,001
me too,
which is just trying to make sure that 

2775
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:09,001
the,
um,

2776
01:58:09,001 --> 01:58:09,400
the podcast goes,
well,

2777
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:10,900
that's all it is.
There's no hate.

2778
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:14,230
We've been friends for ages,
a thank you for everything.

2779
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:19,890
We will see you guys next week.
I got to go to Abu Dhabi this week for 

2780
01:58:19,890 --> 01:58:19,890
the UFC.
That shit's gonna be crazy.

2781
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:22,750
I never been to the United Arab Emirates
before,

2782
01:58:22,751 --> 01:58:27,751
but she'd be fascinating.
I'll have some pictures and for sure 

2783
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:27,751
I'll have some stories.
Definitely.

2784
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:29,470
And I'll see you bitches next week.
So,

2785
01:58:29,471 --> 01:58:31,530
uh,
thank you very much for tuning in.

2787
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:37,720
followers and he's very,
very upset about that.

2788
01:58:37,930 --> 01:58:40,420
He's a red band,
Reb,

2789
01:58:40,421 --> 01:58:42,210
b a n and uh,

2790
01:58:42,460 --> 01:58:43,760
he's very upset about your twitter.
Okay.

2791
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:46,210
How many Ab right now?
Actually,

2792
01:58:46,211 --> 01:58:51,211
I just got like 100 recent.
I don't know if it's because of the DVD 

2793
01:58:51,211 --> 01:58:51,211
or what.

2794
01:58:51,211 --> 01:58:51,770
Oh,
is it on the DVD as well?

2795
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,030
Well,
my website's on the DVD or my name right

2796
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,580
there you go.
But shows,

2797
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:59,020
maybe it is because of that.
So right now Brian is a,

2798
01:58:59,060 --> 01:58:59,480
let's see,

2799
01:58:59,570 --> 01:59:02,950
I think it's like 1500.
I think I just went today.

2800
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:05,510
I'm so close to 100,
$3,000.

2801
01:59:05,530 --> 01:59:10,530
Oh so close like 65 away.
It's hard to get a new twitter 

2802
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:11,200
followers,
you know,

2803
01:59:11,590 --> 01:59:12,970
it's like,
I don't know exactly what.

2804
01:59:12,971 --> 01:59:15,940
You got to mention it everywhere and 
you've got to tweet a lot of interesting

2805
01:59:15,941 --> 01:59:17,110
shit.
But once you do,

2806
01:59:17,111 --> 01:59:18,310
man,
it's so important,

2807
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:22,660
like for prefer promoting gigs and for 
letting people know like shit,

2808
01:59:22,661 --> 01:59:23,560
you're doing like,
Hey,

2809
01:59:23,561 --> 01:59:26,680
I'm going to be in this town like this.
The best way for people to find out what

2810
01:59:26,681 --> 01:59:27,680
you're doing,
you know,

2811
01:59:27,730 --> 01:59:29,710
there's no better way to promote things,
you know,

2812
01:59:30,070 --> 01:59:31,810
and who knows what the next stage of 
that is,

2813
01:59:31,870 --> 01:59:33,840
easily consumable,
easily consumed.

2814
01:59:33,910 --> 01:59:36,040
But Ladies and gentlemen,
this is easily consumable.

2815
01:59:36,041 --> 01:59:41,041
I hope you enjoy this.
This is the end of this week's Ustream 

2816
01:59:41,041 --> 01:59:41,920
podcast,
and we will see you next week.

2817
01:59:42,010 --> 01:59:42,790
Thank you.
Love you.

2818
01:59:42,791 --> 01:59:43,000
Bye.
