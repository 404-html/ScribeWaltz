1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,303
Clay,

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,240
Joey telling shit stories for sure.

3
00:00:06,241 --> 00:00:07,980
And he told us about when he shit,

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,380
uh,

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:10,190
in his backyard and somebody
thought it was a bear.

6
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,930
She will let her dogs out every day until

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,650
I took a shit and I put
my back against the wall.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,360
When you shit outside,

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:29,070
it's not going to be a decent shit.

10
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:30,720
It's going to be like explosive.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,470
So when I got up,

12
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:33,930
but it looks like somebody
got shot in the head,

13
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:34,401
they,

14
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:35,490
we shut off behind me.

15
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,640
So she's sitting there
with French poodles,

16
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,990
Chihuahuas and she's looking at the
wall like what the fuck happened?

17
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:47,991
Then all of a sudden she actually walks
up close to it squints and looks and

18
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,880
looks around and runs in the house.

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,350
I'm watching all this,

20
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,273
I can't breathe.

21
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,640
And now I go into the computer
cause my wife's very decent.

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,620
I'm sitting there for half
and then my wife comes in,

23
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:00,931
she goes,

24
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:02,160
where are you home all day today?

25
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,511
I go,

26
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:03,781
yeah,

27
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:04,010
why?

28
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:04,240
She goes,

29
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,940
I just had a conversation with Susan.

30
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,370
She wanted to know if you
heard anything in the backyard.

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,310
I want to get Sushi,

32
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,130
but give it a go get Sushi.

33
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:19,964
I eat a lot of it.

34
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,690
The rice pushes everything.

35
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,980
I had plans to go get it.

36
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:24,661
A weed store.

37
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:25,740
You want to go to post office.

38
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,120
But I made a detour.

39
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,050
I plan to go home,

40
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:31,590
but I left the house key in the house
so I had to climb around the window.

41
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,281
That's what happened.

42
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:32,440
Yeah.

43
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:32,850
Yeah.

44
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,230
When I pulled myself up,

45
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,830
I actually landed with my stomach on the
window and that you really made it push

46
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,150
it out more like,

47
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,270
and I sign it and fuck and my
hands are struggling in the window

48
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,340
and the cat's scratching at me.

49
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:50,850
Right.

50
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,481
And I might get you,

51
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,330
me your fuck.

52
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,360
Sorry.

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,991
Ran Out.

54
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:56,100
Ran down the stairs.

55
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,090
Oh shit outside.
