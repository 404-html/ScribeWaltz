1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,903
Shy,
yeah,

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:05,830
we feel professional with headsets on 
and we're live.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,100
Welcome back Louis.
Yeah,

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,680
thanks.
Nice to be back.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,893
Uh,
I was saying before the podcast started 

6
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:14,860
that you sent me down a scientology 
rabbit hole last night,

7
00:00:14,861 --> 00:00:16,510
my friend.
I've been down those before,

8
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,560
but last night knowing that you were 
going to be on and looking forward to it

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,290
eagerly.
I uh,

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,700
I watched a lot of stuff.

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,540
Uh,
and you know,

12
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,950
I spent three years down the rabbit hole
and a,

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,633
it's a weird one.
So when were you on the Internet where 

14
00:00:33,531 --> 00:00:34,940
you just clicking around?
Yeah,

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,210
just on Youtube,
but there's various very,

16
00:00:38,211 --> 00:00:42,320
very well resourced websites.
There's one called clam bake.

17
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,640
I've been to that one.
Yeah.

18
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,070
And then there's all the Tony Ortega 
stuff.

19
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,110
I mean there's just,
there's just whole worlds.

20
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:48,944
And actually,
I mean I know there's a lot to talk 

21
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:51,254
about,
but perhaps the biggest obstacle to 

22
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:57,980
making a documentary about scientology 
is the over abundance of material,

23
00:00:59,080 --> 00:00:59,913
you know,
because there's just so many ways to 

24
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:02,354
come in on it.
And if you could just chase intriguing 

25
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,380
leads and then months go by and you're 
known narrative filming it.

26
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,560
I had a lot of thoughts on this and one 
of the thoughts when I was really trying

27
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:17,561
to unpack it all is that I feel like one
of the reasons why a lot of these people

28
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:20,600
defend scientology there,
I think there's several reasons.

29
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:21,434
One,
because it's their team and once you 

30
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,223
become a part of a team,
it becomes something that you identify 

31
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:27,920
with,
becomes very important to you.

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,200
And then you want to,
you want to defend that.

33
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,303
So I think there's that.
But also I think some people take some 

34
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:40,730
benefit in what l Ron Hubbard created 
because,

35
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:41,630
uh,
if you,

36
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:43,040
uh,
if you read going clear.

37
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,080
Yes,
when I read going clear,

38
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,914
I watched the documentary and then I 
read the book and one of the things it 

39
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,224
was more fascinating about the book was 
the fact that he was essentially trying 

40
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,840
to diagnose and treat himself.

41
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,890
And he was essentially a really nutty 
guy.

42
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,080
You was very damaged.
Yeah.

43
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:01,850
He,
he had a lot going on.

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,013
And um,
he was a guy who was trying to sort of 

45
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:08,114
sort it out himself and in the process 
brought a lot of people in and then 

46
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:17,060
created this thing and some people they 
get some benefit from this thing because

47
00:02:17,061 --> 00:02:19,520
like I was watching like some of these 
people that are upset with you,

48
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:20,354
like that woman or that there was a 
trailer where this woman was upset at 

49
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:25,940
you because you were in.
I haven't seen the documentary yet.

50
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:28,670
It comes out in America in January.
Um,

51
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,870
but you were on a road,
you had a permit for and she was telling

52
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:34,100
you,
you are on private land.

53
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,080
And I'm looking at this woman.
I'm like,

54
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,180
this is,
it seems like a reasonable,

55
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,650
intelligent,
assertive,

56
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:43,040
confident woman that would probably,
if she didn't get into scientology,

57
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,030
she would have been successful in the 
corporate world I'm sure.

58
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,283
But here she is.
Her Corporation is written by a nutty 

59
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:53,234
science fiction writer who wrote more 
fiction than any human has ever walked 

60
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:00,050
the face of the planet.
He,

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,113
he made up more shit.
He wrote down more things that never 

62
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:08,220
happened than anyone who's ever lived.
And they don't have a problem with that.

63
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,400
They're like,
I mean,

64
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:14,050
you've said about 10 different things 
that I could break down and analyze.

65
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:15,820
I mean,
I basically on the same page as you.

66
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,654
I think that's the first thing to 
acknowledge about scientology is that 

67
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:24,241
it's a religion and that all religions 
have a very high portion of,

68
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,430
um,
you know,

69
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,960
to try to put it politely,
but just bogus,

70
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,390
fallacious,
clearly nonsensical material.

71
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,400
Right?
In scientology is,

72
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,130
is,
is,

73
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,530
uh,
is the same as all of those.

74
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,543
I think there's a lot of people who've 
had derived a lot of benefit from 

75
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:40,660
scientology.
I think people probably.

76
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,530
There's people whose lives have been 
saved by it.

77
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:45,960
Kirstie Alley,
we'll say at any opportunity that it was

78
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,860
scientology that got her off drugs.

79
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,730
But I think a lot you have to sorta take
the whole package.

80
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,100
And we,
as far as Hubbard goes,

81
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,140
he was an only child.
He was a fantasy,

82
00:03:56,141 --> 00:04:00,040
just a lonely guy who was also a 
narcissist.

83
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:01,760
And I think as a writer,
I mean,

84
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,633
you can't.
One of the things in treatments about 

85
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:05,890
scientology is created by Scifi writer,
right?

86
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,250
There's not,
most other religions are created by sort

87
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,610
of desert mystics or mores or people 
introspective people,

88
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:13,444
but a modern day Scifi writer who's 
writing things about aliens taking over 

89
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:21,100
foreign galaxies.
That's really that it accounts for a lot

90
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:22,210
of.
It's um,

91
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,940
it's very bizarre inflection.
Do you know what I mean?

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,511
Yeah.
Well,

93
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:26,344
not only that,
I don't think he wrote a second draft 

94
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,660
ever.
No,

95
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,330
he didn't have time.
He was just sending it out.

96
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,490
I think a lot of the stuff that they say
he wrote,

97
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:34,324
he didn't write like because he was 
married three times and at least one of 

98
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,950
his wives took credit for writing some 
of his stuff.

99
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,903
I think even some stuff of scientology 
may be written by a second wife who we 

100
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:43,834
then,
he subsequently disavowed said he was 

101
00:04:45,131 --> 00:04:47,320
never married to,
but I'm,

102
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,880
the guy was a,
he,

103
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,560
he lied about so many things.
He was also abusive to his wife.

104
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,180
Wives,
I think plural.

105
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,100
So physically he,
he,

106
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,993
he was,
um,

107
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,040
abusive to them.
He was very,

108
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:00,874
very troubled and suicidal.
One of the most intriguing things in 

109
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:06,090
going clear is reading this list of,
uh,

110
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,053
I think they call them affirmations,
which when he was in after the Second 

111
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,190
World War,
he was right with self doubt.

112
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,293
He thought it was a failure.
He was embarrassed about his sexual 

113
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:16,300
urgency,
urgency's,

114
00:05:16,301 --> 00:05:19,240
compulsive masturbation and so on and so
forth.

115
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,930
And he wrote down a list of things.
Do you remember this section of it where

116
00:05:22,931 --> 00:05:27,931
it says you do not feel compelled to 
mass conveyed 24 times a day?

117
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,130
It's not literally everything,
right?

118
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,680
You are.
You were not a disgrace to the military.

119
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,870
You were,
you acquitted your service in the navy,

120
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,033
very creditably.
It was all these sort of lies he was 

121
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,434
telling himself to reassure himself that
he was actually to feel okay about 

122
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:43,564
himself.
It's a very humanizing document because 

123
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:46,534
you just see all his neurotic 
inclinations laid bare that then 

124
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:54,520
subsequently informed his lifelong 
attempt to,

125
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,980
as you say,
sort of therapeutically healing himself.

126
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,100
And I think

127
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:03,100
there's other people that identify with 
those self sort of damaged thoughts,

128
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,980
these thoughts where they don't like 
their past.

129
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,140
They don't like who they are.
They don't like the pattern that they're

130
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,974
on and they seek to try to change that 
and improve upon their position and 

131
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,090
improve upon their,
their understanding and their acceptance

132
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:20,930
of themselves and I think that's where 
scientology does benefit a lot of people

133
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,960
and so it is tricky like many things in 
this life.

134
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:27,590
It's not that black and white,
I mean is it black and white that it's a

135
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,230
cult and that there's a lot of damaging 
aspects of that?

136
00:06:30,231 --> 00:06:31,370
Yes,
absolutely.

137
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,353
It's pretty clear when you see the 
people that have tried to leave it and 

138
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:35,750
you know,
and,

139
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,980
and tell the truth about their 
experiences in it and what,

140
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,820
how they've been harassed and hounded 
and yeah,

141
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:41,654
that's all pretty black and white,
but I think we can in some ways we can 

142
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:49,190
sympathize with some of the people that 
are in it.

143
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,330
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

144
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,183
I mean,
but the other thing to say is because 

145
00:06:53,491 --> 00:06:54,324
you started by asking what was it that 
made some people defend scientology and 

146
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,334
is it loyalty to the team?
But I also think that I'm on the outer 

147
00:07:03,511 --> 00:07:06,150
periphery.
There are concentric rings of commitment

148
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,070
to scientology and in the,
in a,

149
00:07:08,071 --> 00:07:08,904
in a circle,
it is extremely demanding and I would 

150
00:07:13,561 --> 00:07:16,710
argue abusive and uh,
and,

151
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,850
and cult like on the outer circles as 
you get further from the center,

152
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,773
I think it can be relatively benign and 
especially if you're a vip or a 

153
00:07:25,231 --> 00:07:26,064
celebrity in which you're exposed only 
to the best sorts of treatment you're 

154
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,240
given kind of platinum card treatment,
you go to the celebrity center,

155
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,283
they rolled out the red carpet for you.
And I think those people feel immensely 

156
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:38,214
indebted to scientology.
I think that explains a lot about Tom 

157
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:41,933
Cruise,
that he's only ever been treated like a 

158
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:46,940
prince when he's been in scientology.
So he,

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,590
he,
he feels so grateful for everything that

160
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:50,460
they've done for him.

161
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:53,360
Yeah,
I think his experience when,

162
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,020
when he talks about them,
if he's being honest,

163
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,990
I mean if,
if everyone had that experience,

164
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:01,630
scientology would be amazing.
You know,

165
00:08:01,631 --> 00:08:02,464
when you see him,
when they had the happy birthday thing 

166
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:06,460
for him and he's dancing and everybody's
cheering,

167
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,850
like imagine if you just people treated 
you like that all the time.

168
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,550
Oh my goodness.
Auditioning actors like female actors to

169
00:08:13,551 --> 00:08:16,460
see if they were going to be your 
girlfriend or did you read that whole,

170
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,393
I mean,
imagine if they rounded up the most 

171
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:21,980
attractive young female actors in 
Hollywood,

172
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,843
uh,
to see whether they would go on a date 

173
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:25,030
with you.
Yeah,

174
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,920
it would make life very simple.
If you weren't married as I am,

175
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,820
would it?
I don't know man.

176
00:08:31,821 --> 00:08:35,570
I mean dealing with a bunch of nutty 
paid through that process.

177
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,404
Yeah.
And actually because it would be like 

178
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:42,740
I'm almost king midas thing where you 
wouldn't trust any of your instincts.

179
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,603
You won't feel as though people were,
were erecting potemkin villages 

180
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,680
everywhere you went.
Do you know what I mean?

181
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,180
Nothing would feel quite real.

182
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,040
That's a good point.
Also,

183
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:52,883
like imagine your wife today.
If you found out that your wife today 

184
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,010
was one

185
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,860
of the people that had auditioned to be 
Tom Cruise's wife.

186
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,753
I mean if you don't make the cut,
you're damaged goods for the rest of 

187
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,270
your life.
That's interesting too.

188
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,104
You're a nutty broad who is willing to 
go and sign up to become Tom Cruise's 

189
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,360
new wife.
Well,

190
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:10,194
to be fair,
they didn't know that was the job they 

191
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:13,230
were going in to be fair.
Yeah,

192
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,410
that's true.
So,

193
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,244
so just being,
they just thought they were up for some 

194
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,980
Gig,
do you know what I mean?

195
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,470
Maybe a Sitcom was essentially they 
were.

196
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,210
And then there's also all of the 
difficult things get screwed around with

197
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,130
the scientology treatment of 
homosexuals.

198
00:09:32,131 --> 00:09:37,131
Were they sort of shield them from the 
press or hide their activity and sort of

199
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,350
you don't want a beard is.
I do,

200
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,900
yeah.
They hire beards,

201
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,011
you know,
that's,

202
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:44,844
I mean that's a great point.
And I think actually that's another one 

203
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:47,930
that,
you know,

204
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,200
I guess we've,
you know,

205
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,290
we as a society have evolved a lot over 
the last 50 years to some extent.

206
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,040
Hubbard was a creature of his times in 
his attitudes towards homosexuality.

207
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:59,430
The trouble is because they're saying 
it's a religion that's been enshrined as

208
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,870
scripture.
And so there are,

209
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,340
there are,
there is l,

210
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:07,341
Ron Hubbard scripture that dictates that
homosexuals are perverts.

211
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,120
They're one point one on the tone scale,
which is the same as John List's,

212
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,470
oddly enough,
but it's very,

213
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:14,640
very low.
Basically,

214
00:10:14,641 --> 00:10:16,930
you are kind of broken,
deceitful,

215
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,590
a devious character.
Journalists are one point,

216
00:10:19,591 --> 00:10:21,470
one of the tone,
same as us,

217
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:23,100
but,
and that she,

218
00:10:23,101 --> 00:10:25,490
I think quite explicitly,
explicitly.

219
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,483
I mean,
I could go down and that explains a lot 

220
00:10:27,331 --> 00:10:30,810
about why it's so hard to make a 
documentary in practical terms,

221
00:10:30,811 --> 00:10:32,640
why they don't cooperate with 
documentaries.

222
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,830
They just see you as a pervert,
you know,

223
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:37,560
if someone who's dedicated to the,
to the,

224
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,394
uh,
basement of humanity and so someone 

225
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:41,820
who's holding humanity back from being 
what it should be,

226
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:46,850
but that's just incredible that he's 
managed to define journalists under that

227
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,354
category,
the very people that we rely upon to 

228
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:52,600
investigate the truth and,
and,

229
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,930
and express that truth.

230
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,793
Thanks.
Disseminate that true to the general 

231
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,220
public.
Those people are perverts and,

232
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,570
and um,
yeah,

233
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,490
and that scripture as well,
you know what I mean?

234
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:03,324
So,
so it's not like you can argue against 

235
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,664
it until,
I mean one of the big things they're up 

236
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:10,620
against is any attempt,
most,

237
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,190
uh,
kind of malfunctioning regimes,

238
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:16,520
whether it's a corporate entity or 
something else.

239
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,030
You say,
this isn't working,

240
00:11:18,031 --> 00:11:21,270
let's try something else.
So much of what happened in scientology,

241
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:24,750
this was explained to me by one of our 
sources in the in the film,

242
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,050
I'm a guy called Marty Rathman,
who was very high up in scientology.

243
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:31,470
He said something could be working 
extremely badly inside scientology,

244
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:35,190
but if it came out of Hubbard,
then you couldn't really change it.

245
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,350
Hubbard apparently once said,
oh,

246
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,230
the best way to wash windows is using 
vinegar.

247
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,150
Don't use windex,
use vinegar,

248
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:42,984
and because of that,
whenever they washed windows in the sea 

249
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:46,770
org and the inner sanctums of 
Scientology,

250
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:50,490
they had to use vinegar because Hubbard 
said that was how you was supposed to do

251
00:11:50,491 --> 00:11:53,950
it and nothing can be changed.
It's a bit like Mormons.

252
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,630
I mean now Mormons,
I don't know how they got rid of.

253
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,490
They say that you don't have to be 
polygamous,

254
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,370
but so it's like turning an aircraft 
carrier around.

255
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:03,220
If it comes from basically,
if it's Gospel,

256
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,460
then how do you,
how do you refer,

257
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,650
you know,
God's changed his mind is basically what

258
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:09,910
you have to say.
Well,

259
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:10,744
that is the real problem with religion 
because we all recognize that no one 

260
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:18,460
person has ultimate truth and especially
when you're just going through this life

261
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:19,294
trying to figure out yourself,
trying to figure out what is this all 

262
00:12:21,431 --> 00:12:22,264
about,
this strange spinning ball that's 

263
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:28,000
floating in the sky and were hurling 
through infinity and what is the purpose

264
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:28,834
of this existence?
And there's a lot of open ended 

265
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,414
questions that never have any answers.
So when someone comes along and they 

266
00:12:34,991 --> 00:12:38,860
have this rigid ideology where things 
are very clearly defined,

267
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:42,310
you must ask who is defining these 
things?

268
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,233
Who is this person that is beyond 
reproach and when that person is a 

269
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:47,284
yellow tooth weirdo that's dressed like 
a captain with some medals that he put 

270
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:52,114
himself on his own jacket and he's a 
science fiction author who wrote more 

271
00:12:57,071 --> 00:13:00,280
bullshit than any human beings ever and 
wrote bad books.

272
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,930
I mean,
he's a bad writer.

273
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,060
I've only,
I haven't read any of it.

274
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,690
I've read,
I've tried to read dianetics uh,

275
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,150
several times.
It's almost unreadable in my view.

276
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,133
Have you tried to make Diana bought 
dianetics once a late night before the 

277
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:17,050
Internet?
There was a late night infomercial.

278
00:13:17,051 --> 00:13:17,884
I've always been a person who's really 
in a self help and psychology because I 

279
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,023
was,
I've always tried to figure out like 

280
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:28,120
what is it about why,
why do people sabotage themselves,

281
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:31,990
why do I get lazy,
why do I not fulfill some of my goals?

282
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,093
And so I really got into like Anthony 
Robbins and I got into a lot of 

283
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,333
psychology books and self help books and
one night I was at home and I was 

284
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:42,220
watching this commercial for dianetics,
so I said,

285
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,450
all right,
I'm going to call this.

286
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,110
And I called and I guess I gave my 
credit card number or whatever it was.

287
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,080
And this is while you were an actor at 
this point?

288
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,940
I was working at quite successful.
Yeah,

289
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,200
I mean they wouldn't.
Okay.

290
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:55,120
If they saw you coming,
they would have.

291
00:13:55,121 --> 00:13:57,670
Absolutely.
That would have made their year.

292
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,810
Well,
I never went in.

293
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,060
I've never went there,
but I did in the future.

294
00:14:01,061 --> 00:14:03,280
I did do the meter thing,
but that was way later.

295
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,233
So this is like 1994 when I first came 
to Hollywood and I was alone in my 

296
00:14:08,231 --> 00:14:09,064
apartment in north Hollywood pop,
probably lonely trying to figure things 

297
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:14,140
out and just got here by buy this 
fucking thing.

298
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,333
Those people sent me pamphlets and 
paperwork and an invitation to seminars 

299
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:24,220
and this thing and that thing for a 
decade.

300
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:26,110
I mean,
it just never ended.

301
00:14:26,111 --> 00:14:28,540
It was like weekly,
monthly,

302
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,930
constant.
This.

303
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:32,680
They're very,
very relentless in their pursuit.

304
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,560
And if you looked at what their 
pamphlets were saying,

305
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,040
it was all really reasonable enticing 
stuff.

306
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:42,730
It was all about improving yourself is 
all about fulfilling your goals,

307
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:43,564
eliminating negative thoughts,
eliminated other people's negative 

308
00:14:45,941 --> 00:14:48,160
thoughts that are influencing the way 
you view your life.

309
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,170
Eliminating the,
uh,

310
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,163
effect of past experiences that were 
negative and that may have defined you 

311
00:14:54,621 --> 00:14:55,454
in some way.

312
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:56,443
Yeah,
all of that.

313
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,770
But that's basically Freud basically.
Yeah.

314
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,273
It's Freud with a lie detector hooked up
to a lie detector that in essence is 

315
00:15:06,301 --> 00:15:08,940
auditing.
The problem is when you read dianetics,

316
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,370
you realize how loopy it is in my view 
at.

317
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,520
And in fact,
it,

318
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,000
because some times,
and I,

319
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,843
I,
I praise this sort of skeptical minded 

320
00:15:17,581 --> 00:15:19,200
approach where people say,
well,

321
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,790
what's your problem with scientology?
You know,

322
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:23,190
all religions are Kooky.
But the fact is,

323
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:27,570
is just exhibit a is just read dianetics
if you read the Bible,

324
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:28,404
it's got loony stuff in it,
but it's got passages of transcendent 

325
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,003
poetry and,
and just parables that you could 

326
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:36,510
meditate on and a beautifully written 
in,

327
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,750
in the translated English,
um,

328
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,073
you read dianetics and it's just 
childish stuff about literally things 

329
00:15:44,101 --> 00:15:45,000
about,
Oh,

330
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:49,200
a lot of your problems may be because 
when you were in Utero as a fetus,

331
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,660
your father try to,
uh,

332
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,620
uh,
bought you,

333
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,240
your father,
tried to abort the fetus are,

334
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,500
and you can still remember that and 
that's holding you back.

335
00:15:58,501 --> 00:15:59,334
And at the same time a record was 
playing and every time you hear that 

336
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:02,964
record,
it's sort of this sort of Pavlov mixed 

337
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:09,570
with really weird.
I'm totally unscientific ideas.

338
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,200
And,
and then it expands to past lives.

339
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,190
So it's traumas or bad memories from 
previous lifetimes.

340
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,290
And at that point I was just like,
I'm not on this ship.

341
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,210
I was not a before but even more.
It's,

342
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:24,400
it's hard to be honest,

343
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,233
I think,
but that's what we were saying earlier 

344
00:16:26,621 --> 00:16:27,454
about rigid ideologies that rigid 
ideologies are always problematic 

345
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:34,180
because there's so many open ended 
questions when it comes to being a human

346
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:36,970
being on earth.
And that is a problem with religions.

347
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:37,804
And that was one of the things that 
religions do by creating these rigid 

348
00:16:41,441 --> 00:16:42,274
ideologies is they make things so that 
you don't have to question stuff and 

349
00:16:45,341 --> 00:16:46,174
that gives some people comfort if you 
know that these are the rules and you 

350
00:16:48,851 --> 00:16:53,140
don't have to think about why 
homosexuality is bad or why,

351
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,060
you know,
fill in the blank,

352
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:56,590
whatever the,
whatever the issue is.

353
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,460
When someone defines something like that
for you,

354
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,640
it makes it so you have less questions 
and you have comfort in these truths,

355
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,210
you know,
air quotes.

356
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,630
Um,
but that's not good for anybody.

357
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:11,583
So it's bad for everyone involved 
because there are some things that I 

358
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:20,701
think we've all learned a be nice to 
people and it feels better to them.

359
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,873
Feels better to you.
You have a healthier existence when you 

360
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:25,294
have harmony with your neighbors and 
when you can create a good community of 

361
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,670
people that are being harmonious 
together and friendly together.

362
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:32,440
It's a really nice place to live.
Those are pretty.

363
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:34,750
That's a pretty much a universal truth.
You know,

364
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:35,584
there's a bunch of those that exist,
but even those can be debated and 

365
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:39,910
discussed and you know,
you find,

366
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,163
you know,
wha various approaches to the end goal 

367
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,850
of,
of happiness.

368
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,940
Whenever you have someone who wrote

369
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,143
a bunch of Wacky Shit like this and then
you have seemingly intelligent people 

370
00:17:54,451 --> 00:17:55,284
defending it.
Like that woman that we were discussing 

371
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,480
when that woman was,
she did not seem stupid at all.

372
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,653
No,
I'm sure she will reliably informed 

373
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:05,274
because in the,
in the film we go off and meet her ex 

374
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:07,764
husband who's now no longer in 
scientology and he describes her as a 

375
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,840
very sensitive,
caring person.

376
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,150
A lot of the assertiveness.
She,

377
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:16,200
she,
she shows,

378
00:18:16,201 --> 00:18:20,380
I think she probably acquired through a 
scientology and and and,

379
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,233
and a lot of scientology training in 
terms of what it imparts to people is a 

380
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,840
quality of being,
direct,

381
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:29,460
being assertive,
being confident,

382
00:18:29,461 --> 00:18:33,570
being in charge and being okay with sort
of dominating the situations that you're

383
00:18:33,571 --> 00:18:34,404
in.
It's one of the reasons that I think it 

384
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:38,700
appeals a lot to actors because it,
it,

385
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,680
it,
it works.

386
00:18:40,681 --> 00:18:41,514
I think for people who have any sort of 
insecurity or who are going into 

387
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:44,424
situations of uncertainty and it allows 
you to almost reprogramming your 

388
00:18:48,781 --> 00:18:53,781
circuits in some way and be okay about 
using assertive body language and speech

389
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,543
and it also imparts a sense that you 
have all the traits necessary to save 

390
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:01,200
humanity from itself.

391
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,393
Not just humanity on earth but 
throughout a time and space and it is 

392
00:19:06,001 --> 00:19:09,480
your obligation to ensure that those 
truths are saved,

393
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,373
saved for posterity,
and communicated as widely as possible 

394
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,063
in a totally unadulterated fashion.
Because any adulteration of the message 

395
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,440
means that not only do they not work,
they become toxic and dangerous.

396
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,693
It seems to me that there's a bunch of 
things going on and that there's some 

397
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:28,614
aspects of it that maybe could be 
beneficial that they could extract from 

398
00:19:32,311 --> 00:19:33,144
that.
Almost like these people that have 

399
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:37,530
abandoned scientology can start 
scientology lights.

400
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,161
Well,
they do.

401
00:19:38,161 --> 00:19:39,450
They are doing that.
Are they?

402
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,373
Yeah.
But one of the funny things is once you 

403
00:19:42,421 --> 00:19:43,254
have scientology light,
it's called the indie movement 

404
00:19:44,911 --> 00:19:45,744
independent scientology,
and it's often make an analogy is made 

405
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:51,870
with Martin Luther and protestantism.
You know,

406
00:19:51,871 --> 00:19:53,670
when,
you know,

407
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,651
people said,
you know,

408
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,484
the,
there's nothing in the Bible about the 

409
00:19:56,101 --> 00:19:56,760
papacy.

410
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,593
Really.
There's nothing about selling 

411
00:19:58,711 --> 00:20:02,100
indulgences and having palaces in Rome 
and the Vatican.

412
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,173
So actually really there's just stuff in
the Bible about following Jesus and 

413
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:10,320
reading the Bible.
So shouldn't that be what we were doing?

414
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:12,090
And so they go off.
You have protestantism.

415
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:15,000
The trouble with the independent 
movement is,

416
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,980
um,
it turns out that if you remove the,

417
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,560
the raw predatory money raising side and
the,

418
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,500
and the sort of fundamentalist 
controlling side,

419
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,693
you get something a bit wishy washy 
that's more or less indistinguishable 

420
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:34,881
from many other self help creates,
it sort of loses its potency.

421
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,700
It's almost that the,
the authoritarian dimension of,

422
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,000
uh,
of the,

423
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,893
of scientology and the way in which your
demands total obedience from its 

424
00:20:43,651 --> 00:20:48,580
followers is intrinsic to its ability to
have an effect that's fascinating.

425
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:49,973
Um,
people do in some some way gravitate 

426
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,190
towards discipline and um,
that you see that in the military,

427
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,340
like the benefit of.
So.

428
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,080
Yes sir.
No Sir.

429
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,560
That's one of the things I talk about in
the film is,

430
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,320
I mean we talked as well about the 
appeal of scientology.

431
00:21:05,321 --> 00:21:07,870
Why do people defend it?
So it works for some people.

432
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,110
I think there's an obvious thing if the 
thin end of the wedge,

433
00:21:11,111 --> 00:21:13,990
you know,
you get in knee deep and then you think,

434
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:16,840
well I've come in this far.
So even though I've got doubts,

435
00:21:16,841 --> 00:21:17,674
I got a little further.
And then you sort of reach a tipping 

436
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,410
point of commitment where it becomes 
almost embarrassing to back out.

437
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,473
You're sort of $100,000 or more in your 
10 years in your family is annoyed with 

438
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:30,431
you.
A lot of them,

439
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:31,740
you don't see you,
you read this.

440
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,540
It's very hard to walk away from that 
commitment.

441
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,803
Uh,
so there's,

442
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:39,970
there's all these powerful.
I'm really compelling reasons for why.

443
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,920
But the,
the other part of it is,

444
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,933
and this is the part that I as an 
outsider appreciate and I own up to in 

445
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:49,060
the film,
is that there's something grandiose.

446
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,740
It's a bit like trump,
right?

447
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:56,170
You see these gilded casinos,
you see these towering shiny buildings,

448
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,570
you know,
they kind of over the top and grotesque,

449
00:21:58,571 --> 00:22:01,030
but they're also sort of majestic and 
imperial.

450
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,670
And if you ever watched scientology 
footage,

451
00:22:03,671 --> 00:22:04,504
there's,
some of it's on youtube and you see how 

452
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,400
they are very good at a certain kind of.
I'm over the top aesthetic.

453
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,940
Do you know what I mean?
Almost a kind of re Leni Riefenstahl ask

454
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,183
'em with lights and flaming Brazier's 
and thousands of people surging up with 

455
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,790
in unison.
And it has an effect,

456
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:25,481
you sort of think,
wow,

457
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:28,860
these guys know how to run a show.
If you go into any org,

458
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,703
have you been into an.
They call them all because when the 

459
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,410
organization.
Okay,

460
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,930
so near where I'm staying in Los Felix,
there's one,

461
00:22:34,931 --> 00:22:35,764
it's on Hillhurst I think,
and you go in and it feels like you're 

462
00:22:38,711 --> 00:22:42,670
kind of in a religious library,
sorta,

463
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,760
sorta designed by jp two man,
you know,

464
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:46,594
that like the catalog company and it had
sort of old globes and kind of 

465
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,860
distressed wooden furniture and,
and wicker chairs and it feels like it's

466
00:22:53,861 --> 00:22:57,580
kind of like slightly colonial golden 
age of exploration feel.

467
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,860
I know what I mean.
And it feels very,

468
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:00,694
it feels very sort of swept up in this 
narrative of we're in a place where 

469
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,650
there's adventure and,
and,

470
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:06,460
and,
and,

471
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,760
and in a certain sense of order and,
and,

472
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:11,710
and actually this sort of seductive 
quality to it.

473
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,600
Yeah.
There's a seductive quality to it.

474
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:13,770
A lot of

475
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:14,850
religions.
Oh yeah.

476
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,684
I find a seductive quality to people 
that are very confident in what they're 

477
00:23:18,181 --> 00:23:19,014
saying and this,
this ultimate truth that they're 

478
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:23,250
espousing.
And um,

479
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,353
I went to the Vatican recently and one 
of the things that was really apparent 

480
00:23:28,381 --> 00:23:32,550
to me was the sheer scale and the,
the vast,

481
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:38,780
the size of St Peter's not Saint Peter's
Cathedral.

482
00:23:39,391 --> 00:23:42,000
It's a school pages,
isn't it?

483
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,531
Yeah.
The basilica.

484
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:44,520
Thank you.
Um,

485
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,130
the,
which was just,

486
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,173
to me the most amazing thing I think 
I've ever seen as far as like a human 

487
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,640
creation,
the most amazing thing I've ever seen in

488
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:55,250
my life other than cheech and eatsa 
other than the Mayan Pyramids.

489
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,503
I was just stunned by the amount of work
in the hundreds of years of work that 

490
00:24:01,131 --> 00:24:03,590
had gone into creating that.
But when you're there,

491
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,753
the overall scale of it is so.
It's so immense that it makes you feel 

492
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,600
pure and it makes you feel small.

493
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:14,690
It makes you feel insignificant in the 
greater picture.

494
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:15,763
And I think that that is a,
that's a big factor with a lot of 

495
00:24:18,351 --> 00:24:19,184
religions,
is to eliminate the power of the 

496
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:26,501
individual by making you feel diminished
by the sheer scale of what you're seeing

497
00:24:27,501 --> 00:24:28,560
and what,
what the,

498
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,020
the,
the hall that you're in.

499
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,330
I'm sure.
I'm sure that's intimidating,

500
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,350
very much so.
Yeah,

501
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,990
and that's one other thing which,
which is,

502
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,040
uh,
you know,

503
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,850
last year on the slightly on the back of
doing the scientology program,

504
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,713
I was trying to,
I was living in the UK and I was trying 

505
00:24:43,851 --> 00:24:44,684
to get a program going about a 
fundamentalist Islam or not even 

506
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:51,800
fundamentalist actually beyond where 
it's extreme radical Islam,

507
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:52,670
so cold,
you know,

508
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,883
uh,
basically people who support isis of 

509
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:55,994
which there are some in the UK,
although they're hard to interview 

510
00:24:58,611 --> 00:25:01,160
because it's actually a crime to,
uh,

511
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,650
to glorify terrorism is what it's 
called.

512
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,590
And so they have to talk very gingerly 
around the subject.

513
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,903
But if you get into a debate about 
someone who is sincerely committed to 

514
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,500
isis brand of Sunni Islam,
right?

515
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,730
Where they're saying,
actually,

516
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,650
yeah,
sex slaves are okay.

517
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,880
They,
they'll say like,

518
00:25:19,881 --> 00:25:22,700
slaves isn't quite the right term,
but we're approved that and blah,

519
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:23,480
blah,
blah.

520
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,950
And then your throat.
They say,

521
00:25:24,951 --> 00:25:25,784
well,
by what authority do you challenge what 

522
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:28,401
we believe?
Right?

523
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,100
When you start coming at them with some 
kind of humanistic,

524
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,820
secular,
liberal sort of view of life and you try

525
00:25:34,821 --> 00:25:35,241
to explain,
well,

526
00:25:35,241 --> 00:25:38,870
I'm not basing my,
I don't have an authority as such,

527
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,381
you know,
like,

528
00:25:39,381 --> 00:25:41,330
I,
I'm not preaching a religion,

529
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,164
I'm just saying,
you know,

530
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,090
it's kind of better to be nice to 
people.

531
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,370
And they said,
but based on what,

532
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:47,204
under what authority that you,
you find that you actually don't really 

533
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:50,654
have,
it's surprisingly difficult when you're 

534
00:25:52,311 --> 00:25:57,311
thrown back on first principles to make 
the case for um,

535
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,500
uh,
sort of sensitive a secular way of doing

536
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,010
things.

537
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,640
Does that make sense?
You know,

538
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,333
one of the appeals of,
I think whether it's scientology or 

539
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:07,650
Islam or,
or,

540
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:08,960
um,
Christianity,

541
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:11,720
Christianity,
whatever form that takes,

542
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,823
they could say like,
we have all our answers there in a book 

543
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,020
and God told us.
And so who told you?

544
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:18,681
And I.
Well,

545
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:23,150
no one told me I'm relying on two 
millennia old tradition,

546
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,800
you know,
founded in,

547
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,880
uh,
you know,

548
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:29,920
Greco Roman times with various people,
you know,

549
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,040
in interpreters over the years.
But actually I,

550
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,980
I,
you know,

551
00:26:33,981 --> 00:26:36,560
I can't really articulate that in 10 
words.

552
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,080
Do you know what I mean?
And it's surprisingly hard.

553
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,680
So once you're in the prison of a faith 
based system,

554
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,390
it's very hard to kind of leverage your 
way out.

555
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,180
I didn't do a good job of trying to get 
them out basically.

556
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,700
Well,
it's very difficult when they say that,

557
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,593
like by what authority and you realize 
you don't have any and they think they 

558
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:54,870
do.

559
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,610
Yeah.
And that's where it gets weird.

560
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,463
And like I don't have a book like 
whatever we call the other way of doing 

561
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:01,350
things,
you know.

562
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,700
And also you don't want to say like,
well,

563
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:03,870
in western trip,
you know,

564
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,540
you're trying not to because whether we 
like it or not,

565
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,374
all our beliefs have a um,
some sort of geographic contemporarily 

566
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:10,663
specificity to them as much as we might 
want to say that there are golden rules 

567
00:27:13,951 --> 00:27:17,130
that exist through time and space.
I don't think there really are.

568
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:20,550
These are all kind of constructed golf 
culture.

569
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,930
Yeah.
Like old truths or culture.

570
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,180
And so you're having to say,
well,

571
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,043
you know,
over the last few hundred years since 

572
00:27:26,251 --> 00:27:27,660
the enlightenment,
uh,

573
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,950
we've found that in general tortures not
a brilliant idea and capital punishments

574
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:35,340
not great and slavery is largely 
discredited and they,

575
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:35,851
and they said,
well,

576
00:27:35,851 --> 00:27:38,130
so this is about the Western 
enlightenment,

577
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:42,210
that's your authority and I don't want 
to be kinda basing it on that.

578
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,610
So I just,
I slightly made a hash of it after,

579
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,530
after I did the interview,
my producer said to me,

580
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:49,290
so yeah,
I think he kind of owned you in that.

581
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,300
The guy who's like the isis defend,
he's now doing,

582
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,630
he's doing,
he's in prison now.

583
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:55,643
That was why we didn't,
one of the reasons we didn't finish the 

584
00:27:56,551 --> 00:27:59,070
documentary anyway,
that's sort of going off on a tangent or

585
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:02,640
would he go to prison for,
for allegedly glorifying terrorism,

586
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,740
you know,
did you hear that twitter yesterday?

587
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,880
Bam.
Two hundred and 35,000 twitter handles.

588
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,880
No.
Really for promoting terrorism,

589
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,100
really 230,
5,000.

590
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,750
That's incredible how,
I mean,

591
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,660
I'd be intrigued to know how they define
promoting terrorism as well as it.

592
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,720
Would that all be Islamic or.
Yes,

593
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,130
or I would assume because I am not so 
must've been that,

594
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,280
but I wonder if they cause this.

595
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,113
Yeah.
There was a conservative breitbart 

596
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,330
blogger who is,
who has been Milo,

597
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,020
Milo.
Elena.

598
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,240
Yes.
That was very sketchy.

599
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,820
Uh,
I don't agree with what he said,

600
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,713
but if you,
if you really pay attention to what he 

601
00:28:44,131 --> 00:28:45,690
said,
it was very sketchy that they,

602
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:46,603
they banned abandoned.
I mean if you believe in freedom of 

603
00:28:48,571 --> 00:28:50,000
speech or you don't,
kind of.

604
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,180
Yes.
And what he,

605
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,290
what he,
all he did was,

606
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:53,124
he made a post on Breitbart about the 
ghostbusters movie and it was very 

607
00:28:58,801 --> 00:28:59,634
critical,
even basically called it a piece of 

608
00:29:00,631 --> 00:29:01,990
shit.
It was a terrible movie.

609
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:05,520
He said,
is this ridiculous feminist film?

610
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:06,750
And that,
uh,

611
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,583
creating this all female ghostbusters 
cast were all the men are buffoons and 

612
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,560
no flame.
The African American actor,

613
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,423
he flamed everyone.
He called them fat and ugly and 

614
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,090
disgusting.
And you know,

615
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,890
what he's saying is essentially like,
look,

616
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:20,760
I'm,
I'm bitchy,

617
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,210
bitchy all the time.
He's a very flamboyantly gay guy.

618
00:29:24,211 --> 00:29:26,250
He's been in this podcast a couple of 
times.

619
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,660
He's hilarious.
I find them funny on twitter,

620
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,513
use it.
I mean,

621
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,830
we used to go only abandoned.
But here's what's interesting.

622
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,293
He didn't do anything bad on twitter.
When you look at what he said on 

623
00:29:38,821 --> 00:29:40,110
twitter,
it was like nothing,

624
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,980
you know,
it was like nothing more than

625
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,473
she had said.
Leslie Jones had said a bunch of things 

626
00:29:46,061 --> 00:29:51,061
about him or what other people had said 
about her.

627
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,900
And she wrote something down that was 
just poor grammar.

628
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,340
And uh,
he.

629
00:29:57,341 --> 00:30:00,370
And he wrote a,
my word barely literate,

630
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,690
you know,
such a shame.

631
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,060
Schools in America,
you know,

632
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,170
that's essentially what he wrote.
And then he was banned.

633
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,090
I mean,
that is really mild stuff.

634
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,313
I mean,
if you,

635
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,480
I think what,
there's a problem,

636
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,583
first of all,
that he's conservative and they don't 

637
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:14,584
like that and that he does a attack.
Feminists and social justice warriors 

638
00:30:20,171 --> 00:30:23,770
and progressives and the left and he 
goes after them.

639
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:26,860
And that's essentially the whole base of
twitter.

640
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,680
Twitter has this,
what do they call it again?

641
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,430
What is their counsel?
They have

642
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,790
strange.
It's very orwellian.

643
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,690
It's like safety and trust and safety 
council where things,

644
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,943
a watchdog group within twitter that.
Well who decides what is and is not 

645
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:49,820
harassment and sorta.
It's sorta like placating people who are

646
00:30:49,821 --> 00:30:52,370
recreationally outraged by other 
people's opinions.

647
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,743
The trouble is it's a public space that 
is basically a opposed to a corporate 

648
00:30:56,511 --> 00:30:57,221
entity.
Right.

649
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:59,830
So in essence they can do whatever they 
want legally.

650
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,940
Right.
But it's very ideologically based.

651
00:31:01,941 --> 00:31:02,774
It's very left wing.
It's very weird and a lot of ways which 

652
00:31:04,911 --> 00:31:07,700
I am in many ways leftwing.
So when I,

653
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,270
when I read what they're saying,
I agree in some ways,

654
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,104
but outside of actual real harassment,
I just don't think that you should be 

655
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:19,680
able to just ban someone because they,
you know,

656
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,130
call someone a bitch or call someone 
ugly.

657
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,900
It just,
it doesn't seem to me.

658
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,030
I'm not going to disagree with you.

659
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,040
I mean I feel as though we're in a weird
place.

660
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,830
We don't want to touch it slightly,
but you know,

661
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,040
it was around the time of Charlie Hebdo,
you know,

662
00:31:34,041 --> 00:31:36,920
which was everyone was marching for the 
right to be offensive.

663
00:31:36,921 --> 00:31:38,360
Right.
And around the same time,

664
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,223
trolling became a buzzword and it was 
the idea that we should stop trolling 

665
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,973
and there's a certain disconnect we're 
living through as a culture to do with 

666
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,500
wanting to defend the right to be 
offensive,

667
00:31:48,501 --> 00:31:49,334
but also come down hard on trawling and 
actually at a certain point you can't 

668
00:31:52,281 --> 00:31:53,690
have it both ways.
Yeah.

669
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,583
Well there was also a lot of people that
were defending what had happened in 

670
00:31:58,701 --> 00:32:02,240
Charlie Hebdo by saying that those 
cartoons were really racist.

671
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,870
They were going so far,
pro Islamic to sort of a bite.

672
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,080
Well,
I'm going to say I.

673
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:08,953
What I heard was because I understood 
this was some people saying absolutely 

674
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:13,820
it's a crime.

675
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:16,480
It's hideous and people have the right 
to be um,

676
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:17,990
uh,
you know,

677
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,913
to be offensive.
But I'm not going to valorize the 

678
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:22,484
message or even hold these people up as 
free speech monitors anymore than I 

679
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:31,310
would do if temet SCO or Neo Nazi was 
killed.

680
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:35,420
He does not thereby become a hero.
He becomes a victim of a,

681
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,560
of a,
of a lynch mob,

682
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:37,394
of a murderous campaign,
but I'm not there by a supporter of his 

683
00:32:42,771 --> 00:32:44,540
output.
Does that make sense?

684
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,590
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

685
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,600
There's a mistake here.
Um,

686
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:50,030
uh,
I have to text that to Tom.

687
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,950
Pablo thinks he's supposed to be here 
right now.

688
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,640
Apparently he's outside.
He's supposed to be in next Monday.

689
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:57,260
Lips.
Tom?

690
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,090
Um,
yeah,

691
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:01,100
I think so.
So Penn,

692
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,210
for example,
the uh,

693
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,410
the,
I think it was penn,

694
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:06,920
the American magician,
no writers union.

695
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,520
It was a,
it's a guild of writers.

696
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,870
It supports the rights of writers around
the world in America.

697
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,441
And they said,
well,

698
00:33:12,441 --> 00:33:13,274
we don't want to give an award.
So there was a divide in the among 

699
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,540
parachute,
which should we give an award to Charlie

700
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:20,160
Hebdo by giving them an award,
a,

701
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,440
are you there by saying saying we 
support you for saying that Mohammed was

702
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,140
a piece of shit or whatever they were 
saying,

703
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,820
or are you,
in other words,

704
00:33:28,821 --> 00:33:31,250
do you get an award for being killed?
Does that.

705
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,120
There's a little bit of a conflict there
in other words,

706
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,200
so I don't,
I,

707
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:40,430
I'm sympathetic to people who feel that 
absolutely was a crime was hideous.

708
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:43,100
You know,
Islamofascism killed Charlie Hebdo,

709
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,120
but that does not there by mate.
Charlie Hebdo message.

710
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,650
A loadable creditable one.
Yes.

711
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,484
That's a really good point.
Because what were they doing and what 

712
00:33:51,501 --> 00:33:52,730
was the point of what they were doing?

713
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:55,970
Were they trust trying to be funny?
Was it parody?

714
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,200
I don't know if it was funny because I 
don't speak French and I haven't,

715
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,650
I haven't really paid any attention to 
the translations.

716
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,230
Just to me it didn't seem that fun.
But if joe,

717
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,810
if Julia striker right,
that,

718
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:08,840
you know,
the,

719
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,713
I'm not,
I don't want to compare them directly 

720
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:12,381
with this,
but you know,

721
00:34:12,381 --> 00:34:15,450
an offensive propagandists for the Nazis
just to take an exam.

722
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,453
You know,
I shouldn't even go down this road 

723
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:19,520
because once you bring the Nazis ended,
it just clouds everything.

724
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,550
As soon as you say Hitler thought 
blocking it blocks off,

725
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,390
he's worse than Hitler.
That's trump.

726
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,320
Yes.
Yeah.

727
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,880
I think,
um,

728
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,143
the,
the real bottom line is people were 

729
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:33,380
killed for cartoons.
There's no way to defend that.

730
00:34:33,381 --> 00:34:33,740
Right,
right.

731
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,190
I think everyone agrees that we agree 
with that.

732
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,020
Does that make the cartoons good?

733
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,873
It certainly doesn't know.
They could be shit cartoons and people 

734
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:42,100
were killed for shit cartoons.
It's wrong to kill people.

735
00:34:42,101 --> 00:34:44,210
We show them cartoons,
but uh,

736
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,520
the cartoons are still shit.
Even l Ron Hubbard.

737
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,630
Would you agree with that?
Yeah.

738
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,880
Hopefully.
Well,

739
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:51,103
let's bring it back to scientology 
because that's one of the interesting 

740
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:53,594
things about scientology is that anyone 
who is a quote unquote opponent of 

741
00:34:57,351 --> 00:34:58,184
Scientology,
they are allowed to violate pretty much 

742
00:34:59,991 --> 00:35:02,330
all of their principals and just go 
after you.

743
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,710
You are the enemy.
Yes.

744
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,350
And the,
in you,

745
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,190
there's a whole different set of rules 
for engaging with someone who's an sp,

746
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,600
like how they do that as,
that's what they do in the military too,

747
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:16,160
by the way.
You know,

748
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:17,203
they,
they abbreviate acronyms and a lot of 

749
00:35:19,131 --> 00:35:19,910
stuff that,
uh,

750
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,490
in scientology is based on hubbards 
naval experience.

751
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:23,324
He loved,
they dress up in naval uniforms and 

752
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:26,820
they,
he loved things like,

753
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:28,423
um,
little bulletins or anything that felt 

754
00:35:30,621 --> 00:35:33,170
kind of quasi military and you know what
I mean?

755
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,580
They love it in a way.
It's a mixture of so military can enable

756
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,940
stuff and then some corporate style 
stuff.

757
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:42,923
What it isn't is a lot of religious 
stuff like that is the one thing that 

758
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,194
you don't get a flavor of in terms of 
the way they dress and drill this in 

759
00:35:49,071 --> 00:35:50,190
show business,
you know,

760
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,640
you've got a little touch of Hollywood,
you got to touch of Navel.

761
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:56,580
You don't have any sense of it being 
kind of spiritual,

762
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:00,240
religious and I'm talking the way they 
style themselves,

763
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,074
the language they use,
they're constantly using abbreviations 

764
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:06,810
that are more or less than 
unintelligible to the outsider,

765
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,883
which by the way is a lot of how 
allegedly according to the experts on 

766
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,480
thought reform or colts so called,
they say,

767
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,343
but by learning a new language,
it's part of what kind of gets you 

768
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:23,160
caught up in thought patterns of,
of an abusive system.

769
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,020
Well,
that's also military people.

770
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:25,854
If you talked to people who really have 
a deep understanding of the military or 

771
00:36:28,321 --> 00:36:31,830
people who love the military,
they love to talk and those acronyms,

772
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,873
they love to use them because it sort of
lets everybody know that you're on the 

773
00:36:35,071 --> 00:36:36,030
inside.
Yes.

774
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,580
You know,
it's like when people talk about cars or

775
00:36:38,581 --> 00:36:40,740
anything where it's,
um,

776
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,603
there's a,
there's a surface knowledge that most 

777
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:43,441
people have.
Oh,

778
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:44,850
that is a Ferrari.
Oh,

779
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:47,280
that is a corvette.
But then there's deep,

780
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:49,970
deep knowledge as you start going into,
you know,

781
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,970
the different types of gearing and the 
axles and you know,

782
00:36:53,971 --> 00:36:55,880
it's got 4:11 rear end and this and 
that,

783
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:56,521
and you're like,
oh,

784
00:36:56,521 --> 00:36:57,354
he knows he's the deep knowledge.
He has a deep knowledge of the car with 

785
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,913
the deep knowledge of the military.
And a lot of that is sort of expressed 

786
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:06,810
through acronyms.

787
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,520
Yes.
Yes they do.

788
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,330
They do,
they do stuff.

789
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,230
So that's a big part of how they 
operate.

790
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,093
And I think as well,
I mean this is something I mentioned 

791
00:37:16,411 --> 00:37:17,244
before,
it is important to bear in mind as well 

792
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:19,734
that as much as I'm scientology kind of 
costs the world and us and them terms 

793
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:26,183
which is very characteristic of a lot of
systems of thought that are inimical to 

794
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,000
sort of freedom or free way of thinking.
It's us and them.

795
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,910
It's like Bush saying you're,
you're either with us or against us.

796
00:37:35,911 --> 00:37:36,744
And in Scientology,
in a famous statement of Tom Cruise's 

797
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,293
that he gave in 2004 when he was given a
Freedom Medal of valor at a big 

798
00:37:41,911 --> 00:37:46,230
scientology wold ceremony in England.
He said,

799
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,064
you're either in or you're either 
playing on the pitch or you're out of 

800
00:37:49,561 --> 00:37:51,500
the arena.
You know,

801
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:55,640
that's the one when they gave him that 
huge flavor flave style.

802
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,230
And,
and so his thing is like,

803
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:02,490
you on the pitcher get out of the arena 
because there's no half measures you get

804
00:38:02,491 --> 00:38:04,530
in or you're out.
And that whole idea,

805
00:38:04,531 --> 00:38:05,364
like if you're not part of the solution,
then you're part of the problem is a 

806
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:10,200
very dangerous,
slippery road to go down.

807
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,034
Because your then by definition saying 
there's good guys and bad guys and if 

808
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:16,170
you're not on my team,
you're a bad guy.

809
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:18,120
Well,
let's define what the solution is,

810
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,560
Tom,
and sit down.

811
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,790
Tell us about what.
What are thethe?

812
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,673
Agent explained to me,
how Dayton's they throw them into a 

813
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:27,750
volcano.
What happens?

814
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,340
Well,
you know,

815
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:32,370
I'm going to sound weird now because one
of my promises that I made to myself was

816
00:38:32,371 --> 00:38:36,250
that I would never gratuitously mark of 
the beliefs

817
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,940
of scientology and one of the things 
they find offensive is,

818
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,833
is,
is to reveal some of the secret truths 

819
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,020
that are unveiled.
A.

820
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,910
Okay.
I take a step back,

821
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,090
was unique to scientology,
is that it's a mystery religion,

822
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:49,924
meaning that many of its beliefs around 
veiled as you advance up the ladder of 

823
00:38:53,411 --> 00:38:56,180
enlightenment and okay,
so you don't have day one.

824
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,033
Get told.
Unlike with Jesus and Christianity on 

825
00:38:59,021 --> 00:38:59,854
day one,
you're told he died on the cross for 

826
00:39:00,761 --> 00:39:03,430
your sins.
Believe in him and you will be saved and

827
00:39:03,431 --> 00:39:04,264
go to heaven.
There's no kind of catch on later sort 

828
00:39:07,031 --> 00:39:09,610
of amendment that gets made when you're 
a year,

829
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:10,444
two years,
three years down the line in 

830
00:39:11,921 --> 00:39:14,170
Scientology,
you learn more as you go up.

831
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,593
Some say that that is partly something 
that owes to Crowley or Alistair 

832
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,680
Crowley,
I think it's pronounced,

833
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,853
that Hubbard had practiced a form of 
satanism when he was living in Pasadena 

834
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,153
in the forties,
right after the Second World War and 

835
00:39:28,151 --> 00:39:29,620
incorporated that aspect of it.

836
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,720
And it is quite a seductive idea.
The idea,

837
00:39:31,721 --> 00:39:32,554
oh,
I'm going to learn more as I go on and 

838
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,910
kind of unraveling mystery.
Um,

839
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,783
so,
so that is part of scientology and when 

840
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:42,070
you get to own the ot levels,
which is,

841
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:42,904
once you've gone clear,
which is sort of half ot is operating 

842
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:47,490
fate and yeah.
So,

843
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:48,683
so to begin with you're going clear is,
was originally the best thing you could 

844
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:54,130
do.
And then subsequently there was,

845
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:54,983
he added more levels and more layers and
you get to the ot and this eight 

846
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:03,090
published ot levels and ot,
three various secrets are revealed.

847
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,220
And I'm allegedly,
uh,

848
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,083
if,
if an uninitiated ot or an uninitiated 

849
00:40:09,911 --> 00:40:13,330
person is shown the secrets,
it makes them go crazy,

850
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,280
but one of the things that,
but I,

851
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:17,114
you know,
you're not in a documentary about 

852
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:21,570
scientology rejoices in telling you 
what,

853
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:22,990
what the ot stuff is.

854
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,880
And I think you were about to touch on 
it.

855
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:29,560
I promised myself that I wouldn't reveal
them because I sort of felt,

856
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:30,394
you know,
it's a little cheap when all these 

857
00:40:31,571 --> 00:40:33,460
documentaries,
um,

858
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,211
say,
you know,

859
00:40:34,211 --> 00:40:37,770
this is what you $100,000 in or 200 or 
500,000,

860
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,860
you're going to learn what happens with 
[inaudible] and then we,

861
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,910
you know,
they spoil the surprise for everyone.

862
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,120
Um,
and I also felt like I'd like to be able

863
00:40:46,121 --> 00:40:47,940
to say to,
if I ever meet a scientology,

864
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,990
I mean,
I'm sure I've met some,

865
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:50,680
but without knowing it,
but you know,

866
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,260
if I ever meet Tom Cruise or back,
I want to be able to say like,

867
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:54,730
you know what?
I didn't ever do anything.

868
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:55,564
I just,
I have a right to know my truth and 

869
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:59,350
express my truth.
I don't want to mock you.

870
00:40:59,351 --> 00:41:00,184
I don't want to make you have a right to
believe what you want to believe and if 

871
00:41:02,201 --> 00:41:03,034
you think you know,
no more than enforced the Jewish guy to 

872
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:07,420
eat pork or,
or terrorist baronet to cut his hair.

873
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,850
And so I'm not going to say to an ot,
uh,

874
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,703
you know what?
I know what happens to ot three and it 

875
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:15,250
sounds like a bunch of junk.
Well,

876
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,320
you don't even have to say that's a 
bunch of junk,

877
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:21,760
but just expressing,
I think there's what we know.

878
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,833
Okay,
well we know about their doctrine or 

879
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,650
their,
whatever you want to call it,

880
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,850
their,
their scripture.

881
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,440
And there's an amazing moment in the 
documentary,

882
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:34,090
the hbo where it was,
it was

883
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,050
Paul Higgs.
Is that what gets Haggis?

884
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,790
Haggis thank gets to ot three.
Yeah,

885
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,840
you're going to say,
fine.

886
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,220
He gets to ot three and he starts 
reading some of the handwritten stuff by

887
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,370
l Ron Hubbard.
There's a whole palava.

888
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,150
It's an interesting bit in the book too.
Do you remember?

889
00:41:47,151 --> 00:41:47,984
Like he's guided into a room and 
literally it's almost like they take it 

890
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:51,794
out of a safety deposit box and kind of 
open it up with gloves of white gloved 

891
00:41:55,851 --> 00:41:56,684
hands and then there's a hand written 
kind of piece of parchment inside 

892
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:04,130
written in Hubbard's manuscript and you 
read it in that room and then.

893
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,053
And then the guy has a little routine.
He follows the person who brought you 

894
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:08,961
in,
comes in and says,

895
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:11,870
has it been read and comprehended or 
something like that.

896
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,123
Right?
And then you've read it and you go like 

897
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,953
a yes,
and then I ask and it shall be done or 

898
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,860
something.
And then they put it back in and take it

899
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:19,580
away.
Yeah.

900
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,790
Well it must be.
It's a great sense of theater.

901
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,750
Like I love.
It's like being in the Mason,

902
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:27,350
so I mean all that secret squirrel 
stuff.

903
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,910
It's very appealing.

904
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,560
I forgot about secret squirrel.
Yeah.

905
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:42,710
But I think it's important to talk about
what we know about what that is about.

906
00:42:42,711 --> 00:42:45,500
What is fine.
I mean it's on the Internet.

907
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,203
What I would say is what they believe is
that man is an immortal in a mortal 

908
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:54,380
spirits and you have not you,
you are not your body.

909
00:42:54,381 --> 00:42:56,900
You are the spirit and the spirit is a 
Fayton.

910
00:42:56,930 --> 00:42:59,810
That's the term they use for spirits and
your spirit.

911
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,180
You,
in essence have lived multiple lifetimes

912
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,760
in multiple bodies going back,
Millennia and going forward,

913
00:43:04,761 --> 00:43:06,740
Millennia.
And that's not a unique thought.

914
00:43:06,770 --> 00:43:07,970
No,
I mean unique to them.

915
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,560
No,
you have that in Buddhism.

916
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:10,394
But unlike in Buddhism,
the transmigration of souls does not 

917
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,670
resides only in humans.
Right?

918
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:18,300
You,
I don't think you can become a,

919
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:19,790
a chipmunk,
right?

920
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:22,300
Which you can in Buddhism I think,
can you not.

921
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,560
You not know.
And I think you know,

922
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,320
depending on how you're calmer is nest 
number one.

923
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:28,154
And number two,
which is even more important or just as 

924
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:31,304
important,
is that you can carry your memories 

925
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,610
through the lifetimes using a 
scientology.

926
00:43:34,611 --> 00:43:35,444
And the gift that scientology gives you 
is the ability to retain your memories 

927
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:43,220
and your identity across multiple 
lifetimes.

928
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:46,310
And that's why it's so important to a 
scientologist to,

929
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,490
um,
to recollect his or her past lifetimes.

930
00:43:49,491 --> 00:43:52,970
Because it suggests that you're sort of,
you're on,

931
00:43:52,971 --> 00:43:57,140
you're now on your cosmic destiny and 
you will carry it forward into your.

932
00:43:57,141 --> 00:43:59,000
When you,
when you next incarnate.

933
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,880
These are all unique ideas.
I mean they're there,

934
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:02,923
they're interesting,
but when you know the source of all of 

935
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,260
it and yet they ignore it and they,
they,

936
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,113
they choose to not pay attention to the 
other things that he read or wrote 

937
00:44:11,841 --> 00:44:14,150
rather like a battlefield earth.

938
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,520
That movie with John Travolta Grc that I
never saw.

939
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:18,080
That one.
It's wonderful.

940
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:24,190
It's wonderful.
It's right up there with GRC showgirls.

941
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:26,090
Yes,
I have seen showgirls.

942
00:44:26,091 --> 00:44:26,924
Showgirls is like a tour De Force of 
writing a movie while you're high on 

943
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:33,560
cocaine.
Hoven.

944
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,750
Yeah.
Directed it.

945
00:44:34,751 --> 00:44:35,584
It's a great combination.
It's in one of the best unintentional 

946
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:41,270
comedy that's ever been mined.
All you could.

947
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,450
Hobans a brilliant director and I think 
and starship troopers.

948
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,570
He made and I'm the first Robo Cop he 
knew.

949
00:44:48,571 --> 00:44:49,404
I think he knew what he was doing.
I think he has a keen eye for camp and 

950
00:44:52,741 --> 00:44:55,530
thought this is hilarious.
Don't you may ask the house?

951
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:57,270
Maybe not.
It could have been,

952
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,440
it could have been,
um,

953
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:02,550
I think they were just coked out of 
their mind and they made a wacky fucking

954
00:45:02,551 --> 00:45:04,050
movie and they probably thought it was 
great,

955
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,080
but fuck it.

956
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,720
Print it out.
Let's go out.

957
00:45:06,721 --> 00:45:09,030
Let's,
let's at the Ivy and I don't know,

958
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:09,893
I mean,
I think they were just out of their 

959
00:45:10,231 --> 00:45:10,800
mind.
I mean,

960
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,560
if you watch that film,
there's a scene where,

961
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,110
what is her name?
Elizabeth Berkley.

962
00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:18,440
And the other guy from,
um,

963
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:21,750
I can't remember who blue lagoon is.
It was from.

964
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:22,943
Was He from?
Was that TV show that he was on the 

965
00:45:24,350 --> 00:45:26,490
handsome on Kyle.
What the fuck's his name?

966
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,950
Mcconnell lock.
A lot of Caughlin.

967
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,413
This is Kyle mclachlan.
They're having sex in a pool and she 

968
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:37,530
starts flopping around like a fish.
She literally starts having spasms,

969
00:45:37,531 --> 00:45:39,330
like if you continued to have sex with 
her,

970
00:45:39,331 --> 00:45:40,164
I feel like that's rape.
Like this is a woman who is having a 

971
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:44,250
goddamn seizure and you're going to keep
having sex with her.

972
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,080
Have you ever seen the scene?
No.

973
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:47,400
Seen the movie.

974
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:47,960
So yes.
Yeah,

975
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,230
it must have.
It's wonderful.

976
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:50,760
She,
she starts,

977
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:51,743
they're having sex and she starts 
flailing like as if she's having a 

978
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:55,674
goddamn stroke.
She was in the middle of a heart attack 

979
00:45:57,391 --> 00:46:02,391
or a seizure and that choice is the only
thing that haunts me about that movie.

980
00:46:03,631 --> 00:46:05,490
Like maybe it is,
maybe it was camp,

981
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,680
maybe they're doing that on purpose.
I think it was,

982
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,500
but I read an interview with the 
director of,

983
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,090
um,
of battlefield,

984
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,150
his battlefield,
and he,

985
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,910
he apparently is a pretty good director 
and had,

986
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:22,110
he's a European,
I think maybe French and I think he just

987
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:26,040
didn't know what he was walking into and
I think he didn't even,

988
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:28,770
he didn't really check out what he was,
what the Gig was.

989
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,280
Well that was a product of John 
Travolta.

990
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:37,920
Travolta was labor and it's wonderfully 
bad.

991
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:39,410
Yeah.
There's a funny bit in,

992
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:44,420
in going in the book where they,
I think Cruz sees it and,

993
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,100
and it's like,
this is so embarrassing for him.

994
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:50,520
He's really upset about it.
Well,

995
00:46:50,521 --> 00:46:55,521
he was upset that they showed that video
of him saluting to Lrh.

996
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,770
They salute when they got the metal.
All that crazy shit.

997
00:46:58,790 --> 00:46:59,760
Yeah,
that's all.

998
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,900
It's all over youtube recruitment.
Was he upset about that being.

999
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:04,163
Oh,
they try to get that taken down and of 

1000
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:08,860
course it spread like wildfire through 
the Internet because you just,

1001
00:47:08,890 --> 00:47:11,740
you just can't.
You can't take things like that down.

1002
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,080
No,
it's classic.

1003
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:13,914
Although a lot of stuff's been,
there are a lot of great scientology 

1004
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:17,820
videos that have been taken down.
Really?

1005
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:20,340
Yes.
There's a famous one.

1006
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:22,073
It's very hard to find.
It's the orientation video that was 

1007
00:47:25,021 --> 00:47:26,840
shown to new parishioners.
Uh,

1008
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:30,160
this is back in the eighties and it was 
done by an infomercial pitch man

1009
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,080
who was then a scientologist and then,
um,

1010
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,390
subsequently left,
you know,

1011
00:47:34,391 --> 00:47:35,350
by the way,
do you know one of the,

1012
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,440
they don't cost scientologists in 
scientology a commercials.

1013
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,760
Do you know why?
Why?

1014
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,873
Because they blow to off like they leave
and then they no longer want to be in 

1015
00:47:46,211 --> 00:47:49,450
the video or it becomes embarrassing to 
have someone speak.

1016
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,930
Can you imagine if Leah Remini was in a 
commercial for scientology?

1017
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:54,810
They'd never be able to use it again.
Right.

1018
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:59,320
So they call it sort of insurance 
because they want to be able to use the,

1019
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,720
they spent a lot of money on the 
commercial.

1020
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:04,060
They don't want to be embarrassed when 
the scientologists who's The star of the

1021
00:48:04,061 --> 00:48:06,910
commercial leave scientology and says 
that they were brainwashed.

1022
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,690
That's their actual reason I'm told.
Yeah.

1023
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:10,830
How many of them left?

1024
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,160
Uh,
well I mean say the retention rate.

1025
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,470
No,
they're very,

1026
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:16,750
they keep the data very close to their 
chest.

1027
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:20,440
So I know that they have,
um,

1028
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:24,460
they say millions,
I think they say $40,

1029
00:48:24,461 --> 00:48:28,150
million and some vast amount worldwide.
I know that in,

1030
00:48:28,830 --> 00:48:31,000
on Tony Ortega's blog,
he's,

1031
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:34,470
I think there's a US census data that,
that the,

1032
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:37,900
that perhaps suggesting in the US it 
might be 20 or $30,000.

1033
00:48:37,901 --> 00:48:39,400
We should probably get that fact 
checked.

1034
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,160
But I believe I read that there are more
people who identify as Jed,

1035
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:44,780
I,

1036
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:45,613
that's their religion and they're all 
just decided a long process to become a 

1037
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:53,840
jetta.
Or can you just,

1038
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,173
uh,
climate.

1039
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,860
I think this is a long process,
but it's very cheap.

1040
00:48:57,861 --> 00:48:58,880
It's a good thing.
Oh,

1041
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,310
well I've watched all the movies.
I think I'm in.

1042
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,360
Um,
I just,

1043
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:08,740
it's amazing to me that this exists.
I understand that it exists.

1044
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:12,650
I intellectually,
when I sit back and I look at the,

1045
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,280
the,
the,

1046
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,860
the many,
many different religions and many,

1047
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:19,360
many different ideologies that people 
subscribe to in the,

1048
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:20,303
the vast amount of people out there that
are searching for truth and an answer 

1049
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,780
and end something to belong to.
Even that,

1050
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,350
even though all those things make sense 
to me intellectually,

1051
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:31,603
I'm still fascinated.
I'm still so puzzled that in 2016 with 

1052
00:49:35,571 --> 00:49:36,404
the Internet,
with all the access to information that 

1053
00:49:38,421 --> 00:49:40,490
we have today,
but that still exists.

1054
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:44,300
It's a [inaudible] and you look forward 
and you wonder,

1055
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,360
it will you.
Is this going to fizzle out?

1056
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:53,520
But I think what they've done is they've
kind of created a,

1057
00:49:53,521 --> 00:49:54,354
a marketing juggernaut that is,
if not immune to but at least highly 

1058
00:49:59,461 --> 00:50:03,030
resistant to any attempt to discredit or
undermine.

1059
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,650
So I,
I read a thing that said,

1060
00:50:04,651 --> 00:50:07,050
well,
it's religion that sells secrets,

1061
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:08,640
right?
That's its USP.

1062
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:10,043
You advance something,
you pay more money to get the more 

1063
00:50:13,171 --> 00:50:14,004
secret levels and the Internet is 
Kryptonite to that because the internet 

1064
00:50:18,661 --> 00:50:19,494
is a,
is a,

1065
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,870
is a machine revealing secrets.
Yeah.

1066
00:50:21,871 --> 00:50:24,480
Wiki leaks and whatnot.
And you can google anything.

1067
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,513
So,
so that will be scientology's waterloo 

1068
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,520
will be the fact that we now have 
searchable data.

1069
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:32,711
Um,
but I,

1070
00:50:32,711 --> 00:50:35,900
it shows no signs of coming apart,
you know,

1071
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:40,670
that the numbers may not be high,
but the amounts of revenue coming in and

1072
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:41,563
are a huge,
from what I can tell and I get the 

1073
00:50:44,181 --> 00:50:47,630
feeling that um,
well you just have to see how,

1074
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,420
you know,
the amount that they're able to spend on

1075
00:50:50,421 --> 00:50:52,910
advertising,
the number of new buildings that go up,

1076
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,340
uh,
so however small it may be,

1077
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,350
it has a huge.

1078
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,610
I'm punching power.
Where are they getting the money from?

1079
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,193
Well,
it's an interesting point are the first 

1080
00:51:02,001 --> 00:51:02,834
thing is that it's it,
it's structured almost like a 

1081
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:06,620
Mcdonald's.
So,

1082
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,930
and in fact,
interestingly in 1950,

1083
00:51:08,931 --> 00:51:09,764
the year that dianetics was published 
was also the first year that Mcdonald's 

1084
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:13,693
was established as pointed out by,
I don't know if you've ever read Janet 

1085
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:16,483
Reitman's book inside Scientology.
It came up a year before Larry writes 

1086
00:51:19,131 --> 00:51:21,260
book.
I'm going clear,

1087
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,610
but,
so it was slightly,

1088
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:23,710
it's,
it's done.

1089
00:51:23,711 --> 00:51:24,544
That was stolen by going clear.
But it's also an excellent book and a 

1090
00:51:27,141 --> 00:51:28,850
great primary,
if you enjoyed going clear.

1091
00:51:28,851 --> 00:51:30,860
I really highly recommend inside 
scientology.

1092
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,723
She points this out that in 1950 
Mcdonald's was invented and so was 

1093
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,520
dianetics.
Um,

1094
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:42,550
so they basically kind of a franchise 
system in which they are sort of selling

1095
00:51:42,741 --> 00:51:44,320
the,
they own the property of the,

1096
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,830
of the various buildings in which 
scientology is sold.

1097
00:51:49,010 --> 00:51:52,430
And then they licensed the materials but
they can't really,

1098
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,470
you know,
some of the franchisees can lose money,

1099
00:51:54,471 --> 00:51:58,640
but scientology itself can't really lose
money because they're just getting rents

1100
00:51:58,641 --> 00:52:01,250
from the people who are,
who are selling the scientology.

1101
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,630
Does that make sense?
The services.

1102
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,430
But it doesn't make sense that they get 
that much revenue from that.

1103
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,840
Again,
take real estate holders.

1104
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,280
So they have huge amounts of real 
estate.

1105
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:13,430
The other part of it is that they,
because it's a religion,

1106
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,610
the money is a tax deductible or 
whatever,

1107
00:52:16,611 --> 00:52:18,500
like they don't pay taxes on it in 
essence.

1108
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:19,334
And so I think,
I think that means that it's very hard 

1109
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:23,120
for them to lose money.
It's a huge,

1110
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,120
it's a huge cushion against financial 
failure.

1111
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:29,270
Well,
that was a really disturbing part of the

1112
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:30,104
documentary.
It showed how they became a tax exempt 

1113
00:52:32,001 --> 00:52:32,801
religion.
The,

1114
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:33,634
the,
the government essentially caved under 

1115
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,980
the threat of massive amounts of 
lawsuits.

1116
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:37,611
Yes.
Yeah,

1117
00:52:37,611 --> 00:52:38,630
they were,
um,

1118
00:52:39,770 --> 00:52:40,603
basically the scientologists found a way
to pressure individual irs employees to 

1119
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,290
the point where their lives have become 
extremely hard so they,

1120
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:50,430
they'd settled.
But what year was that?

1121
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,650
When I want to say I'm going to get this
right?

1122
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,800
Ninety two,
I would say 92,

1123
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:59,240
93.
It's amazing that that's upheld.

1124
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,760
I know.
But then again,

1125
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:03,950
uh,
I mean,

1126
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:08,540
what the benchmark for being,
for having charitable status is not that

1127
00:53:08,541 --> 00:53:09,374
high.
Look at the Clinton Foundation right 

1128
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,103
there.
There are the people scrutinizing what 

1129
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:18,650
qualifies as a charitable enterprise do 
not seem to be.

1130
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,890
I'm working,
especially you on top of their game.

1131
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,680
And um,
so yeah,

1132
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:31,500
I think once that's in place,
I think the other part of it is,

1133
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,960
so you paid one of their routes for 
finances,

1134
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:35,790
you pay for services,
you turn up,

1135
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:37,320
you spent,
I want auditing,

1136
00:53:37,321 --> 00:53:41,040
so I'll get an order package for $300 
and you get whatever,

1137
00:53:41,041 --> 00:53:41,880
five sessions.

1138
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,103
But the other thing is they solicit 
donations and five or six times a year 

1139
00:53:46,170 --> 00:53:48,360
they have large events.
And uh,

1140
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:51,030
that's the footage of Tom Cruise,
is it one of these events?

1141
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:51,864
And they cut their,
like these huge Hollywood style award 

1142
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:54,984
ceremonies where they pack hundreds of 
Scientology's into an auditorium and 

1143
00:53:58,651 --> 00:53:59,484
they both looked quite impressive.
So to the outside they look kind of 

1144
00:54:02,671 --> 00:54:03,504
grandiose and impressive,
but they are in essence a kind of live 

1145
00:54:06,421 --> 00:54:11,421
infomercial event where everyone who's 
there is then aggressively reged,

1146
00:54:12,810 --> 00:54:16,500
which means that they're aggressively 
hit up for donations.

1147
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:20,010
Does that make sense?
So anytime you see one of those events,

1148
00:54:20,011 --> 00:54:23,070
all those people who were at the event 
before they can leave,

1149
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,340
someone comes up to them and says,
how committed to sign Tom Gru,

1150
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,350
we would sincerely appreciate an 
expression of your with your support and

1151
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,240
the guilt tripped into making a 
donation,

1152
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,890
a tax deductible donation.

1153
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:37,560
And I'm,
I'm sorry,

1154
00:54:37,561 --> 00:54:39,780
I know I'm rambling,
but there's a lot of information so,

1155
00:54:39,781 --> 00:54:40,614
so,
so they get huge amounts of money for 

1156
00:54:41,701 --> 00:54:44,020
that and that money.
Then I'm.

1157
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,713
One of the good things about that is 
that can never be revoked like if you 

1158
00:54:48,511 --> 00:54:49,344
leave.
So one of the problems they had in the 

1159
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:54,720
past was if you,
if you spend $10,000 on credit and say I

1160
00:54:54,721 --> 00:54:55,554
love scientology,
it's going to be amazing and then you 

1161
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:00,480
like a thousand dollars in your,
into your services.

1162
00:55:00,481 --> 00:55:01,314
You're like,
this isn't doing anything I want to 

1163
00:55:02,041 --> 00:55:04,290
leave.
And then you ask for your money back and

1164
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,270
it's very hard for you to get your money
back.

1165
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,253
Whereas the donations that are made to 
something called the Ias in Association 

1166
00:55:11,461 --> 00:55:14,400
of Scientologists,
you can't get those back once you leave,

1167
00:55:14,690 --> 00:55:15,523
which I'll make it very simple for you,
is very rich scientologists who make 

1168
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:20,660
large donations.
Basically.

1169
00:55:20,661 --> 00:55:21,494
There's a guy called Bob Duggan,
has a multibillionaire who's donated 

1170
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,310
literally tens of millions.

1171
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:29,180
I mean,
and there's a lot.

1172
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:31,450
There's a lot of actors.
Who mean.

1173
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:32,393
Well,
Leah Remini,

1174
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,393
one of the,
um,

1175
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:38,730
she's one of the most famous detractors,
right person who's left,

1176
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,631
right?
Right.

1177
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:42,480
Until she was like one of his most 
famous supporters.

1178
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,100
But that's a,
that's weird because like,

1179
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,580
her turnaround was like that.
I,

1180
00:55:47,581 --> 00:55:49,790
um,
I know I have a lot of respect for.

1181
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:50,643
I mean,
I think there's a lot of guys like this 

1182
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:52,710
guy who was,
I was talking about this pitch,

1183
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:53,653
the infomercial pitch man who did the 
orientation video that was taken down 

1184
00:55:56,491 --> 00:55:58,320
from youtube.
It's called Larry Anderson,

1185
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:00,100
right?
And He,

1186
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:01,123
I really wanted to interview him for our
film because I just thought the 

1187
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,050
orientation video is so funny.
It's one of those,

1188
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:09,560
some is this video where they say,
uh,

1189
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,490
he goes,
welcome to scientology.

1190
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:15,930
You if at the end of this video you 
decide this is not for you,

1191
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:16,950
that's fine.

1192
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:20,130
You're welcome to leave.
Just as you're free to jump off,

1193
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:22,560
throw yourself off a bridge or blow your
brains out.

1194
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:27,040
So it's just very over the top kind of 
thing.

1195
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:29,860
It's just ludicrous.
But he left scientology so they couldn't

1196
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:33,530
show it anymore,
but he left an Mo,

1197
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:34,403
like most high profile defectors.
He just didn't want anything more to do 

1198
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:38,620
with it.
He's just like,

1199
00:56:38,621 --> 00:56:39,454
I'm done.
And very often they cut a deal where 

1200
00:56:41,381 --> 00:56:43,900
they say find the scientology will say 
like,

1201
00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:45,430
we'll let you do the x,
y,

1202
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:47,650
and Z,
whether it's get some money back,

1203
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,233
speak to your people,
your friends and family who is still in 

1204
00:56:50,531 --> 00:56:52,990
scientology,
but we don't want you speaking out.

1205
00:56:53,830 --> 00:56:54,710
And so then the,
the,

1206
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:55,930
the effect will be like,
okay,

1207
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:57,010
fine,
I want a simple life.

1208
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:58,493
But Leah Remini to her credit has 
actually gone out there and absolutely 

1209
00:57:03,821 --> 00:57:06,220
made it a mission to,
to call them out.

1210
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:09,330
How far did she get?
I don't know where she,

1211
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,710
I think she was quite far.
Most of the actors.

1212
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,720
Um,
I think actors,

1213
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:14,883
they're considered people of influence 
and so they get certain amount of 

1214
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,870
services for free.
That's the impression I have.

1215
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,153
And so I think,
and I think they're encouraged to go up 

1216
00:57:23,021 --> 00:57:26,230
the bridge quite quickly.
I had a neighbor who was a scientologist

1217
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:29,640
and he wanted to buy a piece of 
property.

1218
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:33,430
We had a discussion about this,
how I found out he was scientologists he

1219
00:57:33,431 --> 00:57:34,690
sent out of nowhere,
you know,

1220
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:35,950
we,
we started talking about this.

1221
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:36,761
He's like,
yeah,

1222
00:57:36,761 --> 00:57:38,100
I'm thinking about buying it.
But uh,

1223
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:41,400
right now my wife is about to go clear 
and uh,

1224
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:42,620
I go,
what's,

1225
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,900
this is a long time ago.
I go,

1226
00:57:43,901 --> 00:57:44,800
well,
what does that mean?

1227
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,713
And then he starts expressing what it 
means and that she's no longer going to 

1228
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:50,254
be influenced by negative thoughts and 
this is going to cost $50,000 and it's 

1229
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:57,700
probably more now probably is the 
nineties,

1230
00:57:57,701 --> 00:57:58,534
but $50,000 for a ceremony where you're 
no longer going to be influenced by 

1231
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:04,504
negative thoughts.

1232
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:06,243
And then you find out actually footnote,
there's this other thing you have to 

1233
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:13,570
deal with.
And then there's another like 15 levels.

1234
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,260
So yeah,
I,

1235
00:58:16,261 --> 00:58:17,350
I,
it's a funny,

1236
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:20,020
it's a funny one.
Did you talk to Leah Remini?

1237
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:20,920
Uh,
we approached,

1238
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:21,190
uh,
you know,

1239
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:23,560
we,
I should explain that we took a specific

1240
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:25,270
approach.
We knew going into it.

1241
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:26,403
I had been just stating this idea for 
years and I'd been fascinated with 

1242
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:35,521
scientology going back to the late 
eighties when I was a student and then I

1243
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:37,840
remember in [inaudible] 90 or 
[inaudible] 91,

1244
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:38,733
I took a tour around the l Ron Hubbard 
life exhibit there on Hollywood 

1245
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,670
Boulevard and,
and had this weird feeling of,

1246
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,800
if you've ever gone in where you just 
think wow,

1247
00:58:47,801 --> 00:58:48,634
it's like they took a person who was 
kind of an average Scifi writer and 

1248
00:58:52,781 --> 00:58:56,200
attempted to make him sound like he was 
the second coming of Jesus.

1249
00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:00,820
And so everything is spun and it's,
it's just a weird feeling,

1250
00:59:00,821 --> 00:59:01,654
you know,
seeing a whole museum dedicated to 

1251
00:59:03,641 --> 00:59:08,641
someone who seems to have been a 
relatively unremarkable person.

1252
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,680
Do you know what I mean?
And so they're working extremely hard.

1253
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:13,303
Say like he was one of the youngest ever
Eagle Scouts to ever qualify in the 

1254
00:59:16,481 --> 00:59:17,960
state of Montana.
And you're like,

1255
00:59:17,961 --> 00:59:19,360
well,
and I was like,

1256
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,480
my dad was an eagle scout.

1257
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:26,780
And um,
and so then I remember halfway through I

1258
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:27,590
thought,
well this is,

1259
00:59:27,590 --> 00:59:28,423
this was funny for 10 minutes.
And then an hour later when you're on 

1260
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:32,210
this guided tour,
I've had enough.

1261
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,820
And so I said,
I really need to leave.

1262
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:35,290
Where do you need to go?
Like,

1263
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,133
what's so important that it's more 
important than you've seen in the rest 

1264
00:59:37,761 --> 00:59:38,594
of the.
And I suddenly felt under pressure that 

1265
00:59:39,891 --> 00:59:41,570
uncomfortable feeling of like,
oh wow.

1266
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:42,943
And I had to pretend that I needed to be
somewhere just to get out of the 

1267
00:59:45,441 --> 00:59:46,280
building.
Anyway,

1268
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,910
so years go by and I think I'd love to 
make a program about it and then I could

1269
00:59:49,911 --> 00:59:53,030
never quite find that I approached them 
and they said,

1270
00:59:53,031 --> 00:59:54,680
um,
long story short,

1271
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:55,710
we're not really interested.
We,

1272
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,200
you know,
we,

1273
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,010
they took me on a tour of the celebrity 
center.

1274
00:59:58,011 --> 00:59:58,844
They strung me along for a bit,
but it was pretty clear quite quickly 

1275
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:02,390
that they weren't going to let me in.

1276
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:03,583
So a few more years went by and I was 
approached by a Hollywood producer 

1277
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:09,920
called Simon Chinn,
who,

1278
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,040
who,
who made a man on wire and searching for

1279
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,470
sugar man.
So He's,

1280
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:16,250
you know,
he's well credentialed and he's like,

1281
01:00:16,251 --> 01:00:17,084
you know,
you should do something about 

1282
01:00:17,301 --> 01:00:18,134
scientology.
I gave him the spiel about why I hadn't 

1283
01:00:19,521 --> 01:00:21,770
because they won't let me in.
And as you know,

1284
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:24,530
my way of making documentaries is by 
invitation,

1285
01:00:24,531 --> 01:00:25,364
you know,
I make an approach and people say yes 

1286
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,920
and they let me in.
Oh,

1287
01:00:27,921 --> 01:00:30,260
you're very polite in Europe and 
actually,

1288
01:00:30,261 --> 01:00:34,280
you know,
I've done whatever in a big game hunting

1289
01:00:34,281 --> 01:00:37,500
or the Westboro Baptist church or Gurus,
you know,

1290
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:38,900
in India.
But it's always,

1291
01:00:38,901 --> 01:00:40,040
I say like,
can we come and film?

1292
01:00:40,041 --> 01:00:41,950
And they say yes and we do it.
So I,

1293
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:43,303
I just couldn't get my head around how 
you make a film where the people don't 

1294
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:47,930
want you to make the film.

1295
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:48,883
As I knew they didn't.
And have it be still true to what I do 

1296
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:53,774
in some way.
And I didn't want it to be a kind of 

1297
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:58,370
just poking them for the sake of it,
type of thing.

1298
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:01,700
Anyway,
we decided that there was a way of doing

1299
01:01:01,701 --> 01:01:02,534
it,
using reenactments in which we took a 

1300
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:04,964
sort of approach to the reenactments,
where the whole process of casting and 

1301
01:01:09,711 --> 01:01:10,544
reenacting,
how you do scientology using actors was 

1302
01:01:14,451 --> 01:01:15,350
filmed.
In other words,

1303
01:01:15,351 --> 01:01:16,184
we filmed casting a character to play 
Tom Cruise costing an actor to play 

1304
01:01:19,491 --> 01:01:20,324
David miscavige a roleplaying the 
different lines and used x 

1305
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:28,430
scientologists to kind of co-direct.
So they were like,

1306
01:01:28,431 --> 01:01:29,270
this is how,
yeah,

1307
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:32,330
this is how you do it and this is what 
scientology is.

1308
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:34,940
And this was what it was like when I was
in scientology.

1309
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:36,463
And really a part of it was knowing that
once we did that in and around 

1310
01:01:39,651 --> 01:01:40,484
Hollywood,
because Hollywood is so central to 

1311
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:42,614
scientology,
they would get wind of what we were 

1312
01:01:44,571 --> 01:01:47,810
doing and would start coming to us.

1313
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,003
So there'd be this wraparound of them 
and sure they shut up and stop filming 

1314
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:54,020
us.
Uh,

1315
01:01:54,021 --> 01:01:54,854
and it turns out they were making a 
documentary about me making my film 

1316
01:01:57,861 --> 01:02:00,700
about scientology.
So then it becomes this sort of whole,

1317
01:02:00,701 --> 01:02:02,570
when is that getting released?
January.

1318
01:02:02,571 --> 01:02:02,931
It's,
it's,

1319
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:04,490
it's out in the UK.
In October.

1320
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,080
January.
Not Mean Yours.

1321
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,520
The one on you.
Oh,

1322
01:02:07,521 --> 01:02:09,320
there one.
Um,

1323
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:11,120
you know,
I think it'll come out.

1324
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,420
It's a great question.
I,

1325
01:02:13,421 --> 01:02:14,254
I'm surprised it's not out yet.
I think it'll come out probably in 

1326
01:02:18,141 --> 01:02:18,974
January.
I don't.

1327
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:20,243
And what do you think it'll be about?
I think it'll be a lot like what they 

1328
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:27,840
have done to other journalists.
They did one to give me.

1329
01:02:27,841 --> 01:02:30,390
They did one on um,
Larry,

1330
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,520
right.
They do them on x,

1331
01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:35,340
scientologists midair of sufficient kind
of profile.

1332
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:38,370
It will be a 10 to 15 minute thing.

1333
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:39,150
They,
they,

1334
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,983
they,
they'll extract any photograph where I 

1335
01:02:42,241 --> 01:02:43,570
look like a Dick,
you know,

1336
01:02:43,571 --> 01:02:44,404
what I look ugly or ludicrous.
Any ill advised bit of publicity I ever 

1337
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:50,820
did where I was promoting a series and I
was like,

1338
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,673
it looked goofy.
They'll say like this is a serious 

1339
01:02:54,211 --> 01:02:55,044
journalist and then they'll take quotes 
from interviews out of context to make 

1340
01:02:58,051 --> 01:03:00,930
me sound like a,
either a goofball or,

1341
01:03:00,931 --> 01:03:04,980
or kind of malicious a deceiver.
And um,

1342
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,113
you know,
if you want to really see the DNA of 

1343
01:03:07,411 --> 01:03:09,480
scientology,
I often think because occasionally I get

1344
01:03:09,481 --> 01:03:11,400
caught in this mindset of like,
you know,

1345
01:03:11,401 --> 01:03:13,440
what is,
so what is it?

1346
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,513
Just another religion.
There's no better or worse than other 

1347
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:18,810
religions really.
And then some,

1348
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,060
you know,
sometimes you can slightly lose,

1349
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:21,953
you go native slightly or you're on 
their websites and your thing like it 

1350
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:24,930
covered.
Some of this makes sense.

1351
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,130
But if you look at how they attack their
enemies,

1352
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,360
they're there.
So unlike other religions,

1353
01:03:32,361 --> 01:03:34,440
certainly unlike Christianity for the 
most part,

1354
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:35,663
so official scientology's pronouncements
when they attack x members and 

1355
01:03:39,181 --> 01:03:44,181
journalists are so sort of tabloid and 
childish and so malicious and nasty,

1356
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:48,300
you really see into something deep about
them,

1357
01:03:48,330 --> 01:03:49,770
their mindset,
because their view is,

1358
01:03:49,771 --> 01:03:52,590
you mentioned,
is that if you're a suppressive person,

1359
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:53,513
I,
someone who's attempting to hold 

1360
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:55,464
scientology back then you are fair game.
Anything they could do almost anything 

1361
01:04:01,530 --> 01:04:05,820
to try and put you out of business.
Do you think that these documentaries,

1362
01:04:05,821 --> 01:04:09,360
whether it's going clear the book by 
Lawrence Wright or the other woman,

1363
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:13,590
what was the name of Janet Reitman was 
her bucket inside scientology.

1364
01:04:13,591 --> 01:04:14,424
You think that all this data,
this accumulative data reaches any of 

1365
01:04:17,791 --> 01:04:19,830
the members that are inside scientology?
They don't.

1366
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,100
They don't ever examined it.

1367
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:22,500
Oh No,
no way.

1368
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:23,390
It's,
it's a,

1369
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,340
it's considered end theater,
which is a scientology term.

1370
01:04:26,341 --> 01:04:30,010
It means in turbulator good data.
I love guy.

1371
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:33,480
This is like catnip to explaining this 
stuff kind of.

1372
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,460
I just,
it's like I said,

1373
01:04:35,461 --> 01:04:40,210
I was steeped in it for three years.
Kind of absorbing all your whole life or

1374
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:43,200
what?
Not Constantly but,

1375
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:47,070
but you know,
you would spend a few days kind of hours

1376
01:04:47,071 --> 01:04:47,904
would go by the end of it.
You were emerging like have I learned 

1377
01:04:50,161 --> 01:04:53,430
anything?
All I know now is just absurd terms.

1378
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,920
The no use to anyone like and Feta and.
But in turbulators data energies,

1379
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,250
fader is Dayton's a spirits.
Data is spiritual positive,

1380
01:05:02,251 --> 01:05:04,650
spiritual energy,
but interpolated is bad.

1381
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,360
So it's basically.
And Theater.

1382
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:09,020
It's kind of bad for your energy.
I think so.

1383
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:09,863
It's [inaudible] to,
for you to be in scientology and it can 

1384
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:16,890
be exposed to anything negative,
anything critical of scientology,

1385
01:05:16,891 --> 01:05:20,980
so encouraged to be off the internet and
to be off,

1386
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,843
you know,
don't consume anything you think might 

1387
01:05:23,021 --> 01:05:23,854
be critical.

1388
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:26,230
They're encouraged to be off the 
internet.

1389
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,423
Wow.
Well I should say I should say that 

1390
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:33,580
applies to people within the sea org,
in the inner circle of scientology and I

1391
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:34,923
explain that it's a really important 
distinction because I'm absolutely 

1392
01:05:39,251 --> 01:05:42,700
certain that there's plenty of extremely
nice,

1393
01:05:42,701 --> 01:05:43,534
well adjusted scientologists people who 
consider themselves scientologists 

1394
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:48,880
neighbor.
There's a really nice guy,

1395
01:05:48,881 --> 01:05:53,170
betty was and I'm sure I'm.
Everything I hear about Beck,

1396
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,780
the musician is that he's a nice guy and
um,

1397
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:57,990
you know,
I'm sure Giovanni Ribisi isn't,

1398
01:05:57,991 --> 01:06:00,520
is a nice guy and yeah.
Really?

1399
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,620
You didn't know that that guy's in.
Yeah.

1400
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,360
Who?
And Jenna Elfman.

1401
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:06,370
I mean she makes sense.
Really.

1402
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,350
Juliette Lewis.
Yeah,

1403
01:06:08,530 --> 01:06:10,930
I bet she's nice.
I bet she's very nice.

1404
01:06:10,970 --> 01:06:12,430
She,
she and I have gone back and forth.

1405
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,340
We've talked to each other through a 
messages on twitter.

1406
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:16,433
Yeah.
How did it get her in talk to Danny 

1407
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:19,323
Masterson?

1408
01:06:20,230 --> 01:06:24,940
He's from easily that 17th show he's 
into.

1409
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:26,430
Yeah.
Woo.

1410
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,120
And Jason Lee,
I think.

1411
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,880
I think he might be out.
You know who I mean?

1412
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:32,080
My name is.
Oh yeah,

1413
01:06:32,081 --> 01:06:33,130
that guy's in.
Yeah,

1414
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,030
man.
You,

1415
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,100
you didn't spend very long down the 
rabbit hole.

1416
01:06:36,550 --> 01:06:38,430
Well,
my rabbit hole was not limited.

1417
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:41,260
I try to avoid any rabbit hole that 
involve celebrities,

1418
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:45,880
but scientology is predicated on one 
thing l Ron Hubbard got right.

1419
01:06:45,881 --> 01:06:48,250
Was the idea that if you get celebrities
in,

1420
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:49,630
yes,
then you,

1421
01:06:49,930 --> 01:06:53,380
you've got a kind of golden ticket to 
reaching the masses.

1422
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,371
Yeah.
Um,

1423
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:56,860
I jokingly thought about joining when I 
first came here,

1424
01:06:56,861 --> 01:06:57,850
I was like,
maybe that's the move,

1425
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:58,703
just get it become a scientologist.
You could make a documentary about 

1426
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:01,774
scientology.
That would be totally different because 

1427
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:04,233
I'm actually,
maybe we've blown it by even talking 

1428
01:07:06,221 --> 01:07:07,990
about it,
but if you'd gone under,

1429
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:11,020
I don't think they would listen.

1430
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,690
They would probably fucking hate me.
Well,

1431
01:07:13,750 --> 01:07:14,583
it depends what you've got out there.
It's too late to a documentary maker 

1432
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,004
either.
We don't have that sort of attention 

1433
01:07:19,271 --> 01:07:20,440
span that you have.
You could,

1434
01:07:20,441 --> 01:07:22,080
you could go,
you could have gone undercover.

1435
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:22,943
They,
you would have been such a great scalp 

1436
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,060
for them.
They would have.

1437
01:07:25,061 --> 01:07:27,730
Absolutely.
Because when was the last time you heard

1438
01:07:27,731 --> 01:07:30,610
of an established celebrity actor 
joining,

1439
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,960
joining like,
um,

1440
01:07:33,130 --> 01:07:34,960
I mean,
can you imagine if maybe they can.

1441
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:39,070
I mean that's when will smith,
there was a sniff that he might be going

1442
01:07:39,071 --> 01:07:42,400
that way and,
and it went and it didn't pan out.

1443
01:07:42,820 --> 01:07:43,653
But um,
that was an unbeliever and they were 

1444
01:07:44,891 --> 01:07:45,724
trying.
There was a rumor that David Beckham 

1445
01:07:46,631 --> 01:07:47,464
might be flirting with it,
but I mean none of these things were 

1446
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:53,800
born out.
What they could do for you if you were a

1447
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:54,634
David Beckham or maybe even for me,
is they could act as like a gang that's 

1448
01:07:59,711 --> 01:08:02,470
sort of like your policy covers your 
back.

1449
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:04,120
Absolutely.
I think that'd be.

1450
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,720
And when I was doing the film,
I went in a totally undercover,

1451
01:08:07,721 --> 01:08:10,540
but I went in Norway for a sequence in 
the film.

1452
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:13,630
I just to sort of keep myself grounded,
to keep it all real,

1453
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:14,613
you know,
because one of the challenges with when 

1454
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:16,754
you're not exposed,
you're not actually having day to day 

1455
01:08:18,381 --> 01:08:20,270
contact with the subject that you're 
covering.

1456
01:08:20,271 --> 01:08:25,271
It's very easy to slip into a us and 
them mentality of your own and like,

1457
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,360
Ooh,
scary scientologists Ooh,

1458
01:08:27,361 --> 01:08:29,060
they're bad.
And actually,

1459
01:08:29,061 --> 01:08:29,930
um,
you know,

1460
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,040
they're not,
they're good people,

1461
01:08:31,041 --> 01:08:31,770
many of them.
And,

1462
01:08:31,770 --> 01:08:35,140
and so I wanted to make them real and I 
went along to um,

1463
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:36,263
scientology,
Oregon just sort of chatted to some 

1464
01:08:38,451 --> 01:08:39,141
people until,
you know,

1465
01:08:39,141 --> 01:08:43,350
I'm a make documentaries and things.
I'm interested in this subject,

1466
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:44,870
you know,
what's it all about?

1467
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:45,704
And they really did.
One of the things they do is a fairly 

1468
01:08:48,321 --> 01:08:49,154
hard sell,
but you got the impression that they 

1469
01:08:51,981 --> 01:08:56,720
would 100 percent kind of take your 
money.

1470
01:08:59,150 --> 01:09:00,350
No,
I don't accept you.

1471
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:03,020
They would tell you money,
but they would absolutely,

1472
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:05,150
I think be right on it.
I don't know.

1473
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:05,720
I,
you know,

1474
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,140
I kind of lost confidence in.
I was going to say 100 percent.

1475
01:09:09,141 --> 01:09:10,980
You got to have your back and be or 
gang.

1476
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:13,010
But I don't know if I really did have 
that sense.

1477
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:14,210
I think if you.
If they know,

1478
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,600
if they knew you were a celebrity,
if they thought you were,

1479
01:09:17,750 --> 01:09:20,450
they would really go to the.
You would get special treatment.

1480
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:23,780
I was in San Diego when I was filming 
this television show.

1481
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:24,614
We had a few hours downtime and they had
one of these booths set up where you 

1482
01:09:27,681 --> 01:09:30,680
would go over there and hold onto the 
those cans.

1483
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:33,680
You meet her and I did all that.
How long did you.

1484
01:09:33,681 --> 01:09:35,720
How many sessions did you do or just 
one?

1485
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:38,240
Just one while I was there and it was 
pretty good,

1486
01:09:38,241 --> 01:09:38,970
wasn't it?

1487
01:09:38,970 --> 01:09:41,300
It was boring.
Was it the guy that.

1488
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:44,150
The guy who I got was very 
unenthusiastic.

1489
01:09:44,151 --> 01:09:46,340
He's just.
It seemed like something.

1490
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:49,880
They were exposed to them.
You're supposed to be unenthusiastic.

1491
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,750
Well,
on the meters,

1492
01:09:51,770 --> 01:09:54,260
there's a script for how it's called 
being an auditor.

1493
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:55,123
When you.
When someone's auditing you in a sense 

1494
01:09:55,911 --> 01:09:57,800
being the therapist,
they have a script.

1495
01:09:57,801 --> 01:09:58,670
They have to.
It's called.

1496
01:09:58,700 --> 01:09:59,533
They have to sit there comfortably,
but they are not supposed to show any 

1497
01:10:03,351 --> 01:10:06,950
emotion when they're auditing,
you know,

1498
01:10:07,010 --> 01:10:07,843
he's doing it publicly to holding onto 
this thing and asking me questions as 

1499
01:10:10,641 --> 01:10:13,240
you read in the needle and saying yes,
and did he say that?

1500
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,113
Is there a prior something that there's 
a whole script they'd sort of say and 

1501
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,540
did you have to say like,
I had back pain and then they're like,

1502
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:23,330
why would you remember what road you 
went down with your,

1503
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:24,380
with what you were saying?

1504
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:29,060
Partly just remember thinking this guy.
It's nothing that's special.

1505
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:31,270
Yeah.
The guy seemed like he,

1506
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:32,413
they were forcing them to do it.
He didn't seem like this is something 

1507
01:10:34,251 --> 01:10:35,084
that he was interested in is just really
not interested in what he was doing and 

1508
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,540
he seemed like a volunteer.
Like that's interesting.

1509
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,374
I mean if on the,
when they're auditing they're supposed 

1510
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:46,870
to be somewhat blank.
A big thing in scientology is,

1511
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:47,743
is I'm sort of being comfortable in 
yourself and not like learning how to 

1512
01:10:51,711 --> 01:10:55,760
stare at someone that there's a drill 
that we do in the film where you have to

1513
01:10:55,761 --> 01:10:59,840
sit and stare at someone without saying 
anything literally for like minutes,

1514
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:01,740
if not hours.
And it's like,

1515
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,490
it's actually a powerful tool because 
it's slightly,

1516
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,131
it's all about,
um,

1517
01:11:05,131 --> 01:11:06,850
I'm,
I'm unembarrassed bubble,

1518
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:07,550
you know,
I'm gonna,

1519
01:11:07,550 --> 01:11:08,383
I'm gonna not,
I'm going to own any sort of sense of 

1520
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:14,040
awkwardness by just like I'm impermeable
to any kind of social

1521
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:16,230
influence you think you can put on me.
Right.

1522
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:20,250
It's one of the paradoxes of being kind 
of really controlling religious movement

1523
01:11:20,251 --> 01:11:24,030
because so much of it is about 
controlling yourself.

1524
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,880
Do you know what I mean?
And not allowing other people's thoughts

1525
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,680
are negative actions to control you,
control you.

1526
01:11:28,681 --> 01:11:29,514
And actually a big thing as well.
And one of the things Tom Cruz talks 

1527
01:11:31,441 --> 01:11:36,441
about when he's in his video is a pts,
a SP confronting shuttering suppression.

1528
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:41,800
Uh,
um,

1529
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:44,040
I don't think I said they got my acronym
right.

1530
01:11:44,041 --> 01:11:46,080
But anyway,
his thing is,

1531
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
he's like,
when he says like,

1532
01:11:48,330 --> 01:11:49,163
one of the best things he learned in 
scientology was how to confront and 

1533
01:11:51,661 --> 01:11:52,800
shatter suppression.
Right.

1534
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:53,843
So anytime you see him in an interview 
and there's a few of them on youtube 

1535
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:57,593
where he's big,
he thinks he's getting a cheeky 

1536
01:11:59,311 --> 01:12:00,144
question.
You can see he kinda gets a steely look 

1537
01:12:02,611 --> 01:12:05,430
where it's a sort of it not exactly 
adversarial.

1538
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:06,840
It's just like,
no,

1539
01:12:06,841 --> 01:12:09,780
you're out of line buddy and we're not 
going to allow our interview.

1540
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:10,643
Yeah.
It was devastating for his career and 

1541
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,200
short term he recovered from it,
but there was.

1542
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:21,260
That was a window into madness and into 
what he's really all about.

1543
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,760
When you know that's the scary part.
I mean,

1544
01:12:23,761 --> 01:12:27,210
as much as I say like there's a big 
chunk of it that feels kind of valid,

1545
01:12:27,211 --> 01:12:28,770
a normal,
maybe even therapeutic,

1546
01:12:28,771 --> 01:12:32,910
but when you tip into thinking that 
you're the only one that you have,

1547
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:33,953
you're the authority on mental illness 
and that's dangerous individual issues 

1548
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:39,684
with people that you have not diagnosed.
You don't have any medical training 

1549
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:42,924
whatsoever.
You don't know what their specific 

1550
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:45,384
neurochemistry is.
You don't know the effect of the 

1551
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:48,264
medication and whether it's enhancing or
hurting them and you just have this 

1552
01:12:51,211 --> 01:12:52,044
blanket view of psychiatry.
That was a an issue that l Ron Hubbard 

1553
01:12:56,101 --> 01:12:58,620
had,
and if you go down sunset,

1554
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:03,150
sunset on sunset,
psychiatry kills.

1555
01:13:03,150 --> 01:13:05,190
It's psychiatry,
the industry of death.

1556
01:13:05,870 --> 01:13:10,350
That's a fun often and that's one of 
their centers,

1557
01:13:10,351 --> 01:13:10,901
right?
Yeah.

1558
01:13:10,901 --> 01:13:11,734
If you go in there,
they'll explain the CC her citizens' 

1559
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:18,540
Commission on Human Rights and here's my
issue with that.

1560
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:23,190
I think prescription drugs are 
overprescribed.

1561
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,533
I think there's a real argument that 
there's a lot of people that are on 

1562
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:29,460
antidepressants that shouldn't be on 
antidepressants.

1563
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:31,740
I think there's a lot of natural 
alternatives.

1564
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:32,574
One of them being exercise,
one of them being and enhancing your 

1565
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:39,630
standing in life in terms of like what 
you do for a living or where you live or

1566
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:41,280
you know the people that you hang out 
with.

1567
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:42,293
All those things can affect the way you 
feel and that can be interpreted as 

1568
01:13:45,841 --> 01:13:47,020
depression.
There's a lot of.

1569
01:13:47,021 --> 01:13:47,854
I mean there's a reason.
If your life is shit of all the aspects 

1570
01:13:50,971 --> 01:13:52,410
of your life is shit.
You feel bad,

1571
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:54,310
the solution is not a pill,
right?

1572
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:59,780
So I think in some ways they've got 
something to say that makes some sort of

1573
01:13:59,941 --> 01:14:03,500
sense in a weird way.
That's the dangerous part because it's a

1574
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:04,334
sec.
It's with scientology into sex with a 

1575
01:14:05,491 --> 01:14:08,940
totally valid social critique.
Right.

1576
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:11,980
The trouble is if you are,
if you have someone who's

1577
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:16,450
heavily psychotic and it's not,
it's not a medication induced psychosis.

1578
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:17,433
Psychosis is a real medical phenomenon 
and a scientology is not going to take 

1579
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:24,040
them on.
If you go to scientology and say,

1580
01:14:24,041 --> 01:14:26,860
I'm interested in scientology,
I've had a couple of psychotic breaks.

1581
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:28,203
Um,
but I really think you could help me 

1582
01:14:29,291 --> 01:14:30,310
out.
They're not going to say,

1583
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:31,271
oh,
come with us.

1584
01:14:31,271 --> 01:14:31,810
We'll,
they'll,

1585
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:32,643
they'll run a mile from you.
So they critiquing people who they have 

1586
01:14:35,921 --> 01:14:38,770
no intention of helping themselves.
Oh Wow.

1587
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:40,480
Yeah.
And if you say,

1588
01:14:40,481 --> 01:14:41,470
oh,
and by the way,

1589
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:46,830
I've used some in the past,
I was medicated for my psychosis.

1590
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:47,561
They'll say,
well,

1591
01:14:47,561 --> 01:14:50,620
that disqualifies you from treatment.
When I went to my one,

1592
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:52,870
they said,
if you thought forms of intervention,

1593
01:14:52,871 --> 01:14:55,600
have you had in the past,
have you done any sort of psychiatry?

1594
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:57,040
Have you had any problems like that?
And I said,

1595
01:14:57,041 --> 01:14:57,601
well,
no,

1596
01:14:57,601 --> 01:14:58,630
but I've had,
you know,

1597
01:14:59,350 --> 01:15:01,860
a little bit of therapy over the years 
as well.

1598
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:03,370
What have you done?
I said,

1599
01:15:03,371 --> 01:15:04,204
I did a few sessions of CBT.
Cognitive behavior therapy is kind of 

1600
01:15:07,181 --> 01:15:08,014
bog standard,
talking about problems or things that 

1601
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,370
you could do differently.
The woman's like,

1602
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:13,010
oh,
okay.

1603
01:15:13,010 --> 01:15:14,620
Uh,
just give me five minutes.

1604
01:15:14,621 --> 01:15:15,454
Okay.
And she left the room to check whether 

1605
01:15:16,691 --> 01:15:19,150
that disqualified me and came back.
Oh yeah.

1606
01:15:19,151 --> 01:15:20,050
That's not a problem.
Okay,

1607
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:20,884
let's carry on.
But if you had done on some sort of 

1608
01:15:22,340 --> 01:15:23,173
medication,
said I was on Zyprexa for 10 years 

1609
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:29,760
because I had an episode where I thought
I was a poached egg for a few weeks that

1610
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:32,640
she would've said she would have said,
oh,

1611
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:34,570
well good luck with that.
And um,

1612
01:15:35,260 --> 01:15:36,093
you know,
don't let the door hit you on the way 

1613
01:15:36,761 --> 01:15:38,020
out.
Oh Wow.

1614
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:40,600
So they're not interested in treating 
people that have had treatment?

1615
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:41,463
No.
Oh,

1616
01:15:41,470 --> 01:15:42,240
that's weird.
No,

1617
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,690
they say good,
you know,

1618
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:45,580
tough break on this live.

1619
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:50,440
Good luck in your next life.
They really check that.

1620
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,870
But I'm pretty sure that's the case.
Oh man,

1621
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:53,733
that's fascinating.
And there's an intro if you want to 

1622
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:55,594
read,
we don't go into this in the 

1623
01:15:56,021 --> 01:15:58,630
documentary,
but if you can read up on,

1624
01:15:59,290 --> 01:16:00,123
um,
on the Internet and about cases where 

1625
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:06,580
there's been people who had mental 
illness either within scientology,

1626
01:16:06,581 --> 01:16:07,414
I mean,
perhaps the most famous scandal within 

1627
01:16:09,461 --> 01:16:14,461
scientology or the most notorious to 
scientology watches was the case of Lisa

1628
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,360
Mcpherson.
Do you know about her?

1629
01:16:16,450 --> 01:16:17,650
She's the one that died.
Yeah,

1630
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:20,500
she's,
she's done in detail in,

1631
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:22,120
um,
inside scientology.

1632
01:16:22,121 --> 01:16:25,390
And the Janet Reitman book,
she was a paid up scientologists.

1633
01:16:25,391 --> 01:16:26,800
Took it very,
very seriously.

1634
01:16:26,801 --> 01:16:29,810
A young woman,
maybe 30 and um,

1635
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:30,663
she had a psychotic episode in Florida 
and instead of being taken for a given 

1636
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:38,643
bed care in a facility,
she was taken by scientologists from a 

1637
01:16:42,131 --> 01:16:42,964
hospital and I'm more or less 
sequestered in a hotel for a week or 

1638
01:16:48,641 --> 01:16:49,474
maybe longer and,
and died in the hands of the 

1639
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:54,640
scientology.
What was the cause of death?

1640
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:58,360
I believe it was dehydration.
We should double check on that.

1641
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:00,550
Wow.
That's a rough way to go.

1642
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:04,600
Yeah.
And she'd been having,

1643
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:06,220
you know,
total psychotic break.

1644
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:10,400
She was attacking people in the who were
attempting to,

1645
01:17:10,490 --> 01:17:11,323
you know,
take care or holding her hostage 

1646
01:17:13,011 --> 01:17:16,370
depending on how you define it.
And um,

1647
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:17,773
you know,
there was a whole script that Hubbard 

1648
01:17:19,251 --> 01:17:21,110
had for dealing with,
um,

1649
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:24,920
people in psychosis,
but I don't think it was,

1650
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:26,630
you know,
medically supported.

1651
01:17:26,631 --> 01:17:28,710
It was basically involved ignoring them,

1652
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:32,180
keeping them secluded,
kind of locking them in a room.

1653
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:33,793
Now I saw an interview with you where 
you were talking about someone who used 

1654
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:38,540
to be a former scientologist a woman.
Uh,

1655
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,400
she was,
she wasn't a former scientologist.

1656
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:43,070
She had gone undercover to sort of 
investigate that.

1657
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,513
And uh,
you were talking about the auditing 

1658
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:48,800
having a positive benefit.

1659
01:17:49,390 --> 01:17:51,490
Yes.
I think it probably does.

1660
01:17:51,491 --> 01:17:53,520
I mean,
I think any kind of bolted on,

1661
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:54,490
on you.
Yeah,

1662
01:17:54,491 --> 01:17:56,500
I mean,
the editing I did,

1663
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,490
I only did one session and that was 
with,

1664
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,650
you know,
the main guy in the film.

1665
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:06,700
It's a guy called Marty Rathbun and he 
was in it.

1666
01:18:06,730 --> 01:18:07,563
There's a sense in which the film is as 
much about him as it is about 

1667
01:18:09,401 --> 01:18:10,450
scientology.
He was,

1668
01:18:10,930 --> 01:18:13,000
he was a Mr. fix it.
Within Scientology,

1669
01:18:13,001 --> 01:18:14,860
he was the number two to David 
miscavige.

1670
01:18:14,861 --> 01:18:15,694
David miscavige is the guy who took over
in 1986 or thereabouts from l Ron 

1671
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:21,580
Hubbard and has been running it ever 
since.

1672
01:18:21,940 --> 01:18:24,500
He's an unaccountable leader who,
uh,

1673
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,920
is in,
in essence the pope of scientology.

1674
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:27,783
And there are many allegations of him 
being physically abusive towards his 

1675
01:18:31,091 --> 01:18:31,924
followers.
Marty Rathmann was his right hand man 

1676
01:18:33,611 --> 01:18:34,444
for many years.
Marty Rathman left in 2004 or 

1677
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,280
thereabouts,
and he was so,

1678
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:39,123
he sort of our deep throat in the film,
but he also cops to the fact that when 

1679
01:18:43,031 --> 01:18:43,864
he was in scientology,
he was involved in all kinds of devious 

1680
01:18:48,100 --> 01:18:52,450
covert activity involving a private 
investigators,

1681
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,210
destruction of documents.

1682
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:59,050
And I'm also certain amount of physical 
violence himself,

1683
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:02,470
which he has apologized for.
And so he,

1684
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:03,304
uh,
it becomes a sort of examination of him 

1685
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:06,124
and his ability to,
the fact that he's been seduced by this 

1686
01:19:09,641 --> 01:19:12,820
thing and it's still in certain ways,
it's still in him,

1687
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:13,810
you know,
by,

1688
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:15,190
by almost,
by definition,

1689
01:19:15,191 --> 01:19:17,110
you can't be in something that long and 
that,

1690
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:20,110
you know,
Leah Remini was a celebrity parishioner,

1691
01:19:20,111 --> 01:19:20,944
right?
She was,

1692
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,710
she was going around the celebrity 
century,

1693
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,240
was doing scientology,
but she was not in the CEO.

1694
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:26,133
The CEO gets this.
Clergy is the intersect is the 

1695
01:19:27,551 --> 01:19:31,750
difference between someone who goes to a
Catholic church a few times a year,

1696
01:19:31,751 --> 01:19:35,500
right.
And eats communion and thinks and praise

1697
01:19:35,501 --> 01:19:37,060
a few times you.
That's okay.

1698
01:19:37,061 --> 01:19:39,070
You can be a scientologist in that way,
right?

1699
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:42,190
Which maybe your neighbor was,
but if you're in the seal,

1700
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:45,130
it's somewhere between being in the 
Vatican and being a monk.

1701
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:48,010
You take a vow of poverty,
you volunteer,

1702
01:19:48,011 --> 01:19:49,490
you think about poverty.
Yeah.

1703
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:52,930
You get paid below minimum wage,
tiny amounts.

1704
01:19:52,931 --> 01:19:53,764
You,
you're leading a kind of Spartan 

1705
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:58,870
existence to save the planet.
You sign a contract for 40 billion years

1706
01:19:58,871 --> 01:19:59,704
or something I think is interesting 
because it's supposed to cover all your 

1707
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:04,030
future lifetimes,
so when you come back,

1708
01:20:04,031 --> 01:20:06,480
you're still in the sea org.
They're um,

1709
01:20:07,660 --> 01:20:12,000
their slogan is something I vein our 
business or whatever the Latin is,

1710
01:20:12,001 --> 01:20:12,834
it's we come back,
meaning that we come back in future 

1711
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:18,270
lifetimes and we're still going to be in
the sea org anyway.

1712
01:20:18,630 --> 01:20:20,730
So it's really important to get that 
distinction because,

1713
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:22,433
you know,
I wouldn't want people to have the 

1714
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:27,930
impression that everyone in scientology 
is sort of going around in a uniform,

1715
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:32,730
marching around in a vow of poverty.
That's just the seal guys.

1716
01:20:32,731 --> 01:20:34,140
And most of them live down.

1717
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:37,050
Many of them lived down in Hemet,
outside La,

1718
01:20:37,560 --> 01:20:42,560
and that's where it's outside is if you 
had towards palm springs,

1719
01:20:42,661 --> 01:20:44,550
basically it's in the desert.
That's where they live.

1720
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:45,960
Yeah.
There's a pace down,

1721
01:20:46,140 --> 01:20:46,973
although they have some giant center 
down there that they're going to start 

1722
01:20:48,781 --> 01:20:49,890
producing movies.
Right.

1723
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:52,890
Well that there's a center in Hollywood 
that they've just bought.

1724
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:53,731
Yeah.
They've just,

1725
01:20:53,731 --> 01:20:54,481
in fact,
not just bought,

1726
01:20:54,481 --> 01:20:56,700
they're just refurbed it and they've 
opened it.

1727
01:20:56,880 --> 01:21:00,010
And they're going to open it,
which is bizarre because they have it.

1728
01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:00,853
There it is.
Yeah.

1729
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:01,873
Thirty dollars,
million dollar TV studio movie and TV 

1730
01:21:04,021 --> 01:21:06,070
Studio Complex in Hollywood.
That just opened the.

1731
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:08,400
But they have a complex in Hemet as 
well,

1732
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:09,443
bizarrely.
So I don't know why they need another 

1733
01:21:10,681 --> 01:21:11,514
one.
They like buying shit apparently at one 

1734
01:21:13,831 --> 01:21:17,220
point in time they were the number two 
real estate holders in Los Angeles.

1735
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:18,270
Well that.

1736
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:19,380
Yeah.
Yeah.

1737
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:21,930
That's amazing.
She's actually maybe Hollywood.

1738
01:21:21,990 --> 01:21:23,040
Not necessarily.
Maybe,

1739
01:21:23,190 --> 01:21:24,060
maybe,
I don't know,

1740
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:24,691
but,
but,

1741
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:25,524
but the um,
but I think a lot of that is to do with 

1742
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:28,673
someone explained this to me.
One of the rules about a nonprofit or 

1743
01:21:31,531 --> 01:21:32,364
about being a religion,
having their religious status is they 

1744
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:38,850
cannot hold their income,
like money that comes in has to be spent

1745
01:21:38,851 --> 01:21:42,030
otherwise they're in violation of their 
charitable status.

1746
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:44,780
So this is this.
Someone just told me this,

1747
01:21:44,781 --> 01:21:45,750
the other.
So in other words,

1748
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:46,603
it's in,
they have to kind of keep buying 

1749
01:21:47,911 --> 01:21:50,640
buildings because there needs to be a 
cash outflow,

1750
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:53,580
which sort of makes sense.
Right?

1751
01:21:53,581 --> 01:21:55,560
Yeah.
That's totally understandable.

1752
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:56,730
Yeah,
that makes sense.

1753
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,440
And then,
yeah,

1754
01:21:58,540 --> 01:21:59,373
so,
so,

1755
01:21:59,400 --> 01:21:59,940
but,
but,

1756
01:21:59,940 --> 01:22:02,340
so this Guy Marty rathbone who sort of 
my,

1757
01:22:02,341 --> 01:22:03,174
um,
my guide through scientology and he's a 

1758
01:22:04,590 --> 01:22:07,020
fascinating guy and Marty was in for how
long,

1759
01:22:07,890 --> 01:22:09,180
I want to say 24 years.

1760
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:11,820
Maybe it was 27 years,
but I think he said 27 years.

1761
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:13,700
He had a nice outfit on and a nice,
uh,

1762
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:15,270
he,
he uniform,

1763
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:16,133
he got the uniform.
He was holding ropes around the 

1764
01:22:17,551 --> 01:22:18,121
shoulder.
No,

1765
01:22:18,121 --> 01:22:19,450
what I will say this about him,
you know,

1766
01:22:19,451 --> 01:22:20,284
if you're in it and you're up at the top
echelons as he was you on some kind of 

1767
01:22:24,061 --> 01:22:26,110
crazy saifai adventure,
you know,

1768
01:22:26,550 --> 01:22:27,383
if you think about it,
think it's real liquor that you are 

1769
01:22:30,691 --> 01:22:33,210
living in a kind of,
I reality,

1770
01:22:33,211 --> 01:22:34,044
you know,
we'll get that rope because across the 

1771
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:38,150
chest you're saving planets.
What does this metals for it?

1772
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:39,520
Look at all his metals.
Know that,

1773
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:42,680
that thing that might be some of them 
are photoshops.

1774
01:22:43,140 --> 01:22:43,950
Oh really?
Yeah,

1775
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:45,990
like Katie did.
Well that might not be.

1776
01:22:45,991 --> 01:22:49,800
Some of them had metals.
Just to make fun of that might be a real

1777
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:52,110
one.
I don't know what the one that was above

1778
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:53,640
it seems real right now.
Look at that.

1779
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:55,240
That's real.
Now what?

1780
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:58,070
He doesn't like that now because he's.
That's 30 years ago.

1781
01:22:58,080 --> 01:22:58,913
Amazing.
Is it that they give them military 

1782
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:00,714
metals?
I mean it looks like no different than 

1783
01:23:02,461 --> 01:23:04,050
what a general would have.
Yeah.

1784
01:23:04,440 --> 01:23:06,010
What does it mean?
Beautiful thing in a

1785
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:06,843
way.
I mean,

1786
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:09,100
yeah,
I mean it's an exciting life.

1787
01:23:09,140 --> 01:23:12,730
They probably wouldn't be doing the 
dishes in that outfit,

1788
01:23:12,731 --> 01:23:14,920
like that special occasions,
special occasions,

1789
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:16,053
and I'm sure he would get special 
treatment and I'm sure being in the 

1790
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:22,870
number two guy must have been amazing 
because you basically.

1791
01:23:23,050 --> 01:23:23,883
There's only really a number one,
which is David miscavige and then 

1792
01:23:26,621 --> 01:23:28,210
there's just everyone else.
Do you know what I mean?

1793
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:30,080
Oh,
well then there's Tom Cruise and then is

1794
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:32,470
there a Tom cruise is kind of number 
one,

1795
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:33,910
right?
Right up there.

1796
01:23:33,940 --> 01:23:34,181
It.
No,

1797
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:35,910
because actually there's a don't you 
remember in,

1798
01:23:35,950 --> 01:23:38,590
in,
in Lawrence Wright's book.

1799
01:23:38,591 --> 01:23:43,530
There's a bit where Tom Cruise explains,
I think maybe to Nazneen Bonnie rd.

1800
01:23:43,531 --> 01:23:46,270
Like his girlfriend at the time.
He says,

1801
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:49,060
don't you Like,
he's annoyed with his girlfriend.

1802
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:53,440
This is after it split up from a cruise?
No,

1803
01:23:53,441 --> 01:23:57,020
the one before the australian broad,
um,

1804
01:23:57,310 --> 01:23:59,530
you know,
nicole kidman thank kidman.

1805
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,313
WHo's who by the way,
she was considered an sp because her 

1806
01:24:04,451 --> 01:24:07,840
father was a psychiatrist,
I believe in any way,

1807
01:24:07,930 --> 01:24:08,630
so,
so,

1808
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:09,463
so he went out with a woman named bonnie
rd for awhile and there's a section in 

1809
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:13,834
going clear where they talk about,
I think ms dot gavin came around for 

1810
01:24:17,081 --> 01:24:19,800
dinner or something and it was,
and um,

1811
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,050
I think it was.
Anyway,

1812
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:26,010
his girlfriend at the time was having 
trouble understanding what ms dot savage

1813
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:31,020
was saying because he speaks quite fast 
and I'm like,

1814
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:33,010
wow,
what are you saying?

1815
01:24:33,150 --> 01:24:35,950
And tom cruise was really upset and 
said,

1816
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:36,793
why don't you get it this lrh?
Then there's david ms dot cop is what 

1817
01:24:40,991 --> 01:24:42,250
they call them,
their cob.

1818
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:43,770
And then there's me,
dude,

1819
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:46,690
you're doing a goddamn good tom cruise 
impression take.

1820
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,720
It's just be attaching this lrh then 
their cob and then there's me.

1821
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:53,790
you get it together.

1822
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,480
You're glip,
glip,

1823
01:24:55,520 --> 01:24:57,630
matt your clip.
Um,

1824
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,470
that's a very good impression.
It just got to be,

1825
01:24:59,471 --> 01:25:03,710
you know what it feels like.
I don't think I need scientology if like

1826
01:25:03,780 --> 01:25:08,240
I've called 270 milligrams given me a 
like a.

1827
01:25:08,241 --> 01:25:11,220
It's an oth.
I'm on ot five right now.

1828
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:12,680
Not morning.
Thunder is.

1829
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,113
I think I had that.
He makes this caveman coffee with some 

1830
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:21,730
emulsified mct oil in an ice coffee.
That's what I have every morning.

1831
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:22,564
What is the most qualified mct oil?
Mct oil that you can mix very easily 

1832
01:25:26,531 --> 01:25:30,940
with cold beverages or is mct oil or 
medium chain triglyceride oil?

1833
01:25:30,941 --> 01:25:35,380
It's the most nutritious aspects of 
coconut oil that are blended together.

1834
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:39,310
IT's they spin in a centrifuge extract 
the bushel.

1835
01:25:41,750 --> 01:25:45,580
You can get it anywhere.
Mct oil is readily available at any,

1836
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:47,373
any sort of health food store and a lot 
of erewhon and whole foods and those 

1837
01:25:50,891 --> 01:25:52,840
types of places carry.
I've never even heard of it.

1838
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:53,950
Can you know,
have coconut oil,

1839
01:25:53,951 --> 01:25:54,640
right?
Yeah.

1840
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:55,473
It's their.
They're healthy fats that are really 

1841
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:58,510
good for your brain.
Good stuff.

1842
01:25:58,550 --> 01:26:00,790
Yeah.
So it morning thunder,

1843
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:01,653
the point being it off,
but what a cop cop as chairman of the 

1844
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:09,164
board.
Ah,

1845
01:26:10,330 --> 01:26:11,860
there we go.
Cop rtc,

1846
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:15,440
there's cob and then there's me and then
there's glib,

1847
01:26:16,840 --> 01:26:17,450
glib,
nicholas,

1848
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:19,620
matt lauer,
and then there's ciantra fault.

1849
01:26:19,621 --> 01:26:20,454
It just below matt lauer.
So they have quite dim view of john 

1850
01:26:22,281 --> 01:26:23,910
travolta within science.
What,

1851
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,720
why this is such.
This is called a bud fucking.

1852
01:26:27,770 --> 01:26:30,610
What is it?
I think massage viewed,

1853
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:31,980
I don't know.
Marty raspbian top.

1854
01:26:32,060 --> 01:26:34,010
That's allegedly.
Can I throw an allegedly,

1855
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:36,020
allegedly they have a bad view of him.

1856
01:26:36,210 --> 01:26:38,870
Just pause everything now.
A lot of what I'm saying,

1857
01:26:38,871 --> 01:26:40,550
it's based on,
once he blew,

1858
01:26:40,551 --> 01:26:41,384
once he left,
marty rathbun spilled his guts on the 

1859
01:26:43,881 --> 01:26:44,714
internet in all,
you know,

1860
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:45,643
in the,
in order to let people know what was 

1861
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:50,054
going on and he kind of,
he was the biggest thing I would say in 

1862
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:57,230
sort of in terms of exposing scientology
for what it is,

1863
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:00,140
probably more probably in the history of
scientology.

1864
01:27:00,410 --> 01:27:01,243
John travolta's wife was on fear factor 
and I got to meet john travolta because 

1865
01:27:03,861 --> 01:27:06,200
his wife was in the finals.
She lost coolio.

1866
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:10,010
Who was a,
by the way,

1867
01:27:10,190 --> 01:27:11,023
you want to talk about a guy who 
performs very well under the influence 

1868
01:27:13,431 --> 01:27:14,264
of marijuana.
Coolio might be at the top of my list 

1869
01:27:16,041 --> 01:27:17,480
right there,
right up there with joey diaz,

1870
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,870
coolio,
uh,

1871
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:19,753
where they would open up his trailer and
it was like a cheech and chong and it 

1872
01:27:22,221 --> 01:27:23,054
was hilarious and he would go out there 
and he would perform these stocks just 

1873
01:27:26,541 --> 01:27:27,830
high as a kite.

1874
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,083
I mean,
just gone because you look in his eyes 

1875
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,190
were just glazed over and he would 
perform flawlessly.

1876
01:27:34,370 --> 01:27:37,610
And the last stunt involved balance,
it was his balance thing.

1877
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:38,713
And I had a conversation with him before
we did it and I was a unfortunately 

1878
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:43,760
stone cold sober at the time I believe.
And uh,

1879
01:27:43,790 --> 01:27:45,470
coolio was a,
he's like,

1880
01:27:45,471 --> 01:27:46,121
ah,
I've,

1881
01:27:46,121 --> 01:27:46,954
I've done this a million times in a 
million different lives and other 

1882
01:27:49,281 --> 01:27:51,590
universes.
I'm ready to do it right now.

1883
01:27:51,591 --> 01:27:52,940
I'm like,
get after it.

1884
01:27:52,950 --> 01:27:56,710
So good luck to you.
But I'm john travolta,

1885
01:27:56,711 --> 01:27:58,010
his wife.
What is her name again?

1886
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,200
Kelly kelly.
She's very,

1887
01:28:00,201 --> 01:28:03,580
very Nice,
very nice and a very.

1888
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:05,880
Seems so normal.
You know,

1889
01:28:05,881 --> 01:28:09,320
I had conversations with her and uh,
and she even sent me a gift.

1890
01:28:09,321 --> 01:28:12,110
There was some sort of protein powder 
that she was drinking,

1891
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,420
some,
some health drink that she was drinking.

1892
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:16,170
I asked her about it and she said,
you know,

1893
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,700
give me your address.
I'll have them sent to you and lunch.

1894
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:21,770
So she sent some to the studio.
I believe she was very nice.

1895
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:24,360
Credit.
Van susteren is assigned torches.

1896
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,650
fuck outta here.
that's the one thAt surprises me really.

1897
01:28:27,680 --> 01:28:29,200
Isn't she a june ms dot?
I would,

1898
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:30,753
I would have fox news.
Is she on the show journal and tone 

1899
01:28:34,701 --> 01:28:38,080
scale or not?
She be,

1900
01:28:38,360 --> 01:28:40,580
maybe there's a side,
maybe there's an exception.

1901
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:41,660
Well,
uh,

1902
01:28:41,660 --> 01:28:44,380
I met her as one once as well.
She seemed very nice as well.

1903
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:45,223
There's something about george carlin,
I'm sure she is nice and I'm sure you 

1904
01:28:48,651 --> 01:28:49,550
can be.
I mean,

1905
01:28:49,551 --> 01:28:51,380
not to sound like a broken record.
Again,

1906
01:28:51,381 --> 01:28:52,214
my neighbor who,
my former neighbor many years ago was a 

1907
01:28:53,931 --> 01:28:54,764
very nice guy and I've met a lot of 
scientologists inside of hollywood and 

1908
01:28:59,541 --> 01:29:00,374
they all have actory thing going on,
which is I would like to believe that 

1909
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:07,830
they are as nice as they are pretending 
to me,

1910
01:29:07,831 --> 01:29:09,560
but I'm not sure,
you know.

1911
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,670
Then actory thing like,
yes,

1912
01:29:11,671 --> 01:29:12,740
aNd I know,
uh,

1913
01:29:12,870 --> 01:29:13,703
I know one of my early experiences when 
I was talking to a scientologist when I 

1914
01:29:17,341 --> 01:29:22,341
was trying to first negotiate access to 
the church bacK in 2003 was I'd sent her

1915
01:29:23,461 --> 01:29:27,610
some old documentaries that I'd done,
so this is who I am,

1916
01:29:27,611 --> 01:29:30,060
this is what I do.
And she was on the phone.

1917
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:31,860
She said,
oh yeah,

1918
01:29:31,861 --> 01:29:32,694
I got the dvds and watching.
And she started laughing in the act of 

1919
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:40,590
talking about liKe a fake laugh.
Yeah.

1920
01:29:40,591 --> 01:29:42,060
And I say that didn't.
I was like,

1921
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:44,820
that didn't feel quite real.
Later on,

1922
01:29:44,821 --> 01:29:45,654
another person I knew who was a 
scientologist did the same thing where 

1923
01:29:48,031 --> 01:29:53,031
like I saw the thing you did on that is 
a desert pet peeve of mine.

1924
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:54,841
I Was like,
oh wow,

1925
01:29:54,841 --> 01:29:56,070
man.
There's a giant,

1926
01:29:56,310 --> 01:29:57,143
maybe that's part of what they do is 
sort of a similar kind of weird love 

1927
01:29:59,941 --> 01:30:00,774
bombing.

1928
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:02,700
I don't know.
Maybe that was just coincidence.

1929
01:30:02,710 --> 01:30:06,060
It makes sense because they're trying to
be influential and they're trying to.

1930
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:08,790
They're trying to be charming.
Yeah.

1931
01:30:09,590 --> 01:30:12,690
I find a lot of the scientologists that 
I've met that are actors,

1932
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:14,520
they're.
They're extremely charming.

1933
01:30:14,521 --> 01:30:15,840
Like there's one of the things you hear 
about tom cruise.

1934
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:17,630
He looks you in the eye.
He talks to you.

1935
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:20,790
Remember,
I'm make sure that's true.

1936
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,230
I mean they drill,
as I said,

1937
01:30:22,231 --> 01:30:23,064
they drill on looking people in the eye,
but let's just assume that that's his 

1938
01:30:26,071 --> 01:30:27,570
real behavior pattern.
Now.

1939
01:30:27,571 --> 01:30:29,320
It's a very good behavior.
Nice.

1940
01:30:29,880 --> 01:30:30,713
I'm in favor of positivity,
although I think the world needs 

1941
01:30:32,650 --> 01:30:33,483
negative people,
but I think there need to be some what 

1942
01:30:36,450 --> 01:30:37,860
do you.
But wait a minute,

1943
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:41,010
but the whole part of the ecology of 
life is to have been in the yang.

1944
01:30:41,140 --> 01:30:43,380
Yeah.
The one was positive then.

1945
01:30:43,900 --> 01:30:46,290
I mean it would be a little too much.
Well,

1946
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,350
it would be very strange if the world 
didn't become enlightened.

1947
01:30:49,620 --> 01:30:52,950
Like what if some pharmaceutical company
device,

1948
01:30:52,951 --> 01:30:55,780
some pill that eliminates all the 
negative aspects of humanity,

1949
01:30:55,781 --> 01:30:57,740
so we all just started taking it.
Yeah,

1950
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,490
I mean,
look how many people brush their teeth.

1951
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,540
pretty much everybody,
right?

1952
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:01,583
What if everybody started doing whatever
this is and this new thing which 

1953
01:31:04,861 --> 01:31:07,410
eliminated,
became prevalent throughout the world.

1954
01:31:07,411 --> 01:31:09,450
Eliminate like vaccinations.
Right?

1955
01:31:09,720 --> 01:31:11,330
Pretty much.
I would.

1956
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:12,193
I would have some at high,
90 percent of the western world is 

1957
01:31:15,031 --> 01:31:18,930
vaccinated every now and then our meat.
Some kid who had hippie parents and they

1958
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:21,770
gave him apple cider vinegar and they 
never vaccinated them.

1959
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:22,690
There's those,
those,

1960
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:24,600
a few of those exist,
but for the most part,

1961
01:31:24,601 --> 01:31:27,750
most people are vaccinated to prevent 
against diseases.

1962
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:29,153
If we came up with some sort of a 
vaccination to prevent the more 

1963
01:31:33,990 --> 01:31:38,160
disgusting aspects of human beings,
negative behavior or aggression,

1964
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:40,080
meanness,
it'd be very curious.

1965
01:31:40,081 --> 01:31:41,700
Very curious as to how that would play 
out.

1966
01:31:41,880 --> 01:31:46,880
Whether or not that would diminish a 
ambition and progress and who knows.

1967
01:31:49,890 --> 01:31:51,540
Yes.
I think it was.

1968
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:53,310
Yeah.
I thought you said the yin and the yang.

1969
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:56,520
I think scientology aspires to be that.
You know,

1970
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,680
and I think the danger of it is,
um,

1971
01:31:59,740 --> 01:32:00,140
it,

1972
01:32:00,140 --> 01:32:00,710
it,
it,

1973
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:05,710
it would be certain similarities to a 
sort of almost fascist vision.

1974
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:07,090
I think.
I mean,

1975
01:32:07,091 --> 01:32:10,030
I think that there is an overlap there,
you know,

1976
01:32:10,031 --> 01:32:13,150
the cult of health,
the culture of glowing,

1977
01:32:13,151 --> 01:32:13,984
smiling beacons of,
of health and humanity marching up and 

1978
01:32:17,351 --> 01:32:18,184
down.
And actually it's our ability to rub 

1979
01:32:20,021 --> 01:32:24,210
along with difficult characters and,
and um,

1980
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:28,280
to sort of embraced the ugly side is a 
iron.

1981
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:29,133
Can't define exactly what it is,
but it feels like that's an important 

1982
01:32:31,390 --> 01:32:32,440
dimension of life.

1983
01:32:32,650 --> 01:32:35,050
Well,
it certainly seems to be that there's a,

1984
01:32:35,051 --> 01:32:35,884
there's a dynamic that plays out between
human beings and that we learn not just 

1985
01:32:40,571 --> 01:32:42,850
from the positives but also from the 
negatives.

1986
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:45,940
And I learned a lot from other people's 
negative behavior,

1987
01:32:45,941 --> 01:32:49,300
how to never be like that myself without
having to make those same mistakes.

1988
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,790
Also learned from my own mistakes of,
sure.

1989
01:32:52,180 --> 01:32:55,600
But when we see horrible things in the 
news and negative things,

1990
01:32:55,601 --> 01:32:56,434
I think that does sort of reinforce how 
fortunate you are that you're not 

1991
01:32:59,411 --> 01:33:00,244
experiencing those horrible things and 
that there is some sort of an 

1992
01:33:03,101 --> 01:33:07,120
understanding of the worst aspects of 
people wear it.

1993
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:09,250
It Broadens your,
your spectrum of patients.

1994
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,473
I agree.
But I also think that many of my 

1995
01:33:11,821 --> 01:33:12,654
favorite writers you would probably 
defined in some sense as a walking 

1996
01:33:16,951 --> 01:33:20,010
negative side of life,
think about hunter thompson,

1997
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:21,780
thompson,
william burroughs,

1998
01:33:21,781 --> 01:33:22,790
or,
um,

1999
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:24,340
you know,
for them anyway,

2000
01:33:24,390 --> 01:33:25,223
Philip Roth,
if you like the talking about the 

2001
01:33:28,141 --> 01:33:31,500
absolute most contemptible and 
disgusting impulses,

2002
01:33:31,501 --> 01:33:33,840
we feel bukowski.
Oh yeah.

2003
01:33:33,890 --> 01:33:34,910
Um,
uh,

2004
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:37,440
you know,
that's absolutely rambo,

2005
01:33:37,441 --> 01:33:38,460
you know,
the french poet,

2006
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:42,120
this is sort of like,
this is who we are.

2007
01:33:42,121 --> 01:33:44,660
This is the stuff of life,
the ineradicable.

2008
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:47,300
And I think I'm suspicious of anything 
that,

2009
01:33:47,480 --> 01:33:48,241
that,
uh,

2010
01:33:48,241 --> 01:33:51,030
that pathologizes it too much and says,
you know what,

2011
01:33:51,031 --> 01:33:53,340
that's sort of,
um,

2012
01:33:53,850 --> 01:33:54,571
you know,
that you know,

2013
01:33:54,571 --> 01:33:55,920
which scientology does.
In fact,

2014
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:59,370
they say that's your reactive mind.
It's a malfunctioning part of your mind.

2015
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,280
It's a pseudo scientific thing.
Whereas actually christianity,

2016
01:34:02,281 --> 01:34:03,114
I'm not a christian,
but it sort of embraces the fact that 

2017
01:34:05,341 --> 01:34:07,290
it's just your human side,
you know,

2018
01:34:07,291 --> 01:34:08,124
your human side is his earthly and 
twisted and sexual and and actually you 

2019
01:34:12,571 --> 01:34:15,210
need to embrace some sort of high empire
being well,

2020
01:34:15,410 --> 01:34:18,780
I think most religions or ideologies 
that are,

2021
01:34:19,190 --> 01:34:22,670
that are trying to promote some sort of 
advancement.

2022
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:28,060
They look to the past and to the 
horrific nature of animal behavior,

2023
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:29,593
the tooth fang and claw of the wild and 
the recognition that somehow or another 

2024
01:34:33,021 --> 01:34:36,050
we've emerged from that and that we 
aspire to do better.

2025
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:38,960
And then that we know that in our own 
lives.

2026
01:34:38,961 --> 01:34:41,090
I mean if you look at your own life as a
microcosm,

2027
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,171
you,
you,

2028
01:34:42,171 --> 01:34:43,004
you've sort of fIgured out what you've 
done wrong hopefully and have advanced 

2029
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:53,410
past those days of youth and foolish 
behavior and you're now wiser,

2030
01:34:53,570 --> 01:34:56,990
more educated person and you seek to 
continue to advance,

2031
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:57,943
continue to do better.
So it's sort of like it's all analogous 

2032
01:35:00,501 --> 01:35:03,430
at all sort of ties in together.
Now when,

2033
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,340
when people go too hard with that,
when,

2034
01:35:06,341 --> 01:35:10,160
when people to go to hard with 
eliMinating the bad behavior,

2035
01:35:10,161 --> 01:35:13,160
I always wonDer if like l ron hubbard 
himself,

2036
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:14,750
if he was,
you know,

2037
01:35:14,751 --> 01:35:15,584
when,
when we talk about him self-diaGnosing 

2038
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,880
and self-treating,
if that's what they're doing as well,

2039
01:35:19,900 --> 01:35:20,733
it's like,
do you know that like isn't an old 

2040
01:35:22,461 --> 01:35:24,860
expression that a.
Well,

2041
01:35:24,861 --> 01:35:27,830
there's an old thing that you see with 
women,

2042
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:29,300
um,
that are,

2043
01:35:29,370 --> 01:35:33,530
uh,
what's the best way to put this sexually

2044
01:35:33,531 --> 01:35:34,364
loose that they always like to point the
finger at other girls that are sexually 

2045
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:38,564
loose.
It's like one of the first indications 

2046
01:35:40,191 --> 01:35:43,890
that girl might be a slut is that she 
likes to point at other girls and,

2047
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:44,853
and that's a real common thing.
And I think that the things that annoy 

2048
01:35:49,731 --> 01:35:54,731
you the most about yourself,
you tend to highlight those aspects when

2049
01:35:56,511 --> 01:35:59,630
you discuss human beings or other people
that irritate you.

2050
01:35:59,770 --> 01:36:04,180
I'm sure that something in that they 
say,

2051
01:36:04,240 --> 01:36:05,440
uh,
yes,

2052
01:36:05,470 --> 01:36:07,480
my dad likes to quote,
there's a,

2053
01:36:07,481 --> 01:36:08,560
um,
there's a,

2054
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:11,420
a bulgarian,
last and radical.

2055
01:36:11,430 --> 01:36:14,920
The lights can net huge had enough 
reason that the thieves hell is the fear

2056
01:36:14,921 --> 01:36:15,754
of thieves.
So we sort of project our qualities to 

2057
01:36:18,041 --> 01:36:18,874
others and it fills us with anxiety that
they may be that I have to go to the 

2058
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,140
other point,
know though,

2059
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:27,640
it would be wonderful to feel that we 
advanced through life acquiring wisdom.

2060
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:30,130
I don't know that it's necessarily the 
case.

2061
01:36:30,131 --> 01:36:33,700
And what strikes me about hubbard is 
the,

2062
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,640
you know,
the,

2063
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:35,473
the merit that you see in scientology.
The bits that feel workable and make 

2064
01:36:38,651 --> 01:36:41,050
sense seem to have come out fairly early
on.

2065
01:36:41,110 --> 01:36:41,943
And then later on,
the stuff that was coming out with more 

2066
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:45,304
and more outlandish,
whatever therapies he was evolving it 

2067
01:36:47,861 --> 01:36:48,694
when it went to the ot levels,
it was really getting properly out 

2068
01:36:52,481 --> 01:36:53,314
there.
Like,

2069
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:55,520
um,
I mean,

2070
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,000
whether that may be.
He was spiraling out.

2071
01:36:58,030 --> 01:36:58,863
I mean,
there's allegations that he was fully 

2072
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:03,160
mentally ill,
uh,

2073
01:37:03,240 --> 01:37:05,620
at least four episodes towards the end 
of his life.

2074
01:37:05,680 --> 01:37:06,513
And,
um,

2075
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:07,763
we spent a great deal of time.
The sea org was kind of concocted 

2076
01:37:09,901 --> 01:37:12,310
because he had to be in the ocean.

2077
01:37:12,510 --> 01:37:14,190
He had to be,
first of all,

2078
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:16,620
I'm away from America.
so he went.

2079
01:37:16,621 --> 01:37:20,390
He took to s to the sea,
so didn't prosecuted basically,

2080
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:21,720
as I understand it.
Yes.

2081
01:37:21,721 --> 01:37:22,554
And so he had a sort of ocean going 
religion where they were kind of 

2082
01:37:26,401 --> 01:37:27,234
traveling around and then for a while he
was in england and then for a while he 

2083
01:37:29,131 --> 01:37:29,964
was in what was then rhodesia,
what is now is involved way sort of 

2084
01:37:33,181 --> 01:37:34,014
trying to find a niche,
find a kind of new frontier that he 

2085
01:37:36,601 --> 01:37:40,800
could more or less make for his own kind
of claim for scientology.

2086
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:41,813
But then even when he came back,
he was so caught up In lawsuits in the 

2087
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:48,930
last 10 or 15 years of his life.
People pursuing him,

2088
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:51,000
uh,
for money because they,

2089
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:52,403
they felt scientology had made them 
psychotic or they just thought it 

2090
01:37:55,110 --> 01:37:55,980
fraudulent or

2091
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:56,813
that they wanted their money back.
He had to disappear and was living in 

2092
01:37:59,761 --> 01:38:00,594
seclusion more or less hiding out.
while money was kind of shuttled back 

2093
01:38:05,581 --> 01:38:06,414
and forth to him.
And that's why I say I said at the 

2094
01:38:08,191 --> 01:38:09,024
beginning of the problem with 
scientology is an overabundance of 

2095
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:13,590
material.
you probably saw the master right to the

2096
01:38:13,591 --> 01:38:17,700
Paul Thomas Anderson film had fell 
asleep as watching it in a hotel room.

2097
01:38:17,701 --> 01:38:19,920
And I passed,
it had its moments,

2098
01:38:19,921 --> 01:38:20,754
but there's so many weird stories within
scientology and the master is loosely 

2099
01:38:24,781 --> 01:38:26,030
based on,
I would say,

2100
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:28,920
fairly closely based on aspects of l ron
hubbard.

2101
01:38:29,130 --> 01:38:30,230
Yeah.
I mean,

2102
01:38:30,510 --> 01:38:31,890
was that,
is that public?

2103
01:38:31,891 --> 01:38:33,810
I mean,
if they had not acknowledged that,

2104
01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:34,913
uh,
I think he had a screening for tom 

2105
01:38:37,051 --> 01:38:42,051
cruise and I think he publicly said it 
wasn't based on our ron hubbard and what

2106
01:38:42,481 --> 01:38:44,460
it does.
I think tom said.

2107
01:38:45,340 --> 01:38:48,480
What do you,
what do you hear about tom?

2108
01:38:48,550 --> 01:38:50,250
Like everyone seems to say he's a good 
guy.

2109
01:38:50,251 --> 01:38:51,930
Like you meet him.
He's,

2110
01:38:51,931 --> 01:38:53,310
um,
like,

2111
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:54,630
as you say,
very focused,

2112
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:56,790
very attentive.
Um,

2113
01:38:57,320 --> 01:38:58,153
I've heard several things.
One that is not as short as everybody 

2114
01:38:59,731 --> 01:39:02,940
says [inaudible] lot of people at once.
So he's like five foot two,

2115
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:05,550
apparently five foot nine.
That's what I've heard.

2116
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:08,340
But who knows?
He could be wearing some funky stuff.

2117
01:39:08,350 --> 01:39:09,520
And issues,
uh,

2118
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:12,480
that he's very friendly,
but he's a very,

2119
01:39:12,930 --> 01:39:14,670
very focused,
very intense,

2120
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,170
very,
very charming,

2121
01:39:16,171 --> 01:39:17,580
very charismatic,
very smart,

2122
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:20,970
and um,
seems to be genuinely interested in what

2123
01:39:20,971 --> 01:39:22,410
you have to say.
Yeah,

2124
01:39:23,610 --> 01:39:25,280
I mean I've heard the same thing.
If you.

2125
01:39:25,300 --> 01:39:28,080
And what was your line on?
Would you,

2126
01:39:28,081 --> 01:39:31,230
if tom cruise is interviewed on a chat 
show,

2127
01:39:31,231 --> 01:39:33,780
you feel he should be asked about 
scientology?

2128
01:39:33,940 --> 01:39:34,750
No,
you'd be good.

2129
01:39:34,750 --> 01:39:36,150
I'm ask him about whatever.

2130
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,193
I think chat shows as you put them or 
they're pretty much bullshit anyway 

2131
01:39:40,440 --> 01:39:41,273
because what they really are as you have
the seven minute chunk where you 

2132
01:39:42,881 --> 01:39:43,714
supposed to be promoting some movie 
about a super spy that fucking repels 

2133
01:39:47,431 --> 01:39:49,930
down from the ceiling and gets passed.
Lasers and.

2134
01:39:49,931 --> 01:39:51,330
Yeah,
that's.

2135
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:52,920
I mean that's really.
Or the other.

2136
01:39:53,100 --> 01:39:55,560
I think he's a great actor.
I loved that movie.

2137
01:39:55,860 --> 01:39:57,070
What is it?
The edge of tomorrow?

2138
01:39:57,090 --> 01:39:58,240
It was called.
I love them.

2139
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:00,210
and that was,
that was the time travel one.

2140
01:40:00,220 --> 01:40:03,600
My love time travel.
So it's like groundhog day meets mission

2141
01:40:03,601 --> 01:40:04,420
impulsive.
Yeah.

2142
01:40:04,420 --> 01:40:06,480
Meets alien.
It's a great movie.

2143
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:08,700
I really enjoyed it.
I think he's a great actor.

2144
01:40:08,701 --> 01:40:11,340
And I think you have to be fucking crazy
to be a great actor.

2145
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:12,253
He was good in that and you know,
what was nice and that was that he 

2146
01:40:13,681 --> 01:40:15,160
started out,
uh,

2147
01:40:15,890 --> 01:40:16,723
in that movie as a kind of non tom 
cruise character to remember he's kind 

2148
01:40:20,481 --> 01:40:21,314
of cowardly and slightly weak and he 
learns in the course of the movie to 

2149
01:40:25,261 --> 01:40:26,550
become tom cruise.

2150
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:27,553
Whereas.
And it felt refreshing after seeing so 

2151
01:40:28,741 --> 01:40:33,741
many kind of cruise as uber manch films,
which by the way,

2152
01:40:33,841 --> 01:40:36,900
I think it's part of a scientology as 
well,

2153
01:40:36,901 --> 01:40:39,060
is that he doesn't want to take on roles
that are.

2154
01:40:39,110 --> 01:40:40,370
And theta.
Yes.

2155
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:41,920
In other words,
see,

2156
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:42,833
well,
one of the things I learned was members 

2157
01:40:43,531 --> 01:40:44,364
of the ceo who had taken this vow of 
poverty living extremely abstemious 

2158
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:52,350
cloistered lives and they're not allowed
to go to the movies for the most part,

2159
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,580
except when a tom cruise movie comes 
out.

2160
01:40:54,700 --> 01:40:56,410
So you know,
it better have a positive,

2161
01:40:56,411 --> 01:40:58,480
uplifting message.
Oh,

2162
01:40:58,481 --> 01:40:59,650
that's interesting.
Yeah.

2163
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:00,484
So they would literally be bust.
I was told to the cinemas to watch the 

2164
01:41:03,881 --> 01:41:08,500
matinee performances of the early held 
back while the previews are playing.

2165
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,500
It's a good question.
I would imagine they would have to be,

2166
01:41:11,501 --> 01:41:12,334
or they what?
What'd you think would be the worst 

2167
01:41:13,601 --> 01:41:16,870
thing they could see in probably a 
preview for my film?

2168
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:18,490
Yeah,
that wouldn't be good.

2169
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:21,760
They worked out how ironic their eyes 
would drop out of their heads.

2170
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:22,833
But um,
and I think that's one of the perhaps 

2171
01:41:24,701 --> 01:41:25,534
issues they have with john travolta as 
well as that he's playing a heroin 

2172
01:41:28,630 --> 01:41:31,420
addict pulp fiction.
That makes sense.

2173
01:41:31,421 --> 01:41:32,254
I mean,
he really embraces some very bizarre 

2174
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:35,140
roles.
Yeah.

2175
01:41:35,141 --> 01:41:38,920
He was in drag in hairspray.
They probably didn't love that.

2176
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,050
Yeah,
he's very good.

2177
01:41:41,890 --> 01:41:42,723
He's very good at.
Don't you love john travolta the right 

2178
01:41:44,321 --> 01:41:45,154
time?
Yeah,

2179
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,030
I do.
I love him.

2180
01:41:46,031 --> 01:41:46,864
I think he's a great actor.
Do you feel like we've been on such a 

2181
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:53,470
journey with him from vinnie barbarino?
He's like,

2182
01:41:53,471 --> 01:41:54,620
um,
he's,

2183
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:55,780
he's a,
he's a legend.

2184
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:57,900
He's a fascinating character.
And uh,

2185
01:41:57,910 --> 01:42:00,520
I met him as well when his wife was on 
the show and he was very nice,

2186
01:42:00,521 --> 01:42:01,890
but it was that thing,
you know,

2187
01:42:01,960 --> 01:42:04,450
where he's like really engaging,
looks you in the eyes,

2188
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,250
very present,
you know,

2189
01:42:06,310 --> 01:42:07,360
you think he's gay.

2190
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:08,850
is that where we can,
um,

2191
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:11,440
people say that he's gay?
I don't know.

2192
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,333
I don't know.
I hAve zero problem with people being 

2193
01:42:15,011 --> 01:42:15,844
gay,
but I do have a liTtle bit of a problem 

2194
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:18,364
with someone who's not gay.
Pretends that they're in or someone who 

2195
01:42:20,491 --> 01:42:22,420
is gay rather.
Well that would be real problem.

2196
01:42:22,580 --> 01:42:25,330
Someone who's not gay and pretend gay.
That's hard.

2197
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:28,030
But that's something like if you're,
if you do gay stuff,

2198
01:42:28,031 --> 01:42:28,864
you're just gay.
Like even if you're not gay and you 

2199
01:42:30,161 --> 01:42:30,994
pretend and you like,
you start dating guys like I'm not even 

2200
01:42:32,591 --> 01:42:34,000
gay,
but I'm going to triCk these dudes.

2201
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:38,250
I got news for your pal.

2202
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:42,040
Yeah.
it could happen.

2203
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:43,480
It's um,
you know,

2204
01:42:43,481 --> 01:42:45,550
it's,
it's an unfortunate as tending.

2205
01:42:45,690 --> 01:42:48,490
Is he pretending not to be gay?
Allegedly,

2206
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:50,840
that's the word.
The word is allegedly is that he's,

2207
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:53,650
he's definitely not out.
So if he is gay,

2208
01:42:53,680 --> 01:42:54,513
he's pretending to be straight,
but there's photos of him kissing men 

2209
01:42:57,101 --> 01:42:57,934
and you know,
there's allegedly these massage 

2210
01:42:59,501 --> 01:43:01,660
therapists that have claimed that he 
tried to have sex with them.

2211
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:02,703
I don't know if they're telling the 
truth or if they're just exploiting a 

2212
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:05,344
possibility.
Does it make you gay if you have sex 

2213
01:43:07,151 --> 01:43:09,520
with a man?
It.

2214
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:14,140
It definitely helps unless you're in 
prison.

2215
01:43:14,610 --> 01:43:15,443
Yeah.
And even then you're just gay for the 

2216
01:43:16,181 --> 01:43:17,014
stay,
right?

2217
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,670
Exactly.
Oh,

2218
01:43:18,730 --> 01:43:19,563
you know,
I,

2219
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:24,730
I just think it's an unfortunate aspect 
of our society that we're in.

2220
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:27,340
And this is a reality.
If tom cruise's gay,

2221
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:32,580
it would be a very smart business move 
for him with his business to stay in the

2222
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:37,600
closet because he's a leading man and 
he's a leading man that has love affairs

2223
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:41,020
in these movies with women and you 
cannot do that if you're gay.

2224
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:44,170
It's one of the weird things about being
a gay person,

2225
01:43:44,171 --> 01:43:45,004
even in today's liberated and very 
progressive society that a woman can be 

2226
01:43:49,271 --> 01:43:53,720
gay and she can play a straight woman in
a movie because no one cares.

2227
01:43:53,990 --> 01:43:56,690
Like if a guy meets a girl and she's 
beautiful,

2228
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:57,524
but she's been gay or whole life and he 
turns around and all of a sudden she's 

2229
01:43:59,751 --> 01:44:00,584
heterosexual and then he winds up 
marrying her and having children with 

2230
01:44:02,241 --> 01:44:03,350
her.
Everybody's like,

2231
01:44:03,351 --> 01:44:05,570
we got our year.
I like men get excited,

2232
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:06,583
but if a woman meets a guy who's been 
just blowing dudes for the past 20 

2233
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:10,994
years,
then all sudden he decides he's not gay 

2234
01:44:12,711 --> 01:44:15,210
anymore.
They're not excited about that.

2235
01:44:15,211 --> 01:44:16,610
They're like,
are you sure you're not gay?

2236
01:44:16,611 --> 01:44:18,560
Like I don'T mean,
I don't even know how I feel about this.

2237
01:44:18,830 --> 01:44:23,000
It's we don't accept a,
a gay person yet.

2238
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:26,990
At least playing a straight man who is a
leading man in a movie.

2239
01:44:26,991 --> 01:44:29,240
I don't think there's anyone has been 
able to pull that off.

2240
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,070
There's not want to Do doogie howser,
the doogie howser dude.

2241
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:34,730
He's,
he's,

2242
01:44:34,730 --> 01:44:36,890
he played like a womanizer and some 
sitcom,

2243
01:44:36,891 --> 01:44:39,230
but nobody's buying that bullshit.
Shawn.

2244
01:44:39,231 --> 01:44:42,520
Michael,
patrick or neil Patrick Harris petrie.

2245
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:44,240
Yeah,
it's,

2246
01:44:44,310 --> 01:44:45,380
it,
it's an interesting.

2247
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:49,790
One of the allegations about scientology
always used to be that,

2248
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:52,850
um,
you spill your secrets in order to.

2249
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:57,440
Which is like confession and then 
suddenly that kept in a locked vault and

2250
01:44:57,441 --> 01:45:01,360
if you leave they become public and sort
of a test set,

2251
01:45:01,900 --> 01:45:06,650
black Male going on.
so whether that's really happening,

2252
01:45:07,140 --> 01:45:07,973
uh,
now I Don't know that that may have 

2253
01:45:09,621 --> 01:45:11,280
happened in the past diligence.
Well,

2254
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:15,200
there is an issue with them going after 
detractors and people that leave because

2255
01:45:15,201 --> 01:45:17,470
it doesn't really exist in other 
organizations or,

2256
01:45:17,471 --> 01:45:18,740
or,
or other religions.

2257
01:45:18,740 --> 01:45:20,960
I go,
perfect example of another religion that

2258
01:45:20,961 --> 01:45:24,860
was most obviously created by a con man 
is mormonism.

2259
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:29,090
Joseph smith was 14 years old when he 
claimed to find golden tablets that were

2260
01:45:29,091 --> 01:45:31,700
the last work of jesus.
And then only he could read them because

2261
01:45:31,701 --> 01:45:34,820
he had a magic seer stone.
It's a ludicrous story.

2262
01:45:34,821 --> 01:45:36,650
It was a story that was created in 18,
20.

2263
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:39,890
It's such a ludicrous story that,
you know,

2264
01:45:39,891 --> 01:45:41,720
a lot of people when they find out about
it,

2265
01:45:41,810 --> 01:45:42,571
they go,
well wait,

2266
01:45:42,571 --> 01:45:42,910
wait,
wait,

2267
01:45:42,910 --> 01:45:43,820
hold on.
Like people,

2268
01:45:43,870 --> 01:45:48,140
people like they become mormon and then 
they get deep into it and then they find

2269
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:49,580
out the roots of this and they go,
wait a minute,

2270
01:45:49,581 --> 01:45:51,320
what the fuck?
By the way,

2271
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:56,330
it's not scientology that mormonism is 
the fastest growing religion in America.

2272
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:01,230
I wonder if they're nice people.
They seem very nice.

2273
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:02,290
They're very nice.

2274
01:46:02,380 --> 01:46:04,670
Would it be you sit against mitt romney?
I am,

2275
01:46:04,671 --> 01:46:05,504
I'm glad he's not the president.
But whenever I would see him with his 

2276
01:46:07,251 --> 01:46:07,911
fAmily,
I thought,

2277
01:46:07,911 --> 01:46:09,290
well,
you know,

2278
01:46:09,380 --> 01:46:11,990
why can't all family be a bit more like 
that family.

2279
01:46:12,050 --> 01:46:15,470
I am not glad he's not running for 
president right now.

2280
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:17,780
Um,
I think he's a better choice.

2281
01:46:17,781 --> 01:46:18,614
And I was shocked that he wasn't willing
to oppose Donald Trump because I think 

2282
01:46:22,521 --> 01:46:26,030
that that would be a fucking easy run 
for people that were conservative,

2283
01:46:26,031 --> 01:46:26,864
that we're uncomfortable with this trump
character and all his fucking loose 

2284
01:46:30,411 --> 01:46:32,780
dialogue and all the crazy shit that he 
says.

2285
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:33,683
I don't think so.
I think what I think what trump has his 

2286
01:46:37,150 --> 01:46:39,230
way he's proved so,
uh,

2287
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:43,970
so durable and popular is just this 
absolute.

2288
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:45,710
I'm different.
I know.

2289
01:46:46,460 --> 01:46:49,370
Fuck everything into establishment at 
the.

2290
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:52,280
That's exactly what romney doesn't have.
Ron miller side,

2291
01:46:52,281 --> 01:46:53,700
the consummate insider.

2292
01:46:54,090 --> 01:46:55,790
He's um,
he's,

2293
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:59,910
he's establishment Washington.
All the rest of it and trump seemed is a

2294
01:46:59,911 --> 01:47:01,520
kind of caveman.
yeah,

2295
01:47:01,530 --> 01:47:03,180
he's a weird guy.
So there was,

2296
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:04,260
you know,
the people out there,

2297
01:47:04,350 --> 01:47:06,120
I think white collar,
blue collar,

2298
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:09,480
kind of white americans on the front 
porch see trump and they think,

2299
01:47:09,481 --> 01:47:10,890
yeah,
that guy is my guy.

2300
01:47:11,310 --> 01:47:12,143
While they embrace the strong man,
he's a strong man who doesn't give a 

2301
01:47:14,881 --> 01:47:16,230
fuck.
He says crazy things.

2302
01:47:16,231 --> 01:47:20,610
He talks about our biggest penises.
I mean he does that mean that the run up

2303
01:47:20,611 --> 01:47:21,444
to becoming the republican nominee was 
one of the most embarrassing times ever 

2304
01:47:24,541 --> 01:47:25,374
for the republican party because you had
all these fools dancing around this 

2305
01:47:29,790 --> 01:47:33,090
strong man.
Really good robo candidates.

2306
01:47:33,091 --> 01:47:37,380
Almost literally in the case of rubio 
was malfunctioning with his,

2307
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:40,200
his kind of soundbite algorithm was 
glitching.

2308
01:47:40,201 --> 01:47:43,230
So was coming out with the same sound 
bite within 10 seconds,

2309
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:44,453
but all these robo candidates and then 
someone who seemed like a kind of 

2310
01:47:47,010 --> 01:47:50,190
visceral flesh and blood human on stage 
and who.

2311
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:51,023
Moreover,
when he said stupid crazy stuff did not 

2312
01:47:53,611 --> 01:47:55,920
then hit the trail to,
to apologize,

2313
01:47:56,220 --> 01:47:59,310
he would just keep saying weird things 
and I think felt like,

2314
01:47:59,311 --> 01:48:03,270
you know what he's showing the media for
the shell game that it is.

2315
01:48:03,271 --> 01:48:05,180
Yes.
Because he's saying,

2316
01:48:05,181 --> 01:48:06,930
well,
I'm not going to do that thing if like,

2317
01:48:07,130 --> 01:48:09,530
I'm so sorry I said that.
Where It's like,

2318
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:10,373
and also they all cliche,
but who would you want to have a beer 

2319
01:48:11,671 --> 01:48:12,504
with?
Would you want to have a beer with 

2320
01:48:13,081 --> 01:48:13,914
romney?
Romney probably doesn't drink beers and 

2321
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:16,980
drink and then,
uh,

2322
01:48:16,981 --> 01:48:18,840
and,
and trump actually,

2323
01:48:18,841 --> 01:48:21,750
you would probably enjoy the kind of 
weird,

2324
01:48:21,751 --> 01:48:22,584
ludicrous.
Just peering at him would be 

2325
01:48:23,971 --> 01:48:27,060
entertaining in itself.
Did you ever see the picture that he put

2326
01:48:27,061 --> 01:48:31,140
up on instagram with him in trump tower 
eating a taco bowl?

2327
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:36,000
And this was after all the crazy remarks
that he'd said about Mexico and mexicans

2328
01:48:36,001 --> 01:48:39,450
coming over here and raping,
and I talked to the president of Mexico,

2329
01:48:39,451 --> 01:48:40,830
who's going to pay for that wall?

2330
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:42,330
You know,
we're not going to pay for that wall.

2331
01:48:42,331 --> 01:48:42,781
Yeah.
Well,

2332
01:48:42,781 --> 01:48:43,614
the wall just got 10 foot higher and 
everybody starts cheering and then he 

2333
01:48:46,501 --> 01:48:49,950
takes a photo on instagram of him 
smiling,

2334
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:50,963
eating a taco bowl,
look at this at trump tower and it says 

2335
01:48:55,351 --> 01:48:57,030
he's got the thumbs up.
He's eating this,

2336
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:59,490
this taco bone.
It said something about like,

2337
01:48:59,550 --> 01:49:03,870
I love hispanics.
Happy cinco de mayo,

2338
01:49:03,950 --> 01:49:05,040
but,
but what?

2339
01:49:05,110 --> 01:49:08,430
But though the best taco bowls are made 
in trump tower grille.

2340
01:49:08,730 --> 01:49:10,920
And then he also said,
I love hispanics.

2341
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,030
Like see if you can find the actual 
instagram post.

2342
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:16,140
What's your initial point at this?
Because it isn't.

2343
01:49:16,141 --> 01:49:21,141
I love hispanics is fucking crazy.
That's fucking crazy that.

2344
01:49:22,050 --> 01:49:23,700
I mean I saw that.
I'm like,

2345
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:24,553
okaY,
we're being trolled and look at the 

2346
01:49:25,591 --> 01:49:27,720
likes,
look at the retweets and the likes.

2347
01:49:27,750 --> 01:49:32,750
Forty 2000 retweets for.
That's his genius is that he could speak

2348
01:49:32,971 --> 01:49:33,451
out.
He'll,

2349
01:49:33,451 --> 01:49:38,451
he'll say something crazy and then 10 
minutes later he'll say,

2350
01:49:39,151 --> 01:49:40,830
he'll say something contradictory.
Well,

2351
01:49:40,831 --> 01:49:42,660
it's fun for us.
It's fun for us.

2352
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:43,523
It's interesting.
It's fun for us and also he doesn't 

2353
01:49:45,631 --> 01:49:48,070
necessarily represent for

2354
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:49,330
a lot of people.
He doesn't like.

2355
01:49:49,331 --> 01:49:51,400
One of the things that romneY 
represents,

2356
01:49:51,401 --> 01:49:55,750
it's problematic for people is that not 
only is his father a mormon,

2357
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:56,633
not only is it from the but he's from 
one of the most bizarre sex of mormons 

2358
01:49:59,770 --> 01:50:04,390
were they left the United States so that
they can have multiple wives who?

2359
01:50:04,391 --> 01:50:05,410
Romney's family.
Yeah.

2360
01:50:05,411 --> 01:50:09,260
You don't know that.
Let me hook you up.

2361
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:13,500
Romney's family.
No,

2362
01:50:13,660 --> 01:50:16,660
I don't know what the fuck it is,
but there was a vice piece on.

2363
01:50:16,661 --> 01:50:18,310
It's a fascinating piece there.
There.

2364
01:50:18,311 --> 01:50:22,120
They all live in Mexico.
The romney's family.

2365
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,690
I know who you mean.
They moved to Mexico before romney's dad

2366
01:50:25,691 --> 01:50:26,524
was born.
Romney's dad was not born in the United 

2367
01:50:28,120 --> 01:50:28,953
States.
He was born in Mexico and when the 

2368
01:50:30,641 --> 01:50:31,474
United States made polygamy illegal,
they just said this was in the 18 

2369
01:50:35,111 --> 01:50:36,400
hundreds.
We didn't have cars,

2370
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,391
so people were like,
well,

2371
01:50:37,391 --> 01:50:37,990
who gives a shit?

2372
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:38,823
If we're in the United States or Mexico,
we're still riding horses and banging 

2373
01:50:42,671 --> 01:50:44,350
our nine slash wives.
Let's just go over there.

2374
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:47,500
So they didn't want to give up the 
polygamy aspect of the religion.

2375
01:50:47,501 --> 01:50:48,334
So they just went south to Mexico,
which was not that Much different than 

2376
01:50:51,581 --> 01:50:52,414
the United States back then.
Then when cars were invented in the 

2377
01:50:56,051 --> 01:50:56,884
United States,
it really exploded and became much more 

2378
01:50:59,141 --> 01:50:59,974
prosperous than Mexico.
Then ultimately it got even crazier who 

2379
01:51:02,971 --> 01:51:06,390
they get involved in the drug war,
the drug war where there were,

2380
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:07,233
there was a drug cartel.
people were kidnapping people in the 

2381
01:51:09,731 --> 01:51:13,000
romney family and other mormons that are
living down there.

2382
01:51:13,090 --> 01:51:13,923
So they started being.
They had armed gUards on century 24 

2383
01:51:17,351 --> 01:51:17,670
hours.
I mean,

2384
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:18,503
it's like a scene from the walking dead.
they're all standing there with high 

2385
01:51:20,921 --> 01:51:23,390
powered rifle when we're talking with 
now.

2386
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:27,010
So family is still down this?
Yes.

2387
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:27,941
Oh my goodness.
Oh,

2388
01:51:27,941 --> 01:51:31,330
it's amazing right now what ronnie was 
born in the United States.

2389
01:51:31,630 --> 01:51:32,463
It's the mexican mormon war and it's a 
vice series and it is wonderful because 

2390
01:51:37,241 --> 01:51:38,074
this is something that for whatever 
reason was not really discussed during 

2391
01:51:41,021 --> 01:51:41,854
the campaign trail.
I think they tried to keep this because 

2392
01:51:45,041 --> 01:51:45,874
I think they thought it would be 
incredibly damaging to the republican 

2393
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:50,830
party because this guy is the front 
runner for the republicans.

2394
01:51:50,831 --> 01:51:55,030
And I don't know who the fuck on the 
democratic side agreed to not really get

2395
01:51:55,031 --> 01:51:55,864
into this,
but that means they're not just a part 

2396
01:51:57,491 --> 01:51:58,324
of a cult or a part of a gun toting 
polygamous cult that has an armed 

2397
01:52:02,261 --> 01:52:05,950
compound in Mexico.
How do I not know this?

2398
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:06,843
Well,
that's why romney's dad wanted to be 

2399
01:52:09,221 --> 01:52:10,054
president,
but could not run for president because 

2400
01:52:11,321 --> 01:52:12,154
he was born in Mexico.
He came out of his mother's body in the 

2401
01:52:15,731 --> 01:52:19,240
wrong patch of dirt.
So we did not allow him to run our great

2402
01:52:19,241 --> 01:52:21,720
nation.
It's,

2403
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:23,620
um,
did he become a senator?

2404
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,750
Uh,
I do not remember.

2405
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:30,400
It was involved in politics in some way.
Ted cruz was born in Canada though,

2406
01:52:30,401 --> 01:52:32,680
running.
So did they change the rules?

2407
01:52:32,681 --> 01:52:35,580
Dirty canadian.
He's not one of us to love canadians.

2408
01:52:35,581 --> 01:52:37,450
I'm kid.
Did they change the rules?

2409
01:52:37,540 --> 01:52:38,680
A?
No,

2410
01:52:38,740 --> 01:52:43,740
because he has dual citizenship because 
his mother was a can be born.

2411
01:52:44,410 --> 01:52:46,070
Yes.
Like my friend

2412
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:48,800
brian was born in the Philippines,
but he's american because he was born.

2413
01:52:49,610 --> 01:52:50,750
He was going to be,
I mean,

2414
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:51,793
yeah,
but you can't be president and not born 

2415
01:52:53,241 --> 01:52:55,340
in the us.
In my book,

2416
01:52:55,341 --> 01:52:57,830
no,
because,

2417
01:52:57,831 --> 01:52:58,664
uh,
he was not given the god given right to 

2418
01:53:00,951 --> 01:53:04,070
be born the right patch dirt.
So fuck him.

2419
01:53:04,730 --> 01:53:07,190
That's in my book,
but constitution.

2420
01:53:07,210 --> 01:53:08,660
Well,
that was something that Donald Trump was

2421
01:53:08,690 --> 01:53:09,321
bringing up.
Well,

2422
01:53:09,321 --> 01:53:11,990
by the way,
people do forget conveniently,

2423
01:53:11,991 --> 01:53:14,510
the Donald Trump was one of the primary 
birthers.

2424
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:15,733
He was one of the biggest proponents of 
the idea that obama was not born in 

2425
01:53:19,821 --> 01:53:21,830
America,
that he was born in Kenya.

2426
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:23,540
Do you remember that?
That was a bIg issue.

2427
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:24,860
Big time.
Huge.

2428
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:25,880
He was a.
He still.

2429
01:53:25,940 --> 01:53:28,760
It's a propounding.
Absolutely.

2430
01:53:28,761 --> 01:53:31,720
Fringe conspiracy nut beliefs about,
you know,

2431
01:53:31,730 --> 01:53:36,140
he said that obama founded isis right at
a rally in Florida.

2432
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:39,920
Did he find Iceland?
Did he,

2433
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,180
the atom bomb?
I had started ice,

2434
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,083
but did he decide to say this at a rally
in Florida or did obama found isis in a 

2435
01:53:49,201 --> 01:53:52,370
rally in Florida?
I think he said it the rally.

2436
01:53:52,380 --> 01:53:56,750
I said that obama founded it.
Oba,

2437
01:53:57,470 --> 01:53:59,210
let me hear this.
Let's hear this

2438
01:53:59,350 --> 01:54:04,180
all over the middle east and it was a 
terrible mistake.

2439
01:54:04,690 --> 01:54:09,160
And then obama came In and normally you 
want to clean up.

2440
01:54:09,400 --> 01:54:10,233
He made a bigger mess out of it.
He made such a mess and then you had 

2441
01:54:13,751 --> 01:54:14,860
hillary with Libya.

2442
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,450
So sad.
In fact,

2443
01:54:20,830 --> 01:54:23,170
in many respects,
you know,

2444
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:28,260
they honor president obama.
Isis is honoring president obama.

2445
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:35,950
He is the founder of isis.
He's the founder of isis.

2446
01:54:37,370 --> 01:54:42,370
The founder said it three times and I 
would say the cofounder would be crooked

2447
01:54:48,460 --> 01:54:51,920
hillary clinton.
I wonder

2448
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:55,310
if he knows what the word found means.
He doesn't give a fuck.

2449
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:57,860
you know what I mean?
He's a pro wrestling candidate.

2450
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:02,920
I had a bit about this in 2005.
I had a bit about George Bush in that.

2451
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:05,293
He was so dumb that I don't think that 
he was really the candidate that the 

2452
01:55:10,191 --> 01:55:12,200
republicans like the best candIdate that
could have.

2453
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:15,800
I think it was a test to find out how 
dumb people are because there's only one

2454
01:55:15,801 --> 01:55:18,740
way to tell if the people that the 
bankers and the industrialists,

2455
01:55:18,741 --> 01:55:21,200
they don't really know how dumb 
americans are.

2456
01:55:21,201 --> 01:55:24,650
They know about pop culture.
They know what people like and that they

2457
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:26,750
the only.
There was only one way to find out.

2458
01:55:26,780 --> 01:55:31,780
You put a dumb guy in the office and you
see how people react and that at the end

2459
01:55:32,330 --> 01:55:32,770
of the,
uh,

2460
01:55:32,770 --> 01:55:35,750
the first year when he won again,
or the first term when you want again,

2461
01:55:36,490 --> 01:55:39,260
I think there were sitting around going,
I think we can go dumber,

2462
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,250
and they just decided to get some 
fucking

2463
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:47,910
pro wrestling type president.
Some,

2464
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:48,773
some dude who's like a combination of 
like a drill sergeant and have a pro 

2465
01:55:52,381 --> 01:55:54,170
wrestler who just,
you know,

2466
01:55:54,190 --> 01:55:56,680
you just go to ted nugent concert and 
scoop people up,

2467
01:55:56,681 --> 01:56:00,960
but nets and you just set them up and 
that this is kind of what he is.

2468
01:56:01,130 --> 01:56:02,340
I mean,
you watched that.

2469
01:56:02,341 --> 01:56:06,930
That is like the way the audience is 
yelling along and cheering.

2470
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:09,060
It's theatrical.
This is,

2471
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:11,830
this is all like a parade.
It's theater.

2472
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:13,043
They don't,
they don't necessarily think that obama 

2473
01:56:14,821 --> 01:56:19,380
really founded isis.
They don't care if he did or not.

2474
01:56:19,680 --> 01:56:20,910
There's no thinking there.
There's a,

2475
01:56:20,920 --> 01:56:24,480
there's a box that they operate on.
It's a very small box.

2476
01:56:24,690 --> 01:56:27,180
They operate.
All their thoughts exist inside this box

2477
01:56:27,480 --> 01:56:29,430
and they never expand.
They'd never go there.

2478
01:56:29,431 --> 01:56:30,840
There's no,
there's no nuance.

2479
01:56:30,841 --> 01:56:32,190
There's no subtlety,
there's no,

2480
01:56:32,191 --> 01:56:35,460
there's no broad spectrum,
there's no big picture.

2481
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:39,810
There was none of that.
It's just assholes have their king.

2482
01:56:40,230 --> 01:56:42,930
We have a lot of assholes.
It's really easy to survive.

2483
01:56:43,080 --> 01:56:44,570
It's real easy to have.

2484
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:47,400
You can't have thought when this started
you,

2485
01:56:47,570 --> 01:56:49,940
you couldn't have thought that this 
would get this far,

2486
01:56:50,380 --> 01:56:53,710
you know,
seemed like a joke to begin with.

2487
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:54,490
Yeah,

2488
01:56:54,490 --> 01:56:57,610
I thought somewhere along the line,
cooler heads will prevail,

2489
01:56:59,200 --> 01:56:59,800
but it's,
I,

2490
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:03,190
I'm torn because as a comedian,
you know,

2491
01:57:03,191 --> 01:57:05,800
I mean this is a fucking gold mine.
They are,

2492
01:57:05,950 --> 01:57:06,783
they're about to open up a dam of gold.
They're going to break down the dam and 

2493
01:57:10,230 --> 01:57:12,910
gold is going to flow down.
it's going to be amazing.

2494
01:57:12,911 --> 01:57:13,744
But as a human being,
this kid literally lead to the end of 

2495
01:57:17,230 --> 01:57:17,850
civilization.

2496
01:57:17,850 --> 01:57:18,560
Yes.
All.

2497
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,660
So as a student,
as myself,

2498
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:21,503
as a sort of student of kind of self 
sabotage and the puzzle at [inaudible] 

2499
01:57:27,501 --> 01:57:29,460
of the human condition,
do you know what I mean?

2500
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:31,560
I find it fascinating,
right?

2501
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:34,140
You know,
it could be the end of the world,

2502
01:57:34,170 --> 01:57:35,003
but it just,
you just see things happening that 

2503
01:57:37,820 --> 01:57:40,490
absolutely are unprecedented and,
and it's.

2504
01:57:40,560 --> 01:57:44,730
I have a kind of chaos,
chaotic streak that enjoys.

2505
01:57:44,731 --> 01:57:45,564
It's like that feeling you get in the 
playground as a kid when a fight breaks 

2506
01:57:48,481 --> 01:57:49,410
out,
fight,

2507
01:57:49,500 --> 01:57:50,310
fight,
fight.

2508
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:51,450
You just sort of.
It's like it's.

2509
01:57:51,460 --> 01:57:55,200
It was an arsonist thrill of seeing 
civilization burned.

2510
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:57,150
Something's gonna happen.
Something's crazy.

2511
01:57:57,151 --> 01:57:58,900
It's going to happen.
It's not business as usual.

2512
01:57:58,910 --> 01:58:00,430
Here's another thing that I like about 
it.

2513
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:01,323
There's a lot of things that he says 
that are absolutely true and here's one 

2514
01:58:03,881 --> 01:58:05,920
of the things that I like about what 
trump represents.

2515
01:58:06,100 --> 01:58:10,720
He is not the political establishment 
and the political establishment sucks.

2516
01:58:10,810 --> 01:58:13,390
It really does suck.
It is a corrupt,

2517
01:58:13,600 --> 01:58:14,433
completely corrupt institution.
And what he's saying about crooked 

2518
01:58:16,871 --> 01:58:18,220
hillary,
I agree.

2519
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:19,930
Look,
if you look at the clinton foundation,

2520
01:58:19,931 --> 01:58:20,764
you look at what they've been able to do
and the laws they've been able to skirt 

2521
01:58:23,411 --> 01:58:24,244
and the amount of influence they're able
to have and the amount of money that 

2522
01:58:26,801 --> 01:58:27,634
they're able to generate and where that 
money goes and how ambiguous it is and 

2523
01:58:30,280 --> 01:58:32,860
how would that hasn't been investigated.
He's right.

2524
01:58:33,190 --> 01:58:34,023
He's right in a lot of ways.
So I hope that a lot of what he's doiNg 

2525
01:58:37,001 --> 01:58:39,370
is theatrical and if he does wind up 
winning,

2526
01:58:39,610 --> 01:58:40,443
I hope that he puts around hiM some real
political advisors that understand 

2527
01:58:44,561 --> 01:58:46,600
international policy,
that understanding the,

2528
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:47,860
he tones everything down.

2529
01:58:48,040 --> 01:58:50,110
And This was all.
That's the ultimate hope,

2530
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,690
right?
I don't necessarily think it's true that

2531
01:58:52,691 --> 01:58:55,480
he loses.
What do you hope that hillary wins?

2532
01:58:55,830 --> 01:58:57,220
Because I hope that she doesn't win 
either.

2533
01:58:57,380 --> 01:59:00,100
I don't see what I mean.
I don't see jill stein winning.

2534
01:59:00,101 --> 01:59:01,150
I mean,
I think It's either.

2535
01:59:01,180 --> 01:59:02,930
What about Gary Johnson here?
My.

2536
01:59:02,980 --> 01:59:04,750
Who is Gary Jones?
How dare you.

2537
01:59:05,110 --> 01:59:05,950
He's the,
uh,

2538
01:59:06,160 --> 01:59:08,830
he's an independent.
He's a Gary Johnson.

2539
01:59:08,860 --> 01:59:10,900
The libertarian candidate.
It's very reasonable.

2540
01:59:10,901 --> 01:59:13,860
Gun weld was the libertarian candidate.
No,

2541
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:16,090
it was johnson,
johnson with weld as well.

2542
01:59:16,091 --> 01:59:16,924
Does well device.
We're going to find johnson is the form 

2543
01:59:20,161 --> 01:59:25,161
of government hillary and and trump.
You would go trump.

2544
01:59:26,380 --> 01:59:27,700
No,
no,

2545
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:28,541
no,
no.

2546
01:59:28,541 --> 01:59:31,060
I wouldn't go.
Asteroid which opened.

2547
01:59:31,061 --> 01:59:36,061
Asteroid hits like I don't like either 
one of them.

2548
01:59:38,170 --> 01:59:43,030
What you said about it took a orange 
head casino magnate.

2549
01:59:44,160 --> 01:59:47,950
Pathological lying issues.
Point out the truth about the american,

2550
01:59:47,980 --> 01:59:49,400
the brokenness of the american.

2551
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:51,880
Gary johnson and bill.
Well bill weld as his vice president.

2552
01:59:51,881 --> 01:59:52,760
Okay.
Um,

2553
01:59:52,780 --> 01:59:53,613
I think we're,
we're in a bad place with either one of 

2554
01:59:56,891 --> 01:59:57,724
them because either one of them are 
exposing the ridiculous aspects of our 

2555
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:04,960
society and the ridiculous aspects of 
our political establishment,

2556
02:00:05,170 --> 02:00:07,420
our political system.
It's just not a good system.

2557
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:08,433
Representative government doesn't make 
any sense when people can represent 

2558
02:00:10,451 --> 02:00:11,284
themselves.
it made sense back when it was 

2559
02:00:13,121 --> 02:00:16,390
impossible to get word to Washington how
all these people felt.

2560
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:18,460
But now that people,
you,

2561
02:00:18,550 --> 02:00:19,383
you,
you're almost saying by continuing 

2562
02:00:21,431 --> 02:00:24,970
representative government in 2016,
you're almost saying that,

2563
02:00:24,971 --> 02:00:25,804
well,
you can't have one person one vote 

2564
02:00:27,940 --> 02:00:29,800
because people are too fucking stupid 
for that.

2565
02:00:30,160 --> 02:00:31,550
Mean you're almost saying that,
well,

2566
02:00:31,610 --> 02:00:33,700
maybe they are,
but are they,

2567
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:34,983
and if that's the case,
we need to fix that instead of just 

2568
02:00:37,061 --> 02:00:41,530
continuing business as usual to figure 
out how to expand our educational system

2569
02:00:41,531 --> 02:00:42,364
or enlightened some of these people and 
maybe drop mushrooms everywhere or 

2570
02:00:45,221 --> 02:00:46,054
something when there's gotta be a better
way than just continuing business as 

2571
02:00:49,391 --> 02:00:49,900
usual.

2572
02:00:49,900 --> 02:00:53,380
And that business has been shown,
at least in hillary clinton's case,

2573
02:00:53,381 --> 02:00:55,510
to be completely corrupt.
Do you think?

2574
02:00:56,050 --> 02:00:59,680
How would you rate obama?
I liked him as a human.

2575
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:02,500
What I like about obama is he's 
measured,

2576
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:05,440
he's intelligent and I think there's one
thing that has.

2577
02:01:05,640 --> 02:01:08,380
I mean as much as when you look at 
politics,

2578
02:01:08,381 --> 02:01:09,820
you look at someone who's running the 
president,

2579
02:01:09,850 --> 02:01:11,890
there's a lot of speculation.
How much power does he have?

2580
02:01:11,891 --> 02:01:14,770
What does it like behind closed doors?
What are those meetings like is,

2581
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:17,260
you know,
like sam harris is an interesting point.

2582
02:01:17,640 --> 02:01:18,473
He's like,
is obama a guy who was lying all along 

2583
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:25,090
or when he was running for president and
then gets into office and does different

2584
02:01:25,091 --> 02:01:25,924
things like keeps guantanamo bay open 
and doesn't leave Iraq and all the 

2585
02:01:28,421 --> 02:01:30,880
different things that he sort of reneged
on,

2586
02:01:31,240 --> 02:01:32,073
or is it that you become president and 
then you are briefed and then someone 

2587
02:01:36,221 --> 02:01:39,980
sits down and explains to you the 
horrific nature of the outside world and

2588
02:01:39,981 --> 02:01:42,560
here are the threats to civilization 
itself.

2589
02:01:42,800 --> 02:01:45,470
Here are The threats in terms of 
terrorism,

2590
02:01:45,710 --> 02:01:46,543
in terms of these different 
dictatorships that are seeking to gain 

2591
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:53,090
nuclear arms and here's,
here's some real problems and here's the

2592
02:01:53,091 --> 02:01:53,924
strategies and here's what we have to do
and here's why we can't do what you 

2593
02:01:55,491 --> 02:01:58,310
promIse is that too.
I don't know what we don't know,

2594
02:01:58,580 --> 02:02:00,440
but what,
what obama does represent,

2595
02:02:00,441 --> 02:02:03,800
and here's what trickles down is as a 
man,

2596
02:02:04,010 --> 02:02:06,890
he's very measured.
He's very intelligent.

2597
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:09,260
He's.
He's very articulate.

2598
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:14,270
He doesn't lose his cool.
He doesn't respond to nonsense,

2599
02:02:14,600 --> 02:02:15,433
and the speeches that he gives are.
There are a great representative of 

2600
02:02:21,260 --> 02:02:23,750
education,
of dignity,

2601
02:02:23,990 --> 02:02:28,010
of a guy who speaks very well and a guy 
who is smarter than most people that,

2602
02:02:28,011 --> 02:02:30,620
you know,
I think there's something to be said for

2603
02:02:30,621 --> 02:02:34,460
that and I think that that is what 
George Bush wasn't and that was what was

2604
02:02:34,461 --> 02:02:37,380
appealing to me about obama,
but you know,

2605
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:39,380
but he bullshits too,
you know,

2606
02:02:39,381 --> 02:02:40,214
so it's like,
at what point in time do you get to 

2607
02:02:42,651 --> 02:02:43,880
speak your mind?

2608
02:02:43,910 --> 02:02:44,743
Do you ever.
Do you ever get to say What you really 

2609
02:02:46,191 --> 02:02:47,750
think?
If that's what he really thinks.

2610
02:02:47,751 --> 02:02:51,500
If that's who we really is it when 
you're a politician,

2611
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:57,010
you are almost required to try to play 
this game of not pissing people off,

2612
02:02:59,180 --> 02:03:03,400
over expressing your true feelings on 
things like you.

2613
02:03:03,401 --> 02:03:05,750
You've got to kind of play it as MuCh 
down The middle.

2614
02:03:05,751 --> 02:03:06,584
You know that there's going to be a 
bunch of people on this side that are 

2615
02:03:07,881 --> 02:03:08,714
going to hate you.
It's going to be a bunch of people on 

2616
02:03:09,651 --> 02:03:11,270
that side that don't think you're going 
far enough,

2617
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:14,510
but you shoot down the middle and you 
get the best results.

2618
02:03:15,170 --> 02:03:16,003
It's almost like pretending to be 
someone who you're not to try to pick 

2619
02:03:18,351 --> 02:03:22,520
people up at a bar,
like it's a bullshit act and that's what

2620
02:03:22,521 --> 02:03:24,800
politicians are.
They're bullshitters there.

2621
02:03:24,801 --> 02:03:25,634
They're really good at bullshitting.
What's bizarre about trump is that he's 

2622
02:03:28,581 --> 02:03:31,490
not doing that.
This is who he is.

2623
02:03:31,930 --> 02:03:34,020
I think that that's true.
I think,

2624
02:03:34,220 --> 02:03:37,200
but I go to your point about where the 
people are stupid or not.

2625
02:03:37,590 --> 02:03:40,110
I think that's an unkind way of phrasing
it.

2626
02:03:40,560 --> 02:03:41,820
I'm an uncommon dude,
but,

2627
02:03:41,950 --> 02:03:44,580
but actually no one has the time,
you know,

2628
02:03:44,630 --> 02:03:45,463
we have jobs to do and to be informed on
all the subjects you would need to be 

2629
02:03:48,661 --> 02:03:52,910
informed on to make the right decisions 
to run the country you would.

2630
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:54,780
No one has the time.
So very good point.

2631
02:03:54,781 --> 02:03:55,614
We need people to specialize in these 
things and it's like brexit was a 

2632
02:03:58,591 --> 02:03:59,980
triumph of,
uh,

2633
02:03:59,981 --> 02:04:02,190
you know,
in the uk when it was put to the vote,

2634
02:04:02,191 --> 02:04:04,410
this massive decision whether to be the 
eu.

2635
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:05,603
No one in that space of time as a member
of the electorate could educate 

2636
02:04:09,061 --> 02:04:13,290
themselves to the point where they could
make an informed choice on and so people

2637
02:04:13,291 --> 02:04:14,160
thought,
you know what,

2638
02:04:14,161 --> 02:04:16,680
I just want to have something different,
let's vote for a change.

2639
02:04:16,681 --> 02:04:19,530
And we had brexit with,
I would argue,

2640
02:04:19,531 --> 02:04:20,880
disastrous results

2641
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:22,393
temporarily disastrous,
but to be seen whether or not it was 

2642
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:32,060
disastrous friend steve hilton,
who a very bright guy who's been on this

2643
02:04:32,061 --> 02:04:34,490
podcast before,
he was david cameron's righthand man.

2644
02:04:34,850 --> 02:04:35,683
He actually is a supporter of brexit and
that's one of the things that he had a 

2645
02:04:37,921 --> 02:04:40,110
problem with cameron over.
They had a falling out.

2646
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:41,550
Um,
I want to talk to him,

2647
02:04:41,551 --> 02:04:43,200
sit down with him.
I don't know enough of it.

2648
02:04:43,201 --> 02:04:46,410
I don't really follow any politics.
I barely follow the United States.

2649
02:04:46,660 --> 02:04:47,493
I had,
I didn't know what the fuck brexit was 

2650
02:04:48,811 --> 02:04:51,090
until it was going down and everybody 
was saying is the end of the world.

2651
02:04:51,730 --> 02:04:52,950
Yeah,
I mean,

2652
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:53,933
I agree.
Like I feel as though it's easy to go 

2653
02:04:56,401 --> 02:05:00,230
along with the group think.
But um,

2654
02:05:01,980 --> 02:05:03,660
I was in favor of staying in europe.
Well,

2655
02:05:03,661 --> 02:05:04,494
when I'm talking about representative 
government when I'm talking about is 

2656
02:05:06,571 --> 02:05:07,404
like this electoral college set up and 
the one person one vote set up and that 

2657
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:14,293
the idea that 300 plus million people 
are going to be represented by just a 

2658
02:05:18,601 --> 02:05:19,530
handful of people.

2659
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,880
I agree with that.
Yeah.

2660
02:05:20,881 --> 02:05:24,990
I mean the whole way in which bernie 
saunders was marginalized I think,

2661
02:05:25,280 --> 02:05:29,280
and likewise in a way the fact that 
trump could run away with it.

2662
02:05:29,281 --> 02:05:32,330
It's me.
It's just fascinating how he managed opt

2663
02:05:32,480 --> 02:05:34,720
overturned the apple cart.
I hadn't,

2664
02:05:34,810 --> 02:05:35,643
you know,
I haven't really grappled with the 

2665
02:05:36,091 --> 02:05:36,924
minutia of how us democracy works,
but it seems to me like it's a really 

2666
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:43,950
bizarre arcane system with delegates and
whatnot.

2667
02:05:44,010 --> 02:05:45,480
Exactly.
Who came up with that?

2668
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,760
Well,
they caMe up with it back when there was

2669
02:05:47,761 --> 02:05:48,594
nO communication.
Then they came up with it back when you 

2670
02:05:50,581 --> 02:05:51,414
had to take a horse and you had to carry
a handwritten letter across the country 

2671
02:05:54,241 --> 02:05:57,390
to communicate with people and that was 
just ineffective.

2672
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:58,433
They had to figure out how to have 
people in your various states and 

2673
02:06:01,201 --> 02:06:05,190
various counties and various districts 
represent the greater good of the people

2674
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:09,210
and also have the ability to decide over
the rest of the people.

2675
02:06:09,450 --> 02:06:10,283
That's one of the things that people 
don't even realize in representative 

2676
02:06:11,941 --> 02:06:12,774
government.
When you have this one person who 

2677
02:06:14,071 --> 02:06:16,170
represents a group of the people.
If the group of the people,

2678
02:06:16,380 --> 02:06:18,690
the group decides to vote for hillary 
clinton,

2679
02:06:18,691 --> 02:06:20,370
that one person doesn't have to agree 
with that.

2680
02:06:20,910 --> 02:06:21,743
It's a weird,
funky system and it's designed for back 

2681
02:06:24,691 --> 02:06:25,524
when people were illiterate and there's 
a bunch of farmers and pilgrims and 

2682
02:06:29,251 --> 02:06:30,084
savages that came over from europe on 
rafts and made it to America and just 

2683
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:35,453
fucking have at it and they're trying to
trying to manage this and trying to to 

2684
02:06:39,290 --> 02:06:40,123
try to figure out how to take the 
founder fathers ideas and best keep it 

2685
02:06:45,181 --> 02:06:46,014
all together while they're exploring 
this whole new world and dealing with 

2686
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:51,293
governing these people that were 
literally thousands of miles away that 

2687
02:06:53,581 --> 02:06:57,300
you couldn't even reach.
We can do that now instantaneously.

2688
02:06:57,301 --> 02:06:58,920
Someone can send a facebook message.

2689
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:00,390
They can send an email,
they can,

2690
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:01,253
they can tweet,
you can find out what people's opinions 

2691
02:07:03,091 --> 02:07:05,490
are,
but then it becomes whether or not these

2692
02:07:05,491 --> 02:07:10,140
people are qualified to decide which 
direction the country goes.

2693
02:07:10,680 --> 02:07:12,090
Well,
if they're not qualified,

2694
02:07:12,091 --> 02:07:16,800
we should probably figure out what the 
fuck we can do to make people more aware

2695
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:20,550
of what are the consequences of all 
these different decisions that are going

2696
02:07:20,551 --> 02:07:21,384
to be made by our politicians because 
there's a lot of stuff that gets made 

2697
02:07:25,830 --> 02:07:28,440
when it comes to disasters,
implications for the environment.

2698
02:07:28,441 --> 02:07:31,020
I mean when obama was in office,
he.

2699
02:07:31,030 --> 02:07:31,863
He is set so much in,
in order are so much in motion that 

2700
02:07:37,630 --> 02:07:41,860
environmentalists and people that are 
against offshore drilling.

2701
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:42,913
I mean there's a lot of fracking and 
offshore drilling and all sorts of 

2702
02:07:45,311 --> 02:07:46,144
things that could potentially have 
disastrous implications that were set 

2703
02:07:50,021 --> 02:07:53,740
forth by him that no one had any say in 
no.

2704
02:07:53,741 --> 02:07:54,574
No person in America that it was just a 
regular citizen had any say in these 

2705
02:07:58,571 --> 02:08:00,430
major decisions.
Like,

2706
02:08:00,550 --> 02:08:01,383
you know,
mark ruffalo just tweeted something 

2707
02:08:02,501 --> 02:08:03,334
about all the different offshore oil 
rigs that obama had agreed to while he 

2708
02:08:09,281 --> 02:08:11,320
was in office.
And it's disturbing really.

2709
02:08:11,380 --> 02:08:11,940
That's interesting.

2710
02:08:11,940 --> 02:08:13,020
See,
I have to say,

2711
02:08:13,021 --> 02:08:14,430
is it someone who,
you know,

2712
02:08:14,431 --> 02:08:15,264
who,
who resides in the uk and more used to 

2713
02:08:17,191 --> 02:08:18,024
the british system,
the biggest shock when you come over 

2714
02:08:20,791 --> 02:08:21,624
here is during the election cycle,
the amount of money that gets spent and 

2715
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:25,404
the length of the campaigns and for all 
its flaws and in britain there's a cap 

2716
02:08:30,121 --> 02:08:32,010
on how much they can spend on their 
campaign.

2717
02:08:32,011 --> 02:08:36,480
So they have like one or two tv ads each
and then a couple of posters,

2718
02:08:36,481 --> 02:08:37,314
but they do not do anything on the scale
of what happens here and the amount of 

2719
02:08:40,801 --> 02:08:43,080
money that gets spent.
And it's just insane.

2720
02:08:43,680 --> 02:08:44,513
So it does seem,
it has all the hallmarks of a broken 

2721
02:08:46,321 --> 02:08:47,460
system.
I would say.

2722
02:08:47,600 --> 02:08:48,351
Well,
not only that,

2723
02:08:48,351 --> 02:08:51,050
there's two recognized parties in 
anything else.

2724
02:08:51,051 --> 02:08:52,700
You're throwing your vote away.
That's the,

2725
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:54,050
that's the implication.
That's what,

2726
02:08:54,051 --> 02:08:55,980
that's how people think.
And um,

2727
02:08:56,010 --> 02:08:56,990
you know,
uh,

2728
02:08:57,140 --> 02:08:57,973
tom rhodes friend of mine was in,
he lived in holland for quite a quite a 

2729
02:09:01,671 --> 02:09:02,504
while and he was talking about the 
variety of candidates to choose from in 

2730
02:09:05,541 --> 02:09:08,390
holland and now they just have so many 
different people.

2731
02:09:08,660 --> 02:09:09,493
They have conservative liberals,
they have conservative green party 

2732
02:09:11,901 --> 02:09:12,734
candidates,
they have liberal green party 

2733
02:09:13,851 --> 02:09:14,684
candidates.
They have,

2734
02:09:14,930 --> 02:09:15,763
I mean it just goes across this wide 
range of different philosophies on how 

2735
02:09:20,331 --> 02:09:21,164
to govern and people get a better sense 
of what would they would like or what 

2736
02:09:25,971 --> 02:09:28,790
they agree with most because this hard 
line,

2737
02:09:28,791 --> 02:09:29,624
right and hard line left in this rigid 
ideology that you have to subscribe to 

2738
02:09:33,201 --> 02:09:35,420
on both sides.
Like if you're on the right,

2739
02:09:35,421 --> 02:09:38,030
you don't support gay marriage,
you're antiabortion,

2740
02:09:38,080 --> 02:09:39,020
you're this,
you're that,

2741
02:09:39,021 --> 02:09:40,760
you want gun rights,
you want this,

2742
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:43,460
you know,
fuck immigration,

2743
02:09:43,461 --> 02:09:44,294
you know,
there's all this stuff that you have to 

2744
02:09:45,411 --> 02:09:47,570
kind of agree to if you agree to the 
right.

2745
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:48,613
And then on the left you have to agree 
to a lot of things that people may not 

2746
02:09:52,011 --> 02:09:54,820
necessarily agree as well.
So it's,

2747
02:09:54,830 --> 02:09:55,663
it's,
it's so complicated to have a two party 

2748
02:09:57,411 --> 02:10:01,580
system and try to pretend that there's a
real democracy that is.

2749
02:10:01,740 --> 02:10:04,700
And it's not really democracy.
So representative governor.

2750
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:06,020
Yeah,
I mean that's,

2751
02:10:06,110 --> 02:10:06,943
that's for sure.
Do you think trump's got a chance of 

2752
02:10:08,521 --> 02:10:08,830
winning?

2753
02:10:08,830 --> 02:10:09,790
Yes,
I do.

2754
02:10:09,791 --> 02:10:14,290
Especially if if people find out what 
hillary has really been involved in,

2755
02:10:14,590 --> 02:10:16,330
I mean if they really start hammering 
that,

2756
02:10:16,350 --> 02:10:16,601
look,
we,

2757
02:10:16,601 --> 02:10:18,880
we've a few months to go.
It's only august.

2758
02:10:19,090 --> 02:10:22,870
We have to go through all of september,
all of october and then november.

2759
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:26,440
That's a lot of time and in that time 
crazy shit can come out

2760
02:10:26,510 --> 02:10:27,343
and it seems,
I mean I've read in the la times that 

2761
02:10:29,091 --> 02:10:34,091
he's already on a mini rebound based on 
this semi he delivered last week

2762
02:10:34,490 --> 02:10:35,323
and that if he could tone it down a 
couple of notches and just sort of 

2763
02:10:39,111 --> 02:10:43,100
appeal to a few more women just seem a 
little bit less insane.

2764
02:10:43,210 --> 02:10:45,320
Yeah.
He will climb in the poll numbers,

2765
02:10:45,470 --> 02:10:48,650
he could do it while she's under to 
criminal investigations.

2766
02:10:48,651 --> 02:10:49,484
And there's also plenty of video out 
there where there's a direct 

2767
02:10:51,501 --> 02:10:52,334
contradiction between what the fbi has 
said they were investigating what she 

2768
02:10:55,431 --> 02:10:58,340
was guilty of and then what she has said
they said.

2769
02:10:58,580 --> 02:11:01,010
So she's not honest,
she's just not.

2770
02:11:01,400 --> 02:11:02,233
I mean it's pretty clear when you 
compare many things to what she said 

2771
02:11:06,201 --> 02:11:09,320
versus the actual facts.
Just she's a lawyer,

2772
02:11:09,470 --> 02:11:13,310
she's a lawyer who became a politician.
She's a career politician.

2773
02:11:13,311 --> 02:11:14,540
She knows what to do.
She's,

2774
02:11:14,840 --> 02:11:18,980
she's got teflon and her dna and she 
keeps plowing forward no matter what.

2775
02:11:18,981 --> 02:11:21,590
She doesn't do interviews,
she's not doing these rallies.

2776
02:11:21,590 --> 02:11:23,780
She's just,
she's just going forward.

2777
02:11:23,781 --> 02:11:26,240
And It's very bizarre.
this also a lot of questions.

2778
02:11:26,241 --> 02:11:27,074
I mean dr drew did some big thing the 
other day talking about her health 

2779
02:11:30,350 --> 02:11:31,183
because she had fallen down in 2012 and 
apparently like had a blood clot in her 

2780
02:11:35,091 --> 02:11:38,870
brain and really hurt herself really 
badly and it her advanced age,

2781
02:11:38,871 --> 02:11:39,704
this is a really dangerous condition.
And he talked about her healthcare and 

2782
02:11:42,711 --> 02:11:45,950
talked about the care that she received 
and what the diagnosis was.

2783
02:11:45,951 --> 02:11:47,120
And he's like,
this is not.

2784
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:52,160
This is dangerous stuff and so who knows
how much of her behavior,

2785
02:11:52,170 --> 02:11:53,003
because traumatic brain injuries are 
really significant when it comes to the 

2786
02:11:55,791 --> 02:12:00,710
way your brain works post injury,
although the way you behave,

2787
02:12:01,220 --> 02:12:03,040
impulsive behavior.
Um,

2788
02:12:03,080 --> 02:12:06,050
I made a prediction.
I made a program on that subject.

2789
02:12:06,140 --> 02:12:08,330
Did you last year,
what was it about?

2790
02:12:08,860 --> 02:12:09,980
It was,
it was cold,

2791
02:12:10,010 --> 02:12:12,300
it was cold,
a different brain and it was,

2792
02:12:12,360 --> 02:12:13,193
it was set in a brain injury 
rehabilitation clinic in the uk and it 

2793
02:12:16,401 --> 02:12:20,450
was basically about serious personality 
changes in the wake of a traumatic brain

2794
02:12:20,451 --> 02:12:22,580
injury,
as you say,

2795
02:12:22,581 --> 02:12:23,660
impulsivity.

2796
02:12:23,710 --> 02:12:25,670
Um,
sometimes a lack of empathy,

2797
02:12:26,540 --> 02:12:30,110
erratic behavior and,
and it was about a god.

2798
02:12:30,260 --> 02:12:31,093
People inevitably is about the 
relationships that they're in and the 

2799
02:12:34,161 --> 02:12:38,660
way in which people have to adapt around
to the new needs and you know.

2800
02:12:38,720 --> 02:12:39,590
Yeah,
it was,

2801
02:12:39,620 --> 02:12:41,540
it's unbelievable stuff.
I mean,

2802
02:12:41,541 --> 02:12:42,231
you told you about.
I mean,

2803
02:12:42,231 --> 02:12:43,064
you know better than anyone from those 
sports kind of interest that I'm post 

2804
02:12:46,941 --> 02:12:48,380
boxing,
post nfl,

2805
02:12:48,381 --> 02:12:49,870
post hockey.
If you,

2806
02:12:49,940 --> 02:12:53,450
if you're a fighter in hockey team and 
pr pro wrestling too,

2807
02:12:53,660 --> 02:12:55,610
there's Been several terrific 
documentaries.

2808
02:12:55,611 --> 02:13:00,611
One by steve james cold,
I'm head games and a few others that all

2809
02:13:00,870 --> 02:13:05,870
examine the levels of erratic behavior 
after an nfl career.

2810
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:09,230
Unreal,
whether it's divorce,

2811
02:13:09,290 --> 02:13:11,100
bankruptcY,
suicide or,

2812
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:12,180
or,
you know,

2813
02:13:12,200 --> 02:13:14,390
serious depression.
It's off the charts.

2814
02:13:14,570 --> 02:13:15,291
Yeah.
Um,

2815
02:13:15,291 --> 02:13:16,124
I've seen it firsthand.
I've seen it firsthand from friends who 

2816
02:13:19,220 --> 02:13:20,053
became erratic and became really 
unstable after getting beat a few times 

2817
02:13:24,051 --> 02:13:26,840
in mixed martial arts fights.
I've seen it from boxers,

2818
02:13:26,841 --> 02:13:29,210
people that I knew when I was young and 
then I met them 10,

2819
02:13:29,211 --> 02:13:31,740
15 years later and they were just.
Life was a mass.

2820
02:13:31,741 --> 02:13:32,100
They become.

2821
02:13:32,100 --> 02:13:32,933
Alcoholics have a huge issue with their 
endocrine system and they supplement 

2822
02:13:37,531 --> 02:13:40,440
with alcohol and drugs to try to self 
medicate.

2823
02:13:40,980 --> 02:13:44,430
It becoMes a real problem in the brain 
is very fragile.

2824
02:13:44,431 --> 02:13:47,190
It's,
it's connected with this very,

2825
02:13:47,191 --> 02:13:50,850
very sOft connective tissue that keeps 
it in place inside the head.

2826
02:13:50,851 --> 02:13:53,670
It's just not meant to be hit that much,
you know,

2827
02:13:53,671 --> 02:13:57,070
you're meant to like survive a few bumps
and bruises and that's what it's kind of

2828
02:13:57,090 --> 02:13:58,740
designed for.
And anything else,

2829
02:13:59,130 --> 02:13:59,963
especially prolonged continued abuse 
like that can have dire consequences or 

2830
02:14:04,530 --> 02:14:07,800
one significant injury can have dire 
consequences.

2831
02:14:07,870 --> 02:14:08,703
The one significant one that can be life
changing or in the sports context to 

2832
02:14:12,450 --> 02:14:13,283
concussions,
I'm sure you know back to back within a 

2833
02:14:14,731 --> 02:14:15,564
single sort of space of time,
like one game you're the first one is 

2834
02:14:18,531 --> 02:14:19,364
not good,
but the second one is cataclysmic 

2835
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:22,313
happens a lot of times where people deny
the first concussion and they go right 

2836
02:14:24,811 --> 02:14:27,540
back to playing football or they go 
right back to sparring.

2837
02:14:27,990 --> 02:14:32,610
It's a huge issue.
You think hillary may have a tbi,

2838
02:14:32,880 --> 02:14:34,530
traumatic brain injury?
Well,

2839
02:14:34,710 --> 02:14:38,640
I'm no doctor obviously,
but she definitely had a traumatic brain

2840
02:14:38,641 --> 02:14:41,280
injury.
She fell and she had a blood clot in her

2841
02:14:41,281 --> 02:14:42,114
brain.
I mean this is all open public record 

2842
02:14:43,741 --> 02:14:46,500
that diagnosis,
when you have a blood clot on your brain

2843
02:14:46,501 --> 02:14:50,160
at 60 something years of age,
that is incredibly dangerous.

2844
02:14:50,460 --> 02:14:51,293
It's really bad.
And then you have to dress like what 

2845
02:14:53,041 --> 02:14:53,874
made her pass out in the first place?
Like what made her black out when she 

2846
02:14:56,341 --> 02:14:58,620
fell down and hit her head.
That's not good.

2847
02:14:58,920 --> 02:14:59,753
I think what we,
what we really need in this country is 

2848
02:15:02,611 --> 02:15:07,060
like some altruistic elan musk type 
character,

2849
02:15:07,061 --> 02:15:07,894
some real genius.
Someone who's like a really brilliant 

2850
02:15:10,531 --> 02:15:11,364
person who sees the state,
the country's in and offErs some 

2851
02:15:14,791 --> 02:15:15,624
intelligent,
well thought out solutions that doesn't 

2852
02:15:18,481 --> 02:15:21,360
exist because those people are too busy 
doing whatever they're doing.

2853
02:15:21,450 --> 02:15:25,400
So what we're left with his career 
politicians and then this madman.

2854
02:15:25,410 --> 02:15:28,440
Who's a reality tv star,
a casino man.

2855
02:15:29,160 --> 02:15:32,700
I don't.
I don't think that our system is good.

2856
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:33,713
I think it's very archaic and I think 
it's just not the best we can do and I 

2857
02:15:38,041 --> 02:15:41,610
think we're just going to continue to 
use it until it blows up in our face.

2858
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:42,833
It's like instead of redesigning cars,
we've got some model t and we're keep 

2859
02:15:45,871 --> 02:15:50,070
adding turbo chargers to it and fucking 
bigger wheels and someone says,

2860
02:15:50,071 --> 02:15:51,870
hey man,
I think we can make a better car.

2861
02:15:51,871 --> 02:15:54,320
Fuck that.
This is our car usa,

2862
02:15:54,360 --> 02:15:55,780
usa.
And they keep.

2863
02:15:56,060 --> 02:15:56,893
They keep slapping bolts and fucking 
rivets and screwing this thing in place 

2864
02:16:00,811 --> 02:16:01,644
and it's not good.
It's not a good system and it's not the 

2865
02:16:03,991 --> 02:16:04,824
best we can do.
It's certainly not ideal and I think 

2866
02:16:06,361 --> 02:16:10,320
human beings in all areas of life,
other than our political system,

2867
02:16:10,620 --> 02:16:13,470
we have advanced radically since the 17 
hundreds.

2868
02:16:13,710 --> 02:16:17,340
If you look at the way we approach 
education,

2869
02:16:17,550 --> 02:16:19,890
if you look at our ability to 
communicate with each other,

2870
02:16:19,891 --> 02:16:22,210
you look at technology,
the innovation and the,

2871
02:16:22,211 --> 02:16:22,581
the,
the,

2872
02:16:22,581 --> 02:16:23,414
the constant expanding of our horizons 
and possibilities as far as what we're 

2873
02:16:26,881 --> 02:16:27,714
capable of with technology.
All those things radically improved 

2874
02:16:30,101 --> 02:16:32,860
since then.
But we still have this goofy system that

2875
02:16:32,861 --> 02:16:36,220
was created back when people rode.
Horses wrote with feathers.

2876
02:16:36,430 --> 02:16:38,250
And when you wanted a picture of 
something,

2877
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:39,880
you had to draw it.
I mean,

2878
02:16:39,910 --> 02:16:41,470
that is,
that is done.

2879
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:42,483
But that's great because that's a great 
metaphor for the human brain in a way 

2880
02:16:44,851 --> 02:16:47,560
and,
and kind of a big thought to carry us as

2881
02:16:47,561 --> 02:16:50,770
we sort of Georgia the closer barbecue,
but you know,

2882
02:16:51,010 --> 02:16:52,840
because that is the brain,
you know,

2883
02:16:53,590 --> 02:16:55,810
our brains are hinged around,
um,

2884
02:16:56,080 --> 02:16:58,270
the of most parts of our,
of our brain,

2885
02:16:58,271 --> 02:16:59,104
the amygdala,
which is essentially reptilian in 

2886
02:17:00,731 --> 02:17:01,541
origin,
you know,

2887
02:17:01,541 --> 02:17:02,374
and so many of our deepest impulses,
the fear response and so forth are 

2888
02:17:06,881 --> 02:17:10,000
programmed from a kind of evolutionary 
heritage.

2889
02:17:10,001 --> 02:17:10,834
You know,
we've got neurocircuits that go back 

2890
02:17:13,060 --> 02:17:16,260
thousands if not millions of years.
And you know,

2891
02:17:16,300 --> 02:17:17,133
that metaphor you use to describe our 
political system of being an old jalopy 

2892
02:17:19,751 --> 02:17:23,320
that's been turbocharged is in essence 
what our brains are.

2893
02:17:23,321 --> 02:17:25,510
And you know,
as muCh as it would be lovely to believe

2894
02:17:25,511 --> 02:17:26,344
that technology and our ability to 
control nature and control our 

2895
02:17:29,081 --> 02:17:33,880
environment had been hand in hand with 
sort of a moral and civilizational,

2896
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:35,213
uh,
improvement that you could deduce maybe 

2897
02:17:38,171 --> 02:17:39,004
as many examples that suggests that all 
it's done is allowed us to do 

2898
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:46,630
everything,
whether for good or ill more efficiently

2899
02:17:46,631 --> 02:17:49,360
and more effectively.
So we can help more people,

2900
02:17:49,361 --> 02:17:52,030
we can blow more people up,
you can drive faster,

2901
02:17:52,031 --> 02:17:54,160
but you can drive faster away from a 
crime.

2902
02:17:54,220 --> 02:17:55,660
Do you know what I mean?
So,

2903
02:17:55,690 --> 02:17:58,750
uh,
I don't hold out any huge hope,

2904
02:17:58,830 --> 02:18:03,430
um,
that there'll be a positive change.

2905
02:18:03,460 --> 02:18:04,840
We also see,
I think,

2906
02:18:04,870 --> 02:18:06,700
I mean,
I might be wrong sometimes I read things

2907
02:18:06,701 --> 02:18:07,534
that persuade me otherwise

2908
02:18:07,760 --> 02:18:11,430
I think that were more advanced and more
safe now than ever before.

2909
02:18:11,431 --> 02:18:13,620
I think if you look back on 2000 years 
ago,

2910
02:18:13,621 --> 02:18:14,454
when you look at today,
which is just a blink of the eye in 

2911
02:18:15,571 --> 02:18:16,404
terms of the age of the earth,
it's infinitely better to live today 

2912
02:18:19,171 --> 02:18:19,800
than it is

2913
02:18:19,800 --> 02:18:22,170
certainly here in America or in the 
west.

2914
02:18:22,171 --> 02:18:23,020
But you know,
in an,

2915
02:18:23,080 --> 02:18:25,650
in a global six,
is it 6 billion?

2916
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:27,060
So I think it's seven.
If you were going to,

2917
02:18:27,150 --> 02:18:30,540
if you were dropped at random on earth,
where would you wear?

2918
02:18:30,541 --> 02:18:32,370
I mean,
chances are You wouldn't be joe rogan.

2919
02:18:32,371 --> 02:18:36,030
You would probably be what I would you 
probably be.

2920
02:18:36,060 --> 02:18:41,060
Well there's places makIng apple phones 
in a factory.

2921
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:41,993
You could be,
or you could be in China living in some 

2922
02:18:44,011 --> 02:18:44,844
sky rise,
being some multibillionaire cell phone 

2923
02:18:49,020 --> 02:18:51,240
magnate.
Who the hell knows,

2924
02:18:51,330 --> 02:18:51,940
you know,
I mean,

2925
02:18:51,940 --> 02:18:55,800
there's certainly some wonderful spots 
in the world outside of America.

2926
02:18:55,870 --> 02:18:57,390
There's certainly some great places to 
live.

2927
02:18:57,391 --> 02:19:00,450
Even if you live in poverty,
you could live a wonderful,

2928
02:19:00,451 --> 02:19:01,284
happy life that's way safer than it 
would be thousands and thousands of 

2929
02:19:04,741 --> 02:19:07,140
years ago.
The internet is pretty much worldwide.

2930
02:19:07,960 --> 02:19:10,740
Cell phones are pretty much available 
everywhere now.

2931
02:19:10,920 --> 02:19:14,490
And so I think that access to 
communication is going to change the way

2932
02:19:14,491 --> 02:19:17,880
people view the world because they're 
going to have more data to choose from.

2933
02:19:17,881 --> 02:19:20,850
They're gonna have more cherry picking 
that they can do.

2934
02:19:20,851 --> 02:19:24,240
They can certainly have more 
confirmation bias and stick to their own

2935
02:19:24,241 --> 02:19:25,074
group.
Like we're talking about when 

2936
02:19:25,891 --> 02:19:26,724
scientologists who don't go on the 
internet and don't take any suppressive 

2937
02:19:29,211 --> 02:19:32,210
information and don't watch any videos.
and I think,

2938
02:19:32,211 --> 02:19:33,044
um,
I think what I'd like about your 

2939
02:19:35,181 --> 02:19:36,014
approach and what I like about what 
you're saying when it comes to 

2940
02:19:37,971 --> 02:19:40,280
scientology,
is that you're not a mean person.

2941
02:19:40,281 --> 02:19:42,800
You're not like mocking them and you 
don't want to shit on them.

2942
02:19:43,070 --> 02:19:47,000
What you want to do is you want to look 
at them for what they really are and try

2943
02:19:47,001 --> 02:19:47,834
to get a real good understanding of it.
One of my favorite parts of the trailer 

2944
02:19:51,140 --> 02:19:54,050
was that guy filming you and you're 
filming him and you go,

2945
02:19:54,180 --> 02:19:55,760
are you making a documentary too?

2946
02:19:56,670 --> 02:19:57,910
Well,
and that's it,

2947
02:19:57,911 --> 02:19:59,370
isn't it?
because you don't want to,

2948
02:19:59,371 --> 02:20:01,170
you know,
if I can quote nature,

2949
02:20:01,660 --> 02:20:03,490
which is kind of a sophomore,
they do,

2950
02:20:03,491 --> 02:20:06,760
but it's the idea of like you do when 
you were.

2951
02:20:06,830 --> 02:20:08,860
When you look into the obesity of 
bisquick sold to and to you,

2952
02:20:08,861 --> 02:20:12,070
like when you fiGht monsters don't 
become a monster and I don't want to.

2953
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:13,213
They're the bullies.
In many cases I didn't want to bully 

2954
02:20:15,611 --> 02:20:16,444
them back and I didn't want to be 
trapped into a paradigm of us against 

2955
02:20:19,541 --> 02:20:22,210
them and I was really trying to say,
look,

2956
02:20:22,211 --> 02:20:23,310
let's keep.
I don't want.

2957
02:20:23,311 --> 02:20:25,360
I don't.
I want to see the human in you,

2958
02:20:26,080 --> 02:20:29,050
not just an agent for an oppressive 
regime.

2959
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:30,610
I think that's beautiful.
I reallY do

2960
02:20:30,630 --> 02:20:35,510
do and I think that is a very measured 
and intelligent and wise way to approach

2961
02:20:35,511 --> 02:20:38,570
this and I I've enjoyed that about your 
other videos as well.

2962
02:20:38,900 --> 02:20:39,733
I think in that Sense you're very unique
in the way you approach documentary 

2963
02:20:43,220 --> 02:20:46,460
filmmaking and I think the 
scientologists,

2964
02:20:46,490 --> 02:20:49,190
they're not our enemies and the 
gentleman who left,

2965
02:20:49,191 --> 02:20:50,520
who was the number two guy,
what was his name?

2966
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:52,153
Look,
he's a perfect example that you're 

2967
02:20:53,001 --> 02:20:53,834
talking about.
A guy who was in it for two plus 

2968
02:20:54,951 --> 02:20:55,784
decades,
he left and he's sort of coming clean 

2969
02:20:58,341 --> 02:21:00,320
about all the stupid shit that he did 
when he was in there.

2970
02:21:00,590 --> 02:21:04,820
People become a prisoner of their 
earliest ideology,

2971
02:21:05,400 --> 02:21:06,233
the earliest ideology that they adopt,
and that's one of the problems with any 

2972
02:21:09,351 --> 02:21:11,960
sort of a group think whether it's a 
cult,

2973
02:21:12,010 --> 02:21:13,640
religion,
whatever the fuck you want to call it,

2974
02:21:14,270 --> 02:21:17,270
ideologies become problematic when you 
can't escape.

2975
02:21:17,300 --> 02:21:18,860
You can't vary.
You can't.

2976
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:19,753
You have to stick to the dogma.
You have to stick to the doctrine and 

2977
02:21:23,720 --> 02:21:26,180
that's not good for people.
It's not healthy.

2978
02:21:26,210 --> 02:21:27,043
It's not smart because I think the 
ability to communicate and open debate 

2979
02:21:30,770 --> 02:21:33,950
is why we've advanced to the point we're
at in the first place.

2980
02:21:34,190 --> 02:21:38,390
The suppressing of that is almost always
someone who has a bad idea.

2981
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:39,493
They're trying to shelter.
So when you see people that are chasing 

2982
02:21:41,541 --> 02:21:42,374
after someone because they're trying to 
communicate about something like you 

2983
02:21:45,710 --> 02:21:48,820
who's doing it super diy respectfully,
when,

2984
02:21:48,890 --> 02:21:49,723
when you see that what you have is a 
bunch of people that are trying to 

2985
02:21:52,071 --> 02:21:55,280
defend a bad idea and defend it with 
aggression.

2986
02:21:55,370 --> 02:21:55,630
Exactly

2987
02:21:55,630 --> 02:21:56,463
right.
and if the more you kind of become a 

2988
02:21:59,131 --> 02:22:02,190
mirror image of whatever,
whatever they're projecting,

2989
02:22:02,220 --> 02:22:03,053
you reinforce them in that position as 
well as from doing other stories about 

2990
02:22:06,541 --> 02:22:09,210
extreme religious beliefs like the 
westboro baptist church.

2991
02:22:09,211 --> 02:22:10,044
I know from people who I met who were in
the church when I made my documentary 

2992
02:22:13,411 --> 02:22:16,470
and then subsequently left that,
uh,

2993
02:22:16,471 --> 02:22:21,360
what short circuits their beliefs,
what allows them to see something bigger

2994
02:22:21,361 --> 02:22:24,330
than what they're in is when you treat 
them with kindness,

2995
02:22:24,350 --> 02:22:25,183
you know,
and instead of shouting back at them or 

2996
02:22:28,140 --> 02:22:28,973
hurling abuse back,
which just reinforces their view of you 

2997
02:22:31,831 --> 02:22:35,970
as an enemy of god or suppressive or 
however they characterize it,

2998
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:36,833
if you actually behave decently and 
attempt to robustly present your 

2999
02:22:40,501 --> 02:22:41,334
position,
but in a respectful way and with a kind 

3000
02:22:43,291 --> 02:22:48,291
of coming from a place of caring and 
empathy as opposed to sort of sense,

3001
02:22:48,780 --> 02:22:53,780
so hostile attitude that actually can be
much more effective.

3002
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:55,230
Absolutely.
You know,

3003
02:22:55,231 --> 02:22:57,810
as well as being humane.
Kudos to you sir.

3004
02:22:58,020 --> 02:22:58,853
I'll.
Thanks.

3005
02:22:59,250 --> 02:23:00,480
I'm a big fan.
I really am.

3006
02:23:00,481 --> 02:23:01,980
I'm,
I really appreciate you coming back here

3007
02:23:01,981 --> 02:23:05,540
and I'd love to have you back before the
grades out which jen,

3008
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:09,330
january.
And hopefully by then the scientologists

3009
02:23:09,331 --> 02:23:11,550
have they've wised up and they've maybe 
though,

3010
02:23:11,570 --> 02:23:12,403
and maybe that film will be out and we 
can be wonder if we can plug that 

3011
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:15,470
documentary.
Yeah,

3012
02:23:15,470 --> 02:23:17,400
we will.
Maybe their film was going to say,

3013
02:23:17,670 --> 02:23:18,660
louise,
a really great guy.

3014
02:23:18,670 --> 02:23:21,090
Yeah,
we investigated it.

3015
02:23:21,270 --> 02:23:24,210
We found out he really praCtices what he
preaches and we're sorry,

3016
02:23:24,630 --> 02:23:26,190
I don't think it will be,
but we'll see.

3017
02:23:26,850 --> 02:23:27,683
All right folks,
we'll be back in just a little bit with 

3018
02:23:30,150 --> 02:23:32,610
hannibal buress.
He'll be back at 5:00,

3019
02:23:32,611 --> 02:23:34,260
which is an hour from now,
so until then,

3020
02:23:34,680 --> 02:23:35,513
enjoy yourself.

3021
02:23:36,970 --> 02:23:38,440
Great.
