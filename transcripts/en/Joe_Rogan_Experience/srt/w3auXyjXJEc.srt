1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,353
This is what it is.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,570
Good friend Bert is a
fucking raging alcoholic.

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,330
He drinks six doubles a night.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:13,660
Yeah,

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,130
he's during a 12 drinks a night.

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,260
I'll tell you that in all honesty.

7
00:00:17,261 --> 00:00:18,094
Once again,

8
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:18,761
so we said,

9
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:20,230
do you think you'd get
to where he said yes.

10
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:20,771
Okay,

11
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,780
so then someone said
sober and run a marathon.

12
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:23,141
I was like,

13
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:24,070
stop you guys.

14
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:24,970
He's going to die.

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,350
I have a problem with teetotaling
when I worked with him in Milwaukee,

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:30,310
Hawaii,

17
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,143
Miami.

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,440
So we said,

19
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:33,040
okay,

20
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,040
how about no drinking for the entire
month of October and you got to do 15 hot

21
00:00:39,191 --> 00:00:40,810
yoga classes in a month.

22
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:41,710
Let's just,

23
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,280
let's just put the parameters down and
then just pretend you think I'm not lying

24
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:45,820
right now.

25
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,970
So everybody agreed to that and then a
couple of fucking days ago they started

26
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:49,540
saying,

27
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,770
we're going to be totally sober.

28
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:51,490
No weed,

29
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,091
no alcohol.

30
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:52,450
I go,

31
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:52,761
Whoa,

32
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,091
Whoa,

33
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:53,550
Whoa,

34
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,010
whoa.

35
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,330
Come on,

36
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:54,551
hold on.

37
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:54,851
Hold on.

38
00:00:54,851 --> 00:00:55,900
One came once they sober,

39
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:56,321
we're talking,

40
00:00:56,321 --> 00:00:57,154
we'd

41
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,340
when he's,

42
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:04,690
I can get into that place.

43
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,621
I can get into that.

44
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:05,771
No,

45
00:01:05,771 --> 00:01:06,491
we'd place for him.

46
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:06,890
I don't know.

47
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,690
Do you want to be their eyes and they're
trying to shame me into Quinten pot.

48
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:10,830
Yeah.

49
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,590
You want to just put weed in the bucket
and we'll that we'll do we just in case.

50
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,091
Okay.

51
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:16,811
We should think about it.

52
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:18,190
We should definitely not do anything rash.

53
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,083
I like it.

54
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:19,781
I like pod.

55
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:24,190
I'm not willing to not do it for
an alcoholic friend and a welcher.

56
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:24,760
Yeah,

57
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,331
that was the goal.

58
00:01:25,331 --> 00:01:26,164
Weight.

59
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:28,960
Get the tape measure.

60
00:01:28,961 --> 00:01:29,161
Why?

61
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:30,700
What's the fucking tape measure?

62
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,313
Wow.

63
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,850
What a cheap piece of shit.

64
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,840
What ain't cheap teas.

65
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,200
15 days a yoga,

66
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,670
31 days sober.

67
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,860
All of October,

68
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:41,920
October.

69
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,760
Maybe I'll do it in November.

70
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:44,170
November this month.

71
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,040
They can suck my dick.

72
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,330
I'm going to get high every day.
