1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:02,370
Boom,
and we're live.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,780
Why are you calling?
I'm alright.

3
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,620
How are you going on?
A lot of stuff happening,

4
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:08,400
man.
Yeah,

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:08,971
yeah.
First of all,

6
00:00:08,971 --> 00:00:10,140
thank you so much.
Pleasure.

7
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,250
This is amazing.
Well,

8
00:00:11,251 --> 00:00:13,970
Dave Rubin recommends you.
I listened to Dave Room is.

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,900
I don't want to send a whole lot of 
people's recommendations,

10
00:00:15,901 --> 00:00:19,890
but Dave Rubin's one of them.
He's been an amazing figure in my life.

11
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,180
Just in the last lesson,
even a month.

12
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,193
And he just,
he's kind of was like my savior when 

13
00:00:23,261 --> 00:00:26,040
like everyone was kicking me while I was
down.

14
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:28,770
He was the one that kind of reached a 
handout and so I owe him a great deal.

15
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:29,683
Well,
we should kind of explain what kicking 

16
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:31,734
you while you're down means because it's
silly to me than anything because it 

17
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:35,544
doesn't really make sense,
but you tweeted a joke and it's a real 

18
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,594
simple joke.

19
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,520
Jamie,
see if he could pull up the joke.

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,283
This is what happened.
Collin tweeted a joke about a day 

21
00:00:46,591 --> 00:00:50,280
without a woman and uh,
everybody knows that a day without what,

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,173
without a woman was like that day 
without a Mexican thing where you were 

23
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:54,751
supposed to like,
well,

24
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,760
imagine if there were no women.
Well,

25
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,710
if there were no women,
first of all,

26
00:00:58,711 --> 00:01:00,390
there'd be no fucking people.
So yeah.

27
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,370
Yes.
Women are super important for.

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,263
So you just write this tweet joke,
a peace and quiet hashtag a day without 

29
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:09,780
a woman.
I would laugh.

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,990
I would think it was funny and I would 
move on and that's it.

31
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,230
So then all the,
hold on a second,

32
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,430
put put,
put that Olivia,

33
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,120
look,
look,

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,500
go above that,
go above that.

35
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:20,640
Above it.
We'll get that.

36
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,890
Sent this tweet,
which was roundly condemned as sexist.

37
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,383
Yeah.
Not really true if you leave the gaming 

38
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:29,634
industry,
but a rapidly condemned in the gaming 

39
00:01:32,101 --> 00:01:32,940
industry for sure.

40
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,370
Outside of that,
people I think normal everyday,

41
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,940
people that don't have an ax to grind 
about literally everything found it,

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,893
you know,
reddit maybe growing or maybe laughed 

43
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:42,990
and then kept going about their day.
Like a normal person.

44
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,210
You're not allowed to have any 
personality anymore.

45
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:46,044
No.
If you work for any kind of accompany 

46
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:52,170
that is in any way public where you can 
be targeted,

47
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:53,010
where they can say,
oh,

48
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,630
that's the fucking God.
Go get them.

49
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,570
Like anything that's remotely 
controversial.

50
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:59,940
I mean that is a really remotely 
controversial.

51
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,510
It's just Al Bundy.
Yeah,

52
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:03,330
I mean it's not even a good joke.
And,

53
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,260
and uh,
you know,

54
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:04,870
yeah.
It's,

55
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,510
I,
I heard you and Jim Norton talking about

56
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:08,610
it by the way,
that video that someone clipped that out

57
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:10,770
and put it up on some youtube channel 
that's like a,

58
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:13,490
that's like a,
that video is going to be irrelevant.

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,730
My family forever.
Everyone was like,

60
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:16,050
I can't believe this.
What is going on?

61
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:19,470
This is so great so far.
I really do appreciate you stepping up.

62
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:21,450
And when I got your DM,
by the way on twitter,

63
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:22,284
I was like,
this is what an amazing turn of events 

64
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:24,750
this has been for me.
So I,

65
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,160
I really am appreciative of you.
Again,

66
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,530
I want you to know that.
Thank you.

67
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,540
Thank you.
Stop saying it makes me uncomfortable.

68
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,860
But uh,
but uh,

69
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,620
at the same time,
uh,

70
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,220
you know,
I,

71
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,053
I was in bed with my girlfriend actually
when I wrote it and I showed it to her 

72
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,610
and I was like,
this is kind of funny,

73
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:39,444
right?
It's kind of stupid.

74
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,613
And she laughed.
She,

75
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,453
she's an er nurse and she works the 
overnight shift so she was just getting 

76
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,780
into bed as I was getting up and she's 
like,

77
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:46,231
yeah,
it was funny.

78
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,850
Then we didn't really think twice about 
it.

79
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:49,080
I sent it,
I got in the shower,

80
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:49,914
I went about my day and uh,
and then when I got to work I realized 

81
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,890
that it was a much bigger deal than I 
had thought and it was,

82
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:58,830
and then everything fell apart and then 
it was rebuilt very quickly.

83
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:00,070
So.
Well

84
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,470
you resigned from the company that you 
worked for?

85
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,333
Yeah,
I found that I founded the company I 

86
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,130
owned a piece of.
And you resigned because of that?

87
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,150
Yeah,
yeah.

88
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,640
Other reasons too.
But I mean that was definitely the straw

89
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:11,980
that broke the camel's back for me yet.
What in the fuck,

90
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:12,910
man?
Yeah,

91
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,960
it was just,
I felt like,

92
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,803
how is it,
how is it possible that in this day and 

93
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,600
age,
that simple tweet,

94
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,420
by the way,
if you reverse the sexes in that tweet,

95
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:25,570
there's not a single man that would 
complain and if he did,

96
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,800
he's not a man.
Yeah,

97
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,634
I agree.
And I say also that if a person that 

98
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:29,944
wasn't a self described like moderate 
conservative or libertarian sent that 

99
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,364
joke,
it also wouldn't have gotten the 

100
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:36,280
firestorm.
That's the thing Joe,

101
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,114
is that you don't think a liberal man 
wouldn't have gotten a rash of shit and 

102
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,074
been sort of,
I think out of the community maybe in a 

103
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:46,540
different maybe in a different place,
but not in the gaming industry,

104
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,150
which is almost completely hyper 
liberal.

105
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,013
So I've had a target on my back for 
years and that's I think kind of the 

106
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:56,230
point that's lost on some people is that
this was just an opportunity.

107
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,410
No one was offended by this joke.
No one was a gas,

108
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,244
like I said on Rubin,
and the second time I was on there I 

109
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:03,180
said like no one was crying in their 
shower,

110
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:05,050
losing sleep,
tossing and turning over.

111
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:06,310
They had shown was,
well,

112
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,144
I hope so because that's what we should 
find that person and that person is 

113
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,370
studied them in a lab.
But to me I was like,

114
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:12,731
no,
this is.

115
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:13,210
I mean,
it was,

116
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,043
it was clear.
A few hours later when I finally 

117
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:15,820
realized what was happening,
I'm like,

118
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,230
this is,
they're in for the kill now.

119
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,980
This is,
this is.

120
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,813
They found their way to get me.
And so why do you think they wanted to 

121
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,420
quote unquote get you?

122
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,980
Uh,
because,

123
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,060
you know,
I live in San Francisco.

124
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:27,280
I've lived there for 10 years.
I was born and raised on long island,

125
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:31,660
but I went to college in Boston and then
I moved to San Francisco and um,

126
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,300
it is as cartoonishly liberal as 
everyone thinks it is.

127
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,470
So it's,
it's,

128
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,230
and the gaming industry is there,
the gaming media,

129
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:40,750
the people that write about games and 
cover them and do all that kind of stuff

130
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,613
there.
They're largely there and it's a huge 

131
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:43,804
echo chamber.
They don't like when people penetrate 

132
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:48,220
the Echo Chamber and uh,
I made a name for myself in the industry

133
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,054
over years.
I was the senior editor of the biggest 

134
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:52,930
gaming website in the world for years,
but websites,

135
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,000
[inaudible] dot com.
And uh,

136
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,900
and I was the senior editor there and 
uh,

137
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,113
I made a name for myself,
not only with criticism and with long 

138
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,610
form pieces but,
but,

139
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:01,444
but basically I was writing pieces about
political correctness in 2011 and 2012 

140
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,310
people going after game developers.

141
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,620
People going after all these things and 
me kind of standing up and saying,

142
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,650
this isn't okay.
This character assassination.

143
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,500
A good example for everyone out there 
that doesn't know games.

144
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,480
There's this game called borderlands 
two.

145
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,170
One of the developers was giving an 
interview about it.

146
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,610
He,
uh,

147
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:22,444
and this was back in I think 2011.
He said something to the nature of this 

148
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:25,954
mode.
This particular mode in the game is 

149
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:27,844
accessible for everyone.
It's like a girlfriend mode if you want 

150
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,330
your girlfriend to come play.
This was like a.

151
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,740
He said,
girl,

152
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,693
he insinuated that women can't play 
games and don't know how to play games 

153
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:36,014
where everybody using the term 
girlfriend when people went after this 

154
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,590
guy and tried to get them,
you know,

155
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,940
and I,
I wrote this piece saying like,

156
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:40,774
what the Hell is everyone doing?
This guy just is trying to explain 

157
00:05:42,761 --> 00:05:43,960
something,
he's not as sexist.

158
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:44,943
Why do you make these assumptions based 
on this one thing about him and why do 

159
00:05:46,511 --> 00:05:48,700
you want to ruin someone?
And that's the whole thing.

160
00:05:48,701 --> 00:05:49,534
They want to ruin people.
So I was outspoken about this and I was 

161
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,564
outspoken for my supportive Mitt Romney 
and I was outspoken about my sport for 

162
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,100
Gary Johnson and my house book.
So they don't like that.

163
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,300
They don't like that stuff.
And,

164
00:05:59,301 --> 00:05:59,961
and,
and,

165
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:01,700
uh,
I think that's pretty clear now.

166
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,950
So you feel like there's a sort of a 
reinforced type of thinking,

167
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,023
like a very liberal,
reinforced type of thinking that you 

168
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,770
must subscribe to if you want to be a 
part of this?

169
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,880
Yes.
It's an orthodoxy.

170
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:15,850
It's a complete and utter orthodoxy and 
it's,

171
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:18,050
it's,
it's what's so nice about this,

172
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,884
like the unintended consequence that I 
think is the silver lining of the dark 

173
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:24,650
cloud is people from the outside.
Now Saul firsthand,

174
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,960
like what I had been saying for a long 
time,

175
00:06:26,961 --> 00:06:27,794
which was,
which was like I was kind of on the 

176
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,310
fringe.
I was kind of being pushed out and I got

177
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,780
out literally thousands of people 
tweeting.

178
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:34,640
I mean facebook message me and doing 
everything being like,

179
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:35,810
wow,
this is fucking crazy.

180
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:37,370
These people really are out to get you.

181
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,980
Based on that,
you know,

182
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,010
you would think,
uh,

183
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,750
I,
I said some horrible,

184
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:44,120
just offensive,
just truly awful thing.

185
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,090
Do you think they're really out to get 
you or do you think they're capitalizing

186
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:47,924
on a moment where they feel like you 
have a target on you and they'll like 

187
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,230
kick him?
He's down.

188
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,183
We got them and some days,
but this reaction culture that we have 

189
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:59,210
like this over overreaction culture that
we find ourself in today,

190
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,463
it really does seem to foster that kind 
of behavior that people really like it 

191
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,703
when someone gets caught doing something
or when someone says something 

192
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:10,004
inappropriate when you could just point 
the finger and then everybody can pile 

193
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,100
on.
Yeah,

194
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:13,934
I think,
well let me put it a different way 

195
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:17,660
because I think you're probably right in
a sense in the sense that I.

196
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:19,940
I never gained the benefit of the doubt 
with this group.

197
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,750
Let's put it that way.
Right.

198
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,040
So.
So it was one thing.

199
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:22,874
It was just the one thing that dominoes 
there was tipped and it was in that and 

200
00:07:24,681 --> 00:07:25,514
they were down as opposed to.
That's why I brought up the example 

201
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:27,524
before of if one of the people that they
actually liked within that insular 

202
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:30,464
industry said the same thing.
They might have been a gas but they may 

203
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,390
might have reached a handout or given 
that person a second chance.

204
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,060
So I think that that all plays into the,
you know,

205
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:39,710
I have it the Gadsden flag as my 
twitter,

206
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,510
I kind of had that first,
since 2009.

207
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:42,600
I am,
you know,

208
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,890
I've not been shots and flag being don't
tread on one of the snake.

209
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,813
Right,
exactly.

210
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,060
Um,
uh,

211
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,333
so there are just certain things that 
may be very different than other people 

212
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:54,080
in the industry.
And I think that I definitely think that

213
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:54,440
that plays a.

214
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,273
what's your twitter name is no taxation,
which is a reference to the American 

215
00:07:57,531 --> 00:07:58,670
revolution,
which I know,

216
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,481
you know,
a lot of people think,

217
00:07:59,481 --> 00:08:00,200
well,
no,

218
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,981
no taxes.
I'm like,

219
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:02,000
that's not what it means.
I can't,

220
00:08:02,001 --> 00:08:04,430
I can't fit no taxation without 
representation on twitter.

221
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:05,570
That's why it doesn't say that.
Yeah,

222
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:06,890
that would be a long ass.
Yeah.

223
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,990
Unnecessarily long.
You'd have no room for tweets,

224
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,060
but it would make you very economical 
with your words.

225
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,940
That's what I love about twitter.
You probably feel the same way.

226
00:08:13,941 --> 00:08:14,774
I write something really long sometimes.
Then I have to Parse it and figure out 

227
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:18,314
how to make it fit.
And it feels so very good for joke 

228
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:20,500
writing,
like for,

229
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,750
for the skill of joke writing to make to
make things more concise.

230
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,810
Like I always tell people that I think 
the greatest joke writer or the greatest

231
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:31,430
comedian is Joey Diaz because he says he
gives you the most amount of visuals and

232
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,990
impact with the least amount of words.

233
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,063
It's just ba Ba ba Ba ba Ba ba.
He knows how to like sink it in really 

234
00:08:36,801 --> 00:08:39,530
quickly.
And twitter's like a good tool for that.

235
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,370
But not if that's a little ridiculous.
That's because you only back.

236
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,200
I don't know if that's the case how it 
is now,

237
00:08:45,201 --> 00:08:47,540
but we'll actually.
It definitely is.

238
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:49,370
Right?
Like if I write to you,

239
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,133
if I reply to you,
your name takes up a big chunk of what 

240
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,380
tweet for you,
but what you tweet doesn't take up.

241
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,243
So it's like the 140 characters would be
limiting people that respond to you 

242
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,940
rather than you tweeting.
Yeah,

243
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,500
exactly.
And the beauty is to,

244
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,334
as you've probably noticed,
is that I think in the last year or 

245
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:09,914
whatever,
they images you have to take up 

246
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:14,700
characters too and the videos and links 
and I think the links are the only thing

247
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,710
left that takes up the extra characters 
in addition to the name,

248
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:17,700
but it keeps everyone,
Kurt.

249
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,803
But that doesn't stop people from 
tweeting 7,000 times in a row and put 

250
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,260
numbers on them.
I've done it too.

251
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,143
Yeah,
I know I did it just yesterday when I 

252
00:09:23,971 --> 00:09:27,030
ran into some woman in San Francisco 
that I was walking my dog.

253
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:29,190
I have a Boston terrier.
She was like a little sicker.

254
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,850
Her poop was a little wet so I went and 
picked it up and I left like,

255
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,060
you know,
just like smear,

256
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,920
you'd have to use your fingernails to 
get off the ground.

257
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,280
So the woman came out of her apartment 
and started scolding me.

258
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:41,550
Like she was waiting by the,
by the window to scold me for this.

259
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:43,290
And I like,
what the Hell is going on?

260
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,200
So I had to tweet out a few tweets about
that just for it.

261
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,460
For posterity.
Yeah,

262
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,150
to the twitter thing is very weird,
but here's something that I really don't

263
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:53,400
like and I'm glad I don't see much of it
anymore.

264
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,960
Is that twit longer?
Shit.

265
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,830
Hey,
that's a loophole.

266
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,090
Yeah,
we don't do that.

267
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,390
Don't do that.
Ralphie may's do that shit all the time.

268
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,590
He used to read his tweets.
I'm like,

269
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,640
what the fuck?
Ralphie,

270
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,070
while you're writing paragraphs here,
you know what's going on?

271
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,031
Yeah.
Some people,

272
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:11,090
you know,
I've done it to a put.

273
00:10:11,091 --> 00:10:14,880
We'll like go in in photoshop and make a
paragraph of text and then make that the

274
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:16,660
image that you will do that on instagram
too.

275
00:10:16,661 --> 00:10:17,970
Oh yeah,
I've done that before.

276
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:20,430
I've drawn written things down and then 
taking a photo.

277
00:10:20,431 --> 00:10:21,600
I said I was going to do that for 
awhile.

278
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,730
That I think that twitter is just too 
impersonal.

279
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:25,920
I'm going to write all my stuff out and 
then take a picture of it,

280
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,760
but I was just fucking around.
I think if that's the exception,

281
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:30,510
the exception,
I think it's totally fine.

282
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,790
I don't want people to ruin in twitter.
I like the Curtis.

283
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,020
Yeah,
it's good.

284
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,130
It's good.
It's good format,

285
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,490
but it also makes it extremely easy for 
people to do what happened to you.

286
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:39,450
Yeah,
exactly.

287
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,860
Because there are nuances lost,
right?

288
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,440
Yeah.
He wants his last.

289
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,040
Well,
it's always lost in text.

290
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:46,410
I mean,
we're in writing.

291
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:48,750
It's very difficult.
Even if you're reading a book,

292
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:51,550
sometimes you have to go over the 
previous paragraphs.

293
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:53,910
We'll figure out exactly how this guy 
was setting this up,

294
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,040
but I think what's.
What's happening,

295
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,860
what you're saying.
I see there's two parts of one.

296
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,950
The example you gave before about the 
guy saying that like girlfriend mode,

297
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,460
if he just said,
it's like say if your girlfriend doesn't

298
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:11,340
play video games and she wants to really
easily accessible,

299
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,900
you could do it that way,
but I'd be.

300
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,610
People probably would attack them even 
for that.

301
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,883
It would say,
what are you implying that girls don't 

302
00:11:17,071 --> 00:11:18,240
play video games?
Well,

303
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,920
that's the impulse.
It's always the implication,

304
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:22,020
right?
Like everyone's always out to assume the

305
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:22,883
absolute worst announced.
We're always trying to write about like 

306
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:27,120
this guy is just trying to make an 
example.

307
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:29,220
He's probably given 15 pr interviews 
today.

308
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:30,054
He's probably exhausted.
He is also a developer so he doesn't 

309
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:32,364
have much PR training.
He's trying to just get the point 

310
00:11:34,051 --> 00:11:34,884
across.
Why do you have to assume the man is a 

311
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:38,340
sexist and a messages because of this 
one thing.

312
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:38,691
It,
it,

313
00:11:38,691 --> 00:11:39,524
it's,
I'm willing to die on that hill because 

314
00:11:40,891 --> 00:11:42,570
I feel like people deserve the benefit 
of the doubt.

315
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:45,360
People deserve to make a mistake or get 
a joke wrong or you know,

316
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:47,400
all those kinds of things.
And I feel like yes,

317
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,840
people are allowed to exercise their 
free speech on the other enemy.

318
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,590
Like I don't like that joke or I don't 
like this or I don't like that,

319
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:54,070
but it's,
it doesn't stop there

320
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,170
with what's going on with Dave Chappelle
this week.

321
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,490
I thought it was really actually 
interesting.

322
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,290
Uh,
with his two specials on Netflix.

323
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,650
People were freaking out about,
you know,

324
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,493
his jokes,
his,

325
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,430
his jokes about gay people or 
transgender people wherever.

326
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,080
Well as comparing transgender people to 
black people and you know,

327
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,780
and saying that it's a ridiculous 
comparison,

328
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,250
right?
Like,

329
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,340
like I,
I actually,

330
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,950
after I saw the,
all the,

331
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,784
all the stuff I went and watched the 
first one that I watched half of the 

332
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:18,990
second one and I was falling asleep so I
didn't want to watch it anymore,

333
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,400
but I was like,
this is funny.

334
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,370
And uh,
uh,

335
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,813
Anthony Jeselnik or Daniel tosh would 
make these people shit their pants 

336
00:12:27,341 --> 00:12:28,174
compared to the,
to what's going on with this kind of 

337
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:32,440
stuff.
And it's always this drama that seeks to

338
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:33,040
kind of,
it,

339
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,780
it doesn't stop at saying like,
I don't like it.

340
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:35,614
It's often insinuated or outright spoken
that they want to censor it or change 

341
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:39,154
it.
That's where I am because I was reading 

342
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:42,580
a piece specifically about chappelle 
where they're like,

343
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:46,150
this guy calls up questions as to why,
like how far should comedy go?

344
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,440
And I'm like,
no,

345
00:12:47,441 --> 00:12:48,580
that doesn't,
that doesn't call.

346
00:12:48,581 --> 00:12:50,950
And that's when the free speech argument
ends for me.

347
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,813
That's what I'm like.
You're actually now talking about 

348
00:12:52,781 --> 00:12:53,890
changing it.
Well,

349
00:12:53,891 --> 00:12:56,740
it doesn't work.
It doesn't work with US

350
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,400
comics.
It just doesn't work.

351
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:01,370
We're not going to do it.
It's too many people like it.

352
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,283
And I understand what they're trying to 
do because when they live in that world 

353
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:10,340
of cubicles and human resources and very
restricted patterns of behavior that you

354
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,820
have to follow,
if you live in an office environment and

355
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,180
working in an office environment or 
other,

356
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:15,493
you know,
there's a lot of people out there that 

357
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:17,324
are boxed into these terrible situations
where you have to pretend to be this 

358
00:13:19,851 --> 00:13:23,280
thing that you're not and you again,
you don't have any personality,

359
00:13:23,281 --> 00:13:24,114
you don't.
You're not allowed to say anything 

360
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:27,610
ridiculous or silly.
And when you,

361
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,620
you have that kind of environment and 
you see someone who's free,

362
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,150
like Dave Chappelle,
you,

363
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,700
you want to stop it.
And if you can,

364
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,010
if you can point something out that can,
oh look,

365
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,540
he's saying something that's 
inappropriate.

366
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,830
He's saying something I don't agree 
with.

367
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:41,300
He's saying something.
Let's get them,

368
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,193
let's go get them.
And then also in defense of the writers 

369
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,080
that are writing these articles,
look,

370
00:13:48,081 --> 00:13:48,914
they're in a bizarre environment where 
they have to fucking constantly defend 

371
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,740
like their position.
They have to constantly get clicks.

372
00:13:57,741 --> 00:13:58,574
They have to constantly get hits.
They can't just put an article out and 

373
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,900
nobody reads it.
They'll lose their job,

374
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,840
so they have to write about something 
that's inflammatory,

375
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:06,674
write about something that's salacious,
something that's going to get people 

376
00:14:08,661 --> 00:14:09,494
excited.
I mean that guy that wrote that thing 

377
00:14:11,331 --> 00:14:13,250
about you for the International Business
Times.

378
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,503
I looked into that international 
business times and one of the things 

379
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:16,904
about it is that there was a.
I think it was a mother Jones article 

380
00:14:19,281 --> 00:14:20,114
about that website where they were told 
that the people who write articles were 

381
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:29,060
given some ridiculous task like they 
have to get 10,000 hits per article.

382
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:29,894
They write,
so that might have for people don't 

383
00:14:31,401 --> 00:14:32,234
know.
There was a guy who wrote an article 

384
00:14:33,111 --> 00:14:36,370
about Collin where it said kind of 
funnies.

385
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,850
Collin Moriarty was resigns after 
writing a joke,

386
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,930
a racist joke that targeted women.
It wasn't racist,

387
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,793
even remote in the slightest,
but when you take into account the 

388
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:52,010
environment that these people are forced
work in and

389
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:52,371
you say,
well,

390
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:53,204
this guy literally,
it's forced to write something that's 

391
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:55,754
more fucked up than it really is.
So you have to get people excited about 

392
00:14:58,671 --> 00:14:59,504
this.
In a way that's going to get them to 

393
00:15:00,471 --> 00:15:03,770
click on it and hopefully get him to his
10,000 hit quota.

394
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,940
If that is true,
I feel for him in a way I feel.

395
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:10,130
I mean I think he's working for a shitty
business,

396
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,410
but it's the same way I feel.
I mean,

397
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,244
I,
I actually,

398
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,163
you know,
I came from the editorial world where 

399
00:15:15,171 --> 00:15:16,360
you have to get clear.
I mean we were getting,

400
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,030
our expectations were way higher.
And um,

401
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,210
did you have those kind of requirements?
No,

402
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,041
no,
not literally.

403
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:24,850
I know some sites do,
but both sides have all your quota,

404
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,823
a quota or like you get bonuses if you 
get a certain amount of hits or 

405
00:15:27,681 --> 00:15:27,910
whatever.

406
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,750
And we didn't have that.
We were salaried or whatever,

407
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,613
but you would be fired ultimately if you
weren't writing things that people were 

408
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:34,574
reading.
But I tried to stay out of my way for 

409
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,453
writing inflammatory things.
Actually there are a couple of examples 

410
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,783
where I wouldn't write a story because I
felt like it wasn't pertinent to any 

411
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,404
information and it was specifically to 
assassinate someone's character when we 

412
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,610
found a problem.
Here you have fucking morals,

413
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:51,560
dude.
Where's the door?

414
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,130
Like no room in this business.
I had a,

415
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:55,993
I had a high,
a high profile woman in the gaming 

416
00:15:57,681 --> 00:15:58,514
industry.
Tell me in an interview that was 

417
00:15:59,421 --> 00:16:00,254
unrelated to what I was actually 
interviewing her that she'd never was 

418
00:16:03,681 --> 00:16:05,960
once the victim of sexism in the 
industry ever.

419
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,550
And that was,
and I was like,

420
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,390
I could write this,
but this isn't why I was there to,

421
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,080
you know,
I wasn't interviewing her about this and

422
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:14,240
this is going to cause her problems and 
that's not who I am.

423
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,280
I don't.
I caused her problem because then people

424
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:17,114
are going to.
Then people are gonna jump on and be 

425
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:18,590
like,
well,

426
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,460
you know,
I experienced this,

427
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,353
I experienced this and you're 
diminishing and we'll just cause her 

428
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:21,741
drama.
I'm like,

429
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:23,220
why would I do that?
It's not.

430
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,040
See,
this is where it drives me crazy.

431
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:28,910
That's a beautiful example of people 
being cool if she can say,

432
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,250
Hey,
I've never experienced any sexism in his

433
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,480
business.
You'd be like,

434
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:33,314
wow,
the gaming industry must be really cool 

435
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,193
and this woman has managed to get 
through the maze with a bunch of high 

436
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:41,660
fives and people appreciating her work.
Wouldn't that be celebrated?

437
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:45,140
Not In the gaming and you know what I'm 
saying?

438
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:45,974
Like why does that have to be in some 
ways a target like why is that story at 

439
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:51,734
target?
Like wouldn't you assume that if there 

440
00:16:53,871 --> 00:16:54,704
is a person who can reach a high level 
of prominence in this very complicated 

441
00:16:58,911 --> 00:16:59,690
business,
right.

442
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,330
I mean the gaming industry is incredibly
complicated,

443
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,373
especially how weighted everything is 
when it comes to male versus female 

444
00:17:05,721 --> 00:17:06,554
stuff.
That whole Gamergate shit exposed so 

445
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:08,954
much of that,
which was really confusing to people in 

446
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,530
the outside.
Especially people like me who don't play

447
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,364
games.
Right.

448
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,260
I was like,
what in the fucking shooting these gamer

449
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:16,990
people.
Yeah.

450
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:18,800
It's confusing to me too.
I mean the,

451
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:21,320
the second story,
I think it was more pertinent though,

452
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:24,650
which was this guy had this guy worked 
at a big publisher.

453
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,813
He was and he was laid off and he had 
like this huge meltdown on social media 

454
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:32,990
and people were writing about it and I 
was like,

455
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,710
I knew him personally and not wasn't 
really friendly with them at the time,

456
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,150
but I knew him personally and I was 
like,

457
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,650
and reverence that we should write about
this,

458
00:17:39,651 --> 00:17:41,210
and I'm like,
what is this?

459
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,380
What is the serving?
Like,

460
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:43,790
what was the meltdown?
He just,

461
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,624
he just had,
he was just going off about how he was 

462
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:48,740
just angry and sad.
He's a young kid that finally got in and

463
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,070
then he his grip on

464
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,020
the,
on the job and was and was laid off,

465
00:17:52,021 --> 00:17:52,854
whatever,
and he's fine now he's back in the 

466
00:17:53,341 --> 00:17:54,720
industry,
but the.

467
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,880
I was like,
I think I wasn't cut out to be like this

468
00:17:56,881 --> 00:17:57,714
hard core,
like don't get them journalism like at 

469
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,130
any cost because I was like,
this is going to ruin this.

470
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,810
Like why would I want to contribute to 
this,

471
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,723
to this,
to this.

472
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,843
I didn't get into this industry to,
to the pile on people to ruin their 

473
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:08,904
lives.
I got into this industry to celebrate 

474
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:12,420
video games,
to tell interesting stories about games,

475
00:18:12,421 --> 00:18:13,254
to challenge people's minds and I always
tried to take that with me where I was 

476
00:18:16,471 --> 00:18:17,304
like,
I'm not going to write anything for the 

477
00:18:18,001 --> 00:18:19,110
clicks I could.
I could,

478
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,480
I could write.
These ladies had salacious headlines,

479
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,220
a I can write this,
this,

480
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,290
this dirt or this,
this stuff.

481
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,580
I heard whatever,
but that's not who I am.

482
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:27,414
That's not who I want to be,
and I'd rather contribute more 

483
00:18:29,011 --> 00:18:31,380
positively to,
to the ecosystem.

484
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,610
Then then be like,
well,

485
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,444
I'll just get clicks for this today and 
this guy has got to read the story and 

486
00:18:35,071 --> 00:18:37,580
it's going to be in Google and Lexis 
nexis forever and it's going to,

487
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:39,263
for what?
So I can get 50,000 clicks one day and 

488
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,210
then just move on.
He's not gonna be able to move on.

489
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,860
He didn't even do anything that is 
worthy of being writing about.

490
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,773
We writing about this.
Why are we always after people while 

491
00:18:48,241 --> 00:18:50,070
you're mindset is noble?
I mean,

492
00:18:50,071 --> 00:18:52,460
it is a great way to look at things.
It's,

493
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:54,870
it's weird that it's so unusual,
you know,

494
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:55,723
and that most people would be more self 
serving and would choose the path going 

495
00:18:59,031 --> 00:19:02,220
to get them the most clicks and hey,
I've got a fucking crack,

496
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,240
a few eggs to make an omelet.

497
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,350
That's how it goes.
Yeah.

498
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,200
And that's not because I don't want,
I never wanted the Canon to be turned on

499
00:19:07,201 --> 00:19:09,000
me even though it was eventually.
You don't know what I mean.

500
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,960
The cat hates like the try to put out 
that energy that you want,

501
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,063
that's,
that's positive or at least 

502
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,953
constructive.
If someone like murder someone in the 

503
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:17,941
gaming industry.
Yes.

504
00:19:17,941 --> 00:19:18,774
That's noteworthy.
We should probably write about that if 

505
00:19:19,891 --> 00:19:21,510
someone just depends on who they're 
murdered.

506
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:22,910
Right.
Well,

507
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,370
what do you mean when someone's a 
terrible person that murdered them?

508
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,000
Like punisher style?
Well,

509
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:28,320
that's different.
I guess we can.

510
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,080
We can have that conversation I guess.
Yeah,

511
00:19:31,081 --> 00:19:31,861
no,
I know what you're saying,

512
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:32,970
man.
I agree with you.

513
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,110
It's,
it's again,

514
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:36,060
it's knowable.
What would your mindset,

515
00:19:36,061 --> 00:19:36,894
your philosophy is very noble and I wish
more people shared it and I think that 

516
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,093
when there's all these people scrambling
around like we're seeing now and you 

517
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,720
know,
trying to find their niche and trying to

518
00:19:45,721 --> 00:19:50,721
get attention and you find more of that 
kind of a predatory behavior.

519
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,490
Yeah,
I agree as well.

520
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:54,324
That brings me back to what we were 
saying specifically about we feel bad 

521
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:57,834
for these writers at these sites and to 
me like the analogy I draw is like I 

522
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,530
hate the Tsa,
right?

523
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,633
There's normal people that work for the 
TSA that are just trying to do their 

524
00:20:04,471 --> 00:20:05,304
thing,
but that doesn't mean I don't hate the 

525
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,374
system that they work under and think 
the system should change and it's the 

526
00:20:09,811 --> 00:20:10,710
same thing here.
It's like these.

527
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:11,544
Yeah,
these guys are victimized by the set of 

528
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,280
circumstances in which they under which 
they have to write,

529
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:17,220
but that doesn't mean that the system 
should remain the same because they need

530
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,054
to write those stories.
Talk about the TSA because I don't know 

531
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,830
more about that than I know about 
business or about your business rather.

532
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,611
Sure.
Like what,

533
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:24,444
what do you hate about the Tsa?
They're infringing on your fourth 

534
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:26,814
amendment rights.
The warrantless searches a day legally 

535
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:30,181
sees things.
I mean,

536
00:20:30,181 --> 00:20:31,890
this is written very clearly in the bill
of rights.

537
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,310
So,
and I hate the whole argument of like,

538
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:34,710
well,
you,

539
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,490
you don't have,
you know,

540
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,323
are you,
you,

541
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,293
um,
you kind of pass by your rights or give 

542
00:20:39,241 --> 00:20:40,290
them up when you're in the airport.
And I'm like,

543
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,130
no,
they're,

544
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,380
they're inalienable actually.
So I just have a huge problem.

545
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:46,020
I don't have a problem going through a 
metal detector or something reasonable.

546
00:20:46,021 --> 00:20:48,090
A reasonable search.
Yeah.

547
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,773
Well it's,
it's kind of reasonable because there 

548
00:20:51,461 --> 00:20:52,294
are carbon fiber blades and all these 
different plastic blades that they can 

549
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:59,080
make now that you could really fuck 
somebody up that are,

550
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:01,630
I'm not going to show up in a metal 
detector.

551
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:04,930
Sure.
But it goes back to the first of all,

552
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,853
you know,
I don't think that we're going to have 

553
00:21:07,571 --> 00:21:09,530
many problems on airplanes anymore.
I think that they're moving,

554
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,580
moving onto something else and no plane 
is going to get hijacked.

555
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,380
And now that everyone knows what's going
to happen.

556
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:15,960
But Dude,
as soon as you think like that,

557
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,010
that's when something happens.
That's,

558
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,190
that can be,
that can be a relevant argument.

559
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,800
I also wanna give a shout out that 
serious things happen.

560
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,560
My Dad's in New York,
a retired New York City firefighter.

561
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,960
So it's,
it's quit.

562
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:27,940
Very cool.
I knew people that died that day,

563
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,620
but it's still,
you know,

564
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,080
and my dad could have died that day 
depending on the circumstances.

565
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,130
Thank God he didn't.
But to me it was like I just would.

566
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:36,964
Right.
It's like the old Benjamin Franklin 

567
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:37,940
thing,
you know,

568
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,310
it's balancing,
uh,

569
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,151
your,
your liberty,

570
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:42,340
your freedom with security.
And I think that we've,

571
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,174
we've,
we've given them so much power with 

572
00:21:44,411 --> 00:21:45,430
Patriot Act,
with the Tsa,

573
00:21:45,431 --> 00:21:47,670
with all these things where I'm like,
this is a bad road to go to,

574
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,270
to go down and they're just going to 
take more and more.

575
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:51,040
So yeah.
What is the Benjamin Franklin quote?

576
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,590
He who value safety over.
Yeah,

577
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,810
over over liberty deserves neither 
safety nor liberty.

578
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,713
Yeah.
I think the TSA has a ridiculously hard 

579
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:03,310
job.
And I think the requirements that people

580
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:04,910
have,
the what,

581
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,760
what people request of them to make sure
that they're safe and then you give them

582
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,650
$10 an hour or whatever the fuck they 
make,

583
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:12,543
they don't make much.
Of course you get is a bunch of 

584
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,103
underqualified people who are tired and 
they're tired of working like the 

585
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,390
constant flow.

586
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,223
If you watch how I like to study people 
at the airport because I feel like it's 

587
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:29,950
one of the rare times where you could 
just stare at people while they're doing

588
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:33,910
their job and no one gets weird with you
because everybody staring at that guy or

589
00:22:33,911 --> 00:22:37,870
that girl that's taking your license and
scanning your ticket and all that jazz.

590
00:22:37,871 --> 00:22:40,000
So I just stare at him and I watch how 
they,

591
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:43,120
how they interact with all these people 
and people are fucking tired.

592
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,170
That's what I see.
I see.

593
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,063
I see frustration.
I see so many people in these lines and 

594
00:22:48,161 --> 00:22:48,994
I see people just being exhausted.
And then the people that have to deal 

595
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:52,780
with the people that don't take their 
shoes off.

596
00:22:52,781 --> 00:22:53,730
Sorry,
you have to take your shoes out.

597
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,410
Why would I take my shoes off?
Take your fucking shoes off man.

598
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,400
You see that kind of thinking,
right?

599
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,290
It just there on the edge all the time.
So you're not dealing with them.

600
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,700
We'll start taking shoes off because 
it's going through this thing.

601
00:23:03,701 --> 00:23:06,130
It's not like he has one guy's dealing 
with short whole day.

602
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:09,520
He's dealing with this constant river of
human beings that are coming through and

603
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,563
some of them have water bottles and you 
got to make sure those dangerous water 

604
00:23:12,611 --> 00:23:13,444
bottles don't get on the plane.
There's a lot of stupid shit that goes 

605
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,104
with the TSA,
but how the fuck else are you going to 

606
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:23,560
keep people from bringing shoe bombs or 
knives on planes and it's really hard to

607
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:24,371
do.
No,

608
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:25,450
it is I,
I mean I don't,

609
00:23:25,451 --> 00:23:26,890
I don't think that the,
the,

610
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,753
the,
the counterpoint would be to just get 

611
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,034
rid of it.
You just walk into a terminal and be 

612
00:23:31,091 --> 00:23:32,500
able to get on an airplane.
But I remember,

613
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,480
you know,
remember too,

614
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,323
and a lot of people do.

615
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:37,690
We had a security apparatus before nine,
11.

616
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,350
These guys out smarter this security 
apparatus by doing very specific things,

617
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,303
including like knowing how to fly planes
and doing all the things that you can't 

618
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:45,184
possibly check for and also people get 
guns and knives and weapons 

619
00:23:48,351 --> 00:23:49,184
intentionally through the,
through the Tsa all the time to I think 

620
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,273
wasn't it something like over 90 percent
of agents that we're trying to get 

621
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,730
through things through the TSA 
succeeded.

622
00:23:55,731 --> 00:23:57,710
So these are,
these are the people standing in between

623
00:23:57,711 --> 00:24:01,310
us and isis.
People do it accidentally all the time.

624
00:24:01,311 --> 00:24:03,440
They have stuff in their bag and it gets
through and then they go,

625
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,000
what the fuck?
You know?

626
00:24:05,001 --> 00:24:06,530
I mean it happens all the time.
Yeah.

627
00:24:06,531 --> 00:24:07,364
I knew a guy that,
that brought a ton of weed overseas on 

628
00:24:09,651 --> 00:24:10,890
accident,
you know,

629
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:14,720
like that's terrifying.
Like here's a shit like me too.

630
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,553
Like I go through my bed just for 
anything you might leave in there and 

631
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:17,370
your,
the expert.

632
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,880
I always come through just make sure 
there's nothing,

633
00:24:18,881 --> 00:24:20,000
you know,
you never know what's going to happen,

634
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,830
but to the point he didn't mean to do 
that.

635
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,630
Right.
But it was there,

636
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,710
it was.
So yeah.

637
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,553
It's,
it's not a perfect system and it's not 

638
00:24:29,001 --> 00:24:30,860
going to be,
and that's just the way it is.

639
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,930
It would be nice if it was more 
efficient.

640
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:34,640
It would be nice that people got paid 
better.

641
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:36,410
It'd be nice if it was easier and 
quicker.

642
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,210
There'd be a lot of.
It would be nice,

643
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,343
but I don't know of anybody that's come 
up with a better system for scanning 

644
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:45,470
people and making sure that they don't 
bring guns or bombs or whatever the fuck

645
00:24:45,471 --> 00:24:48,140
it is on an airplane.
It's just bizarre that airplanes are the

646
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:48,974
one place where we have so much fucking 
security were malls which are filled 

647
00:24:52,461 --> 00:24:54,350
with way more people than your average 
plane.

648
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,790
There's something about terror and 
flying where it's already terrifying,

649
00:24:58,791 --> 00:24:59,151
like,
yeah,

650
00:24:59,151 --> 00:25:00,320
you think you're scared now,
bitch,

651
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:01,154
what if it blows up in the fucking guy?
Dude pulls a fucking turbine out of his 

652
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,640
bag and wraps around his head and starts
lightened his underwear on fire.

653
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,503
You know?
That's.

654
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,060
That's what we're scared of.
We're scared of someone taking it to the

655
00:25:11,061 --> 00:25:12,740
next level because people are already 
tensed.

656
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:13,623
Yeah,
because you're in a metal tube hurling 

657
00:25:14,421 --> 00:25:18,650
through the sky at 500 miles an hour.
If it blows up while you're doing that,

658
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:20,030
it's even more freaky.
Oh my God.

659
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:21,410
It's horrifying.
Let me a weird.

660
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,470
It's terrifying,
but it's kind of strange.

661
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,633
Whereas like that seems to be like the 
preferred method of terror like that 

662
00:25:30,021 --> 00:25:33,830
we're really worried about which is why 
the TSA exist in the first place because

663
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,850
the volume of humans that go through a 
lot of places,

664
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:38,684
it's probably commensurate with the 
volume of humans that go through the 

665
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:40,870
airport.

666
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,703
Oh sure.
You don't have a single place that you 

667
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:47,861
could mention that's as strict with what
you carry around as the airport.

668
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,920
You could walk into the fucking mall 
with a loaded gun any day of the week,

669
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,520
any day of the week.
Every single time I walk on the mall,

670
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,770
I am just never checked.
Nobody.

671
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,230
Nobody frisks me.
I don't go there.

672
00:26:00,231 --> 00:26:01,064
Any metal detectors.
You could walk in arm to the fucking 

673
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,620
teeth and that.
Who's going to stop you?

674
00:26:05,621 --> 00:26:07,880
The mall security guard.
The Fuck Outta here and his little.

675
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:08,783
His little sub during Christmas time,
there are thousands of people at the 

676
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:13,130
mall.
Thousands,

677
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,540
thousands and thousands.
Yeah,

678
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:15,450
I agree.
I mean that's,

679
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,750
it's like it's more like the Israeli 
experience where I like this.

680
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,630
This kind of shit can happen at any time
anywhere and they're very vigilant about

681
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:21,860
that.
I've often wondered that as well,

682
00:26:21,861 --> 00:26:24,290
like why doesn't even at a security 
checkpoint in a,

683
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,230
in an airport,
why not just do what they're like?

684
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,730
And I really think it's that they,
you know,

685
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,913
to your point with the mall and all 
these kinds of things in the public 

686
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:33,704
places,
I think it just speaks to the fact that 

687
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,470
most people,
a vast majority people are just good,

688
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:38,510
decent people that want to go about 
their lives for sure.

689
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,760
And that these terrorists could target 
all of these different places.

690
00:26:40,761 --> 00:26:42,560
I don't think they do.
Maybe because they can't,

691
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,980
but probably more because they don't 
want to

692
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,250
give themselves away for something that 
might be seen as minor.

693
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,830
Like,
like nine slash 11 was a spectacle.

694
00:26:49,831 --> 00:26:51,720
It wasn't only that 3000 some odd people
died.

695
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:52,554
It was that.
It was the spectacle of killing those 

696
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:57,420
people in that way and so I think that 
there's something about that as well,

697
00:26:57,421 --> 00:26:58,254
which is why I'm more scared about like 
a dirty bomb or something like that 

698
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:01,494
today than I am of anyone taking an 
airplane over because everyone knows 

699
00:27:03,301 --> 00:27:04,134
what happened in 2001.
So now someone pulls out a knife on an 

700
00:27:05,851 --> 00:27:06,684
airplane and try.
Someone's just going to tackle that guy 

701
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,850
and probably kill him.
That's why I'm not sure.

702
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:11,671
That's why the guy.
Yeah,

703
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,860
I know the guy tried to blow his shoe up
or something like that on the plane.

704
00:27:13,861 --> 00:27:15,480
That's why we have to take our shoes off
now.

705
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,070
But uh,
yeah.

706
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:18,360
To me I'm like the,
the,

707
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,203
the,
the threat has changed that the threat 

708
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:23,040
is evolving and we can be vigilant in 
all these ways,

709
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:23,874
but then I wonder it's,
it goes back to like Nsa and all these 

710
00:27:25,171 --> 00:27:26,004
things like how much are we going to 
give the government and how much are we 

711
00:27:27,361 --> 00:27:28,650
going to give up in order for safety?

712
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,280
I'd rather live in a more dangerous 
world first,

713
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,133
personally,
and know that no one's reading my text 

714
00:27:32,521 --> 00:27:37,500
messages or no one's throwing out my 
hand lotion or harassing.

715
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,150
I saw these,
these two women,

716
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:42,810
Australian women in the airport at Sfo.
When I came down to La last week,

717
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,153
they were in wheelchairs.
They were going through all of their 

718
00:27:46,321 --> 00:27:47,400
stuff and like.
And I'm like,

719
00:27:47,401 --> 00:27:49,630
what the fuck are you doing to these 
people?

720
00:27:49,631 --> 00:27:52,080
I just leave them alone and I actually 
went up to them afterwards and I'm like,

721
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:53,520
I'm sorry.
We hate these people too.

722
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:54,354
Just so you know.
So this is not okay with any of us that 

723
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,253
were there.
They were there for like a half an hour 

724
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,790
ago.
They had these frowns on their faces.

725
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,793
They looked dejected.
This might be their first time in the 

726
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:04,860
states for all I know or predict map.
Here's what happens.

727
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,720
You come over here,
check your shit,

728
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:08,280
take your pants off.
When he got in there,

729
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,540
it's like,
what are you packing?

730
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,920
The harassing old women?
They're harassing,

731
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,720
harassing.
I,

732
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,553
I think I saw in jfk once,
like going through like a nun's bang or 

733
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:16,270
something like,
what?

734
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,090
This is madness to me,
I'm like,

735
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:20,340
this is not everyone's turning on each 
other,

736
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:21,203
but it's not because if it wasn't,
if they didn't go through everyone 

737
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,240
thoroughly and they,
oh,

738
00:28:24,241 --> 00:28:26,500
we're going to let nuns go through.
And then what happened?

739
00:28:26,501 --> 00:28:30,970
Somebody dressed as a nun and they act 
as a terrorist or they are a terrorist.

740
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,070
I liked the,
uh,

741
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,933
someone that I don't know much about it,
you probably know more about it than I 

742
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:35,274
do,
but someone was telling me a little bit 

743
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:38,070
about the Israel,
the way the Israelis do airport security

744
00:28:38,071 --> 00:28:39,290
specifically that it's,
they,

745
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,750
it's like all about,
uh,

746
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,150
it's,
they're not profiling,

747
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:42,984
but even based on race or anything,
they're profiling based on your 

748
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:44,910
behavior.

749
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:45,743
And it goes to your point like these are
well paid professional people that know 

750
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,374
what the fuck they're doing,
know what they're looking for and 

751
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:51,414
they're in the airport and they see 
someone just acting a little weird and 

752
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:55,140
they also do some crazy shit.
Like,

753
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:58,290
I had a friend who went there and she 
took photos of um,

754
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,820
some,
uh,

755
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:04,560
antisemetic a pictures,
some like Nazi swastikas on something.

756
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,573
So,
you know what the Israeli guys did at 

757
00:29:06,271 --> 00:29:07,104
the airport.
They shot her computer and they gave it 

758
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:09,414
back.
Really?

759
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,410
Yes.
She's.

760
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,450
Yeah.
So there's,

761
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,030
that's a little over the top.
Yeah.

762
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,850
So there's that a little more balanced 
than that.

763
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,190
Can we see you a computer.
And they opened up her computer.

764
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,800
Terrible Israeli accent.
Not even know where to go with it there.

765
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,013
I just put a fucking hoe she heard dunk 
dunk and they gave her back her fucking 

766
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:28,770
computer.
That's a half hour later.

767
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,490
That's,
that's some,

768
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,180
that's a little too strong for me.
But uh,

769
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,860
to your point,
to the point like,

770
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:34,703
I don't know what this is,
I just don't like the security theater 

771
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:36,960
aspect of it.
We all know what's going on.

772
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:39,000
Everyone's being inconvenienced.
These people are miserable.

773
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,680
We're miserable.
It's just,

774
00:29:40,681 --> 00:29:42,100
it goes back down to no one wants to 
make

775
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,930
hard decisions or I'll even do what,
like really hard work.

776
00:29:43,931 --> 00:29:44,860
Like what works,
what doesn't,

777
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,270
let's do studies.
Let's figure out what,

778
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:47,143
what we're doing instead of looking at 
people naked and machines and will you 

779
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:50,860
also have to take the,
well,

780
00:29:50,861 --> 00:29:52,750
you don't really see anyone naked 
machines anymore.

781
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,820
That's not real.
I know,

782
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:54,723
but back in the day,
but even back in the day it was just 

783
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:56,830
like,
come on man.

784
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,070
What are you worried about?
What people are so silly?

785
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,800
Worried about people seeing me naked.
But the,

786
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,673
the,
the um,

787
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,560
the thing that gets to me though is 
like,

788
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,453
how can you make it safer?
No one has offered up any sort of an 

789
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,590
alternative to the TSA that makes any 
sense to me.

790
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:12,853
I mean,
I've heard people say the Tsh and 

791
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,490
competent,
I fucking hate them.

792
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,220
They no violation of fourth amendment,
but there's no,

793
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,940
there's no alternatives that I've seen 
that they're even remotely responsible.

794
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,161
No,
I mean I,

795
00:30:23,161 --> 00:30:23,994
I think it goes back to me of like,
I can't speak necessarily to the level 

796
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:28,600
of competence because I'm not 
insecurity.

797
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:29,920
I don't know.
Like what specifically do.

798
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:31,210
I don't know what their level of 
training is.

799
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:33,160
It just goes back to the 
constitutionality of it.

800
00:30:33,161 --> 00:30:34,480
Like if we,
if we,

801
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,600
and it brings up those tough questions,
it's the same way I feel about about the

802
00:30:37,601 --> 00:30:38,434
second amendment.
If we start seeding what this means in 

803
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:42,460
certain situations,
then before you know it,

804
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,200
they'll just continue to erode it away.
Like,

805
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,810
and um,
so when I'm like,

806
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:47,883
this is a warrantless search,
this is by definition a warrantless 

807
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:50,854
search.
If you went and got John Jay and James 

808
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:53,643
Madison and all these guys and ask the 
and somehow told them what the fuck was 

809
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:56,434
going on.
And then instead like what does this 

810
00:30:57,581 --> 00:30:58,320
look like this.

811
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,280
But you would have to go and get them 
and then go,

812
00:31:00,281 --> 00:31:03,250
okay,
this is isis and this is the internet.

813
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,113
And then this was twitter and this is a,
this is how they send information 

814
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:09,660
through pictures with Metadata,
you know,

815
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,550
it's encoded in the picture and you have
to break it down.

816
00:31:12,551 --> 00:31:13,940
And that's where the message is.
Like,

817
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:15,550
they'd be like,
oh yeah,

818
00:31:15,551 --> 00:31:18,500
search everybody that be my God.
You live in a terrible place to be.

819
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,890
I got to go to bed and really processed 
this.

820
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:22,090
Like back in the day when we only had 
muskets,

821
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:22,924
it was so awesome.
I don't know if my argument makes sense 

822
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:25,810
to you but it,
but to me it's,

823
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,693
I just feel like these are certain 
sacred rights that need to be protected 

824
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:29,014
in any way they can.
And if we want to have a conversation 

825
00:31:30,461 --> 00:31:31,294
about like,
why we should see this right in this 

826
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:33,034
specific way,
then you have to do it a little more 

827
00:31:33,671 --> 00:31:34,480
clearly.

828
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,800
And to me I,
I just,

829
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,810
I think people take some of these things
for granted that,

830
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,700
you know,
what's stopping them from,

831
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,250
you know,
if,

832
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,060
if these rights continue to erode,
then what stops them from busing in your

833
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:44,170
house at some point and be like,
well,

834
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,240
we all,
they can do that.

835
00:31:46,241 --> 00:31:47,074
And there,
there are some search and seizure 

836
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:49,624
methods that they're,
they're really being criticized for 

837
00:31:51,731 --> 00:31:53,850
lately in particular for these,
uh,

838
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,470
for drug offenses where they just don't 
even knock.

839
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:57,304
They just break open people's doors and 
wind up shooting their dogs all the 

840
00:32:00,461 --> 00:32:02,410
time.
Shoot people all the time.

841
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:06,730
I mean there was an article written 
recently about the amount of people that

842
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:07,564
are wounded in unnecessary,
like how do they describe that kind of 

843
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:15,310
altercation between the cops?
No knock,

844
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,390
no search lists.
Warrant or what is the.

845
00:32:18,510 --> 00:32:22,630
I think they just call it no knock break
ins or something like that.

846
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:23,950
I don't.
I don't know how to describe it,

847
00:32:23,951 --> 00:32:28,720
but if you've seen the way the dea 
treats any sort of situation,

848
00:32:28,721 --> 00:32:31,480
even when they just have marijuana,
they'll kick down the door.

849
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:33,920
If they see a dog,
they shoot it and then they,

850
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,754
they,
they make people huddled up in the 

851
00:32:35,831 --> 00:32:39,010
corner after they just murdered your 
family pet and oftentimes they find like

852
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:39,883
a pipe.

853
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,260
You know what I mean?
There's many people that had been called

854
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,433
a on like someone has turned them in or 
someone has a said something about them 

855
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:48,950
and it turned out to not be true.
Like,

856
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:49,784
Hey,
these people have a grow up and their 

857
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:54,890
business or in their house rather,
and one of them was a former FBI,

858
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,210
a couple that both worked in the FBI.
They kicked in their fucking door,

859
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,620
held them at gunpoint,
the whole deal.

860
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:03,410
Went to the basement.
They were growing tomatoes and they were

861
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:04,490
like,
what in the fuck?

862
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:05,324
These are retired FBI officers and the 
dea broke down their door and pointed a 

863
00:33:09,861 --> 00:33:13,730
loaded gun in their face and then found 
plants.

864
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:14,880
Yeah,
you can eat that.

865
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,860
You can eat,
you can eat.

866
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:18,260
We do as they can.
It's actually not bad for you.

867
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,413
I,
uh,

868
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:20,150
I,
I,

869
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,100
so these things are happening actually.

870
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,240
That one thing sounds familiar with the 
family pet being killed.

871
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:24,860
I think I saw a video on that.
A lot of it.

872
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,270
It's not just one thing,
men,

873
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:29,810
one of them was a mayor and um,
God dammit.

874
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,670
Was it Washington?
Where was it?

875
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,470
Where was it?
There was a mayor who the.

876
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:38,450
It turned out that the post office,
someone in the post office was running a

877
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:39,284
scam.
And what they were doing was they were 

878
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:41,894
having,
we'd sent to other people's addresses 

879
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,853
and they were sending it through the 
post office and the postman would 

880
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,280
intercept the package because he was the
guy who delivered that out of drugs.

881
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,323
So he would get that package and somehow
or another it got intercepted before it 

882
00:33:58,011 --> 00:33:58,844
got to the post man and then they had a 
dummy post man come and bring it and 

883
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,590
then do the whole break down the door.

884
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,270
Shoot the dog thing.
They chased the dog,

885
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:07,430
a golden lab,
chased them out in the yard.

886
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,353
The dog ran and it was running and 
hiding and they shot him in front of 

887
00:34:11,211 --> 00:34:12,044
everybody.
It turned out that the guy who was the 

888
00:34:14,571 --> 00:34:17,630
victim of this and his family who were 
held at gunpoint and zip tied,

889
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,420
it was a mayor and so you know,
he was like,

890
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:22,820
what in the fuck are you people doing?
Like,

891
00:34:22,821 --> 00:34:23,654
what is this?
You just killed my dog in front of my 

892
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:27,350
kids.
You traumatized my family.

893
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,130
Yeah,
it's awful.

894
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:30,830
But you're making the argument in my 
opinion of why we have to take a stand,

895
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,580
you know,
like why we have to say like in this,

896
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,220
in that situation,
yes,

897
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,630
but just not tsa though.
No,

898
00:34:36,631 --> 00:34:37,464
but it's.
But it is a fourth amendment issue that 

899
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:39,770
we would that or allow them to be 
eroding.

900
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:40,603
No one should be allowed to go into 
anyone's home without a warrant no 

901
00:34:42,171 --> 00:34:43,004
matter what,
but don't you think that you sort of 

902
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:45,494
imply at least a certain amount of 
consent when you get in that line and 

903
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:49,660
give them your bag and say,
here,

904
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,503
search this,
like no one's telling you that you have 

905
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:52,964
to do that.
You could choose to fly with no baggage 

906
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,384
at all.
You could choose if you want to send 

907
00:34:58,311 --> 00:34:59,144
your stuff through the mail and it would
probably cost the same amount as it 

908
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:04,540
would to pay that 50 bucks or whatever 
it is with southwest.

909
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,220
If you wanted to send your package 
through the mail,

910
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:10,190
you could do it that way and just walk 
through with nothing on you.

911
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,420
Sure you could do that.
Yeah,

912
00:35:11,421 --> 00:35:12,860
and you would still have to go through 
the machines and all that.

913
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:13,694
I don't.
I don't dispute that because I agree 

914
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:16,340
with you in the pre nine slash 11 world.

915
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,253
I'm going through the metal detector.
Having your bags and you're looking at 

916
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:20,870
it through the machine.
I think that that's all reasonable.

917
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:22,490
I just don't like the people being 
pulled aside.

918
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:23,324
Pulled in the rooms,
people just going through the kind of 

919
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,010
very disrespectfully going through shit 
and I don't know how to connect to me.

920
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:28,380
I have,
I,

921
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,980
I just.
Is that,

922
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,490
is that a hill worth dying on?
In a way?

923
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:33,980
It is because I feel like it could just 
as you made the point,

924
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:37,860
it's already see that mentality now 
seeps into of different places.

925
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,060
Right?
And I just don't want to see what the.

926
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:40,290
I don't want to see the end result of 
that.

927
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,450
You know,
that mentality is also the justification

928
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:44,490
for the NSA.
Being able to look at your text messages

929
00:35:44,491 --> 00:35:48,060
or being able to look at your emails and
that's the big thing that was exposed by

930
00:35:48,061 --> 00:35:48,840
Edward Snowden.

931
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,810
That really pissed me off that so many 
people are so flippant about.

932
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,321
They were like,
Hey,

933
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:54,120
if you're not doing anything wrong,
don't worry about it.

934
00:35:54,121 --> 00:35:54,954
Like that is wrong.
You can't say that because you can't 

935
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:01,560
look at everyone.
You can't just randomly look at everyone

936
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:02,394
and look at their private information.
You just can't do that because the 

937
00:36:04,951 --> 00:36:07,110
people that are looking at that are just
people.

938
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,063
And that's the problem with the TSA.
It's not even necessarily the issue 

939
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:15,180
being that you get to search people 
stuff to make sure there's no terrorists

940
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:16,940
and no people bringing weapons on a 
planet.

941
00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:20,040
It's who gets to do that.
Who are these people?

942
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,940
Are these people experts or these 
people's security experts?

943
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,520
Are they,
are they work for the massage?

944
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,341
You know,
are they,

945
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:29,020
uh,
are they CIA agents or they FBI?

946
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,380
Are they,
who's looking?

947
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,310
Who these people are they competent?

948
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,320
Why are they doing when you go to the 
airport,

949
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:35,154
man,
you see what you see is a bunch of 

950
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,860
people.
And I used to joke about this,

951
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:43,190
that I think that phrase,
this making sound less insulting than it

952
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,743
used to be the old joke.
But the idea was that I think that the 

953
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:51,180
people that work at Burger King at the 
airport and the TSA,

954
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:53,790
they're the same people and they just 
reach into a hat today.

955
00:36:53,791 --> 00:36:55,050
I got fries.
Oh Shit,

956
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:58,680
I'm on duty.
It's literally almost like that.

957
00:36:58,681 --> 00:36:59,514
It's like you see people that are just 
taking whatever job they can get ahold 

958
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,941
of,
you know,

959
00:37:02,941 --> 00:37:03,774
I feel for them.
I mean if someone comes along and you 

960
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,120
don't have a job and they say,
hey,

961
00:37:06,121 --> 00:37:07,980
the Tsa Siren,
15 bucks an hour.

962
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:08,814
Okay,
cool.

963
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,683
What I gotta do you gotta stand here and
make sure that people don't bring water 

964
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,270
bottles on a plane.

965
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,270
All right.
And then after like the 50th day,

966
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,104
if people bring them in,
take your fucking water bottle out of 

967
00:37:17,881 --> 00:37:18,970
the bag.
No,

968
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,850
you're doing.
Yeah.

969
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,390
My,
my frustration grows in that way,

970
00:37:21,391 --> 00:37:25,240
which is people that in 2017 seemed to 
have some because you and I,

971
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,700
I'm sure you do too.
I fly all the time.

972
00:37:26,701 --> 00:37:27,200
Right.
So you,

973
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,350
you see all types.
Right.

974
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:31,440
And it's like you always encountered the
guys like have you not flown in the last

975
00:37:31,441 --> 00:37:32,274
15 years ever to know that people try to
walk through the machines with their 

976
00:37:34,371 --> 00:37:36,080
shoes on their belt.
It's like what is the time?

977
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,940
And then the convenience get people that
don't push their bins through the,

978
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,953
you know,
down to the thing and just leave it 

979
00:37:40,981 --> 00:37:42,870
there for someone else to push through.
Like what is going on?

980
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:43,704
People are just couldn't.
There was this one guy was really kind 

981
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,184
of funny,
he was going through the metal detector 

982
00:37:48,931 --> 00:37:49,764
thing and he had a bottle of water in 
his bag and because he had a bottle of 

983
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,180
water in his bag there to check his bag.

984
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,500
And so,
um,

985
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:58,230
when he goes through,
they set your bag aside,

986
00:37:58,231 --> 00:37:59,064
you know,
your thing goes through line that hits 

987
00:37:59,671 --> 00:38:01,980
the scanner and they said they pull it 
back check.

988
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,130
So this guy was like checking his phone 
and look at the bag check.

989
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,410
I mean like 30 seconds had gone by and 
he goes,

990
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,750
I have a flight to catch,
excuse me,

991
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,580
excuse me,
I have a flight to catch.

992
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,860
And the woman who grabbed his back,
he said,

993
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,843
what are the odds?
You're at an airport and you got a 

994
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:18,930
flight to catch how crazy.
And she goes,

995
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:20,580
hey,
you got a water bottle in your bag,

996
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:21,620
dummy.
And she pulled in.

997
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,760
Everybody was laughing.
It was funny because the guy was being a

998
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,610
con and the girl just kind of called 
them out on it.

999
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:28,530
And the way she did it was very 
humorous.

1000
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,060
I got a good chuckle out of it.
Yeah,

1001
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:30,570
that's good.
I mean,

1002
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,403
yeah,
you see,

1003
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,333
I always try to show it to your point 
about showing some respect to the TSA 

1004
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:35,980
agents.
I have my confrontations

1005
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,530
with them somewhat.
Do you,

1006
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,250
what kind of conversations that you had?
Well,

1007
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:42,880
just in the sense that like just a a 
couple of weeks ago,

1008
00:38:42,881 --> 00:38:44,440
I guess it was when I came down to see 
Dave,

1009
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,990
I was with my girlfriend and they were 
going through.

1010
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,933
They were going through a bag.
They held my girlfriend's bag but they 

1011
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:52,900
were just holding it for like two point 
four minutes.

1012
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:54,010
We weren't in a rush,
but I'm like,

1013
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,500
the guy wasn't even acknowledging that.
Like,

1014
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,580
hey dude,
our stuff's here.

1015
00:38:57,581 --> 00:38:59,260
Like we're kind of just standing here 
waiting.

1016
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,590
And I'm like.
And I said to him like,

1017
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:03,460
are you enjoying your little bit of 
power right now?

1018
00:39:03,461 --> 00:39:04,310
Like,
I don't understand what,

1019
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,353
what you're doing this to us.
We said please and thank you were doing 

1020
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:09,340
like doing our stuff.
So just these little confrontations.

1021
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:11,090
I had a massive,
when I was in,

1022
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,093
when I was installing highschool because
9:11 happened when I was in twelfth 

1023
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:16,120
grade and I flew down to uh,
uh,

1024
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:16,931
in 2000,
two,

1025
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:18,700
early 2002,
I flew down to Virginia to see my sister

1026
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:21,820
who was teaching down there and um,
I,

1027
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,683
they were going through my stuff,
my bags and stuff like that and I had a 

1028
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:25,060
confrontation with the TSA.

1029
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,350
Were there,
some of them,

1030
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,600
one of them was like,
son,

1031
00:39:27,601 --> 00:39:29,170
do you know what happened or whatever,
you know.

1032
00:39:29,171 --> 00:39:29,711
And I'm like,
yeah,

1033
00:39:29,711 --> 00:39:30,850
I know what happened.
I'm from New York,

1034
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:33,460
I live in new,
heard of [inaudible] and my dad's in New

1035
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,091
York City.
Firefighter.

1036
00:39:34,091 --> 00:39:35,710
Yeah,
I understand what happened,

1037
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,813
you know,
and like to the point where like where 

1038
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,330
they called over,
like I was a 17 year old kid and they're

1039
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,313
to the point where they called over like
some cops and then they just let me go 

1040
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:44,770
whatever.
But I was like,

1041
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,570
at that point it was sold in me where 
I'm like,

1042
00:39:46,571 --> 00:39:49,510
why are you being so why are you 
disrespecting me?

1043
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:50,344
Like you're going through my stuff.
If I'm a little upset about that or I 

1044
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:52,684
have something to say about that,
like I understand you have to probably 

1045
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,210
deal with this all day,
but don't,

1046
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,620
don't because I'm a young kid.

1047
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,420
I don't know what happened because I'm a
young man.

1048
00:39:58,421 --> 00:39:59,980
I,
you had no idea what my experience was.

1049
00:39:59,981 --> 00:40:02,350
Were you at the funeral for a 
firefighter that you knew that died?

1050
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,120
You know,
I was so like,

1051
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,741
you know,
it's,

1052
00:40:04,741 --> 00:40:07,960
it's that kind of stuff always.
I think it's so to seed in me very early

1053
00:40:07,961 --> 00:40:08,794
with them.
Where am I?

1054
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,170
So I,
I acknowledged that part of it too,

1055
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,660
where it's like there is a little bit of
a chip on my shoulder with them.

1056
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,540
I'm sure that is.
I never have a confrontation with them.

1057
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:17,830
I'm always super friendly,
uh,

1058
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:19,810
go through say hi to people.
I just,

1059
00:40:19,811 --> 00:40:21,340
I just treated it as like,
just,

1060
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,610
this is what I'm doing now.
I don't say this is a big inconvenience.

1061
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:25,960
I just say,
this is what you have to do.

1062
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,823
This is what I'm doing now.
I do respect this idea that the fourth 

1063
00:40:30,371 --> 00:40:34,060
amendment is being violated,
but I do not see a better alternative.

1064
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:34,923
If I did,
I would think that what we should 

1065
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,920
definitely follow that protocol,
whatever the better alternative is.

1066
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,143
I just think whenever you have non 
skilled labor in those sorts of 

1067
00:40:43,661 --> 00:40:46,690
situations,
like the guy working the fries at Burger

1068
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,490
King or the guy who's,
you know,

1069
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,773
doing that thing at the Tsa,
you're going to get a wide variety of 

1070
00:40:52,181 --> 00:40:53,290
people that need a job.
Right?

1071
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:55,810
And some of them are just going to suck 
at protocol.

1072
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,570
They're going to suck at being polite.
They're gonna suck it.

1073
00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:59,763
Recognizing that this old.
I don't think they have any leeway 

1074
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:02,614
either.
If some old lady comes through in a 

1075
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:04,024
wheelchair,
I'm pretty sure you have to check her 

1076
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,570
just like you check everybody else and 
if you don't you'll probably get fired.

1077
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,160
They have cameras and watching them 
everywhere.

1078
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:12,310
So it's not their fault.
The organization itself,

1079
00:41:12,311 --> 00:41:13,144
the Tsa,
I mean there's a diffusion of 

1080
00:41:14,381 --> 00:41:16,990
responsibility when you're in one of the
people that's responsible,

1081
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,183
you're at the top and you make these,
these laws and then you pass them down 

1082
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,470
to the people that are supposed to 
enforce all these regulations that you,

1083
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,290
you know,
you've,

1084
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,220
you've written down.

1085
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,413
There's almost like this is a diffusion 
of responsibility from the people that 

1086
00:41:30,941 --> 00:41:32,800
have created those.
They don't have to enforce them.

1087
00:41:32,801 --> 00:41:33,980
They're not.
They're doing it so

1088
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,630
someone else,
it's someone else's job,

1089
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:36,464
the $10 an hour guy,
it's his job to go out there and do all 

1090
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:39,824
this stuff and so it's real easy for 
someone at the top who's not 

1091
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:43,874
experiencing the interaction,
the day to day interaction with these 

1092
00:41:45,981 --> 00:41:48,260
human beings to be callous about it or 
to make like hard,

1093
00:41:48,261 --> 00:41:49,190
fast rules like,
hey,

1094
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:50,390
if someone comes through in a 
wheelchair,

1095
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,010
there's no leeway,
let them go.

1096
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,173
But then again,
you have to think about it and their 

1097
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:57,050
point of view.
Like if someone was a terrorist and they

1098
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:58,020
did decide,
well,

1099
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:58,910
here's what we do.
I mean,

1100
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,773
they've been proven for a fact.
They've used children as suicide 

1101
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:05,630
bombers,
so why wouldn't you use an old lady?

1102
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,250
You know?
Why wouldn't you use an old man?

1103
00:42:07,251 --> 00:42:08,450
Why don't you use someone in a 
wheelchair?

1104
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:09,284
You certainly could.
So you have to follow the same protocol 

1105
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,134
with everybody.

1106
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,880
Everybody that goes through has to be 
scanned.

1107
00:42:13,881 --> 00:42:17,360
You can't let someone need not be 
scanned just because they're old.

1108
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,000
Like you've reached a certain amount of 
years on this planet.

1109
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:21,860
You wouldn't do anything fucking crazy 
would you,

1110
00:42:21,861 --> 00:42:22,910
bob,
you know?

1111
00:42:22,911 --> 00:42:23,780
No,
not me.

1112
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:24,450
You know,
you,

1113
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:24,920
you,
you,

1114
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,590
you can't think like that.
Because if you do think like that,

1115
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:30,860
that will be your vulnerability.
That will be the path in that someone is

1116
00:42:30,861 --> 00:42:32,960
looking to do something horrible will,
will take.

1117
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,110
I think that the.
I think the solution drove to bridge the

1118
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:36,944
gap in the way we feel about this and 
come to some sort of consensus what 

1119
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:40,154
might be in this conflict.
A little with my small government kind 

1120
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:43,550
of mentality,
but it's just to say like,

1121
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:44,883
to ask the kind of fundamental question,
why are these people being paid 10 or 

1122
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:47,534
$15 an hour back to the Israeli 
experience with these guys that are 

1123
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:50,054
professionals there.

1124
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,180
They take a lot of pride in their work.
They make maybe 80,000,

1125
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,120
$100,000 a year and they,
you know,

1126
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,760
not that they necessarily need to make 
that much money,

1127
00:42:55,761 --> 00:42:56,594
but people that are professional,
should we invest more money and making 

1128
00:42:58,221 --> 00:42:59,440
the smarter,
you know,

1129
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,283
it would be a substantial increase in 
our airline fees and other things I'm 

1130
00:43:03,531 --> 00:43:04,364
sure.
Sure.

1131
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:06,270
Maybe it wouldn't.
Maybe going,

1132
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:09,620
well we already pay a little bit of that
but with tickets,

1133
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,480
but I think homeland security might be 
able to.

1134
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:13,880
Maybe we stopped dropping bombs on a 
bunch of countries and take some of that

1135
00:43:13,881 --> 00:43:15,580
money and put it on and put it on,
you know,

1136
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:19,580
into that area.
What else you suggest no more drones.

1137
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:22,160
Fucking communists.
Who is this guy?

1138
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,630
Um,
yeah.

1139
00:43:23,631 --> 00:43:27,290
I mean,
the Israeli thing is interesting because

1140
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:28,183
Israel has a mandatory military service 
requirement that I am not in favor for 

1141
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,210
favor of,
but I am a part of me.

1142
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:39,780
I feel,
I feel the benefit of it like you've,

1143
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,220
it's very rare to meet people that are 
more patriotic than Israelis,

1144
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:44,870
you know,
people that are more,

1145
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:48,230
uh,
more committed to their country.

1146
00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:49,880
It's like a very,
I mean,

1147
00:43:49,881 --> 00:43:54,881
they feel very marginalized,
very targeted and rightly so.

1148
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,143
And so because of that,
like the people that I've met that work 

1149
00:43:58,101 --> 00:44:00,090
for the Israeli army or that have been,
uh,

1150
00:44:00,350 --> 00:44:01,183
soldiers over there,
they have this very intense sort of a 

1151
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,333
view of altercation and of the world.
And when you're forced to do two years 

1152
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:11,870
of military service mandatory like they 
are,

1153
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,010
you also have,
you're invested in this whole project of

1154
00:44:16,011 --> 00:44:17,240
Israel.
I mean there's no,

1155
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:18,103
there's no veterans and civilians.
Everyone's a fucking veteran and you 

1156
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:22,514
know,
when you deal with a country where it 

1157
00:44:23,111 --> 00:44:25,670
literally everyone does some military 
service.

1158
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,520
There's everybody's,
there's more chips in the game,

1159
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,980
you know,
people are all in different,

1160
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:32,100
different scenario.
Yeah.

1161
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:32,933
I think I went to school with this girl 
that was Israeli when I was at 

1162
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,933
northeastern and Boston and uh,
I remember very clearly she had this 

1163
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:39,903
very unassuming you would never know,
but she had this picture of her with an 

1164
00:44:42,271 --> 00:44:44,040
assault rifle shooting at a range.
And I'm like,

1165
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:45,480
this is so,
so interesting.

1166
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:46,314
It conflicts because I agree with you.
It's like one of those things where I'm 

1167
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:48,354
like,
I don't,

1168
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,313
I can see both sides of this where um,
I don't know that the state should have 

1169
00:44:51,961 --> 00:44:54,020
the right to exert that kind of power 
over a person,

1170
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,550
but at the same time does it have to be 
military service?

1171
00:44:56,551 --> 00:44:58,980
And when a person turns 18,
is it fair to say like,

1172
00:44:59,010 --> 00:44:59,843
just spend a couple of years and give 
something to your country and whether 

1173
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:03,760
it's you,
you,

1174
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,593
you work in a soup kitchen or something 
or you do something that is for the 

1175
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:10,860
society and really have some,
some investment in some skin in the game

1176
00:45:10,861 --> 00:45:13,710
in society.
I think that that's a nice idea,

1177
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,544
but I think that the way I feel about 
the state's exertion of power over the 

1178
00:45:16,141 --> 00:45:18,630
individual kind of overrides that,
but I like,

1179
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:21,630
I like the idea in principle,
like the idea of saying like,

1180
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:22,464
hey,
and it's also easy for me is a 32 year 

1181
00:45:23,521 --> 00:45:24,370
old.
That would be long,

1182
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:25,471
you know,
it'd be like,

1183
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:26,250
yeah,
you guys do it.

1184
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,380
So at the same time,
I understand that argument as well.

1185
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,420
No,
I think I'm completely in agreement with

1186
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:32,970
you.
I love the idea that they're all in,

1187
00:45:32,971 --> 00:45:35,520
but I don't want anybody in forcing that
on me and I want.

1188
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:36,413
I want a kid.
If a kid grows up in America and then 

1189
00:45:38,701 --> 00:45:39,451
decides,
Hey man,

1190
00:45:39,451 --> 00:45:41,550
I'm going to backpack across the country
now.

1191
00:45:41,551 --> 00:45:42,700
You can't.
You got to join the army.

1192
00:45:42,701 --> 00:45:43,800
You fuck,
I don't want that.

1193
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:44,460
You know,
I want.

1194
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,520
I want people to be doing whatever the 
fuck they want.

1195
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,271
Hey,
I want to be a,

1196
00:45:47,271 --> 00:45:49,920
a fly fishing guide in Colorado.
No,

1197
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,780
you can't.
You have to clean machine guns,

1198
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:52,410
right?
No.

1199
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,280
Fuck that.
I love the fact that America has so much

1200
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,280
ultimate freedom for like what you 
choose to do and not to do.

1201
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:00,293
Look,
we live in this sort of a experiment in 

1202
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:06,990
self government and you can not 
participate if you want to.

1203
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:08,410
I liked that.
I'd like to.

1204
00:46:08,411 --> 00:46:09,690
You don't have to vote.
I mean,

1205
00:46:09,691 --> 00:46:13,230
I'm not saying that everybody should 
fuck off and not vote,

1206
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:16,140
but I am saying that I liked that it's 
your option.

1207
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,333
Me Too.
I think they have compulsory voting in 

1208
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:19,560
Australia,
I want to say,

1209
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,990
and they'll tell that works out.
Fucking kangaroos everywhere.

1210
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:23,940
Crocodiles,
spider is poisonous.

1211
00:46:23,941 --> 00:46:25,440
Bugs and shit.
Got The place.

1212
00:46:25,441 --> 00:46:26,920
Looks horrifying.
But the,

1213
00:46:26,921 --> 00:46:27,754
uh,
no,

1214
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,180
I've never been either been.
I lived there.

1215
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,960
That's number three on my list yet we're
number one.

1216
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:33,811
America,
number two,

1217
00:46:33,811 --> 00:46:35,250
Canada,
number three,

1218
00:46:35,310 --> 00:46:35,880
Australia.

1219
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,080
That seems like a pretty reasonable.
Let's,

1220
00:46:37,081 --> 00:46:39,750
I mean I could list just being in the 
gaming industry.

1221
00:46:39,751 --> 00:46:42,270
I know a lot of people,
some people I really love that came from

1222
00:46:42,271 --> 00:46:43,500
Australia,
really friendly people,

1223
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,513
but the interior,
that country sounds like a just an 

1224
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,950
absolute fucking shit show.
It's crazy,

1225
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:49,310
but

1226
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:52,010
it's also really gorgeous.
It's wild.

1227
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,840
Uh,
I have a good buddy who lives over there

1228
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:56,030
who goes into the interior all the time 
and he,

1229
00:46:56,090 --> 00:46:56,923
uh,
he's the one who sent me a video of a 

1230
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:01,760
brown snake getting killed by some evil 
spider.

1231
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,913
There's some brown snake kills you 
instantly and there's some evil spider 

1232
00:47:06,291 --> 00:47:07,760
that was killing the brown snake.
I'm like,

1233
00:47:07,761 --> 00:47:09,260
what the fuck?
Kind of a shit hole.

1234
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:11,300
Do you live in Adam?
He's,

1235
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:13,220
he's a madman.
He's out there living in that shit.

1236
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,220
A man like me would not be able to 
survive their camps out there.

1237
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,310
He goes out into the Bush and shoots 
buffalo's a bow and arrow.

1238
00:47:19,311 --> 00:47:22,280
He's and he's a maniac,
but the area of,

1239
00:47:22,310 --> 00:47:25,220
uh,
Australia is the size of the continental

1240
00:47:25,221 --> 00:47:26,054
United States,
but there's as many people as less than 

1241
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:30,130
the amount of people

1242
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:33,190
that live in the greater Los Angeles 
area live in the entire.

1243
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,210
This whole fucking continent of 
Australia.

1244
00:47:37,211 --> 00:47:38,170
It's nuts.
That's incredible.

1245
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:38,980
Yeah.
It's like Perth on the,

1246
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:39,813
on the west coast,
and then it's just the Sydney and 

1247
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,650
Melbourne,
right on the east coast.

1248
00:47:41,651 --> 00:47:44,210
And that's basically cleans Queensland,
Queensland.

1249
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:45,143
There's a few other places,
but the bottom line is there's a giant 

1250
00:47:47,981 --> 00:47:51,130
percentage of that place where you don't
want to get caught dead.

1251
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,650
No,
no,

1252
00:47:51,650 --> 00:47:52,810
I,
I wouldn't.

1253
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:55,990
I'm the kind of guy with like where I 
see a spider and I have to argue with my

1254
00:47:55,991 --> 00:47:57,310
girlfriend who is going to kill it.
So I don't,

1255
00:47:57,311 --> 00:47:58,900
I don't want to.
I don't want to be really.

1256
00:47:58,901 --> 00:47:59,734
Yeah,
I hear you.

1257
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:01,860
We step up.
It's always,

1258
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:03,220
it's always,
it always ends up on me,

1259
00:48:03,221 --> 00:48:04,120
but I hate.
I hate,

1260
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:05,770
I hate spiders.
So,

1261
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,330
so if I see even these little,
I hate them.

1262
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,950
Do you get a rack in a phobia?
Do you know?

1263
00:48:08,951 --> 00:48:10,060
I don't think I have that.
I'm not going to like,

1264
00:48:10,061 --> 00:48:11,800
if I see one calling me,
I'm not going to run out the house,

1265
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,211
but I'm like,
oh,

1266
00:48:12,211 --> 00:48:13,044
I don't want to.
Is this thing in a job I have to like 

1267
00:48:13,681 --> 00:48:16,240
really think about my strategy on how 
I'm going to kill this thing.

1268
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:19,770
It's one of those things where I'm like,
so if I was in Austria,

1269
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,670
I'm just being honest with you.
So I was in Australia,

1270
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:24,310
you know,
that'd be super careful in Australia.

1271
00:48:24,311 --> 00:48:24,911
Oh my God,
Dude.

1272
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:26,620
I see some of these things when people 
were outside barbecuing,

1273
00:48:26,621 --> 00:48:28,120
even in Melbourne or something like 
that,

1274
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,680
and the camera pans the.
It's a brown snake.

1275
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,330
And I'm like,
holy Jesus,

1276
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:35,381
God,
I wouldn't.

1277
00:48:35,381 --> 00:48:38,830
I don't know.
The waters are filled with sharks.

1278
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:41,350
If you get past the sharks,
they're filled with jelly fish.

1279
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,840
You get to the shore is poisonous 
spiders.

1280
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:46,210
You go into the hills.
Is Poisons fucking snake.

1281
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,820
What is it about that part of the world?
They're like ruthless unbelieved.

1282
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:49,663
Yeah,
they were the man of war and all that 

1283
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:51,810
kind of stuff in the water and,
and,

1284
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:52,713
and the,
the box jellyfish or the scariest can 

1285
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,680
kill you.
They kill you if you fall into some sort

1286
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:01,990
of a patch or what do they call them?
A school of Jellyfish.

1287
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,830
If you accidentally stumble upon one,
you're a dead person.

1288
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:07,000
You're fucked.
I mean,

1289
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:08,620
they just,
you're dead instantly.

1290
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:10,660
That's really crazy.
They're a little tiny guys,

1291
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:11,494
right?
To someone that's warm on you in their 

1292
00:49:13,691 --> 00:49:14,524
heart.
They're jellyfish are always scary 

1293
00:49:15,611 --> 00:49:17,820
because growing up on long island we had
obviously harmless jellyfish,

1294
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:21,150
but they would wash up on the shore 
sometimes and I used to look at them.

1295
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:21,621
I was kind of like,
well,

1296
00:49:21,621 --> 00:49:23,110
these are so strange.
What is this,

1297
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,960
Jamie?
A spider.

1298
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,550
Killing a brown snake.
Another one,

1299
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,890
so spiders just eat ground snakes all 
the time.

1300
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:33,220
He's according that the weapons for cool
fine webs are awesome.

1301
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:34,900
It's horrifying.
Not,

1302
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:36,700
not to me.
Snakes or cons.

1303
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:40,090
I don't know whose team I'm on.
I think I'm on team snake more than I am

1304
00:49:40,091 --> 00:49:41,320
on a team sport.
I think I am too,

1305
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:42,940
just because they're less scary to me.
Plus,

1306
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:43,863
well you can eat spiders.
Apparently tarantulas are delicious and 

1307
00:49:46,181 --> 00:49:47,014
they cook them a lot.
In the Amazon they have these big 

1308
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:51,970
spiders that they cook and there are a 
lot like crabs.

1309
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:52,804
They taste like crabs and apparently 
they're really similar in their lineage 

1310
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,130
or genetic.
Interesting.

1311
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,080
Yeah,
I mean if you put a piece of.

1312
00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:00,010
If you put a spider and from it.

1313
00:50:00,010 --> 00:50:01,260
I didn't know what it was.
I'd be fine.

1314
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:02,480
I know.
Even if I didn't know what it was,

1315
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:03,790
if you know it's not gonna kill you when
it's dead.

1316
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:05,340
So yeah,
if it's good,

1317
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,400
if it's good,
if it's delectable,

1318
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,870
that's why I shouldn't say I've eaten 
spiders before on fear factor.

1319
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:13,960
I have eaten a couple of spiders.
I eat a cave African cave dwelling.

1320
00:50:13,961 --> 00:50:15,400
Spider.
Jamie just freaked out.

1321
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:16,690
You must have seen some things on that 
show,

1322
00:50:16,691 --> 00:50:17,021
man.
I'm like,

1323
00:50:17,021 --> 00:50:17,460
yeah,
I'm.

1324
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,600
I'm pretty numb.
Yeah,

1325
00:50:19,601 --> 00:50:21,670
I guess that explains a lot of your kind
of more.

1326
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:24,040
You've seen it all like an old 
prostitute.

1327
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:27,040
I've seen too much,
you know.

1328
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,010
No 50 year

1329
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,843
old prostitute in Holland.
Like whatever smoking a cigarette you 

1330
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:33,830
can show her do to me that lipstick on 
my teeth.

1331
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,880
I'm not even bothered to clean it off.
I'm,

1332
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,740
I'm curious about,
because you brought it up before,

1333
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:41,400
but what is your stance on Snowden?
Uh,

1334
00:50:41,401 --> 00:50:43,640
it seems like you're against the NSA and
all that kinda stuff,

1335
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,590
but what is your stance on him?
Like I'm curious.

1336
00:50:45,591 --> 00:50:47,360
Like what do you think he should come 
back?

1337
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:48,194
Do you think that he is a patriot?
I think he's more of a Patriot than he 

1338
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:52,310
is a trader.
I agree,

1339
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,293
but I think it's a very complex issue 
when you give away national secrets and 

1340
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:02,480
your you have signed an oath that you're
not going to give away national secrets.

1341
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:05,450
You sign an oath of secrecy and then you
give away national secrets,

1342
00:51:06,350 --> 00:51:09,680
but if those national secrets are in the
case of Edward Snowden,

1343
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:14,790
they're very detrimental to what we 
think of as freedom in this country.

1344
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,233
Like if you have a bunch of people like 
you or me or Jamie or it just a normal 

1345
00:51:19,401 --> 00:51:21,710
person and they work at the NSA and they
can,

1346
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,030
as he said,
he said,

1347
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:25,820
spy on their ex girlfriend's read their 
emails,

1348
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,890
go into anybody's email that you want to
check,

1349
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:28,933
check them out,
and then we were also being lied to by 

1350
00:51:32,061 --> 00:51:32,894
the government about the extent of these
searches and he exposed that that the 

1351
00:51:35,571 --> 00:51:37,370
president was saying it's just metadata 
and he was saying,

1352
00:51:37,371 --> 00:51:38,540
no,
it's not just metadata.

1353
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:39,374
It's not.
It's the actual emails is the actual 

1354
00:51:40,641 --> 00:51:43,250
text messages.
See actual photos that you're sending to

1355
00:51:43,251 --> 00:51:44,420
each other.
They can get those.

1356
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:47,030
They have all of those and that they're 
storing all this stuff.

1357
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:48,073
People were horrified,
but this is also something that was 

1358
00:51:49,611 --> 00:51:50,444
exposed.
There was an NSA whistleblower from 

1359
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,400
boom,
I want to say 2011.

1360
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,420
There was a guy who was a,
I think he was a coder and the NSA,

1361
00:51:59,421 --> 00:52:03,090
and he's gone public with this,
but he didn't go public with this in the

1362
00:52:03,091 --> 00:52:03,924
same way where he dumped a bunch of 
documents and and let people go through 

1363
00:52:07,701 --> 00:52:11,900
them like Edward Snowden did.
And he also didn't face the consequences

1364
00:52:11,901 --> 00:52:15,260
that Edward Snowden did as well.
He didn't really.

1365
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,333
He was criticized and you know,
it was debated whether or not him 

1366
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:22,040
talking about it at all was legal or 
whether it should be able to,

1367
00:52:22,041 --> 00:52:24,730
but ultimately he didn't face the same 
kind of consequences.

1368
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,630
Mean Edward Snowden can't live in 
America anymore.

1369
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:27,713
I mean,
Chelsea manning has been exonerated or 

1370
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,610
what would have been pardoned.
Pardon?

1371
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,543
Yeah.
Is that the word wasn't a partner when 

1372
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:35,620
you did commuter to sentence commuted 
the sentence.

1373
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:37,430
Right.
So the commute the sentence,

1374
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:41,270
and she's allowed to be free in May,
so in a couple months she'll be free,

1375
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:46,600
but he's stuck in Russia and he 
essentially the difference being,

1376
00:52:46,671 --> 00:52:47,504
they said that Chelsea manning went to 
like went through the court system was 

1377
00:52:53,151 --> 00:52:58,151
tried and then Obama decided that it was
a good enough amount of time and then he

1378
00:52:59,271 --> 00:53:00,440
was going to commute the sentence.

1379
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:01,783
So I kind of see their point there that 
Edward snowden fleed and didn't go 

1380
00:53:05,931 --> 00:53:08,090
through the whole but.
But why wouldn't he flee?

1381
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,560
You're going to lock them in a fucking 
cage.

1382
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:13,700
Chelsea manning was locked in a cage 24 
hours a day with the lights on,

1383
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:16,940
with no fucking clothes in solitary 
confinement.

1384
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,250
Confinement for,
I don't know how long,

1385
00:53:19,251 --> 00:53:21,770
but it was a long period of time.
I want to say years,

1386
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,550
I want to say how long was find out?
How long was Chelsea manning in solitary

1387
00:53:26,551 --> 00:53:28,770
confinement for?
Because I know the way they did it,

1388
00:53:28,771 --> 00:53:33,771
it was cold in there and they took away 
all her clothes or it was his clothes.

1389
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,670
At the time was he,
was he.

1390
00:53:35,690 --> 00:53:36,523
And when did you.
When did you start saying him or her a 

1391
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,310
deal with that?
Yeah,

1392
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,143
I don't.
I think at the All Africa point when 

1393
00:53:41,281 --> 00:53:43,320
you're thinking back on the person 
before they transitioned,

1394
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,360
like do you say that Bruce Jenner won 
the Olympics,

1395
00:53:45,361 --> 00:53:46,900
so do you say the Caitlyn Jenner won the
Olympics?

1396
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:47,823
Jesus,
I don't know another way to say the 

1397
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:49,920
wrong thing.
Okay.

1398
00:53:49,921 --> 00:53:50,754
The former army analysts with two weeks 
of solitary confinement connection with 

1399
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,710
the suicide attempt in July.
No,

1400
00:53:54,711 --> 00:53:55,140
no,
no.

1401
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:00,140
That's just one.
The declined to discipline them with two

1402
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:02,910
weeks now,
but she's been in solitary confinement,

1403
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:04,910
not just over the suicide attempt.
This is.

1404
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:08,580
This is like way late.
That's 2016 go.

1405
00:54:08,581 --> 00:54:09,414
I'm not.
Not the solitary confinement after 

1406
00:54:11,461 --> 00:54:12,294
suicide attempt,
but just go to solitary confinement and 

1407
00:54:15,211 --> 00:54:16,044
don't look at Chelsea,
look at Bradley manning solitary 

1408
00:54:19,231 --> 00:54:20,820
confinement.
It was before he was tried.

1409
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:21,683
Yeah,
it was like you could say he say he can 

1410
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:25,080
you get yelled at?
I bet you could.

1411
00:54:25,370 --> 00:54:26,203
I'm sure you will for say he,
but I think it's reasonable to say 

1412
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:31,140
before the transition when you went back
and posterity on on a person.

1413
00:54:31,141 --> 00:54:31,974
Maybe it's up to that person,
but I would assume that the Pronoun 

1414
00:54:34,291 --> 00:54:36,060
would change at that point.

1415
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,310
Give a fuck.
It's ridiculous.

1416
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:39,690
Confusing.
It's so stupid.

1417
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:41,350
There was a.
There was a case of A.

1418
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:45,960
I'm a transgender fighter who was a man 
for 30 years.

1419
00:54:45,961 --> 00:54:46,794
Became a woman for two years and started
beating the fuck out of these women and 

1420
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:50,730
didn't tell them by the way.
Oh,

1421
00:54:50,731 --> 00:54:52,620
so they didn't.
So the organizers or whatever it didn't.

1422
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:53,683
He didn't tell us she whatever,
didn't tell the people that she was 

1423
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:59,100
fighting,
but here's the best part about it.

1424
00:54:59,101 --> 00:55:04,101
I was debating with someone online and 
this woman said that she's always been a

1425
00:55:05,191 --> 00:55:06,024
woman,
that this person has always been a 

1426
00:55:07,021 --> 00:55:07,771
woman.
And I said,

1427
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:09,840
okay,
do you realize that this person fathered

1428
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:11,160
a child?
I said,

1429
00:55:11,161 --> 00:55:15,390
so even when he was a man having sex 
with a woman and got her pregnant,

1430
00:55:16,030 --> 00:55:18,330
he was a.
He was a woman then and this woman goes,

1431
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,590
even then I'm like,
okay,

1432
00:55:19,591 --> 00:55:20,250
we're done.

1433
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,080
We'll fuck.
That doesn't make sense.

1434
00:55:22,590 --> 00:55:26,940
I owe 23 hours a day for over an 11 
month period.

1435
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:31,630
Shit and conditions that he also found 
might have constituted tortured,

1436
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,210
tortured Juan Mendez has completed a 14 
month investigation and the treatment of

1437
00:55:36,211 --> 00:55:39,660
manning since the soldiers arrested US 
military base in May of 2010.

1438
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:40,703
He concludes the US military was at 
least culpable of cruel and inhumane 

1439
00:55:43,411 --> 00:55:44,244
treatment and keeping manning locked up 
alone for 23 hours a day for an over an 

1440
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,480
11 month period in conditions that he 
found.

1441
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:52,560
Okay.
So yeah,

1442
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:53,790
that was,
that was what it was.

1443
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:54,624
It was,
it was almost a year of solitary 

1444
00:55:56,491 --> 00:56:01,491
confinement and I'm pretty sure that he,
at the time she now was naked and um,

1445
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:05,250
they took everything away from him.
No books,

1446
00:56:05,251 --> 00:56:07,850
no nothing.
So it's really nothing to read.

1447
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,713
Nothing cold.
They keep it cold to keep it cold where 

1448
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,180
you're like barely able to tolerate it.

1449
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,140
Holy Shit.
What do you do?

1450
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,340
Like what is your,
what is your,

1451
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,490
what are the places your mind goes?
I would start doing Kung Fu.

1452
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,810
Yeah.
I'll just start.

1453
00:56:18,870 --> 00:56:19,703
Just start working on it.
I'd be like Wesley Snipes in that one 

1454
00:56:23,741 --> 00:56:28,060
movie where they kept him locked up,
I think stripped naked at night.

1455
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:31,150
Yeah.
I think that,

1456
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:32,190
you know,
what,

1457
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,420
what they did was what they are allowed 
to do.

1458
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:35,403
You know,
you're allowed to do whatever you want 

1459
00:56:36,091 --> 00:56:38,080
to do when you get someone locked up 
like that.

1460
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:40,600
They don't really have the kind of 
rights that are around an average person

1461
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:41,434
does.
You get locked up for treason and there 

1462
00:56:43,721 --> 00:56:44,554
was a tremendous amount of heat coming 
towards the US military when that wiki 

1463
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:49,390
leaks video.
Um,

1464
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,320
uh,
what was the,

1465
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,120
what was it called?
What did they call it?

1466
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:55,110
Something about collateral murder.
I think that was what they call it.

1467
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:55,953
Was it?
Was it,

1468
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,360
was it drones or was it.
No,

1469
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,130
it was a helicopter.
Oh,

1470
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:00,611
I know.
Okay.

1471
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:01,420
I know you talked about.
Yep.

1472
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,253
Helicopter shooting.
Fucking horrific gunfire down on these 

1473
00:57:05,861 --> 00:57:07,570
people.
That turned out to be reporters.

1474
00:57:07,780 --> 00:57:11,530
And then the callous attitude that these
soldiers showed in the video,

1475
00:57:11,531 --> 00:57:14,230
we can hear them talking about whether 
or not there are kids in the van.

1476
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:15,280
Well,
they shouldn't have brought kids.

1477
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,473
Like the whole thing was like really 
dark and I think in a lot of ways 

1478
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,113
exposure to that stuff is good because 
unchecked behavior is extremely 

1479
00:57:26,231 --> 00:57:29,110
dangerous.
That seemed like it was unchecked and it

1480
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:33,490
seemed like unchecked behavior in a time
of war is extremely dangerous and it was

1481
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:37,570
pretty obvious that when you looked at 
what at Edward Snowden had revealed,

1482
00:57:37,571 --> 00:57:38,404
it was pretty obvious that the majority 
of the American people had a huge 

1483
00:57:41,741 --> 00:57:43,780
problem with it.
The majority of the American people,

1484
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:46,930
you or I who are doing nothing wrong.
I'm not committing any crimes.

1485
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,300
I'm not.
I'm certainly not victimizing anybody.

1486
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,040
Why do they have access to my email?
Why?

1487
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:54,640
There's no reason,
no reason.

1488
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:55,474
You just can like that.
That seems insane and that to me is a 

1489
00:57:59,051 --> 00:58:01,360
way clear violation of the fourth 
amendment.

1490
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,493
Then this weird sort of gray area.
Not necessarily great if you're looking 

1491
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:09,910
at it from a constitutional sense of how
they're allowed to check you out.

1492
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:10,591
Yeah.
No,

1493
00:58:10,591 --> 00:58:12,290
that's great.
That's a very valid and solid argument.

1494
00:58:12,291 --> 00:58:13,124
I think because my,
my stance on manning specifically as 

1495
00:58:15,821 --> 00:58:17,960
soften,
soften overtime because I feel like,

1496
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:19,700
um,
you know,

1497
00:58:19,701 --> 00:58:23,960
when he or she can we call her Z,
Z.

1498
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,460
I'm not trying to be disrespectful.
I just don't know.

1499
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:26,700
What else was he in?
Disrespectful.

1500
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,370
You fucking son of a bitch.
Sorry.

1501
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:29,530
Racist too.
I know,

1502
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,433
I know.
That's what that Lexis nexis will call 

1503
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,120
me a racist for the rest of my life.
Um,

1504
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:34,520
but uh,
yeah.

1505
00:58:34,521 --> 00:58:36,390
To me it was like,
I felt like it was,

1506
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,510
it was very.
They didn't take the time to,

1507
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,550
to people died because of that stuff 
like there,

1508
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,880
there are people that were put in danger
because of the things that they were put

1509
00:58:43,881 --> 00:58:44,714
out because it wasn't,
they didn't carefully comb through it 

1510
00:58:46,071 --> 00:58:48,040
and make sure that he's actually done.

1511
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:48,430
Yeah.
Yeah.

1512
00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:50,290
I mean you could look,
I don't think that they look that,

1513
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,313
look that up and say it's because of the
way wikileaks released it yet because I 

1514
00:58:54,471 --> 00:58:55,304
don't think that.
I don't know if they're going to point 

1515
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,710
that specific things,
but the,

1516
00:58:56,890 --> 00:58:59,060
the way things were out there,
like I don't think all of the names were

1517
00:58:59,061 --> 00:58:59,894
blacked out.
I don't think like the operate the 

1518
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,330
operations and process,
like people were in play,

1519
00:59:02,390 --> 00:59:04,280
you know,
that we're being out at in that way.

1520
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:05,353
I think the reason I was a little softer
on snowden was because not only was it 

1521
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:08,144
domestic primarily,
but which I think is an important 

1522
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:11,743
qualifier,
but also because I think he went out of 

1523
00:59:13,521 --> 00:59:15,890
his way to not single any individuals 
out.

1524
00:59:15,891 --> 00:59:19,720
It was all about the apparatus itself.
It wasn't about like saying like General

1525
00:59:19,721 --> 00:59:22,250
Blah Blah,
blah is doing this general or admiral,

1526
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,480
but it was about like,
Hey,

1527
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:27,830
this structure exists and it's really as
quite nefarious indeed.

1528
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,850
You know?
And I think that.

1529
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,043
So I was always to me my stance on him 
as he's a patriot and you should be 

1530
00:59:31,731 --> 00:59:33,530
welcomed home and the fact that he 
wasn't.

1531
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:34,903
He can't be,
I guess party hasn't been tried or 

1532
00:59:35,781 --> 00:59:36,614
whatever.
But the fact that I know that some 

1533
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:38,564
people think that Obama only pardoned 
manning because it made him look good 

1534
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:45,860
with the transgender community and with 
the Lbgtq community,

1535
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:49,130
which I think is a little.
There might be a living office though.

1536
00:59:49,230 --> 00:59:50,450
Well,
because it's part of his legacy.

1537
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:51,500
Like it's part of what I'm saying.
Like,

1538
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:52,910
you know,
it's the same reason why you know,

1539
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:56,390
how much Ford was hurt when he pardoned 
Nixon that stuck with them forever and a

1540
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:56,991
negative way.
Well,

1541
00:59:56,991 --> 00:59:57,824
this is going to stick with Obama,
I think positively in a good way of 

1542
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,753
moving forward.

1543
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,230
But I don't know that I'm,
I'm not,

1544
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:05,450
I'm quite that callous and thinking that
that's the only reason.

1545
01:00:05,451 --> 01:00:07,550
I think that he probably had time to 
marinate on it.

1546
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,030
Clearly she went through some rigorous.
Well,

1547
01:00:11,031 --> 01:00:14,720
also what's important to point out is 
that Obama's website,

1548
01:00:14,721 --> 01:00:15,554
the hope and change website that he had 
when he was running for president and 

1549
01:00:18,321 --> 01:00:21,500
when he got into office,
the original website had in it,

1550
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:24,560
these provisions for how he was going to
treat whistleblowers with,

1551
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:25,810
with,
uh,

1552
01:00:25,810 --> 01:00:26,643
they were gonna allow people to release 
information that showed crimes and they 

1553
01:00:30,921 --> 01:00:32,990
were going to protect them.
They're going to protect whistleblowers.

1554
01:00:32,991 --> 01:00:33,824
It was a very specific statement,
was a very specific approach that they 

1555
01:00:38,451 --> 01:00:39,284
were having while he was running for 
president about whistleblowers because 

1556
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:45,690
he was about exposing these agregious 
offenses and when,

1557
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,633
once he got into office,
one of the things that happened after 

1558
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:52,250
the Chelsea manning thing and after the 
Edward Snowden things,

1559
01:00:52,251 --> 01:00:54,620
they removed that from the hope and 
change website.

1560
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,560
The removed that provision about 
whistleblowers.

1561
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:57,740
Interesting.
Because it's obviously,

1562
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:59,930
it was obviously it was,
he was unable.

1563
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:02,290
He's either a hypocrite or is unable to 
keep that promise.

1564
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:03,153
Right.
Well,

1565
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,400
that goes back to the whole thing with 
snowden.

1566
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,370
When you're saying,
well you kind of take an oath to protect

1567
01:01:07,371 --> 01:01:08,720
these secrets and all that kind of 
stuff,

1568
01:01:08,721 --> 01:01:10,440
but I look at it,
you know,

1569
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:12,530
I don't want people to be flippant with 
that kind of stuff that you were saying.

1570
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:13,730
I want people to be flippantly being 
like,

1571
01:01:13,731 --> 01:01:14,564
well this is,
I have some sort of personal problem 

1572
01:01:15,321 --> 01:01:16,730
with this,
but I actually think it takes a level of

1573
01:01:16,731 --> 01:01:19,310
courage to be like,
what in the fuck is going on here?

1574
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,001
Oh,
for sure.

1575
01:01:20,001 --> 01:01:23,420
And also I believe that before he gave 
that information to Glenn Greenwald,

1576
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:24,583
I believe he offered it to a bunch of 
different mainstream news sources like 

1577
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,660
New York Times,
Washington Post.

1578
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,340
I've correct me if I'm wrong,
Jamie.

1579
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:32,570
I think that was in the documentary,
the,

1580
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:36,420
the um,
I didn't see it or something like that.

1581
01:01:36,450 --> 01:01:38,870
You fell asleep,
tried to watch it in a hotel room.

1582
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,783
What's up?
Just say which one do you want me to 

1583
01:01:41,301 --> 01:01:42,680
look up because I got the.
It's a no,

1584
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:46,640
no one died as a result of which one?
Which one?

1585
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:49,990
The one earlier about Chelsea manning.
Jamie does it.

1586
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:50,853
It doesn't say anything about that was,
I remember that being contentious that 

1587
01:01:52,521 --> 01:01:53,354
they,
they were saying the reason that they 

1588
01:01:53,691 --> 01:01:54,800
were upset about it was because they 
were like,

1589
01:01:54,801 --> 01:01:56,570
this puts people that are in play in 
danger.

1590
01:01:56,571 --> 01:01:59,040
Now.
Maybe that maybe that may be dangerous,

1591
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:01,280
but maybe no one actually does good.
The writer had a,

1592
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,193
a usa today piece,
I think about it and she got a lot of 

1593
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:04,844
heat for pope,
for even writing that up in the first 

1594
01:02:07,371 --> 01:02:08,204
place.
That puts people in danger that people 

1595
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:11,880
died from the result of his leaks.
Okay.

1596
01:02:11,881 --> 01:02:13,520
So she got a lot of heat because they 
haven't.

1597
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,230
Oh,
interest is probably what it is.

1598
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,640
You probably read that.
Okay.

1599
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:18,230
Yeah man.
People again,

1600
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:19,890
you're a racist and

1601
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:22,100
people have died.
I mean Google says it but,

1602
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:23,240
but you know what I'm saying?
I mean like,

1603
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:24,083
people need clickbait.
So with her writing an article saying 

1604
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,650
that bunch of people died or someone 
died.

1605
01:02:29,070 --> 01:02:29,903
It's this kind of the same thing.
They're trying to make something jucier 

1606
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:33,473
sure.
I'd go and even with the London 

1607
01:02:34,261 --> 01:02:35,490
terrorist attack,
uh,

1608
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:36,510
you know,
recent one.

1609
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,373
Yeah.
The one that just happened where people 

1610
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:40,290
they've seen too,
I've identified the person,

1611
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,740
get new sources that were that what you 
think are reputable,

1612
01:02:43,741 --> 01:02:45,270
say it and then they have to retract it 
later.

1613
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:47,710
Everyone's.
Everyone's very quick to try to pull the

1614
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:48,870
pull the gun first and be like,
well,

1615
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:50,040
we have.
We have the story.

1616
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,900
Yeah,
we're all victimized.

1617
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:53,370
As you know,
people that are just,

1618
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:54,420
you know,
we're not in the trenches,

1619
01:02:54,421 --> 01:02:55,254
so we need the information.
We have to trust these people and trust 

1620
01:02:57,121 --> 01:02:57,540
is broken.

1621
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,373
I think in a Lola and I certainly think 
there should be some sort of a national 

1622
01:03:01,501 --> 01:03:04,890
debate on whether or not Edward Snowden 
is a hero.

1623
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,113
You know,
whether or not Edward Snowden did 

1624
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:08,124
something that benefited the American 
people because I certainly think the 

1625
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:14,130
overall reaction,
the overall,

1626
01:03:14,131 --> 01:03:14,964
like if you look at what Edward Snowden 
did and then you look at what are the 

1627
01:03:17,221 --> 01:03:18,054
consequences of what he did.
I think it's good for us because we got 

1628
01:03:21,001 --> 01:03:21,834
to see that all these Alex Jones type 
conspiracies were actually true when 

1629
01:03:25,891 --> 01:03:28,770
Alex Jones is ranting and raving about 
the government living in your emails.

1630
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:30,420
One of the great episodes of the show,
by the way,

1631
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:31,254
I love it,
but people were looking into that like 

1632
01:03:32,311 --> 01:03:33,144
there's no fucking way.
There's no way that government really 

1633
01:03:34,501 --> 01:03:36,450
looks into your email.
There's no way it doesn't happen,

1634
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,280
but yes they do.
Like that was.

1635
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:39,263
That was a stunner to me and this for me
was I'd been telling people that Alex 

1636
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,113
Jones,
who's my friend and has been my friend 

1637
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:49,980
for a long time and I get criticized so 
much by people that they're like,

1638
01:03:49,981 --> 01:03:52,820
he's so crazy and he's such a fucking 
right wing Wacko.

1639
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:54,540
I'm like,
Alex Jones is not right wing.

1640
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,970
He's not.
He's antigovernment.

1641
01:03:57,090 --> 01:03:57,923
He's anti tyranny and,
and he might be crazy as fuck and he 

1642
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:00,924
probably is,
but he's right about a lot of shit and 

1643
01:04:03,181 --> 01:04:04,940
that's where it gets really scary.
So he's.

1644
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:05,774
He was talking about the NSA,
looking into people's emails and having 

1645
01:04:07,771 --> 01:04:08,604
the ability to,
like I found out about that NSA 

1646
01:04:11,731 --> 01:04:13,320
whistleblower,
the original one.

1647
01:04:13,321 --> 01:04:16,830
See if you could find who that guy is.
I want to say yes,

1648
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:17,641
yes.
Pull it,

1649
01:04:17,641 --> 01:04:18,810
pull it,
pull up that article.

1650
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,310
I found out about that from Alex.

1651
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:21,420
he told me about it.
I'm like,

1652
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:23,130
what?
And then I hear Bill Binney,

1653
01:04:23,131 --> 01:04:27,030
the original NSA whistleblower on in 
nine slash 11 and illegal surveillance.

1654
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:28,680
Now.
He was a god,

1655
01:04:28,681 --> 01:04:30,510
I want to say it was before nine slash 
11,

1656
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:31,980
wasn't it?
Before nine slash 11.

1657
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:34,050
Then he came out with this scroll down.
Oh,

1658
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:34,884
was it right after nine slash 11.
He believes that nine slash 11 was 

1659
01:04:36,871 --> 01:04:38,730
preventable.
A month after it happened.

1660
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:39,803
He resigned in protest from the National
Security Agency bidding was part of an 

1661
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,210
elite NSA team that was,
which,

1662
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,053
uh,
designed and built an intelligence 

1663
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:51,660
gathering system to target and collect 
data on terrorism threats.

1664
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:53,850
He belongs to an intimate group of,
of,

1665
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:54,863
for whistleblowers,
each of whom left the NSA after raising 

1666
01:04:57,961 --> 01:05:00,570
concerns about failures and the 
agencies.

1667
01:05:00,571 --> 01:05:04,470
Intelligence gathering capabilities.
Yeah.

1668
01:05:04,471 --> 01:05:05,304
So he's a.
He was the first guy that was saying 

1669
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:07,974
what they're doing is bullshit.
And he alleges the NSA buried key 

1670
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:14,040
intelligence that could have prevented 
nine slash 11.

1671
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,130
He alleges the agency's bulk data 
collection from Internet and telephone

1672
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:21,620
communications is unconstitutional and 
illegal in the U.

1673
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:26,621
s he alleges that the NSA is ineffective
at preventing terrorism because analysts

1674
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:29,380
are too swamped with information on.
That makes sense.

1675
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,150
I'm under its bulk collection program.
That totally makes sense.

1676
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:34,790
Yeah.
When you're.

1677
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:35,800
When you have everything,
what do you.

1678
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:36,810
Where do you begin?
Yeah,

1679
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,740
I mean all those things that he's.
I mean,

1680
01:05:38,741 --> 01:05:40,090
that's.
There's no way.

1681
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,160
I mean that's the thing.
Like a friend of mine,

1682
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:44,250
I was joking around about this because 
managers,

1683
01:05:44,290 --> 01:05:46,660
I'm just not comfortable with the NSA 
reading my email.

1684
01:05:46,661 --> 01:05:47,950
I go,
of course you're not comfortable.

1685
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:49,330
I'm not either.
But guess what,

1686
01:05:50,110 --> 01:05:52,900
who's fucking reading your shit man?
Nobody's reading your shit.

1687
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:55,210
No,
that's not even the point.

1688
01:05:55,211 --> 01:05:56,070
Right?
Well,

1689
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:56,913
it goes back to the point you were 
making because with the Patriot Act 

1690
01:05:58,541 --> 01:06:00,130
after 9:11,
they made the same argument.

1691
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:01,420
Well,
if you have nothing to hide,

1692
01:06:01,421 --> 01:06:01,570
right.

1693
01:06:01,570 --> 01:06:04,030
But the problem is,
is soon as something comes up,

1694
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:04,960
like they go,
hmm,

1695
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:05,680
this column,
Moriarty,

1696
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:07,840
he's been talking to a lot of shit.
Let's find out what he's into,

1697
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:09,190
but I'll look at that.
A bunch of Dick Pics,

1698
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:09,710
right?
Right.

1699
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:11,890
Time to put those all in one that.
Hey Bro,

1700
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:12,753
nothing wrong.
We take pictures.

1701
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:14,290
Uh,
but uh,

1702
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:14,861
yeah,
no,

1703
01:06:14,861 --> 01:06:16,230
I,
I think I kind of,

1704
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,580
I think we're in the lead with that.
I think snowden is a hero.

1705
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:19,501
Uh,
I,

1706
01:06:19,501 --> 01:06:21,790
I feel like what he did took a lot of 
courage.

1707
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:22,713
Uh,
and,

1708
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,280
and,
and it blow up his life.

1709
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:27,310
I would like to,
if I go to Russia and uh,

1710
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:29,770
I might go to Russia for the UFC.
I'd like to meet that dude.

1711
01:06:29,950 --> 01:06:31,540
I'll let you interview him.
He probably would talk to you.

1712
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,500
Jamie,
you want to go to Russia?

1713
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:38,700
Big Pause.
We'll talk about data when I was younger

1714
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:41,020
and I was trying to think of like,
I don't want to put an next by him.

1715
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,320
I don't want to put you on the spot,
but if it was possible to meet that guy,

1716
01:06:46,321 --> 01:06:47,154
I would love to meet that guy.
I don't know if they just let you meet 

1717
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:50,610
them though.
I bet it would be like really hard.

1718
01:06:50,611 --> 01:06:52,950
I know John Oliver met him.
Shane Smith did too.

1719
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:53,903
Yeah.
Yeah,

1720
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:55,460
that's right.
Maybe I'd go with Shane.

1721
01:06:56,370 --> 01:06:58,020
Shane Hook it up.
You would probably love to talk to you.

1722
01:06:58,021 --> 01:06:58,790
I mean he,
he,

1723
01:06:58,790 --> 01:07:00,620
he seems like an interesting.
He's probably caught on a contract,

1724
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:01,860
constant surveillance you have to 
assume,

1725
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:04,710
but I'm sure I would be fucked when I 
came back.

1726
01:07:04,711 --> 01:07:06,390
They probably check everything.
Oh my God.

1727
01:07:06,391 --> 01:07:07,224
Yeah.
I would like to sit down with that guy 

1728
01:07:07,771 --> 01:07:10,440
for a few hours,
like a do like a six hour interview with

1729
01:07:10,441 --> 01:07:13,140
him and just pick them apart and ask 
like,

1730
01:07:13,141 --> 01:07:14,540
what is your life like now man?

1731
01:07:14,550 --> 01:07:19,550
Like how many brushing chicks you 
banging your here over here pay you.

1732
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:21,900
What do you,
how do you eat?

1733
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:24,660
What do you do to feed yourself?
Like where's he getting these money?

1734
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,250
He must got a stipend of some sort.
You have to assume,

1735
01:07:26,251 --> 01:07:27,750
right?
I mean you have to.

1736
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:28,793
I mean he's a guest of there so you have
to assume that he's taken care of in 

1737
01:07:30,811 --> 01:07:31,531
some way.
Right.

1738
01:07:31,531 --> 01:07:34,650
But I mean he probably has to keep his 
value high,

1739
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,810
like at a certain point in time,
like they,

1740
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,220
they,
they could say hey,

1741
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,650
you're not valuable to us anymore time 
to live in Guatemala,

1742
01:07:40,651 --> 01:07:42,050
bitch.
He,

1743
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:43,260
I mean,
he's a very smart man,

1744
01:07:43,261 --> 01:07:47,130
so he must know at the highest level 
that he is a geopolitical pawn that,

1745
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,710
like you said,
could be played in any way at any point.

1746
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:50,550
You know,
it was him.

1747
01:07:50,551 --> 01:07:54,360
I would just be listening to Rosetta 
stone with Russia all day long.

1748
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:55,223
I'll be like,
I need to find out how to speak Russian 

1749
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:01,770
and I need to fucking go hide in Siberia
or something and to grow my beard out.

1750
01:08:02,730 --> 01:08:03,240
Yeah.
He's,

1751
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:04,830
he's an interesting cat.
Like I,

1752
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:05,431
I,
I'm,

1753
01:08:05,431 --> 01:08:07,560
I'm somewhat fascinated by him.
I don't think we've,

1754
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:08,603
I think you'll come back at some point 
that Neil degrasse Tyson had a 

1755
01:08:10,301 --> 01:08:11,134
fascinating interview with him on 
startalk radio where I was in Neil 

1756
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:15,800
degrasse Tyson.
Essentially we're the same thing that he

1757
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,240
thinks he's a patriot,
you know,

1758
01:08:17,241 --> 01:08:18,074
uh,
Neil doesn't really take too many 

1759
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,680
stances like that are really political 
in that regard.

1760
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:22,514
But I think as far as like data 
collection or random of just a blanket 

1761
01:08:27,741 --> 01:08:29,780
data collection of all the people in the
United States,

1762
01:08:29,781 --> 01:08:34,460
I think it's fucked.
And it's absolutely not what we think of

1763
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:35,294
when we think of the freedom that the 
United States supposedly provides its 

1764
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:39,524
citizens.

1765
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:43,730
It seems like we're all under suspicion 
then we're all being under surveillance.

1766
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:47,420
That's some really creepy orwell type 
shit,

1767
01:08:47,870 --> 01:08:49,910
you know,
that's just not what we want.

1768
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,470
It's extremely Orwellian.
And I,

1769
01:08:51,740 --> 01:08:53,170
it goes,
I feel like with Snowden,

1770
01:08:53,180 --> 01:08:54,980
sometimes people miss the forest for the
trees with it.

1771
01:08:54,981 --> 01:08:57,260
They're very focused on the man in the 
act,

1772
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:59,070
but they're not focused on,
you know,

1773
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,620
one of the things that I'm really 
interested in is like,

1774
01:09:00,621 --> 01:09:01,770
what is the complicity?
Well,

1775
01:09:01,771 --> 01:09:03,530
what is the level of complicity with the
telecoms?

1776
01:09:03,531 --> 01:09:04,364
Like what is the complicity with the 
government like forcing these people 

1777
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:06,281
and,
and,

1778
01:09:06,281 --> 01:09:09,740
and there's a whole and how many 
thousands of people are in on this?

1779
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:11,750
And that's the whole,
that's the crazy thing is that snowden,

1780
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:12,853
who was a contractor,
not even really in the inner sanctum of 

1781
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:17,480
the NSA,
knew all of this stuff.

1782
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:18,553
There are people running around 
thousands of people just acting like 

1783
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:21,170
this never happened or wasn't going on.

1784
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:22,013
So it's a pretty,
it's not a conspiracy because we know 

1785
01:09:23,091 --> 01:09:23,924
it's true,
but it's a pretty big thing where I'm 

1786
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:27,560
like focusing on Snowden is missing the 
entire point.

1787
01:09:27,561 --> 01:09:28,394
There's like,
why are all like why didn't no one like 

1788
01:09:31,461 --> 01:09:33,110
no sprint or t mobile?
Anyone was like,

1789
01:09:33,111 --> 01:09:33,944
Hey,
well you imagine the kind of cool would 

1790
01:09:34,781 --> 01:09:37,460
have been for one of those companies 
would be like we're not doing this.

1791
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,960
And in fact like we're going to tell 
everyone,

1792
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:40,120
you know,
like,

1793
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,230
what will this will make us look 
amazing,

1794
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:43,163
you know,
from a very shrewd corporate stance and 

1795
01:09:44,431 --> 01:09:46,210
be like,
well we don't grow.

1796
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:48,650
Let's be honest.
I would never happen.

1797
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:51,890
And if it did happen they would come 
down on that company so hard.

1798
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:52,724
There has to be some weird sort of 
arrangements of these gigantic 

1799
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:56,774
telecommunication companies like verizon
or something has with the federal 

1800
01:09:59,271 --> 01:10:00,710
government and we just has to be.

1801
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:01,873
I think it's just protecting the bottom.
I mean I'm sure that there's something 

1802
01:10:03,441 --> 01:10:04,274
they can do,
but they don't care about anything but 

1803
01:10:04,821 --> 01:10:05,654
money.
So I have a friend who used to be a big 

1804
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:08,114
executive at Google and she described to
me some of the conversations that they 

1805
01:10:10,671 --> 01:10:11,504
had when they were dealing with the 
government and search engines and being 

1806
01:10:15,681 --> 01:10:18,650
able to access people's search engine 
results.

1807
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:22,820
And then also with China,
like how when Google went over to China,

1808
01:10:22,821 --> 01:10:23,654
like there was very specific things they
had to agree to what the government in 

1809
01:10:28,071 --> 01:10:32,930
order to make sure that they were there,
they had to restrict the searches.

1810
01:10:32,931 --> 01:10:34,640
They had to.
They had to censor things.

1811
01:10:34,641 --> 01:10:35,474
I mean the government of China does not 
feel the same way about freedom as the 

1812
01:10:38,121 --> 01:10:38,954
government.
The United States and the government of 

1813
01:10:39,830 --> 01:10:41,930
the United States gets real sketchy with
it.

1814
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:42,863
W,
as soon as you're doing what Edward 

1815
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,493
Snowden has proven that they're doing,
you're getting really sketchy with 

1816
01:10:47,211 --> 01:10:48,044
freedom.
I mean you can land of the free home of 

1817
01:10:49,581 --> 01:10:51,710
the brave.
Except I want to look at your Dick Pics,

1818
01:10:52,190 --> 01:10:54,230
except I want to read your emails to 
one,

1819
01:10:54,231 --> 01:10:55,064
to listen to your voicemails,
except I want to be able to track your 

1820
01:10:57,231 --> 01:10:59,000
calls.
I accept.

1821
01:10:59,001 --> 01:11:01,850
I want to be able to know where your 
phone is at all times.

1822
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,790
I mean,
that metadata from where the location of

1823
01:11:04,791 --> 01:11:05,624
your phone is,
is one of the primary ways they target 

1824
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:09,320
terrorists.
I mean,

1825
01:11:09,321 --> 01:11:14,090
the people who are not aware of why so 
many civilians die and these terrorist

1826
01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:16,320
attacks,
the part of the reason,

1827
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:18,480
especially in the early days of drone 
attacks,

1828
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:20,043
um,
uh,

1829
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:23,070
when they were trying to target 
terrorists rather would,

1830
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:23,993
was that they would use the metadata.
They would find out where the phones 

1831
01:11:27,181 --> 01:11:28,014
are.
So if your phone was in this apartment 

1832
01:11:29,401 --> 01:11:30,234
building,
they're going to bomb that apartment 

1833
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:32,040
building.

1834
01:11:32,040 --> 01:11:32,910
It's like,
whoa.

1835
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:33,231
Yeah,
it's,

1836
01:11:33,231 --> 01:11:34,064
it's very deep.
It's very technical and I have no 

1837
01:11:35,401 --> 01:11:37,340
problem with them going to a shadow 
court and,

1838
01:11:37,470 --> 01:11:39,030
and getting like a permission to be 
like,

1839
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:40,950
we're tracking this guy's full right 
now.

1840
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,073
We're,
we're reading this guy or this 

1841
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:43,464
organization's emails or people that are
kind of within seven degrees of 

1842
01:11:45,271 --> 01:11:47,130
separation or whatever from this person 
there.

1843
01:11:47,131 --> 01:11:49,140
At least there's some sort of orderly 
nature to it.

1844
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,003
Right?
Like,

1845
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:52,280
you don't need to be reading my emails 
or my,

1846
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:52,970
My,
you know,

1847
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,750
I'm just getting uber receipt,
sent them an email where it's like,

1848
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,000
what,
why are you even storing all this?

1849
01:11:57,001 --> 01:11:57,601
And I'm like,
what is,

1850
01:11:57,601 --> 01:11:59,600
what use is it other than the,
obviously they want friends,

1851
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:00,473
they want data that they can big high 
updata a eagle eye data and saying like 

1852
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:05,940
this is the trend and all these kinds of
things.

1853
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:08,960
But it's all elba gotten because it's 
like it's not it,

1854
01:12:08,970 --> 01:12:09,803
it's not right.
And that was the disappointing them and 

1855
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:12,323
you probably feel the same way.
Joe is like after snowden and the NSA 

1856
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,100
was a big store,
but then everyone kind of just like,

1857
01:12:17,101 --> 01:12:18,960
oh yeah.
And everyone kind of forgot,

1858
01:12:18,961 --> 01:12:21,900
well they're still kind of doing a lot 
of the same kind of thing.

1859
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:23,700
We didn't,
they didn't affect the way we know about

1860
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:24,330
it now,
but we didn't.

1861
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:26,970
We don't know that the level of change 
that was affected really.

1862
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,170
And,
and,

1863
01:12:28,171 --> 01:12:29,004
and to me,
I feel like this is the thing where you 

1864
01:12:30,161 --> 01:12:32,400
got to keep the pedal down and you've 
got to keep going and be like,

1865
01:12:32,401 --> 01:12:34,710
this is not okay,
this is not right.

1866
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:35,810
Uh,
and,

1867
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:37,320
and uh,
it's the same thing with um,

1868
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:38,673
w with the Patriot Act back in the day 
where everyone was really upset about 

1869
01:12:40,291 --> 01:12:41,520
that.
We have every right to be upset about.

1870
01:12:41,521 --> 01:12:43,220
That's really egregious stuff.
Sure.

1871
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,160
A mean,
the NDA,

1872
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:49,730
what they've essentially done is they've
eliminated the right of due process.

1873
01:12:49,731 --> 01:12:51,980
They can lock you up for as long as they
want.

1874
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:56,090
They can deny you any sort of a legal 
representation.

1875
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:56,953
That's,
that's,

1876
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,450
that's all been taken away from us.
Now.

1877
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,360
What used to be one of the foundations 
of being an American,

1878
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:05,540
the right to due process,
right to have a lawyer,

1879
01:13:05,541 --> 01:13:09,380
the right to a trial of your own peers.
All that stuff has kind of gone.

1880
01:13:09,381 --> 01:13:11,510
Now.
They just decide that you're a terrorist

1881
01:13:11,750 --> 01:13:13,440
and they could decide you're a terrorist
if you spell,

1882
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:14,990
if you,
if you have weed on you,

1883
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:19,070
if you are involved in illegal drugs,
you can be under the Patriot Act,

1884
01:13:19,071 --> 01:13:21,500
considered a terrorist.
It's really kind of crazy.

1885
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:22,211
It is,
and it's.

1886
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:23,044
It's scary in the sense too because it 
goes back to what they were saying or 

1887
01:13:24,291 --> 01:13:25,124
what this gentleman was saying that we 
were just talking about where he was 

1888
01:13:26,931 --> 01:13:27,650
saying like,
oh,

1889
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,750
they have too much data.
They have too much to work with.

1890
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:31,250
At some point someone has to be like,
Hey,

1891
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:33,370
the guy with an ounce of weed or the guy
what you know,

1892
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,213
even with four ounces of weed,
why are we dumping him in with all this 

1893
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,164
stuff that's just going to muddy the 
waters more about the real target that 

1894
01:13:41,781 --> 01:13:42,614
we're really going after,
which is someone that's actually going 

1895
01:13:43,521 --> 01:13:44,354
to hurt someone or someone that's 
actually going to cause a terrorist 

1896
01:13:45,651 --> 01:13:47,150
incident.
To me,

1897
01:13:47,151 --> 01:13:47,901
I would,
if I were them,

1898
01:13:47,901 --> 01:13:49,010
I'd be like,
we need less.

1899
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:49,873
We need way more targeted data.
We need to leave 325 million people 

1900
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:55,160
alone,
probably

1901
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:55,993
pay the least,
and here's another big part of the 

1902
01:13:57,641 --> 01:13:58,474
problem was that when Obama was 
instituting these changes and when the 

1903
01:14:01,661 --> 01:14:04,240
NDA got passed and when people were 
saying,

1904
01:14:04,241 --> 01:14:04,870
well,
hey,

1905
01:14:04,870 --> 01:14:05,703
we're never going to use it.
This is one of the things that they 

1906
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:09,400
said,
we're never going to hold people without

1907
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:10,234
legal representation,
and definitely they were going to use 

1908
01:14:11,591 --> 01:14:13,660
the indefinite detainment.
Okay,

1909
01:14:13,661 --> 01:14:16,930
but that's you.
What if a crazy person becomes president

1910
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:20,770
cut to president trump,
we now have a crazy person,

1911
01:14:21,070 --> 01:14:22,720
crazy person who's now president,
and you're like,

1912
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:23,554
well,
now what?

1913
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:25,630
Well,
what about these fucking crazy laws,

1914
01:14:25,631 --> 01:14:26,464
Obama that you pass when he thought that
it would be nothing but your standard 

1915
01:14:28,931 --> 01:14:32,290
politicians and hopefully Democrats from
now to the end of time.

1916
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:35,350
Guess what?
Now it's not now it's a guy who wants to

1917
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,510
dismantle the environmental protection 
agency.

1918
01:14:37,511 --> 01:14:40,210
Now it's a guy wants to drill pipelines 
through.

1919
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:45,270
The Dakota access is a guy that wants to
do a lot of stuff that people find to be

1920
01:14:45,431 --> 01:14:50,320
troubling and this guy has the same 
rights to use.

1921
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:54,730
The Nda as you did and he's the new guy 
and he's kinda crazy.

1922
01:14:55,030 --> 01:14:55,331
Yeah.
And,

1923
01:14:55,331 --> 01:14:56,164
and that,
this is the level of restraint that 

1924
01:14:57,191 --> 01:14:59,740
needs to be shown by someone in that 
position because

1925
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:01,020
he hasn't done anything yet.
I mean,

1926
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:01,873
you can't say he has used it,
but he's only been an officer a couple 

1927
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:03,820
months.

1928
01:15:03,820 --> 01:15:04,653
Yeah.
Given time.

1929
01:15:04,730 --> 01:15:05,563
Uh,
but to me it's like it goes back to the 

1930
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,390
argument of a,
of a executive orders.

1931
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,020
It goes back to the argument of all of 
these things were,

1932
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:13,570
or the filibuster in the Senate,
uh,

1933
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,060
where what's good for the goose is good 
for the gander.

1934
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:16,953
You can't set up these,
these rules that are just going to 

1935
01:15:18,281 --> 01:15:20,380
backfire on you and then complain about 
them later.

1936
01:15:20,381 --> 01:15:22,060
To me,
I think it's a huge mistake.

1937
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:23,660
That's why I have a lot of respect for 
presidents.

1938
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,110
We haven't had one in a long time that 
there are more restrained.

1939
01:15:26,111 --> 01:15:26,944
The presidents at that differ executive 
power and actually say like maybe the 

1940
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:31,030
legislature should be dealing with these
kinds of things.

1941
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:33,130
We need a man like that or someone like 
that.

1942
01:15:33,220 --> 01:15:34,031
Who's ever done that?
Oh,

1943
01:15:34,031 --> 01:15:34,571
I mean,
back in the,

1944
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:37,600
I mean it's been a lot of time,
the gilded age of coolidge and heart and

1945
01:15:37,601 --> 01:15:38,434
those guys,
but ever since FDR really the imperial 

1946
01:15:39,941 --> 01:15:42,100
presidency grew in power and all these 
kinds of things.

1947
01:15:42,100 --> 01:15:42,933
And before you knew it,
you had a little canaries in the coal 

1948
01:15:45,131 --> 01:15:45,964
mine with like,
I was actually talking to dave about it 

1949
01:15:46,841 --> 01:15:47,674
last night with Eisenhower with the 
military industrial complex and all 

1950
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:50,980
these kinds of amazing,
wasn't it?

1951
01:15:50,981 --> 01:15:51,814
Yeah,
like an amazing,

1952
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:52,953
really.
I don't think people realize how insane 

1953
01:15:54,221 --> 01:15:55,054
that is that,
that man said that will explain what he 

1954
01:15:57,581 --> 01:15:59,380
said and when he said it.
So,

1955
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,313
uh,
Eisenhower was president from a 52 to 

1956
01:16:02,831 --> 01:16:04,240
60,
so we'll typically 50,

1957
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,093
30,
61.

1958
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:09,220
And uh,
he was obviously one of the instrumental

1959
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:12,170
generals in the allied assaults on Japan
and on,

1960
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:17,230
on Nazi Germany.
And he saw the influence of the military

1961
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:21,130
growing and that in the Cold War and the
Nixon era of the Cold War,

1962
01:16:21,131 --> 01:16:21,964
that we were making bombs to make bombs 
that we were trying to have conflicts 

1963
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,710
with Korea.
Which you tried that.

1964
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:29,680
What she did end in the early fifties,
and so seeing that,

1965
01:16:30,010 --> 01:16:34,810
seeing these seeds sown that of 
perpetual war of perpetual war,

1966
01:16:34,811 --> 01:16:36,910
that the economy was actually benefiting
from Jamie,

1967
01:16:36,911 --> 01:16:37,744
pull up that speed

1968
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:38,733
because it's an amazing speech.
It would be nice for people to hear it 

1969
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:42,233
has a lot of people are not aware of the
tone and the way set it and it was when 

1970
01:16:46,151 --> 01:16:46,984
he was leaving off.

1971
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:48,940
Sorry if I'm not doing a good job of.
No,

1972
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:49,340
no,
no.

1973
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:50,560
You did a great job.
Okay.

1974
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:52,780
And so and so.
He's a man of a military background.

1975
01:16:52,781 --> 01:16:53,614
Everyone loved Eisenhower like because 
of what he did in the war and he a two 

1976
01:16:57,011 --> 01:17:00,460
term President Nixon was very popular,
but at the end he was like,

1977
01:17:00,461 --> 01:17:03,070
you gotta watch what's going on over 
here.

1978
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,780
I'm telling you,
yes,

1979
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:05,673
you can trust me.
I'm from that world and watch what's 

1980
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:08,104
happening.
It's a speech.

1981
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:10,940
Play a Jamie,
cool speech.

1982
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:14,320
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

1983
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,540
Good evening,
my fellow Americans.

1984
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:17,943
We now stand 10 years past the midpoint 
of a century that has witnessed for 

1985
01:17:22,181 --> 01:17:24,210
major wars among great nation

1986
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:32,103
until the latest of our world conflicts.
The United States had no armaments 

1987
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:37,473
industry,
American makers of ploughshares could 

1988
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:45,010
with time and that required make swords 
as well,

1989
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,010
but we can no longer risky emergency 
improvisation of national defense.

1990
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,103
We have been compelled to create a 
Permanent Armand is industry of bash 

1991
01:17:56,591 --> 01:17:59,080
proportion.
I to do this.

1992
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:04,600
Three and a half million men and women 
are directly engaged in the defense.

1993
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:05,463
Establish now this conjunction of an 
immense military establishment and a 

1994
01:18:09,581 --> 01:18:13,720
large arms industry is new in the 
American experience,

1995
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,230
but total influence,
economic,

1996
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,520
political,
even spiritual is felt in every city,

1997
01:18:21,970 --> 01:18:24,760
every state house,
every office of the federal government.

1998
01:18:25,810 --> 01:18:28,630
We recognize the imperative need for 
this development,

1999
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:33,100
yet we must not fail to comprehend it's 
grave.

2000
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:36,790
Implications are toil,
resources,

2001
01:18:36,791 --> 01:18:37,624
and livelihood are all involved.
So is the very structure of our society 

2002
01:18:42,910 --> 01:18:47,550
and the councils of government.
We must guard against the acquisition of

2003
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,384
unwarranted influence,
whether sought or unsought by the 

2004
01:18:51,421 --> 01:18:56,421
military industrial complex.
The potential for the disastrous rise of

2005
01:18:57,061 --> 01:18:57,894
misplaced power exists and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this 

2006
01:19:03,081 --> 01:19:06,710
combination endanger our liberties or 
democratic processes.

2007
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,900
We should take nothing for granted.

2008
01:19:10,250 --> 01:19:11,083
Only an alert and knowledgeable citizen 
can compel the proper meshing of the 

2009
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:21,251
huge industrial and military machinery 
of defense with our peaceful methods and

2010
01:19:21,441 --> 01:19:26,030
goals so that security and liberty may 
prosper together.

2011
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:28,690
Jesus.
It's an amazing.

2012
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,153
At the time that was an amazing speech 
and it's just prescient like it's 

2013
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:34,810
because people don't understand and you 
know,

2014
01:19:34,840 --> 01:19:36,840
like before World War II,
you know,

2015
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:41,020
we weren't a built up under a 
militarized society.

2016
01:19:41,021 --> 01:19:42,670
We would militarize when we need it to 
and,

2017
01:19:42,671 --> 01:19:43,504
and it was really Teddy Roosevelt and 
all those kinds of guys that started to 

2018
01:19:46,001 --> 01:19:46,834
kind of get a little more bullish and 
that kind of regard with the Spanish 

2019
01:19:49,810 --> 01:19:51,370
American war and,
and the USS Maine and,

2020
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,150
and that,
you know,

2021
01:19:52,150 --> 01:19:53,800
but the fight over world war one was 
real.

2022
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:55,360
You know,
we didn't want to get involved.

2023
01:19:55,361 --> 01:19:58,360
We got involved very late and people 
take for granted.

2024
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:01,060
Now that we have just massive military 
and we have this massive power,

2025
01:20:01,061 --> 01:20:03,110
but then in the 19th century that not 
that they're,

2026
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,110
you know,
you can't equate them necessarily to the

2027
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:06,730
21st century.
We didn't,

2028
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:07,593
we weren't going around running rough 
shot over people and like doing those 

2029
01:20:09,361 --> 01:20:11,100
kinds of things.
We were very isolationist.

2030
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:11,934
That was kind of the American tradition 
and to hear that come out of 

2031
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:15,744
Eisenhower's mouth,
especially knowing his experiences in 

2032
01:20:17,581 --> 01:20:21,180
the war and his and his deep knowledge 
of the military and what was going on in

2033
01:20:21,181 --> 01:20:23,940
the world.
So it's one of the great warnings of all

2034
01:20:23,941 --> 01:20:25,120
time in American history

2035
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:26,063
and it's very wise in his part because 
he recognized that there is survival 

2036
01:20:28,501 --> 01:20:33,501
systems that are a part of any industry.
You know,

2037
01:20:33,950 --> 01:20:34,783
it's a,
there's survival mechanisms that the 

2038
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:37,073
industry wants to stay alive.
If all of a sudden there's peace on 

2039
01:20:38,791 --> 01:20:41,040
earth.
This gigantic industry,

2040
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:43,320
this multiple billion dollar a year 
industry.

2041
01:20:43,321 --> 01:20:44,280
I mean,
I don't know how much.

2042
01:20:44,410 --> 01:20:45,810
It's trillions a year,
right?

2043
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,700
What is the,
what's the military budget?

2044
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:50,400
Pretty $600,000,000,000 a year.
$600,

2045
01:20:50,401 --> 01:20:52,720
million dollars of new spending.
So you know,

2046
01:20:52,721 --> 01:20:54,330
you have trillions of dollars worth of 
equipment,

2047
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:58,410
Jesus Christ,
so that massive amount of money,

2048
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:01,350
um,
there's so many people that are involved

2049
01:21:01,351 --> 01:21:02,184
in that and so many jobs that have to be
preserved and so much of the industry 

2050
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:08,340
relies on keeping conflict,
active,

2051
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:09,393
uh,
active.

2052
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:11,790
And I think that's what he was trying to
warn us about,

2053
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:15,510
but it's so interesting about it and 
evolve citizenry and that people need to

2054
01:21:15,511 --> 01:21:17,310
be aware of it.
And to hear that from the president,

2055
01:21:17,311 --> 01:21:18,144
you're never going to hear anything 
remotely as even close to his candidate 

2056
01:21:21,270 --> 01:21:22,170
is that is today?

2057
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,350
No,
absolutely not.

2058
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:26,800
And I think that even hearing that from 
a,

2059
01:21:27,010 --> 01:21:28,530
you know,
just to reiterate like hearing that from

2060
01:21:28,570 --> 01:21:30,550
Barack Obama for instance,
would be strong,

2061
01:21:30,551 --> 01:21:31,384
right?
But hearing that from a ulysses s grant 

2062
01:21:32,681 --> 01:21:33,514
or Zachary Taylor or a guy that served 
especially the level he served as like 

2063
01:21:36,941 --> 01:21:40,030
that,
that meant something to people and it,

2064
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:40,913
and,
and I think that that's why that saying 

2065
01:21:41,681 --> 01:21:42,514
never went away,
but,

2066
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:43,393
but under our noses it happened and what
he said was going to happen is exactly 

2067
01:21:46,631 --> 01:21:50,650
what happened in the Southeast Asia,
in Vietnam,

2068
01:21:50,651 --> 01:21:51,484
Cambodia,
Laos,

2069
01:21:51,550 --> 01:21:53,950
he,
he called it from a fucking mile away.

2070
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:54,873
Well,
it wasn't even a mile away because he 

2071
01:21:55,511 --> 01:21:56,680
was living there.
I mean,

2072
01:21:56,681 --> 01:21:59,500
he was in the heat of it in 1960 when he
made that speech.

2073
01:21:59,501 --> 01:22:01,120
You think about the Gulf of Tonkin 
incident.

2074
01:22:01,121 --> 01:22:03,910
I mean that's just a few years later,
still few years later,

2075
01:22:03,911 --> 01:22:04,744
they had a false flag that allowed 
people to get enthusiastic about 

2076
01:22:08,231 --> 01:22:10,570
entering into the Vietnam War.
And that's where it all came from.

2077
01:22:10,650 --> 01:22:11,850
Right.
And it's the same,

2078
01:22:11,851 --> 01:22:12,684
you know,
some people say the USS Maine and 

2079
01:22:13,351 --> 01:22:14,184
Spanish American war in 18,
98 was another false flag or something 

2080
01:22:15,721 --> 01:22:16,554
that was,
they let happen or something that was 

2081
01:22:17,671 --> 01:22:18,980
blown out of proportion,
you know,

2082
01:22:18,990 --> 01:22:21,150
pardon the pun,
because it was about shit blowing up.

2083
01:22:21,330 --> 01:22:22,560
But yeah,
it's one of those,

2084
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:24,810
it is a provocation that gets everyone 
involved.

2085
01:22:24,811 --> 01:22:26,160
And they had,
we had this nemesis.

2086
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:28,140
It was good versus evil.
We were upset when we saw,

2087
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:29,003
I think especially against the Nazis,
we saw what the stature of the good 

2088
01:22:32,311 --> 01:22:35,310
versus evil argument and we won.
So with the allies.

2089
01:22:35,311 --> 01:22:36,144
So we,
I think we tried to perpetuate that 

2090
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:37,943
immediately.
The Soviets became the evil and then we 

2091
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:42,380
created our bombs and then they created 
their bombs and then we just had this,

2092
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,540
these proxy wars that we were fighting 
against the Chinese and Korea.

2093
01:22:45,541 --> 01:22:48,480
And then the Soviets in Vietnam really 
like all these things that were kind of,

2094
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,140
you know,
everyone knew what was going on.

2095
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:53,520
But no,
I'm sorry.

2096
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:54,560
No,
please go on.

2097
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,010
Just you.
I was just gonna say.

2098
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:59,460
So I think that when the Soviet,
when everything started to get peaceful,

2099
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:01,770
I wonder,
they call it glasnost and Soviet,

2100
01:23:01,890 --> 01:23:04,710
Soviet,
which is like the idea of a new era like

2101
01:23:04,711 --> 01:23:07,720
peace and prosperity with the West or 
whatever in like the late seventies,

2102
01:23:07,721 --> 01:23:09,270
early eighties,
I think that the,

2103
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,680
the,
the Boeings of the world and the,

2104
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:13,090
and the Halliburtons of the world were 
like,

2105
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,680
Oh shit,
you know,

2106
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:15,401
and,
and,

2107
01:23:15,401 --> 01:23:17,300
uh,
become nineties,

2108
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:21,850
but we immediately found new targets and
we should be wary of why that happened.

2109
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:22,733
You know,
I'm not saying that we shouldn't 

2110
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:24,790
necessarily fight,
we have to fight sometimes,

2111
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:27,250
but to have this industrialized nature 
of it,

2112
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:30,550
to have this need to lurch from one war 
to the next quarter,

2113
01:23:30,551 --> 01:23:33,250
the next quarter,
the next war is not what a,

2114
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:35,680
a thriving republic does.
It's what a dying empire does.

2115
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,140
Well,
it's definitely

2116
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:38,003
what an empire that's dependent upon the
control or the or rather an industry 

2117
01:23:42,421 --> 01:23:43,254
rather than.
It's dependent upon the control that it 

2118
01:23:44,341 --> 01:23:47,460
has currently maintaining it.
You need to maintain that,

2119
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:50,400
that money.
You need to maintain the business.

2120
01:23:50,401 --> 01:23:54,420
The business of making these machines 
and of having these contracts,

2121
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:59,490
I mean it's a huge industry and like all
of these unlimited growth industries,

2122
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:04,410
it's very like every business 
essentially operates under this paradigm

2123
01:24:04,411 --> 01:24:06,270
of unlimited growth or most businesses 
do.

2124
01:24:06,271 --> 01:24:07,104
Most corporations do where they kind of 
every year they want to make more money 

2125
01:24:09,450 --> 01:24:10,283
and if that's applicable to accompany 
that makes tanks well every year they 

2126
01:24:15,601 --> 01:24:17,130
want to make more money.
They want to make more tanks.

2127
01:24:17,131 --> 01:24:19,500
We don't need tanks anymore.
Well how the fuck you don't.

2128
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:20,633
You definitely need to.
Oh look what's going on over here in 

2129
01:24:21,541 --> 01:24:22,380
Yemen.
Real Shit.

2130
01:24:22,381 --> 01:24:23,400
You need some tanks,
right?

2131
01:24:23,401 --> 01:24:25,620
Exactly.
And that's means team America,

2132
01:24:25,621 --> 01:24:26,460
world police.
It's,

2133
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:27,510
it's really crazy.

2134
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:31,360
It's scary and it's a scary waste of 
money too because I don't think that we.

2135
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:34,420
I really do feel like we should have the
most powerful military in the world.

2136
01:24:34,421 --> 01:24:35,680
I don't think that there's anything 
wrong with that.

2137
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:37,870
I think you're right.
I think a powerful Republican have those

2138
01:24:37,871 --> 01:24:38,704
kinds of things,
but we don't need all of these bases 

2139
01:24:39,701 --> 01:24:41,560
that are legacy basis.
Why are we still in Japan?

2140
01:24:41,561 --> 01:24:42,394
Why are we still in place?
They talk some shit and or Godzilla 

2141
01:24:44,771 --> 01:24:45,470
shows up.

2142
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:46,303
Trump's proposed height to military 
spending is bigger than all but two 

2143
01:24:48,561 --> 01:24:50,000
countries.
Entire budgets.

2144
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,520
Well that's because we're America and 
we're better than everybody else.

2145
01:24:52,610 --> 01:24:53,361
Yeah,
I want to say it.

2146
01:24:53,361 --> 01:24:55,610
That communists shit off my screen.
I want to say,

2147
01:24:55,670 --> 01:24:59,450
I mean this is incredible.
I want to say I think this is right that

2148
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:02,630
if you split the military spending of 
the world in thirds,

2149
01:25:03,110 --> 01:25:05,030
we've.
We are responsible for a third of it.

2150
01:25:05,450 --> 01:25:06,283
10 countries are responsible for another
third of it and then everyone else is 

2151
01:25:08,991 --> 01:25:09,824
responsible for another third of it.
We have four and a half percent of the 

2152
01:25:12,111 --> 01:25:12,944
world's population,
so this is way out of whack when with 

2153
01:25:15,820 --> 01:25:16,653
with even our needs,
like our actual very need to protect 

2154
01:25:19,191 --> 01:25:20,600
ourselves.
I think it's just way out of whack.

2155
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:21,100
Right?

2156
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:25,810
But when you get past those 10 countries
that there are other third and then us,

2157
01:25:25,811 --> 01:25:26,644
that's 11 countries.
Everybody else is using coconuts and 

2158
01:25:28,421 --> 01:25:29,254
catapults.

2159
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:31,980
That's essentially throwing rocks at 
each other.

2160
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,140
So.
But there's relative tranquility,

2161
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:38,790
like outside of the Middle East and in 
East Eastern Europe with the Ukraine and

2162
01:25:38,791 --> 01:25:42,770
Russia,
there's general peace to be had in,

2163
01:25:42,771 --> 01:25:43,604
in these countries that might not spend 
a lot of money or might not even have a 

2164
01:25:45,031 --> 01:25:45,864
lot of money to spend them on saying I 
want to live like they do with that I 

2165
01:25:47,341 --> 01:25:48,060
want,
I don't want to spend,

2166
01:25:48,060 --> 01:25:49,410
say I want to live like they do in Sri 
Lanka,

2167
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,820
Bangladesh or something like that.
But I'm saying like,

2168
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,140
man,
you racist.

2169
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:54,840
That's already been established by the 
International Business Times.

2170
01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:56,550
Uh,
but to me,

2171
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:57,870
I just look at it.
I'm like,

2172
01:25:57,871 --> 01:25:59,600
we can spend this money wiser and we can
have,

2173
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,710
we can,
we can ramp up and have plans to ramp up

2174
01:26:01,711 --> 01:26:02,940
people forget.
And you know,

2175
01:26:03,770 --> 01:26:04,603
Gm Ford,
all these guys were making our 

2176
01:26:05,871 --> 01:26:06,920
armaments.
You know,

2177
01:26:06,921 --> 01:26:09,920
Mitsubishi made the Japanese Zeroes,
IBM offshoots of IBM.

2178
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,350
We're making frigging punch card 
machines for the Nazis.

2179
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:13,730
You know,
like people,

2180
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,481
people,
you know,

2181
01:26:14,481 --> 01:26:15,314
for better or for worse,
ramp up and do what they need to do in 

2182
01:26:17,031 --> 01:26:17,864
times of war to make money.
And so we could have a plan in place to 

2183
01:26:19,851 --> 01:26:20,241
say like,
Hey,

2184
01:26:20,241 --> 01:26:22,670
if we need to ramp up,
it's something bad happens if we need to

2185
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:23,504
go overseas or something,
if we have to go engage the Russians 

2186
01:26:25,371 --> 01:26:27,830
because they're rolling into the rest of
Ukraine for instance,

2187
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:29,960
we have the uh,
the we can,

2188
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:32,780
we can take care of that without having 
bases all over the world.

2189
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:33,673
Well,
the problem with that kind of thinking 

2190
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,740
is as soon as you say that,
then they realize,

2191
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:39,080
wow,
there's a lot of money to be had if that

2192
01:26:39,110 --> 01:26:41,450
is the case.
So let's make that the case.

2193
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:45,740
And then there's some weird fucking 
covert sneaky shit going down.

2194
01:26:45,740 --> 01:26:48,660
And do you have an earring on both ears?
They,

2195
01:26:49,140 --> 01:26:51,170
the other headphones.
Irritating.

2196
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,013
You don't know.
I just like to hear whenever I did I do 

2197
01:26:53,421 --> 01:26:55,070
this.
Not all the hearings had been in since I

2198
01:26:55,071 --> 01:26:57,070
was like 18.
I just took them out.

2199
01:26:57,071 --> 01:26:59,870
I'm superstitious.
So you're superstitious.

2200
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:00,920
Yeah.
So I don't like to,

2201
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,080
you know,
not like over overtly superstitious,

2202
01:27:03,081 --> 01:27:05,450
but I'm afraid to take them out.
I'm afraid to do different things.

2203
01:27:05,451 --> 01:27:07,190
You have a,
we the people tattoo on your arm?

2204
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:07,491
Yeah,
we,

2205
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:10,860
the people and then I have franklins 
association snake on here.

2206
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,920
So you're like join or die.
Wow.

2207
01:27:13,040 --> 01:27:13,873
So you're like a serious,
almost like a fan of politics that way 

2208
01:27:18,990 --> 01:27:20,030
to describe it.
Sure.

2209
01:27:20,031 --> 01:27:20,864
I meant when I went to college,
I went to school for American history 

2210
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:25,550
and I graduated and when I got my job 
offer in the video game industry,

2211
01:27:25,551 --> 01:27:26,384
I was about to start my graduate degree 
at northeastern in American history 

2212
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,710
because I want it to be a professor at 
the time.

2213
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:34,070
So my real passion was American history 
in American politics,

2214
01:27:34,071 --> 01:27:36,170
but I veered off into a different 
direction.

2215
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,340
No,
please go ahead.

2216
01:27:38,410 --> 01:27:39,740
I was just saying,
so these are like relics,

2217
01:27:39,741 --> 01:27:42,190
so I got these when I was like 20,
you know.

2218
01:27:42,230 --> 01:27:43,310
Wow,
that's interesting man.

2219
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:44,153
That's a,
those are unusual tattoos for 20 year 

2220
01:27:45,231 --> 01:27:45,870
old.
Yeah.

2221
01:27:45,870 --> 01:27:46,880
I,
I just,

2222
01:27:46,881 --> 01:27:47,290
you know,
I,

2223
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:48,270
I love,
uh,

2224
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,510
I'm really interested in the founding 
generation.

2225
01:27:50,511 --> 01:27:52,310
I'm really interested in,
in their experiences.

2226
01:27:52,311 --> 01:27:56,390
And the American revolution I think is a
fascinating revolution compared to a lot

2227
01:27:56,391 --> 01:27:58,250
of other revolutions.
Primarily because it is,

2228
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:00,590
I think it inherently in some ways,
conservative revolution,

2229
01:28:00,591 --> 01:28:01,424
which is not common.
These were incredibly rich people 

2230
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:04,483
fighting.
These weren't like poor destitute 

2231
01:28:06,081 --> 01:28:08,690
people.
John Hancock had something like 350th of

2232
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:10,850
all of the value of the colonies under 
is under his name.

2233
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:13,070
People had everything,
the risk and everything to lose,

2234
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:15,500
so it's like an interesting,
I think,

2235
01:28:15,501 --> 01:28:16,850
very principled revolution that they 
fought.

2236
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:17,683
Although if you read like Howard Zinn or
something that they would say that they 

2237
01:28:18,981 --> 01:28:21,590
did it to protect their money,
but I'm sure they did,

2238
01:28:21,591 --> 01:28:23,690
but I'm sure they had other motives as 
well.

2239
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:25,610
Of course,
and it's a.

2240
01:28:26,060 --> 01:28:28,640
it's a sort of an unprecedented thing in
human history.

2241
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:29,593
I mean it's a really crazy union that 
we've established over here to see all 

2242
01:28:34,041 --> 01:28:37,760
of these things that threaten what we 
find so amazing about it.

2243
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:40,310
Like the violations of the fourth 
amendment,

2244
01:28:40,340 --> 01:28:41,173
all the NSA stuff with Edward Snowden,
all these different things that we see 

2245
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:47,390
that that are huge problems.
What they are is also they're.

2246
01:28:47,391 --> 01:28:48,224
They're weakening the foundation of 
these ideas that were so amazing when 

2247
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:54,680
they were first established in 17,
76 and,

2248
01:28:54,681 --> 01:28:55,514
and uh,
to me that's why I think that they're 

2249
01:28:56,721 --> 01:28:57,554
worth protecting and it goes to,
it goes into the like is the 

2250
01:28:59,030 --> 01:29:00,260
constitution living or not?

2251
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,093
Is it,
is a strict constructionist or loose 

2252
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:03,540
constructionists.
All those kinds of questions I think are

2253
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:05,010
valid,
but to me I'm like,

2254
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:05,844
we can't,
we have this very unique vision into 

2255
01:29:08,311 --> 01:29:11,160
what the founders intended because they 
were one of the few,

2256
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:13,170
I think people,
people at that time that were like,

2257
01:29:13,171 --> 01:29:14,190
we're going to,
you know,

2258
01:29:14,191 --> 01:29:16,620
the federalist papers are incredible if 
you read them,

2259
01:29:16,621 --> 01:29:18,600
like we don't have to wonder what they 
meant.

2260
01:29:18,930 --> 01:29:21,180
They literally tell you exactly what 
they meant.

2261
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,730
So when you go to supreme court cases,
I don't know that there are many supreme

2262
01:29:23,731 --> 01:29:26,010
court cases that don't even reference 
the federalist papers because it's like,

2263
01:29:26,011 --> 01:29:28,050
well they said this an article three,
section two,

2264
01:29:28,051 --> 01:29:31,830
but actually in this paper that they 
wrote anonymously that we know Alexander

2265
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:33,870
Hamilton wrote,
here's what he said about it.

2266
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:35,940
You know.
And I think that's interesting stuff.

2267
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:37,043
Now,
how did this knowledge of politics and 

2268
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:42,510
how this fascination that you have with 
the history of the United States,

2269
01:29:42,810 --> 01:29:45,270
how did this get you in,
you know,

2270
01:29:45,271 --> 01:29:46,104
quote unquote trouble in the video game 
industry with these people that are 

2271
01:29:49,141 --> 01:29:52,710
predominantly left wing and 
predominantly progressive?

2272
01:29:52,730 --> 01:29:54,090
Like quota?
I say progressive,

2273
01:29:54,091 --> 01:29:56,040
but progressive is kind of a dirty word 
now,

2274
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:58,280
but it's coming.
There's a difference between liberal and

2275
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,123
progressive.
Well,

2276
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,770
it would be great if everybody was 
liberal.

2277
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:02,633
If it would be great if everybody was 
progressive and it'd be great if 

2278
01:30:04,681 --> 01:30:05,514
everybody wanted people to have freedom 
of choice and freedom to be whoever you 

2279
01:30:10,141 --> 01:30:10,974
want,
but that's not really what those things 

2280
01:30:12,031 --> 01:30:14,460
are anymore.
Those things are like ideologies.

2281
01:30:14,461 --> 01:30:15,294
There are these predetermined patterns 
of behavior that people subscribe to in 

2282
01:30:17,631 --> 01:30:19,350
a very,
very rigid way.

2283
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:20,873
How,
what did you find was an issue when 

2284
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:25,103
people found out about your extreme 
understanding and a respect for the 

2285
01:30:31,081 --> 01:30:31,920
history of the United States?

2286
01:30:32,020 --> 01:30:32,950
Well,
they think it's a.

2287
01:30:33,070 --> 01:30:36,160
primarily they think it was kind of a 
joke because not not,

2288
01:30:36,161 --> 01:30:37,330
not a hot hydro,
but like you're,

2289
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,070
you're a clown kind of.
Because why?

2290
01:30:39,340 --> 01:30:41,470
Because I believe in small government,
for instance,

2291
01:30:41,471 --> 01:30:42,304
I believe in low taxation,
I believe in the elimination of the 

2292
01:30:43,691 --> 01:30:44,920
income tax and things like this.
These are,

2293
01:30:44,950 --> 01:30:46,660
these are Rad,
but I don't actually have like,

2294
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:49,210
not all my ideas are radical or even 
outside of the mainstream.

2295
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:50,283
Socially.
I'm probably further to the left that 

2296
01:30:51,521 --> 01:30:52,420
many of these people,
you know,

2297
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:55,570
uh,
I think that it goes back to this idea,

2298
01:30:55,660 --> 01:30:57,640
and this is something Dave Rubin has 
touched on a lot in this show,

2299
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:58,623
which I'm sure you're familiar with,
which is this idea that it's really all 

2300
01:31:01,031 --> 01:31:01,864
or nothing,
like they don't want to be an ally with 

2301
01:31:03,551 --> 01:31:05,050
someone that might be able to help them 
in x,

2302
01:31:05,051 --> 01:31:07,020
Y,
and Z if they disagree with people in a,

2303
01:31:07,021 --> 01:31:07,750
B and c.

2304
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,430
So they could have had a great ally in 
me and being like,

2305
01:31:09,431 --> 01:31:11,980
I've been pro gay marriage forever.
I've been pro choice.

2306
01:31:12,010 --> 01:31:12,910
Uh,
you know,

2307
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:13,920
uh,
um,

2308
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:14,763
for the decriminalization of drugs,
I'm for the legalization of 

2309
01:31:16,751 --> 01:31:17,584
prostitution.
I'm for a lot of these things that are 

2310
01:31:18,431 --> 01:31:19,264
very far to the left socially that we 
probably could find some agreement on 

2311
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:22,324
somewhere.
And we can work on those things and get 

2312
01:31:23,141 --> 01:31:25,660
those things done together.
But because I say also like,

2313
01:31:25,661 --> 01:31:26,494
Hey,
the income tax is predatory and really 

2314
01:31:28,721 --> 01:31:29,800
hurts people.
I own a business.

2315
01:31:29,801 --> 01:31:31,810
I owned a business and I went,
I guess I want another one now.

2316
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:32,973
And I know that I could have hired 
another person if taxes weren't so 

2317
01:31:35,111 --> 01:31:36,610
onerous on me.
Um,

2318
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:38,760
and so I also stand on there and they,
they,

2319
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:40,480
they're like,
this never happened.

2320
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:42,070
This stuff that you just said never 
happened.

2321
01:31:42,071 --> 01:31:43,660
This left this left wing stuff that we 
agree on.

2322
01:31:43,661 --> 01:31:44,494
Never happened because you don't believe
in because you have this one thing that 

2323
01:31:46,811 --> 01:31:47,644
we have a problem with

2324
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:50,000
about it.
But you're not being clear about that.

2325
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:50,480
Like,
what,

2326
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:52,130
what is the issue?
Um,

2327
01:31:52,131 --> 01:31:54,950
I wanted it comes to small government,
like you wanting small government.

2328
01:31:54,951 --> 01:31:56,990
What's the opposition to that?
What do they say?

2329
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,250
Well,
they say like a,

2330
01:31:58,290 --> 01:31:59,123
they make a of it's insinuations because
a lot of it isn't even things that I 

2331
01:32:00,941 --> 01:32:03,130
feel or believe.
So an example would be,

2332
01:32:03,131 --> 01:32:04,270
um,
you know,

2333
01:32:04,900 --> 01:32:07,600
I see a lot of people say all the time,
like a column doesn't believe in welfare

2334
01:32:07,750 --> 01:32:09,820
or column doesn't believe in,
in social security.

2335
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,560
I'm like,
I never said that actually.

2336
01:32:11,561 --> 01:32:12,394
I just,
I believe that these things should be 

2337
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:18,070
reformed and maybe take it back a step.
But they even look at that as a push too

2338
01:32:18,071 --> 01:32:19,390
far on the,
on the system.

2339
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,373
I guess what I'm trying to say to you,
and I'm sorry I'm not being more lucid 

2340
01:32:21,701 --> 01:32:23,740
with you,
I'm trying my hardest is,

2341
01:32:23,800 --> 01:32:25,030
is that they're,
they,

2342
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:30,600
you have to agree with them lockstep.
If they see you in one way that is,

2343
01:32:30,740 --> 01:32:31,573
that is,
is injurious to their cars or two that 

2344
01:32:33,271 --> 01:32:35,400
is conflicting or contrary to what they 
believe.

2345
01:32:35,700 --> 01:32:38,460
They do not give a fuck about anything 
else you believe.

2346
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:40,620
And that's the thing that always 
frustrated me and what so surprising you

2347
01:32:40,621 --> 01:32:41,454
with them.
The people were really were running me 

2348
01:32:41,821 --> 01:32:43,830
out on a rail out of the gaming industry
with the,

2349
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:44,693
with a completely innocuous joke,
which I think tells you everything you 

2350
01:32:46,711 --> 01:32:50,420
need to know about the the intent that 
they don't see.

2351
01:32:50,460 --> 01:32:52,140
They don't want allies in different 
ways.

2352
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,780
Allies in different close allies and 
that they want just.

2353
01:32:54,810 --> 01:32:57,100
They just want complete,
you know,

2354
01:32:57,300 --> 01:32:59,850
it's very orwellian.
They just want you to be completely like

2355
01:32:59,851 --> 01:33:00,684
them and if you're not like then they 
don't want anything to do with you and 

2356
01:33:02,701 --> 01:33:04,860
it's these and it's not even like I was 
advocating for anything crazy.

2357
01:33:04,861 --> 01:33:06,900
I don't advocate for anything crazy.
I don't think

2358
01:33:07,270 --> 01:33:08,103
that doesn't sound crazy at all.
But what's interesting is we've kind of 

2359
01:33:11,950 --> 01:33:12,783
turned a corner where in many ways the 
right is more tolerant than the left to 

2360
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:17,554
variations in their ideology.
Whereas the right is much more tolerant 

2361
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:21,964
to people that support gay marriage.
The right is much more tolerant to 

2362
01:33:24,131 --> 01:33:25,480
people.
That,

2363
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:27,640
I mean this is.
You fill in the blanks.

2364
01:33:27,641 --> 01:33:28,474
There's a bunch of different rights that
the right would sort of accept from 

2365
01:33:32,831 --> 01:33:36,480
someone who also voted Republican,
but the left isn't like if,

2366
01:33:36,481 --> 01:33:37,314
if you got to the point where like I got
into a heated argument with someone 

2367
01:33:40,361 --> 01:33:42,910
wants about abortion,
which I'm pro choice,

2368
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:45,490
but what I was saying,
well essentially,

2369
01:33:45,491 --> 01:33:46,324
but obviously it was a criticism of 
Richard Dawkins quote where he's 

2370
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:53,550
comparing a human embryo to a,
a pig fetus or a pig embryo.

2371
01:33:54,400 --> 01:33:55,930
I forget what the terms of use,
but I'm like,

2372
01:33:55,931 --> 01:33:56,764
well that's ridiculous because one of 
them is going to become a person if you 

2373
01:33:58,871 --> 01:34:00,320
don't take it out of your body.

2374
01:34:00,370 --> 01:34:03,190
And that was the idea behind it.
Like you can't,

2375
01:34:03,610 --> 01:34:06,850
you can't use that sort of an analogy 
because it's not true.

2376
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:07,743
I mean it's just one has the potential 
for being a person and I was being 

2377
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:12,850
accused by this guy of being right wing 
because of it.

2378
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:13,631
And I was like,
well,

2379
01:34:13,631 --> 01:34:15,910
I'm not right wing.
I'm just talking about the potential for

2380
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:16,744
life.
Like a pig embryo is never going to be 

2381
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:21,190
my neighbor Mike.
It's just not.

2382
01:34:21,250 --> 01:34:23,290
You know what I mean?
But that baby,

2383
01:34:23,291 --> 01:34:24,124
I'm not saying you should be forced to 
make that baby a person and keep it in 

2384
01:34:26,941 --> 01:34:31,720
your body when it's a few cells and then
two weeks old and then sit you.

2385
01:34:31,721 --> 01:34:36,130
I'm not saying that you can't choose 
when to terminate your pregnancy,

2386
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:38,530
but what I'm saying is you're 
terminating a pregnancy.

2387
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:39,663
We both know what you're doing.
I'm not saying you shouldn't be able to 

2388
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:42,184
do it,
but to pretend that it's not messy and 

2389
01:34:43,241 --> 01:34:45,010
nobody wants it to be messy.

2390
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:48,010
Nobody wants to be a complicated issue.
They wanted to be cut and dry.

2391
01:34:48,011 --> 01:34:50,860
If you're on the left in particular,
it's pro choice,

2392
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:51,873
a woman's reproductive choice,
freedom of your body to do what you 

2393
01:34:55,271 --> 01:34:56,560
want.
I get all that.

2394
01:34:56,561 --> 01:34:58,550
I'm 100 percent with you,
but let's.

2395
01:34:58,670 --> 01:35:01,550
Let's not lie about what it is because 
as soon as we know,

2396
01:35:01,850 --> 01:35:04,580
as soon as we distort the reality of 
what the thing is,

2397
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:06,043
then we put up these ideological 
boundaries and blinders and we make 

2398
01:35:09,171 --> 01:35:10,004
communication very difficult and we make
these rigid ideologies almost like a 

2399
01:35:13,581 --> 01:35:16,130
religion.
They are almost like dogma.

2400
01:35:16,340 --> 01:35:17,600
And when you do it,
put it.

2401
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,680
I mean,
when you do that,

2402
01:35:18,681 --> 01:35:21,140
you have real problems because people 
can't communicate,

2403
01:35:21,141 --> 01:35:23,270
so if someone does bring that up and 
say,

2404
01:35:23,271 --> 01:35:24,300
well,
you know,

2405
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:28,430
what is abortion?
And then silence across the dinner table

2406
01:35:28,431 --> 01:35:30,280
you hear people dropping their forks and
like,

2407
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:31,010
what is abortion?

2408
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:34,970
What are you doing?
You're at what age is it okay to have an

2409
01:35:34,971 --> 01:35:36,140
abortion?
At what age is it?

2410
01:35:36,141 --> 01:35:36,531
Not.
Okay.

2411
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:39,440
Is it okay to abort a baby a day before 
it's born?

2412
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:40,210
No.
No.

2413
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,870
Okay.
So a but a month before?

2414
01:35:42,110 --> 01:35:43,580
No.
How about two months before?

2415
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:44,600
No.
How about three?

2416
01:35:44,750 --> 01:35:46,100
How about four?
How about five?

2417
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:47,540
How about six?
How about seven?

2418
01:35:47,630 --> 01:35:48,650
Where do we.
You know what I'm saying?

2419
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:49,843
Where do we get to the point where it's 
not a baby and I think that's a viable 

2420
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:57,200
conversation and it's a real.
It's a very uncomfortable discussion.

2421
01:35:57,530 --> 01:35:59,420
As soon as you like me saying it right 
now,

2422
01:35:59,421 --> 01:36:01,730
there's people listening to this right 
now that are in their car.

2423
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:04,670
Maybe there's a woman listening to this.
It's had an abortion and she's like,

2424
01:36:04,671 --> 01:36:06,410
I don't want to hear this,
and she wants to shut it off.

2425
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:07,393
Maybe there's a guy who's trying to 
pressure his wife or girlfriend into 

2426
01:36:10,701 --> 01:36:12,440
having an abortion and he doesn't want 
to hear it,

2427
01:36:12,680 --> 01:36:14,690
but what is it?
What is abortion?

2428
01:36:14,750 --> 01:36:15,360
What is it?

2429
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:15,721
Right?
It's,

2430
01:36:15,721 --> 01:36:16,350
it's,
it's,

2431
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,030
and this is what I always call it the,
this,

2432
01:36:18,031 --> 01:36:20,390
this issue,
to me particularly joe is a 60 40 issue.

2433
01:36:20,391 --> 01:36:22,380
What I always say is like,
I am pro choice,

2434
01:36:22,890 --> 01:36:23,723
but I respect the prolife argument and I
don't think you should just have 

2435
01:36:25,771 --> 01:36:27,990
unfettered access to abortions forever.
You know,

2436
01:36:27,991 --> 01:36:28,500
like,
like,

2437
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:29,333
you know,
yeah.

2438
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:30,780
Two months,
you know,

2439
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:31,830
something like that.
Fourteen week,

2440
01:36:31,831 --> 01:36:33,010
I don't know,
I don't know what the number would be,

2441
01:36:33,011 --> 01:36:34,760
what the number is.
Fourteen weeks to months,

2442
01:36:35,330 --> 01:36:36,091
but to me I'm like,
yeah,

2443
01:36:36,091 --> 01:36:38,550
what's happened when you make a great 
point?

2444
01:36:38,580 --> 01:36:39,413
Because it's,
it's,

2445
01:36:39,420 --> 01:36:42,480
it's,
it is this dogmatic sense of saying like

2446
01:36:42,540 --> 01:36:43,860
it.
Here's the way it is.

2447
01:36:44,220 --> 01:36:45,450
That's it.
It goes back to the,

2448
01:36:45,451 --> 01:36:46,350
you know,
I heard you talking about it.

2449
01:36:46,351 --> 01:36:48,150
I was so.
I was so glad to hear you say it because

2450
01:36:49,170 --> 01:36:51,450
it goes back to like the war on women,
right?

2451
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:54,060
Like there's just a whole group of 
people apparently in the country,

2452
01:36:54,061 --> 01:36:56,270
a hundred 50 million of them.
I hate women that,

2453
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:58,560
that because they're pro prolife for 
instance,

2454
01:36:58,561 --> 01:37:00,330
which is a stance I don't share,
but I respect.

2455
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:02,123
Why does that mean that they hate women?
Why does it mean that like why does it 

2456
01:37:03,601 --> 01:37:06,480
always go from zero to 10 for like 
immediately it's like.

2457
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:09,030
And then there's all these lies mixed in
like the um,

2458
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:09,901
uh,
the,

2459
01:37:09,901 --> 01:37:10,770
the,
the pay gap,

2460
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,680
which is a fucking lie.
Just lie.

2461
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:17,140
It's not just a lot.
It's a lot is perpetrated by Obama on TV

2462
01:37:17,170 --> 01:37:18,250
talking about it.
I mean,

2463
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:19,983
it's such a

2464
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,150
confusing lie.
It's just bizarre.

2465
01:37:22,151 --> 01:37:25,870
It is demonstrably false and it is a 
lie.

2466
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:27,520
So why do I heat here?
Keep it.

2467
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:28,533
Why does everyone want be so divisive?
Why do you want to add more fuel to the 

2468
01:37:30,191 --> 01:37:31,120
fire when you can be like,
hey,

2469
01:37:31,370 --> 01:37:32,770
maybe we have problem x,
Y,

2470
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:33,940
and Z,
but this isn't a problem.

2471
01:37:33,941 --> 01:37:35,680
Actually,
I saw it again recently.

2472
01:37:36,260 --> 01:37:37,093
It was recently in the news.
Somebody brought it up and it unchecked 

2473
01:37:39,141 --> 01:37:41,450
and unchallenged.
Just explain to people if there were,

2474
01:37:41,451 --> 01:37:42,284
because I've done it too many times,
explained to people what the real pay 

2475
01:37:44,301 --> 01:37:48,060
gap is and what the issue is when,
why it's using it incorrectly,

2476
01:37:48,270 --> 01:37:49,103
so the pay gap claimed by studies,
I guess the Department of Labor or 

2477
01:37:51,691 --> 01:37:53,580
something is twenty one cents or 
something like that.

2478
01:37:53,581 --> 01:37:54,930
So I was saying I think something like 
70,

2479
01:37:55,530 --> 01:37:57,960
every dollar a man makes a woman makes 
seventy nine cents.

2480
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:01,110
That's true.
Only if you take every man,

2481
01:38:01,230 --> 01:38:04,440
every woman take all of the money they 
make and divided by the amount of men in

2482
01:38:04,441 --> 01:38:07,670
the amount of women doesn't take into 
account a careers,

2483
01:38:07,671 --> 01:38:09,050
doesn't take into account personal 
choices.

2484
01:38:09,051 --> 01:38:11,090
Women for instance,
leave the workforce to have families.

2485
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:12,193
Sometimes men are gravitating towards 
engineering or physics or things that 

2486
01:38:16,221 --> 01:38:17,540
pay them a lot of money while women tend
to,

2487
01:38:17,720 --> 01:38:18,553
you know,
tend maybe towards psychology or 

2488
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:21,373
something like that.
I think the argument is something like 

2489
01:38:22,551 --> 01:38:23,384
nine out of the 10 top grossing career 
choices are men dominated and nine out 

2490
01:38:26,901 --> 01:38:30,620
of the 10 lowest Korea money making 
career choices are actually dominated by

2491
01:38:30,621 --> 01:38:30,890
women.

2492
01:38:30,890 --> 01:38:34,520
I think the only exception there is 
clergy which is dominated by men and so,

2493
01:38:34,580 --> 01:38:35,413
but it doesn't,
it doesn't adjust for any of these 

2494
01:38:36,441 --> 01:38:38,480
things,
so when you actually adjust for choices,

2495
01:38:38,481 --> 01:38:39,314
when you adjust for careers and 
longevity and hours and all of these 

2496
01:38:42,141 --> 01:38:42,974
things that are relevant,
the pay gap closes to something like 

2497
01:38:44,691 --> 01:38:45,524
less than five cents and then there's 
even arguments saying that those could 

2498
01:38:47,961 --> 01:38:48,794
probably be explained away completely as
well depending on what I know Christina 

2499
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:52,393
Summers and some of the.
Some of these people that know way more 

2500
01:38:52,881 --> 01:38:55,520
about this and I do have videos about if
you actually dive in,

2501
01:38:55,521 --> 01:38:57,830
you probably can get rid of the entire 
number completely,

2502
01:38:58,160 --> 01:38:58,993
but the the,
the prosperous to say that the woman 

2503
01:39:01,401 --> 01:39:02,990
makes seventy nine cents for every 
dollar

2504
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:06,440
peated ad nauseum.
The real issue is there.

2505
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:11,200
It's implying that two people working 
alongside each other at the apple store,

2506
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:12,713
the man is making $5 an hour.
The woman is making seventy nine cents 

2507
01:39:15,701 --> 01:39:17,100
an hour less.
Yeah.

2508
01:39:17,130 --> 01:39:19,810
Than seventy nine cents per dollar less.
Right?

2509
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:21,550
It's just not true.
Like significantly.

2510
01:39:21,690 --> 01:39:23,180
And I liked the argument because it's 
true.

2511
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:25,140
You know why not,
why if that was true,

2512
01:39:25,141 --> 01:39:26,390
why wouldn't a corporation just hire 
women?

2513
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:28,580
Seventy nine percent,
I should say it right?

2514
01:39:28,581 --> 01:39:30,970
Seventy nine cents to every dollar the 
manmade makes.

2515
01:39:31,180 --> 01:39:32,013
Just corporations would Holler,
hire women if they were just as 

2516
01:39:34,941 --> 01:39:36,380
competent,
just as skilled,

2517
01:39:36,381 --> 01:39:37,214
and it's not that.
It's also men are more likely to die on 

2518
01:39:39,381 --> 01:39:40,214
the job.
Men will more likely to pick way more 

2519
01:39:42,981 --> 01:39:46,350
dangerous careers like forest fighting,
forest firefighting,

2520
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,233
whether it's a coal mining,
all those things are dominated by men 

2521
01:39:49,431 --> 01:39:51,890
and a lot of people die and I'm law 
enforcement of course,

2522
01:39:52,340 --> 01:39:53,960
who's A.
There's a bunch of issues with it,

2523
01:39:53,961 --> 01:39:58,730
but the problem is it's.
It's spewed out as an indication that we

2524
01:39:58,731 --> 01:39:59,564
are an inherently sexist society and 
whether or not you can find sexism in 

2525
01:40:03,381 --> 01:40:04,214
our society,
I'm sure you can do it absolutely 

2526
01:40:05,691 --> 01:40:07,280
exists.
Just as racism exists,

2527
01:40:07,700 --> 01:40:08,533
I don't think it is nearly as much of a 
problem as they're trying to pin it out 

2528
01:40:12,261 --> 01:40:13,094
to me and I think there's a lot of other
factors involved in why men make more 

2529
01:40:15,861 --> 01:40:16,694
money and one of them may be the demand 
for a higher salary when they're being 

2530
01:40:20,901 --> 01:40:21,734
hired.
Better skills at negotiation or more 

2531
01:40:23,151 --> 01:40:23,984
confidence in those sorts of 
confrontations with employers or 

2532
01:40:26,691 --> 01:40:27,524
negotiations with employers.
I mean there's a lot of factors but it 

2533
01:40:29,661 --> 01:40:34,040
doesn't do anybody any good to repeat a 
false statistic when it's provably false

2534
01:40:34,190 --> 01:40:35,023
and then when people find out that it's 
false and then they lose confidence in 

2535
01:40:37,221 --> 01:40:38,450
the information they're being given,

2536
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:40,330
it it.
It's also.

2537
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:41,433
I think that's one half of the other 
half of it is like what does it say 

2538
01:40:43,571 --> 01:40:45,160
about a person that just continues to 
say it anyway,

2539
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:46,630
right?
Like at some point,

2540
01:40:46,631 --> 01:40:47,910
truth doesn't matter anymore.
Right?

2541
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:51,280
Like I want to have.
I want to have factual debates.

2542
01:40:51,281 --> 01:40:52,960
I want to have like this is the 
starting,

2543
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:55,990
these are objective truths and then less
debate about those things.

2544
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:57,340
Right.
But if that's your starting point,

2545
01:40:57,341 --> 01:40:58,174
if that's like a third of the entire 
reason why you're angry and in the 

2546
01:41:00,131 --> 01:41:00,964
streets in Washington DC,
well then I don't even know what you're 

2547
01:41:03,101 --> 01:41:04,840
angry about anymore to be honest.
It's the same.

2548
01:41:04,841 --> 01:41:07,360
It goes back to like occupy Wall Street 
or all these things where I'm like,

2549
01:41:07,420 --> 01:41:10,320
I don't know exactly what you're angry 
about and this is why this,

2550
01:41:10,321 --> 01:41:12,580
this protest isn't working and isn't 
resonating with.

2551
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:12,870
Yeah.

2552
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:13,703
I saw people in the march for women,
the women's march thing with signs 

2553
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:22,070
talking about the gender pay gap.
And so they had the time to make a sign.

2554
01:41:23,010 --> 01:41:23,843
They had the time to take that sign and 
nail it to some boards and carry it 

2555
01:41:27,721 --> 01:41:28,554
around.
But they didn't have time to Google 

2556
01:41:30,690 --> 01:41:32,650
whether or not that was true.
They,

2557
01:41:33,030 --> 01:41:33,863
this fascinating.

2558
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:34,733
That's also fine.
And I feel like some of them have to 

2559
01:41:36,631 --> 01:41:37,050
know,

2560
01:41:37,050 --> 01:41:38,910
right?
Some of them they don't want to know,

2561
01:41:38,911 --> 01:41:41,430
man.
It's like I've read this thing once that

2562
01:41:41,431 --> 01:41:44,790
said that a sperm cures depression in 
women.

2563
01:41:45,780 --> 01:41:46,613
And uh,
I didn't even look any further on micro 

2564
01:41:48,330 --> 01:41:49,660
got all the information I need.
This,

2565
01:41:50,030 --> 01:41:55,030
I don't want to just debunk,
I want to be rock solid in my approach,

2566
01:41:55,410 --> 01:41:57,090
shut the laptop and walked out of the 
room.

2567
01:41:57,270 --> 01:41:58,500
I mean,
that's really what's going on.

2568
01:41:58,501 --> 01:41:59,820
It's like,
that sounds great.

2569
01:41:59,821 --> 01:42:00,654
If women make seventy nine cents to 
every dollar man makes it sounds 

2570
01:42:02,401 --> 01:42:04,650
awesome.
This is a bullshit society.

2571
01:42:04,651 --> 01:42:06,150
This,
the patriarchy.

2572
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:07,261
What?
Patriarchy.

2573
01:42:07,261 --> 01:42:08,400
Patriarchy.
Patriarchy.

2574
01:42:08,401 --> 01:42:09,300
Meanwhile,
you asked them,

2575
01:42:09,360 --> 01:42:09,951
you know,
you,

2576
01:42:09,951 --> 01:42:10,940
you ask,
uh,

2577
01:42:10,941 --> 01:42:12,180
uh,
one of these feminists,

2578
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:13,750
there's a reason with feminism if,
if,

2579
01:42:13,780 --> 01:42:14,613
if the goal is for total equality,
but we all know that that's now where 

2580
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:19,400
really what feminism means to that,
you know,

2581
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,333
if you sit there and be like,
can you name just one thing that I can 

2582
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:23,990
do that you can't just one,
like,

2583
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:24,630
like one,
like,

2584
01:42:24,630 --> 01:42:25,463
and I'm not saying like you give birth,
I can or something like something 

2585
01:42:26,821 --> 01:42:27,654
biological.
I'm saying like,

2586
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:30,300
what can't you do?
Like,

2587
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:32,760
like if you really want it to.
I'm not saying that,

2588
01:42:32,761 --> 01:42:34,030
you know,
like I,

2589
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:37,080
I know for instance that um,
you know,

2590
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:38,480
the,
the,

2591
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:40,470
the examples that people give,
and I haven't seen the statistics,

2592
01:42:40,471 --> 01:42:41,910
but I've heard it circulated that even 
that,

2593
01:42:41,911 --> 01:42:44,040
you know,
companies are so desperate to hire women

2594
01:42:44,041 --> 01:42:46,350
because of this,
this situation,

2595
01:42:46,351 --> 01:42:47,184
this optical situation that they're in 
where it seems like women are being 

2596
01:42:49,470 --> 01:42:51,480
pushed down that women in their twenties
and thirties,

2597
01:42:51,481 --> 01:42:52,530
we're actually making more now.

2598
01:42:52,680 --> 01:42:53,970
You know,
that they're certainly,

2599
01:42:53,971 --> 01:42:55,370
they're more likely to get a higher 
education.

2600
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:57,540
Certainly they're more likely be,
you know,

2601
01:42:57,810 --> 01:42:58,643
even graduate high school.
So there are actually systemic benefits 

2602
01:43:01,500 --> 01:43:03,660
to being a woman and there's nothing 
necessarily wrong with that either.

2603
01:43:03,960 --> 01:43:06,000
But I just feel like it goes,
goes back to that thing of like,

2604
01:43:06,001 --> 01:43:07,350
why are we fighting?
Like,

2605
01:43:07,351 --> 01:43:09,000
what is the divisive nature,
can't we.

2606
01:43:09,180 --> 01:43:10,800
And this goes back to your question 
about the video game industry.

2607
01:43:10,801 --> 01:43:11,581
I'm like,
Hey,

2608
01:43:11,581 --> 01:43:14,100
instead of yelling at me about this,
we won't agree about this,

2609
01:43:14,190 --> 01:43:17,310
these situations over here,
but can we advocate for these together?

2610
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:18,533
Or do you not want to,
you wanna you wanna you don't want my 

2611
01:43:19,711 --> 01:43:23,190
advocacy for gay marriage because I 
believe in small government,

2612
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:25,870
you all my advocacy for a,
you know,

2613
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:28,260
transgender rights because I'm for low 
taxes,

2614
01:43:28,580 --> 01:43:29,670
just like,
I'm like,

2615
01:43:29,671 --> 01:43:30,504
okay,
that's weird because we can totally be 

2616
01:43:31,261 --> 01:43:34,320
friends here with the women's March.
I know that there were problems with pro

2617
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,140
life organizations getting involved at a
sponsorship level even.

2618
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:39,500
Oh Wow.
And uh,

2619
01:43:40,230 --> 01:43:43,090
it's like they're not women.
They're,

2620
01:43:43,130 --> 01:43:43,571
they,
they're,

2621
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:45,240
they're,
they're lesser than debate

2622
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,420
about that one issue.
Yeah.

2623
01:43:46,850 --> 01:43:47,683
Strange.
You said something that I want to go 

2624
01:43:48,991 --> 01:43:51,120
back to what,
what do you think feminism is about?

2625
01:43:52,090 --> 01:43:53,740
What's his argument about,
about equality?

2626
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,090
I mean,
to me,

2627
01:43:55,120 --> 01:43:58,600
feminism was about equality and I think 
that this,

2628
01:43:58,630 --> 01:43:59,291
this,
this,

2629
01:43:59,291 --> 01:44:00,124
you know,
I'm reading more about it and learning 

2630
01:44:00,641 --> 01:44:02,200
more about it,
so I'm still very ignorant about it.

2631
01:44:02,201 --> 01:44:03,640
But this third wave,
what they call it,

2632
01:44:03,641 --> 01:44:05,230
third wave feminism,
which I'm sure is a term you've heard,

2633
01:44:05,590 --> 01:44:10,420
that seems to be more about a combative 
nature to actually,

2634
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:11,783
you know,
instead of like saying like men and 

2635
01:44:12,461 --> 01:44:13,294
women are equal,
men and women should deserve the same 

2636
01:44:14,111 --> 01:44:15,910
rights and the same treatment and all 
those kinds of things.

2637
01:44:15,911 --> 01:44:18,940
It's actually seems to be very anti man 
in a way.

2638
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,490
Like it seems to be very,
like almost like the tables have turned,

2639
01:44:21,640 --> 01:44:22,480
you know,
and I'm like,

2640
01:44:22,481 --> 01:44:25,160
well why are you turning the tables like
we didn't have you achieve what you want

2641
01:44:25,161 --> 01:44:25,994
in like in the first place,
which was just that we were going to be 

2642
01:44:28,330 --> 01:44:29,930
here together at the,
you know,

2643
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,030
at the,
at the,

2644
01:44:31,060 --> 01:44:33,070
at the nexus of everything as two 
genders.

2645
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:37,490
Problem is that reinforcing that fake 
statistic,

2646
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:38,773
the,
the gender pay gap that so many people 

2647
01:44:40,641 --> 01:44:41,474
have heard that.
Like Sarah Silverman was just talking 

2648
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:45,020
about a recently and some,
some big thing that she did.

2649
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,790
I'm like,
that's not true,

2650
01:44:46,791 --> 01:44:49,490
but yet people just say it and no one 
stops them from Santa.

2651
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,770
A friend of mine that was a very 
educated guy said it,

2652
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:56,700
we were having a debate about a divorce 
and he brought it up and I was like,

2653
01:44:56,780 --> 01:44:57,613
that's not even true,
and unfortunately we're in a place with 

2654
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:00,584
no cell phone reception,
so I had to wait until we got back to 

2655
01:45:02,331 --> 01:45:04,460
send it to them.
Like this is not true.

2656
01:45:04,490 --> 01:45:07,640
Like what you're saying is not true.
Like you're repeating it as if you know,

2657
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:09,890
but meanwhile you've done zero research 
on it.

2658
01:45:09,891 --> 01:45:10,724
It's a talking point that just gets 
reiterated over and over again without 

2659
01:45:12,921 --> 01:45:14,900
any research and it's convenient.

2660
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:16,610
It's convenient to reinforce your 
argument.

2661
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:17,713
It's a number.
It's a number that deals with a very 

2662
01:45:19,161 --> 01:45:19,994
complex and nuanced debate and I think 
that the idea of feminism is to me in a 

2663
01:45:27,471 --> 01:45:28,304
lot of ways,
very similar to the idea of the men's 

2664
01:45:30,201 --> 01:45:32,930
rights movement.
I'm not opposed to rights for anybody.

2665
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:33,823
I'm not opposed to anyone.
I'm very egalitarianism ideas about the 

2666
01:45:36,681 --> 01:45:37,514
world,
but I am opposed to anybody that likes 

2667
01:45:40,101 --> 01:45:43,040
one gender over the other because I 
think that's foolish.

2668
01:45:43,041 --> 01:45:45,440
Just like I'm opposed to people that 
only like white people.

2669
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:47,930
I'm going to pose to people that only 
like black people,

2670
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:48,943
I'm opposed to people that generalize 
based on an enormous mass of human 

2671
01:45:53,271 --> 01:45:55,040
beings.
Like men are shit,

2672
01:45:55,190 --> 01:45:57,020
women rule,
girls rule,

2673
01:45:57,021 --> 01:45:58,420
boys drool.
You know,

2674
01:45:58,430 --> 01:46:00,170
I,
I don't like it the other way either.

2675
01:46:00,171 --> 01:46:02,240
I don't like it that he man,
woman haters club.

2676
01:46:02,241 --> 01:46:03,074
I don't like.
I don't like any ideologies that lump 

2677
01:46:05,961 --> 01:46:08,750
people into these huge groups because I 
think it's more on think.

2678
01:46:09,050 --> 01:46:11,060
I think it's a stupid way of looking at 
the world.

2679
01:46:11,240 --> 01:46:11,871
Yeah,
I agree.

2680
01:46:11,871 --> 01:46:12,231
And I,
I'm,

2681
01:46:12,231 --> 01:46:14,930
I'm the same way that the yellow tarian 
nature is the best that the,

2682
01:46:14,931 --> 01:46:15,740
the,
uh,

2683
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:19,340
live and let live nature to judge people
based on their character and the quality

2684
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:21,680
of their intelligence or whatever it is 
you're looking for in them.

2685
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:23,083
Shouldn't be categorized in these 
specific ways by sex or gender or by 

2686
01:46:26,450 --> 01:46:28,280
race or religion by any of those kinds 
of things.

2687
01:46:28,281 --> 01:46:29,114
I'm totally with you there,
but I think we both agree that women 

2688
01:46:30,381 --> 01:46:31,760
shouldn't be allowed to vote,
right?

2689
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:32,181
I mean,
yeah,

2690
01:46:32,181 --> 01:46:34,130
I mean that was a.
women have suffered long enough,

2691
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:37,560
enough already at girls I used to.
I used to think that joke was so funny.

2692
01:46:37,570 --> 01:46:38,403
You want mean you get murdered for that 
joke today with like the women's 

2693
01:46:40,080 --> 01:46:40,913
suffrage suffragettes like women have 
suffered long enough instead of 

2694
01:46:42,861 --> 01:46:43,790
suffering whatever.
And I was like,

2695
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:45,080
it's a funny joke.
I'd probably,

2696
01:46:45,270 --> 01:46:47,120
that would've ruined my career to,
on twitter,

2697
01:46:47,121 --> 01:46:49,040
but uh,
it didn't ruin your career.

2698
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:51,460
It just,
it gave you a platform.

2699
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,540
Honestly,
it's all,

2700
01:46:52,541 --> 01:46:53,900
it all balances out.
It's slow.

2701
01:46:53,910 --> 01:46:56,620
As long as you're being attacked for 
something that's not valid,

2702
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,320
it all balances out.
It just takes.

2703
01:46:58,350 --> 01:47:00,120
You take a little heat and then you 
realize like,

2704
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:01,170
okay,
I'm through that.

2705
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:02,550
Yeah.
It was scary for a little while.

2706
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:04,920
It was scary.
I don't know if scary is the right word.

2707
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:05,340
It's,
it was,

2708
01:47:05,340 --> 01:47:07,770
it was uncomfortable.
It was uncomfortable and unsettling.

2709
01:47:07,771 --> 01:47:09,750
And you really saw where everyone stood.
Right?

2710
01:47:09,751 --> 01:47:12,480
So one of the things I was talking with 
people about was,

2711
01:47:12,510 --> 01:47:15,070
you know,
how sad it was for me that no,

2712
01:47:15,071 --> 01:47:15,904
like very few people that I knew came to
my defense and I wasn't saying they had 

2713
01:47:18,001 --> 01:47:19,530
to come to my defense and be like,
uh,

2714
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:21,120
uh,
Collin,

2715
01:47:21,450 --> 01:47:22,920
you know,
that joke was fine.

2716
01:47:22,921 --> 01:47:23,790
Like,
if you didn't like the joke,

2717
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:24,450
that's,
I don't care.

2718
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:26,310
It's fine.
Jokes fall flat all the time.

2719
01:47:26,311 --> 01:47:27,270
You know,
that you're a comedian.

2720
01:47:27,271 --> 01:47:28,104
It's,
it's hard.

2721
01:47:28,160 --> 01:47:28,993
I don't do it professionally.
I mean it's impossibly hard to get on 

2722
01:47:30,721 --> 01:47:31,980
the stage and do that kind of stuff.

2723
01:47:32,010 --> 01:47:33,870
But to me I was like,
hey,

2724
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:35,730
is anyone going to say that I'm not a 
sexist?

2725
01:47:35,820 --> 01:47:38,790
Is anyone going to stand up that's known
me for 10 years and say like,

2726
01:47:38,791 --> 01:47:40,350
Hey,
we don't agree with the joke,

2727
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:44,160
but the way you're categorizing this guy
who I know is not accurate.

2728
01:47:44,220 --> 01:47:45,053
And I heard that there were some fights 
behind the scenes with people and I got 

2729
01:47:47,821 --> 01:47:50,250
a lot of DMZ messages but very little in
terms of public support.

2730
01:47:50,251 --> 01:47:52,830
And that really hurt me.
Like that really,

2731
01:47:53,100 --> 01:47:57,300
really hurt me and wounded me in a deep 
way and ruin friendships like that I had

2732
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:59,210
for years,
like fake friendship

2733
01:47:59,370 --> 01:48:00,340
man,
and you know,

2734
01:48:00,341 --> 01:48:03,670
and people probably felt the need to toe
the line,

2735
01:48:04,020 --> 01:48:04,860
you know,
toe this,

2736
01:48:04,890 --> 01:48:05,723
I don't want to say party line,
but the ideological ideological line 

2737
01:48:09,370 --> 01:48:10,203
mean the dogmatic line if you,
if you run into someone who is in any 

2738
01:48:16,001 --> 01:48:16,834
way involved in any sort of a dispute 
that makes that person appear to be a 

2739
01:48:19,841 --> 01:48:21,340
sexist,
you're supposed to pile on.

2740
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:22,391
Yeah.
And,

2741
01:48:22,391 --> 01:48:22,731
and,
and,

2742
01:48:22,731 --> 01:48:23,564
and that's exactly what they did.
And the thing that hurt me the most is 

2743
01:48:25,171 --> 01:48:26,004
that I didn't expect it.
I'm not close with a lot of these 

2744
01:48:27,631 --> 01:48:28,860
people,
but people that know me,

2745
01:48:29,250 --> 01:48:30,083
you know,
there are people in this industry that 

2746
01:48:30,811 --> 01:48:35,160
are writing that we're piling on me or 
remaining silent that got freelance work

2747
01:48:35,161 --> 01:48:35,994
because of me that got maybe even got 
hired because I was on a hiring 

2748
01:48:38,011 --> 01:48:38,821
committee that put,
you know,

2749
01:48:38,821 --> 01:48:40,180
push for them.
Uh,

2750
01:48:40,350 --> 01:48:41,183
all of these kinds of things that people
used to take out to lunch when I was 

2751
01:48:42,901 --> 01:48:44,130
senior editor to see how they were 
doing,

2752
01:48:44,131 --> 01:48:45,990
if there's anything I can do for them,
stuff like that.

2753
01:48:45,991 --> 01:48:47,760
And everyone's just like,
no,

2754
01:48:48,040 --> 01:48:49,680
not going to stay.
I'm not going to come back and help help

2755
01:48:49,681 --> 01:48:50,514
him out now.
And I tried to put that good energy out 

2756
01:48:51,931 --> 01:48:52,020
there.

2757
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:52,853
I'm not always full of good energy.
Sometimes I say negative things or bad 

2758
01:48:54,271 --> 01:48:55,530
things.
Sometimes they make mistakes,

2759
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:57,930
but when it comes,
when a person comes after your character

2760
01:48:58,200 --> 01:49:02,280
and you damn well know that there are a 
bunch of people around you that know who

2761
01:49:02,281 --> 01:49:03,114
you are,
whether or not they agree with what you 

2762
01:49:03,721 --> 01:49:06,570
said or agree with what you do,
but they know you're who you are.

2763
01:49:06,571 --> 01:49:07,404
And they know the severity of what 
people are saying and they don't say 

2764
01:49:09,601 --> 01:49:14,310
anything that really wounds a person and
that really fucking hurt.

2765
01:49:14,340 --> 01:49:15,173
Do you think?
I think

2766
01:49:15,200 --> 01:49:19,670
that what's going on and a lot of ways 
when people did not come to your defense

2767
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:22,800
is that what you're doing,
um,

2768
01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:23,743
in,
in many ways is making a very 

2769
01:49:25,821 --> 01:49:30,821
complicated and nuanced perspective from
a person in your,

2770
01:49:31,851 --> 01:49:32,740
in your stance,
you're,

2771
01:49:32,741 --> 01:49:34,220
you're kind of,
you're,

2772
01:49:34,350 --> 01:49:35,780
you're taking this,
this,

2773
01:49:36,550 --> 01:49:37,383
this path outside of the ideology and by
doing so you sort of challenge a lot of 

2774
01:49:44,271 --> 01:49:48,040
the ways these people have been behaving
for a long time and as soon as you do

2775
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:48,873
that,
they have to kind of reconsider these 

2776
01:49:49,721 --> 01:49:50,554
ideological boundaries that you've set 
up and their own behavior and thinking 

2777
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:56,710
and communication and that they don't 
want to do that and they,

2778
01:49:56,711 --> 01:49:59,350
they don't want to do that.
Like to keep things rigid and simple and

2779
01:49:59,470 --> 01:50:01,990
they also want to continue to progress 
in their career.

2780
01:50:02,200 --> 01:50:03,033
And in order to do that you have to kind
of like have this predetermined pattern 

2781
01:50:07,331 --> 01:50:08,164
that you follow.
I think simple is the key word that 

2782
01:50:10,460 --> 01:50:11,293
simple because yes they can.
There are people out there that can not 

2783
01:50:14,081 --> 01:50:17,290
comprehend how a person who believes in 
small government,

2784
01:50:17,291 --> 01:50:18,124
for instance,
we'll use the same argument that says 

2785
01:50:20,540 --> 01:50:21,373
the government can't touch my guns.
That's consistent with saying the 

2786
01:50:23,891 --> 01:50:24,724
government can't tell a woman what to do
with her body that's consistent with 

2787
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:27,491
principle.
It says,

2788
01:50:27,491 --> 01:50:28,324
I'm a government shouldn't even be 
involved in telling you who you can 

2789
01:50:30,131 --> 01:50:30,850
marry in the mannequin.

2790
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:31,683
Could she be able to marry a man and a 
woman should be able to marry a woman 

2791
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:36,010
and I would go as far as to say that 
even a polygamist totally on the,

2792
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,440
on the up and up,
everyone's in on it.

2793
01:50:37,450 --> 01:50:39,100
Relationship should not be the 
government.

2794
01:50:39,140 --> 01:50:39,973
The that of course,
they cannot acknowledge that it's the 

2795
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:44,830
lack of governmental power that gives 
you that.

2796
01:50:44,831 --> 01:50:45,790
Right?
In my perspective,

2797
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:49,110
when they feel like it's the wielding of
government power that ensures those,

2798
01:50:49,190 --> 01:50:50,830
those rights,
that's not the.

2799
01:50:50,930 --> 01:50:52,770
That's not congruent with them.
They don't understand how the how,

2800
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:53,673
how.
We don't understand how we came to the 

2801
01:50:55,241 --> 01:50:56,074
same exact conclusion by going just 
totally two different directions and 

2802
01:50:58,301 --> 01:50:59,134
that really that challenges them and 
they don't have the philosophical 

2803
01:51:00,641 --> 01:51:03,220
boundary bounding to figure out how that
might be.

2804
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:03,610
No.
Well,

2805
01:51:03,610 --> 01:51:04,443
that's the argument that the philosophy 
has to be bound in writing has to be 

2806
01:51:07,481 --> 01:51:09,370
bound in some sort of a doctrine.

2807
01:51:09,370 --> 01:51:13,210
It has to be written down on paper and 
established and enforced by a government

2808
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:15,580
that's.
That's like a big daddy thing,

2809
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:17,350
you know?
I mean instead of saying,

2810
01:51:17,410 --> 01:51:18,243
give the power to the people,
let people do whatever they would like 

2811
01:51:20,231 --> 01:51:23,440
to do as long as they're not infringing 
upon the rights of others and let's have

2812
01:51:23,441 --> 01:51:26,680
less and less people dictating what 
people get to do.

2813
01:51:27,120 --> 01:51:27,730
Right,
and that's,

2814
01:51:27,730 --> 01:51:31,550
that to me is liberty and they and they 
look at it or I don't want to say that,

2815
01:51:31,551 --> 01:51:32,384
but a lot of people,
a lot of progressives are regressives 

2816
01:51:33,561 --> 01:51:34,410
men.
They only want to look at them.

2817
01:51:34,510 --> 01:51:35,440
We'll look at it and be like,
well,

2818
01:51:35,441 --> 01:51:37,780
the government has one shared these 
things because these are not natural.

2819
01:51:38,170 --> 01:51:40,660
These are not natural rights are.
These are not things that can be insured

2820
01:51:40,661 --> 01:51:41,494
and I'm like,
but in the national society and the 

2821
01:51:43,481 --> 01:51:46,330
natural sense,
we have to have a consistent rights.

2822
01:51:46,720 --> 01:51:47,553
I can't in good faith say like I have 
the right to wield a gun because the 

2823
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:52,084
government can't tell me that even 
though it's enshrined in the bill of 

2824
01:51:53,051 --> 01:51:53,860
rights,
but then say like,

2825
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:54,693
oh,
the government can get involved in your 

2826
01:51:55,121 --> 01:51:57,490
bedroom though.
All of the garment can tap your phone.

2827
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,300
Oh,
the government.

2828
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:58,751
I'm like,
no,

2829
01:51:58,751 --> 01:52:00,670
it's either all or nothing and if you 
and if,

2830
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:01,523
if that's.
If that's a philosophy that's too hard 

2831
01:52:02,471 --> 01:52:05,500
for people to wrap their minds around 
and I don't know what to say about that,

2832
01:52:05,501 --> 01:52:06,334
but to me it's.
It's to me it's pretty clear and pretty 

2833
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:08,434
lucid the way I feel.
My principals are rooted in that 

2834
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:11,290
philosophy.
Also.

2835
01:52:11,291 --> 01:52:12,124
I think when people there,
they're seeking this sort of comfort 

2836
01:52:14,171 --> 01:52:17,700
level in,
in life and in,

2837
01:52:17,730 --> 01:52:18,563
in,
in their positions and I don't 

2838
01:52:19,931 --> 01:52:20,764
necessarily think people understand that
as soon as you allow the government to 

2839
01:52:23,651 --> 01:52:26,230
much power,
you will never get that back.

2840
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,573
As soon as they have power.
As soon as they can take away some of 

2841
01:52:30,011 --> 01:52:30,844
your liberties,
those will never get returned or one of 

2842
01:52:32,561 --> 01:52:35,350
the rare ones is marijuana.
It is a really.

2843
01:52:35,390 --> 01:52:35,751
Well,
it was.

2844
01:52:35,751 --> 01:52:37,660
I was trying to explain to someone the 
other day about this,

2845
01:52:37,661 --> 01:52:42,250
like it's incredibly rare that something
becomes legal that was illegal.

2846
01:52:42,251 --> 01:52:44,200
As long as marijuana.
It's very rare,

2847
01:52:44,350 --> 01:52:46,160
like something has be in a just

2848
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:51,180
completely undeniably good for it to 
have gone through all the propaganda,

2849
01:52:52,461 --> 01:52:53,840
all the bullshit,
all the lies,

2850
01:52:53,841 --> 01:52:54,674
all the governmental regulations.
So the people being locked up in jail 

2851
01:52:57,171 --> 01:52:58,004
for life or and then still come out the 
other side on 2017 and be legal and a 

2852
01:53:02,121 --> 01:53:04,320
bunch of states recreationally.
Yeah.

2853
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:05,900
Not even just medically.
It's great to see,

2854
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:10,880
but it's fascinating because it's one of
the rare instances where liberty last is

2855
01:53:10,881 --> 01:53:14,290
regained and most of the time it's not.
It's just not.

2856
01:53:14,350 --> 01:53:15,183
It's an aberration and that's what 
people have to be really scared of and 

2857
01:53:16,931 --> 01:53:17,711
that's.
That goes to the point.

2858
01:53:17,711 --> 01:53:18,544
It's like I don't want to give anything 
an inch because I am afraid of the 

2859
01:53:21,281 --> 01:53:22,114
consequences of giving anyone an inch.
That's why I wouldn't apologize for the 

2860
01:53:23,951 --> 01:53:24,784
joke,
that's why I resigned from my company 

2861
01:53:25,781 --> 01:53:27,400
instead of apologizing for the joke.
Wow.

2862
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:30,160
Could you apologize for that?
So first of all,

2863
01:53:30,161 --> 01:53:33,690
it's a honeymooners married with 
children all in the family level jokes,

2864
01:53:33,691 --> 01:53:37,570
something you'd see on the floor of a 
CBS writers room and it and,

2865
01:53:37,870 --> 01:53:38,703
but uh,
but the point is that I could have 

2866
01:53:39,401 --> 01:53:41,950
probably apologizing for,
but I'm like,

2867
01:53:42,490 --> 01:53:44,230
no because a,
I'm not sorry.

2868
01:53:44,231 --> 01:53:48,550
So that'll be a huge lie.
Be Like I have to now really recalibrate

2869
01:53:48,551 --> 01:53:50,180
the way I go about my business with,
you know,

2870
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:51,820
with my partners and with the audience 
because,

2871
01:53:52,780 --> 01:53:53,613
you know,
I didn't have the protections that I 

2872
01:53:54,881 --> 01:53:57,160
thought I would have when,
when the mistake was made,

2873
01:53:57,161 --> 01:53:59,080
you know what I mean?
Like I didn't and that was what hurt me.

2874
01:53:59,081 --> 01:53:59,914
So I,
I tried to do what I thought was the 

2875
01:54:01,991 --> 01:54:04,540
most principled and character driven 
choice which would be like,

2876
01:54:04,541 --> 01:54:06,790
this is best for my partners who don't 
agree with me.

2877
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:08,560
This is best for the audience who might 
not agree with me.

2878
01:54:08,561 --> 01:54:09,394
It seems like a lot of them do.
And this is the best for just everyone 

2879
01:54:11,681 --> 01:54:12,514
moving forward.
I'll have other opportunities and other 

2880
01:54:13,841 --> 01:54:14,630
things that I can do.

2881
01:54:14,630 --> 01:54:16,550
Has it been any blowback,
um,

2882
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:19,320
targeted towards the people that were 
upset at you?

2883
01:54:19,480 --> 01:54:21,140
Yes.
Uh,

2884
01:54:21,280 --> 01:54:22,650
and the thing that,
the,

2885
01:54:22,700 --> 01:54:23,533
you know,
it's sad to see because it's not in my 

2886
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:25,873
eye.
I feel like I'm a pretty good natured 

2887
01:54:26,411 --> 01:54:29,560
person and I don't like CP seeing that 
rubber band effect going on where people

2888
01:54:29,561 --> 01:54:32,200
now are suffering because they stood up 
and stood out or whatever.

2889
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:33,303
It's just that.
And I don't care about the people that 

2890
01:54:34,211 --> 01:54:36,070
were out to character assassinate me.
I'm talking about like,

2891
01:54:36,150 --> 01:54:37,810
you know,
my and my business partners and stuff.

2892
01:54:38,140 --> 01:54:40,420
It's just that like,
no matter what I say will be twisted.

2893
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,433
I tried to be very magnanimous and like 
very kind about it when I was on Ruben 

2894
01:54:43,981 --> 01:54:47,110
the second time and people twisted 
everything to just be a problem anyway.

2895
01:54:47,111 --> 01:54:47,944
So I'm like,
I'll just remain silent because I'd 

2896
01:54:48,701 --> 01:54:51,100
rather than misconstrue the silence that
misconstrue the words,

2897
01:54:51,101 --> 01:54:52,460
you know?
Um,

2898
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:53,400
is that

2899
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:54,240
problem?
No,

2900
01:54:54,241 --> 01:54:55,130
the,
if you,

2901
01:54:55,140 --> 01:54:55,973
if you're not communicating freely and 
because you're worried about the 

2902
01:54:57,961 --> 01:54:58,780
repercussions,

2903
01:54:58,780 --> 01:55:00,100
I'm not worried about the repercussions.
For me,

2904
01:55:00,101 --> 01:55:00,934
I'm worried about foisting repercussions
on other people that have no control 

2905
01:55:02,921 --> 01:55:03,754
over what I'm saying.

2906
01:55:03,810 --> 01:55:05,430
Yeah.
But even even that,

2907
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:06,533
it's like it's not your responsibility 
as long as you're communicating in an 

2908
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:10,410
honest way.
Sure.

2909
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:12,233
I mean you're thinking that's sort of 
the same reason why people didn't come 

2910
01:55:14,911 --> 01:55:15,744
to your support in the first place 
because they were worried that if they 

2911
01:55:17,791 --> 01:55:19,770
spoke their mind,
they would be targeted.

2912
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:20,753
If they said,
hey,

2913
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,500
you know,
I know that this is going on.

2914
01:55:22,501 --> 01:55:23,730
I think Collins,
a great guy,

2915
01:55:23,731 --> 01:55:24,564
I don't think he's sexist and my feeling
on them is that it was just a joke and 

2916
01:55:27,961 --> 01:55:29,970
then they could get targeted and they 
chose not to.

2917
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:30,833
They chose not to step up and,
and a lot of ways you not speaking your 

2918
01:55:34,531 --> 01:55:37,560
mind in a clear way sort of sets that 
same sort of tone.

2919
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:38,723
I think you should be able to speak 
freely and I think you should be held 

2920
01:55:40,471 --> 01:55:41,304
responsible for when you say something 
and irresponsible like it's or it's 

2921
01:55:44,881 --> 01:55:45,714
wrong or it's hurtful in some ways and 
people make mistakes like that all the 

2922
01:55:48,331 --> 01:55:49,164
time and there's also we have to take 
into account that a lot of times people 

2923
01:55:51,091 --> 01:55:51,924
don't realize the consequences of their 
words or they say things in a flippant 

2924
01:55:54,481 --> 01:55:55,314
manner or they're tired or they're 
stressed or things come out that they 

2925
01:55:57,961 --> 01:55:58,794
don't necessarily believe in that way,
but especially when it comes to like 

2926
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:05,640
something like twitter or some short 
form short paragraphs sort of a thing.

2927
01:56:06,120 --> 01:56:06,953
I think it's really important that we be
given the opportunity to express 

2928
01:56:10,171 --> 01:56:11,004
ourselves fully and then the 
disagreements with that be categorized 

2929
01:56:15,330 --> 01:56:16,163
in an honest way and what I had the most
problem with was not just someone 

2930
01:56:20,161 --> 01:56:20,994
calling you a racist,
but everyone was making it out to be 

2931
01:56:23,431 --> 01:56:26,640
this horrible,
sexist,

2932
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:30,660
evil thing.
When it's clearly something said in jest

2933
01:56:30,900 --> 01:56:33,280
and as soon as you can.
And that's my wheelhouse.

2934
01:56:33,300 --> 01:56:34,133
As soon as you start taking humor and 
something that people say that it's 

2935
01:56:37,291 --> 01:56:41,340
absolutely meant to be just funny and 
make it as like the,

2936
01:56:41,360 --> 01:56:42,193
Oh,
this guy just signed an affidavit that 

2937
01:56:42,961 --> 01:56:45,210
women should shut the fuck up because 
it's better.

2938
01:56:45,510 --> 01:56:47,520
I mean,
that's really the worst case scenario.

2939
01:56:47,521 --> 01:56:48,900
Interpretation of what you said.

2940
01:56:49,200 --> 01:56:49,691
Yeah.
And,

2941
01:56:49,691 --> 01:56:50,910
and uh,
yeah,

2942
01:56:50,911 --> 01:56:55,470
I think that that was the disappointing 
part of it was again,

2943
01:56:55,471 --> 01:56:57,450
it goes back to this point of like 
ignored everything.

2944
01:56:57,451 --> 01:57:00,240
Like my body of work,
the things that I actually stood up very

2945
01:57:00,241 --> 01:57:01,074
loudly for political and social causes.
Many times there are huge videos I have 

2946
01:57:03,321 --> 01:57:04,154
of the things that my feelings on the 
confederate flag or like how I feel 

2947
01:57:06,991 --> 01:57:09,030
like.
What did you think about the confederate

2948
01:57:09,031 --> 01:57:09,864
flag?
I think that you have the right to fly 

2949
01:57:10,591 --> 01:57:11,424
it.
I just think it's in terrible taste and 

2950
01:57:11,971 --> 01:57:13,880
I understand why people were upset about
it and I don't think it should be in.

2951
01:57:13,980 --> 01:57:16,600
I don't think the flag of a trader is 
country.

2952
01:57:16,601 --> 01:57:19,860
It should be instituted in state flags 
in the United States.

2953
01:57:19,910 --> 01:57:22,110
He's your dad I think is absolutely 
valid.

2954
01:57:22,111 --> 01:57:25,350
Do you think that it's legal,
is it legal to have a Nazi flag?

2955
01:57:25,740 --> 01:57:26,540
Is it

2956
01:57:26,540 --> 01:57:27,630
almost wants to go?
Yeah,

2957
01:57:27,780 --> 01:57:28,613
I would.
I only see why it wouldn't be legal to 

2958
01:57:30,211 --> 01:57:31,044
have the confederate flag,
but you just can't have it on the Dukes 

2959
01:57:33,420 --> 01:57:34,480
of hazzard.
Well,

2960
01:57:34,770 --> 01:57:35,603
to me it's like I'm not talking about 
the legality of it because if you want 

2961
01:57:37,381 --> 01:57:39,230
to fly a swastika out your house,
you're allowed to.

2962
01:57:39,240 --> 01:57:40,740
I think you should probably be allowed 
to do that.

2963
01:57:40,741 --> 01:57:41,574
I don't think.
I think you're an absolute idiot for 

2964
01:57:42,721 --> 01:57:44,550
doing that,
but that's your right to be an idiot.

2965
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:47,070
But the confederate flag thing was just 
a sign for me because it was,

2966
01:57:47,090 --> 01:57:48,060
it was this,
it was this,

2967
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:48,750
uh,
this,

2968
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:50,490
this juxtaposition of saying,
look,

2969
01:57:50,491 --> 01:57:52,470
well we're talking about the legal 
rights,

2970
01:57:52,471 --> 01:57:53,760
but actually I'm talking about the 
taste,

2971
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:54,460
right?
You know,

2972
01:57:54,460 --> 01:57:57,600
like say like,
people don't remember what the CSA was.

2973
01:57:57,601 --> 01:57:59,820
I don't think a lot of people even fly 
that flag and know what the hell they're

2974
01:57:59,821 --> 01:58:03,810
flying this country seceded from the 
United States.

2975
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:08,220
They were traders and or their Leonard 
skinner fence,

2976
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:11,140
or they're huge Leonard skinner advance 
a huge big and Mississippi like,

2977
01:58:11,180 --> 01:58:12,810
you know,
but to me I'm like,

2978
01:58:12,900 --> 01:58:13,701
we have to have,
let's,

2979
01:58:13,701 --> 01:58:16,290
let's put this in historicity.
Let's think about what we're doing here.

2980
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:21,300
This country left to protect its slaves.
It's right to own slaves.

2981
01:58:21,301 --> 01:58:23,670
Any other interpretation of it is wrong 
based on,

2982
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:26,370
on what was going on in the 18 fifties 
and leading up to 18,

2983
01:58:26,371 --> 01:58:28,470
60 these states' rights advocate and all
that.

2984
01:58:28,471 --> 01:58:31,080
That's not what it was about economics.
It's not what it was about.

2985
01:58:31,140 --> 01:58:33,120
It wasn't about states' rights,
it wasn't about any of those things.

2986
01:58:33,121 --> 01:58:33,954
It was about your ability.
Your economy would have fallen apart 

2987
01:58:35,131 --> 01:58:38,160
without free labor.
And these people left.

2988
01:58:38,730 --> 01:58:39,563
They caused a gratuitously bloody war 
and then they were let me know both 

2989
01:58:43,900 --> 01:58:46,510
Abraham Lincoln and then Andrew Johnson,
just let them back in,

2990
01:58:47,020 --> 01:58:47,770
you know,
uh,

2991
01:58:47,770 --> 01:58:50,470
Jefferson Davis who was the president of
the confederacy,

2992
01:58:50,980 --> 01:58:52,300
wasn't murdered.

2993
01:58:52,390 --> 01:58:53,920
He wasn't executed,
you know,

2994
01:58:53,921 --> 01:58:58,270
like they were all back in.
And for some reason,

2995
01:58:58,271 --> 01:59:00,610
because reconstruction went the way it 
did into the,

2996
01:59:00,611 --> 01:59:03,970
into the ulysses s grant,
kind of a era of presidency,

2997
01:59:04,180 --> 01:59:05,230
people look at it and be like,
well,

2998
01:59:05,231 --> 01:59:07,240
things kind of ended good and they're 
kind of like brothers again.

2999
01:59:07,241 --> 01:59:08,074
And I'm like,
that's not really the way it was with 

3000
01:59:08,710 --> 01:59:11,710
Jim crow came up and stuff like that.
This fucking flag means something,

3001
01:59:11,711 --> 01:59:15,010
the Pfarius and you can't.
So it's your right to fly it.

3002
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:16,570
And if you feel like that's a southern 
pride thing,

3003
01:59:16,610 --> 01:59:17,770
more power to.
I love the south.

3004
01:59:17,771 --> 01:59:20,350
I think the south awesome south needs 
another flag.

3005
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:21,340
But yeah,
you would need to.

3006
01:59:21,341 --> 01:59:23,800
You need to know what this flag means to
people.

3007
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:27,730
You guys left,
you guys killed hundreds of thousands of

3008
01:59:27,790 --> 01:59:32,140
people doing it and,
and you just fly.

3009
01:59:32,141 --> 01:59:33,520
This flag is like the south will rise 
again.

3010
01:59:33,521 --> 01:59:34,070
No,
it won't.

3011
01:59:34,070 --> 01:59:36,700
Don't you think that that's a bad 
expression.

3012
01:59:36,710 --> 01:59:38,870
The south will rise again is a terrible 
expression.

3013
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:39,704
But I think that a lot of people look at
that flag and it represents what we're 

3014
01:59:43,581 --> 01:59:45,770
calling southern pride,
which is nothing wrong.

3015
01:59:45,771 --> 01:59:46,604
Nothing wrong with being proud of being 
from Georgia or wherever the fuck your 

3016
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:49,790
friends states down there.
Yeah,

3017
01:59:49,791 --> 01:59:50,624
but I think the,
the issue is what it means to other 

3018
01:59:52,311 --> 01:59:53,144
people you know,
and whether or not that's valid when 

3019
01:59:55,071 --> 01:59:56,810
you're not talking about like touchy 
feely,

3020
01:59:56,840 --> 01:59:57,673
like people being oversensitive.
Now you're talking about a horrible war 

3021
02:00:01,400 --> 02:00:02,233
about slavery.
It's like probably one of the worst 

3022
02:00:03,711 --> 02:00:04,544
kinds of wars like a war because we 
would like to keep people in prison and 

3023
02:00:08,361 --> 02:00:09,194
working for free.
So we're willing to kill other people 

3024
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:12,560
over it to fight for that.
Right.

3025
02:00:12,620 --> 02:00:13,950
This is essentially what it was.
Right.

3026
02:00:14,210 --> 02:00:15,043
So it's to the people of today,
it doesn't seem like that because 

3027
02:00:17,781 --> 02:00:22,490
they're not living in 1850,
they're not in the days when you know,

3028
02:00:22,491 --> 02:00:23,324
they have these massive like,
like Gettysburg or they have these 

3029
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:29,630
massive areas where people would be 
slaughtered.

3030
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:32,000
I mean this people to this day,
that's still fine.

3031
02:00:32,001 --> 02:00:35,810
Like civil war shit where they had these
massive battles and they can dig through

3032
02:00:35,811 --> 02:00:40,370
the ground with metal detectors and they
find bullets and guns and badges and

3033
02:00:40,690 --> 02:00:41,750
awesome.
It's great.

3034
02:00:41,770 --> 02:00:42,700
It's great.
I mean,

3035
02:00:42,701 --> 02:00:43,534
I,
I took the idea from a saving private 

3036
02:00:44,801 --> 02:00:45,634
Ryan,
the guy that would take dirt from all 

3037
02:00:46,421 --> 02:00:47,440
the battlefields,
that they would go to them,

3038
02:00:47,441 --> 02:00:48,450
put it in,
put it in jars,

3039
02:00:49,200 --> 02:00:50,980
he and you put it.
They only showed it once in the movie,

3040
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:51,993
but I used to go to all these 
battlefields when I was a kid because I 

3041
02:00:53,141 --> 02:00:54,610
was fascinated by my parents would bring
me in,

3042
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:56,980
I would take,
I would go buy baby food and dumped them

3043
02:00:56,981 --> 02:00:57,814
out and then go to all the battlefields 
and put dirt on each of them and put 

3044
02:01:00,061 --> 02:01:00,894
them on.
Oh,

3045
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:02,230
that's heavy.
Yeah.

3046
02:01:02,231 --> 02:01:03,940
I like this.
When you were a kid.

3047
02:01:03,970 --> 02:01:05,590
Yeah,
like my in my teens and early twenties.

3048
02:01:05,591 --> 02:01:07,150
Yeah.
So you've always been into this.

3049
02:01:07,190 --> 02:01:08,140
Yes.
Since I was,

3050
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:09,123
uh,
my earliest memory is of being in the 

3051
02:01:11,261 --> 02:01:13,000
politics and history was,
was the Gulf War,

3052
02:01:13,001 --> 02:01:13,834
which was 99,
kind of the lead up to it with Kuwait 

3053
02:01:15,671 --> 02:01:15,920
and stuff.

3054
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:17,890
90 91.
So I was like six or seven.

3055
02:01:17,891 --> 02:01:18,570
I remember,
you know,

3056
02:01:18,570 --> 02:01:19,780
Newsday,
as Long Island newspaper,

3057
02:01:19,781 --> 02:01:23,700
I remember just seeing images and kind 
of maps and,

3058
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:25,190
and I didn't really understand what was 
going on.

3059
02:01:25,191 --> 02:01:26,410
I couldn't even read most of the words.
I mean,

3060
02:01:26,420 --> 02:01:28,270
it's complicated geopolitical stuff 
they're talking about,

3061
02:01:28,271 --> 02:01:29,104
but I ever since that point I was very 
politically focused on my dad is a 

3062
02:01:32,081 --> 02:01:33,910
staunch,
like Rockefeller Republican,

3063
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:36,250
like a Paleo con,
like a moderate Republican,

3064
02:01:36,820 --> 02:01:38,380
um,
in the old north,

3065
02:01:38,381 --> 02:01:40,010
you know,
people out there right now.

3066
02:01:40,011 --> 02:01:42,590
But like Republicans are pretty 
disparate group,

3067
02:01:42,620 --> 02:01:43,453
like Republicans in New England are.
Republicans in New York are very 

3068
02:01:45,591 --> 02:01:46,424
different than Republicans in Texas,
but they're both Republicans and my dad 

3069
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:51,960
grew up just in,
you know,

3070
02:01:52,220 --> 02:01:55,490
giving me things to read and,
and feeding that fire and by me maps and

3071
02:01:55,491 --> 02:01:56,324
buying me books and we will listen to 
talk radio and we would debate things 

3072
02:01:58,971 --> 02:02:01,500
and we would kind of come to these 
conclusions of different things.

3073
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:03,650
And we disagree with that.
A lot of things still to this day.

3074
02:02:03,651 --> 02:02:05,240
But he's a great man.
And uh,

3075
02:02:05,780 --> 02:02:07,370
ever since then I was really,
really interested in.

3076
02:02:07,371 --> 02:02:08,204
I knew when I was fourth or fifth grade 
that I would study history and I 

3077
02:02:10,281 --> 02:02:11,114
remember in New York we have this thing 
called the regions in high school which 

3078
02:02:13,881 --> 02:02:14,714
are like these tests,
these state run tests you have to pass 

3079
02:02:15,951 --> 02:02:16,784
to graduate,
so like you would take your class but 

3080
02:02:18,021 --> 02:02:20,150
then you have to take your final,
but then you have to take a regents exam

3081
02:02:20,151 --> 02:02:21,650
which is the state run thing,
say like,

3082
02:02:21,651 --> 02:02:22,670
you know,
math,

3083
02:02:22,700 --> 02:02:23,533
you know,
whatever.

3084
02:02:23,780 --> 02:02:24,613
And I remember when I was in sixth grade
and my sister alley who is six years 

3085
02:02:26,601 --> 02:02:27,434
older than me,
it was taking the US history regents 

3086
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:32,810
like the next few days from then.
And I helped her study and I,

3087
02:02:32,970 --> 02:02:33,803
and like I remember like she didn't know
any really anything she needed to know 

3088
02:02:36,561 --> 02:02:37,394
and I taught her like what she needed to
know just for this very rudimentary 

3089
02:02:40,221 --> 02:02:41,030
test.

3090
02:02:41,030 --> 02:02:42,820
And that was stuck in my mind where I 
was like,

3091
02:02:42,821 --> 02:02:43,970
the,
I have a real passion for this.

3092
02:02:44,060 --> 02:02:45,140
I really like it.
I enjoy it.

3093
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:45,974
I don't know everything.
I make mistakes sometimes and I changed 

3094
02:02:47,901 --> 02:02:50,240
the way I feel sometimes,
but it's always been a real,

3095
02:02:50,270 --> 02:02:53,000
real fascinating.
Now that you've left your company,

3096
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:56,480
the which was,
wow,

3097
02:02:56,510 --> 02:02:57,500
what was it called?
Kind of fun.

3098
02:02:57,501 --> 02:02:58,050
Kind of funny.
Yeah,

3099
02:02:58,050 --> 02:02:58,883
and what was kind of funny,
kind of funny was the four of us that 

3100
02:03:00,981 --> 02:03:01,814
founded the company were all at ign in 
different respects and we spun off to 

3101
02:03:05,631 --> 02:03:06,464
just start our own youtube channel about
games and nerd culture and stuff like 

3102
02:03:08,661 --> 02:03:09,494
that,
do podcasts and we found some good 

3103
02:03:10,731 --> 02:03:11,564
success,
almost a crowdfunded on Patrion and it 

3104
02:03:13,551 --> 02:03:15,770
was a lot of fun.
Then I enjoyed it,

3105
02:03:15,771 --> 02:03:16,604
but I felt like I needed to leave 
because I felt like that was the best 

3106
02:03:17,901 --> 02:03:18,620
for everybody.

3107
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:19,820
Well,
once that.

3108
02:03:20,710 --> 02:03:21,543
I mean,
how could you not if he turned on you 

3109
02:03:22,461 --> 02:03:24,350
over that stupid fucking joke.
Yeah,

3110
02:03:24,351 --> 02:03:25,850
I mean it's like,
it was a stupid joke.

3111
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:28,490
It was a bad joke,
but I mean it's not even that bad.

3112
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:29,240
No,
I appreciate that.

3113
02:03:29,240 --> 02:03:30,590
That means a lot coming from you.
I looked at it.

3114
02:03:30,700 --> 02:03:31,533
That's stupid.
The reaction to it was so fucking 

3115
02:03:32,901 --> 02:03:34,460
stupid.
It was stupid and I felt like,

3116
02:03:34,461 --> 02:03:35,294
you know,
I wish that I wish that things went 

3117
02:03:36,531 --> 02:03:37,430
differently.
I wish that,

3118
02:03:37,850 --> 02:03:38,683
you know,
we had a lot of fights behind the 

3119
02:03:39,381 --> 02:03:40,191
scenes.
I won't get into all that.

3120
02:03:40,191 --> 02:03:41,840
I don't think.
I honestly think it's good.

3121
02:03:42,110 --> 02:03:43,190
I think it's good to.
I don't,

3122
02:03:43,191 --> 02:03:44,050
I don't know.
I,

3123
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:45,283
I felt like I did what was right for 
them and I felt like we would have just 

3124
02:03:47,511 --> 02:03:49,520
come to this impasse again.
So I was like,

3125
02:03:49,820 --> 02:03:51,670
let's just pull the bandaid off and get 
to get this over with.

3126
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:53,900
Are you going to do something that 
involves politics now?

3127
02:03:53,901 --> 02:03:56,240
Because clearly you have a deep passion 
for this.

3128
02:03:56,270 --> 02:03:57,110
Yeah.
I started a,

3129
02:03:57,111 --> 02:03:57,944
uh,
a new youtube channel that the first 

3130
02:03:59,121 --> 02:04:01,340
video about April third.
It's called Colin's last stand.

3131
02:04:01,610 --> 02:04:03,140
Um,
and crazy.

3132
02:04:03,141 --> 02:04:07,310
It's already funded on Patrion 38,
$38,000 a mind for.

3133
02:04:08,030 --> 02:04:08,510
Well,
it's.

3134
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:10,680
People are committing an expression.
I do it.

3135
02:04:10,690 --> 02:04:12,170
Yeah,
because I think it's powerful.

3136
02:04:12,171 --> 02:04:14,870
Like there are things worth dying for 
things worth risking.

3137
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,300
There it is.
So I,

3138
02:04:16,310 --> 02:04:20,990
I reached $39,000 a month and it's going
to fall $39,000 a month.

3139
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:22,690
People it's going to fall.
I'm sure it's going to fall.

3140
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:24,710
People.
Shit Dude.

3141
02:04:24,711 --> 02:04:25,544
People are talking.
People are responding to my this holy 

3142
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:29,750
Shit.
That's a lot of fucking money.

3143
02:04:30,110 --> 02:04:30,943
30 nine grand a month.
You're going to get $39,000 a month and 

3144
02:04:33,891 --> 02:04:35,630
you haven't even started yet.
Yeah,

3145
02:04:35,631 --> 02:04:36,464
technically.
But it's going to fall back down to the 

3146
02:04:39,001 --> 02:04:39,380
teens.

3147
02:04:39,380 --> 02:04:42,480
Probably relaxed with your humility will
take it down.

3148
02:04:43,170 --> 02:04:44,760
If you scroll here,
you'll see on the left side,

3149
02:04:44,761 --> 02:04:47,700
underneath the number.
My stretch goal is to reach $10,000.

3150
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:48,700
So my,
my,

3151
02:04:48,810 --> 02:04:51,480
my expectations were blown out of the 
water and I really.

3152
02:04:51,481 --> 02:04:52,860
What I read into the show is,
is,

3153
02:04:52,861 --> 02:04:57,120
is you know,
people are just sick of this bullshit.

3154
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:58,193
This is them,
this is them speaking and being like we 

3155
02:04:59,941 --> 02:05:00,774
need a conduit that's going to get into 
the history and get into the philosophy 

3156
02:05:03,421 --> 02:05:04,254
and the politics.
But also that will stand up and say 

3157
02:05:05,491 --> 02:05:07,110
like,
I'm not sorry for a joke.

3158
02:05:07,111 --> 02:05:07,944
People have the right to make mistakes.
People have the right to express 

3159
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:10,014
themselves.
It goes back to the confederate flag 

3160
02:05:11,341 --> 02:05:12,174
thing.
I might disagree with a person that 

3161
02:05:13,321 --> 02:05:15,660
flies that flag,
but I'm not going to go wrap up on their

3162
02:05:15,661 --> 02:05:17,790
door and pull it off and call them a 
racist.

3163
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:19,020
I'm just going to shake my head and 
walk,

3164
02:05:19,170 --> 02:05:20,003
you know,
because there are other things to worry 

3165
02:05:20,881 --> 02:05:21,714
about.
So it's people that like want more 

3166
02:05:23,341 --> 02:05:24,174
liberty focused,
individual focused kind of things and 

3167
02:05:26,850 --> 02:05:29,550
that's just people speaking to me,
you know,

3168
02:05:29,610 --> 02:05:30,443
so.
So the number will fall back down after 

3169
02:05:31,321 --> 02:05:31,830
the month.
I'm sharing.

3170
02:05:31,830 --> 02:05:34,560
That's fine.
Just stop synchronet drive me crazy with

3171
02:05:34,561 --> 02:05:37,130
this fake humility.
It's not humility out.

3172
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:40,010
Actually I remember I was going to fall.
No,

3173
02:05:40,020 --> 02:05:41,850
people are gonna like me less but,
but,

3174
02:05:41,851 --> 02:05:42,630
but,
but my,

3175
02:05:42,630 --> 02:05:44,190
my whole Dad's side,
it's really not fake humility.

3176
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:45,073
It's me saying like,
I hear you and I'll do my very best to 

3177
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,020
do this.
The numbers keep going up.

3178
02:05:49,021 --> 02:05:49,854
The problem is everyone's going to know 
what the numbers are and they're going 

3179
02:05:51,181 --> 02:05:52,480
to go out or I need to give him any 
money.

3180
02:05:52,490 --> 02:05:54,120
He's making $39,000 a month.

3181
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:55,290
That's fine,
that's not fine.

3182
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:56,700
She'd hide that number.
Can you hide it?

3183
02:05:56,701 --> 02:05:57,900
You can,
but I feel like I want to be.

3184
02:05:57,910 --> 02:05:58,743
I want to be,
I want to be honest with people and oh 

3185
02:06:00,100 --> 02:06:00,933
my God,
if you weren't patrion you'd frigging 

3186
02:06:01,441 --> 02:06:03,030
kill.
Got to get that cash the sun.

3187
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:03,930
But yeah,
you kind of hide it,

3188
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:05,940
but I want it to be totally transparent.
What I keep telling people is,

3189
02:06:05,941 --> 02:06:07,980
as long as we keep a level of 
sustainable level of money,

3190
02:06:07,981 --> 02:06:10,740
which is way less than what I have now,
there'll be no baked and adds,

3191
02:06:10,800 --> 02:06:12,210
no product placements,
none of that.

3192
02:06:12,211 --> 02:06:15,020
And I want people to know I want,
I want people to be involved in the,

3193
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:15,870
in it from.
It's.

3194
02:06:15,870 --> 02:06:19,820
So Colin's last stand is about politics.
It's going to be.

3195
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:20,663
Yeah.
So I want to do two videos a week 

3196
02:06:22,260 --> 02:06:25,110
between 10 and 15 minutes long each that
are scripted and written.

3197
02:06:25,310 --> 02:06:26,830
Um,
and I know how to edit and something.

3198
02:06:26,831 --> 02:06:29,160
I'm very good at it.
The quality of the videos,

3199
02:06:29,270 --> 02:06:29,910
uh,
from a,

3200
02:06:29,910 --> 02:06:32,070
from an ethical perspective,
you'll find better quality.

3201
02:06:32,071 --> 02:06:33,750
But I want the content to be really 
good.

3202
02:06:34,140 --> 02:06:35,610
And so I want to just do two videos a 
week,

3203
02:06:35,640 --> 02:06:38,280
one probably focused on history and one 
probably focused on politics.

3204
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:39,293
So one that's more rooted in,
in philosophy that I'll go research and 

3205
02:06:41,281 --> 02:06:42,114
write.
I'm already researching and writing the 

3206
02:06:42,421 --> 02:06:43,740
first one.
I don't want to ruin it for anyone yet,

3207
02:06:43,741 --> 02:06:46,170
but I think it'd be really fun.
And then the second,

3208
02:06:46,620 --> 02:06:47,453
maybe the second video every week will 
be something about what's happening in 

3209
02:06:48,691 --> 02:06:50,310
the world and I'll talk to a camera and 
just be like,

3210
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:52,860
this is the way I feel about this.
This is maybe why I feel this way.

3211
02:06:53,220 --> 02:06:54,990
And just.
And just some stuff out there.

3212
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,900
You know,
I want to treat people's time with care.

3213
02:06:57,901 --> 02:06:59,670
I don't have the brand you have.
I don't have,

3214
02:06:59,690 --> 02:07:00,510
you know,
people that are,

3215
02:07:00,510 --> 02:07:02,670
that are religious about listening to 
everything I do.

3216
02:07:02,880 --> 02:07:04,500
So I want people to like look forward to
saying like,

3217
02:07:04,501 --> 02:07:05,430
Oh,
twice a week column.

3218
02:07:05,431 --> 02:07:07,320
I put up a 10 minute video that I can 
just,

3219
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:08,273
when I'm making dinner,
just listened to it in the background 

3220
02:07:09,331 --> 02:07:11,880
and then go about my day and maybe learn
something or maybe feel a certain way or

3221
02:07:11,881 --> 02:07:14,050
maybe I disagree and then move on and,
and,

3222
02:07:14,060 --> 02:07:14,893
and,
and have it just be a part of people's 

3223
02:07:15,961 --> 02:07:16,470
lives.
And that.

3224
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:17,303
So clearly you've put a lot of thought 
into this and you've thought this 

3225
02:07:18,901 --> 02:07:21,750
through obviously something you're 
really planning out.

3226
02:07:21,751 --> 02:07:22,441
Well,
yeah,

3227
02:07:22,441 --> 02:07:25,070
I'm trying.
I mean that was actually the one,

3228
02:07:25,080 --> 02:07:25,913
the number kept rising.
I was horrified like at first because I 

3229
02:07:27,751 --> 02:07:29,430
was like,
because I was like,

3230
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:31,400
I have that ability.

3231
02:07:31,450 --> 02:07:34,810
Like I hate money though.
It was of course I love money but I,

3232
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:35,653
I,
it's like the imposter syndrome where 

3233
02:07:36,311 --> 02:07:38,230
you never really know that you're 
earning it or whatever.

3234
02:07:38,231 --> 02:07:39,230
And I'm like,
I want,

3235
02:07:39,250 --> 02:07:42,730
I don't want to let anyone down.
I only have right now the intro video,

3236
02:07:42,731 --> 02:07:44,770
which is just me talking to the camera 
kind of with what my plan is.

3237
02:07:44,771 --> 02:07:48,070
I'm trying to really keep people engaged
and putting update videos on and letting

3238
02:07:48,071 --> 02:07:49,740
them know where everything is.
Um,

3239
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,340
but yeah,
it was horrified because I'm like,

3240
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:52,593
you know,
I only have the bandwidth to do two 

3241
02:07:54,371 --> 02:07:55,204
videos a week,
whether I'm making $15,000 a month or 

3242
02:07:56,531 --> 02:07:57,364
$40,000 a month.
And so if I put out a video to everyone 

3243
02:08:00,071 --> 02:08:00,904
being like,
if this level sustained or even a level 

3244
02:08:01,841 --> 02:08:03,250
that's in the twenties or thirties,
whatever it is,

3245
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:06,190
I have to recalibrate what I'm thinking,
you know,

3246
02:08:06,550 --> 02:08:08,050
maybe I do hire someone to help me 
shoot.

3247
02:08:08,110 --> 02:08:11,080
Maybe I do higher bandwidth.
What do you mean by a bank?

3248
02:08:11,140 --> 02:08:12,910
The bandwidth,
because I don't want people were like,

3249
02:08:12,911 --> 02:08:13,840
oh,
can we get a podcast?

3250
02:08:13,841 --> 02:08:15,220
Can we do more videos a week and stuff.
And I'm like,

3251
02:08:15,221 --> 02:08:16,054
that's not the vision for the product.
I only have enough bandwidth in my mind 

3252
02:08:18,380 --> 02:08:19,390
to.
Right.

3253
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:21,280
And it doesn't create time and space,
right.

3254
02:08:21,281 --> 02:08:22,590
And,
uh,

3255
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:23,433
the money gives me means in the future 
to maybe make the product more dynamic 

3256
02:08:26,951 --> 02:08:28,450
or interesting or hire people and do 
more.

3257
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:30,400
But right now I just want to spend a few
months to like,

3258
02:08:30,401 --> 02:08:31,630
be like,
this is what I'm planning,

3259
02:08:32,140 --> 02:08:33,880
I want to write these things,
I want to put care into them.

3260
02:08:33,881 --> 02:08:34,714
I want to give you citations.
I wanna like have you give you further 

3261
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,320
things to read and all those kinds of 
things.

3262
02:08:38,321 --> 02:08:40,450
And that takes time.
So you always like this,

3263
02:08:40,451 --> 02:08:42,160
like really hyped up and energetic.

3264
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:43,600
Do you always have like this much 
energy?

3265
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:46,750
You always talk this fast.
I'm a fast talker.

3266
02:08:46,751 --> 02:08:48,190
That's in New York thing,
but I'm a.

3267
02:08:48,750 --> 02:08:49,583
I used to live in New York.
You didn't know a lot of people that 

3268
02:08:50,651 --> 02:08:51,750
talked very fast.
They do it,

3269
02:08:51,751 --> 02:08:52,584
but you're like fucking ramped up.
It's because it's something I'm 

3270
02:08:55,180 --> 02:08:56,490
passionate about.
You know,

3271
02:08:56,500 --> 02:08:57,333
it's A.
I don't mean to come off as annoying or 

3272
02:08:58,511 --> 02:08:58,841
anything.
No,

3273
02:08:58,841 --> 02:08:59,170
no,
no.

3274
02:08:59,170 --> 02:09:01,090
You're not annoying at all.
It's impressive.

3275
02:09:01,120 --> 02:09:03,010
Thank you.
I just try to.

3276
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:06,940
These are the things that I forgot for 
so long in a way,

3277
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,590
because I was writing about games,
which I love.

3278
02:09:08,650 --> 02:09:09,880
I Love Games.
I think they're important.

3279
02:09:09,881 --> 02:09:11,740
They're an important piece of escape.
They're an important piece of art.

3280
02:09:11,950 --> 02:09:12,783
I think that's all great,
but being able to engage with someone 

3281
02:09:15,970 --> 02:09:20,020
like yourself with someone like Dave 
Rubin or someone like a Steven crowder,

3282
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:20,854
whoever it might be.

3283
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:22,690
I was on Glenn Beck's radio show last 
week.

3284
02:09:22,810 --> 02:09:26,030
It brings out an energy in me that I,
I didn't,

3285
02:09:26,050 --> 02:09:27,720
I was,
he wear boats.

3286
02:09:27,810 --> 02:09:28,870
I don't know.
I was on the phone,

3287
02:09:28,871 --> 02:09:31,000
so I have no,
he could have been naked for all and uh,

3288
02:09:31,150 --> 02:09:33,490
but it brings out an energy in me where 
I'm like,

3289
02:09:33,520 --> 02:09:36,940
I can finally engage with people that 
know what the fuck they're talking about

3290
02:09:36,941 --> 02:09:37,774
in this particular realm,
which I think is so exciting and so 

3291
02:09:39,551 --> 02:09:41,380
interesting and we can have,
you know,

3292
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:42,460
we had,
we debated,

3293
02:09:42,461 --> 02:09:44,050
we don't agree on everything.
I think that's awesome.

3294
02:09:44,300 --> 02:09:46,970
So that's really cool that you found,
uh,

3295
02:09:47,060 --> 02:09:47,893
a very big positive out of this.
Now you can express yourself more 

3296
02:09:50,171 --> 02:09:51,004
honestly and you can,
you can gravitate towards your real 

3297
02:09:54,401 --> 02:09:56,380
interests.
And yeah,

3298
02:09:56,381 --> 02:09:58,660
that's what I'm trying to do.
I'm trying to use this as an opportunity

3299
02:09:58,990 --> 02:09:59,823
for myself and try and use it as an 
opportunity to just carve out a little 

3300
02:10:02,440 --> 02:10:04,960
slice of the Internet,
however big or small it might be,

3301
02:10:05,320 --> 02:10:06,153
where we can affect some positive change
and like an idea ideas and learning and 

3302
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:10,263
free expression and free thought and 
making mistakes and disagreeing and all 

3303
02:10:13,481 --> 02:10:13,600
that.

3304
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:16,030
I think that's all great.
I want to use this as an example.

3305
02:10:16,031 --> 02:10:18,190
I want to get away from the Orthodoxy of
the gaming industry.

3306
02:10:18,191 --> 02:10:20,880
It's stifling and strangling and that's 
what you think.

3307
02:10:20,950 --> 02:10:23,140
Let's go back to that because why do you
think it is like that?

3308
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:28,800
Why is the gaming industry so hardcore 
ideologically left wing progressive like

3309
02:10:30,220 --> 02:10:32,560
no variations?
No room for debate.

3310
02:10:32,590 --> 02:10:33,530
Why is that?
Well,

3311
02:10:33,531 --> 02:10:36,260
I think it's portrayed.
It's like it all gets funneled through a

3312
02:10:36,261 --> 02:10:38,360
media that is,
that is hyper liberal,

3313
02:10:38,361 --> 02:10:38,811
right?
So it's,

3314
02:10:38,811 --> 02:10:42,290
it's similar in a way to what's going on
with the media in news and politics.

3315
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:44,840
These,
um,

3316
02:10:45,380 --> 02:10:46,213
you know,
underneath the surface of the gaming 

3317
02:10:47,691 --> 02:10:48,524
industry are,
there are plenty of conservatives and 

3318
02:10:49,131 --> 02:10:49,990
libertarians,
they,

3319
02:10:50,330 --> 02:10:51,560
they hide the.
Yeah,

3320
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:52,573
they do.
A lot of them.

3321
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:53,840
Oh,
I'm sorry.

3322
02:10:54,050 --> 02:10:54,890
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

3323
02:10:54,920 --> 02:10:56,660
I was going to say,
a lot of them talk to me.

3324
02:10:56,660 --> 02:10:57,493
I mean,
I know people that are like heads of 

3325
02:10:58,041 --> 02:10:58,874
studios that feel the way I do.
I know people that are in the trenches 

3326
02:11:01,101 --> 02:11:03,560
at Qa and doing very menial things that 
gaming studios,

3327
02:11:03,561 --> 02:11:04,850
I feel the way I do and everything in 
between.

3328
02:11:05,150 --> 02:11:08,060
I remember a GDC game developer 
conference in San Francisco,

3329
02:11:08,330 --> 02:11:11,180
which happens every spring.
Six or seven years ago,

3330
02:11:11,181 --> 02:11:12,014
a guy pulled me aside.
This the first time it ever happened to 

3331
02:11:13,131 --> 02:11:14,140
me,
and this was when I was kind of starting

3332
02:11:14,141 --> 02:11:16,610
to make a name for myself and he pulled 
me aside and he's like,

3333
02:11:16,611 --> 02:11:18,320
hey man,
I work at x,

3334
02:11:18,321 --> 02:11:20,720
Y andZ and um,
it works on a big game and he's like,

3335
02:11:20,930 --> 02:11:23,300
keep doing what you're doing.
There are a lot of people out there that

3336
02:11:23,390 --> 02:11:25,310
agree with what you're saying.
Um,

3337
02:11:25,340 --> 02:11:26,173
but they're,
they're,

3338
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:27,153
they,
they don't dare speak out because 

3339
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:31,280
they'll get lambasted in some way.

3340
02:11:31,280 --> 02:11:33,080
Look what happened to me over something 
so innocuous.

3341
02:11:33,200 --> 02:11:33,740
Well,
you there,

3342
02:11:33,740 --> 02:11:34,573
obviously you were saying that there is 
some pushback about your ideas before 

3343
02:11:38,361 --> 02:11:39,380
this.
Yes.

3344
02:11:39,470 --> 02:11:41,210
What did you experience?
Well,

3345
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:42,073
so every time I would write a 
politically driven an op Ed for 

3346
02:11:45,381 --> 02:11:46,250
instance,
when I was at ign,

3347
02:11:46,251 --> 02:11:47,050
I had,
I was,

3348
02:11:47,050 --> 02:11:47,883
I was senior editor,
but I kinda had like editor at large 

3349
02:11:49,670 --> 02:11:51,410
qualities were meaning for people I 
don't know,

3350
02:11:51,411 --> 02:11:52,244
editor at large,
basically in a way do whatever they 

3351
02:11:53,691 --> 02:11:54,524
want.
Like they'll find something to write 

3352
02:11:55,131 --> 02:11:56,810
about.
I used to go away for days at a time and

3353
02:11:56,811 --> 02:11:59,270
over research things and then write 
these big 50,000 word articles.

3354
02:11:59,710 --> 02:12:01,610
I'm 50,000 words.
Yeah.

3355
02:12:01,640 --> 02:12:03,260
The history of not that kind of time,
dude.

3356
02:12:03,290 --> 02:12:03,960
Well I,
I,

3357
02:12:03,960 --> 02:12:05,000
I did,
I carved it out.

3358
02:12:05,150 --> 02:12:07,940
But what about people reading it?
It was in five parts.

3359
02:12:08,900 --> 02:12:09,733
The history of naughty dog was like my 
opus naughty dog's this very huge 

3360
02:12:12,321 --> 02:12:14,210
actually in Santa Monica,
a very huge game developer,

3361
02:12:14,211 --> 02:12:15,170
very talented game developer.

3362
02:12:15,170 --> 02:12:18,350
I went and talked at 19 people,
got about a bunch of primary sources and

3363
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:20,930
and all these things and wrote this 
piece that I really cared about.

3364
02:12:21,020 --> 02:12:22,490
Um,
and so,

3365
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:25,760
but when I would write things like the 
political correctness piece about,

3366
02:12:26,220 --> 02:12:30,620
let me give you an example.
There's a game that was canceled a maybe

3367
02:12:30,621 --> 02:12:32,810
five years ago or so.
It was pretty late in development.

3368
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:33,793
So it's weird to have to cancel a when 
they've already spent a bunch of money 

3369
02:12:35,271 --> 02:12:36,104
on it.
It was called six days in Fallujah and 

3370
02:12:38,781 --> 02:12:41,060
it was a game about,
it was the third person shooter.

3371
02:12:41,061 --> 02:12:42,220
I think about,
uh,

3372
02:12:42,710 --> 02:12:44,510
the experience of Fallujah in Iraq,
you know,

3373
02:12:44,570 --> 02:12:46,340
terrible conflict that,
that happened there.

3374
02:12:47,150 --> 02:12:49,940
And people even on the right were 
getting upset about being like,

3375
02:12:49,941 --> 02:12:51,170
it's too soon.
It's,

3376
02:12:51,230 --> 02:12:52,063
it's,
uh,

3377
02:12:52,150 --> 02:12:53,810
this is,
this is still ongoing,

3378
02:12:53,990 --> 02:12:54,980
how can you do?

3379
02:12:55,220 --> 02:12:57,890
And I wrote a piece being like,
what are you all saying?

3380
02:12:57,920 --> 02:12:59,540
Like,
this is awesome,

3381
02:12:59,630 --> 02:13:02,320
this is so great that someone wants to 
tell a story like this and,

3382
02:13:02,330 --> 02:13:03,163
and,
and,

3383
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:05,840
and do something like this and you just 
get it from all sides.

3384
02:13:05,841 --> 02:13:07,460
People will be like,
you know,

3385
02:13:07,490 --> 02:13:09,110
it's,
it's not sensitive.

3386
02:13:09,111 --> 02:13:10,520
It's,
it's all of these kinds of things.

3387
02:13:10,521 --> 02:13:12,710
And then the girlfriend mode thing I 
wrote about where people were like,

3388
02:13:12,740 --> 02:13:13,573
oh,
you're a sexist and blah blah blah blah 

3389
02:13:14,301 --> 02:13:14,691
blah.
And I'm like,

3390
02:13:14,691 --> 02:13:15,524
I'm actually just protecting the 
sanctity of a man who might've made a 

3391
02:13:17,091 --> 02:13:18,650
mistake.
That's it,

3392
02:13:18,840 --> 02:13:21,020
you know,
instead of destroying him,

3393
02:13:21,260 --> 02:13:24,310
it goes back to this whole thing of,
like the last year that,

3394
02:13:24,311 --> 02:13:25,180
I'm sorry,
the,

3395
02:13:25,210 --> 02:13:26,043
the girlfriend mode,
the borderlands story I told you you 

3396
02:13:27,741 --> 02:13:28,574
were with the guy and they were all 
going after him and going after his job 

3397
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:31,320
and do these things.

3398
02:13:31,320 --> 02:13:32,520
And I wrote a piece being like,
hey,

3399
02:13:33,220 --> 02:13:35,450
yeah,
like if this is a far skies,

3400
02:13:35,480 --> 02:13:36,313
like he made a mistake maybe and I don't
know that he should have is a soft 

3401
02:13:40,351 --> 02:13:42,150
target and they just went after it.
Exactly.

3402
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:43,313
And uh,
it reminds you that you experienced 

3403
02:13:44,461 --> 02:13:45,400
blowback.
Yeah.

3404
02:13:45,410 --> 02:13:47,070
Every time from that.
Yeah.

3405
02:13:47,071 --> 02:13:48,420
Every time.
What was the blow back from that,

3406
02:13:48,421 --> 02:13:49,830
from you defending this guy saying,
well,

3407
02:13:49,831 --> 02:13:52,260
he just really fucked up the way he 
described things,

3408
02:13:52,261 --> 02:13:53,940
but he was,
it was an innocent in that regard.

3409
02:13:53,970 --> 02:13:54,803
Well,
you lose like social cache when every 

3410
02:13:56,011 --> 02:13:57,210
time it's something like this would 
happen.

3411
02:13:57,211 --> 02:13:58,044
Right,
so that's why I say like this was the 

3412
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:00,414
moment,
the joke was the moment that they were 

3413
02:14:01,501 --> 02:14:02,334
looking to pounce really,
and I'm not saying that they were 

3414
02:14:03,421 --> 02:14:04,560
calculating,
everyone's waiting,

3415
02:14:04,561 --> 02:14:05,394
but they saw an opportunity and they 
took it because over time you lose 

3416
02:14:08,461 --> 02:14:11,510
respect over people because of your 
political stances.

3417
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,270
He completely reasonable political 
stances I think where they remember that

3418
02:14:15,271 --> 02:14:17,940
you said this and he said this and he 
said this doesn't really,

3419
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:18,833
you weren't really having debates with 
people where you were disagreeing with 

3420
02:14:21,031 --> 02:14:21,864
them.
It was simply a matter of reaction to 

3421
02:14:23,041 --> 02:14:23,874
some of the things that you had written 
where they were trying to box you into 

3422
02:14:25,861 --> 02:14:27,440
some sort of a conservative group.
Right.

3423
02:14:27,450 --> 02:14:28,850
And they would call me in,
you know,

3424
02:14:29,010 --> 02:14:30,570
now it's like I'm a Nazi,
I'm all right.

3425
02:14:30,571 --> 02:14:31,231
I'm,
I'm like,

3426
02:14:31,231 --> 02:14:32,650
I don't think,
I don't think I have one.

3427
02:14:32,670 --> 02:14:33,503
I don't think I've won outright.
I don't even really know what the alt 

3428
02:14:36,031 --> 02:14:37,380
right means.
But like what,

3429
02:14:37,430 --> 02:14:40,680
like what is outright lying to me,
it seems like the far fringe is like the

3430
02:14:40,681 --> 02:14:41,514
Richard Spencer is of the world,
the Neo Nazis in the white supremacists 

3431
02:14:43,081 --> 02:14:44,660
and the actual,
uh,

3432
02:14:44,700 --> 02:14:46,000
nationalists,
you know.

3433
02:14:46,050 --> 02:14:47,880
Well,
as soon as you write alt on something,

3434
02:14:47,881 --> 02:14:49,590
I feel like it's a message board thing.

3435
02:14:49,650 --> 02:14:50,490
Like,
all right,

3436
02:14:50,580 --> 02:14:51,413
it's like,
it's a,

3437
02:14:51,560 --> 02:14:52,920
it's a reddit thing.
Yeah,

3438
02:14:53,550 --> 02:14:54,390
exactly.
So,

3439
02:14:54,391 --> 02:14:55,680
all right.
Alternative.

3440
02:14:55,681 --> 02:14:57,000
Right?
Like what is it?

3441
02:14:57,430 --> 02:14:57,921
I mean,
I,

3442
02:14:57,921 --> 02:14:58,754
I don't,
I don't know.

3443
02:15:00,140 --> 02:15:02,550
I hope not based on their,
based on their,

3444
02:15:02,580 --> 02:15:05,350
based on their characterization of it,
but to me.

3445
02:15:05,450 --> 02:15:06,060
I'm sorry,
go ahead.

3446
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:06,570
No.
Well,

3447
02:15:06,570 --> 02:15:07,940
what is a,
what,

3448
02:15:08,070 --> 02:15:09,690
how would they define you as being alt 
right?

3449
02:15:09,691 --> 02:15:12,120
What would they say that you have 
outright characteristics.

3450
02:15:12,150 --> 02:15:13,600
You can see these,
you know,

3451
02:15:13,850 --> 02:15:14,683
a message boards for instance,
a lot of people were very supportive on 

3452
02:15:16,711 --> 02:15:17,544
reddit and all these kinds of plays that
are a little more known for free 

3453
02:15:18,481 --> 02:15:19,950
thought.
But there's this one video game,

3454
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:22,030
a message board in particular,
um,

3455
02:15:22,410 --> 02:15:23,243
that is just insane.
And there was a hundred and 25 page or 

3456
02:15:27,211 --> 02:15:28,044
so thread about me,
20 posts or I think it might even be 50 

3457
02:15:30,121 --> 02:15:30,954
posts the page and I was reading it and 
it hurts some of it because people are 

3458
02:15:34,951 --> 02:15:35,731
like,
first of all,

3459
02:15:35,731 --> 02:15:37,890
people telling me I said things I never 
said one thing.

3460
02:15:38,130 --> 02:15:38,963
People like Collins against his name is 
no taxation is going to believe that 

3461
02:15:41,821 --> 02:15:42,654
taxes should exist.
He often talk about how I really like 

3462
02:15:44,611 --> 02:15:46,140
Ian Rand and I really like atlas 
shrugged,

3463
02:15:46,141 --> 02:15:47,580
but I don't consider myself an 
objectivist.

3464
02:15:47,581 --> 02:15:49,790
I don't believe that selfishness is 
necessarily a virtue.

3465
02:15:50,160 --> 02:15:52,740
I just think she's interesting and I 
think some of our ideas are interesting.

3466
02:15:53,040 --> 02:15:54,990
You know,
God forbid I exist somewhere in the gray

3467
02:15:54,991 --> 02:15:57,100
area,
but they're like collins and objective,

3468
02:15:57,130 --> 02:15:58,890
acidity,
selfish and blah blah blah.

3469
02:15:58,891 --> 02:16:01,800
And like collins a Nazi and he,
he's a racist.

3470
02:16:01,801 --> 02:16:02,970
He's a PSA.
I think the term,

3471
02:16:02,971 --> 02:16:05,040
a lot of the news with soft racist or 
soft bigot,

3472
02:16:05,070 --> 02:16:07,060
soft race being like that.
He,

3473
02:16:07,061 --> 02:16:07,894
he doesn't,
he doesn't intentionally or actually 

3474
02:16:09,601 --> 02:16:12,380
overtly say anything but supports causes
that are racist or sexist.

3475
02:16:12,600 --> 02:16:13,433
These are the kinds of characterizations
that were going on basically people 

3476
02:16:15,511 --> 02:16:16,344
with,
on,

3477
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:17,070
on,
on,

3478
02:16:17,070 --> 02:16:19,140
um,
on bulletin boards with,

3479
02:16:19,170 --> 02:16:22,290
with yarn and maps,
like that's how I picture them,

3480
02:16:22,291 --> 02:16:24,250
like trying to make continuous 
connections and,

3481
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:25,303
and,
and it's like these things aren't even 

3482
02:16:27,180 --> 02:16:30,070
things I feel and,
and things that I said or being

3483
02:16:30,070 --> 02:16:32,020
taken out of context.
I often use the,

3484
02:16:32,050 --> 02:16:34,760
I'm in video games.
One of the big things is like,

3485
02:16:34,770 --> 02:16:35,603
you know,
there's a need for diverse casts and 

3486
02:16:36,991 --> 02:16:38,800
diverse protagonists and stuff like 
that.

3487
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:41,350
And I often use the case that I used to 
use the saying,

3488
02:16:41,440 --> 02:16:43,780
I don't believe in diversity for 
diversity's sake.

3489
02:16:43,930 --> 02:16:45,670
I believe that an artist should tell his
story,

3490
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:47,260
so of an artist,
a writer,

3491
02:16:47,261 --> 02:16:48,094
and have a game,
wants to have an all white cast and 

3492
02:16:49,181 --> 02:16:51,520
that's what he thinks serves the story.
I don't think that makes them a racist.

3493
02:16:51,880 --> 02:16:52,713
If he wants to have an all Asian cast,
I don't think that makes them a racist 

3494
02:16:54,761 --> 02:16:56,290
either.
I think that's what he wants to do.

3495
02:16:56,730 --> 02:16:57,563
Um,
and people took that out of context and 

3496
02:16:58,841 --> 02:17:01,260
we're calling me a racist and a bigot.
And all these kinds of things and it's,

3497
02:17:01,261 --> 02:17:02,094
it's,
it's hurtful because there's no one 

3498
02:17:02,621 --> 02:17:03,040
there to,
that.

3499
02:17:03,040 --> 02:17:04,140
No one's defending me,
you know,

3500
02:17:04,180 --> 02:17:05,013
and I can't,
I can't defend myself because I'll just 

3501
02:17:05,801 --> 02:17:08,800
make it worse.
So it was kind of like this hapless kind

3502
02:17:08,801 --> 02:17:11,500
of situation that I found myself in and 
I tried to make the best of it.

3503
02:17:11,830 --> 02:17:16,720
I had a debate once about that with a 
friend who was an Asian actor and he was

3504
02:17:16,721 --> 02:17:17,554
talking about the lack of roles for 
Asians in Hollywood and what a massive 

3505
02:17:21,071 --> 02:17:23,710
issue is and you know that he wanted to 
raise awareness of it.

3506
02:17:24,130 --> 02:17:24,851
And I was like,
man,

3507
02:17:24,851 --> 02:17:26,800
but this,
we're talking about a creative venture.

3508
02:17:26,801 --> 02:17:28,540
You're talking about somebody writing a 
story.

3509
02:17:28,560 --> 02:17:29,393
Like I think the correct way to go about
it is to try to figure out how to get 

3510
02:17:32,681 --> 02:17:36,370
your own project through or someone else
who feels very strongly about this.

3511
02:17:36,371 --> 02:17:37,204
Trying to get their on project through,
but the right way is not for someone to 

3512
02:17:40,301 --> 02:17:41,134
have to compromise their creative vision
in order to encompass the full spectrum 

3513
02:17:44,261 --> 02:17:46,780
of races in whatever story they're 
writing.

3514
02:17:47,020 --> 02:17:47,853
Like creative story.
Like if you want to write a story about 

3515
02:17:50,141 --> 02:17:52,630
a small town in Maine,
like Stephen King has done so often,

3516
02:17:52,870 --> 02:17:55,750
you shouldn't have to have 10 percent 
Asians in that story.

3517
02:17:55,810 --> 02:17:56,643
I mean,
you just,

3518
02:17:56,680 --> 02:17:59,410
that's not what creativity is about.
It's about,

3519
02:17:59,440 --> 02:17:59,711
uh,
there,

3520
02:17:59,711 --> 02:18:04,600
there are places and people and the way 
you're going to run into all black folks

3521
02:18:04,840 --> 02:18:08,200
or were you going to run into all 
Norwegian people?

3522
02:18:08,201 --> 02:18:09,034
I mean,
in those stories are just as valid as a 

3523
02:18:10,691 --> 02:18:12,670
story that's fully diverse,
you know?

3524
02:18:12,750 --> 02:18:13,583
No,
I don't think that that necessarily 

3525
02:18:14,171 --> 02:18:15,004
makes anything better.
And I also think that when you're 

3526
02:18:17,861 --> 02:18:21,100
talking about that,
you're sort of talking about it.

3527
02:18:21,101 --> 02:18:24,190
Like there should be a quota,
you know,

3528
02:18:24,191 --> 02:18:29,020
and like Hollywood should recognize the 
need for these people to be in films and

3529
02:18:29,021 --> 02:18:30,320
movies and it's just,
you,

3530
02:18:30,330 --> 02:18:31,163
you're,
you're making this politically correct 

3531
02:18:34,180 --> 02:18:35,230
sort of,
um,

3532
02:18:36,120 --> 02:18:36,953
be passing these,
these judgements on this thing that is 

3533
02:18:39,881 --> 02:18:41,260
all about imagination.

3534
02:18:41,560 --> 02:18:43,150
I mean,
Hollywood essentially.

3535
02:18:43,151 --> 02:18:45,210
Like what,
when you're making a television show,

3536
02:18:45,240 --> 02:18:48,100
are you making a movie is really about 
an imagination.

3537
02:18:48,101 --> 02:18:48,934
It's about imagination and vision and 
having that vision being entertaining 

3538
02:18:52,061 --> 02:18:55,630
for people and if you like,
only want to write about the people that

3539
02:18:55,631 --> 02:18:56,464
you were in college with,
you were that you shared a dorm room 

3540
02:18:59,051 --> 02:18:59,884
with you should be out aloud to and if 
there's a disproportionate amount of 

3541
02:19:03,521 --> 02:19:04,354
people that are doing that,
that happened to be white males that we 

3542
02:19:07,361 --> 02:19:08,194
should probably try to figure out why,
but the idea that you have to force 

3543
02:19:11,741 --> 02:19:15,280
people to hire Asian folks or black 
folks or women or whatever.

3544
02:19:15,281 --> 02:19:16,900
That's.
That seems so crazy to me.

3545
02:19:17,160 --> 02:19:18,340
Serve the story.
Right,

3546
02:19:18,341 --> 02:19:21,610
and to give you a little glimpse,
to give you some context with what might

3547
02:19:21,611 --> 02:19:22,444
be going on in gaming.
There was this very popular game series 

3548
02:19:24,851 --> 02:19:25,684
called the Witcher,
which is made by a Polish developer 

3549
02:19:27,080 --> 02:19:28,070
called CD project.

3550
02:19:28,510 --> 02:19:29,343
I'm there in Warsaw and it's based on 
the fusion of like Polish kind of 

3551
02:19:33,530 --> 02:19:34,363
identity with this famous book series 
that's based on like kind of Polish or 

3552
02:19:38,070 --> 02:19:39,320
you know,
like kind of the Lord of the rings,

3553
02:19:39,321 --> 02:19:40,154
but in Eastern Europe and one guy is 
cartoon character that works at this 

3554
02:19:44,151 --> 02:19:48,500
website called Polygon.
In his review was talking about how uh,

3555
02:19:49,460 --> 02:19:50,293
there were no,
there was no diversity there and 

3556
02:19:52,940 --> 02:19:55,190
everyone's like,
dude,

3557
02:19:55,191 --> 02:19:56,024
it's Poland and it's based on Poland of 
your life and it's about dragons and 

3558
02:20:01,191 --> 02:20:02,024
like goblins and there's some white guys
and this is like what you're upset 

3559
02:20:05,391 --> 02:20:06,201
about,
you know,

3560
02:20:06,201 --> 02:20:09,980
and there's another guy making it and I 
think he's Slovakia and I don't want to.

3561
02:20:10,310 --> 02:20:14,120
Somewhere in eastern Europe making a 
game called kingdom come deliverance and

3562
02:20:14,121 --> 02:20:14,954
it's supposed to be very realistic.
Look at something like the 14th or 15th 

3563
02:20:17,001 --> 02:20:19,820
century in that area.
And again,

3564
02:20:19,880 --> 02:20:20,691
the,
they're complaining,

3565
02:20:20,691 --> 02:20:22,160
there's no diversity,
there's no diversity.

3566
02:20:22,160 --> 02:20:22,993
And he's like,
there was no black people in this area 

3567
02:20:26,480 --> 02:20:29,600
in 1500.
I'm trying to make a game that's true to

3568
02:20:29,601 --> 02:20:30,190
the air.
Does that,

3569
02:20:30,190 --> 02:20:32,660
that doesn't make him a racist.
And,

3570
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:35,000
and these are the kinds of.
This is just the kind of bullshit.

3571
02:20:35,001 --> 02:20:36,290
That's why.
But you see this in movies,

3572
02:20:36,291 --> 02:20:37,360
you see this in TV shows.
It's,

3573
02:20:37,420 --> 02:20:38,750
it's not exclusive to gaming,
but it's.

3574
02:20:39,200 --> 02:20:40,820
But it's what I've had to deal with for 
a long time.

3575
02:20:40,821 --> 02:20:42,140
And I'm just looking at the root of it 
though,

3576
02:20:42,150 --> 02:20:43,210
what,
what's causing it?

3577
02:20:43,240 --> 02:20:46,130
Like why,
why do people feel like they have to put

3578
02:20:46,190 --> 02:20:50,570
a black person in a game about Poland in
the 15 hundreds or whatever it was.

3579
02:20:50,810 --> 02:20:51,471
I think,
I mean,

3580
02:20:51,471 --> 02:20:53,060
I don't.
Thankfully,

3581
02:20:53,061 --> 02:20:54,500
the people that make the games don't 
care,

3582
02:20:54,570 --> 02:20:55,100
you know,
like they're,

3583
02:20:55,100 --> 02:20:56,090
they're like,
we're going to make our game,

3584
02:20:56,420 --> 02:20:57,253
right?
The people that are complaining about 

3585
02:20:58,401 --> 02:20:59,750
it,
there are virtuous virtue signaling,

3586
02:20:59,751 --> 02:21:02,840
which is not even a term I even knew 
what it meant until a few weeks ago.

3587
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:04,700
Like,
I heard people throw that term around.

3588
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:06,530
I didn't quite know what a man I looked 
at it,

3589
02:21:06,531 --> 02:21:08,030
I looked into it.
It's,

3590
02:21:08,050 --> 02:21:08,990
you know,
and you know what it is.

3591
02:21:08,991 --> 02:21:11,360
It's the idea that these virtuous 
people,

3592
02:21:11,361 --> 02:21:12,680
it's the same people that attacked me 
for the joke.

3593
02:21:13,100 --> 02:21:16,190
I have to be virtuous and show that I am
against sexism.

3594
02:21:16,191 --> 02:21:18,050
So I have to attack the man.
You know,

3595
02:21:18,051 --> 02:21:20,530
I have to do all these kinds of things 
in this need,

3596
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:21,710
you know?
But what they're saying,

3597
02:21:21,711 --> 02:21:22,370
when they,
when they,

3598
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:26,300
when they're saying we have to have 
black people in this game,

3599
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:29,570
in eastern Europe in the 15 hundreds,
what they're saying,

3600
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,400
what they're really saying is,
you're a racist.

3601
02:21:31,980 --> 02:21:32,720
Yeah.
That's the,

3602
02:21:32,720 --> 02:21:33,553
that's the subtext.
And it goes back to this character 

3603
02:21:34,881 --> 02:21:37,380
assassination in this need to destroy.
Um,

3604
02:21:37,460 --> 02:21:38,293
I often use the example of you.
Do you remember when Gawker wrote about 

3605
02:21:40,490 --> 02:21:43,220
Conde Nast as a CFO and outed them?

3606
02:21:43,430 --> 02:21:44,780
No,
I don't know what that story is.

3607
02:21:44,781 --> 02:21:48,170
So sad story,
but it's so on Gawker.

3608
02:21:48,230 --> 02:21:51,860
This guy wrote this story about,
uh,

3609
02:21:52,110 --> 02:21:54,260
the CFO of Conde Nast.
What does that.

3610
02:21:54,290 --> 02:21:56,810
Conde Nast is like this big conglomerate
that owns a bunch of,

3611
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:57,890
uh,
like,

3612
02:21:57,891 --> 02:21:59,000
you know,
smaller businesses.

3613
02:21:59,001 --> 02:21:59,990
They're,
they're pretty big company.

3614
02:21:59,991 --> 02:22:00,950
I don't know.
I think they,

3615
02:22:00,990 --> 02:22:02,140
I think they might even be in 
publishing,

3616
02:22:02,180 --> 02:22:03,013
stuff like that.
Okay.

3617
02:22:03,710 --> 02:22:04,543
And,
uh,

3618
02:22:05,480 --> 02:22:08,690
so they wrote this story and the entire 
crux of the story.

3619
02:22:08,691 --> 02:22:09,680
This guy that.
No one,

3620
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:10,583
this guy,
I think his brother or brother in law 

3621
02:22:12,440 --> 02:22:13,970
with Timothy Geithner.
So that's his,

3622
02:22:13,971 --> 02:22:14,804
that's his claim to fame I guess,
but he's just a private citizen that 

3623
02:22:16,401 --> 02:22:21,110
works as a cfo of a big corporation.
They write this piece,

3624
02:22:21,200 --> 02:22:22,033
that outcome as a gay man that he's 
having or trying to have an affair 

3625
02:22:24,861 --> 02:22:26,910
behind.
His wife's back with this guy,

3626
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:29,370
all of this stuff just.

3627
02:22:29,850 --> 02:22:30,840
And I'm like,
I read this piece.

3628
02:22:30,841 --> 02:22:33,090
I'm like,
what is the purpose of this?

3629
02:22:33,750 --> 02:22:35,370
Why?
And I'm sure Jamie,

3630
02:22:35,371 --> 02:22:36,630
if you want to,
you can probably find it.

3631
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:40,530
I did the why did they write it?
I'm clicks,

3632
02:22:41,220 --> 02:22:41,621
you know,
and,

3633
02:22:41,621 --> 02:22:42,454
and it actually blew up in their faces.
People are fucking furious about this 

3634
02:22:43,891 --> 02:22:47,550
because this wasn't yet.
So the,

3635
02:22:47,560 --> 02:22:49,350
there's the uh,
the thing,

3636
02:22:49,351 --> 02:22:54,300
it's like they just out this guy for no 
reason to steroid his life.

3637
02:22:54,390 --> 02:22:57,300
Gawker on Thursday evening helped as 
Grunfeld sex worker,

3638
02:22:57,330 --> 02:23:00,750
extort the chief financial officer at 
Conde Nast and brother,

3639
02:23:00,751 --> 02:23:03,000
a former treasury,
treasury secretary,

3640
02:23:03,240 --> 02:23:05,610
Kim Geitner that has his name.
Tim Geithner.

3641
02:23:05,611 --> 02:23:07,080
Yep.
Jensen,

3642
02:23:07,090 --> 02:23:07,923
ing.
Any semblance of journalistic integrity 

3643
02:23:09,361 --> 02:23:11,550
and likely ruining a man's life in the 
process.

3644
02:23:12,510 --> 02:23:13,343
I'm telling you,
you can go jump down the rabbit hole 

3645
02:23:14,461 --> 02:23:15,294
this read about this guy.
This is such an example of outrage of 

3646
02:23:17,750 --> 02:23:18,040
not even.

3647
02:23:18,040 --> 02:23:21,150
I already told you I've just character 
assassination for sake to remember this.

3648
02:23:21,210 --> 02:23:22,920
Now I'm kind of remembering the story.
It's almost,

3649
02:23:22,921 --> 02:23:25,500
it's unfortunate.
There's so many fucking crazy stories.

3650
02:23:25,501 --> 02:23:25,921
So it's,
yeah,

3651
02:23:25,921 --> 02:23:27,010
it says,
uh,

3652
02:23:27,480 --> 02:23:28,313
he is married and has three children 
allegedly arrange a night with a male 

3653
02:23:31,111 --> 02:23:31,944
escort.
On a recent trip to Chicago when the 

3654
02:23:32,851 --> 02:23:33,684
escort found out who the CFO was,
he asked for help with an ongoing 

3655
02:23:36,511 --> 02:23:37,710
housing dispute.
In other words,

3656
02:23:37,711 --> 02:23:38,544
trying to kick it to the government 
because of his connection with Geitner 

3657
02:23:40,620 --> 02:23:41,011
CFO.
Allegedly,

3658
02:23:41,011 --> 02:23:42,330
he got spooked and canceled their 
meeting,

3659
02:23:42,331 --> 02:23:43,164
though he paid in full for the,
for whatever rendezvous they were going 

3660
02:23:45,391 --> 02:23:47,610
to have in retaliation.
The escort went to Gawker,

3661
02:23:47,730 --> 02:23:48,563
which published the story despite 
knowing that doing so would play into 

3662
02:23:50,491 --> 02:23:53,190
the extortion attempts.
The site also publish screenshots of the

3663
02:23:53,191 --> 02:23:54,390
pairs,
alleged text message exchange,

3664
02:23:54,391 --> 02:23:55,560
including several photos.

3665
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:58,980
They shook this guy down and ruined him,
ruined him,

3666
02:23:58,981 --> 02:23:59,814
ruined you.
Probably he's going to have problems 

3667
02:24:01,141 --> 02:24:02,850
with his wife,
probably get the forest now.

3668
02:24:02,851 --> 02:24:03,684
His kids are going to be in limbo.
He's gonna lose his job and he's got to 

3669
02:24:05,191 --> 02:24:07,230
follow them around forever.
Why?

3670
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,240
Right.
Because he tried to,

3671
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:10,213
you know,
it's not our business if he's cheating 

3672
02:24:10,801 --> 02:24:12,980
on his wife and it's not our business.
If he's gay and it's our business,

3673
02:24:12,981 --> 02:24:14,940
if he's trying to have him be with a 
male escort,

3674
02:24:15,130 --> 02:24:16,620
they saw clickbait.
Yup.

3675
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:18,780
And this is,
and this is what it's all about.

3676
02:24:18,781 --> 02:24:20,880
It's to say I would even go further with
Gawker,

3677
02:24:20,881 --> 02:24:23,250
which obviously ended up taking him down
with Hulk Hogan.

3678
02:24:23,550 --> 02:24:24,390
It's like,
why?

3679
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:27,000
Because he's a famous person to his sex 
tape,

3680
02:24:27,030 --> 02:24:27,863
which is going to ruin his friendship,
ruined his marriage and all of these 

3681
02:24:28,981 --> 02:24:29,814
connections.
What kind of pleasure do you get out of 

3682
02:24:31,471 --> 02:24:32,070
that?

3683
02:24:32,070 --> 02:24:35,180
That goes back to the point I was making
about how I wouldn't write stories about

3684
02:24:35,180 --> 02:24:37,320
a couple people back in the day because 
I didn't want to ruin them.

3685
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:40,520
That's not what I'm out to do and I feel
like that.

3686
02:24:40,550 --> 02:24:41,383
So it all plays into the same culture,
the same culture of character 

3687
02:24:44,341 --> 02:24:45,990
assassination,
Neil puritanism,

3688
02:24:45,991 --> 02:24:49,290
witch hunting,
enjoying irresponsibility.

3689
02:24:49,460 --> 02:24:50,293
There's a responsibility that comes with
this that there's almost like a power 

3690
02:24:54,061 --> 02:24:54,894
that has not been earned.
This the power of whether it's social 

3691
02:24:57,511 --> 02:24:58,344
media,
whether it's the ability to write blogs 

3692
02:24:59,341 --> 02:25:01,650
about someone like that or whether it's 
ability to,

3693
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:03,000
uh,
just to,

3694
02:25:03,230 --> 02:25:07,530
to make tweets and just a attack,
someone that this,

3695
02:25:07,650 --> 02:25:10,020
this,
this ability is really very,

3696
02:25:10,021 --> 02:25:13,050
very new and the ability to mass 
published,

3697
02:25:13,051 --> 02:25:13,884
like to make a tweet about a guy like 
you just decide Collin Moriarty is a 

3698
02:25:17,281 --> 02:25:18,114
piece of shit.
I can't believe that joke fucking 

3699
02:25:20,551 --> 02:25:21,960
sexist.
And then boom,

3700
02:25:21,961 --> 02:25:24,010
put that out there.
And then it gets retweeted over and

3701
02:25:24,010 --> 02:25:24,843
over again like that.
People don't necessarily understand the 

3702
02:25:27,311 --> 02:25:30,440
repercussions of these actions that this
is like there,

3703
02:25:30,450 --> 02:25:31,283
there's,
there's an amount of power that they 

3704
02:25:32,561 --> 02:25:33,394
really haven't earned.
This amount of power and influence that 

3705
02:25:36,440 --> 02:25:39,940
you,
that you have in your ability to express

3706
02:25:39,941 --> 02:25:42,010
yourself today.
That's a really new thing.

3707
02:25:42,310 --> 02:25:44,380
I look at it a little differently in the
sense that.

3708
02:25:44,620 --> 02:25:46,390
Because I think you're right,
I think you're onto something there,

3709
02:25:46,630 --> 02:25:48,680
but I think it's also the mob mentality 
that it's,

3710
02:25:48,910 --> 02:25:53,170
that exposes the fact that say I was 
ruined forever.

3711
02:25:53,290 --> 02:25:55,630
Right?
And they won whatever that means.

3712
02:25:56,050 --> 02:25:56,950
And then people go like,
hey,

3713
02:25:56,951 --> 02:25:58,660
you just ruin that guy.
Why did you do that?

3714
02:25:58,661 --> 02:25:59,494
And they'd be like,
oh,

3715
02:25:59,530 --> 02:26:00,363
he did it.
Oh,

3716
02:26:00,400 --> 02:26:01,121
he did it.
Oh,

3717
02:26:01,121 --> 02:26:01,840
he did it.
He did.

3718
02:26:01,840 --> 02:26:03,400
In other words,
no one's responsible for it.

3719
02:26:03,700 --> 02:26:06,040
And when you're,
when you're in this mob,

3720
02:26:06,041 --> 02:26:06,874
it's like,
it's like it's,

3721
02:26:07,030 --> 02:26:07,863
it's old fashioned witch hunting and 
it's done for strangely puritanical 

3722
02:26:11,261 --> 02:26:11,650
reasons.

3723
02:26:11,650 --> 02:26:12,483
That's.
Do you think that there's also an 

3724
02:26:13,331 --> 02:26:15,910
inclination to do it because you're 
worried that it's going to happen to you

3725
02:26:15,940 --> 02:26:16,773
and you want to attack first feel like 
there's almost a thing where the people 

3726
02:26:19,151 --> 02:26:20,620
want to take the,
the,

3727
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:24,020
the vision off of themselves or they,
they want to take the,

3728
02:26:24,070 --> 02:26:27,000
the,
the scrutiny of themselves point.

3729
02:26:27,001 --> 02:26:27,834
And when you pointed at someone else 
enough and you keep pointing at other 

3730
02:26:29,681 --> 02:26:30,580
people,
they.

3731
02:26:30,850 --> 02:26:33,490
I mean eventually people kind of get it 
after awhile,

3732
02:26:33,910 --> 02:26:34,743
but like is that a little expression 
that if you want to look at like the 

3733
02:26:39,160 --> 02:26:40,090
with,
with girls,

3734
02:26:40,091 --> 02:26:40,924
it was always like the girls who would 
talk shit about other girls being sluts 

3735
02:26:42,671 --> 02:26:44,230
were always the biggest slots.
Right.

3736
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:45,093
You know,
I mean there's this weird thing about 

3737
02:26:46,570 --> 02:26:51,570
people where if you're going after folks
and a lot of those sort of situations,

3738
02:26:52,391 --> 02:26:55,540
what you're trying to do is take some of
the eyes off of you.

3739
02:26:56,140 --> 02:26:58,600
I think that that's probably a huge 
element of it.

3740
02:26:58,690 --> 02:26:59,523
I find it strange because I went about 
my business in a different way for the 

3741
02:27:01,871 --> 02:27:03,160
same reason,
if that makes any sense.

3742
02:27:03,161 --> 02:27:05,920
So it's like I don't want to.
You're making the argument,

3743
02:27:05,921 --> 02:27:06,754
which I think is true that it's like 
don't pay attention to the man behind 

3744
02:27:08,111 --> 02:27:08,944
the curtain.
Like there's all of this stuff over 

3745
02:27:10,301 --> 02:27:13,770
there and my whole thing was like,
I don't want to be involved in this,

3746
02:27:13,910 --> 02:27:14,860
get that,
get that.

3747
02:27:14,861 --> 02:27:16,870
And I believe you that you don't want to
be involved in that.

3748
02:27:16,871 --> 02:27:17,704
And I think that's very virtuous.
I think it's very nice that you think 

3749
02:27:20,321 --> 02:27:21,700
the way you do,
I think it's important,

3750
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:23,420
um,
and I think it's important that you,

3751
02:27:23,430 --> 02:27:24,263
you have this ability to express 
yourself and let people know that that 

3752
02:27:25,781 --> 02:27:26,614
is a good way to look at the,
the least amount of conflict that you 

3753
02:27:29,381 --> 02:27:30,214
can go through life with the better 
you're going to be off as long as it's 

3754
02:27:33,080 --> 02:27:34,780
in unnecessary conflict.

3755
02:27:34,870 --> 02:27:36,640
You know,
and I think in this situation,

3756
02:27:36,641 --> 02:27:39,610
this is clearly unnecessary conflict.
Yeah.

3757
02:27:39,611 --> 02:27:40,690
And,
and that's the,

3758
02:27:40,720 --> 02:27:42,400
that's the whole it.
And it causes this,

3759
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:43,713
this rigorous kind of atmosphere where 
we can see it in politics to where 

3760
02:27:48,100 --> 02:27:50,890
everyone's mad about everything.
Like Donald trump reads everyone's mad.

3761
02:27:51,070 --> 02:27:52,340
Donald Trump read the day,
uh,

3762
02:27:52,420 --> 02:27:52,980
uh,
the,

3763
02:27:52,980 --> 02:27:53,813
the,
the picture that's going around on CNN 

3764
02:27:54,481 --> 02:27:55,510
and where it's like,
it was literally like,

3765
02:27:55,550 --> 02:27:59,080
is Donald Trump afraid of stairs?
Was like the Kyron the lower third.

3766
02:27:59,560 --> 02:28:00,393
And it's like,
and it's like stairs and it's like furs 

3767
02:28:02,620 --> 02:28:03,430
elevators.
Yeah.

3768
02:28:03,430 --> 02:28:05,830
He prefers gilded elevators,
but that they're,

3769
02:28:05,850 --> 02:28:07,510
they're serious.
Real question.

3770
02:28:07,511 --> 02:28:07,871
This is,
yeah,

3771
02:28:07,871 --> 02:28:08,990
this is the kind of stuff that's going 
on.

3772
02:28:08,991 --> 02:28:11,920
And so when you say s,
t a I r or s,

3773
02:28:11,930 --> 02:28:12,350
t,
no,

3774
02:28:12,350 --> 02:28:13,183
stairs,
you walk up and down and down and the 

3775
02:28:14,830 --> 02:28:16,880
ars because it can be like the evil 
eyes.

3776
02:28:18,160 --> 02:28:19,660
But uh,
to me I'm like,

3777
02:28:19,690 --> 02:28:20,111
uh,
you know,

3778
02:28:20,111 --> 02:28:21,410
and that's why it goes,
you know,

3779
02:28:21,480 --> 02:28:22,250
the,
the fact

3780
02:28:22,250 --> 02:28:23,083
is,
and I think this is an important 

3781
02:28:23,301 --> 02:28:24,134
component to maybe making you understand
what happened a little bit better 

3782
02:28:25,701 --> 02:28:27,260
because you're not in the,
in that ecosystem,

3783
02:28:27,290 --> 02:28:29,810
but I think you can relate because 
you're seeing it happen elsewhere,

3784
02:28:30,320 --> 02:28:31,153
is that the gaming media is dying and 
they're dying because no one really 

3785
02:28:35,841 --> 02:28:36,674
trusts or cares.
Trust them or cares what they have to 

3786
02:28:38,391 --> 02:28:39,800
say anymore.
People.

3787
02:28:39,980 --> 02:28:42,080
Ten year olds and 15 year olds today are
not growing up being like,

3788
02:28:42,081 --> 02:28:44,540
I wonder what polygon has to say about 
the newest game.

3789
02:28:44,541 --> 02:28:47,870
They go to youtube and find a guy there 
that they trust and believe,

3790
02:28:48,200 --> 02:28:49,033
which is why the only people unanimously
pretty much that came out in my defense 

3791
02:28:51,201 --> 02:28:52,034
where you tubers,
because they know that they're the next 

3792
02:28:54,920 --> 02:28:55,753
rung of this evolution of the way we 
absorb and communicate and absorb 

3793
02:28:59,031 --> 02:28:59,864
information.
And have news meanwhile these people to 

3794
02:29:01,491 --> 02:29:02,510
your point or writing,
clickbait,

3795
02:29:02,511 --> 02:29:03,344
trying to stay relevant,
but no one really cares what they're 

3796
02:29:04,491 --> 02:29:06,230
saying anyway,
so they're in their death throws.

3797
02:29:06,590 --> 02:29:09,020
This is a way for them to take shots at 
multiple people at the same time.

3798
02:29:09,021 --> 02:29:10,250
This is what they did,
a Pewdie Pie.

3799
02:29:10,251 --> 02:29:12,530
This is what they did to other people 
and put pie.

3800
02:29:12,531 --> 02:29:14,540
One was really egregious.
It was agreed to split.

3801
02:29:14,570 --> 02:29:15,403
But like again,
a lot of that stuff was taken out of 

3802
02:29:17,691 --> 02:29:18,524
context and a lot of auto mean.
Pewdiepie always agreed the attacks on 

3803
02:29:22,521 --> 02:29:22,880
him.
Oh,

3804
02:29:22,880 --> 02:29:24,710
it was terrible what Wall Street Journal
did to him.

3805
02:29:24,860 --> 02:29:25,693
This is just the sign of the Times.
These are people fighting and I really 

3806
02:29:28,041 --> 02:29:28,874
feel this way and you might disagree,
but I feel like a lot of it is these 

3807
02:29:31,011 --> 02:29:32,930
people are fighting for their lives.
If I were,

3808
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:35,320
if I were a person that was trending up,
hold on a journalist.

3809
02:29:35,321 --> 02:29:36,050
The journalist.
Yeah.

3810
02:29:36,050 --> 02:29:37,070
Yeah.
Like if I were.

3811
02:29:37,071 --> 02:29:41,070
I'm sorry to to interrupt you.
If I were right,

3812
02:29:41,090 --> 02:29:43,370
if I had written in the video game 
industry for 10 years,

3813
02:29:43,430 --> 02:29:43,790
right.

3814
02:29:43,790 --> 02:29:45,530
I wrote the gaming industry for 14 
years,

3815
02:29:45,710 --> 02:29:46,543
but how is a 10 year industry veteran 
and I had fewer than 10,000 twitter 

3816
02:29:50,751 --> 02:29:51,584
followers and I'm writing for a site.
No one reads and I'm trying my hardest 

3817
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:55,543
to stay relevant and to do my thing.
I'd be pretty mad too if I saw a guy 

3818
02:29:58,461 --> 02:30:02,120
that turns on his camera and speaks 
whatever he wants and gets the amount of

3819
02:30:02,121 --> 02:30:04,490
views in 30 minutes,
then I'll get the entire year.

3820
02:30:04,520 --> 02:30:06,440
Why would you be men?
Because it's nothing to do with you,

3821
02:30:06,540 --> 02:30:07,373
but what does it has a lot to do with 
you because there's only so much time 

3822
02:30:09,051 --> 02:30:09,884
and space for these people to absorb 
things and they'd rather famine 

3823
02:30:11,601 --> 02:30:13,110
mentality.
They'd rather go to youtube.

3824
02:30:13,170 --> 02:30:15,680
Three hundred and $50.
Million people in this country alone and

3825
02:30:15,681 --> 02:30:17,870
there's many,
many more people over over the world.

3826
02:30:17,990 --> 02:30:22,160
The idea that anybody's views is somehow
or another taking away from your views.

3827
02:30:22,300 --> 02:30:23,133
It was just straight famine mentality.
Has plenty of eyes to go around and 

3828
02:30:25,881 --> 02:30:28,070
you're showing it right now with your 
new project.

3829
02:30:28,100 --> 02:30:29,870
Sure.
But I'm just like.

3830
02:30:29,990 --> 02:30:33,020
But I'm just saying like their.
Their thought process sucks.

3831
02:30:33,140 --> 02:30:33,973
Yeah,
and extensively it's actually adding to 

3832
02:30:35,841 --> 02:30:36,674
their destruction because people are 
looking at this like the media for 

3833
02:30:39,591 --> 02:30:41,330
instance,
in political and the political landscape

3834
02:30:41,331 --> 02:30:43,370
is dying anyway that the decline is 
happening.

3835
02:30:43,380 --> 02:30:44,213
Wall Street Journal put up a piece not 
too long ago saying that per capita of 

3836
02:30:47,600 --> 02:30:50,390
viewership on television is actually 
starting to be outpaced by youtube.

3837
02:30:50,840 --> 02:30:52,130
So that's over now.
Right.

3838
02:30:52,131 --> 02:30:54,890
So like now that's not on video online 
or video on demand.

3839
02:30:54,891 --> 02:30:55,724
That's just youtube.
And so people are looking at the 

3840
02:30:58,101 --> 02:30:58,934
situation and actually precipitated that
happening quicker because in order to 

3841
02:31:02,031 --> 02:31:04,370
stay relevant they lie.
Are they pieces?

3842
02:31:04,371 --> 02:31:06,770
I think we should talk about what 
happened with [inaudible].

3843
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:07,833
Most people are like,
who the fuck is put shy and what 

3844
02:31:09,381 --> 02:31:10,214
happened?
Sure.

3845
02:31:10,490 --> 02:31:13,290
Do you want me to send it to you have to
do is so pewdie pie is,

3846
02:31:13,310 --> 02:31:18,310
is the biggest youtuber in the world.
He has 55 million subscribers and he's a

3847
02:31:18,471 --> 02:31:21,180
millionaire.
I'm just to be clear,

3848
02:31:21,181 --> 02:31:22,530
I've never,
I don't really know him very well.

3849
02:31:22,531 --> 02:31:24,300
I think I've had one or two communicates
with him at some point,

3850
02:31:24,301 --> 02:31:24,840
but,
um,

3851
02:31:24,840 --> 02:31:25,321
I don't know.
Um,

3852
02:31:25,321 --> 02:31:26,460
so I don't really have a horse in the 
race.

3853
02:31:27,040 --> 02:31:28,530
Uh,
he lives in Europe.

3854
02:31:28,531 --> 02:31:29,364
He lives in England,
I think he's Swedish or something of 

3855
02:31:31,291 --> 02:31:32,124
that nature,
but he lives in England and he has a 

3856
02:31:34,441 --> 02:31:36,450
massive youtube following me in every 
video he does.

3857
02:31:36,451 --> 02:31:37,650
We'll have 10,
12,

3858
02:31:37,651 --> 02:31:39,860
15 million views and you know,
you're on youtube.

3859
02:31:39,861 --> 02:31:42,200
I'm on youtube and a much lesser sense 
that's a lot of use.

3860
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:44,333
And he pushed the boundaries in some 
ways and some tasteless ways as this is 

3861
02:31:49,321 --> 02:31:50,154
right.
And the thing that really caught on was 

3862
02:31:51,931 --> 02:31:54,530
that he was using this,
this app or this,

3863
02:31:54,531 --> 02:31:55,950
this,
this service called Fiverr,

3864
02:31:56,370 --> 02:31:57,203
which is this kind of task rabbit kind 
of thing where it's like you can pay 

3865
02:31:59,371 --> 02:32:02,130
people to do whatever you want,
any paid.

3866
02:32:02,990 --> 02:32:04,530
Some of the things he did were 
otherwise,

3867
02:32:04,531 --> 02:32:06,840
but he paid these guys and some country 
to hold up these,

3868
02:32:06,841 --> 02:32:07,674
uh,
like death to all Jews signs or 

3869
02:32:09,541 --> 02:32:11,750
something like that as part of a joke.
Um,

3870
02:32:12,120 --> 02:32:13,110
and uh,
you know,

3871
02:32:13,111 --> 02:32:14,790
and that's something I think is somewhat
tasteless,

3872
02:32:15,420 --> 02:32:17,310
but he's trying to make a point,
whatever point he was trying to make,

3873
02:32:17,311 --> 02:32:18,144
he's trying to make a point.
It was lost on a lot of people and this 

3874
02:32:19,441 --> 02:32:20,274
combined with some other imagery he had 
been using some kind of fascist or Nazi 

3875
02:32:23,191 --> 02:32:25,290
imagery and some other things that have 
been going on over the months.

3876
02:32:25,410 --> 02:32:26,450
I'm sorry,
did you want.

3877
02:32:26,890 --> 02:32:27,810
Oh,
you about to say something.

3878
02:32:27,820 --> 02:32:29,130
I'm sorry.
And uh,

3879
02:32:29,370 --> 02:32:30,203
so eventually the Wall Street Journal 
caught wind of this Wall Street Journal 

3880
02:32:33,061 --> 02:32:35,190
obviously have a prolific right of 
center,

3881
02:32:35,191 --> 02:32:37,530
but still pretty moderate newspaper.
Um,

3882
02:32:37,620 --> 02:32:40,500
and basically went after,
been tried to basically tried to destroy

3883
02:32:40,520 --> 02:32:43,260
him and took a lot of things out of 
context.

3884
02:32:43,261 --> 02:32:44,094
Then forced Disney's Disney owns a 
studio that funds him and all these 

3885
02:32:48,541 --> 02:32:49,374
kinds of things and caused a lot of 
personal and economic destruction for 

3886
02:32:51,271 --> 02:32:52,104
this.
It seems like they intentionally took 

3887
02:32:52,501 --> 02:32:53,334
things out of context too,
and they distorted the actual intent of 

3888
02:32:55,741 --> 02:32:58,860
what he was trying to do,
especially with telling people to not be

3889
02:32:58,861 --> 02:32:59,694
Nazis.
He was mocking people that were being 

3890
02:33:02,041 --> 02:33:05,550
Nazis and they used that to say,
this guy is pretending to be a Nazi.

3891
02:33:05,640 --> 02:33:06,473
Right.
It was a completely dishonest hit piece 

3892
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:12,070
in the same vein as the conde nast hit 
the same vein as the whole Cogan head is

3893
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:12,870
the same.

3894
02:33:12,870 --> 02:33:13,521
It's,
it's,

3895
02:33:13,521 --> 02:33:14,640
it's,
it's these people,

3896
02:33:14,670 --> 02:33:15,503
they know the term punching up.
They want to punch up and they think 

3897
02:33:16,951 --> 02:33:17,784
they're punching up Wall Street 
Journal's punching up now on youtube 

3898
02:33:19,240 --> 02:33:20,073
years,
but really caused a lot hilarious 

3899
02:33:21,870 --> 02:33:24,640
punching up on a youtuber.
That's the way they look at it as not an

3900
02:33:24,641 --> 02:33:25,380
awareness.
It is.

3901
02:33:25,380 --> 02:33:28,320
This guy's a youtuber.
He's a guy by himself.

3902
02:33:28,321 --> 02:33:29,154
You're punching up to attack him because
he's the king because he's the media 

3903
02:33:32,071 --> 02:33:33,720
elite.
I mean that's the media elite.

3904
02:33:33,721 --> 02:33:37,650
I mean it's like an independent reporter
attacking the ABC news or something like

3905
02:33:37,651 --> 02:33:38,430
that.
Exactly.

3906
02:33:38,430 --> 02:33:39,960
And,
and to me it was like,

3907
02:33:39,961 --> 02:33:40,794
it showed a lot of cowardice.
It showed a lot of half cocked thinking 

3908
02:33:44,071 --> 02:33:44,904
on there on the Wall Street Journal's 
part to think that this was going to 

3909
02:33:45,961 --> 02:33:46,794
blow back on them and it showed a level,
and I hate using this word because I 

3910
02:33:50,401 --> 02:33:51,234
don't think innately it's necessarily a 
bad thing because I think it drives you 

3911
02:33:53,041 --> 02:33:53,874
forward,
but there's a level of jealousy at play 

3912
02:33:55,171 --> 02:33:56,640
with a lot of these kinds of things that
are happening.

3913
02:33:56,730 --> 02:33:57,563
What you were thinking about before when
you were saying that someone who is 

3914
02:33:59,701 --> 02:34:00,534
struggling to get 10,000 views and a 
story they write is going to look at a 

3915
02:34:03,961 --> 02:34:07,230
guy like this that can do one video 
where he talks about farts and he makes,

3916
02:34:07,650 --> 02:34:08,483
you know,
his 7 million views or something like 

3917
02:34:09,901 --> 02:34:10,734
that.
He makes 15 million a year or whatever 

3918
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:13,710
and they're met and they don't 
understand it.

3919
02:34:13,890 --> 02:34:15,060
And I get that.
You know,

3920
02:34:15,061 --> 02:34:17,440
I look at some people that are famous 
are some that are,

3921
02:34:17,441 --> 02:34:18,460
you know,
have a platform and I'm like,

3922
02:34:18,461 --> 02:34:19,294
I don't get this,
but I'm not going to like sit here and 

3923
02:34:20,261 --> 02:34:22,150
like rain on their parade.
That's their right.

3924
02:34:22,151 --> 02:34:23,740
They have an audience that's totally 
fine.

3925
02:34:23,920 --> 02:34:25,990
Maybe look at yourself and why you don't
have an audience.

3926
02:34:25,991 --> 02:34:28,750
Maybe you look at yourself and realize 
that you have you been doing this for so

3927
02:34:28,751 --> 02:34:29,950
long and you're so proud of that.

3928
02:34:30,160 --> 02:34:32,800
Why isn't anyone listening to you?
Could it be you,

3929
02:34:33,280 --> 02:34:35,740
you know,
instead of instead of looking around for

3930
02:34:35,741 --> 02:34:36,574
people to assassinate,
which is what's basically happening 

3931
02:34:38,201 --> 02:34:39,330
here.
Uh,

3932
02:34:39,790 --> 02:34:41,620
I just,
I find it's so distasteful.

3933
02:34:41,621 --> 02:34:42,454
I find it's so destructive.
We're at the precipice of a very 

3934
02:34:43,871 --> 02:34:47,680
dangerous time because the,
the trust in institutions,

3935
02:34:47,681 --> 02:34:50,500
no matter where you are now is just lost
and a lot of it has to do.

3936
02:34:50,501 --> 02:34:51,260
And,
and uh,

3937
02:34:51,260 --> 02:34:52,093
that's what I was saying with media 
precipitating the fall by not telling 

3938
02:34:55,961 --> 02:34:56,794
the truth by not doing the right thing.
I think the media in terms of pull it 

3939
02:35:01,060 --> 02:35:01,893
politics for instance,
is really rebounding from the fact that 

3940
02:35:03,521 --> 02:35:04,354
they thought Clinton was gonna win.
So they thought they can get away with 

3941
02:35:05,741 --> 02:35:08,440
saying and doing anything for that means
to an end.

3942
02:35:08,890 --> 02:35:10,480
The Donna Brazil,
for instance,

3943
02:35:10,630 --> 02:35:15,520
where she was feeding questions to the 
Clinton campaign is so incredible.

3944
02:35:15,940 --> 02:35:19,810
So shows such a level of bias and 
systemic inherent bias.

3945
02:35:20,260 --> 02:35:21,470
They thought they were going to get away
with all of it.

3946
02:35:21,490 --> 02:35:23,260
Now no one trusts anyone.
So when I see all this stuff,

3947
02:35:23,261 --> 02:35:24,094
I don't know what's going on with Russia
and trump for all I know he could be a 

3948
02:35:25,841 --> 02:35:27,670
fucking Manchurian candidate,
you know,

3949
02:35:27,970 --> 02:35:30,800
but I don't believe a word they say,
you know,

3950
02:35:30,830 --> 02:35:31,663
like when I read this about Paul 
Manafort about Flynn about blah blah 

3951
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:34,451
blah,
blah blah.

3952
02:35:34,451 --> 02:35:35,040
I'm like,
I don't know.

3953
02:35:35,040 --> 02:35:35,873
You will have about all this other shit.
I have no idea what you're talking 

3954
02:35:36,731 --> 02:35:37,450
about.
You know,

3955
02:35:37,450 --> 02:35:39,880
I have to really do my own research.
I don't even know who to trust anymore.

3956
02:35:40,090 --> 02:35:42,970
They did that to themselves and they 
precipitated their own downfall.

3957
02:35:43,120 --> 02:35:46,330
More and more people are going on 
youtube to listen to people like you,

3958
02:35:46,510 --> 02:35:47,320
to listen to people.

3959
02:35:47,320 --> 02:35:48,153
Even like Alex Jones.
So listen to Dave Rubin to listen to 

3960
02:35:49,870 --> 02:35:50,703
that problem.
It is a problem because usually if you 

3961
02:35:52,511 --> 02:35:53,480
listened in to me,
well you,

3962
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:55,960
it's a problem because you need people 
in the trenches that you trust.

3963
02:35:55,961 --> 02:35:57,490
You need someone in the press room at 
the White House,

3964
02:35:57,491 --> 02:35:59,680
you need someone in the app that is on 
the wire,

3965
02:35:59,681 --> 02:36:00,514
that is telling you the truth,
but when you can't even trust them 

3966
02:36:02,681 --> 02:36:03,514
anymore,
right?

3967
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:04,833
That's a big problem and that's when 
people go seek out alternative sources 

3968
02:36:07,301 --> 02:36:08,134
of news and information and 
entertainment and that's what's 

3969
02:36:09,551 --> 02:36:10,810
happening and that's why they're dying.

3970
02:36:10,850 --> 02:36:11,301
Yeah.
Well,

3971
02:36:11,301 --> 02:36:15,350
in many ways that you sure that big 
corporate model is in ensuring their own

3972
02:36:15,351 --> 02:36:16,184
demise.

3973
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:17,780
Absolutely,
and and it's,

3974
02:36:17,960 --> 02:36:19,940
it's the race for clicks.
It's the race for money.

3975
02:36:19,941 --> 02:36:22,070
It's the race for prominence.
That's the race for relevance

3976
02:36:22,460 --> 02:36:23,293
and not honesty,
not transparency and not a real 

3977
02:36:26,931 --> 02:36:31,400
objective sense of what the truth is and
what the actual facts of a story are.

3978
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:32,533
That's where journalism is a different 
thing now because it's now a 

3979
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,840
entertainment show.
It's an entertainment show that also has

3980
02:36:38,841 --> 02:36:41,180
the news in it,
but that's why the women are so hot.

3981
02:36:41,450 --> 02:36:42,283
That's why the women on Fox News are 
wearing these tiny little dresses and 

3982
02:36:45,021 --> 02:36:45,854
they have beautiful legs and heels on 
and they're talking about important 

3983
02:36:49,041 --> 02:36:49,874
issues,
but they're giving you a little bit an 

3984
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:51,450
Icandy why?

3985
02:36:52,040 --> 02:36:53,110
So transparency.
What I see,

3986
02:36:53,111 --> 02:36:53,980
that kind of stuff.
I'm like,

3987
02:36:54,050 --> 02:36:54,883
it was a very attractive woman.
I'm sure she knows what she's talking 

3988
02:36:56,411 --> 02:36:57,244
about,
but I know why.

3989
02:36:57,460 --> 02:36:58,840
I know why she sits at the end of the 
table.

3990
02:36:58,900 --> 02:36:59,780
I liked when they were,
they're aggressive

3991
02:36:59,790 --> 02:37:03,090
to look Megan Kelly,
she's attractive and she's aggressive.

3992
02:37:03,250 --> 02:37:04,740
She's smart.
That's what makes her sexy.

3993
02:37:04,860 --> 02:37:06,100
Yeah.
Talking about,

3994
02:37:06,390 --> 02:37:08,040
but uh,
you know.

3995
02:37:08,250 --> 02:37:08,991
Yeah.
So we're,

3996
02:37:08,991 --> 02:37:09,970
we're in this,
we're in this,

3997
02:37:10,020 --> 02:37:11,300
we're in this weird space,
you know,

3998
02:37:11,630 --> 02:37:13,230
we're in.
This is just very bizarre space.

3999
02:37:13,231 --> 02:37:14,064
Do you feel like this is like an almost 
an period in human communication that 

4000
02:37:17,031 --> 02:37:19,690
we're going through this weird growth 
period where we're,

4001
02:37:19,691 --> 02:37:23,000
we have this incredible access to 
information and the ability to spread it

4002
02:37:23,030 --> 02:37:23,863
like we have now with social media and 
with youtube and all these different 

4003
02:37:26,811 --> 02:37:27,644
things where anybody can kind of hop in 
and all of a sudden get a platform like 

4004
02:37:30,171 --> 02:37:34,310
this pd peg guy.
Pewdie pie wasn't a star,

4005
02:37:34,311 --> 02:37:36,620
it wasn't a politician.
He wasn't an actor before this.

4006
02:37:36,800 --> 02:37:37,633
It was just a guy and he connected with 
people and carved out this path for 

4007
02:37:40,671 --> 02:37:43,490
himself and pretty much anybody can kind
of do that now.

4008
02:37:43,491 --> 02:37:45,200
I mean there's.
It's not easy.

4009
02:37:45,230 --> 02:37:46,490
It's not.
If it was easy,

4010
02:37:46,491 --> 02:37:47,324
everyone would do it,
but it is not insurmountable and I 

4011
02:37:50,361 --> 02:37:51,194
wonder what the next stage is in terms 
of the ability to share information if 

4012
02:37:55,011 --> 02:37:58,700
it's going to change past where it's at 
now and get to some new level.

4013
02:37:59,080 --> 02:37:59,581
Yeah,
I think.

4014
02:37:59,581 --> 02:38:00,414
I think you're right in the sense that 
the Internet specifically had taken off 

4015
02:38:02,411 --> 02:38:05,470
so quickly.
The World Wide Web is only 24 years old.

4016
02:38:05,471 --> 02:38:06,304
The Internet's way older,
but the way we communicate with each 

4017
02:38:07,811 --> 02:38:08,644
other now is so different than even use 
net in the eighties or these kind of 

4018
02:38:13,510 --> 02:38:14,343
university university communications 
that they had going on in the seventies 

4019
02:38:16,571 --> 02:38:17,980
where they were sharing things with 
amongst each other.

4020
02:38:18,160 --> 02:38:20,500
You don't need gatekeepers anymore.
There are no gatekeepers.

4021
02:38:20,670 --> 02:38:22,960
You can go start a youtube channel now,
find an audience,

4022
02:38:22,961 --> 02:38:23,794
gain thousands subscribers,
make a lot of money and say what you 

4023
02:38:25,601 --> 02:38:26,434
want,
um,

4024
02:38:26,630 --> 02:38:27,463
and that's scary to the traditional 
gatekeepers and they don't like it and 

4025
02:38:30,941 --> 02:38:31,774
they're there for the fight against that
is so transparent and it's so self 

4026
02:38:34,381 --> 02:38:37,840
serving when I don't,
we need a media that we can trust,

4027
02:38:38,200 --> 02:38:41,620
but I don't think we need the media as 
it is right now either because the media

4028
02:38:41,621 --> 02:38:44,580
we have right now is bloated,
dishonest Po,

4029
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:47,200
a partisan,
politically motivated.

4030
02:38:47,410 --> 02:38:48,243
All of these things that don't really 
serve a purpose to educating and 

4031
02:38:50,171 --> 02:38:52,390
informing some of the days of cronkite 
are gone.

4032
02:38:52,520 --> 02:38:53,353
Well.
Doesn't that sort of set the stage for 

4033
02:38:54,441 --> 02:38:56,510
someone to come in and offer a viable 
alternative?

4034
02:38:56,810 --> 02:38:59,000
I hope so.
There you are calling moriarty.

4035
02:38:59,090 --> 02:38:59,900
Yeah,
that's,

4036
02:38:59,900 --> 02:39:02,250
that's the idea.
It's just in my own way like I don't,

4037
02:39:02,251 --> 02:39:03,084
I don't have these delusions of grandeur
that I'm going to make millions of 

4038
02:39:05,570 --> 02:39:09,680
dollars and have this huge reach already
at $39,000 a month.

4039
02:39:09,720 --> 02:39:11,640
You better cut the shit with this 
humility stuff.

4040
02:39:11,660 --> 02:39:12,920
I just,
I don't know what you're doing.

4041
02:39:13,050 --> 02:39:14,720
Know what you're doing.
You fuck stop.

4042
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:16,033
I've just,
I'm just trying to say that I didn't 

4043
02:39:16,791 --> 02:39:17,660
have,
I left my

4044
02:39:18,020 --> 02:39:19,380
making good money.
I own,

4045
02:39:19,400 --> 02:39:20,780
you know,
a kind of funny I,

4046
02:39:21,050 --> 02:39:21,883
I walked away expecting that I was going
take a pay cut to do what I really 

4047
02:39:23,931 --> 02:39:26,770
wanted to do and try to do the right 
thing and uh,

4048
02:39:26,850 --> 02:39:28,430
it's great that people are responding 
the way they do.

4049
02:39:28,431 --> 02:39:30,700
I hope they continue to respond this way
because it will allow us to do more,

4050
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:32,130
more of it.
My advice to you,

4051
02:39:32,131 --> 02:39:32,964
stop being concerned with that and just 
do the best of stopped being concerned 

4052
02:39:35,251 --> 02:39:37,830
with being humble about all this and it.
So it's definitely gonna drop.

4053
02:39:37,831 --> 02:39:39,190
It's definitely I'm going to make.
I'm not,

4054
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:40,110
I'm,
I'm not going to be payments.

4055
02:39:40,111 --> 02:39:42,180
I'm not going to be.
Forget about all that nonsense.

4056
02:39:42,360 --> 02:39:45,300
Well,
it's all like you're shackled yourself.

4057
02:39:45,600 --> 02:39:48,030
Just I'm just trying out forward young 
man.

4058
02:39:48,120 --> 02:39:49,710
I appreciate [inaudible] forward with 
intent.

4059
02:39:49,711 --> 02:39:50,990
You've got some good content,
man.

4060
02:39:50,991 --> 02:39:52,470
You're appreciated.
Thank you very much.

4061
02:39:52,500 --> 02:39:54,030
I appreciate it so much.
My pleasure,

4062
02:39:54,031 --> 02:39:55,140
man,
and thanks for coming on here,

4063
02:39:55,141 --> 02:39:56,010
man.
It was a good time.

4064
02:39:56,011 --> 02:39:57,010
I really enjoyed it.
Thank you.

4065
02:39:57,260 --> 02:39:58,570
Thank you.
I really appreciate you doing.

4066
02:39:58,590 --> 02:40:01,530
You do have a thing and it's.
It does go live in April.

4067
02:40:01,531 --> 02:40:02,364
I'd be happy to help you promote it and 
happy to have you back on again and it 

4068
02:40:04,741 --> 02:40:06,000
was really awesome.
Really enjoyed this.

4069
02:40:06,001 --> 02:40:07,700
Thank you so much.
I appreciate you calling moriarity.

4070
02:40:07,770 --> 02:40:08,603
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be back in a little while with my 

4071
02:40:10,531 --> 02:40:12,000
friend Justin wren.
See you soon.

4072
02:40:12,001 --> 02:40:14,040
Bye.
Was Great.

4073
02:40:14,850 --> 02:40:16,520
Thank you.
That was a lot of fun.
