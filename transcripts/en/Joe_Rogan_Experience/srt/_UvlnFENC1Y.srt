1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,060
The Joe Rogan experience.
So,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,520
so what is it with scientology?
Um,

3
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:07,060
that's a good question.
Um,

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,730
I don't know,
like if they have ceremonies,

5
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,370
if they,
I think when you look at that Tom cruise

6
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:15,890
recruitment video,
which is fucking fantastic,

7
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,900
you know,
when he's standing out there,

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,300
if you've seen the one where they give
them a metal guests,

9
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,080
which is she fucking just so rich.
It's a giant metal,

10
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:26,660
many times larger than an Olympic gold
medal.

11
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:27,740
Uh,
uh,

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,770
he's wearing this metal and he's
standing there in front of a fucking.

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,800
It's called the freedom middle of valor
and he's standing in front of all those

14
00:00:40,911 --> 00:00:44,060
people and he's such a charismatic
person.

15
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,350
There it is right there.
Oh,

16
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:49,130
Jesus Louisa's.
We'll look at that fucking thing.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,050
Come on.
Just the,

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,560
the lack of like understanding how you
come across that would allow you to wear

19
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:02,300
that,
the lack of objectivity that it will

20
00:01:02,301 --> 00:01:04,390
allow you to put that on and,
and,

21
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:08,330
and be able to do this fingertips down
thing on the,

22
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:10,010
uh,
on the desk.

23
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:14,120
Like you're making a very important
point while you're wearing a fucking

24
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,580
Frisbee,
a gold frisbee around your neck.

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,080
It's almost like he's trying to convince
himself by tricking all these people.

26
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,050
I think there's something to that.
There's something to,

27
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:32,950
if you can get a thousand people to
cheer at these words that you're saying

28
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,700
and you know,
no matter how fucking crazy they are,

29
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,630
if you can get all these people to
believe you and listened to you,

30
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:45,050
it sort of validates.
That may be you're not fucked up because

31
00:01:45,051 --> 00:01:48,560
you're in with all these other people
that agree and fetuses and fucking,

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,980
you know,
all the other wacky shit that they

33
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:55,460
believe.
There's something to that where he's

34
00:01:55,461 --> 00:02:00,080
putting on his massive performance.
Not just for them but for himself as

35
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:00,914
well.

36
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:03,770
I have my own bill o'reilly story.
Please send it to me.

37
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,410
Well,
the 48 laws of power just come out in

38
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:10,580
[inaudible] 98 and Bill O'reilly decides
to have me on the Riley if o'reilly

39
00:02:10,581 --> 00:02:11,900
factor,
which was big then,

40
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:15,320
but not as big as it became later on.
And so I'm like,

41
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,480
this is like one of my first shows I've
ever been on.

42
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:18,650
No,
no,

43
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,640
no,
nothing like this ever happened to me

44
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:26,930
before.
And basically you go to a studio in Los

45
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,910
Angeles where he's in New York and
you're in this room and there's nothing

46
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,880
around you.
And they put an earphone in your head

47
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,310
and you're staring at a camera.
You don't see anything.

48
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:41,030
You just hear bill o'reilly's stupid
fucking voice in your ear asking you

49
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,730
questions.
It's like you're on drugs and it's so

50
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,250
disconcerting.
It's like the guy who's trying to put

51
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,830
you off your game before you're already
put off your game,

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,850
the moment you start.

53
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:52,280
Anyway,
he interviews me and I prepared like

54
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,770
shit for this interview because I knew
the questions coming.

55
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,090
It was all about Monica Lewinsky and
Clinton and the scandal and the 48 laws.

56
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,080
And I nailed it.
And he said,

57
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,250
oh,
that was a great interview,

58
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04,570
Robert.
I'm going to have you on again.

59
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,220
Okay.
Wow.

60
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,830
And so I'm feeling pretty good about
myself.

61
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,760
So four weeks later I trudge back to
that office and I sit in that same chair

62
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:17,761
with a little earphone in my head and he
proceeds to just rip me to shreds about

63
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,380
what?
Well,

64
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,170
essentially he hated the 48 laws of
power.

65
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:26,320
He liked the writing or whatever,
but he was just using,

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,120
posing his game.
He was just,

67
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:28,960
you know,
completely.

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,410
He was just using it as a way to attack
Clinton,

69
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,130
which I wasn't wanting to do that.
So anyway,

70
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,800
sorry.
He was just like totally messing with me

71
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,590
and I was so expecting the opposite that
I was like,

72
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,463
Ooh.

73
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,100
And then he goes,
and then he says,

74
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,010
well,
what about this law about use selective

75
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:48,940
honesty?
And I said,

76
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:51,130
well,
it's something that politicians and

77
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,130
business people use all the time.
Like Lyndon Johnson for instance.

78
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,580
And then I was about to explain how
Lyndon Johnson's and he cuts me off.

79
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:58,480
Yes,
yes.

80
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:03,040
The same man who said 58,000 men of our
young men to death in Vietnam,

81
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,010
let's break for a commercial.
And that was the end of the interview.

82
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,760
So he like made me look like I was
supporting Lyndon Johnson,

83
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,640
mit massacring,
58,000 Americans in Vietnam.

84
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,750
He manipulated me and humiliated me and
like,

85
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,360
and the whole thing was he hates the 48
laws of power because it's all about

86
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:30,790
manipulation and ugliness and he's the
most fucking manipulative interviewer

87
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:33,460
you could ever imagine.
Look how he manipulated me.

88
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,450
He completely set me up by making me
think this was going to be like a,

89
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,370
a softball interview where we were just,
you know,

90
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,020
I think.
Did I tell you this?

91
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,220
I've told it,
I'll stop.

92
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:46,760
We've found out it was on a little
plane.

93
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:51,380
You're on a giant plane and it was on
like a 7:37 year old that you in

94
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,970
Australia,
Virgin,

95
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,690
a Virgin Australia,
which has a groovy airline.

96
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,070
So on the flight with me and my wife has
the game,

97
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,800
you know,
this guy is rapper rod,

98
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,010
he's got a tattoo and whatnot.
And Carrie Hilden who's also a rapper

99
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,830
and,
and their policy,

100
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:12,890
right?
So it's hectic,

101
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:15,200
right?
It starts to get them p and the pilot

102
00:05:15,201 --> 00:05:17,600
comes on and goes like everybody's strap
in.

103
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,130
Okay.
For like ever,

104
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,490
and Australia's 15 hours,
16 minutes long this whole day.

105
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,550
And this lasted literally five hours,
right?

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,950
Jess?
Bouncing up and down,

107
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:32,080
side to side,
pitching yard,

108
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:33,420
the whole thing.
And on the,

109
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,290
on the sky map it says like,
Paygo,

110
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:38,470
Paygo,
1500 kilometers,

111
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,660
meaning your 1500 kilometers from paygo,
paygo.

112
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,880
In other words,
the Pacific Ocean is so big,

113
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,620
there's no land masses,
nothing anywhere near you.

114
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,270
Where are your going over?
Right?

115
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,580
So you're not going to go in because
it's turbulence,

116
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:57,581
it's not your fucking freak me out.
This is electric turbulence make planes

117
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,670
crash and doesn't,
unless there's some sort of shitty as

118
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:03,430
structural defect on the plane,
like the,

119
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:04,970
you know,
the wings aren't glued on or whatever.

120
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:06,650
But I mean,
not a structural defect.

121
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:10,590
Generally.
Generally you've been in a pilot

122
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,730
turbulence data,
you know,

123
00:06:11,731 --> 00:06:13,330
that's not what makes them crashing,
you know?

124
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,370
But anyways,
he said it's terrible in any case.

125
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,130
So we get through it and the next
morning,

126
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,860
uh,
the rappers get up and they're all like,

127
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,690
oh my God,
I thought I was going to die.

128
00:06:23,691 --> 00:06:26,870
And you know,
it was so bad last night I was praying

129
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,730
and La,
la La,

130
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,890
they're all like really shook up and
carry.

131
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,390
Hilton is a very lovely young rapper.
Lady wakes up.

132
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,210
It's been all night.
Mind you,

133
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,120
no one can move.
I stopped holding my wife's hand for

134
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:41,880
five.
You know,

135
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,010
like,
like this for you goes like this.

136
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,470
Oh,
what happened?

137
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,820
And the wrappers because you didn't feel
that we are going to die that night.

138
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,050
She goes,
I take a pill.

139
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:56,220
I didn't see any ambien's a
motherfucker.

140
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,730
And then she ate one piece of fruit and
put on a leopard miniskirt and came out

141
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,480
with their makeup and signed autographs.
And I was like,

142
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,750
you're a star.
I want you on my team.

143
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:10,400
You are Alexander the Great.
