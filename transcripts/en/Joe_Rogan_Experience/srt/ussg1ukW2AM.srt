00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,910
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,620
What do you do with your time these days?

3
00:00:04,621 --> 00:00:06,840
Like what's a typical
day for Hixon Gracie?

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,790
Um,

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:13,020
right now I back to teach in
Crohn's place because I wanted to,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,520
to have him march dcis,

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,490
stress with the,

8
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,910
how they academy goes.

9
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,130
So I pick two times a week to teach.

10
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:25,131
They're giving defense
glasses at this point.

11
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:30,441
Before that I was doing seminars
once a month at the most,

12
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:31,980
once,

13
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,780
twice every couple of
months to to make my living.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,800
And also because I feel like
the best things in life,

15
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:41,880
money cannot buy.

16
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,090
And I feel like the quality of my,

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:45,870
my,

18
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,670
my meals that the way I eat,

19
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,350
the way my relationship,

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,580
my sleep,

21
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,420
those are very,

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,320
very viable.

23
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:52,831
A sets,

24
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,190
you know,

25
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,190
plus the time I have to
do things I love to do.

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:58,980
That's kind of when this is fuel.

27
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:00,960
Like when I feel like I'm everything.

28
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,350
So I feel like I'm happy enough to be my
best at service because I always tried

29
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:10,620
to be at service helping somebody
with Jujitsu with knowledge.

30
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:12,270
We from nutrition with breathing,

31
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,021
you know,

32
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,700
it's not about the price is about the,

33
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,630
the service,

34
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:16,291
you know?

35
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,310
And then I put my head in the and said,

36
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,601
yeah,

37
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,890
I knew I'd have a nice day.

38
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:22,620
I make a good speech with Joe Hogan.

39
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,950
I have a nice talk with
Bravo was great day.

40
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,180
So somehow in a purpose
for the federation.

41
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,670
So I always try to be positive,

42
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,710
but I have no schedule fixed.

43
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:39,510
Like I have to wake up vote you wouldn't
know because at this point I create a

44
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:44,511
lifestyle which make me feel good to
engage in different elements like this

45
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:51,051
federation now and having glasses on
crowns and be here to be full of energy.

46
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:52,981
You know,

47
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:56,040
because sometimes you don't notice,

48
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:58,350
but based on your,

49
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,250
your,

50
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,510
your commitments,

51
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:01,440
your obligation,

52
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,840
you'll becoming more
like a Robert and you,

53
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,820
you lose the perspective of what
you need to be at your best.

54
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,100
And if you lose that perspective,

55
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,080
even though you still doing your routine,

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,620
sometimes you just minus you just
80 70 60% of what you should be.

57
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,090
So you're not going to
be the best husband,

58
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:22,380
you're not going to be the best father,

59
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,430
the best employer,

60
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:24,450
the best employee,

61
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,321
you just,

62
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:25,741
you know,

63
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,574
it was just,

64
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,200
so at this point I feel like I have
to be at my best physically do my,

65
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,520
if I feel like I have to stretch,

66
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:33,450
they're going to stretch,

67
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,284
breed,

68
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,370
joke,

69
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,181
have fun,

70
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:37,110
listen buddy,

71
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:37,944
whatever.

72
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:38,880
You know.

73
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,840
And then when I feel like,

74
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,411
man,

75
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,700
I'm so happy I could not eat so and
then I can go and do my service,

76
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,091
you know?

77
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,310
And no,

78
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,160
because the window of life is
smaller now for me is becomes,

79
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,450
I don't have too much time,

80
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,660
so I don't waste time to do
what people expect from me.

81
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,980
I try to do things,

82
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,960
I read the relevant to my soul,

83
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,950
like this federation now
I use I when I dream,

84
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,260
I don't dream small.

85
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:08,170
I dream like I make like a
very space for a few days.

86
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
The biggest dream I can ream and I see
that you know that level of of need for

87
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:18,670
the community and the
level of of position.

88
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:23,671
I have to be the reference for that
shift in the direction of our culture,

89
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,410
in our knowledge.

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,710
I feel like I could not be more motivated,

91
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,750
more happy to engage on this.

92
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:32,651
So,

93
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,470
and that's always life is
about is just do your best and,

94
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:35,781
and,

95
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:38,770
and be excited to be motivated to,

96
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,310
to,

97
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,143
to the next day.

98
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,920
There's such a refreshing attitude,

99
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,830
your attitude,

100
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,070
your,

101
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,630
your philosophy on life because I
think it's very easy and I've been,

102
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,350
I've trapped myself in it sometimes
where you concentrate too much.

103
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,101
I'm making money,

104
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:55,410
concentrate too much on being ambitious
and you forget the quality of life.

105
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:55,840
Yes.

106
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,420
You are focuses almost
entirely on your quality of it.

107
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,280
Yes.

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:03:59,581
You know,

109
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:01,020
because like I said man,

110
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,780
how much cost your motivation,

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,520
how much costs your friends,

112
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,990
how much cost your health,

113
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,071
how much cost,

114
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,090
your intelligence,

115
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,250
those things is priceless.

116
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,440
I mean if you take those off your life,

117
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:13,741
you take,

118
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:15,120
you're more vision of your life.

119
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,670
It can be Bill Gates can be the biggest.

120
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:18,810
So if you,

121
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,940
if you ask me if I want
to have bill gates life,

122
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,451
I don't know.

123
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:22,284
I don't know him.

124
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:26,520
So it's not a based on his bank
account is based on how happy he is,

125
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:27,540
how horny he is,

126
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:28,200
how,

127
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,591
you know,

128
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:29,180
how,

129
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,013
how,

130
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,460
how motivated he is to
wake up and do his thing.

131
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,960
He don't look too horny.

132
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,883
I don't think

133
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,933
so.

134
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,893
So that's,

135
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,610
that's a very essential thing,

136
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,700
which sometimes sleep
to people's fingers and,

137
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,010
and the priorities in the daily,

138
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,671
you know,

139
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:51,580
in the payments and say
put you in a role where uh,

140
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,560
I feel like,

141
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,420
um,

142
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,740
if you tell me in the
past what's the core age,

143
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:00,210
what's the opposite of courage?

144
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,890
I want to say cowardness because either
you tough enough to challenge and to

145
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:08,310
fight or to or in their new
car and then you chicken out.

146
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:10,200
So that's in the past was like the,

147
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:10,380
the,

148
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,010
the,

149
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,311
the,

150
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,690
the opposite of,

151
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,070
of,

152
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:17,820
of college is very high to
remember this in those days.

153
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,720
And I believe the opposite of
it should they use conformity,

154
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,230
you know,

155
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,520
is people get conformed.

156
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,061
Oh,

157
00:05:24,061 --> 00:05:26,700
I don't like my wife
the way I used to like,

158
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,050
but I'm never going to divorce because
I'm afraid to lose my house or the

159
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:33,030
situation is so established
so I got to keep,

160
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,620
so I don't like this job,

161
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,540
but they're going to keep
here because better than his.

162
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,830
So in,

163
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:38,151
in,

164
00:05:38,151 --> 00:05:39,190
in all the hands of the few,

165
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,520
if you get quiet on that
kind of compromise to,

166
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,790
to maintain because you afraid to risk,

167
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,850
let's keep you like one
step behind from you,

168
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,350
follow your heart,

169
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,580
follow the ambition.

170
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,020
You should 18 years old,

171
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:52,840
you don't think twice.

172
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,251
Like I say,

173
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:53,341
Hey,

174
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,180
let's go to Australia.

175
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:54,511
You think,

176
00:05:54,511 --> 00:05:54,781
okay,

177
00:05:54,781 --> 00:05:55,614
let's go boom.

178
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,970
But when you fifth 50 sales,

179
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:57,481
yeah,

180
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,430
what are you going to do there?

181
00:05:58,431 --> 00:05:59,264
Maybe I'm going to,

182
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,260
so it's different,

183
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,094
you know,

184
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,350
and that's kind of hate
or what are we going?

185
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:04,841
Yes.

186
00:06:04,841 --> 00:06:09,841
So that's kind of pretty much where keep
you from be at your best because if you

187
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,180
willing to sacrifice,

188
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,880
if you're willing to broke new,

189
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,890
new challenges,

190
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,400
if you really chew you in
the stage of liveliness and,

191
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:23,740
and excitement and unpredictability,

192
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,270
who make you feel like you're in heaven,

193
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,860
you know,

194
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,700
every time I was engaging in a compromise
or a fight was something that I thank

195
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:32,841
you.

196
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,420
Like I have my routines prior to fight.

197
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,380
One of them is edit day off my fight.

198
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:40,520
I wake up and I thank you.

199
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,520
Glad to be alive and I acknowledge
how perfect we'll be that day.

200
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,700
If I die today,

201
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,730
say fuck my wasn't,

202
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,540
there'd be a perfect day
if I die because I have,

203
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:50,880
you know,

204
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,970
I accomplished my think I'm in my mission,

205
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,260
I representing my family.

206
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:56,060
So I don't go that you tap,

207
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,200
I go there to die.

208
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,790
Like I have to kill me.

209
00:06:58,791 --> 00:06:59,130
It's not,

210
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,450
I'm never going at that.

211
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,101
So by,

212
00:07:02,101 --> 00:07:04,130
that's not a sport like orientation,

213
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:05,540
this is a philosophical,

214
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,863
uh,

215
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,600
owner representation,

216
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:08,931
you know,

217
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,310
is not something I teach.

218
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:11,450
My snow should not that,

219
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:11,570
no,

220
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,403
it's not like that.

221
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,970
It's about how I feel,

222
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:15,170
how I feed my kids,

223
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,580
how I follow my tradition.

224
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,280
So in engagement,

225
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,360
I am not going to be the
one who going to quit.

226
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,430
Then I have to cure me,

227
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,151
my brother,

228
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,320
he can throw the Tao.

229
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,930
But for me is unacceptable.

230
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:27,861
You know,

231
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,750
I do give up from my life.

232
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,740
So based on that kind
of spiritual guidance,

233
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,510
my life is very intense.

234
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,740
My life is very,

235
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:40,070
I mean directed to accomplish
give up is not an option.

236
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:41,570
You know,

237
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,403
I can,

238
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,650
I can direct my,

239
00:07:43,651 --> 00:07:43,971
my,

240
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,050
my focus,

241
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,570
I can give up from something
to go somewhere else,

242
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,980
but I never will give up from something
because I feel like I cannot reach

243
00:07:51,981 --> 00:07:52,814
there.

244
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,391
I may say,

245
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:53,781
okay,

246
00:07:53,781 --> 00:07:54,531
that's not for me.

247
00:07:54,531 --> 00:07:55,400
I go somewhere else.

248
00:07:55,401 --> 00:07:57,110
But if I still focus,

249
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,230
I will take those falls.

250
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:04,850
I will take those obstacles
as a motivation to just set
up a new strategy to try

251
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:05,684
again.

252
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,081
You know,

253
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:07,880
I'm very competitive in a sense.

254
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,160
I like the perfection of things.

255
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:11,990
So this is like a,

256
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,620
a situation where put you in a
situation where you will have no,

257
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,810
either you go forward or you don't,

258
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,730
you don't stay in the middle.

259
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:22,970
Don't say just waiting for
people are waiting for more.

260
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,410
Those are kinds of things going
to stack you back in life and,

261
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,320
and just make you feel
like best through life.

262
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:30,720
As you know,

263
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,460
if you haven't,

264
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:31,940
you know,

265
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,840
you irrelevant,

266
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:33,111
you know,

267
00:08:33,111 --> 00:08:34,460
is is very weak.

268
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,270
[inaudible]

269
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:44,560
yeah.
