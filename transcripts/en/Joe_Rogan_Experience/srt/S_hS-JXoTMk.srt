1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,440
Three, two, one and
[inaudible] we're live. So, uh,

2
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:10,110
you have a wonderful nickname,
Ms. Summers. Uh, is do people use,

3
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:13,620
still use MS as ms gone?
I don't see that anymore.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,070
You see it on forms ms as like a possible,

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,330
but like Harvard, was it Harvard? What,

6
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,160
which one of the Major Ivy League schools.

7
00:00:23,161 --> 00:00:28,140
What's adding a bunch of different gender,
different gender neutral pronouns.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,251
Like Zi,

9
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:33,510
h e and they were adding a bunch of
crazy new ones that they have invented.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:36,330
Have you seen these things
like Gyno American, that's an,

11
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:42,030
does that mean I know Mac
and I think I want to be one.

12
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,830
Can I be a Gyno American?
Is that okay?

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,380
Do you have to be one of your
nicknames though is a based mom? Yes.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,060
Which is, I know that term from the
rap world, like based like there's,

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,520
what's that Dude Lil B, the Bass
God, is that his name? Um, and,

16
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,390
but I didn't know what based means,

17
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:04,740
but I've heard it used a bunch of times
and it's always a positive descriptive,

18
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:08,940
right? Yeah, that's right.
I had to Jamie's very,

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,680
he's into the hip hop world. If I
have to go to him and young kids. Um,

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,260
so I had to Google it and there's an
urban dictionary definition based is all

21
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:23,730
about being yourself and not caring
about what anybody else thinks. Right.

22
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,700
So they use it as an excuse.
I'm sorry. They use it as a, um,

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,770
an example.
It's when you don't care,

24
00:01:31,771 --> 00:01:35,310
like that bag looks gay on you.

25
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,530
I don't care based,
oh, I didn't know that.

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,790
That seems like, I thought that I
thought it'd be a different Devin.

27
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,490
I thought like based mom is like,
you're cool. That's what I thought.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,750
And I said so because they
called me that for quite a while.

29
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,890
Is it mainly the gamers

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,060
and then they explained that no,

31
00:01:57,061 --> 00:02:02,061
it means to be authentic and you say
what you think you're not hypocritical.

32
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:03,840
So it's that, I mean, I,

33
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,270
I think it's a great compliment
being based and being a mom,

34
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,430
it seems quite positive. Yes. But uh,
it, it was a very funny nickname. Um,

35
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,490
so you got involved in
this whole gamergate thing
because I found out about you

36
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,820
through a guest through
the whole gamergate thing
because someone had called me

37
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:24,480
an Mra once and I don't remember
what the context of it was,

38
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:28,800
but it was something involving
something that had to do with feminism.

39
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:32,880
And, uh, they, they call it to me
as a pejorative. And I was like,

40
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:34,560
what does that mean?
What does an Mra?

41
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,510
So I had to Google it and then when I
realized it was men's rights advocate and

42
00:02:39,511 --> 00:02:43,350
I was like, I can't believe that
a feminist is making fun of me.

43
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:48,330
It's using a negative term men's rights
advocate so that it gets bad to care

44
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:50,850
about men's rights, like
what, what's going on?

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,910
So that made me get deeper into the
rabbit hole of Ms. Christina Summers.

46
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,100
And then I started watching your
factual feminism videos and I started

47
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,760
listening to some of your conversations
and I became very impressed.

48
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:08,761
But I also became very perplexed
because you face a lot of backlash.

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,960
And, uh, I found that perplexing
because everything that I saw,

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,910
you seem to be very reasonable,
very measured, very informed.

51
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:22,180
Like how did you eat? Polite, very polite.

52
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,150
How did you get on this kind of
crazy journey? Almost as like a,

53
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,920
it mean, correct me if I'm
wrong, but it seems like,

54
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,380
I don't want to say you're
redefining feminism,

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,560
but you're redefining it
after it's been redefined.

56
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:40,570
Does that make actually taking it, taking
it back to its original noble purpose,

57
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,490
which was about equality,

58
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,700
basic fairness to women that women
and men should enjoy equal liberty and

59
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:50,410
dignity. Right? Of course.

60
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,680
But feminism has drifted into I think a
kind of female chauvinism and I became a

61
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:57,970
feminist many years ago,

62
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,210
decades ago because I did not appreciate
male chauvinism. I still don't,

63
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:05,380
but I don't like female chauvinism. That's
what we have today. Too much of that.

64
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,390
And is there an origin of all this?

65
00:04:09,391 --> 00:04:12,960
I mean there's a one thing that you could
point to where this all started cause

66
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,210
it seems like the,
the origins of it.

67
00:04:15,211 --> 00:04:18,810
Like if you go back and watch like old
movies and take a look at old culture,

68
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,750
it's very clear.
There's a lot of sexism going on.

69
00:04:21,751 --> 00:04:24,960
Like men would smack women and old
movies and it was, it was like,

70
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:29,370
it seemed like that's like
in other than reading books,

71
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:32,910
that's the best
interpretation of the time.

72
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,270
So if you go back to those 1950s films
and look at how people treated each

73
00:04:38,431 --> 00:04:38,940
other,

74
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,390
it seems like there were much clearer
definitions that women were struggling

75
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:46,570
against like this, this idea that
women were inferior, that the,

76
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,060
the whole stereotype of women belong
barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen like

77
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,530
this. This was, this is what young women
were fighting against were women, period.

78
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:58,500
We're fighting against when feminism
sort of started. It's march.

79
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,730
That's right. And then what happened,
particularly in the academy,

80
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,900
and I was teaching philosophy in the
1980s and the chairman of my department

81
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:10,920
asked me to teach a course
in feminist theory and I
thought, fine, I'm a theorist.

82
00:05:10,921 --> 00:05:12,990
I'm a feminism.
I sent away for the textbooks.

83
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,770
I was shocked by what
came through the mail.

84
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,100
I spent the summer reading these books.
And as,

85
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,260
as a philosophy professor of many years,

86
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,040
I thought there was a sacred
commandment about college teaching.

87
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,910
Thou shalt teach both sides of the
argument. It never occurred to me,

88
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:33,680
it was my job as the teacher to take
my views about the world and, and,

89
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,910
and implanting them in the minds of my
students. I wanted to give them the,

90
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:41,430
the techniques to make their
own decisions. And you do that.

91
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:44,820
One way to do that is to give them the
best that was thought and said on both

92
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:48,930
sides of a contentious issue. Well,
these textbooks were not like that.

93
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,930
They were a series of
mutually reinforcing readings.

94
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,350
And it was a conspiracy theory about
the patriarchy buttressed by statistics.

95
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:02,380
So I, after spending a
summer reading this books,

96
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,880
I wrote a paper and,
and gave,

97
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:08,390
I went to the American Philosophical
Association and presented it.

98
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:11,720
And I will tell you, typically at the
American Philosophical Association,

99
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,100
if you give a paper, people
are, it's very combative.

100
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,670
Uh, but then you go out for drinks.
Well, we did not go out for drinks. Uh,

101
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,040
I gave this paper, women, mostly women
in the audience were hissing and booing.

102
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,090
And I was excommunicated from a
religion I didn't even know existed.

103
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,530
The church of feminism, I
was, I was considered a,

104
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,540
that I'd committed an act of heresy.

105
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,470
What was your take on it that was
so offensive? Well, I said that, uh,

106
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,430
that feminism should be about mutual
respect. It should be about equality,

107
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,580
not the demonization of men.
It was as if they had,

108
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:51,170
if you could reduce it to a few phrases,
it would be women are from Venus,

109
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,840
men are from hell. And I
thought, that's absurd.

110
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:57,830
Why would we want to teach courses
like that? The demonize men,

111
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,090
let's celebrate humanity and have an,
you know,

112
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,710
and also accuracy because these texts
were filled with what I've come to call

113
00:07:06,711 --> 00:07:10,010
advocacies statistics or in
some cases hate statistics,

114
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:15,200
sort of designed to create
a just anger in women.

115
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,470
And they happen not to be true,
but they work very well as propaganda.

116
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,970
So as a philosophy professor,

117
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:24,971
I was very upset to see classrooms
being used to disseminate propaganda and

118
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,630
twisted conspiracy
theories about patriarchy.

119
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:32,820
So I tried to correct it
and what happened was I,

120
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:37,790
the radicals were already there in the
academy and they do not tolerate dissent.

121
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,530
Well. I mean, you see it today on campus.

122
00:07:39,531 --> 00:07:43,280
What you're seeing happening
on the campus today at Yale,

123
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:45,410
these terrible
confrontations between these,

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,520
some are calling the McRib
bullies now, um, and,

125
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:52,610
and professors and so forth.
These, these angry mobs.

126
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,070
I have been confronting them for years,

127
00:07:55,071 --> 00:07:57,950
but now the public is beginning to notice.

128
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,380
Well, you've been confronting them only
from the standpoint of feminism, right?

129
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:01,621
I mean,

130
00:08:01,621 --> 00:08:06,621
what was going on and Yale was a
professor had written a letter saying that

131
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,450
children should probably have the
right to be a little bit outrageous and

132
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:17,510
perhaps even offensive in their Halloween
costumes and just Halloween costumes.

133
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:22,410
This led to this massive outrage lotion.
It's hunger.

134
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:27,780
What seems like to me that
there's something about,
it just seems really fake.

135
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,950
It's something about, it seems like
there's people that have the green light.

136
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,353
This one I like.

137
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:37,860
There's a lot of these issues where I
feel like the reaction that people have,

138
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,420
it's not a genuine reaction that what
the reaction represents is a green light

139
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,490
to be an asshole.
It's like if you think that you

140
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:49,710
really mean, it really means these
people and they want it people's jobs,

141
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:51,110
they want their heads on a platter.

142
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:54,750
We ever argued with anybody that
I wanted there to fire them.

143
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:55,920
You want convince them

144
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,630
but this is something different.

145
00:08:57,631 --> 00:09:01,710
This is a fanatical well it's because
there's a certain amount of power that's

146
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:05,010
involved in social media is a certain
amount of power involved in this.

147
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,480
It is in fact a mob mentality and
a mob mentality is a very real,

148
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,470
real mentality.

149
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:13,740
Whether it's an actual mob out on
the street in the middle of a riot,

150
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:18,450
or whether it's a bunch of people on
Twitter to get riled up into a frothy rage

151
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,040
danger and start attacking people the
way that this one girl was screaming at

152
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:27,810
that professor who was speaking and
very logical and very measured tones,

153
00:09:27,811 --> 00:09:32,811
and she was screaming at him and mob
can't be reasoned with and it's the worst

154
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:38,400
possible display of irrationality and
to have it on a campus. And right now,

155
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,100
the deans,
the college presidents,

156
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,510
they are so craven and they're
writing these, you know,

157
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:48,390
self abnegating letters and
saying, oh, I'm so sorry.

158
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:53,340
And I honor this conversation. Honor the
conversation with, uh, with an angry mob.

159
00:09:53,341 --> 00:09:54,151
I mean, it's, well,

160
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:59,151
it seems like what that woman did when
she wrote that original letter was tick

161
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,970
take a little bit of a chance against the
mob was take a little bit of a chance,

162
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:07,140
and this is the reaction.
The Bob was like, fuck you.
You know, know we're the mob.

163
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,980
And that woman's screaming at her husband,
oh, I believe it was her husband, right?

164
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,220
Yes. A distinguished, uh, uh,

165
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,910
I think he's a sociologist and
he was being very fair and,

166
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:21,210
and engaging them outside in the open,
in this incredibly large group.

167
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:22,670
But it was funny how he,

168
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:27,450
he had to do it because there was so many
people round and some of them couldn't

169
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:29,580
hear what he was saying.
He's saying, well,

170
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,210
I will raise my voice so that
you will be able to hear me,

171
00:10:33,211 --> 00:10:37,520
but I'm not yelling at her and
I'm raising my voice. Factly,

172
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,460
he would turn to one group of
students because they would say,

173
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:45,160
you're not looking at us. He would
turn and then the state was behind.

174
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,400
You would say you're not,
you know, this man could not,

175
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:51,140
when he was in a terrible situation,
all because of Halloween costumes,

176
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,880
these children, these chill,
I call them children, they,

177
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:56,500
I'd wouldn't have called college
students shelter, but now they, they,

178
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,080
it's so they're so infant tile, but
it's worse than that. It's, it's,

179
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,000
it's infant tile. Yes. But
it's infused with bitter,

180
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,020
divisive, hardline politics that
they learned in their classrooms.

181
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:12,660
And that's how I tie it to
what I read in these textbooks,

182
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,800
these paranoid theories,

183
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:19,050
these theories that I read incited a
fair amount of women, not, uh, not most.

184
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:22,320
I mean, I think most college women
would read these texts and just move on.

185
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,500
But about 10 to 15% will become fixated
and sort of intoxicated with rage.

186
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,860
And I thought over the years,
and now I, I mean the same,

187
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,710
similar things have gone on
with race, scholarship and, um,

188
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,970
and gender politics. There's
similar phenomenon. Well,

189
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:42,920
it seems to me that certain
ideologies can become, like, they,

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,460
they can become contagious.
And they're also very intoxicating.

191
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,690
It's very intoxicating to be a part
of a group that's being opposed.

192
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,010
And that is opposing.
You're on a team,

193
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,210
you're on or you were in a war,

194
00:11:55,211 --> 00:11:57,910
you're on an army and you
were against the patriarchy.

195
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,300
You have an enemy and you're
against whatever the hell it is.

196
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:04,960
Like when those kids storm
that, did you see the uh, the,

197
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,190
the latest one where they,

198
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:10,000
there's a study hall and these kids in
there are studying and these guys came

199
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:14,950
into his sign screaming black lives
matter. Black lives matter. Like, okay,

200
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:15,400
do you,

201
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,390
are these people who are studying or
they're the ones who are oppressing you?

202
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,310
Are they, who are you trying to impart
this wisdom too? I know they wouldn't.

203
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,980
It was ridiculous. I saw it. And, and if,

204
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,400
if the students didn't get
up and join them, they came
over and accused them. Yes.

205
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:33,480
It looked like our struggle section
session or something in a fanatical

206
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:37,850
government and, and they don't have
power. But what if they did? Yes,

207
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,940
they would be very scary.

208
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,360
Well,
looked like an onion article come to life.

209
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:46,340
I know the world has become an end and
the on campus is an onion. It's all right.

210
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,090
Yeah. It's almost impossible
to distinguish it. So what,

211
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,970
what caused all this though?
How did this happen?

212
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:56,250
Why are there not more measured,

213
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:01,280
intelligent people that are trying to
raise children and teach them how to be

214
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:05,040
measured in an intelligent adults and
look at things objectively. Like what is,

215
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,170
what is causing this underlying
sort of theme that's right. This,

216
00:13:10,171 --> 00:13:12,300
this delusional theme
that's repeating itself.

217
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,120
Well, first of all, there are
lots of reasonable professors.

218
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:19,750
Even in women's studies, there are
reasons, reasonable professors,

219
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:21,970
but they are not the vocal.
Uh,

220
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,120
there's a vocal minority of professors
who are apparently for certain students,

221
00:13:28,511 --> 00:13:33,130
charismatic, and they have
for years been teaching these,

222
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,050
these paranoid views of the world
and inciting rage against men,

223
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,320
gender profiling of men.
And,

224
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:43,960
and they have a following.

225
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,600
And this little following has been
there all along. But about, um,

226
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,260
two years ago,

227
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:55,240
the Department of Education sent out
essentially an edict warning colleges that

228
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:59,890
if you don't take strong measures
against, uh, sexual harassment and,

229
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,650
and the rape culture,
and they didn't use the word rape culture,

230
00:14:02,651 --> 00:14:06,390
but they alluded to it. If you do
not take all of these measures, uh,

231
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,580
you will be held accountable
and can lose your funding.

232
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,230
Now to the department's
credit, they wanted to do
something about campus assault.

233
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,630
That's fine.
But they went too far.

234
00:14:16,631 --> 00:14:21,250
They believed the propaganda about
what's happening on the college.

235
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,270
And they gave a cure that was
worse than the disease. I mean,

236
00:14:25,271 --> 00:14:30,271
the cure was to turn campuses
into a little pink police state.

237
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:35,500
Some column, feminists, police dates
where every joke is now monitored and,

238
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,700
and you're supposed to be reporting
other students. If you hear a remarked,

239
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:41,650
it could be interpreted as sexist.
And this isn't happening.

240
00:14:41,651 --> 00:14:46,080
It's at public universities where the
last time I looked, we were, you know,

241
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,570
part of, you know, the, the
US constitution applies,

242
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:53,300
the students are being policed by
people that have no right to do it.

243
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:57,530
But this was a incited by the,
by the Department of Education.

244
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,420
How bizarre. Uh, so that's,
that's the original,

245
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,620
that's the route. If you go back and
look, when did words like trigger warning,

246
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,900
safe space, micro aggression. You know, we
didn't hear these three, four years ago.

247
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:16,430
What happened was that these angry
groups who've always been there,

248
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:19,870
they were empowered by,
um,

249
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,000
the assistant secretary of education.
The Department of Education,

250
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:27,560
she basically told them you can make
a federal case out of, uh, you know,

251
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,460
someone walking by and you know,
a,

252
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,990
a micro aggression and they consider
everything Amanda's at micro aggression.

253
00:15:32,991 --> 00:15:34,100
What is a micro aggression?

254
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:36,740
Like can me a definition of what an
aggressive thing would be to punch

255
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:40,160
somebody's right or to use an obvious,
you know,

256
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:45,620
just intolerably sexist or a racial slur.
A micro aggression would be,

257
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,950
um, what's something that
is demeaning but you know,

258
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:53,390
prison doesn't necessarily intended
and they, they would say, you know,

259
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,830
somebody saying hi, beautiful.
That's a microaggression. Oh yeah.

260
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,770
A man holding a door open for girls.
That would be,

261
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,850
that's benevolent sexism and those
are micro aggressive. Maybe not micro,

262
00:16:04,851 --> 00:16:07,430
maybe a nano aggression.

263
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,910
What if you're a straight man and
you hold open a door for a lesbian?

264
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,250
Well, she's a nice person. She'll be
grateful. But what if you're a gay man?

265
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:18,930
You hold up at the door
for a straight man.

266
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,870
Do you get accused of micro
aggression there? It seems like,

267
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,360
you know,

268
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,260
you're trying to tease out the logical
implications of their mess with it.

269
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,680
You can't you, yeah. You said
before it's a rabbit hole.

270
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,790
You will never emerge is a sane person.

271
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,980
I've paid over the last two years or so.
Uh,

272
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,830
when I started going
down this rabbit hole,

273
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,310
I started visiting these websites and uh,

274
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:48,040
visiting a lot of forums that you could
easily just called echo chambers and

275
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,050
looking at what happens,
first of all,

276
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,070
when someone disagrees even politely,
they're banned instantly.

277
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,410
When someone had any, uh, there was, uh,

278
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,470
there was one was a topic about,
um,

279
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,630
sexual assault in terms of drinking,
about what is,

280
00:17:08,631 --> 00:17:13,460
what is rape. And the, the, the
subject was they were discussing,

281
00:17:13,461 --> 00:17:14,690
they were accusing someone,

282
00:17:14,691 --> 00:17:19,691
a man of rape because he and a woman
had gotten drunk together and had sex.

283
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,620
So the man had raped a woman and it was,
it was very bizarre.

284
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,630
They say that and you'll
say, what, wait a minute.

285
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:31,740
What if they are both equally drunk?
They do. We, and I asked this,

286
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:34,830
I was at a debate at the University of
Virginia. I debated a law professor.

287
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:38,520
I said, then are you saying to people
could rape each other at the same time?

288
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,480
You know,
they're both drunk.

289
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:42,330
And she said she thought
that was a perfectly possible

290
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:47,160
situation. And that is such
a degradation of language,

291
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,750
a trivialization of a serious,

292
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,510
but they have an expanded the meaning
of terms so that now sexual assault

293
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,900
encompasses just normal
behavior that people enjoy,

294
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,013
which is a,

295
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,050
it has been known to happen that people
have drinks and then have sex. Well,

296
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:09,051
it's a Gi and percentage of the
culture becomes rapist then a yes,

297
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,590
most of the people, even even throughout
history and throughout the world today,

298
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:18,960
90% of the world would
probably be deemed rapists.

299
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:24,090
And I also don't understand why it is
automatically the guy's fault if it's,

300
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,590
if it's consensual.

301
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:28,820
I'm not talking about someone being
incapacitated and blackout drunk.

302
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:33,690
That's reasonable. People would see
that as an, as an assault, but just it,

303
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:38,700
you're both really drunk and you
have sex. Um, why is he the rapist?

304
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:43,650
Because that tends to be what happens on
the campus. They do blame the young man.

305
00:18:43,651 --> 00:18:44,850
They don't say you raped each other,

306
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:48,900
that they will take her side if
she can show they'd had drinks.

307
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,830
And I find this,
uh,

308
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,330
another strange thing that's happening
with feminism today is that it's going

309
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:57,030
the,
I call it fainting couch feminism.

310
00:18:57,031 --> 00:19:00,420
It's almost as if we're going back to the
Victorian era where there was delicate

311
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:04,860
ladies preyed upon by men and as if
the women aren't moral agents. I mean,

312
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:07,140
if you take a lot of drinks,
a,

313
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,230
you're probably have made a decision to
lower your inhibitions and be wild or

314
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:15,840
all kinds of things are going on that
would explain that you're still an agent

315
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:19,740
in, in charge of if you're, you
know, yourself self mastery.

316
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,360
But they denied this of women.

317
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,370
It's all is a women have no agency
and are constantly triggered,

318
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:29,520
need safe spaces at Brown university.
By the way,

319
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:34,110
they had to feminists debating.
One of them was the libertarian,

320
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,510
a great Wendy Mackelroy and she didn't
believe the statistics and another was

321
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,320
Jessica Valenti, hardline feminists.
They were debating, but that was fine.

322
00:19:43,321 --> 00:19:46,560
It was a debate. You think that would
make everyone happy? Both sides.

323
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,060
Well represented.
No,

324
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:53,090
the brown feminists were traumatized
by the very idea that someone would be

325
00:19:53,341 --> 00:19:55,500
invalidating our experience.

326
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:58,980
They use that phrase and they
ha they formed a safe room,

327
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,710
a safe space where you could go,

328
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,360
which had videotapes are
frolicking puppies, coloring books,

329
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:08,880
bubbles,
stuffed animals.

330
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,500
And this was described
in the New York Times,

331
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:17,210
but it was a cover story in the
New York Times magazine by Judith,

332
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,310
Judith Shulevitz and this was the safe
space. And you read it and you're,

333
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,360
you're astonished that the of
the infantilization puppies,

334
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,280
puppies frolicking puppies, safe levels,

335
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:36,960
coloring books. I get it.
It's kindergarten for college,

336
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:40,980
girls hurts. My brain hurts. I just don't,

337
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,240
I think there's,

338
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,240
there's a connection that a lot
of people have that somehow or sax

339
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,500
with regret is bad.
It's negative.

340
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,370
And that sex with regret
when it comes to alcohol,

341
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,850
that perhaps since men are
classically the pursuers,

342
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,670
that there's coercion involved and
even though the man is intoxicated,

343
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,470
he did that on his own.
He didn't need it.

344
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:07,030
Did that in order to sort of lure the
girl in and then have sex with her,

345
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,180
but that's not rape.
And at the end of the day,

346
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:14,050
even though that's kind of
sleazy behavior, at the end
of the day, it's just sex.

347
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:18,280
Like why is sex so bad?
Like it's sex is not terrible.

348
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:21,140
What's terrible is rape actually rape,

349
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:21,870
it's terrible,

350
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:26,870
terrified thinking here to be killed or
what a horrible experience and this is a

351
00:21:27,321 --> 00:21:30,560
bad date, you know, or a bad
hookup I guess you would call it.

352
00:21:30,561 --> 00:21:33,360
And where are you are, you
know, you didn't know you did.

353
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:37,040
Maybe you regret it the next day.
And we do see on campus,

354
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,910
I've watched these cases where these
young women will, they wouldn't,

355
00:21:40,911 --> 00:21:42,770
they don't report these
things and sometimes it,

356
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,370
they have to take a gender studies
class a year later and then they bring

357
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:51,371
charges and there is no
way it's metaphysically
impossible to have any evidence

358
00:21:52,011 --> 00:21:53,860
of what happened.
But if she can and,

359
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:56,600
and young men had been thrown
off campus and, or you know,

360
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,580
sort of tarred with the, with the,
uh, the stigma of being a rapist.

361
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,490
I have Thaddeus Russell on who's an
author and a professor at Occidental.

362
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:10,491
And he was talking about how there was
a case where a man and a woman who were

363
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:15,900
going to school there got drunk and
had sex and the man was accused of rape

364
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:19,980
because of this and kicked out
of school and the girl stayed.

365
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,390
They were both equally drunk. She sent him
taxing, you know, c'mon over. Oh, I know.

366
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,400
Do you have condoms? Like the whole deal?
Yeah, it was, but somehow or another,

367
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,330
you're not responsible for sexual
activity when you're drunk,

368
00:22:33,331 --> 00:22:37,350
but you are responsible for driving.
You're responsible if you commit violence.

369
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,100
You're not exonerated from any of those
things if you're drunk. But somehow,

370
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,690
what if a woman has sex when
she's drunk with a man? Yeah,

371
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:48,410
we'll try this out on the,
on the LAPD, you a, you know,

372
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,420
you drink a lot and let's
say I get stopped by the
police and then I say he gave

373
00:22:53,421 --> 00:22:57,710
me drinks, he gave me drinks. Is I have
you right. Oh, then they arrest him.

374
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:02,300
I don't think so. I think,
yeah, we recognize that. Uh,
I would be the guilty, yeah.

375
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,170
Well when I,
in this article that I was,

376
00:23:04,171 --> 00:23:08,550
or this a forum that I was reading
where they were accusing this guy, uh,

377
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,580
his name is Michael Shermer.
I don't know if you know his,

378
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:14,430
you know his story as a famous skeptic.
Oh yes, of course. I know his story,

379
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,890
but he was, he was, uh, the guy who
was accused and he was accused of, um,

380
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,640
being,
uh,

381
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,110
a womanizer and a drunk and that he got
some girl drunk and had sex with and

382
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:27,030
they were calling it rape. And, uh,

383
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,090
one of the things that they were saying
during this whole thing was someone had

384
00:23:32,281 --> 00:23:36,950
come in and said, well, why is it
that when you're drunk, you're,

385
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:40,170
you're responsible for all these other
things but you're not responsible for sex.

386
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,840
And that person was immediately
banned from the forum.

387
00:23:42,841 --> 00:23:46,310
They were immediately kicked out.
Like, you can't entertain that angle.

388
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:51,080
Right. Can't entertain that possibility.
That's what the, that's, that's why it's,

389
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,940
I would call these people fanatics
because the, it's not simply that they,

390
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,240
you know, want to do all they
can to promote their side.

391
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,940
They don't want the other side
to get a hearing. Right. They,

392
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:06,110
they do not believe in intellectual
pluralism or political pluralism.

393
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,520
It's my side and only my side. And
everyone is discredited in immediately,

394
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,900
simply for not agreeing with them.

395
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,370
And they're being reinforced by
these incredibly bizarre men,

396
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:21,350
the male feminist men and not all of them.
I mean,

397
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:23,210
some of them are doing it
for all the right reasons.

398
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:26,300
So when we were doing it because they
want quality and they think that women

399
00:24:26,301 --> 00:24:27,620
should be treated as equals,

400
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:31,580
but there's a lot of them are doing it
for Social Brownie points and they're,

401
00:24:31,581 --> 00:24:35,510
they're doing it to be
considered as like a, the, the,

402
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,460
in a higher ethical or moral standard
to the, the women that they're pursuing.

403
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:44,110
Well, I think a lot of them do it also
because they believe it. Yeah. And they,

404
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,800
maybe they had very feminist
mothers reinforced by teachers.

405
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,670
And then if they took gender studies,
my goodness that, that, you know,

406
00:24:51,671 --> 00:24:55,240
it's all there and the
texts and so people,

407
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,800
I mean it,

408
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,810
I forgive students because I know
that they have gone through relentless

409
00:25:01,811 --> 00:25:06,100
propaganda when it comes to gender because
there's the, the gender police have,

410
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,730
the gender activists have not allowed
dissident voices and that we are here.

411
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,540
There are many professors
that agree with me.

412
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:18,310
People like Camille Polya and Wendy
Kaminer, many journalists like the great,

413
00:25:18,311 --> 00:25:22,860
you know, Cathy young and on
and on. But we have been, uh,

414
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,200
you know, demonized and our
voices are not, you know,

415
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:27,190
we're not invited to the table.

416
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:27,721
Well,

417
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:32,550
classically feminine women are also
demonize women who wear skirts and high

418
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:37,551
heels and like the just painted
nails and makeup and things that,

419
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,460
you know,

420
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:44,460
people may enjoy that look for some
reason that's a negative thing.

421
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,540
Like some reason you're,

422
00:25:45,541 --> 00:25:49,920
you're falling into what the Patriarchy
is set up for you. You're, you're,

423
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:54,120
you are fulfilling their self,
demeaning stereotypes in some way.

424
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,240
That's kind of like it. You
can't like lipstick, you know,

425
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:00,990
you're not allowed to like fake eyelashes
or whatever the hell you like wearing.

426
00:26:00,991 --> 00:26:04,800
It's unless you're a
transsexual transsexual,

427
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:09,540
you're allowed to go full whole hog
Bette Davis from the 1950s you could do

428
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,170
whatever you want.

429
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:13,800
Yeah, there are different schools.
I mean some of them don't.

430
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,540
They don't go after that,
but there.

431
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:20,160
But they want you to know that
femininity and masculinity are strictly

432
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:24,930
performances that none of it has a basis
in biology. That's where it gets crazy.

433
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:29,520
Right? I think it's very crazy. Social
Constructs, all the social construct.

434
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:32,970
Well there it's hardly as,
of course culture plays a role,

435
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:35,040
but biology does too.

436
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,370
And there's a kind of nature nurture
divide and it's just not sensible to teach

437
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,070
students both.
And

438
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,750
it's, if you look at the
biologists, the physiologist, you,

439
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,500
many of the psychologists,

440
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:52,440
they'll tell you they're a very
clear male female differences.

441
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:56,460
And not that everyone embodies them,
but most of us do.

442
00:26:56,790 --> 00:27:01,560
And so they're denying what almost
everyone can see with their own eyes.

443
00:27:01,561 --> 00:27:04,020
So that's also people that
can really buy into this,

444
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,560
this sort of gender
intense gender activism.

445
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,570
They have to be able to believe what
they're reading in the text and not what

446
00:27:12,571 --> 00:27:16,980
they see with their eyes or even in their
own hearts so that it has the makings

447
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:21,200
of, as I've said, sort of
fanatical movement was loony.

448
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,670
It's not just financial.
It's like you're,

449
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,000
you're listening to some of
the things that people say, oh,

450
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:29,700
I watched a video where a woman was
talking about gender being a social

451
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:33,570
construct construct and she was talking
about the differences that are often

452
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:37,320
cited between men and women physically
and they're just because of physical

453
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,620
activity that the activities at the
men choose versus the activities at the

454
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:43,590
women's shoes and if the women engaged
in the same activities that would have

455
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:46,110
the same physical abilities as the man.
I was like,

456
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:50,310
what the fuck are you talking about?
That's denying testosterone.

457
00:27:50,311 --> 00:27:55,311
The role it plays in muscle development
and the difference in bone structure and

458
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:00,870
it's denying it. People talk about, oh,

459
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:03,510
on the right there's there anti
science and there's some of that,

460
00:28:03,511 --> 00:28:06,870
but on the left it's more consequential
because these people are in the

461
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:11,700
universities, cooks on the right
tend not to be on the campuses,

462
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:15,690
but these people are teaching
and in our most elite schools,

463
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,020
well gender is the only area where it
doesn't seem like you are allowed to have

464
00:28:22,141 --> 00:28:25,590
an objective conversation about
the statistics or the facts.

465
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,540
Like if you question things or if you
have any questions about the facts or the

466
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:34,650
statistics, you become like, you
become questioned. Like you're, you're,

467
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:38,990
you're a bad person. You're, you're,
you're a person with alternative motives.

468
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,300
You can't just be looking at objective,
like how, what is the number one?

469
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,320
Like someone had told me one in four
women have been raped and I'm like, wow,

470
00:28:46,321 --> 00:28:48,150
that,
that doesn't seem right.

471
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,630
Like one in four women have
met creeps a hundred percent.

472
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:55,470
It's probably more like 90 90%
of women have met creeps, right?

473
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,640
How many have actually been raped
as it one in four this out real.

474
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,910
So we started googling it and you know,
we found all these different numbers,

475
00:29:02,911 --> 00:29:07,230
but there's no hard line numbers and
that could be attributed to a bunch of

476
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:08,011
things.
First of all,

477
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:11,490
the very real fact that many women
that have been involved in a horrible

478
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:15,600
situation like that don't want to
report it. They don't want to be shamed,

479
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,000
they don't want to,
they're just,

480
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:21,630
they would rather pretend it didn't
happen and move on with their life.

481
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,690
They'd rather barrier that is a
certain percentage of the population.

482
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,340
And then what, how many have
actually been raped? I mean,

483
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,960
how many have been,

484
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,350
how many of falsely accused men of
rape when nothing really happened?

485
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:38,580
You can't even say that. If you say that,
if you even admit that that's a reality,

486
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,060
you are some sort of an apologist
or rape apologist or you're

487
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,330
a rape enabler, right? Yeah. There's
something, but this is, these are facts.

488
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:47,530
It's happened to friends of mine.

489
00:29:47,531 --> 00:29:52,060
I've had friends that have absolutely
not raped someone and been accused of it

490
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,480
and had to go to court and had to deal
with much of things in hire lawyers.

491
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,980
And eventually the charges were dropped,

492
00:29:56,981 --> 00:30:00,580
but the fact remains that they
were accused. Of course it happens.

493
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:04,510
This one and four and one in five.
It's been around for years.

494
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,810
What is the origin of it? Oh,
it started with research, uh,

495
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,520
promoted by MS magazine. It was one of the
original, what I call advocacy studies.

496
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,650
It was someone that did a study,
not to find the truth,

497
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:19,270
but to buttress an ideology
about patriarchy. And this case,

498
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,090
uh, I don't want to keep going after,
but it was a professor at the time. Uh,

499
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,940
I think she's at the
University of Arizona. And she,

500
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,750
if you look at the survey,
she asked a series of questions.

501
00:30:31,751 --> 00:30:34,780
So some of them were good and,
and she didn't ask where you ever raped.

502
00:30:34,781 --> 00:30:38,710
If you ask people that you
get a very low number, so you,

503
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:42,850
what they've learned to do is ask around
and say, have you ever been, you know,

504
00:30:42,851 --> 00:30:45,640
violently threatened and then someone
had sex, you know, well, that's fine.

505
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,900
But she also said,

506
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,000
have you ever had sex when you didn't
want to because of man gave you alcohol?

507
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:56,020
And anybody that said yes
was counted as a rape victim.

508
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,850
Now I could imagine cases where you had
sex when you didn't want to because you

509
00:31:00,851 --> 00:31:03,670
know you passed out.
No one denies that his rate,

510
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:08,380
but this question invited
people that think, well, yeah,

511
00:31:08,381 --> 00:31:10,840
I did have sex. I really wish I
hadn't had it, and yeah, I was drunk.

512
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,960
All those people. Now the set,
and this became the basis,

513
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,540
this study became the basis
for the one and four number.

514
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:19,930
Now it's one in five because there've
been other studies that sort of copied

515
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:20,770
this methodology.

516
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,090
The second thing she found is the vast
majority of the women did not think it

517
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:29,680
was rape. They thought it
was miscommunication. So
they did not agree with that.

518
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:32,470
She was classifying it as rape
and put that number out there.

519
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,210
And I think a majority dated
their alleged rapist. Again,

520
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,720
not not what you'd expect from someone
who's a victim of a heinous crime.

521
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,040
So they ask vague questions
and then they get,

522
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:51,190
they get their numbers and then it
gets into the media in the media.

523
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:55,810
Doesn't realize, I think that the gender
scholars have an agenda and they're not,

524
00:31:55,811 --> 00:31:57,940
like if you teach in a women's studies,

525
00:31:57,941 --> 00:32:00,280
I don't want to say women's studies
because there are serious scholars,

526
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:04,420
but if you're in a gender studies
department or gender theory, your,

527
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:08,740
your views are not checked
by objective scholars.

528
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,410
They're just checked by other
people that share your worldview.

529
00:32:11,411 --> 00:32:15,820
So there hasn't been this quality
control. So we're getting, exactly.

530
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,530
So we're getting a lot of, of, of just
specious statistics that are out there.

531
00:32:20,531 --> 00:32:25,531
This one and four is the classic case
when the Bureau of Justice Statistics,

532
00:32:25,541 --> 00:32:29,200
which sets the gold standard
for research on, on crime.

533
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:34,590
They find on the campus that the number
is closer to one in 50 or one in 53 for

534
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:39,390
sexual assault. And they, did
they define sexual assault by,

535
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,830
is that rape? It's both
rape and it's uh, you know,

536
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:46,840
some kind of serious physical that's
still pretty horrible. It's terrifying.

537
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,320
It's terrible. That's
one. One in 50 is awful.

538
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:54,710
It is. But, but one in
50 versus one in four.

539
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:58,160
It's the difference between like
war torn condo and the, you know,

540
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,700
in the United States, one in four is
the Congo, right? It's probably not,

541
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:06,590
it's probably more like 90% net
probably like, uh, there are,

542
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:12,130
there are places in time of war where
rape is used as a weapon of war and the

543
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:16,790
rates are, but Swarthmore
college, Yale University,

544
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,230
Berkeley, they are not the war tour
in Congo. So yeah, there is too much.

545
00:33:21,231 --> 00:33:26,120
I always say there is too much sexual
assault on campus and it is probably part

546
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:30,140
of the, the combination of the hookup
culture and the binge drinking culture.

547
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,090
It's a big problem, but it's not
a problem. The if patriarchy,

548
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,010
it's probably uh, you know, just,
it needs a different solution.

549
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,150
But what they do is want to make it seem
as though we have these sex criminals,

550
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:47,690
these predators hunting for
young women on the campus.

551
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,580
And it's probably,
you know,

552
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:54,500
an awkward 19 year old boy who thought
this girl liked him and they got drunk

553
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,740
and had sex. And then she can
say that he was a rapist and Eda,

554
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:02,750
he had no intention and no awareness
of doing anything wrong and he could be

555
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,280
ruined.
I mean instantly ruined.

556
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:11,650
I hear from some of these young men and
I know of a psychologist in psychology,

557
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,300
a psychologist or getting to get these
young men in their practice because they

558
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:21,970
come in, they are devastated.
You become a nonperson, uh,

559
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,100
and you are shamed. I mean, it's one of
the worst things you can do to a person.

560
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,830
If you're a victim of a crime,
it's a horrible thing.

561
00:34:27,831 --> 00:34:31,490
But people will sympathize with
you and your dignity is intact.

562
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,950
But if you are accused of being like,
I mean,

563
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:38,951
it's like being accused of being a
child molester or to be called a rapist.

564
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,180
It's not much better
and people revile you.

565
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,760
And now we're doing this very casually,

566
00:34:46,761 --> 00:34:50,330
young men on our campuses can be called
a rapist because of a drunken hookup.

567
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:55,900
And then he will bear that stigma for
life because the Internet never forgets.

568
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,220
And in some cases of colleges,

569
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:01,700
we'll put it on his record
and when he goes to transfer,

570
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:05,480
I'm just going to get out of here and
start over. He can't because it's there.

571
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:10,580
So we've got to change this.
This is a terrible miscarriage of justice.

572
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:13,060
Now this person,
you don't have to name her,

573
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:16,170
but the woman who created
this stunning Mary costs it.

574
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:20,630
Actually, she's become more
reasonable lately with the,

575
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,820
but that's probably blow back.

576
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,770
I think she shocked her
statistics are kind of shit.

577
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,170
I think she shocked by what's happened.

578
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,430
She became quite famous and quite
sought after because of this as well.

579
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,100
It's very intoxicating as
well. Yes, you can. Here's the
thing. Know about academia.

580
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:41,970
You can make a career on
documenting victimization,

581
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,390
especially if you can get high numbers,
uh,

582
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,440
victimization of women you can make.
Now, if you come in with low numbers,

583
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,670
it's the opposite. It can be career
diminishing. And there are very serious,

584
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:58,380
wonderful criminologists who did studies
and came up with relatively low figures

585
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:02,280
and they become demonized. They found
themselves not invited, you know,

586
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:06,990
to apply for jobs or,
or, um, denied tenure.

587
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,130
There are no motive.

588
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,030
There's no motive right now to tell
the truth about women's victimization.

589
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:15,780
There are huge incentives
to exaggerate it.

590
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:18,620
And so it stays there unchallenged.

591
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:21,790
And I think the journalists don't
fully understand this. They sit up,

592
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:24,780
but I got this from a scholar
at the University of Arizona.

593
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:26,880
I got this from a scholar at Cornell,

594
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:32,150
but what they don't know is this scholar
may be an idea log or had an agenda

595
00:36:33,301 --> 00:36:37,460
that's it got in the way of her
or sometimes his objectivity.

596
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:42,870
Well, it seems like this is the
type of cyclical thing, this, this,

597
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,033
this,

598
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,250
these reinforcing ideologies that
you're going to teach these children,

599
00:36:51,091 --> 00:36:53,400
these children will grow up to complete,

600
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,360
complete their education and become
professors and continue that sort of cycle

601
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,460
without ever breaking this pattern.
And it can be a real problem if,

602
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:06,780
if the universities continue to teach
these ideologies without question,

603
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:11,490
without some sort of a,
some sort of a peer review.

604
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,820
But it seems like their peers
are just reinforcing ideologists.

605
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,360
So what, what, how does that, how
does this ever get fixed? Well, I,

606
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,880
I don't know.
It has your name.

607
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,430
It gets fixed from you maybe doing your
videos. Well, doing those videos, you're,

608
00:37:29,431 --> 00:37:32,100
you're so calm and logical and he,
you know,

609
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:36,840
you're very reasonable and they have a
tremendous amount of views. And I think,

610
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:43,010
I think there's a lot of people that when
they get called a rape apologist or a

611
00:37:45,301 --> 00:37:48,390
bigot or whatever, that they don't,
when they don't agree with it,

612
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,450
they get angry and then they join
the other team. They were like, well,

613
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:53,850
fuck these feminists. They're
all crazy bitches. You know,

614
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:58,770
I'm on team men like Alfalfa, join the
heat man, woman haters club. You know,

615
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,880
remember that our gang, most
people don't, I'm old. But the,

616
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,970
the reality is most people,

617
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:09,960
I think most people just want to
be around nice people. Most people,

618
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,320
most people and most people that
they don't want to discriminate.

619
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,650
I think most people don't
want to discriminate by about
when it comes to race or

620
00:38:18,961 --> 00:38:20,880
when it comes to gender,
when it comes to anything.

621
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Most people just want people to rise
through their life or get through whatever

622
00:38:26,461 --> 00:38:30,120
they're trying to get through by virtue
of the quality of their, their acts,

623
00:38:30,121 --> 00:38:34,440
by virtue of their behavior,
by virtue of their work like you will.

624
00:38:34,441 --> 00:38:35,980
You want to treat people the way they

625
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:40,120
deserve to be treated, and we all want to
sort of elevate through this existence.

626
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,420
So this idea that there's these teams,
the problem is you get,

627
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:47,940
you get pushed back from one side and
then you just join the other team. Well,

628
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:52,390
it's making, it's it, it is creating
blow back. But it, most people,

629
00:38:52,391 --> 00:38:55,210
I don't think even joined another
team, they just withdraw, right?

630
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,830
Not everybody's temperamentally suited
to be in this. It's, it's combat.

631
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:04,270
Right? And I believe me, I did not,
I didn't consciously think, oh,

632
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:08,740
I'm going to confront these people
and be a, you know, a lawyer.

633
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:13,030
I thought naively I'm going to confront
them and then maybe I'm a little bit

634
00:39:13,031 --> 00:39:15,060
wrong that they're a
little bit wrong and we'll,

635
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:17,860
we'll we'll meet in the middle meat
in the middle or, or who knows?

636
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,220
That didn't happen so that's why I
just don't like bullies and we are,

637
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,143
there's just the,

638
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,920
the gender studies is the result of sign
of a massive endless bullying campaign

639
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,570
by those who will not.

640
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,790
They just except dissident voices.
Yeah.

641
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:39,000
It's very strange.

642
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,560
It's a very strange predicament because
I don't see a clear exit strategy.

643
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:48,720
I look at this confusion and one of the
things I also started doing after being

644
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:51,500
called a men's rights
advocate as to find out what,

645
00:39:51,501 --> 00:39:53,690
what are these fucking
crazy bastards into years,

646
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,850
men's rights and well then they've
got some goddamn good points too.

647
00:39:56,851 --> 00:39:58,050
Unfortunately.
You know,

648
00:39:58,051 --> 00:40:03,051
you go to men's rights advocacy websites
and you see these horrible stories of

649
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:08,460
these guys getting destroyed in divorce
court and losing everything they have

650
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:12,450
being preyed upon by unscrupulous women
that go after them and marry them and

651
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:16,060
take all their money and they have no
recourse and that there were set up.

652
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:18,080
But women set up some sort of uh,

653
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,940
got some restrain restraining
order against them by a judge.

654
00:40:24,481 --> 00:40:28,830
And that that sets up the idea that there
was some sort of an abuser and without

655
00:40:28,831 --> 00:40:32,160
any physical proof they can
be accused of these things.

656
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,130
And then when they go to court,
this all comes to light.

657
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:40,131
And then I've seen some crazy shit that
I've read online about child custody

658
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:44,640
battles where the men were accused of
sexually molesting their children by the

659
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:46,470
woman where there was
no evidence whatsoever.

660
00:40:46,471 --> 00:40:50,130
And the women coached the kids in
the saying these things, horrific,

661
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:53,280
horrific stuff on both sides.
And then these men,

662
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,860
they all lump into these
men's rights groups,

663
00:40:55,861 --> 00:40:57,780
these guys that had
been destroyed by women.

664
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,490
And then just decide that
women are assholes, decide
that women are, are, you know,

665
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:03,480
the enemy.
Right.

666
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:07,060
And that they just want to go to South
America and get prostitutes. You know,

667
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,550
I mean,
I've,

668
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,010
I've literally read articles where
these guys are talking about like,

669
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:14,280
this is how you do it. You go to South
America and you find a girl, you know,

670
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,770
that she's willing to have sex with you
for money their way hotter than American

671
00:41:16,771 --> 00:41:18,440
woman. I'm like, what the
fuck is going on? Right.

672
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,390
Well, you know, they need
to know a couple of things.

673
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:24,560
One is that believe it or not, most
women are still nice and they love men.

674
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:28,320
And I want to say most women, it's a good
percentage, a good percentage, right?

675
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,710
And 60%. I don't know a
percentage, but, um, uh,

676
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,730
let me put it this way.

677
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,720
It's unusual to be that carried
away with gender politics. Yeah.

678
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,770
There may be more today because it's
getting more currency and it's become sort

679
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:47,540
of fashionable.
So to be snarky and an unpleasant,

680
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,240
um, but it's still, it doesn't,
you have to be temporary.

681
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:53,840
You have to be a little neurotic,

682
00:41:53,841 --> 00:41:57,560
I think to be that vulnerable
to these hate ideologies.

683
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:01,310
So it's not the average young woman that
would be vulnerable to these ideologies,

684
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:03,500
but a lot are,
you should have to stay away from them.

685
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:08,530
But there are many sweet women out there
who will not behave that way and her

686
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,373
fair minded.

687
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:15,190
The other thing is that I don't
call myself a men's rights activist.

688
00:42:16,161 --> 00:42:20,810
I'm not, I'm not advocating for
men. I'm advocating for truth.

689
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:25,340
It just happens that most of
the misinformation, not all
of it, but most of it is,

690
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,860
uh, now, uh, targeted against men.

691
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,620
So I do this weekly video series that,
you know,

692
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,050
I just tried to correct a myth each week.
And most of them are myths that are,

693
00:42:36,051 --> 00:42:39,530
they're feminist myths,
um, about how bad men are.

694
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,800
And they're almost always wrong. And
I correct them. So people say, well,

695
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:45,980
you're a men's rights activist. No,
I'm not. I'm a human rights activist.

696
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,410
I'm a truth activists.
A common sense activist.

697
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,840
And if you want to call me a
men's rights activists, fine,

698
00:42:50,841 --> 00:42:52,250
but that's not actually what I'm doing.

699
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,050
Well,
I have friend Kara,

700
00:42:54,051 --> 00:42:57,890
Santa Maria who's a brilliant
scientist and neurosurgeon,

701
00:42:57,891 --> 00:43:02,660
or she was a neuroscientist rather, and
just a, not a surgeon operating on brains,

702
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:05,750
but she called, she said you're
a feminist. And I'm like,

703
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,090
I'm definitely not a feminist. I'm not.
I'm, I'm a, I'm a humanist and that's a,

704
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:14,380
it's a, it's a term that people
like to use, but I'm an Aye. Aye.

705
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:18,440
I like people. I like smart
people. Whether they're
men or women, I don't know.

706
00:43:18,441 --> 00:43:19,430
Me Too.
I don't,

707
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:24,560
I don't want there to be only men
in power are only women in power.

708
00:43:24,561 --> 00:43:28,520
I think that's stupid.
I think I like Chinese people.

709
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,610
I like people from Vietnam. I like
people from everywhere. I just,

710
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,880
I like people that are interesting
and I just want you to be,

711
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,690
I want people to actually
be judged or to be, uh,

712
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,750
to be considered based on their merits.

713
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:46,640
Not based like instantly
judged or demonized because
they happen to have a penis

714
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,380
are instantly demeaned
because they haven't have a
vagina. I think it's stupid.

715
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:54,420
It's stupid. It's identity politics
and it's, it's going nowhere, right?

716
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,050
Except all it does is divide
people and make people bitter. Yes.

717
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,250
And it has to stop. Now you say,
well, how's it going to stop? Um,

718
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:07,180
I'm a mom. Well, I'm trying, but
I'm also optimistic that there,

719
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,230
there has to be a limit to irrationality
and eventually it will fall.

720
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,630
I just wish it would be
sooner rather than later.

721
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,240
Well, I think what we're
dealing with today, um,

722
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:24,710
with our new access to information that
we've enjoyed over the last decade or so,

723
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,690
I think w two decades,

724
00:44:26,691 --> 00:44:31,620
but really it's sort of taking hold with
social media where people don't just

725
00:44:31,621 --> 00:44:35,100
have access to information, but they
also have a voice. Um, you're, you're,

726
00:44:35,101 --> 00:44:38,640
you're finding echo chambers like we
discussed earlier, we get these groups,

727
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:42,540
these radical groups on both sides
is the red pill, men's rights debate,

728
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,290
debate people and the people that are
on the side of women's rights and then

729
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,920
these male feminists and there's
a thing called atheism plus,

730
00:44:49,921 --> 00:44:52,770
which is fucking hilarious.
He can't figure out atheism.

731
00:44:52,771 --> 00:44:56,760
Plus they can't figure it out.
Is it like it's a religion?

732
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,880
It's basically a religion.
It's atheism.

733
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,080
It's no note wall k there's no they're,
they're not,

734
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,280
they don't consider deities,

735
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:09,240
but they want a group of core
ethical and moral values.

736
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:11,280
So I think if you wanted to boil it down,

737
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:16,830
a lot of people would be
atheism plus inclined.

738
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,650
The idea being that you are want to be a
good person and you don't want to be a,

739
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:24,120
you don't want a sexually
discriminate or racially discriminate.

740
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,630
And you a also don't
happen to believe in a,

741
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:29,430
a magic person that lives in the clouds.

742
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,740
Like that seems fairly reasonable until
you listen to these fuckers talk and

743
00:45:34,741 --> 00:45:38,280
they give the most pedantic
boring fucking lectures.

744
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:40,650
All my God,
I sat down,

745
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:43,710
I smoked a joint and I watched this
one guy's lecture and I'm like,

746
00:45:43,711 --> 00:45:45,540
this is like the longest,

747
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:48,570
you know how they have those videos they
do on dating sites where people, hi,

748
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:52,470
I'm Mike, I like to play tennis.
Like this is like his version of it.

749
00:45:52,471 --> 00:45:56,360
Just saying, you know
how boring, you know,

750
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,430
a sexual discrimination was
a racial discrimination was,

751
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:04,140
it's basically like just open. It was
Duh. That's what it was. It was like, Duh,

752
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:08,640
you shouldn't murder people.
Duh. You shouldn't steal,
Duh. Like what you're taught.

753
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:12,150
What the fuck are you talking to?
Your, you're preaching to the choir,

754
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:16,680
I mean are had a fucking atheism
plus conference and you're, you're,

755
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:19,870
you're preaching about the idea
that you shouldn't sexually racially

756
00:46:19,871 --> 00:46:24,430
discriminate and that's
a good thing. Dot. Yes.

757
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,290
It's fucking boring.
What he's saying is boring.

758
00:46:28,291 --> 00:46:32,550
There's no original unique points.
It's just reinforcing the idea,

759
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,170
which is better than a hate rally.

760
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,680
It's better than going to see a bunch
of skinheads talk about the white man

761
00:46:37,681 --> 00:46:39,810
needs to get back to power.
It's definitely better than that,

762
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,750
but it's still a lot of de and
what's the point of that? Really?

763
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,190
Days get together. They have these
conferences, they have conferences.

764
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:51,180
The point is these are social gatherings
where they all reinforce their ideas.

765
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,380
They get together, they drank and then
they rape each other. That's what happens.

766
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:59,340
They drink and then they have sex and
they're both raping. That's what happens.

767
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:01,800
It told a lot of what these things are.
Social Hookups,

768
00:47:02,010 --> 00:47:04,920
these people get together and
it becomes a main focus of them.

769
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,910
They also make a certain amount of money
because they charge money for people to

770
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:10,080
come to these gatherings.

771
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,650
So they come to these gatherings or rent
out like a conference hall somewhere

772
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,760
and they come and they hand out pamphlets
and they sell t shirts and then they

773
00:47:17,761 --> 00:47:20,760
have these little parties and these
little events and then they, you know,

774
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:23,580
you have to pay money to get a badge and
you go to this fucking thing and these

775
00:47:23,581 --> 00:47:27,450
people talk and then they drink.
It's hilarious. Nothing gets done.

776
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:30,010
I mean literally,
absolutely nothing gets done.

777
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:33,810
But what they're doing is they're
sort of reinforcing their ideas. No,

778
00:47:33,811 --> 00:47:38,770
not negative ideas. They're,
they're fairly positive
ideas. It's like it's not bad.

779
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:41,560
The saw horrible. They're not
bad people. They're good people.

780
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,240
When the guy was standing there on that,

781
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,170
the Ds and he was explaining all his
core values and I'm like, oh good.

782
00:47:47,171 --> 00:47:50,650
I believe I agree with you on everything,
but fuck man, you can't just say that.

783
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,390
I think you should eat healthy food.

784
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,450
I think you should get eight
hours sleep at sleep at night.

785
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,440
I think if you are driving in your car
and an old ladies on the road do not run

786
00:47:59,441 --> 00:48:03,460
her over. Yes. Don't run the old lady
over. You know what the fuck man,

787
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:08,540
don't shoot puppies. You know, don't
fucking drown kittens. Ha. A lot of,

788
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:13,550
there's a lot of that in I think
in the academy where they will,

789
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:19,080
it will be just bromides and pointless
truisms then mixed in with harsher

790
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,610
thanks. So they'll say, and
we all agree you should,

791
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,570
you should be respectful of other people
and not demean them with costumes and

792
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:29,520
fine, I don't want to see
someone in black face or, or,

793
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:34,410
or humiliating someone with a costume,
but then they will. So that sounds fine.

794
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:34,941
And we all agree.

795
00:48:34,941 --> 00:48:39,090
But then they will go after a museum
because they have an exhibit of, of,

796
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,970
you know, uh, chemo nose and say,
that's cultural appropriation.

797
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:47,330
This is the new thing I saw about
appropriating costumes. So we can't, well,

798
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,190
cultural appropriation, that is what
most of the history of culture is.

799
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:56,270
What was a Komono night at a museum
raffle thing they were doing at the Museum

800
00:48:56,271 --> 00:48:58,670
of fine arts.
They were bringing an exquisite Kimonos,

801
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,640
public was learning to appreciate
them and you could try one on,

802
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,150
which I certainly would have wanted to
do and have a picture because they're so

803
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:09,110
lovely. And I'm sure the
Japanese love this. Most people,

804
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:13,430
if other cultures are interested in yours,
art forms, you're, you're, you're proud,

805
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:17,690
right? Well, people with too much time
on their hands staged and you know,

806
00:49:17,691 --> 00:49:22,400
an angry intervention. This was a
micro aggression or a macro aggression.

807
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:23,700
And,
uh,

808
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,590
and I think the museum had to apologize
and they're not going to do it anymore.

809
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,620
It's so stupid.
It's like if you go to a Hawaiian hotel,

810
00:49:30,621 --> 00:49:32,840
lot of times they'll give you one of
those grass skirts. They're pretty cool.

811
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:33,883
They don't get mad.

812
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:37,940
Oh, maybe we can't wear leis anymore.
When you were, when you get, well,

813
00:49:37,941 --> 00:49:42,470
they give us the deer. They put them on.
Let's see. Welcome. If you go to, um,

814
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:47,240
over the border around in
California to Tijuana there,

815
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:50,090
everyone's selling sombreros and it's,

816
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:51,650
they're going to drive
them out of business.

817
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,470
Well, they'll go cultural
misappropriation. Oh, this is horrible.

818
00:49:55,471 --> 00:49:59,010
This is the patriarchy.
Well, black lives matter,

819
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:04,590
Brown lives, Brown lives matter, fuck,
they'll have thing is ridiculous.

820
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,610
But it's, I think a lot of it is
what we're saying is that when,

821
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:14,630
when we have social media and when you
see these people that are saying all

822
00:50:16,231 --> 00:50:18,530
these things on social media that are,
you know,

823
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:23,280
a lot of people agree with a lot of
really relevant points when it comes to,

824
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,770
uh, racism or sexism or all these
things. Why are they these things?

825
00:50:27,771 --> 00:50:31,040
Are they saying these things because these
things are actually important to them?

826
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:35,690
Or are they saying these things because
they know people are going to read them

827
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,920
and they're going to like them because
of what they said. It's almost like,

828
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,880
it's almost like the whole world is
becoming slowly but surely a giant reality

829
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:48,470
show.
Because if you watch reality television,

830
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,130
when those people behave on those
shows and those cameras are on them,

831
00:50:52,131 --> 00:50:55,130
they're very aware of those cameras
are on them. So they say crazy shit.

832
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:57,280
They do crazy things. Like, um,

833
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,920
I have a friend who has a friend
who is one of those housewives,

834
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:05,630
the real housewives. Right? And it's
a sad story. The real story. Sad.

835
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,410
She's just trying to get attention and
she wants to write books and tried to

836
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:11,480
make money and she's a
single mom look like there's,

837
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:15,590
there's a lot of sadness behind it, the
reality, but when you see her on the show,

838
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:20,630
you see this big boisterous, you see a
lot of acting out, a lot of craziness,

839
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,850
and you would go, oh, well that girl is
a this, but if you, in reality she's not,

840
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,380
she's not a bad person,

841
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:32,560
but she's being this bad person because
she knows it's going to get a reaction.

842
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:35,330
It's not a good reaction.
It's not very well calculated one,

843
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:39,560
but I think that's a lot of what you
get from the so called social justice

844
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:41,060
warriors on Twitter.

845
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:45,680
He's Hashtag activist where you're getting
from a lot of people is they're in a

846
00:51:45,681 --> 00:51:47,480
fucking giant reality show.

847
00:51:47,630 --> 00:51:50,690
They're in a giant reality show and
their method of communication is through

848
00:51:50,691 --> 00:51:55,190
Twitter or through Facebook
posts or through youtube
videos or whatever the fuck

849
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:57,980
it is, but there were there,
when they're saying these things,

850
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:02,270
they're not just communicating,
they're communicating to try to get likes.

851
00:52:02,330 --> 00:52:05,510
They want to get up votes. They want
to, they want people to favorite,

852
00:52:05,511 --> 00:52:10,160
they're twins, they're twins, and
they're, it's calculated, it's fake.

853
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:15,580
There's a lot of bullshit to it and I
think you get a version of that in college

854
00:52:15,861 --> 00:52:20,861
campuses because to become like a really
radical advocate and a radical activist

855
00:52:21,341 --> 00:52:25,340
and really become a part of this sorta
even, I'm going to have a hunger strike.

856
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,990
Go for a Johnny there,
strike 5 cents on the dollar.

857
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:33,590
I'm going to starve myself.
Like, fuck yeah, you know, let's,

858
00:52:33,591 --> 00:52:36,680
let's fight back against white people.
Whatever you're doing, you know,

859
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,540
this is the thing. When they
say when they're only making
75 cents on the dollar,

860
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:45,590
I just want to politely raised my hand
and say, that's not quite accurate.

861
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,930
It's accurate in the
sense there is a wage gap,

862
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:51,080
but it can be explained innocently.

863
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:54,530
Women major in different
topics in college, they were,

864
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,910
they work fewer hours per week and the
men take the more dangerous jobs with

865
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,750
impossible hours. It's
simply a difference. When
you do all those adjustments,

866
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:06,440
the wage gap narrows to the point
of vanishing. So they are in,

867
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:10,580
they're enraged their virtue signaling
one another. True. That's true.

868
00:53:10,610 --> 00:53:12,590
So I thought though,

869
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:17,060
in specific occupations that women
would make less money than men.

870
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:19,160
Let's look at the occupations.
For example,

871
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:22,580
you will see doctors in male
doctors make considerably more.

872
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,190
But then you look at the, at the uh, sub

873
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:26,791
specialties,

874
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:30,630
men tend to go at far more men go into
the higher paying specialties like

875
00:53:30,631 --> 00:53:33,780
cardiology, uh, anesthesiology,

876
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:38,160
the lower paying fields are
pediatrics and family medicine.

877
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,650
Women are more likely to work part time.

878
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:45,570
They are more likely to take a few years
out of the workplace or cut back way

879
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:46,404
back.

880
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:51,150
These are differences that have to be
calculated in it have to be factored into

881
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,670
this calculation.

882
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:57,390
And the gender activists for years have,

883
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,520
have just put out this statistic.

884
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:03,690
Women are being cheated out of almost a
quarter of their salary. Uh, by you know,

885
00:54:03,691 --> 00:54:04,261
the,
this,

886
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:09,261
this system rigged against them when in
fact if there are innocent explanations,

887
00:54:10,021 --> 00:54:13,140
he look at what men and women
major in in college. It's amazing.

888
00:54:13,141 --> 00:54:16,740
After all these years of feminism,
you will not make very much money.

889
00:54:16,741 --> 00:54:21,150
If you want to go into early childhood
education, you will have a rewarding job.

890
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:22,590
If you love that and you know,

891
00:54:22,591 --> 00:54:26,250
many people do love it and
do very well personally,

892
00:54:26,251 --> 00:54:28,560
but you will not make
money if you want to close.

893
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:32,400
I lectured at overland college and they
were hissing and booing and carrying out

894
00:54:32,401 --> 00:54:33,990
crazy on you. They went crazy. Yes,

895
00:54:33,991 --> 00:54:38,991
they had a safe room and I triggered them
and I know in the first two rows there

896
00:54:39,591 --> 00:54:44,280
were young women with duct tape on their
mouth, duct tape, red duct tape. It was,

897
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:45,570
I didn't know what to say.

898
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,650
Duct tape their mouth and they stayed
there for the whole lecture. I mean,

899
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:52,410
how could you recovery two rows?
It's of hot.

900
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,370
Why did they do that?
I still don't know.

901
00:54:56,371 --> 00:54:59,340
I guess I could only think of there was a,

902
00:54:59,610 --> 00:55:04,390
a novel and I don't know what it was.
I still don't know. I didn't ask him,

903
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,700
ask. I never saw them. I mean they
were, oh, then people rushed out.

904
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,900
I triggered people and they went
to the safe room. I triggered,

905
00:55:11,901 --> 00:55:15,870
triggered about 30 people and a dog.
There was a therapy dog

906
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,280
and they went to this safer, I feel
bad about the dog. I do. But uh,

907
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,180
this was at Oberlin college and they were,

908
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:27,900
and what was interesting is
they had their safe room,

909
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,750
but the college administration
was looking at their Facebook,

910
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:34,650
Facebook postings in their antics
and got worried about my safety.

911
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:39,600
I had to have armed guards. I had two
armed police women squirting me around.

912
00:55:39,601 --> 00:55:42,150
How you police women though?
Yeah, we went with police.

913
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:45,530
When and why did they go and please
one Berlin, they had to be better,

914
00:55:45,531 --> 00:55:46,830
be perfectly correctly.

915
00:55:48,930 --> 00:55:53,070
If you get more correct than Oberlin
College, I mean, you will vaporize.

916
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,820
And I know, I dunno. What is the next
step? I'm just, I can't think. Yeah.

917
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,880
And I speak now. I grew up in
California, I was there for, what was,

918
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,650
my sister's generation is a little older.

919
00:56:04,651 --> 00:56:08,160
That was the free speech movement in
Berkeley. It was all about liberation.

920
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,280
Leave us alone. We do not want
authority figures or deans or you know,

921
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:17,280
assistant librarians on committees
making rules. We did not want it.

922
00:56:17,281 --> 00:56:20,610
We were belt and there was this period
when I was in college where we were just

923
00:56:20,611 --> 00:56:24,040
free. We had, I don't think
I ever met a dean, you know,

924
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:26,980
except it was something academic, but
it's certainly not in my personal life.

925
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,480
And we've, we drove out the dorm
advisors. There was no dorm advisor.

926
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,320
We were there. Well maybe they were then.
We never saw them. They had no power.

927
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,670
And now they want them to there. And
again, it's this going back. But anyway,

928
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:43,120
I just wanted to finish about Oakland.
I told the overland students,

929
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,810
they were saying, but women are
being cheated out of their salary.

930
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,330
And I explained and I said,
right now,

931
00:56:49,331 --> 00:56:53,710
today you can take a step to
closing the wage gap. No, no.

932
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:55,120
Don't major in,
you know,

933
00:56:55,121 --> 00:56:59,470
feminist dance therapy major
in electrical engineering.

934
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,150
And then so more minutes dance therapy
is so necessary for our culture.

935
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,040
Well they think it's an injustice.
You should be,

936
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:09,280
why can't I be in dance
therapist and you know,

937
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:11,830
why shouldn't I be rewarded
for that? And we do, you know,

938
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:15,700
people aren't paid for what
their jobs are worth. Well, um,

939
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,840
that's probably true.
And I said, I mean I,

940
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:21,880
I agreed with them that I don't
feel I am paid as a philosophy phd.

941
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:25,120
We are not well paid compared to other,
you know,

942
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:28,870
people with PhDs in computer science
or electrical engineering or petroleum

943
00:57:28,871 --> 00:57:31,960
engineering. There's with
the money is, and I said,

944
00:57:31,961 --> 00:57:36,670
I'm considered unfair is a philosopher
because we should be valued. But you know,

945
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,880
you realize there is
something called the market.

946
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:45,090
There are forces that
determine what people will pay
important for this as well.

947
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,300
There's in socialism, the feminist
stance therapist would get there.

948
00:57:49,301 --> 00:57:54,250
Do they get paid as much as the electrical
engineer? I'd like what'd you get?

949
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:55,150
Oh,

950
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,600
well how much do you think it's worth
for feminist dance therapy does that real

951
00:57:58,601 --> 00:58:03,460
thing? It might've been,
well, I'm being fanciful,

952
00:58:03,670 --> 00:58:08,230
but there are crazy majors and you know,
and they waste their time.

953
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,020
And I,

954
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:12,520
I was one speaking at Bryn Mawr while I
was actually at Haverford and the Bryn

955
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:16,270
Mawr girls came, is it still a women's
college? And they, first of all,

956
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:18,070
they were knitting the
whole time I was talking,

957
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:20,800
they were knitting and I didn't
know what that meant. If it was a,

958
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,920
and they turned to be a number
of wiccans in the audience.

959
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:28,950
They weren't on my side. They weren't
against me. They seemed it. Yeah.

960
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:33,880
They weren't mad at me. So I didn't want
any headaches. Any name spells Catholic.

961
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:35,710
The real witches.
Wiccan.

962
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:39,120
Yeah. I don't think they're
witches. I think they are.

963
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,280
I think Wiccan is like a,

964
00:58:41,281 --> 00:58:44,460
it's almost like a pagan worshiping
the earth sort of a thing.

965
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:49,890
Well, they defend witches.
They do. Yeah. Because I, I,

966
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,810
I read it.

967
00:58:51,811 --> 00:58:55,860
Something about the witch hunt
on the campus and a Wiccan came,

968
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:57,120
was angry about it.

969
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:02,520
Here's a Wiccan as a member of the pagan
revivalist religion known as Wicca can

970
00:59:02,561 --> 00:59:05,040
be a male or female
practitioner or lay follower,

971
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:08,200
either solitary or members of a coven.

972
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:13,470
Um hmm. Hmm. No with
no word, which no long.

973
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:17,020
I'm sure there's more followers
of neo pagan religion.

974
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:21,980
Wiccans are a polytheistic
nature worshipers.

975
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,720
They worship a moon goddess and a
Horn, God, the observe eight Sabbaths,

976
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,550
Blah Blah Blah. They are based
off seasonal changes in harvest,

977
00:59:30,551 --> 00:59:35,551
which are also represent changes in their
God and goddess wiccans are not evil

978
00:59:35,691 --> 00:59:37,630
and generally did not do bad badge.

979
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:40,520
So I guess it's saying that
they implying they do do magic.

980
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,560
They follow rule of three,

981
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,700
the belief that whatever you do comes
back to you three times as bad or good

982
00:59:46,701 --> 00:59:50,730
depending on what it was you
did in some respects, Wiki,

983
00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:55,310
whatever. Well, they sound fine. These
young women were fine I guess at the at,

984
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:59,700
but um, one of them, not one of them,
but a young woman in the audience said,

985
00:59:59,701 --> 01:00:03,270
are you telling me I'm a gender
studies major at Bryn Mawr?

986
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,750
You telling me I've wasted four
years and I didn't know what to say,

987
01:00:06,751 --> 01:00:11,460
but then I just said yes. Oh, and it was
like, and the audience would have laughed,

988
01:00:11,461 --> 01:00:16,461
but I'm just telling anyone who's even
thinking of wasting four years studying

989
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:20,490
gender theory,
which has not,

990
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:24,150
which has no basis in reality
or in in serious scholarship.

991
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:25,530
I'm sure there's some exceptions,

992
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,060
but those exceptions don't come close
to the rule, which is that it's,

993
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:34,260
it's a waste of time.
I would have told young lady that anything

994
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:37,680
that you do where you're thinking
is not a waste of time. Right?

995
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,200
But if you're trying
to make a lot of money,

996
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:43,050
gender studies is not
necessarily where it's at.

997
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:48,000
Right? Well, this is the thing. If you ask
men and women, what do you want you and,

998
01:00:48,001 --> 01:00:51,090
and we have great data on this
from vocational counselors.

999
01:00:51,091 --> 01:00:54,090
You remember in junior high
they were vocation counselors.

1000
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:57,840
It would tell you what you should be
based on your abilities and interests.

1001
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:02,340
We've been giving these tests for years
in men and women answered somewhat

1002
01:01:02,341 --> 01:01:05,880
differently.
And women care more about fulfillment.

1003
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,480
They care about more about jobs.
Where they can be.

1004
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:14,610
Women are very attracted to jobs that
involve caring and nurturing and men

1005
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:18,480
considerably less. So you do find
far more men in sort of people.

1006
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:23,130
Free zones are jobs where they, oh they
asked people, would you rather spend,

1007
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,750
you know a week taking a part of machine
and putting it back together or would

1008
01:01:27,751 --> 01:01:31,170
you rather spend a week sitting with
a group of people talking about their

1009
01:01:31,171 --> 01:01:36,171
problems and far more men say they'd
want to be with the machine and far more

1010
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:40,800
women say talk about the problem.
So you have to factor those in.

1011
01:01:40,801 --> 01:01:45,801
Now it just turns out that overall if you
are working with say computers and you

1012
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:49,860
are, you're an engineer, you're at
that high level with the education,

1013
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:54,930
you get paid well. People
need those skills. If you
have the skills of a nurturer,

1014
01:01:54,931 --> 01:01:57,840
you do need the education in
the background. But a lot,

1015
01:01:57,841 --> 01:02:00,060
there are a lot of people that
want to do them and there aren't.

1016
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:04,020
There just isn't. Where is the money?
Who's going to pay you that kind of money?

1017
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:08,700
So they do not earn as much and
they resent that. But as you say,

1018
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:12,420
you would tell the young woman,
you, I would tell them, you know,

1019
01:02:12,421 --> 01:02:15,360
you're not gonna make as much,
but she probably would say, but,

1020
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,300
but it interests me. I mean, I, I,

1021
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:22,370
someone could have told me don't major
in major in metallurgy or petroleum

1022
01:02:23,371 --> 01:02:26,220
engineering. I wouldn't even want
to see the textbook for that.

1023
01:02:26,221 --> 01:02:29,400
I loved my philosophy books and if
they told me you won't hurt as much,

1024
01:02:29,401 --> 01:02:33,750
but it didn't, if it does matter to
you, then change your major if you,

1025
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,340
if you're going into one of these fields.

1026
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:36,810
Well,
I think what you're saying,

1027
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,620
it highlights a real problem that human
beings have and choosing an occupation

1028
01:02:40,621 --> 01:02:43,080
and choosing what path they
want to go to in their life.

1029
01:02:43,081 --> 01:02:45,070
And I think oftentimes people,
they,

1030
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,770
they go the way they think is going to
earn them the most money instead of going

1031
01:02:49,771 --> 01:02:54,490
the way that's gonna make them fulfilled
and happy. And you, you, you're gonna,

1032
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:58,650
there's a lot of things that I could do
that I should maybe have done when I was

1033
01:02:58,651 --> 01:03:01,650
younger, if I wanted to
make money, just make money.

1034
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,770
And there's a lot of people my age that
are way more successful than me and make

1035
01:03:04,771 --> 01:03:07,740
way more money than me. I don't know
if they're happier than me though.

1036
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:11,820
And I think what I figured out how to do
somewhere along the line through trial

1037
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:13,890
and error is do things I actually enjoy.

1038
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,940
And somehow or another that's lost
in a lot of people and people say,

1039
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:20,490
oh well you go look you and you
can do that and this and that.

1040
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:23,100
It's not available to everybody,
man. I don't know that that's true.

1041
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:24,151
I don't know that that's true.

1042
01:03:24,151 --> 01:03:26,670
And I don't know that this is the only
thing that what I wound up doing is the

1043
01:03:26,671 --> 01:03:29,580
only thing that I actually love. I
love a lot of things. I love writing,

1044
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:30,900
I love art.
I love,

1045
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:33,690
there's a lot of things that I loved
that I probably could have been equally

1046
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:38,010
happy pursuing. I don't necessarily
think that when you look at life,

1047
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:42,300
you should look at it in terms of what
is the best way to make the most amount

1048
01:03:42,301 --> 01:03:45,570
of money. So when we're talking
about things like that, the wage gap,

1049
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:49,890
what about the happiness gap? Because men
are much more likely to commit suicide.

1050
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,670
That's one thing. Men, uh,

1051
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:55,350
I think a lot of men suffer
from depression as I'm
sure a lot of women do as

1052
01:03:55,351 --> 01:03:55,621
well.

1053
01:03:55,621 --> 01:04:00,621
But I don't necessarily think we
should look at it in terms of what is,

1054
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,810
what's going to earn you the most money.

1055
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,780
And is that what you're
preparing for in school?

1056
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:09,510
Every time someone uses
that wage gap statistic,

1057
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:13,960
that's how they're judging society and
they're saying women are cheated. No,

1058
01:04:13,970 --> 01:04:18,000
what you want to know is what they should
ask is how much do you like your job,

1059
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:21,600
how fulfilled you are, and then look
at the sex difference and see what,

1060
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:23,910
what it turns out,
maybe there is a happiness gap.

1061
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,100
There certainly is a fatality cap,

1062
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:30,990
which is that men are vastly more likely
to die on the job because men occupy

1063
01:04:31,050 --> 01:04:35,900
the gritty, dangerous jobs, you know,
working as loggers and roofers and it,

1064
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:40,500
you know, on uh, out, outside and
in, in uh, you know, on uh, you know,

1065
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:44,040
if fishing and fisheries and things,

1066
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,920
the dirty gritty jobs are done by men.

1067
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,820
It's like there's an invisible
army of men doing all of this work.

1068
01:04:50,821 --> 01:04:53,910
There's a big construction
site near where I live in,

1069
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:58,080
in Washington DC and they
are building a big complex.

1070
01:04:58,590 --> 01:05:01,800
I have seen dozens of men out there ever,

1071
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:06,030
not a single woman every day for a year.
It could be cold, it can be really hot.

1072
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:10,260
They get there early, they stay. It's
just hard. BRAC backbreaking work.

1073
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,830
You never hear about
that, about the, you know,

1074
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:18,890
the unpleasantness gap or the or the
danger gap and all that has to be factored

1075
01:05:19,931 --> 01:05:24,490
in when it is. What you find is that
in the United States for the most part,

1076
01:05:24,970 --> 01:05:27,430
people are able to doing what they want.

1077
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:27,971
Well,

1078
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:31,210
are there jobs though that are closed
off to women that are very difficult for

1079
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:35,860
women to enter into? I'm sure that
there are the old boy network,

1080
01:05:35,861 --> 01:05:37,930
the glass ceiling and
those are the the drops.

1081
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,290
But here's the thing about
that. People say, well, uh,

1082
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:45,160
there aren't as many female physicists.
If you look in the sciences,

1083
01:05:45,161 --> 01:05:49,530
women are flourishing in fields like
biology that we've all been taken over a

1084
01:05:49,531 --> 01:05:52,750
veterinary medicine.
These used to be male dominated,

1085
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,790
but women once women,

1086
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:57,270
once the gates were open and we
could sort of do what we wanted,

1087
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,720
there weren't these arbitrary barriers.

1088
01:05:58,721 --> 01:06:03,160
Women just moved in and into areas
that had been once just more or less

1089
01:06:03,161 --> 01:06:07,360
restricted to males.
They did not do that with engineering.

1090
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:10,650
They didn't do it with computer science.
And what I want,

1091
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,750
I need to know as well are the
computer scientists and the engineers,

1092
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:16,750
are they really sexist in the way
that like lawyers that you wouldn't,

1093
01:06:16,751 --> 01:06:18,070
men used to be all the lawyers.

1094
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:22,780
Lawyers aren't known to be particularly
sensitive and where they so much more

1095
01:06:22,781 --> 01:06:26,200
receptive to women because women are
approaching parody with men now and in law

1096
01:06:26,201 --> 01:06:27,034
school for sure.

1097
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:32,520
And so you have to look at the where men
and women are in our society and I as a

1098
01:06:32,921 --> 01:06:35,740
free society and an an educated society.

1099
01:06:36,040 --> 01:06:40,300
I credit it to personal aspiration
and I think in the road to happiness,

1100
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:42,220
men and women take
somewhat different paths.

1101
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:47,680
College seems like such a mad dash to a
mad dash to figure out your path is four

1102
01:06:47,681 --> 01:06:50,020
years and then graduate school.

1103
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:52,780
But the but the four years
of trying to figure it out,

1104
01:06:52,781 --> 01:06:54,700
like figure out what your
occupation is going to be,

1105
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:57,190
where you're going to go and what you're
gonna do and then you look at all these,

1106
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:00,430
suppose at barriers and boundaries that
are in front of you that are going to

1107
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:04,240
prevent you from doing what you want
to do or getting the way of you being

1108
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:06,520
justly rewarded for
what you're going to do.

1109
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:10,280
That's why I get mad at some of my family
has colleagues for constantly telling

1110
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:12,830
Young Women, oh, tech tech
is rigged against you.

1111
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:16,730
No it's not the guys in
tech for the most part.

1112
01:07:16,731 --> 01:07:19,880
There are exceptions but for the most
part are welcoming and many of them have,

1113
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,151
you know,

1114
01:07:20,151 --> 01:07:23,750
want to have more women because there
it looks bad and not to have them.

1115
01:07:23,751 --> 01:07:26,690
So they're doing what they can and,
but we're telling young women,

1116
01:07:26,691 --> 01:07:27,680
oh you're not welcoming the tech.

1117
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:32,330
Well there was a time women
weren't welcome in law or
medicine or philosophy and

1118
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:34,870
things changed and it,
and,

1119
01:07:34,871 --> 01:07:39,440
and I suspect by now that the reason you
don't find high percentage of women in

1120
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:44,180
tech is because women just aren't as
interested in tech as they are and other

1121
01:07:44,181 --> 01:07:44,830
things.

1122
01:07:44,830 --> 01:07:48,370
Well and be careful what you wish for
because I have a friend who's an executive

1123
01:07:48,371 --> 01:07:53,110
at Google and she makes a shit ton of
money, but she works ungodly hours.

1124
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,210
I mean it is essentially her life.

1125
01:07:55,211 --> 01:07:57,940
She is glued to her phone when she's
not at work. When she's at work,

1126
01:07:57,941 --> 01:08:02,650
she's there all day long, 14, 15
plus hours a day. It's, it's brutal.

1127
01:08:02,651 --> 01:08:07,120
It's backbreaking. It becomes, it's
not, it's not a career. It's your life.

1128
01:08:07,121 --> 01:08:10,210
You're giving up your,
what you have afterwards.

1129
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:12,970
I don't care if you make $5 million
a year, whatever the fuck you make,

1130
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,640
your life is nonexistent. I mean, what
are you gonna do? You gonna fill it up.

1131
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,810
I've got to buy a new Tesla.

1132
01:08:17,811 --> 01:08:21,260
You're gonna feel great staring at your
TV for the two hours that you're awake

1133
01:08:21,261 --> 01:08:22,740
before you pass out and
you have to go to work

1134
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,890
again. You never home. I'm
sure that for those who do it
and get, you know, they're,

1135
01:08:26,910 --> 01:08:30,780
they're probably having a, yeah, a
great ride. Here's what we do know,

1136
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,630
and this has been shown over
and over again by researchers,

1137
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:38,430
including a research at the Pew
Research Center, men and women.

1138
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:42,150
Um, if you ask as a pew has
done, you ask mothers, like,

1139
01:08:42,151 --> 01:08:47,070
what is your ideal life? Mothers of
young children, a large majority of,

1140
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:50,310
well actually with Ltl,
first start with women because this was,

1141
01:08:50,311 --> 01:08:52,670
I'm a researcher at the
London School of Economics.

1142
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:54,840
You'd studied women in Western Europe.
What do women want?

1143
01:08:54,841 --> 01:08:59,670
She found out about 20% want to be full
time careers. Like your friend at Google,

1144
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,430
they are out there, they want the
money, they want the power, they want,

1145
01:09:02,431 --> 01:09:06,780
they want it all. 20% about 20%
want to be stay at home mothers.

1146
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,510
They want to have a bunch of kids stay
home, be a house, what you know they,

1147
01:09:09,511 --> 01:09:13,140
and they will not work unless
they're for 60% are she calls.

1148
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:16,200
So they're sort of in the middle.
They want to work part time.

1149
01:09:16,201 --> 01:09:17,970
When they have little kids
they want to go in and out.

1150
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:22,260
So I think that right now we have a
women's movement that works very hard for

1151
01:09:22,261 --> 01:09:24,660
that 20% for their life,
you know,

1152
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:28,890
preferences and the majority of women
are left out and majority of women don't

1153
01:09:28,891 --> 01:09:33,150
want that. What your friend has,
that's good, but a lot of women won't,

1154
01:09:33,151 --> 01:09:33,960
will not want that.

1155
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,720
And there is just about as many women
that would want the quite the opposite.

1156
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:41,310
So what I want is a feminism that
accommodates preference and what do,

1157
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,990
what do people want Brian?

1158
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:46,290
And if I found out that all these women
wanted to work full time and the men

1159
01:09:46,291 --> 01:09:48,840
wanted to stay home with the kids,
fine.

1160
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:51,750
But what you find is that
that works for a few people,

1161
01:09:51,751 --> 01:09:56,730
but it's not something most people seem
to watch and it's regardless of gender

1162
01:09:56,731 --> 01:09:57,564
really.

1163
01:09:57,690 --> 01:09:59,220
I mean,
don't we want that across the board?

1164
01:09:59,221 --> 01:10:01,790
I mean there's a wide variety
of human beings on this.

1165
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,570
Yes. For men too. I, yeah, I
call myself a feminist, but I do,

1166
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:10,670
it used to mean that you believed
in equality of the sexes. Right.

1167
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:13,580
And I'm so I try to hang onto the,
it's classical meaning,

1168
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:18,410
but now it's come to mean,
as I said, female chauvinism.
You only care about women.

1169
01:10:18,411 --> 01:10:20,020
And I'm not that.
I do not want it.

1170
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,580
That kind of feminine. One of the things
that I have found that's hilarious,

1171
01:10:22,581 --> 01:10:26,210
it keeps getting repeated over and over
again in feminist blogs and websites,

1172
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:31,240
is they want to dress men's issues
until all women's issues are that they

1173
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:34,280
believe that feminism
addresses everything.

1174
01:10:34,281 --> 01:10:38,900
There's no need for no need for men's
rights advocacy because feminism addresses

1175
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,734
everything.

1176
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:44,770
And once a women are equal and
treated equally and supported equally,

1177
01:10:45,981 --> 01:10:48,860
and you,
you won't have any problems with men.

1178
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:52,000
I don't understand the
rational basis for that.

1179
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:56,360
We can't do some good and in many,
many places at once. Of course. Yeah.

1180
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:56,611
Well,

1181
01:10:56,611 --> 01:11:00,750
you can't even acknowledge that there's
issues because until the women's issues,

1182
01:11:00,751 --> 01:11:01,800
which are overwhelming,

1183
01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:05,390
all right. Until their address, if every
person out there that thinks that way,

1184
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:07,520
that is a sign that you are fanatical,

1185
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:12,420
certainly are. But it's also a bit of
trolling because it's, uh, you're, you're,

1186
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:14,070
you're trolling support

1187
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:15,690
from the people that read it and go,
yeah.

1188
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:20,970
And you're also trolling
for an overreaction from
the men, which we'll go see,

1189
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,610
these men are assholes and
they hate women. You know,

1190
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:26,970
I read this one woman's blog
and she was, uh, she was,

1191
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:30,760
she was saved up all of her mean
tweets that she got from it.

1192
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:34,530
He's anonymous retards out
there. And uh, she said, uh, the,

1193
01:11:34,590 --> 01:11:37,530
what are these men have in common?
These are all men who hate women. No,

1194
01:11:37,531 --> 01:11:42,360
these are all men who tweeted you and
you responded to them like they're

1195
01:11:42,361 --> 01:11:45,810
trolling you. They're saying mean
shit. You're a public figure.

1196
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:49,800
You write a public blog, you put
your, your public Twitter out there.

1197
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,580
So every day you're going
to, if you have a net, okay,

1198
01:11:53,581 --> 01:11:57,030
you throw that net in the ocean every
get day gonna catch a certain amount of

1199
01:11:57,031 --> 01:11:59,880
different species. Okay,
you're going to catch tuna,

1200
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,940
catch a Marlin or two and you're
going to catch a few retards.

1201
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:06,570
You're going to catch some really dumb
people and those really dumb people are

1202
01:12:06,571 --> 01:12:10,170
going to tweet you and you're going to
copy those down every day and accumulate

1203
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:14,070
them. Well, how many really smart people
read what you had to say, disagreed,

1204
01:12:14,071 --> 01:12:17,820
agreed, whatever, and didn't tweet
you. You know, like what, what you're,

1205
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:20,610
what you're getting is,
is it's a bias sampling.

1206
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,760
And by saving that bias
sampling and putting up there,

1207
01:12:23,761 --> 01:12:27,720
it's not proof that you're being
somehow or another you being oppressed.

1208
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:31,770
It's proof that you're, you're crazy
and you're, you're paying attention.

1209
01:12:31,771 --> 01:12:35,310
These dummies, you're, you're
tapping into a well of human beings.

1210
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:37,860
If you have something that
reaches a million people,

1211
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:42,600
if you have a blog or a youtube video
and you read the comments on them,

1212
01:12:42,750 --> 01:12:47,520
you're reaching a phenomenal amount of
human beings and you're always going to

1213
01:12:47,521 --> 01:12:52,521
have a certain percentage of human beings
who are unbalanced or they're fucked

1214
01:12:53,011 --> 01:12:57,500
up in the head in some way or the
really dumb and those people there,

1215
01:12:57,710 --> 01:12:59,990
they're going to be more
likely to comment you. Right?

1216
01:12:59,991 --> 01:13:04,991
So if you have a a million people
that read a 1% is a lot of people,

1217
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:07,830
that's a lot. Yeah. You
know, if you have a hundred,

1218
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:11,580
one person out of a hundred is going
to be done. You have a thousand,

1219
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,370
you get to 100,000 you get to a million.

1220
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,870
That's a giant number of people that
you're probably catching in your net that

1221
01:13:18,871 --> 01:13:22,830
are really stupid. And that's,
it's a part of this life we live,

1222
01:13:22,831 --> 01:13:25,200
it's a part of this new
era of social media,

1223
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:29,400
this new era of this open access
to everyone and everything.

1224
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:31,320
And I think it's beautiful
and a lot of ways,

1225
01:13:31,620 --> 01:13:35,520
I think it's exposing all the
holes and flaws and our culture.

1226
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:37,380
It's exposing how there's,

1227
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,350
there's marginalize and unrepresented
people that are just sort of,

1228
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:41,610
they feel disenfranchised,

1229
01:13:41,611 --> 01:13:44,850
they feel left out and they feel like
the only way they can get attention is to

1230
01:13:44,851 --> 01:13:49,320
scream or yell or to say misogynists
things are hateful things and they're just

1231
01:13:49,321 --> 01:13:51,540
trying to get attention
the end of the day.

1232
01:13:51,541 --> 01:13:53,820
That's a lot of what they're trying to do.
They're trying to end it.

1233
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:57,210
But I'll also say the things that I
write about because I do think, uh,

1234
01:13:57,420 --> 01:14:00,450
I am just speaking common
sense about gender.

1235
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:05,160
And then I have a lot of followers on
Twitter and people that I encounter who

1236
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:10,050
are from the factual feminist who are just
happy. They were able to find someone.

1237
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,990
And it's of absurd that you can

1238
01:14:12,040 --> 01:14:15,310
can't find a professor. I mean, I left
the university to go to a think tank.

1239
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:18,490
I could still be there teaching,
but it was lonely.

1240
01:14:18,910 --> 01:14:23,170
I didn't really have that many colleagues
who were agreed with me and I had some

1241
01:14:23,171 --> 01:14:27,010
that were very annoyed with me.
So it wasn't a comfortable place.

1242
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:31,240
So there's for a dissident feminist
or just a, I think as I said,

1243
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:32,440
the voice of moderation,

1244
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:35,950
they will not hear that if they're on
campus and now you don't hear it in the

1245
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:36,340
media.

1246
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:41,260
So social media is a place where you
can tell the truth and people can be

1247
01:14:41,261 --> 01:14:45,910
exposed to ideas that have been edited
out of the curriculum where you're an

1248
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:49,840
author and you've written books and
you've written papers and people have read

1249
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:53,110
those, but they're not going
to have the near the immediacy.

1250
01:14:53,111 --> 01:14:55,690
That's something like a youtube video has.
So what's,

1251
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,160
what's fantastic about than
anything like these videos,

1252
01:14:58,161 --> 01:15:00,070
they've had over 4 million views,

1253
01:15:00,071 --> 01:15:04,000
I think if you add them all up and
some more than others. But, uh,

1254
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:06,850
we have a good one coming out tonight.
On the myth of male power.

1255
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:10,120
I think you might like it. So men
are in power. Well, this whole thing,

1256
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:12,820
men are supposed to, uh, well it's
not, it's not the myth of male power.

1257
01:15:12,821 --> 01:15:15,520
It's about male privilege. They
tell man, check your privilege.

1258
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:20,690
And so I look at men's,
how privileged are men in our society now?

1259
01:15:20,691 --> 01:15:24,550
In some ways they are just to be a
man does afford you certain benefits,

1260
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,230
but so does being a woman like big time,
we're better educated. We live longer,

1261
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:33,670
we're farming better educated.
So, oh, majority of degrees.

1262
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:34,870
Go to women.

1263
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:40,410
Women now earn 57% of bachelors
approaching 60% of master's and uh,

1264
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,260
52% of PhDs.
Wow.

1265
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,680
It was used to be the reverse that you
had more men getting the degrees and

1266
01:15:47,681 --> 01:15:50,320
women where the have nots.
When was the shift? Well,

1267
01:15:50,321 --> 01:15:54,880
it started to shift actually
in the eighties in the
nineties you know, it's just,

1268
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:56,710
it was an upward trajectory for women.

1269
01:15:56,830 --> 01:16:00,070
And here's where it really
counts among working class kids.

1270
01:16:00,730 --> 01:16:03,280
The girls are better
educated than the boys are.

1271
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:08,260
If you look at different ethnic
groups, African Americans, Latinos,

1272
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:12,710
working class, white kids,
um, their sister, the boy,

1273
01:16:12,740 --> 01:16:13,840
the girls are doing better,

1274
01:16:14,130 --> 01:16:17,740
the boys are in big trouble educationally
and it's creeping into the middle

1275
01:16:17,741 --> 01:16:21,040
class. The girls are way ahead.
They're winning the prizes.

1276
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:24,940
There's a gap in education and
boys are on the wrong side.

1277
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,190
Do you attribute that to the women's
rights movement and the, the,

1278
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:33,100
the gains that were made in awareness?
We like during the 70s and the 80s,

1279
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,930
I attributed to a number of things.
First of all,

1280
01:16:34,931 --> 01:16:38,980
girls have always liked school better
and teachers that feel like, like girls,

1281
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:40,630
girls are better behaved on average.

1282
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:45,100
So it was always a trick to
interest a boy keep his attention.

1283
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:49,180
Um, but teachers use to make a
big effort. They don't anymore.

1284
01:16:49,300 --> 01:16:50,860
If they go to a school of education,

1285
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:53,860
they may be reading these fashionable
texts about how women are,

1286
01:16:53,861 --> 01:16:57,880
the silenced underprivileged.
And so they think that they have to,

1287
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:02,140
you know, uh, focus on
the girls and the boys,

1288
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:05,950
that the typical behavior of little
boys has been redefined as pathology.

1289
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:11,330
So you'll find little boys being
suspended for playing cops and robbers or

1290
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:15,800
wanting to play, uh, a raucous
game in the playground,

1291
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,720
dodge ball or tag.

1292
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,500
Now girls like to play to
a outdoors and have recess,

1293
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:25,340
but typically they will do a little
bit of that. They will also do that.

1294
01:17:26,300 --> 01:17:29,120
A lot of theatrical imaginative games,
playing house,

1295
01:17:29,121 --> 01:17:33,560
playing school or sharing confidences
with your best friend. You know,

1296
01:17:33,561 --> 01:17:35,330
girls do that.
Boys hardly ever do that.

1297
01:17:35,540 --> 01:17:39,260
They want to go out there and this rough
housing or it's called rough and tumble

1298
01:17:39,261 --> 01:17:43,220
play schools who are making rules
against it. They don't understand that.

1299
01:17:43,221 --> 01:17:47,690
It's very different from aggression
when boys are being mean and aggressive,

1300
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:52,520
violent, let's say. Uh, there's, there are
tears, there's anger, there's, you know,

1301
01:17:52,660 --> 01:17:56,450
it's, it's not a happy site when
boys are rough and tumbling,

1302
01:17:56,750 --> 01:18:00,080
there's joy there. Forging
bonds, they're learning limits.

1303
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:02,270
It's critical part of their socialization.

1304
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,770
And we are a society that has lost touch
with that and we are defining it as

1305
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:09,980
pathology.
And it happens as early as preschool.

1306
01:18:10,490 --> 01:18:14,150
And parents should know that when
your little boy gets to, you know,

1307
01:18:14,160 --> 01:18:19,040
the kindergarten class,
it is geared towards the girls.

1308
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:24,750
What do you think is the cause of
this lack of understanding between the

1309
01:18:24,751 --> 01:18:26,940
difference between the way
boys play and girls play?

1310
01:18:26,941 --> 01:18:28,200
Because I have all daughters,

1311
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:32,400
but I have a buddy that has all sons and
when I'm around his house and I see his

1312
01:18:32,401 --> 01:18:36,690
kids, it's fucking houses. Chaos is cal.
Everything's broken. Broken. Yeah. And,

1313
01:18:36,691 --> 01:18:39,930
and he's not an aggressive guy at all.
He's a,

1314
01:18:39,931 --> 01:18:44,850
he's a professor actually at Stanford
and he's like super mellow and like he's,

1315
01:18:44,851 --> 01:18:47,620
he doesn't, he barely exercises. He
rides his bike. He's not aggressive.

1316
01:18:47,621 --> 01:18:50,910
It doesn't watch any sports. And these
kids are fucking maniacs right there.

1317
01:18:50,911 --> 01:18:51,331
Run around.

1318
01:18:51,331 --> 01:18:55,200
They'd throw jumping sidekicks against
the couch and they're just fucking crazy.

1319
01:18:55,390 --> 01:18:58,620
And that's how the my, my little girls
come over his house and they're like,

1320
01:18:58,621 --> 01:19:01,350
Jesus Christ. Like, what is
going on with these apes?

1321
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:04,260
Well, I have two sons and for years,
anybody who would come, the main thing,

1322
01:19:04,261 --> 01:19:06,540
as long as it was get a football
and go outside and throw it around,

1323
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:10,110
they want to know. I just don't recall
wanting to do that at someone's house.

1324
01:19:10,111 --> 01:19:13,890
I mean, we might do that, but we'd
probably go into her room and you know,

1325
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,350
be talking and listening to
music or something. But these,

1326
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,930
and the other thing I learned
too about boys with video games,

1327
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,280
my parents were very disapproving
teachers don't like them,

1328
01:19:23,281 --> 01:19:28,281
but I always remember I'd go and see my
son downstairs at playing these games.

1329
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,950
And uh,
I was writing my book,

1330
01:19:31,951 --> 01:19:35,190
the war against boys and people
were worried about the games.

1331
01:19:35,670 --> 01:19:37,590
And when I looked at the
boys and I didn't see it,

1332
01:19:37,670 --> 01:19:41,250
and some of the games were wild and
violent and I didn't like what I saw,

1333
01:19:41,251 --> 01:19:45,420
but they were cheering each other on.

1334
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:48,180
They were teasing each other
the way boys do. I mean,

1335
01:19:48,181 --> 01:19:52,710
men show their love by insults and razzing
it, you know, it was, it was comradery.

1336
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:57,370
It was, it was just bonding.
It was a happy, if you know,

1337
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:02,730
group engagement and it would have been
terrible to say you stop playing these

1338
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:06,780
games and this is bad. It wasn't bad
behavior. But people don't understand it.

1339
01:20:06,781 --> 01:20:11,640
They hear putting each other down and
you have to listen because when men put

1340
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:15,510
each other down, including men and boys,
it's often the way they show friendship.

1341
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:18,210
You tall man, I'm a comedian.
That's all we ever tell you do.

1342
01:20:18,240 --> 01:20:22,140
If I ever based my own self esteem and
how my friends have talked to me, right,

1343
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:26,970
I'd be fucked. No, my two sons, all they
do, they get together. It's immediately,

1344
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:31,860
but it does, it does make Ben Funny Cause
they learn it starting in, you know,

1345
01:20:31,861 --> 01:20:34,710
first grade because there's this
the way boys are with each other,

1346
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,050
but we have psychologists and say,
oh no,

1347
01:20:37,051 --> 01:20:40,170
it's a culture of cruelty
and they think it's bullying.

1348
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:44,250
You've got to know the difference
between affectionate, you know,

1349
01:20:44,251 --> 01:20:48,780
kind of joshing and teasing
and violent bullying.

1350
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:51,700
It's something, and we, again,
we're not making good distinction.

1351
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,610
And I think there's also,

1352
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,640
there's something to be gained from that
type of insulting behavior with boys

1353
01:20:59,551 --> 01:21:03,390
and even teasing each other back and
forth as long as it's good natured.

1354
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:07,620
Because even though it does kind of sting
when someone mocks you and makes fun

1355
01:21:07,621 --> 01:21:11,100
of you, it also motivates you to do better
at whatever they were mocking you out.

1356
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:15,480
And it strengthens you. And men
are a little more stoical. Andy, I,

1357
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:19,830
I read this great study by
the psychologists. They,
they, we always hear, well,

1358
01:21:19,831 --> 01:21:22,260
men have to talk more about
their feelings. Men have to be,

1359
01:21:22,590 --> 01:21:26,630
and they interviewed hundreds of kids,
adolescents,

1360
01:21:26,640 --> 01:21:28,770
and they asked the boys and the girls,

1361
01:21:28,771 --> 01:21:31,020
how does it feel to talk
about your problems?

1362
01:21:31,230 --> 01:21:33,720
And for most of the girls that made
them feel better just talking about the

1363
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:38,520
problems, the boys said it didn't make
him feel better. And they, and they said,

1364
01:21:38,550 --> 01:21:43,230
and it was weird, and, and
they, and, and I thought, oh,

1365
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:45,990
the psychologists are going to say,
the boys have to learn to do it.

1366
01:21:45,991 --> 01:21:50,400
But they didn't. What they said was,
hmm, maybe it's adaptive for young men,

1367
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:51,260
you know,
and,

1368
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:55,400
and because they don't ruminate so much
and there is a lot of depression in

1369
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:59,670
adolescent girls, there may be to
interiorize they, they're ruminating,

1370
01:21:59,671 --> 01:22:00,810
they're going over and over.

1371
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:05,490
And these psychologists said that they
thought it was probably, maybe the girls,

1372
01:22:05,530 --> 01:22:08,040
we should see what looked like
the boys are doing that, you know,

1373
01:22:08,180 --> 01:22:10,260
it's not necessarily the boys
have to be like the girls.

1374
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:14,040
And then they said something very
interesting. If a boy does have a problem,

1375
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:18,550
he's got to talk about it. Don't say, oh
well let's sit down and talks. We are,

1376
01:22:18,551 --> 01:22:23,070
you know, tell me your feelings.
He is going to re, you know, Bolt.

1377
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:27,480
You have to say, you have to engage
his problem solver, you know,

1378
01:22:27,481 --> 01:22:28,620
and you have to say,
we've got to do this.

1379
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:31,230
We got to conquer it and
turn it into a a challenge.

1380
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,630
And then when I read that I thought,
my God,

1381
01:22:33,631 --> 01:22:36,840
there's probably a whole field of
male psychology that's been ignored.

1382
01:22:36,841 --> 01:22:40,470
It's almost as if modern psychology and
clinical counseling has been based on

1383
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:44,020
women and their needs. And what
works for them. But what about what,

1384
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:47,400
what works for guys? Fortunately the
Australians are actually working on this.

1385
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:51,540
The Australians, they're working on male
psychology and veil, you know, counseling.

1386
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:56,310
Well, school is a very strange
place for everybody, right?

1387
01:22:56,311 --> 01:22:59,640
I mean you're, you're forced to
sit in a class and listen to uh,

1388
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:05,140
a course and the teacher's teaching you
the facts and Statistics and a might be

1389
01:23:05,201 --> 01:23:06,220
anything you're even remotely

1390
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,000
interested in.

1391
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,790
And we were seven years old or eight
years old and you're a little kid and you,

1392
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:12,790
you want to play, you're filled with
energy, you want to bounce off the wall.

1393
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:17,260
It's strange to have to sit in some
class and listen to someone talk to you

1394
01:23:17,261 --> 01:23:21,040
about arithmetic or listen to you talk,
talk about listening to someone,

1395
01:23:21,041 --> 01:23:24,730
talk to you about grammar,
reading. It's hard.

1396
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:28,870
It's hard for kids to sit and pay
attention. And it's hard I think when,

1397
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:34,140
if you are a boy and you have all this
extra energy and you are told there's

1398
01:23:34,961 --> 01:23:38,800
something wrong with you because of it.
I have my, uh, my old next door neighbor,

1399
01:23:38,801 --> 01:23:42,160
they moved out but they had
their kid on Ritalin and uh,

1400
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:45,820
I was around this kid all the time.
He wasn't, he wasn't fucked up.

1401
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:49,150
He just had a lot of energy and he was
kind of being ignored by both parents

1402
01:23:49,151 --> 01:23:50,940
worked all the time and you know,

1403
01:23:50,950 --> 01:23:55,630
he was bouncing off the walls and he was
just not paying attention in school and

1404
01:23:55,690 --> 01:24:00,100
acting out and wasn't, it wasn't very
disciplined like a lot of young boys are.

1405
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,750
So they just medicated this kid,
oh,

1406
01:24:01,751 --> 01:24:06,490
this makes my heart and
it's so sad because a good
teacher who was in tune with

1407
01:24:06,491 --> 01:24:10,630
boys, we'll find a way to
capture his imagination.

1408
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,280
Right now,
for example,

1409
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:17,260
most of the reading assignments are
fiction and is one just wonderful guy who

1410
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:20,710
goes around teaching how to engage boys.
He said,

1411
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,640
it's almost as if teachers only
like kind of the confessional poet.

1412
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,980
You ask a 12 year old boy
to be a confessional poet,
he's not going to do it.

1413
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:33,180
And he'll act out and he'll,
you know, won't do this.

1414
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:36,820
But I let them write what he wants.
And there was a,

1415
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:40,090
what happens though is little boys,
five or six years old,

1416
01:24:40,091 --> 01:24:42,820
they'll be asked to write something and
they want to write about something like,

1417
01:24:43,570 --> 01:24:43,901
you know,

1418
01:24:43,901 --> 01:24:47,230
I don't know a monster destroying a
city or about their skateboard or their

1419
01:24:47,231 --> 01:24:50,770
video games. And the teachers don't
like it. They get mad, they get mad.

1420
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:55,090
And fortunately there are some that are
beginning to notice because now people

1421
01:24:55,091 --> 01:24:57,640
are getting worried about what's
happening to boy's education.

1422
01:24:57,641 --> 01:25:00,230
Cause it has all sorts of
ramifications for the economy.

1423
01:25:00,231 --> 01:25:04,360
And you have to worry about having a
large cohort of boys disengaged from

1424
01:25:04,361 --> 01:25:08,380
education because they're not going to
have a future in an information economy.

1425
01:25:08,381 --> 01:25:11,290
We've got to solve the problem.
So there are teachers thinking about it.

1426
01:25:11,291 --> 01:25:15,730
But one thing they noticed is you take
a little boy and girls that are playing

1427
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,550
and play is the basis for learning.

1428
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:22,570
I mean that's how we learn is
as animals we learn from play.

1429
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:27,730
But boys are disapproved up. So they
want to play superhero, which every,

1430
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,880
not every but most four or five year
old boys, that's what they want.

1431
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,540
And vanquish the bad guys. And there
are, there's a lot of, you know,

1432
01:25:34,541 --> 01:25:37,480
sound effects and what
seems to be violence.

1433
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:41,200
It's actually something very different
going on in his imagination. But we are,

1434
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:41,411
we are,

1435
01:25:41,411 --> 01:25:45,610
we are policing the imagination of little
boys and calling them pathological.

1436
01:25:45,920 --> 01:25:47,440
And I just never forgot the story.

1437
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:52,120
I read about a little boy named Justin
in California and he was well behaved.

1438
01:25:52,121 --> 01:25:56,740
He loved sword fights and pirates.
The teacher called his parents.

1439
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,020
She was very worried about Justin.

1440
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:03,300
He'd written a story and illustrated
it with a scene with pirates having a,

1441
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,270
a sword fight. And there were, there was
chop heads and all sorts of things. Wild.

1442
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:11,870
And the parents came in and
said, yeah, what did he do?

1443
01:26:11,871 --> 01:26:13,760
They were shocked because he was
never in trouble. She said, well,

1444
01:26:13,761 --> 01:26:18,050
look at this drawing as if
Justin was a Prodo sociopath.

1445
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,050
And his father said, yeah, well
he likes pirates, you know,

1446
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:25,970
it makes me read them stories. And the
teacher was very worried about his values.

1447
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:26,900
Will,
the father said,

1448
01:26:26,901 --> 01:26:30,800
I'm very worried about my son's fate in
a classroom with a teacher that has no

1449
01:26:30,801 --> 01:26:32,570
sympathy for his imagination.

1450
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:36,770
What that father said about Justin.
That's,

1451
01:26:37,420 --> 01:26:40,630
that is pretty much describes
the predicament of a majority of,

1452
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:44,210
of boys in our schools right now.
The teachers don't have sympathy.

1453
01:26:44,211 --> 01:26:47,390
They haven't been taught.
Now most teachers are just,

1454
01:26:47,391 --> 01:26:50,090
they'll adjust and they like boys,
they'll do their best.

1455
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:53,150
But that is despite what they
learned in a school of education,

1456
01:26:53,151 --> 01:26:55,460
does this coincide with larger classrooms?

1457
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,880
Cause if you have 40 kids in a class
and one of them was a rambunctious boy,

1458
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:03,290
you want to silence that kid because he's
disrupting your educating the other 39

1459
01:27:03,291 --> 01:27:07,940
kids, some of it, it's everywhere.
It's in, it's in schools.

1460
01:27:07,941 --> 01:27:10,640
The majority of teachers,
it's a feminine profession.

1461
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:15,420
And the classrooms had been
feminized. The readings, the um,

1462
01:27:15,730 --> 01:27:18,890
I mean there are books that are
irresistible to a typical little boy,

1463
01:27:18,891 --> 01:27:19,970
but we don't assign them.

1464
01:27:19,971 --> 01:27:23,360
The British got so worried about the
reading gap cause girls are way ahead in

1465
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:27,380
reading. They now have a list of books
that, and teachers are aware of that uh,

1466
01:27:27,381 --> 01:27:30,920
books that a kid can't read a little
bit. I can't resist. We don't have that.

1467
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:34,640
We would immediately have
dozens of feminist groups.

1468
01:27:34,641 --> 01:27:38,480
They would be hearings on Capitol Hill,
the books and one of the subjects,

1469
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:43,340
well that does it. Just a few that I
remember. One is that a boy's like books,

1470
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:48,410
a lot of little boys like nonfiction and
if you give them the Guinness Book of

1471
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:53,000
Records, he could be lost for days. They
like things like that list of, you know,

1472
01:27:53,180 --> 01:27:57,710
arcane information. Give
him, give him a choice. And,

1473
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:02,510
and yes, sometimes stories about
a monster devouring a city.

1474
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:03,463
There are lots of books.

1475
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:08,480
There's actually a website called guys
can read and they have books and the best

1476
01:28:09,591 --> 01:28:14,150
of books for little boys with girls.
He really, you know, delegate there.

1477
01:28:14,151 --> 01:28:16,400
There's so many books written for them.
They're going to find them.

1478
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:19,550
Their teachers are going to assign them.
You can't assume that with your son.

1479
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:22,940
I sympathize for teachers though and
a lot of ways because if they are,

1480
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:27,050
especially a lot of teachers don't have
children and if they don't have children

1481
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:30,500
of their own and they're teaching a group
of boys and there's 40 kids there and

1482
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:35,501
one of them is a really rambunctious boy
who's a little maniac and he's running

1483
01:28:35,811 --> 01:28:36,830
around being crazy.

1484
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,460
I could see how you would want this
little kid to calm down and be silenced.

1485
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:41,960
I totally agree with you.

1486
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:47,020
But what if it turns out that there
are just ways to do this and that.

1487
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:51,410
What if you had a lot of assignments
where the kids have to stand up?

1488
01:28:51,411 --> 01:28:56,300
What if instead of in desks they have to
be sitting up? Boys, if you use humor,

1489
01:28:56,750 --> 01:28:58,790
boys will love you boys like jokes.

1490
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:01,830
Teachers have to try to be funny
even if they're not that funny.

1491
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,140
I read about this one male teacher,

1492
01:29:04,141 --> 01:29:06,900
he'd give back papers and you make
them into paper. Airplanes is,

1493
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,660
I mean there are just things
that are amusing to kids.

1494
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:14,910
My favorite example was a school
in uh, west, West Virginia.

1495
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:18,990
The boys in that school were not reading.
They were the low of the West.

1496
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:22,950
Virginia is the low. There are some of
the lowest scores in this school was bad,

1497
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:24,960
this wonderful.
It was a female teacher.

1498
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:30,260
She started an all boys class and she
had a 10 they called battle of the books.

1499
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:34,020
They had to read these books
and then have a, some kind of a,

1500
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:37,290
I think it was like a jeopardy
battle or some kind of game.

1501
01:29:38,190 --> 01:29:42,570
The boys loved it and they, they
wanted extra books to read over summer.

1502
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:45,270
And she said it was the first time
in the history of West Virginia.

1503
01:29:45,271 --> 01:29:49,430
The boys asked for extra reading over the
summer and they came back and the, the,

1504
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:54,550
like the sixth grade boy class did better
than the eighth grade coed class does.

1505
01:29:55,860 --> 01:29:57,690
This was working with,

1506
01:29:57,691 --> 01:30:01,000
or the ACL went in there
because there were uh,

1507
01:30:01,260 --> 01:30:05,190
gender activists in the Eselu that
said separating by gender as a kind of

1508
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:09,600
apartheid, gender apartheid.
And they sued, they apartheid,

1509
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:13,470
they call it gender apartheid or gender.
They compare it to discriminate.

1510
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:15,630
It's crazy.
And they stopped this class.

1511
01:30:15,631 --> 01:30:19,860
There is no boys class with
battle of the books. Oh God.

1512
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:20,820
So that's where we are.

1513
01:30:21,050 --> 01:30:23,360
There was a young boy that
was recently suspended.

1514
01:30:23,361 --> 01:30:26,300
It was a big national story because he,
uh,

1515
01:30:26,570 --> 01:30:28,430
had a fake bow and arrow.

1516
01:30:28,431 --> 01:30:32,360
He was using an imaginary bow and Arrow
and shooting at boys in his class.

1517
01:30:32,361 --> 01:30:36,200
And so they suspended him. I think he
was, it was very young. He's very young,

1518
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:37,063
younger than 10.

1519
01:30:38,380 --> 01:30:41,950
I've seen, I've heard stories about six
year olds. That's how they're playing.

1520
01:30:41,980 --> 01:30:44,020
And then when they play,
they want to write stories.

1521
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:46,810
So that's where you get kids like Justin,
he'll, he'll want to write about it.

1522
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:51,190
If you, we have a bunch of little
boys, the moment they set pen to paper,

1523
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:55,120
there's disapproval. That's probably
the worst thing that we can be doing.

1524
01:30:55,150 --> 01:30:56,170
And that's what's happening.

1525
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:59,290
When I was in high school, I wanted
to be a comic book illustrator. Right.

1526
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:00,260
Even before high school.

1527
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:05,500
And if any psychologist got
ahold of any of my illustrations,

1528
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:10,600
it was all like axe murderers,
like werewolves,

1529
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:15,170
dragons. It was all crazy like,
but I, that's what I enjoyed.

1530
01:31:15,171 --> 01:31:20,171
I enjoyed reading those kind of comic
books and I enjoyed drawing those things

1531
01:31:20,271 --> 01:31:22,370
like, and uh, I didn't turn out to be

1532
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:26,750
serial killer. They don't look
my best majority don't. And it's,

1533
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:28,280
but we tweeting them that way.

1534
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:30,490
Just the argument about
Gamers, right? I mean,

1535
01:31:30,491 --> 01:31:31,740
isn't that the argument about gamers?

1536
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:34,750
That was a big part of the
whole gamer gate. Um, the, the,

1537
01:31:34,751 --> 01:31:37,870
the response that gamers
had, I was like, no, look,

1538
01:31:37,871 --> 01:31:42,070
just because we'd like engaging in
this fantasy and just because we, like,

1539
01:31:42,071 --> 01:31:45,640
we enjoy playing grand theft auto doesn't
mean we're going to go out and shoot

1540
01:31:45,641 --> 01:31:48,730
people. This is stupid. It's,
it's fun to fake shoot people.

1541
01:31:48,940 --> 01:31:53,940
It's fun to play call of duty and have
your friends on the other side and you're

1542
01:31:54,371 --> 01:31:57,460
shooting your friends. You don't want
to shoot your friends. But guess what?

1543
01:31:57,461 --> 01:32:00,160
When you shoot your friends in the game,
nothing fucking happens to them.

1544
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:01,150
Okay.
It's very different

1545
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:03,980
cry, you know, this, know
that, you know, their,

1546
01:32:03,981 --> 01:32:06,010
their children don't grow
up without a father. No,

1547
01:32:06,011 --> 01:32:08,670
they regenerate and they're back
in the next round. I mean this,

1548
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:13,690
it's this idea that when you play a
game or what you engage in any sort of a

1549
01:32:13,931 --> 01:32:15,040
fantasy activity,

1550
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:19,270
that that automatically equates to
how you're going to behave in society.

1551
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:22,570
And that we have to stop that and we
have to limit that instead of just

1552
01:32:22,571 --> 01:32:26,020
addressing like what is it about these
fantasies that exciting is exciting for

1553
01:32:26,021 --> 01:32:30,730
people. Is there some sort of inherent
need that men have for adventure,

1554
01:32:30,860 --> 01:32:31,693
for

1555
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:36,730
certain amount of like carries violence,
you know, even if it's just cathartic,

1556
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:41,740
some sort of a fake release.
Absolutely. And the, there is not,

1557
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:46,790
there is no good evidence that playing
a violent video game makes you violent.

1558
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:50,230
But God knows people have tried
to prove it and they have failed.

1559
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:55,050
And they even tried to prove that to
the supreme court a few years ago. And,

1560
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:58,660
and Justice Scalia just head, he
wrote a beautiful, uh, you know,

1561
01:32:58,661 --> 01:33:02,000
opinion about how they just did
not make their case and it's,

1562
01:33:02,001 --> 01:33:04,900
it's no one has been able to do it.
Now they've come along and say,

1563
01:33:04,930 --> 01:33:07,060
oh well these games cause sexism.
Well,

1564
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:11,170
the first thing to know is since kids
started playing video games in great

1565
01:33:11,171 --> 01:33:13,540
numbers and the nine days video game,

1566
01:33:13,541 --> 01:33:17,290
nation crime has actually gone down.
I'm not saying there's a correlation,

1567
01:33:17,291 --> 01:33:21,040
but there's certainly no correlation
between playing games and visor or you

1568
01:33:21,041 --> 01:33:22,540
would expect that it would have gone up.
Well,

1569
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:26,080
games are addictive and they spent all
the time just playing those games and

1570
01:33:26,081 --> 01:33:29,050
they don't have time for violence.
That's what's going on. Possibly end.

1571
01:33:29,051 --> 01:33:30,940
And it's the millennial generation,

1572
01:33:30,941 --> 01:33:35,770
they're the last least
sexist and homophobic and all
that than other generations

1573
01:33:35,771 --> 01:33:38,470
such as games. Yeah, they
have more. Oh yeah, sure.

1574
01:33:38,500 --> 01:33:43,450
So the newest kids coming up are the most
open minded you took. Yes, absolutely.

1575
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,300
Beautiful.

1576
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:49,300
You questioned their attitudes compared
to kids from the 80 [inaudible] or

1577
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:51,340
certainly baby boomers you'd
find they're more open.

1578
01:33:51,820 --> 01:33:52,950
Isn't that amazing couple that,

1579
01:33:52,951 --> 01:33:57,010
well that speaks to my optimism because
my optimism is that what we're getting

1580
01:33:57,011 --> 01:33:59,620
out of the internet or getting
out of this a open forum,

1581
01:33:59,621 --> 01:34:01,600
this ability to communicate
with each other is,

1582
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:03,420
even though there's like there's the,

1583
01:34:03,421 --> 01:34:07,440
the sort of ganging up mentality on
someone when they say something wrong,

1584
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:08,111
the attacking.

1585
01:34:08,111 --> 01:34:13,111
But ultimately I think
people are communicating in
a freer way and we're getting

1586
01:34:14,741 --> 01:34:17,860
to understand what is
offensive about racism.

1587
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:20,880
What is offensive about
homophobia or sexism or,

1588
01:34:20,881 --> 01:34:25,881
or any of these things that were sort
of a cultural norms or would they had a

1589
01:34:27,341 --> 01:34:31,300
place in your particular neighborhood
or community and now you're community is

1590
01:34:31,301 --> 01:34:32,260
sort of the world.

1591
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:37,450
And in doing so and in expanding our
community like that and creating this one

1592
01:34:37,451 --> 01:34:39,000
world community,
I think we're,

1593
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:43,150
we're learning the differences that we
have between each other or more imagined

1594
01:34:43,151 --> 01:34:43,984
than they are are real.

1595
01:34:44,830 --> 01:34:49,480
Yeah. And I, it's, so I think that
anyway, about with the, with the Games,

1596
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:53,950
uh, they had just made all these
false assumptions and I think people,

1597
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:57,650
people try it, they do it
for you. We hear, oh well the

1598
01:34:58,570 --> 01:35:01,820
p the people are being destroyed by
the internet or people are being,

1599
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:04,850
some people are,
some are actually anything you do.

1600
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:07,580
They're going to be some that
are destroyed playing cards.

1601
01:35:07,581 --> 01:35:10,510
There's some people that are, will have
addictive personalities. I once met a sec,

1602
01:35:10,511 --> 01:35:14,630
can I just, he told me he was
studying people in their addictions.

1603
01:35:14,631 --> 01:35:19,631
He said almost anything people do about
5% if it's gambling or if it's bicycling

1604
01:35:20,901 --> 01:35:23,800
or dog racing are about 5% will become

1605
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,230
uh, compulsive. Well, you know,

1606
01:35:26,231 --> 01:35:29,920
I work with a lot of fighters and martial
artists cause I'm a commentator for

1607
01:35:29,921 --> 01:35:32,710
the UFC and in the comp in,
in working with these people,

1608
01:35:32,711 --> 01:35:35,050
you find correlations
between people that are,

1609
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:39,760
they become very excellent at at
fighting or something like streaming,

1610
01:35:39,761 --> 01:35:43,940
extremely dangerous and
they become more subject,

1611
01:35:43,941 --> 01:35:48,941
are more suspect [inaudible] they have
more potential for addiction I think in a

1612
01:35:49,481 --> 01:35:52,630
lot of ways. Outside of that,
like it's famous amongst fighters.

1613
01:35:52,631 --> 01:35:57,250
Like Joe Louis went on to become a
cocaine addict and he had a lot of issues

1614
01:35:57,430 --> 01:36:00,700
before he died.
Sonny Liston got involved in heroin.

1615
01:36:00,701 --> 01:36:03,850
They become addictive behavior is
extremely common with fighters.

1616
01:36:04,030 --> 01:36:06,820
Alcoholism is extremely common.
And um,

1617
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,760
ballet dancers really, well, certainly
for a while they'd have a lot of,

1618
01:36:10,840 --> 01:36:14,420
there's high levels of Anorexia,
kind of an obsession about food,

1619
01:36:14,421 --> 01:36:17,200
but also of a cocaine use.

1620
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:22,720
So maybe that a combination of
obsessive perfectionism. Yes. Well,

1621
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:25,790
I think the obsessive
focusing on something,

1622
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:28,370
even focusing on a negative
thing like gambling,

1623
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:33,700
it becomes a part of how they
transition out of this work.

1624
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:36,640
As the world of mixed martial arts
or fighting in general is very,

1625
01:36:36,940 --> 01:36:37,790
it's very intense,

1626
01:36:37,791 --> 01:36:42,050
but very s there's a short amount of time
where you could do it and compete at a

1627
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:46,070
high level. It's a percentage of your
life and you, if you get really lucky,

1628
01:36:46,071 --> 01:36:50,030
you can get 10 hard years in.
You know, if you're an outlier,

1629
01:36:50,031 --> 01:36:53,750
you can stretch that out. But a lot of
people that compete, like in the UFC,

1630
01:36:53,751 --> 01:36:58,280
they're gone within a couple of years.
And so you find that in a lot of sports,

1631
01:36:58,400 --> 01:36:59,360
the NFL as well,

1632
01:36:59,930 --> 01:37:03,500
a couple of years for most of them and
their bodies just can't hang on anymore

1633
01:37:03,501 --> 01:37:04,310
and they're gone.

1634
01:37:04,310 --> 01:37:08,900
And they had this one thing that
occupied all their thoughts all the time.

1635
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:10,250
Now it's gone.

1636
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:15,550
And they have to figure out a way to sort
of transfer that energy in a positive

1637
01:37:16,491 --> 01:37:21,160
manner. Yeah. And what makes you really
good at things can also be a trap.

1638
01:37:21,230 --> 01:37:25,190
I had a problem when I was young, uh,
with video games and uh, it's not,

1639
01:37:25,191 --> 01:37:28,130
the video games are bad,
but I have a very addictive personality.

1640
01:37:28,131 --> 01:37:31,070
And I used to play video games eight to
10 hours a day. I used to play online,

1641
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:35,180
I a game called quake quake game
online. And I recognize, I go, okay,

1642
01:37:35,240 --> 01:37:39,710
there's this is, I just can't do this.
Like my brain and this is a fun game.

1643
01:37:39,711 --> 01:37:40,490
I love it,

1644
01:37:40,490 --> 01:37:44,270
but my brain is just not good for this
because my brain had developed doing

1645
01:37:44,271 --> 01:37:48,860
martial arts and competent and competing
and I went from that to stand up

1646
01:37:48,861 --> 01:37:51,170
comedy. And then this, this other thing,

1647
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:55,890
this video game thing got implanted
in my brain and recognize like, okay,

1648
01:37:56,100 --> 01:37:59,280
this is not going to be productive for me.
It's enjoyable,

1649
01:37:59,281 --> 01:38:03,810
but I'm too crazy for this so I've
got to put it aside. But for a lot of,

1650
01:38:03,940 --> 01:38:07,860
a lot of people that get involved in
like the singular pursuits where they

1651
01:38:07,861 --> 01:38:10,890
become so dedicated and
so focused on one thing,

1652
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:15,930
it's extremely hard when that thing is
taken away from them and sometimes they

1653
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,490
fall into negative things,

1654
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,890
but that doesn't mean that
the video games or negative,

1655
01:38:20,200 --> 01:38:22,590
it doesn't mean that video games are
causing them to live their lives.

1656
01:38:22,591 --> 01:38:27,240
What they need is some sort of mental
management and we need to recognize that

1657
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:29,910
there are certain people,
especially people that are,

1658
01:38:29,970 --> 01:38:33,930
that excel at certain things or people
that become obsessed with perfection or

1659
01:38:33,931 --> 01:38:35,280
obsessed with success,

1660
01:38:35,490 --> 01:38:39,030
that those things you can get
diverted down these paths,

1661
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:42,000
whether it's gambling or if there's a
lot of different, I like that phrase,

1662
01:38:42,001 --> 01:38:44,340
mental management that that's right.
That's what they,

1663
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,810
that should be more available. So it's
not video games and it's not video.

1664
01:38:48,811 --> 01:38:52,200
Video Games don't turn you into a sexist
if video games don't turn you violent.

1665
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:53,670
It's nonsense.
I mean,

1666
01:38:53,671 --> 01:38:58,671
if this is arguably we have the
most access to violent information,

1667
01:38:58,951 --> 01:39:02,430
whether it's a, you know, in
a media form online, you know,

1668
01:39:02,460 --> 01:39:05,700
more more access to it than any human
beings that have ever lived before.

1669
01:39:05,701 --> 01:39:08,970
We have more access to
instantaneous violence,

1670
01:39:09,150 --> 01:39:13,110
seeing things online, seeing thing,
being able to play video, violent games.

1671
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:15,390
But it's arguably the
safest time to live ever.

1672
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:19,870
And some of the most violent games I hear
are in Japan and they are not violent.

1673
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:23,280
They played the most violent game. Like
what do they play? Violent video games.

1674
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:25,550
And they have a lot of,
uh,

1675
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:31,070
a very permissive internet presentation
of pornography and wild things during a

1676
01:39:33,361 --> 01:39:36,360
tentacles and stuff. Right.
I don't know. And I'm a

1677
01:39:37,930 --> 01:39:42,870
strange, yeah. Yeah. It's a,
it's a weird culture. Japan,

1678
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:46,080
they also have, um, they have
weird things that you could do.

1679
01:39:46,081 --> 01:39:49,140
Like you can buy women's
panties that women have worn.

1680
01:39:49,170 --> 01:39:52,940
You can buy them from vending
machines certain places. Yeah.

1681
01:39:53,740 --> 01:39:58,740
Buying them at all is strange on
vending machines is a deranged.

1682
01:39:59,130 --> 01:40:03,310
It is, but is it, I mean if, I don't know.

1683
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:06,570
I mean what is so horrible about
that? It seems like, you know,

1684
01:40:06,571 --> 01:40:10,860
if you wanted to buy like severed
feet, yeah, that'd be Kinda fucked up.

1685
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:13,490
But like if a girl wants to wear a pant,
I've,

1686
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:18,070
I have a girl was coming on soon Tuesday.
Uh, she's a professional, humiliate her.

1687
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:22,260
She is hired by these um,
like uh,

1688
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:26,880
CEOs and these people that have tremendous
power and they want to be dominated.

1689
01:40:26,881 --> 01:40:30,070
They want to be taken and she has all
these things that she does with them.

1690
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:34,800
Like she makes them give her their
bank account information so she can,

1691
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,330
she can, she can steal money from them.
Oh, well I'm not saying anything hard.

1692
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:42,330
Come on, I'll shield you
from any unpleasant thoughts.

1693
01:40:43,230 --> 01:40:48,230
But it's some people like
have these bizarre needs for
like things that you or I

1694
01:40:50,431 --> 01:40:53,290
would have no desire for it.
But at the end of the day,

1695
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,100
it's an agreement that these two have.
She's does it professionally.

1696
01:40:57,220 --> 01:41:01,930
There's no confusion here. It's like, this
is all, I don't see what's bad about it.

1697
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:05,470
Um, I'm trying to explore it. Have
you heard of that? Furries? Yes.

1698
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:07,120
I don't know about it much,

1699
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:12,040
but a nice furry told me on
the Internet that not to worry,

1700
01:41:12,041 --> 01:41:15,730
that most of them don't. And I don't
know that every time I bring it up,

1701
01:41:15,731 --> 01:41:18,940
people are, won't really tell me what
it is. And I don't fully want to know.

1702
01:41:18,940 --> 01:41:21,860
But from what I've learned, there
are many different kinds. Yes.

1703
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:26,020
So that will go deep with it. And some
people, it's just fun. It's just fun.

1704
01:41:26,770 --> 01:41:29,800
I was accidentally at a furry convention.

1705
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,360
There was a time where I was in
Pittsburgh and it coincided with a furry

1706
01:41:34,361 --> 01:41:36,830
convention.
And while we were driving down the street,

1707
01:41:36,831 --> 01:41:39,430
we were looking out the window. We're
going to, what the fuck is going on here?

1708
01:41:39,570 --> 01:41:41,920
So it's everyone wearing mascot costumes,

1709
01:41:41,921 --> 01:41:45,790
like they're all like big squirrels
and rabbits and stuff. And I'm like,

1710
01:41:45,791 --> 01:41:49,540
this is so strange. And then when
we got to the hotel, the hotel,

1711
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:52,090
one of the guys that worked there, he, uh,

1712
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,910
he opened up to me as we,
uh,

1713
01:41:54,970 --> 01:41:59,110
as we stayed there and he started telling
me the weirder aspects of furries like

1714
01:41:59,111 --> 01:42:03,070
that they had requested a litter box.
I'm, I'm not a shield. You nothing crazy.

1715
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:06,260
The sexual stuff I'll shield
you from. Okay. All right. Um,

1716
01:42:06,340 --> 01:42:08,770
they had requested a
litter box for the lobby.

1717
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:13,420
Like they literally wanted to go to the
bathroom in the lobby in a large litter

1718
01:42:13,421 --> 01:42:17,050
box. They were going to set it up and be
ready to hear about the sex part. Well,

1719
01:42:17,051 --> 01:42:18,880
they own, they not, not owned,

1720
01:42:18,881 --> 01:42:22,270
but rather they rented out the entire
hotel except for a couple of rooms.

1721
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:25,360
And I was one of those fucking
rooms they hadn't gotten

1722
01:42:27,190 --> 01:42:31,210
because I had made my
reservation in advance.

1723
01:42:31,270 --> 01:42:35,710
And so I had done it like a few months
out and the firies hadn't taken over the

1724
01:42:35,711 --> 01:42:39,400
hotel yet. That is so funny to imagine
you at a furry convention. Hilarious.

1725
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:42,910
They're friendly, they're all nice. You
know the high five me and stuff, you know,

1726
01:42:43,180 --> 01:42:44,410
and you don't know who your high five,

1727
01:42:45,890 --> 01:42:49,870
they could be making the meanest evil
face in the world behind that big smiley

1728
01:42:49,871 --> 01:42:54,130
chip Monck mask. But it was very
strange. They requested bowls.

1729
01:42:54,160 --> 01:42:56,410
They wanted to eat at a bowls
on the ground like a dog.

1730
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:59,170
See one of their food to
be served on the ground.

1731
01:42:59,930 --> 01:43:03,370
Human mind is so complicated.

1732
01:43:03,940 --> 01:43:05,760
Yes it is.
Oh No.

1733
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:10,870
Let's go back to your point of
a focus. Um, gender studies.

1734
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,143
Yeah.
Um,

1735
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:17,340
how did gender studies become like
primarily something that women focus on?

1736
01:43:18,810 --> 01:43:21,070
Like cause gender studies is
not really gender studies.

1737
01:43:21,071 --> 01:43:22,970
Like gender studies is like when you,

1738
01:43:22,971 --> 01:43:25,310
when you talk to someone they say
they're involved in gender studies.

1739
01:43:25,311 --> 01:43:29,320
It's either a guy who's some
fucking Weirdo feminists, dude.

1740
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:31,870
Or it's women, right? Well,

1741
01:43:32,860 --> 01:43:37,720
probably there's a healthy instinct
to avoid a major that entails your,

1742
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:42,490
you know, just shaming, you know,
feeling ashamed all the time.

1743
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,790
Is that what it is? Why does it have
to be that men don't major in the,

1744
01:43:45,860 --> 01:43:50,860
they don't major it anywhere near the
same numbers in these somewhat peripheral

1745
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:52,340
men are more practical.

1746
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:56,780
They come to college, they overwhelmingly
are the engineering majors,

1747
01:43:56,781 --> 01:43:59,810
the ECON majors.
If the practical majors,

1748
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:04,040
liberal arts majors mostly when it's
majority will philosophy's a little

1749
01:44:04,041 --> 01:44:08,960
different. Uh, but in the most of
the humanities it's more men. I mean,

1750
01:44:08,961 --> 01:44:13,220
I'm sorry, more women Ms.
French literature and I've
often thought it's partly,

1751
01:44:14,450 --> 01:44:15,920
sometimes people have said to me,
well,

1752
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:21,140
you're suggesting that women are more
interested in the humanities and men are

1753
01:44:21,141 --> 01:44:25,850
more interested in the sciences, but
in, in Mexico or India, you know,

1754
01:44:25,940 --> 01:44:27,610
they have just as many big,

1755
01:44:27,611 --> 01:44:30,890
give me some example of places
where women have the same majors.

1756
01:44:31,610 --> 01:44:36,610
They're typically societies that where
people are very at risk economically.

1757
01:44:38,150 --> 01:44:42,500
Societies that are not as prosperous.
But if you get to a prosperous, you know,

1758
01:44:42,501 --> 01:44:45,800
advanced democracy where you can,

1759
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:50,750
it can afford you the opportunity for
sort of high levels of self realization.

1760
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:54,650
You then people do what they,
what they most want to do.

1761
01:44:54,651 --> 01:44:59,030
And so women get to college, they
don't have to be an engineering major.

1762
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:04,031
They can major in art history or feminist
dance therapy if that exists or you

1763
01:45:04,351 --> 01:45:08,540
know, whatever they want and women, I
think that women feel a little freer.

1764
01:45:08,541 --> 01:45:12,530
I think there are a lot of men that would
prefer to do something other than what

1765
01:45:12,531 --> 01:45:14,060
they're doing,
but they're a little more practical.

1766
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:18,470
I think most men think they are
going to work a full time job.

1767
01:45:18,471 --> 01:45:22,040
They don't have options. I think a lot of
women suspected they might not have to,

1768
01:45:22,850 --> 01:45:25,580
so that's why they're getting involved
in gender stone is because they don't

1769
01:45:25,581 --> 01:45:29,520
think they're actually going to have to
make a living. I don't know what would,

1770
01:45:29,700 --> 01:45:32,800
what would a big generalization
to say to look at it at all?

1771
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:34,850
Because if it is one person,

1772
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:37,590
yeah, I'm sure there are many
different reasons actually.

1773
01:45:37,591 --> 01:45:41,760
Now you can make a little career
for yourself by working, you know,

1774
01:45:41,761 --> 01:45:45,120
there's a little network
of women's organization, I
mean quite a large network.

1775
01:45:45,121 --> 01:45:48,060
So they'll find a place there,
do conferences and stuff like that,

1776
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:52,110
but you can't expect to make much money.
And if you care about that,

1777
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:57,180
that maybe it will be fulfilled if you
care about carrying on this campaign,

1778
01:45:57,181 --> 01:46:02,181
this twisted propaganda written
campaign against patriarchy.

1779
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:06,750
Um, so, and by the way, I
should add that it's too bad.

1780
01:46:06,751 --> 01:46:11,160
Gender studies is that way because gender
is interesting and we should study it,

1781
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:16,580
but it should be done by objective
people who will camp and from different,

1782
01:46:17,160 --> 01:46:19,140
with different agendas.
We all have agendas,

1783
01:46:19,141 --> 01:46:22,350
but you want to have a field where you
can kind of cancel out one another's

1784
01:46:22,351 --> 01:46:25,470
agendas and get closer
to true understanding.

1785
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:30,400
Yeah, that was why I wanted to ask
you about it because it is, I mean,

1786
01:46:30,430 --> 01:46:34,150
the whole idea of men and women trying
to figure each other out has always been

1787
01:46:34,151 --> 01:46:36,910
problematic because we're doing it
under the guise of trying to mate.

1788
01:46:37,300 --> 01:46:38,230
We're trying to mate with each other.

1789
01:46:38,231 --> 01:46:41,140
So we're trying to figure each other
out while we're both bullshitting each

1790
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:41,951
other. Right. You know,

1791
01:46:41,951 --> 01:46:44,650
it's like bald people are wearing a mask
and trying to figure out what they look

1792
01:46:44,651 --> 01:46:47,200
like underneath that mask.
And that's,

1793
01:46:48,010 --> 01:46:51,570
that's how a lot people get to the
point where they're married and even,

1794
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:53,940
you know, they get divorced while
I'm never fallen for that shit again.

1795
01:46:54,100 --> 01:46:56,430
And then they fall into
another nice little trap.

1796
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:01,880
And I think that it would
be really fascinating to
have an honest class on what

1797
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:07,200
is the difference between men and women
and what are the biological reasons for

1798
01:47:07,201 --> 01:47:08,250
certain reactions.

1799
01:47:08,400 --> 01:47:13,010
Honest and helpful. Yes. To know what to
expect when you, when you get married,

1800
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,170
you know, your husband's probably
not going to be like your,

1801
01:47:15,290 --> 01:47:17,960
your college room mate. They,
you know, when you have children,

1802
01:47:18,350 --> 01:47:22,550
chances are for most women, it's
not all the majority. This is,

1803
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:24,950
uh, the, you know, the most,

1804
01:47:25,150 --> 01:47:28,550
you fall madly in love and you become
obsessed and it really hurts you to go

1805
01:47:28,551 --> 01:47:30,680
away for very long. Uh, you know,

1806
01:47:30,681 --> 01:47:33,530
40 hours a week and a lot of
men couldn't go away. I mean,

1807
01:47:33,531 --> 01:47:34,370
they can go away forever.

1808
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:39,140
Men Do abandoned children or they're
less fixated on them. Then women.

1809
01:47:39,141 --> 01:47:43,850
This is just a fact of our nature.
There are exceptions.

1810
01:47:43,851 --> 01:47:45,110
I'm just talking about overall.

1811
01:47:45,111 --> 01:47:48,440
You don't find women abandoning
children unless they're usually,

1812
01:47:48,441 --> 01:47:52,490
unless there's um, mental illness
or a drug, a drug, something.

1813
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,930
But men do it all the time. I
think fatherhood, you know, it,

1814
01:47:56,090 --> 01:47:59,980
it has to be supported and
encouraged and it's better.

1815
01:48:00,050 --> 01:48:03,710
We're better all round,
but it can't be taken for granted.

1816
01:48:03,711 --> 01:48:07,360
And the worst thing we can do is
to set people up, just to be it,

1817
01:48:07,390 --> 01:48:10,670
to be angry at each other because you're
going to be married to a man who's not

1818
01:48:10,671 --> 01:48:13,040
going to see the world exactly as you do.

1819
01:48:13,041 --> 01:48:17,380
Who's not going to care as much
about your, I dunno, your, your,

1820
01:48:17,381 --> 01:48:20,550
your window, uh, treatment.
Sure. Right, right.

1821
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:24,140
It's not going to care as much and
especially after who have babies.

1822
01:48:24,141 --> 01:48:27,680
A lot of you, you can, a lot of girls
were slobs, but when you have babies,

1823
01:48:28,200 --> 01:48:30,380
there's something that
changes and you really,

1824
01:48:30,980 --> 01:48:35,180
you want the house clean and you want you
feathering the nasty shit in your nest.

1825
01:48:35,181 --> 01:48:38,720
Your yeah. And men don't seem to
have quite the same experience.

1826
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:43,340
So people need to learn about
it and learn how to argue.

1827
01:48:43,341 --> 01:48:46,640
Don't like if people like there's so
much insulted, like a lot of women,

1828
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:51,680
I see this happening, they become their,
their husband's mother did come nags.

1829
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:55,110
Yeah. Which is just a recipe for
either misery or divorced. Right.

1830
01:48:55,760 --> 01:49:00,760
Because he doesn't want to be very to
nagging mother and women should know that

1831
01:49:01,340 --> 01:49:04,490
it's going to be frustrating because he
will not be as much help as you want.

1832
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:08,690
But you're frustrating to him because
he probably has to do a lot of things he

1833
01:49:08,691 --> 01:49:13,430
doesn't want to do. So it's
a big compromise and young
people should know this.

1834
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:16,650
Well, the, the biological
implications, the,

1835
01:49:16,680 --> 01:49:21,240
the biological reality of being an
animal is that most animals are raised by

1836
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:21,930
their mothers.

1837
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:26,010
I mean and we would all do much better
if the father was a loving father and was

1838
01:49:26,011 --> 01:49:28,560
around and it's a great
thing to concentrate on,

1839
01:49:28,561 --> 01:49:33,561
but human beings and a lot of ways mirror
the activities that we see in other

1840
01:49:33,571 --> 01:49:35,190
mammals and other mammals.

1841
01:49:35,490 --> 01:49:39,120
The women primarily were the females
primarily take care of the babies.

1842
01:49:39,630 --> 01:49:44,630
I think that if we looked at gender
studies from a biological standpoint and

1843
01:49:45,101 --> 01:49:47,980
then looked at them from a sociological
standpoint as well and tried to

1844
01:49:47,980 --> 01:49:52,180
figure out like what's the comfortable
middle ground and how can we better

1845
01:49:52,181 --> 01:49:56,200
understand each other from the biological
perspective and from the social

1846
01:49:56,201 --> 01:49:58,090
perspective.
It'd be really interesting.

1847
01:49:58,710 --> 01:50:02,860
It becomes a battleground for ideology
more than anything else. Doctrine,

1848
01:50:03,440 --> 01:50:05,140
nation as you say,
and,

1849
01:50:05,190 --> 01:50:09,580
and it's not w another thing we need to
know is what's easy to change and what

1850
01:50:09,581 --> 01:50:14,160
is it? For example, males are,
we've got very good evidence there.

1851
01:50:14,170 --> 01:50:19,170
Greater risk takers and rule breakers
and you see this even evidence from the

1852
01:50:19,991 --> 01:50:22,960
earliest ages,
little male toddlers have more accidents.

1853
01:50:22,961 --> 01:50:26,200
There had more in the emergency rooms,
more they're doing crazier things.

1854
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:27,790
It's more of a challenge.

1855
01:50:28,240 --> 01:50:30,940
So you need to know that and
then what do you do with it?

1856
01:50:31,180 --> 01:50:36,040
And I see the need to channel that.
You take that mail risk taking,

1857
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,680
which is very valuable for our species.

1858
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:44,040
That risk taking and that rubric and you
direct it to good ends and a father is

1859
01:50:44,201 --> 01:50:48,340
helpful or a male role model or a coach
athlete, you know, they're all things,

1860
01:50:48,430 --> 01:50:53,350
sorts of things we do to socialize male
energy and a society where the males are

1861
01:50:53,351 --> 01:50:57,370
socialized to most of them to
do good. You'll build, you know,

1862
01:50:57,371 --> 01:51:00,340
you build the, you know, the
United States of America.

1863
01:51:00,341 --> 01:51:03,340
I mean that's a healthy society.
But if you have a society,

1864
01:51:03,341 --> 01:51:06,130
like we have these dysfunctional
pathological societies,

1865
01:51:06,131 --> 01:51:10,930
you get destruction in May. And because
there is a pathological masculinity,

1866
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,880
most men aren't like that, but it exists.
Uh, so you need healthy masculinity.

1867
01:51:15,881 --> 01:51:19,930
You need to nurture that. So we need
to understand it, not resent it,

1868
01:51:19,931 --> 01:51:22,390
not pathologize it,
not criminalize it.

1869
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:26,970
And yet we're doing this toxic masculinity
is one of my favorite and unexpressed,

1870
01:51:27,140 --> 01:51:32,120
oh yeah, there's toxic femininity to know,

1871
01:51:33,370 --> 01:51:35,980
especially when men are using it.
When men use a term like,

1872
01:51:36,010 --> 01:51:39,230
oh Christ and talks got

1873
01:51:40,870 --> 01:51:43,080
silly. But no, no,

1874
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:46,600
it would have been interesting to
study gender objectively and it'd get,

1875
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:49,300
you know,
and it should be based in the sciences.

1876
01:51:49,301 --> 01:51:52,240
You should have input from is universal,

1877
01:51:52,241 --> 01:51:56,800
the genders taught in school and
gender studies or feminist based.

1878
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:00,820
I there could be exceptions. I
haven't seen them even in, you know,

1879
01:52:00,821 --> 01:52:04,510
even in Norway and Sweden and you go to
the departments in there full of people

1880
01:52:04,511 --> 01:52:08,020
that, you know with the
degrees in sociology and,

1881
01:52:08,021 --> 01:52:11,260
but who are very soft
and who are I strongly,

1882
01:52:11,261 --> 01:52:15,040
I lodge ideological well how do they get
away with saying things like gender is

1883
01:52:15,041 --> 01:52:17,830
a social construct because there's
so much evidence to the contrary.

1884
01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:20,940
The question is how do you get
away with questioning it and,

1885
01:52:20,980 --> 01:52:24,880
and have a career in the academy?
That's the question.

1886
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:29,740
I questioned it. And um, I,
I had a colleague when I was,

1887
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:32,830
I told you earlier about reading these
feminists textbooks and being horrified.

1888
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,240
I remember one of them,
first of all,

1889
01:52:34,450 --> 01:52:39,450
the author dedicated it to the women in
my women's studies of ELR in the spring

1890
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,500
of whatever year it was 91 and I
hadn't seen the word Avia Lara.

1891
01:52:44,501 --> 01:52:45,980
And I always like to look up

1892
01:52:45,980 --> 01:52:50,450
new words and I has it. I was about
to look it up until it hit me there.

1893
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:52,040
I would not find it.
She made it up.

1894
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:56,220
She didn't like the word seminar with
its root word associated with the very

1895
01:52:56,420 --> 01:53:01,070
essence. Yeah. Don't ask. Yes, yes. Don't
think it through because it's annoying.

1896
01:53:02,180 --> 01:53:05,810
But she wasn't, you know, thinking as
you called it [inaudible] seminar. Right.

1897
01:53:06,110 --> 01:53:08,360
Oh good Lord.
Now the thing is,

1898
01:53:08,390 --> 01:53:12,510
how about group would just
forget it. Neutral. Why is that?

1899
01:53:13,640 --> 01:53:16,970
There was another woman who said that
she had a theory that we were all born

1900
01:53:16,980 --> 01:53:20,630
bisexual. And then through
socialization our, you know,

1901
01:53:20,631 --> 01:53:25,631
our parents and society turn half of us
into female human beings and half into

1902
01:53:26,210 --> 01:53:27,200
male human beings.

1903
01:53:27,201 --> 01:53:32,140
And then she said one destined to
command and the other to obey. You know,

1904
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:34,870
I remember reading that to my
husband or fun day and he said like,

1905
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,940
which one commands in which
one obeys and yeah, but no,

1906
01:53:38,990 --> 01:53:42,950
but I'm just saying they have these,
these views that are,

1907
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:48,250
that would not survive in any kind of
functional academic environment where

1908
01:53:48,921 --> 01:53:52,640
people could freely access. It's
not that they can't voice them, uh,

1909
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:57,920
because sometimes people that are
have Kooky view sometimes, you know,

1910
01:53:58,340 --> 01:54:00,980
people test it and they can't
find fault and it, you know,

1911
01:54:00,981 --> 01:54:03,280
it ends up they ended up being
right. Right. So you, you,

1912
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:06,440
you have to be polyamorous relationships,
things along those lines.

1913
01:54:06,441 --> 01:54:10,010
It actually do work for some, for some
people you have to be open to that.

1914
01:54:10,011 --> 01:54:12,970
You have to resist,
um,

1915
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,560
close mindedness and then
the ideal university,

1916
01:54:15,561 --> 01:54:18,980
that's where you have some people bring
in people that challenge and you're

1917
01:54:18,981 --> 01:54:23,981
constantly either reinforcing what we
already know or challenging it or bringing

1918
01:54:24,081 --> 01:54:26,300
in new ideas. It's,
it's an exciting thing.

1919
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:30,590
What we've done to our
universities is so sad now.

1920
01:54:30,591 --> 01:54:34,590
It's still that what I just described
that's going on in computer technology is

1921
01:54:34,591 --> 01:54:35,750
going on in the sciences.

1922
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:40,310
It's been shut down in the humanities
and to some degree in the social sciences

1923
01:54:40,311 --> 01:54:41,180
and in education.

1924
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:43,420
Is it possible that as we,

1925
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:46,310
you said the millennials today
are the most open minded,

1926
01:54:46,360 --> 01:54:49,920
least likely to be racist or
prejudice, that the, the, the,

1927
01:54:49,921 --> 01:54:51,440
there's a good trend going on.

1928
01:54:51,470 --> 01:54:55,490
Is it possible that this same trend could
eventually extend to the universities

1929
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:00,230
where these kids will realize how
preposterous some of this behavior is and

1930
01:55:00,231 --> 01:55:02,900
they'll reject some of this teaching and
they'll, they'll understand that like,

1931
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:05,780
yes, there is a certain amount
of prejudice as some people have,

1932
01:55:05,781 --> 01:55:09,200
but let's get to the root of it and find
out why they have these misconceptions.

1933
01:55:09,201 --> 01:55:14,180
Why do they have these ideas in their
head that are ultimately biased and wrong

1934
01:55:14,181 --> 01:55:16,490
or or degrading or whatever it is.

1935
01:55:16,700 --> 01:55:20,300
But is it possible that through
conversations like this,

1936
01:55:20,450 --> 01:55:22,760
through things like your youtube videos,

1937
01:55:22,761 --> 01:55:26,240
through more people discussing these
ideas and an open form and more people

1938
01:55:26,241 --> 01:55:30,820
mocking things like what happened at
Yale or what happened at [inaudible] name

1939
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:31,371
the college,

1940
01:55:31,371 --> 01:55:34,850
there's probably something going on
right now where someone's screaming at

1941
01:55:34,851 --> 01:55:39,290
someone because they want to go to a
lecture that's being taught by a man who

1942
01:55:39,291 --> 01:55:42,710
said something offensive about women's
roles and where the wrong shirt or

1943
01:55:42,711 --> 01:55:44,350
something like that.
Scientist

1944
01:55:44,390 --> 01:55:47,820
the war. The, yeah, yeah. Yes. Uh,

1945
01:55:47,910 --> 01:55:52,760
the problem is that these, uh,
these bad ideas have tenure. The,

1946
01:55:52,761 --> 01:55:56,210
the, these tents, they have
tenure. They are there. I mean,

1947
01:55:56,610 --> 01:55:59,340
so it's,
it's going to be hard.

1948
01:56:00,150 --> 01:56:04,170
I think what's going to happen is the
universities are maybe going to become

1949
01:56:04,171 --> 01:56:04,890
obsolete.

1950
01:56:04,890 --> 01:56:09,450
I think a lot of education is going to
move to web based education and cyber

1951
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:14,520
courses. I know, I think it's sad
if we lose our tea, our colleges,

1952
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:19,200
but the colleges I'm telling you they
will vaporize. Yale is at risk right now.

1953
01:56:19,230 --> 01:56:22,970
Amherst College, some of our best
universities, they are in there.

1954
01:56:23,060 --> 01:56:27,660
It has to soak deray so crazy.
What's going on there. And they've,

1955
01:56:27,690 --> 01:56:28,350
they have,

1956
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:32,760
it's as if they've weaponized
the sensitivities of the
most neurotic students on

1957
01:56:32,761 --> 01:56:35,280
campus. And these kids are now, you know,

1958
01:56:35,281 --> 01:56:38,670
riding rough shot over
everyone else that can't go on.

1959
01:56:39,060 --> 01:56:43,770
So they will become so dysfunctional.
They need to film it.

1960
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:48,870
Like when they fill me films, films,
when they filmed that one kid,

1961
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,990
who by the way was an Asian American,

1962
01:56:52,460 --> 01:56:56,310
it was trying to take photographs of
the African American guy who was on the

1963
01:56:56,311 --> 01:57:00,000
hunger strike and they were accusing
him of being a part of the patriarchy.

1964
01:57:00,001 --> 01:57:02,600
And he was a fucking student. He
was a student. And then that woman,

1965
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:07,830
she was a professor of communications.
She had, we need some muscle over here.

1966
01:57:07,831 --> 01:57:08,730
Oh,
that was nice.

1967
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:13,760
She had requested the media come
and cover this just the day before,

1968
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:16,590
the day before she had questioned the,

1969
01:57:16,950 --> 01:57:21,030
she tweets talking about
this hunger strike. You know,

1970
01:57:21,031 --> 01:57:24,990
this is a really important cause. Can the
media come and cover this? So the media,

1971
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:28,770
cottonwood, we in the form
of student media Comms, this
kid, and this lady's like,

1972
01:57:28,771 --> 01:57:29,940
you have to leave,
you have to leave.

1973
01:57:30,090 --> 01:57:34,440
They had decided that a public place
was now private because this guy had

1974
01:57:34,441 --> 01:57:37,560
created a safe space and they were going
to do a hunger strike. They're like,

1975
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:40,890
what in the fuck?
What are they protesting video.

1976
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:43,980
But the video got out and the video
got out, the whole world responded.

1977
01:57:43,981 --> 01:57:48,150
She had to resign the whole world realize
how preposterous this behavior is and

1978
01:57:48,240 --> 01:57:49,890
but when we get a chance to see it,

1979
01:57:49,891 --> 01:57:53,160
we meaning people on the outside get a
chance to see that video and comment on

1980
01:57:53,161 --> 01:57:56,160
it in, in, you know,
from our own perspective,

1981
01:57:56,161 --> 01:57:59,610
not from the perspective of someone in
grossed in that sort of ideological trap.

1982
01:57:59,970 --> 01:58:03,870
Then you get to realize like that these
kids get to see how crazy we all think

1983
01:58:03,871 --> 01:58:07,930
it is. I think that there's a benefit,
there's a benefit in that and,

1984
01:58:07,950 --> 01:58:10,030
but there's also a benefit in,
in uh,

1985
01:58:10,180 --> 01:58:14,760
kids on campus to join us who
are sensible and who believe,

1986
01:58:14,790 --> 01:58:18,600
who do not want to be the generation
where it freedom came to die because

1987
01:58:18,601 --> 01:58:21,570
believe me, millennials out there,
you are that generation now.

1988
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:24,030
Every generation has had
big challenges to liberty.

1989
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:26,220
Everybody finds new ways
to challenge liberty.

1990
01:58:26,730 --> 01:58:29,850
You're tested and you have to meet the
test. And we had, we've been through,

1991
01:58:29,851 --> 01:58:33,930
you know, the McCarthy era and you know,
all sorts of things. They were in the,

1992
01:58:33,931 --> 01:58:36,900
in the Vietnam era and
it had to be worked out.

1993
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:41,930
This is your challenge and I say
start the resistance and there's

1994
01:58:42,040 --> 01:58:46,450
a wonderful group called the foundation
for individual rights in education fire.

1995
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:49,280
When I like about it,
it's bipartisan. It's,

1996
01:58:49,390 --> 01:58:53,740
it's liberals and conservatives who
love freedom because I think that's what

1997
01:58:53,741 --> 01:58:57,640
unites most Americans is that we
can have our political differences,

1998
01:58:57,820 --> 01:59:02,820
but we have this common commitment to
freedom and to try to increase it and

1999
01:59:03,911 --> 01:59:04,744
preserve it.

2000
01:59:05,020 --> 01:59:09,220
Now this group fire has replaced
the HCLU for civil liberties.

2001
01:59:09,221 --> 01:59:12,760
The ACO use asleep at the wheel. We
never hear from them about these campus,

2002
01:59:13,240 --> 01:59:14,650
you know this zealotry

2003
01:59:14,970 --> 01:59:17,230
you don't know how to
approach it because the,

2004
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:21,240
the very people that are involved in that
zealotry will also support the ACL you

2005
01:59:21,241 --> 01:59:24,930
every step of the way because I think
it's pretty universally acknowledged.

2006
01:59:24,931 --> 01:59:27,180
The ACL does great work.
They, they're very variable.

2007
01:59:27,240 --> 01:59:30,390
I, I, my mother was a member and I
don't know if I met ever been a member,

2008
01:59:30,391 --> 01:59:34,990
but I love Nading Strawson she used to be
the president and we, you know, that I,

2009
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:39,260
it was, it's great, but it, it
has been silent. Relatively cider.

2010
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:43,380
Scared the ACL. You can't be scared. You
must be scared. They can't be scared.

2011
01:59:44,270 --> 01:59:48,670
While I think they are intimidated. Yeah.
Here's what I seem scared, isn't it?

2012
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:53,040
Well, it's a little more complicated
because I think they also, maybe,

2013
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:55,080
I don't know,
I'm not a psychologist,

2014
01:59:55,260 --> 01:59:59,340
but I will tell you that there are groups
like Libertarians, I noticed atheists,

2015
02:00:00,390 --> 02:00:01,223
you know,

2016
02:00:01,720 --> 02:00:06,720
the ACLU lawyers where they have a small
cohort of very angry women and these

2017
02:00:07,441 --> 02:00:10,530
are thoughtful that the majority of
people are thoughtful. Well meaning,

2018
02:00:10,531 --> 02:00:13,140
and they listened to these angry where
they think maybe we should be respectful.

2019
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:16,930
Maybe they're, maybe they really are.
And they don't realize that they,

2020
02:00:17,010 --> 02:00:21,390
that it's a small group of bitter people
who believe twisted theories and false

2021
02:00:21,391 --> 02:00:24,920
statistics and they're imposing
that on the whole. But these, this,

2022
02:00:25,020 --> 02:00:27,570
these groups of women have been
very divisive for Libertarians.

2023
02:00:27,950 --> 02:00:30,990
They did it to the atheists. I think
they did it through the ACL. Ooh,

2024
02:00:31,080 --> 02:00:35,880
the mighty ACL you fell before a small
group of zealots and they're more likely

2025
02:00:35,881 --> 02:00:40,881
to be suing a school for having a boys
class to help boys read than they are to

2026
02:00:41,611 --> 02:00:46,440
be going on the campus in calling out
hordes of a, you know, vigilante group.

2027
02:00:47,150 --> 02:00:51,410
There was one professor that I follow
who is a, a, it's kind of a radical,

2028
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:56,120
almost communist, very
socialistic. But, uh,

2029
02:00:56,210 --> 02:00:59,510
he was saying that the only mistake
that the woman made was that she did it

2030
02:00:59,511 --> 02:01:03,440
before she got tenure. And I
was like, that is hilarious.

2031
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:08,170
You know what, he or she will get
tenure this, this will not hurt her.

2032
02:01:08,171 --> 02:01:11,850
This will help her. She's a celebrity.
Yeah. She'll get a better, I have seen,

2033
02:01:11,890 --> 02:01:15,640
I mean, I don't know, but I didn't,
she resigned. Oh No, she was,

2034
02:01:15,970 --> 02:01:20,260
you're talking about the one
at well muscle? No. Yeah, I
think that she was asked.

2035
02:01:20,410 --> 02:01:22,810
She had, she has an appointment
in the communications,

2036
02:01:22,811 --> 02:01:26,980
but I think she was teaching by invitation
for the School of Journalism. Right.

2037
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:31,120
And University of Missouri has a storied
wonderful, you know, journalism school.

2038
02:01:31,121 --> 02:01:34,840
And I think they were horrified to
have on a public university to have a,

2039
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:37,600
a professor. Yeah. Going out the police.

2040
02:01:37,900 --> 02:01:40,010
So she was disinvited from being

2041
02:01:40,010 --> 02:01:44,570
part of that program. But no, no.
She'll be, she'll be at a, at, at, at,

2042
02:01:44,740 --> 02:01:49,670
at Wesleyan. That's very cynical. It's
not cynical. It's the factual feminist.

2043
02:01:53,730 --> 02:01:56,770
That's horrifying though, that someone
would, that kind of thinking that,

2044
02:01:56,771 --> 02:02:00,560
telling some person that, oh, do
you remember the Duke Lacrosse case?

2045
02:02:01,220 --> 02:02:02,540
How about the University of Virginia Case?

2046
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:05,410
That was in rolling stone and all that.
But even before that, Duke Lacrosse,

2047
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:08,270
these young men falsely
accused a flagrant lie.

2048
02:02:08,480 --> 02:02:12,920
We'll 88 professors long before
anything was known about it.

2049
02:02:12,921 --> 02:02:16,720
They came out with an advertisement
on who was in the school paper,

2050
02:02:16,740 --> 02:02:21,740
a local paper as siding with the accuser
against the boys and some of them in

2051
02:02:22,370 --> 02:02:25,750
the, we're very viciously
outspoken and, and,

2052
02:02:25,980 --> 02:02:29,470
and they basically were part of a,
a vigilante group that, you know,

2053
02:02:29,620 --> 02:02:34,620
it conducted the equivalent
of a witch hunt and they,

2054
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:38,900
there were no consequences. They've gone
on to better jobs, some of them. Wow.

2055
02:02:38,901 --> 02:02:41,990
Really? Yeah, that's absolutely horrific.

2056
02:02:42,350 --> 02:02:46,010
That was one of the things that
made me hate Nancy grace. Oh,

2057
02:02:46,040 --> 02:02:48,990
Nancy grace was terrible
because I don't know her,

2058
02:02:49,460 --> 02:02:51,220
I hate what she represents on television.

2059
02:02:51,221 --> 02:02:55,280
Maybe she's like one of those
people that's just reality
TV acting out and she's

2060
02:02:55,281 --> 02:02:59,720
Nice Lacrosse boys. Yeah,
she was horrible on that.

2061
02:02:59,780 --> 02:03:03,920
And it turns out that she was absolutely
wrong and never apologized. And those,

2062
02:03:03,921 --> 02:03:04,780
those kids didn't,

2063
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:08,030
well I don't know what they did really
come just that day and that night they

2064
02:03:08,031 --> 02:03:12,650
did nothing. It apparently,
I mean one of them wasn't,

2065
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:13,493
it wasn't even there.

2066
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:17,960
He had proof that he was not
there and it wasn't enough.

2067
02:03:18,620 --> 02:03:19,970
Well,
it's again,

2068
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:24,110
it's the lynch mob mentality and trying
to keep them away from you, you know,

2069
02:03:24,111 --> 02:03:25,760
and trying to turn them away from you.

2070
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:29,870
So you have to say something
that's going to exonerate you from,

2071
02:03:29,930 --> 02:03:34,260
from being guilty by
association or guilty. By the
way you know, you, you, you,

2072
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:38,210
you view the case, you know the you
are, you're not a part of the problem.

2073
02:03:38,211 --> 02:03:39,890
You're a part of the potential solution.

2074
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:44,920
And I think liberal students
and conservative students
could unite on campus.

2075
02:03:46,010 --> 02:03:48,410
It just in favor of free expression.

2076
02:03:48,620 --> 02:03:51,680
Are they the most maligned
students on campus?

2077
02:03:51,710 --> 02:03:54,210
Conservatives concern.

2078
02:03:54,270 --> 02:03:57,740
Here's the good thing for conservative
students and libertarian students,

2079
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:02,150
when you get to campus, uh, you're going
to have your ideas challenged morning,

2080
02:04:02,151 --> 02:04:05,690
noon, and night. And that's probably good.

2081
02:04:05,810 --> 02:04:10,040
You're going to become very conversant
in the ideas of the other side,

2082
02:04:10,041 --> 02:04:12,890
which might, one of my favorite
philosophers, John Stuart Mill, said,

2083
02:04:12,891 --> 02:04:16,340
you can't understand your own position
unless you understand your critics.

2084
02:04:16,490 --> 02:04:19,700
You have to understand your critics almost
as well as you understand yourself to

2085
02:04:19,701 --> 02:04:21,560
truly be able to defend a position.

2086
02:04:21,740 --> 02:04:25,100
So conservatives have that advantage
in and their professors, the majority,

2087
02:04:25,250 --> 02:04:27,200
we have very good data,
vast majority liberal.

2088
02:04:27,201 --> 02:04:30,230
So they will hear that and then
they're going to make good friends.

2089
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:32,870
If they hang out with each other,
they'll make buddies that, you know,

2090
02:04:32,871 --> 02:04:36,230
it's like comrades in war,
there'll be friends for life. Uh,

2091
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:38,220
then there are a liberal

2092
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:40,980
students that go there and there you
have to be careful because they're just

2093
02:04:40,981 --> 02:04:43,330
going to be in an echo chamber,
you know,

2094
02:04:43,331 --> 02:04:46,980
and they'll hear it and
it'll be reinforced and they
better be careful and try

2095
02:04:46,981 --> 02:04:50,220
to make a point of attending a lecture.
If someone comes,

2096
02:04:50,221 --> 02:04:54,480
it's offering a different point of view
because they won't hear it. And uh,

2097
02:04:54,540 --> 02:04:59,520
that they, that the conservative kids up
til now, up till a couple of years ago,

2098
02:04:59,880 --> 02:05:02,820
they were fine. I mean, people
would occasionally be mean,

2099
02:05:03,150 --> 02:05:07,740
but now I'm a little worried because
they, this, this outburst of fanaticism,

2100
02:05:07,741 --> 02:05:12,240
this outbreak of cri bullies who could be,

2101
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:14,280
they could be very punishing.

2102
02:05:14,410 --> 02:05:18,900
And can you even have a young
Republican's Conference on, on a,

2103
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:22,740
a major campus? Well, it's an
interesting question. There are,

2104
02:05:22,741 --> 02:05:27,020
they do have college republicans.
I was invited to, um,

2105
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:29,090
even though I'm still a
registered Democrat, the,

2106
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:32,760
the College Republicans and Libertarians
and Oberlin invited me and it was the

2107
02:05:32,761 --> 02:05:37,500
college Republicans said Clare Booth
Luce set after you had already been like

2108
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:40,260
triggered the dog triggered and you,

2109
02:05:40,261 --> 02:05:42,330
the people came with a tape over
their fear that was the same.

2110
02:05:42,330 --> 02:05:45,030
They were the ones that invited me to
all these kids found out and the same at

2111
02:05:45,031 --> 02:05:45,864
Georgetown.

2112
02:05:45,900 --> 02:05:50,790
So that you were invited to speak
to Republicans and Libertarians.

2113
02:05:50,850 --> 02:05:53,060
Well that's probably a big
part of what went wrong. Right.

2114
02:05:53,250 --> 02:05:55,890
They just assumed you're were part of
the problem because of who invited you.

2115
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:59,220
They didn't even care about that.
There was my name and they, what they,

2116
02:05:59,260 --> 02:06:00,460
they'd seen a,
you know,

2117
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:03,780
a snippet of as something from the
factual feminist and said that I was

2118
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:10,230
a bad person. They didn't want to hear
it. They did not want me on campus.

2119
02:06:10,590 --> 02:06:11,700
And, you know, I try to, I try,

2120
02:06:11,701 --> 02:06:13,960
I always try to put myself in
the other person's position.

2121
02:06:13,961 --> 02:06:18,900
And I think what would upset me like
that, who would, I know a lot of people,

2122
02:06:18,901 --> 02:06:23,820
I would be very upset if, you know, if a
Nazi were coming or even someone who I,

2123
02:06:23,821 --> 02:06:25,980
I, you know, I just
thought was reckless and,

2124
02:06:26,490 --> 02:06:30,600
and defamed people who, first of all,
I don't, I'm not like that at all.

2125
02:06:30,600 --> 02:06:34,320
I haven't done anything like that.
Uh, but I can imagine being upset.

2126
02:06:34,321 --> 02:06:38,640
But even then, what would I do if
someone invited a horrible person?

2127
02:06:38,670 --> 02:06:43,380
I would not, I would, I would
write an op ed or having, uh,

2128
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:47,400
you know, uh, you on
the campus, you have to,

2129
02:06:47,401 --> 02:06:50,130
that's the place where you should
learn to fight these things.

2130
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:54,750
You fight bad ideas with good ideas,
not by spitting on them,

2131
02:06:54,751 --> 02:06:57,990
which happened at Yale and
not by intimidating them,

2132
02:06:57,991 --> 02:07:02,991
which I happen to Yale and Missouri and
not by this kind of mob hysteria who got

2133
02:07:03,841 --> 02:07:07,800
spit on it. Yeah, I think
it was, um, it, this is, so,

2134
02:07:07,801 --> 02:07:09,820
this is typical of what happens.
Uh,

2135
02:07:10,190 --> 02:07:14,700
Greg Lukin off from this group fire that
I urge people to check out because they

2136
02:07:14,701 --> 02:07:16,830
were really taking their,
they're leading the way,

2137
02:07:16,831 --> 02:07:21,831
fighting this nonsense on campus while
he was speaking at Yale and as a,

2138
02:07:22,030 --> 02:07:24,580
and he, he's actually the one
that filmed, wait a minute,

2139
02:07:24,581 --> 02:07:28,890
am I confusing my schools? He filmed a
student, oh yeah, yeah. It was at Yale.

2140
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:34,020
He was speaking and he had an iPhone
and he was with the professor whose wife

2141
02:07:34,021 --> 02:07:36,010
had challenged Halloween costumes and

2142
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:39,640
he actually was put on his iPhone, not
because he wanted to make a viral video,

2143
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:44,290
but because he'd seen things like this
happen and then students misrepresent

2144
02:07:44,291 --> 02:07:47,380
what happened. He was afraid
they'd say the dean got, you know,

2145
02:07:47,381 --> 02:07:52,180
it was screaming at obscenity. So
he filmed it for that reason. Well,

2146
02:07:52,181 --> 02:07:57,181
before that he was giving a talk about
free speech on campus and he was talking

2147
02:07:57,851 --> 02:08:01,720
about some of the craziness going on.
And you just said in passing,

2148
02:08:02,170 --> 02:08:06,100
they're treating, you know, the Dean's
wife, I'm not sure this was an example,

2149
02:08:06,101 --> 02:08:07,180
but it was something like this.

2150
02:08:07,181 --> 02:08:10,450
They're treating the dean's wife as if
she's some kind of war criminal is if she

2151
02:08:10,451 --> 02:08:14,500
burned down of Indian village,
that like she's a genocidal maniac.

2152
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:17,650
Some protesters said Indian village,

2153
02:08:18,280 --> 02:08:22,920
you're making a joke about genocide.
And then they,

2154
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:24,880
he went crazy and had to
be removed from the room.

2155
02:08:24,910 --> 02:08:29,140
Then word got out that somebody had
joked about genocide and it was complete

2156
02:08:29,141 --> 02:08:32,710
nonsense. A complete mangling of
what Greg Lukey and off had said,

2157
02:08:33,160 --> 02:08:37,360
this is what's happening. They take
a little comment to out of campus.

2158
02:08:37,540 --> 02:08:41,560
Then the hysteria spreads cause they're
just ready to be, to be triggered.

2159
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:42,670
Well I think it's again,

2160
02:08:42,671 --> 02:08:44,680
when we said there's just people
looking for the green light,

2161
02:08:45,070 --> 02:08:48,580
they're just looking for the, there's
a green light. I see Indian go

2162
02:08:51,220 --> 02:08:56,220
rational response to someone saying
something that's a callous or rude or

2163
02:08:58,030 --> 02:09:00,670
prejudice. It's a green light. It's this,

2164
02:09:00,671 --> 02:09:04,870
these are certain subjects where you're
allowed to be offended and now what's

2165
02:09:05,410 --> 02:09:09,760
anything will offend these groups.
So it's more and more, you know,

2166
02:09:09,820 --> 02:09:12,520
there was a time where our campuses,

2167
02:09:12,521 --> 02:09:16,480
we're so segregated and they were
being integrated and these, you know,

2168
02:09:16,481 --> 02:09:20,890
you see videos of, you know, will you
see footage of what it was, you know,

2169
02:09:20,891 --> 02:09:21,581
in photographs,

2170
02:09:21,581 --> 02:09:25,030
famous photographs of when they first
integrated the University of Mississippi,

2171
02:09:25,031 --> 02:09:30,031
and I guess it was James Meredith going
on campus and just horrible behavior and

2172
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,620
that that is so offensive.

2173
02:09:32,620 --> 02:09:37,620
That is racism now that
there has to be these tiny,

2174
02:09:38,570 --> 02:09:43,240
somebody drives by in a truck and maybe
shouted something that mobilizes the

2175
02:09:43,290 --> 02:09:46,570
campus.
It's interesting to decades later,

2176
02:09:46,630 --> 02:09:50,410
things have changed so much that they
have to search to find things to really,

2177
02:09:50,411 --> 02:09:54,580
truly be able to be offended.
I think that's, these are
your grievance collectors.

2178
02:09:54,660 --> 02:09:57,880
They just want to be, they're
chronically offended people. I mean,

2179
02:09:57,881 --> 02:10:02,110
what is that that would motivate someone
to want to have to be in that mode?

2180
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:06,190
I don't know. I, I, as I said, I'm
not a psychologist. I'm a philosopher.

2181
02:10:06,430 --> 02:10:08,800
I recognize bad ideas and nonsense,

2182
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:13,450
but I don't understand that attraction.
Assume that they need real problems.

2183
02:10:13,790 --> 02:10:17,320
I assume that they need real,
some real adversity in their life.

2184
02:10:17,321 --> 02:10:19,570
They need something real to do battle.

2185
02:10:19,571 --> 02:10:23,130
And some have said it may be the result
of the helicopter parenting and self

2186
02:10:23,131 --> 02:10:25,260
esteem education.
So they,

2187
02:10:25,261 --> 02:10:29,080
they hot overprotective kids were,
you know,

2188
02:10:29,500 --> 02:10:34,280
every little setback, you know, there
were parents and teachers and everyone,

2189
02:10:34,281 --> 02:10:37,520
you know, oh poor thing. So they never
developed that healthy resilience.

2190
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:38,600
They go to campus,

2191
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:44,510
they hear the Dean's wife writes an
email about Halloween costumes they don't

2192
02:10:44,511 --> 02:10:48,050
like and they flip out or does anybody
really believed that that girl who

2193
02:10:48,051 --> 02:10:51,620
screamed at the Dean when yelled at
this is my home. You're, you know,

2194
02:10:51,621 --> 02:10:54,290
like all that crazy shit that
she was yelling out crazy.

2195
02:10:54,291 --> 02:10:56,730
She would she have done that
if they were alone with it?

2196
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:57,800
Does anybody believe that?

2197
02:10:57,801 --> 02:11:01,190
Does anybody believe that if they had
met in an office somewhere and had a

2198
02:11:01,191 --> 02:11:03,110
rational discussion,
she was acting,

2199
02:11:03,290 --> 02:11:06,740
she putting on a theatrical performance
for all the people that were involved

2200
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:10,790
kind of worked up by the
energy of the crowd crowd.

2201
02:11:10,820 --> 02:11:12,980
And you have to be careful of that.
I just warn people,

2202
02:11:12,981 --> 02:11:15,120
be careful of that emotion of,

2203
02:11:15,280 --> 02:11:19,590
of rage doesn't lead to good places and,
and,

2204
02:11:19,900 --> 02:11:21,020
and you know,

2205
02:11:21,021 --> 02:11:25,070
feeling really self righteous and
grandstanding and grandstanding.

2206
02:11:25,190 --> 02:11:29,090
There was a lot of the bad history, all
of that behavior. You have misinformation,

2207
02:11:29,091 --> 02:11:31,780
twisted theories, moral fervor, histories,

2208
02:11:31,790 --> 02:11:36,680
one long lesson and the dangers of
combining these things and what we talked

2209
02:11:36,681 --> 02:11:37,161
about before,

2210
02:11:37,161 --> 02:11:41,360
that life essentially has become some
sort of a bizarre open-ended reality show

2211
02:11:41,630 --> 02:11:45,500
and that these people are jockeying for
a great position on the social ladder.

2212
02:11:45,740 --> 02:11:49,370
And by being the person who yells
at that guy on social media,

2213
02:11:49,371 --> 02:11:51,410
that girl got a lot of pounds
the next day at school.

2214
02:11:51,411 --> 02:11:54,650
Girls give her knuckles and hug her.
That was amazing.

2215
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,310
Did you see you got a hundred likes and
I'm just glad there was no social media

2216
02:11:58,311 --> 02:12:01,670
when I was in college
because I was a crazy,

2217
02:12:02,090 --> 02:12:05,060
crazy and we're not that
crazy but a little crazy.

2218
02:12:05,061 --> 02:12:10,061
And I was on the periphery of a mob
at Nyu that occupied a computer.

2219
02:12:11,090 --> 02:12:14,090
It was a big deal. It was a big, there was
a computer. You're occupied a computer.

2220
02:12:14,091 --> 02:12:17,630
Yeah, it was real. It was a big thing.
Now they're are current. The whole street.

2221
02:12:18,780 --> 02:12:22,340
This was the courant institute and we
were going to destroy the computer. What?

2222
02:12:22,370 --> 02:12:26,870
I hadn't thought it through.
Why are we going to destroy the computer?

2223
02:12:27,010 --> 02:12:30,380
Because we thought they were
doing research for the war.
This is a long time ago.

2224
02:12:30,381 --> 02:12:33,650
Okay. This was 69, I believe. Maybe 70.

2225
02:12:34,040 --> 02:12:35,780
And I was on the periphery of a crowd.

2226
02:12:36,050 --> 02:12:40,640
And I do think there was a moment where
a dean came and I may have had words

2227
02:12:40,641 --> 02:12:44,090
with him and I am telling him like,
that girl yelled at like that,

2228
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:48,870
but he just said something,
young lady at however the differences,

2229
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:53,320
once I knew he was a dean and I
ran away, I didn't want to, uh,

2230
02:12:53,490 --> 02:12:55,460
I don't know.
I'm just glad there isn't a videotape.

2231
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:59,100
So how were they using the computer
for the war? I think that was the,

2232
02:12:59,170 --> 02:13:02,720
it was a mathematical institute
called the courant institute.

2233
02:13:02,780 --> 02:13:06,920
And they had a computer, which
was a big deal. That was huge.

2234
02:13:07,100 --> 02:13:11,310
And I think they thought they could go in
and destroy it. And, but I'll tell you,

2235
02:13:11,311 --> 02:13:15,050
it was probably one of my first moments
of awareness about the dangers of the

2236
02:13:15,051 --> 02:13:17,510
left. Even though I was an
enthusiastic participant,

2237
02:13:17,750 --> 02:13:22,610
we did break into the building and we
were in someone's office and I was kind of

2238
02:13:22,611 --> 02:13:24,810
thrilled. Ah, I met the, the, the,

2239
02:13:24,820 --> 02:13:28,520
the military industrial complex
and this is the brain center. And,

2240
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:33,550
and I was in an office and somebody
punching out somebody slides.

2241
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:36,990
They were, you remember a slide
you've on? They were punching him out.

2242
02:13:36,991 --> 02:13:39,270
And I thought, Oh, what is that?

2243
02:13:39,271 --> 02:13:44,271
And I looked and it was like a professor's
photographs of his kids and they were

2244
02:13:45,180 --> 02:13:47,310
destroyed. They were destroying them.
And then I looked around and thought,

2245
02:13:47,311 --> 02:13:51,600
this is just some person. And I kind of
slowly retreated. I felt very ashamed.

2246
02:13:51,601 --> 02:13:54,510
I didn't know what I, there were
thousands of us there. All right.

2247
02:13:54,510 --> 02:13:57,200
I'm not confessing to
a crime. Right. But I,

2248
02:13:57,310 --> 02:14:01,830
I was part of a crazy mob
and I never forgot that. And,

2249
02:14:02,130 --> 02:14:04,900
and then I started,
you know,

2250
02:14:05,250 --> 02:14:07,380
I mean I still remained a or for a while,

2251
02:14:07,381 --> 02:14:11,310
but never was I ever on the
part of anything like that.

2252
02:14:11,780 --> 02:14:16,020
I think then you uniquely understand
the whole hysteria behind it.

2253
02:14:16,560 --> 02:14:19,590
You can get caught or caught up in
it and I understand something else.

2254
02:14:20,250 --> 02:14:25,250
Some of the craziest ones are going to
defect to to my side eventually because

2255
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:29,190
in uh, among the Marxists, for example,

2256
02:14:29,191 --> 02:14:32,970
some of the best anti Marxists
antibody were, were former Marxist.

2257
02:14:33,420 --> 02:14:38,100
Some of the people that had the most
penetrating analysis of what's wrong with

2258
02:14:38,101 --> 02:14:41,580
totalitarian systems,
they were once people who are part of it.

2259
02:14:42,060 --> 02:14:46,290
I think there are a lot of
smart kids who had an education.

2260
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,420
They would robbed of a serious education.

2261
02:14:48,690 --> 02:14:52,230
They're going to realize it and they're
going to reflect and they are going to

2262
02:14:52,231 --> 02:14:55,650
be radicalized in a
good way for the truth.

2263
02:14:55,980 --> 02:15:00,930
People who were former cult members go
on to become members of cult awareness

2264
02:15:00,931 --> 02:15:05,130
groups or lead call awareness groups are
actually had a couple on that have been

2265
02:15:05,131 --> 02:15:07,350
in Colton have talked openly about their,

2266
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:12,830
I think they share something and that
people love to be a part of a group.

2267
02:15:13,600 --> 02:15:18,060
It's a tribal thing. It is tribal. I
remember chanting and, and you know,

2268
02:15:18,061 --> 02:15:22,770
being in and it was exhilarating.
Hell no, we won't go, hey,

2269
02:15:22,771 --> 02:15:26,490
hey Lbj, how many kids did
you kill today? Did that,

2270
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:28,110
and um,

2271
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:32,430
you went to you march on Washington
because though that made sense.

2272
02:15:34,290 --> 02:15:38,190
It was it, you know, I don't think my
understanding of it totally made sense,

2273
02:15:38,191 --> 02:15:40,560
but in retrospect it was a,

2274
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:45,640
a messed up what I do,
but it'll just be coming.

2275
02:15:45,660 --> 02:15:49,760
We'll take it out on the HDI
website where interesting.

2276
02:15:50,130 --> 02:15:53,040
If worry about that. That's a
beautiful thing about being a comedian.

2277
02:15:53,850 --> 02:15:55,140
I don't have to worry about that shit.
You know,

2278
02:15:55,141 --> 02:15:58,230
I don't worry about it because
I just worry about it because I,

2279
02:15:59,220 --> 02:16:02,580
it's been done so many times and every
little thing they'll take. And then,

2280
02:16:03,090 --> 02:16:03,840
you know,

2281
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:08,580
there's always my 92 year
old mother who will somehow,

2282
02:16:08,581 --> 02:16:12,300
she's on Facebook and she sees these
things. She'd say, what were you doing?

2283
02:16:13,100 --> 02:16:18,060
Like she's to, well she knows I, but
she's very left wing. So she, yes, she,

2284
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:21,660
but she like, she totally
gives it reason the about, uh,

2285
02:16:21,661 --> 02:16:24,390
my critic critique of feminism
because she likes men.

2286
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:29,950
She's never been that kind of a feminist.
She's a feminist. Who, who? She humanity.

2287
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:33,190
She's a little naive I think,
you know, in her politics,

2288
02:16:33,191 --> 02:16:37,400
cause she's still very left wing,
but she's great.

2289
02:16:37,520 --> 02:16:41,320
It comes from a good place.
So I'm sympathetic. Not
only was I once a radical,

2290
02:16:41,321 --> 02:16:44,330
but I'm sympathetic to left us
because the people probably close.

2291
02:16:44,331 --> 02:16:47,260
Some of the people closest to
my heart are very left wing.

2292
02:16:47,380 --> 02:16:50,050
But they're not haters. They're not, no,

2293
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:53,750
they don't take a whole groups
of people impugn them as evil.

2294
02:16:54,570 --> 02:16:59,010
Well, I'm, I'm very sympathetic to a lot
of the ideas that left wing people have.

2295
02:16:59,011 --> 02:17:02,640
And I don't know if I consider myself
left wing or libertarian or what, but I'm,

2296
02:17:02,641 --> 02:17:05,880
I'm Kinda in the middle on the
line. I'm homeless politically. Yes.

2297
02:17:05,910 --> 02:17:07,470
I tried to think, well, maybe I'm,

2298
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:11,090
maybe I agree with the Republicans and
then they'll say something that's so

2299
02:17:11,630 --> 02:17:14,750
unacceptable. Yeah. And then I
think, oh, maybe Bernie Sanders.

2300
02:17:14,751 --> 02:17:19,600
And then 90% of all we wouldn't
mind is you'll say something.

2301
02:17:19,601 --> 02:17:22,460
And um,
and I thought I could be behind Hillary,

2302
02:17:22,461 --> 02:17:25,940
but she's kind of irritating and
I think on these women's issues,

2303
02:17:25,970 --> 02:17:30,470
it's going to be, I don't know, she
could be very, very bad for, you know,

2304
02:17:31,160 --> 02:17:35,030
issues I care about how so
she might not be, but, well,

2305
02:17:35,060 --> 02:17:39,290
in the current administration, there's
an invisible government, uh, in all,

2306
02:17:39,291 --> 02:17:43,640
in all administrations, there's
an invisible government of, uh,

2307
02:17:44,270 --> 02:17:45,081
people who,
you know,

2308
02:17:45,081 --> 02:17:48,740
regulators and people who work in little
agencies in the government and they

2309
02:17:48,741 --> 02:17:53,330
write policy, they white right?
Regulation. And so we've seen our schools,

2310
02:17:54,110 --> 02:17:57,890
a lot of the things I've been talking
about that are contrary to the interests

2311
02:17:57,891 --> 02:17:58,724
of boys.

2312
02:17:59,030 --> 02:18:03,080
This is coming out of government and
it's coming out of these agencies than

2313
02:18:03,081 --> 02:18:04,550
Democrats.
There they exist.

2314
02:18:04,580 --> 02:18:08,600
Both Republicans can't stop it and they
do it in other areas that I don't know

2315
02:18:08,601 --> 02:18:11,330
as much about it.
But in the democratic,

2316
02:18:11,331 --> 02:18:16,310
the social issues that anything
that affects education or media,

2317
02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:21,080
they're doing things that I just find
very problematic and not in the interest

2318
02:18:21,081 --> 02:18:23,180
of liberty or wellbeing.

2319
02:18:23,810 --> 02:18:27,590
And so that's when I worry
that she might not do it.

2320
02:18:27,591 --> 02:18:29,030
She might surprise us.

2321
02:18:29,260 --> 02:18:33,640
Why was assumed that those directions
are being prompted by special interest

2322
02:18:33,641 --> 02:18:36,790
groups and people that have gotten
people into power in the first place.

2323
02:18:36,850 --> 02:18:39,850
By the time you get to be a president,
you have so many people.

2324
02:18:39,851 --> 02:18:43,210
You're beholding to so many people
that have spent so much money.

2325
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:47,710
You almost have very little time to think
about anything other than reconciling

2326
02:18:47,711 --> 02:18:48,350
that

2327
02:18:48,350 --> 02:18:51,980
right. And it's probably not your primary
interest, but you're, you're, you're,

2328
02:18:52,550 --> 02:18:56,200
you want to help out the American
Association of University Women

2329
02:18:56,340 --> 02:18:59,950
and you assigned people to deal with
that when they run with it. Yeah.

2330
02:19:00,030 --> 02:19:03,120
And then they run with it and make
policy that you may or may not even agree

2331
02:19:03,121 --> 02:19:04,800
with,
but you kind of committed to it.

2332
02:19:05,050 --> 02:19:07,540
Bad policies in edge in my opinion,
in education.

2333
02:19:07,541 --> 02:19:09,190
So I worry about the Democrats there.

2334
02:19:09,220 --> 02:19:12,400
So there's a lot to worry about in both
parties. So I'm kind of a homeless.

2335
02:19:12,401 --> 02:19:13,470
But hmm.

2336
02:19:15,230 --> 02:19:17,720
Do you take satisfaction
in what you're doing?

2337
02:19:17,721 --> 02:19:21,140
Do you enjoy making these
factual feminist videos? And

2338
02:19:22,250 --> 02:19:26,210
I do too. I wish I weren't doing
it. I do not in this sense.

2339
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:27,073
There's so many things I,

2340
02:19:27,110 --> 02:19:30,620
a lot of interests and I would also like
to spend some period of my life just

2341
02:19:30,621 --> 02:19:35,621
being Adilla taught because I
love music and literature and art.

2342
02:19:35,820 --> 02:19:39,350
Love to go to travel and
this takes a lot of time.

2343
02:19:39,440 --> 02:19:43,520
It takes a lot of energy and not always
good energy because you're dealing with,

2344
02:19:43,940 --> 02:19:45,140
once again,

2345
02:19:45,141 --> 02:19:49,880
I have to read something that is so
problematic and sometimes it takes a long

2346
02:19:49,881 --> 02:19:52,130
time to untie knots in the truth.

2347
02:19:52,131 --> 02:19:54,200
It's easier to tie a knot
and the truth and on Taiwan,

2348
02:19:54,201 --> 02:19:59,201
so I'll have to write a long article
explaining why someone was so wrong and I

2349
02:19:59,961 --> 02:20:03,950
have to do it over and over again.
So it's tedious. On the other hand,

2350
02:20:04,010 --> 02:20:08,030
I don't like,
I don't want to see bullies winning.

2351
02:20:08,570 --> 02:20:13,550
And so I'm, I'm, I welcome the time where
more people come forward, but it does,

2352
02:20:13,580 --> 02:20:18,580
we do need to have more professors coming
forward because you need scholars and

2353
02:20:19,731 --> 02:20:22,490
you need people who can look at
the data. You need. Statisticians.

2354
02:20:22,491 --> 02:20:27,000
It's not enough to have activists. So
this can't be done by pundits. The heart,

2355
02:20:27,020 --> 02:20:27,171
you know,

2356
02:20:27,171 --> 02:20:31,700
the heavy lifting to push back the
political politically correct forces of

2357
02:20:31,701 --> 02:20:35,780
unreasoned on campus. It's going to
have to be other scholars that, that,

2358
02:20:36,590 --> 02:20:41,090
um, put up the stop sign or
you know, that, that encourage,

2359
02:20:41,510 --> 02:20:46,480
uh, uh, move towards, uh, you know,
we're more rational worldview,

2360
02:20:46,540 --> 02:20:49,550
but what's going to motivate
them to do that, to make a shift?

2361
02:20:49,580 --> 02:20:53,870
It's possible that things are getting
so bad that more will be emboldened,

2362
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:58,490
the more realize like what happened
to the Yale. Yeah. Now, now there's,

2363
02:20:58,491 --> 02:21:01,520
for example, there's Steve
Pinker, uh, I, he, yeah,

2364
02:21:01,521 --> 02:21:04,550
he's at Harvard and
there's Jonathan Heit at,

2365
02:21:04,610 --> 02:21:07,250
I believe he's now at Nyu was
at the University of Virginia.

2366
02:21:07,640 --> 02:21:10,100
They've been outspoken for a long time,

2367
02:21:10,101 --> 02:21:13,670
but they are really starting
to come out and call, cry,

2368
02:21:13,671 --> 02:21:14,990
foul about what's going on.

2369
02:21:14,991 --> 02:21:19,991
And they're powerful and they're
brilliant guys and tremendous command of,

2370
02:21:21,080 --> 02:21:21,913
you know,

2371
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:26,780
the literature of their fields and
they're able to bring that to bear and

2372
02:21:26,781 --> 02:21:31,340
fantastic lecturers and
essays and books and so forth.

2373
02:21:31,341 --> 02:21:33,860
So there's Jonathan Heit there,
Steven pinker. But I want more women.

2374
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:39,490
I think that it's going to take women's
scholars to challenge the head Gemini of

2375
02:21:39,651 --> 02:21:42,560
the, these, this hard line, you know,

2376
02:21:42,561 --> 02:21:46,640
male averse feminists
that, that, you know,

2377
02:21:46,641 --> 02:21:49,760
have a monopoly now on gender studies,
going to take some women's scholars.

2378
02:21:49,761 --> 02:21:53,000
So I'm waiting for them to come.
I'm, but they just, so far it hasn't,

2379
02:21:53,130 --> 02:21:55,940
it hasn't had, there are
a few, but not very many.

2380
02:21:56,180 --> 02:22:00,740
Two is there a single man out there?
The teacher's gender studies? Oh yeah.

2381
02:22:02,850 --> 02:22:07,310
One of those.
I'm thinking of one person,

2382
02:22:07,311 --> 02:22:11,270
I won't mention him, but he's so
frustrating. Reacts so quickly.

2383
02:22:11,271 --> 02:22:16,090
Those have such a visceral builtin.
Oh,

2384
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:20,120
I'm thinking of a particular individual
who is so frustrating, so frustrating.

2385
02:22:20,180 --> 02:22:22,520
You don't have to name his name,
but what's wrong with this poor bastard?

2386
02:22:22,850 --> 02:22:25,890
You know, I will say what's wrong with
him? And His name is Michael Kimmel.

2387
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:27,780
And what frustrates me,

2388
02:22:27,920 --> 02:22:31,320
he is a male feminist as radical
as any that I've mentioned.

2389
02:22:31,440 --> 02:22:34,140
And he was given a fortune,
or maybe not a fortune,

2390
02:22:34,141 --> 02:22:35,110
but a sizeable amount of money.

2391
02:22:35,111 --> 02:22:39,690
You should start one of the first
centers for the study of men. So he's at,

2392
02:22:40,290 --> 02:22:41,730
I think it's sooner,

2393
02:22:41,731 --> 02:22:45,180
you're one of the New York campuses and
he has all this money for a center to

2394
02:22:45,181 --> 02:22:49,010
study men. And he just said it
like men in my life, well in mine.

2395
02:22:49,230 --> 02:22:53,190
And he's a hardline feminist.
He believes that in toxic masculinity,

2396
02:22:53,191 --> 02:22:57,390
he loves to talk about things like that.
He takes the worst case,

2397
02:22:57,720 --> 02:22:59,880
male, um, you know,

2398
02:22:59,940 --> 02:23:03,800
a school shooter or some
deranged sociopath and, and,

2399
02:23:03,820 --> 02:23:07,380
and makes that a metaphor for all men.
He does that sort of thing. You know,

2400
02:23:07,381 --> 02:23:11,280
the Columbine killers, those are our
boys. All our boys. No, they're not.

2401
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:14,070
They are psychopathic
killers and they are extreme.

2402
02:23:14,071 --> 02:23:17,170
Even among psychopathic killers.
They do. No, they don't.

2403
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:21,720
They don't represent our boys.
And I'm overstating a little bit,

2404
02:23:21,721 --> 02:23:22,710
but not by much.

2405
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:27,690
So we finally get a center that's
going to study young men and,

2406
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:31,320
and it's run by him.
And who does he put on the board?

2407
02:23:31,321 --> 02:23:34,590
He's got eve Ensler who
wrote the vagina monologues,

2408
02:23:34,591 --> 02:23:39,200
which was kind of male averse. I
don't think there's a very, any,

2409
02:23:39,410 --> 02:23:43,170
any po Po, a positive males in
that they said maybe Vagina Bob,

2410
02:23:43,380 --> 02:23:45,630
but he's not very sympathetic.

2411
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:51,170
And then there's a Gloria
Steinem and Carol Gilligan there.

2412
02:23:51,690 --> 02:23:53,960
The, it's, it's not

2413
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:58,380
go and do work. So He's a male
gender studies professor. He's a,

2414
02:23:58,860 --> 02:24:01,740
he's a feminist. Sociologist, feminist,

2415
02:24:01,741 --> 02:24:06,290
sociologist w what does this
gentleman looked like? Silk.

2416
02:24:06,330 --> 02:24:09,450
Like what you would expect. Uh,
I dunno what you're imagining.

2417
02:24:09,451 --> 02:24:12,010
Is he overweight woman with
pink hair? No, no, no, no.

2418
02:24:12,020 --> 02:24:16,730
He knows normal cause it just,
no, I don't know what he's,

2419
02:24:16,740 --> 02:24:21,510
I don't know what forces created it,
but he, that's what we're dealing with.

2420
02:24:21,870 --> 02:24:24,690
So there's a few, a few of those.
They're like vampire familiars.

2421
02:24:24,720 --> 02:24:26,540
That's what they're a lot of speakers.
Yet when be played,

2422
02:24:27,300 --> 02:24:28,530
he would have these little,
uh,

2423
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:32,610
set these sycophants around them
that were not really vampires,

2424
02:24:32,611 --> 02:24:33,650
but they want it to be vampires.

2425
02:24:33,690 --> 02:24:36,510
They were hoping the vampires would
turn them and they would say anything.

2426
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:40,370
They'll say, well, he believes it and
he believes the statistics and, and

2427
02:24:40,860 --> 02:24:44,410
no, I was thinking maybe when he started
this center or he'd become a little more

2428
02:24:44,590 --> 02:24:48,020
sympathetic towards and I
don't see evidence of that.

2429
02:24:48,670 --> 02:24:52,270
He's still, well, you could certainly, if
you looked around, I mean the, the, the,

2430
02:24:52,271 --> 02:24:54,880
the problem is the, the, the numbers
of people that you're dealing with.

2431
02:24:54,881 --> 02:24:59,320
You're dealing with 300 plus million
people in this country and decades of new

2432
02:24:59,321 --> 02:25:02,770
stories. And if you want it to
look at the numbers in that way,

2433
02:25:02,771 --> 02:25:07,450
you could find a lot of evidence that
men have done horrible shit. I mean,

2434
02:25:07,480 --> 02:25:10,400
there's no, there's no doubt about
it. You look at our buttons since

2435
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:16,060
we talked before that male violence
sure are more violent and a society that

2436
02:25:16,061 --> 02:25:21,061
doesn't take in account the male capacity
for rule breaking and risk taking and

2437
02:25:21,761 --> 02:25:22,720
wreaking that you,
you know,

2438
02:25:22,870 --> 02:25:26,860
the boys who are insufficiently socialize,

2439
02:25:26,910 --> 02:25:30,460
have very unpleasant ways of making
themselves noticed and you have to be

2440
02:25:30,461 --> 02:25:31,294
careful.
But,

2441
02:25:32,140 --> 02:25:36,670
but it's this tiny minority and it usually
takes other men to protect the rest

2442
02:25:36,671 --> 02:25:41,110
of us from them. And I always wonder,
like just the other day in Paris,

2443
02:25:41,111 --> 02:25:44,080
there was this horrible terrorist attack.

2444
02:25:44,590 --> 02:25:48,940
And there was a little story
about in the news about, uh, this,

2445
02:25:48,950 --> 02:25:52,870
this cafe and these people
were slaughtered in the
cafe and there's this lovely

2446
02:25:53,410 --> 02:25:57,580
young woman who was in the hospital from
trauma and there was this beautiful man

2447
02:25:57,700 --> 02:25:58,990
who thrown herself on him.

2448
02:25:58,991 --> 02:26:03,220
His instinct was just to protect her
and protect as many people as he could.

2449
02:26:03,221 --> 02:26:05,950
His beautiful guy.
And I thought,

2450
02:26:05,951 --> 02:26:08,870
why can't we take him as emblematic
of what men can do, you know?

2451
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:11,620
But the gender scholars never,
we never find him.

2452
02:26:11,860 --> 02:26:15,400
We find serial killers. They
say, well, that's what men do.

2453
02:26:16,040 --> 02:26:17,930
Well, there certainly are a
lot of men serial killers.

2454
02:26:17,931 --> 02:26:21,290
The problem is I think when you focus
only on the negative aspects of it,

2455
02:26:21,291 --> 02:26:26,291
you also run the risk of self definition
by the people that listen to what he

2456
02:26:26,691 --> 02:26:30,800
has to say and take his class. You,
you become guilty by association.

2457
02:26:30,870 --> 02:26:32,930
You are a man like you.
You get those,

2458
02:26:33,080 --> 02:26:37,130
those guys who make those videos that I
am apologizing for every man ever before

2459
02:26:37,131 --> 02:26:39,680
me and they want to distinguish themselves
as being different and they want to

2460
02:26:39,681 --> 02:26:42,960
go way out of the way. Have you ever
seen that dear woman video? Okay.

2461
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:47,920
God, yes I have. And it's the worst
kind of gender profiling, isn't it?

2462
02:26:47,921 --> 02:26:48,790
I mean it's

2463
02:26:48,800 --> 02:26:51,530
perfect. It's perfect.
Cause those guys are,

2464
02:26:51,560 --> 02:26:55,580
those guys are the guys that wouldn't
survive if you took those guys on like a

2465
02:26:55,581 --> 02:26:56,660
track through the woods,

2466
02:26:56,690 --> 02:26:59,450
those the guys who would have the sprained
ankles and they would start weeping.

2467
02:26:59,630 --> 02:27:02,660
Those are the guys.
And those are the guys that if you'd left,

2468
02:27:02,690 --> 02:27:05,280
they would be at home with
your wife and they would, uh,

2469
02:27:05,360 --> 02:27:07,880
say horrible things about you and
what a terrible person you are.

2470
02:27:08,060 --> 02:27:11,300
And Try to get her to love them instead
of loving you because they're weak.

2471
02:27:11,330 --> 02:27:14,300
They're what?
Pardon my French weak bitches.

2472
02:27:14,420 --> 02:27:16,820
That's what Ben Likes
to call Ben like that.

2473
02:27:16,940 --> 02:27:21,410
And that's why they make those videos,
those videos, they're not made by normal.

2474
02:27:21,411 --> 02:27:24,140
Why? Why would a man apologize
for things at other men have done?

2475
02:27:24,440 --> 02:27:27,440
Have you've done something horrible,
you should say, dear women, I,

2476
02:27:27,441 --> 02:27:28,930
I've done some fucked up shit.
I've,

2477
02:27:28,931 --> 02:27:33,790
I've made some horrible
movies that portrayed women
in a very unfavorable line.

2478
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:36,650
I didn't consider the fact that some women
would watch those movies and it would

2479
02:27:36,860 --> 02:27:40,010
somehow or another define them in their
own way. I shouldn't have done that. Well,

2480
02:27:40,011 --> 02:27:41,480
this isn't what they're doing.
What they're doing.

2481
02:27:41,481 --> 02:27:44,080
They're apologizing for the other men.
Right.

2482
02:27:44,090 --> 02:27:47,450
And there's therefore setting
themselves up on a moral high ground,

2483
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:52,130
which is what a lot of male feminists do.
Their weak men, they're really weak, man.

2484
02:27:52,131 --> 02:27:54,860
They're unfavorable
sexually and they're there.

2485
02:27:54,890 --> 02:27:57,530
They're not the type of men
that women would choose.

2486
02:27:57,531 --> 02:28:01,670
So what they have done is they've tried
to figure out a way in the game too to

2487
02:28:01,671 --> 02:28:06,600
be like what men want is people
to love them. It's women wanted,

2488
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:10,910
everybody wants people to love them
and what when they don't have any

2489
02:28:11,060 --> 02:28:15,140
particularly outright masculine
characteristics, they're not attractive.

2490
02:28:15,141 --> 02:28:18,230
They're not handsome than not
bold and daring than a creative.

2491
02:28:18,231 --> 02:28:21,980
They're not profound or charismatic.
They male

2492
02:28:21,980 --> 02:28:23,660
feminists and that's what they do.

2493
02:28:23,661 --> 02:28:28,661
They become these sort of
gender traders that they dig,

2494
02:28:29,060 --> 02:28:32,120
call out all of the weakness
of all the other men.

2495
02:28:32,121 --> 02:28:34,250
Sort of highlight themselves
as being different.

2496
02:28:34,400 --> 02:28:37,400
I'm not saying it's all male feminist
cause again I think there's a lot of male

2497
02:28:37,401 --> 02:28:42,320
feminists that they take on this
idea because they do see sexism.

2498
02:28:42,400 --> 02:28:45,560
Yeah,
they do see they want people to be equal.

2499
02:28:45,561 --> 02:28:49,280
They want to be judged based on the
merits of who they are as a human being.

2500
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:50,930
I respect them.

2501
02:28:50,990 --> 02:28:54,820
I just would like them to consider that
things are not exactly the way they

2502
02:28:54,890 --> 02:28:59,210
think. Then they might've been
taught by a charismatic, uh,

2503
02:28:59,540 --> 02:29:00,650
women's studies professor.

2504
02:29:00,651 --> 02:29:04,430
They might be more complicated and they
should know that there was efforts to

2505
02:29:04,431 --> 02:29:09,431
keep people like me and Camille Polya
and Wendy Kaminer and a long list of us.

2506
02:29:09,831 --> 02:29:10,251
They were,

2507
02:29:10,251 --> 02:29:14,510
there were a group of feminists who were
not male averse who were sex positive

2508
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:18,080
and we were driven, you
know, we were not included.

2509
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:20,630
We were not invited to the table.
And there's a reason why kids,

2510
02:29:20,631 --> 02:29:24,010
they don't read us or if they do,
you know,

2511
02:29:24,050 --> 02:29:28,610
it's immediately just savaged and,
and very selective in what they sell.

2512
02:29:29,190 --> 02:29:29,820
So they had,

2513
02:29:29,820 --> 02:29:34,580
they haven't had the advantage on these
issues of hearing from a range of, uh,

2514
02:29:34,740 --> 02:29:36,550
a full range of opinion.
Yeah.

2515
02:29:36,750 --> 02:29:40,040
It's fascinating because none of
what you're saying is offensive.

2516
02:29:40,041 --> 02:29:43,190
None of what you're saying is derogatory
in the idea that you would somehow or

2517
02:29:43,191 --> 02:29:46,940
another trigger people or caused
the creation of safe spaces.

2518
02:29:46,941 --> 02:29:49,040
This is preposterous.
It's observed needed.

2519
02:29:49,100 --> 02:29:52,760
I needed an arm guards me to protect
the love it how there were women.

2520
02:29:52,790 --> 02:29:54,230
I love their women armed guards,

2521
02:29:54,231 --> 02:29:56,410
but they weren't protecting
me because they both,

2522
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:57,950
and this happened at Georgetown,

2523
02:29:58,370 --> 02:30:00,830
they gave me security guards
at Georgetown as well.

2524
02:30:01,450 --> 02:30:02,930
This was happening at Georgetown.

2525
02:30:03,260 --> 02:30:07,880
If for whatever reason among
social justice warriors as
they're sometimes called

2526
02:30:08,310 --> 02:30:12,710
clapping is thought to be triggering and
so when they approve of what you are,

2527
02:30:12,711 --> 02:30:17,360
their comrades say they do jazz
hands or gloves clicking and yes,

2528
02:30:17,361 --> 02:30:21,050
if you watch some of the mob's on campus,
they're clicking their fingers.

2529
02:30:24,830 --> 02:30:29,030
I just want to say even as a
former radical like don't do that.

2530
02:30:29,600 --> 02:30:32,760
Clapping is like beating me.
Like someone could be beating you.

2531
02:30:32,761 --> 02:30:35,120
Is that what it is? Maybe
it's this, it's just whatever.

2532
02:30:35,121 --> 02:30:39,910
It's just upsetting and distressing
and otherizing. It's otherizing navies.

2533
02:30:39,950 --> 02:30:44,950
That real otherizing nail term otherizing
tweeting as the other and by the way,

2534
02:30:46,190 --> 02:30:50,840
nobody does more otherizing
and demonizing. Then
these hard line feminists,

2535
02:30:50,930 --> 02:30:55,010
it's like everything they
say men do not everything,

2536
02:30:55,011 --> 02:30:56,780
but most of the things they say men do.
They do.

2537
02:30:57,020 --> 02:31:02,020
They stereotype demonize other eyes and
they don't just do micro aggressions.

2538
02:31:04,041 --> 02:31:06,080
They're macro aggressive.
They're very rude.

2539
02:31:06,410 --> 02:31:11,410
What is this fashion now among so many
feminists to be so snarky and mean and I

2540
02:31:12,690 --> 02:31:14,180
don't think being mean,
I mean men didn't,

2541
02:31:14,181 --> 02:31:17,960
we didn't succeed in
the world and you know,

2542
02:31:17,980 --> 02:31:21,050
universe because they were mean
and vicious. I mean that's,

2543
02:31:21,510 --> 02:31:23,910
why do they think that that is a recipe?

2544
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:29,010
Cause it gets effect. It has an effect
today with our social media climate.

2545
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:31,560
The fact that we have this new world,
this new environment,

2546
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:37,220
those snarky posts get the most reaction
to get the most retweets and favorites

2547
02:31:37,801 --> 02:31:38,880
and they get the most likes.

2548
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:43,500
And that is seen as currency is seen
as like a social media currency.

2549
02:31:43,860 --> 02:31:48,860
And so by attacking people you can also
get them to respond and engage you.

2550
02:31:49,190 --> 02:31:54,190
And it's a way they seek out a high
profile people that might be a,

2551
02:31:54,211 --> 02:31:56,130
that might have a difference
of opinion with them.

2552
02:31:56,250 --> 02:31:59,610
They'll seek them out and insult them
and force them to engage because someone,

2553
02:31:59,730 --> 02:32:02,520
you read something insulting about
you like, Whoa, like I told you,

2554
02:32:02,521 --> 02:32:06,750
like when I had been called a male
rights advocate by this really obese,

2555
02:32:06,751 --> 02:32:10,320
a feminist woman, I was like, what
is that mean? What does an Mra?

2556
02:32:10,320 --> 02:32:12,090
And I had to read it, I
just blocked her. I'm like,

2557
02:32:12,091 --> 02:32:14,640
I'm not gonna engage with someone who
just insults me and just says a bunch of

2558
02:32:14,641 --> 02:32:17,580
insulting shit and calls me a moron and
asshole and all these different things

2559
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:19,710
where I never even communicated with them.

2560
02:32:19,740 --> 02:32:23,760
I had no communication with her
whatsoever. She just decided to single.

2561
02:32:23,761 --> 02:32:27,990
And it wasn't just one, it was a,
there was quite a few of them. And um,

2562
02:32:28,200 --> 02:32:30,240
it's because a lot of people will react.

2563
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:34,890
You get that and it's your automatic
reaction to react to them. You know?

2564
02:32:34,891 --> 02:32:36,600
That's why they're yelling things at you.

2565
02:32:36,601 --> 02:32:40,620
They trying to get you to react to them
if they just talk to you in a normal way.

2566
02:32:40,860 --> 02:32:43,430
Bunch of people. I used to be
drawn it on Twitter because not,

2567
02:32:43,431 --> 02:32:46,780
not because I wanted to
react. I always, I am, uh, uh,

2568
02:32:46,860 --> 02:32:51,030
is the mother and the professor in
me if someone's carrying on right.

2569
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:54,530
And then I want to reason with
them. Right. And you know, and then

2570
02:32:56,390 --> 02:33:00,710
I have learned that it's a waste of
time in some cases. Not all learning.

2571
02:33:00,711 --> 02:33:05,360
We're all learning how to handle this,
this name definitely do not write,

2572
02:33:05,690 --> 02:33:09,260
engage late at night. It
keeps you up. I can't, I,

2573
02:33:09,510 --> 02:33:11,300
I've been tweeting like
at three in the morning,

2574
02:33:11,301 --> 02:33:15,630
I think this is insane because I'm,
I've gotten some exchange or,

2575
02:33:15,631 --> 02:33:18,050
or I'm watching an exchange.
It's not a good thing to do.

2576
02:33:18,051 --> 02:33:19,450
Do you not to eat after midnight.

2577
02:33:19,870 --> 02:33:22,870
Wonderful. And a lot of ways. All
right. And I, I'm a, I'm home. I have,

2578
02:33:23,440 --> 02:33:27,490
I hope that all this ridiculousness is
something that's going to be ironed out.

2579
02:33:27,730 --> 02:33:30,940
And I think that this is something that
all human beings are starting to learn

2580
02:33:30,941 --> 02:33:34,570
how to navigate the world of
social media and that these,

2581
02:33:34,571 --> 02:33:39,571
this kind of behavior with someone
just immediately get snarky and becomes

2582
02:33:40,391 --> 02:33:43,510
insulting just in order to get attention.
It's going to be laughed at.

2583
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:45,320
I think that's a good
point that we're going to,

2584
02:33:45,450 --> 02:33:48,200
it's going to evolve and
there will become, uh,

2585
02:33:48,450 --> 02:33:51,060
sort of unwritten rules of the game.

2586
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:56,120
And I hope one of the rules is don't
join a hitter at a Twitter hate mob.

2587
02:33:57,390 --> 02:33:57,870
Yes.

2588
02:33:57,870 --> 02:34:02,870
And attack some hapless
professor or someone that you
heard from somebody told a

2589
02:34:02,941 --> 02:34:07,050
joke and, and by the way, can we just
leave jokes alone altogether? I mean, let,

2590
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:12,000
let comedians tell their jokes that
you can't now have a comedian on campus

2591
02:34:12,300 --> 02:34:13,710
because everyone will be triggered.

2592
02:34:14,340 --> 02:34:18,040
Well, comedians are bullies. If you
make a joke about you're a bully,

2593
02:34:18,310 --> 02:34:23,230
someone disagrees. People like George
Carlin were, that was where they were.

2594
02:34:23,231 --> 02:34:26,650
They were on campus and,
and you know it,

2595
02:34:26,700 --> 02:34:28,480
most of us won't work on campuses now.

2596
02:34:28,840 --> 02:34:31,630
I know a big percentage of
comics won't work on campuses.

2597
02:34:31,660 --> 02:34:32,980
And apparently their little committees,

2598
02:34:32,981 --> 02:34:37,090
I read the story about little committees
that decide which comedian to invite

2599
02:34:37,540 --> 02:34:41,740
and they have to try out and, and there
are so many ways you can strike out.

2600
02:34:41,770 --> 02:34:45,730
I mean forget the obvious ways you can,
everything is offensive.

2601
02:34:48,700 --> 02:34:52,030
Jokes are offensive, jokes are
triggering. I had a guy, I mean this,

2602
02:34:52,031 --> 02:34:56,740
this is going way back.
This is going back to the early nineties.

2603
02:34:57,220 --> 02:34:59,920
I used to do a lot of
colleges when I was coming up,

2604
02:34:59,921 --> 02:35:01,210
but it was way easier back then.

2605
02:35:01,211 --> 02:35:04,980
There was no social media and it was
not hard to do. And this is like, um,

2606
02:35:05,940 --> 02:35:09,260
Earl like 1991, 92 pre-internet, uh,

2607
02:35:09,310 --> 02:35:12,640
ice do a lot of them because it was
a great way to make money. But, uh,

2608
02:35:12,641 --> 02:35:16,480
I remember one time I used to
do this Q and a thing with kids.

2609
02:35:16,670 --> 02:35:18,550
They would ask me questions and you know,

2610
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:21,580
I would just joke around after the show.
So I do my show.

2611
02:35:21,730 --> 02:35:25,410
Like I didn't have anywhere to go
so down. And so the guy goes, uh,

2612
02:35:26,170 --> 02:35:30,160
the guy goes, I forget what, what
he said something about tell a joke.

2613
02:35:30,161 --> 02:35:33,910
So I said to Jews, walk into a bar,
they buy it. Thank you very much.

2614
02:35:33,911 --> 02:35:35,230
You know it's a joke.
It's a joke.

2615
02:35:35,340 --> 02:35:39,880
And he came up to me after the show and
said that was really offensive what you

2616
02:35:39,881 --> 02:35:40,450
said about you.

2617
02:35:40,450 --> 02:35:43,510
And I could tell he was like testing
the waters of whether or not he should

2618
02:35:43,511 --> 02:35:45,370
actually be offended. I go,
are you really offended? I go,

2619
02:35:45,371 --> 02:35:47,590
what's offensive fence by that?
It was the stereotype.

2620
02:35:47,591 --> 02:35:51,250
It's stereotypical and I'm like, well
it's about Jewish people buying things,

2621
02:35:51,251 --> 02:35:54,250
being successful in business.
Like it's not negative at all.

2622
02:35:54,350 --> 02:35:58,810
Like he was perplexed, funny but, but
it's, it's a stupid old street joke,

2623
02:35:58,811 --> 02:36:03,760
but stay saying that it's offensive was
an automatic reaction to this young kid

2624
02:36:03,850 --> 02:36:07,720
that hadn't yet experienced this wave
of social justice warriors that were

2625
02:36:07,721 --> 02:36:09,970
reinforcing these stupid
ideas he has in his head.

2626
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:14,410
Like he had decided that since I was
saying something about an ethnicity or

2627
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:18,570
minority and they're just even
saying a joke about it was offensive.

2628
02:36:18,571 --> 02:36:20,640
But it's clearly not an offensive joke.
It's,

2629
02:36:20,860 --> 02:36:24,950
it's about Jewish people being
good at business. I mean,
that's the whole, it's a,

2630
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:29,410
it's not even a good joke. It's, it's
terrible. But I, I'll never forget it,

2631
02:36:29,470 --> 02:36:32,980
him coming up to me and saying that, I
found that really offensive. I'm like,

2632
02:36:32,981 --> 02:36:35,020
get the fuck out of here.
You didn't think that was offensive.

2633
02:36:35,050 --> 02:36:38,140
That's not offensive. It's
just not, it's not good.

2634
02:36:38,320 --> 02:36:42,220
But it's certainly not offensive to
see any Mel Brooks movies or listen to

2635
02:36:42,310 --> 02:36:45,160
Jackie Mason or, you
know, well, it's just,

2636
02:36:45,190 --> 02:36:49,540
it's that thing where you're young and
you want to kind of establish your,

2637
02:36:49,541 --> 02:36:54,000
your viewpoint and you want to
separate yourself from the, the,

2638
02:36:54,120 --> 02:36:56,740
the fools of the world and say that,
you know,

2639
02:36:56,760 --> 02:37:00,280
you're going to be different than your
parents and you're going to branch out on

2640
02:37:00,281 --> 02:37:04,840
your own and you're, you know, you're a
fucking young mind. They're 18 years old,

2641
02:37:04,841 --> 02:37:08,530
1920 whatever they are there.
They're off, away on their own,

2642
02:37:08,620 --> 02:37:12,760
staying in dorms and reinforcing
each other's terrible ideas together.

2643
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:15,070
And some of them more
sensitive than others.

2644
02:37:15,080 --> 02:37:18,050
And some of them grew up in a more
suppressive environment than others.

2645
02:37:18,051 --> 02:37:21,650
Some of them more easily led than others
and some of them will have ideas that

2646
02:37:21,651 --> 02:37:23,600
they will nurture when
they're 18 or 19 years old.

2647
02:37:23,600 --> 02:37:27,350
They will completely abandoned when they
get into their 20s and they realize how

2648
02:37:27,351 --> 02:37:30,170
preposterous those ideas were in less.

2649
02:37:30,320 --> 02:37:34,520
They get completely indoctrinated and
then they go on to become a part of the

2650
02:37:34,521 --> 02:37:38,340
very system that indoctrinated them
themselves. I think that's a lot of the,

2651
02:37:38,600 --> 02:37:41,750
the fears that a lot of people looking
at it from the outside like me,

2652
02:37:41,960 --> 02:37:44,270
that's a lot of the fears that we have.
Like we,

2653
02:37:44,271 --> 02:37:47,780
we wonder like this is sort
of a closed loop. The the,

2654
02:37:47,781 --> 02:37:51,830
the closed loop of becoming an academic
yourself and reinforcing these ideas

2655
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:54,620
without a whole lot of
interaction with the real world,

2656
02:37:54,920 --> 02:37:58,190
without a whole lot of interaction with
people that have differing opinions.

2657
02:37:58,191 --> 02:38:01,960
It may be just as intelligent as you and
maybe you can learn from each other or

2658
02:38:01,961 --> 02:38:05,510
come up with some sort of a middle ground,
but that's not tolerated. There's no,

2659
02:38:05,780 --> 02:38:10,610
you can't, you don't tolerate anybody
that looks at these ideas from a different

2660
02:38:10,611 --> 02:38:15,380
perspective or from a singular point of
view like it at all has to be in this

2661
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:17,690
very rigid ideological,

2662
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:21,590
predetermined pattern or behavior
that everybody locks into. Yeah,

2663
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:25,310
well we need a rebellion
or youth rebellion.

2664
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:29,420
Well is that w do don't you think
that's kind of going on though?

2665
02:38:29,421 --> 02:38:32,420
Like the reaction to these videos,
there's a rebellion,

2666
02:38:32,500 --> 02:38:33,230
the Olsen,

2667
02:38:33,230 --> 02:38:38,230
it is a rebellion and this will give
you heart when you read in this as I do

2668
02:38:39,401 --> 02:38:41,080
because on Twitter people
send me these things,

2669
02:38:41,440 --> 02:38:45,340
you'll read an article in the Yale Daily
News or the Amhurst whatever newspaper

2670
02:38:45,341 --> 02:38:46,880
they have.
Um,

2671
02:38:47,590 --> 02:38:50,680
people will write something very annoying.

2672
02:38:50,681 --> 02:38:55,030
The PC to the extreme and then you'd
read the letters and those give you heart

2673
02:38:55,031 --> 02:39:00,031
because you still see there is still
very reasonable people in these colleges

2674
02:39:01,181 --> 02:39:03,070
who are not buying it,
but they have to

2675
02:39:03,790 --> 02:39:07,360
be somehow empowered. I don't
know how to do that. Yeah.

2676
02:39:07,361 --> 02:39:08,380
I don't know how to do that either.

2677
02:39:08,381 --> 02:39:13,381
But I think information and open
discourse and just those that's,

2678
02:39:14,380 --> 02:39:17,680
that's exactly what's going on right now
with the Internet and with social media.

2679
02:39:17,681 --> 02:39:22,681
Those two things are the most important
aspects of a society evolving and a

2680
02:39:22,961 --> 02:39:27,790
society without really
without any buddy running it.

2681
02:39:28,030 --> 02:39:28,301
I mean,

2682
02:39:28,301 --> 02:39:32,020
the thing about colleges and the thing
about a university courses that you have

2683
02:39:32,021 --> 02:39:34,660
a professor,
you want to get a good grade,

2684
02:39:34,780 --> 02:39:39,730
the professor has an ideology that
they're sort of passing on to you and you

2685
02:39:39,731 --> 02:39:44,080
want to try to manipulate them a little
bit and right in a way that you think

2686
02:39:44,081 --> 02:39:47,230
that they will, that will appeal to
their sensibilities, their ideology.

2687
02:39:47,650 --> 02:39:49,420
While the Internet doesn't have that,
I mean you have,

2688
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:54,190
you've giant groups of people,
but ultimately just have people.

2689
02:39:54,400 --> 02:39:55,480
I mean that's really what it is.

2690
02:39:55,510 --> 02:39:59,830
There's a lot of different kinds of ideas
that are floating around out there and

2691
02:39:59,831 --> 02:40:03,760
you're going to find people that resonate
with your ideas and people that don't.

2692
02:40:03,761 --> 02:40:05,380
And along the way you're gonna,

2693
02:40:05,620 --> 02:40:08,950
you're gonna have people that read some
of the things that you've written or

2694
02:40:08,951 --> 02:40:10,000
some of the things that you've said.

2695
02:40:10,240 --> 02:40:14,070
And take it down and call you a fool
and you're going to have to look at that

2696
02:40:14,071 --> 02:40:16,980
and you're gonna have to go, wow.
Maybe when I yelled at that Yale Dean,

2697
02:40:16,981 --> 02:40:19,670
I was being a fucking idiot.
Maybe that his grandstanding,

2698
02:40:19,740 --> 02:40:21,930
maybe that is preposterous,
you know,

2699
02:40:21,931 --> 02:40:24,360
and maybe I would not have done
that if I was alone with him.

2700
02:40:24,361 --> 02:40:27,450
Maybe that is just something that I did
because I was caught up in the fervor of

2701
02:40:27,451 --> 02:40:27,610
the [inaudible]

2702
02:40:27,610 --> 02:40:30,500
group, by the way, that professor who

2703
02:40:32,150 --> 02:40:36,170
really shamed herself by acting
out, but, and it got on the media,

2704
02:40:36,171 --> 02:40:40,260
the one from University of Missouri.
Yeah. The communications professor. Um,

2705
02:40:40,430 --> 02:40:44,450
she did write, she wrote an apology
and I thought it was, I mean,

2706
02:40:44,451 --> 02:40:49,130
I'm willing to forgive her because it was
heartfelt and she did say that she was

2707
02:40:49,131 --> 02:40:50,720
sort of horrified to watch herself.

2708
02:40:51,350 --> 02:40:56,090
And so I'm thinking now she may be just
a hard, but I thought people were saying,

2709
02:40:56,091 --> 02:40:58,490
oh, she's just trying to keep
her job. Well, first of all,

2710
02:40:58,491 --> 02:41:02,450
I don't think we should be after people's
jobs. And you know, in that way, I mean,

2711
02:41:02,451 --> 02:41:04,850
not that she did teach
a lot of weird courses.

2712
02:41:04,910 --> 02:41:08,960
She taught a course on abstinence
and no, no, 50 shades of grey.

2713
02:41:08,961 --> 02:41:13,550
Is it 50 or 60 whenever 50 she taught
us a course on 50 shades of gray and she

2714
02:41:13,551 --> 02:41:17,430
taught a course abstinence and the
twilight series. Oh, she did? Yes.

2715
02:41:17,570 --> 02:41:21,590
About how Edward didn't have sex
with her and Bob Midwall, she wrote,

2716
02:41:21,591 --> 02:41:25,370
Edward was 17 years old. The fuck he
was. Okay. He was a hundred years old.

2717
02:41:25,640 --> 02:41:29,780
He just died when he was 17 he became a
vampire. That's a Goddam pedophile movie.

2718
02:41:29,810 --> 02:41:30,220
Wow.

2719
02:41:30,220 --> 02:41:34,470
The change. 17 years old. You should check
your privilege lady and her privilege.

2720
02:41:34,920 --> 02:41:36,030
But I did.
I didn't.

2721
02:41:38,870 --> 02:41:42,140
I need a jazz hands it, but it's hard to
do that for audio. Most of our audiences,

2722
02:41:42,170 --> 02:41:42,950
audio only.

2723
02:41:42,950 --> 02:41:46,220
Oh, really? Massive trauma. They
don't see my ticks. Great. No, no,

2724
02:41:46,230 --> 02:41:49,860
but I don't worry about it. My hair too
much in it. It's not a bad thing. Ah.

2725
02:41:49,940 --> 02:41:54,380
I've had fired head constantly.
I'd throw it on my shoulders.

2726
02:41:54,381 --> 02:41:58,250
I flip it. Don't you hate
some, I'm seeing yourself.

2727
02:41:58,930 --> 02:42:00,680
I'm so used to it. Oh, you're used to it.

2728
02:42:00,740 --> 02:42:05,740
So I wa I've watched some lectures and
I have ticks and I sh I don't know what

2729
02:42:05,961 --> 02:42:09,680
to do and I thought, oh, but my age,
I'm not going to go change. So yeah.

2730
02:42:09,820 --> 02:42:12,010
I mean you learned a lot
about what's annoying to you.

2731
02:42:12,050 --> 02:42:14,410
Like a lot of people do things
that are annoying to other people.

2732
02:42:14,411 --> 02:42:17,620
They don't know it.
You learn a lot about like speech ticks.

2733
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:20,590
We were just talking about that in the
last podcast we did though the expression

2734
02:42:20,620 --> 02:42:22,330
like,
like people say like all the time,

2735
02:42:22,331 --> 02:42:24,550
like there's like a thing
like that you do like,

2736
02:42:24,700 --> 02:42:28,510
just like a sophisticated version of, um,
and there's another one. I'm lecturing,

2737
02:42:28,511 --> 02:42:32,730
I do a lot of ums. That's
normal. It's your, it's your
thinking, you know, and we,

2738
02:42:32,740 --> 02:42:33,680
we sort of accept.

2739
02:42:34,150 --> 02:42:37,150
That's why it's so impressive when you
meet a guy like Sam Harris that can get

2740
02:42:37,151 --> 02:42:41,080
through hours long conversation with
no preparation whatsoever and never

2741
02:42:41,090 --> 02:42:43,720
[inaudible] and speaking
perfect pair. Perfect. Yeah.

2742
02:42:43,721 --> 02:42:45,340
I don't know how the fuck he does it.
Yeah.

2743
02:42:45,720 --> 02:42:49,550
Did you ever hear Christopher
Hitchens? No. No, I ever had a chance.

2744
02:42:50,140 --> 02:42:53,760
I would loved to get drunk with
that guy over there. I know Lowe's,

2745
02:42:53,910 --> 02:42:56,170
it didn't say anything
stupid and him eviscerate me.

2746
02:42:56,440 --> 02:42:58,000
I remember him with most deaf,

2747
02:42:58,180 --> 02:43:01,330
he was on a real time with Bill
Maher with most DEF, most def,

2748
02:43:01,331 --> 02:43:02,650
didn't know what the fuck
he was talking about.

2749
02:43:02,651 --> 02:43:05,650
He was still who I love as a rapper.
I think he's an Austin musician,

2750
02:43:05,830 --> 02:43:09,730
but he was talking about the difference
between that Taliban and al Qaeda and he

2751
02:43:09,731 --> 02:43:11,980
didn't understand the
difference between two and

2752
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:14,710
Hitchens just lit him up.
He was drunk.

2753
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:17,440
He got a couple of drinks in him
and he just decided like this is,

2754
02:43:17,860 --> 02:43:18,700
this is the problem.

2755
02:43:18,701 --> 02:43:22,180
These people with opinions that have
never bothered to research exactly what

2756
02:43:22,181 --> 02:43:23,770
they're talking about
and he just lit him up.

2757
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:24,673
Yeah,
he,

2758
02:43:25,420 --> 02:43:29,780
you do not want to be taken down by
someone like Christopher Hitchens. Yeah,

2759
02:43:29,980 --> 02:43:32,790
he was. He was very funny and
provocative and a lot of ways too.

2760
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:34,870
He wrote that a vanity fair piece,

2761
02:43:34,871 --> 02:43:39,310
which is very funny about women not being
funny. You know why women are funny,

2762
02:43:39,311 --> 02:43:43,330
which of course is not
really true. There's a lot of
women that are really funny,

2763
02:43:43,331 --> 02:43:46,180
but he was pointing the fact that women
that are funny or kind of like their

2764
02:43:46,181 --> 02:43:48,580
butchy and almost like a
masculine sort of a way.

2765
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:50,200
Yeah.
He's not really right about that,

2766
02:43:50,201 --> 02:43:52,690
but he's not right about that because
Sarah Silvermans one of the funniest

2767
02:43:52,691 --> 02:43:57,340
people on the planet and she's very
feminine. She's not butchy at all. Yeah.

2768
02:43:57,341 --> 02:44:00,490
But even going back people to, do you
remember? Do you remember Madeline Kahn?

2769
02:44:00,590 --> 02:44:04,000
Sure, sure. It's so funny.
[inaudible] was fabulous and you know,

2770
02:44:04,001 --> 02:44:08,200
and be Joan Rivers. I mean,
look, Joan Rivers is one of
the best all time comedian.

2771
02:44:08,730 --> 02:44:13,380
She was miss her. Yes, but
she was going on a campus.

2772
02:44:13,381 --> 02:44:17,020
You'd be so great. Yes. Well she was
back then even she was talking about it.

2773
02:44:17,021 --> 02:44:18,460
I mean, when she was alive, she was,

2774
02:44:18,520 --> 02:44:21,970
she was talking about how ridiculous it
is that these kids are fucking babies.

2775
02:44:21,971 --> 02:44:26,620
You know, she would be, and, and young
women need to see people like her. I mean,

2776
02:44:26,621 --> 02:44:30,550
she's, she was funny and she was
smart. She was fast. And Yeah,

2777
02:44:30,551 --> 02:44:33,700
there's a lot of young up
and coming comedians right
now too that are women that

2778
02:44:33,701 --> 02:44:36,790
are really hilarious, that are very
feminine. It's, you don't have to be,

2779
02:44:36,820 --> 02:44:40,070
and then they should be one thing.
They should, they can be feminine,

2780
02:44:40,380 --> 02:44:42,340
but they shouldn't be politically correct.

2781
02:44:42,400 --> 02:44:46,540
It would be terrible if we had a group
of feminists that did that to actually

2782
02:44:46,541 --> 02:44:50,140
practicing comedians that within
start policing. I don't see that.

2783
02:44:50,590 --> 02:44:53,080
But it has happened in other professions.

2784
02:44:53,210 --> 02:44:57,800
Well, there are some male feminists
comedians and they're fucking Baroud. Oh,

2785
02:44:57,890 --> 02:44:59,870
Ooh.
The brutal,

2786
02:45:00,020 --> 02:45:03,800
it's like are they listened to it and
going to have small groups of people that

2787
02:45:03,801 --> 02:45:07,300
subscribe to their ideas and you know,
they're happy to join in.

2788
02:45:07,310 --> 02:45:10,130
They think they're great and they're
being forced by the echo chamber.

2789
02:45:10,131 --> 02:45:13,250
But you know, they're just,
they're saying nonsense.

2790
02:45:13,310 --> 02:45:16,760
But I would think comedians like,
and like the atheist, these are,

2791
02:45:16,820 --> 02:45:20,030
these are skeptics there.
People who thought through for them,

2792
02:45:20,330 --> 02:45:24,890
you would think that they
would not be vulnerable to um,

2793
02:45:24,891 --> 02:45:29,210
sort of a political hijacking by a group
that believes a lot of things that are

2794
02:45:29,211 --> 02:45:32,990
demonstrably false and yet they
were vulnerable. They are, I think,

2795
02:45:33,290 --> 02:45:35,900
not all of them.
I mean there was a division very divisive,

2796
02:45:36,290 --> 02:45:38,240
well, people don't like
being criticized, you know,

2797
02:45:38,241 --> 02:45:39,530
and if you're criticized in your,

2798
02:45:39,531 --> 02:45:42,560
you're mocked and you're taken
down because of your ideas,

2799
02:45:42,830 --> 02:45:44,890
you'll soften those ideas.
You'll bend with the wind.

2800
02:45:44,970 --> 02:45:48,240
You get what I'm saying? If it happens
to Comedians, it'll be, it won't happen.

2801
02:45:48,260 --> 02:45:51,300
They know it just can't because it's going
to be so tempting for someone to come

2802
02:45:51,301 --> 02:45:55,900
in and you just blow it away.
The way we

2803
02:45:55,900 --> 02:45:59,140
got to be comedians in the first
place is by resisting all that stuff.

2804
02:45:59,141 --> 02:46:02,860
With the real problem becomes when they
become successful and maybe another

2805
02:46:02,861 --> 02:46:03,460
arena,

2806
02:46:03,460 --> 02:46:07,960
like maybe they become a talk show host
or they have a big important job with a

2807
02:46:07,961 --> 02:46:10,010
network on some or something like that.

2808
02:46:10,010 --> 02:46:12,430
And they don't want to rock
the boat. Like, you'll know,

2809
02:46:12,431 --> 02:46:16,070
it's like a lot of comedians.
They get sitcoms and then the city comes,

2810
02:46:16,071 --> 02:46:18,800
you can really popular and they
pretty much stopped performing. They,

2811
02:46:18,940 --> 02:46:21,440
they stopped doing standup.
That happened with a lot of them.

2812
02:46:21,441 --> 02:46:24,200
Jerry Seinfeld didn't
perform for a long time. Um,

2813
02:46:25,970 --> 02:46:29,000
Tim Allen, same thing. You can
get in trouble. You can get like,

2814
02:46:29,030 --> 02:46:34,010
I know guys who had sitcoms where there
the network actually told them to not do

2815
02:46:34,011 --> 02:46:36,410
stand up.
Just put it aside for awhile.

2816
02:46:36,710 --> 02:46:39,290
That was a fuck's his name from uh,

2817
02:46:41,750 --> 02:46:44,690
John Stamos Sitcom that Bob Saget.

2818
02:46:44,691 --> 02:46:49,100
Bob Saget who has like a really dirty act,
but it was on like a family sitcom.

2819
02:46:49,101 --> 02:46:52,880
They look shut him down. Like he
stopped doing standup for a long time.

2820
02:46:53,960 --> 02:46:57,450
Well, I wish we had George Carlin
and wish we had more at Saul.

2821
02:46:57,560 --> 02:47:02,170
It meant more salt. He's still around.
Yeah. You Miss tweeted at me a couple of,

2822
02:47:02,380 --> 02:47:04,550
yeah, he's an him 20 year ago. Yeah.

2823
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:06,470
More cells on Twitter is
still doing some stuff.

2824
02:47:07,330 --> 02:47:09,380
A few of those guys that are
still out there, you know,

2825
02:47:09,381 --> 02:47:13,670
a Dick Gregory's actually at the comedy
store this Sunday. I think I'm going, man,

2826
02:47:13,880 --> 02:47:17,360
I'm going for sure. I mean, while he's
still alive, I want to come see him.

2827
02:47:17,361 --> 02:47:20,690
And Dick Gregory is the guy who, I mean,
he's not just a comedian and an activist,

2828
02:47:20,691 --> 02:47:23,540
but he actually is the guy
who brought Geraldo Rivera.

2829
02:47:23,541 --> 02:47:27,740
This is approved or footage
where he showed it on
television like I think it was

2830
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:32,060
10 years after Kennedy was assassinated
that showed Kennedy's head violently

2831
02:47:32,061 --> 02:47:35,750
going back into the left and made people
start to consider the fact that maybe

2832
02:47:35,751 --> 02:47:37,970
he was shot by someone other
than Lee Harvey Oswald.

2833
02:47:37,971 --> 02:47:41,720
And it's hard all those conspiracy theory.
So you a fascinating kind of a guy.

2834
02:47:42,260 --> 02:47:46,850
He is it. My father was a big fan of his
and it lately. And you know, I don't know.

2835
02:47:47,250 --> 02:47:51,290
He's, he's taken some odd positions,
but on what Dick Gregory on what?

2836
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:53,730
I don't remember, I just remember
thinking what happened with him. But he,

2837
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:56,480
but people do that and then they
come back also, they get really old.

2838
02:47:56,510 --> 02:48:00,950
He just got up, but he could,
sure he's, he was in his
prime. He was so funny. Yeah.

2839
02:48:01,340 --> 02:48:06,020
And while he's a very important
guy and it goes back, he's gone.

2840
02:48:06,021 --> 02:48:10,850
But yeah, those, that spirit, it's, I'm
sure it's alive. It's the spirit of cars.

2841
02:48:10,851 --> 02:48:13,860
A lot of those up. Bill Burrs,
a great guy for that today.

2842
02:48:13,910 --> 02:48:17,780
There's a lot of those people out there
that are just, they need to be mocked.

2843
02:48:17,930 --> 02:48:21,470
And you know, that's for comedians.
That's fuel. That's like we, we,

2844
02:48:21,480 --> 02:48:25,760
we feed on dry wood, you know,
and fire catches dry wood,

2845
02:48:26,780 --> 02:48:29,930
comedian invasion of the campuses.
But we're not going to do it.

2846
02:48:29,931 --> 02:48:30,740
It's not worth it.

2847
02:48:30,740 --> 02:48:34,760
It's like the too many angry people
like would crack one joke and we'll get

2848
02:48:35,030 --> 02:48:39,260
angry, you know, quote unquote Hashtag
activists that will attack you for days.

2849
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,620
It's not worth it. I'm not
going to go, it's not worth it.

2850
02:48:42,650 --> 02:48:45,590
They'll start chanting in the middle of
your show and disrupt your performance.

2851
02:48:45,770 --> 02:48:48,350
They think that their sensibilities are
more important than your performance.

2852
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:52,850
It's just, it's nonsense. It's not the
make them go out there and earn a living,

2853
02:48:53,150 --> 02:48:57,200
pay bills, get drunk, do stupid
things, get their car towed,

2854
02:48:57,290 --> 02:48:59,050
then come to a show,
come to a show.

2855
02:48:59,051 --> 02:49:01,850
And you understand reality come to
show when you understand bills and

2856
02:49:01,851 --> 02:49:06,110
frustrations and you know, come to a
show when you're an adult right now,

2857
02:49:06,111 --> 02:49:08,910
you're a baby that soften some.
I mean you're,

2858
02:49:09,030 --> 02:49:13,440
you're a child who's essentially gone
from your house to some sort of a holding

2859
02:49:14,160 --> 02:49:15,540
penitentiary till they're,

2860
02:49:15,550 --> 02:49:19,410
they're indoctrinating you with all
these wacky ideas and you want to yell at

2861
02:49:19,411 --> 02:49:20,244
people.

2862
02:49:21,120 --> 02:49:23,760
I Dunno. Is there anything else you want
to add before we wrap this thing up?

2863
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:28,590
We did three hours. Are you serious?
Yeah. Oh my goodness. Flies by crazy.

2864
02:49:28,950 --> 02:49:32,490
That's how it goes. It's been fun.
Yeah. It's been great man cave here.

2865
02:49:34,320 --> 02:49:36,360
Some people have seen this,
this, it's getting more manly.

2866
02:49:36,361 --> 02:49:41,280
That's a recent addition, that mule
deer head. That's a recent one. But uh,

2867
02:49:41,310 --> 02:49:41,551
yeah,

2868
02:49:41,551 --> 02:49:44,970
it's all stuff that either people have
given me like this little biggie statue

2869
02:49:44,971 --> 02:49:49,050
or as Buddha, I dunno. It's just sort of
accumulates or stuff that I've put here.

2870
02:49:49,850 --> 02:49:53,130
Yeah. But this is where I'm, I told
you before the show started, I, I,

2871
02:49:53,180 --> 02:49:55,920
I have to do this because in
my house I'm a little bitch.

2872
02:49:56,220 --> 02:49:58,080
My House has been completely women aside.

2873
02:49:58,450 --> 02:49:59,283
Well that's,
I look,

2874
02:49:59,350 --> 02:50:03,100
I recognize things is it
my sons or husband might've
brought in and I would have

2875
02:50:04,120 --> 02:50:06,850
pushed aside.
I found a place for them in the attic.

2876
02:50:06,851 --> 02:50:08,040
I have things like this in the end.

2877
02:50:08,110 --> 02:50:11,620
Yeah. Mo, when I shot that elk, it's
out in the hallway. My wife was like,

2878
02:50:11,621 --> 02:50:13,360
what are you going to do with
this? I'm like, don't worry.

2879
02:50:13,361 --> 02:50:17,990
I'll bring it to the office.
Jesus Christ. Tacos. Tacos.

2880
02:50:17,991 --> 02:50:18,824
So listen,

2881
02:50:19,150 --> 02:50:21,820
thank you very much for doing this are
really appreciate you flying out here and

2882
02:50:21,821 --> 02:50:24,550
thank you for doing that. That video
series. I think it's excellent.

2883
02:50:24,551 --> 02:50:25,630
I think it's really important.

2884
02:50:25,631 --> 02:50:30,631
It's important for people to see that
you are a kind and thoughtful person who

2885
02:50:31,151 --> 02:50:32,280
is just you.

2886
02:50:32,290 --> 02:50:37,150
You are expressing yourself because you
feel that there is an unchecked point or

2887
02:50:37,151 --> 02:50:41,590
that there is a position that a lot of
people have sort of taken on feminism.

2888
02:50:41,591 --> 02:50:45,670
That's not necessarily in line with
how you think the, the, the, the,

2889
02:50:45,671 --> 02:50:48,980
the true nature of it was supposed to
be when it was originally established.

2890
02:50:49,040 --> 02:50:49,650
Yeah.

2891
02:50:49,650 --> 02:50:53,040
And if they show me I'm wrong, I'll
change my point of view. I'm open,

2892
02:50:53,280 --> 02:50:57,510
but don't cut off debate.
That's what's happened. So I
had to go on Youtube, I can,

2893
02:50:57,570 --> 02:51:00,510
you know, I'm not on the, I mean
I, I will visit the campuses,

2894
02:51:00,511 --> 02:51:03,900
but mainly now I'm making videos for the,

2895
02:51:04,140 --> 02:51:05,940
maybe the kids younger
than the millennials.

2896
02:51:05,941 --> 02:51:09,210
They're going to come along and rebel
against these two people in college.

2897
02:51:09,480 --> 02:51:13,390
I think very likely. That's possible. I
think. I think as we were saying before,

2898
02:51:13,391 --> 02:51:18,391
that these people that are just learning
how to navigate social media and we're

2899
02:51:18,821 --> 02:51:22,390
learning sort of the,
the do's and don'ts,

2900
02:51:22,450 --> 02:51:25,510
the etiquette that's involved and
communicating with people online.

2901
02:51:25,511 --> 02:51:28,150
And I think the,
the more intelligent,

2902
02:51:28,151 --> 02:51:31,780
rational people are realizing we should
communicate with people online the way

2903
02:51:31,781 --> 02:51:33,970
you should communicate with them if
they were right there in front of you.

2904
02:51:34,420 --> 02:51:36,490
And if we start doing that.

2905
02:51:36,491 --> 02:51:39,970
And I also think that this technology
that we're experiencing right now is

2906
02:51:39,971 --> 02:51:44,971
really the beginning of some sort of a
much more invasive interfacing between

2907
02:51:45,551 --> 02:51:50,230
human beings. Invasive, it
should say instead of invasive,

2908
02:51:50,290 --> 02:51:52,450
uh,
it'd be much more comprehensive.

2909
02:51:52,480 --> 02:51:55,780
I think we're going to get some sort of
a visual interaction with each other and

2910
02:51:55,781 --> 02:51:59,860
maybe even some sort of a sharing of
data where it's not even based on reading

2911
02:51:59,861 --> 02:52:02,890
things, but you're actually going to be
able to transmit thoughts to each other.

2912
02:52:03,250 --> 02:52:07,030
They've already figured out a way to
transmit minds and there could be merging

2913
02:52:07,031 --> 02:52:09,650
it. Oh my goodness, what are we
going to have? And I wish I could,

2914
02:52:09,910 --> 02:52:13,340
I would like to live to be 500 or a
thousand just to see what happens.

2915
02:52:13,341 --> 02:52:16,420
You might live to be 500 when you
look at what science is doing today,

2916
02:52:16,421 --> 02:52:20,740
I think I'll be, I think I'm just
going to make that darn well.

2917
02:52:20,741 --> 02:52:23,350
If you do miss it, I think
what you're doing, like I said,

2918
02:52:23,351 --> 02:52:26,440
it's very important and you think you're
opening up a lot of people's eyes and

2919
02:52:26,710 --> 02:52:27,580
you're also,

2920
02:52:27,910 --> 02:52:32,290
you're a great spokesperson for it because
you're balanced and rational and it's

2921
02:52:32,291 --> 02:52:35,170
easy to accept your nice person.
So what you're saying.

2922
02:52:35,330 --> 02:52:38,470
So coming from your point of view,
it's like, I don't know, one,

2923
02:52:38,500 --> 02:52:41,110
you're not grading on people.
It's, it's nice. It's beautiful.

2924
02:52:41,230 --> 02:52:42,160
So I want to thank you.

2925
02:52:42,161 --> 02:52:44,200
Thank you very much for your series
and thank you for doing this.

2926
02:52:44,201 --> 02:52:46,630
And if you ever have anything you need
promoted, please just let us know.

2927
02:52:46,631 --> 02:52:48,610
I'll be happy to, happy to get
it out there for you. Okay,

2928
02:52:49,120 --> 02:52:51,940
Christina Summer's ladies and
gentlemen, that's it. Show's over.

2929
02:52:52,020 --> 02:52:53,270
Goodnight.
Bye for the kiss.

2930
02:53:06,100 --> 02:53:06,260
Hmm.
