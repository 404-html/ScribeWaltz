1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,990
[inaudible] were fucking live.
I was just about to take a sip of coffee,

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,710
but this shit is way more important.
We're here with Jim Florentine, hilarious,

3
00:00:07,711 --> 00:00:11,700
standup comedian and Trans Racial Pioneer.
You were doing that.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,090
You were pushing the Trans Racial movement
like about two or three decades ago,

5
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:18,610
right? I was, you know, and um, you
know, it was living with Jim Norton is,

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,650
I've seen a lot. That video,
there's a video of you guys.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,390
Was it you two living together where you
had the fucking black mold? Oh my God.

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,390
When you move the picture and
you see the mold of the wall,

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,650
people fucking die from that shit. Like
the amount of mold you guys had. I know.

10
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:36,210
I had it in my bedroom and I would just,

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,570
I put tinfoil on the walls to
cover it around by the bed.

12
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:41,310
It was all the way up coming up,
crawling up the walls.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,030
I just put tinfoil on mine. It should
be fine. It's so fucking crazy.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,990
Who made that video?

15
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,120
It was somebody from Oni show
came over and did the cribs. God.

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,930
He like, people get really sick from
that shit. Right. I know. I don't know.

17
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,380
Understand how we didn't get sick
cause we had it for like a year.

18
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:02,850
We're paying $800 for three for three
bedroom right outside of New York City and

19
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:04,620
the Jersey side and
splitting it three ways.

20
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,360
I had a girl if I'm
living me at the time too,

21
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:11,160
so we were paying like two 66 a
month. Wow. That's pretty sweet.

22
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,740
And we weren't making any money so we
figured we'll move right next to New York

23
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:16,020
City and here's the video
it's going on behind you.

24
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,410
Did you test it and see if he
had anything from living there?

25
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,300
Well fuck now Tom,
like he's had a evacuated,

26
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:27,290
his whole house Tom like is they
had a terrace walls down. They,

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,420
they have to like,
I guess they treat the mold to kill it.

28
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,350
They got a tear all your walls down and
they get to do these like tests of the

29
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:38,730
air to make sure there's not spores
that are flying around in the air.

30
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:43,260
I mean it's a real infestation.
It's fucked. I know we didn't,

31
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,620
we didn't even do like a mold.

32
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,390
We didn't even look it up to
find out if it was toxic. It's a,

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,240
I'm pretty sure it's not good.
Like this is sick.

34
00:01:51,241 --> 00:01:54,630
It's like it's dripping down
the side of this painting now.

35
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:56,960
They moved this painting.
It was,

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,090
we went to a garage sale around the
corner to buy more paintings just to cover

37
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:03,670
up the mold that's got can now.

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,850
Oh, it's super bad for you. That's
absolutely soup. You know what?

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:11,280
My Damn Marino Jersey and hang it up,

40
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,020
but you got to think that just
the sheer air that's in that room,

41
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,880
that'd be filled with spores and shit.
Right. I think that's very, very poisoned.

42
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,240
It's like you probably have some
kind of fucked up shit from that. No,

43
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:25,740
I bet he's fine now.
You don't,

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,840
but I bet back then you're
probably suffering from
just a lot of stress on your

45
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:35,080
lungs. What am I a doctor? Was Your
Voice Really High Pitch? Was it like,

46
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,710
know he's been like this? Yeah, it's
always had the voice that didn't work,

47
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,410
but when you're fucking young
and poor and you're a comic,

48
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,650
that is the way to go to 66 a month.
Huh?

49
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:51,660
The lower your bills are like for
comics it's like the whole thing in the

50
00:02:51,661 --> 00:02:54,360
beginning is you got to get through the
spot where you don't make any money,

51
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,060
figure out how to do it and
then it start making money.

52
00:02:57,061 --> 00:03:00,970
Start getting road gigs and start.
But area where you just like,

53
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:05,020
it's so important to fucking save as
much money as possible. Yeah, we were,

54
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,480
we were living like an hour
south of the city in Jersey.

55
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,940
Me and no art and then we figured we
needed to get close because we've gone in

56
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,070
there like four or five nights
a week trying to get into clubs.

57
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,050
I moved in with it.
I didn't even like this girl.

58
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,590
I just wanted to pay a third at a rent.
I really didn't even like her that much.

59
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:20,680
I'm like, look, we can cut this
in threes. That's hilarious.

60
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:25,660
Look at Jim off fresh faced like
cause I will add like a little boy.

61
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:28,300
Oh your bathroom g suite.
Merciful Christ.

62
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,100
I had a shit hole of an
apartment in new Rochelle. Ooh.

63
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,080
It's actually could have been a lot worse.

64
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,290
This is like just mostly families
and shit in the neighborhood,

65
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,590
but that was the same thing as the
cheapest place that I could get that had a

66
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:44,450
place to park cause I had
to do a lot of road gigs. I,

67
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:46,840
I did city gigs like in in New York City,

68
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:49,360
but at a certain point in time I was like,
fuck man,

69
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:51,670
he sits are only like 10 15 minutes long.

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,220
You've got to travel all over to do
them and they don't pay any money.

71
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,550
I could just go to Connecticut and
make 150 bucks tonight. You know,

72
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:01,360
I could go to long island and make
150 bucks. I think that's real money.

73
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,950
I think that's when I first met you is
Bob Levy and his wife had all these like

74
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:09,270
eggs, these one nighters that pay
like 150 bucks, 200 his wife was hot.

75
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,660
God Good Lord was insane. She was one
of those like what happened there?

76
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,290
Relationships. First of all, Bob
is hilarious. Chicks love like,

77
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,310
he's so funny. Like if you
ever hung around with Bob
Levy, do you know Bob Leave?

78
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:26,020
You know, haven't hung out with this
fucking hilarious. That dude's hilarious.

79
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:29,340
He was at a, I watched um, uh,

80
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,440
Artie Lange headline in Vegas ones at
the Luxor is me and Joey and Eddie Bravo

81
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:38,180
went cause we were there
for the UFC and um,

82
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,290
he went up and he was doing some shit
where he was having girls eat his asshole.

83
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,680
They put blue cheese on his ass and he
was describing why he couldn't do that

84
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:50,950
anymore because of lawsuits or whatever.

85
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,300
But he would put blue cheese and girls
asses and eat it on stage right on stage

86
00:04:55,301 --> 00:05:00,180
right out of her ass. Wouldn't
do it. But I don't know.

87
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,900
He was a famous comedian.

88
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,950
I mean Bob believe he's like a nationally
known comedian and he's doing these

89
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:10,600
girls from the audience, from the audit
guys. White guy would go with his wife,

90
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,700
go up there, come on and let him
eat blue cheese out of your ass.

91
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,990
What's the big deal? I'm like,
it's so crazy. It's so crazy,

92
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,460
but he's just a funny fuck.

93
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,740
Like people were heckling him
and he was just torturing them.

94
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,550
Bob's been around forever.
He's, he's an old pace.

95
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:27,070
One of the best night club comics
out there. Oh, pro old pills.

96
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:28,510
Every time knows how to do it.

97
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,080
He's just a funny guys just been
around and he's a good dude too.

98
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,880
But God damn did he have a hot wife?
I'll believe them. She still hot.

99
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,070
I should came to my Cheryl. I'm
sure she hears still hot. Crushing.

100
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,550
It was insane how hot she was. Like
Bob, there's no, you don't deserve that.

101
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:46,390
Has that happened in California? Would
kind of make sense if Bob was on a sitcom.

102
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:49,090
If I was on a Sitcom and
she lived in California,

103
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,370
like girls like her I think
are more common in California,

104
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:55,630
but in Jersey she fucking Christ like
they didn't even have the name of a number

105
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:57,980
for that.
She wasn't even a 10 he had to like,

106
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,001
you gotta go like,

107
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:03,350
it's like a 10 plus executive class 10
and she hung in there for like three

108
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:07,070
years and then she just couldn't
take it out. They were booking gigs.

109
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,570
I did a bunch of their gigs. Yeah.
That's when I originally met Yo.

110
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:12,230
Cause he'd do a bunch of one
night or such a good dude. Yeah.

111
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,160
Always been a good dude. Funny, crazy
fuck would. Yeah, he would. But,

112
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:16,940
and you don't want,
he's had,

113
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,420
he had to stop being blue cheese at a
girl's acids can because he was going

114
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:24,600
through a divorce and his ex wife,
the second wife,

115
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,570
the lawyers will use in the footage on
youtube against him in court to tell the

116
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:32,840
audience, look, I gotta stop eating blue
jeans. And they would bow. He goes, look,

117
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:36,940
their shits on Youtube. I'm trying
to get custody of my son. Oh my God.

118
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,470
It's just like specific dressing.
What about thousand dollars?

119
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,310
No blue cheese and nothing like book.
This girl is there.

120
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:50,810
He puts blue cheese on her ass and he
eats it onstage. What a lucky guy. Oh,

121
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:54,020
he's a savage and he holds on to,
he doesn't let go. Let go. Hold on.

122
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:58,430
I know they're trying to
run away and he's, he's a
fucking savage. He's a savage.

123
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,690
He's the get that girl's
ass hoe. Jesus Christ. Wow.

124
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,280
Blue Cheese in Wildwood.

125
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,960
I mean it's kind of like a
cultural legend thing. You know?

126
00:07:08,961 --> 00:07:12,470
Like when, when I, by the way, when
I first heard that he was doing,

127
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,110
it wasn't even remotely remotely
surprised. I was like, oh,

128
00:07:15,111 --> 00:07:18,860
Bob believes he's doing that all
right. Yeah, it's fucking crazy.

129
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:22,670
They'd tell it like if somebody told
me that Greg Fitzsimmons started eating

130
00:07:22,671 --> 00:07:24,770
blue cheese at a girl's
acids, I'd be like, Whoa,

131
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,130
what the fuck happened at Greg
Greg One south. He went crazy.

132
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,990
Briggs gone crazy. But when,
when I heard it was Bob Levy,

133
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:35,330
it was like totally acceptable.
Like if you know him,

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,030
like something like that's click
completely acceptable. Like, Oh yeah,

135
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:40,670
that's probably what he does.
I'm the first time he did it,

136
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:44,000
we would just get got cancels who were
just hanging out like holiday inn in the,

137
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:45,950
in the room where the comedy
is supposed to be in some,

138
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,040
some girl was there and we were drinking
with her and we somehow we got her to

139
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,000
go, hey, we'll get,

140
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:53,720
we'll get mushed it up like $37 if he
can eat blue cheese out of your ass,

141
00:07:53,721 --> 00:07:57,230
cause wheat and wings. And Bob said, I
want to just blue cheese out of your ass.

142
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,420
And I go, how much would you do
it? She goes, I don't know what,

143
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,040
I've got 37 she goes,
okay fine.

144
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,200
And he blokes are just in front of
like four people and maybe he's like,

145
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:06,290
I got to close with that.
I

146
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,610
got it right. I go, got worked
at, please join US friends.

147
00:08:10,611 --> 00:08:13,460
I don't know if that's going to
work on stage. Oh my God. I kind of,

148
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:16,160
well kind of a fucking animal.

149
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,880
What kind of fucking animal offers?

150
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:26,810
He drilled $37 to eat blue cheese that
her ass. And then after he's, as it says,

151
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,160
I got to close with that.

152
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,060
Oh my God,
I'm fucking crying.

153
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:39,460
Those are the beautiful people that
you meet in standup comedy. You know,

154
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,980
this is the only meet those people
in stand up comedy. You just don't,

155
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,710
they don't exist in other professions or
like extreme Elvis. I've met that guy.

156
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:50,650
If he this crazy, his show was amazing.
I don't think he does that anymore. Yeah,

157
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,220
I don't think he does. It was a
fucking amazing show. Extreme Elvis is,

158
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:55,800
this guy's an Elvis impersonator

159
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,580
and he takes his clothes off and he
pisses in this girl's mouth. It's like,

160
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:04,230
it's fucking crazy. He gets totally naked.
Yeah. And they're really good musicians.

161
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,970
Like Penn Jillette to
pendula tell them about me,

162
00:09:06,971 --> 00:09:09,120
but I don't know who told who about doubt.

163
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:14,130
But he and I talked and he wound up
hiring the guy to do like a party at his

164
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:17,970
house and pens like strict and
like no drugs, no this, no that.

165
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,650
So you had to do it sober cause extreme
Elvis would do all shows completely

166
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:27,030
fucked up. Like drink a gallon
of fucking whiskey on states.

167
00:09:27,031 --> 00:09:31,920
That's him right there. Holy Shit. Yeah
Dude. I mean you ain't seen nothing yet.

168
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,540
There was,
I wrote a whole blog about it.

169
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,870
I wrote a whole blog
about it a long time ago.

170
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:41,760
Like way back in 2003 because he was
amazing. This show was amazing. He Ha,

171
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,540
he goes, who owns showing
through change purse? This girl,

172
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,450
the girl next to him goes, hi, do
I do, he just pisses in her mouth.

173
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,300
She's lying there. She's
topless. She's hot by the way.

174
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:55,470
And she's talented and she can play,
you know, I forget what, what she did,

175
00:09:55,471 --> 00:09:58,140
whether she sang or she played guitar,
I forget when instrument,

176
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:00,390
but I remember overall
was a very good shot.

177
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,410
They're very talented on top
of the fact it was insane.

178
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:08,411
You'd be pissing in this girl's mouth
and some guy like in from the audience,

179
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,430
like someone or was a girl.

180
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Some girl tried to stick
like a beer bottle up his
ass cause he gets cut totally

181
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:18,480
naked.

182
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,440
So some girl comes up behind him and it
started sticking this beer bottle up his

183
00:10:22,441 --> 00:10:27,441
ass and he grabs her hand and starts
putting it the right in the right hole and

184
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:29,220
then she panics and she runs away.

185
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,630
Like he was helping her shoved
this beer bottle up his ass. Holy.

186
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,170
You don't want to do that. It's just
like fuck this and the girl just leaves.

187
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,670
But it is, it was a fucking crazy
show. Just see what Jamie just put up.

188
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,160
It was a pool cue. Uh, I'm not surprised,

189
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,130
but I'm also not surprised
that he doesn't do it anymore.

190
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,090
If he was doing these kinds of things on
a regular basis because that's fucking

191
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:52,200
dangerous or your asshole.

192
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,680
You can't just have random
strangers stick stuff up your ass.

193
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:59,850
They won't be so kind. Yeah. That
sounds like GG Allen. What did you just,

194
00:10:59,851 --> 00:11:02,670
she would just take a shit on stage is
just throwing up the audience before it.

195
00:11:02,671 --> 00:11:06,540
If the first song, I'm telling you
though, this dude is really good.

196
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,410
Like as a musician, he was
really fucking good. That's it.

197
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,300
That was the craziest
thing about the show.

198
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,860
It was not just that it was this freak
show. He's doing the freak show thing,

199
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,150
but he's a fucking talented musician.
Like he does a wicked Elvis,

200
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,960
like he's doing suspicious minds and
the whole audience was singing along.

201
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:28,070
We're caught in a trap to that,
to the two.

202
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,440
I can't walk out well like the whole
crowd was going because I love you too.

203
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,400
And these guys get,
he's got his dick out.

204
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,710
He's fucking naked on stage is pissed
and a girl's mouth and they're singing

205
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:44,340
suspicious minds.
I mean it's a fucking show,

206
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:48,090
not a girl that he pissed at her mouth
as she ended a band and she's good.

207
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,120
I forget what she did. Fuck,
I wish I could remember,

208
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,380
cause it was like 12 years ago.
We saw it in like 2003

209
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,690
so every night he would piss in her mouth.

210
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:58,930
I don't know how many times they did
shows, but I talked to him briefly.

211
00:11:58,931 --> 00:11:59,740
He was telling him,

212
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,460
telling me all these different times he's
been arrested at all different times.

213
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:06,130
They wouldn't give his money
because a lot of times the clubs,

214
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:07,690
they don't know what the
fuck he's going to do.

215
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,830
And then also this guy's getting tick out.
He's pissing girl's mouths and shit.

216
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:14,050
I don't think they understand the show.

217
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:16,810
I just really don't think they
understand what they're signing up for.

218
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:20,410
So these like rock venues would have him
come in there and then they get fucking

219
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:21,760
mad.
I don't even want to beat him up.

220
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,050
I'm didn't hire him at the
end of the night. Shit,

221
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,080
I gotta find out this guy's still
around. I want to see the show. I hope.

222
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,860
I hope he is. I hope, but I hope
he takes better care of himself.

223
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,430
Like you can't, you can't just drink a
bottle of whiskey every night and do this.

224
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:39,820
It's just I can't, I don't, can't imagine
how he could do this show all the time.

225
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,420
This is a fucking super
dangerous show for your body.

226
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,990
He's got a bunch of chickens picking.
He's lying down.

227
00:12:46,991 --> 00:12:51,490
They're tied up and they put green all
over his cock and he's got a bunch of

228
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,820
chickens that they put on top of the
sheet and they're pecking at the grain.

229
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:58,540
It's right over his dick. This is so
fucking bizarre. Is that guy over there?

230
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,400
Exactly. Exactly. Who's that guy?
Oh Shit. He's out of his mind.

231
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,360
It's like Ari Schick fear.
Last time I saw him it was a,

232
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:12,410
I was going into the um, Paul
Provenza greenroom showed
you ever do that show? No.

233
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,850
I know we talked about but didn't get a
chance to ask him what or not he's doing

234
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:19,900
it again.
Fuck that guy was good though.

235
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:22,630
Here's at the comedy store.
I probably like two years ago,

236
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,900
any of him singing because what's that?

237
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:28,420
We'll see if you can find one word.

238
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:32,260
There's actual singing because the
crazy thing is that he's really fucking

239
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,150
really talented. It was a
great show though. It was
very few shows where you go,

240
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,190
fuck yeah, absolutely.
Out of there and you go,

241
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:42,820
I just guess I saw the king pissing this
chick's mouth and then have the whole

242
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:46,660
audience singing along to a song.
It was awesome. That's great.

243
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,710
Is there anything like that right
now that's, that's big. That's,

244
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,790
it's hard to do something like that.

245
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:55,750
It's could because you know this
was 2003 so the Internet was around.

246
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,390
It wasn't around like as around
now it's not the same thing.

247
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,670
Like you would go to jail.
You're not allowed to do that.

248
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,910
You can't just pull your
dick out and insurance and
everything. Yeah. Everything.

249
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,100
Yeah. No one's going to take
a chance anymore. By the way.

250
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,460
What the fuck is wrong with the world
where a guy can't piss in the girl's mouth

251
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:13,600
on stage like that? You can't prove to
me that the sound art because it is art.

252
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,170
Okay. If you can make a
show that's that fucked up.

253
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:20,800
You got a guy who's Elvis.
He's, he sings really good.

254
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:24,010
He's kind of fucking talented band
with them. Oh, one of his band members,

255
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:25,870
she takes off her clothes,
her tits, her out,

256
00:14:25,871 --> 00:14:28,480
and he pisses in her mouth and
it's Dick's about that pig.

257
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,430
It's the whole thing is ridiculous
because it is a goddamn ridiculous show.

258
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,140
And the piston in her mouth make the
show better, like as an artistic piece.

259
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,760
Absolutely. For real because it was
just more surreal and more fucked up.

260
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,790
But how is that an illegal Goddamn
Communists, Jim Florentine?

261
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:52,250
I don't understand that. Hey, he'd
have to do like backyard shows

262
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,830
that this point.
This

263
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:03,660
what year is this?
2010

264
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,120
is that what it's headed?
Well,

265
00:15:09,121 --> 00:15:10,620
there was a lot of this at the shows too.

266
00:15:10,621 --> 00:15:13,890
A lot of fucking screaming
and people couldn't believe.

267
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,923
What is he doing?

268
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,430
I used to have an extreme Elvis tee shirt.

269
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,070
I think I lost it somewhere. I think
I left it in a hotel room somewhere.

270
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,390
Hate fucker. Hate that. Ex
girlfriends taking your shirts.

271
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:55,490
Tell rooms because Elvis baby thickness.
He's doing that song.

272
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:56,930
Black Sabbath by black Sabbath.

273
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,273
Yeah,

274
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,340
Elvis don't Jose.
It's beautiful.

275
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,950
Think I think

276
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,910
the folks at home get the point,
but go check him out if he's still there.

277
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,420
I kind of around any mortar lead
singer died about a year ago.

278
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:22,690
They're going to great stage show.
Was it like that? Just shoot.

279
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,900
She is on the crowd and
stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah.

280
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,610
There was a lot of special effects,
like things coming out of chest and stuff.

281
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,550
There was a girl in the band.

282
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:33,990
She gave birth to a baby and the baby
came out and they put it right in the wood

283
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:37,750
chipper and the blog on all over the
audience. I was like 23 years old.

284
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:40,400
I'm like to stick right as thing that
I've ever seen in my life. I wish.

285
00:16:40,401 --> 00:16:43,630
That's one thing I wish I got to see.
I never got to see a guar concert.

286
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:48,020
Oh my God. They threw a fake
baby, came right out of our gate.

287
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:52,900
I think you're still doing shows
with all the members and stuff,

288
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:56,470
but gray band always, always went to
see it. I'm like, oh my God. How did,

289
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,480
how did they not go to jail for that?

290
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,580
How did they not get like
there was some protest,

291
00:17:01,581 --> 00:17:04,150
some family advocacy group or anything?
I mean,

292
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,100
I would think that someone would protest.

293
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:10,090
You put a fake baby in a woods shepherd
as a part of your act. They would do it,

294
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:11,830
whatever president.
They would cut his head off.

295
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,130
That was whoever was president at the
time. They cut his head off on stage.

296
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,460
You can still do that though.
Kenyon. Yeah, they still do.

297
00:17:17,461 --> 00:17:19,720
It was to just do it with doing it up.
I saw him two years ago.

298
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:22,960
They were doing with Obama. Just
head off. Yeah. Jesus Christ.

299
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,950
I would think that the secret service who
come get you if you did some shit like

300
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:29,410
that. Yeah. That's why I like rules.

301
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,140
I thought you weren't even allowed to
say like, I want to kill the president.

302
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,180
He didn't let me finish.
I've John the juice.

303
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,230
You're never something like that is why
I would always say something at the end.

304
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:44,920
Why not what George Bush did it for
Bush circuit city. Look at this.

305
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,970
Look at the outfit. This fucking
guy's got on. Does he have a fake?

306
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,273
Is that what I saw?

307
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:55,100
Got a giant fake ticket. I'm going
to fuck them. It's a fist. Oh,

308
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,550
what is his dick? What
does, oh my God, yes.

309
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:02,640
In the plugs in the courts right now.
Right off. And it squirts in the crowd.

310
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,800
Oh my God,
this is so ridiculous.

311
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,330
It's kind of like for something for
kids when you go to like Disneyland or

312
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:11,910
Universal Studios, like one of
those shows, but for adults,

313
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,900
do you think they know about this?
Oh,

314
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,580
you showed a deal cause they were doing
President Bush when he was in office.

315
00:18:18,581 --> 00:18:19,950
So whoever,
whatever president is.

316
00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:24,250
So she seems like you could go
to jail for this, doesn't it?

317
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,400
It kind of falls into cheesy horror movie
kind of category. I'll blow for sure.

318
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,340
But I mean it brings up, it brings up
an interesting conversation about, um,

319
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:37,390
making fun of things and
what you shouldn't, shouldn't
be able to make fun of.

320
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,120
Cause that Charlie Hebdo
thing that happened, you know,
that's uh, you, you know,

321
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,160
you don't know what that is in France,

322
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,940
the people that ran this magazine has
this magazine that did a lot of satire

323
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:52,620
drawings of Muhammad and, and
these dudes showed up, um, and,

324
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,280
and fucking gun them all
down. Killed everybody. Right?
And they killed the dude's.

325
00:18:56,281 --> 00:19:00,150
They had a man hunt for him and
he's to a radical Muslim dudes.

326
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:05,910
But um, that was just, you know, drawing,
drawing pictures, which everybody's like,

327
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,400
oh, well that's fucked up. You
can't do that. You just can't do,

328
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,740
you can't kill people for drawn a picture.

329
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,130
But we do have certain things
you're not allowed to do. Like you,

330
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:16,740
you literally can't say,

331
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:21,390
I want to kill Mr President.
You can't say that.

332
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,910
He couldn't say his name if you
said that, if you said, I want to,

333
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:27,240
I want to kill that guy, I want to kill
the president. Like that's illegal,

334
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:29,790
like you think would literally
lock you up for that.

335
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,380
Which is weird because he's like, you
know, that's a kind of a figure of speech.

336
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,950
You know, like people say that all
the time, oh, I want to kill that guy.

337
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,410
Fucking hate him.
I mean like you,

338
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,690
you like if there's a guy in
a movie that sucks like these,

339
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,180
like you don't like him as
an actor, you might say, oh,

340
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:48,630
I want to kill that fucking guy. You
don't mean it. Right. But is that illegal?

341
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,970
Like if you say that like the president
has some stupid thing that he vetoes or

342
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,570
something that people don't agree with.

343
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,990
If you said that it's a common figure of
speech was you said that and he did it

344
00:19:57,991 --> 00:20:00,270
publicly,
they can fucking take you in.

345
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,970
You had a secret service
at your house the next day.

346
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:05,560
Ted Nugent said something a
couple of years ago about Obama,

347
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,160
not say I want to kill him,
but he said something,

348
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,240
I forget what the quote was in the secret
service was at his house the next day.

349
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:15,340
I think he was saying something
to the like, he's just like,

350
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,440
if Obama gets arrested, he
might wind up in jail. Yeah,

351
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,790
we're all gonna be dead and in
jail or something like that.

352
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:23,160
So it wasn't even a direct,
not the president.

353
00:20:23,161 --> 00:20:25,560
I think he was saying that
like he might wind up in jail,

354
00:20:25,561 --> 00:20:29,300
that Nugent might wind up in jail.
Something like that crying, you know,

355
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:34,230
it could be seen as implying that he would
do something cause he, but it's weird,

356
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,750
you know to do, I'm just going
to kill the president and stop,

357
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,400
you know he's doing a hunting show,
likes playing guitar.

358
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,040
It's not going to kill the president.
And then Ted Horse,

359
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,340
he's like with the secret service can,
they are fans of mine.

360
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:49,180
And I put like little concert with,
I gave him all my,

361
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,170
my latest CD is that I was going to take
him out back and the shooting range,

362
00:20:53,171 --> 00:20:54,010
but they didn't want to do it.

363
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:59,110
Have you ever seen him in the helicopters
shooting pigs? No. You gotta see it.

364
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,960
You gotta see it. It's one of the
greatest things the world has ever known.

365
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Ted Nugent in a helicopter shooting wild
pigs with a machine gun just tucked on

366
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:08,430
punk picked up on,

367
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,240
it's the fucking craziest thing flying
around in Texas in a fucking helicopter.

368
00:21:14,561 --> 00:21:16,890
Him and his dude,
they call him pig man.

369
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:21,250
So pig man and Ted Nugent and they're
circling around these giant packs of pigs

370
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:26,080
and just lighten them up. It's
fucked up. And was he it? Yeah,

371
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:27,670
he'll play it. I love new. Is this it?

372
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,190
This is just talking
about the devastation.

373
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,660
There's like a whole graphic before the
video that shows this Devin what these

374
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:41,860
wild pigs do in Texas because they are
absolutely devastating to the farms down

375
00:21:41,861 --> 00:21:43,990
there. They're not out of
control. There's so many of them,

376
00:21:43,991 --> 00:21:48,700
millions of wild pigs in Texas alone.
I mean it's a fucking infestation.

377
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,400
But like as you see when you're
circling over in the helicopter,

378
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:53,620
you're talking about a huge area.

379
00:21:53,621 --> 00:21:57,700
I mean Texas has goddamn an enormous
and these things are impossible to

380
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:59,920
eradicate cause they're smart.

381
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,950
So once they get together and they're
fucking shooting these things out of

382
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:07,930
helicopters and it's fucking madness.

383
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:10,600
You can shoot as many as you want all
day long and you shoot them at night.

384
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,400
There's no rules. You just
shoot him. I mean it's like,
look at this. This is crazy.

385
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,650
Awful.
It's awful.

386
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,470
Well wouldn't be awful if you were hungry
and you wanted a pig or if it was your

387
00:22:23,471 --> 00:22:28,360
farm. The problem is if it's your farm,
like fuck man, like what is a farm?

388
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:33,340
Then, you know, I, if they
become a threat to people,

389
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:36,760
that's one thing, but it is
really weird that you could just,

390
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:41,430
just because their cost, they cost money.
Like they're chewing up people's food,

391
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,680
but their animals, you know, like
that's what they kind of do. Yeah.

392
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,300
It's like they have to manage them,

393
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,450
but you have to figure out a
way to manage the population.

394
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:55,270
But it seems like they can't, it seems
like there's just too many of them.

395
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,240
They just have to kill him. But doing
it that way just seems kind of fucked.

396
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,270
It's like, it seems that we can put him
to sleep in [inaudible] bed or something.

397
00:23:04,271 --> 00:23:09,050
Like make it to the latest thing where
we bless these pigs instead of shooting

398
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:13,130
them with a machine gun out of a
helicopter. It's just, you know, no,

399
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:18,610
I don't know.
I mean look at cats and dogs.

400
00:23:18,611 --> 00:23:22,600
Like we, we put cats and dogs to sleep
or we try to do something for them,

401
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:26,560
but like, like animals that we need to
get over that we're overpopulated with,

402
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,590
you know, we shouldn't be really allowed
to heal. Just like, I don't know,

403
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,040
torture or shoot with machine
gun out of a helicopter.

404
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:36,430
I think they're just doing it because
it's one of the only ways it's effective I

405
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:38,560
think on the ground.
You can't get to them.

406
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,920
Doing it from a helicopter is like one
of the best ways to do it because they're

407
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,980
too smart. If you're on the ground,
you try to get near him. They run away,

408
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:45,980
they smelled

409
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,140
things,
they hear things they don't see very good,

410
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:52,610
but they can hear very well and
they smell anything. They just bolt.

411
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:53,690
What about poisoning?

412
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,690
It can poison them cause then you
poison a bunch of other shit too and you

413
00:23:56,691 --> 00:23:59,300
poison the environment and you poisoned
the things that eat the things he

414
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:02,720
poisoned. If you poison a pig and the
pig gets eaten by a mountain lion,

415
00:24:02,721 --> 00:24:04,070
a mountain lion gets poisoned too.

416
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,240
And the mountain lion could dive
from the same disease or the same um,

417
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,440
poison that you can't have that pig meat.
Either pygmy goes bad.

418
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,360
They just kind of figured out a
way to keep them from, you know,

419
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,340
that's one of the best
ways it's fucked up.

420
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:21,650
But it's one of the best ways to kill him.
So those helicopter things,

421
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,920
cause they could do it and they can get
a hundred of them, 200 of them in a day.

422
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,600
They got 450 in one day on that pig
man show. Pigs are so smart though.

423
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:34,430
It sucks. I don't like when smarter,
you know, I hear you. It's fuck yeah,

424
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:37,550
you're right. You're right.
There's, they're smart.

425
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:42,680
But there is such a big difference
between smart animals and smart people.

426
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,490
There's a giant fucking difference.
And I wonder what the,

427
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:50,480
the variable of like being wild is.
Cause like pigs,

428
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,070
if you're around pigs and they're,
um, they're a domesticated,

429
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:55,790
they're sweet.

430
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,580
They're really sweet little animals
to come over and hang with you.

431
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:02,030
They're pretty cool but are domesticated.
So it means their experiences,

432
00:25:02,031 --> 00:25:03,560
none of their experience
has been devastating.

433
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,390
They haven't seen their mother getting
killed by a wild mountain lion or

434
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:10,850
something like that. They haven't seen
their brother getting eaten by a bear.

435
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,070
You know, they're, they're
not living in the wild,

436
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:14,720
just running away from shit all the time.

437
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Like a wild pig is they're constantly
fed and taken care of so they have like,

438
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:24,890
it's sorta like people, you know, people,
if you leave people in a wild state,

439
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,630
like people,
even to this day,

440
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,440
there's places in the world where people
live a far scarier life than we could

441
00:25:30,441 --> 00:25:31,310
ever imagine.

442
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,750
Like every day you're dealing with
violence and chaos and danger.

443
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:40,790
Those people are, there couldn't
be a wilder style of human being.

444
00:25:40,791 --> 00:25:44,420
Then we are, you know, and I think
that's what's going on with these pigs.

445
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,080
It's like it's kind of fucked that
you can eat something that also,

446
00:25:48,081 --> 00:25:49,910
if the circumstances were better,

447
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,790
it could be your buddy kind of had on
that pig and it would be awesome. Yeah.

448
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:59,830
Years, there's, there's
definitely something to that
because it's all about their,

449
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,920
their experiences. If they're growing
up in a cage and you just, I mean,

450
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:07,400
we don't even understand their behavior
because the behavior that we have of

451
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:11,750
pigs is almost all of it is behavior of
things that are locked up. You know, the,

452
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:15,410
the actual wild behavior of him, they're
super hard to watch. You've got to,

453
00:26:15,411 --> 00:26:16,700
it's hard to get close to them.

454
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,180
You know if tried tagging them and
releasing them and all that a fucking

455
00:26:20,181 --> 00:26:22,700
nightmare.
They're clever fuckers.

456
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,520
It's almost like it could take a shitload
of pigs and put it in some kind of

457
00:26:25,521 --> 00:26:29,900
like spinning like a windmill type things
and that we can make them ahead make

458
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,980
energy for us and instead or
something like that. Right,

459
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,840
like give him food in a giant hamster
wheel and as they go and chase after the

460
00:26:35,841 --> 00:26:38,180
food. Yeah, but you
have to make that food.

461
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,660
It's like it takes energy to make the
food that's going to give them energy.

462
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,830
Like logically it wouldn't make sense

463
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,410
unless you have like a super good,

464
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,650
very efficient system or like each spin
was worth like hundreds of kilowatts and

465
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:52,450
right.

466
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:57,130
The windmill was like five miles long and
it's just rows and rows of pigs to it.

467
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,920
How much food would you
have to give those fucks?

468
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,370
You don't have to give him anything
but be fake food and then they die,

469
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:05,940
smelled good,
cut them up and let them eat their food.

470
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,990
I thought about this at all.

471
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,370
They eat the row in front of them and
they're done in by row each roads like a

472
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:14,100
week, so they die in the ones in
front of fuck, eat, shut the fuck up.

473
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,450
You know,
they say that's one of the best,

474
00:27:19,451 --> 00:27:22,510
like that movie snatch that they'd say
that really is one of the best ways to

475
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:26,620
get rid of a body man.
Some guy who was a pig farmer in,

476
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:29,920
I think it was British Columbia was also
a serial killer and he would throw the

477
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:34,750
bodies into the pig sty and the pigs
would just destroy them, eat everything.

478
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,570
They eat, everything. It's shit
out the teeth. That's about it.

479
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,890
Everything else gets done. They chew
through the bones, everything. Wow. Yeah,

480
00:27:41,891 --> 00:27:43,660
they're monsters.
It's crazy.

481
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,340
This girl I met recently,

482
00:27:45,341 --> 00:27:49,800
she collects teeth and like all
the teeth I know on the teeth,

483
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,340
all the teeth have a story like this is
my friend Jeff's tooth or this is the

484
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:56,740
girl's tooth that I met
on a subway or whatever,

485
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,340
and she says she likes to throw them
in her bed and sleep with it. The tea.

486
00:28:00,341 --> 00:28:03,160
So when she wakes up, but it looks
like teeth marks all over her body.

487
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,170
Let me open your mouth if you're
missing any Christ. And uh,

488
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,220
when do you guys getting married

489
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:15,730
and yet you still got your wisdom
teeth? Yeah, I know I got rid of, well,

490
00:28:15,731 --> 00:28:18,290
I've got it right. Yeah. Cause she'd be
like, do some we got them out and write.

491
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:21,750
There's always gonna be someone new out
there that just surprises you even why

492
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,820
thank you. Got It all figured out. She
hot at least. Oh, she's super high. Uh,

493
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,630
and she has all these other scholars.
Like she has monkeys scores, cat scholars.

494
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,120
Like her whole house has a skulls and
then she has jars. It's so healthy.

495
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,600
And one of the chief had like,
it was like a fresh one.

496
00:28:37,601 --> 00:28:40,360
Like I had some meat on it or something.
It's gross.

497
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:42,700
A smile paid a dude on
craigslist to pull it.

498
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:46,630
Did she have two feet on his shoulders?
Fucking pair of pliers.

499
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,020
Fucking periscope chicks are
crazy screaming. You haven't
hooked up with her? No,

500
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:55,600
no, no. I'm not going to
freak me out. Good for you.

501
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,730
So how about this idea of standards?

502
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:00,420
Naacp lady from Spokane,

503
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:03,510
Washington to pretended to be black.

504
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:06,970
This is not real life. This is like
simulation theory and somebody hacked it.

505
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,040
Just playing a joke on this.

506
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,340
It's a fucking good question. Her parents
out or apparently, did you look at her,

507
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,840
look in her eye when the reporter goes,
you could see where everything just,

508
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,750
yeah, in her eye she realized, oh no,

509
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:27,900
I've been found there's a,
um,

510
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,750
a picture of a before and
after with her and the,

511
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:35,160
before it was when she was identifying
as white, she's Trans Racial.

512
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:37,170
When she was identifying as white,

513
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,200
she had freckles and blonde hair and then
all of a sudden she's got that Orange

514
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:42,490
Tan

515
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:45,010
thing going on and like,
like legit,

516
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:49,800
like black woman permie looking hair.
Like she got her hair permed, sexy.

517
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,460
That waitress at the comedy store. You
look at that, look at her hair. I mean,

518
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,970
wow. That's, and she,
she, you would teach,

519
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,950
she taught at a university
level African studies. Wow.

520
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,470
How does no one know her from her past?

521
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:09,670
That could be such a parent's coming out
and saying that like this. Apparently,

522
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:14,080
uh, her parents had adopted a bunch of
brothers and sisters that were black,

523
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:18,130
I think. Was that what it was? Four
brothers and sisters that were black.

524
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,760
And so somewhere along the
line she appropriated like
that they were her family

525
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,690
and that she's black and she started
calling them one of them. Our son.

526
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:33,970
A little boy. Oh boy. Definitely hotter
black though. Yeah. That's a new trend.

527
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,210
She looks hot on the right,
but that can't be her for real.

528
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:42,220
That's Photoshop shit going on. It's
the whole thing is very, very strange.

529
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,570
It's really strange.

530
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:49,180
But here's what's even stranger
apparently look at hair. Wonderful.

531
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,020
Apparently the tea out
of the founding people,

532
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:57,580
like if it was 14 founding people of
the NAACP, um, 10 of them were white.

533
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,330
It was a lot of white people
involved in the Naacp and baby,

534
00:31:01,331 --> 00:31:04,150
this is good about what happens here.
I mean,

535
00:31:04,151 --> 00:31:06,550
not that this lady is crazy and
she's pretending to be black,

536
00:31:06,551 --> 00:31:10,000
but maybe it's good that the conversation
gets brought up and people realize

537
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,920
that like racial equality movement.

538
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:16,180
It doesn't have to be all black
people and wasn't all black people,

539
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,930
so if it was like there was in there
like her race doesn't have anything to do

540
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,020
with how good she is. They're
like, she's really good at her job.

541
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,430
She's like really into black people.
That's what it is. That's what it is.

542
00:31:27,431 --> 00:31:30,730
Nothing wrong with that. Some people
are really into French history.

543
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,000
Some people are, you know what I'm
saying? She's like top wig. Wait,

544
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:37,210
what's the new word? You can still
say it's still say wigger. Okay.

545
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:42,100
It hasn't been stolen it from us yet.
They haven't robbed us of wigger.

546
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,260
It's so weird. The whole thing
is wonderful. It's wonderful.
This lady's wonderful,

547
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:52,090
but meanwhile apparently she was,
she was good at her job and the Naacp,

548
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:55,840
they were actually saying,
yeah, she went full.

549
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,310
You got cat yard on her head.

550
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,680
She tried to figure it out like a
bunch of different ways of doing it.

551
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,580
That's when she was like,

552
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:04,270
I'm going to get found if I keep dying
my hair black and putting that fucking

553
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:07,780
spray tan stuff is going to
call me by my sheets. Orange.

554
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,160
Hold up.
The whole thing is so amazing.

555
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:19,420
It's amazing. And she browses
on fleek. She sued school.

556
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,333
What?

557
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:26,170
Naacp imposter sued
school over race claims.

558
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:32,200
Oh my God. She masqueraded
as a black, as black, uh,

559
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:37,030
once sued Howard University for denying
her teaching posts and a scholarship

560
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:41,030
because she was a white woman.
The smoking gun is learned. Whoa.

561
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,780
I'm older than her.
Wow.

562
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,510
She

563
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,380
graduated from the historically black
college with a master's of fine arts

564
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:54,260
degree. That's so interesting. So in 2002,

565
00:32:54,261 --> 00:32:59,150
she sued the school that is
so interesting. And she was
teaching somewhere else.

566
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:01,760
Right? Was she teaching there
where she teaches somewhere else,

567
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,570
but she was teaching like
African related courses.

568
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,000
She's just really in the Africa.
Imagine people.

569
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,540
But let's put yourself in her shoes.
I'm not saying the trans ratio is real.

570
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,360
Okay. I'm not saying you should be able
to just identify with a different race,

571
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:23,190
but if you could, she would be a really
good argument for it. Right. Okay.

572
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:27,240
She's got black people in her
family that she loves dearly. Right.

573
00:33:27,241 --> 00:33:32,190
She maybe identifies with them.
She went to an all black college.

574
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,850
She was teaching African studies and
she was running the fucking NAACP.

575
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,340
I mean, if anybody can be trans racial,
that lady was kicking ass at it.

576
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,350
Absolutely right.
You got to say,

577
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,540
I'm fucking impressed with what she's
done to her love of African people of

578
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:56,490
black people has let her do an
amazing job in several areas.

579
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,140
Right. I want to see your
wider Facebook page looks like.

580
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:03,460
How does a a boyfriend or somebody that
she dated not come out and say something

581
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:07,150
like, look, this chick is
really, they might not know why.
Really annoying. No, no, no,

582
00:34:07,151 --> 00:34:07,984
but you know what you mean.

583
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:13,120
Put more makeup on and she just hides
from you and the fucking curtain in her

584
00:34:13,121 --> 00:34:16,990
house is closed. Like drag.
She keeps all the lights off.

585
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:19,780
She kicks you out at night.
I can't sleep at anybody.

586
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:22,690
You got to go eat the greatest chick ever.
I don't have to sleep at her.

587
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,020
As soon as you leave, you hear the
compressors have written machine.

588
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,170
She's fucking spraying herself.

589
00:34:29,171 --> 00:34:32,710
The big airbrush can like she's
fucking detailed a Chevelle.

590
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:38,610
She had to have gotten
spray Tan thousand percent.

591
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,200
There was a spray tan or
somewhere that newer secret,

592
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,780
you know they had to bring it over
for the big umbrella. Yeah. Yeah.

593
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:49,180
Well this is like, did they, don't they
have a better way of doing that now?

594
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:53,170
How do they do that? They still make you
stand in and spray to make it realistic.

595
00:34:53,171 --> 00:34:56,140
That's the best way. I mean, you have
the rub on kind of stuff like that,

596
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,940
but you can't usually get it
even enough unless you really,

597
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:02,410
she just spent all day doing
it. How weird are we? Not We,

598
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,180
because I haven't done it.
I don't think you're doing it.

599
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:08,620
That people are going and getting fucking
spray Tan. I mean that is so insane.

600
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:12,670
You're going to end again. Die Sprayed
all over. Your body stinks too,

601
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:17,320
but just fucking weird. It's just
weird and it wears off in like a day.

602
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,650
You could get two days or whatever it is.
Get the abs sprayed on it though.

603
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,633
You can.
Yeah.

604
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:27,860
So retarded and people not have time
to lay in the sun anymore. Our Toe.

605
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,850
Maybe you live in Seattle?
Yeah, there's no room.

606
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,090
I just know from girls that you were like,
oh,

607
00:35:34,091 --> 00:35:38,340
I have to have photo shoot tomorrow so I
have to get spray Tan because I tan all

608
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,110
day to day and just, you
know, it's a timing thing.

609
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,650
Yeah, I get it. And it's
also skin cancer thing.

610
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,380
Some chicks don't want to get skin cancer.
You know,

611
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,320
standing out in the sun is
not good for you apparently,

612
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,270
which is fucked because you need
the sun for Vitamin D, Vitamin D,

613
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,050
You need vitamin a.
The fuck.

614
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,320
I don't put sunscreen on. I'm out. I
don't give a shit. You're an animal.

615
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:02,790
Look at you. You don't give
a fuck. You do it in spurts.

616
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,550
A little little spots. You don't go
out there for eight hours at a time.

617
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:08,220
I used to landscape when they'll
fucking shirt on. I just did it too.

618
00:36:08,221 --> 00:36:10,020
I can have a tan you a check.

619
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,690
That's what everybody did back then.
Yeah.

620
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,810
Nobody wore sunscreen when we were kids.

621
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,830
We put oil on and we did the opposite.
We got that oil just can't,

622
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,380
especially in like Massachusetts,

623
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,870
you know your summers a week long and
you've got to get it in while you can.

624
00:36:25,871 --> 00:36:29,280
Absolutely. I went up two notches on
a scale of one to 10. If I had a tan,

625
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:31,200
I went from like a four to a six.

626
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,010
So I had like a three month window where
I was a sex. I had to try to clean up.

627
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,300
When you're young, especially,
you've fucking making moves.

628
00:36:38,301 --> 00:36:40,920
You like to tell you where the chain,
the chain.

629
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,830
What about Cologne?
Probably try it.

630
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:48,900
That's it.

631
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,100
Your card Anwaar right and pull out the
green Polo had a green polo has got that

632
00:36:53,101 --> 00:36:56,610
shit too. You know what's the
fucking stand by old spice? God Damn.

633
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,000
I still use well it's nice
after old spice was good.

634
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,810
You didn't shower in that time and
just throw it on. Throw those medicine.

635
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:08,630
Yeah, dad's kit. You bought them.

636
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,660
Did you hear about that fucking
guy that cut some dude's throat?

637
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,950
He was one of those uh,

638
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,270
one of those straight razor or
shaver dudes and a barbershop. Oh No.

639
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,160
He just sliced this dude's
throat and ran away. Yeah,

640
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:22,850
and they caught him and apparently
had a history of mental illness.

641
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,040
Didn't even know the
guy who's throaty cut.

642
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,030
Just slashed this fucking guy's
throat. Shit. Yeah, the guy lived.

643
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,740
God's going to be okay. It didn't do
a good job of thrash and his throat,

644
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,590
Mr. Big artery, or maybe he was able
to plug it up. Whatever the guy did,

645
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:38,190
but fucking amen.
That's like the,

646
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,430
the number one thing that
everybody's worried about.

647
00:37:40,431 --> 00:37:42,350
What those fucking straight razors,
you know,

648
00:37:42,351 --> 00:37:47,180
like what would happen if I just randomly
got a nut and this nut decided to cut

649
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:50,360
my throat. That's why I go
to dollar shave club. Joe,

650
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,190
look at this sentence to Barbara.

651
00:37:52,191 --> 00:37:56,090
Thursday to 10 years in prison for
inexplicably slashing customer's throat

652
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:00,290
during a haircut and shave
before peddling away on his bike.

653
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,481
You guys,

654
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:07,481
Navy Petty Officer Timothy Von 33 was
at Vic's barbershop in imperial beach,

655
00:38:07,701 --> 00:38:11,450
just south of San Diego for a haircut.
And October when Barber Daniel,

656
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,250
Roberto Flores calmly slashed
a straight razor across Vons.

657
00:38:16,251 --> 00:38:19,520
Throat twice. Whoa. Mr. Flores.

658
00:38:19,521 --> 00:38:23,000
Waiting until people left the room
to street. Deputy district attorney,

659
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:26,780
Laura Evans said he insisted on
trimming the victim's beard. He said,

660
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,090
I could cut your throat.
And then he did Jesus Christ.

661
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,960
I want to know what was leading up
to that though. Was the guy being a,

662
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,200
you know the odd,

663
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,280
the petty officer was he just like being
a jerk the whole time looking at me.

664
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,133
He said his,
uh,

665
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,370
his training as a medic kicked in the
guy whose throat got cut and allowed him

666
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:48,100
to save his own life despite
severe injury and blood loss.

667
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,220
It's been hundreds of
hours of physical therapy,

668
00:38:51,221 --> 00:38:56,221
surgery and psychiatric treatment trying
to recover fucking a man to damn who?

669
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,990
They didn't know each other. There was no
conflict or argument before the attack.

670
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,900
That's so crazy.
That's only 10 years in jail.

671
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:08,850
What's,
how's that guy got to get fixed?

672
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,670
What are they going to let him out in
five? If it doesn't kill anybody, how,

673
00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:14,910
how's that going to go?
Like anybody who does that,

674
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:19,050
you need to kill that person.
You don't put them in jail for 10 years.

675
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:24,030
You out of your mind field and Texas and
let Ted Mnuchin a helicopter and shoot

676
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:28,050
at them. Pigs take them down to where
Ted news just shooting those pigs.

677
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:31,140
Shoot him in the knee caps. Just
let the pigs eat them. Fuck you.

678
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,980
I'd rather watch that. Yeah, fuck
you. Fuck you. You can't just do that.

679
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:38,850
You can't get out of jail in
10 years. That's crazy. 10
years. Not that much time.

680
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:43,970
10 years ago was 2005 that's not enough
time to go to jail for trying to kill

681
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:48,150
someone with a straight razor and I'll
probably be out in eight. Fuck that.

682
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,170
That's ridiculous.
Did you watch Jeff Ross's roast of the no,

683
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:56,280
I did not. I heard it was awesome. I've
seen it. I heard it was great though.

684
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,690
I love the fact that he did it.

685
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:59,700
I want to talk to him about it cause
he wrote a really good thing for the

686
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:04,290
Huffington post the other day about
the system. About the penal system.

687
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:07,730
Not understanding it once you get inside
of it and see how how fucked up in

688
00:40:07,731 --> 00:40:11,760
nightmare I should is the girls were
pretty hot in there. Really? Yeah.

689
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:14,640
There was a few really hot ones. No
Shit. Yeah, it was kind of weird.

690
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,550
I would imagine there's a lot of crazy
bitches that are hot and fuck up and do

691
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:21,000
something stupid. One up getting
locked up. That makes sense.

692
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:24,540
Why would you think that girls in prison
wouldn't be hot? I know because of me.

693
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:25,980
How many crazy girls do you have?

694
00:40:25,981 --> 00:40:30,000
I dated that we're one step away
from being in jail or oh yeah.

695
00:40:30,001 --> 00:40:31,990
You could have gotten a few
of them arrested if right.

696
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,750
I want to me judging a friend that
just got out after nine months,

697
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,190
like a nine and a half on a scale. I want
to tag how a motherfucker hot though.

698
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:44,660
Yeah. All of that's all right. Yeah. You,

699
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:47,110
you get them to the point where
they're ready to kill you. Yeah.

700
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:52,140
And then somehow or another you
escape with your life sucks.

701
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,140
But if there was a fucking
camera on the wall, oh,

702
00:40:55,141 --> 00:40:58,530
there's drop cams everywhere
nowadays show. Oh,

703
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:03,840
I got that shit secured. God Damn,
dude, I don't know what you're doing.

704
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:09,120
Everybody gets mad at you.
I'm not doing enough,

705
00:41:09,121 --> 00:41:11,190
I guess.
Whatever it is.

706
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:12,900
Yeah.

707
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,930
Do you have, do you, do you usually have
crazy girls in your life, Jim? Oh yeah.

708
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:19,640
He's a comic. Yeah. Mostly my whole
life. Your whole life pretty much.

709
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:24,000
Was there one that was most crazy?
Like was there a good story to it?

710
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:29,160
Milligan of them? I'm trying to think, but
yeah. You always attracted to it. Yeah.

711
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,550
I always wanted the crazy one after the
show. I was dancing on top of the bar.

712
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,850
Whipping her out.
Yeah.

713
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:38,830
Going to be fun. Yeah. Ooh. But depending
upon how crazy the personality is.

714
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,800
I met a gypsy the other day and I remember
we talked about Gypsy's recently. Uh,

715
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:46,170
I think we were sitting in this
chair song. Yeah. But she's a gypsy.

716
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,340
She doesn't have a house. A house? No.

717
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:52,540
Does that mean she just goes from one
millionaire's house to another million?

718
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:57,090
She's a millionaire. Gypsy girl. Wow.
Just hangs out. She's like, yeah,

719
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,280
just hang out at by pools and stuff.
There are girls that are like that.

720
00:42:00,430 --> 00:42:03,340
There's guys I know guys like that.
He's always like,

721
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,390
he's an older gentleman and he's kind
of quite a bit of money and he's in his

722
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:11,680
sixties he's never been married and a
hill invite like really hot chicks to stay

723
00:42:11,681 --> 00:42:14,530
at his place and they live
with them all the time.

724
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,590
Like he's always got like some new
nutty 10 let's live in with them.

725
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,310
And I want like, what do you and you
fucking her. I was like, wow, I'm trying.

726
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,790
I'm like Jesus Christ like,

727
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,210
but he would like bring them
in and that was the thing.

728
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:29,110
He would be like buy them stuff, get
them cars and they could live with them,

729
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,720
you know, and he would
try suit. He was like,

730
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,830
it's really mismatched cause he's not
a good looking fellow. He would also,

731
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,720
he would bring them in and
they would live with them.

732
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,140
And he tried super duper hard to get it.
Sometimes you get it,

733
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,990
but oftentimes it just be a disaster.
They couldn't,

734
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:47,140
he couldn't get laid and he's paying
for everything and they're living with,

735
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,740
I would do it, I would have a new guy
rule, but I've been in the cars and stuff,

736
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:54,480
but they can just crash there. No guy
rule. I can't bring guys over. No guys.

737
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:57,790
Yeah. Sometimes you know it sounds like
a sugar daddy thing. I had just strip,

738
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,490
I used to date, she had a sugar daddy and
she would just buy them all a sh buyer,

739
00:43:00,491 --> 00:43:02,320
all the shit, which is Greg
because I didn't have to buy it.

740
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,660
And then I got the appointment.
I go, you know what?

741
00:43:04,661 --> 00:43:07,060
Maybe he should stuck at me some
shit cause I'm letting her go out.

742
00:43:07,061 --> 00:43:09,760
He's trying to fuck her obviously.
Oh. And I'm like, oh gosh,

743
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,080
do I remember it was a VCR.
I'm like,

744
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:13,660
well get me a VCR because I don't want
to put up with their shit. Me and,

745
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,780
and then she come on with a VCR. It's
like I need a PCLR. I'm like, beautiful.

746
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,920
I actually went on a date with them in
a limbo and pretend that I was the guy

747
00:43:20,921 --> 00:43:24,020
friend and bad mouth myself for an
hour in front of this guy. You know,

748
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,940
don't have boyfriend of hers. Like
a, yeah, he's a real dick. Oh my God.

749
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,360
And we went to a mall and I picked out
like the like 20 cds he bought me and I

750
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:32,400
think he bought me like a,

751
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,810
I forget what was like a Walkman at the
time or something like that. I'm like,

752
00:43:34,811 --> 00:43:36,910
yeah, I'll take one. And I'd be like,
sure, you seem like a good dude.

753
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:38,951
This fucking bad.

754
00:43:38,951 --> 00:43:41,500
My mind and the guy's holding her hand
and the Limo and I'm just sitting there

755
00:43:41,501 --> 00:43:43,690
like the friend am, I don't
give a shit. I'm getting cds.

756
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,320
It's a strong pimp move.

757
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:50,110
I tried to get a TV but it
he wasn't going forward.

758
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,600
Wow. See a lot of these
guys that rocket like this,

759
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:56,600
the reason why they have two is
because of prostitution laws.

760
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:58,730
If prostitution was legal,

761
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:03,910
there's a lot of these older creep Zoya
dudes that are just out there trying to

762
00:44:04,641 --> 00:44:08,720
make it happen. It just tough action,
you know, unless you're paying for it,

763
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,310
very tough to get someone love
you for who you are. They're like,

764
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,190
if you had these really high
standards and your gross, yeah,

765
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,800
but if you've got a ton of
cash and prostitution's legal,

766
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:22,130
if they just made
prostitution legal in America,

767
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,630
you'd have exactly the same amount
of hose. Okay. Exactly the same.

768
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:29,990
Listen to me, they're not going to.
More people are not going to be hoes.

769
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:31,860
Hoes are hoes are ready.

770
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:35,760
They're just doing it in weird
ways and maybe it'd be better.

771
00:44:35,761 --> 00:44:40,230
Prostitution was legal.
He found a exactly who the home safer.

772
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:45,420
Exactly. Tax Pay.
Exactly. Amazon one click.

773
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:50,610
Right. Nothing wrong with
it. It's just sex. Is it okay
to get, get a massage? Yes.

774
00:44:50,910 --> 00:44:55,620
It's okay to pay someone to
suck your deck. It just is.
Yes, it should be. You know,

775
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:59,400
and these guys shouldn't have to move
these fucking girls in. Buy Him cars.

776
00:44:59,401 --> 00:45:03,760
It's rude by the guy friends, VCRs, and I
shouldn't have to do it. I felt bastard.

777
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:06,380
He's, I'm figuring he's trying
to bang my check. Right.

778
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,240
So at least I should get
some gifts out of it. Now,

779
00:45:09,241 --> 00:45:13,020
how did you wind up ending this whole
relationship? You know, it was a stripper,

780
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:15,330
so it was just, I mean with him, I

781
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,080
get him out of your life.

782
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:22,740
It seems like you would want some return
for his investments he was doing at

783
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:25,320
what? He was juggling like three
different ones and he just never,

784
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:26,430
I think he was fucking wine,

785
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:30,300
but he wanted to fuck all three and
course and my check had boundaries

786
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,920
while she said it wasn't, no, I wasn't
around. She said she was no way.

787
00:45:34,921 --> 00:45:38,160
I'm not going to sleep with him,
but that he bought her tits to,

788
00:45:38,161 --> 00:45:42,580
she wanted me to buy her tits,
tits and he bought her tits.

789
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:47,550
Holy Shit. Did you, did you guys go to
dinner with this guy? Yeah, just, yeah,

790
00:45:47,551 --> 00:45:50,710
we went to dinner. Not just at night.
I only met him that one time. Oh, okay.

791
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,650
I'd be at the Bardo cause you know,
shook it down.

792
00:45:52,651 --> 00:45:55,560
He always comes in a strip club and sits
there and all the girls come around.

793
00:45:55,561 --> 00:45:58,350
I was right across the bar just sitting
there just watching this guy. I'm like,

794
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:00,690
I'm fucking that tonight.
Keep giving her money. Oh,

795
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:01,940
let's just take a meter to diner.

796
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:04,560
She's taking me to dinner
later with that money. Okay.

797
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,130
You're the guy when the always people
always talk about like strippers,

798
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:10,830
crazy boyfriends. That's you. Yeah. Yeah.

799
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,110
It was like the central one and I
was like cutting lawns at the time.

800
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:16,800
I was making like eight bucks an hour
and this guy's truck and this guy is

801
00:46:16,801 --> 00:46:21,540
probably big at like 300 grand a year, so
that's pimpin. You're tactically pimpin.

802
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:25,140
Yeah, in a way, you know.
I mean not full on Pimpin,

803
00:46:25,141 --> 00:46:30,000
but that's pretty [inaudible]
respect. I really needed a PCR. Yeah,

804
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,920
I did. I just, I respect that
hustle. I've done the same stuff.

805
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:38,700
I've added things too when I did it.

832
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,220
Now it is dude guy comics that
have a wishlist named one.

833
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:14,720
Wow.
That's what we're talking about.

834
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:22,330
Does he? I'm sure he does. Does
he? Come on, I'll find one for you.

835
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:25,610
Didn't find if it's Thomson grow.
I highly doubt it.

836
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,840
I highly doubt Chrysler has one too.
No,

837
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,210
I don't think any of them have a wishlist.

838
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,430
Wishlist where they want you to buy them.

839
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:37,750
Shit that could see like a
struggling comic that has
got no money. It's like, Hey,

840
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:41,070
if I can get some whatever, if
I need something, maybe Ben,

841
00:48:41,071 --> 00:48:44,140
the someone that's established,
but there's no reason for that.

842
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:46,840
I can't even see a struggling
comic doing it. Like what?

843
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,920
What would you want someone to buy
you? Like what? What do you know?

844
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:55,290
What are you doing tires for your car.
The relationship the girl has. All right,

845
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,780
when she puts up with those Amazon
wishlist things, the relationship is like,

846
00:48:58,781 --> 00:49:01,720
look, this is a box. We can mail me shit.

847
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,560
Like all you have to do is just go
through the electronic things right here.

848
00:49:05,561 --> 00:49:08,980
Press this, click that and I'll get
some shit. Some money we'll be missing.

849
00:49:08,981 --> 00:49:10,420
But you're not going to notice that,
but well,

850
00:49:10,421 --> 00:49:14,230
you are going to notice the fact that
I'm going to go, oh my God. Thank you.

851
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:18,820
These are exactly the shoes that I
wanted and I was saving up for them so it

852
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:22,120
meant so much to me.
That's all they need.

853
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,920
I bought her, I bought her shoes. Teen.

854
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:30,750
I have them on now. Yeah, they
have. They do a lot of that, right.

855
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,230
Tell him skirt has one.
He has a wishlist. Yeah.

856
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:36,820
Well he's asking people to buy him shit.
Please read the list.

857
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:43,030
He's got last man standing on DVD.
I'm going to ask him right now.

858
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,770
He's got red state a grass.
Uh,

859
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,340
he's got a bunch of movies mall.
I survivals tail white.

860
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:53,730
This is what he wants from people.
I think so this might,

861
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,110
I mean it's just as wishlist.
It's not like,

862
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,230
like a lot of people have wishlist but
I don't think they like pimp them out.

863
00:49:59,231 --> 00:50:01,510
Like hey you know, here's my
wishlist. Buy me something.

864
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,720
It's more of like things that they're,
they want to get eventually.

865
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,100
I think you know I'm going to ask him,
do you have an Amazon wishlist?

866
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,870
If so lose my number. Yeah, he
actually, he's has a few of them.

867
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:17,200
It looks like he has a
few of them. Yeah. Let me,

868
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:21,780
let me see if Joey Diaz has one so

869
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,140
I bet he does. It's all
shit. His wife wants

870
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:33,770
that. That is that wishlist thing is
very strange. What's going to be way,

871
00:50:33,771 --> 00:50:37,550
way stranger is that within two or three
decades we're not even going to have to

872
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:39,200
go to the store to buy shit.

873
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:43,400
Like everything leave be sent to you
through the internet or it's going to be

874
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:47,660
three d printed. That's going to
be the vast majority. Fuck yeah.

875
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,570
I mean as long as it makes
sense like size wise,

876
00:50:50,571 --> 00:50:55,190
like you could three d print a table
this big in the in the machines that most

877
00:50:55,191 --> 00:50:56,420
people are going to have in their houses.

878
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,740
But I really believe that there's going
to be a time in our lives where people

879
00:51:00,741 --> 00:51:04,250
are going to be making most of the
stuff that they are going to download

880
00:51:04,251 --> 00:51:06,830
instructions and have a
fucking printer in their house.

881
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:09,860
It prints it just like
it prints a an image.

882
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,890
They're going to be able to do that with
actual three dimensional things like

883
00:51:12,891 --> 00:51:14,270
with high certainty.

884
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,180
Did you know that uh,
uh,

885
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,250
did you see that new printer
where it's like a liquid based uh,

886
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,920
printer where it doesn't,
it prints different,

887
00:51:21,921 --> 00:51:24,690
it's a different kind of three d
printer technology that they just may,

888
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:28,670
where it actually comes from the
bottom and they use like an error.

889
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:33,440
So like it pulls the item out
of all like a liquid bad ass.

890
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,920
Yeah.
There's a few different methods.

891
00:51:34,921 --> 00:51:38,430
They use different ways of
heating the little particles,

892
00:51:38,431 --> 00:51:40,230
those little pellets they use to fill.

893
00:51:40,231 --> 00:51:41,820
It's a bunch of different
methods of doing it,

894
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,910
but apparently they're saying that
like what we're seeing is the infancy.

895
00:51:44,911 --> 00:51:49,110
This is like the model t's of these
fucking things. Just like old printers.

896
00:51:49,111 --> 00:51:52,950
You remember those sprinters
was, it did. It did. It did.

897
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,620
It was super slow and shitty and
it was blocky. Never really looked,

898
00:51:57,621 --> 00:52:00,600
told like you like dark at the
top and the bottom and be light.

899
00:52:00,601 --> 00:52:03,870
They were dog shit. Dot Matrix
Printer. Now you can do,

900
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:07,500
you can get these fucking printers that
print photographs on photograph quality

901
00:52:07,501 --> 00:52:10,680
paper and it looks like an HD
photo. You're like, Holy Shit,

902
00:52:11,010 --> 00:52:14,970
I'm looking at like a really
nice photograph and you
can print it off of a home

903
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:17,160
computer printer. It's fucking nuts. Well,

904
00:52:17,161 --> 00:52:19,260
they're going to have
that with this 3d shit.

905
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:23,190
They're going to have three d objects
and you're going to just need the raw

906
00:52:23,191 --> 00:52:23,731
materials.

907
00:52:23,731 --> 00:52:27,720
You're going to have like
a jug of aluminum and you
know a big fucking thing of

908
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:30,390
all the different minerals that you're
gonna need to create these things.

909
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:34,140
And then the computer is going to
figure out where to put everything.

910
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:37,680
It's going to be nuts. It's going
to be really weird. Real weird.

911
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,900
Now they're going to be
able to do with biology.

912
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,150
That's when Shit's gonna get real weird.
If,

913
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,120
if technology continues where they're,

914
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:49,050
they can manipulate biology and they're
pretty close to be able to do that.

915
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,370
Now they're doing weird.

916
00:52:50,371 --> 00:52:54,030
Different things are splicing different
genes and shutting off different genes

917
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:55,170
and punched once.

918
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:00,200
If they do that and then that becomes so
commonplace that it starts getting its

919
00:53:00,541 --> 00:53:03,430
hand somehow or another
in the public of that.

920
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,870
But public gets a hand on it and the
public community and relate their own DNA.

921
00:53:06,871 --> 00:53:08,490
Like you can have your own build a pet.

922
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,620
Like you have a machine
where you can build a pet,

923
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,690
people are going to make like half
polar bear have fucking Hawk things.

924
00:53:15,691 --> 00:53:20,691
I mean just imagine how fucking bizarre
once people can actually manipulate life

925
00:53:21,601 --> 00:53:25,830
and create like their own versions of
animals and shit, which just to be chaos.

926
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,740
Yeah. You just choose the perfect
puppy. Like, I want to shit too,

927
00:53:28,741 --> 00:53:32,250
but I want to have that black on the
back and white in the front and it just

928
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:34,590
prints it out and it
comes to life immediately.

929
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,280
And if some asshole uses it wrong cue
mansion if feel like hanging out in your

930
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:41,610
house and the next door neighbor's
house explodes with baboons.

931
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:47,280
Baboons are running out of his house,
like just fucking asshole on his printer.

932
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,340
He's making these fucking Babbo.
It's full grown baboons.

933
00:53:50,341 --> 00:53:53,790
He prints them out and they just come
tumbling out of some chamber that he's

934
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,080
gotten his basement.
That's a lot of there.

935
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,120
I mean they're going to be able to do
some weird shit. That thousand years.

936
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:03,930
Think about a thousand years ago,
the best shit you had was a horse.

937
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:07,440
That's the best thing. The wagon
behind the horse. I mean that's okay.

938
00:54:07,441 --> 00:54:10,470
If you had some shit you had to
pull around, but the horse was,

939
00:54:10,471 --> 00:54:14,340
the way he got around the idea
that you could fly a plane.

940
00:54:14,370 --> 00:54:19,110
Like if you could go back to the 12
hundreds and tell them about air travel,

941
00:54:19,111 --> 00:54:21,780
how easy it is to get to Paris.
How easy it is.

942
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:23,700
Like in a day you could be in China,
they'd be like,

943
00:54:23,701 --> 00:54:26,760
what the fuck are you even
talking about, man? But yeah,

944
00:54:26,761 --> 00:54:30,240
you getting a two and it flies to
the, shut the fuck up. Just stop.

945
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,270
That's what it's going to be like
for us thousand years from now.

946
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:35,910
What they're going to be able
to do with bodies and with,

947
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,180
with electronics and what they're
going to be able to do with technology,

948
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:41,310
it's going to make,
we're living in the cave era.

949
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:46,500
We're living in some bizarre like static
world that we can't manipulate and

950
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,630
that's going to seem ridiculous
to people in the future.

951
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:52,030
Will they be able to cure cancer?
I want Jane Diseases that won't be on it.

952
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,230
So people will live to whatever age.
I can't imagine.

953
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,710
I think there's gonna come a point in
time if you, if you just follow the curve,

954
00:54:58,711 --> 00:54:59,370
right?

955
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:03,870
Go back from how quickly people died
of illnesses a thousand years ago,

956
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,860
how most illnesses that came along,
they were pretty severe.

957
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,300
They'd have a big impact like you,
you would,

958
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,930
you could easily lose 20% of the
population of your city and some sort of a

959
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:14,940
plague.
And they had a bunch of those,

960
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,870
the bunch of plagues they had plagues
that wiped out 60 70% of the population

961
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:23,340
and they have just an insane plagues.
That doesn't really happen anymore. Okay.

962
00:55:23,370 --> 00:55:24,880
So just think about the,

963
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,690
all the different medications
that scientists have come up with,

964
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,130
all the different treatments for diseases
that medical biology is constantly

965
00:55:32,131 --> 00:55:37,131
evolving and getting better at figuring
out a way to detect things early.

966
00:55:37,141 --> 00:55:42,141
And it's safer time to be like a person
who needs medical assistance now than

967
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:45,700
ever before, ever. In human
history part far, this is not even,

968
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:50,070
not even a remote comparison.
Right? Well, if that keeps going,

969
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,670
where's it going? It's getting better.
They're getting better at fixing bodies.

970
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,010
They're gonna be better at fixing bodies,

971
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,790
and eventually there's going
to be genetic manipulation.

972
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,320
When those two things combined,

973
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,420
it's like the only thing that's
gonna kill you as trauma.

974
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,740
Only thing that's gonna kill people.

975
00:56:01,741 --> 00:56:04,170
It's like accidents and
things that they can't fix.

976
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:07,410
That's what's going to kill people and
they're going to get some heart attacks.

977
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,480
They're going to get to a point
where they can fix all that shit.

978
00:56:09,481 --> 00:56:13,800
They're going to be able to reintroduce
different genes into your body,

979
00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:17,730
so there'd be able to introduce different
genes to your heart that make your

980
00:56:17,731 --> 00:56:21,600
heart work different. They have this
fucking shit that they're working on.

981
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,430
That spider silk.
It's,

982
00:56:23,431 --> 00:56:27,670
it's an artificial human skin
that's a hybrid with spider silk.

983
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,600
It's going to be bulletproof. They're
going to have bulletproof human skin.

984
00:56:31,601 --> 00:56:34,390
If this works, Holy Shit. Exactly.

985
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,290
What they're going to be able to do a
thousand years from now is outside of the

986
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:42,370
realm of anyone's imagination. The,
the history that we studied today,

987
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:45,550
when you study Alexander the Great,
when you studied Gingiss con,

988
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:50,470
if you had to go back in time that far,
the way they lived,

989
00:56:50,770 --> 00:56:53,800
you would still kind of understand
it. You know, you'd still,

990
00:56:53,801 --> 00:56:57,490
we understand the way they
live. We understand that.
They wrote her on horseback.

991
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:00,730
They got their water from the river.
They had a hunt for their food.

992
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:03,340
They had no refrigeration.
There's constant war and struggle.

993
00:57:03,341 --> 00:57:05,980
We understand that it's,
they still seem like people,

994
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:10,210
but what they're going to be a thousand
years from now is going to be nuts.

995
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:14,020
It's going to be fucking bananas.
Everyone's going to be 20 years old.

996
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:18,010
There's going to be no disease
and we're going to be freaks.

997
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,110
They're going to be able to
manipulate your genes. You,

998
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:21,640
you could be like a half eagle person.

999
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,830
He could run around with
feathers grown off your deck.

1000
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:27,430
That's not outside the realm of
possibility. Things are going to get real.

1001
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,690
If you have today like people you're
allowed to go, I mean, and you should be,

1002
00:57:31,870 --> 00:57:34,810
you're allowed to go to any one of those
body modification places and they put

1003
00:57:34,811 --> 00:57:39,010
fucking plates and your
forehead and stretch your
ears out and cut your lips off

1004
00:57:39,011 --> 00:57:43,120
or whatever nutty shit you want to
do. Why not let them do it? Who Cares?

1005
00:57:43,150 --> 00:57:47,920
But if you want to be like a
half ego person, Ooh, what?

1006
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:50,280
You're going to grow talons.
You're going to be happy.

1007
00:57:50,281 --> 00:57:53,830
Go person like we didn't even know you
should you be able to live in a city now

1008
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:57,430
that's going to happen. Half Eagle
people are going to be a reality

1009
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:59,040
analogy,
so what happens?

1010
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,920
All the pharmaceutical companies would
all are with no more sickness and all

1011
00:58:02,921 --> 00:58:07,360
that other stuff. It's 20%
of our oh cheese. Oh my God,

1012
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,980
that lip window. Whoa,
that's, that's rough yet.

1013
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:15,430
Oh my God. Is that real? Yeah. Oh my God.

1014
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:19,750
That guy's out a hole in the side of his
face like a second mouth and he sticks

1015
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:22,530
his tongue through it. Oh
my God. That's crazy. Yeah.

1016
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,640
Oh Geez. How did they drink koolaid?
It just comes out their mouth.

1017
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,530
I guess they have to use a straw.

1018
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,660
Everything there must have to
drink everything with his draw.

1019
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,330
Imagine watching that dummy eat.
Blowjobs squirts right back at you.

1020
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,270
What is that one of the, in the group
down there with the Tattoo. That guy.

1021
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:44,080
What is going on with him?
Oh my Jesus Christ.

1022
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:49,270
Holy Shit. Fuck. What is he doing?

1023
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:54,040
Look at this nose as these giant holes.
His nostrils.

1024
00:58:54,041 --> 00:58:58,240
He's had holes not in the bottom where
the nostril hole is, but on the sides,

1025
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:03,510
holes created and then stretched way
out the size of a quarter so you can see

1026
00:59:04,031 --> 00:59:07,410
right into his nasal cavity.
And then he's got those enormous ears,

1027
00:59:07,411 --> 00:59:09,430
stretchy things,
which I've gotten pretty used to.

1028
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:13,990
They're so normal now and he's got tattoos
all over his face and his side of his

1029
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:18,750
head and his eyebrows and Jesus. Fuck
Dude. What happened and how well,

1030
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:22,020
who did you wrong son
number.

1031
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:25,220
Simpler Times where he just had it
on the left side. You weren't gay,

1032
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:27,980
the right side. You were
gay. Now that's all it was.

1033
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,110
Did anyone that you knew when you were
growing up have a facial piercing? Never.

1034
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:37,240
No. No. Right? I can't think of anybody.
You know we had hoops or not hoops,

1035
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:40,810
but I mean, did you meet anyone
that even at a nose ring,

1036
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:44,860
when did you meet someone with a nose
ring? Nose Ring was college about 93 yeah,

1037
00:59:44,861 --> 00:59:47,440
that's what I saw. Chick
started went and guys toe. Yeah.

1038
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:50,950
I'm trying to figure it out. When
I saw my first nose ring. Joe,

1039
00:59:50,951 --> 00:59:53,830
didn't you have your belly button
pierced? No, it was my deck.

1040
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,700
I was going to have it connected to
my belly button with like a chain,

1041
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:02,600
like a wallet chain. Did you have,
did you have any hearing? I had to,

1042
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:07,000
I had to it in the last year. You couldn't
put it in a ride. I had a fake diamond,

1043
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:10,920
but it would wear a gold hoop.
Gold. Who? It's his picture.

1044
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,580
Joe.
I saw you on Ariadne's uh,

1045
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,970
Instagram wearing the extensions
that will put some of my hair on.

1046
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:23,190
That was funny as fuck. I think I was
actually Megan's Megan old Levy. The,

1047
01:00:23,191 --> 01:00:27,120
I'm a broadcaster interviewer.
Yeah, I think it was her hair.

1048
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:30,420
I don't know whose hair it was one of
those chicks I still funny to see or any

1049
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:33,990
style. It helped with getting the
checks. So it was always covered.

1050
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:36,510
My Dad didn't like it so I,
I take them out when I wasn't around,

1051
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:38,310
but he couldn't see it anyway
because my hair was really long.

1052
01:00:38,311 --> 01:00:40,170
But he need some peacock feathers,
man.

1053
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,590
But Bond Scott from ACDC had an earring
and each year I said, and you're like,

1054
01:00:43,591 --> 01:00:47,430
wait a minute, you too. So some guys would
go with both like, Hey, I'm not, you know,

1055
01:00:47,431 --> 01:00:49,140
cause if it was in the right ear,
that meant you were gay.

1056
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:50,940
But if you had them both, he's like, well,

1057
01:00:50,941 --> 01:00:54,090
Bon Scott had my bald so I can have
in both. I never went bold move.

1058
01:00:54,091 --> 01:00:57,840
I know it was the both Eddie Bravo
used to do it. I do both. Awesome.

1059
01:00:58,110 --> 01:01:00,210
I could still do it in both there.
They're both still.

1060
01:01:00,211 --> 01:01:02,460
They haven't grown together
yet. How dare you? So weird.

1061
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,080
Yeah, it's a, we are
saying what you're allowed,

1062
01:01:06,081 --> 01:01:10,010
but it's weird what you're allowed to
and not allowed to. I'm not allowed.

1063
01:01:10,011 --> 01:01:10,641
Me Personally,

1064
01:01:10,641 --> 01:01:13,370
I'm not allowed to hang out with
anybody that his eyebrow piercings.

1065
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:17,000
If you're a dude and you know, vibe Raul
piercings. I looked in my rules and I go,

1066
01:01:17,001 --> 01:01:20,330
oh look,
I'm so sorry I have rules.

1067
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:23,450
I don't hang out with any dudes
of eyebrow piercing. I gotta go.

1068
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,700
I liked that role. That's fair
enough. But it's, it's different.

1069
01:01:28,701 --> 01:01:32,000
Like Cara Santa Maria was
our friend is awesome.

1070
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,910
She's got a lip ring and normally I
look at people with lip rings. I'm like,

1071
01:01:34,911 --> 01:01:38,390
what is that dumb shit about?
Well I got metal coming out of your face,

1072
01:01:38,870 --> 01:01:42,830
but she could pull it off.
Like it just depends on the individual.

1073
01:01:42,831 --> 01:01:45,140
It doesn't even, I don't even
notice it. She has a lip ring.

1074
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,590
It just seems like a part of her.
She's so smart and interesting.

1075
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:51,890
Talk to doesn't really kind of
affect how you think of her,

1076
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:55,520
but a lot of people like you meet a
girl with a lip ring like listen crazy.

1077
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,340
What's going on with your
face? Huh? I ain't got there.

1078
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,710
Three ring binder come down here.
Fucking lip.

1079
01:02:00,830 --> 01:02:03,710
I don't like the pussy periods because
I feel I'm going to tear it or rip it or

1080
01:02:03,711 --> 01:02:07,780
something and then it just, I don't like
it. That's a strong statement to grow.

1081
01:02:07,830 --> 01:02:12,560
It gets her pussy pad. I've had a couple
of, it doesn't really do anything.

1082
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:17,330
I know down. Woo, what are you doing
down there? Why am I adding hardware?

1083
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,370
One this one check at a little bar bell.

1084
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:22,950
She was you lifting weights was a pussy.

1085
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:29,490
Well, some girls will
do key goals, you know?

1086
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:32,970
I mean that's essentially like doing
some Bruce Lee dynamic tension exercises

1087
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:36,180
for your pussy. She could masturbate
by just tying a kite to it.

1088
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,430
You know Bruce Lee used to do that.
Bruce least fucking,

1089
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,360
he's to do these exercise
where you're just tensed up.

1090
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:45,780
Girls do that with their
poster that it works too. Well,

1091
01:02:45,781 --> 01:02:47,370
there's a woman in Russia,
they can carry weight.

1092
01:02:47,371 --> 01:02:49,860
She has the world record for the amount
of weight that she can carry with her

1093
01:02:49,861 --> 01:02:54,270
pussy. Like she shove something up or
post it clamps down on it and she can lift

1094
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:58,920
weights. Like I'm talking like fucking
heavyweight, like 50 60 pounds. Pussy.

1095
01:02:59,340 --> 01:03:02,340
Yeah. It's like a vice grip in
there. This is a Russian woman.

1096
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:06,270
I wouldn't want my cock in there. Yes,
you probably wouldn't. First of all,

1097
01:03:06,271 --> 01:03:09,360
you wouldn't because you wouldn't want
to put your cock in the pussy of a woman

1098
01:03:09,361 --> 01:03:10,800
who's been practicing something like that.

1099
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:14,610
Like what is wrong with her that what
she's, she's not just practicing it.

1100
01:03:14,611 --> 01:03:15,870
She's entering contests.

1101
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:19,890
It's not like she's at home in the
privacy of her own home. I'll get,

1102
01:03:19,891 --> 01:03:22,440
she's got some stuff stuck in
their pussy and she's dangling

1103
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:29,070
like a noodle or something. She's so
she's got it in between her legs. Okay.

1104
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:33,870
But um, so she holds a world record for
the amount of weight that she can carry.

1105
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:38,180
I don't know if it's hers. It's
her. It's all in Russia. Oh.

1106
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:41,220
So now she's got an actual physical
weight that she's hanging from her pussy.

1107
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:46,450
This is insane. Look at
this. She's picking up this
heavyweight with her. Was He?

1108
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,800
Oh my God.
Ain't nobody got time for that.

1109
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:53,240
She's just letting you know that
she will fuck the life out of you.

1110
01:03:53,241 --> 01:03:56,820
That don't come near me.
She's just letting you know.
If she gets a hold of you,

1111
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:57,930
that Super Pussy,

1112
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,570
she's going to lock on to you and you're
going to have to use 50 60 pounds of

1113
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:07,260
force just to get away from her.
That's a fucking statement.

1114
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:11,120
That's why you just try for anal
first. Go right to the ass. Yeah.

1115
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:12,960
Just go right to the assets are not like,
you know,

1116
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:15,090
I like this better and then we'll,
we'll get to the pussy.

1117
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,560
Could you imagine what kind of ask power
she has and everyone has asked me or

1118
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:22,170
right. People used to clenching and
shits holding in farts. You know,

1119
01:04:22,171 --> 01:04:24,330
that's a common thing,
but to, I don't know.

1120
01:04:24,331 --> 01:04:27,200
How common is it for girls to actually
work on tightening their pussy?

1121
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:30,630
Have you had a girl ever squeezer asshole
muscle while you're in her asshole

1122
01:04:30,631 --> 01:04:35,340
before? No. It's cool. No, I never
did either. They were just mad.

1123
01:04:35,341 --> 01:04:38,040
I was in there. There were
clenching their fists. It's weird.

1124
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:42,990
I'm sure she's trying to shut you
out. Sorry. That's just trying to cut.

1125
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,880
It's an analogy for your whole life.

1126
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,730
I went through this part
where this girl was dry.

1127
01:04:49,950 --> 01:04:51,960
I dated for a long period of time.
It's mad at me for it.

1128
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:55,340
So for a month she wouldn't let me have
vagina sex that could only have butts

1129
01:04:55,341 --> 01:04:58,230
sex and you think that sounds awesome.
But after like the third day,

1130
01:04:58,231 --> 01:04:58,921
it's just awful.

1131
01:04:58,921 --> 01:05:01,190
But that was one thing that she
would do all the time just to do.

1132
01:05:01,191 --> 01:05:03,690
That was her punishment. Yeah.
It was a horrible punish.

1133
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,540
You think that's a great punishment?
That's a horrible punish.

1134
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:09,840
Why was it horrible? Because you don't
want to miss x more than three times.

1135
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,060
You know? You're like, all right, I'm
done. I don't want this anymore. You know?

1136
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:15,280
So she was like trying to play like
some sort of psychological game.

1137
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:17,890
Just give you the ass and then you
will never ask they ass again. Right?

1138
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:21,330
Hmm. That's the kind of
girls that Dave, Brian,

1139
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:24,080
that's how they think that or
why I don't like it anymore, man.

1140
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,520
And that you do that squeezy thing.

1141
01:05:27,521 --> 01:05:30,430
She'll do that squeezy thing and it just
feels like there's like something else

1142
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:33,550
in there. It's just too tight. Just too
sharp corners. It's like the Samsung Edge.

1143
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:37,960
How many girls do you think actually
like work on that? Do those key goals?

1144
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,710
Is that a common thing? Yeah. Especially
yoga girls. Definitely yoga girls. Yeah.

1145
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,410
Cause they're just tightening
their pussy all the time and yoga.

1146
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,740
And there's like exercises you
could do when you're just sitting.

1147
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:49,750
You could also use those balls and
stuff. Like dudes can do that too. Right?

1148
01:05:49,751 --> 01:05:54,090
That's those. Um, for uh, uh,
Kama Sutra, you know, the, the,

1149
01:05:54,091 --> 01:05:57,700
the different strategies of,
uh, what's that type of, uh,

1150
01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:01,660
what does that type of,
um, tantric, thank you.

1151
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,270
What are you supposed to hold in your
calm and not supposed to have orgasm on

1152
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:08,840
edge all the time? Joe, you ever edge
is supposed to like just hold, hold, oh,

1153
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:12,880
well supposed to keep it inside of you
and if you can hold it tight enough,

1154
01:06:12,881 --> 01:06:17,500
apparently you internally orgasm
internally. I don't know what that means.

1155
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:21,670
I guess you have the same feeling, but
it's more intense, but you don't come.

1156
01:06:21,990 --> 01:06:25,780
So you're probably also an idiot by the
time of the third week rolls around.

1157
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,830
All you're thinking about is how fucking
horny you are everywhere you got like

1158
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,430
Jesus Christ because you haven't
common three, four weeks.

1159
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:38,020
It's terrible idea. That's what people
used to do when they didn't have cable.

1160
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:40,660
You know, they'd practice different
ways to hold them there. Calm.

1161
01:06:40,661 --> 01:06:42,340
Just to make life more interesting.

1162
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:46,180
Just just hurry up and come and watch
game of Thrones. Just get in there.

1163
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,660
I'd rather a lot of just slide out for
a second. I, oh, sorry. I, you know,

1164
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:52,690
give me a second. I think I heard
someone's at the door to suck a regroup.

1165
01:06:53,390 --> 01:06:57,790
I'm not going to hold it in.
Clench down that muscle.

1166
01:06:57,791 --> 01:07:02,200
So weak. Even if you lift weights like
you, you could have like the best grip.

1167
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:05,620
Give a guy a fucking manly hand shake.
How all your bud. Nice to meet Ya.

1168
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,000
You'd be a stud,
but that muscle that controls your Dick.

1169
01:07:10,001 --> 01:07:15,001
Every guy's got this
week just fucking lazy.

1170
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:17,830
It gets tired and fatigued.
Easy.

1171
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,010
Like you could clamp your jaw shut
for a fucking hour. You get to fuck up

1172
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:28,630
you, you clamp your Dick tried to
squeeze down your Dick for 20 seconds,

1173
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:32,770
you're ready to blackout. It's just
such a weak muscle like right now,

1174
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,270
try squeeze your Dick Hall.
Also.

1175
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,140
I have no endurance on
my dick squeeze muscle.

1176
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:43,440
I wonder if you practice it,

1177
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:46,780
would it really get to a point where
you could be like the male equivalent to

1178
01:07:46,781 --> 01:07:51,640
that lady that carries bricks in
her pussy? What is this? How men,

1179
01:07:51,850 --> 01:07:55,810
how can men do Kegel exercises?
Why would they do that?

1180
01:07:56,230 --> 01:08:01,180
Halfway through urination? Try to
stop or slow the flow of urine. Yeah,

1181
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,590
that's possible. It's not fun. Don't
tense the muscles in your buttocks,

1182
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:06,670
leg or abdomen,

1183
01:08:06,671 --> 01:08:11,320
and don't hold your breath when you
can slow or stop the flow of urine.

1184
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,930
You've successfully located these muscles.
Okay?

1185
01:08:13,931 --> 01:08:15,980
So don't tense the muscles
in your buttocks, legs

1186
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:19,420
or abdomen, and don't hold
your breath. Okay, so you're,

1187
01:08:19,510 --> 01:08:23,660
you have to figure out how to
stop the p from the middle,

1188
01:08:24,410 --> 01:08:26,270
like some instead of
like squeezing your butt.

1189
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:30,170
Like if you had to stop peeing in the
middle of PN who'd clamp your butt shot,

1190
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,690
you would squeeze down your Dick and
you would try to stop the stream.

1191
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,840
What they're saying is don't
tense the muscles in your butt,

1192
01:08:35,870 --> 01:08:37,430
your legs or your abdomen,

1193
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:42,640
and don't hold your breath that you could
actually just develop a squeeze that

1194
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:46,520
could stop pee from coming out without,
without moving anything else,

1195
01:08:46,521 --> 01:08:48,850
but your deck muscles can't believe

1196
01:08:49,020 --> 01:08:52,160
I'm talking about can you flip your
pick up and hit your belly like,

1197
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,210
like we were in. It's hard.
Can you like flick? It was

1198
01:08:56,310 --> 01:09:00,090
really ridiculous. Questions are
stupid as fuck. Now. Can you do that?

1199
01:09:00,091 --> 01:09:02,010
Can you move your Dick?
Who knows Brian?

1200
01:09:02,011 --> 01:09:05,310
No one's sitting around moving their
deck. What? The hotties out your hands?

1201
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:08,510
Yeah, just flick it up.
What? You can't do it? Yeah,

1202
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:11,440
you got my balls way mind down so
it's not going to go off. Yeah,

1203
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,640
I could flick it. I can just
like sit there and just be like,

1204
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:16,450
if it's hard I could just go like flick
night and flip my stomach. That stuff.

1205
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,070
They can do that dude.
He's just said he can't.

1206
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:23,270
I know you're talking about, no, you're
talking about and it's so worth it to us.

1207
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:23,900
He's like,

1208
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:27,500
I can muscle like remember when you're
five and your friend nipple first learned

1209
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:30,740
how to whistle. I can whistle. Can you
whistle? Everybody can fucking whistle.

1210
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:32,420
All right dude. Yeah,
get smacked my belly.

1211
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:37,100
Every guy who has a hard on can do that.
If your dick gets hard, you tense it up.

1212
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:39,200
It hits your stomach.
That's how it's designed.

1213
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,600
My molds shots when I want to pull it
cools. My mom plays to like close it,

1214
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:46,280
but she didn't even know how to do that.

1215
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,810
Can you flip back or a pen in your mouth?

1216
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:54,950
What
you like flip it.

1217
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,890
You put a grape on the head of your
deck and it flip it up. Do you do that?

1218
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,740
I can do that. You've never done
that? I've done that. Definitely done.

1219
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:03,710
I've done that. You put a grape on
your deck and flipped it in your mouth?

1220
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:06,170
I don't believe in them.
No, I didn't get my mouth.

1221
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,140
I said try to flip it in your
mind. How far does it go up? Uh,

1222
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:11,251
first of all,

1223
01:10:11,251 --> 01:10:14,470
I don't believe that at all because I
believed that if you did start it and you

1224
01:10:14,471 --> 01:10:15,450
got close to your mouth,

1225
01:10:15,451 --> 01:10:18,890
you would keep flipping into your face
until you caught it around with me.

1226
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:23,880
No, Joe, I can do it. Why should you
put it on your helmet? Flip it up. Yeah.

1227
01:10:24,150 --> 01:10:26,230
Did you get brain damage this
weekend or something to haul it away?

1228
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,770
It's not smoking real.
So something wrong with you.

1229
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:30,900
You seem like there's really
something wrong with you today.

1230
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,510
Your sentences are so ridiculous.

1231
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:37,400
Very not smoking cigarettes and I have it.
I slept with a patch on,

1232
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:38,263
I forgot to take off.

1233
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,450
Yeah, you cannot leave those on the kill.
You at least give you a heart attack.

1234
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:45,210
So throw that out though. Don't leave that
on my table. You creep. It's that real.

1235
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:47,070
Why that you can't sleep
with it cause I've, yeah,

1236
01:10:47,071 --> 01:10:49,920
you're not supposed to sleep
with them. It's intense.
That's true. I'm pretty sure.

1237
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:51,330
Pretty sure it's supposed
to take those off.

1238
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:54,540
There's like a bunch of different rules
to those things and you can't have too

1239
01:10:54,541 --> 01:10:57,300
many of them. Like people have like
four or five of them on and died.

1240
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:00,180
You gotta be fucking careful.

1241
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:04,140
You get at those patches like
especially the variant strength,

1242
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:07,050
you know you're supposed to wean yourself
off to a lighter and lighter patches.

1243
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,480
The lightest one.
It's just seems fucked up to me.

1244
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:11,520
The nicorette gum makes the most sense.

1245
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:14,060
It's the grossest you'd taste
nicotine and you want it. It

1246
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,410
makes me puke.
Like I will literally Puke if I,

1247
01:11:16,411 --> 01:11:18,900
if I hadn't the nicorette
nicotine gum or the mints.

1248
01:11:18,930 --> 01:11:21,610
It has like this weird nicotine tastes,
that

1249
01:11:21,890 --> 01:11:25,120
soluble Mark Marin's strategy.
He just keeps chewing the nicotine gum.

1250
01:11:25,121 --> 01:11:29,010
He's been on the nicotine gum for like
10 years bosses the same way. Guys.

1251
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:32,410
Been Nicorette gum for a year. I think
Marin's actually done with the gum now.

1252
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,100
I think it's completely free of the good
for him. That's a hard fucking monkey.

1253
01:11:36,101 --> 01:11:38,980
Just the kick that's cigarette
monkey seems like to me.

1254
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:40,390
Out of all the things that I've seen,

1255
01:11:40,391 --> 01:11:44,350
people kicked cigarettes seems to be
the toughest. Does not the toughest,

1256
01:11:44,351 --> 01:11:46,660
the consequences of going back
on it because if you see guy,

1257
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:50,680
he's got a heroin problem, then he's, he
kicks it and then he goes back on heroin.

1258
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,210
He's all fucked up.
His life's a mess.

1259
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:54,760
But if you see God kicked
cigarettes and comes back,

1260
01:11:55,310 --> 01:11:57,250
it's just smoking a cigarette,
you know? It was like, ah,

1261
01:11:57,251 --> 01:11:58,850
I quit for a little law I couldn't play.

1262
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,060
But he's still right there talking to you.
You know what I'm saying?

1263
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,900
It's not like someone to quit something
like math or something fucking crazy.

1264
01:12:04,901 --> 01:12:09,460
That ruins your life really quick.
Cigarettes is a nice slow burn.

1265
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,000
But if you can take that out of it and
you look at it objectively like how many

1266
01:12:13,001 --> 01:12:16,600
people do you know that were former
drug addicts? Oh, I know all lot.

1267
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:18,940
A lot of dudes who had
problems with drugs.

1268
01:12:19,420 --> 01:12:24,420
How many dudes do I know
that had a problem with
cigarettes and did successfully

1269
01:12:25,301 --> 01:12:28,120
kick it? Not that many. Only a few.

1270
01:12:28,570 --> 01:12:32,470
I know a lot of people that struggle
with that shit hardcore you,

1271
01:12:32,500 --> 01:12:34,530
you struggled with it hardcore are,

1272
01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:38,290
he still says he gets cravings for it
and he kicked it a long fucking time ago.

1273
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:41,560
Um, Dunkin's still gets
cravings, you know,

1274
01:12:41,561 --> 01:12:43,330
he'll still have a cigarette
every now and again.

1275
01:12:43,331 --> 01:12:45,790
Joey will have allow himself a
cigarette every now and again,

1276
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:47,890
which I think is like
super fucking dangerous.

1277
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:50,600
Joey. Joey actually always
doesn't, he always smoked.

1278
01:12:50,601 --> 01:12:52,070
There's like e-cigarette
things all the time.

1279
01:12:52,120 --> 01:12:53,050
Sometimes he does,

1280
01:12:53,051 --> 01:12:55,870
but you remember back in the day he
would allow himself a cigarette every now

1281
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:58,480
and then. Fuck it. Whatever.
I'm not a cigarette.

1282
01:12:58,750 --> 01:13:00,070
He's just sitting there
smoking a cigarette.

1283
01:13:00,071 --> 01:13:03,940
But he had enough willpower to not
go buy a pack and not keep going.

1284
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:06,003
But um,

1285
01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:11,050
that seems to be like as hard a kick
as anything because it seems to me like

1286
01:13:11,680 --> 01:13:13,250
when people are like the,

1287
01:13:13,251 --> 01:13:16,720
the heroin thing and like people
have like severe pill problems.

1288
01:13:16,870 --> 01:13:19,420
Like they look at those
pill problems like, fuck,

1289
01:13:19,421 --> 01:13:22,240
I hope those things don't get me again.
You know, if they get off of them,

1290
01:13:22,241 --> 01:13:25,390
they look at him like fuck like
that's his fucking pills man.

1291
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:27,990
People don't look at cigarettes
that way they look at it. It's,

1292
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,820
it's a much more casual thing
cause it kills you so slowly.

1293
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:33,250
Cigarettes though is have
his has killed coffee for me.

1294
01:13:33,251 --> 01:13:36,780
Like right now this coffee is horrible
and I used to love coffee and I can't it,

1295
01:13:37,090 --> 01:13:39,370
I don't even want to drink this coffee
now. What are you talking about?

1296
01:13:39,371 --> 01:13:40,071
Just because the,

1297
01:13:40,071 --> 01:13:44,680
the whole cigarette and
coffee thing together is kind
of made what coffee was in

1298
01:13:44,681 --> 01:13:46,960
my head.
So now just this by itself,

1299
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:49,830
it's off white plus your taste
buds are probably coming back now.

1300
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:50,890
What other smoke?

1301
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,360
That's a big part of it, dude. You're
do your taste buds get really fucked up.

1302
01:13:54,361 --> 01:13:55,380
But cigarettes apparently.

1303
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,750
Yeah. I haven't noticed that.
I've just noticed zero energy.

1304
01:13:58,810 --> 01:13:59,740
Like I can't stop sleep.

1305
01:13:59,990 --> 01:14:03,890
So weird to me that like
chefs would smoke cigarettes.

1306
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,390
Like I don't understand that.

1307
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:09,560
Like Anthony Bordain used a small key
quit is the cigarette break. Yeah.

1308
01:14:09,561 --> 01:14:11,710
But it's still like if
you're smoking cigarettes,

1309
01:14:11,711 --> 01:14:15,130
how do you know exactly what things
taste like of it numbs your taste buds?

1310
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:18,120
I don't know how accurate that really
is because I've quit before for like a

1311
01:14:18,121 --> 01:14:20,250
year and I've never noticed
anything with the d.

1312
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,840
The taste or the smell is as at
least that drastic of something.

1313
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:29,430
Hmm. I think that's a
pretty commonly known thing.

1314
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:34,390
Like that taste buds come back all of a
sudden full light you don't like anymore.

1315
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:36,690
Yeah, I don't think, I
mean it probably varies.

1316
01:14:36,691 --> 01:14:39,340
I mean maybe it doesn't affect you the
way it affects other people like you.

1317
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:42,480
You think you have a pretty good sense
of taste while you're smoking cigars.

1318
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,930
I used to, I, I've noticed
that my tastes like,

1319
01:14:44,931 --> 01:14:48,140
I don't really taste things as much
anymore, but I think that's just,

1320
01:14:48,141 --> 01:14:48,974
cause I'm old.

1321
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:55,040
That doesn't even make sense. Dying
don't they? When? When you get older.

1322
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:57,430
So we're self diagnosing again.
We did this the other day.

1323
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,120
I think that when you're
smoking cigarettes,

1324
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:03,970
I think it's killing all
sorts of shit in your throat.

1325
01:15:04,330 --> 01:15:07,300
And the fact that it fucks with your
taste buds. It's not surprising.

1326
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:10,510
You're smoking your taste buds.
The taste buds are in your mouth.

1327
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:14,110
You're flooding your mouth
with poisonous fucking smoke.

1328
01:15:14,290 --> 01:15:17,920
Do you still smoke? No, I, I
stopped like 25 [inaudible] seven

1329
01:15:17,970 --> 01:15:20,100
years.
It's a hard one to quit.

1330
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:23,490
One of the hardest ones to
quit and way more common.

1331
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,430
Also fulfils other ones when
like heroin or math or it's,

1332
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:31,260
it's way more common that people
smoke cigarettes than do meth.

1333
01:15:31,380 --> 01:15:34,470
And I smoked for 25 years. Yeah.
And you said you were up to,

1334
01:15:34,471 --> 01:15:36,030
I only smoke like eight cigarettes a day.

1335
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:39,780
I wasn't a big smoker where you said two
packs. Two packs of the last six months.

1336
01:15:39,781 --> 01:15:42,420
Yeah. Were, yeah, that's why I quit
cause I was like this is ridiculous.

1337
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:45,720
I'm smoking two packs a day now and I
would be like, why am I smoking so much?

1338
01:15:45,721 --> 01:15:47,190
And it was,
why were you smoking so much?

1339
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,280
I think all the crap that's
happened like the last six months.

1340
01:15:50,281 --> 01:15:52,920
So that's a lot of
cigarettes, dude. I stress.

1341
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:57,180
So you stopped and now nothing.
Right,

1342
01:15:57,240 --> 01:16:02,130
except this patch but no cigarettes
at all for how long? Seven days.

1343
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,370
Whoa. And will they say you have
to get over, what's the hump?

1344
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:08,880
They have like a list that's on the
Internet that shows you like you know from

1345
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:13,140
like day two and three of quitting. This
happens and then a week and it, it, it,

1346
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:16,800
I think it's maybe three months
at that list goes to like,

1347
01:16:16,801 --> 01:16:21,060
and after the third month you'll
have 98% less of a heart attack.

1348
01:16:21,061 --> 01:16:24,390
Chance and really, and you're
going to grow better fingernails.

1349
01:16:24,391 --> 01:16:28,680
I forget what the list said,
but it was involving taste and smells.

1350
01:16:28,681 --> 01:16:31,680
Are you really going to stick with
it this time? I don't know. Wow.

1351
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:33,320
That's not as strong fucking night owl.

1352
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:38,010
That's not the one who stayed one thing
being at the comedy store has been

1353
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:42,330
really rough because that place for some
reason you can still smoke on the patio

1354
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:45,720
and everywhere. Almost outside. Yes.

1355
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,010
Well all the other bars,
you can't even smoke on patios anymore.

1356
01:16:49,020 --> 01:16:50,230
But I think cause it's a,

1357
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:53,400
and maybe you should shut the fuck up
so they don't get rated. Know they know,

1358
01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:58,410
but, but uh, but, but it's so,
so much smoke. Everyone smokes.

1359
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:01,470
It's, it's like you get
secondhand smoke. Well,

1360
01:17:01,471 --> 01:17:06,420
I just can't stop thinking
about it. So when you go
there, now, what do you do? Uh,

1361
01:17:06,450 --> 01:17:10,010
I just, I'm just dead inside. I
don't know. Oh, here's the thing.

1362
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:14,300
Yeah. Isn't that crazy? After 20 minutes,
your blood pressure drops to normal.

1363
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:17,930
Pulse rate drops to normal temperature
in hands and feet increase in normal

1364
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:22,340
eight hours. Carbon monoxide levels
in blood drops and normal. Wow.

1365
01:17:22,341 --> 01:17:26,460
It takes eight hours. 48 hours.
Nerve endings start regrowing like,

1366
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:32,030
and it's just like a smell and taste
is enhanced just 48 hours outside of

1367
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,770
cigarettes. See, there
you go. Just six days.

1368
01:17:33,771 --> 01:17:36,530
Doctors were saying cigarettes are good.
Take him smoke.

1369
01:17:36,531 --> 01:17:39,470
I'm doing commercials for them.
I think it was earlier than the sixties,

1370
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:41,270
but maybe 50 shots, right. Was, um,

1371
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:45,510
in that j Edgar Hoover movie and
the j Edgar Hoover movie. Uh,

1372
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,940
what's his name? Uh, what
the fuck's his name? Vena.

1373
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:52,100
Leonardo Dicaprio is j Edgar Hoover and
his mother is talking to him about the

1374
01:17:52,101 --> 01:17:55,820
doctor prescribing cigarettes for
him, like to match them up. Hey look,

1375
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,060
doctors five I'd have to one commercials.
Yeah,

1376
01:17:59,061 --> 01:18:01,760
I see you see the ads
cigarettes a good for yet small.

1377
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:06,080
Come look at that five years. Stroke
risk reduced to that of a nonsmoker.

1378
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:10,670
Fights graders though. Still
though. That's great. A
risk of cancer of the mouth.

1379
01:18:10,671 --> 01:18:14,690
Throat, esophagus is half that of a
smoker in five years. Just five years.

1380
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,520
That's great. In 10 years,
precancerous cells are replaced.

1381
01:18:19,970 --> 01:18:23,210
Lung cancer death rate is about half
the rate of a smoker in 10 years.

1382
01:18:23,211 --> 01:18:27,620
Life expectancy comparable to a nonsmoker.
If you quit for 10 years,

1383
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:28,783
that's beautiful.

1384
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:34,000
Smoker or a nonsmoker that works at a
paint factory more way more fucked or

1385
01:18:34,020 --> 01:18:35,900
black mold in your house.

1386
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:40,010
People that work in like fucking plants
and factories like especially back

1387
01:18:40,011 --> 01:18:42,910
before they knew what kills you
and what didn't kill you like yeah.

1388
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,680
A lot of people got a fucking
real bad deal like that.

1389
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:47,480
They found out about
that as best as cause.

1390
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,110
A bunch of dudes got cancer from as
best as you know, from working on it.

1391
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,290
They used to have that as best as that.

1392
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:57,320
Remember that shit they used to a
installation for all the old houses. Yeah.

1393
01:18:57,830 --> 01:18:59,330
Houses are filled with cancer.

1394
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,740
My body used to work on these old
buildings and the New York in the 80s,

1395
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:05,600
just just like a construction guy,
whatever.

1396
01:19:05,601 --> 01:19:08,690
He needs a new lung that was on a lung
transplant list from all that shit.

1397
01:19:08,691 --> 01:19:12,350
Just don't put shit in the garbage and
destroying all ripping off walls and

1398
01:19:12,351 --> 01:19:15,470
stuff like that. Well, you know,
Donna summer died from lung cancer,

1399
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:19,400
I'm pretty sure, and she died because
she lived near where the towers fell.

1400
01:19:20,020 --> 01:19:23,390
A lot of people that live where the towers
fell, including a lot of the firemen,

1401
01:19:23,420 --> 01:19:27,740
a lot of the, like a lot of the,
uh, the people that rescued people,

1402
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:32,120
EMT officers, all the, all the
people that worked in that area.

1403
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:36,080
There's a lot of people who got sick
and Donna summer apparently lived,

1404
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:39,080
she had an apartment that was pretty
close to that area and just the shit that

1405
01:19:39,081 --> 01:19:43,640
was in the air. I mean you could only
imagine a giant fucking building.

1406
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:46,330
That's what it was. It a hundred stories
or something like that collapses.

1407
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,110
Another one collapses right next to it.

1408
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,970
All the fucking Dustin Shit
that my building that's
built in the early seventies

1409
01:19:52,971 --> 01:19:54,830
so they,
I'm sure to use this past us and,

1410
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:57,890
but then of course I was
at EPA or something came in
and they have to like the

1411
01:19:57,891 --> 01:19:59,600
third day said he air quality's fine,

1412
01:19:59,640 --> 01:20:02,930
it's harmless tooth and everybody just
worked there and just hung out and they

1413
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:06,410
charity work and should always down there
doing some helping move boxes and shit

1414
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:07,990
like that. Cause they're all
right. I guess it'd be arrows.

1415
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,820
Okay.

1416
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:09,990
All those first two drivers,

1417
01:20:09,991 --> 01:20:14,670
all the people like the EMT people and
the fire people and a lot of those guys

1418
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:16,710
get sick.
A lot of cops got sick.

1419
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,980
A lot of people that live there that
try to come back early, they got sick.

1420
01:20:20,790 --> 01:20:22,880
It just only makes sense.
I mean you,

1421
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:27,450
you're not going to have spring fresh
air went to enormous buildings fall.

1422
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:31,630
So that just got declassified the other
day. Did you going to? If there's any new,

1423
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:33,760
some of it,
but there's still a lot missing.

1424
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:37,670
The nine 11 reports. Yeah.
What do you think happened?

1425
01:20:38,420 --> 01:20:41,420
I think exactly what they tell
us exactly what they tell us.

1426
01:20:41,421 --> 01:20:44,180
Pretty much two dudes in box
cutters took over an airplane,

1427
01:20:44,190 --> 01:20:48,920
flew into the twin towers. What do
you think happened? Pretty close.

1428
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:54,770
I think most likely. Almost
exactly like their talent. US,

1429
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:59,000
except for,
well,

1430
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,120
I think they capitalized on an event and
I think that's why it looks like they

1431
01:21:05,121 --> 01:21:05,954
set it up.

1432
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:10,430
I think that's why one of the reasons
why people have so much of a vested

1433
01:21:10,431 --> 01:21:14,150
interest in like trying to prove some
sort of conspiracy with the government and

1434
01:21:14,151 --> 01:21:17,180
nine 11 it's cause there's so much
profit that was made off those wars,

1435
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:18,590
especially the warder Iraq.

1436
01:21:19,100 --> 01:21:24,100
That's the forget about like what
happened at nine 11 and who caused that.

1437
01:21:24,710 --> 01:21:28,160
But it's the reaction to not 11
that's the craziest thing ever.

1438
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:32,210
The craziest thing is how we just
decided to go to war with Iraq, you know,

1439
01:21:32,211 --> 01:21:33,710
country that had nothing to do with it.

1440
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:36,800
And then how Burton's getting
these billion dollar contracts,

1441
01:21:36,801 --> 01:21:40,640
they're blowing shit up left and
right and like that's, that's,

1442
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:43,070
that had nothing to do
at nine 11 like theirs.

1443
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:48,350
That's like someone in
like Marina del Rey,

1444
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:52,310
you know, picking a fight with
you. So you knew Canada or, yeah,

1445
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:55,580
it's really that fucked up.
It doesn't make any sense at all.

1446
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,110
They're totally different countries.

1447
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:02,380
Totally unrelated and that's the most
fucked up thing about it is what they

1448
01:22:02,901 --> 01:22:06,050
definitely did.
Like the idea that it was planned,

1449
01:22:06,051 --> 01:22:09,530
that it was like they flew through
that that's like so complicated.

1450
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,500
Like I don't know if they really
are even capable of doing that.

1451
01:22:12,530 --> 01:22:16,520
I don't know if there's a group in the
highest levels of government that's

1452
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:19,730
capable of hiring so many
people to keep their mouth shut.

1453
01:22:19,730 --> 01:22:22,790
So many people to engineer this thing
where you got to fly planes and the

1454
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:25,490
building's going to,
are there people with box cutters?

1455
01:22:25,491 --> 01:22:27,680
Are there Saudi guys that are
on those planes? Are they,

1456
01:22:27,681 --> 01:22:30,320
are they a fucking Hologram?
How you cover all that?

1457
01:22:30,350 --> 01:22:31,790
How do you cover the news story?

1458
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:33,770
How do you make sure that
nobody keeps her mouth shut?

1459
01:22:33,771 --> 01:22:37,040
How do you make sure that
no bad motherfucker on the
plane doesn't Chuck Norris,

1460
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:39,890
these fucking terrorist dudes in
the head and take over the plane.

1461
01:22:39,891 --> 01:22:41,480
How do you stop all that from happening?

1462
01:22:41,750 --> 01:22:45,470
Because it seems to me that like
it would be a lot of fucking,

1463
01:22:45,471 --> 01:22:46,610
people would have to be involved

1464
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:49,750
and one person's going to talk.
Absolutely. One's going to fucking talk.

1465
01:22:50,130 --> 01:22:52,780
Wired that building for explosives.
Nobody saw him coming in.

1466
01:22:52,781 --> 01:22:55,560
There's no video of anybody in
at two o'clock in the morning.

1467
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:58,990
What about the janitor that mops up
didn't see some guys cause they say,

1468
01:22:58,991 --> 01:23:03,100
you know they had, the way it came
down, it had to be explosives inside.

1469
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:05,920
Yeah. The the one that's
crazy. Tower seven.

1470
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,270
That's the crazy one because that was
the one that wasn't hit by a plane. Yeah,

1471
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:11,910
but what,
what freaks me out is not that,

1472
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:18,000
that they had to have explosives to
des to detonate a building and make it

1473
01:23:18,311 --> 01:23:19,450
collapse like that.
That doesn't,

1474
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,690
I don't buy that because I don't think
we've ever seen a fucking building that

1475
01:23:22,691 --> 01:23:26,920
big collapse. Like how do you know
once it starts going like first of all,

1476
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:31,960
what about the possibility that they
used shitty engineering and terrible

1477
01:23:31,961 --> 01:23:36,250
fucking concrete and the unions were
involved and they fucking half assed that

1478
01:23:36,251 --> 01:23:39,040
giant building and it fell
apart when a plane hit it.

1479
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:43,120
That seems like the more likely
scenario put that tower seven,

1480
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:46,750
which just goes like this [inaudible]
that's the one that's the most crazy cause

1481
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:51,280
it looks like an implosion but
apparently it was on fire and apparently,

1482
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:54,160
you know the, the entire building
had like some sort of, uh,

1483
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:59,610
underneath the basement they had
some sort of a diesel generator.

1484
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:03,220
So they had these giant drums of
diesel and it all caught on fire.

1485
01:24:03,221 --> 01:24:07,630
So it was a raging inferno inside the
building and some people think that

1486
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:09,970
compromise the steel and
made it collapse like that.

1487
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:12,430
But it looks like a fucking
controlled demolition.

1488
01:24:12,460 --> 01:24:15,890
That's the one that really looks like
it. Yeah. Twin Towers look like the,

1489
01:24:16,030 --> 01:24:19,270
the top fell off and the whole
thing just exploded from the weight.

1490
01:24:19,271 --> 01:24:22,840
And when you see all those buildings
that are shooting out that they say is

1491
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:26,410
reminiscent of explosions.
Yes.

1492
01:24:26,411 --> 01:24:31,060
But you know that the top of the building
is coming down and crushing all those

1493
01:24:31,061 --> 01:24:34,450
floors. Right? That's how the thing is
getting crushed. Right. What is that?

1494
01:24:34,451 --> 01:24:38,320
That's pressure. I would happen to me or
pressure windows explode. That's that.

1495
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:39,071
Everyone knows that.

1496
01:24:39,071 --> 01:24:42,880
So if you slow something down and you're
showing these windows exploding because

1497
01:24:42,881 --> 01:24:46,360
the top is collapsing in the building and
you're saying that's evidence of bombs.

1498
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,850
No, it's not. No, it's not.

1499
01:24:48,851 --> 01:24:52,600
It's evidence of explosions that are
happening because of compression.

1500
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,430
There's a lot of things
going on in that building.

1501
01:24:54,431 --> 01:24:55,960
That building is fucking collapsing.

1502
01:24:55,961 --> 01:25:00,820
It's fucking billions of pounds of
metal and concrete and it's all falling

1503
01:25:00,821 --> 01:25:01,420
apart.

1504
01:25:01,420 --> 01:25:04,900
Like you looking at these little slow
motion things and saying that's definitely

1505
01:25:04,901 --> 01:25:08,440
bombs. It's not definitely
bumps. It could be bombs,

1506
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,420
not definitely bombs though.

1507
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:13,300
It's more likely that that
fucking buildings falling apart.

1508
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:14,790
Supposedly when they built it,

1509
01:25:14,791 --> 01:25:17,940
they had it where I was going to come
straight down if there was ever out of a

1510
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:19,890
hurricane or something like that earlier.
Yeah,

1511
01:25:19,891 --> 01:25:22,770
that's what I remember reading a
seen a documentary on the trip.

1512
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:25,330
The trade centers getting
built in case dead,

1513
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:28,710
didn't want to just fall over and
wipe out six streets. That is smart.

1514
01:25:28,711 --> 01:25:31,570
If you said a belt, it like that
in case something does come Kinda,

1515
01:25:31,890 --> 01:25:35,130
you know like yeah, big hurricane or an
earthquake came, it would just wipe out,

1516
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:37,830
you know, a bunch of blocks
and they built it like that.

1517
01:25:37,831 --> 01:25:40,980
That would fall straight down like that.
I don't know how they did it,

1518
01:25:40,981 --> 01:25:43,650
but I mean that's, that's what
they said in a document. The Guy,

1519
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:46,090
the guys who documentary.

1520
01:25:46,090 --> 01:25:50,410
Because could you imagine if that plane
slamming into the building caused that

1521
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:55,240
designed to kick into effect and
that's why I collapsed either way,

1522
01:25:55,241 --> 01:25:56,050
man.

1523
01:25:56,050 --> 01:26:01,050
That's the only time in our lives and
in the history of the continental United

1524
01:26:01,510 --> 01:26:03,650
States. It's been attacked. You know,

1525
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:07,340
that's one of the most fucked up things
about us in comparison to the rest of

1526
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:11,420
the world. Everybody's been
attacked a fucking million. I mean,

1527
01:26:11,421 --> 01:26:15,260
just look at all the shit that's
happened in Mexico just in Mexico.

1528
01:26:15,380 --> 01:26:19,040
Just fucking Cortez coming over here and
kill him like a fucking million people.

1529
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:21,860
All the crazy as techs that
were killing me. I mean,

1530
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:25,640
there's a lot of attacks and invasions
and shit happened just in Mexico.

1531
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:29,240
Germany's been fucking attacked.
Russia has been attacked.

1532
01:26:29,450 --> 01:26:33,020
Everybody's been attacked. England's
been hit with bombs from the Nazis.

1533
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:34,460
Everybody got attacked.

1534
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:38,930
Their spots and France are so fucked up
to this day that you can't go in him for

1535
01:26:38,931 --> 01:26:40,250
like a hundred thousand years.

1536
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:44,600
They have like a red zone when they have
this fenced up zone and France real all

1537
01:26:44,610 --> 01:26:45,620
from the munitions,

1538
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:50,120
all from unexploded munitions and
the toxins just from World War II.

1539
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:54,230
Dude, it's nuts. Pull, pull up
that article too because it just,

1540
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:58,970
it was a recent article, photos of
Francis Red Zone. It was amazing.

1541
01:26:58,971 --> 01:27:00,530
I sent it to Dan Carlin,

1542
01:27:00,531 --> 01:27:04,010
who is this guy who has his podcast
called hardcore history and he's got this

1543
01:27:04,011 --> 01:27:07,760
insane series on world war one and
how fucked up world war one was.

1544
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,860
And this is a part of that,
like this,

1545
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:13,790
this all these munitions and
all those bomb shit. If it's a,

1546
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:18,410
it's an area the size of Paris and you
can't even go near it. Wow. You find it?

1547
01:27:18,740 --> 01:27:20,750
Check this shit out.
It's fucking nuts, man.

1548
01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:27,300
This is all from the war and
it's, well, this is like, there's,

1549
01:27:27,301 --> 01:27:32,220
there's really good pictures of the
actual place. What's that? Yeah. Right.

1550
01:27:32,221 --> 01:27:35,550
It looks like a Zombie movie. Yeah.
Yeah. He can't go anywhere near it.

1551
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:40,620
There's like a fence and then inside
that fence it's fucking no man's land.

1552
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:44,550
You just can't get in there.
They bombed that place literally to hell.

1553
01:27:45,060 --> 01:27:46,650
And they had all these, and
look at that, look at all,

1554
01:27:46,651 --> 01:27:49,760
this is all the shit they're
finding their, they have these, uh,

1555
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:53,580
animals that live there. And they did
tests on the animals, like the wild hogs.

1556
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,070
And they,
they were filled with toxins.

1557
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,240
All these horrible fucking
chemicals from these explosives,

1558
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:02,880
explosives and what did explode,

1559
01:28:02,881 --> 01:28:07,320
what leaked into the soil and they used
gas and I mean this is a nutty fucking

1560
01:28:07,321 --> 01:28:11,640
time. Look it fucking bombs.
They foul just laying in a field.

1561
01:28:14,410 --> 01:28:18,190
That was when war was war man.
This Dan Carlin thing,

1562
01:28:18,191 --> 01:28:20,440
if you don't know anything
about World War One,

1563
01:28:20,441 --> 01:28:22,070
I didn't know shit about world war one.

1564
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:26,380
This this Dan Carlin piece
that he's got right now.

1565
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:31,740
It's amazing if you've never listened to
hardcore history is the best podcast on

1566
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:33,820
on history. Yeah, it's amazing.

1567
01:28:34,540 --> 01:28:39,460
And he's got this incredible piece
on a World War One. That's that.

1568
01:28:39,461 --> 01:28:42,400
He just finished,
I think the last episode he just released.

1569
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:46,090
What a fucking nutty time dude.
That was just a hundred years ago.

1570
01:28:48,050 --> 01:28:51,650
These people were fighting in trenches
and shooting at each other from over the

1571
01:28:51,651 --> 01:28:56,560
hills.
What's really crazy is they,

1572
01:28:56,650 --> 01:28:58,870
these people in World
War one in particular,

1573
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:02,490
they were still wearing like the brightly
colored that people were in the 18

1574
01:29:02,491 --> 01:29:06,930
hundreds because they were in like
their grandfathers fucking battle ladder

1575
01:29:06,931 --> 01:29:10,800
battle outfits. They had outfits
that were essentially like targets,

1576
01:29:10,801 --> 01:29:15,000
like white gloves and white hats and they
didn't have any helmets and they were

1577
01:29:15,001 --> 01:29:17,160
walking it all walk,
just walk,

1578
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,670
just walk in and fucking shooting people
and then people would shoot back and

1579
01:29:20,970 --> 01:29:25,440
they dig a hole and cry and scream.
And that's how they did war.

1580
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:29,100
Fucking nuts, man down. And if it
wasn't for them, we wouldn't be here.

1581
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:33,510
Salou God blessed those fine warriors.
Accomplice

1582
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:38,550
fucked right. God blessed the
troops cut. Y'All fucked does that,

1583
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:43,260
that that just a hundred years ago it was
how they did war. This, this piece is a,

1584
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:44,280
the hardcore history thing.

1585
01:29:44,281 --> 01:29:48,060
He talks about the Germans inventing
these new guns that were so powerful.

1586
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:51,240
They used to have to plug up their ears,
they'd plug up their nose,

1587
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:56,570
they would back up 300 yards and when
the thing went off you still had to have

1588
01:29:56,611 --> 01:29:59,670
your mouth open or it'll
blow out your eardrums.

1589
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,720
So they're packing their packing their
nose, they're packing their ears,

1590
01:30:03,721 --> 01:30:05,040
they're plugging up everything.

1591
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:09,570
And you still have to have your mouth
open when it goes off 300 yards away from

1592
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:11,520
you.
Cause the reverberation,

1593
01:30:11,521 --> 01:30:14,940
the sound is so powerful that it
literally will blow your eardrums open.

1594
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:22,130
And so they were shooting these fucking
Volkswagen bus size bullets at a,

1595
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:26,220
the people on the other side of forget
who they were shooting them amount.

1596
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:30,210
I forget which country it was they first
used it on but it would just obliterate

1597
01:30:30,211 --> 01:30:32,760
with one bullet it would
obliterate like 70 people.

1598
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:36,330
One bullet would just take out 70 people
and they were like, what the fuck?

1599
01:30:36,570 --> 01:30:41,160
Before then it was like bullets
[inaudible] at a time share hall,

1600
01:30:41,250 --> 01:30:41,791
you should have me,

1601
01:30:41,791 --> 01:30:45,450
I should have you Viva La France and you
can fucking went out there and then the

1602
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:47,430
Germans took shit to the next level.

1603
01:30:47,640 --> 01:30:52,640
They had this huge gun that they used
to have like tanks would pull it and it

1604
01:30:53,071 --> 01:30:53,904
was enormous.

1605
01:30:53,970 --> 01:30:58,800
You're talking about this huge cannon of
a weapon and then they had figured out

1606
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:00,240
the distance,
like they had to figure it out,

1607
01:31:00,241 --> 01:31:01,620
but like they would launch one bullet,

1608
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:04,740
figure out where you were and they
would lower the gun. A little launch.

1609
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:07,250
A second bullet is nothing you could do,
couldn't get away.

1610
01:31:07,251 --> 01:31:08,790
It's things shooting you from miles away.

1611
01:31:12,400 --> 01:31:15,560
Were you watching that Dallas
footage the other night? The uh,

1612
01:31:15,790 --> 01:31:16,750
what do you mean a gunman?

1613
01:31:17,090 --> 01:31:20,120
No, I heard briefly
about it. What happened?

1614
01:31:20,150 --> 01:31:21,980
Some guy went nutty and shot at the cops.

1615
01:31:22,060 --> 01:31:26,580
Yeah, he got a armored car. Our
van off of uh, looks like Ebay,

1616
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:28,950
somebody found the other
day, the auction listing. Uh,

1617
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:31,840
and it was just completely armored
and he was just shooting and stuff.

1618
01:31:31,841 --> 01:31:34,840
But one crazy thing is if you,
Jamie, if you look at my Twitter,

1619
01:31:34,841 --> 01:31:37,180
I posted this video of a,

1620
01:31:37,630 --> 01:31:41,080
of a guy named Scoota
underscored juice man.

1621
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,070
And he was filming on the street
when this was happening. The Guy,

1622
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:49,060
I'm the armored car was just shooting
at cops hitting cop cars and stuff like

1623
01:31:49,061 --> 01:31:51,880
that. And he had planted all these
pipe bombs throughout the city.

1624
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:53,710
It was like grand theft auto is nuts,

1625
01:31:53,980 --> 01:31:58,180
but this guy was shooting like filming
it and a bullet you could hear wizard

1626
01:31:58,181 --> 01:31:59,200
right by his head

1627
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,540
is so intense.
Oh my God.

1628
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:09,370
Fuck that. So do you remember that
North Hollywood shootout? Yeah. Yeah.

1629
01:32:09,371 --> 01:32:10,550
I was here for that.
Yeah,

1630
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,540
we were on the set of news radio
and we all huddled up in the,

1631
01:32:13,590 --> 01:32:17,860
in the break room and watching on
television. We were like, what the fuck?

1632
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:21,610
Watching these two dudes with full
armor on and machine guns and shit just

1633
01:32:21,611 --> 01:32:23,650
fucking gun down cops.
Did you remember that?

1634
01:32:24,670 --> 01:32:27,840
That wasn't the scene that they'd kind
of recreated from the movie heat. Yeah.

1635
01:32:27,870 --> 01:32:31,000
Yeah. That was the inspiration of it.
Holy Shit. Yeah. That really happened.

1636
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:35,710
It was called the north Hollywood shootout
to just maniacs to crazy dudes all

1637
01:32:35,711 --> 01:32:40,210
fucked up on drugs out of their
mind and just arm to the Dick.

1638
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:45,280
Just their trunk was stuff and cops
had like regular service revolvers and

1639
01:32:45,281 --> 01:32:47,710
you're like, what am I going to do with
a fucking nine millimeter against these?

1640
01:32:48,010 --> 01:32:51,880
I mean, what's going on here? And some
were just so under gunned. So, um,

1641
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:55,270
I think they changed out
shitload of laws after that too.

1642
01:32:55,271 --> 01:32:58,680
About like how much machine
guns you could have right now.

1643
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:02,710
What happens when he starts stockpile
and that kind of ammo and bulletproof

1644
01:33:02,711 --> 01:33:06,070
vests and shit. He said I was pretty
much kind of the scene from that movie.

1645
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:10,470
He thinks that was the inspiration for it.
Is this a the new one?

1646
01:33:12,670 --> 01:33:15,160
Oh, this is north Hollywood.
Yeah. Okay. So these dudes,

1647
01:33:15,670 --> 01:33:20,110
they have full on bulletproof vests,

1648
01:33:20,290 --> 01:33:21,190
the whole deal.

1649
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:25,690
They like wearing military
garb and then they,

1650
01:33:26,110 --> 01:33:30,100
they have the trunk open and
inside the car it's all guns.

1651
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:34,540
It's all guns and bullets.
And this dude is like,

1652
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:37,300
he's all armored essentially.

1653
01:33:37,301 --> 01:33:42,301
And so he's shooting at these cops and
you know the cops are fucked there.

1654
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,710
They're hiding, they're
waiting for backup. But it was,

1655
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:47,500
it was really scary because
these guys are kind of idiots.

1656
01:33:47,710 --> 01:33:50,560
And it makes you think like if someone
who really knew what the fuck they were

1657
01:33:50,561 --> 01:33:54,060
doing, like some real tactical guys
like seals or something like that,

1658
01:33:54,061 --> 01:33:55,840
or they went nutty and decided to do this,

1659
01:33:55,841 --> 01:33:59,920
you wouldn't need a large group
in order to shut entire city down.

1660
01:34:00,190 --> 01:34:03,560
My friend Justin talks about this
all the time cause he knows like a,

1661
01:34:03,561 --> 01:34:06,160
a lot of people in special ops
and all those, he's kind of a,

1662
01:34:06,400 --> 01:34:10,270
he would call himself on a firearms
enthusiast. I call him a gun nut.

1663
01:34:10,900 --> 01:34:15,460
He's definitely a gun nut. But if you
had a bunch of dudes that were like,

1664
01:34:15,461 --> 01:34:20,290
really, I'm really good at
killing people like this.

1665
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:24,490
And you just brought in 20 of them,
they shut up, shut the entire city down.

1666
01:34:24,590 --> 01:34:26,800
Absolute like,
where was this dis on Hollywood boulevard.

1667
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:29,410
Now this is in north Hollywood.
What's happening here?

1668
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,340
How come we're not seeing
anybody? Shouldn't that anybody
yet? It's guys are lazy.

1669
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:39,050
Come on man. Okay, here it goes.

1670
01:34:39,380 --> 01:34:41,960
So now there he's just
running and shooting at cops.

1671
01:34:42,730 --> 01:34:43,563
Right?

1672
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:47,940
I love these.
It's wolf blitz or reporting on the news.

1673
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,430
We'll throw it and we're its way
here and see what happens. Oh,

1674
01:34:50,431 --> 01:34:54,230
that's Tom Wolf Blitzer. Uh,
obviously an a was here on this one.

1675
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:56,530
Sounds a little wolfish.
Yeah, definitely. Was

1676
01:34:57,090 --> 01:35:00,960
quite a radically possibly a wouldn't
suspect at this point. And uh,

1677
01:35:00,990 --> 01:35:02,400
we're keeping an eye on this right now.

1678
01:35:02,401 --> 01:35:05,030
Let me just take a quick look back
over to the right as the situation.

1679
01:35:05,240 --> 01:35:08,190
Yeah, I think that's dean. If
you've got a shot. I think so.

1680
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:17,770
I think that guy is dead right? The guy
in the car. That's why he's rolling. Oh,

1681
01:35:17,771 --> 01:35:19,870
he's hurt.
I forget what happened,

1682
01:35:19,871 --> 01:35:23,970
but I remember the cops let him bleed
out and people were saying that, uh,

1683
01:35:24,340 --> 01:35:29,080
it was cruel that the cops didn't call
the ambulances and and have this guy

1684
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:34,240
taking care of the risk, their own lives
to do so to get this guy to, oh wait.

1685
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:37,480
Well he just took off
staple this thing shut.

1686
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:39,353
Okay.

1687
01:35:39,740 --> 01:35:44,690
Like can a reason that John Wick movie?
Yeah. Yeah. Did you see that movie?

1688
01:35:44,730 --> 01:35:46,350
Yeah.
It's fucking good movie man.

1689
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:49,100
I watched on a plane coming
back from Mexico this weekend.

1690
01:35:49,220 --> 01:35:52,850
It's a fucking bad ass movies. You see
loss road yet? No, that was the best.

1691
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:54,440
Like as far as like action movie,

1692
01:35:54,441 --> 01:35:57,920
that was the best action movie I've
seen in a long time. It was bad ass.

1693
01:35:57,950 --> 01:36:02,090
What's it called? John Wick. It's kind
of matrix. It was pretty good. Well,

1694
01:36:02,091 --> 01:36:03,350
it's not about the matrix at all.

1695
01:36:03,351 --> 01:36:08,120
It's about his hit man who these Russian
mobsters fuck with them and he decides

1696
01:36:08,121 --> 01:36:09,710
to go after them and kill them all.

1697
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:13,160
It's just the gratuitous violence
level is off the fucking chain.

1698
01:36:13,170 --> 01:36:17,480
You got to check it out like murders
that counter Reeves does in this movie.

1699
01:36:17,481 --> 01:36:18,314
It's insane.

1700
01:36:18,470 --> 01:36:21,320
I mean I've never seen the guy killed
more people in a movie and do it.

1701
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:23,750
It was fun to watch like the
way he was doing it was bad ass.

1702
01:36:23,751 --> 01:36:28,430
It was all most believable, you know,
like the way they had it set up,

1703
01:36:28,431 --> 01:36:30,170
everything that was like
really tight quarters.

1704
01:36:30,171 --> 01:36:31,970
It wasn't like a retard wagon train.

1705
01:36:31,971 --> 01:36:34,590
When they have a bunch of guys coming
out and somehow or another he managed to

1706
01:36:34,591 --> 01:36:38,780
survive. You kind of buy it pretty much
every step of the way. Like you know,

1707
01:36:38,781 --> 01:36:41,240
there's not a real person who
is that accurate with a gun.

1708
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:45,950
But if it's a video game, you
know this, this could be possible.

1709
01:36:46,610 --> 01:36:49,160
There was no scene where you
go, it doesn't, how is it
going to get out of this?

1710
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:53,030
It was one, there was one. They
kind of gave you a way out.

1711
01:36:53,031 --> 01:36:56,760
The kind of made sense. Good
enough. Good enough. Cause the,

1712
01:36:56,761 --> 01:37:00,530
the gratuitous violence and the action
teens really make you want to go be a

1713
01:37:00,610 --> 01:37:03,020
hitman. You want to just go
fuck people. It's a fun movie.

1714
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:07,910
It's a wild fucking movie.
I heard the Jurassic Park movie sucked.

1715
01:37:08,330 --> 01:37:12,530
I heard it was okay. Yeah, but I, it looks
good. I, I'm sure I heard it was dumb.

1716
01:37:13,880 --> 01:37:16,400
Do you see it? I saw it. It's really
fun. Do you like everything though?

1717
01:37:16,730 --> 01:37:20,570
It's trying to take funds. Last thing you
don't like. Ah, I see plenty of movies.

1718
01:37:20,571 --> 01:37:25,140
I don't like getting one pitch perfect.
Two loves it. Loved it. Five to six hours.

1719
01:37:25,260 --> 01:37:28,240
One uh, no I did not hurt. It
was hard. It was enjoyable.

1720
01:37:28,330 --> 01:37:31,160
But I wanted to say what you were
talking about the twin towers before the

1721
01:37:31,161 --> 01:37:33,440
drastic world movie cause
it's in three d imax.

1722
01:37:33,710 --> 01:37:36,470
They showed the trailer for this
new movie with Jason Joseph.

1723
01:37:36,471 --> 01:37:38,570
Gordon Levitt about this French,

1724
01:37:39,120 --> 01:37:41,990
a tight rope walker that went between
the twin towers in the 70s and eight

1725
01:37:41,991 --> 01:37:45,390
recreated 1974 Manhattan.
Whoa.

1726
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:50,120
We created the twin towers and it looked
awesome. It freaked the shit out of you.

1727
01:37:50,121 --> 01:37:50,954
I'll show you a picture.

1728
01:37:53,170 --> 01:37:56,170
Is it all CGI?
Oh goodness.

1729
01:37:56,290 --> 01:37:57,430
Gravity s kind of

1730
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:01,240
recreation of this whole scenario.
Just the like where the

1731
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:03,480
trailer starts out. I want
to ruin it for you. Even now.

1732
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:07,500
You need to see it because it was awesome.
I know. I need to see it right now.

1733
01:38:07,920 --> 01:38:12,270
Have show that shit.
Fuck.

1734
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:17,130
Or imax. It's three D as
well. That's quite all right.

1735
01:38:17,150 --> 01:38:21,390
All right. I can get the idea.
This is insane. It's so cool.

1736
01:38:21,391 --> 01:38:25,860
What they can do right now with CGI,
unless that's on a window washers,

1737
01:38:26,220 --> 01:38:30,450
cart, but just shooting it up to the top.
It's the trade center. It's gone, right?

1738
01:38:31,440 --> 01:38:33,480
Yeah. Good point. So this is all fake.

1739
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:41,470
It's amazing. Come on. That's
incredible. That's all fake.

1740
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,470
Oh my God.
My fucking heart hurts.

1741
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:50,920
That view is insane.
Oh my God.

1742
01:38:50,921 --> 01:38:53,800
I'm literally freaking out
and my hands are sweating.

1743
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:57,340
My toes won't stop twitching.
He's killed.

1744
01:39:03,470 --> 01:39:07,790
So He's standing on top of the twin
tower and you get to see what the fucking

1745
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:12,791
drop looks like in homeboy is now
standing on an I beam poking out over the

1746
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:20,090
edge. I don't think I can watch this.
Can you might do this in three Oh my God.

1747
01:39:20,091 --> 01:39:22,660
I can't even imagine what I'm seeing.
My own face.

1748
01:39:24,730 --> 01:39:28,610
This man, his balance. That's,

1749
01:39:29,860 --> 01:39:32,950
Oh, is it Jesus Christ? Boy,

1750
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,580
I'm having a really hard
time watching him. Fuck.

1751
01:39:39,910 --> 01:39:44,020
That has to be like one of the
freakiest. Oh, you son of a bitch.

1752
01:39:44,500 --> 01:39:49,120
He's standing on one foot. What do you
mean a yoga master? Cagle oh my God.

1753
01:39:49,121 --> 01:39:52,690
In Three d and Imax Three D.
Ah,

1754
01:39:52,691 --> 01:39:54,250
that's why I want a trailer.

1755
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:57,583
The walk.

1756
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:04,210
How crazy is that? That we give a fuck
that he died, died. Did he? Does that?

1757
01:40:04,900 --> 01:40:05,470
I mean,

1758
01:40:05,470 --> 01:40:10,000
if he walked a tight rope and that type
rope was six inches off the ground,

1759
01:40:10,001 --> 01:40:13,570
you would not give a shit. Nope.
No one would see it. Sweaty palms.

1760
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:16,360
But because he is a hundred stories up,

1761
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:21,010
you know that he's fighting every
single instinct, every natural instinct.

1762
01:40:21,011 --> 01:40:22,810
The body has to get the
fuck away from danger.

1763
01:40:23,410 --> 01:40:25,210
Fuck that notices in the French guy.

1764
01:40:25,211 --> 01:40:28,990
Is it that they did doc documentary
a few years ago back? Yeah. Okay.

1765
01:40:29,290 --> 01:40:30,011
It's the same movie.
Yeah.

1766
01:40:30,011 --> 01:40:33,780
It was a documentary about this guy that
had the footage of him fought from afar,

1767
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:37,060
but I didn't want to start a
recent one with the family. Those,

1768
01:40:37,070 --> 01:40:40,840
the family where the one guy with a
lenders, is that what they are? One,

1769
01:40:40,841 --> 01:40:44,200
one of them died and they still do it
like the mother and the son did it and

1770
01:40:44,201 --> 01:40:49,090
they passed each other on the
rope. What the fuck man? You know?

1771
01:40:49,091 --> 01:40:53,860
I mean what kind of a way to make a
living is that I think you find out I'd be

1772
01:40:53,861 --> 01:40:54,160
pissed

1773
01:40:54,160 --> 01:40:56,980
at my dad if that's what he did.
Now I got to follow in your footsteps.

1774
01:40:57,010 --> 01:41:00,610
How good do you think you could get? Do
you ever think you could get good enough?

1775
01:41:00,611 --> 01:41:03,460
Like maybe it's just us.
Maybe we look at that and go,

1776
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:06,890
look, man, it ain't hard. It's
just we don't know how to do it.

1777
01:41:07,730 --> 01:41:11,120
You know what I mean? Right. Like
if, if, if you got really good,

1778
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:14,720
can you get good enough to a point where
you could walk on one of those things

1779
01:41:14,721 --> 01:41:19,100
with 100% certainty that you're not going
to fall? Is that possible? Because look,

1780
01:41:19,101 --> 01:41:23,450
if I got, if I made you a
road across the Grand Canyon,

1781
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:25,430
but the road was only
as wide as this table,

1782
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:30,560
I could walk it and I would not like it.
I'd freak out the entire way.

1783
01:41:30,561 --> 01:41:31,430
I try to stay calm,

1784
01:41:31,431 --> 01:41:35,090
but if there's no wind and I knew that
the road was his as wide as this table,

1785
01:41:35,270 --> 01:41:38,690
I'm 100% confident that I'd be able to
suck it up and make it to the other side.

1786
01:41:38,990 --> 01:41:41,780
When I got to the side, I'd
probably be like, what the fuck?

1787
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:44,300
I'd probably be freaking out. How
long do you think it would take? Yeah.

1788
01:41:44,840 --> 01:41:47,240
I don't know how far the the walk is.
How far is the walk?

1789
01:41:47,241 --> 01:41:51,690
I wouldn't rush it a couple of
hours. I wouldn't rush it. Yeah,

1790
01:41:52,130 --> 01:41:55,910
you wouldn't walk fast. I would not.
No, I would not. I would be fucking,

1791
01:41:56,870 --> 01:41:58,010
I'll do it as a meditation.

1792
01:41:58,040 --> 01:42:01,970
I would try to concentrate entirely on
my breath and each footstep and just keep

1793
01:42:01,971 --> 01:42:04,010
my balance good and stay calm.

1794
01:42:04,180 --> 01:42:07,360
You put a table like I could get in this
fucking table right now and I would,

1795
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:08,990
I'll tell you right now,
never fall.

1796
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:13,130
I will never fall standing up on this
table if, unless I slip on something.

1797
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:15,710
You know what I'm saying? But if I'm
standing on this table right now,

1798
01:42:15,740 --> 01:42:19,670
there's no way this is a flat
thing. It's very wide. I'd be fine.

1799
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:24,590
And I could walk across the table with
what certainty. Oh, 100% certainty.

1800
01:42:24,591 --> 01:42:27,980
Unless there's something really wrong
with my body or I'm that fucking drunk.

1801
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,330
If I had a gamble,

1802
01:42:29,331 --> 01:42:32,510
I would be 100% certain that I could
walk across the length of this table.

1803
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:36,080
But if you made it a mile long and
you put it over the Grand Canyon,

1804
01:42:37,190 --> 01:42:38,360
that's where shit gets weird.

1805
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:42,320
You think you'd have to sit down at some
point cause you're like freaking out

1806
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:45,920
maybe. But at the point is that
anybody can walk on this fucking table.

1807
01:42:45,921 --> 01:42:46,880
We all know how to walk.

1808
01:42:47,020 --> 01:42:49,510
Do you think you can get good
enough at walking on a tight rope?

1809
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:53,650
That it's almost like this table,
you know,

1810
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:56,270
as far as like the probabilities,
but someone can, right.

1811
01:42:56,780 --> 01:42:59,690
I mean there has to be someone out there
like if you watch those Cirque de Solei

1812
01:42:59,691 --> 01:43:03,170
fuckers, they can do shit that doesn't
seem like she'd be able to do it.

1813
01:43:03,710 --> 01:43:04,970
They can do stuff with their bodies.

1814
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:08,060
Like I saw one guy and
he was pressing one guy.

1815
01:43:08,061 --> 01:43:11,870
The other guy was doing a handstand
with one hand holding this guy's hand.

1816
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:15,920
So this guy's got a hand and another guy's
doing a handstand and maybe they were

1817
01:43:15,921 --> 01:43:17,620
using two hands and they were holding,

1818
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:20,330
the guy was doing a handstand on the
other guy's hands. They're standing up,

1819
01:43:20,331 --> 01:43:22,880
it's fucking ridiculous. Who the fuck
do you know that you can do that?

1820
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:25,610
Does anybody know anybody
that can do that? No.

1821
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:29,330
Unless you know a Cirque de Solei
dude or a Cirque de Solei Gal,

1822
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:35,300
but even they fuck up every now and then
like one dropped a at the MGM couple of

1823
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:39,770
years ago, right? Wasn't
it? It's super risky. You're
watching that Cirque de Solei.

1824
01:43:40,570 --> 01:43:43,720
Yeah, I've seen it. I just went to like
a local circus in the middle of a field.

1825
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:47,470
I took my son last week and these people
are in that with no wires and shit.

1826
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,090
Like what the fuck are they doing

1827
01:43:51,010 --> 01:43:52,210
there?
Earn and son.

1828
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:53,390
There's about, yeah. What did it get?

1829
01:43:53,391 --> 01:43:56,210
There's like there's like a hundred of
them and it doesn't only like 30 people

1830
01:43:56,211 --> 01:43:58,920
in the crowd. I'm like, what are
these people getting paid? Yeah,

1831
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,050
they're doing two shows.

1832
01:44:00,051 --> 01:44:03,710
The next show has like a hundred people
going from town to town and they're

1833
01:44:03,711 --> 01:44:07,510
swinging off these ropes. I'm like,
it's a weird middle. Make a living man.

1834
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,380
But that was like the Carney was like the,

1835
01:44:10,390 --> 01:44:15,390
there was a classic character in like
movies and stories and most people knew

1836
01:44:15,651 --> 01:44:19,490
about the traveling people that would go
from town to town. And these carnival,

1837
01:44:19,540 --> 01:44:24,050
there's set up carnivals, they're
all dangerous and shit and carnies.

1838
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:29,480
I mean that's a classic description,
right? That's kind of fucked up.

1839
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:33,800
And these guys looked at the guys that
worked at definitely, they all did, right?

1840
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:36,890
Yeah. Even, yeah. Even last
week they look creepy. Well,

1841
01:44:36,891 --> 01:44:40,100
you remember those fucking
machines they would set up like we,

1842
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:44,240
they had carnivals, Massachusetts. We
would go to these local places, you know,

1843
01:44:44,241 --> 01:44:46,020
they'd be set up seasonally
and something like that.

1844
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:48,650
And you'd go down there and
they'd have fried dough,

1845
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:52,910
you know that fried dough
with the fucking, the uh,
powdered sugar on it. Yeah.

1846
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:57,350
What's that called? Watson? No, no.
Waffle cakes. Fun. Okay. Funnel cakes.

1847
01:44:57,410 --> 01:45:00,970
Elephant here. Yeah, there's a, there's a,

1848
01:45:01,190 --> 01:45:05,320
there's a zip something, a fucking Italian
name. Pour it. Dave gamble, you know,

1849
01:45:05,330 --> 01:45:09,290
or something like that. That's not it,
that it starts with a z. But anyway,

1850
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:12,440
the point being this fried dough,
these stands and these,

1851
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:15,830
and then they'd have these
ridiculous carousels.

1852
01:45:15,831 --> 01:45:17,770
Like what kind of an
asshole do you have to be?

1853
01:45:17,790 --> 01:45:22,070
Get on that and risk your life on this
fucking contraption that was put together

1854
01:45:22,071 --> 01:45:24,070
by these guys.
You know,

1855
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:27,100
what kind of regulations do they
had for carnivals back then? Yeah,

1856
01:45:27,101 --> 01:45:30,050
it does not an inspector coming in every
day when they're shutting it off to

1857
01:45:30,051 --> 01:45:34,100
make sure it's safe. I know little town
that they're in. It's just such a weird,

1858
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:37,700
like common thing. It's a common
thing. I carnivals are common.

1859
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:42,080
Everybody knows about carnivals.
But to have that kind of a show,

1860
01:45:42,081 --> 01:45:45,770
go travel from town to
town, set up, put up tents,

1861
01:45:46,850 --> 01:45:48,080
put on little weird shows.

1862
01:45:48,081 --> 01:45:50,090
Try to get everybody's money and
then get the fuck out of dodge.

1863
01:45:50,540 --> 01:45:54,920
Move onto the next place.
All jaded and weird. Yeah,

1864
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:56,430
cause every move you make a hit too.

1865
01:45:56,540 --> 01:46:00,170
For $200 you could sit two rows up and
on the doll over here, ride the cab.

1866
01:46:00,171 --> 01:46:04,330
Me and my son ride the camel for seven
bucks a piece. He wrote the [inaudible],

1867
01:46:04,610 --> 01:46:07,550
we were on a cattle together.
He wrote the elephant for nine.

1868
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:11,930
That was nine and stuff. Yet they have
elephants, that program for two bucks.

1869
01:46:12,620 --> 01:46:17,220
That's a fucked up thing that
the circus animals like the,

1870
01:46:17,221 --> 01:46:21,380
do you ever see the one with the bear
and the monkey where there's a train bear

1871
01:46:21,381 --> 01:46:24,480
and a monkey and they're riding
bikes together? Never seen that.

1872
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:29,510
It's pretty funny. Pretty fucked up.
The bear, um, crashes into the Monkey.

1873
01:46:29,560 --> 01:46:30,381
The monkey falls,

1874
01:46:30,381 --> 01:46:34,310
the bear crashes into them and the bear
decides amongst Assholey so kills him in

1875
01:46:34,311 --> 01:46:35,144
front of everybody.

1876
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:41,540
He was in pain and he associated the
pain with this monkey fucking up, right?

1877
01:46:41,600 --> 01:46:44,450
Like he, like, I think he might've
thought the monkey attacked him.

1878
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:48,710
Like that's why I fell like
this. My thought, like the
monkey was attacking him.

1879
01:46:48,711 --> 01:46:52,470
So He, this monkey in front of everybody
and they're trying to get them off the

1880
01:46:52,471 --> 01:46:56,580
monkeys. A fucking giant train. Grizzly
bear just like it's so, it's such a,

1881
01:46:57,450 --> 01:47:01,200
it's such a hilarious video. It's
horrible. Right? But it's also hilarious.

1882
01:47:01,201 --> 01:47:03,990
Like what the fuck is wrong with people?
You got to train.

1883
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:08,010
Bear and a trained monkey. Look at this.
They're riding a bike together. I mean,

1884
01:47:08,011 --> 01:47:11,760
that is a real fucking bear. Oh
Shit. That's a real bear. That, look,

1885
01:47:12,690 --> 01:47:17,430
this guy falls down, the bare falls.
The bear knocks into this guy and so he,

1886
01:47:17,490 --> 01:47:20,650
he gets back on. Is that it already? Yes.

1887
01:47:22,450 --> 01:47:23,040
Yeah.

1888
01:47:23,040 --> 01:47:28,020
Oh my gosh. I missed it then. I fucked
up. I didn't see where the monkey had him.

1889
01:47:30,130 --> 01:47:31,150
I was too busy laughing.

1890
01:47:32,670 --> 01:47:36,220
It's just so crazy that people think it's
okay to get a bear to write a fucking

1891
01:47:36,221 --> 01:47:39,970
bicycle with a monkey. So, okay,

1892
01:47:39,971 --> 01:47:43,330
so there's a monkey in front of them
and the bears behind them. Okay.

1893
01:47:43,331 --> 01:47:47,410
I sit it and see, because the guy
got in the way right here. Boom.

1894
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:52,090
The guy kind of fucked up and the bear
runs over the monkey and just decides to

1895
01:47:52,091 --> 01:47:55,390
Maul Him. Fuck this biding
bikes, socks. I'm a bear.

1896
01:47:56,590 --> 01:47:58,540
And these guys,
they can't do shit about it.

1897
01:47:58,541 --> 01:48:03,220
They're watching him tear this fucking
monkey apart. Nothing they could do.

1898
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:04,470
Okay.

1899
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:08,700
And then they realize like, Jesus Christ,
we're working with a bear. You know,

1900
01:48:08,770 --> 01:48:12,930
you thought of them as Hank,
your coworker. This is my
buddy Hank. You know? Oh,

1901
01:48:12,931 --> 01:48:16,530
Hanks a murderer. Thanks a fucking
murderer. No, no. He's a good guy.

1902
01:48:16,970 --> 01:48:19,230
He's a good guy and let's
crashes into you with a bike.

1903
01:48:19,400 --> 01:48:23,990
He just eats you in front of crowds.
It reminds me of days,

1904
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:27,240
had a famous bet about Siegfried
and Roy. He's like, you know,

1905
01:48:27,241 --> 01:48:30,330
people just bought those tickets every
night. Cold tonight. Could be the night

1906
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:35,370
that they don't have a
one of those anymore.

1907
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,710
They don't have a CIG
Freedom Roy type act anymore.

1908
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:41,730
I can't think of one famous thing in Vegas
like that. They still have the lines.

1909
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:46,640
Apparently at the MGM, the PM GM has
lions and the barrage as dolphins.

1910
01:48:46,641 --> 01:48:50,130
It's kind of fucked. Then they take that
exhibit of the line exhibit out of the,

1911
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:52,580
I don't know the damn. Yeah, I
don't remember seeing it in the day.

1912
01:48:52,680 --> 01:48:55,920
They took it out. That's good. I went
to it a long time ago and I was like,

1913
01:48:55,921 --> 01:48:59,410
what in the fuck didn't want him to get
attacked in there? In front of this.

1914
01:48:59,530 --> 01:49:02,550
One of the trainers got attacked. Yeah,
there's a video of that. I saw that,

1915
01:49:02,850 --> 01:49:06,330
but the idea that you could
have a fucking casino in Vegas.

1916
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:10,630
Yeah,

1917
01:49:10,630 --> 01:49:14,710
and inside this glass box is
these port tigers or lions rather.

1918
01:49:14,711 --> 01:49:17,590
They are getting tortured and they're
looking at these people walking around

1919
01:49:17,591 --> 01:49:22,450
staring at them. That's way more
unnatural than a zoo plus cigarette smoke.

1920
01:49:22,451 --> 01:49:26,950
Cigarettes drink. Yeah. Gotcha.
Screaming. Yeah, of course. Yeah.

1921
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:28,520
That's a fucked up place for a lion.

1922
01:49:30,720 --> 01:49:34,620
Why do people have lions in the back
of their Lamborghinis and do Dubai's a,

1923
01:49:34,640 --> 01:49:36,150
is that a real thing that people do?

1924
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:40,550
You're talking about that dude is
driving the AMG Mercedes and he has a a a

1925
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:44,700
leopard and his front seat.
It was a cheetah, I think
it was a cheetah actually.

1926
01:49:45,570 --> 01:49:48,610
Why did they do that?
They do that cause did my a tiger.

1927
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:52,210
Why did Mike Tyson own those,
those crazy animals?

1928
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:54,640
There's a documentary on
it that's really good.

1929
01:49:54,641 --> 01:49:56,410
It's called the elephant
in the living room,

1930
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:59,890
and it's all about people that
keep these crazy exotic pets.

1931
01:49:59,891 --> 01:50:04,891
And this one guy that had lions and the
lions lived in a small box cart that

1932
01:50:06,710 --> 01:50:11,500
chat live Persian Gulf. Ah, Persians,

1933
01:50:12,310 --> 01:50:16,030
look at him. He's the most gangster. He's
hanging out with like, Whoa, Whoa, whoa,

1934
01:50:16,031 --> 01:50:17,170
Whoa, whoa. Scroll up.

1935
01:50:17,590 --> 01:50:20,260
He's hanging out with the lions
and they're covered in blood.

1936
01:50:20,860 --> 01:50:24,070
What the fuck are they covered in?
Blood for the dead animal right there.

1937
01:50:24,130 --> 01:50:27,490
Oh Jesus. So he would give them
that while they killed that thing.

1938
01:50:27,580 --> 01:50:30,910
So it gave them a calf.
They the mall, the calf,

1939
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:35,850
and he comes in and sits next to the
body and hangs out with them. Oh my God.

1940
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:38,200
They gave him a shark to kill.

1941
01:50:40,570 --> 01:50:43,600
This guy seems awesome. The well, there's
always going to be people like this.

1942
01:50:43,601 --> 01:50:45,700
Whenever there's billions of
dollars out there. Look at that.

1943
01:50:45,701 --> 01:50:50,200
The guys on a Mercedes, an AMG
Mercedes, and they standing on the roof,

1944
01:50:50,201 --> 01:50:51,340
which is an asshole thing to do.

1945
01:50:51,341 --> 01:50:54,910
And he's feeding his lion who was on the
hood of the car and his friends at the

1946
01:50:54,911 --> 01:50:57,990
driver's seat and it's fed. It's like
you've gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

1947
01:50:58,270 --> 01:51:02,050
This is going to be the best
youtube video. This guy's nuts.

1948
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:05,740
This seemed like one dude.
So is he like training these lines?

1949
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:09,820
I think it's just bad ass.
I probably fucks them.

1950
01:51:11,290 --> 01:51:15,790
That's his Instagram account.
That's hilarious. He's got money.

1951
01:51:15,820 --> 01:51:18,790
Look at that fucking one on a top
with a, hold on. Go back to that one.

1952
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:23,690
Look at that shit. That is so
crazy. You got off my car. He's,

1953
01:51:23,740 --> 01:51:28,120
he's on his knees like on his toes.
Bent down like a rapper.

1954
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:32,440
Like if he's playing dice or something
and right next to him as a lion and he's

1955
01:51:32,441 --> 01:51:34,030
on a Mercedes,
that's gotta be,

1956
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:39,010
that's gotta be his dating profile for
whatever online services on Tinder or

1957
01:51:39,011 --> 01:51:41,920
whatever. That's his dating profile. Me.

1958
01:51:41,921 --> 01:51:44,860
I love nature and Mercedes Benz.

1959
01:51:46,320 --> 01:51:50,680
He's sucking my Dick. Yeah, that's,
Oh, such a ridiculous photo.

1960
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:55,630
What does, you know, how's it
guy like that live in this world?

1961
01:51:58,050 --> 01:51:59,170
It's just,
I love that.

1962
01:51:59,530 --> 01:52:01,810
If you're going to have people
that are flashy and any way,

1963
01:52:01,811 --> 01:52:05,020
you're always gonna have that one person
takes flashing as to the most fucked up

1964
01:52:05,021 --> 01:52:09,700
place. So like whenever you have a
house that's like the most, the huge,

1965
01:52:09,720 --> 01:52:10,091
just be like,

1966
01:52:10,091 --> 01:52:12,070
what was the one that we were looking
at the other day that was in Bel Air?

1967
01:52:12,071 --> 01:52:14,350
That was 50, but that was
after the show was over. Right?

1968
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:20,010
We out $500 million in Belair and the,

1969
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:23,140
the previous most expensive
ones sold in Bel Air.

1970
01:52:23,141 --> 01:52:27,400
It was like a hundred million
dollars. Right? What the fuck? Really?

1971
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:31,990
Like how come you don't retire?
Why do you have a $500 million house?

1972
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:37,300
That's ridiculous. So yeah, this guy's
good thing that's got a, her pool.

1973
01:52:37,630 --> 01:52:42,040
So that's what the guy was in Dubai.
Yeah. So you get all these Russian checks,

1974
01:52:42,041 --> 01:52:45,500
European checks go over to Dubai.
I tried to find rich guys. Oh yeah,

1975
01:52:46,400 --> 01:52:47,700
yeah. When we were, uh,

1976
01:52:47,720 --> 01:52:52,720
I was in Abu Dhabi for the UFC and a bunch
of the guys went to Dubai just to see

1977
01:52:53,211 --> 01:52:55,280
what it was like and go
get some food and shit.

1978
01:52:55,790 --> 01:52:59,660
And they said that they walked into a
bar that had no idea and it was literally

1979
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:02,810
all Russian hookers, the
entire bar. They're like, dude,

1980
01:53:02,811 --> 01:53:04,670
I think this is a hooker bar.

1981
01:53:04,970 --> 01:53:08,480
Like it was all Russian hookers
waiting for guys who show up.

1982
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:11,450
And they got there and I say Russian,
but you know,

1983
01:53:11,570 --> 01:53:16,520
Middle East or eastern bloc country
type accents. And they were like,

1984
01:53:16,580 --> 01:53:17,690
I've never seen anything like it.

1985
01:53:17,810 --> 01:53:20,180
Like there's so much money
there apparently that they just,

1986
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:21,200
that's just where they go.

1987
01:53:21,201 --> 01:53:25,580
They know that rich people are coming in
to vacation and they have certain spots

1988
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:28,220
where they can just find
these Russian bronze.

1989
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:32,250
Then there's also a bunch that come over
from eastern Europe and they just try

1990
01:53:32,251 --> 01:53:34,460
to find American men
and the move to America.

1991
01:53:35,180 --> 01:53:38,690
Did you ever think about doing
that? Absolutely. Okay. A Nice,

1992
01:53:39,050 --> 01:53:42,860
nice 10 from Siberia. Yeah. I mean I got,
I got some bedrooms in my house. Yeah.

1993
01:53:42,950 --> 01:53:46,190
Come on, stay, stay around,
get your green card.

1994
01:53:47,990 --> 01:53:50,420
I've had friends who bring them
back at a hotel like, oh yeah,

1995
01:53:50,421 --> 01:53:53,300
you know I got two mansions, I live
here, I live here and you know,

1996
01:53:53,301 --> 01:53:56,930
and then bang them and then try to get
rid of him after it. They got nothing.

1997
01:53:58,580 --> 01:54:02,960
Eventually if they keep doing that
they'll, they'll find a guy. Oh yeah,

1998
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:05,870
absolutely. But the buys really
weird. Like that's where you,

1999
01:54:05,871 --> 01:54:08,300
if you kiss someone in public,
I get thrown in jail and stuff like that.

2000
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:10,190
So he really got to do,
you can't do it in the bar,

2001
01:54:10,191 --> 01:54:13,370
you can't even do it on the till.
You get back to in the hotel room.

2002
01:54:13,400 --> 01:54:17,840
Well there was caught with Melatonin.
She got caught with Melatonin,

2003
01:54:18,050 --> 01:54:21,230
which is a natural supplement that helps
you go to sleep and they locked her in

2004
01:54:21,231 --> 01:54:25,820
fucking jail. She was an executive
at a sound, I think end the mall.

2005
01:54:25,821 --> 01:54:26,421
Like one of those.

2006
01:54:26,421 --> 01:54:30,410
I'm one of those production companies
and it was another lady or another guy

2007
01:54:30,411 --> 01:54:34,820
rather that got arrested for having some
prescription medication that's illegal

2008
01:54:34,821 --> 01:54:39,740
there but not illegal in the UK where
he lived and so he had some prescription

2009
01:54:39,741 --> 01:54:41,840
medication then he travels with,
but he has to take,

2010
01:54:42,330 --> 01:54:45,710
his doctor prescribes it and they
fucking locked him right in jail.

2011
01:54:46,040 --> 01:54:46,701
They took his,

2012
01:54:46,701 --> 01:54:49,910
took his medication away from him and
through him in a box yet I was a rapper

2013
01:54:49,911 --> 01:54:52,730
too going over, cause they do a lot of
constant over there. Rapper had some,

2014
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:56,000
I think he had some marijuana. I'm just
a little, he got thrown in jail. Porto,

2015
01:54:56,150 --> 01:54:57,050
Carrie Bradshaw.

2016
01:54:57,680 --> 01:55:00,640
She kissed that guy on the
beach and they've got arrested
in sex in the city too.

2017
01:55:01,530 --> 01:55:05,840
I S I did not see that. Is that a
movie dead more than one movement?

2018
01:55:06,440 --> 01:55:10,220
No, I did not. We talked about it.
Sex and the city too. Yeah. No,

2019
01:55:10,221 --> 01:55:11,930
we definitely did not talk about it.

2020
01:55:11,940 --> 01:55:16,940
I've never seen a city to kiss Mr
big on the beach and they can see it.

2021
01:55:18,020 --> 01:55:21,230
I watched some of the previews.
I think we might have mocked it,

2022
01:55:21,231 --> 01:55:25,850
but we never talked about me seeing it.
Oh, I was in, let them talk about it.

2023
01:55:26,030 --> 01:55:29,780
There was, there was actually a second
one. If I saw it, I would talk about it.

2024
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:35,460
You liked we you'd like so retarded.
I know.

2025
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:38,570
You really should go to a doctor. The
patch did something. Tell him. Yeah,

2026
01:55:38,571 --> 01:55:40,250
he's something wrong with your brain.

2027
01:55:40,251 --> 01:55:44,430
Like half your sentences today are
so goofy. That three. That's exactly

2028
01:55:44,430 --> 01:55:48,010
what you were saying. It's like you're
off. I could feel it. Oh yeah, I miss her.

2029
01:55:48,011 --> 01:55:52,660
It's totally, I feel you're going
to make it. No, you're so weak. No,

2030
01:55:52,661 --> 01:55:53,494
I will make it.

2031
01:55:54,300 --> 01:55:58,010
She's a man up man up hungry
right now. I'm, I don't,

2032
01:55:58,011 --> 01:56:00,420
I'm not normally Hungary
and so it's like weird.

2033
01:56:00,421 --> 01:56:04,280
I had something that they say like that's
a big one with cigarette smokers that

2034
01:56:04,281 --> 01:56:05,940
the appetite suppressant aspect of it,

2035
01:56:05,970 --> 01:56:10,620
it's 100% like I never wanted to eat
like at one in the after World War Two in

2036
01:56:10,621 --> 01:56:12,030
the afternoon or whatever and I

2037
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:15,380
well you got to replace it with something
else. You obviously have an addiction,

2038
01:56:15,381 --> 01:56:17,990
so you've got to get a new healthy
addiction. That's what you gotta do.

2039
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:18,810
Okay.

2040
01:56:18,810 --> 01:56:20,430
As start calling it a jam or something,
you know?

2041
01:56:22,020 --> 01:56:22,853
Hmm.

2042
01:56:23,580 --> 01:56:26,670
Yeah. I'd been drinking Jamba juice
lately though. That's good. Fruit juice

2043
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:31,070
to start. Yeah. That's not bad. The
problem with Jamba juice, not Jamba juice,

2044
01:56:31,071 --> 01:56:32,790
but like a lot of those places
you think you're getting,

2045
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,290
I'm going to have a smoothie. The amount
of sugar that's in those smoothies,

2046
01:56:36,380 --> 01:56:40,150
it's a lot of divisions. Juice and
yeah. Really? When you have an orange,

2047
01:56:40,151 --> 01:56:41,270
you supposed to eat an orange,

2048
01:56:41,490 --> 01:56:45,440
like orange juice is kind of an unnatural
way to get orange stuff. You know,

2049
01:56:45,441 --> 01:56:48,110
to have this such a concentrated amount,
like when you,

2050
01:56:48,190 --> 01:56:51,630
you were drinking orange juice,
the way that it comes into your body,

2051
01:56:51,631 --> 01:56:53,060
your body's like,
how the fuck did you get this?

2052
01:56:53,061 --> 01:56:56,810
Like this I talked to was not in the
orange. Why are you not chew and fiber?

2053
01:56:56,950 --> 01:57:00,500
This isn't attached to the pulp and all
that other stuff. Like how'd you do this?

2054
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,650
And you're just pouring it
right in your bloodstream.

2055
01:57:02,660 --> 01:57:06,890
It's just basically like sugar water.
It's better for you. Like fresh squeeze,

2056
01:57:06,891 --> 01:57:09,410
a lot of vitamins in it and stuff,
but there's a lot of sugar.

2057
01:57:09,910 --> 01:57:12,260
A lot of calories and fruit juices.
Yeah.

2058
01:57:12,530 --> 01:57:14,990
Try to fresh juice or mega right there.

2059
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:18,980
Don't give him advice for free. He's
not gonna. He's not gonna know it.

2060
01:57:19,290 --> 01:57:21,660
I used to juice.
He's already thinking about the cigarette.

2061
01:57:21,661 --> 01:57:23,160
He's going to have it in
his car on the way home.

2062
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,390
I knew I was going to stop at the
gas station and like, fuck it man.

2063
01:57:29,940 --> 01:57:32,190
It's crashed this mother
fucker right into the beach.

2064
01:57:34,360 --> 01:57:38,580
It's important to when you doing
out in La what's going on? Yeah.

2065
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:43,380
What are you doing? Did you know the usual
meetings? What I tell you? Great. Yeah.

2066
01:57:43,381 --> 01:57:46,860
We're gonna put you in a movie and we've
got a part for you and Adam Sandler.

2067
01:57:46,861 --> 01:57:50,340
I'll probably call you tomorrow at home
and then you never hear from again.

2068
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:53,850
You know one of those sometimes
those pan out. Yeah, once in a while.

2069
01:57:53,851 --> 01:57:57,540
I do actually. So that's what you're
out here and I do some standup shows.

2070
01:57:57,750 --> 01:58:00,180
I think you're going to do a show
together at the comedy store and Brian,

2071
01:58:00,181 --> 01:58:03,370
you're doing that show to right. And
Joey has just got added to it. GDS,

2072
01:58:03,400 --> 01:58:04,370
Delray says

2073
01:58:05,220 --> 01:58:09,480
belly room show to folks. So uh, don't
sleep. It's the only seats like 70 people.

2074
01:58:09,481 --> 01:58:12,960
It's only supposed to see 70 people I
already sold out. Yeah, it probably is,

2075
01:58:12,961 --> 01:58:17,250
but it's a, they really jam like 90 in
that right? We think somewhere in there,

2076
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:20,580
somewhere on there.
Maybe the fire marshal doesn't know.

2077
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:23,070
Apparently supposed to get 57

2078
01:58:23,570 --> 01:58:26,470
57. I loved that. Roam the
belly room markets the best.

2079
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:29,510
I got to go there tonight and check to
make sure the sound system is still there

2080
01:58:29,511 --> 01:58:30,770
cause I wasn't working last night.

2081
01:58:30,771 --> 01:58:33,620
I think they might've blown her
new speakers up there. Oh No.

2082
01:58:33,621 --> 01:58:36,620
So anybody can use it, right?
People that unfortunately, yeah,

2083
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:39,880
there's not a sound guy up in there.
It's kind of like I said,

2084
01:58:39,890 --> 01:58:41,980
most comedy clubs you usually
a sound guy that takes

2085
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:44,740
care of, of the sound board and
everything and the belly room.

2086
01:58:44,741 --> 01:58:48,010
It's kind of like whoever's running the
show kind of takes over the sound word,

2087
01:58:48,011 --> 01:58:52,570
which is a horrible idea. But so you
guys put in a new sound board? Yeah.

2088
01:58:52,600 --> 01:58:56,870
Kill Tony. The one episode you can
just raise money. No idea. It was a,

2089
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:59,050
that was a standup show or
I did death squad showed up,

2090
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:01,330
put all the money towards it and
then the comedy store matched it.

2091
01:59:01,331 --> 01:59:04,020
So we got it like our really high end
sound system up there and some of them

2092
01:59:04,021 --> 01:59:08,980
might have blown it. Maybe on, I'll
find out tonight or this weekend too.

2093
01:59:08,981 --> 01:59:11,290
I'm there Friday and Saturday.
I'm doing the belly room. Yeah.

2094
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:13,060
We have killed Tony Tonight there.
So I get to

2095
01:59:14,790 --> 01:59:16,710
put a new sound board on your Amazon gift,

2096
01:59:16,711 --> 01:59:18,890
a gift shop or whatever the hell it is.
Yeah.

2097
01:59:21,580 --> 01:59:26,110
So uh, you don't start before, right?
Yeah. What do you do mostly in New York,

2098
01:59:26,410 --> 01:59:29,080
which uh, which clubs do you work
at? Does a new club called the stand?

2099
01:59:29,110 --> 01:59:31,640
You'll keep hearing good things
about that for a club. Yeah.

2100
01:59:31,670 --> 01:59:33,550
Ari does that place a
lot? Yeah, it's, yeah,

2101
01:59:33,560 --> 01:59:36,100
it's similar to the comedy cellar
downstairs in our basement.

2102
01:59:36,101 --> 01:59:39,520
Upstairs you're hang the comex.
Great food. Um, I did add, you know,

2103
01:59:39,521 --> 01:59:44,170
in the comedy cellar, standup New
York, still the good road gigs around.

2104
01:59:44,171 --> 01:59:48,250
They're still not really not in that area.
His governor still around.

2105
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:51,340
Governors is still there. It's a great
gig. That's a great gig brokerage.

2106
01:59:51,400 --> 01:59:53,800
The Braemar brokerage is still the isle.

2107
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:55,720
I used to have a hard time getting
booked there cause I was dirty.

2108
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:59,050
So I worked at one time
and the guy hated me.

2109
01:59:59,650 --> 02:00:02,900
The guy who originally owned it and I
never went back after that. The governor,

2110
02:00:02,930 --> 02:00:06,630
they didn't care. No. Devin is it like,
they just wanted you to be funny, but, uh,

2111
02:00:06,640 --> 02:00:10,850
the brokerage, they wanted it squeaky
clean. 1970s Johnny Carson style.

2112
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:14,410
This is a bunch of those clubs.
Well, that's comedy Magic Club.

2113
02:00:14,440 --> 02:00:17,980
Joey Diaz still can't work the comedy
and Magic Club. They won't, they,

2114
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:22,330
they had to have a conversation with me
about Joey because Joey was my opening

2115
02:00:22,331 --> 02:00:26,380
act. You know, I always brought Joey
with me as much as I can. And, uh,

2116
02:00:26,530 --> 02:00:31,120
comedy Magic Club. We're like, we have to
talk to you about this. It's like, well,

2117
02:00:31,170 --> 02:00:35,620
isn't that weird though, that they let
Ari shift fear? He's not as dirty as Joey.

2118
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:37,930
He used to be pretty fucking dirty.

2119
02:00:38,020 --> 02:00:40,150
I remember the weekend that
that's a different level.

2120
02:00:40,360 --> 02:00:43,570
It's a different level with
Joey's doing the pigeon,

2121
02:00:44,410 --> 02:00:46,510
you know you're doing that
eating a monkey from behind.

2122
02:00:46,511 --> 02:00:49,420
You're sticking your nose right
now, asshole. Like a page.

2123
02:00:49,421 --> 02:00:53,920
And I think it goes like this. He goes,
that's a chicken, but what the fuck?

2124
02:00:53,921 --> 02:00:57,970
You know what I'm talking
about the pigeon? Yeah.

2125
02:00:57,971 --> 02:01:02,950
He was just doing some crazy ass
eating stuff and uh, Mike is like,

2126
02:01:02,951 --> 02:01:07,180
that's it. Because that was also
back before, like there was,

2127
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:08,560
the shows would be packed,

2128
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:11,860
but half the people would know
me from like maybe fear factor.

2129
02:01:12,130 --> 02:01:15,580
And he had a bunch of regulars that would
go there every Sunday no matter what,

2130
02:01:15,581 --> 02:01:18,410
every weekend, no matter what. He's
got a bunch of like regulars and he,

2131
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:20,650
he always has his squeaky clean shells.

2132
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:24,940
So they would come to see me and they'd
have no idea what the fuck was about to

2133
02:01:24,941 --> 02:01:27,820
hit them. And Julie would get onstage
and a bunch of, I'm like barely,

2134
02:01:28,090 --> 02:01:32,560
barely made it through, almost had heart
attacks, ran out into the fucking street.

2135
02:01:33,580 --> 02:01:37,950
What did you do to me?
They're used to like the 9:00 AM uh,

2136
02:01:38,050 --> 02:01:42,320
Jay Leno show on Sunday, you
know, not, not really 9:00
AM, but it might as well be,

2137
02:01:42,321 --> 02:01:42,531
you know,

2138
02:01:42,531 --> 02:01:46,640
he would do these a tonight show monologue
says he we're working on on Sunday.

2139
02:01:46,641 --> 02:01:50,870
So yeah. And he'd go down there and just
read a bunch of like very non offensive,

2140
02:01:50,871 --> 02:01:54,560
very mild tonight show style jokes.
So they got used to that.

2141
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:59,120
And then Joey Diaz just hits
the stage like fucking tornado.

2142
02:02:00,450 --> 02:02:03,470
They just didn't know what to do.
So half of them loved it,

2143
02:02:03,471 --> 02:02:04,610
but it was a good percent.

2144
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:08,810
But now if we went back it would be 100%
they would know what the fuck to expect

2145
02:02:09,160 --> 02:02:12,840
that it would be awesome. But
he's scared. Yeah. I liked that,

2146
02:02:12,841 --> 02:02:14,870
that club once and I was a tonight show,

2147
02:02:14,871 --> 02:02:17,480
people coming to see me and they were
gave me a warning and they go, look,

2148
02:02:17,720 --> 02:02:19,940
I don't know why you're going
to do up here. I go, I'm
doing it tonight. Show side.

2149
02:02:20,390 --> 02:02:23,960
Yeah, it's four and a half
minutes. I can't do any dirty
shit on the tonight show.

2150
02:02:23,961 --> 02:02:25,500
It's going to be fine.
Like, all right, we'll just,

2151
02:02:25,760 --> 02:02:27,020
just make sure you know we don't,

2152
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:30,110
we know you've got a reputation from
these codes from Howard stern and all this

2153
02:02:30,111 --> 02:02:34,880
stuff and how gross. I know I'm
auditioning for it tonight show.

2154
02:02:34,881 --> 02:02:36,260
I'm not going to talk about ass eating.

2155
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:42,260
You'd have to really say it in a way
that it could get on. What year was this?

2156
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:45,380
This was probably like eight years ago,
seven years ago.

2157
02:02:45,410 --> 02:02:47,060
They have lighter standards now,

2158
02:02:47,090 --> 02:02:49,610
like standards and practices that you
can get away with a lot of shit now that

2159
02:02:49,611 --> 02:02:51,740
you'd never could get away
with just a few years ago.

2160
02:02:51,870 --> 02:02:56,030
Like the Internet is opening
up the boundaries for what?
Like just look at the,

2161
02:02:56,090 --> 02:02:57,560
the Gore factor.

2162
02:02:57,850 --> 02:03:01,670
Look at like I was watching CSI and the
other day and they had some bodies that

2163
02:03:01,671 --> 02:03:05,450
they were like picking bullets out
of or some shit and I was like, whoa.

2164
02:03:05,451 --> 02:03:10,040
Like I can't believe this is regular TV.
Like really fucking gory.

2165
02:03:10,190 --> 02:03:12,230
They show it to you like really quick.
You know,

2166
02:03:12,231 --> 02:03:15,800
like they don't show you
like long focused shots,

2167
02:03:15,801 --> 02:03:20,030
but it's enough that you're like, Whoa,
I can't believe this is regular TV.

2168
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:23,630
Do you think the fear factor episode
with the Com would be able to be passed

2169
02:03:23,631 --> 02:03:27,890
nowadays? No. Kent maybe be
drink Tom, someone's son,

2170
02:03:28,130 --> 02:03:30,890
someone's son, someone's daughter.
You're making them drink. Come on TV.

2171
02:03:31,530 --> 02:03:33,080
Every watched that.
The other day,

2172
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:36,440
one of the grossest things I've
ever heard someone trying, oh,

2173
02:03:36,450 --> 02:03:40,490
they'd drink a big gulp full of cum,
big drink like 24 hours,

2174
02:03:40,670 --> 02:03:44,750
24 ounces rather. It was honest. It
didn't make the shell, no, never,

2175
02:03:44,930 --> 02:03:46,160
never got in the year in America,

2176
02:03:46,190 --> 02:03:48,790
but it made the air and like
Holland and a bunch of other cities,

2177
02:03:48,791 --> 02:03:50,750
so they took a bunch of the countries.

2178
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:54,200
So they took the video of that and they
upload it to youtube. You could watch it.

2179
02:03:54,201 --> 02:03:57,590
It's available. It was the most
ridiculous. A shy girl drank guy,

2180
02:03:57,620 --> 02:03:59,070
one guy and two girls.
I said Craig,

2181
02:03:59,690 --> 02:04:02,840
did you see that new fear factor of rip
off Sir that's starting heard about it?

2182
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:06,530
Yeah, it's pretty, pretty close. Good.

2183
02:04:06,650 --> 02:04:09,830
They even advertise it in the
commercial like juice, like fear factor,

2184
02:04:09,831 --> 02:04:14,810
bullseye or whatever. Really they say just
like fear factor. Wow. That's hilarious.

2185
02:04:15,440 --> 02:04:19,470
Yeah man, that was a show with, that was
one of the rare times in life where uh,

2186
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:24,200
someone got fired because someone
drank come on TV. Cause that was,

2187
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:25,130
that was what happened.

2188
02:04:25,131 --> 02:04:29,840
We all got fired because someone drank
come on TV and I was happy. I was like,

2189
02:04:29,841 --> 02:04:32,880
good. It's canceled. Like I was
literally happy that it was cancerous.

2190
02:04:32,900 --> 02:04:35,900
Why to show got canceled.
The other ratings were really good.

2191
02:04:36,230 --> 02:04:37,980
It was doing really
well when it came back,

2192
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:41,670
the, the stunts were insane, but the
stunts were getting fucking hairy.

2193
02:04:41,790 --> 02:04:44,490
Like we had a couple,
like pretty pretty big accidents.

2194
02:04:44,580 --> 02:04:48,200
There was one where this couple left,
like the um,

2195
02:04:48,210 --> 02:04:51,900
the driver or something happened and
his windshield was obscured with like a

2196
02:04:51,901 --> 02:04:56,040
cardboard box and they almost crashed
into this lady's leg. Like it was,

2197
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:58,440
it was enough that I was like,
Whoa,

2198
02:04:58,441 --> 02:05:00,810
like you guys are taking
some fucking chances here.

2199
02:05:00,811 --> 02:05:04,020
Like there was always a certain
amount of chance in fear factor,

2200
02:05:04,021 --> 02:05:05,790
but they were taking some
trances that I was like,

2201
02:05:05,791 --> 02:05:07,530
what happens if this goes wrong?

2202
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:12,660
Like one of them was you were attached
to a Bungee cord that was attached to a

2203
02:05:12,661 --> 02:05:17,520
helicopter and you had to,
that your partner had to unlock you.

2204
02:05:17,521 --> 02:05:21,660
So there's a like a chain full of keys
and then there's a lock and so you have

2205
02:05:21,661 --> 02:05:22,980
to find the right lock.

2206
02:05:22,980 --> 02:05:27,030
So it's you and you're competing with
someone else and there's helicopters and

2207
02:05:27,031 --> 02:05:29,850
the helicopter has a hold
of you on a Bungee cord.

2208
02:05:29,851 --> 02:05:33,870
I pulled tight and then so when
they let go, when they unlock you,

2209
02:05:34,140 --> 02:05:38,050
they let go and you go shooting
off into fucking space shit.

2210
02:05:38,080 --> 02:05:42,770
And I'm saying like they were
falling through the air full,

2211
02:05:42,771 --> 02:05:43,860
flying through the air.

2212
02:05:43,861 --> 02:05:47,790
On the most crazy bungee cord you've ever
seen you in life and it's attached to

2213
02:05:47,791 --> 02:05:50,190
a fucking helicopter. So you
watching this, you're like,

2214
02:05:50,191 --> 02:05:53,010
what if the helicopter crashes?
Like has anybody done this?

2215
02:05:53,011 --> 02:05:55,240
Like how many dry runs if
you'd done with this right?

2216
02:05:55,310 --> 02:05:57,030
Like you know the stunt guys,

2217
02:05:57,180 --> 02:06:00,930
they don't even get paid and they would
have to recreate this fucking thing and

2218
02:06:00,931 --> 02:06:03,030
a lot of times they would
recreate it with PA's.

2219
02:06:03,220 --> 02:06:07,110
They'd get a PA to do the stunt and they
would pay him like 100 bucks and then

2220
02:06:07,111 --> 02:06:11,280
they would attach them to this fucking
thing and the launched him into into

2221
02:06:11,281 --> 02:06:16,110
space or shit, how's he sung?
That's going to die. You can't,

2222
02:06:16,470 --> 02:06:20,520
there's no way you can prevent, like you
can't stop anything if it goes wrong.

2223
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:25,170
There's no fee. Like if that Bungee
cord snaps, you're dead. Okay.

2224
02:06:25,200 --> 02:06:29,580
If the helicopter crashes, everyone's
dead. And they did it off a canyon.

2225
02:06:29,760 --> 02:06:34,740
Like there's like this like huge cliff
and the tree was attached to the people

2226
02:06:34,741 --> 02:06:37,530
and the edge of this cliff. Oh,
this is it right here. Yeah.

2227
02:06:37,550 --> 02:06:39,900
Somebody who's running the,
the fear factor Facebook page.

2228
02:06:39,901 --> 02:06:43,380
And making all these look, look at this
shit. Shit. Backed that up a second.

2229
02:06:43,381 --> 02:06:48,030
So just, you can see how retarded that
is. Watched it. She gets the key in.

2230
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:51,540
She unlocks it.
And the moment she does,

2231
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:56,100
as soon as she gets free,
he pulls the I'm fucking thing.

2232
02:06:56,670 --> 02:06:57,870
Look at that thing.

2233
02:06:57,900 --> 02:07:02,520
She got shot through the fucking
air on the bottom of a helicopter.

2234
02:07:04,830 --> 02:07:07,170
So ridiculous.
That Lady Shave your head to that was,

2235
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:09,300
that was more disturbing for
people than anything else.

2236
02:07:09,690 --> 02:07:13,680
He made that lady shave her hair.
She shaved her head.

2237
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:16,710
Didn't you make somebody get a tattoo
also? No, they did. They wouldn't do it.

2238
02:07:16,711 --> 02:07:17,750
They quit.
They did.

2239
02:07:17,751 --> 02:07:21,570
They had to get a fear factor tattoo
and the Tattoo of me really? Yup.

2240
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:27,210
And that, that got approved
by NBC, which is ridiculous.

2241
02:07:27,390 --> 02:07:29,460
And as they wanted to do at
the bottom of their feet,

2242
02:07:29,490 --> 02:07:34,200
but can't do it because of um, uh,
sanity, you know, hygiene reasons.

2243
02:07:34,201 --> 02:07:36,040
When you step on,
if you have a sore

2244
02:07:36,340 --> 02:07:37,990
like that at the bottom
of your foot at risks,

2245
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:42,600
pretty severe infection
possibilities. But, um, they did that,

2246
02:07:42,830 --> 02:07:45,010
that,
that NBC said they could have the tattoo.

2247
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:47,860
And the other thing that NBC said
was that they could drink piss.

2248
02:07:47,861 --> 02:07:48,910
They drank piss too.

2249
02:07:49,390 --> 02:07:54,280
They drank donkey pis and donkey come
or was cow piss and donkey Kong. Yeah.

2250
02:07:54,660 --> 02:07:59,500
Yeah. That was real calm.
Was that in their donkey come
who's real calm? Like, oh,

2251
02:07:59,501 --> 02:08:02,890
the producers and the line,
everybody's, everybody on the street.

2252
02:08:03,340 --> 02:08:07,780
We just pull over and ask people to
jerk it off. It was so ridiculous.

2253
02:08:07,840 --> 02:08:10,660
It was such as huge vat
of calm that they had to,

2254
02:08:10,870 --> 02:08:13,720
they would pour into these glasses.
And here's the thing,

2255
02:08:13,840 --> 02:08:17,950
like your best case scenario in this game,
the best you could do,

2256
02:08:17,951 --> 02:08:20,530
you would have to drink five ounces.
Absolutely.

2257
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:23,710
Absolutely have to drink five ounces
because they're playing horseshoes.

2258
02:08:23,830 --> 02:08:27,490
So if you fucking got a ringer, you nailed
it. You didn't, it's not even, you know,

2259
02:08:27,491 --> 02:08:30,610
like if you nail it, you don't have
to drink now. Even if you nail it,

2260
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:33,220
you have to drink five ounces.
Just crazy.

2261
02:08:33,460 --> 02:08:36,880
Was it refrigerated or was it like
water temperature now you'd have to

2262
02:08:36,881 --> 02:08:40,060
refrigerate it. Didn't want to serve
that shield. Yeah. That's how I feel.

2263
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,850
At least you could pretend it's something
else. If it's hot, it's going down.

2264
02:08:42,851 --> 02:08:46,450
You throw it, you know exactly what it
is. They get a latte. No little hot latte.

2265
02:08:46,500 --> 02:08:48,380
That's bad. I don't know what
you're putting in your locked eyes.

2266
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,920
What do you need to stop right now
or are you going to get pregnant?

2267
02:08:51,070 --> 02:08:54,160
It's just like the Kelly.
You want to chill. That's a
lot easier going down. Chill.

2268
02:08:55,830 --> 02:09:00,400
It's all psychological though
cause it's like it's come right.

2269
02:09:00,450 --> 02:09:04,150
It's salty liquid like not
like when you swallow snot.

2270
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:07,700
It's all psychological,
but the actual taste of Snot,

2271
02:09:07,710 --> 02:09:09,580
it's not the worst thing in the world.
You know?

2272
02:09:09,581 --> 02:09:13,540
I'm sure there's a lot of things to taste
way better than way worse than snot or

2273
02:09:13,541 --> 02:09:16,240
com. But a check that
swallows got a big advantage.

2274
02:09:16,250 --> 02:09:18,880
He's like girl saying that the girls,
it was hilarious. They were like,

2275
02:09:18,910 --> 02:09:22,510
I'll take the comp. The girl took the calm
over the pissed. I go, really? She goes,

2276
02:09:22,511 --> 02:09:25,400
yeah, what's the big deal? I was
like, wow, what a trooper. You know,

2277
02:09:25,740 --> 02:09:28,870
like she took the come, she's like, it'd
be easier. I've swallowed come before.

2278
02:09:29,170 --> 02:09:32,470
We didn't have any of that
on TV obviously, but they
were laughing about it.

2279
02:09:32,550 --> 02:09:36,100
You're like, I've swallowed before, this
will be easy. Fine. And I was like, wow.

2280
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:40,900
Like I guess a guy would probably like
if there was some sort of a squirting

2281
02:09:40,901 --> 02:09:45,901
thing that pigs did and you could collect
that and a guy had to choose between,

2282
02:09:47,020 --> 02:09:51,340
uh, drinking that stuff
or a, or something else,

2283
02:09:51,490 --> 02:09:53,230
you would go with the squirty stuff.
Cause it's like,

2284
02:09:53,380 --> 02:09:58,030
it's coming out of a girl's vagina. It's
just, just like, girl come, no big deal.

2285
02:09:58,290 --> 02:09:59,123
What was it?
The girl.

2286
02:09:59,470 --> 02:10:02,730
But I think that's how the girls looked
at it when they thought about this.

2287
02:10:03,190 --> 02:10:07,660
The idea. Yeah, that's common dude.

2288
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:12,310
Oh my God.
They drank a mug.

2289
02:10:16,700 --> 02:10:17,540
You girls are awesome.

2290
02:10:25,930 --> 02:10:30,160
Like I was plugging in. They're plugging
their nose while they're drinking.

2291
02:10:30,161 --> 02:10:32,980
Come look at that guy, chuck. Come,

2292
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:42,300
that guy just chugged.
Come. Oh my goodness.

2293
02:10:44,910 --> 02:10:48,420
Okay. Well how has that fear, so fear
factors released that then? Oh No, no.

2294
02:10:48,450 --> 02:10:50,540
If it's edited, it's fear
factor moments. Yeah, it's,

2295
02:10:50,710 --> 02:10:53,340
it's something happened about
six months ago. Fear factors.

2296
02:10:53,341 --> 02:10:57,540
Facebook page just started posting brand
new videos and like you advertisements

2297
02:10:57,541 --> 02:11:01,650
and stuff. He goes to shit that come
out. I love how Joe's right in her face.

2298
02:11:01,651 --> 02:11:03,840
Come on, fucking do it already. A trooper.

2299
02:11:05,580 --> 02:11:08,250
I still to this day I'll go back and
I watched this and I can't believe it

2300
02:11:08,251 --> 02:11:09,084
really happened.

2301
02:11:09,660 --> 02:11:14,660
Didn't you have a guy named Brian that
tested everything before that they had to

2302
02:11:14,701 --> 02:11:18,900
test it? No, there was a
bunch of guys. But Josh, Josh
Silverman, he was the, well,

2303
02:11:18,901 --> 02:11:22,320
he was the beast done. Um,
producer. He produced it.

2304
02:11:22,321 --> 02:11:26,090
He had done a bunch of
different crazy shows. He's out.

2305
02:11:26,091 --> 02:11:27,540
He actually had been on a reality show.

2306
02:11:27,540 --> 02:11:32,280
He's on Ted Nugent's reality show at one
point in time as a contestant. Rarely,

2307
02:11:32,460 --> 02:11:35,610
but that guy was nuts and he was
[inaudible]. He was getting dark.

2308
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:38,520
Like his mind was getting
very dark from all of the, uh,

2309
02:11:38,610 --> 02:11:40,860
coming up with the different
stunts for these people.

2310
02:11:40,861 --> 02:11:44,030
Like figuring out different ways
to get people to fucking pull, uh,

2311
02:11:44,160 --> 02:11:47,970
like bison hearts out of a
swimming pool filled with blood.

2312
02:11:47,971 --> 02:11:50,790
Like they kept coming up with more and
more fucked up things and I was like,

2313
02:11:50,791 --> 02:11:54,420
this is gotta be bad for your brain.
Like to ha like this is your job.

2314
02:11:54,660 --> 02:11:59,060
And he was like, totally. It's definitely,
it's not good. Yeah. It was like this not,

2315
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:01,410
it's not good to think about
this kind of stuff all the time.

2316
02:12:01,710 --> 02:12:04,710
That's why they came up with
this drinking come thing I think.

2317
02:12:04,890 --> 02:12:06,450
I think they got so lost,

2318
02:12:06,630 --> 02:12:10,230
they didn't realize like how insane this
is going to be to the rest of the world.

2319
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:13,040
Like they were like, look gay. They
gave us the green light. Let's do it.

2320
02:12:13,041 --> 02:12:15,240
We're gonna push the envelope.
It was pushed you off. All right,

2321
02:12:15,241 --> 02:12:18,150
we're going to do lunch on Tuesday and
like the network and the executive would

2322
02:12:18,151 --> 02:12:19,830
high five each other. They,
they're so out of touch.

2323
02:12:19,831 --> 02:12:22,290
They had no idea that the rest
of the world was going to go.

2324
02:12:22,291 --> 02:12:25,920
You make people drink, come
on TV, even drinking piss.

2325
02:12:26,250 --> 02:12:27,390
Like they just making people drink.

2326
02:12:27,391 --> 02:12:29,250
Pisses is probably enough
to get the show canceled,

2327
02:12:29,580 --> 02:12:33,330
but the fact that there was pissed and
come together, the network is like,

2328
02:12:33,331 --> 02:12:34,830
what did we do?
What happened here?

2329
02:12:35,580 --> 02:12:39,150
They should bring it back but put on
Netflix friends censored and make it like

2330
02:12:39,151 --> 02:12:42,660
the grossest of gross. Well,
I'm not doing it. I'm done.

2331
02:12:42,680 --> 02:12:44,730
Like eating yeast infection.
I'll never do it again.

2332
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:48,180
A kit we can you see a yeast infection
would have totally creamy. Oh No,

2333
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:51,630
it's cream. It goes to the same in
Grecian comes out, he's scooping,

2334
02:12:52,170 --> 02:12:56,390
scooping it up like it's like he's making
pizza or I've had this hurricane doe

2335
02:12:56,470 --> 02:12:58,170
chunky.
You've had a curdled.

2336
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:02,430
I mean I've put on my deck and it's been
like chunks of white east all over it.

2337
02:13:02,590 --> 02:13:04,740
Yeah, that's not good. Again,

2338
02:13:04,741 --> 02:13:08,970
the quality of the company that you
keep out as reflected in many shitty

2339
02:13:08,971 --> 02:13:12,270
decisions that you've made in this
crazy life. What's wrong with you? Boy,

2340
02:13:12,271 --> 02:13:16,170
she had diabetes, she had diabetes
and that affects your vagina. Oh yeah.

2341
02:13:16,171 --> 02:13:18,600
You get yeast infections all day.
That makes sense.

2342
02:13:18,601 --> 02:13:22,740
I guess your whole body is out
of whack. They say a lot of, um,

2343
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:27,060
lot of issues that people
have with various bacteria
levels and things like that.

2344
02:13:27,061 --> 02:13:30,840
You could be mitigated with
just probiotics that people
took probiotics, all the,

2345
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,010
it'd be less

2346
02:13:32,010 --> 02:13:36,570
ease. Infections, like a lot of
less, lot less, uh, bacterial issues.

2347
02:13:37,110 --> 02:13:40,290
Yeah. A lot of aloe drink
an ally. Do you, uh,

2348
02:13:40,410 --> 02:13:45,390
do you eat healthy Jim
Florentine probiotics every
day? You look healthy as, fuck,

2349
02:13:45,960 --> 02:13:50,610
I just lost 25 pounds. Did you? Yeah.
What'd you do? Why not juice fast? Well,

2350
02:13:50,611 --> 02:13:55,440
I got a divorce so that, that
helps. That helps. Yeah. 13 days.

2351
02:13:55,441 --> 02:13:58,440
No food. Comics with the
divorces, that's rare.

2352
02:13:59,100 --> 02:14:01,470
Usually it works out and it dies.
I know.

2353
02:14:03,720 --> 02:14:07,260
It's like when a comics happily married,
he goes, you okay, what's wrong with him?

2354
02:14:07,510 --> 02:14:10,810
Is he all right on that
for dicey is still fun.

2355
02:14:10,860 --> 02:14:14,580
Just came to my wedding and he goes,
first of all, he goes, look, he goes,

2356
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:17,850
I look at all your friends here.
He goes to roll a bunch of fucking creeps.

2357
02:14:17,910 --> 02:14:21,690
I don't know where they've come by, where
these people work. He goes here, take us.

2358
02:14:21,691 --> 02:14:23,070
He just handed me a wad of cash.
He goes,

2359
02:14:23,071 --> 02:14:25,800
I'm not even going to leave an envelope
because somebody is gonna steal it.

2360
02:14:25,801 --> 02:14:29,280
Put this in your pocket now and
that he wishes. He goes, look,

2361
02:14:29,281 --> 02:14:31,890
you're wife's lovely and this
is a great day for you guys,

2362
02:14:31,891 --> 02:14:35,280
but just know one day she's
going to hate your guts.

2363
02:14:36,690 --> 02:14:40,200
So he was right.
Did they think,

2364
02:14:40,230 --> 02:14:44,070
did I, you're a wild man.
You're always doing stand up.

2365
02:14:44,071 --> 02:14:47,910
You keep crazy friends. Did you date
girls and think they could change you?

2366
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:51,900
Is it one of those things where like
he's a smart guy, he's really nice.

2367
02:14:52,110 --> 02:14:54,510
I just think that if I just
get a hold of we, you know,

2368
02:14:54,511 --> 02:14:58,170
we'll work it out now because I
always want to have to the crazy ones.

2369
02:14:58,171 --> 02:15:02,730
I never went after a normal one. It
probably showed of that party might. Nah,

2370
02:15:02,731 --> 02:15:05,990
I mean, you know, no, I didn't
always like that. The wild ones.

2371
02:15:05,991 --> 02:15:09,600
So they weren't looking to tame anybody.
How do you find a normal person? Yeah.

2372
02:15:09,601 --> 02:15:11,160
You can't even find a normal personality.

2373
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:14,730
Normal people are not going to find
you, first of all, where are you going?

2374
02:15:14,760 --> 02:15:18,600
You're going to the comedy store, you're
going to a bar. It's just hanging out at,

2375
02:15:18,610 --> 02:15:20,670
at apple on weekends off,

2376
02:15:20,671 --> 02:15:23,040
you know they work nine to five
and you're working weekends.

2377
02:15:23,041 --> 02:15:23,970
You never get to see,
um,

2378
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,190
that's when they want to hang with
their friends and go to like fucking

2379
02:15:26,191 --> 02:15:29,670
Applebee's or some shit.
The all around as a comic,

2380
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:34,590
your hours are so fucked and your
lifestyle so crazy that unless the girl is

2381
02:15:34,591 --> 02:15:36,780
living some sort of a
crazy life of her own,

2382
02:15:37,080 --> 02:15:38,910
she's not going to
understand like a stripper.

2383
02:15:38,911 --> 02:15:42,590
That's why they have the same
hours. Exactly. Well a lot
of comics went up, Danes,

2384
02:15:42,591 --> 02:15:43,830
strippers for a bunch of reasons,

2385
02:15:43,831 --> 02:15:48,600
but that's a big one of them is just that
some girls like you're out every night.

2386
02:15:48,630 --> 02:15:50,760
Like I've had friends that I've lost.

2387
02:15:50,910 --> 02:15:53,700
Like they don't do standup anymore
because their wife could upset.

2388
02:15:53,730 --> 02:15:57,810
They were out two months doing stand up
and if you gotta if you're gonna be a

2389
02:15:57,811 --> 02:16:01,920
good comic, you have to work a lot. You
have to work every week. You have to,

2390
02:16:01,921 --> 02:16:03,810
I mean, you might be able to
take weeks off here and there,

2391
02:16:03,811 --> 02:16:06,000
but essentially you're
working several days a week,

2392
02:16:06,001 --> 02:16:09,480
every week and you're doing it at night
and you've got a right and you've got to

2393
02:16:09,481 --> 02:16:12,270
work on new shit and you've
got to constantly be in
that zone and you've got to

2394
02:16:12,271 --> 02:16:14,730
go to the clubs. He got to, you
have to, if you don't do it,

2395
02:16:14,731 --> 02:16:17,130
you're not going to develop material.
Yeah. So if you're dating someone,

2396
02:16:17,131 --> 02:16:18,300
they're like, why do
you, I don't understand.

2397
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:22,050
You're not even getting paid for this.
You're getting like $15 like fuck,

2398
02:16:22,110 --> 02:16:25,110
that is not, no, I'm working like, where
do you think these jokes come from?

2399
02:16:25,111 --> 02:16:28,170
They don't come from the fucking choke
fairy. Like these bitches need to grow.

2400
02:16:28,171 --> 02:16:29,920
I've got to go water.
The, you know, that's,

2401
02:16:30,160 --> 02:16:32,410
that's what you do. You go to the
comedy store on a Tuesday night,

2402
02:16:32,411 --> 02:16:35,280
you're watering the garden. So
the fuck you're doing. Yeah.

2403
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:39,730
A lot of people can't get that concept
working for food or just not working at

2404
02:16:39,731 --> 02:16:43,720
all during the week though. Sets
they want to hang out, watch a movie.

2405
02:16:43,721 --> 02:16:47,110
It's Tuesday night TV
show and they're like,

2406
02:16:47,111 --> 02:16:48,360
you're going to go out there for free.

2407
02:16:48,610 --> 02:16:51,100
How many people are going to be
at for people? Is that worth it?

2408
02:16:51,580 --> 02:16:52,300
They don't get it.

2409
02:16:52,300 --> 02:16:56,190
Those conversations we used to be
so frustrating to me but I get it.

2410
02:16:56,320 --> 02:17:00,250
I get it in from the girls' point of view,
you know she wants a normal life.

2411
02:17:00,280 --> 02:17:01,240
People want a normal life.

2412
02:17:01,241 --> 02:17:05,800
They want someone who's going to be home
on no normal daytime hours that I want

2413
02:17:05,801 --> 02:17:08,680
some guys calling them from,
from the road cause he did ecstasy.

2414
02:17:12,130 --> 02:17:17,050
They want shit to be normal. I get it.
But strippers don't. So like if you're,

2415
02:17:17,051 --> 02:17:20,530
unless she really wants to settle
down and be normal and she's just,

2416
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:23,530
she's in the last days of
stripping like this is it.

2417
02:17:23,590 --> 02:17:27,250
I'm almost 30 I'm so tired of this.
It's such bullshit.

2418
02:17:27,820 --> 02:17:32,530
He's roped me in one of those problem.
But you got a wild 24 year old, Jesus,

2419
02:17:32,580 --> 02:17:35,800
forget it and it, yeah. Jesus
Christ, him flying team.

2420
02:17:36,480 --> 02:17:38,980
So that's why I think cam
girls is the way they future.

2421
02:17:38,981 --> 02:17:41,980
Cause when you're out at the comedy club
they could be squirting and at home,

2422
02:17:42,070 --> 02:17:43,720
you know,
and then you just have like a,

2423
02:17:43,930 --> 02:17:48,720
you're still committed to that score
and thing. Um, it is p unproven. No,

2424
02:17:48,730 --> 02:17:52,630
it's been proven scientifically that
it's p they have actual studies now,

2425
02:17:52,960 --> 02:17:56,930
Tony Hinchcliffe makes fun of
you in his act actually wrong.

2426
02:17:57,250 --> 02:18:00,610
It's completely wrong because scientists,
Brian's here, ladies and gentlemen,

2427
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:03,430
you get all the retarded shit.
He said during the past two hours.

2428
02:18:03,570 --> 02:18:04,510
Want to clear things up.

2429
02:18:04,511 --> 02:18:07,000
Now there's intelligence when
the knowledge of squirting,

2430
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:09,430
when vice did the article
about squirting being p,

2431
02:18:09,490 --> 02:18:10,540
there's a lot of people did an article.

2432
02:18:11,210 --> 02:18:13,720
It's the same base thing
that even when we had,

2433
02:18:13,721 --> 02:18:15,820
what's his face in here the
other day, he even goes, no,

2434
02:18:15,821 --> 02:18:17,710
I get what you're saying there.
It's two different kinds of,

2435
02:18:17,711 --> 02:18:20,230
have you ever had sex with a
girl and after you're done,

2436
02:18:20,350 --> 02:18:24,480
there's a mungus water like spot on
your, on your blanket. Yeah. Right.

2437
02:18:24,760 --> 02:18:28,270
That's squirting. That's gushing. It's,
that's what I'm talking about. What,

2438
02:18:28,370 --> 02:18:31,780
what those reports are talking about
when it's shooting out, projecting.

2439
02:18:31,990 --> 02:18:36,070
That's p that's obviously P it's coming
out of the pee hole, but gushing,

2440
02:18:37,480 --> 02:18:39,760
gushing is what I'm talking
about and get some girls.

2441
02:18:40,060 --> 02:18:44,080
Some girls you can hit a certain part
of their g spot and you'll feel like a

2442
02:18:44,081 --> 02:18:48,910
flood come out and that is not
p and even Dr drew says it.

2443
02:18:48,910 --> 02:18:50,990
A lot of people even say
after drew says abductors,

2444
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,400
you're also says pot is addictive.
He said that a long time ago.

2445
02:18:54,401 --> 02:18:57,010
Albums you let them go now
because you're on his side.

2446
02:18:57,011 --> 02:18:59,170
When it comes to squirting,
I think what it is,

2447
02:18:59,380 --> 02:19:01,440
he used to be anti Dr
drew when it came to weed,

2448
02:19:01,441 --> 02:19:05,350
but according to him is more important
than we'd squirting is his big foot.

2449
02:19:05,710 --> 02:19:08,070
He will fucking argue with you
if you tell him scoring out.

2450
02:19:08,110 --> 02:19:12,070
Real squirting is the loch ness monster.
Squirting is his UFO.

2451
02:19:12,250 --> 02:19:16,510
Who thinks squirting is cheesy, but
I can't make girl squirt. Yeah, dude,

2452
02:19:16,540 --> 02:19:19,210
you can't do it. No. You know, I mean,

2453
02:19:19,211 --> 02:19:22,540
I know how to get them to drink a
gallon of water and piss all over you.

2454
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:28,550
You can feel it.
It's like when Jesus touches me,

2455
02:19:28,790 --> 02:19:30,800
I can't describe it bro.
I just feel it.

2456
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:34,040
You'd saying every girl can squirt
like you can make any girls.

2457
02:19:34,400 --> 02:19:38,000
Most girls can square it. I think
they drink a lot of water. Hold it in.

2458
02:19:38,030 --> 02:19:39,910
Wait for Brian to finger on price.

2459
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:44,150
It's what I'm saying is real,

2460
02:19:44,180 --> 02:19:47,730
but the UFO fanatic, it's, it's,

2461
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:50,930
I think most guys I've had that experience
when you're with a girl and you're

2462
02:19:50,931 --> 02:19:53,750
like, Holy Shit, you were really
wet this time and you look down,

2463
02:19:53,770 --> 02:19:56,740
there's a huge wet spot. That's
what I'm talking about. Well yeah.

2464
02:19:56,780 --> 02:20:01,440
Girls have vaginal, vaginal
rather. Lubrication comes
out of their body sometimes,

2465
02:20:02,690 --> 02:20:05,280
but it doesn't ever score
it out. It doesn't our score
it out like on the video,

2466
02:20:05,740 --> 02:20:10,460
but girls are going like this is fucking
pissing all over the camera. Right.

2467
02:20:10,461 --> 02:20:12,230
That's, that's the
problem. That's, that's,

2468
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:17,390
that's p obviously you like a slippery
politician have changed your stance. No,

2469
02:20:17,391 --> 02:20:21,320
I've never changed to say that
the spray was a different type.

2470
02:20:21,321 --> 02:20:24,320
I've never said it was different than
urine. I've never said that. Well,

2471
02:20:24,410 --> 02:20:27,110
the core basic, when you see something
squared, I got girls pee hole.

2472
02:20:27,110 --> 02:20:32,110
It's a last podcast where squirting was
discussed and Brian angrily yet again

2473
02:20:33,860 --> 02:20:38,750
defended the art of scoring. I've always
said the exact factors of squirting. No,

2474
02:20:38,751 --> 02:20:42,310
you definitely said recording. He's
real and now you're saying gushing term.

2475
02:20:42,350 --> 02:20:45,590
What you guys are calling it
squirting is in the business.

2476
02:20:45,620 --> 02:20:50,450
You know a lot of you like fucking
pedestrians. You have your terms.

2477
02:20:50,540 --> 02:20:54,590
I know your terms cording and as
pros we were first two is gushing.

2478
02:20:54,860 --> 02:20:59,310
It's gushing. Yeah, she was a gusher.
Right, and that's what, and that's what,

2479
02:20:59,600 --> 02:21:02,780
what's confusing, what people
think squirting is fake and stuff.

2480
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:05,810
The people are confused. A lot of
things. When you have sex with a girl,

2481
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:09,740
sometimes it's a little wet, right? But
there's sometimes where you could have,

2482
02:21:09,770 --> 02:21:14,770
you could feel it just pouring out of
her and it won't stop and she's all over

2483
02:21:15,011 --> 02:21:15,500
the place.

2484
02:21:15,500 --> 02:21:18,050
She's going to be like the wicked witch
of the West and Maltin you were to take

2485
02:21:18,051 --> 02:21:23,020
all that juice, throw it in a test tube
that's not p. Okay, decides this is Brian.

2486
02:21:23,021 --> 02:21:26,480
What if she go perform these tests? They,
I've heard many people talk about it,

2487
02:21:26,481 --> 02:21:29,690
including documentary,
talking about bring up some fun,

2488
02:21:29,691 --> 02:21:32,570
some facts doctor drew about squirting.
Go Google that.

2489
02:21:33,080 --> 02:21:37,800
I don't need to already know about
this a million times to calm then, Huh?

2490
02:21:38,270 --> 02:21:41,610
Yeah. It's a mixture of, no it's not.

2491
02:21:42,050 --> 02:21:45,530
But the scientists that have
studied it say it's p sorry,

2492
02:21:45,950 --> 02:21:48,800
but how do you know I can use a computer?

2493
02:21:48,801 --> 02:21:51,680
I just know I don't need no fancy science.

2494
02:21:51,700 --> 02:21:53,780
I don't have a companion
friend Jesus in my heart.

2495
02:21:54,170 --> 02:21:56,180
What would you mind if it was pay it

2496
02:21:58,750 --> 02:21:59,583
and that's it.

2497
02:22:01,100 --> 02:22:05,060
And that's another thing and that's
another thing is the story of this whole

2498
02:22:05,061 --> 02:22:08,750
conversation. And that's another thing
because I've actually had a girl,

2499
02:22:08,780 --> 02:22:12,850
gosh or squirt or whatever while I was
eating her out before and I grew up in

2500
02:22:12,860 --> 02:22:16,970
your mouth. It did not taste
like p because he knows
he's drinking a lot of P's.

2501
02:22:16,971 --> 02:22:20,690
Basically. The piece or Malia
it was, it was a mixture.

2502
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:24,250
It was a measure that is his,
I mean,

2503
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:26,550
cosmo Martinis,

2504
02:22:26,730 --> 02:22:30,570
the girls come is usually has a
hints of pee in it, but it's not,

2505
02:22:31,080 --> 02:22:34,350
it's not urine. Okay. And
what about Oak Tannins?

2506
02:22:35,050 --> 02:22:37,920
All the stuff that they find
from those aged barrels.

2507
02:22:40,020 --> 02:22:43,020
It gets bad. I'm not getting
mad. It's just like, dude,

2508
02:22:43,021 --> 02:22:46,170
definitely get upset when it comes to
the topic of squirting. You defend it.

2509
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:49,590
Like it's a religious thing because
people are so confused about it.

2510
02:22:50,490 --> 02:22:51,340
Super confused.

2511
02:22:51,341 --> 02:22:54,840
It's a matter of fact is they're giving
a lot of university level courses on it

2512
02:22:54,841 --> 02:22:58,500
because there's so much confusion
about whether or not scoring is p no.

2513
02:22:58,501 --> 02:22:59,240
When you see it,

2514
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:03,750
what you see him in porn is usually a
water that's been put up there or urine

2515
02:23:03,751 --> 02:23:06,300
like you said. But that's not
what I'm fucking talking about.

2516
02:23:06,301 --> 02:23:09,090
I'm talking about there's ways that you
can hit the g spot with your Dick and

2517
02:23:09,091 --> 02:23:13,680
make the girl. Gosh. Um, I dunno. I
don't think too many people bother.

2518
02:23:13,681 --> 02:23:16,860
I didn't even, they didn't squirt
even a little in the old point.

2519
02:23:17,160 --> 02:23:19,950
What are they doing differently? Do they
not know what they're doing back then?

2520
02:23:19,950 --> 02:23:23,100
Ron, Jeremy, Ron. Jeremy didn't know how
to lay some dick out. No, that's fake.

2521
02:23:23,101 --> 02:23:25,110
That's what I'm saying is fake.
What are you talking about?

2522
02:23:25,230 --> 02:23:29,010
I'm saying that the stuff that you see
in porn that you guys think is squirting

2523
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:31,680
is water that has the guys you dummies.

2524
02:23:32,850 --> 02:23:35,280
That's like you so called Christians.

2525
02:23:36,540 --> 02:23:39,300
He's like a religious fanatic over there.
I don't think most people care.

2526
02:23:39,570 --> 02:23:43,550
You know, like yeah, you could go, you
know at district squirt it last night.

2527
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:45,900
Like that's actually pay like Oh really?
And that's it.

2528
02:23:46,220 --> 02:23:50,850
Oh I know what that it was at my mouth.
All right, well whatever I drank pay,

2529
02:23:50,940 --> 02:23:55,740
I'll call that a collection. Some Gosh,
you didn't need it to the rubber gloves.

2530
02:23:55,741 --> 02:23:59,580
You got to need a chain of command, chain
of custody. You got to scrape it up.

2531
02:23:59,581 --> 02:24:02,820
You have to guide there in a sealed
envelope. Take it to the lab.

2532
02:24:03,240 --> 02:24:05,520
I don't know what the fuck you're gonna
do with it on the way to the airport.

2533
02:24:05,730 --> 02:24:08,880
Hopefully she doesn't have
a yeast infection at the
same time cause that's what

2534
02:24:08,881 --> 02:24:13,020
it makes sense with the
studies. Frothy. Gosh,

2535
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:14,820
okay.

2536
02:24:14,820 --> 02:24:17,760
Definitely need to go back to smoking.
Cigarettes will tell you that. Why?

2537
02:24:17,970 --> 02:24:21,630
Because your brain, what happened
over the last few days. It's shocking.

2538
02:24:21,660 --> 02:24:24,300
But what I've been saying right now,
it's so accurate and

2539
02:24:27,240 --> 02:24:31,320
the fact that you were actually defending
squirting the fact that I could troll

2540
02:24:31,321 --> 02:24:35,460
you so hard that I could just,
it's just all I have to say,

2541
02:24:35,461 --> 02:24:38,850
it's squirting as p and you will
go into a fucking frothy panic.

2542
02:24:38,890 --> 02:24:40,640
Okay.
Okay.

2543
02:24:41,050 --> 02:24:44,020
No, I'm not getting into a panic. I
just said people defensive. It's a,

2544
02:24:44,021 --> 02:24:46,630
it's an annoying when people go
to knowing when people on Twitter,

2545
02:24:46,820 --> 02:24:50,740
my Jesus squirting, it's not
real. And like it's like,
all right, well guess what?

2546
02:24:50,741 --> 02:24:53,210
The expired that's coming
your way today, Fella. I know.

2547
02:24:54,430 --> 02:24:56,230
What's your Twitter handle?
Red Band.

2548
02:24:56,380 --> 02:25:00,280
[inaudible] I gotta give you a lot
of fucking medical studies on pice.

2549
02:25:01,490 --> 02:25:05,470
Various properties of pissed. It's
gushing. Guys. Guys don't even know.

2550
02:25:05,620 --> 02:25:08,260
She's such amateurs. You don't
even know how to make a girl Gush.

2551
02:25:09,090 --> 02:25:09,490
Yeah.

2552
02:25:09,490 --> 02:25:11,320
So you can make every girl,
not every girl,

2553
02:25:11,321 --> 02:25:14,230
but I couldn't make a lot of lives
because of the shape of my Dick and like a

2554
02:25:14,231 --> 02:25:17,440
certain way. What's wrong with it?
It's pointed towards my debt, my face.

2555
02:25:17,441 --> 02:25:20,740
So it's kind of like bent
towards my face and a,

2556
02:25:20,741 --> 02:25:24,070
if you put your like a his legs
up between your shoulder and make

2557
02:25:24,080 --> 02:25:27,400
me throw up this podcast.
We're about to end soon.

2558
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:30,600
So you've got to put it over your legs.
Yeah, usually over your shoulders.

2559
02:25:30,820 --> 02:25:35,560
Relax over. Yeah. And it's got a band up.
Well, I don't know if it has to bend up,

2560
02:25:35,561 --> 02:25:38,500
but I'm just saying that that's why
I think I've had such great success.

2561
02:25:40,240 --> 02:25:44,650
You should give seminars. I just
did. No, you just explained.

2562
02:25:44,651 --> 02:25:48,890
It should give seminars where you're
like, walk around people, tell him, nope,

2563
02:25:48,990 --> 02:25:50,860
your hips over here like a yoga class.

2564
02:25:51,850 --> 02:25:55,270
Wait down here or it looks at every
guy's deck. Nope, doesn't end up.

2565
02:25:55,820 --> 02:25:58,180
You got to break your Dick.
I could take your money,

2566
02:25:58,181 --> 02:26:00,520
but you're not going to be able to do it.
I know he's a young age.

2567
02:26:00,521 --> 02:26:03,310
You could just put it underneath your
belt buckle and it will grow that way

2568
02:26:03,311 --> 02:26:05,410
around your belly.
So every time you have a bone here,

2569
02:26:05,411 --> 02:26:08,290
just puts it straight up north.
He's 40 grown man.

2570
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:10,760
That reminds me of a Brady
bunch episode where Bobby,

2571
02:26:10,761 --> 02:26:14,230
you want it to be taller so he hung
from the swing set was arms. Yeah,

2572
02:26:14,410 --> 02:26:16,660
cause he wanted to be taller. I
remember that episode. So that's what,

2573
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:20,470
that's what I was pretty, but you're
going to stays up. Deli is a natural,

2574
02:26:21,010 --> 02:26:24,310
the Brady bunch and wasn't real.
And he's a real person.

2575
02:26:24,730 --> 02:26:25,630
You really fucking believe.

2576
02:26:26,390 --> 02:26:29,190
I really believe it's going to change
the shape of your Dick by tucking it in

2577
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:31,330
your balls. You know what?
I'm wearing a belt right now.

2578
02:26:31,331 --> 02:26:33,910
I'm going to do around the
right, wrap it up, tie it or not.

2579
02:26:34,690 --> 02:26:37,510
Maybe you get one of those versus Florida.
And I'm looking for a squirter.

2580
02:26:40,960 --> 02:26:45,370
I've had some pretty good squirters. Okay,
buddy. All right, let's wrap this up.

2581
02:26:45,460 --> 02:26:49,810
Belly button. Thanks for showing
up. You're the best, Jim Florentine.

2582
02:26:49,811 --> 02:26:53,390

Beautiful.

2588
02:27:11,230 --> 02:27:13,240
But I didn't get caught cause people

in that order. Yeah. I just,

2598
02:27:46,360 --> 02:27:50,330
it had a nice ring to it.
Dude. I go, I forgot to talk
to you about this one. Dude.

2599
02:27:50,770 --> 02:27:54,610
Ask you off the air, but your
friend who uh, lives in Florida,

2600
02:27:54,670 --> 02:27:57,730
some crazy friend who was listening
to your radio show, Gary from Florida.

2601
02:27:57,760 --> 02:27:59,300
Is it the, the nutty dude? Yeah.

2602
02:27:59,410 --> 02:28:01,750
Fucks all these girls and has
all these ridiculous stories.

2603
02:28:02,130 --> 02:28:03,180
Fucks him in the ass person.

2604
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:07,180
I cook some chicken Marsala and I
thought some of the gas you will,

2605
02:28:07,181 --> 02:28:09,550
you talking to him? Were you
talking about him? I don't remember.

2606
02:28:09,551 --> 02:28:11,410
It was on the radio show,
but I was fuck,

2607
02:28:11,540 --> 02:28:15,220
I sat in my car out here in this parking
lot was laughing like a mental patient.

2608
02:28:15,280 --> 02:28:17,440
I was just with him this past weekend.
He's insane.

2609
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:22,040
He goes on these dating websites
and gets these girls. He, he started

2610
02:28:22,040 --> 02:28:25,820
when he was 35. He did, he put
in from 40 to 65 cause he goes,

2611
02:28:25,821 --> 02:28:29,240
no one at 35 wants to fuck those women.
I will.

2612
02:28:29,770 --> 02:28:31,640
It's like I'm not going
after a 22 year olds.

2613
02:28:31,641 --> 02:28:36,350
So some 52 year old and Florida
single, you know, big tits,

2614
02:28:36,351 --> 02:28:38,900
divorced, Tan, take about
one day. Take a look,

2615
02:28:38,901 --> 02:28:42,920
just feed me and fuck me was like
first night, right? And yes. Whoa.

2616
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:46,940
Eight at a 10 times eight out
of 10 pain in his pen. Wow.

2617
02:28:47,120 --> 02:28:49,400
He looks like a bloated Tony,
Dan. So I'll let you know.

2618
02:28:51,950 --> 02:28:55,970
So it works for him. And he and a 35 year
old wants to the funk of 52 year old.

2619
02:28:55,971 --> 02:28:59,900
So he's got that market. That's smart.
Yeah. Oh yeah. He's always been like that.

2620
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:05,960
Hey, leave a message. I just
fucked a 64 year olds. He goes,

2621
02:29:05,961 --> 02:29:06,531
she,
she was,

2622
02:29:06,531 --> 02:29:09,320
she wanted to be in bed by eight so I'm
going back out trying to get another one.

2623
02:29:10,070 --> 02:29:14,930
Oh my God. That's so bizarre.
That's a smart move though.

2624
02:29:14,931 --> 02:29:16,820
If you want numbers,
you want to put up numbers.

2625
02:29:17,090 --> 02:29:20,300
That's all he cared about
was numbers. He's like, look,

2626
02:29:20,301 --> 02:29:23,030
I got to get a hall of fame numbers.
It's all I'm looking for.

2627
02:29:23,360 --> 02:29:26,510
And these when we get attached to
him or they don't care, I want Dick.

2628
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:29,890
It's Florida. They don't care. They
don't care. Cause Florida. Yeah, Florida.

2629
02:29:29,891 --> 02:29:32,300
It's a whole other animal down there.
They don't give a shit.

2630
02:29:32,301 --> 02:29:34,670
They moved from one to another
to another. Really? Yeah.

2631
02:29:34,671 --> 02:29:37,640
He might go see him one more time and
they don't even bother him after that.

2632
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:40,370
Really. Especially an older woman, they're
just set in their ways. They're like,

2633
02:29:40,371 --> 02:29:42,320
look, I just want to get laid. Right.

2634
02:29:42,830 --> 02:29:45,470
I could get that like they
not looking for a man anymore.

2635
02:29:45,650 --> 02:29:49,310
Now it's come along and tell him what to
do. Yeah, they got luck, man. I'm horny.

2636
02:29:49,311 --> 02:29:52,430
It's been awhile. Wow.
A lot of times he what?

2637
02:29:52,431 --> 02:29:56,570
He tried to do it without even
getting dinner. He's like, let me see.

2638
02:29:56,571 --> 02:29:59,410
He tried to pull that one off.
Just meet him for a drink. Right.

2639
02:29:59,560 --> 02:30:01,130
He is a move was never to go,

2640
02:30:01,540 --> 02:30:04,760
let's meet at six it was always like
eight 30 so he didn't have to buy him

2641
02:30:04,761 --> 02:30:07,580
dinner. He's like, they're
definitely going to eat by then,

2642
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:13,850
so he had his strategy. Yeah, Gary,

2643
02:30:14,010 --> 02:30:16,680
I mean you're banging her in the ass the
first night you probably could buy or a

2644
02:30:16,681 --> 02:30:20,390
dinner. It's worth it.
It's worth $150 dinner.

2645
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:24,110
Was he because he didn't want to take a
chance of being stuck at dinner or was

2646
02:30:24,111 --> 02:30:27,350
he trying to save money,
save money and just be complete dirt bag?

2647
02:30:28,310 --> 02:30:31,820
That's the only reason cause you'd get
stuck in a horrible conversation if you

2648
02:30:31,821 --> 02:30:35,660
commit to dinner and as you just met this
person and like five minutes into the

2649
02:30:35,661 --> 02:30:38,630
conversation and realize they're
fucking crazy. Like, oh no,

2650
02:30:38,631 --> 02:30:41,690
I'm going to have a meal
with this person. Shit. Yeah.

2651
02:30:42,110 --> 02:30:43,940
Then you just got to find the waiter.
I'll be right back.

2652
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,090
You'll find the waiter give the waiter
money and you'd get the fuck out of dodge

2653
02:30:47,091 --> 02:30:50,000
before they even know what hit him.
Just walk out the front door run. Yeah,

2654
02:30:50,001 --> 02:30:50,781
but what if he drove?

2655
02:30:50,781 --> 02:30:53,300
I had that problem with that meth
head check a couple of weeks ago.

2656
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:55,850
Did you drive?
If she drove you got a problem.

2657
02:30:56,540 --> 02:30:59,420
Well then even then you just get an Uber.
You live in the new world.

2658
02:30:59,421 --> 02:31:01,580
It's a new world gym flooring.
You don't have to worry about that.

2659
02:31:01,581 --> 02:31:02,720
Worry about that crap.
Well,

2660
02:31:02,721 --> 02:31:05,510
he would just meet them for a drink and
then he figured if it was going to work,

2661
02:31:05,511 --> 02:31:10,490
hey, let's go back always by his,
his house close by within a mile.

2662
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:14,840
Hey, let's go back to my place while
another one. But if he goes to his place,

2663
02:31:14,850 --> 02:31:17,120
then he's got to get them out.
He gets a day,

2664
02:31:17,121 --> 02:31:20,100
always want to leave right afterwards.
They don't want to stay. Yes. That's

2665
02:31:20,100 --> 02:31:23,430
hilarious. I know. So there's just
different, she had a different animal,

2666
02:31:23,460 --> 02:31:27,270
different animal than a woman is trying
to carve out a relationship like this is

2667
02:31:27,300 --> 02:31:29,670
maybe Jim Florentine is the one.

2668
02:31:29,910 --> 02:31:32,610
Maybe I could settle down with Jim
Florentine and have some babies instead of

2669
02:31:32,611 --> 02:31:36,120
that. She's like, nope,
nope. I just want some Dick.

2670
02:31:36,720 --> 02:31:40,530
I'm 50 I just want someone to fuck me in
my mouth and then get out of the house.

2671
02:31:42,150 --> 02:31:45,760
Pretty much. My nephew and my
nephew just moved to Florida.

2672
02:31:45,761 --> 02:31:49,980
He's a 27 I made, he is cleaning up down
there cause he used to live. I said,

2673
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:53,610
oh you got to put up like Coors field
numbers. You know what I mean? Like,

2674
02:31:53,611 --> 02:31:55,500
of course, field a baseball,
a boy, the boy, you know,

2675
02:31:55,530 --> 02:31:57,750
because of the quality at a
balls just fly out of there.

2676
02:31:57,990 --> 02:32:00,630
The numbers are just skewered.
He's almost like he's on roids.

2677
02:32:00,631 --> 02:32:02,190
I write people up the altitude.

2678
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:06,460
I sent people looking back
at your baseball card from
New Jersey to Florida and

2679
02:32:06,690 --> 02:32:07,770
he was definitely doing Royce,

2680
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:11,580
what was going on in these years
because now I live in, in Florida. Okay.

2681
02:32:11,581 --> 02:32:15,330
Then he wasn't doing roids. Yeah.
Florida is the party state. It's insane.

2682
02:32:15,440 --> 02:32:19,880
It's those Florida man Twitter, uh,
notices. Have you ever seen those? No.

2683
02:32:19,881 --> 02:32:22,550
But Burke Christ page. Yeah.
Burt crushed from Florida.

2684
02:32:22,700 --> 02:32:26,390
But Florida man is a page on Twitter.
And if you go to Florida, man, uh,

2685
02:32:26,440 --> 02:32:28,130
on the Twitter feed,

2686
02:32:28,131 --> 02:32:31,320
it's all new stories about a guy from
Florida doing something retarded. It's,

2687
02:32:31,850 --> 02:32:34,130
they're just, it's a different
part of the world, man.

2688
02:32:34,131 --> 02:32:35,570
It's completely different
part of the world.

2689
02:32:35,870 --> 02:32:39,720
So if you're a guy who looks like a
bloated Tony Danza bloated Tony Danza just

2690
02:32:39,730 --> 02:32:42,620
cleaning up on the girls who've made
these terrible mistakes into the decades

2691
02:32:42,621 --> 02:32:46,760
pass and now they're just kind
of like settled in, settled in,

2692
02:32:46,761 --> 02:32:48,290
settled in their ways but still get horny

2693
02:32:48,430 --> 02:32:52,150
in my twenties I moved down there
because I want it to get laid. Wow.

2694
02:32:52,510 --> 02:32:55,180
You moved down there specifically because
he wanted to get light moved down and

2695
02:32:55,181 --> 02:32:56,280
high school.
Our family moved down.

2696
02:32:56,290 --> 02:32:59,410
I lived there for two years and I met a
couple of friends and then a couple of

2697
02:32:59,410 --> 02:33:02,350
years later I went down there just to
visit him and I bang like three chicks in

2698
02:33:02,351 --> 02:33:03,184
a week and I'm like,

2699
02:33:03,520 --> 02:33:07,150
I didn't even have three under my belt
and my whole life and then like six

2700
02:33:07,151 --> 02:33:09,240
months later I go, you know what? I'm
just moving down there. I just do.

2701
02:33:09,250 --> 02:33:11,900
I can get laid and that's why
that was the only thing. No.

2702
02:33:11,930 --> 02:33:12,910
What do you think it is?

2703
02:33:12,911 --> 02:33:16,390
Because it's such a transient state cause
that's a big part of what Florida is

2704
02:33:16,391 --> 02:33:19,150
like people from the east coast,
it just moved down there. Yeah.

2705
02:33:19,151 --> 02:33:21,880
Cause you always get that. You get them
in that wild phase for a couple of years.

2706
02:33:21,930 --> 02:33:23,770
Right. Just go, I'm, I want
to get away from my family.

2707
02:33:23,771 --> 02:33:26,290
I just want to go have fun and
I want to try it down here.

2708
02:33:26,291 --> 02:33:28,930
So you get those girls in that phase
and then eventually I moved back to

2709
02:33:28,931 --> 02:33:33,790
wherever they are usually. Yeah. And a lot
of like, you know, it's a lot of white,

2710
02:33:33,910 --> 02:33:34,760
it's a weird stakes.

2711
02:33:34,780 --> 02:33:38,350
A lot of white trash and this hot chicks
in Miami to just rednecks all over.

2712
02:33:38,351 --> 02:33:40,690
It's a weird super weird state.
Yeah.

2713
02:33:40,691 --> 02:33:44,440
It's a weird state too because for the
longest time it was how immigrants coming

2714
02:33:44,441 --> 02:33:45,580
into the country from Cuba

2715
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:49,740
and how they brought drugs in through
Miami. So south Florida was just chaos.

2716
02:33:50,070 --> 02:33:53,520
And then northern Florida is basically
Kentucky. Yup. You know, you're,

2717
02:33:53,521 --> 02:33:56,700
you're basically living in the deep,
deep South in northern Florida.

2718
02:33:56,840 --> 02:33:58,080
The further north you get,

2719
02:33:58,110 --> 02:34:01,830
the more southern United States
you actually get like Florida,

2720
02:34:01,980 --> 02:34:06,060
like the south of Florida. It doesn't
even seem like the south, you know,

2721
02:34:06,061 --> 02:34:10,590
it's more like some weird fucking
offshoot of long island. Yeah, absolutely.

2722
02:34:11,080 --> 02:34:14,530
Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West
Palm Beach. It's a chair. Yeah,

2723
02:34:14,690 --> 02:34:18,250
an island meets the
Caribbean or Long Island

2724
02:34:18,250 --> 02:34:20,800
meets Cuba, you know?
That's what it's like. Yeah.

2725
02:34:20,980 --> 02:34:22,570
It's just like this weird fucking,

2726
02:34:22,630 --> 02:34:26,590
just people that just had to get
the fuck out of dodge and came down.

2727
02:34:28,540 --> 02:34:30,880
Nobody ass fucking town to do comedy too,
but yeah,

2728
02:34:30,980 --> 02:34:33,670
it was just down there in
Miami. Did you stand up? Yeah.

2729
02:34:33,700 --> 02:34:36,430
Where were you working at this place
called the home field comedy club.

2730
02:34:36,670 --> 02:34:40,150
I guess it used to be an
Improv. It's in Kendall. Oh
yeah. Yeah. It was a good Rome.

2731
02:34:40,151 --> 02:34:42,520
I mean it's part of a sports
bar. They don't, it's not like,

2732
02:34:42,970 --> 02:34:45,640
but they got their own back room and
stuff where they do comedy holds like 300

2733
02:34:45,641 --> 02:34:49,240
people. That's cool. Yeah, it was pretty
good. What are you doing over there?

2734
02:34:49,350 --> 02:34:53,260
Accidental child. What? Why
my child? Because you're
playing with your phone. What?

2735
02:34:53,261 --> 02:34:55,090
We're doing a podcast.
I'm sorry.

2736
02:34:59,660 --> 02:35:00,980
Spell it out now.

2737
02:35:00,981 --> 02:35:04,390
It's just putting in Wednesday show at
the comedy store in my calendar. Oh,

2738
02:35:04,450 --> 02:35:08,980
thank you. Um, do you like, do you
still go back to, uh, where you grew up?

2739
02:35:09,130 --> 02:35:13,000
Do you do any standup where you, uh,
where'd you grow up? I grew up in Jersey.

2740
02:35:13,150 --> 02:35:16,920
Do you do stand up like near the
area where you grew up? Distress.

2741
02:35:17,410 --> 02:35:20,380
You know what a stress factor in
New Brunswick. It's a comedy club.

2742
02:35:20,381 --> 02:35:23,230
That's kind of where I started
it. That's a great spot. Yeah.

2743
02:35:23,380 --> 02:35:25,450
New Brunswick's great too
because it's a cool town.

2744
02:35:25,720 --> 02:35:27,990
Cool town right next to Rutgers.
You know,

2745
02:35:28,150 --> 02:35:32,010
I just filmed a comedy special air a few
months back at winii brands please. Oh,

2746
02:35:32,060 --> 02:35:35,860
George Street playhouse. It's a theater
off for like a 400 seat theater. Oh, cool.

2747
02:35:35,890 --> 02:35:37,930
I just did it there. That's
a good place to do it. Yeah.

2748
02:35:37,931 --> 02:35:39,520
I couldn't do it at Vinnie's place.
It was to me.

2749
02:35:39,680 --> 02:35:42,980
I didn't want the comedy club field. I
want to more like a theater field for it.

2750
02:35:43,990 --> 02:35:44,321
Yeah.

2751
02:35:44,321 --> 02:35:48,250
I started doing my last one I did in a
comedy club and I think I'm going to do

2752
02:35:48,251 --> 02:35:51,310
them in the comedy club from now on.
I think that doing them in the theater,

2753
02:35:51,320 --> 02:35:53,890
you just don't, you lose, you
lose something and then a large,

2754
02:35:54,280 --> 02:35:57,880
large stage and I feel like
people at home, you're watching,

2755
02:35:58,210 --> 02:36:01,540
you're in the living room, you know
it's an intimate spot like you, you,

2756
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:04,510
I think you could relate more to someone
on stage in front of like a couple

2757
02:36:04,510 --> 02:36:06,220
hundred people. Then you
know, maybe a thousand or so.

2758
02:36:06,221 --> 02:36:10,990
I think that the model was to get it
sold to a Netflix or showtime and Hbo.

2759
02:36:10,991 --> 02:36:14,440
They want it to look big,
but now you can do it all on your own.

2760
02:36:14,441 --> 02:36:16,900
It doesn't matter as long as it's good.
I don't think it matters.

2761
02:36:16,960 --> 02:36:18,340
I'm also thinking from now on,

2762
02:36:18,341 --> 02:36:20,560
but it doesn't matter about
like edits and shit like that.

2763
02:36:20,561 --> 02:36:21,850
I think you should have one camera,

2764
02:36:22,180 --> 02:36:26,740
one camera that's like the center of the
room above the crowd catches like the

2765
02:36:26,741 --> 02:36:30,760
first couple rows of the crowd in you
and that's it. Nothing moving around.

2766
02:36:30,970 --> 02:36:34,030
Just one clear shot of what you're doing.

2767
02:36:34,031 --> 02:36:37,810
Just like watching it in a comedy club
because I think that all is like cutting

2768
02:36:37,811 --> 02:36:41,110
it from the side and all this fancy
shit they're doing with editing.

2769
02:36:41,470 --> 02:36:42,430
It doesn't exist.

2770
02:36:42,431 --> 02:36:46,090
When you go to see a comedy show and
when you go to see a comedy show,

2771
02:36:46,390 --> 02:36:49,320
like it's the funniest thing you've ever
seen in your life as a comic onstage

2772
02:36:49,390 --> 02:36:50,650
killing in a comedy club.

2773
02:36:50,651 --> 02:36:54,160
You're in the back of the room and he
just watching and laughing and you're just

2774
02:36:54,161 --> 02:36:57,450
looking right at it. There's no
crazy angles. There's no weird cuts.

2775
02:36:57,451 --> 02:37:01,450
There's no shot to the audience laughing.
All that stuff's unnatural. Yeah.

2776
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:04,750
Yeah. Mine, I only had
like the first two rows.

2777
02:37:04,751 --> 02:37:07,420
I said go to him maybe two or three
times the whole show. That's it.

2778
02:37:07,890 --> 02:37:11,830
I wanted a dog. Yeah, they want it to,
I'm like, I don't want, I don't need that.

2779
02:37:11,860 --> 02:37:14,920
If they can hear the laughs and
you know what people at home Nell,

2780
02:37:14,950 --> 02:37:16,970
if they want to laugh or not,
I don't need a laugh truck.

2781
02:37:17,300 --> 02:37:19,880
If you'd like to light up that audience,
they light up the audience.

2782
02:37:19,881 --> 02:37:23,210
And that's weird because everybody
gets like self conscious. Yeah.

2783
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:27,320
That's always the worst. This is a weird
style that they have of doing these uh,

2784
02:37:27,350 --> 02:37:30,980
comedy specials.
They have this setup at the Irvine Improv.

2785
02:37:30,981 --> 02:37:33,260
If you'd done that place yet. The
new place. No, I haven't done that.

2786
02:37:33,260 --> 02:37:36,260
No one fucking amazing.
I was just there last weekend.

2787
02:37:36,261 --> 02:37:39,500
They have it set up for a comedy special.
So when you're in the green room,

2788
02:37:39,740 --> 02:37:42,530
if you're watching, you can watch on TV,
just the camera they have, you're like,

2789
02:37:42,531 --> 02:37:44,660
Holy Shit. That's perfect.
That's all you need.

2790
02:37:44,870 --> 02:37:48,260
Like the one camera they have that
catches the entire stage that you're on.

2791
02:37:48,680 --> 02:37:50,300
Like the camera could follow you,

2792
02:37:50,301 --> 02:37:53,000
they can move it a little bit if you go
left or right. And it's all you need.

2793
02:37:53,330 --> 02:37:57,020
It's really, it's set up perfect.
Yeah, I mean it seems like, you know,

2794
02:37:57,140 --> 02:37:59,720
the comedy specials used to cost
like a quarter million to shoot.

2795
02:37:59,750 --> 02:38:02,180
That was basically the number
you needed to raise or whatever.

2796
02:38:02,181 --> 02:38:06,830
Now you can do it for fucking 15 grand,
10 grand. And I look in, look amazing.

2797
02:38:06,831 --> 02:38:09,480
It's in the last like three or four years.
What changed?

2798
02:38:10,440 --> 02:38:13,680
Did the cameras and just, you know,
you don't have to run out the,

2799
02:38:13,710 --> 02:38:16,640
the biggest theater or somewhere,
the well turn or wherever,

2800
02:38:16,641 --> 02:38:20,060
you know where it's going to cost a ton
of money and hire a real big crow and

2801
02:38:20,061 --> 02:38:22,460
all that stuff and have seven different
cameras. I think you could do it.

2802
02:38:23,210 --> 02:38:27,020
Everything's getting cheaper and cheaper.
Yeah. Hinchcliffe did his entire show.

2803
02:38:27,180 --> 02:38:30,290
They did it with one shot.
One camera follows him into the club,

2804
02:38:30,291 --> 02:38:33,820
falls and onstage pans,
pans of him on stage.

2805
02:38:33,821 --> 02:38:35,540
Just the whole thing was
shot with one camera.

2806
02:38:35,950 --> 02:38:39,290
Do you remember when I used to go on the
road with you and I would have the two

2807
02:38:39,291 --> 02:38:42,560
cameras on the sides and one camera in
the middle and then I would just have a

2808
02:38:42,561 --> 02:38:45,800
camera that would walk around and
do zoom ins and that right there,

2809
02:38:45,860 --> 02:38:49,910
it was a whole special, a comedy
special. That's all you need really.

2810
02:38:49,970 --> 02:38:52,850
I think they over engineer those
fucking things. They really do.

2811
02:38:52,900 --> 02:38:54,890
They will have a boom mics.
I've seen people that boom,

2812
02:38:55,030 --> 02:38:57,890
they scan the entire crowd and
get up to the stage like, well,

2813
02:38:57,891 --> 02:39:01,540
what are you doing that just takes away
from what this guy's talking about?

2814
02:39:02,530 --> 02:39:02,990
Yeah.

2815
02:39:02,990 --> 02:39:07,570
Yeah. Next one I'm going to do on
a comedy club. I want to, yeah,

2816
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:12,550
a small little theater like you know,
little space maybe in New York, 200 seats,

2817
02:39:12,551 --> 02:39:14,890
something like that. Yeah.
I think that's the future.

2818
02:39:14,891 --> 02:39:19,170
Like Louis C K did his thing at the
comedy store. He did his last one, uh,

2819
02:39:19,310 --> 02:39:22,140
in the main room. That was great. That's
kind of a big room to the main rooms.

2820
02:39:22,150 --> 02:39:24,130
Kind of big because it's
got like a high ceiling.

2821
02:39:24,520 --> 02:39:27,100
That's a very unusual club
in the sense that it's,

2822
02:39:27,310 --> 02:39:31,450
it seems a lot bigger than it really
is. It's only like 300 people, right?

2823
02:39:32,680 --> 02:39:35,650
Yeah. 300, three 50 I think
if they pack it in there,

2824
02:39:36,100 --> 02:39:39,790
but it seems less intimate than a
lot of rooms that are that size.

2825
02:39:40,030 --> 02:39:43,300
Like there's a lot of comedy clubs that
have 300 people that seem like way more

2826
02:39:43,301 --> 02:39:45,940
packed in.
That's such an old school show room,

2827
02:39:45,941 --> 02:39:49,540
you know with the big giant stage and
everything. The lights. Yeah, that's a,

2828
02:39:49,541 --> 02:39:53,620
that's like as old school as
it gets that place. But yeah,

2829
02:39:53,621 --> 02:39:56,890
the those doing those, like you, you
feel like you're there, you know,

2830
02:39:56,891 --> 02:39:59,470
doing something at the store or
doing something in the ice house,

2831
02:39:59,740 --> 02:40:00,431
you feel like you're there.

2832
02:40:00,431 --> 02:40:02,810
If you're watching the guy on
stage and Madison Square Garden,

2833
02:40:02,820 --> 02:40:06,610
if you know you can enjoy
it but you don't really,

2834
02:40:06,820 --> 02:40:08,290
I don't think he ever really
feel like you're there.

2835
02:40:08,590 --> 02:40:12,160
I think Kevin Hart's going to do,
he's doing a,

2836
02:40:12,161 --> 02:40:14,250
I have financial is where the eagles

2837
02:40:14,250 --> 02:40:17,760
play a stadium. She's Christ and I think
that's going to be us next special.

2838
02:40:17,970 --> 02:40:21,540
Oh isn't he doing like sixty thousand
sixty thousand people? That's insane.

2839
02:40:22,290 --> 02:40:25,290
Well he has a crazy show though.
He doesn't do just stand up.

2840
02:40:25,500 --> 02:40:27,990
He has like explosions.
He has pyrotechnics.

2841
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:31,350
Like he hits punchlines and the
fire goes off behind him and shit.

2842
02:40:31,650 --> 02:40:34,290
He has a like a screen
that changes behind him.

2843
02:40:34,291 --> 02:40:36,840
Like he'll start talking about a place
where he was at and then they'll see the

2844
02:40:36,841 --> 02:40:40,170
screen behind him will be
of that place. Really? Yeah.

2845
02:40:40,171 --> 02:40:41,490
It's a pretty sophisticated set up.

2846
02:40:41,491 --> 02:40:45,480
Apparently he has like a
whole like group of employees.

2847
02:40:45,690 --> 02:40:49,080
They like our road team
that have to set up a stage.

2848
02:40:49,230 --> 02:40:51,120
Like that's not a small production,

2849
02:40:51,121 --> 02:40:54,120
that's a fucking major league
production when he's doing so.

2850
02:40:54,121 --> 02:40:57,780
He's like the kiss of a yeah,
for sure. Well he is definitely,

2851
02:40:57,781 --> 02:41:01,080
no one has ever sold more tickets
than that guy. No. In comedy,

2852
02:41:01,170 --> 02:41:03,420
that guy sold out the
Boston Garden two nights,

2853
02:41:03,930 --> 02:41:07,290
two shows in a Sunday night on a
Sunday night. I believe it was Sunday,

2854
02:41:07,291 --> 02:41:11,280
I'm pretty sure. But either way, two
shows in a night at the Boston Garden.

2855
02:41:11,281 --> 02:41:15,330
That's fucking crazy. That's like,
that's like 30,000 people. I mean,

2856
02:41:15,450 --> 02:41:17,250
I've never heard of anybody doing that.

2857
02:41:17,490 --> 02:41:22,490
He's probably used to be probably it
was dice and then it was Dane Cook and I

2858
02:41:23,341 --> 02:41:28,341
think Kevin Hart has eclipsed pulled of
them 60,000 people at financial field.

2859
02:41:28,830 --> 02:41:32,910
But I heard that Larry the cable guy does
numbers like that in the south that he

2860
02:41:32,911 --> 02:41:34,670
did a Josh Wolfe opened up for him.

2861
02:41:34,671 --> 02:41:38,430
It took a photo of the audience who was
at a football stadium and Josh Wolf's

2862
02:41:38,431 --> 02:41:42,810
onstage and he's taking a Selfie of
this 50,000 fucking people behind them.

2863
02:41:42,811 --> 02:41:47,580
It's nuts. He said that, uh, he'll,
he'll do like football stadiums. Yeah,

2864
02:41:47,581 --> 02:41:49,920
I could see that. Yeah.
I mean he was like, uh,

2865
02:41:50,010 --> 02:41:52,110
I guess right before Dana
and them and Dan came,

2866
02:41:52,370 --> 02:41:55,840
it kind of took the torch
from him. Bob, I mean, um,

2867
02:41:55,880 --> 02:42:00,180
and then Ross Russell as
another Russell Peters,

2868
02:42:00,330 --> 02:42:01,830
he kills it outside of the country.

2869
02:42:01,831 --> 02:42:03,590
But I don't think there's a place
in America where you could do that.

2870
02:42:03,591 --> 02:42:07,260
It's like 50,000. He's does twine like
he's done Barclay Center in Brooklyn.

2871
02:42:07,290 --> 02:42:10,460
He sold that out 20,000. He's done the
garden before but not, he can't do it.

2872
02:42:10,530 --> 02:42:13,650
I don't know if he does two or three
nights, but he's selling a lot of tickets.

2873
02:42:13,651 --> 02:42:16,530
Disease did two shows at
the garden in one night.

2874
02:42:17,010 --> 02:42:19,950
The garden is such a crazy
place for standup because
you think about the garden,

2875
02:42:19,951 --> 02:42:22,940
you think about like great heavyweight
title fights and Shit like that.

2876
02:42:22,950 --> 02:42:25,680
You know someone to be on
stage the garden telling jokes.

2877
02:42:27,030 --> 02:42:30,180
Billy Joel's got the craziest Gig.
He goes to the garden once a month,

2878
02:42:30,330 --> 02:42:33,510
once a month. That's what he does.
Drives in, probably drives a motorcycle.

2879
02:42:33,511 --> 02:42:38,460
That crazy fuck. Drive down to the garden,
gets onstage, kills it. Has All these,

2880
02:42:38,620 --> 02:42:42,120
the all the old women that your friend
flux in Florida, they all fly up for that.

2881
02:42:42,600 --> 02:42:47,340
A little late. I, they're probably
going off over themselves.

2882
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:49,070
What are you doing over there Brian?
How can we not?

2883
02:42:49,260 --> 02:42:53,460
I was trying to think of Steve Martin
didn't, he used to sell out like arenas.

2884
02:42:53,730 --> 02:42:57,360
He did big places for sure. I just,
before he quit, before he quit,

2885
02:42:57,361 --> 02:43:00,300
he did some large places,
but he had that point.

2886
02:43:00,390 --> 02:43:03,720
We've talked about this a bunch of times
on the podcast where he hit that point

2887
02:43:03,721 --> 02:43:06,240
where he didn't know what was funny
anymore because people laughed at anything

2888
02:43:06,241 --> 02:43:07,960
he did. Yeah, he was Steve Martin.

2889
02:43:07,990 --> 02:43:11,230
You get out there and they were just
so happy to see him. They Start Patton.

2890
02:43:11,231 --> 02:43:12,340
Oswald has a fucking

2891
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:16,990
hilarious bit about, remember I
told you about that casino I did,

2892
02:43:17,350 --> 02:43:19,390
north of Seattle and I got there.

2893
02:43:19,391 --> 02:43:22,060
It was like the most drunk audience
I've ever performed for it in my fucking

2894
02:43:22,061 --> 02:43:22,861
life.
I mean,

2895
02:43:22,861 --> 02:43:26,140
never had more people hackle like at a
big casino and they're spending a lot of

2896
02:43:26,141 --> 02:43:29,740
money. It was nuts. Simply
it's called tweel lip and a,

2897
02:43:29,741 --> 02:43:34,690
I was in my car to you, lip to you
lip. I was in my car just randomly.

2898
02:43:34,870 --> 02:43:35,111
Uh,

2899
02:43:35,111 --> 02:43:40,000
I have a Patton Oswald's new comedy
CD on my phone and so randomly it was

2900
02:43:40,001 --> 02:43:43,480
playing all these different things and
the thing it play, like play a song,

2901
02:43:43,481 --> 02:43:44,530
they don't play someone's bit.

2902
02:43:44,590 --> 02:43:49,590
I just put it on random and it played
Patton Oswald's bit about going to that

2903
02:43:49,750 --> 02:43:53,020
fucking very same casino.
I didn't even know he had a bid on it.

2904
02:43:53,021 --> 02:43:54,910
It's hilarious because I'm like,
this is,

2905
02:43:54,911 --> 02:43:59,210
this is the place I could relate on such
a level because I had fucking just work

2906
02:43:59,220 --> 02:44:01,930
there.
They pay a shitload of money to me.

2907
02:44:01,950 --> 02:44:05,110
It's ridiculous how much money they
pay. And even my, wow, this is crazy.

2908
02:44:05,111 --> 02:44:09,040
They didn't paint a lot of money and it's
like an hour outside of new of Seattle.

2909
02:44:09,130 --> 02:44:12,880
So you drive an hour from Seattle and
then you get there and once the show

2910
02:44:12,881 --> 02:44:15,560
starts you realize exactly why they're
paying you so much. They're like,

2911
02:44:15,640 --> 02:44:17,190
nobody wants to work here like this.

2912
02:44:17,500 --> 02:44:21,790
They have to pay you a lot of money to
get you to deal with this crowd. Maniacs,

2913
02:44:22,090 --> 02:44:24,910
the drunk, his fucking people I've ever
performed for, but there was great.

2914
02:44:24,911 --> 02:44:28,150
Just fire now. Oh yeah, a lot of
heckling. Yeah. I barely got bits out.

2915
02:44:28,151 --> 02:44:30,880
I think I made it.
I did an hour plus on stage,

2916
02:44:30,881 --> 02:44:34,600
maybe an hour and 10 a mighty
got two bits out. Maybe three,

2917
02:44:34,870 --> 02:44:39,480
maybe two who opened for Tony? Tony
opened. Yeah. How did he do? Did he did?

2918
02:44:39,481 --> 02:44:43,260
He did well, it was two one was
it Tony who was a Thompson girl?

2919
02:44:43,720 --> 02:44:47,830
I'm trying to not, I'm pretty
sure Tony. Yeah, he did
great. Tony's funny, you know,

2920
02:44:47,831 --> 02:44:51,940
he's got good jokes to Tony's. Like,
you know, he, he knows how to like,

2921
02:44:51,970 --> 02:44:55,060
well that's it's [inaudible] to
the heckler. Oh yeah. For sure.

2922
02:44:55,061 --> 02:44:57,340
If someone was hacking on,
but uh, they were good.

2923
02:44:58,070 --> 02:45:00,720
They were just really fucking hammered.
I just think that a,

2924
02:45:00,721 --> 02:45:03,070
a lot of those people that live out there,
there's not a lot to do.

2925
02:45:03,160 --> 02:45:07,720
They just get fucked. Oh yeah. I got
her to casino get messed up. Yeah.

2926
02:45:07,750 --> 02:45:11,230
That outside of Seattle area is very
different than the Seattle area.

2927
02:45:11,470 --> 02:45:14,050
Like people look at Washington
state, they go, oh yeah, Seattle,

2928
02:45:14,410 --> 02:45:18,010
well sorta go an hour outside of Seattle,
Seattle.

2929
02:45:18,011 --> 02:45:19,800
And you've got that place
where that Enim claw,

2930
02:45:19,801 --> 02:45:21,600
where they're going to get fucked
to death by the horse. Yeah.

2931
02:45:21,970 --> 02:45:25,060
Well they used to have no laws on
whether or not people can have sex with

2932
02:45:25,061 --> 02:45:25,451
animals.

2933
02:45:25,451 --> 02:45:28,930
So people flock to there and moved in
and it started farms and filmed them

2934
02:45:29,200 --> 02:45:31,840
fucking animals and having
animals. Fuck that. Like that's,

2935
02:45:32,350 --> 02:45:36,670
that's an hour outside of Seattle.
Don't get it twisted.

2936
02:45:37,450 --> 02:45:41,290
Washington state to crazy place.
It's got a lot of great spots in it,

2937
02:45:41,350 --> 02:45:42,460
but it's a crazy place.

2938
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:46,600
But the Seattle is not representative
of Mo like California. You know,

2939
02:45:46,640 --> 02:45:50,560
everybody thinks that La is like
California. Okay. Good pickers field.

2940
02:45:50,770 --> 02:45:55,540
It's not that far away. Take a drive and
take a drive. Uh, you know, up to uh,

2941
02:45:55,810 --> 02:45:59,900
some of the weird fucking spot near the
mountains off the one that first time I,

2942
02:45:59,980 --> 02:46:02,410
even when I went to Sacramento, when
I landed at the airport, I'm like,

2943
02:46:02,411 --> 02:46:05,740
what the fuck? This is California.
Exactly. Go to Fontana.

2944
02:46:05,920 --> 02:46:08,770
They used to call it [inaudible] Tuckey
when we were doing the fear factor.

2945
02:46:10,310 --> 02:46:11,370
Yeah.
The dude,

2946
02:46:11,430 --> 02:46:16,070
I know there was a place nearby where a
meth lab blew up in this guy's backyard.

2947
02:46:17,600 --> 02:46:19,970
Yeah. Go ahead and fucking
meth lab in his backyard.

2948
02:46:20,300 --> 02:46:24,340
Normal regular everyday California
community. It's a California is,

2949
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:25,940
we think of California.

2950
02:46:26,000 --> 02:46:28,940
Everybody immediately thinks of
like Beverly Hills Hollywood,

2951
02:46:29,330 --> 02:46:33,140
just traveling an hour outside
named direction. You might
as well be in Oklahoma.

2952
02:46:33,470 --> 02:46:37,970
You know, there's a lot of spots in
California that are fucked up. Wow.

2953
02:46:38,030 --> 02:46:40,910
That drive up to San Francisco where you
go through all the agricultural towns.

2954
02:46:42,540 --> 02:46:45,890
If you're a kid, your mom shit
you out. One of these towns,

2955
02:46:45,980 --> 02:46:50,390
you had to go to these local schools and
like Jesus Co rice and you know you're

2956
02:46:50,391 --> 02:46:54,290
just a two hour drive to la. If you
could just get a car, just get a car.

2957
02:46:54,291 --> 02:46:56,900
He could fucking end this nonsense.
So a moment in high school,

2958
02:46:56,901 --> 02:46:58,280
the moment you get some freedom,

2959
02:46:58,281 --> 02:47:01,410
your friend's got a fucking car
and you've got a full tank of gas.

2960
02:47:01,411 --> 02:47:03,470
So let's do what we going into the La.
Let's go to La.

2961
02:47:03,770 --> 02:47:07,340
You drive down and wish you lived here.
See how the civilized people,

2962
02:47:08,840 --> 02:47:13,400
no dirt roads wish you wish you
could be here. Said it's funky.

2963
02:47:13,401 --> 02:47:18,401
Fuck an agricultural town with right
ring Republican billboards everywhere.

2964
02:47:19,400 --> 02:47:20,191
Everywhere you go,

2965
02:47:20,191 --> 02:47:24,620
it's all these different republican
candidates for president and senator and

2966
02:47:25,280 --> 02:47:28,820
they're super right wing up there
and they're fighting over water now.

2967
02:47:29,380 --> 02:47:29,900
Okay,

2968
02:47:29,900 --> 02:47:33,230
now when you drive up there,
it's all these things about water rights.

2969
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:38,150
Like go to this website and check
out this. We need, you know, we need,

2970
02:47:38,540 --> 02:47:40,340
we need to establish our water rights.

2971
02:47:42,350 --> 02:47:43,183
It's weird.

2972
02:47:43,950 --> 02:47:46,590
Almonds apparently suck up a bunch of it.

2973
02:47:47,040 --> 02:47:47,430
Yeah.

2974
02:47:47,430 --> 02:47:50,790
Can we just stop using almonds? If
we just know almonds, a no golf,

2975
02:47:51,420 --> 02:47:55,320
how much water would you have?
Fuck load almonds,

2976
02:47:56,220 --> 02:48:00,270
almonds, apparently talk tastes old. Takes
a lot of water to make an almond. Yeah.

2977
02:48:01,810 --> 02:48:05,230
I think it still wouldn't help though.
It would only help a little. They say,

2978
02:48:05,231 --> 02:48:09,370
apparently this is the worst drought that
California has ever on record and that

2979
02:48:09,371 --> 02:48:14,290
we're four years into this fucked up
drought that they need something like 11

2980
02:48:14,290 --> 02:48:16,210
trillion gallons of
water just to break even.

2981
02:48:16,510 --> 02:48:20,180
And the unlikelihood of that happening,
pump it out of Houston.

2982
02:48:20,210 --> 02:48:23,420
They were about to get flooded
tomorrow again. Yeah. Right.

2983
02:48:23,570 --> 02:48:24,890
If they could pump oil out of Houston one,

2984
02:48:24,891 --> 02:48:28,490
can they pump water because we don't use
as much oil as we use water. That's why.

2985
02:48:28,920 --> 02:48:29,250
Yeah,

2986
02:48:29,250 --> 02:48:34,200
I answered my own question.
All right.

2987
02:48:34,201 --> 02:48:36,780
Jim Florentine, let's
uh, wrap this podcast up.

2988
02:48:36,790 --> 02:48:39,300
Anything else you want to say
to people? Oh No, that's it man.

2989
02:48:39,490 --> 02:48:42,960
I was a pleasure donor. The podcast.
It's a pleasure having you on.

2990
02:48:42,990 --> 02:48:46,770
Fella said a lot of time.
It has been a long time. Uh,

2991
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:50,260
Mr Jim Florentine on Twitter.
Jim florentine.com, right? Yeah.

2992
02:48:50,940 --> 02:48:55,650
Facebook get all that jazz. He periscope?
No, no. We'll Brian read Ben downs.

2993
02:48:56,130 --> 02:48:59,760
Brian Redman has had 10,000 people
watching him at once. That's great.

2994
02:49:00,260 --> 02:49:05,220
Since your pilot, it was life.
I, it's too much. I can't,
can't do it. Yeah, no. Yeah.

2995
02:49:06,080 --> 02:49:08,340
I don't know. Like I said,
I'll wait for six months.

2996
02:49:08,341 --> 02:49:10,500
There'll be a no one and I'll
jump on that. There will be,

2997
02:49:10,501 --> 02:49:13,560
or periscope will be undeniable.
Uh, it will be too late.

2998
02:49:13,620 --> 02:49:15,840
We'll be at the comedy
store this Wednesday night.

2999
02:49:15,841 --> 02:49:19,710
There's a new materials show at eight
o'clock. And then I'm doing that.

3000
02:49:19,740 --> 02:49:23,640
And then I'm doing the show at 10
o'clock with these two fine gentlemen.

3001
02:49:23,970 --> 02:49:28,320
And then, uh, this weekend, Friday
and Saturday, I'm at the belly room.

3002
02:49:28,321 --> 02:49:32,430
I'm in the belly room of the store with
Ian Edwards. Until then, I ride. Bye. Bye.

3003
02:49:44,550 --> 02:49:45,383
Okay.

3004
02:49:47,530 --> 02:49:47,690
Hm.
