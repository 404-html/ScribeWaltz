Hello Freak bitches.
It's societal standards and culture is a

2
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:09,930
big part of the way people decide what's
acceptable,

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:11,880
what's not acceptable.
So to these people.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,110
I think for us growing up in America,
it's almost impossible to understand

5
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:19,580
what it would be like to be living in
like one of the most radicalized parts

6
00:00:19,581 --> 00:00:21,720
of the world can understand the radical
behavior,

7
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:25,470
which is why I have no problem saying
that a guy who went and did nothing but

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,330
became radicalized,
like to me that's,

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,000
that's a mathematical equation right
there.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,070
Like it's a,
you know,

11
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,880
it's a hard one because you know,
people still say to this day and age

12
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,520
like,
you know,

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,560
you shouldn't,
you shouldn't kill,

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,880
right.
We need to.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,680
The counter insurgency strategy is based
off winning the hearts and minds of the

16
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,410
people that were going into countries
that we're going into.

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,340
And I think the only way that I can
describe it that makes sense to people

18
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,660
where that might at least allow them to
think outside of the education aspect.

19
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,930
Is that,
and you kind of,

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,050
you,
you alluded to the point a little bit,

21
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,340
but I mean you have daughters,
right?

22
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,550
Do you love your daughters?
Yeah.

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,320
Like how much though?
Like articulate for me how much you

24
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,810
love.
It's impossible for anybody to ever

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,470
express it in a way that someone who
doesn't have daughters would ever

26
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,610
understand or sons or children.
Totally and so love is a good analogy

27
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:18,120
because if you can understand how hard
it is to articulate that,

28
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,720
then you understand that there's another
side of that coin and that there's a

29
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:26,721
community of people somewhere in earth
that hates you to the exact same degree

30
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,870
that you love your children and can't
articulate and would do everything they

31
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:35,520
fucking can to end our way of life
because we let women go outside and have

32
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:38,820
their skin exposed.
You can say what you want.

33
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,820
You can think what you want and what's
the solution to solve that.

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,070
It's not books.
There's not a single.

35
00:01:47,071 --> 00:01:49,200
I could.
I could put you in captivity for 14

36
00:01:49,201 --> 00:01:50,610
years.
Joe and I could never convince you not

37
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,380
to love your daughters,
right?

38
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,510
Yeah,
but it's not our job to change,

39
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,880
but what I'm saying,
but hold on little whatever.

40
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,150
So what I'm saying is though is that
people think that there's just like,

41
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,860
oh,
you don't have to go over there and you

42
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,690
don't have to fight.
Well fuck that.

43
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,180
At some point you have to stand up for
what you believe in.

44
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:08,490
Right?
And when it comes to those people that

45
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,180
hate you as much as you love your kids,
again,

46
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,660
there's a small segment of that that you
could probably turn with books in

47
00:02:15,661 --> 00:02:16,620
captivity,
right?

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,540
Which is what's happening to the guys
who get radicalized and get mo,

49
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,830
but for the other segment that would
like nothing more than to end your life

50
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:23,790
and everything you believe in.

51
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,670
What's the solution?
It's not fucking books.

52
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,580
You know?
What is the solution to try to turn a

53
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:32,250
guy around?
Once they've reached that level of

54
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,720
radicalization,
he can't.

55
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,560
So you either have to find something or
believe in something to the point that

56
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,480
you're willing to fight for it because
here's the deal,

57
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,620
we're x people and then there's white
people and regardless of what your x is,

58
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,270
your Christian Catholic,
whatever your next person,

59
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:47,610
there's somebody as a white person,
x and y people are going to fight.

60
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,460
If you believe in what you believe
enough,

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,150
then to protect that at some point
you're going to have to go beyond the

62
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:57,270
educational aspect of that.
And then by the time the podcast art.

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,000
So what's up man?
You

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,730
know,
you learn,

65
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,640
you learn a lot about yourself,
like I'm listening to you,

66
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,890
listen to your own podcast.
I listened to the good one.

67
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,300
I don't at all.
I can't,

68
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,010
I can't stand this.
I have no desire to listen to myself.

69
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,040
The only time is when I'm going through
mastering the system,

70
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,450
my tutorial,
I do sit there and I am interested in

71
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:23,740
how I'm teaching and what I said and how
I could have made the point clear in my

72
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,010
teaching.
So I,

73
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,110
I,
uh,

74
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,400
that's the only time but when it's a
podcast and I'm not talking about you

75
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:30,700
did sit,
I'm just talking about like,

76
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:33,490
just bullshit.
I don't want to hear myself.

77
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,000
It's good to hear though.
But for the same reason like you realize

78
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,070
why you're annoying to you.
Like I've,

79
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,120
I've found things that I,
I didn't know I did like little little

80
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:45,490
ticks,
little weird things like people do like

81
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,900
a big one is saying like people,
like there's like Tom said,

82
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,270
girl,
I love them to death but that mother

83
00:03:51,271 --> 00:03:52,390
fucker out likes me.

84
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,920
He hurts me sometimes.
Like there's like a way,

85
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:00,930
like if you got like a guy like in his,
like a way like oh did he say that?

86
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:05,920
Or everybody does.
And when you guys are telling a story,

87
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,960
it's hilarious.
And he's like,

88
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,620
she came up to me and started mad
dogging me and I was like,

89
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:14,200
what the fuck you looking at?
I paid for all that shit.

90
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,680
And you didn't say none of that.
You just said I was like that.

91
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:20,290
I had that look on my right but I didn't
say shit.

92
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,620
And if you don't question,
did you actually say that you're like,

93
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,330
no,
I was not.

94
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,180
I was.
I was thinking

95
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,070
too.
You would have made it seem like a bad

96
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:33,160
motherfucker in this story.
In reality,

97
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,160
you didn't say shit.
I was like,

98
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,340
fuck you for that shit.
You said that.

99
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,820
No,
I thought it.

100
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,420
I thought it.
Fuck you.

101
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,500
And all.
And where you came from pitch.

102
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,120
Did you actually say to them?
No.

103
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,100
Oh man,
I hate that.

104
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:00,830
Another one that I.
