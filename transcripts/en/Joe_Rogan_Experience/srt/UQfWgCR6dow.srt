00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:05,480
Hello Freak bitches.
It's societal standards and culture is

2
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:06,810
a,
is a big part of this.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,920
The way people decide what's acceptable,
what's not acceptable.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,400
So to these people,
I think for us growing up in America,

5
00:00:14,401 --> 00:00:18,120
it's almost impossible to understand
what it would be like to be living in

6
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,330
like one of the most radicalized parts
of the world can understand the radical

7
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:23,460
behavior,
which is why I have no problem saying

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:26,490
that a guy who went and did nothing but
became radicalized.

9
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,610
Like to me that's,
that's a wrote mathematical equation

10
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:30,450
right there.
Like right.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,410
It's a,
it's a hard one because you know,

12
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,180
people still say to this day and age
like,

13
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:36,901
you know,
you shouldn't,

14
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:38,280
you shouldn't kill,
right.

15
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,940
We need to,
the counter insurgency strategy is based

16
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,240
off winning the hearts of minds of the
people that were going into the

17
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:46,410
countries that we're going into.

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,340
And I think the only way that I can
describe it that makes sense to people

19
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:54,660
with it might at least allow them to
think outside of the education aspect.

20
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:55,940
Is that,
and you kind of,

21
00:00:55,941 --> 00:00:58,050
you,
you alluded to the point a little bit,

22
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:59,310
but I mean you have daughters,
right?

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,560
Do you love your daughters?
Yeah.

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,320
Like how much though?
Like articulate for me how much you

25
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,960
love,
it's impossible for anybody to ever

26
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,500
express it in a way that someone who
doesn't have daughters would ever

27
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:12,480
understand or sons or children.
Totally.

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,130
And so love is a good analogy because if
you can understand how hard it is to

29
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:20,400
articulate that,
then you understand that there's another

30
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:23,430
side of that coin and that there's a
community of people somewhere on earth

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,710
that hates you to the exact same degree
that you love your children and can't

32
00:01:28,711 --> 00:01:32,820
articulate and would do everything they
fucking can to end our way of life.

33
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,260
Because we let women go outside and have
their skin exposed.

34
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,990
You can say what you want,
you can think what you want.

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,450
And what's the solution to solve that?
It's not books.

36
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,460
There's not as a single,
I could,

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,410
I could put you in captivity for 14
years,

38
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,290
Joe and I could never convince you not
to live your daughters.

39
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,030
Right?
There's,

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,220
this is not our job to change.
But what I'm saying,

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,073
hold on,
let me what happened?

42
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,080
So what I'm saying is though is that
people think that there's,

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,720
there's just like,
oh,

44
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,640
you don't have to go over there and you
don't have to fight.

45
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,400
Well fuck that.
At some point you have to stand up for

46
00:02:05,401 --> 00:02:06,480
what you believe in.
Right?

47
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,190
And when it comes to those people that
hate you as much as you love your kids,

48
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,890
again,
there's a small segment of that that you

49
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:16,260
could probably turn with books in
captivity,

50
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:16,830
right?

51
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,530
Which is what's happening to the guys
who get radicalized and get Mo.

52
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,830
But for the other segment that would
like nothing more than to end your life

53
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,600
and everything you believe in.
What's the solution?

54
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,600
It's not fucking books.
You know?

55
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:31,410
What is the solution to try to turn a
guy around once they've reached that

56
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,720
level,
radicalization he can't.

57
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,590
So you either have to find something or
believe in something to the point that

58
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,480
you're willing to fight for it.
Because here's the deal.

59
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:42,120
We're x people.
And then there's why people,

60
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,370
and regardless of what your x is,
your Christian Catholic,

61
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:46,350
whatever your next person,
there's somebody who's a white person,

62
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:49,950
x and y people are going to fight.
If you believe in what you believe

63
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:53,160
enough,
then to protect that at some point

64
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,470
you're going to have to go beyond the
educational aspect of that.

65
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,270
And then by the time it's the podcast
starts.

66
00:02:57,271 --> 00:03:00,070
So what's up man?
You

67
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,730
know,
you learn,

68
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,180
you learn a lot about yourself,
like listening to you listen to your own

69
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,890
podcast.
I you to the good ones.

70
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,300
I don't at all.
I can't,

71
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:12,010
I can't stand this.
I have no desire to listen to myself.

72
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,040
The only time is when I'm going through
mastering the system,

73
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,450
my tutorial,
I do sit there and I am interested in

74
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:23,740
how I'm teaching and what I said and how
I could have made the point clear in my

75
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:25,010
teaching.
So I,

76
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,070
I uh,
that's the only time,

77
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,010
but when it's a podcast and I'm not
talking about you did sit and I'm just

78
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:33,490
talking about like just bullshit.
I don't want to hear myself.

79
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,000
It's good to hear though.
But for the same reason like you realize

80
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:39,150
why you were annoying to you like I
have,

81
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,690
I've found things that I didn't know I
did like little s little ticks,

82
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,520
little weird things like people do like
a big one is saying like people like

83
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,890
there's like Tom Segura I loved him to
death.

84
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,740
That motherfucker out likes me.
He hurts me sometimes.

85
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,860
Like,
like there's like a way like if you got

86
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:00,310
like a guy like in his like a way like
ah,

87
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:05,460
did he say that or everybody does and
what guys are telling a story.

88
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,880
It's hilarious.
And he's like,

89
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,620
she came up to me and started mad
dogging me and I was like,

90
00:04:11,621 --> 00:04:14,200
what the fuck you looking at?
I paid for all that shit.

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,650
And you didn't say none of that.
You just said I was like that.

92
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,290
I had that look on my,
but I didn't say shit.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,110
And if you don't question did you
actually say that?

94
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,861
You're like,
no.

95
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:24,521
I was like,
I was,

96
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:28,180
I was thinking like by one of the ass
too,

97
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,520
you would have made it seem like you
were just bad motherfucker.

98
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,420
And this story [inaudible] out of you
can say shit,

99
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,080
and I was like,
fuck you for that shit.

100
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,810
He said that,
no,

101
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,620
no.
I thought it like I thought it.

102
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,960
Fuck you and you all and where you came
from,

103
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:51,640
bitch,
did you actually say to him,

104
00:04:51,641 --> 00:04:56,641
no,
man,

105
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,710
I hate that.
Another one.
