1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,670
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:06,730
You can ask anybody who goes to like
China driving over there is crazy.

3
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:10,100
They have lights but
they don't follow them.

4
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,390
They're like Christmas ornaments,

5
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:12,224
traffic lights.

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,870
They're just over there blinking
and no one's following them.

7
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,730
When you see the two red lines,

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,170
here's the crazy thing,

9
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:18,530
right?

10
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:20,720
You want to make a left
hand turn in China,

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,370
you don't make it from the left hand side.

12
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,580
You come all the way from the
right and you turn over there.

13
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,470
Why don't,

14
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,700
I don't know why.

15
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:30,520
It's two weirdest thing
I've ever seen them.

16
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:31,490
I'm one does it that way.

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,333
Yeah,

18
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:34,280
because that's how they do it over there.

19
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:34,701
Wait a minute.

20
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,031
Wait a minute.

21
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:35,380
Wait a minute.

22
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,260
They don't ever turn left from the left
lane from the right and you're over

23
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:39,501
here.

24
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:40,790
You turn way over there.

25
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,080
Can we find evidence of this online?

26
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,660
Google that I have.

27
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,430
Everything I say I know
will be instantly googled.

28
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,300
Uh,

29
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,290
but yeah man,

30
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,280
it's crazy.

31
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:50,300
Me and Steve Byrne,

32
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,310
we screamed like little girls at least 13,

33
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,120
two times on the ride home.

34
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:57,350
It is scary.

35
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,280
Here's the thing.

36
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,470
Didn't see one traffic accident,

37
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,460
not one over there.

38
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,130
And the bulk of the country
drives on the right.

39
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,671
Oh,

40
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:05,504
okay.

41
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,090
I think there's some confusion here.

42
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,541
Well,

43
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,890
I don't know what the confusion is.

44
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:10,724
I did it.

45
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,670
I think,

46
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:12,503
um,

47
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,020
some of the country in
China drives on the right,

48
00:01:15,021 --> 00:01:16,400
but some drives in the left.

49
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,670
So maybe that's where the,

50
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:17,931
the,

51
00:01:17,931 --> 00:01:18,230
the,

52
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:19,130
the issue is.

53
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,530
Does that make sense to people?

54
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:24,290
Drive on the right side and half the
people don't want he telling you,

55
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:25,124
man,

56
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:26,391
slow down dude.

57
00:01:26,391 --> 00:01:28,630
They just go right in to the,

58
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,310
they just go right in to the lane.

59
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,040
What are we watching?

60
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,820
Accidents.

61
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,240
This is Chinese trafficked.

62
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:35,640
Oh,

63
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,450
I don't want to say Chinese traffic
cause you know someone's going to get run

64
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:38,930
over.

65
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,890
There was some horrible
shit that I saw online of.

66
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:43,730
Oh Shit.

67
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,520
Oh fuck dude.

68
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,630
On a motorcycle.

69
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:48,280
They nail people.

70
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,430
But see that's what they do.

71
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,020
They just drive through.

72
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,370
Don't give a shit.

73
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,290
There's no rule.

74
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,320
This,

75
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,160
this is nuts.

76
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,210
Oh my God,

77
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:57,050
this is nuts.

78
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,861
You know what?

79
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:02,570
I hate seeing stereotypes played
out right before my fucking eyes.

80
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,090
Look.

81
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,080
But where are the Chinese Nascar drivers?

82
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,060
Oh my God.

83
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:10,100
He just nailed an old lady on her bike.

84
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,660
Oh my God.

85
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:13,450
These people are fucking crazy.

86
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:13,971
I'm telling you,

87
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:14,240
man,

88
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,630
you scream like a little girl like drive.

89
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:19,430
Look at this video.

90
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,900
This is crazy.

91
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,970
These people are in the rain with the
shitty cars and they just drive in through

92
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,850
intersections.

93
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,780
I hate saying this because
I know on it would,

94
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,440
I don't want to believe in stereotypes.

95
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,210
Oh Jesus.

96
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,021
Oh,

97
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:39,200
hit by a bike and the other guy
runs over him and then keeps going.

98
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,131
They don't care,

99
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:40,371
dude.

100
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,420
There's a billion of them all.

101
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:42,650
Oh my God.

102
00:02:42,651 --> 00:02:44,660
Look at this guy trying to make it across.

103
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,220
This is insane.

104
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:47,450
This guy cannot do this.

105
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:50,570
He must back up and rethink
and get a helicopter.

106
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:52,250
That's the only way he's
getting across that lane.

107
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,040
People are fucking nuts,

108
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:55,820
man.

109
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,540
They don't care.

110
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,530
I don't like watching this.

111
00:02:57,531 --> 00:02:59,120
This is giving me mad anxiety.

112
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,770
Can you imagine?

113
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,150
Oh Jesus Christ.

114
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,830
He's kind of motorcycle.

115
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,660
Oh,

116
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,570
he judged one and then
got nailed by another.

117
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,250
Do that all day,

118
00:03:09,251 --> 00:03:09,611
man.

119
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,740
The fact that those guys
are stopped is amazing.

120
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:12,790
It just like they,

121
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,900
we vote Jesus,

122
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,590
look at this.

123
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,850
Oh Jesus,

124
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:16,660
look at this.

125
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,830
Boom.

126
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,660
Oh my God,

127
00:03:19,661 --> 00:03:21,550
these people on Bikes are insane.

128
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,780
They're trying to cross the traffic.

129
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,351
They just say,

130
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:23,711
ready,

131
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:24,400
go.

132
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,830
Their streets must just be
like egg drop soup everywhere.

133
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,580
Just brain.

134
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,420
You know what they saying?

135
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,460
A lot of it has to do with the Chinese
culture and the way they interact with

136
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:34,000
people.

137
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,260
They mind their own business.

138
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,330
They don't look to the
left into the right.

139
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,140
They just keep,

140
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,973
keep straight.

141
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,270
And because of that,

142
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:40,880
they're,

143
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,681
they're socially,

144
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:44,180
this is explained to me
by a Chinese man that the,

145
00:03:44,181 --> 00:03:44,451
the,

146
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:44,661
the,

147
00:03:44,661 --> 00:03:45,940
the way they're socially,

148
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:46,720
um,

149
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,990
sort of a groom to interact
with people and walking.

150
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,890
Cause there's so many people,

151
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:54,940
you bump into people all the time that
they've sort of taking this and then

152
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,660
drive.

153
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,220
They drive with the same mentality.

154
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,580
They go with the exact opposite
of what you're supposed to do.

155
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:01,540
Okay.
