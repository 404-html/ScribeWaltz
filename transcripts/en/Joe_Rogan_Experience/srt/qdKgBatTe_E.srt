1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,370
Don't crash, crash as much. I
don't think that's the issue.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,830
Four, three, two,

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,380
this time we're live.
Ladies and gentlemen,

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:15,200
we are live with the great and powerful

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,140
Russell Peters. Hi. And one of the baddest
motherfuckers ever get into the ring.

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:25,020
Lennox Lewis don't mess with the best.
That's a fact that you go,

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,920
you're walking around on this earth,

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,900
one of the baddest motherfuckers of all
time verified 100% feel good about it

9
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:34,270
too. It's kind of feel good. Yeah.
Don't get into the new fights,

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,880
but you know what else? You have
your wits about you 100%. You,

11
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:42,390
you smooth and relaxed, you
know, how did you do that? Oh,

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,570
I started out that way.

13
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,870
It's like, uh, you know, uh,

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,930
apple don't fall too far from
the tree type of thing. Uh,

15
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:56,440
I've always been that way.
Uh, co collective thinker,

16
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,840
a soft spoken. And what?
You don't know about me?

17
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:05,350
Well you don't know about me when you
do know about me or love me even more.

18
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,900
Do you exercise at all
anymore? Boxing wise? Yeah.

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,700
Hit the bag and not hit the bag. I'm more
into like working out with the weights.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,260
It wasn't like it was hard for me when
I retired. That was the worst part.

21
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,530
What was the hardest?
Just you know,

22
00:01:20,531 --> 00:01:24,020
saying okay you know I'm eating
more so I need to exercise common,

23
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:27,610
not doing no exercise, but when I start
exercising I'm training for a fight.

24
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,270
Right. So it's like okay train
and train and why am I doing this?

25
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,580
I'm not going to fight but I'm
still training for a fight.

26
00:01:33,581 --> 00:01:37,240
So mentally I had to say to myself,
well let me try the soft things,

27
00:01:37,241 --> 00:01:42,241
you know and play tennis and all these
different sports which I can play and

28
00:01:42,251 --> 00:01:43,600
that kind of helped me a lot better.

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,780
Yeah. That is an interesting
thing with fighters.

30
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:50,330
A lot of times when they're done, they're
done. They just look at my data. Yeah.

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,610
Well he's apparently got training.
He's got these back in training camp.

32
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:56,850
But my Diana gum in the why,
cause he probably got an Instagram.

33
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,210
People started talking shit cause kind
of fat and that's what made me want to

34
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:04,440
lose weight. Yeah. People Talking
Shit. He were like, holy fuck.

35
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,320
Did you eat your whole cast?
You do look like he losing weight though.

36
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,500
You looked pretty slim. I Fed,
I lost 21 pounds with our, uh,

37
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,140
with our dear friend Jean Jacques
Machado who, Hey Jiu Jitsu,

38
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:14,860
we'll peel that weight
off. Yeah. That's a fact.

39
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,210
That's some strenuous shit you ever
thought about doing Jujitsu legs.

40
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,330
He's scared of me. He won't do
it. Whoa. Let me, let me tell you,

41
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,800
when I was growing up,
I had that,

42
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,930
I had friends that did wrestling,

43
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,980
I had friends that did kickbox
and all these different, um, uh,

44
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,050
mediums and um, you know, we would always
practice with them where this wrestling,

45
00:02:35,051 --> 00:02:40,030
whether it's a kick in, whether it's,
um, doing whatever play, fighting,

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,440
you did all that stuff.
Yeah.

47
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,310
Because everybody always wants to
test a boxer and say, well, you know,

48
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,160
how does he fit up against the karate guy?
How's,

49
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,150
if you're up against that a kickbox
how's he fear up against a MMA guy?

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,750
Yeah.
They always fair financially better.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,250
So, uh, you for, for me,

52
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,820
I didn't really throw my weight
around like that. You know, it's like,

53
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,300
don't mess with me. Okay. If you mess
with me, something's going to happen.

54
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,850
And then they don't really mess with them.

55
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:13,770
I kind of carry myself like that yet
cause I'm so serious at sometimes like you

56
00:03:13,771 --> 00:03:16,120
know, they can take the
consents, the seriousness of it

57
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,750
series, but still easy going.
So no reason to push you. Right.

58
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,650
I'm s I'm silent but
violent. Ooh, I liked that.

59
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,230
Silent.
Silent or violent.

60
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:31,840
It is an interesting deal about
about fighters is that your,

61
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,600
when you think of exercise,

62
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:37,600
you think of exercise as you're
preparing for a big violent event.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
Whereas for most people, they just don't
want to be fat. They want to look good,

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,690
they want to get in shape.
And you know,

65
00:03:43,691 --> 00:03:47,110
it's a lot of people on Instagram that
just working out really hard every day.

66
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:52,060
But there's no reason. Right.
You had a reason. Yes. Yeah.
So when the reason's gone,

67
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,320
it's like, hmm, now what?

68
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:57,880
How do I maintain this shameless and
without maintaining that lifestyle.

69
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,080
You think of another reason.
Yeah.

70
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,770
Oh, like you, you know,
you look good by the way.

71
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,580
Thanks. Does or could makes seen
me since I was 147 pounds. Really?

72
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,440
You were 147 pounds at one point.
I was kind. I first started boxing.

73
00:04:12,441 --> 00:04:15,410
I was one 47 how old
were you? 15 oh, okay.

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,350
I met him probably when
I was 16 Oh really? Yeah.

75
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:22,580
You guys have known each other that long.
Yeah, I know his parents. Yeah. Wow.

76
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,840
And his and his mom and his
brothers. Every, wow. It
goes back, we're deep creek.

77
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,560
You don't realize that. It was like,
you know, I see him as a big star now.

78
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:35,430
I seen the movies and commercials
rescuing people, you know what I mean?

79
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,450
I'm like, Yo, this is the kid, you know,
he's grown up. He's like literallyZ ,

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,690
literally just selling mix tapes in the
90s he was already world champ and I'd

81
00:04:44,691 --> 00:04:49,220
be playing a mix tape. Yo Send me that
and I'm like, I just made it. He was like,

82
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,580
I'll give you 20 bucks. I'm
like, you just made $100 million.

83
00:04:52,581 --> 00:04:56,690
Can you give me 100 bucks?
Yeah. Well, you know,

84
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:58,190
everybody was making tapes back then.

85
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,870
Those days when people are aggressively
trying to sell tapes on the streets.

86
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,810
I wasn't even trying to sell it. I was
just playing it in my car and he was like,

87
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,400
yeah. So he got, he had the new shit

88
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,210
going on, you know, that
was, you had the real shit.

89
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:13,030
So I had to get a go get it.
I didn't,

90
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,130
I didn't have that contact to get the
music, so he had the music contacts. Okay.

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,710
A lot of people don't know Russell's a
legit Dj. I reluctantly gave me mix tapes.

92
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,060
Reluctantly. Yeah, it's a
good move. Um, when you know,

93
00:05:26,061 --> 00:05:28,960
when you see him wrestling with
people on Tmz, you see that shit

94
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,600
wrestling with the jewel thief.

95
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,230
Always trying to see what happened
after he didn't throw no punches. Go on.

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,810
Good kid. His neck, if
you watch it, you see,

97
00:05:39,811 --> 00:05:43,920
I went for his arm to pull down to get
his neck and then the other guy in front

98
00:05:43,921 --> 00:05:45,840
of him pulled him down and
I couldn't get the neck.

99
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,510
Could you tell us what happened?
I mean, explain what happened.

100
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:52,360
All I seen was a guy walking out and you
grab them. No, if you're watching it,

101
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,280
okay, let me tell you what happens. I'm
there looking at a ring, right? Yeah.

102
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,270
And that guy sitting down earlier had
checked to see if the door was open.

103
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,990
He went out to spit and now he really,
he thinks the door's open,

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
so now he thinks he's just going to
get up and walk away with this ring.

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,980
This is where he makes his little move
and then they lock the doors and then I'm

106
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:18,740
standing there, I'm like,
what's going on? And I'm like,

107
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,750
he takes a swing at my friend's
father and then I go, no, no.

108
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:22,370
I tried to get his neck
and that guy pulls him.

109
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:25,880
You see there's a lot of opportunities
yet the neck there. So no, but I'm trying,

110
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:28,520
he's a big strong fucking guy too.
You got to go over the top.

111
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:32,150
I will look Tom just trying. But I
had three layers on. Got a jacket,

112
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:35,210
a sweatshirt and a long sleeve shirt on.
There is an issue and then a,

113
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,940
so then I try to go for the arm.
But everybody sees everybody's in my way.

114
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:41,190
So I'm like, give me the arm. Just let
me get the eye move, Dad, move dad, mate.

115
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,930
That's uncle David. And there I get,
I get the arm, the backward base.

116
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,780
Now I'm pushing the arm down and
you'll see I locked the wrist here.

117
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:55,190
As soon as I locked the army
says, he says, okay, I want
you to stop some living.

118
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,590
Right. There it goes.
Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah,

119
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,790
I got the rest of the [inaudible]
Steven Seagal style. That was my friend.

120
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:07,790
Senpai shall look. Oh, there you go. Relax
or legit. He got up again. No, no, no.

121
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:09,320
This is just a different angle.
Different.

122
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:13,200
I want to know how far we was going
to make with a ring. You see, um,

123
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,990
see that wall where my cousin is hiding,

124
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,170
when he was trying to get out, he whacked
his head against that wall. Oh No.

125
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,460
And uh, and he could see her
open. Th th th the thief. Yeah.

126
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:30,440
So whatever happened to
him, he got arrested. I was
carrying, was this in Toronto?

127
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,380
No, in New York City. No Shit.
Right in the jewelry district. Wow.

128
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:39,860
So it's funny.
That's like ill planned out move.

129
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,650
Yeah. They know that people
grab things and run away.

130
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,110
Well there's that and he apparently this
guy had been coming to the store for

131
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:48,480
six months scoping, scoping the
place out. Oh that's hilarious.

132
00:07:48,481 --> 00:07:52,580
Scoped it up poorly. That's
hilarious. Yeah. Just silly.

133
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Do you have to go to court or anything?
I don't know.

134
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:57,220
I haven't heard anything since
and I just put them in the,

135
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:59,960
I all I was trying to do is hold them
there because all the doors were locked.

136
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,900
I'm like, it doesn't make sense
again to a scrap, but the guy,

137
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:06,320
if I could just put him in a choke hold
or, or a lock then till the cops come.

138
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:09,890
But the thing is like you could injure
him. If you enjoy him then they suit you.

139
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,270
Well yeah, not really. As ridiculous
as it sounds. It's rough work.

140
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,930
Well Russell is not really
a law enforcement officer.
I could see if you had,

141
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:20,330
nobody would have been
dangerous, everybody in the
store if he was running wild.

142
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:24,170
True. Yeah. So I mean look, he's lucky
he didn't crack them. Yeah. You know,

143
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:27,260
I just locked him up and I
said, all right, as soon as
I locked up because, okay.

144
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,570
I'm like, okay, good.
And then he had one knee,

145
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:33,770
one knee down and one leg up and
I kick that leg out so he would,

146
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,860
we'd be bombed both knees. Get
rid of his base. Yes. Right.

147
00:08:36,861 --> 00:08:39,740
I was trying to move Wizbang Bang.
Who's the bitch? Got a question. Okay.

148
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:42,650
Now if the whole thing happened again,
how would you do things different?

149
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,950
I would have told everybody get out of
my way so I can get him in a choke and,

150
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:50,240
Huh. Okay. Would you just
put him to sleep? Yeah. Just
put them asleep. Lamb down.

151
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,110
Yeah.
Lay him down,

152
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:54,650
talk him in and he went back home and
obviously feel good about yourself.

153
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,250
Did you kind of run the whole
thing through your mind a
couple of times? Like Yo,

154
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,390
this could have happened or what could
happen after if he had a gun or if he had

155
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:10,650
a knife, but I'm like, if he had a gun, he
would have pulled it out right away. Wow.

156
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,650
Yeah. You know, he's not here
to surprise you with a gun.

157
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,180
He's here to scare you with the gun.
Well,

158
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,340
if there's all that many dudes on them
too, good luck pulling that gun out. Yeah.

159
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,070
Yeah. One of us would've got shot, but,

160
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:23,120
but probably not food or
something that if you,

161
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,340
you probably got real urgent if you
saw him reaching for something. Yeah,

162
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,670
it would have changed. I think needs to,
the head would have kicked everything.

163
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:30,990
Everything.
I know.

164
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:34,320
I watch while the coronial different
things you could do like a little loop.

165
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:38,160
We want to practice karate.
You ever want to do something different?

166
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,340
That's why I was asking you about
your Jitsu because you know,

167
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,410
when you're a world heavyweight
champion boxer after, why?

168
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,440
Like what other shit can I learn?
I kept arm locking her in England.

169
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,270
I kept hugging him, putting
them in like, um, you know,

170
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,040
great Bruce Lee Fan.

171
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,530
I love fighting movies and uh,
you know,

172
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,090
martial arts is always
been a part of my life.

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,890
And I say that because every fight
I fought before I fought that fight,

174
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,540
I watched the martial arts
movie. Really? What, uh,

175
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:14,660
Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee, that
kind of shit, leave venom.
All the real shit. Yeah.

176
00:10:14,661 --> 00:10:19,430
So those kind of movies, Carter
Wong and type stuff, you know? Yeah.

177
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:23,910
I like that. And that just got me in
that mental state. Like, you know,

178
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:27,360
you watch him I today. Yeah. Do
you, do you ever watch it and go,

179
00:10:27,361 --> 00:10:30,930
if this was around when I was
fighting, would I do this? Um,

180
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,860
the only thing I think about that
because, you know, like I said,

181
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,840
I was in the wrestling and I did wrestling
when I was younger and boxing as well,

182
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:44,100
so I didn't know they could combine them
too. So like got older, but you know,

183
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:47,760
my focus was more on
boxing. Uh, but you know,

184
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:51,210
if they got paid a lot of money I probably
would have done it, you know? Yeah.

185
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:53,790
That's how a lot of people feel,
I think. I think like right now,

186
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:56,490
the money's not quite there.
It's not quite,

187
00:10:56,491 --> 00:10:59,610
it's for some people that Conor
McGregor or Ronda Rousey and,

188
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,920
but for the other folks,
it's not,

189
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,020
it's not enough to get a guy like Earl
spends to jump over there, you know? No.

190
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,320
And then I see a lot of,

191
00:11:07,321 --> 00:11:11,070
I've seen some boxers actually good at
boxing actually just win the fight on

192
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:15,570
boxing because they're so good with
their hands and your stance has to be

193
00:11:15,571 --> 00:11:19,050
different. You can't have your lead
leg out in MMA. That's the problem.

194
00:11:19,051 --> 00:11:22,170
You can't stand the sideways. Yeah,
you gotta you got just square up,

195
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,310
your leg will get lit up.
I Dunno.

196
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,930
I stand sideways even in the fight
because I know that I stick that leg out

197
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:31,260
there for them to come, come
at and obviously, you know,

198
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:34,740
it's easy to grab a leg,
but to me,

199
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:37,290
I don't think fighting should
start that way anyway. Nobody,

200
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,580
when you start fighting,

201
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,120
usually punches are thrown quick
and it lasts a couple seconds.

202
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:45,090
Nobody really just goes straight
legs unless they say, okay,

203
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,390
I'm going to go for his legs and take
him down. Nobody in there kick your leg.

204
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,510
Yeah, they kill you. Can't walk
the kid leg kicks are brutal.

205
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,980
You have been like kicked.
Yeah. Yeah. It's rough.

206
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,190
A guy on the leg one time and I was like,
I couldn't move.

207
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,110
And I'm like still thinking
if we got in a fight,

208
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,600
kicked him in the leg and they
gave me a dead look like this.

209
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,530
I don't know what I would do. So,
and if it's a guy like your size,

210
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:09,490
like a Rico Verhoeven, like whose glory
world? Heavyweight kickboxing champion,

211
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,010
they just keep their hands up and chew
your legs up mean one or two shots of

212
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,810
your legs. And it's a horrible
feeling. It's like doesn't move. Right?

213
00:12:16,811 --> 00:12:21,040
It's like it just gives out. I write
on the side of your knee. Oh, well.

214
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,070
Oh well, you know what?
You know he used to,

215
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,870
did you guys look like you've accepted
that? I's like I go mad. Yeah.

216
00:12:28,871 --> 00:12:31,810
Someone kicks me in Mulligan
like, Yo, you kicked me in my leg.

217
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,400
I don't think anybody's kicking
you and your leg. And even,

218
00:12:33,401 --> 00:12:37,060
did you ever see when Shannon and,
and try it out some kickboxing? No.

219
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,100
Shanna breaks fought. Uh, Tom
Erickson. Oh goes, no, no.

220
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:45,940
He fucked him up. Shannon got leg
kicked out and he said he, he, you know,

221
00:12:45,941 --> 00:12:49,330
Chan and talks. He's hilarious. He
goes, champ, he goes, it hurts so bad.

222
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,680
But I tried to play it off champ.
He got hit with one leg kick,

223
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,920
then you got to hit with
another one. But he, he,

224
00:12:56,010 --> 00:13:00,190
he touched him with like a jab to the
body and Tom Erickson got a little cocky.

225
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,320
Here it is right here. He, uh, he,

226
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,460
he fought when he was in
like this transitionary
period and they offered him a

227
00:13:06,461 --> 00:13:09,130
lot of money. Like right there. He got
leg kicked by this guy and the guy,

228
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:11,650
Tom Erickson that he fought
is really more of a wrestler.

229
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,690
He kicked him twice and then Shannon t he,

230
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,530
he actually broke it down
for us on the podcast,

231
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,220
but he said his leg was hurting so
bad and he tried to go the guide into

232
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,160
thinking that he could punch with them.
See, they got hit again and he's like,

233
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:28,420
oh Jesus, he's letting him hit. I
would knock that guy out. Yeah. But he,

234
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,480
you think you would just let them do that.

235
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:33,550
But once you get hit with one
of those things like that,

236
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:37,120
it's so crippling to your leg. You
don't move around. You're right.

237
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,110
Cause like I said, you know, I got hit
there and I was like, oh my liquid move.

238
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:44,830
The thing is that you marry him just
locked up. Huh? You put Shannon to sleep.

239
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,570
It was a great fight to Erickson tried
to box with it for some strange reason.

240
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,170
He got into this crazy idea at like right
there, boom. Clipped good night. Yeah.

241
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:58,720
And that's it. He's got the
one shell champ. Chill boxing,

242
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:03,170
kickboxing, because they're wearing
gloves when no shoes, no shoes aren't,

243
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,443
aren't you suppose?

244
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,800
Isn't Shannon Briggs supposed to at least
kick a couple of times? Well, you know,

245
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:11,950
if he knew how to, but I think he
went into their thinking, you know,

246
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:14,930
I'll just crack them with a punch and
knock him out. Which he did. You know, he,

247
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:18,820
he ate a couple of leg kicks, but it's
hilarious when you hear him break it down.

248
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,610
He's, how old are you now? Owe me. Yeah,

249
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm under a hundred under a hundred or
under a hundred but you can't be any more

250
00:14:25,721 --> 00:14:30,160
than like, what are you? 45
47 hold. Thank you very much.

251
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:35,080
Thank you very much. Are you older than
that? 51 want to say you're a great guy.

252
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,170
You're a great, you don't want to
say people have internet out there,

253
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:42,460
so they'll just look. How old is
he? 53 you look great. Thank you.

254
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,140
You do right, doesn't he? He's always look
good. But when you were like, you were,

255
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,040
you're one of those guys
who did the smart, you were
tired and you just retired.

256
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,660
Yes. You know, which
is, I respect so much.

257
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,820
We were just talking about
Marvin Hagler the other day.

258
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,260
[inaudible] when Marvin Hagler retired,
he's like, goodnight. Take care of buddy.

259
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,150
Lost a controversial decision to
sugar ray Leonard. He said, hey,

260
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,430
I'm going to go do some movies. And
that was it. He just never came back.

261
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:10,820
It's so rare that a fight or
does that well, you know what?

262
00:15:10,821 --> 00:15:13,910
Marvin was disheartened
like a motherfucker for
boxing though. He hated it.

263
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:14,744
He was like,
I'm out.

264
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,220
Yeah, yeah. Um, you know,

265
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,260
w boxes go through so much and uh,
it's like when they know,

266
00:15:22,261 --> 00:15:24,840
when it's time,
when a box that says it's time to quit,

267
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,590
they know it's time because they've gone
through so much and they realize that

268
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:31,950
it's a lot of hard work for me.
I've been boxing since I've been 15,

269
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,560
so you know, in training,
hundreds of hours training,

270
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,080
hundreds of hours working out Restin uh,

271
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,990
working on a technique, sparring, all
these different things. After a while,

272
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,660
you know, you have to read, you reached
that height where you say, okay,

273
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:52,590
that's enough. And
sometimes you know, people,

274
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,230
managers and trainers and promoters,

275
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,870
they don't want to tell the box if that's
enough because that's how much they're

276
00:15:57,871 --> 00:16:02,210
making money off of that box every time
you stepped in the ring. Right. So, um,

277
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,930
did you have a conversation with
Emmanuel Stewart about it? Absolutely.

278
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,720
And who made the decision?
Did you guys make it together?

279
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,170
Uh, I made the decision he wanted
me actually to go on. Really? Yeah.

280
00:16:12,171 --> 00:16:17,030
Cause I want it to, Tyson was my
main nemesis. And, um, you know,

281
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,010
he's a, he's a boxer that I definitely
wanted to fight before retiring.

282
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:24,650
And A, I didn't know if it
was going to happen or not.

283
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,080
So I actually stuck around for a couple
more years for that fight to happen

284
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,410
because I didn't want,
throughout history people will be saying,

285
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,360
oh Tyson with the one or Lewis was the
one I wanted them to know who write one.

286
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:43,340
Right. And then after that, after the
Tyson fight, you know, Manny said, listen,

287
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,980
Chris goes around,
that's the new generation.

288
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:50,600
You can beat the guys from this generation
and the guys from the next generation.

289
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,860
I'm like, yeah, that sounds good.

290
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,400
So he kinda talked me into doing that
fight cause I wasn't really going to go do

291
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,920
that fight. And then, um, you know,

292
00:16:57,921 --> 00:17:02,720
that was a year after Tyson and I didn't
really want to box him straight away.

293
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:07,520
I want it to bug somebody else because
the main nemesis was Tyson. And you know,

294
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:10,970
once I, once I beat Tyson, you
know, I could relax a little bit,

295
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:15,990
a relaxed for a year and then getting
back into boxing I box Klitschko was my

296
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:17,810
first fund,
which was a mistake.

297
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Took the fight 1717 days notice at
my worst I beat him at his best.

298
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,910
Why was it such a short notice fight?

299
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,850
Because the opponent that I actually
picked to fight didn't fuck,

300
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,920
didn't want to fight me.
He actually said no,

301
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,330
it was supposed to be a Johnson
from, oh yeah, Kurt Johnson,

302
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,960
Johnson, Nova Scotia from Nova
school. You were doing him a favor.

303
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,600
I think politico felt that he was
doing him a favor. Listen, take.

304
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:51,540
Let me take the fight. I've been trained
in for two years for this guy. I'm ready.

305
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,850
And then we'll give you
the first shot after I win.

306
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,290
That's what was promised to him. Battalion
has such a weird style, didn't he? Yeah,

307
00:17:58,291 --> 00:17:58,801
he did.

308
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:02,250
And that's that kickboxing style coming
into play a little bit because he would

309
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,350
throw a punch and lean back like this.

310
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,750
And that's the first time I've
actually seen that style. And you know,

311
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,670
if I didn't reach out with my
right hand as far as I did,

312
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:16,671
I would never have caught him with that
cut and it was that long right hand that

313
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:21,480
cotton just at the end of my punch when
he leaned back and he couldn't lean back

314
00:18:21,481 --> 00:18:25,140
anymore. That made is I cut. Yeah.

315
00:18:25,141 --> 00:18:28,290
He was a very strange fighter
in terms of his style,

316
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:32,100
just the way her hands were always
down is a very weird way of moving.

317
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,220
Very Unorthodox because he was such a
big guy. He was six foot seven. Yeah,

318
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,480
there was. It was probably the
biggest guy you fought, right? Yeah.

319
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,360
Could you take it? Have you ever shot,
you're never far guns I listed yet.

320
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,390
Michael Grant was big guns. All of
this I I boxed in the limb. Okay.

321
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:49,430
Luis Gonzales that was named, right? Yeah.
Cuban guy. Yup. They are looking at like,

322
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:53,850
look how weird the way he fights is
just such an awkward way of moving.

323
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,020
He hit me good with a
right hand and I held on,

324
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:58,680
I see me holding him around the neck.
That from Mohammed Ali.

325
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,400
He said if you hold a
gun Chi around the neck,

326
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:07,100
you can tell when he's going
to move. Mm. Wow. Well he was,

327
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,210
he was good in the,

328
00:19:08,211 --> 00:19:12,890
in the first few rounds
after the first three rounds,

329
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:19,480
what people don't realize about this
fight. I wasn't fighting for, uh,

330
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,160
for 12 rounds.
I was fighting to knock this guy out.

331
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:23,680
Okay,

332
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,350
because you had it in your mind.
Yeah.

333
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,540
Like this is the first time you ever
see me going forward in the fight.

334
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:33,220
This guy's bigger than me. I'm coming
forward and I'm throwing punches.

335
00:19:33,221 --> 00:19:36,250
He's catching me.
But those were the early rounds.

336
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,100
Although he's two inches taller than you,
you look bigger than him.

337
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,860
He just like fellas ugly. Physically,
you're wider, you know, when,

338
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,220
when you look back on your career,

339
00:19:45,221 --> 00:19:49,230
like do you have like a most satisfying
victory? Yeah. What is it? Ah,

340
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,010
seem Rockman I was going to say that.

341
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,750
I was going to say the rematch the first
or the second. The second one is Christ.

342
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,640
When a guy, when a guy beats
you like that and then you know,

343
00:20:00,641 --> 00:20:02,890
you could have beaten him or
you should have beaten them.

344
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,330
Is that what bothered you
so much? Um, no, you know,

345
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,940
it really bothered me is the fact
that I gave them an opportunity.

346
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,900
I gave him a fight when,
uh,

347
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,460
I'm basically waiting for
Tyson and I have to keep busy.

348
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,360
I'm looking down the list of who to fight.
He's number seven.

349
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,550
I realized that he's durable is nothing,

350
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:25,630
not one of these guys that got knocked
out easy. So I wanted to give my fans,

351
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,340
you know,
a proper fight box,

352
00:20:27,341 --> 00:20:30,760
the best guy out there and not bucks an
easy guy that's easy to get knocked out.

353
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:33,460
I don't want to go home in two rounds.
So,

354
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:35,620
and then another reason a
lot of people don't know,

355
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:38,590
I went to Africa to fight because
Muhammad Ali went to Africa,

356
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:41,920
he fought in Africa. So I wanted
to do that. I want us to be,

357
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,520
I wanted to fight in Africa.
If I say I'm a world champion,

358
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,170
so I need to find all the world.
So that's what made me go to Africa.

359
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,280
The only thing about Africa is I didn't
know that it was such a high altitude up

360
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:57,820
there and for me to have a fight,

361
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,750
I should have got there a lot earlier,
but I was doing ocean's 11 at that time.

362
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,750
And you say you were doing the movie?
I wasn't doing the movie.

363
00:21:04,751 --> 00:21:08,170
I was sitting around half the time
waiting for them to change the lights,

364
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:11,890
then go out and go up there for two
minutes and then go back and sit there for

365
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:13,630
another two hours while
they changed the light.

366
00:21:13,631 --> 00:21:16,360
So we training at all when that was
happening. Yeah, I was training,

367
00:21:16,361 --> 00:21:20,830
but it wasn't like it wasn't
the conditions of training.
You know, I needed a bag,

368
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:25,180
I needed sparring partners
and we up there a lot sooner.

369
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,600
So you're just kind of traumatize.
Yes. How many thousand feet?

370
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:33,350
Was It above sea level? Higher than
a big beer? It was Cape Town. Right,

371
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,330
so more than six. Wow. I
didn't know that. Yeah,

372
00:21:37,331 --> 00:21:40,450
it was kind of weird because when I
started working out I was like throwing

373
00:21:40,451 --> 00:21:42,460
punches.
Then I found myself going,

374
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,890
so I had to take two steps
back and I'm like, oh no, no,

375
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,540
don't tell me this fight is going to be
one of those fights where I have to take

376
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:54,230
my time. So I basically went out
there taking my time. I realized he's,

377
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,960
he's dealing with the same
thing I'm dealing with,

378
00:21:55,990 --> 00:22:00,670
although he was there a lot earlier,
but you know,

379
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:04,510
I had a couple of things going wrong
boxing at four in the morning. Uh,

380
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,360
they couldn't find a big enough ring.
Then they,

381
00:22:07,361 --> 00:22:12,361
when they put the ring together it
was like a 18 by 19 so and then the,

382
00:22:14,441 --> 00:22:18,940
the punch that actually hit me, I
actually thought I was going to block it,

383
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:22,570
but it came around this side.
I'll put my hand,

384
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,390
I put my hand up to block it,
but it came around and hit me.

385
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,040
One of those things where a man through
a terrific punch with my chin happened

386
00:22:30,041 --> 00:22:30,874
to be in the way of,

387
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,460
what is it like when that's
over and you're sitting
there and you know you lost,

388
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,680
but you know that under the
right circumstances this
guy is not at your level.

389
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:47,020
Uh, in fact, you know, my problem was
solved before I got out of the ring.

390
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,390
I knew what I did wrong, which was the
greatest thing that ever happened to me.

391
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:55,300
He's like, Oh, another day he wouldn't
throw a lucky punch like that.

392
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,340
It wouldn't hit me and he wouldn't
have a ref that, you know,

393
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,960
was on his side as well. How
was it rough on her side? Um,

394
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:05,900
when I say the refs on his side,
you know, I got it a little early.

395
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,870
I got knocked down in the second round.
I'm the, I'm the champion. Right.

396
00:23:10,871 --> 00:23:14,590
At least giving me a chance, not waive the
fight straight. Right, right. You know,

397
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:19,550
you've seen, you've seen the Deontae,
a Tyson fight. Like, you know,

398
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:22,690
if that was the ref,
he counted them out straight away.

399
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:26,440
That's what it stopped it at
the press conference 12th round.

400
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:30,940
That right left Deontae landed the
fact that Tyson got up and then one the

401
00:23:30,941 --> 00:23:33,500
remainder of the round.
That is crazy. Yeah.

402
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:38,080
I am so frustrated that fights not
happening again, man. Every, you know,

403
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,430
I'm looking at the heavyweight
scene and, um, I'm looking at,

404
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:47,431
obviously I'm Joshua Joshua
from England and you know,

405
00:23:47,711 --> 00:23:50,750
he had the opportunity to fight the
Auntie and didn't take it. I'm like,

406
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,801
if that was me,

407
00:23:51,801 --> 00:23:54,770
I would've took that chance because you
never know what happens down the road.

408
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,530
Likes what's happening
now. And um, you know,

409
00:23:57,531 --> 00:23:59,490
to me it's being put on the shelf now.

410
00:23:59,491 --> 00:24:02,090
We asked to box somebody that
nobody really wants him to box.

411
00:24:02,091 --> 00:24:06,990
Who's he fighting next? A baby.
A baby. Middle, a big baby.
Miller, big baby, you know,

412
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:11,570
big baby millet. I haven't seen too much
of him. I don't know too much about him,

413
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:15,620
but you know, he's talks a good
fight. I knew, I know he weighed,

414
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,310
weighed over 300 pounds at one
time and, and yeah. And uh,

415
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,690
you know, now he's got an
opportunity to fight the Joshua,

416
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:28,370
so he's taken full advantage of
it. Like he should. But you know,

417
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,980
I don't see anything in his history
to show me that he can beat Joshua,

418
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:38,860
move you beacon. He can, he can bag now
he can bang. If you're there to Bang Josh.

419
00:24:38,861 --> 00:24:41,600
Joshua has got feed, he's going to move.
He's not going to stay there and bang.

420
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,810
Yeah, he's going to be a smart boxer
in this fight, allegedly. We'll see.

421
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,970
Right. I mean, you never
know. Yeah. I mean this,

422
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,230
this isn't one of those things where
I think this is where Anthony gotta be

423
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:58,231
extra careful because Miller going to
try and twice as hard and if Joshua

424
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:00,430
doesn't train,
like he's fighting Deontae right.

425
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:03,060
He's gonna he may take it for granted,
make a mistake

426
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:06,350
and you can do that. I've done that.
I've done that. And it's nothing.

427
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,070
It's nothing that he's done on purpose.
It's not, it's like it's a mental thing.

428
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:13,190
Yeah. It's a mental thing. Like when
you were fighting my Ravitch. Yeah.

429
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,550
That guy wouldn't go home.
We wouldn't go home, go home.

430
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,180
He gave me a lot of trouble. I was at
that fight, gave me a lot of trouble.

431
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:21,750
Um,

432
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,670
Lennox box,
this guy around the ring for 12 rounds,

433
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:27,360
like literally the guys heads snapping
back and this guy's not going.

434
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,480
He was going nowhere. That
is, that's gotta be a weird

435
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,580
feeling too. When you know how hard you
punch and you see a guy just eating them.

436
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:40,170
Like some people just are built
weird. They just can take a shot. No,

437
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,330
I learned that coming up.
I learned that like, Yo,

438
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:45,870
some guys that are tough to the
head or week to the body, uh,

439
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,800
some guys are tough to the body week to
the head and some guys are just made out

440
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:51,000
of rocks.
Yeah.

441
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,920
Yeah.
It's almost like a ignorant bliss.

442
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,450
It just don't know they're
supposed to feel bad.

443
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,550
I don't know. I mean, I really
think it's a physiological thing.

444
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,210
I think some guys can just take a shot.
Uh, they just, they just built better.

445
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,280
Sometimes.
I've been in fights where I've gone in,

446
00:26:06,281 --> 00:26:11,281
the man's hit me on the Chin first couple
minutes and it's like he just glanced

447
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:12,121
off my chin.

448
00:26:12,121 --> 00:26:16,020
I was like an eight har ain't gonna
Punch up and it didn't hurt me and it was

449
00:26:16,021 --> 00:26:18,960
like, what happened to a punch? It
was so hard. It hit you on the chin.

450
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,050
Everybody was saying, Yo, did you see that
punch? He never felt him. I'm like, no.

451
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:25,720
And when I look at tape of it,
it's like, wow, I did get it. Hmm.

452
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,690
Is it because like are there a bunch
of factors like how much you got hit in

453
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:35,590
training, how well you feel coming into
the fight where you're at in your career.

454
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,010
And there's a lot of factors. Like
for instance, let me give you a good,

455
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:38,671
we could factor,

456
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:43,671
if you have a box for two years and all
of a sudden you step into the ring and

457
00:26:43,711 --> 00:26:45,270
it's a title fight and you box,

458
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:49,700
you got the first good hit you get is
going to concuss you really because you,

459
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:52,320
you haven't been getting those
hits for that last two years.

460
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:56,730
Now this man hit you
with a two years, uh, um,

461
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,400
and you're getting used
to it and you have,

462
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:02,610
you felt it and you've gotten over it.
You need to get over that hill.

463
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,360
Is it a mental hill? It is a mental
health because even for me, for me,

464
00:27:06,361 --> 00:27:10,710
when I haven't fought for awhile, you
know, I call out there until I get hit.

465
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,400
Once I get hit that wakes
everything. I'm just like, Yo,

466
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,550
this is not supposed to go like that.
You're not supposed to hit me.

467
00:27:17,551 --> 00:27:20,310
I'm supposed to hit you.
So I get, I get going.

468
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,580
So the hot steam Rockmont
fight after it was over,

469
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:27,160
were you worried that you were going to
get, we're not going to get a rematch?

470
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:32,120
Yes, I was very worried. In
fact, we chased them two,

471
00:27:32,121 --> 00:27:36,730
three courts around the world and the,
he didn't want to fight me. And I,

472
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,220
you know, if I was in this
position, I wouldn't want to
fight me that because, uh,

473
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:43,910
you know, I'm coming back for revenge.
Plus there's a big money fight out.

474
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:48,740
They would Tyson brunch. He, so, um,
so happened to say after the fight,

475
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:50,450
no more Louis Tyson,

476
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:54,100
no more Louis Tyson and
he actually left um,

477
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,180
South Africa without visiting Mandela.
Like why you go African of a Mandela?

478
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,470
I did. He just wanted to
get out of there. Yeah,

479
00:28:02,471 --> 00:28:06,830
he just belt and that $7 million
that he got off of Don King.

480
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,300
So the fight got made again because
after the third courtroom the judge says,

481
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,300
whose signature is this? How it seems
that it was his, you signed it? Yes.

482
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,250
Well you got to give him the rematch.
This is,

483
00:28:22,251 --> 00:28:24,620
you signed it to give them a rematch
so you have to give him a rematch.

484
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:28,850
So he didn't want to hear that. So I was
happy. So the, and how long did it take?

485
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,410
Two years.
Two years.

486
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,230
And then was all that,
all those brawls in the,

487
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:37,640
remember the ESPN studio when him and
Rockman I got into a fight over a table

488
00:28:37,641 --> 00:28:41,120
and everything. Yeah. The Alex was wearing
this big Steve Harvey suit. Did you

489
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:46,210
let me tell you it wasn't
Steve RBC to cause I had this,

490
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,020
I'm going to have the
slipper shoes in the world.

491
00:28:48,021 --> 00:28:50,870
I didn't come here to fight
that too. Like, you know,

492
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:54,710
do press slippery shoes are the worst.
If anything goes down.

493
00:28:54,711 --> 00:28:57,740
You got those leather
shoulder. Oh my God. On carpet.

494
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,500
That's where you got to know,
learn Jujitsu.

495
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,160
Now when you were in that time period,
I don't remember.

496
00:29:07,161 --> 00:29:09,920
Did you have fights in between? Uh, yeah.

497
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:13,400
How many fights did you have after a
rock? Oh No. It didn't have no fights.

498
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,740
No fights. No. No. I just trained
for Rockman. Just waited. Yeah,

499
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,020
so it took you two years. Two years. That
must have been so frustrating. It was.

500
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:24,200
It was because you never know if you're
going to get the fight or not or you

501
00:29:24,201 --> 00:29:25,550
know,
these guys are running from you.

502
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:29,690
They signed to fight a rematch because
you know now they didn't want to sign it.

503
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,610
I remember when that right hand landed.

504
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,760
I remember when I was watching it at
home and I threw my arms up in the air.

505
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,590
I was like, Oh shit. I went to sleep.

506
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,240
Let's,

507
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,600
let's check this out man.

508
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,260
I mean for a long time come
and you're waiting for it.

509
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:49,701
You know,
for this,

510
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,960
this flight Rockman couldn't catch me
cause my speed was different. You know,

511
00:29:52,961 --> 00:29:54,820
in South Africa it was a lot slower.

512
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:00,040
Now he got kind of a little
frustrated because he couldn't
get to this. Boom. Yup.

513
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,960
Oh Man. No. Over the top of the
shoulder. Let them counts though.

514
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,970
Oh,
that was a phenomenal player.

515
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,050
That was probably one of the most
satisfying one punch knock outs I've ever

516
00:30:11,051 --> 00:30:15,730
watched because I knew what you had gone
through and I knew like everybody knew

517
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,570
you were one of the greatest of all time
and to have you get chaos like that.

518
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:20,351
First of all,

519
00:30:20,351 --> 00:30:24,670
it made it endeared people to you in a
way because it shows your vulnerability,

520
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:28,750
but also your character and your ability
to come back, which is not easy. Man.

521
00:30:28,751 --> 00:30:31,690
When you get stopped like that,
like psychologically,

522
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,450
it's got to be fucking with your head.
Let me tell you,

523
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:38,500
the first time I lost everybody was coming
up and shaking my hand and said, well,

524
00:30:38,501 --> 00:30:40,270
what are you going to do now?
I'm like,

525
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,400
what do you mean what am
I going to do now? Yeah.

526
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:46,060
What you gonna do now is I'm going to
go back and when my championship I said

527
00:30:46,061 --> 00:30:48,820
okay, you know, they didn't think
it was going to be possible,

528
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:53,821
but I'm thinking Muhammad Ali
gained the championship three times.

529
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:58,000
Yeah. So I've only lost it
once. I can do it again.

530
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,480
It takes a special person to
do it and I can do it. Do you,

531
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:03,910
do you feel like there was
like two stages of your career?

532
00:31:03,911 --> 00:31:07,090
Like Pre Emanuel steward
and post? Yeah, absolutely.

533
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:08,950
There's two sizes of them too.

534
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:13,300
Then if you look at it serves like he
went from like a, like a, a skinny,

535
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:18,310
a skinny kid to a man. Like it just giant
fucking man out of nowhere. Yeah. Um,

536
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:22,660
the PRI, the PRI manual stew
was obviously, you know,

537
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:26,800
me learning how to be a
professional learning to fight pro.

538
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,230
And then once I got to a manual,
we just like, Yo, he said, hey,

539
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:34,840
you're a great fighter. You
know, he used to move around La,

540
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,570
we've got to bring that back.
And I'm like, okay, cool.

541
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:42,790
So the movement and he brought back, he
taught me a couple of uh, Kronk tricks,

542
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,900
you know, that check hook and different
things that the Krung fighters do,

543
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:51,760
which works well. Um, and uh, you
know, he was easy to understand.

544
00:31:51,761 --> 00:31:56,260
Then what I liked about him, what he
said I can do, I could accomplish.

545
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:59,270
He just told me what to do. I'll
do it. Yeah. If he said, Lynn,

546
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:02,400
we need to win this room and I'll
win that round. You know what I mean?

547
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:03,870
You had that kind of
relationship, right? Yeah.

548
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,790
He was really one of the great
masters. You know, there, there's,

549
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,150
there's certain masters when it
comes to like boxing training.

550
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,310
Like when you would hear
him discuss fighters,

551
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:16,000
like I really loved hearing
him do commentary as well
because he would discuss

552
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:19,510
fighters and what they need to do
and he was always just dead on.

553
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,370
He just knew things.

554
00:32:21,371 --> 00:32:24,820
He understood boxing so comprehensively.

555
00:32:24,821 --> 00:32:27,130
He just knew what a fighter needed to do.

556
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,040
So I was so excited when he started
working with you because it was like,

557
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,210
well that's, that's exactly what Lennox
needs. So it was HBO because you know,

558
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:38,230
it's funny, I'll do fights on HBO and
they will say, oh, he's doing this,

559
00:32:38,231 --> 00:32:40,130
he's not doing this.
He needs to do more.

560
00:32:40,131 --> 00:32:43,670
And he's a total nut job
more than Emmanuel started
working for me and he's like,

561
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,000
oh, he's doing the jab was doing well.
I was like, Oh, this is what you need.

562
00:32:47,001 --> 00:32:51,430
You need a great coach at time. You're
going on TV that the commentators respect.

563
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:55,430
Then they'll talk good about the boxer.
But if you're not a good trainer is like,

564
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,600
what do they need to talk about?

565
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,980
They took a lot of shit and boxing
commentary. Oh yeah, they did.

566
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,680
They let you know whose side they're
on. They always are. You know,

567
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:07,310
you could talk about how they're guiding
your brain to watch the fight. Well,

568
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:11,750
they also, they'd talk a little shit.
It's more like sports commentary,

569
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:15,800
like a mixed martial arts commentary.
Yeah, I don't, I don't do that.

570
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:18,890
I don't really talk shit
ever. I mean, I occasionally,

571
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:22,160
if something's egregiously bad
I'll talk about that. You know,

572
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:25,250
there's real issues here, but
I tried to, I tried to just

573
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,100
write a comment. Both of them aren't, I
try hard at that because I wasn't always,

574
00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:33,620
you know, I've, I've had, and I
learned how to do it on the job.

575
00:33:33,621 --> 00:33:34,590
Nobody really knew how to do.

576
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,100
There wasn't a lot of people doing
it before I started doing it.

577
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,710
What sucks for you because your
findings with all the fighters,

578
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,760
it's hard when you watch a friend of yours
fuck up another friend of yours. Yeah,

579
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,600
that's hard.

580
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,210
What about a friend of you as a student?

581
00:33:47,211 --> 00:33:49,970
Something wrong that needs to do
something right? Do you tell him?

582
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:55,010
I tell him privately, uh, Mo, CIF
from, for me, I would like to,

583
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,770
I wish I was like that. I wish
I could do that, but you know,

584
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,810
people want more truth out in me,

585
00:33:59,811 --> 00:34:03,140
so I try and bring it across in the
software and not make it too harsh.

586
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:06,860
I would bring, I would say there's
issues like I see something,

587
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:10,280
if I see like a vulnerability, I
will, I will, I'll discuss that.

588
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,650
But if there's something that
someone needs to work on or do,

589
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:17,120
I'll try to pull them aside, you know? But
most of them know, you know, just there,

590
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,910
you know, like MMA fighters,
I'm sure a lot like boxer sick.

591
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,950
There's different kinds of humans and
some of them are just fucking wild.

592
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,550
And those wild ones, you know, a lot
of times they never become champion,

593
00:34:28,551 --> 00:34:32,150
but they're the most exciting people
to watch. Like, like Micky Ward,

594
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:35,660
like making words, fights with a Touro
God. There are some of the greatest,

595
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,240
cause they were,
the way they matched up some of the,

596
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,910
I would never want one of my friends to
fight like that to lunatics and one rain.

597
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,600
I'm like, God man, those
fights where chaos though.

598
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,940
Everybody knew that those guys were,

599
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:49,370
they're never going to be made whether
they're never going to beat the best guys,

600
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:53,540
but God damn,
they were fun to watch some of the crazy,

601
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:58,190
they were like raising generations.
Uh, uh, prior. Arguayo almost, almost,

602
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,620
except they went back and
forth and back and forth.

603
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,960
You know who, who was it that, uh,
had an arm injury and still boxed?

604
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,183
Micky Ward?

605
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,160
No, it wasn't at Bernard Hopkins when
he fought Antwan Eccles. He, uh, I,

606
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,650
I might, I might be wrong. You mean a
blood got permanent, like a broken arm.

607
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,840
Someone got their arm broke
in or pulled out. That was a,

608
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:23,080
it was Antwan Eccles. It might've been
against Hopkins or was against somebody,

609
00:35:23,081 --> 00:35:24,130
but somebody,

610
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:28,300
the guy who picked him up and slammed
him and he dislocated his shoulder and

611
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:30,430
then the ref was like, should I stop
the fight? It's like, no, no, no.

612
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,910
And he knocked the guy
with the left hook after,

613
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,520
but it just can't be
done with his left hand.

614
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,220
He's got slammed and they stopped the
fight. Then he came and won the rematch.

615
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:42,540
Remember that? Uh, yes, but
I, I recall, I recall them.

616
00:35:42,541 --> 00:35:46,560
Guy would knock him out in the next round
with his left hand only was at Hopkins.

617
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,990
It might've been Hopkins Eccles.
If, and I'll tell you what,

618
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:53,310
one of the hardest fights for me to
watch was a Hopkins versus Joe Smith.

619
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:53,730
That was,

620
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:57,150
that was a bummer down and fell out
of the ropes and landed on his head.

621
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,950
I was like, man, that is just,

622
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,360
first of all the fact that there was
no padding on the ground. This is God,

623
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,440
this is Bernard Hopkins is one of the
greatest of all time and this is how this

624
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:11,760
is set up. You know, and they don't
use, they don't put it on the ground.

625
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,120
They need to have something.
They're like, no, it's an apron.

626
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,220
Tables have to put more people around
the ring. So anybody's comes flying out.

627
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:23,250
Yeah. Well that's how they
do in Japan. I can pride,

628
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:27,150
they would have guys like waiting by
the side of the ring to stop guys from

629
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,860
falling around the right
cause they would use rings,

630
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,370
which I don't recommend for
MMA cause this pros and cons.

631
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,620
The pro is that the cage,

632
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:38,650
the cage kind of like you can kind
of hold a guy again against the cage.

633
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:42,620
He can't really hold the guy very
well against, uh, against the ropes.

634
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:47,030
Here it is right here. See
He, I mean like you fell boom,

635
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:48,870
like right on his head, man. I mean,

636
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:53,520
I think that's concrete yet is he went
through and somebody bumps you up to

637
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:55,980
fights over. Yeah. You're not,

638
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,980
you get disqualified the minute somebody
helps you back into the ring. Oh really?

639
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,530
Yeah. You have to get up on your
own and get back in on your own.

640
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,720
Little interesting details.

641
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:09,210
Shows this light of ruined the
fight for him if he was okay. Yeah.

642
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,130
Like if he was okay, if he fell and then
someone helps them get back up the tech.

643
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:16,770
Oh, that's interesting. Yeah.
Somebody be, Sean, don't touch him,

644
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:21,210
but nobody knows if he's all right or not.
Right.

645
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:23,870
Especially when you see him land on the
shoe in nature. They're running help,

646
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:28,350
but it's also he's 50 or 51 yeah, it
was right. Yeah. Let's see. 51 yeah.

647
00:37:28,351 --> 00:37:31,350
He was not young in that fight.
When you see a guy like him,

648
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:36,150
like how the fuck does a guy like
that defy the odds and defy time?

649
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,890
I mean it's just a skill level experiment,

650
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:43,710
experience intelligence and Neural Hopkins
is an intelligent, funny. He's like,

651
00:37:43,711 --> 00:37:43,951
you know,

652
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:48,951
you watch him fight smart and doesn't
spend one day out of shape and eat clean

653
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,430
doesn't party. Yeah. He still to
this day I follow his Instagram.

654
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:57,360
He's always training. He's
always exercising. Still
look slim still looks good.

655
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,370
He's got a true focus. Yeah. Yeah. It's
interesting that that he became that way.

656
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,730
Like in his estimation because
of prison time, you know,

657
00:38:05,731 --> 00:38:10,170
going to prison turned him
into a disciplined man. You
know, like realizing like,

658
00:38:10,171 --> 00:38:12,510
like this is rock bottom.
I fucked up. I need to,

659
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:16,200
I need to get my life in
order and did and you know,

660
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,320
imagining the people out there
that committed a crime spend three,

661
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:26,580
four years in jail because of some
stupid crime they could spend that time

662
00:38:26,581 --> 00:38:29,640
training and being the
world champion at something,

663
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:34,770
at anything which just just develop,
use that time to develop yourself.

664
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:38,980
Develop your mind. You know, I
mean, when, when Hopkins was,

665
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:42,610
they were already writing him off
when he fought Felix Trinidad,

666
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,480
remember that everybody thought the
Trinidad was going to run him over with a

667
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:51,290
shitty pulled in Puerto Rico in the,
and I'm like,

668
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:57,010
oh my God. He looked and he had to make
that like six or seven foot jump. Yeah.

669
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:01,210
Till the ground. And he was scared. He
was gonna break his legs. Hilarious.

670
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:05,390
I forgot about that. That was crazy.
They chased him out of the stadium. Yeah.

671
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:10,180
Well I'm sure if Tito had so much on his
mind in that fight, so much emotions,

672
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:10,850
you know,

673
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:14,410
and then that was the mental warfare
that Bernard won't run into that one for

674
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:19,210
sure. But then also he was just too
good. Yeah, he was too good. I mean,

675
00:39:19,211 --> 00:39:22,240
he was just, he was too
big. He hit too hard.

676
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:24,940
Like Trinidad really was a
lighter weight fight it than that.

677
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,170
It was a junior middleweight yeah. Brona
did that same thing. Almost got fun too.

678
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,000
Yeah. I was like, yeah,
exactly. Threw it down. Oh Man.

679
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:38,110
That was crazy. Yeah, that was
crazy. And you know, this was a kid,

680
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,160
I was like 36 at the time. Look at him.
They're all swinging at him and shit.

681
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,300
I that jump jumpy had to do,

682
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,240
was trying to get out of there for real.
If he just turned,

683
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,800
they would have stopped. If he turned
them like they would probably be like, oh,

684
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:55,690
what am I doing chasing a tiger?
He didn't chase it. Tiger.

685
00:39:55,691 --> 00:39:58,570
And you catch it. You got a
real fucking problem, you know?

686
00:39:58,571 --> 00:40:02,470
Did you ever have any thoughts at
all once you'd finally retired?

687
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,670
Like maybe one more. Did you ever have
any thoughts like that? Well, you know,

688
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:12,180
I told people like, I'll take, I'll take
my pajamas off for a hundred mil. Mm.

689
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:17,380
So she serious come with
the baby, show me the paper.

690
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:23,050
But who will have to be
against a Aaj maybe enticing.

691
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,400
But when you had beaten Tyson,
you'd beat Tyson.

692
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:31,630
That was kind of at the end of his stage
two, right? Yeah. It wasn't the same guy.

693
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,920
Like, I've, I, I looked at
Tyson's history, you know,

694
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:37,720
he's coming from the same history
that I'm coming from, you know,

695
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:42,730
and he spent some time in incarceration
while he was incarceration.

696
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,700
I'm still out there
fighting and training hard.

697
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,350
He didn't have that in there. So when,
when he came out, it's like, you know,

698
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,690
he's trained again. He's doing what
he, what he knows not what he loves,

699
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,160
what he knows dusk,

700
00:40:57,161 --> 00:41:00,640
what's going to make him some money
that's going to put food on this table.

701
00:41:00,641 --> 00:41:03,460
So it's like I look at
old time fighters and say,

702
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:08,620
what made them stay in boxing so long?
That's the only thing they knew, right.

703
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,550
Um, they didn't, they're not going to
be no singer or a dancer or whatever.

704
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,910
They only know boxing and this is where
they get their money from. So they,

705
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,340
that's what, that's what
forces them back into the ring,

706
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,250
especially,
especially olden days.

707
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:22,740
And that's why they were called prize
fighters because they wouldn't make enough

708
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:25,530
money to make a living
unless you were like a huge,

709
00:41:25,531 --> 00:41:30,210
I get Jack Dempsey or ray robins,
ray Robinson for way, way,

710
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:33,620
way past his prime again, cause they
were making good money at the time,

711
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:35,870
but not the money that they would
have been making if it was today.

712
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:39,260
Well there was no, I mean, you know,
you had to go see it live, you know,

713
00:41:39,261 --> 00:41:44,000
like how much you get paid for the radio.
Who was the fight on the radio?

714
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,690
Was it Jack Dempsey? Gene tiny. That was
the first million dollar gate, I think.

715
00:41:47,691 --> 00:41:48,770
So it was one of those,

716
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:52,720
Ray Arcel did that fight I think and that
create what does $1 million back then?

717
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:56,150
That sets a lot of money back then
it was in the 1920s. Right? Yeah.

718
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,460
Gene Tunney Jack Gene.
Gene Tony. Yeah. Um, when,

719
00:42:01,461 --> 00:42:03,470
when you,
Tyson was in jail,

720
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:07,760
he must've been doing something because
he came out jacked. Like he looked good.

721
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:12,800
Like he came out looking different than
he ever looked like six pack fully built

722
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,010
when he fought. Peter McNeely. Terrifying.

723
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,200
But like physically he
looked really good too.

724
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:21,350
Like you look better than he
ever look more ripped than ever.

725
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:25,660
So when he went in he was a little chubby.
Yeah. You know, what is it doing there?

726
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:30,920
Yes. Nothing else. That's weights.
Fuck dudes. That's why here, you know

727
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:37,030
how many dudes before it's enough. That's
how much time you're in there for it.

728
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:40,010
Yeah. That was him when he came
out. Yeah, he was shredded.

729
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,060
It was so much more muscular.
So he's probably,

730
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,700
he probably couldn't do any sparring.
I doubt they had a heavy bag,

731
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:49,490
but they probably had a weight
room, you know? But you can fight,

732
00:42:49,491 --> 00:42:53,300
you can fight in prison. And he was like
28 29 there. It depends on what prison,

733
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:57,780
right? No, I'm saying even fight.
Just fight. Fight people. Yeah, yeah,

734
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,750
yeah. You know, somebody would have tried
to start some shit with, oh, I'm sure.

735
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:06,350
I'm sure we're not on guard
even, you know. Yeah, I bet.

736
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:09,180
I bet he had to listen to a
lot of shitty things regard.

737
00:43:09,181 --> 00:43:11,330
It's funny when I seen him be arrested,

738
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:14,210
taken from the courtroom and they got,

739
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,290
they must've got the biggest guy they
could ever get to go put handcuffs on him

740
00:43:18,291 --> 00:43:22,850
or something like that.
Um, anyway, situation that.

741
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,810
Yeah. I hope a lot of
people stay away from, yeah.

742
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,040
When he went away did you feel like,
dammit,

743
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,210
like I'm going to miss out on that
fight that I want yes. Straight away.

744
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:36,830
And he's like, oh no, I'm going to
have to wait and delay my retirement.

745
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,180
Oh,
so you were waiting,

746
00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,440
you were considering retirement even
before he was incarcerated? Yeah. Wow.

747
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,640
Interesting. Chasing the bull
fight, both fired chicken bowl,

748
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:50,060
you know, you figured
that um, chicken bowl,

749
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:53,270
so she couldn't call them ridiculous,

750
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,950
but she can go and try to pick
a fight with me the other day.

751
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,840
They didn't really do the other day
he did. Yeah. Where, um, out of fight,

752
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,820
it was like in la where they called
all the great ones on jury Cooney, me,

753
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,060
uh, foreman Spinks was
there and what was he doing?

754
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,520
He wanted to stand beside me and
take a picture. I'm like, dude,

755
00:44:16,521 --> 00:44:20,120
you can't stand beside me.
Costs down. We're all wanting
to stand. I'm like, dude,

756
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:21,103
you're going to have to move.

757
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,360
So Gerry Cooney kind of helped us
out there while I'm saved them.

758
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,400
Cause he can smell. Yeah. He can't have a
rough time. Yeah. The difference between

759
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:37,230
a guy like you who gets out, who speaks
perfect and a guy like him, he's,

760
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,580
he's the the warning, you know, that's the
warning to the young fighter. You know,

761
00:44:41,581 --> 00:44:44,720
you see the, the older
guy who, you know, I,

762
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:48,150
I saw an interview with him and it was
one of the saddest things I've ever seen.

763
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:51,690
It was horrible because I go back and I
think about those fights with Holyfield

764
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,860
was fucking crazy wars insane. And
you know, he paid that price man.

765
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,180
He paid that price and you can hear
it when he's talking now. It's rough.

766
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:01,080
It's hard to listen to it.

767
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:05,680
The good news is now we're on the other
side of fighters coming out that punchy.

768
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,350
I think with all the rules and
changes that have been made,

769
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,760
what change you won't,

770
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,600
you won't meet as many punchy guys
as you met from back in the day.

771
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:16,450
Like you listen to personnel,
you listen to Riddick,

772
00:45:16,451 --> 00:45:17,890
you listen to Meldrick Taylor.

773
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,890
He in a lot of guys personnel bad now
he's a little and pronounce it even got

774
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,700
hit that mark. But I think for now
this is probably more from a, you know,

775
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,710
cocaine makes you slurry work.
I Dunno man.

776
00:45:29,711 --> 00:45:32,590
You know you're do enough shit in
your life. He drinks, he drinks a lot.

777
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,630
I wasn't drinking.
I got drunk with porno ones.

778
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:39,290
One of the things that they
say with older fighters is,

779
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:43,330
and even older football players is they
become addicted to alcohol because like

780
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,620
they're, they're searching for something
to try to like recalibrate their brain.

781
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,610
You know? I mean there's a scientific
explanation to it that people talk about.

782
00:45:51,611 --> 00:45:56,430
People with traumatic brain injury often
become alcoholics. It's like they're,

783
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,960
they're trying to get some sort of
a dopamine rush out. Could also,

784
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:02,260
you could also use the alcohol
as a justification as to
why you're slurring your

785
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:07,210
speech. Well, I know a dude who's a MMA
fighter who has, he's, he's punching,

786
00:46:07,211 --> 00:46:10,870
he's had a bunch of shots and this
motherfucker will have one drink and you

787
00:46:10,871 --> 00:46:15,790
can't understand a word he's saying.
It hits them so hard, so hard.

788
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:19,360
It's like, it's, it's confusing. It's
like, how would, how are you that drunk?

789
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:20,330
And then you realize,

790
00:46:20,330 --> 00:46:24,080
oh, he's, this is both things.
It's both things. It's,

791
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:27,290
it's the brain damage
and the alcohol combined.

792
00:46:27,291 --> 00:46:32,270
Just the wheels come off the carry. It's
bad. Yeah, it's, it's awful. But you, you,

793
00:46:32,271 --> 00:46:36,660
you've made it out perfect. Matt,
you've made so far so far, so far.

794
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,340
Years will tell. Yeah. Do
you worry about that? Um,

795
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:45,470
not really. Um, like, uh, I try and keep
my mind active. I play a lot of chess.

796
00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:50,780
How often you play chess? Every day.
Really? Yeah. Do you play online?

797
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:55,550
Competitive? I play on line
because whoever, whoever
jumps in the battle. How good.

798
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:58,580
Are you? Pretty degree. Yeah.
It's pretty good. As a bully.

799
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,100
He you he is, no, he,

800
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:03,710
he used to get mad at me cause I'd
go to his house and he'd be like,

801
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:07,490
you want to play chess? I go, I don't
know, just play. When I got to play,

802
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,380
just beat me up and were like,
get out of here. Just move.

803
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,290
Bringing somebody to complain to you. A
study chess. None as much as I should.

804
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:19,720
Uh, I just played often. And uh, you know,

805
00:47:19,721 --> 00:47:22,510
when you play offering there,
you know,

806
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,610
people will come out with the
same moves and it's like, oh,

807
00:47:24,611 --> 00:47:28,690
I've seen this movie before.
I know what to do. Right.
Uh, but you know, it depends.

808
00:47:28,691 --> 00:47:30,250
There's people that use

809
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,370
the ponds to, to, to wage war user, um,

810
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,240
the nights or the bishops in combination.

811
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,350
So it really depends on what type
of player they are. I'm a you right?

812
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,250
I'm a bully play.

813
00:47:42,251 --> 00:47:46,950
I like playing the Joe
Rogan of pool of chat.

814
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,020
Well listen,
I can my defense Lennox to challenge me,

815
00:47:50,850 --> 00:47:54,180
I was too late or just for people don't,
um,

816
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:57,010
don't challenge anybody on their
own table. Lennox challenge.

817
00:47:57,011 --> 00:48:01,900
Giotto came a pool before the podcast
and Joe fucking cleared the table before

818
00:48:01,901 --> 00:48:05,170
Lennox could get one shot.
Yeah, it was good. It was a,

819
00:48:05,171 --> 00:48:08,560
that was the warmup where I won
the second game too. So yeah,

820
00:48:08,561 --> 00:48:11,910
he doesn't need the second game as well.
I'm still warming up. I would go back.

821
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,870
He's got the time deficit.

822
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:18,670
That's a crazy game though on that table
because that table as four inch pockets.

823
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,440
That's my practice table. You a four
inch bucket. Hey, wait a minute. Whoa.

824
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:28,030
You putting it? Uh, I have a regular table
at home. Well not a regular tape. It's a,

825
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:31,070
diamond's got four and a half inch
pockets. It's still a little tired.

826
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:33,700
Normal Po Po.
Like if you go to a pool hall,

827
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:36,040
they'll give you a five inch
pocket or a five and a half inch.

828
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:39,970
But I got to pull too much. This
guy fucking, I got the best.

829
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:45,100
This table, you can't mess. And it's, it's
dirty right now too. So it's, it's even,

830
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:47,380
it's even like the cloth slow.

831
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,400
So balls don't drop unless they go right
through the same type of coffees up.

832
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,750
Yes. That's the most, that's the
best one. Yeah. It's the best. Yeah.

833
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,240
It's a great table. That's a
1972 pool table. Oh really?

834
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:02,620
Some guy had it in his basement forever.
And uh, my friend Dani sold it to me.

835
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:06,070
Yeah, the guy just had it sitting in
his basement. It's in perfect condition.

836
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:08,050
It's a basement find. Yeah, man,

837
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,970
that's a hard table to get know somewhere
in California. I love about that table.

838
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,870
Well, guess what, what,

839
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:18,460
you don't want to have to walk around
and take the buckets of balls out of the

840
00:49:18,461 --> 00:49:22,390
park. Yeah, yeah. That's annoying. Yeah.
It's like ball return. They're all there.

841
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:26,890
Boom. Yeah. Those, those holes. When I
got those, I got those. It's annoying.

842
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,070
But you probably have like a decorative
pool table came with the house.

843
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:34,930
You have a beautiful house.
You've been invited many times.

844
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,880
He's been to my house when
it was with my parents.

845
00:49:36,881 --> 00:49:41,630
He never came to my house as
a, as a solo man. Now, um,

846
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:46,510
when you play chess, um, are
you like, do you get ranked?

847
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:50,290
Are you a yeah. What it
is, is your, your um,

848
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:54,050
your points go up.
So I'm at 11 on 11,

849
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:59,260
7,000 1100 right now. Sorry. What is that
like? Whoa. The rankings are like, if,

850
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:01,770
you know, if you're up to
14, you're a master for,

851
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,070
so you're closing in on being a master.
Well, I wouldn't call me a master yet,

852
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:10,420
but you know, obviously if I get that I'm,
I'm trying to get as high as possible,

853
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:12,130
but if someone talks shit
and they're like, Lennox,

854
00:50:12,131 --> 00:50:16,330
I want to please was something, not pull
some chats, you'd be like, oh, okay. Yeah,

855
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,810
because straight away, what's one of
the most mentally intensive games?

856
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,300
That's probably one reason
why you stay so sharp.

857
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:24,700
I would imagine there's
a time restriction.

858
00:50:24,701 --> 00:50:28,640
10 minutes till you played
that we hit the slap the clock,

859
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,880
10 minutes for a move for 10 minutes
for the whole game. For the whole game.

860
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:34,770
Oh Dang. Whoa. On the, on the, um,

861
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,650
it's a fast game on the computer. Once
you've made that move, the time goes over.

862
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:42,410
It just resets. So it's good. Now,

863
00:50:42,411 --> 00:50:45,890
do you ever go like to Washington square
park and play those dudes done? Really?

864
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,000
Yeah. Yeah. That's, that was,
that was fun. They talk a
lot of Shit, Huh? Oh yeah.

865
00:50:50,001 --> 00:50:51,770
They're good too.
They're good.

866
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,880
The guy that was playing was talking a
lot of shit. Yeah. Yeah. Did you beat him?

867
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:00,410
Um, no. Wow. You should have hit him.
Why did you have to ask that question?

868
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,710
It was just fun playing
him when he's doing,

869
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,960
when you're gonna be a winner all the
time. Those guys are masters. It's true.

870
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:11,090
They got nothing else going on. Well, I
mean, that's all they wanted to. I mean,

871
00:51:11,091 --> 00:51:13,880
when you get really good at chess,
and I'm not really good at chess,

872
00:51:13,881 --> 00:51:17,630
but I have friends at are they explain
to you like it becomes your whole life.

873
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,120
Like you start thinking like as
you're walking in the street,

874
00:51:20,121 --> 00:51:21,820
you're thinking about chess.
He just,

875
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:25,370
it becomes a thing where it's just
everything. It's all, it's, so,

876
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:29,780
it's such an intense game.
I played like four games a day.

877
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:34,640
Wow. Online. Tim, what's your
online name? Um, let me see.

878
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,520
Do you use an online live? Yes I do.
They don't use your real name. Right.

879
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:40,170
I'm going to get it
right now. It's um, oh,

880
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:47,100
I made this name a long time
ago in Washington square
park of that playing some

881
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,840
masters that MC supernatural.

882
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,780
Those dudes love that game though, Matt.
I mean there's those guys who were there.

883
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:00,140
If you go there and there'll be there
every day, they fucking live for it.

884
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,100
You know, it's um, it's one of
those things I really admire.

885
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:07,040
I really admire people that get it
get really, really good at chess.

886
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,830
2000 Inter 2000. What
does that mean? Well,

887
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:17,800
it was supposed to be Interpol team.
Tell hold 2000.

888
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:23,600
It's like the name Interpol. It sounds
official when when people were playing,

889
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:24,680
playing is integral.

890
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:29,350
I think this is the government
I'm planning at CIA.

891
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:32,240
So if you're out there and
you're playing into 2000,

892
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:37,010
you're playing Lennox motherfucking Louis.
Yeah. I was going to put my real name,

893
00:52:37,011 --> 00:52:40,310
but yeah, I don't want everybody
to try and beat the champ.

894
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:43,460
Well now they're going to turn this
retired right now. Let it be known.

895
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,740
The Lennox Lewis is one of those dudes
that walks around with no case on his

896
00:52:45,741 --> 00:52:50,630
iPhone two and it smashed, it
smashed. If I tell you what happens,

897
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:55,790
what happened? I was doing something.
Then all of a sudden, you know,

898
00:52:55,791 --> 00:52:58,770
my wife said do this. And I went,
Ooh. And it flew out of your hand.

899
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:03,710
You have the biggest hands of any human
being I know. And A, and there's no,

900
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,110
there's no phone that's gonna be
big enough. Lets you carry an iPad.

901
00:53:06,111 --> 00:53:09,050
Well let me tell you,
I don't know who makes these iPhones,

902
00:53:09,051 --> 00:53:12,590
but they may come to slip
out of your hands. They do.

903
00:53:12,591 --> 00:53:16,760
They really did like put something
on that. That's grips have a case.

904
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,220
That's the first thing I did was
put a case on. Right. And then, um,

905
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,350
I forgot what I had to do.

906
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,830
You have to take it off to charge
it up or something that yeah,

907
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:28,990
got the wrong case.
You have the wrong case case.

908
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,960
Whoever you sold your cases an Asshole,

909
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:33,760
I guess it doesn't have a thing where
you could just stick a hole in that,

910
00:53:33,761 --> 00:53:36,530
look at it. Never run jre case.
Look at these guys challenged.

911
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,080
They're all challenging
me. Are they now? I go,

912
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:41,730
a boy called this game right now.

913
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:46,230
They're going to come after you now
though. They find out they can play.

914
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,800
I liked that they're doing it while
we're doing the podcast live. Hey look,

915
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:53,040
he's going to get obsessed. The wheels
are spinning. The competitive drive.

916
00:53:53,310 --> 00:53:56,690
Let me tell you, my wife gives me
problems on this. He says, you know,

917
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,533
he's playing chess.

918
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,420
They women don't understand that
you playing chess and focusing on,

919
00:54:01,421 --> 00:54:04,950
I'm trying to tell her, listen,
I'm up to this score point.

920
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:08,880
Don't interrupt because it affects
my score, but I need you now.

921
00:54:08,881 --> 00:54:13,510
I need to do we need to do this five
minutes please. Five minutes. You know,

922
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,100
she's looking at me weird, but
she's gotten better. She's actually,

923
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:21,690
are you playing chess? So and then she
leaves you alone. Yeah. Oh, that's good.

924
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:24,010
I think because I got mad
a couple of times probably.

925
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:30,630
Yeah.
Big bully with his wife Jean.

926
00:54:30,631 --> 00:54:33,960
Play chess with people other than Lennox.
No, I can't play chess. I don't know.

927
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,800
I can't either. Maybe you and I played
together. We should really learn the gap.

928
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:37,653
You're learning together.

929
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,310
I want to video this game. Do you have any
fucking disgusting? Well, you know what?

930
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:47,130
You could coach the game. No, this
is the first time I was, I was,

931
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:51,690
I would ever see a chess game
turned into checkers. Hmm. Oh Man.

932
00:54:51,691 --> 00:54:55,590
It's like I said, we're fighting. How,
how do you play this game again? How rude.

933
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:56,770
All this coming from

934
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,700
man doesn't really know how to play pool.
Oh,

935
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,870
shots fired. Shots fired. You're right.
You're right. I played billiards.

936
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:10,060
Billiards, three cushioned
billiards. You know what that is?

937
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:11,290
One, two, three.

938
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,440
Hold at. The now has no holes. Is that
the one that the bumpers? Yeah. Well,

939
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:19,870
the whole table, so you have to touch it.
Yeah. Yeah. Russian aggression, isn't it?

940
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:24,530
No, but I mean Russians play it. It's
a big, it's real big in South America.

941
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,540
It's real big in Mexico. It's real big.
And parts of Europe real big in Asia.

942
00:55:30,110 --> 00:55:31,850
Yeah.
It's a different game.

943
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,170
There's a to two different color balls
and like is he the two white balls and a

944
00:55:36,171 --> 00:55:39,020
red ball or two red balls and
white ball and you've got to,

945
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,430
or sometimes it's a yellow ball,

946
00:55:40,431 --> 00:55:43,970
red ball in a white ball and the idea is
you make contact with one ball and then

947
00:55:43,971 --> 00:55:48,080
you have to hit three cushions and then
make contact with the second ball. Wow.

948
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:53,330
Yeah, it's very complicated to watch.
It's, well if you know how to play it,

949
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:55,530
it's good to watch.
But if you don't know how to play it,

950
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:59,180
it's to thing about what I like about
pools. I like when the ball's disappear.

951
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:04,550
Like you make a ball goes away, it goes
in that hole by bitch, you sink the ball.

952
00:56:04,551 --> 00:56:07,040
It's like a, it's got a
finality to it. It feels good.

953
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:11,780
But with that it just clicks. It's
like just Ding, Ding, ding, click.

954
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,850
But the people love it.
Love it.

955
00:56:13,851 --> 00:56:16,670
It's a very intellectual game
cause it's all about geometry.

956
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,320
It's all angles and spin and you know,
I'm not good at that either.

957
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:26,080
It's tricky. It's a tricky, I'm not
good at it. I know it a little bit.

958
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,850
We're about table tennis.
I can't play.

959
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:32,590
That will test how you fucked me up high
and coordination. Oh yeah, I'm sure.

960
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:36,340
Yeah. Yeah. One thing I learned is
that you can't do too many things.

961
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:39,500
It will fuck you up. Like I've, I've, I've
a real problem with quake. You know what?

962
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:44,500
Quake is like video game. Jamie's
been fucked me up lately. Quick. Yeah.

963
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:48,790
We play, we got a computer room
set up in the back. It gets tense.

964
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,860
Yeah. We'll just wait.
What is this? Quake.

965
00:56:50,861 --> 00:56:54,880
What does the Three d game
where it's a computer game.

966
00:56:54,881 --> 00:56:57,960
You have all these weapons. You run
around picking up weapons and you're,

967
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:01,000
you're on a map.
So it's just like every map is different.

968
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,370
But you can do this in real life too.
I don't know why you're playing.

969
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,930
What do you mean hunting? That's
in the forest. That's different.

970
00:57:07,931 --> 00:57:11,860
I'm looking for meat. That's a
different thing kind of me onto for elk.

971
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:16,540
Mostly elk and deer. Yeah.
Nice. Yeah. Do you cut it up?

972
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:19,920
Same spot. Well you
butcher it. Ew. Ew. Ew.

973
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,630
Quarter it up while it's there.
So you can carry it out,

974
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:25,480
but you don't really like,
you want to protect the meat,

975
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:28,210
so we really want to get it out of
the woods first and cool it off.

976
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,350
You want to do, what do you do with all
the leftover leftover? Like what leftover?

977
00:57:32,351 --> 00:57:36,730
The limbs and stuff. Leave
him. Leave the bones.

978
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:40,210
You don't bury it. All the animals
will eat them. Oh, okay. Yeah.

979
00:57:40,211 --> 00:57:43,060
If you leave the bones behind that,
nothing goes to waste in the forest.

980
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,660
If you shoot an animal in the
forest and leave the bones behind,

981
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:50,950
so I'm just gonna eat it. If
they don't eat, they'll eat
most of it, you know, they,

982
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:55,300
they find it. Bears will find it. The
ecosystem will take care of everything.

983
00:57:55,630 --> 00:57:58,310
Rats, everything. They'll,
everything will take care of it. Now,

984
00:57:58,330 --> 00:58:01,570
how do your children feel about you
doing those bad things to this alimony?

985
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:05,980
Listen, as big as you are, you have to
eat meat. There's no way you're a Vegan.

986
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,690
Yeah.
Yeah.

987
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,890
Then my kids have used to it because
I've been hunting since they were little,

988
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:16,040
so they've eaten bear and deer and
elk. They eat it all to cook. Yeah,

989
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,580
all the time. That was bad
taste. Here's a question for you.

990
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,580
Do Wash your meat there?
Wash it.

991
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,420
Didn't like my deck is

992
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:33,910
no, going back to that. It's funny. A lot
of people take it that way. It's like,

993
00:58:33,911 --> 00:58:36,600
you know when you're cooking it's like
you're taking the meat from the butcher

994
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:37,660
is you don't know where it's been.

995
00:58:37,661 --> 00:58:42,610
The worst kind of rinse the chicken or
whatever or put some Vinnie grove written

996
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,720
it like that. So that's what me and my
wash it. Well, when you're cooking it,

997
00:58:46,721 --> 00:58:50,680
you're cooking the outside and anything
that might be bacteria is going to get

998
00:58:50,681 --> 00:58:51,514
killed.

999
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,760
The real issue is when you have
an animal that has parasites,

1000
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,890
that's the issue.
So what if you're like cooking a deer?

1001
00:58:59,891 --> 00:59:02,230
You don't have to worry about
that because tears are herbivores.

1002
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,190
Herbivores don't really have
parasites, but um, you can get,

1003
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,450
they can get some this,
some worms that they do get,

1004
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,500
but most of the time,
like some pork isn't pork.

1005
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:17,980
Definitely cat and the park, you get
trick analysis. That's pretty serious.

1006
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,740
That's pretty serious shit.
I do enjoy me some pork though.

1007
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,410
You heard me man, the
devil's beast. Lennox. Hmm.

1008
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,330
This is why in bread and wine
you don't need the park? No,

1009
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:32,630
he used to be a rustic Kendrick, you know,

1010
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:35,680
chicken jerk chicken all day.

1011
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:39,400
That jerk chicken and talking
to them for some oxtail outside.

1012
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,370
Find a real good Jamaican restaurant. Is
there one in la? None that I've found.

1013
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,110
I've been here 13 years
and I can't find it.

1014
00:59:45,111 --> 00:59:49,510
No one where they have good jerk
chicken. Uh, swingers, you know that uh,

1015
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:52,990
that oh the camping or Beverly
or somewhere. Wherever it is.

1016
00:59:52,991 --> 00:59:56,750
Is it Beverly up there? Yeah,
they have to check it out.

1017
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,590
[inaudible] you doc, maybe you, your,

1018
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:03,710
your standards are higher because
you're actually Jamaican. Right.

1019
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:07,430
But for me it's tasty. I might be
off the, have you been to Jamaica?

1020
01:00:07,910 --> 01:00:10,570
You need to go? Yeah. Okay.
I think you would look at it.

1021
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:13,940
They're very important to go to Jamaica
because everybody always tells you

1022
01:00:13,941 --> 01:00:17,800
different stories and stuff. But it's
a, it's a paradise over there. Yeah.

1023
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:19,370
What do you like most about it?

1024
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,430
That you can see different colors.
You know, cause I spent a long,

1025
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:29,930
long time in London and when I left
London to go to Jamaica I was like wow,

1026
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,820
all these different fiber and colors,

1027
01:00:31,821 --> 01:00:34,720
even in the water colors
in the trees and the,

1028
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:39,410
when you're driving around
London it's gray. Gray. Yeah.
You know, different cities,

1029
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:43,310
they're grace. So I like, I like
contacts with contact with plants,

1030
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,630
vibrant energy. Yeah. So you
know, that's an interesting thing.

1031
01:00:47,631 --> 01:00:51,230
You know a lot of people do forget
that you were from England, right.

1032
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:55,760
And that there was a stigma with
English boxers for a long time.

1033
01:00:55,761 --> 01:00:59,660
And you, you broke that you were the man.
But because of the stigma, because the,

1034
01:00:59,661 --> 01:01:04,310
I heard that was um, uh Oh,
British boxers or of horizontal.

1035
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:06,380
Yes.
Well they were more vertical.

1036
01:01:06,381 --> 01:01:09,290
They would stand straight up and they
would have like that European style,

1037
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:11,360
but it was like Henry Cooper,

1038
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:15,050
remember when Henry Cooper drop
Muhammad Ali and then they cheated,

1039
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:16,310
cut his glove,
the glove.

1040
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:21,860
I mean he was sort of one of the last
great English boxers before you came

1041
01:01:21,861 --> 01:01:25,760
along. And then for a long time
there was guys that were pretty good,

1042
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:27,890
like Frank Bruno pretty good.

1043
01:01:28,010 --> 01:01:31,310
But then they would get in there with
guys like Tyson and they would always wind

1044
01:01:31,311 --> 01:01:34,370
up losing. So everybody had
these, like, this is our guy.

1045
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:37,070
This is the one in Frank Bruno.
Damn. Did he looked apart?

1046
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:42,170
Was there ever a man more jacked as
a heavyweight boxing, no fat on him.

1047
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:46,160
Jesus Christ, he was a Goliath. He
was carved out of granite and Oh yeah.

1048
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:49,310
I mean nobodies. There's never
been a better built boxer ever way.

1049
01:01:49,311 --> 01:01:53,870
You'd look at Frank Bruno and you go, how
does he not kill everybody? He's so big.

1050
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:58,370
Let me tell you, you should see Frank
Bruno now. I would still chisel.

1051
01:01:58,610 --> 01:02:01,640
Really phenomenal.
Genetics must be phenomenal.

1052
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:06,490
Genetics even at the age who'd
like 65 wow. Think of Anders.

1053
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:10,280
Same thing. Oh yeah. Well, yeah.
Well Vander, you know, people forget,

1054
01:02:10,281 --> 01:02:14,120
he started out as cruiserweight. He was
a much smaller guy. Light heavyweight.

1055
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:18,440
Actually. Was He in the UFC? I mean
boxing it and then when the, oh no,

1056
01:02:18,441 --> 01:02:20,040
it was out in the light heavyweight

1057
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,370
title from Dwight Muhammad. Calm.
That was no, as I was cruising,

1058
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:27,180
which is a hell of a fight.
There was a hell of a fight that was,

1059
01:02:27,181 --> 01:02:29,640
that was like his big fight like to,

1060
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:34,290
to prove himself as a professional
because Kali was tricky. Five, seven,

1061
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:39,210
200 pounds. It was weird fighter man.
Well that was the American Olympic trials,

1062
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:42,210
right? Well, no, that was the,
he was uptight. There's no fight.

1063
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:45,630
That was for the cruiserweight title.
No, I hadn't been. Eddie Davis was,

1064
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:48,140
let me tell you, he had
login it. Frank Bruno,

1065
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:50,940
he got to see him with his
shirt off is still cut,

1066
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:54,990
but you could tell skinny ass legs.
One leg kick. He's got a problem.

1067
01:02:56,610 --> 01:03:00,810
Damn though he does look very good.
I one time he had big legs. Yes.

1068
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:06,000
Go see Frank Bruno back when he was in
his prime as a boxer. He was gigantic man.

1069
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:12,400
He was a, a sculpted as a boxer ever
gets. He really, he really wants,

1070
01:03:12,401 --> 01:03:16,890
it's not even a good picture now. It's not
one of the best. Yeah. He was so jacked.

1071
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,170
Yeah. Well, coffee was a, a
crate. The Camden Buzz saw,

1072
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:27,360
he was such a crazy fight it because he
would pull his shorts up here. Right.

1073
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,570
And he was five set of,

1074
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:32,550
tucked down super wide and he would
fight with that Philly shell and come in

1075
01:03:32,551 --> 01:03:34,710
real low. You know, he was a varied here.

1076
01:03:34,711 --> 01:03:37,830
That Archie Moore style almost
very difficult guy to deal with.

1077
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:42,600
Don't see those thoughts anymore. No,
no, no. When you watch boxing today,

1078
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,980
who really stands out to you?

1079
01:03:44,750 --> 01:03:47,420
Um, you know, all the, all
the champions right now.

1080
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,530
They didn't get to be champions for
no reason. And uh, you know, each,

1081
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:55,670
each one of them have different
qualities. Um, you know, even, well,

1082
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:59,390
let's look at the heavyweights. All the
heavyweights, the top three heavyweights.

1083
01:03:59,391 --> 01:04:01,400
Right now they're all over six feet,

1084
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:06,260
five and they all have a different
style, which is good because, you know,

1085
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:08,810
it reminds me of when me and the
Holyfield and Tyson will run,

1086
01:04:08,811 --> 01:04:12,830
we all had different styles, which
makes great fights. Now it's to guests,

1087
01:04:12,831 --> 01:04:14,570
which thought I was going
to beat which style?

1088
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:17,900
You never know because they're all
similar, you know, they all go,

1089
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:21,290
all three of them have knockout
pretension and uh, you know,

1090
01:04:21,291 --> 01:04:24,530
they're boxing to win.
So what we want to see,

1091
01:04:24,531 --> 01:04:26,390
we want to see who would win out of them.

1092
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:31,580
Deontay wilder to me is the most
perplexing because he hits so hard.

1093
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,120
It's almost like he's
got magic in his hands.

1094
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,160
He makes guys fly across the ring,

1095
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:40,750
but he's only 209 pounds and
he does it off balance. Yeah.

1096
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,930
And he does it with Polk legs in the air,
the Olympic team and want a gold,

1097
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:49,100
a bronze medal, a year and a
half into boxing. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1098
01:04:49,101 --> 01:04:50,960
That's my problem with the new,

1099
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:55,010
the new division is that they
don't have the amateur pedigree,

1100
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:58,220
but maybe the owner
needs to tease is great,

1101
01:04:58,610 --> 01:05:02,120
but our t's is much older than he says
he is. Is He, and what does he say?

1102
01:05:02,121 --> 01:05:06,840
He is 40 something like 40 or 41. How old
is he? I'm hearing the stories at Ortiz,

1103
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:10,820
like 49. How do you know? Um, somebody
tell me about from the amateurs.

1104
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:13,280
I remember seeing them in the amateurs
and the eighties and they're like, what?

1105
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:14,990
They would say that about Cuban stuff?
Yeah.

1106
01:05:14,991 --> 01:05:18,070
Cause they say that same shit
about Yolo or married on, he says

1107
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,430
he's 39. Yeah, he just fought on
the weekend or two weeks ago. Right.

1108
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:25,620
A couple of weeks ago in one stop it right
now. I think it was a decision, was it?

1109
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:29,260
If it wasn't that it was a late round
stoppage unless he just fought again.

1110
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:32,950
He just fought like last weekend or two
weeks ago. Two months ago to no, no,

1111
01:05:32,951 --> 01:05:37,120
he just fine. No, that was a stoppage. And
this fight just happened. So he's very,

1112
01:05:37,121 --> 01:05:40,390
he's been very active. He's trying to
come back. What do you think about that?

1113
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:43,480
Like how active you think
of boxer should be? Um,

1114
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:48,190
what it really comes down to,
you know, this is how it goes.

1115
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,570
If you're starting boxing,

1116
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:53,740
obviously you want to have as many fights
as possible to, you know, seasoning,

1117
01:05:54,060 --> 01:05:58,810
get that experience level.
So as much as possible,

1118
01:05:58,811 --> 01:06:03,010
it's usually four fights a year.
And then as you get better,

1119
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:06,850
it drops to three fights and then when
you're the champion that drops the two

1120
01:06:06,851 --> 01:06:11,710
fights. So, um, that's, that's the
progression of, of fighting. You can't,

1121
01:06:11,711 --> 01:06:16,070
like for instance, how many fights
did Deontae have this year? Maybe two.

1122
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:21,220
Brian, you know, before when
he was starting out, he would
have like three to four.

1123
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,240
Yeah. He's very angry that this rematch
is not happening. And I side with him,

1124
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:29,590
it was a Tyson or pulled out Tyson got
a deal with ESPN. Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1125
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:35,710
and it's, it's a, it's a big deal because,
you know, talking about chess match,

1126
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:36,640
I think that's,

1127
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,640
he's pulled off the greatest chess match
move there is first he comes over from

1128
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:47,080
England. He wouldn't, he
takes the challenge if with
Deontae, uh, Joshua didn't,

1129
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,990
he boxed,
he had a great fight.

1130
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:54,160
Now he's put himself right up with all,

1131
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:58,630
all three of them are on the same line
to me. And then now for the rematch,

1132
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,190
they want to,

1133
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:03,430
people want to see Deontae and they
want to see Tyson fury again because the

1134
01:07:03,431 --> 01:07:07,390
first fight, it was exciting. Uh, Joshua,

1135
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:11,170
who's he fighting? You know,
he's going to fight but big baby,

1136
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:13,450
but nobody knows him.
Everybody knows John.

1137
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:16,480
Take boxing fans now everybody
knows Tyson. Everybody in that,

1138
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:20,450
especially after that fight because it
was such a spectacular fight that knock

1139
01:07:20,451 --> 01:07:23,380
down. Oh my God, the first
knock down was great.

1140
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:28,060
The second knock down was preposterous.
So the fact that he rose like Lazarus,

1141
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,250
I mean it was crazy.
And then one the rest of the round,

1142
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:34,830
he gets tagged a few times and it
starts boxing and then even tag Deontae.

1143
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,340
I still had him winning that fight.

1144
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:41,730
It was close Tyson I think by around
I think boxing one that night.

1145
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:45,740
Every, yeah. Both guys
looked great. And uh,

1146
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:48,970
box 12 and maybe like assigning
fight that the rematch,

1147
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,670
obviously everybody wants
to see the rematch again.

1148
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:57,150
So when the rematch happened that that
put em from Joshua on the shelf in my

1149
01:07:57,341 --> 01:08:01,180
eyes. Now it's putting them on
the shelf a bit longer. Yeah.

1150
01:08:01,181 --> 01:08:04,360
With this ESPN deal.
And you know,

1151
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:09,280
Tyson fury is boxing in front
of the public. Yeah. Uh,

1152
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:14,100
Anthony, Joshua and Deontae
there pay per view. Right? Well,

1153
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:17,030
who are they going to fight? View?
Nobody wants to see no silly fight.

1154
01:08:17,031 --> 01:08:19,970
They want to see what the
fights. Yeah. You know, it's,

1155
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,770
it's a great move by Tyson fury.

1156
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,610
It's a great mobile. The first fight
that, that the fight ended in a draw it,

1157
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:29,220
right? Yeah. Yeah. So in the
draw, Deontae keeps a title,

1158
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:34,200
but it least Tyson walks away like
saying, look, look, I won the decision.

1159
01:08:34,201 --> 01:08:36,300
I feel like I should have won
the decision. There's a dispute.

1160
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,730
There's a debate about it, but
everybody wants to see that fight. Yeah.

1161
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:44,460
I'm going to draw is not from
the reasonable, but kaizen
could lose to somebody.

1162
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,070
Yeah. I've been mucking around saying, oh,

1163
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:53,520
I'll fight this or it won't find it till
next year and somebody might lose this,

1164
01:08:53,521 --> 01:08:54,150
what happens?

1165
01:08:54,150 --> 01:08:57,690
And now none of them can fight each
other because if Joshua fights fury and

1166
01:08:57,691 --> 01:09:00,960
loses to fury,
Joshua was star goes down.

1167
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:05,250
They've sure Joshua Fights Deontae and
beats Deontae the Tyson Deontae fights.

1168
01:09:05,251 --> 01:09:08,610
Not that exciting. Right. But
if Joshua wants real respect,

1169
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:13,200
he's got to fight either fury or
Deontae fights. Those are the big fight.

1170
01:09:13,230 --> 01:09:16,950
Obviously. Gets respect.
He's the heavyweight champion
of the world. But split,

1171
01:09:17,130 --> 01:09:20,880
you know, that's a weird thing
too. I'd like to see Joshua Ortiz.

1172
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:21,900
I've been interesting fight.

1173
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:26,280
There would be an interesting cause our
teas can box and hit what that was what

1174
01:09:26,281 --> 01:09:31,200
showed how God damn powerful Deontae is
that or was winning that fight and then

1175
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:34,680
I was, I think it was the 10th round and
they go to the seventh or 10th I don't

1176
01:09:34,681 --> 01:09:37,230
remember. But I remember when
he caught him, I was like, God,

1177
01:09:37,231 --> 01:09:38,790
that guy even late in the fight,

1178
01:09:38,791 --> 01:09:42,570
that guy carries no power or
tease his past his prime. Let's,

1179
01:09:42,571 --> 01:09:45,680
let's slow down there
Louis. Yes. Prime time

1180
01:09:46,090 --> 01:09:50,880
is a good fighter. But you know, give him,
give him, give him like 10 years. Yeah.

1181
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:54,920
And he would, he would have beat these
guys. He would have given them a good,

1182
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:57,260
good fight. But right now he's, you know,

1183
01:09:57,261 --> 01:10:01,620
he's obviously older and
he's an old fighter. Yeah.

1184
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:05,580
Well they caught him doing some steroids,
which is a lot of times guys get older,

1185
01:10:05,581 --> 01:10:09,500
they try to, yeah, you need it chews
up the old body. Yeah. So you know,

1186
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:12,860
when you reached that point where you
need steroids mentally, it affects you.

1187
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:16,760
Yeah. No. You go into the ring and it's
like, you know, you're missing something.

1188
01:10:17,090 --> 01:10:19,940
Something that was there in the
past and it made you feel good.

1189
01:10:19,941 --> 01:10:22,880
Now I don't feel as good.
Brian, when you were fighting,

1190
01:10:22,881 --> 01:10:26,150
did anybody that you were finding, did
you suspect that they were on something?

1191
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,730
Um, yeah. Oh, a couple times.

1192
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:34,360
But the good thing is that I
know is I realized they're right.

1193
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,990
Steroids can never get this.
A strong your chin.

1194
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,720
Chin. Yeah. So you can take
as much dirt as you want,

1195
01:10:41,721 --> 01:10:45,380
but I'm not hit you on the chin. Right.
You can't put muscles on your face. Yeah.

1196
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:49,760
Yeah. And then you know,
these body punches, you can't,

1197
01:10:49,761 --> 01:10:52,760
you can't protect around here.
So they will affect you as well.

1198
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:55,340
So that's where you, you
know, when you, when you hit,

1199
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,790
when you hit and guys around here,
body punches and you hit him on the chin,

1200
01:10:59,830 --> 01:11:00,663
it doesn't matter.

1201
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,650
But don't you think that it does
make some stronger physically?

1202
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:05,780
It gives them more vitality.

1203
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,350
Might make them able to absorb more
punishment for a minute. For a minute.

1204
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:11,090
Just for a little bit.
Yeah, for a little bit.

1205
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,800
Who Do you suspect was on
something when you follow them?

1206
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:14,790
Um,

1207
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,460
don't want to say you don't
want to. Yeah, go ahead.

1208
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:23,010
I think it was the first guy.
It's as far as I'm concerned,

1209
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:24,490
was the first guy on steroids back.

1210
01:11:25,510 --> 01:11:29,160
They look at the fucking size of that
guy in the, in the late nineties,

1211
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:30,450
especially when he fought Lennox.

1212
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:33,320
Have you ever asked him if
he's been on steroids? No,

1213
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:34,710
I've never actually
hung out with a vendor.

1214
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:37,530
I might've make your
victory party 20 years ago.

1215
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:41,880
You didn't hang around with the
guys that were like into it. Mark,

1216
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:42,840
whatever his name was,

1217
01:11:43,380 --> 01:11:46,950
he was the first guy to have a strength
and conditioning coach and a and all

1218
01:11:46,951 --> 01:11:48,390
that kind of stuff's Dietitian.

1219
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:51,540
Spanx did when he fought. Um,
when you fought Larry Holmes,

1220
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,320
he same guy shall stone Mackey.

1221
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:56,880
Shell stone got him in shape for
Larry when he was coming up from light

1222
01:11:56,881 --> 01:12:00,840
heavyweight. Yeah. That's the same guy
that Vander used. And they were doing,

1223
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:06,050
it was really interesting because at
the time the conventional wisdom was at

1224
01:12:06,391 --> 01:12:10,140
boxers should not lift weights and Avandia
was lifting all kinds of weights and

1225
01:12:10,141 --> 01:12:11,220
he put on all this muscle.

1226
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:15,900
But really he was only about 200
205 pounds when he first fought fog.

1227
01:12:15,901 --> 01:12:20,680
Heavy traps. Oh yeah. Jesus Christ.
He was built, it was built. It was PR.

1228
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:22,440
Perfect body.
Yeah.

1229
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,540
Yeah. Look at this. Ooh,
that's not steroids. Steroids,

1230
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,160
but not necessarily.

1231
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,730
Definitely can get that big without it.
I mean,

1232
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,810
there are guys alleged,
yeah, alleges a good word,

1233
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:38,390
but it's also possible to
get that big with steroids.

1234
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,200
But it's not just steroids too. It's
EPO. There's a look at that one up there.

1235
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,610
Yeah. But this is in the
night, eighties and nineties.

1236
01:12:44,611 --> 01:12:46,430
This is the good stuff wasn't available.
Well

1237
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:49,360
back then, was it? Oh yeah.
What are you kidding me, man?

1238
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,080
Those Russians had everything back then,
man. I mean, the eastern bloc women,

1239
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,920
they made world records.
That was when he was a, uh,

1240
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,250
that was when he was a cruiserweight.
Look how thin he was. Yeah.

1241
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,580
But you can't call them
women if they had mustaches.

1242
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:04,780
They penises fake beards and
fat dicks. They were, they were,

1243
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:07,870
they set records. That's still
to this day haven't been broken.

1244
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:10,900
And because they really were not women.

1245
01:13:10,901 --> 01:13:14,470
I mean there were women with massive
amounts of male hormones in their body.

1246
01:13:14,620 --> 01:13:17,400
Flo Jo. Yeah. She,

1247
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:22,180
she's I think still sets the record
right now for what, whatever it was.

1248
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:26,590
And she was also someone that was
accused of doing things. Yeah.

1249
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:30,870
I mean look, track and field according
to victor contact, um, who uh,

1250
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,940
was the balco guy. I had him on my
podcast. He was the guy that got um,

1251
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,250
the clear to Barry bonds and all
those castles undetected supposedly

1252
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:42,940
undetectable steroids. He said track
and field is just a dirty sport,

1253
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:46,540
just like Tour de France.
Like just like cycling.

1254
01:13:46,541 --> 01:13:48,400
He's like disappointed dirty sport.

1255
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:51,490
You got Carl Lewis trying to
call out Hussein bolt now, right?

1256
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,340
What are you showing us champions
at the top 100 meter times.

1257
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:57,070
All the names crossed
out. Oh Wow. Steroids.

1258
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:01,900
God Damn.
Well,

1259
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:05,680
that's like when a Lance Armstrong won
the Tour de France and they took his

1260
01:14:05,681 --> 01:14:06,514
title way.

1261
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,510
If you had to give that title to someone
who didn't test positive for anything,

1262
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:13,670
you had to back to 18th place.
Wow.

1263
01:14:14,930 --> 01:14:18,910
That was a dirty sport. You know, Bill
[inaudible] said it best. He's like,

1264
01:14:18,911 --> 01:14:22,390
yours are psycho was better than your
psycho. They were all, you were all dirty.

1265
01:14:22,391 --> 01:14:26,620
There's a dirty sport. He was just better
at doing that sport while being dirty.

1266
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:29,530
Yeah. If everybody's dirty,
then it's fair. Well, he,

1267
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,400
he won while everybody was
cheating and I mean, did he have,

1268
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:37,810
so is it still cheating if everybody's
doing it? It is and it isn't. I mean,

1269
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:41,860
it is definitely cheating, but
everybody's cheating. Yeah. It's weird.

1270
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:46,070
It's not good. See, you know, they
went off to the wrong thing. You know,

1271
01:14:46,090 --> 01:14:50,860
people were looking for drugs to help
them get stronger when it's natural food

1272
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:54,490
that makes you stronger, this is what
you put into your system. So, you know,

1273
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:59,800
I know what Jamaican food is great. You
know, yams, the plan, Tim's everything.

1274
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:04,000
Bill Umif, bully beef. You know what's
better than that? That's the steroids.

1275
01:15:04,510 --> 01:15:08,350
Steroids are way better.
They work instantly,

1276
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:12,670
but if you just stay on them like
guys like Lance Armstrong, I mean,

1277
01:15:12,671 --> 01:15:14,030
they proved it just you.

1278
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:18,580
You almost can't do toward the France
the way they were doing it without some

1279
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:22,300
sort of chemical help. And then I,
I've heard it argued by physiologists,

1280
01:15:22,301 --> 01:15:27,220
they say it's actually better for your
body to be on steroids while you're doing

1281
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:30,760
something like the Tour de France because
you give your body a chance to recover

1282
01:15:30,940 --> 01:15:35,940
because they're doing so much work over
the course of this race that without

1283
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:39,850
having some sort of chemical enhancement
of your ability to recover you,

1284
01:15:39,890 --> 01:15:43,120
you just not going to be able to do it.
Help your body can't do break down.

1285
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:47,380
You get that Rhabdo my locis that
those crossfit people get, you know,

1286
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:52,090
that's when your body starts breaking
down muscle tissue and it becomes toxic.

1287
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:54,490
Oh yeah, yeah. Pollutes your, we do that.

1288
01:15:54,970 --> 01:15:58,060
They work out so hard and
that people have died of it.

1289
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:02,900
Fighters have died from Rhabdo my locis.
Wow. It's a, it's from overtraining. You,

1290
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:06,400
you overtrain. You know like some, you
know, which is a big issue with fighters,

1291
01:16:06,401 --> 01:16:07,000
right?
Like they,

1292
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,530
some fighters can train too much and a
good trainer knows how to pull you back

1293
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:13,720
and so that you're peaking
when you get into the ring,

1294
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,270
but sometimes people
are so mentally strong,

1295
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,360
they push themselves through even when
they're exhausted because I think that's

1296
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:23,920
the way to victory. Hard
work. What's up Jamie? Yeah,

1297
01:16:23,921 --> 01:16:27,220
you're pissed comes out looking like
coke comes out looking like Coca Cola.

1298
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:31,380
That's what rhabdomyolysis piss
looks like. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. That's,

1299
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,420
that's a sign that your
body's breaking down.

1300
01:16:34,450 --> 01:16:38,720
Your muscle is all your, your proteins
in your body are breaking down in.

1301
01:16:38,730 --> 01:16:41,410
Your body's getting poisoned by it.
People die.

1302
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:45,040
A lot of crossfit people get it.
What is your kidneys?

1303
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:48,610
What are you doing this situation?
Do you take a rest,

1304
01:16:48,670 --> 01:16:52,690
a leave of absence or do you go see the
doctor and they can give you some pills

1305
01:16:52,691 --> 01:16:56,050
to put more things that
you need in your system?

1306
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,240
I think you have to go to the
doctor almost immediately.

1307
01:16:58,241 --> 01:17:01,900
I think they have to do pretty much
your body goes septic on you. Yeah,

1308
01:17:01,901 --> 01:17:05,740
it's very dangerous. And the, a lot
of these crossfit people, you know,

1309
01:17:05,741 --> 01:17:08,620
because it's a competition and you're
competing against all these other people

1310
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:11,100
and you're doing these massive
repetitions and some of them is,

1311
01:17:11,110 --> 01:17:13,550
I'm not really conditioned for
it yet. So their bodies, just,

1312
01:17:13,551 --> 01:17:18,020
the muscles not really acclimated to this
kind of workload and it's shit starts

1313
01:17:18,021 --> 01:17:22,300
breaking down. Wow. What do you
do these days? Like exercise?

1314
01:17:22,301 --> 01:17:25,940
Cause you still look great. Yeah. I ran
10 miles this morning. Wow. Yeah, man.

1315
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:29,540
What'd you go? Huh? You mean
them where I went on the road.

1316
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:34,490
But what'd you run on the beach. Oh,
okay. Woke up, took a shower. Nice.

1317
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,710
So you're still dead?
Yeah,

1318
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:38,820
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

1319
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:41,430
You guys don't even catch the joke.

1320
01:17:41,431 --> 01:17:45,130
I ran 10 miles and I woke up
and took a shower. Oh, okay.

1321
01:17:45,330 --> 01:17:48,800
Oh, I see. I said I that meeting. He's
supposed to know that, but listen, listen.

1322
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:53,070
All right. That's a bad first of all,
sit down. Tell him, tell him, you know,

1323
01:17:53,071 --> 01:17:57,070
he used to do this shit to me begging the
day I'd be at his house. And uh, and uh,

1324
01:17:57,071 --> 01:17:59,930
I was like, I'm in his basement ago.
It started to rain and go, listen,

1325
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:02,840
I've got to go outside and close
my sunroof. And he's like, no, no.

1326
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,980
Hold on a second. I'll tell you a
story. I got Lynn, let me just go close.

1327
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:09,120
My fucking son was like, hold on, let me
just tell you a story. And I'm like, dude,

1328
01:18:09,300 --> 01:18:10,220
it's raining.
I,

1329
01:18:10,221 --> 01:18:13,290
my sunroof was open or you're going to
pay for my fucking car to get fixed.

1330
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:17,180
He's like, hold on, Yo, there's this
guy, right? And I'm like, come on.

1331
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:20,130
I mean his fucking long story and it goes,

1332
01:18:20,131 --> 01:18:23,100
he's trying to get out this window on
that and I'm pulling his leg and I'm

1333
01:18:23,101 --> 01:18:24,930
pulling his leg and I go, oh, honey goes,

1334
01:18:24,931 --> 01:18:28,120
just the way I'm pulling your
leg right now. And I'm like, ah.

1335
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:32,410
Do you ever do yoga?
Yes. Guy, get into yoga.

1336
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:36,210
I actually hurt myself doing yoga so
much harder than it looks different,

1337
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:38,110
flexible. Like, if I stand up,

1338
01:18:38,350 --> 01:18:41,680
I can put them both my hands on the ground
like that. Wow. With my leg straight.

1339
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:45,160
But uh, somebody told
me, Oh, you know what?

1340
01:18:45,161 --> 01:18:49,060
You got to move your bum cheeks a little
back and that helps you get down a

1341
01:18:49,061 --> 01:18:52,170
little more. And I'm like, okay.
Cheeks a little black and hot.

1342
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:56,890
After a couple of days it's like,
you know, I'm walking around the fan,

1343
01:18:56,891 --> 01:19:00,940
I hurt myself and it goes yoga. Yeah.
Say Yo, I heard myself too. I'm like,

1344
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I didn't know you can hurt yourself in
yoga. You can hurt yourself in yoga. Yeah.

1345
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:06,490
My doctor told me a lot of
people come to him with injuries,

1346
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:07,660
back injuries from Yoga.

1347
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:11,170
What does that mentally saying that you
can do it when your body is saying you

1348
01:19:11,171 --> 01:19:15,430
can't or just doing something wrong.
Just doing something wrong.

1349
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:19,270
Especially if you do it too hard, too
quick. Like yoga is like anything else.

1350
01:19:19,271 --> 01:19:23,260
I mean, it's exercise. You definitely can
hurt yourself. Do you do the hot yogurt?

1351
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:27,310
Cold Yoga? I haven't tried the hot
one. Uh, I want to, but I do. I do.

1352
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:30,410
Koleos I like hot because a,
I think we're losing now.

1353
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:35,920
I it's also torturous. I liked
that aspect of it. And also they,

1354
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:39,070
there's a Harvard study that's going on
right now or they're trying to find out

1355
01:19:39,071 --> 01:19:42,460
if there's the same benefits that you
get from the sauna you get from doing hot

1356
01:19:42,461 --> 01:19:44,820
yoga. When your body gets
really overheated like that,

1357
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:49,821
it produces heat shock proteins and it
alleviates a lot of inflammation in the

1358
01:19:49,901 --> 01:19:54,530
body. Wow. That's why the sauna so
good for you because a you're dropping.

1359
01:19:54,810 --> 01:19:57,060
Yeah. Try Sauna. Your body gets,
you get in there, your body.

1360
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,600
It's like what the fuck is this?

1361
01:19:58,601 --> 01:20:03,010
And so it produces these sidechains he's
he chocked proteins and it's fantastic

1362
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:05,830
for people just for, oh my hands
don't hurt when I'm in the sauna.

1363
01:20:06,130 --> 01:20:09,000
You should get one in your house man. I
got one. I got a stone at all. It's nice,

1364
01:20:09,001 --> 01:20:12,350
right? Yeah. Every day, man. Dude,
you should be in there every day.

1365
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,360
Especially cause you're doing Jujitsu now,
you know after training.

1366
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:20,340
Fantastic for you. Really Tub with Epsom
salts. That's good too. That's good too.

1367
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:23,970
I don't think that works. Epson salt makes
it, it makes it feel good. Going to bed.

1368
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:25,243
Yeah.

1369
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:28,900
I go to sleep and you know, aroma therapy,
that type of thing. It smells good,

1370
01:20:29,510 --> 01:20:32,720
but it's not that. It's there's
magnesium in it. No Epsom salts.

1371
01:20:32,721 --> 01:20:35,630
Your body absorbs magnesium through your,
through your skin.

1372
01:20:35,990 --> 01:20:39,230
It's one of the best ways for your body
to get me magnesium is actually through

1373
01:20:39,231 --> 01:20:43,340
Epsom salts. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to take
more of that. Yeah. I have a float tank.

1374
01:20:43,410 --> 01:20:47,620
You ever do a float tank? Is that the cold
water one? No, no, no. That's uh, it's a,

1375
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:50,330
a tank of water that's
heated to 94 degrees,

1376
01:20:50,331 --> 01:20:53,360
which is like the surface of your skin
and there's a thousand pounds of Epsom

1377
01:20:53,361 --> 01:20:57,350
salts in there and you lay in it and
you float you like, like your body.

1378
01:20:57,351 --> 01:21:00,260
Half your body is above the water and
then he closed the door. Total silence,

1379
01:21:00,261 --> 01:21:03,590
total darkness. And it feels like you're
flying through space. It's beautiful.

1380
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,690
You would love it man.
Especially being the super,

1381
01:21:05,691 --> 01:21:09,590
tell me about this one for years. I got
one right here. I know anytime you want,

1382
01:21:09,591 --> 01:21:13,310
but it's the kind of growth,
somebody else's? No, no.
There's film. First of all,

1383
01:21:13,311 --> 01:21:15,750
it's only me. I'm the only one that
sits in it and I know how to say

1384
01:21:17,830 --> 01:21:20,480
this is a massive filtration system.

1385
01:21:20,510 --> 01:21:22,420
It's like this kind of
commercial filtration.

1386
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,530
I just drop in and by John
was going to go floating man.

1387
01:21:24,531 --> 01:21:29,000
Just just text me and I'll have Jeff
come by and open it up for you or do it

1388
01:21:29,001 --> 01:21:33,230
while we're doing the show. Yeah. Yeah.
You gotta be naked and they don't,

1389
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:37,310
don't have to worry about
of home. Be Floating. Yeah.

1390
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:41,960
That's the one I show you the whole
system and there's a ozone system that

1391
01:21:41,961 --> 01:21:45,320
purifies the water. It goes through
this commercial filtration system.

1392
01:21:45,530 --> 01:21:46,820
It's heavy duty stuff,
man.

1393
01:21:46,850 --> 01:21:50,140
It's pretty intense because they started
these flotation tank centers now. Yeah,

1394
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:54,170
they're everywhere. Yeah. You were talking
about this for the past 10 years more.

1395
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:58,400
I had one in 2002 I remember you telling
when I went to your house back in the

1396
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,680
day when you're doing that, when you
were doing this podcast out of the house.

1397
01:22:00,710 --> 01:22:05,600
Yeah. I had one in the basement. Yeah.
Yeah. What about the ice one? Oh,

1398
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:07,880
that's great. Yeah, cryotherapy is,

1399
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:10,130
this is a place down the street from
here about a couple of miles away.

1400
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:13,290
250 degrees below zero. I thought
you would have had one of those two.

1401
01:22:14,390 --> 01:22:17,030
That's like, you have to get
like nitrogen tanks and shit.

1402
01:22:17,031 --> 01:22:20,290
And I worry about that stuff exploding,
you know,

1403
01:22:20,510 --> 01:22:25,490
some shit going wrong and you getting
maimed, you know? Yup. So do you,

1404
01:22:25,491 --> 01:22:28,910
uh,
do you enjoy doing commentary to yeah.

1405
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,450
Um, I love, I love giving
my opinion. You know,

1406
01:22:32,451 --> 01:22:36,310
people will say I've got an unusual,
um,

1407
01:22:37,010 --> 01:22:41,150
opinions. They've never heard that
before. I never heard it put that way,

1408
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,930
so I can give you from a fight
five. His point of view, um,

1409
01:22:46,140 --> 01:22:47,810
have been in boxing for so long.

1410
01:22:47,811 --> 01:22:51,710
There's different experiences that I've
gone through, so I'm happy to share them.

1411
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:55,970
But you don't ever work out
boxing wise anymore. Yeah.

1412
01:22:56,190 --> 01:22:58,300
But you don't hit a hit a bag.
My son's 15

1413
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:03,320
then, and I know he wants to buck,
so anytime we get a chance, you know,

1414
01:23:03,321 --> 01:23:04,550
I'm always training him.

1415
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:05,593
How big he now

1416
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:09,730
six feet.
Jesus has told them the new Tyson son,

1417
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:11,890
Tyson son is 16 oh, Miguel. Yeah.

1418
01:23:11,950 --> 01:23:15,850
Tyson son was saying that he wants
a box to Tyson's. Like listen, no,

1419
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,080
Miguel was not built like that. But
he's also saying, listen you, you,

1420
01:23:19,081 --> 01:23:21,760
you grew up soft and you
know he's saying like,

1421
01:23:21,761 --> 01:23:26,720
you don't want to meet someone
like me. You know, like the
way he was. Yeah, I know.

1422
01:23:26,750 --> 01:23:29,890
Mike, do you want to meet
some? And I'm all like me.

1423
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:33,460
You know like when he was fighting like
he like he thinks of what he would have

1424
01:23:33,461 --> 01:23:36,010
done to his own son's like,
oh don't do that.

1425
01:23:36,230 --> 01:23:38,110
Like he was talking about it
on the podcast and his son,

1426
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:40,000
Miguel's are really talented kid.

1427
01:23:40,030 --> 01:23:44,500
Like musician wise can play like seven
different instruments in Spanish.

1428
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,430
Wow. The kid's really, and
he's a really smart, nice kid.

1429
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:53,700
Well Tyson is a smart guy. He's not
like he, I think people mistake tied.

1430
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:56,590
Some are big dummy. He's
very, very intelligent.

1431
01:23:56,620 --> 01:24:01,540
Well read the boxing is in
at least some levels of very,

1432
01:24:01,541 --> 01:24:03,550
very intellectual pursuit.
There's,

1433
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:07,180
you have to have a strong mind to
be able to dodge those punches,

1434
01:24:07,181 --> 01:24:09,550
get in and get yours in that you have to,

1435
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,030
you have to be able to sort out that
problem is a problem in front of you.

1436
01:24:13,210 --> 01:24:17,140
The problem is another man who's the
same way as you, the same size as you.

1437
01:24:17,141 --> 01:24:20,050
He's got gloves on just like you do and
he's trying to do what you're trying to

1438
01:24:20,051 --> 01:24:23,340
do to him. And you have to do that
within seconds. Yeah. Boom. Yeah.

1439
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:26,630
Punches thrown at you. What do you
do? What's, what's the rebuttal? Yeah.

1440
01:24:26,650 --> 01:24:27,461
People don't understand.

1441
01:24:27,461 --> 01:24:31,330
They think just because someone doesn't
have the best vocabulary or because they

1442
01:24:31,331 --> 01:24:31,871
don't have a,

1443
01:24:31,871 --> 01:24:36,730
a comprehensive education that they're
not intelligent and that's a big mistake.

1444
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,480
No. Twice Tyson's intelligent. Uh,

1445
01:24:39,481 --> 01:24:42,860
I remember going to the
Catskills when I was, uh,

1446
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:46,680
I won the world junior championships
in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

1447
01:24:47,190 --> 01:24:51,390
And I remember the American
team was saying, oh, well
you never fought the best.

1448
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:55,800
I'm like, I didn't fight
the best. I thought American
sent them best team. Yeah.

1449
01:24:55,801 --> 01:24:58,620
But one guy, he doesn't like
taking plans in this manager,

1450
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:01,470
don't like taking plans either.
So I'm like, who's that?

1451
01:25:02,040 --> 01:25:05,460
And they told me it was Mike Tyson
custom model. So me and my trainer,

1452
01:25:05,461 --> 01:25:10,380
we left Canada and we drove all the
way up there and while we were up there

1453
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:12,960
raise your brother was up
there and they said, oh,

1454
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:17,370
raising really came to inspire with
us. So okay, I'll start with the,

1455
01:25:17,371 --> 01:25:21,840
I'm here for four days.
So first time Tyson actually met me,

1456
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:25,770
you know, he was Nice Guy, really
nice guy, took me in his room,

1457
01:25:25,771 --> 01:25:29,850
showed me some old flicks that I've never
seen before of old time fighters would

1458
01:25:29,851 --> 01:25:34,650
tell me about each fighter, like he
studied them and then um, you know,

1459
01:25:34,651 --> 01:25:39,110
this is where he got his old star is
his style of fighting from. And uh,

1460
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:43,980
first day in the first day in the gym,
Bell went,

1461
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:47,490
he came across and he was trying
to kill me. Like, you know,

1462
01:25:47,491 --> 01:25:50,520
I did my Muhammad Ali thing
obviously stayed away from his power,

1463
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:54,930
but the first day was really hectic and
then the second day was a little hectic

1464
01:25:54,931 --> 01:25:59,700
and it got better as it went along in
the last day is I got actually the better

1465
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:03,240
of him the last day and I
remember custom models and Mike,

1466
01:26:03,860 --> 01:26:06,200
you're going to meet him some day,
don't you do that?

1467
01:26:06,620 --> 01:26:10,700
And that always echoed in my
mind that will we ever fight?

1468
01:26:10,701 --> 01:26:13,610
Will we have a fight? Cause custom
model said that we're going to fight.

1469
01:26:14,060 --> 01:26:17,840
Why did it happen? And there's
footage of it. Yeah. Wow.

1470
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:21,330
Lennox has the footage of it.
Footage of the training centers.

1471
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:24,660
Barring how old was Tyson at
the time? Tyson was like, uh,

1472
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:29,630
he was about 52. No, no. How old
was he at the time? Oh, at the time.

1473
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:34,030
15. Um, he was, he was younger
than me. I was on Sunday.

1474
01:26:34,550 --> 01:26:37,730
He's about 17. Wow. I was 18.

1475
01:26:38,050 --> 01:26:41,870
No, he was younger than
that. That must have been
[inaudible] 84 is before the, uh,

1476
01:26:41,970 --> 01:26:44,070
empire state games and everything.
Can you,

1477
01:26:44,071 --> 01:26:47,700
would you want up there before you went
to the 84 Olympics? Yeah. Yeah. Well,

1478
01:26:47,701 --> 01:26:49,900
it must have been crazy though,
knowing that, you know, you,

1479
01:26:49,901 --> 01:26:54,660
you guys were going to be a part of boxing
history and knowing that all the way

1480
01:26:54,661 --> 01:26:58,980
back then and being a teenager and
standing in front and here in custom model

1481
01:26:58,990 --> 01:26:59,850
scream that out.

1482
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,460
That must have been intense.

1483
01:27:02,610 --> 01:27:07,350
It was intense because custom
model wasn't that loud when he was,

1484
01:27:07,351 --> 01:27:11,040
when they, all of a sudden he became
loud. It was like everybody listened,

1485
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:13,410
you know, and then, you know,

1486
01:27:13,411 --> 01:27:15,690
there's certain ways that you would
get across to people and some,

1487
01:27:15,691 --> 01:27:17,400
some people take you
have to shout at them.

1488
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:20,770
Did you ever wish that you
fought him in his prime? Um,

1489
01:27:20,820 --> 01:27:24,960
in essence I did fight him in this
prime and you know, when you say prime,

1490
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:29,310
I was in my prime too. You know, it, you
will definitely in your prime. You were,

1491
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:34,020
you were, but I feel like his
enthusiasm had waned before then.

1492
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:38,460
You know, um, I, you know,
this is my perception,

1493
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:42,690
how I look at that whole thing is
Mike Tyson was an early bloomer.

1494
01:27:42,810 --> 01:27:47,520
I was a late bloomer. So, you know,
when, when both of us meet, you know,

1495
01:27:47,521 --> 01:27:51,330
there's never a perfect time. Perfect
time for us is when we meet in the middle.

1496
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:54,530
Right, right, right.
And, you know, if he won,

1497
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,170
maybe people would look at it differently.
Right.

1498
01:27:56,210 --> 01:27:59,810
It's because you beat them and beat them
so soundly that people look at it like

1499
01:27:59,820 --> 01:28:01,830
maybe his, his time had
already been gone. Yeah.

1500
01:28:01,831 --> 01:28:06,750
Lenox turned pro after Mike had already
had a defeat. Wow. No clubs turned prone.

1501
01:28:06,780 --> 01:28:11,530
89. Wow. I never even thought of
that. Mike lost in January of,

1502
01:28:12,230 --> 01:28:13,220
this is all stuff in.

1503
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:19,880
Okay. Kevin Rooney. Wow.
That is crazy, man. God,

1504
01:28:19,881 --> 01:28:24,140
that's crazy. Go back then too.
We had a big neck. Yeah. He, well,

1505
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:28,470
he was always doing those neck bridges,
but he also just had freak genetics.

1506
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:33,420
I mean, just phenomenal genetic
specimen, you know. Uh, I had, um, uh,

1507
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:37,080
Teddy Atlas in here and Teddy House used
to take Mike to the smokers when he was

1508
01:28:37,081 --> 01:28:39,720
13. And he, teddy was joking
around about it. I said,

1509
01:28:39,721 --> 01:28:41,700
everybody always lied
about how old people were.

1510
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:44,370
They would tell you the kid was 16,
when really it was 20.

1511
01:28:44,371 --> 01:28:48,210
They always did that and he said, uh, he
goes, uh, so, uh, how old is this kid?

1512
01:28:48,211 --> 01:28:51,000
He was 13. He goes, what does he
weigh? He goes, 190 pounds. It's like,

1513
01:28:51,001 --> 01:28:55,110
what the Fuck Teddy? Come on. He's
like, I'm telling Ya, he's sick.

1514
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:59,490
He's fucking 13. What do you want? So,

1515
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:03,030
you know, nobody would believe because he
was such a specimen. I watched that one.

1516
01:29:03,740 --> 01:29:06,630
Teddy was great man. Do you think
he should have stayed with teddy?

1517
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,970
Should it stay with Kevin and Teddy?
Well, he definitely, how, you know,

1518
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,420
he was so wild. Like how, how could
you tell him what to do back then?

1519
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:19,200
That was part of the problem. I mean,
he was never, no one ever prepared him.

1520
01:29:19,201 --> 01:29:22,230
And this is one of the things that we
discussed on the podcast was that he was a

1521
01:29:22,231 --> 01:29:25,110
12 year old, 13 year old boy
and he was getting hypnotized.

1522
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:28,680
He had came from a terrible
background. It was, there was no love,

1523
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:32,700
he was abandoned and all of a sudden
he's getting love and attention for

1524
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:35,850
something. And this one thing
was this man who was telling him,

1525
01:29:35,851 --> 01:29:38,940
you're going to be a great fighter,
you're going to be a world champion.

1526
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:42,990
And he would hypnotize me saying,
you don't exist. The task exists.

1527
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,960
You know you're going to work
the body and destroy this man.

1528
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:49,470
And he would tell he would
put these thoughts in his
head and Mike couldn't wait

1529
01:29:49,471 --> 01:29:52,500
to just get out there and fuck people up.
Cause that's where he got the love.

1530
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,930
That's where he got the attention from.
But he never turned,

1531
01:29:54,990 --> 01:29:57,390
never told them how to shut it off.
He never,

1532
01:29:57,480 --> 01:29:59,210
I mean he didn't have time to
work with him cause he was,

1533
01:29:59,310 --> 01:30:01,860
he was on his way out and he
was dying when he met Mike.

1534
01:30:02,310 --> 01:30:06,270
And so he only taught them how to destroy.
He never taught them how to cope.

1535
01:30:06,620 --> 01:30:09,870
He never taught them how to understand
that there's going to be a lot of shit

1536
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:12,630
coming your way and you've got to know
what that is and don't get caught up in

1537
01:30:12,631 --> 01:30:16,380
that hype train. Don't just don't get
wrapped up in Hollywood. And you know,

1538
01:30:16,381 --> 01:30:19,080
he wound up marrying robbin
Gibbons and you know, all,

1539
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:21,860
I don't think cus foresaw
all that other bullshit. No.

1540
01:30:21,930 --> 01:30:25,650
How could he of course was the run.
Mike would be totally different.

1541
01:30:25,651 --> 01:30:28,680
He would have been a different man
if costs lasted another 15 years.

1542
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:31,800
Even if Jimmy Jacobs had lasted
another five years, maybe. Yeah,

1543
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:32,940
maybe that would have helped.

1544
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:35,610
But I mean it's like once
you're once removed from cus,

1545
01:30:36,090 --> 01:30:38,740
it's like Kevin Rooney was
once removed from cuss. Right.

1546
01:30:38,790 --> 01:30:42,660
And then Teddy Atlas was way more of
a hard liner, you know, Teddy Atlas,

1547
01:30:42,661 --> 01:30:44,670
you couldn't put any bullshit with,
you know,

1548
01:30:44,671 --> 01:30:46,760
and like those other guys are
just got to go, ah, you know,

1549
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:50,430
when he got to Aaron snowball and all
those guys was with them rich and Ghia

1550
01:30:50,430 --> 01:30:52,980
Ketty they just didn't, they, they didn't,

1551
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:56,280
they could've never brought
Mike to the dance. Right.

1552
01:30:56,281 --> 01:30:58,800
They got there when he was already at
the dance and they just trying to like

1553
01:30:58,801 --> 01:31:02,510
maintain things and he's not
listening to anybody. Mike Tyson,

1554
01:31:02,511 --> 01:31:05,010
they also weren't boxing people
as far as I was concerned

1555
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:10,220
when he was up with costs use.
It was in a good situation.

1556
01:31:10,430 --> 01:31:13,400
You know, there was a lady in
the house cooking meals. Uh,

1557
01:31:13,590 --> 01:31:17,270
they had custody of being a father figure,
talk to him every day.

1558
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:20,470
And that's what young kids
need. They need that, you know,

1559
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:25,100
to be spoken with by older
people. Yeah. And you know,

1560
01:31:25,101 --> 01:31:28,280
a lot of young people nowadays are not
even respect him, the older people,

1561
01:31:28,281 --> 01:31:31,490
but they can get in a lot of information
from an older person. You know,

1562
01:31:31,491 --> 01:31:33,760
how do you deal with this
situation? Well, you know,

1563
01:31:33,761 --> 01:31:36,620
you hear from an older person that kind
of makes your mind thinking and said,

1564
01:31:36,621 --> 01:31:38,450
you know, you're right. It works for them.

1565
01:31:38,451 --> 01:31:41,800
So anytime I get a chance to
talk to kids about, you know,

1566
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:44,780
their life and where they're going,
or it's take that opportunity.

1567
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:49,490
Well, you're such a great example of
a guy who has done incredible things,

1568
01:31:49,790 --> 01:31:54,620
but you've come out on the other end with,
with wisdom and lessons and honesty,

1569
01:31:54,650 --> 01:31:58,190
and you can talk about things and
people will listen to you in a way that,

1570
01:31:58,191 --> 01:32:00,170
you know, a lot of kids don't
want to listen to someone.

1571
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:04,090
We ain't done shit. Right? And he talked
to some guy who's just some boring dude.

1572
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:06,340
Do you want to give you advice?
Like, Hey, fuck face. I look,

1573
01:32:06,580 --> 01:32:10,120
get your own shit together. Tell me
what to do, bitch. But what do you,

1574
01:32:10,130 --> 01:32:12,730
Lennox Lewis, he talked
together go, oh, okay.

1575
01:32:12,980 --> 01:32:16,420
Mr Chess master world
heavyweight champion,

1576
01:32:16,700 --> 01:32:21,000
and he was in Jamaica. Now you got
a box in school then Lennox Lewis,

1577
01:32:21,010 --> 01:32:25,450
League of champions. Woo. Yeah.
It's for young kids that, you know,

1578
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,880
learning how to box teach.

1579
01:32:27,881 --> 01:32:30,670
We teach them on the box and we'll
teach them life skills as well.

1580
01:32:30,700 --> 01:32:33,790
Because what we realized that, you know,
a lot of the kids just want to talk,

1581
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:36,970
you know, there's nobody around them
to talk. Nobody listens to them.

1582
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:41,200
And when they hear all the kids' stories,
they feel a lot better. It's like, Yo,

1583
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:44,140
you know, I was going through that and
I liked how he dealt with it. You know,

1584
01:32:44,141 --> 01:32:47,740
it's like, yes, this is what,
what's missing nowadays,

1585
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:52,910
the relationship with kids, you know, uh,
talking to them, just ask them out there,

1586
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:56,640
I have some board, they're
doing what do they want to
be. Right, right, right. Yeah.

1587
01:32:56,680 --> 01:33:00,670
And then have some place where they can
go in and have something that gives them

1588
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:05,270
a sense of value, you know? And that's
what a lot of sports does, di do,

1589
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:07,670
di to children gives them, you know, you,

1590
01:33:07,671 --> 01:33:11,590
you realize if you work hard and you try
something and you study it and you get

1591
01:33:11,591 --> 01:33:13,930
better at it, you feel good.
Like you accomplished it.

1592
01:33:13,931 --> 01:33:15,670
You got through whatever the sport is.
A lot of,

1593
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:19,630
a lot of the kids that come boxing,
um, I've never tried it before,

1594
01:33:19,631 --> 01:33:23,200
but once they try it, it's like wow.
They learn new things about themselves.

1595
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:28,150
Even the training of boxing, you
know, the fact of us run a mile,

1596
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:32,770
they never ran in their life. Now they've
run half a mile, didn't make the mile,

1597
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:36,370
but the next day, next day they want
to try them out. And then he just,

1598
01:33:36,570 --> 01:33:39,550
it shows them that if you keep working
at something, you'll accomplish it.

1599
01:33:40,150 --> 01:33:43,870
You know, don't give up. Don't over
sudden you tried it and it's like, hi. No,

1600
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,480
it's not for me. Keep
trying it. You don't know.

1601
01:33:46,481 --> 01:33:50,030
It's not for you until you keep trying
it and then realize it's not for you or

1602
01:33:50,060 --> 01:33:54,580
for you. What are you gonna do if
your son wants to fight? Let him,

1603
01:33:55,780 --> 01:33:59,920
yeah. I think your perspective would be
very different than Mike's. Yeah. From,

1604
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:03,550
from me. You know, I'm not
forcing my son two bucks,

1605
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:07,960
but if he wants to try it,
let him try. His father used
to box, so why not? Why not?

1606
01:34:07,961 --> 01:34:12,110
Try something his father did, maybe has
the gene for it. You know, right now my,

1607
01:34:12,200 --> 01:34:16,870
my play plays basketball. He wants
to be an actor. He loves boxing.

1608
01:34:16,970 --> 01:34:18,730
They couldn't do anything he wants,
you know,

1609
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:23,710
all my kids are talented and I see the
drive in them that I have and their

1610
01:34:23,711 --> 01:34:27,330
mother has. So I know that they're going
to be successful. You know, they've,

1611
01:34:27,790 --> 01:34:28,990
they're,
they're basically,

1612
01:34:28,991 --> 01:34:32,890
I'm trying to help them to
become successful in the
future and giving them the

1613
01:34:32,891 --> 01:34:36,730
tools to become successful in the
future as well. Good for you, man.

1614
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:41,530
Lucky young man. I mean, you know,
and young women too. Yeah. Well,

1615
01:34:41,531 --> 01:34:44,060
but a great situation to be your son,
you know what I mean?

1616
01:34:44,190 --> 01:34:47,410
And your daughters as well, but for
sure. But I mean to be your son,

1617
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:51,950
if you really do have a desire to box,
would you start training them? I'm trying.

1618
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:57,380
Oh Shit.
I'm saying saying

1619
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,270
it's like, you know, um, you know,

1620
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:04,060
I was talking to George Foreman
the other day and his dot.

1621
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:06,800
One of his daughters were fighting
number in her name. George.

1622
01:35:07,730 --> 01:35:10,520
She's Georgina or something.
Right? Some crazy shit.

1623
01:35:10,550 --> 01:35:15,170
He's got like eight Georges in his house.
I said, and I'm watching her finals,

1624
01:35:15,171 --> 01:35:20,171
but they know by the tone apparently
which one it is in fluxion on the Jew.

1625
01:35:20,810 --> 01:35:25,130
I'm watching her fight and I'm like,
George, you need to tell us some stuff.

1626
01:35:25,190 --> 01:35:28,250
I know there's some good things you
can tell her or even get her a proper

1627
01:35:28,251 --> 01:35:32,840
culture or you know, help her.
I don't want her to fight. Wow.

1628
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:36,560
Solely at to say, yeah, but if you don't
want her to fight and she's fighting,

1629
01:35:37,230 --> 01:35:39,830
you're not going to help her. She's
going to get hurt. So you might as well.

1630
01:35:39,831 --> 01:35:44,690
I think she stopped already. Anyway.
My approach to raising kids is I don't,

1631
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:49,030
I don't have any input under
what they do. I want, I don't,

1632
01:35:49,150 --> 01:35:53,180
it would never tell my kid, I don't want
you to do that cause it's not my life.

1633
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:56,330
It's their life.
I give them guidance if I can,

1634
01:35:56,331 --> 01:35:59,000
I'll talk to them about what
they're doing, if I can,

1635
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:01,490
but they also have to go
out and do it themselves.

1636
01:36:02,330 --> 01:36:05,630
I really firmly believe in that.
Like you gotta go do it yourself.

1637
01:36:05,720 --> 01:36:08,480
But if you want to do it,
that's your thing.

1638
01:36:08,570 --> 01:36:12,350
I tried to convince my daughter to want
to do Jujitsu. I really, I do. I said,

1639
01:36:12,351 --> 01:36:14,780
sweetheart, I'll get you a
pink gee, if you my teeth.

1640
01:36:14,781 --> 01:36:16,400
My kids were doing
martial arts for a while.

1641
01:36:16,401 --> 01:36:20,360
My middle daughter was doing Jujitsu
and my youngest daughter was doing MMA,

1642
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:23,450
but she got bored with it after a
while, which was cool too. You know,

1643
01:36:23,451 --> 01:36:26,090
like a 10 and eight. You know, who
knows. Maybe they'll come back to it,

1644
01:36:26,091 --> 01:36:29,140
but you know, I kind of
whispered it to my son right now.

1645
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:34,160
You need to do some wrestling,
get them in Jujitsu.

1646
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:37,480
I'm telling you, just thank
you. Should fight MMA. Uh,

1647
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:42,470
you know, I don't know what the future
holds. He may fight MMA. He's kind of,

1648
01:36:42,471 --> 01:36:44,570
he doesn't, if he's going
to fight a shoebox, why?

1649
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:48,740
Just because of the money factor. Yeah.
You know what I mean? Honestly, I mean,

1650
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:50,900
if you're a heavy weight,
you know,

1651
01:36:50,901 --> 01:36:53,410
if you're a heavyweight and
make a lot of money, yeah,

1652
01:36:53,420 --> 01:36:56,680
we sure certainly will basically give
you a Lennox, his brother Dennis,

1653
01:36:56,750 --> 01:36:57,690
they're nothing alike.

1654
01:36:57,740 --> 01:37:02,570
Lennox is bones mean goddamn butter heavy,

1655
01:37:02,660 --> 01:37:06,550
like a child holding a fist that pretty
big fists, but yours are gigantic.

1656
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:10,070
Then you know, huge, huge human being.

1657
01:37:10,430 --> 01:37:13,430
You know your kid's going to be a
heavyweight. Oh, he's going to be a heavy,

1658
01:37:13,431 --> 01:37:14,264
he's already,

1659
01:37:14,810 --> 01:37:18,440
he's six foot and he wears size 15 shoes.

1660
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,290
He doesn't need to fight. Just keep
a pair of, of shoes by the front end.

1661
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:28,160
So I think he's, he's to outgrow
me. That's like a puppy. Yeah. Yeah.

1662
01:37:28,161 --> 01:37:32,210
He's always going to be enormous. A great
day. Why do kids outgrow the parents?

1663
01:37:32,270 --> 01:37:35,230
I don't know. I think it's food. I think
they get better food than us. Yeah.

1664
01:37:35,330 --> 01:37:38,630
I think you know, you think about like
how much protein children have now,

1665
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:42,320
if you ever go back and look at how
big men were during like the civil war

1666
01:37:42,321 --> 01:37:44,300
period,
there were tiny like a hundred pounds.

1667
01:37:44,510 --> 01:37:46,760
There are tiny little people
because nobody had good food.

1668
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:49,160
Like everybody was like barely surviving.

1669
01:37:49,190 --> 01:37:51,230
Everyone's scrape those
divers bread and water times.

1670
01:37:51,650 --> 01:37:54,410
The people that made it across the West.
You ever see photos? A little folks.

1671
01:37:54,770 --> 01:37:55,351
It was skinny,

1672
01:37:55,351 --> 01:37:58,860
rickety looking people just tougher and
tougher than we could ever be. Oh my God.

1673
01:37:58,861 --> 01:38:02,640
They were a little wolves. They're up
in the early in the morning working.

1674
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:07,300
They had to survive. Yeah. It's just,
but now today kids are getting, you know,

1675
01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:11,290
massive amounts of protein and they get
vitamins and vegetables and you know,

1676
01:38:11,400 --> 01:38:16,320
drinking all this milk and food's
got shit. Oh yeah, there's that too.

1677
01:38:16,350 --> 01:38:20,130
There's that too, but I just think it's
just an abundance of nutrition. I mean,

1678
01:38:20,131 --> 01:38:23,640
when people were smaller,
a lot of it was because of malnutrition.

1679
01:38:23,820 --> 01:38:27,990
Like look at a Asian folks. Like a lot of
Japanese folks used to be much smaller.

1680
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:32,100
Now they're pretty fucking big. You're
getting some really big Japanese fighters.

1681
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:36,000
Like they're larger because they're huge.
They're eating better. You know what?

1682
01:38:36,001 --> 01:38:40,230
I wanted to ask you please. Conspiracy
theories. I know you have some. Yeah,

1683
01:38:40,231 --> 01:38:43,740
I got something I thought I was listening
to you about was something about

1684
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:46,650
Martians the other day that was
a positive challenge. Jones,

1685
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:51,510
Alex and I saw an amazing NASA shirt I
was going to buy for Eddie the other day.

1686
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:55,490
Yeah. Alex wore a NASA churches
to for watch the, yeah. Yeah.

1687
01:38:55,780 --> 01:38:58,170
I believe she had that.
Even Alex thinks is ridiculous.

1688
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:02,220
Like what quits conspiracy theories do
you want to know about it? No, I'm like,

1689
01:39:02,221 --> 01:39:06,120
let me hear some, well, I, I believe
less than, less than I ever used to.

1690
01:39:06,150 --> 01:39:09,870
Population control. Do you believe
that? No, I don't believe that.

1691
01:39:09,871 --> 01:39:12,180
I don't believe there's
any concerted effort. Um,

1692
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:17,070
like where there's a bunch of really rich
people that have decided to euthanize

1693
01:39:17,071 --> 01:39:20,460
a bunch of people to keep the
population low. I think that is,

1694
01:39:20,970 --> 01:39:25,710
that's paranoid. I think that
there's probably some people that go,

1695
01:39:25,711 --> 01:39:28,650
you know what? We would be a lot
healthier if there was less people,

1696
01:39:28,651 --> 01:39:31,530
but there's no,
there's no obvious effort.

1697
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,820
The population keeps fucking growing.
Imagine if you are the all powerful,

1698
01:39:35,821 --> 01:39:38,730
all knowing people that were running
the world and you're doing such a shitty

1699
01:39:38,731 --> 01:39:40,280
job of population control.
Yeah.

1700
01:39:40,290 --> 01:39:42,740
I don't know how you're going to
control the India and China. You're not,

1701
01:39:42,980 --> 01:39:43,900
you're not.
You're not.

1702
01:39:43,990 --> 01:39:46,500
You're not going to be in these fucking
dirty villages and trying to stop being

1703
01:39:46,501 --> 01:39:48,600
not doing it anywhere.
And even in this country,

1704
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:52,980
people are fucking like wild animals and
just coming next month I got three kids.

1705
01:39:52,981 --> 01:39:56,350
Yeah, like look, it's just the way
it is. Mad People like to fuck you.

1706
01:39:56,351 --> 01:39:59,160
Like to make people in China.
You're only allowed one kid. No,

1707
01:39:59,161 --> 01:40:00,750
I think they lifted that.
They've left, lifted,

1708
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:04,280
lifted that because a lot of people were
drowning their daughters. They were,

1709
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:07,590
there was horrible shit. You're
killing, I mean there's the,

1710
01:40:08,130 --> 01:40:11,070
this is the rumor was that people were,

1711
01:40:11,071 --> 01:40:13,810
they wanted a son and if they had
a daughter they would, you know,

1712
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:16,320
the daughter was like the law,
the law, the lose for you.

1713
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:20,040
And to me a daughter is a win because
there's so much easier to deal with.

1714
01:40:20,430 --> 01:40:25,140
Really. I find with my daughter and we're,
we're like this. Yeah. You know what man?

1715
01:40:25,141 --> 01:40:28,080
I mean, just be happy. I've got
a guy come, a boy coming next.

1716
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:33,270
You got to have a little Joseph Lennox
Lewis. Peter's come in next month.

1717
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:38,100
I'm Joseph Lennox Rogan Peters.
He's going to be amazing.

1718
01:40:38,101 --> 01:40:40,610
I'm so happy that you gave him
my name. Yeah, that's beautiful.

1719
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,360
Keeping that first is going
to give me a middle name,

1720
01:40:42,361 --> 01:40:45,990
but I didn't want to do that to him.
So what's your middle name? Whoa. Yes.

1721
01:40:46,170 --> 01:40:50,610
My middle name is Claudius. Claudius.
It sounds like a Roman emperor.

1722
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,740
Absolutely
beautiful.

1723
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:54,311
Hey Man,

1724
01:40:54,311 --> 01:40:56,860
I know you're supposed to get out of here
at two o'clock do you have a hard out?

1725
01:40:57,100 --> 01:41:01,350
No, no, you can stay. Yeah, absolutely.
Beautiful. Let's keep talking. Yeah.

1726
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:04,210
Yeah. So back to your
question, I don't, yeah,

1727
01:41:04,211 --> 01:41:07,870
I think there's definitely some people
that are influencing the way the world

1728
01:41:07,871 --> 01:41:08,800
works for sure.

1729
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:13,650
But I don't think there's anybody that's
really trying to control population or

1730
01:41:14,310 --> 01:41:15,490
what about this one?
Okay.

1731
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:20,520
Do you think the Russians put Donald
Trump in the president's chair?

1732
01:41:20,710 --> 01:41:24,790
I think the Russians absolutely want
to. Donald Trump to win. Absolutely.

1733
01:41:24,820 --> 01:41:29,820
And I think they definitely undermined
our democracy through various methods of

1734
01:41:30,161 --> 01:41:32,650
manipulating people through social media.
In fact,

1735
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:35,830
I have a woman coming on very soon.
When is Renee [inaudible]? This week.

1736
01:41:36,100 --> 01:41:40,480
Next week. And she's on next week and
she actually studied it and wrote,

1737
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:42,750
wrote this very
comprehensive report about,

1738
01:41:42,751 --> 01:41:47,751
it was on Sam Harris' podcast and detailed
millions of interactions with Russian

1739
01:41:48,731 --> 01:41:53,650
bots and Russian fake accounts and that
these troll farms that we create memes.

1740
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:56,170
And they did,
they did a bunch of different things.

1741
01:41:56,350 --> 01:41:58,750
They didn't just try to pump Trump up,

1742
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:02,060
but they also tried to get
people against each other and,

1743
01:42:02,061 --> 01:42:04,840
and cause all sorts of civil,
uh,

1744
01:42:04,841 --> 01:42:08,050
arguments and all sorts of a armrest.
Yeah.

1745
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:11,860
All sorts of unrest online.
They organize these, um,

1746
01:42:11,890 --> 01:42:16,750
meetings like they organize one pro Texas
meeting across the street from a pro

1747
01:42:16,751 --> 01:42:17,650
Muslim meeting.

1748
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:21,160
I did it on prime all through Facebook
to get these people to fight with each

1749
01:42:21,161 --> 01:42:21,970
other.

1750
01:42:21,970 --> 01:42:26,170
They're doing these things to try to get
people to take sides and to get people

1751
01:42:26,171 --> 01:42:30,490
to be angry at the other side. They did
a lot of shit like that. Real sneaky,

1752
01:42:30,491 --> 01:42:34,660
sneaky stuff that we probably do
in foreign countries all the time.

1753
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:35,531
And you know,

1754
01:42:35,531 --> 01:42:38,110
we're mad that they're doing it to us
because now they're doing it through

1755
01:42:38,111 --> 01:42:38,490
social [inaudible].

1756
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:41,520
Well, if you think about when we were
growing up in the eighties seventies and

1757
01:42:41,521 --> 01:42:43,370
eighties all the imagery we saw,

1758
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,440
the USSR was very dark and gray and it
was very barren and it was destitute and

1759
01:42:49,721 --> 01:42:51,350
well some of it was true though.
Yeah.

1760
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:55,010
We saw and then all of a sudden that
lifts and these hot fucking Russian chicks

1761
01:42:55,011 --> 01:42:56,940
show up and like what were
these bitches the whole time?

1762
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,790
Where was she in the propaganda? So
true. You never saw the hot Russian lady,

1763
01:43:04,330 --> 01:43:05,910
some of the hottest women on the plan.

1764
01:43:05,940 --> 01:43:09,510
They used to show us these big manly women
will do one and now you're like Whoa,

1765
01:43:09,680 --> 01:43:13,620
whoa, hey Lou. Yeah.

1766
01:43:13,980 --> 01:43:16,950
Yeah I have two friends in are married
to a Russian ladies. They're very happy.

1767
01:43:18,110 --> 01:43:21,810
No the question cause cause you were
American. Everything. I'm not American.

1768
01:43:21,811 --> 01:43:25,860
So is this wall ever going to get built
towards that? What's the situation?

1769
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:32,280
I think it was more of a campaign
rhetoric thing. You know,

1770
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:35,400
build that wall, build that wall.
He's kind of staying with it.

1771
01:43:35,820 --> 01:43:39,840
He wants to Porter's, I think he's
got a kind of do something right.

1772
01:43:39,841 --> 01:43:42,630
Once you say that you're gonna build a
wall, you got to kind of do something,

1773
01:43:42,870 --> 01:43:46,020
but they ain't shit been built and
we're two years into the president.

1774
01:43:46,021 --> 01:43:46,890
They haven't built shit.

1775
01:43:46,980 --> 01:43:50,550
I was a year left in the year and a half
left in the presbytery has some wall.

1776
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:51,800
There's some wall that's up,

1777
01:43:51,801 --> 01:43:55,970
but there's also some big as gaps and
the idea that they're going to stop drugs

1778
01:43:55,971 --> 01:43:57,190
from coming over from that wall.

1779
01:43:57,550 --> 01:44:02,100
Now the wall looks like Leon Spinks
his mouth. I don't have a badge.

1780
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:06,120
I forgot about Leon's spanx.
I remember my

1781
01:44:06,220 --> 01:44:07,480
parents were hippies,
right?

1782
01:44:07,780 --> 01:44:11,890
But when Muhammad Ali lost to Leon
spanx and then there was a rematch,

1783
01:44:11,891 --> 01:44:16,510
we watched it on television.
Everybody, everybody wanted Ali to,

1784
01:44:16,511 --> 01:44:21,511
when people forget that Ali wasn't just
a great boxer and the heavyweight champ

1785
01:44:21,981 --> 01:44:25,750
of the world, he represented
people that were against the war.

1786
01:44:26,170 --> 01:44:30,520
He represented people that
were against all of the,

1787
01:44:30,760 --> 01:44:35,760
all of the discrimination and all the
racism that people experienced in the 50s

1788
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:40,090
and the 60s he was a different
thing. He was. He represented that,

1789
01:44:40,091 --> 01:44:43,960
the hope of this new generation,
that this athlete would take a stand.

1790
01:44:44,140 --> 01:44:47,530
And he said that no Vietcong ever did
anything to me and I'm not going over

1791
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:48,370
there and fighting anybody.

1792
01:44:48,371 --> 01:44:52,270
And they took away his ability to earn a
living for three fucking years primary.

1793
01:44:52,290 --> 01:44:55,900
And he was a hero, a real social.
He could've, he got to given in,

1794
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:59,030
he could have given and he could've got
a cushy job like Elvis or some shit,

1795
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:01,140
you know, and they would have had
them go over there and you know,

1796
01:45:01,150 --> 01:45:04,870
just just to make it look like he
was doing something. He's like, no,

1797
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:07,440
no fucking chance. You know,
he stood up for it and my,

1798
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:11,590
my parents were hippies wanted,
wanted to him to win. I mean, my,

1799
01:45:11,591 --> 01:45:15,280
my mom didn't give a fuck about boxing,
but when I was,

1800
01:45:15,281 --> 01:45:19,180
when I was a little kid, I remember
watching us on TV thinking, this is crazy.

1801
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:23,170
My parents want to watch a boxing
match because what he stands for,

1802
01:45:25,340 --> 01:45:28,720
my dad felt that way about
Joe Louis Robinson. Well,

1803
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,600
when Joe Lewis beat Max Schmeling oh,
he didn't match. Very similar thing.

1804
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:35,930
He was beating Max Schmeling for
the world, like it wasn't, I mean,

1805
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:38,510
I feel terrible for Max
Schmeling because I mean,

1806
01:45:38,511 --> 01:45:40,250
he was probably just
caught up in all that shit,

1807
01:45:40,610 --> 01:45:42,770
but Max even said he wasn't part of it.
He was just,

1808
01:45:42,980 --> 01:45:47,870
he was just a pawn in the game.
Yeah, I'm sure. Yeah, I'm sure.

1809
01:45:47,871 --> 01:45:50,030
But what about Jack Johnson?
That's my favorite.

1810
01:45:50,031 --> 01:45:53,450
That's the craziest in Lennox
Lewis. Jake Johnson, my favorite.

1811
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:57,220
That's the craziest of all stories, right?
It was managing and he was incredible.

1812
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:01,730
I must've experienced in the shit he
said back then. He would slick talk.

1813
01:46:01,731 --> 01:46:05,270
You bad. My favorite one, there's
a meme, a photo of him in his car.

1814
01:46:05,810 --> 01:46:09,960
I don't even know if the story's
true. I don't know. Change.

1815
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:11,650
I'm coming back tonight. Same speed. Yeah.

1816
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:15,590
He got pulled over going 50 he had
to give the guy $50 that was the fee.

1817
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:17,030
Gave the guy a hundred he goes,
what's this for?

1818
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:19,610
Is I'm going to come back
later that night. Same speed.

1819
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:24,680
Then there's the story of him getting
in a taxi and get in the backseat of a

1820
01:46:24,681 --> 01:46:29,320
taxi and the guy goes, I don't
drive. Niger's. And um, and he,

1821
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:31,460
and he reached over,
pulled the gun to the back seat,

1822
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:34,640
got in the front and drove himself to her.
He had the guts and the guy's like,

1823
01:46:34,641 --> 01:46:38,030
where's my fair? Cause I drove myself
and he got out. I wonder if that's true.

1824
01:46:38,390 --> 01:46:40,370
You know, he could just
roll in his book. You know,

1825
01:46:40,371 --> 01:46:43,790
he wrestled this video of
Jack Johnson wrestling.

1826
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:48,560
He had like a 13 inch wrist. Here's
a gigantic human being for the time,

1827
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:51,860
but I think he was only six
too, you know. Yeah. But it was,

1828
01:46:51,870 --> 01:46:55,650
they called him the Galveston
giant. Yeah. And people,

1829
01:46:55,710 --> 01:47:00,090
a Gq magazine rated him as best
dressed athlete of the century in 2000,

1830
01:47:01,170 --> 01:47:06,090
um, just wrong century. Uh, well, uh,
you know, the 20th century hundreds.

1831
01:47:06,150 --> 01:47:10,500
Oh, right. Get it. Oh yeah.
In 2000 they did it. Yeah.

1832
01:47:10,501 --> 01:47:14,040
The whole 20th century. Backtrack.
Yeah. Well, you know, I mean,

1833
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:18,420
I don't think any of us could even imagine
what it must have been like when he

1834
01:47:18,421 --> 01:47:22,260
won the title and the kind of hate that
he got all the people that wanted him to

1835
01:47:22,261 --> 01:47:24,990
be killed. The shit he did
was so gangster. Oh yeah.

1836
01:47:25,020 --> 01:47:28,770
He would hit you and see your knees
buckling hold you up and say he would say

1837
01:47:28,771 --> 01:47:31,440
things to the guy's not
yet, sir. Not yet. Not yet.

1838
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:32,790
You're going gonna have
a longer night than this.

1839
01:47:33,330 --> 01:47:37,290
He would just torture these guys,
this guy and those boxes.

1840
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:39,980
Did you ever see his fight with
Stanley Catcho? Yeah. Yeah.

1841
01:47:40,020 --> 01:47:44,950
The boilermaker Stanley Ketchel dropped
him yet it was supposed to be, uh,

1842
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,360
uh, exhibition, an exhibition.
Mountain stand. The catcher
was a middleweight, right?

1843
01:47:48,361 --> 01:47:52,890
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And then
his teeth got stuck in his glove.

1844
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:55,290
He smashed him. Wow. Yeah.

1845
01:47:55,820 --> 01:47:59,350
He had a fascinating style when
they had those little gloves. Well,

1846
01:47:59,380 --> 01:48:02,730
you guys don't realize that was going
to say the little gloves horsehair

1847
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:08,030
different worlds closer.
A hard your fucking hands real easy too,

1848
01:48:08,150 --> 01:48:11,940
but they heard more. I'm going
to add, added that. Yeah.
It hurts. Well, it's like,

1849
01:48:11,941 --> 01:48:15,270
am I make gloves? Yeah. And I may
fighters find out the hard way.

1850
01:48:15,271 --> 01:48:16,140
Like you can't just,

1851
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:20,940
you can open up with boxing and not even
worry as much about what you're hitting,

1852
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:23,760
but you cannot do that if you're
fighting bare knuckle this.

1853
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:26,780
Have you seen that bare knuckle boxing?
I was just going to say,

1854
01:48:26,790 --> 01:48:30,570
what does this bare knuckle resurgence?
I think these guys are tough. Yeah.

1855
01:48:30,571 --> 01:48:34,830
The desk. What? You got pro boxers going
in it now? Yeah. Uh, who went in it?

1856
01:48:34,831 --> 01:48:39,810
Somebody, a decent name was in it
recently, but a lot of UFC fighters. Yeah.

1857
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,440
There nobody has a rover.
Yeah.

1858
01:48:41,550 --> 01:48:46,030
They've gone in rugby or football.
Right.

1859
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:50,580
Rugby guys are tougher than the
football players. 100% yeah. Yeah.

1860
01:48:50,810 --> 01:48:55,110
The Italian guys in it to,
I saw him doing the bare knuckle thing.

1861
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:58,770
Italian guy. It was the UFC fight in
front of the building. No, no, no.

1862
01:48:58,771 --> 01:49:03,750
An Italian American. She'll
feel baroni bare knuckle. Yeah,

1863
01:49:03,751 --> 01:49:08,070
he did one. Yeah. Yeah. Quite
a few MMA fighters. Melvin.

1864
01:49:08,071 --> 01:49:10,800
Gloria did some, yeah, it's a, you know,

1865
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:14,340
but it's sort of a last resort kind of
thing. Trying to pick up a paycheck.

1866
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:16,050
You know Chris Lidell did it.

1867
01:49:17,780 --> 01:49:20,190
It's just a hard way to make a living.

1868
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,440
Some of them about 20 to have
CT scan knocking at the door.

1869
01:49:24,180 --> 01:49:28,440
He's just saying the time. Tell us
mother fuckers sit down. It's your boy.

1870
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:32,760
Who My guy. Yeah, he's not going
to Eddie the Mexican. Yeah. No,

1871
01:49:32,761 --> 01:49:36,150
he's good to fire him. He's trying to
get into the other guys talking to him.

1872
01:49:36,510 --> 01:49:40,080
So Lennox is fellow is talking
to your fellow? My assistant.

1873
01:49:40,110 --> 01:49:44,820
My assistant knows better.
Well, people get silly. It's
like a good million though.

1874
01:49:44,830 --> 01:49:47,700
Once you enjoying this meal,
you just want to finish it. No.

1875
01:49:47,890 --> 01:49:51,250
What did they have you doing after
this? Uh, just more interviews. You,

1876
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:54,310
they kept me busy, boring ass
interviews. So what are you promoting?

1877
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:58,060
Promoting the fights. Which fights?
We haven't talked about any of them.

1878
01:49:59,580 --> 01:50:03,790
You couldn't promote a foreigner to be
neat and context talking about Chason get

1879
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:06,940
the fuck outta here.
You get the fuck Outta here.

1880
01:50:07,390 --> 01:50:10,420
Tell your boy I'm good. I'm good
at it. You don't worry about me.

1881
01:50:10,421 --> 01:50:13,740
I've already told them I don't have
to be somewhere to four 30 that's,

1882
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,850
I'm going to put some two way glass there.

1883
01:50:15,900 --> 01:50:19,720
We could see out and they can't
see in. That's a good idea. Yeah.

1884
01:50:20,320 --> 01:50:24,730
Silly boy. Try Interrupt podcast ready?
Jesus said it's Shawn Porter. Yeah.

1885
01:50:24,770 --> 01:50:26,560
In this weekend.
Who was he fighting?

1886
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:31,870
A you guys from Cuba. Oh, they said
you guess I'm like, I, I'm know who

1887
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:38,680
it should be a good fighter. And
this is on, this is on Fox PBC. Oh,

1888
01:50:38,681 --> 01:50:40,880
nice. Yeah. Porter's a
champ right now. Right?

1889
01:50:42,190 --> 01:50:44,530
He won the title from
Thurman, didn't he? Yeah.

1890
01:50:45,630 --> 01:50:47,380
And the or did he want
it from Danny Garcia?

1891
01:50:48,640 --> 01:50:49,473
Danny Garcia.

1892
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:56,250
Don't you watch boxing, aren't
you a box? Of course. Jesus.

1893
01:50:56,560 --> 01:50:58,180
I'll tell you anything
about the heavyweights.

1894
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:01,500
Are you doing commentary on us
last week? Danny Garcia? Yes.

1895
01:51:02,520 --> 01:51:06,350
So you're doing commentary on this for
Fox? Yes. Nice. It should be a good fight.

1896
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:09,970
It should be a very good
fight. Yeah. Yeah. There's a,
there it is right there. Oh,

1897
01:51:09,990 --> 01:51:14,630
he grew his hair out every,
every time. Sean Pores. SMURF.

1898
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:19,140
Oh, it's Lennox. Every
time Shawn porter fights,

1899
01:51:19,141 --> 01:51:23,580
he's always uh, uh, the
series Brah you know,

1900
01:51:23,581 --> 01:51:27,060
this guy reminds me of the
old time fighters. He the
way out of this guy fights,

1901
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:29,730
you know,
it gives you a lot of pressures on you.

1902
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,670
Somebody you help him tie
his tie though he doesn't,

1903
01:51:32,700 --> 01:51:37,320
he doesn't mind taking the shots
too punchy. So he mixes it up.

1904
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:41,760
That's this Saturday
night. Yes. Nice. Um, yeah,

1905
01:51:41,761 --> 01:51:44,370
there's a lot of great fights
coming up. The uh, Mikey Garcia,

1906
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:47,340
Earl Spence jr excited. That's
what, that's a very good fight.

1907
01:51:47,620 --> 01:51:50,790
It makes me nervous though. It makes me a
nerd. Why and why? That's a great fight.

1908
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:55,230
What he wants to see. It's a great
fight, but as I'm a, I like Mikey Garcia,

1909
01:51:55,231 --> 01:51:58,950
but to me it's like, I like both of
those guys. I like them both I think.

1910
01:51:58,951 --> 01:52:02,100
I think Mikey's plus in
this fight is that spent,

1911
01:52:02,101 --> 01:52:05,830
hasn't had pressure like this and Mikey
doesn't tank out on anybody. Yeah.

1912
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:08,750
He's not gas out and he's not
afraid to mix it up with you.

1913
01:52:08,850 --> 01:52:11,250
What about the size difference?
That's what I'm worried about.

1914
01:52:11,251 --> 01:52:15,030
It's the size difference,
the weight difference. I
mean, I would have preferred,

1915
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:18,090
mine is called one more fight before
he fought Spence. But no, he's,

1916
01:52:18,091 --> 01:52:21,570
they know what they're doing. He's ready.
These whole families. Um, I mean, yeah,

1917
01:52:21,571 --> 01:52:26,250
he talks in specialists and I trained
with his brother before with, with Robert.

1918
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:30,810
Oh, have you really? In Oxnard. Yeah.
Really? Yeah. No Shit. Yeah. Okay. Great.

1919
01:52:30,830 --> 01:52:35,730
Gym Jujitsu with John Jacques
Machado. Your boxing, Robert
Garcia and Loma Chanko.

1920
01:52:35,731 --> 01:52:37,380
Was there a training one
day? I went damn. Yeah,

1921
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:39,240
Teddy's up there right
now working with that.

1922
01:52:39,241 --> 01:52:44,060
A light heavyweight Russian character.
Oh, the uh, the Uzbek gay kids.

1923
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:46,340
Amazing. Yeah. Yeah,

1924
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:49,050
yeah. I trained with
a trained over at, uh,

1925
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:52,760
Goossens Jim over the Christmas holiday.
How did you relate? Boxed in two years.

1926
01:52:52,761 --> 01:52:57,630
Oh my God. I suck. My fucking hands
are, and I'm like, God, fuck this sport.

1927
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:01,310
It's what your, your hands and
my hands were hurting after that.

1928
01:53:01,970 --> 01:53:03,590
Did you wrap them?
I wrapped him.

1929
01:53:03,650 --> 01:53:06,110
I might wrap them too tight
and you got soft hands.

1930
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:12,800
Don't make me square up. Kid took it.
It's been two years. I was like, ah,

1931
01:53:13,160 --> 01:53:17,100
I don't, I do this and got to
do it slow. You know, it was,

1932
01:53:17,210 --> 01:53:19,940
cause he knew I used to train
back in the day, so I was like,

1933
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:23,730
I want it to look good. And I'm
like, ah, okay, let me help you

1934
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:27,400
do, let's see. This is where
the martial arts comes in,

1935
01:53:27,401 --> 01:53:31,280
but get this thing of sand,
ah,

1936
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:32,900
and you just start punching it.

1937
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,640
Toughen you up a little
bit tough and you won't.

1938
01:53:38,930 --> 01:53:42,070
When I say my hands hurt, I meant like
the joints. My joints were hurting. Well,

1939
01:53:42,071 --> 01:53:44,080
you know what people do
you ever see rice bags?

1940
01:53:44,120 --> 01:53:45,990
They stick their hand up rice bags,

1941
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,930
they do a lot of this rice bags that
apparently is very good for your hands.

1942
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:54,420
I did that, but my mom got mad.
I was fucking up her. Right. So

1943
01:53:56,650 --> 01:53:57,690
what did you do about it?

1944
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:02,900
Yeah. And I went home and just so

1945
01:54:04,460 --> 01:54:07,820
if you just get back to doing it a little
combat, you know, I figured that much,

1946
01:54:07,821 --> 01:54:11,180
but I'm like, bring a tennis ball
everywhere. I'm gonna stick with Jujitsu.

1947
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:14,630
It doesn't hurt as much. Did you? Just,
it doesn't hurt your hands? No. Uh, my,

1948
01:54:14,780 --> 01:54:18,800
I wear those little Luda gear guards.
What Lou tell gear. Have you seen them?

1949
01:54:18,801 --> 01:54:21,080
They got these little finger
guards that they actually help.

1950
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:22,150
What are their strength?

1951
01:54:22,180 --> 01:54:24,890
And it gives you say make a
two finger on a three finger.

1952
01:54:25,370 --> 01:54:28,100
I will no idea what the word, the three
finger. It's just like a little, uh,

1953
01:54:28,460 --> 01:54:31,580
it's like a little cut off glove for
your fingers. Really holds them together.

1954
01:54:31,850 --> 01:54:33,730
Ninja thing.
It's nice.

1955
01:54:33,940 --> 01:54:37,610
It give you more traction to cause
it's not necessarily, but it just,

1956
01:54:37,700 --> 01:54:39,680
it keeps your fingers together.
Piece from separating.

1957
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:41,090
I'm fucking pop your finger out.

1958
01:54:41,390 --> 01:54:43,160
That's probably good if you're
a guitarist or some shit.

1959
01:54:43,340 --> 01:54:46,450
Probably my mom uses some too
forthright. I'll look at that. That's it.

1960
01:54:46,460 --> 01:54:51,320
That's the two finger joint. I use the
three. I've never even fucked with those.

1961
01:54:51,410 --> 01:54:54,390
Yeah, I'm old school bro.
I just take my shit up it.

1962
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:58,550
But you're also fucking gorilla
strong. It's weird. Why is it weird?

1963
01:54:58,760 --> 01:55:03,080
Because it just, it's, it's like playing
with a fucking silver back gorilla.

1964
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,660
Even when I watched your role was John
Jack that day. I was like, you go,

1965
01:55:05,670 --> 01:55:10,640
you want to roll? I go, no I don't.
I'll do it now. But then I'm like,

1966
01:55:10,641 --> 01:55:13,520
no, but I've been doing
it a long time, man.

1967
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:16,850
I started Jujitsu in 96 [inaudible]
rolling tomorrow. Right. I'm calling them,

1968
01:55:16,851 --> 01:55:17,421
calling them now.

1969
01:55:17,421 --> 01:55:20,510
We're going to probably roll around not
eight 30 in the morning if that's cool

1970
01:55:20,511 --> 01:55:22,220
with you. Yeah, that works.
Yeah, we could do that.

1971
01:55:22,730 --> 01:55:26,540
What's different about
Jujitsu and wrestling? What's
the, what's the difference?

1972
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:29,990
Depending upon whether or not use
the Gooey, the gies a big factor.

1973
01:55:29,991 --> 01:55:32,210
Cause you could grab a
hold of that and it's all,

1974
01:55:32,211 --> 01:55:35,360
it makes you more defensive minded
because you can get caught in things.

1975
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:38,630
He ain't cotton submissions easier, but
submissions are the big thing obviously.

1976
01:55:38,660 --> 01:55:41,840
But I do a lot of Gnocchi.
I have a black belt Nogi Jujitsu,

1977
01:55:41,841 --> 01:55:44,160
engage you to two pro.
I actually prefer

1978
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:48,300
no, Gee, we don't want to do tomorrow.
We do whatever we do gay. I don't care.

1979
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:53,640
I just don't use it. I just don't use the
key. You know, I let people grab mine,

1980
01:55:53,670 --> 01:55:57,810
but I try to use armbars and chokes
and things that I would do Gnocchi.

1981
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:02,400
That's how I trained from Geeta Nogi so
that I could do both. I just decided to,

1982
01:56:02,420 --> 01:56:04,250
I'm just going to train in the gay,

1983
01:56:04,251 --> 01:56:07,230
like I don't have one on like let
people grow. I'll be, I'll be,

1984
01:56:07,620 --> 01:56:11,880
I'll recognize that I have it on so people
can grab me, but I don't grab theirs.

1985
01:56:12,210 --> 01:56:14,700
I just use over hooks and under hooks and,
okay.

1986
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:20,190
So I was trying to make a joke out of
Nogi. Oh, somebody gave him the key.

1987
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:21,180
Josie Gaylord.

1988
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:27,900
It is definitely a slower game.
Like older dudes in particular,

1989
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:32,010
they seem to like the geek because they
can kind of control you and it's good

1990
01:56:32,011 --> 01:56:35,630
for you and it could also be used
against you, which is bad. Well, it's,

1991
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,320
if you have a winter coat on,
man,

1992
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:40,860
like I always said that the worst thing
to do is get in a fight with a judo

1993
01:56:40,861 --> 01:56:45,660
black belt when you got a winter coat
or a sweater lecture. That's good.

1994
01:56:45,820 --> 01:56:50,260
Yeah. Yeah. We're looking
at you. It's all gravy.

1995
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:55,860
Yeah. You, uh, you got your blue
belt now, right? When you, uh,

1996
01:56:55,950 --> 01:56:58,020
when you think you'd get a purple
belt and you're on your way, right?

1997
01:56:58,021 --> 01:57:00,660
I've got to get some stripes. I
talked to JJ about it ago, dude.

1998
01:57:00,661 --> 01:57:02,220
I'm trying to train more so I
can get a stripe because yeah,

1999
01:57:02,221 --> 01:57:05,130
you're due for a stripe. I go, well,
how am I going to fucking train more?

2000
01:57:05,131 --> 01:57:07,870
So I think I have to strive. I don't want
the stripe. I want to earn the strike.

2001
01:57:08,010 --> 01:57:11,130
How are you doing things other than
your Jujitsu training in terms of like

2002
01:57:11,131 --> 01:57:15,080
physical training? Um, maybe
a little dumbbells and, and
Yoga Ball. It's about it.

2003
01:57:15,081 --> 01:57:18,300
Yeah, that's it. Yeah. She get a
trainer. Get someone like it'll,

2004
01:57:18,301 --> 01:57:20,640
it'll make a big difference.
It's like, think about your,

2005
01:57:20,730 --> 01:57:22,650
your body is like a race car,
right?

2006
01:57:23,010 --> 01:57:25,980
If you could just lift weights
and your race car would go faster,

2007
01:57:26,340 --> 01:57:28,830
wouldn't you do that?
If there was a thing you could do,

2008
01:57:28,850 --> 01:57:31,260
you can your raise my little dumbbells,
but dumb bells.

2009
01:57:31,261 --> 01:57:35,210
But my elbow farcan hurts lately.
So like quitting is talking about,

2010
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:37,790
this is the thing I was talking about
either with tennis elbow, right.

2011
01:57:38,250 --> 01:57:42,450
I was having a problem with my elbow.
You'll, you'll hold it like that.

2012
01:57:42,451 --> 01:57:47,400
Like you twist it like this and then you
untwist it with your arms so you hold

2013
01:57:47,401 --> 01:57:50,410
it like this,
twist and then untwist it.

2014
01:57:50,450 --> 01:57:53,040
He'd do it slowly and it
works on these tendons,

2015
01:57:53,041 --> 01:57:56,160
the same tendons that you get wet,
but it's just so shitty. How I got it.

2016
01:57:56,340 --> 01:58:00,190
Fucking sleeping. Could we have
him try that right now? But see,

2017
01:58:00,191 --> 01:58:04,890
God damn. It's a lot heavier
than it looks. So you twist
it and then untwist it.

2018
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:08,610
Yeah, like, like twist
it like that. Right.

2019
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:13,820
And then leveled out and then
slowly untwisted that's good.

2020
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:18,260
Yeah. Just to do it over and over
and over again a little bit. That's,

2021
01:58:18,990 --> 01:58:22,620
it's far more dense than it looks.
It's great for your tendons.

2022
01:58:22,621 --> 01:58:27,440
It's specifically works this part of
your arm like down in here and they just

2023
01:58:27,441 --> 01:58:32,280
look at, you're jerking
off Lynn. That's good too.

2024
01:58:32,281 --> 01:58:33,780
You know what else is good?
A roller.

2025
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:36,060
You know like when you have
one of those foam rollers? No,

2026
01:58:36,061 --> 01:58:38,790
a chord with like a weight of the bottom
of it and you've got to roll it with

2027
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:40,650
your, Roy used to do that and
box. That was during the day.

2028
01:58:40,680 --> 01:58:42,120
Those are great people just

2029
01:58:42,130 --> 01:58:46,750
used to fabricate them in the gym. Yeah,
like a stick or a row. Those are great.

2030
01:58:46,780 --> 01:58:49,060
Yeah. I haven't one of those
out there too. It's just that's,

2031
01:58:49,090 --> 01:58:51,010
that's one of the best things
for your forearms, right? Yeah.

2032
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:53,680
For your forearms and gripping.
Just have that kind of strength.

2033
01:58:55,810 --> 01:58:57,610
Good.
You'd be awesome at Jujitsu.

2034
01:58:57,700 --> 01:59:00,700
I guarantee you because you're a chess
player and she just is very cerebral.

2035
01:59:01,210 --> 01:59:06,100
You know? It's very, it's like it's, it's
boxing. Obviously he's very cerebral too,

2036
01:59:06,101 --> 01:59:07,840
but there you're limited in your weapons.

2037
01:59:07,900 --> 01:59:09,940
You'd only have a certain amount
of angle she could punch from.

2038
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:12,590
Where did you Jitsu?
There's an endless combination.

2039
01:59:13,450 --> 01:59:18,450
You get some time to think some to in
certain positions of the teacher that did

2040
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:23,830
I kido, yeah, that's what he did to that.

2041
01:59:23,831 --> 01:59:28,420
Do the half and half, half a k
don't have to Jitsu on. He gave me,

2042
01:59:28,421 --> 01:59:32,140
he did something to me and I realize,
okay, I got to watch out for that.

2043
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:36,280
That's where you know the person
manipulates your bone and then drops their

2044
01:59:36,281 --> 01:59:40,330
whole weight on it. Yeah. Yeah.
That shit could break your hand.

2045
01:59:40,750 --> 01:59:42,640
If you don't go with it.
It'll break your hand.

2046
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:45,400
Fred's Fred's and push out
as I shit the people. Yeah.

2047
01:59:45,401 --> 01:59:49,120
Marcello Garcia is tat people out like
high level people with risks locks in

2048
01:59:49,121 --> 01:59:49,960
Jujitsu tournament.

2049
01:59:50,060 --> 01:59:53,410
John Jack was showing me like how to risk
like a guy while you're done like damn.

2050
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:57,550
It's like, it's not nice. Don't do it
to people, but you can do this. Yeah.

2051
01:59:57,551 --> 02:00:01,390
There's some nasty shit. The thing
is like there's no end did you do to,

2052
02:00:01,450 --> 02:00:05,080
there's no end. There's no like these
are all the moves and that's it.

2053
02:00:05,110 --> 02:00:08,710
But people keep inventing moves.
I just found our new move yesterday.

2054
02:00:08,711 --> 02:00:11,770
One rubber guard assassins
on uh, Instagram. Right.

2055
02:00:11,830 --> 02:00:16,830
They've figured out some crazy Kamora
that you do from a closed guard that leads

2056
02:00:16,871 --> 02:00:17,880
to a triangle.
I'm like,

2057
02:00:18,010 --> 02:00:22,640
what got somebody has to let you do a lot
of those things to some of them. Yeah.

2058
02:00:22,810 --> 02:00:24,700
But sometimes people don't
know what you're doing.

2059
02:00:24,940 --> 02:00:26,160
They don't even know you're letting them.

2060
02:00:26,190 --> 02:00:28,260
I'm always concerned about
rubber guard with the knees,

2061
02:00:28,270 --> 02:00:31,840
like fucking up your knee joints cause
you've got to be very flexible to get

2062
02:00:31,841 --> 02:00:34,960
that rubber guard in. Yeah,
just stretch. Yeah. Yeah.

2063
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:39,370
Stretch rubber guard.
I don't know what that is.

2064
02:00:39,430 --> 02:00:43,030
It's where you put somebody in between
your legs when you described it sounds so

2065
02:00:43,031 --> 02:00:44,230
gay. Uh, you put a,

2066
02:00:44,470 --> 02:00:48,610
put somebody between your legs and
then you pull your leg over their head,

2067
02:00:48,910 --> 02:00:51,910
but their head has to pop through so
you're now you're controlling them.

2068
02:00:51,911 --> 02:00:56,610
You can hold their head this way.
It's a lot of fucking rubberiness.

2069
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,720
Yes.
That I don't have the ability to do.

2070
02:00:59,070 --> 02:01:00,970
It was invented by my friend Eddie Bravo,

2071
02:01:00,971 --> 02:01:04,510
but there was some guys who would
play high guard before that.

2072
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:07,360
He just put it into a more, there it
is here. That's a good example of it.

2073
02:01:07,690 --> 02:01:08,560
That's what it looks like.

2074
02:01:08,920 --> 02:01:13,920
So he's pulling down using his his leg
and his arms to control a guy and wraps

2075
02:01:15,351 --> 02:01:20,050
them up and while he's down. Yeah.
Well yeah, so he's on the bottom.

2076
02:01:20,051 --> 02:01:24,490
It looks like a Gracie move. It is well
to Jujitsu moves. So it's a bravo move.

2077
02:01:24,580 --> 02:01:27,760
All Jujitsu essentially. Sadie
right there. Yeah, there is.

2078
02:01:28,900 --> 02:01:33,900
Eddie and Joe came up under my teacher
and then Eddie took it to another level

2079
02:01:33,911 --> 02:01:37,900
from there. Well Eddie just branched
out and you know, went into Nogi.

2080
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:40,170
He's much more [inaudible].
He has a black belt, the

2081
02:01:40,220 --> 02:01:41,053
as well,

2082
02:01:41,300 --> 02:01:44,660
much more concerned with Nogi techniques
because he wanted techniques that would

2083
02:01:44,661 --> 02:01:47,720
work in mixed martial arts.
So it mixed martial arts,

2084
02:01:47,721 --> 02:01:50,420
you don't have the collars
to grab the sleeves to grab.

2085
02:01:50,421 --> 02:01:54,300
So he wanted to invent a
system that you could use a f,

2086
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:58,430
especially when you have the ability
to fight off of your back is very,

2087
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:02,750
when you fight, that's Ben Saunders,
who's like one of the best at it in MMA.

2088
02:02:02,910 --> 02:02:06,280
And if you get wrapped up,
you're on top of a Dooney.

2089
02:02:06,300 --> 02:02:10,490
He wraps you up with his legs like
that. It's very, it's very demoralizing.

2090
02:02:11,120 --> 02:02:14,780
You get so trapped in human nature tells
you when you're on your back and his

2091
02:02:14,781 --> 02:02:16,920
guy on top of you, you're in
trouble. But in Jujitsu like, Nah,

2092
02:02:16,930 --> 02:02:21,620
it's fine if you've got a good
guard like John Jock. Yeah. Yeah.

2093
02:02:22,310 --> 02:02:26,000
Wow. I have an interest in that. What do
you live these days? I live in Canada.

2094
02:02:26,060 --> 02:02:29,030
You still live in Toronto? Yeah, I
was in Jamaica for a minute. Yeah,

2095
02:02:29,060 --> 02:02:32,030
you were living in Jamaica for me.
Yeah. That was fun. I love Toronto.

2096
02:02:32,170 --> 02:02:34,280
It was one of my favorite places
on the call. You first met him.

2097
02:02:34,281 --> 02:02:38,140
I introduced you to him. I was telling
him earlier at the nightclub. Yeah.

2098
02:02:39,170 --> 02:02:42,930
I took Joe nightclub to meet Lennox and
I remember that meeting though. Yeah.

2099
02:02:43,120 --> 02:02:45,050
That's when the,
what's the thing was playing scratch.

2100
02:02:45,051 --> 02:02:48,200
Scratch was playing and
everybody was there.

2101
02:02:48,520 --> 02:02:52,400
Toronto is just such a perfect city.
It's like the people are nice,

2102
02:02:52,520 --> 02:02:56,180
but it's urban, like it's very
populated. There's a lot of people,

2103
02:02:56,181 --> 02:02:59,630
but they don't have that asshole
vibe that like New York has.

2104
02:02:59,631 --> 02:03:03,680
I think it's the fifth largest
city in North America. Is
it? Yeah, let me tell you.

2105
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:08,060
They're building like mad over there.
All the condos made out of glass,

2106
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:12,800
renters market. Uh,
but tiny little places.

2107
02:03:13,160 --> 02:03:15,410
But there's so much cool shit
there and now that weed's legal,

2108
02:03:15,830 --> 02:03:18,920
it's probably booming in Canada,
but he was never really an issue there.

2109
02:03:18,921 --> 02:03:21,410
If you got caught with it,
like just give it to stop it.

2110
02:03:21,411 --> 02:03:23,660
But now it's like you'd
go to their stores,

2111
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:28,620
you know the stores on the street like
yeah,

2112
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:32,750
I think
we saw some stores,

2113
02:03:33,380 --> 02:03:37,580
they're opening like
about 25 or 50 in Toronto.

2114
02:03:38,450 --> 02:03:41,120
So the government's giving
them great place, man.

2115
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:44,940
I did that place that you do that a
the score. Shannon does center. Oh,

2116
02:03:45,110 --> 02:03:48,350
Scotia Bank and call at Scotia Bank.
I just did it in November.

2117
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:51,700
He came home and then you were there I
think a month before me when I got yeah.

2118
02:03:51,840 --> 02:03:52,310
Yeah,

2119
02:03:52,310 --> 02:03:55,490
that was there before my Netflix special
came out and it came out in October.

2120
02:03:55,490 --> 02:03:59,030
So I think I was there around that. Yeah.
Yeah. I fucking love it up there man.

2121
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:02,300
That's probably one of my favorite
cities to visit. Come on back. I love it.

2122
02:04:02,301 --> 02:04:05,930
Massey Hall. Love that. Put that
together. Yeah, that was fun, man.

2123
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:10,670
You and me and a big J. Oh, that's
right. That's right. That's right.

2124
02:04:10,700 --> 02:04:14,450
Yeah. That was a good time, man. The
UFC is, they're always great too. Yeah.

2125
02:04:14,930 --> 02:04:19,310
Good support. They love it up there.
Yeah. Well it's just Toronto. Just such a,

2126
02:04:19,340 --> 02:04:23,480
it's such an unusual city. Like Canada
in general. Like I'll ask you this,

2127
02:04:23,481 --> 02:04:28,010
why people are so nice. There's so
much nicer than Americans. It's a,

2128
02:04:28,550 --> 02:04:32,290
I don't know. It's different.
There's nice American. It's nice.

2129
02:04:32,330 --> 02:04:36,350
You're saying they're more polite,
more polite. Yeah. I find that too,

2130
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:38,010
I think are

2131
02:04:38,370 --> 02:04:42,850
nicer on as far as, um, have you
been to New York lately? Yeah.

2132
02:04:43,110 --> 02:04:46,290
I love it. Here's the
thing. Canadians are polite,

2133
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:50,940
but we'll talk shit about
you and you're not take that,

2134
02:04:51,240 --> 02:04:52,730
but take that over.
Being rude.

2135
02:04:53,180 --> 02:04:57,000
But Canadians can also get freaked
out by people being a foreword,

2136
02:04:57,001 --> 02:05:00,850
which Americans are considered
very forward. And you know, it's,

2137
02:05:00,851 --> 02:05:05,340
it's an outgoing thing. So where,
where is an American be like, Hey,

2138
02:05:05,900 --> 02:05:08,590
yeah, I want to ask you something.
Eh, Canadians were like, whoa. Why?

2139
02:05:08,600 --> 02:05:11,550
Why is this person so aggressive? I'm
like, where's the Canadian? Be like,

2140
02:05:11,551 --> 02:05:14,420
excuse me. I'd like to ask you a
question. That's true. That's true.

2141
02:05:14,430 --> 02:05:18,660
It's very similar, but just
different approaches. Why, you know,

2142
02:05:18,690 --> 02:05:21,780
as far as like standup comedy is there,
how good is the,

2143
02:05:21,781 --> 02:05:23,790
the community in Canada?

2144
02:05:23,850 --> 02:05:27,840
Is it like the community in America where
there's a lot of up and coming people

2145
02:05:27,841 --> 02:05:32,220
or is it, is a lot of comics in Canada,
a lot of great ones come out of Canada.

2146
02:05:32,690 --> 02:05:37,260
Um, the problem is there's
no, um, the money's not there.

2147
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:41,940
So no matter touring around like
the clubs, once you get, you know,

2148
02:05:41,941 --> 02:05:45,460
the clubs tap out at like, maybe
you'll make, let's see what,

2149
02:05:45,480 --> 02:05:49,680
that's six shows on a weekend. I had a
good headline there. Can make 1200 bucks.

2150
02:05:49,710 --> 02:05:53,310
That's it. I mean, that's pretty
fucking insane. Yeah, it's rough.

2151
02:05:53,340 --> 02:05:56,580
Especially if they're selling
out and making drinking.

2152
02:05:57,060 --> 02:05:59,120
That's the problem is that the club it,

2153
02:05:59,250 --> 02:06:03,750
I liken it to the UFC almost to a
certain degree. It's not about the comic.

2154
02:06:03,751 --> 02:06:07,400
It's about the name of the
club who like Yuk, Yuk, Yuk,

2155
02:06:07,410 --> 02:06:10,530
yuks and it doesn't matter who's there,
it's about Yucky. The UFC is about UFC,

2156
02:06:10,531 --> 02:06:11,860
doesn't matter who the fucking fighters.

2157
02:06:11,970 --> 02:06:15,180
They used to have that attitude at
some of the clubs in La. You know,

2158
02:06:15,181 --> 02:06:18,690
that was one of the reasons why they had
that big comic strike way back in the

2159
02:06:18,690 --> 02:06:21,120
70s yeah. It's because people
felt like the, you know,

2160
02:06:21,121 --> 02:06:23,250
the comics were the ones who
are providing the art form,

2161
02:06:23,251 --> 02:06:25,710
but the clubs are the ones who are making
all the money and they were like, hey,

2162
02:06:25,980 --> 02:06:28,890
you know, you are you, you're at the
improv where you were at the comedy store.

2163
02:06:29,010 --> 02:06:29,221
You know,

2164
02:06:29,221 --> 02:06:33,240
the pay scale at these clubs is the same
as it was in the 80s which is fucking

2165
02:06:33,241 --> 02:06:36,620
horrible. Like I take people
out on the road with me and,

2166
02:06:36,621 --> 02:06:40,530
and the clubs will pay 50 bucks for an
emcee for the weekend and 100 bucks for

2167
02:06:40,531 --> 02:06:43,200
the feature. And I'm like, that's
fucking nuts. That's what it was.

2168
02:06:43,380 --> 02:06:46,530
I started in 89 and that's what
it was back then. That's crazy.

2169
02:06:46,531 --> 02:06:48,950
They just never like that.
And I'm like, that's terrible.

2170
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:51,330
Like how are these kids
going to make a living? Well,

2171
02:06:51,331 --> 02:06:53,040
in a way it's a lot like boxing.

2172
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:56,160
Cause like when people think that
boxers make millions of dogs cause Floyd

2173
02:06:56,160 --> 02:06:58,590
Mayweather and make $100 million
in a fight. And that is true.

2174
02:06:58,591 --> 02:07:00,450
But if you look at the undercard,

2175
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:03,360
like there's guys that are
fighting for chump change. I mean,

2176
02:07:03,361 --> 02:07:08,100
and they are going through a long camp.
Do you remember your first paycheck? Yeah.

2177
02:07:08,250 --> 02:07:12,440
What was your first boxing paycheck?
5,000 wow. That's because I'm coming,

2178
02:07:12,460 --> 02:07:15,930
I'm coming down to the Olympics baby.
Yeah, that's true. But even still,

2179
02:07:15,931 --> 02:07:19,170
that's $5,000 for a
fucking professional fight.

2180
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:22,560
But you also had signed a multi
billion dollar deal. Oh yeah.

2181
02:07:22,561 --> 02:07:27,420
He's going to add up after a while. Yeah.
I mean you're a, you're an exception.

2182
02:07:27,421 --> 02:07:29,970
I mean there's guys fight not there for
like 800 bucks. You know what I mean?

2183
02:07:30,430 --> 02:07:34,980
100 try 500 300 yeah. Yeah. So you know,

2184
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:36,010
another thing that disturbs

2185
02:07:36,010 --> 02:07:40,900
me about MMA as opposed to
boxing is the a win lose bonus.

2186
02:07:41,170 --> 02:07:43,480
I don't like that.
I think fighter,

2187
02:07:43,540 --> 02:07:46,330
I think a fighter should get paid
what they're supposed to get paid.

2188
02:07:46,331 --> 02:07:48,580
No one's trying to lose,
and if you're trying to lose,

2189
02:07:48,581 --> 02:07:50,590
you're never gonna be able to
compete at the highest level anyway.

2190
02:07:50,950 --> 02:07:54,520
These guys are pouring their heart and
soul. They're giving their body, they're,

2191
02:07:54,580 --> 02:07:55,030
they're,
they're,

2192
02:07:55,030 --> 02:08:00,030
they're literally sacrificing their
health and they might get fucked out of a

2193
02:08:00,911 --> 02:08:03,790
decision and because of that,
they lose 50% of their money.

2194
02:08:04,060 --> 02:08:08,230
So some incompetent judge,
which inboxing is everywhere.

2195
02:08:08,380 --> 02:08:11,650
I mean the late bird, how dare
you, you just, well, there's a,

2196
02:08:11,740 --> 02:08:12,910
there was even worse than her.

2197
02:08:12,911 --> 02:08:15,640
There's people that don't even do it
anymore because they get chased out of the

2198
02:08:15,641 --> 02:08:17,400
game every time I listen to the eye.

2199
02:08:17,560 --> 02:08:19,060
That's when you know
you're a fan of the sport.

2200
02:08:19,060 --> 02:08:23,410
When you hear the judge's names go, fuck.
Not that guy. There was a lot of them,

2201
02:08:23,411 --> 02:08:24,810
man. There's a lot of them. I mean,

2202
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,690
imagine if 50% of your purchase goes away
because someone doesn't know what the

2203
02:08:28,691 --> 02:08:33,070
fuck they're doing. The win lose bonus,
they're guaranteed a certain amount,

2204
02:08:33,100 --> 02:08:35,920
the guaranteed a certain amount, but
that's to show like say this, right?

2205
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:41,050
Like say maybe you would get 10 and 10
so you get $10,000 to fight and 10,000

2206
02:08:41,051 --> 02:08:44,200
more if you win.
It's crazy.

2207
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:48,460
It's oftentimes 50% and the idea is that
you're going to give these fighters and

2208
02:08:48,461 --> 02:08:51,430
an incentive to put on a better show.
But I think,

2209
02:08:51,910 --> 02:08:53,500
I don't lie and then fight of the night,

2210
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:58,990
I don't like when people
fight any different than the
way they're fighting when

2211
02:08:58,991 --> 02:09:01,360
they're fighting the best
and the smartest. Right.

2212
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:03,040
I think you should fight intelligently.

2213
02:09:03,041 --> 02:09:07,720
You shouldn't engage in a wild brawl
because you want some performance bonus,

2214
02:09:07,990 --> 02:09:08,230
you know?

2215
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:11,200
Because like they'll give out performance
of the night or knock out of the night,

2216
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:13,150
can you,
can you lose and still get the,

2217
02:09:13,350 --> 02:09:17,190
the fight of the night bunk Serone
he's got a ton of those phones.

2218
02:09:17,230 --> 02:09:19,780
Got a ton of bonuses.
I mean that's him though.

2219
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:23,600
He would fight that way if you gave him
a guarantee. Oh yes. It's a free sample.

2220
02:09:23,650 --> 02:09:26,920
If he knew he was going to make a half
million dollars a fight, no matter what,

2221
02:09:27,100 --> 02:09:30,820
he would fight exactly that way. That's
how he fights and I think that's how,

2222
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:34,090
that's how it should be. He's an anomaly
though, because he grew up with money,

2223
02:09:34,091 --> 02:09:38,680
didn't he like the decent? He grew up
with a decent lifestyle. Terribly poor.

2224
02:09:38,860 --> 02:09:40,570
He wasn't wealthy.
I have fun.

2225
02:09:40,590 --> 02:09:43,300
I had money and they could grow up
with with a decent amount of money.

2226
02:09:43,301 --> 02:09:45,400
That's the way I was sold at.
I don't believe so.

2227
02:09:45,401 --> 02:09:48,400
I don't want to speak out of school. I
mean neither, but I have always been,

2228
02:09:48,470 --> 02:09:51,850
he's fought Bj Penn.
Did you know Bj Penn is a legend.

2229
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:56,650
Bj grew up with a wealthy family.
They're wealthy. He just was a fighter.

2230
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:00,640
He finds it, saw somewhere. He's fine.
He's gonna fight. Click Weda. Yes.

2231
02:10:01,390 --> 02:10:05,590
That's a fucking odd one. When
he retired, he did. He got bored,

2232
02:10:06,370 --> 02:10:07,540
so I still wants to do it.

2233
02:10:07,570 --> 02:10:10,780
He actually lived very good and this
last fight up until they told him he got

2234
02:10:10,781 --> 02:10:13,510
very exciting fighter back in the day.
There's still a wild man.

2235
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:16,030
He's still a while,
but he got leg lock by Ryan Hall,

2236
02:10:16,031 --> 02:10:20,170
who's just phenomenal Jujitsu
player and he, he caught him with a,

2237
02:10:20,330 --> 02:10:22,330
he did a, uh, uh,

2238
02:10:22,360 --> 02:10:27,360
Amun Ra role and caught him at a leg lock
and just fucked his leg up and Minari

2239
02:10:27,760 --> 02:10:31,540
role. Yeah. You're talking about,
it sounds like something you eat it

2240
02:10:33,830 --> 02:10:35,390
him and our role,
um,

2241
02:10:35,530 --> 02:10:40,280
him and Ari is this a very famous Japanese
fighter who was a phenomenal leg lock

2242
02:10:40,281 --> 02:10:43,280
artist and does actually two moves.
There's two,

2243
02:10:43,460 --> 02:10:45,770
there's the MNR role and
there's an immune Ari,

2244
02:10:45,830 --> 02:10:50,830
which at MNR he comes from a Omoplata
and Omoplata is a shoulder lock.

2245
02:10:51,500 --> 02:10:53,840
I think it's a Portuguese word.
I think that's what they call it.

2246
02:10:53,980 --> 02:10:57,320
[inaudible] it's from your leg
gets a, yeah, it's a shoulder lock.

2247
02:10:57,321 --> 02:11:00,590
And then the inventory is,
while you're locked up in the Alma Plata,

2248
02:11:00,860 --> 02:11:05,450
you grab like a grip underneath the guy's
Chin and Yank them back. It's a nasty,

2249
02:11:05,660 --> 02:11:07,340
now I'll show you tomorrow.
I hope not.

2250
02:11:07,940 --> 02:11:11,320
I really hope I can just
have a friendly role weekend.

2251
02:11:11,450 --> 02:11:14,150
But if you catch yourself in a
normal plot that it's common.

2252
02:11:14,400 --> 02:11:18,170
You don't, you know what's funny is when,
uh, uh, I'm a big fan of the NRM choke,

2253
02:11:18,171 --> 02:11:21,630
which I know is your favorite head
and arm. Yeah. And uh, and then

2254
02:11:23,240 --> 02:11:27,800
yeah, and then, uh, you're on jack now
calls of the Joe Hogan. Some would do it.

2255
02:11:27,801 --> 02:11:30,620
Can the Joe Hogan and then that's
your move. You've actually,

2256
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:32,270
that's now your move at the gym.

2257
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:35,680
Well, you know, sometimes you
have like techniques that you, uh,

2258
02:11:35,730 --> 02:11:40,020
you hit so often that you just know when
they're there and you can close them up

2259
02:11:40,021 --> 02:11:41,240
real quick. Yeah. That was

2260
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:42,060
my shit.

2261
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:45,270
That's what I've been ever since then
I've actually been working on that.

2262
02:11:45,730 --> 02:11:46,420
Well, you know, somebody,

2263
02:11:46,420 --> 02:11:48,940
you guys did it to me and it's
such a suffocating feeling.

2264
02:11:49,040 --> 02:11:51,730
And when someone's on top of you
and you got your arm pinned here,

2265
02:11:51,731 --> 02:11:56,731
that neck arms across your neck and
you like it a and you make that noise.

2266
02:11:56,831 --> 02:12:00,040
Funny enough, it's a horrible way to
get choked out. The esteem and luck.

2267
02:12:00,041 --> 02:12:02,890
I like when guys get locks named
after them. How do you get out of it?

2268
02:12:03,880 --> 02:12:07,610
You have to put your hand on your ear
like you're answering the phone. That's,

2269
02:12:07,630 --> 02:12:08,463
that's one.

2270
02:12:08,540 --> 02:12:12,190
Then the first thing is you're trying
to create some space here so that you

2271
02:12:12,191 --> 02:12:13,390
don't go to sleep.
You gotta,

2272
02:12:13,540 --> 02:12:17,650
you gotta give into the fact that this
guy's choking this side of your neck for

2273
02:12:17,651 --> 02:12:20,800
sure. So the arms coming under
here and it's wrapping around here,

2274
02:12:20,980 --> 02:12:24,130
and if you just go like that
and it's down or like that,

2275
02:12:24,370 --> 02:12:28,030
it's going to get smushed. You're
getting, you're getting smashed, right?

2276
02:12:28,060 --> 02:12:30,090
So you got to bring this thing in here,

2277
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,140
it trying to create a little bit of space.

2278
02:12:32,570 --> 02:12:36,130
Then you hope this motherfucker gets
tired of squeezing your neck and then you

2279
02:12:36,131 --> 02:12:39,980
try and get in here and create a little
bit of space. That's what we tried to do.

2280
02:12:40,010 --> 02:12:42,860
Just give me a little bit of space
at a time. Little bit of space. Just

2281
02:12:44,830 --> 02:12:48,360
get a little bit of space.
It's all just a matter of little inches,

2282
02:12:48,370 --> 02:12:50,050
little tiny micro movements.

2283
02:12:50,290 --> 02:12:54,460
But when someone has your arm wrapped up
like that and they have that arm across

2284
02:12:54,461 --> 02:12:57,940
your neck and it's crushing you with
their body weight and then they get their

2285
02:12:57,941 --> 02:13:01,750
knee on your solar plexus and
flat and you out and squeeze down.

2286
02:13:02,170 --> 02:13:03,003
It's horrible.

2287
02:13:03,700 --> 02:13:07,510
Are there funders and other countries
that don't go into Lma but they're

2288
02:13:07,720 --> 02:13:10,480
unbelievable fighters but they're not
trying to show anybody that they're

2289
02:13:10,481 --> 02:13:14,290
unbelievable fighters. Oh,
like Kung Fu guys? No, no.

2290
02:13:14,291 --> 02:13:16,300
Those guys all get fucked
up and they try to,

2291
02:13:16,330 --> 02:13:20,290
they think they do it because you start
believing it and you have your students

2292
02:13:20,291 --> 02:13:21,960
and they believe you're the master and

2293
02:13:23,220 --> 02:13:26,510
Shaolin Gadhia tried entering a bunch,
a bunch of those videos, that guy,

2294
02:13:26,511 --> 02:13:29,520
he would wear the Orange Shaolin suit
and he would win and like these really

2295
02:13:29,521 --> 02:13:31,040
hokey fight competition.

2296
02:13:32,090 --> 02:13:35,060
Then you get into the big ones and you
just get the shit beat out of him. Yeah,

2297
02:13:35,070 --> 02:13:38,670
he was kickboxing. Yeah. He
actually has some skills.

2298
02:13:39,120 --> 02:13:42,900
Like he didn't used to watch a
show that he could do a little bit.

2299
02:13:42,901 --> 02:13:46,320
But what I'm talking about,
it's like these cheap masters,

2300
02:13:46,321 --> 02:13:49,680
like a lot of those numbers are the ones
where you put a seems real are those

2301
02:13:49,681 --> 02:13:53,760
are so sad. Yeah. Yeah.
Dope. Yeah. Um, uh,

2302
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:55,950
Mick Dojo,
what is the,

2303
02:13:56,010 --> 02:14:00,120
the mic Dojo life on Instagram
has a shit load of those.

2304
02:14:00,240 --> 02:14:03,510
It was making me laugh. There's so sad.
That's what you put you put seems legit.

2305
02:14:03,570 --> 02:14:05,580
Yeah.
Well a lot of those budget is fuck.

2306
02:14:05,610 --> 02:14:09,210
They'll go and fight a real fighter and
they think they actually know how to

2307
02:14:09,211 --> 02:14:14,060
fight and they just get cut costs. They
just get smashed open cause you know why?

2308
02:14:14,270 --> 02:14:16,920
Why don't they don't get hit? Yeah.
They don't get that. That's why.

2309
02:14:16,921 --> 02:14:21,090
That's why I love boxing. Boxing. You
spar all the time. Yup. Hit all the time.

2310
02:14:21,091 --> 02:14:25,680
So you know, in a real
fight, boxers of being hit,

2311
02:14:25,710 --> 02:14:28,650
you know guys up do Kung Fu and all
those things, they don't get hit.

2312
02:14:28,651 --> 02:14:31,690
So when they do get hit in the real fight,
it's like it messes them up. It's like,

2313
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,940
no, I do not see this coming.
Yeah. Practical application.

2314
02:14:35,941 --> 02:14:38,560
The difference between
practicing and you know,

2315
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:41,790
thinking there's so many of these,
there is this guy doing,

2316
02:14:41,791 --> 02:14:43,440
I haven't seen this one.
This is a new one.

2317
02:14:43,940 --> 02:14:45,870
I just picked one that
that guy in the black,

2318
02:14:45,871 --> 02:14:47,700
he looks like he's going
to fuck this dude up.

2319
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:51,450
It's a very like gay looks like the
carpeting and my bedroom. Oh my God,

2320
02:14:52,710 --> 02:14:56,330
what are these guys are, oh, see
that. She did just see that. Oh,

2321
02:15:00,360 --> 02:15:04,200
I wonder why they were in such weird
gies and everyone can everybody clapping.

2322
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:08,730
Many black belts are in that
class. God days, silly Fox.
They really believed that.

2323
02:15:09,450 --> 02:15:11,640
I bet that guy could get them
to suck his dick the same way.

2324
02:15:11,940 --> 02:15:15,650
I know people who really believe that
their teacher can do that stuff, so

2325
02:15:20,420 --> 02:15:24,990
they're called priests.
How dare you. Yeah. It's,

2326
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:29,490
it's weird that those people are still
around in the day of video cameras that

2327
02:15:29,491 --> 02:15:32,460
you can still have this. But yeah,
what you're saying is probably like,

2328
02:15:32,490 --> 02:15:36,060
even when you were saying that if you
hadn't fought in two years and then you

2329
02:15:36,061 --> 02:15:39,090
would get in there and get hit, you're
like, whoa. Okay. Okay. Let's see.

2330
02:15:39,091 --> 02:15:42,450
I seen Keith Thurman do that
really old in his last fight

2331
02:15:44,720 --> 02:15:49,330
in Lopez is in a banger by any means. He
looked a little little off though. Yeah.

2332
02:15:49,950 --> 02:15:54,300
But Keith Thurman had to suffer through
that one little concussion concussed,

2333
02:15:54,390 --> 02:15:58,590
I should say. And he was all right after
that. If you hit him with that same shot,

2334
02:15:58,591 --> 02:16:02,040
he would have took it even better.
Yeah. Because he got over the hump.

2335
02:16:02,070 --> 02:16:06,990
I still get that fight to Lopez though.
A lot of people did. Yeah. Yeah.

2336
02:16:06,991 --> 02:16:11,190
It was a close fight and you know, it
was Thurman's big comeback fight. I mean,

2337
02:16:11,191 --> 02:16:15,060
how long had he been out? Two years at
least. Was He injured? He was injured.

2338
02:16:15,061 --> 02:16:17,670
He had some sort of shuttle
operations elbow or, yeah.

2339
02:16:19,320 --> 02:16:23,610
So you know, but that's also one of the
things that makes it so interesting,

2340
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:24,451
you know?
I mean,

2341
02:16:24,451 --> 02:16:29,380
when and when a guy does come back
from a devastating loss and he'd go,

2342
02:16:29,381 --> 02:16:34,360
okay, like, like Manny Pacquiao
when mark has knocked him out out.

2343
02:16:34,400 --> 02:16:39,040
Ooh, I mean crazy. That was a
bad one. That was a bad one.
Yeah, that was a bad one.

2344
02:16:39,100 --> 02:16:42,820
That's going to cause some slurring
later. Maybe it's like, you know,

2345
02:16:42,821 --> 02:16:44,980
you make a move,
it's a good move,

2346
02:16:45,370 --> 02:16:49,750
but then you've moved into the man's
power punch and he hits you and you know,

2347
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:54,370
there's no second chance with
that one. Yeah. And uh, mark has,

2348
02:16:54,970 --> 02:16:59,350
I mean he's a, he's an interesting
case, you know what I mean?

2349
02:16:59,351 --> 02:17:04,090
He's a obviously a very, very
talented fighter, but as he got older,

2350
02:17:04,091 --> 02:17:07,630
he got like physically stronger. He
got bigger and stronger. You know,

2351
02:17:08,470 --> 02:17:11,530
Mexican supplements can
meet a lot involved.

2352
02:17:11,531 --> 02:17:16,180
Clem mood around meat monkey
juice. There's a lot involved
there. Right. I mean,

2353
02:17:16,210 --> 02:17:20,440
and he actually was working with Manny
Pacquiao is old strength and conditioning

2354
02:17:20,441 --> 02:17:23,150
guy and man, he was the guy who was
always accused of doing stuff. Oh,

2355
02:17:23,160 --> 02:17:24,290
you're talking about Alex or,
yeah,

2356
02:17:24,430 --> 02:17:27,880
I mean Manny went up eight when you had
house or he is a trained me before. Yeah.

2357
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:31,660
When I was doing my special three
years ago. Look at them jacked.

2358
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:36,760
Does he still fighting? No, he's retired.
My cousin's done. Yeah. Good for him.

2359
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:38,800
Cause they're talking about Floyd.
They're doing a,

2360
02:17:38,850 --> 02:17:41,350
they're talking about doing
a Floyd Pacquiao rematch.

2361
02:17:41,410 --> 02:17:44,310
I'm not really excited about that.
You know what I'm excited about?

2362
02:17:44,320 --> 02:17:48,820
I want to see how much money
Floyd Mayweather can make.
I'm excited. I mean, look,

2363
02:17:48,821 --> 02:17:49,540
the fucking,

2364
02:17:49,540 --> 02:17:53,050
the fact that he talked to everybody into
that Conor McGregor fight and he made

2365
02:17:53,051 --> 02:17:54,310
more than a hundred million dollars.

2366
02:17:54,580 --> 02:17:57,560
Isn't that tension kid fighting again
and he's fighting somebody else? No, no.

2367
02:17:57,561 --> 02:17:59,610
Zwickau yeah, he's a, he's a bad ass.

2368
02:17:59,620 --> 02:18:03,190
Ain't nobody's supposed to be fighting
another, uh, another boxer. Yeah.

2369
02:18:03,940 --> 02:18:06,270
I think you're right. Probably
a lesser one. But you know,

2370
02:18:06,940 --> 02:18:09,920
tension is 126 pounds.
Yeah.

2371
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,870
So we should find somebody that's mean
the fact that he fought Mayweather at all

2372
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:16,300
and people are like, oh it looks
like it was a fake fight. No,

2373
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:19,270
that's what it looks like
when 126 pound fighter fights.

2374
02:18:19,450 --> 02:18:22,960
One of the best boxers of all time.
Yeah, that's what it looks like.

2375
02:18:22,961 --> 02:18:23,771
They don't look fake.

2376
02:18:23,771 --> 02:18:28,510
He did fall very dramatically cause
he cut his fucking praying rattled,

2377
02:18:28,990 --> 02:18:33,470
you know? Oh it's daunting. Oh my God.

2378
02:18:33,690 --> 02:18:35,200
They can't make that
weight anymore either.

2379
02:18:35,270 --> 02:18:36,880
Drawn to kind of make
the weight he's at now,

2380
02:18:36,910 --> 02:18:40,780
but they don't have them make
weight. That's the thing.
They just have them fight.

2381
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:44,750
I mean Floyd didn't make any fucking
wait did he? What'd you like?

2382
02:18:44,880 --> 02:18:49,000
Do you like the way one fc is doing their
weight thing? Yes. I like the clot. Yeah.

2383
02:18:49,001 --> 02:18:52,900
For people don't know. They don't let
them cut weight. They, they, they,

2384
02:18:52,920 --> 02:18:56,110
they do hydration tests.
So there's no dehydrating yourself.

2385
02:18:56,320 --> 02:18:59,680
So if you weighed natural,
you walk around 185 pounds,

2386
02:18:59,890 --> 02:19:01,420
you're going to fight it 185 pounds.

2387
02:19:01,421 --> 02:19:04,810
You're not going to fight at one 70
or one 65 like a lot of these guys do.

2388
02:19:05,080 --> 02:19:07,640
That's good. Yeah, I'd love,
yeah, that's good because, uh,

2389
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:10,840
the hydration aspect of even in any sport,

2390
02:19:11,320 --> 02:19:15,880
taking that liquid away from the
brain. Yeah. Your body needs liquid.

2391
02:19:16,150 --> 02:19:19,450
Yeah. It's a vibes on liquids
and it makes your bones brittle.

2392
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,290
It's terrible for you in every way.
It's terrible for your performance,

2393
02:19:23,291 --> 02:19:24,240
your internal organs.

2394
02:19:24,241 --> 02:19:27,010
A lot of guys have kidney failure
when they're cutting away for Wayne's.

2395
02:19:27,320 --> 02:19:28,040
That's the beautiful thing

2396
02:19:28,040 --> 02:19:32,270
about you being a heavyweight. Right.
I didn't have to take off my clothes.

2397
02:19:32,271 --> 02:19:33,530
I can weigh whatever,

2398
02:19:33,531 --> 02:19:37,610
but there was always that fighting weight
where I would be perfect that Manny

2399
02:19:37,611 --> 02:19:40,520
was good at that. Yeah, I'm
sure way. Okay. Don't move.

2400
02:19:40,850 --> 02:19:45,850
Don't move from there to 42 35 to
35 was a perfect knew you were on.

2401
02:19:47,930 --> 02:19:49,850
Yup. Yeah. Now what kind of,

2402
02:19:49,851 --> 02:19:52,730
what kind of nutrition did you
follow when you're fighting? Did you,

2403
02:19:52,970 --> 02:19:57,730
did you take specific vitamins
or any specific things? No,

2404
02:19:58,710 --> 02:20:02,600
just a Jamaican food. Jamaican
food. Yeah. Uh, Angelo,

2405
02:20:02,601 --> 02:20:06,350
Dundee asked me that same question.
Yeah. I said, what do you eat? I said,

2406
02:20:06,351 --> 02:20:09,830
my mother's food. He said, if it,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

2407
02:20:13,880 --> 02:20:17,660
That's a perfect Angelo Dundee quote.
Yep. Yeah. He's another one man.

2408
02:20:17,661 --> 02:20:20,750
Remember that in there with the sugar
ray Leonard Against Thomas Turns.

2409
02:20:20,870 --> 02:20:23,770
You're blowing at kid and he gets,
she should write a letter.

2410
02:20:23,771 --> 02:20:26,030
I get fired up and he goes out
and stop some of the next round.

2411
02:20:26,120 --> 02:20:30,920
If there was a lot of good trainers back.
Georgie Benton Benton.

2412
02:20:30,921 --> 02:20:33,440
Yeah. Bless his soul. Good
for good train as well.

2413
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:36,740
It's so important for a young fighter
to get hooked up with the right trainer.

2414
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:39,320
Right. You know, we got
on that for a second.

2415
02:20:39,321 --> 02:20:42,650
I think part of the problem with
a lot of young kids right now,

2416
02:20:42,651 --> 02:20:44,960
they need to get good trainers.
Yeah.

2417
02:20:45,060 --> 02:20:49,250
Good trainers really help
your game because even helps
you with the, with the, uh,

2418
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:51,080
TV because,
um,

2419
02:20:51,140 --> 02:20:56,000
I was saying today that when
a man came into my corner,

2420
02:20:56,090 --> 02:20:59,420
HBO started talking about me
better before nothing was like, oh,

2421
02:20:59,421 --> 02:21:03,110
he doesn't throw the job and off he
looks like he's tired. The fight.

2422
02:21:03,111 --> 02:21:07,430
When I went with Manny, they
were like praising me. Oh,
he's doing good now, Matt.

2423
02:21:07,431 --> 02:21:10,010
He's my knees behind them now.
He's a trainer of champion.

2424
02:21:10,011 --> 02:21:12,830
So training really helps you your game.

2425
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:18,350
Where are you with Mandy when you fought
Mercer? Yes. That was a war. Yeah.

2426
02:21:18,380 --> 02:21:19,910
That was actually, no, I wasn't,

2427
02:21:20,700 --> 02:21:25,700
I wasn't the immersive fight he actually
taught Mercer helped me out because um,

2428
02:21:26,630 --> 02:21:29,360
before that fight,
I was always fighting guys that hooked,

2429
02:21:29,361 --> 02:21:31,460
hooked around body shots and hooks.

2430
02:21:31,670 --> 02:21:35,150
So I kept my hands like this
other side of my face. Then that,

2431
02:21:35,210 --> 02:21:39,260
and then I went into that
fight, got a fat lip. I hated,

2432
02:21:39,350 --> 02:21:42,380
I hate getting fat lips in my
fights. It's like, you know,

2433
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:46,760
hey you did you win the fight?
Yeah. It didn't look like you.

2434
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:48,620
You got to get a fat lip from,
you know.

2435
02:21:48,710 --> 02:21:52,160
So I kept on walking around with a
fat lip and then I got, you know,

2436
02:21:52,161 --> 02:21:52,994
I got a good picture of,

2437
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,640
you got a good picture of you and me and
Lloyd and you got a fat lip and right.

2438
02:21:56,650 --> 02:22:00,770
That's the, when he fights from like
[inaudible] 97 and then then man, he said,

2439
02:22:00,771 --> 02:22:02,120
you know what you're doing wrong.
He said,

2440
02:22:02,210 --> 02:22:06,530
you need to put your hand in front
of your mouth. I'm like, okay.

2441
02:22:06,920 --> 02:22:11,180
So even if a guy throws a punch,
which slides it doesn't slide through,

2442
02:22:11,181 --> 02:22:12,860
it's going to hit your hand.
And he said,

2443
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:17,170
you can move your hand two inches to
protect yourself from a hook, can't you?

2444
02:22:17,171 --> 02:22:20,150
And I said, yeah. Oh, okay. You're right.

2445
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,530
No more fat lips. Well, I used to

2446
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:29,790
getting fat lips book. Everybody
look at you funny. That's hilarious.

2447
02:22:30,780 --> 02:22:34,110
Well, but having a great trainers, it's,
it's, it's so important in MMA as well.

2448
02:22:34,111 --> 02:22:35,850
I mean it,
and there's not that many of them.

2449
02:22:35,851 --> 02:22:37,650
It's like you really have
to find the right ones.

2450
02:22:37,651 --> 02:22:40,560
You got a good trainers to just former
fighters now. Right? Well there's that.

2451
02:22:40,590 --> 02:22:42,810
Yeah, but you know,
someone has to be a real,

2452
02:22:43,180 --> 02:22:46,560
you can't just be a trainer or
just be a former fighter. Rather,

2453
02:22:46,800 --> 02:22:49,440
you have to be a student to
really understand the game.

2454
02:22:49,441 --> 02:22:53,310
Like a manual was only an amateur fighter.
Right. He never fought professional.

2455
02:22:53,430 --> 02:22:56,070
And he was one of the greatest
of all time. Unquestionably.

2456
02:22:56,520 --> 02:23:00,780
Everybody respected him and so soft
spoken, you know, and just, but just knew,

2457
02:23:00,900 --> 02:23:03,090
just knew how to raise fighters.
And you think about all the guys,

2458
02:23:03,270 --> 02:23:06,450
Jeremy Mclellan, Tommy Hearns, all the
great fighters that came out of that camp.

2459
02:23:06,750 --> 02:23:11,490
The only problem I have with, you know,
old time fighters is like, you know, some,

2460
02:23:11,491 --> 02:23:13,770
some old time fighters were bad fighters.
Now,

2461
02:23:13,850 --> 02:23:18,780
right now the training a young kid the
same way. Right? Not, it's not positive.

2462
02:23:18,820 --> 02:23:21,120
It's like a teaching them the bad tricks.
Yeah.

2463
02:23:21,540 --> 02:23:24,890
But then there's guys who are better as
trainers and they were as far as like a

2464
02:23:24,980 --> 02:23:27,630
roach, 100% yeah. Like
Freddie Roach is recognized.

2465
02:23:27,631 --> 02:23:30,330
One of the greatest trainers for
sure alive, but as a fighter,

2466
02:23:30,331 --> 02:23:31,164
it was a journeyman.

2467
02:23:31,230 --> 02:23:34,660
Kevin Rooney was a good trainer and his
dad and he got knocked up by her quiet

2468
02:23:34,661 --> 02:23:36,900
one second round. Well, he
was a good trainer with Tyson,

2469
02:23:37,170 --> 02:23:38,960
but he never really developed
town outside of the,

2470
02:23:38,980 --> 02:23:41,210
it's developed a lot of alcohol.
That's what so,

2471
02:23:41,230 --> 02:23:45,750
so he don't hang around with Mike and
he's got hires on a leash and then buddy

2472
02:23:45,751 --> 02:23:48,510
had a good run for a minute. Buddy.
Mcgirt he's still training fighters.

2473
02:23:48,580 --> 02:23:52,020
I've tried to buddy before.
Yeah, he was a great fighter,

2474
02:23:52,120 --> 02:23:54,570
but he was a great fighter.
Yeah. Great Dude. Yo,

2475
02:23:54,571 --> 02:23:58,860
you haven't trained with
me at [inaudible]. Uh,

2476
02:23:59,350 --> 02:24:00,210
uh,
listen man,

2477
02:24:00,211 --> 02:24:02,670
your phone keeps blowing up and you were
supposed to be out of here an hour ago,

2478
02:24:02,671 --> 02:24:05,940
but I appreciate your time, man. It was
an honor to sit here and talk to you.

2479
02:24:05,970 --> 02:24:09,230
Thanks for having one of my favorites
of all time appreciated, Russell.

2480
02:24:09,300 --> 02:24:13,980
I like you too. Thanks man. You're my
favorite guy to get choked off, sweetie.

2481
02:24:14,040 --> 02:24:17,100
We're going to have some fun tomorrow.
Jesus. Lennox Lewis, ladies and gentlemen.

2482
02:24:17,130 --> 02:24:17,963
Thank you everybody.

2483
02:24:21,420 --> 02:24:21,950
That was great.
