1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:02,920
Hello Freak bitches.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,200
He's now basically the
ultimate golden snitch.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,330
Now why you say Golden Snitch was golden?

4
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:08,740
Because he's at another level,

5
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:10,120
but he's not a snitch.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:11,050
He's an investigator.

7
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:11,320
Yeah.

8
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,540
He's not like a garnish evolve.

9
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,380
A snitch will be Victor Conte.

10
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:15,910
Victor Conte is a snitch.

11
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:17,490
He got content on top,

12
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,950
but he didn't even rat on
people when he got caught you.

13
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:21,070
He can't even call him a snitch.

14
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,200
You call them a postoperative because
he used rats where I come from,

15
00:00:26,201 --> 00:00:26,800
but he's.

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,071
See,

17
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:27,790
here's the thing.

18
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,500
He used to be involved in it.

19
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:30,620
He's not involved in anymore.

20
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,410
Now he's going after people
who are involved with.

21
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:33,783
So what is that?

22
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,790
That's like an informer.

23
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,150
But can I ask you a question?

24
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,100
Did they ever actually.

25
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:39,930
Jamie says yes joe,

26
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:43,570
to kind of be a snitch because he's
really revealing all this backstory like,

27
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,111
well,

28
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,490
I just love this time.

29
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,870
It's fun because it's
really the same thing.

30
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,370
That's what's going on with podcasts.

31
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,110
You guys don't need any sort of account.

32
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,560
You guys kind of have a company though.

33
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:53,470
You kind of have fox.

34
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:53,930
We're,

35
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,130
I mean,

36
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,950
not really because again,

37
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:58,000
they don't tell you what to do.

38
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,570
They can't try and not where they started,

39
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:02,581
but they can't do it.

40
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:03,910
I've actually been so good.

41
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,290
That's what this whole,

42
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,620
they know.

43
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,041
If they're like,

44
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:09,340
hey,

45
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:09,741
don't do that.

46
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:09,941
I'm like,

47
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:11,720
what can I do?

48
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,570
What the thing is like,

49
00:01:13,571 --> 00:01:16,780
you guys have an advantageous
position in the relationship.

50
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:19,320
It's not like a regular show
where they could fire you from it.

51
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:19,570
Yeah.

52
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,470
If they fire you,

53
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:23,020
you will have zero impact,

54
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:27,490
but also it actually helped us because
just tell everyone what went down and I

55
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:30,910
will tell all the dirt
and I will blast picture.

56
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,173
I'm a snitch.

57
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,750
I'm a big skew.

58
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:35,733
Fucking.

59
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:36,930
I've always been a snitch.

60
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,670
I'm that golden snitch.

61
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:42,130
Truth comes out golden

62
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,350
before someone makes a photoshop of
you in the salt liberalize outfit.

63
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,820
Says Golden Snitch,

64
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:49,654
golden snitch.

65
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,150
Somebody made it already.

66
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,140
Jamie made it while working on the show.

67
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,083
Jamie.

68
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,540
We did a lot of direction,

69
00:02:01,541 --> 00:02:01,810
right?

70
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,350
You did.

71
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:02,590
Well,

72
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,750
I ran into you in New York when you
were doing the Chappelle show with

73
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,733
Chappelle.

74
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,400
The very first episode I would work
at the beginning at Dave Chappelle's.

75
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:12,151
Not Crazy.

76
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,950
That's the other thing
that drives me nuts,

77
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,220
you know,

78
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,360
because he walked away,

79
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,390
but I saw those people micromanage
them and drive him nuts.

80
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,680
They were so rude.

81
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,880
Now Dave's not crazy.

82
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:21,570
He's a friend of mine.

83
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,380
I love him.

84
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,041
He's a very,

85
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,940
very brilliant guy.

86
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,410
Very smart and aware.

87
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,290
And how's the Kahunas to do what you said,

88
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:28,740
to quit,

89
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,900
to walk away from 50 million bucks.

90
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,300
I'm uncomfortable saying this story,

91
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:36,030
but just trying to use.

92
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:38,850
Cause I know the
semantics of the language.

93
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,040
I'll just say what happened.

94
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,390
People can make whatever,

95
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,470
but I was.

96
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,180
I was directing the show and white comedy
central executives came down and asked

97
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:48,930
me.

98
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,261
They said,

99
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:52,080
can you tell Dave not
the same nigger so much?

100
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,053
And I said,

101
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:54,810
Dave,

102
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,580
the white comedy Central
Executive in front of them,

103
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,363
the same.

104
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
So much.

105
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,230
Dave goes,

106
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,810
bobcat push off.

107
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,070
What did you say?

108
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,050
It was really weird and
awkward and then they left.

109
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:11,261
Like,

110
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:12,160
I intentionally thought,

111
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,780
well this will be embarrassing for them.

112
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,010
This is exactly what you told me.

113
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,980
Oh good.

114
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,450
Cause because,

115
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:16,830
yeah,

116
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,030
I don't think I've ever heard that story,

117
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:19,370
but yeah,

118
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm a witness to that insanity.

119
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,470
Just sell it,

120
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,000
sell it to the American people.

121
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:25,990
What is wrong,

122
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:28,940
what can be fixed and what can
Gary Johnson do to fix this?

123
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,740
I'll make

124
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,320
a pitch for myself and that is,

125
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:34,960
is that I think I really
am a unique package.

126
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,441
Uh,

127
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:37,420
I am fiscally conservative.

128
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,353
I'm,

129
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm,

130
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,280
I'm as frugal a human
being as you've ever met.

131
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,830
But that doesn't mean that I'm cheap.

132
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,170
It just means that I
spend my money wisely.

133
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:50,560
I got to serve as governor
of New Mexico for two terms.

134
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:51,820
Uh,

135
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,320
I served as governor of New Mexico for
two terms as a Republican in the state

136
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,700
that's two to one democrat.

137
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,730
I got reelected by a bigger margin the
second time than the first time made a

138
00:04:02,831 --> 00:04:06,790
name for myself as a real government
skeptic vetoing legislation.

139
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:10,480
I may have vetoed more legislation than
the other 49 governors in the country

140
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,314
combined.

141
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,970
Coupled with that,

142
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,863
um,

143
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,580
I'm socially tolerant.

144
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,110
I'm socially liberal.

145
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,530
Look,

146
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:22,360
you and I should be able to make decisions
in our own lives that only affect our

147
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:26,830
own lives as long as those decisions
don't adversely affect others.

148
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,270
And then there is a very real
terrorist threat out there.

149
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,460
It exists.

150
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,333
Um,

151
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:38,290
but I do believe that our military
interventions have resulted in making

152
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,610
situations worse,

153
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:40,211
not better.

154
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:44,440
So I'm a real skeptic when it comes to
government and the fact that government

155
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:45,490
is too big.

156
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,141
Uh,

157
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:49,960
I've been an entrepreneur my entire life.

158
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:52,900
I know what it is to hire and fire.

159
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:55,180
I know what it is to share in the profits.

160
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:57,340
And what a magic formula that is,

161
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,960
that when you share in the profits,

162
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:02,800
amazingly the profit
pie grows significantly.

163
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:03,970
Uh,

164
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,220
I've been an athlete my entire life.

165
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,040
Bit of an oxymoron is a 63 year old,

166
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,990
but what athletics has taught me is,

167
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,041
you know,

168
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,950
life is putting one foot
in front of the other.

169
00:05:14,951 --> 00:05:19,060
Athletics has taught me that anything
that can go wrong will go wrong.

170
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:24,280
It's how you deal with failure that
ultimately determines your success.

171
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:25,691
Look,

172
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,190
things go wrong all the time.

173
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,050
You can crawl up on the couch,

174
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,940
you can declare yourself a victim,

175
00:05:30,941 --> 00:05:31,930
you can give up,

176
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:36,220
or you can recognize that that's just
part of life and wake up the next day with

177
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:41,170
a smile on your face and continue to
move forward and just do your best.

178
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,873
I've told,

179
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,440
I've told the truth.

180
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:44,780
Uh,

181
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,370
I think it's really hard to do any damage
to somebody who's willing to tell the

182
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:50,530
truth regardless of the consequences.

183
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,060
And then I admit mistakes.

184
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,700
I think mistakes have a way of.

185
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:59,060
So compounding themselves just because
people don't acknowledge those mistakes.

186
00:05:59,061 --> 00:06:01,460
So given this pitch,

187
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,880
all I want to do is just get in the
polls that determines who is in the

188
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:09,890
presidential debates.

189
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,130
I think that if I'm in
the presidential debates,

190
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:16,640
I have an opportunity of
actually winning because of

191
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,800
this package that you've allowed
me to present here today ago.

192
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:22,630
Thank you.

193
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,520
That's how I act is important.

194
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:25,331
Not what I think.

195
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:27,130
So tell me to keep my thoughts purist.

196
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,311
Like,

197
00:06:27,311 --> 00:06:28,810
my thoughts are mine.

198
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:29,830
They're mine.

199
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,640
I do what I want with them.

200
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,181
That's right.

201
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:32,130
So if you girlfriend,

202
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,670
I was just thinking about
that big country fucker Lego,

203
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,090
a piece a week coming out
of the corner of his mouth,

204
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,020
Nazi Tattoo on the back of his neck.

205
00:06:41,021 --> 00:06:42,760
Just lay in Dick.

206
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,200
God bless her fat Dick.

207
00:06:44,201 --> 00:06:45,010
God bless her.

208
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:45,311
Whatever.

209
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,980
She's into like a sailor's forearm.

210
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,210
I am not asking.

211
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:49,740
Yeah,

212
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:49,920
I mean,

213
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,020
no.

214
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,720
Do you have moments like
in your relationship where
you know you're with each

215
00:06:52,721 --> 00:06:53,770
other for your life?

216
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,380
This is a.

217
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,870
This is a long time thing.

218
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,370
I feel like we ended yet on music.

219
00:06:57,371 --> 00:06:59,050
There's times when you're all of a sudden,

220
00:06:59,051 --> 00:06:59,261
oh no,

221
00:06:59,261 --> 00:06:59,381
no,

222
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:00,214
no,

223
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,643
do it.

224
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,710
Jamie went to get some
incredible hulk walkaway museum

225
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,040
and there's times when you
were into her and that's it.

226
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,850
There's times when there's
times when all of a sudden you,

227
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,630
you,

228
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,990
you about to say this times
and she's not in the EU.

229
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,740
Yes.

230
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,521
Unacceptable.

231
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,354
Walk.

232
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,673
Be a man.

233
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,543
Suck it up.

234
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,810
There's boots.

235
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,500
You know what?

236
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,250
It not that psyched with
me right now with a boner.

237
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,400
You choose to Viagara you
get your Dick hard as a rock.

238
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,990
I'm not saying you don't do those things.

239
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,190
What I'm saying is you don't
ask her why you don't ask what?

240
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,000
What is it like?

241
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
You don't want to know these things.

242
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,610
I don't want to know why she's unhappy.

243
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,223
I want to know.

244
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,710
I just want her to keep
her thoughts to herself.

245
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,520
If she's bang some big
redneck in a truck stop.

246
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:53,790
No,

247
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,151
you don't want.

248
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:54,870
I don't want to do.

249
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,660
You don't want to know if she's
actually being or thinking about being.

250
00:07:57,661 --> 00:07:58,740
I don't want to know anything.

251
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,633
You don't want anything.

252
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,510
Oh No.

253
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,630
What a good husband.

254
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,620
You want her to just be a good mom.

255
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,550
A good wife and eat my bread.

256
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,600
And how about she cooks
something once in a while.

257
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:13,700
Why my baking bread?

258
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,080
Like I'm an old lady.

259
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,760
Why am I running around
with flower on my shirt?

260
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,620
She's sitting on the couch.
