1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:03,180
My daughter Loves Bible stories.

3
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:04,430
Really?

4
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:05,370
I'm an atheist.

5
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,110
You say once upon a time
before you tell them,

6
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:07,351
oh,

7
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:07,650
I know.

8
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,580
She knows that stories.

9
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:08,940
Okay,

10
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,091
yeah.

11
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:10,590
We call him the big invisible guy,

12
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,270
and you go old school,

13
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:12,991
Old Testament,

14
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:13,791
or do you go,

15
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:14,624
we'd do the whole thing.

16
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,320
Oh yeah.

17
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,620
I've told her the story of,

18
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,080
you know,

19
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,100
I'm the guy who's going to kill his
son because the big invisible guy,

20
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,581
I say,

21
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:21,630
making them in an ice cream,

22
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,780
like baking a pie with whipped
cream because you know it's,

23
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,570
that's why you surfing.

24
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:25,740
I don't have a knife to the throat.

25
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:25,951
I mean,

26
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:26,130
she's,

27
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,963
she was four,

28
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,800
but she loves the big
invisible guy stories.

29
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:30,120
She loves the Noah one.

30
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:32,490
She loves the Adam and Eve one
with the snake and the apple.

31
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:32,761
It's all,

32
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:33,150
I mean,

33
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:35,550
these stories that they've
stood the test of time.

34
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:38,230
There's really some of the best stories
around who was going to kill his,

35
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,050
his son was Cain and Abel.

36
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,130
Now Cain and Abel,

37
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:42,450
where the son of Adam and eve,

38
00:00:42,451 --> 00:00:44,280
they were brothers and
they killed each other.

39
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:44,580
Right.

40
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:44,821
I said,

41
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,780
Isaac and Abraham,

42
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,930
Isaac and I go know,

43
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,170
can we have a weapon?

44
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,880
Abraham Abraham was so,

45
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,920
and God is asking him
to kill us on for him.

46
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:56,390
Yeah.

47
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:56,590
Yeah.

48
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:56,881
You know,

49
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:57,660
as I love test.

50
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:57,850
Yeah.

51
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:58,681
Just because you know,

52
00:00:58,681 --> 00:00:59,161
that's how,

53
00:00:59,161 --> 00:00:59,994
you know,

54
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,470
if someone really loves you,

55
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:01,741
like,

56
00:01:01,741 --> 00:01:01,951
you know,

57
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,491
this is why,

58
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,791
you know,

59
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,540
you give this,

60
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,230
um,

61
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:04,970
you give this to your,

62
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:05,611
to your wife,

63
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:05,851
you know,

64
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:06,420
like I would,

65
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,860
I would murder our offspring for you.

66
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:11,130
And that's the hallmark card that really
helps your wife understand how much you

67
00:01:11,131 --> 00:01:11,341
love her.

68
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,720
I'm just an ex boyfriend.

69
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:13,983
I'm earning export,

70
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,350
export from the beat you up.

71
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,183
I'll murder him.

72
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,083
And so,

73
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,130
but,

74
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:21,180
and I'm trying to tell the
stories in a neutral way,

75
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:21,391
right?

76
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:21,840
Like it's like,

77
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,081
again,

78
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:24,270
I had my opinions on all
these stories and all that,

79
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:27,870
but she really likes the stories
and she's a huge fan of Lucifer.

80
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:28,830
Whoa.

81
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,280
I mean,

82
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,660
Lucifer is the guy,

83
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,240
he is like her superhero,

84
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,551
you know,

85
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,470
like he is her mighty
morphin power rangers.

86
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:37,740
She thinks he is just the coolest cause
he's always standing up to big invisible

87
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,011
guy.

88
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:38,281
Right.

89
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:38,890
And,

90
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,360
um,

91
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
because for her prayer is,

92
00:01:41,281 --> 00:01:41,521
you know,

93
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,510
everyone's standing around and say,

94
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:42,871
Oh,

95
00:01:42,871 --> 00:01:43,440
you the best.

96
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,070
Oh you're the best.

97
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:44,790
Oh you're the greatest.

98
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,570
I love you so much.

99
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:46,111
Oh you're the best.

100
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:46,321
You know.

101
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,110
And so,

102
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:47,461
you know,

103
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,280
Lucifer gets kind of tired of that
and leads the rebellion and all that.

104
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,001
Cause you know,

105
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:51,361
I said,

106
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:51,690
you know,

107
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,410
just keep saying it.

108
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:52,711
And she said,

109
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:53,461
I'm getting tired of it.

110
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:53,720
It's like,

111
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:53,820
no,

112
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:53,951
no,

113
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:54,060
no,

114
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,600
I keep saying it because it's an
eternity of saying that to the gate.

115
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,120
Right?

116
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,540
And she's like,

117
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:57,931
Oh man,

118
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,591
I'm really tired.

119
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,221
I want to sit down.

120
00:01:59,221 --> 00:02:01,620
It's like now you know
how Lucifer out of it.

121
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,471
Anyway,

122
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:03,510
so she's got this great,

123
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,040
she's just great song,

124
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,540
which goes basically,

125
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,420
Lucifer was raw hide.

126
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,780
Lucifer was right.

127
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:10,150
You know,

128
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,070
why the songs,

129
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:11,970
and I'm just waiting.

130
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:12,511
Cause you know,

131
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,040
in Canada there's some homeschooling,

132
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,600
which is kind of and
schooling what we were doing,

133
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:16,420
but a lot of them are,

134
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,041
are Christians,

135
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:17,251
right?

136
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,340
So we're going to at some point be around
a bunch of Christian kids and she's

137
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,480
going to break into this song.

138
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:24,420
And I'm looking forward to that moment of,

139
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,530
I've tried to explain that,

140
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,280
uh,

141
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,660
maybe she's referring to a Beatles song.

142
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,790
I don't know how I completely
bailed on her at that point.

143
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:30,570
I don't know where she gets us.

144
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:30,751
Well,

145
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,630
the real issue is you're going to have
to mingle with those Christian parents.

146
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,610
The real issue when you have children,

147
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:35,880
uh,

148
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,110
besides raising the children,

149
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:38,430
which is of course the primary one,

150
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:42,450
teaching them and everything is dealing
with these other parents and seeing

151
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,140
it's,

152
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,170
it's really weird when I
see people with their kids,

153
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:46,530
you know,

154
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:48,990
see how little they
interact with their kids,

155
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,800
see how like non appreciative
they are of their kids,

156
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:57,390
how they're always distracted or the ring
of cell phones around the playground,

157
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:57,841
you know,

158
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:59,400
like it to throw your cell phone,

159
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,070
go play,

160
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,580
go into stupid Mcdonald's tubes
and go play with your kids.

161
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,730
I know a woman who's a psychologist and
she picks up her kid and she's on her

162
00:03:06,731 --> 00:03:08,010
phone while she's picking the kid up,

163
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,430
the kid trying to talk to her
about school and she's like,

164
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,270
uh Huh.

165
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:10,960
Uh Huh.

166
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,620
Uh Huh.

167
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,460
And she's texting.

168
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,540
It's,

169
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:13,871
you know,

170
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:14,470
I mean you just,

171
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,530
the kid was gone for five hours and
when you pick them up you're texting.

172
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:17,890
Yeah.

173
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:18,231
It's,

174
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:18,461
it's,

175
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,294
so,

176
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,770
it's so attractive to us though.

177
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:21,880
So easy to do.

178
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,110
It's so easy to ignore.

179
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,760
We get so used to,

180
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,091
you know,

181
00:03:25,091 --> 00:03:27,900
the kid being around and we get
so used to our own free time.

182
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,410
Oh my daughter's really good at that.

183
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,100
Sorry to drive it.

184
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,580
She's great.

185
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,031
Cause you know,

186
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,560
like I'm trying to teach your eye contact,

187
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:32,771
right?

188
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,604
Because you know,

189
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,271
when she's a kid,

190
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:34,481
you know,

191
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:36,220
I don't know if they can't
focus when they look at you,

192
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:39,940
but that tell stories like they're just
watching the biggest disco light show on

193
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:42,310
the planet and you're just
like some leaf or something.

194
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:42,760
Right.

195
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,140
And so I tried to remind her,

196
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:44,351
you know,

197
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:45,110
eye contact number,

198
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:45,431
talking,

199
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,001
that kind of stuff.

200
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:46,834
Right.

201
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,920
So the other day of course,

202
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,220
and I,

203
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:48,491
you know,

204
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:49,180
I try,

205
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,811
Oh gel,

206
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,261
I try,

207
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:50,561
you know,

208
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:50,831
and I,

209
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:51,041
you know,

210
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:52,540
but every now and then
like I get donations,

211
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,770
my whole show is just donations,

212
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:53,951
right.

213
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,784
No ads or anything.

214
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:55,730
And so,

215
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:55,990
you know,

216
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,160
when a donation comes in it's like,

217
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:57,401
Ooh,

218
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:57,760
kibble.

219
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:57,941
You know,

220
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,301
like I'm,

221
00:03:58,301 --> 00:03:59,500
I'm like the rat with the pellet,

222
00:03:59,501 --> 00:03:59,950
you know,

223
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,230
people,

224
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:00,761
what did they get?

225
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,800
And I got this little kitchen noise
that comes in cause I'm for anyway,

226
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:04,900
so you know,

227
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,190
the kitchen noise come in.

228
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,990
My daughter was telling me something
really important for her and all that and,

229
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:09,551
and yeah,

230
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,091
she's great.

231
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:10,721
She's like four,

232
00:04:10,721 --> 00:04:10,961
she's like,

233
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,794
Daddy,

234
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:15,490
I can't act like you're absolutely right.

235
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,031
I'm so sorry.

236
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,990
How rude that was of me.

237
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:17,430
I apologize.

238
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,600
That's hilarious.

239
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,170
Yeah,

240
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,360
it's fascinating to watch
their little brains develop,

241
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:21,730
isn't it?

242
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:25,280
Then watch the way they interacted each
other and how they see the world and

243
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,600
realize like that this is
how a person is shaped.

244
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,380
And this is the number one problem
that we have as a race is that we don't

245
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:35,430
respect this process and that we also
don't respect this process in strangers,

246
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,440
especially people that we know are fucked.

247
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,970
People in bad neighborhoods,

248
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:40,410
people in bad circumstances,

249
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:42,120
people in a abusive families.

250
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,710
We know they're fucked and we don't,

251
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:45,030
we don't do anything to stop it.

252
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,140
One thing that I keep harping on
is that if we have a resource,

253
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,070
whether it's oil or gold bean,

254
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,830
we protect that resource and,

255
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,150
and you know we,

256
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,660
we set up laws and we
attach a value to it,

257
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,540
but our number one resource
for sure is human beings.

258
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,490
We have created all that you see,

259
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:04,770
whether it's laptops or buildings or cars,

260
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,360
that's all from a human being.

261
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,280
The best way to ensure that that continues
to go on is to have less losers in

262
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:11,910
the world.

263
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,790
The best way to have less
losers is help out kids,

264
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,810
educate kids,

265
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:20,400
get on the ball with them very early
and do something as a society to protect

266
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:23,360
them primary before we go into wars,

267
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,170
before we go into all this stupid shit
that we do to spying on people's fucking

268
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:30,600
emails and looking into
their cell phone record.

269
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,620
Before you do any of that,

270
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,360
how about you protect kids first?

271
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,420
That should be of primary importance and
it should be like one of those things

272
00:05:36,421 --> 00:05:37,180
where your kid,

273
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,460
you know,

274
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,251
wants to go out and play.

275
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:39,330
Like do have you done your homework?

276
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,380
You haven't done your homework,

277
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:40,980
you can't play.

278
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,060
It's that fucking simple.

279
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,460
You can't have your wars
unless you fixed the kids.

280
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,713
Okay.

281
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,221
Well,

282
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:46,650
and they're,

283
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:48,650
they're so smart.

284
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,161
And I,

285
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:49,581
you know,

286
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:50,061
I was,

287
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:52,070
the humans had a whole bunch of experts,

288
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:53,000
a on my show,

289
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:53,651
uh,

290
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:56,520
which is who talk about
the native intelligence of,

291
00:05:56,521 --> 00:05:57,320
of kids.

292
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,430
Like kids can start doing mathematical
reasoning at seven or eight months of

293
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:01,760
age.

294
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:02,301
They can start,

295
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,040
do using empathy at 14 months.

296
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,570
And my daughter at the age of,

297
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:05,750
uh,

298
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,583
a four,

299
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:09,470
we started playing a game called
subjective versus objective.

300
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,071
You know,

301
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,690
like is this something subjective?

302
00:06:11,691 --> 00:06:14,930
Like I like ice cream or is this something
objective like ice cream is made from

303
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:15,590
milk.

304
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:15,951
And you know,

305
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:17,220
we'd pointed staff as they subject.

306
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:17,871
There were objective,

307
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:18,110
you know,

308
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,750
I liked jazz,

309
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,420
subjective or objective and she's like,

310
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:20,811
Bang,

311
00:06:20,811 --> 00:06:21,644
rattling them off.

312
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,060
The other day she was saying to me,

313
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,660
dad,

314
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:23,901
you know,

315
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,471
we've talked a lot.

316
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,330
She's always asking me about the show.

317
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:26,960
In fact,

318
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,200
I should've been taking notes
because she's asked me all about you,

319
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:30,590
uh,

320
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,610
what's going to be the topic?

321
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,001
And I said,

322
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:32,834
you know what,

323
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,003
I have no idea.

324
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,900
I know it's gonna be
interesting to chat with Joe,

325
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,370
no idea what we're going to talk about.

326
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,200
And that was the best conversation.

327
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:39,371
Yeah,

328
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:39,541
yeah.

329
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,374
She's asked all about,

330
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:40,731
you know,

331
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,980
where you're from and what
you do and she's awesome.

332
00:06:42,981 --> 00:06:45,350
They did buy mixed martial arts
and all that kind of stuff.

333
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,213
And uh,

334
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,180
um,

335
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,240
and so she's going to ask me all the
time and I do some shows on economics and

336
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,500
so we talked a little bit about that,

337
00:06:51,501 --> 00:06:52,090
you know,

338
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:52,970
get money and all that.

339
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:54,700
And I diagram stuff out for her to,

340
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:55,800
and she gets it really.

341
00:06:55,801 --> 00:06:58,070
We've gone through the whole history
of the Second World War the other day.

342
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:58,461
She says,

343
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:58,641
you know,

344
00:06:58,641 --> 00:06:59,474
my Daddy,

345
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,340
I think I've decided why I want to do,

346
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,740
I think when I get bigger,

347
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,650
I think I just like to work at it.

348
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,830
I want to be the government.

349
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,100
I'd love to be the
government because I just,

350
00:07:10,101 --> 00:07:12,230
I want to type whatever I
wanted to my bank account.

351
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,790
And I was just like,

352
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:14,270
wow,

353
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,710
you just nailed the Federal Reserve.

354
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,990
Like right there in a nutshell,

355
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,870
whatever I want into my bank account.

356
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,880
[inaudible] your old logic but perfect.

357
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,603
That is what it is.

358
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,730
They can print their own money.

359
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,240
Yeah.

360
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,661
It's beautiful.

361
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,494
Great system.

362
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,240
Yeah.

363
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:28,951
No and I and I,

364
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:31,070
I come out of the sort
of libertarian world,

365
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,281
right?

366
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:35,570
So I mean I'm an anarchist but I
come out of the libertarian world and

367
00:07:35,571 --> 00:07:38,480
Libertarians very much as we talked
about non aggression principle and so on,

368
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,580
and I've been fighting this,

369
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,100
this battle in the libertarian world
and in other worlds as well around,

370
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:43,550
you know,

371
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,230
things is to me is basic a spanking,

372
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:45,670
right?

373
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,090
I wasn't sure,

374
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:47,990
I mean we touched on this,

375
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,993
we

376
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,550
just throw a few stats for the
audience who hasn't seen it before.

377
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,360
More than 90% of parents of toddlers
say they smacked their child.

378
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,093
Toddlers,

379
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,710
60 61% of moms,

380
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:02,420
three to five year olds
have spank their child.

381
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,230
In the past week.

382
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,940
Boys is spanked a lot more than girls.

383
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,280
Boys are also diagnosed with Adhd,

384
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,860
which is one of the symptoms of
spanking a lot more than girls.

385
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,410
Spanking can continue
into the adolescent years.

386
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,990
30 to 40% of people in junior high,

387
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:15,824
kids in junior high.

388
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,210
I still being spanked.

389
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,220
Moms do spank children a
lot more than fathers do.

390
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:22,160
Even controlling for time spent with
kids and all of that kind of stuff.

391
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:22,821
Uh,

392
00:08:22,821 --> 00:08:26,000
economic status doesn't have a
huge amount to do with spanking,

393
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:26,811
but culture does.

394
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:29,990
So African Americans a do a do
a lot more corporate punishment.

395
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:30,670
Uh,

396
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:34,070
religious conservative fundamentalists
do a lot more corporal punishment and so

397
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:34,880
on.

398
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,460
And this to me is such
a fundamental thing.

399
00:08:37,461 --> 00:08:40,310
I'm very much for philosophy
that you can do philosophy,

400
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:42,210
that you can act on
values that you can do.

401
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:42,450
Yeah,

402
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,520
I don't like the Federal Reserve.

403
00:08:43,521 --> 00:08:46,670
I think central banking is a monstrous
cancer in the eyeball of society,

404
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,970
but I can't really do much about it
other than rant and rave about it.

405
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,901
But we kept,

406
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:51,621
what we can do is,

407
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:51,891
you know,

408
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:53,720
do some basics like stop hitting kids.

409
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:53,901
You know,

410
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,160
that to me it's a very fundamental,

411
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,020
and in the libertarian community
that's a challenge lot.

412
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,883
A lot of um,

413
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,440
religious conservatives in the
libertarian community as you know,

414
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:02,274
like on the,

415
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,840
on the right or wrong republicans,

416
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:05,530
there tend to be more
religious people on the left,

417
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:08,280
a secularist less religious people
but more socialists and so on.

418
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,530
And it is really tough,

419
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:10,741
you know,

420
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,360
to just get that basic thing across.

421
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:15,990
We tell kids not to hit each other
and we hit kids and we've all,

422
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:17,220
I don't know if you out there,

423
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,420
you see bad parenting sometimes
when you're out and you act,

424
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,341
you actually,

425
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,710
and I'll usually say something to
the parents because I don't mind my,

426
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,620
my Aa,

427
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:24,450
I think it's the right thing to do.

428
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,900
I don't want my daughter to see me be
all about the ethics and then not talk to

429
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,651
people doing something wrong.

430
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,890
But you can see parents hit kids
saying don't hit your sister.

431
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,880
And that the fact that they can do that
without their heads exploding from this

432
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:39,180
wormhole contradiction of
Pretzel logic is just astounding.

433
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,441
But it is something,

434
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:42,720
we still have a long way to go in.

435
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,370
I think we're kind of
slowly getting there,

436
00:09:44,371 --> 00:09:46,710
but we have a long way to go
and just let's not hit kids.

437
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:46,780
Yeah.

438
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,580
I think how much of the world
would change if we didn't do that?

439
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,430
I think we would be virtually
unrecognizable as a culture.

440
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,510
I couldn't agree more.

441
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:54,841
You know,

442
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,420
I read this article recently
on my message board.

443
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:57,800
Uh,

444
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,860
I don't have it in front of me,

445
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:00,390
so I apologize to whoever posted it,

446
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,670
but it was about a man who got stuck in
the financial system of divorce and it

447
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,750
was from his perspective,

448
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,500
he committed suicide,

449
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,460
lit himself on fire.

450
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,730
I started reading his perspective and
they came to his house and he had his

451
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,120
initial issue because he slapped his
daughter in the mouse so hard that her

452
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,050
mouth was bleeding.

453
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,930
And he did it because
she was licking his hand.

454
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,160
She kept licking his hands,

455
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:24,750
so he slapped her in the
mouth til her mouth was,

456
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,150
and then everything I,

457
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,261
I,

458
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:27,570
I stopped reading right there.

459
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:27,931
I'm like,

460
00:10:27,931 --> 00:10:28,950
I don't want to know this guy.

461
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't,

462
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,291
I,

463
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:33,480
I'm sad that he was so fucked
up that he committed suicide.

464
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,460
But if I saw a guy slap his daughter
in the face because she was licking his

465
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:39,030
hand,

466
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,430
I would have to really suppress
my urge to strangle him.

467
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:41,940
Yeah.

468
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,690
I mean,

469
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:43,920
that's violence.

470
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,590
That's violence to someone who
cannot defend themselves leaf.

471
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,563
Not only that,

472
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,910
not only that,

473
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:50,340
it's,

474
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,340
it's fundamentally the most fucked up
kind of violence because you're doing it

475
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:59,250
to a developing human being
who you allegedly love.

476
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:02,310
You're teaching them the violence is
a part of life by the people that they

477
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,210
respect the most,

478
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,620
and that it can be done to you at any
time when you don't agree with whatever

479
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:09,330
fucking guidelines and
rules they've set up,

480
00:11:09,331 --> 00:11:10,410
like licking your hand.

481
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:11,340
And my daughter was licking my hand.

482
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:12,420
I'd be laughing my ass off.

483
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:12,691
I would think.

484
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:14,100
It's so funny I do that.

485
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,360
I'd smack her in the mouth.

486
00:11:15,361 --> 00:11:16,920
It just fucking insane.

487
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,993
But people,

488
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,390
they fall into this pattern
and they don't know.

489
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,180
Don't realize that violence is violence
just because you're not going to hurt

490
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:24,971
the kid that bad.

491
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,120
They're just going to spank him
and you think it's no big deal.

492
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:27,691
Fuck yeah,

493
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:29,160
it's a big deal because that kid,

494
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:30,630
it's a horrific situation.

495
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,160
You're doing something
that they can't control.

496
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:33,210
Your holding their arm,

497
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:37,110
they're moving their body and then this
big hand comes in slaps their ass and

498
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,620
they feel pain and they feel confused
cause you've acted out against them.

499
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,180
You've not only acted out against him,

500
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:46,470
you've done it aggressively yelling
at slapping and it's a terrible,

501
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,900
it's terrible precedent to set a terrible
idea to plant in a child's mind and

502
00:11:51,901 --> 00:11:52,830
it's unnecessary.

503
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:56,680
It's just not necessary for you to tell
me that you can't sit down and reason

504
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,270
with your child and do
it with love and the,

505
00:11:59,271 --> 00:11:59,471
yeah,

506
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,420
they're going to freak
out and fucking flail.

507
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:05,110
Sometimes they get mad and yell and
that's because they're a fucking child.

508
00:12:05,111 --> 00:12:06,550
You piece of Shit,

509
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,810
you don't smack them.

510
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:08,441
You know,

511
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,030
you just need someone for being short,

512
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,231
pitting your friends.

513
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,390
It's like hitting your for I don't be,

514
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:13,660
don't hit anybody man.

515
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,251
Well,

516
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:14,640
and,

517
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,570
and in particular,

518
00:12:15,571 --> 00:12:15,841
you know,

519
00:12:15,841 --> 00:12:19,650
the moral concentration of
like black hearted nastiness,

520
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,310
you know,

521
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,143
you hit your wife,

522
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,670
she,

523
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,710
she got to date you.

524
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:23,371
She got to,

525
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:23,760
you know,

526
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,990
you had an engagement.

527
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:25,231
She,

528
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:25,531
you know,

529
00:12:25,531 --> 00:12:25,810
she,

530
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,570
she chose you and you chose her,

531
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,070
but if you hit your wife,

532
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:31,250
she at least had to do you
get to test drive you shit,

533
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:31,860
you know,

534
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,050
and then she can leave at anytime.

535
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,901
She's an adult,

536
00:12:33,901 --> 00:12:34,930
she's got shelters,

537
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:35,850
she's got whatever.

538
00:12:35,851 --> 00:12:36,690
People will help her,

539
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,520
hopefully.

540
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,930
But kids that didn't
choose you as parents,

541
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:40,590
you know,

542
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,380
and they can't leave and
they have no options.

543
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,191
And I say this,

544
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:44,611
my daughter,

545
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:44,811
you know,

546
00:12:44,811 --> 00:12:45,211
I say,

547
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:46,044
um,

548
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:46,441
I say,

549
00:12:46,441 --> 00:12:47,670
I know you're not here by choice.

550
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,600
You know,

551
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,610
you didn't choose me as the
day I choose to have kids.

552
00:12:50,611 --> 00:12:50,851
I didn't,

553
00:12:50,851 --> 00:12:51,900
you didn't choose me as a dad.

554
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:54,870
The way I have to parent
is I want to parent.

555
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:55,081
Like,

556
00:12:55,081 --> 00:12:58,440
if my daughter did have a choice of any
doubt in the world that she would choose

557
00:12:58,441 --> 00:12:59,520
me like,

558
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:01,950
and so I imagine these all day long.

559
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,611
Absolutely.

560
00:13:02,611 --> 00:13:02,831
And,

561
00:13:02,831 --> 00:13:03,664
and,

562
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,531
and,

563
00:13:04,531 --> 00:13:04,741
and,

564
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:06,000
and what about feedback?

565
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:06,241
You know,

566
00:13:06,241 --> 00:13:09,360
and I go to my local pizza joint
half the time I have to fill out.

567
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,460
Why don't they give me this
comment card to fill out,

568
00:13:11,461 --> 00:13:11,701
you know,

569
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:12,720
how did you like the pizza?

570
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:12,931
You know,

571
00:13:12,931 --> 00:13:13,790
what's good for you?

572
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,521
Was it bad for you?

573
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:14,780
You know,

574
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,600
they wanna know they wanna have good
pizza and how many times the parents do

575
00:13:18,601 --> 00:13:19,440
that with their kids say,

576
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:20,100
how am I doing,

577
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,431
you know,

578
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:22,110
how's your experience of my parenting?

579
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:22,350
You know,

580
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,220
what's more important slice of pizza or
your relationship with your offspring.

581
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:26,431
You know,

582
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,570
ask them how you're doing.

583
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,950
How could they have been better?

584
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:29,761
What did I do that,

585
00:13:29,761 --> 00:13:30,301
that you liked?

586
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:31,590
What did I do that you didn't like?

587
00:13:31,591 --> 00:13:32,011
And all that.

588
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:33,120
Get that kind of feedback.

589
00:13:33,121 --> 00:13:33,720
I don't know.

590
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,750
It's just weird that we don't
even think of doing that.

591
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:36,931
Well,

592
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:40,320
I think your perspective is very unique
in the fact that you are a stay at home

593
00:13:40,321 --> 00:13:43,320
dad and you do have the
resources to be able to do that.

594
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:43,820
It's,

595
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,090
it's,

596
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,540
it's really hard for a lot of people.

597
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,740
And that's while you were
talking about before,

598
00:13:46,741 --> 00:13:48,030
that number's pretty crazy.

599
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,320
The 20 minutes a week.

600
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:50,640
I didn't know that it was that low,

601
00:13:50,641 --> 00:13:52,320
but honestly,

602
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,490
not shocked.

603
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,840
I don't have a regular life,

604
00:13:54,841 --> 00:13:56,340
but I've dabbled in regular life,

605
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:56,790
you know,

606
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,680
I've had like jobs that take me away
for a long period of time during the day

607
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,460
and I could only imagine what kind of
energy you have to devote to a kid.

608
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,301
If the mother,

609
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:09,900
both the mother and the father
both leave the house all day long,

610
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:11,550
work an eight hour day and then come home.

611
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,413
How much is left?

612
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,580
There's not even much time
the kid's going to be awake.

613
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,120
Yeah.

614
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,470
How much energy do you have left?

615
00:14:16,471 --> 00:14:18,690
How much focus or you're putting
on that kid during the day

616
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,121
and,

617
00:14:19,121 --> 00:14:19,970
and we have this,

618
00:14:19,971 --> 00:14:21,230
I'll get a couple more stats.

619
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:22,064
Um,

620
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,750
we have this idea that the moms have
to be there and the dads can be there.

621
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:31,370
But a study conducted by Dr. Kyle Pruitt
found that infants between seven and 30

622
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:34,100
months respond more favorably to
being picked up by their fathers.

623
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:37,820
He also found a father's parenting style
is beneficial for a child's physical,

624
00:14:37,821 --> 00:14:40,730
cognitive and emotional
and behavioral development.

625
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:43,610
Mothers tend to reassure toddlers when
they become frustrated while fathers

626
00:14:43,611 --> 00:14:45,620
encouraged them to
manage their frustration.

627
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,090
And my daughter's like this,

628
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:48,530
so she's learning to do
all these things and,

629
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,150
and most of her friends
are older cause you know,

630
00:14:50,151 --> 00:14:51,710
we're not the youngest on the block.

631
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,740
And so a lot of her friends can
do stuff better than she can.

632
00:14:54,741 --> 00:14:57,680
She gets frustrated and me helping her
talk it through that frustration and

633
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:00,650
reminding her that I didn't know
how to do this stuff and you know,

634
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,620
she's trying to do racket sports and I
remember took me years to become good at

635
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,280
racket sports.

636
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,000
So,

637
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,121
uh,

638
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:06,890
so that's important for,

639
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,060
for kids as well.

640
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:08,630
I mean,

641
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,650
it's really important to remember,

642
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:09,951
you know,

643
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:10,520
the,

644
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,360
the mom and the kid,

645
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:13,040
they used to be the same freaking person,

646
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:13,761
you know,

647
00:15:13,761 --> 00:15:15,200
like she grew her,

648
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:15,790
they were like this,

649
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,000
it's like my arm,

650
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:17,271
you know,

651
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:18,290
it's not like a separate thing.

652
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,630
Whereas they had to have a little
bit more objectivity around that.

653
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,140
A longer term study that this guy
did to prove that a father's active

654
00:15:24,141 --> 00:15:27,080
involvement with his kids from birth to
adolescence promotes greater emotional

655
00:15:27,081 --> 00:15:27,411
balance,

656
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:28,490
stronger curiosity,

657
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,590
a stronger sense of self assurance,

658
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,740
additional studies during the
first five years of a child's life.

659
00:15:33,741 --> 00:15:37,190
The father's role is more influential
than the mothers in how the child learns

660
00:15:37,191 --> 00:15:38,300
to manage his or her body,

661
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:39,170
navigate social,

662
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:39,571
social,

663
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,030
social circumstances in play.

664
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,710
And the last one is this.

665
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:45,920
The 1996 study that I was referring
to before by Mcgill University.

666
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,550
Uh,

667
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:50,180
the single most important childhood
factor in developing empathy is paternal

668
00:15:50,181 --> 00:15:51,530
involvement in childcare.

669
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:54,680
The study further concluded that children
who spend time alone binding but the

670
00:15:54,681 --> 00:15:58,520
children more than twice per week
brought up the most compassionate adults.

671
00:15:58,580 --> 00:15:59,180
Um,

672
00:15:59,180 --> 00:15:59,730
so

673
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,570
how do they measure that?

674
00:16:00,571 --> 00:16:01,620
How's that quantifiable?

675
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:02,790
Um,

676
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:03,570
it seems like a weird,

677
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,400
all of those statistics seemed very odd.

678
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,060
It's like how do you know what caused
the person to have more empathy?

679
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:11,730
How do you know what caused the
person to be able to move better?

680
00:16:11,731 --> 00:16:12,780
And I mean,

681
00:16:12,781 --> 00:16:13,141
how do you,

682
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:13,690
how do you work

683
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:13,961
well,

684
00:16:13,961 --> 00:16:14,830
what they proved that,

685
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,280
again,

686
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,870
it's sort of a many to many relationships.

687
00:16:16,871 --> 00:16:18,670
So they asked the father is,

688
00:16:18,671 --> 00:16:18,881
you know,

689
00:16:18,881 --> 00:16:20,080
how often were you involved in,

690
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:22,930
maybe they even measured them if it's
sort of a life study and then they

691
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:25,900
measured the compassion and then they
measure a whole bunch of other things.

692
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,360
And if the other things don't
change the compassion measure,

693
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,700
but then the parental involvement
is what moves the needle,

694
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,710
then they assume that
that's close to causal.

695
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,380
But isn't the issue also
the parental involvement?

696
00:16:35,381 --> 00:16:37,870
Like say if a father is involved
a lot in the kid's life,

697
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:42,100
he's also probably likely involved in
the relationship with the wife and maybe

698
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,960
their wife would be more happy.

699
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,590
The father and the wife would be more
happy and because of that they would both

700
00:16:47,591 --> 00:16:48,580
be better parents.

701
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,833
So it could,

702
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:53,380
it might not just be that the impact
of having a man around does all these

703
00:16:53,381 --> 00:16:54,520
things and creates an empathy.

704
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:57,340
It might be the impact of having
a successful family as well.

705
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:57,980
Right,

706
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,440
right.

707
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,390
And that certainly is true.

708
00:16:59,391 --> 00:16:59,751
And again,

709
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,010
I didn't run the studies.

710
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,000
I assume that they've tried,

711
00:17:02,001 --> 00:17:03,020
like whenever you questioned this,

712
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,150
always tried to tease it
out this way or that way,

713
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:05,480
and they,

714
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,980
they to try to find that answer.

715
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:07,910
Um,

716
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,580
but I do think that compassion,

717
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:12,710
again,

718
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,011
you know,

719
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:13,281
I mean,

720
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:13,501
you,

721
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:14,061
your marriage,

722
00:17:14,061 --> 00:17:14,420
you've got,

723
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:17,120
you've got kids floating around
and all that and floating,

724
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:17,973
but there,

725
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,980
but they were floating at one point and
then they came out through the magic

726
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:22,814
chamber.

727
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,121
Uh,

728
00:17:23,121 --> 00:17:23,421
but,

729
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:23,571
uh,

730
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,111
I think,

731
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:24,410
you know,

732
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:24,651
I mean,

733
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:27,590
my wife's skills as a
parent are fantastic and,

734
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,070
um,

735
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,370
but,

736
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,080
but there are some differences between us,

737
00:17:30,081 --> 00:17:30,351
you know,

738
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,810
and I don't know whether it's biological
or whether it's just the way we were

739
00:17:32,811 --> 00:17:33,531
raised or whatever,

740
00:17:33,531 --> 00:17:33,801
but,

741
00:17:33,801 --> 00:17:34,420
uh,

742
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:34,700
you know,

743
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,630
I encourage more risk taking a,

744
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:37,070
I'm,

745
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:37,671
I encourage,

746
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:38,120
you know,

747
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,140
if you fall off the horse,

748
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,040
get back up and again,

749
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:40,580
kind of stuff.

750
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,050
And I think that's just sort of,

751
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:43,340
kind of a natural kind of difference.

752
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:43,661
And,

753
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:44,000
um,

754
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,830
I'm also more encouraging of,

755
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:46,011
you know,

756
00:17:46,011 --> 00:17:48,200
my daughter is like crazy frenzy.

757
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:51,510
I keep thinking she's going to go up to
someone sometimes an unfriendly world,

758
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:52,860
like a cheese up to a greater,

759
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:53,111
you know,

760
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:54,360
we're just kind of get shredded because,

761
00:17:54,361 --> 00:17:54,571
you know,

762
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:56,610
we go places and she just
goes up to kids and says,

763
00:17:56,611 --> 00:17:56,821
hi,

764
00:17:56,821 --> 00:17:57,690
would you like to be friends?

765
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,780
And I was cool.

766
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,613
Fantastic.

767
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:00,910
You know,

768
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,950
the old people up a little,

769
00:18:01,951 --> 00:18:02,220
you know,

770
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,401
oh,

771
00:18:02,401 --> 00:18:02,821
I love it.

772
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:03,211
Wouldn't that be,

773
00:18:03,211 --> 00:18:04,380
everybody was on ecstasy.

774
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:05,900
That's how we would
interact with each other.

775
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:15,920
Okay.
