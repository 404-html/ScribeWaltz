1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,630
We smoke weed,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,300
we're elaborating.
I asked should we smoke weed right when 

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:09,560
Jamie gave me the.
The,

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:10,600
the gun sign.
What's up,

5
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:11,320
brother?
Good to see you,

6
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:11,830
man.
Yeah,

7
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,460
you too,
man.

8
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:14,380
It's good to.
It's good to be back.

9
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,840
It's good to have you back.
Yeah.

10
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:20,910
This is warm time though in Toronto.
Like you didn't really want to leave 

11
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:20,910
that,
but you know what,

12
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,970
but I kind of felt like today out here 
was almost the perfect weather anyways.

13
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,010
Like not too oftentimes I'll come out 
here like I'm not a guy who needs to be 

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:30,760
in the heat,
you know,

15
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,910
I'm not one of these people when it 
snows or whatever.

16
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:38,911
Like I'm complaining I can handle it.
I feel like genetically I'm built for 

17
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:39,490
that environment where you're a 
Canadian.

18
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,070
That's right.
Canadian born and bred.

19
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,680
They can deal with it.
So yeah.

20
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:45,540
So I'm not,
I'm not,

21
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,780
you know,
I don't mind.

22
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,510
I don't mind a little bit of the little 
bit of the cold,

23
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:51,010
but today,
here in La,

24
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,560
this is God's.
Whether this is like,

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,590
I think if every day could be exactly 
like this out here,

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,100
there'd be a compelling argument,
but it's those hot days getting into the

27
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:02,420
car and burning.
Am I?

28
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,180
Am I fired up today?
Am I fired up?

29
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,670
This is coffee number three.
All right.

30
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:07,840
Blame,
blame the caffeine.

31
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,160
Did the argument.
There's two arguments,

32
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:14,161
right?
There's the argument is if it's really 

33
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,921
cold out,
you can always dress for the cold when 

34
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:16,921
you can't really dress for the warm.
Yeah,

35
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,860
right.
Undressed,

36
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,320
but you could freeze to death.
It's super hard to heat up to death.

37
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,090
Really fuck up to heat up to the desert,
the desert,

38
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,220
the desert and kill you.
Pretty good to go to death valley.

39
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,590
Yeah.
Actually no dude that died like that.

40
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,300
Really?
Yeah.

41
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:37,600
He went on like a sort of a spiritual 
walk about and kind of a thing.

42
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,180
This Guy Evan Tanner who was a UFC 
fighter,

43
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:42,640
former middleweight champion to me.
I've heard that.

44
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,470
Yeah.
He was into,

45
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,540
uh,
these,

46
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:51,030
you know,
these long periods of solitude and 

47
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,060
spiritual quests and he decided to go 
out into the desert and,

48
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,180
you know,
just try to find himself or whatever.

49
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:56,860
I don't know exactly what his purpose 
was,

50
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,390
but when you get out there and it gets 
to like 120 130 degrees,

51
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,750
you,
you get disoriented and he couldn't 

52
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:06,750
figure out where he put his water.
Wow.

53
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,360
Yeah.
He couldn't find where his stuff was.

54
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,780
Funny.
How about that stuff in movies and 

55
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:14,780
whatnot.
Cartoons,

56
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,820
where every time somebody is in the 
desert,

57
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,790
they're seeing a mirage.
What is that about?

58
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:24,210
Well,
you can definitely hallucinate before 

59
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:24,210
you die.
And do you think that that's what that's

60
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,740
predicated on is an actual history of 
people having seen these oasis 

61
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,260
situations?

62
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,400
Well,
you know what it is.

63
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:34,720
You know how when you're driving on the 
road and the road is really hot,

64
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:38,440
it looks like it's wet and it looks like
there's water on the road right from the

65
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,670
heatwave.
Exactly.

66
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,030
That illusion on the road can recreate 
itself,

67
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,450
I'm sure in desert situations and it 
only makes sense.

68
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,820
Right.
And it's what you want to see.

69
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,600
You're like,
no,

70
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,710
you're in rough shape.
You create what you need to see.

71
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,930
Can you manage?
If you did your manager,

72
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:56,830
if you like almost dying and you find 
water,

73
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,070
he'd be like,
yes.

74
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:03,130
I mean I think that's the.
Those are the kinds of moments that make

75
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:08,131
people really truly appreciate life.
And I think that's one of the reasons 

76
00:03:08,131 --> 00:03:11,131
why people in la are so fucking spoiled 
and ridiculous is because they don't 

77
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:15,721
experience real.
Whether it gets a little warm and then 

78
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:15,940
the worst thing they have to do is turn 
the AC on,

79
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,700
but they don't have to shovel their way 
out of snow.

80
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,520
They don't have to drive on slippery 
roads,

81
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,790
they don't have to.
And there's a certain amount of 

82
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,741
community that comes with everybody sort
of bonding together because it's a 

83
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:28,741
blizzard.
Right?

84
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:29,560
You remember those?
Oh yeah,

85
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:31,600
sure.
You need experienced them all the time.

86
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,010
Yeah.
It's kind of a is the kind of situation 

87
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,940
I think where any time as a human being 
you kind of you have,

88
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,920
you lose a little bit of control over a 
situation,

89
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,020
whether it's the weather or something 
else.

90
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,720
You kind of take yourself outside of 
that realm of,

91
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,940
of how we like to compartmentalize 
things.

92
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,430
We'd like to like the epitome of self 
centeredness is being in control of 

93
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:58,531
absolutely every experience you have and
never letting go and the rest of the 

94
00:03:58,531 --> 00:03:58,710
world around you as well.
Yeah.

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,940
Just your experience.
No,

96
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,160
exactly.
You try to control kind of situation and

97
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,420
choosing to live in a place where where 
you know,

98
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:12,421
shit can go wrong or or you can have a 
snow storm or whatever is a.

99
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,750
it's kind of.
It's kind of an element in that is he 

100
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,241
says it's an aspect of losing control 
over the space and so what ends up 

101
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:22,450
happening,
you've got people slip sliding around.

102
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:27,451
You've got a essentially people coming 
to the realization that the planet can 

103
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,580
come kick the shit out of you.
If it wants to know.

104
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,400
I guess an earthquake would work that 
way.

105
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,330
Earthquakes do work that way.
Um,

106
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,650
even a horrible thing like nine slash 11
works that way.

107
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,710
It did when I was in New York,
we filmed fear factor in New York like 

108
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,940
less than a year I think after nine 
slash 11.

109
00:04:45,941 --> 00:04:48,910
It was pretty close to when it happened.
And Man,

110
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,390
it was just such a different vibe.
Everybody was so friendly.

111
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,850
Everybody was so friendly and so nice.
And uh,

112
00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,910
I had a friend who a blacked out.
We were all hanging out in front of this

113
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,370
bar and we stepped outside and a couple 
of them smoke cigarettes and uh,

114
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:07,510
I pulled out a joint.
I go,

115
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:08,960
who wants to get down with this?
And the.

116
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,850
And they're like,
oh good,

117
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,390
let's go there.
Like these producers like agreeably,

118
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,490
we're doing this right,
right.

119
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,650
One of them,
I guess she just doesn't smoke pot or 

120
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:19,650
she just,
for whatever reason,

121
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,800
she took a hit and then you see like her
eyes rolled behind her head and her legs

122
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:28,120
go down and she almost fell like we had 
a catcher passed out.

123
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:29,650
Yeah.
She blacked out from weed.

124
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,860
I mean like,
do you think it was the weed or it was 

125
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,321
just in conjunction with kind of the 
drama of the whole event having 

126
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:38,321
happened?
No,

127
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:43,290
no,
it was definitely the weed because she 

128
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,350
was from La and we flew into film fear 
factor there and she just.

129
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,960
Oh,
okay.

130
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,590
I just had a weird reaction to pot,
whatever it was,

131
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,550
fucking space we need to go.
Anyway,

132
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,530
so we called the first responders,
right?

133
00:05:53,531 --> 00:05:55,570
We call the whatever they call.
I don't know who they called,

134
00:05:55,571 --> 00:06:00,080
paramedics,
firemen up and I swear to God these guys

135
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:04,490
were treated like fucking superheroes,
a fireman and then cops came behind them

136
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:09,491
and everybody was so nice and so 
friendly to him because it was at that 

137
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:11,420
sort of honeymoon period after nine 
slash 11 when you realized,

138
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,190
Hey,
when when shit gets awful,

139
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,470
we need these people,
we have to count on these people.

140
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,210
So people were more friendly in the city
in general and then like really thankful

141
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,040
when the firemen showed up.
Yeah,

142
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:27,041
there certainly is a kind of reset 
button effect when some kind of disaster

143
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:32,681
happens where we,
where people feel like they've lost 

144
00:06:32,681 --> 00:06:33,370
control even for a moment.
It is,

145
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,430
it is dude,
like I'm out here on the highway in la 

146
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,861
or anywhere for that matter and you kind
of have those moments where you're 

147
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:43,430
sitting around looking at all these 
vehicles and wondering how the hell this

148
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,100
shit is staying together.
Like what is like,

149
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:50,270
how is everybody on this path because it
only takes one asshole one.

150
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,840
What percentage of individuals is that 
to like,

151
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,850
screw it up for everyone else,
whether you're flying a goddamn plane 

152
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,451
into a building or swerve in the wrong 
way or looking at your text messages or 

153
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:01,451
whatever it is.

154
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,070
I think uh,
you know,

155
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,220
often we kind of take these disasters 
and we,

156
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,640
we kind of hold them up,
you know,

157
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:12,641
cnn style,
like where you play it over and over 

158
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,611
again when in reality there's an 
argument to be made that the amazing 

159
00:07:15,611 --> 00:07:17,900
part is that it's held together as well 
as it is half the time.

160
00:07:17,901 --> 00:07:19,730
You know what I mean?
That's the argument.

161
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,980
There's a lot of arguments when it comes
to that,

162
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:24,360
but one of them about gun violence,
you know,

163
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:29,570
there's so many.
Showed me a chart the other day of how 

164
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,560
much,
how many people have guns,

165
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:35,860
how many people actually get shot by 
guns and who are the people that are 

166
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,180
getting shot by guns and how many of the
people that are getting shot by guns are

167
00:07:38,181 --> 00:07:40,730
involved in gang violence or criminal 
activity.

168
00:07:40,731 --> 00:07:45,731
And then it boils down to how many P,
I mean that your chances of getting 

169
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:47,870
shot,
your actual chance of getting shot.

170
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,930
Like do we really have a gun problem or 
do we have a numbers problem?

171
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:54,320
And it really,
if you look at the hard raw facts,

172
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,220
it's way more of a numbers problem.
It's a 300 million people problem.

173
00:07:58,221 --> 00:08:03,221
That's what it is.
And if you look at the actual number of 

174
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:05,180
guns versus the number of gun incidents,
it's shockingly low.

175
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:10,510
But it's just we're dealing with so many
human beings and that those numbers just

176
00:08:11,511 --> 00:08:13,120
seem.
When I don't,

177
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:18,220
I just don't think human beings are 
supposed to have access to 7 billion 

178
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,210
human beings on earth.
Worth of drama and stories,

179
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,060
you know?
Yeah.

180
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,070
You know,
when,

181
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,740
when it comes back to the,
to the gun situation,

182
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:28,980
I think that there's,
you know,

183
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,040
the issue there,
the way I see it as like,

184
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,100
it's a communication issue in that I 
think you've got these different groups 

185
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:40,571
picking a side on it.
It is sort of relative to their 

186
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:43,121
personal,
their personal experience and how 

187
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:43,121
they've been affected by it.
Sure.

188
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:45,440
As opposed to big picture like what's 
actually happening.

189
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:49,670
And inevitably what will happen is 
you'll have some kind of a,

190
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:55,120
some kind of columbine situation and all
of a sudden everybody cares because of 

191
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,070
the type of people affected by it

192
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,160
of course.
But then half the year when it's a 

193
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,291
different,
a different group of people shooting 

194
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,361
each other,
then it's not making headline news in 

195
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:06,570
the same fashion.
So I think it's a lot more segmented.

196
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:11,571
I think that those issues of affecting 
certain communities are more community 

197
00:09:11,571 --> 00:09:14,730
issues than they are national issues.
You know what I'm saying?

198
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,480
Oh,
they definitely are.

199
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:20,481
Yeah.
Like look at Chicago and Chicago is 

200
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:20,481
close to you guys.
Yeah,

201
00:09:20,481 --> 00:09:20,600
very much so.
Um,

202
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,600
and,
and the thing,

203
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,850
the weird thing about Chicago is it's 
really nice,

204
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,920
like beautiful if you're in the right 
spot.

205
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,200
Yeah.
It's like it's one,

206
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,350
one set of circumstances and then on the
other side of some imaginary line,

207
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,380
it's a different set of circumstances.
Murder rate is up more than 70 percent 

208
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,760
this year from last year.
Last year was insane.

209
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,040
At least that's what I read.
I mean,

210
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:41,630
it sounds,
I,

211
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,810
I keep hearing about it.

212
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:48,300
It's terrible.
There was some kind of a blog I was 

213
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,571
reading which was like based on 
infographics and all this guy does the 

214
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:53,550
entire blog is just following Chicago 
violence as the whole thing.

215
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:58,551
And he had it all mapped out.
He had a every single shooting fatal 

216
00:09:58,551 --> 00:10:03,021
shooting where the person was hit.
It's like an amazing amount of detail 

217
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:03,600
that went into,
on this particular blog.

218
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,570
I'm 72 percent is soared.
Seventy two percent.

219
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,900
Two thousand 16 shootings up more than 
80 percent.

220
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,420
80 eight percent.
Wow.

221
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,250
That is insane.
So murder up 72 percent,

222
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:19,251
shootings up 88 percent the first three 
months of 2016 compared to the same 

223
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:21,270
period last year.
Fuck man.

224
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,410
There was a video that this guy did.
He was live his neighborhood and he got 

225
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:26,520
shot on video.
Did you see that?

226
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,110
It's fucked up.
He just hanging out there,

227
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,340
you know,
walking around and I don't know what he 

228
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,431
was saying,
but he was filming something and all of 

229
00:10:37,431 --> 00:10:39,231
a sudden you see him drop and then you 
see the shooter standing over him 

230
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,470
shooting at somebody else.
This is fucking crazy.

231
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,020
Yeah.
Know we look at it like Juarez.

232
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,190
Mexico.
Here it is.

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,620
It.
So this guy is hanging out here.

234
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,970
At least I'm going to duck for cover.
Is that what he's saying?

235
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,510
So he's listening to music.

236
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,300
Hey pops tobacco for the kid.

237
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,140
So He's wandering around.
Yep.

238
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,420
Someone just shot up what?
The Sky on loaded the whole clip.

239
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,740
Crazy.
And that guy survived.

240
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,990
Now that guy's dead as fuck.
Oh right.

241
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,400
Well that's weird watching somebody die.
Not really into that.

242
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,970
I mean I assume he's dead.
I felt like if that guy kept shooting 

243
00:11:37,971 --> 00:11:38,680
like that,
it's probably,

244
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,840
his work was done.
That's what it sure seemed like.

245
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:44,750
But the weird thing is it looked like he
was shooting over top of him.

246
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,760
Did he die?
He was in critical condition.

247
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,100
Oh.
So by now you might be,

248
00:11:49,101 --> 00:11:53,260
but you might have also survive.
That place is a war zone.

249
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:53,980
Yeah,
it's,

250
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,270
it's weird.
And I think,

251
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,720
I think at this point we've got enough 
evidence to realize that at some root 

252
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,160
level we are still animals and when it 
comes to vengeance or revenge,

253
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,860
everybody's susceptible.
If you brother,

254
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:12,070
your neighbor gets killed or you're 
somebody you care about,

255
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,930
you just want to go and do the same 
thing,

256
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:18,931
you know,
and whether it's in Chicago or it's in 

257
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:18,931
the Middle East or wherever it happens 
to be.

258
00:12:18,931 --> 00:12:19,450
People who have been doing it.
You know,

259
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,140
I was,
um,

260
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,040
I was,
I don't remember who I was talking to 

261
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,040
about this,
but uh,

262
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,070
it was,
it was regarding whether or not more 

263
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,081
humans were responsible for killing 
other humans in modern history or 

264
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:32,560
disease.
Like which one was the bigger figure.

265
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,700
And I'm sitting there thinking about it 
like I couldn't,

266
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:38,440
I didn't know,
but when I looked it up,

267
00:12:38,441 --> 00:12:43,441
it was like shocking figures in the 
direction of humans killing humans.

268
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,870
If you're including all the wars that 
have ever happened,

269
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,290
millions of people that have died.
But this is modern,

270
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,570
modern history over time.
Who knows?

271
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,870
But I don't know if it was on a 
wikipedia page or something.

272
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,750
No,
the craziest,

273
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,780
craziest statistics I've ever heard 
about a human's dying was that half of 

274
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,220
all the people that have ever died,
ever were killed by malaria mosquitoes.

275
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,710
The most dangerous animal on the planet.
Fucking malaria,

276
00:13:05,711 --> 00:13:07,240
man.
I know a dude is added more than twice.

277
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,760
Justin's got it again.
Justin wren,

278
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,360
who got it again,
got layer.

279
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,960
He lives in the Congo,
he spends time in the Congo.

280
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:17,260
He's got this foundation called fight 
for the forgotten.

281
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,040
And they go and they build a wells in 
the Congo for people.

282
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,930
And uh,
he's been over there many,

283
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:25,300
many times and this is the second time 
he got malaria.

284
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,300
And one of the things that he was saying
is there's different forms of malaria 

285
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,740
and some malaria will last six months,
some malaria last five years,

286
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,840
and some malaria last 30 years,
30 year malaria.

287
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,150
That's Kinda like.
I'm Kinda like that.

288
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,940
Lyme disease hangs around.
Well,

289
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:46,480
lyme disease is devastating.
That's some really bad stuff,

290
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:51,630
especially if you don't catch it quick.
There's a gigantic amount of people on 

291
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,470
the east coast that have lined to stuff 
just stays in your system,

292
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,760
whether it's from deer ticks and they 
have to figure out what to do about that

293
00:13:57,761 --> 00:14:02,761
because there's a lot of places in the 
east coast that are just overwhelmed 

294
00:14:02,761 --> 00:14:03,310
with deer because they don't have 
predators.

295
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,970
So they have all these deer and the only
predators that they're having now,

296
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,210
the coyotes have kind of expanded their 
range.

297
00:14:10,211 --> 00:14:12,770
And there used to be a,
an animal that was more in the,

298
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,290
in the west and the prairies.

299
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,370
There's this amazing podcast right now,
if anybody's interested in this,

300
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,780
um,
my friend Steve Rinella has this show 

301
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,551
called meat eater and it's on the 
sportsmans channel and there's a new 

302
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:28,090
podcast are not new,
but he's been doing it for awhile.

303
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,360
It's called the mediator podcasts and 
he's got this guy on named Dan Flores 

304
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,890
and Dan Flores is a historian and he was
one of Steve's a former professors and 

305
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:43,441
he has this book coming out about 
coyotes and it is fucking fascinating.

306
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,500
The knowledge that is guide drops about 
coyotes will blow you away.

307
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,360
First of all,
coyotes or wolves to kind of wolf.

308
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,010
They used

309
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,830
to call them prairie wolves.
That's what they used to call them,

310
00:14:54,831 --> 00:14:59,150
but it's like a type of wolf and they 
breed with wolves.

311
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:04,210
Most wolves except gray wolves because 
gray wolves have a different genetic 

312
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:09,011
line.
They had left North America millions of 

313
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:09,011
years ago and then came back like 
within,

314
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:09,270
you know,
x amount,

315
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,290
thousands of years.
And so they kill coyotes when they find 

316
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,731
them,
but red wolves and some other North 

317
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,440
American wolves that still survived 
those wolves bread with coyotes,

318
00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,510
and they're creating this thing called a
coil wolf,

319
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,350
which is like a hybrid of coyotes and 
wolves.

320
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,650
Let me ask you something.
Is this where geographically

321
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,650
all over the world,
all over the country,

322
00:15:32,651 --> 00:15:34,570
rather all of this country,
this country,

323
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,970
like I said,
it used to be a small range of coyotes,

324
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,510
but due to persecution,
they've expanded their range and part of

325
00:15:40,511 --> 00:15:42,580
it,
the persecution is not by humans,

326
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,760
but by the gray wolves,
because the gray wolves are killing 

327
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:47,760
them.
So what?

328
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:47,830
What coyotes do.
This is so fascinating.

329
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,840
Coyotes,
when they call out,

330
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,140
when you hear coyotes and then other 
ones call out.

331
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,660
What they're doing is they're doing a 
roll call.

332
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:59,800
They're making sure that everybody's 
there and when coyote to get killed,

333
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,350
when coyotes are under pressure,
when carbs get killed,

334
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,160
there's a reaction in the mother or the 
female.

335
00:16:06,161 --> 00:16:09,340
Coyotes have larger litters.
So the normal litter,

336
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,880
if nothing's disturbed,
is between three and four pups.

337
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:18,060
But if they get killed,
if they noticed that their numbers are 

338
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,450
dwindling,
they're numbers jack up to as many as 13

339
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:24,451
to 14 puppies per litter per litter,
and doing that as a result of being 

340
00:16:25,931 --> 00:16:28,330
persecuted,
realtime upgrade realtime upgrades.

341
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,250
So one of the things that they've been 
studying,

342
00:16:30,251 --> 00:16:35,251
this is in yellowstone park,
because yellowstone park for more than 

343
00:16:35,251 --> 00:16:38,521
70 years,
had no wolves because they had 

344
00:16:38,521 --> 00:16:41,081
eradicated wolves.
They had extra paid them from 

345
00:16:41,081 --> 00:16:43,231
yellowstone park.
Then they reintroduced them in the 19 

346
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:43,231
nineties.
So they.

347
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:46,240
The population of coyotes during that 
time was exactly the same.

348
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,870
It was completely steady until they 
brought in wolves.

349
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,890
And when the wolves started killing the 
coyotes,

350
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,710
they're gray wolves that they brought in
from Canada.

351
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,500
The gray wolf started killing the 
coyote.

352
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,960
The coyote is expanded like crazy and 
multiplied like nuts.

353
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,290
And now the initial thing that happened 
when they brought in wolves was at the 

354
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:06,370
wolves killed a giant percentage of the 
coyote and the coyote population dropped

355
00:17:06,371 --> 00:17:11,371
by 50 percent.
But then once the coyote started having 

356
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,510
much larger litters because there will 
be killed off by walls,

357
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,840
their numbers went as high as they were 
before and now even higher and now 

358
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:23,161
they've expanded their range.
So thanks to the reintroduction of 

359
00:17:23,161 --> 00:17:26,221
wolves in Yellowstone Park.
We've got coyotes all over the 

360
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:26,400
continental North America now.
Wow.

361
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,100
Fucking courageous.
Interesting.

362
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:28,310
You

363
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,910
brought this up.
I had a very weird experience recently.

364
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,170
I was,
um,

365
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:33,910
I live,
uh,

366
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,930
I live just north of the city in 
Toronto,

367
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:40,931
like still completely urbanized area.
It would be like here to downtown La,

368
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:43,510
let's say.
And um,

369
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,780
I was going to visit my parents house.
They live roughly in the same area and I

370
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:52,781
went past a place where I went to 
elementary school in a neighborhood 

371
00:17:53,821 --> 00:17:58,821
houses everywhere.
A wolf came straight in front of my 

372
00:17:58,821 --> 00:17:59,580
vehicle,
limping,

373
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,960
looked right at me and continued on into
the back of that elementary school,

374
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,000
a legit wolf.
I was like,

375
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:11,001
is this a coyote?
And I'm sizing it up as I'm staring at 

376
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:11,001
it.
So sure enough,

377
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:12,060
I'm like,
this couldn't,

378
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:17,090
this can't be true.
I'd never seen a wolf my whole life in 

379
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,641
this area,
and then so what I ended up doing is I 

380
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:22,971
went online and I typed the town name 
along with wolf and sure enough people 

381
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:25,500
have been spotting wolves coming into 
that area.

382
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,960
Look at this.
My friends live outside of Edmonton,

383
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,090
Alberta,
and the big ones,

384
00:18:30,091 --> 00:18:32,690
a big wolf was in front of my friend's 
truck today.

385
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,600
Just walking around the fucking thing.
They just sent me this this morning,

386
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,180
just walking around the street,
staring at him.

387
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,490
Fuck that.
Yeah.

388
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:46,230
That's a different kind of animal.
The way they look at you is there.

389
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:51,350
They're fascinating,
but coyotes are almost more fascinating 

390
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:51,350
because their ability to adapt.
You know,

391
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,260
they tried to wipe out the coyote during
the 19 thirties.

392
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:58,261
I don't want to give too much of this 
information because this is all Dan 

393
00:18:58,261 --> 00:19:02,310
Flores is a information.
It's all really much better distributed 

394
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:04,190
by him off of this mediator podcast.
You really should.

395
00:19:04,191 --> 00:19:06,610
It's not the most recent mediator 
podcasts,

396
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,430
but the one before that,
and today's date is the 20,

397
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:10,870
20,
30th,

398
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:14,290
30th of April.
So find it,

399
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,160
find it,
listen to it.

400
00:19:15,161 --> 00:19:20,161
It's amazing.
You might not be into hunting and I get 

401
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:20,500
that if you're not a hunter,
not a hunting podcasts.

402
00:19:20,501 --> 00:19:25,501
That one is not about hunting.
It's all about the wild west and about 

403
00:19:25,501 --> 00:19:28,180
the animals that used to exist on the 
planes and uh,

404
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,810
they're actually trying to set aside a 
gigantic chunk,

405
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:36,811
I think it's in Montana or something 
like that where they're trying to 

406
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:40,650
establish a new yellow stone type of 
situation where they bring in a lot of 

407
00:19:41,651 --> 00:19:46,651
these animals and allow them to live in 
a natural way and some large sort of,

408
00:19:47,081 --> 00:19:48,230
um,
you know,

409
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,930
like a savannah type area.

410
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,690
Like,
like that,

411
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,020
like recreating sort of the African 
savannas.

412
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,970
Wow.
Yeah.

413
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:57,760
What now that sounds dangerous to me.
Well,

414
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,790
they're just talking about animals that 
already exists of animals like wolves 

415
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,360
and bison and like local,
local with.

416
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:09,390
They're trying to have whatever would 
have texted large wild protected area 

417
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,410
where they can't develop and no one can 
frack.

418
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:12,190
And you know,
that kind of,

419
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:18,070
you know,
this is a video I put up the other day 

420
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:18,070
from a,
I think it was in Sweden,

421
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,130
I forget what town it was in,
but they were lighting lighting a lake 

422
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,601
on fire.
The lake has gotten so fucked up from 

423
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,180
fracking that you can light the lake on 
fire.

424
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,390
So they go up to this lake with a blow 
torch and they blow it on the lake and 

425
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:35,940
the whole lake lights on fire.
That's like,

426
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:38,860
that's like a bigger version of what the
people were doing on the taps,

427
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:39,700
right?
Yes.

428
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,860
I don't know much about fracking.
I know the tap thing is controversial 

429
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,010
only because some people say that some 
of that

430
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,910
natural gas that got into that water had
already gotten into that water.

431
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:53,680
And this is a common phenomenon that you
could.

432
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,360
You could actually document back,
you know,

433
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,390
decades before fracking every assistant.
So it could be that the natural gas,

434
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,590
which was already in the water,
right?

435
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:07,591
They're already trying to get.
That's what they're trying to get out 

436
00:21:07,591 --> 00:21:07,591
when they're fracking.
Right.

437
00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:10,840
That it was already leaking into some 
water in some places,

438
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:15,841
but that doesn't remove the possibility 
of fracking making more of that shit get

439
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:20,971
into people's water supply.
So it's real tricky because they want 

440
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:23,350
these people that are anti fracking,
um,

441
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:28,380
they,
they want to point out the dangers of 

442
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,380
fracking and the people that are pro 
fracking,

443
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:33,060
they want to pretend that there's no 
danger and it's like there's no middle 

444
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,790
ground.
It's like the documentary on Netflix,

445
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,590
merchants of doubt.
Have you seen that?

446
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,570
Amazing.
Yeah.

447
00:21:37,571 --> 00:21:42,571
It's like it's all about the agenda.
Any amount of money you have to further 

448
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:45,670
that agenda and how much you can 
extract.

449
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:50,671
If you can push your agenda,
you extract the money and then you put 

450
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:53,671
it back in to continue to lobby or 
whatever it might be to continue that 

451
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:54,550
conversation.
And it's like when he talks specifically

452
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:59,410
about how individuals,
they only need a fragment of information

453
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,880
in order to,
to,

454
00:22:00,881 --> 00:22:03,310
uh,
confirm their preexisting bias.

455
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,020
Yes.
Like you don't need a whole story,

456
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,200
just like just have to present the 
alternative argument.

457
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,960
Make people think it's an argument in 
the first place.

458
00:22:10,961 --> 00:22:15,961
Yeah.
And then they'll pick the side that's 

459
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:15,961
more convenient to them.
Like climate change.

460
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,160
That's a perfect one.
I mean there's this young Republican kid

461
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:21,900
from my Jujitsu class who's like,
somebody brought up climate change.

462
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:26,901
It was,
it wasn't even a conversation that was 

463
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:26,901
involved in.

464
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:26,901
And he goes,
that's the cycle.

465
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:26,901
So there's always been a cycle of 
change.

466
00:22:26,901 --> 00:22:29,820
Are you a fucking earth scientists do 
like,

467
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,100
what do you do?
You know,

468
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,520
you just got out of the marines and you 
know,

469
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,310
I'm pretty sure you weren't studying 
earth science in Afghanistan.

470
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,430
Like come on,
man is like a super complicated issue 

471
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,720
that a lot of people that are,
they have decades of science behind them

472
00:22:43,721 --> 00:22:46,000
and they're researching the,
the numbers.

473
00:22:46,001 --> 00:22:48,940
They're trying to figure this out.
They got a consensus.

474
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,320
Yeah.
How come you're not with them?

475
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,580
You know,
I think a part,

476
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:57,630
I think part of it is the fact that the 
way we've sort of been conditioned via 

477
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,940
media is to feel empowered.
You know?

478
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,990
It's like you watch this,
you watch this clip and you think you're

479
00:23:04,991 --> 00:23:09,991
getting information.
But in reality you're getting a 

480
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:09,991
headline.
You know what I mean?

481
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:13,410
Because that's the flow that will keep 
you engaged where you feel like you're 

482
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:17,881
getting smarter,
but there's no way in hell you're 

483
00:23:17,881 --> 00:23:18,100
putting in the time to be educated on 
certain subject matter.

484
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,220
He getting just enough to,
as I said before,

485
00:23:21,221 --> 00:23:26,221
confirm kind of what you thought already
and then go out and pretend that as you 

486
00:23:26,221 --> 00:23:28,700
mentioned,
you're some kind of authority on,

487
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,720
on the situation when there's other 
people out there that have invested so 

488
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,890
much more in their perspective,
but instead of admitting like,

489
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:36,540
Hey,
yeah,

490
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,570
I don't know too much about it,
or it is a complicated issue or there's 

491
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,540
more to the conversation,
there's something empowering about 

492
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,220
picking aside,
even if you don't necessarily

493
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,120
know.
Well,

494
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:52,121
I think there's something very 
problematic about headlines to like 

495
00:23:52,121 --> 00:23:55,070
these Gotcha clickbait headlines.
Like there was a headline recently about

496
00:23:55,071 --> 00:23:59,090
Bill Nye the science guy,
Bill Nye Bowtie.

497
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,320
I grew up on that shit.
Well,

498
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:05,321
Bill Nye,
the science guy has done a fantastic 

499
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:05,321
child.
No,

500
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:05,321
no,
no.

501
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:05,840
It's not a bad thing about him.
He's fine.

502
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,120
It wasn't him,
but Bill Nye the science guy.

503
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,840
He's done a fantastic job of trying to 
make science interesting to people and 

504
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,170
trying to educate people and trying to 
make science something that's compelling

505
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,200
and make young people drawn to it.
So Bill Nye the science guy was having a

506
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:25,730
conversation with this guy and the 
article,

507
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,760
the topic of the article or the,
uh,

508
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:32,761
the headline said,
Bill Nye favors prison terms for climate

509
00:24:34,161 --> 00:24:35,990
deniers.
So you're like,

510
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:39,380
what the fuck?
Because it was bill Nye lost his fucking

511
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:40,760
mind.
Is he gone crazy?

512
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,050
So I,
I read this piece and then I watched the

513
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,700
actual interview with Bill Nye.

514
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:51,910
He never said such a thing ever.
Someone suggested that climate deniers 

515
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:58,930
should go to jail because these energy 
ceos and these people that are spreading

516
00:25:00,141 --> 00:25:04,060
misinformation or directly harming the 
people that are,

517
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:09,090
that are going to be affected by that.
They know that they're saying something 

518
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:09,090
incorrect.
They do it to,

519
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,020
to distribute.
And there's other people who are going 

520
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,270
to be affected by.
So Bill Nye says,

521
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:18,470
that's interesting when you're talking 
about these energy ceos and these people

522
00:25:18,471 --> 00:25:21,950
are making choices that are going to 
directly affect our quality of life.

523
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,470
What do we do about it?
That's all.

524
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,180
I mean,
that's literally all he said.

525
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,900
The headline says,
Bill Nye favors climate deniers going to

526
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:31,970
jail.
It's clickbait bullshit.

527
00:25:31,971 --> 00:25:33,170
So when you read that,
you're like,

528
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,940
he's a fucking fascist,
you know,

529
00:25:34,941 --> 00:25:36,830
you don't even have scientists,
Gino,

530
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,220
where he got his degree and who's and 
who's the type of personality,

531
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:45,140
who's most inclined to pick that as an 
individual who doesn't want to invest in

532
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:48,770
discovering even the article they'll 
just take because it's easier.

533
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:53,890
It's easier to take the headline and 
form your perspective than it is to 

534
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:54,920
invest into.
Also because the people that are putting

535
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:59,921
that headline out,
all they want to do is make people read 

536
00:25:59,921 --> 00:25:59,921
it.
That's it.

537
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:00,560
Yeah.
Watch it,

538
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,300
read it,
get the clicks to get the money.

539
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,470
That's where they get the ad clicks.
Impressions.

540
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,530
Yeah.
I mean that's the only thing they're 

541
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,961
trying to do and they're trying to make 
it as salacious and as inviting as 

542
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:10,961
possible.
Yeah,

543
00:26:10,961 --> 00:26:13,100
and the thing is,
the only way to really combat that is to

544
00:26:13,101 --> 00:26:18,101
bounce,
is to get out of there as quickly as 

545
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:19,280
possible because.
Because the way I understand it,

546
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:23,750
not necessarily an expert in the field,
kind of done a few things on youtube,

547
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,710
but like as far as the Google page rank 
is concerned,

548
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,100
if you,
if a site is getting a quick bounce 

549
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,801
rate,
like if people are landing on it and 

550
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:35,801
leaving really quickly,
then it would,

551
00:26:35,801 --> 00:26:39,840
it would,
it could potentially be ranked lower in 

552
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:39,840
the future because of that.

553
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:39,840
Oh,
okay.

554
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,680
So you have to have a certain amount of 
time that you hover on a site before.

555
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,250
So the money.
Yeah.

556
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,030
So no,
no,

557
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,240
not for them to unlock money,
but for them to surface in the future.

558
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:52,140
Like Google will penalize sites that 
have low retention.

559
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:57,290
Oh,
just like videos that have low 

560
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,290
retention.
That's very intelligent.

561
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:58,290
Yeah.
But the problem is that you probably had

562
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:01,530
to read the whole damn thing to get to 
the conclusion that he didn't say it.

563
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,840
Well,
I watched the interview itself.

564
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,360
Oh,
it was video and yeah.

565
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,330
Was opposed video and there was a.
there's text along with the video.

566
00:27:09,331 --> 00:27:09,860
Let's,
let's,

567
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,740
let's,
can we,

568
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:14,250
we should name the site the piece of 
shit site that ruined your day.

569
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,820
Well,
it didn't ruin my day if you can find it

570
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,880
on Jake because I defended Bill Nye on 
twitter and I said this is not his 

571
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,190
words,
it's not what he was saying,

572
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,330
but let's watch the video itself and if 
we watched the video itself,

573
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:32,331
you can see how deceptive it is to say 
that he favors people who deny climate 

574
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:37,230
change to go to jail because it's not 
what he's saying at all.

575
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:42,530
Essentially he's saying that we should 
look at people that are ruining the 

576
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,821
earth,
like these energy ceos that wantonly 

577
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:48,480
pollute these areas in order to gain 
profit.

578
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,480
Here we go.
Just it so we could hear it

579
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:57,400
near the environmentalist here at the 
people's climate march in 2014.

580
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:01,230
However,
he said that the climate deniers,

581
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,260
his word entity ceos belong at the Hague
with three square meals and a cot with 

582
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,460
all the other war criminals.
What is your thought on that?

583
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,560
Do you think some of the rhetoric on 
your side,

584
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,480
as I'm sure both sides,
but some of the rhetoric and just had to

585
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:13,740
get too carried away?
I mean,

586
00:28:13,741 --> 00:28:18,741
you know,
what's your thought on jailing skeptics 

587
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:18,741
as war criminals?
We'll see what happens.

588
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:20,940
Uh,
was it appropriate to jail the guys from

589
00:28:20,941 --> 00:28:23,370
Enron?
Interesting.

590
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay.
Right.

591
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:29,001
So we'll see what happens if was it 
appropriate to jail people from the 

592
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:32,520
cigarette industry you insisted,
insisted that this addictive product was

593
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:36,750
not addictive and so on.
And you think about in these cases,

594
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:39,900
for me as a taxpayer and voter,
uh,

595
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:42,930
the doubting,
the introduction of this extreme doubt,

596
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:47,990
will you go with extreme doubt about 
climate change is affecting my quality 

597
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,581
of life as a public citizen.
So I can see where people are very 

598
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:56,700
concerned about this and are pursuing 
criminal investigations as well as,

599
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:57,800
uh,

600
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,320
as well as engaging in discussions like 
this.

601
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:07,220
That is a very measured response.
And he's essentially talking about 

602
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,960
people like the BP people that fucking 
polluted the golf.

603
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,200
That's what he's talking about.
He's not saying that you know someone 

604
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,980
who like the kid from my Jujitsu class 
that thinks it's a cycle of life,

605
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,780
you should go to jail.
Yeah,

606
00:29:18,781 --> 00:29:20,880
and even even if you look at the very 
end there,

607
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:25,881
he made sure to say,
I can see why people might think 

608
00:29:25,881 --> 00:29:28,581
something like that instead of 
necessarily confirming that that's the 

609
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:31,671
outcome he wants to see.
He's making good points and you if you 

610
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,460
do like that merchants of doubt movie,
which is amazing movie.

611
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:40,461
If you watch that movie,
you realize that the same people that 

612
00:29:40,461 --> 00:29:42,190
were working for the tobacco industry 
but they were denying the

613
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:47,190
addictive effects of tobacco are the 
same people that are denying climate 

614
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,770
change and human beings like not the 
same kind of people,

615
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,880
but the exact same people.
Yeah,

616
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,290
that's a little bit much.
Well,

617
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,150
that's what they do and they get checks.
There's direct checks from these tobacco

618
00:30:01,151 --> 00:30:03,760
companies as direct checks from these 
energy companies.

619
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:06,960
They're getting paid for this.
You know,

620
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:11,970
coming back to the click bait subject.
I don't thing they click bait is always 

621
00:30:12,551 --> 00:30:13,360
bad.
No,

622
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:18,361
it's not always bad.
Like I think there's a difference 

623
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:18,680
between click bait and lying.
Right?

624
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:23,760
You know,
like I think sometimes click bait gets 

625
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,030
too much of a bad rap.
Like I'm in a sense of.

626
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,510
I think a headline should be intriguing.
It should Pique your interest,

627
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,380
should compel you to click yes.
Which you could say is bait,

628
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:35,470
you know,
but like I feel like navigating the real

629
00:30:35,471 --> 00:30:36,730
world is full of clickbait.

630
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,200
Oh,
coffee is clickbait.

631
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:42,930
And when you see a girl on a tight skirt
that sounded Toyota Click Bait,

632
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:43,990
click bait.
Yeah.

633
00:30:43,991 --> 00:30:45,580
So,
so in that sense,

634
00:30:45,581 --> 00:30:46,300
I feel like,
you know,

635
00:30:46,301 --> 00:30:50,230
there's a place for it,
but I think people use the technique to,

636
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:55,310
to essentially lie and it gives the 
whole kind of system of bad rap.

637
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,180
Well,
in that Bill Nye situation,

638
00:30:57,181 --> 00:31:01,360
there's not always a clickbait.
I think it's like he should fucking sue.

639
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:02,500
I mean,
not really,

640
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,720
but he goes,
not employed anymore.

641
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,810
It's not to get the ball rolling in that
direction.

642
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:12,811
But so many people on my timeline,
we're calling him a fascist and these 

643
00:31:13,031 --> 00:31:15,790
fucking left wingers are so far left now
they're right there.

644
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,340
Nobody had watched the video,
nobody had read it,

645
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,520
nobody had.
It was just immediate reaction with his 

646
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,860
little information as possible for you 
to be upset.

647
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,780
Yeah.
Again,

648
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:29,380
I just the knee jerk,
they need jerk response of the web,

649
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:34,500
you know,
there's like a lot of stuff going on 

650
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:34,500
youtube right now.

651
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,980
I'm kind of immersed in the youtube 
world in a social media world,

652
00:31:35,981 --> 00:31:38,860
whenever there's like a lot of drama 
that's getting,

653
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,410
getting rewarded recently.
Like what kind of drama?

654
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,230
Um,
in like without going into too much 

655
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:47,230
detail,
there's like a,

656
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,840
there's a lot of,
is a lot of channels that popped up kind

657
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,150
of kind of hating on people.
Yeah,

658
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,890
that's all they do.
Yeah.

659
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:59,040
And that's like the entire agenda is to 
use other people's content as the 

660
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,541
vehicle for you to have a channel.
So like today I'm going to shit on this 

661
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:04,270
video and tomorrow I'm gonna Shit on 
that video.

662
00:32:04,271 --> 00:32:07,000
And so there's this kind of conversation
about,

663
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,600
about whether or not that like is that 
still fair use in that environment 

664
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,820
because the understanding of meaning.
It's not definitive,

665
00:32:15,821 --> 00:32:20,080
but the understanding I have a fair use 
is that like if you're compelling people

666
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:25,081
to go look at the original,
like you just did with the information 

667
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:25,081
about coyotes,
you,

668
00:32:25,081 --> 00:32:25,750
you took a moment and you said,
okay,

669
00:32:25,751 --> 00:32:28,010
this is this guy's research or whatever,
like,

670
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,320
so go check him out.

671
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,440
You actually did him a service there 
instead of the alternative have you 

672
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,690
could have just talked about and so on.
Well,

673
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:39,070
in the case of these types of videos,
people are using actual clips from these

674
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,280
that they're shitting on and that's 
making up their channel.

675
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,020
Exactly.
Yeah,

676
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,520
and maybe more importantly there's,
they don't,

677
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,340
they don't compel you to go look at the 
original because essentially they're 

678
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:57,821
hating.
Why would you go as a viewer and go 

679
00:32:57,821 --> 00:33:00,881
source out this thing that this person 
that you like is telling you is a piece 

680
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:04,661
of shit anyways.
You're not going to go watch the 

681
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:04,661
original,
right?

682
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:04,730
You're happier to,
to listen to this guy shit on stuff.

683
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:09,820
And so anyway,
the problem is that a algorithmically it

684
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:13,250
feels like drama cells,
right?

685
00:33:13,251 --> 00:33:18,251
Just like,
just like in the regular world and so 

686
00:33:18,251 --> 00:33:20,231
some of these channels are rapidly 
growing rapidly growing on the backs of 

687
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:21,020
essentially making fun of people.

688
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:25,490
So there's some,
some sort of feeling in the community,

689
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,580
um,
that youtube has changed or you get a 

690
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,310
lot of these people that are like make 
youtube great again,

691
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:36,311
stuff like that.
But I mean I don't necessarily agree 

692
00:33:36,311 --> 00:33:39,101
with that,
but I think that there is maybe a 

693
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:39,650
conversation to be had about,
um,

694
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,130
about how much freedom were willing to 
give individuals to essentially build 

695
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,820
their product on the back of other 
people's will.

696
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:48,980
That is a,
an important issue when it comes to free

697
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,040
to fair use.
Like if someone just decided to make an 

698
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,970
unbox unboxing,
unbox therapy channel and all their shit

699
00:33:55,971 --> 00:33:59,240
is just shitting on what you do.
Look at this fucking dummy talking about

700
00:33:59,241 --> 00:34:00,820
watches that.
Yeah,

701
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:05,830
that's not really fair use.
I mean they're kind of stealing your 

702
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:08,381
content and becoming something with your
content only exclusively or other 

703
00:34:08,381 --> 00:34:08,990
people's content.

704
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,880
Like they don't really have content 
there.

705
00:34:10,881 --> 00:34:15,140
Content is other people's content and 
you get a few layers deep on that.

706
00:34:15,141 --> 00:34:20,141
And you realize it's kind of like,
it's kind of a fucked up scenario and 

707
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,920
you wonder about what it breeds like a,
there was this issue with the,

708
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,790
the fine brothers.
Do you know who they are?

709
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,810
The fine brothers.
I've heard the woo hoo.

710
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,050
So they have just really popular 
channel,

711
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:32,510
maybe like 10,
11,

712
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,400
12 million subscribers or something.
Jesus.

713
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,410
Yeah.
And they do react videos.

714
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,140
So.
Oh,

715
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,720
so they watched something and then they 
react to it?

716
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,170
No,
no,

717
00:34:39,171 --> 00:34:39,350
no,
no.

718
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:41,420
They don't personally.
They have people on.

719
00:34:41,450 --> 00:34:46,450
So it'd be like kids react that it'll be
like grandparents react and then it'll 

720
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,700
be like famous youtubers react or 
athletes react,

721
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:53,540
somebody reacting,
but essentially the core of their being,

722
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:54,710
they've been doing this for a long time.

723
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,710
The core aspect of the model is that 
there's this thing you're reacting to 

724
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,130
whether it's a viral video,
a trend,

725
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:06,310
whatever it might be.
While recently they tried to trademark 

726
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:12,250
the term react so that anybody who 
uploaded a video with the term react in 

727
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:15,350
it,
that they could claim it and earn the ad

728
00:35:15,351 --> 00:35:17,480
revenue.
Oh my God,

729
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:20,920
they must be stopped.
If you do know about this,

730
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,130
Jamie,
I tried to,

731
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,140
I think I told you about this at one 
point when it first maybe like started 

732
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,371
online chat,
kind of fucking cunt thinks that they 

733
00:35:30,371 --> 00:35:33,791
can own the word sentence.
So they launched this video so they 

734
00:35:33,791 --> 00:35:34,330
launched this video where,
um,

735
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:38,310
where essentially they're explaining how
this process will work for people.

736
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,460
They're like,
they're telling you that like you can 

737
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:43,890
sign up with us today and we'll license 
will license it back to you.

738
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,850
So you.
So who the fuck are these guys?

739
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:52,490
So they're out of their fucking mind.
They are out of their fucking money,

740
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,940
but here it gets better.
Yeah.

741
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:55,830
But here's the thing though,
real quick.

742
00:35:55,831 --> 00:36:00,831
They're not the only ones.
So there's other companies out there 

743
00:36:00,831 --> 00:36:00,840
that have already been doing this in 
quiet.

744
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:06,030
Um,
there's a company called Juke and media 

745
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,630
and there was a story.
This guy,

746
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:08,970
uh,
what was his name?

747
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,080
Devin.
Supertramp.

748
00:36:10,081 --> 00:36:13,560
He makes like action action videos.
I don't know what you would call them.

749
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,590
Action Videos.
Sure.

750
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,510
He used,
he used a title called people are 

751
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:23,391
awesome.
That was the title of his video for his 

752
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:23,391
demo reel for them.
I've seen that.

753
00:36:23,391 --> 00:36:24,090
Yeah.
And,

754
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,220
and he,
he didn't know that you can mediate,

755
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,070
had already trademarked that title.
People are awesome.

756
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,250
They own it and have our own people are 
awesome.

757
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:37,440
Exactly,
exactly.

758
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,410
Because whoever's got enough money to 
pay the right lawyer,

759
00:36:40,411 --> 00:36:42,590
God knows how it happened,
but they,

760
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,170
the,
the,

761
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:46,410
the idea that you can trademark those 
three words together,

762
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:51,650
that is so insane.
So they were able to issue a copyright 

763
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,400
pulled down on his video and oh my.
And uh,

764
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,270
and so that was acting as his demo reel 
to get jobs and stuff like that.

765
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,140
And so he did a follow up kind of 
explaining what had happened.

766
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,220
But,
uh,

767
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:07,221
so anyway,
getting back to kind of the drama 

768
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:08,991
component,
it's like people are kind of looking at 

769
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:08,991
youtube now a little differently.
Like wow,

770
00:37:08,991 --> 00:37:13,620
maybe here's this completely open space 
where people were allowed to do whatever

771
00:37:13,621 --> 00:37:14,640
they wanted,
but like,

772
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,440
what are the consequences of that?
Well,

773
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,470
it's,
you're putting out a certain type of 

774
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,470
frequency,
right?

775
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:22,470
I mean,
that's what you're putting out.

776
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:25,881
If you're putting out a frequency,
what you're saying is you want to own 

777
00:37:25,881 --> 00:37:26,340
all the react videos.

778
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:31,550
That's the greedy can frequency 
throughout the greedy combat bat signal 

779
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,390
and you're letting everybody know you're
a piece of shit.

780
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,700
You're a piece of shit and you want to 
steal money.

781
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:36,210
Well,
you know,

782
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,010
the best part is that stealing money,
right?

783
00:37:38,011 --> 00:37:38,940
I mean,
that's stealing money.

784
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:41,160
If you make a reaction video,
you want to watch two girls,

785
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:43,710
one cup or guy getting run over by a 
buffalo,

786
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,070
they want money from you watching that 
video,

787
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:52,340
that stealing.
What they've done is they've used 

788
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,561
lawyers to circumvent the system.
They've jacked the system and they're 

789
00:37:54,561 --> 00:37:58,521
going to try to steal.
Have they actually copyrighted the word 

790
00:37:58,521 --> 00:37:58,521
react.
So is this valid?

791
00:37:58,521 --> 00:37:59,040
So they,
they,

792
00:37:59,041 --> 00:38:00,780
uh,
they retracted.

793
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:04,110
What happened was the Internet lost its 
shit as you would expect.

794
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:09,470
And these guys,
there were videos on youtube which were 

795
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,501
live streams.
These were so funny when this was going 

796
00:38:12,501 --> 00:38:16,581
on.
Essentially what they were is the 

797
00:38:16,581 --> 00:38:18,501
subscriber count of their channel 
shortly after the controversy had hit 

798
00:38:18,501 --> 00:38:22,260
and it will just like fell off a cliff,
like it should go to zero.

799
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,450
He never went to 100 percent,
go to zero.

800
00:38:24,451 --> 00:38:26,250
It should go to zero.
It never went to zero,

801
00:38:26,251 --> 00:38:29,040
don't deserve anything.
That's what they want to do.

802
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:34,250
You really want to reach out to everyone
using the word react and the video and 

803
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:34,250
you want money from them.
Fuck you.

804
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,130
Fuck you.
You're everything that's

805
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,470
wrong with distributing content over the
internet.

806
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:43,650
That's everything that's wrong with it.
You've taken one of the sneakiest most 

807
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:47,220
diabolical fucking tricks and all of the
legal system and you've applied it to 

808
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:50,380
this open free world of the Internet and
you're a piece of shit.

809
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,020
That's a parasitic behavior.
Let me ask you something.

810
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:54,490
That's cancer.
I agree.

811
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,190
They came back,
retracted it.

812
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:00,340
Apologize.
Fuck them.

813
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:02,350
Fuck them for even thinking that showed 
the,

814
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,360
okay,
now you're going to give them a second 

815
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,360
chance.
Fucking chances.

816
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:07,960
You can't think like that.
You can't do that.

817
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:09,370
You can't.
You can't do that.

818
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:14,371
You can't go after people.
For some it's not like it has anything 

819
00:39:14,371 --> 00:39:14,371
to do.
Anything that you create,

820
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,850
you're just stealing.
There were,

821
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,780
there were some stories going around 
that they had effectively shut down like

822
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:24,781
these small time channel,
Walmart completely like people who had 

823
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:24,781
the chance.

824
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:28,660
Again to define bro,
you can't do that.

825
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:32,950
Man is probably some lawyer talked him 
into doing that is going to be amazing.

826
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,200
God,
we got it.

827
00:39:34,201 --> 00:39:37,990
Dude.
We have the copyright fuckers.

828
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,840
It's a weird.
That's so gross.

829
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:46,380
The idea behind going after people.
It's not like this something that you 

830
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:51,451
created and you know they came along.
Something completely unique where you 

831
00:39:51,451 --> 00:39:51,520
want to copy.
Right.

832
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:56,530
Then what happened was that they were.
They went so far as trying to go after 

833
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,671
ellen because she did.
She did reactions on TV.

834
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,310
Oh mine.
She would have kids,

835
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,760
kids reacting,
but you know what?

836
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:05,950
The crazy Chicago jail,
you should go to jail for that.

837
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:06,940
Crazy.
It's fucked up.

838
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:11,941
The whole legal system.
They didn't have format exist before 

839
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:12,120
that.
Bill Cosby do that today.

840
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:15,190
I did a react to two girls,
one cup video,

841
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,910
like in 2003 or way back that Brian and 
I did.

842
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:22,900
It should have copyright.
So gross.

843
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:26,720
It's so gross man.
But anyway.

844
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,520
Anyway,
I don't know.

845
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:28,960
I think um,
I don't know.

846
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,540
It's scary both ways because at the same
time you're like,

847
00:40:31,541 --> 00:40:33,370
well,
do you really want youtube to come in as

848
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:37,210
this massive governing body to stop 
stuff like this from happening?

849
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:37,840
Well,
that,

850
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:39,540
yeah,
yeah,

851
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,480
yeah,
I agree.

852
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,310
There's some clear cut shit like the 
word react.

853
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:45,760
You can't use react or people are 
awesome.

854
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:46,810
Fuck you,
man.

855
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,240
People are awesome.
It's still there and still functioning.

856
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:52,480
If we titled this video right here,
people are awesome.

857
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,550
We're gone.
Take it down.

858
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,500
They're ripping us down instantly.
That doesn't seem right to me.

859
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:01,530
That's just,
that's like saying love the copywriting,

860
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,900
the word love or you know,
or action.

861
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,160
Well,
people are off,

862
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,450
wasn't it?
Didn't designate.

863
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,860
People have said that.
Disney copyright a happy birthday.

864
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,200
Right?
Well happy birthday to you.

865
00:41:14,201 --> 00:41:16,990
The song was copy written for a long 
time,

866
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:21,991
but it's since been dissolved now 
because he used to go to a restaurant 

867
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:22,870
and they used to have to sing their own,
like happy,

868
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:27,871
happy birthday.
He couldn't sing happy birthday to a 

869
00:41:27,871 --> 00:41:31,300
song that we all know the iconic song.
Somebody owned it.

870
00:41:31,301 --> 00:41:34,130
So if you wanted to sing that song in 
your restaurant when someone came

871
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,420
in,
they were celebrating a birthday,

872
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,140
you would actually get fined.
You'd actually have to pay money.

873
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,680
Let me ask you this,
I mean,

874
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:46,630
just because we're on the topic,
how do you feel in general about like 

875
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,770
digital rights and whatnot?
Like are you,

876
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:53,900
are you really fancy about it?
Like let's say you had some content.

877
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:56,600
I know you sometimes you have like 
musicians on here,

878
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:59,120
right?
And they kind of seem to me to be like a

879
00:41:59,121 --> 00:42:02,390
little bit out of touch with the 
Internet space.

880
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,880
Um,
and I'm just wondering like if a person 

881
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,070
is,
is,

882
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:13,180
is,
is purchasing or streaming or buying 

883
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,690
something that somebody's trying to sell
digitally,

884
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,590
do you like how do you feel about that?
What does that,

885
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,530
how do you think that should work?
Selling things digitally well,

886
00:42:21,531 --> 00:42:26,531
like let's say for example,
you had a record and you and you found 

887
00:42:26,531 --> 00:42:26,570
out that a bunch of people were pirating
it.

888
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:29,330
Would you go at how hard would you be 
willing to go after them?

889
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,060
Well,

890
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:35,090
see,
it completely depends upon whether or 

891
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:35,640
not what your business is.
So I,

892
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:40,810
I,
my feeling is that one of the things 

893
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,240
about music and you could use the same 
argument for standup comedy,

894
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,690
is that pirating in a lot of ways 
empowers people.

895
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:49,290
Like,
like when someone puts up my stand up on

896
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:54,320
their youtube channel,
I'm not into taking that down because I 

897
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,840
think that even when I was selling it,
I'm just not.

898
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:59,790
I'm not into taking that down and the 
reason being is because I think the more

899
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:04,791
people see it,
the more people will come to see your 

900
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,891
live shows,
the more people will come to support 

901
00:43:06,891 --> 00:43:09,651
your standup,
whether it's on Netflix or comedy 

902
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:09,651
central or whatever.
They'll pay more attention to it.

903
00:43:09,651 --> 00:43:14,121
So it's,
in a way it's kind of free advertising 

904
00:43:14,121 --> 00:43:16,580
in that way.
Music companies don't tend to think 

905
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,991
about it that way and we had a recent 
problem that was pretty fucking 

906
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:20,991
disgusting.

907
00:43:20,991 --> 00:43:22,260
Well,
we had an act on and uh,

908
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,320
the musical act played the,
we played a small section of one of 

909
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,190
their songs and then the music company 
that own that section,

910
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,970
the song wanted all the ad rights for 
our show for that episode.

911
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:37,290
And so,
you know,

912
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:39,600
we contacted the artist and the artist 
said,

913
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,160
well I'll,
I'll get that taken care of.

914
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:46,490
The music companies decision was no,
just tell them to not dispute the claim 

915
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:48,870
and we'll take the ad revenue and then 
it will be fine.

916
00:43:48,871 --> 00:43:51,300
We won't take down the video.
You won't take down the,

917
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:56,310
it's a fucking three hour video.
We paid 15 seconds of a song and you 

918
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:56,940
want all the ad revenue,
fuck you.

919
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,110
And I told them,
I'm like,

920
00:43:58,111 --> 00:44:00,060
look dude,
you get this taken care of her.

921
00:44:00,061 --> 00:44:01,980
I'm going to delete the episode.
Go Fuck Yourself.

922
00:44:01,981 --> 00:44:03,060
Like this is ridiculous.

923
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Like that's some greedy,
sneaky bullshit that record companies 

924
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,530
are still trying to do because record 
companies have to justify the fact 

925
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:13,890
they've got x amount of employees and a 
giant building on sunset.

926
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,630
You don't need that anymore.
Okay.

927
00:44:15,631 --> 00:44:17,190
You're building.
Your Business is dead.

928
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,900
Okay.
It's sorry,

929
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,670
but this is what you got.
You got itunes,

930
00:44:20,671 --> 00:44:22,170
music,
Google play,

931
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,540
and that's it.
That's it.

932
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,640
That's your business.
Now the real business is artists getting

933
00:44:26,641 --> 00:44:29,670
their shit out on youtube and on on 
social media,

934
00:44:29,790 --> 00:44:32,940
and then doing concerts.
That's where they make the bulk of their

935
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:33,890
money.
The map.

936
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:38,990
They used to be the opposite.
He used to be artists made the bulk of 

937
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,751
their money from the record sales and 
then they made some of the money from 

938
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:43,590
concerts.
So what happens was the record companies

939
00:44:43,591 --> 00:44:48,591
would rip them off for record sales and 
they would come up with all these 

940
00:44:48,591 --> 00:44:50,760
elaborate accounting methods too fake to
to fix the,

941
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:51,540
the profit.

942
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:56,660
So that made it look like all their 
expenses had to be paid first before 

943
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,980
they counted the profit that they didn't
take into consideration.

944
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,580
The artists learning how to play,
going on the road,

945
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:07,700
doing all these gigs,
creating this song all the time spent 

946
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,400
writing,
they don't take that into consideration,

947
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:11,640
but they do calculate all their 
employees,

948
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,340
all their expenses,
all their advertising revenue,

949
00:45:14,341 --> 00:45:16,020
how much it costs to rent their 
building,

950
00:45:16,021 --> 00:45:21,021
how much it costs for insurance,
how much it costs for errors and 

951
00:45:21,021 --> 00:45:24,261
omissions insurance,
all those different things they do take 

952
00:45:24,261 --> 00:45:24,900
into account before you get paid.
So the artists,

953
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:29,310
we're fucked like there's a lot of 
artists that got unbelievably bad record

954
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:34,311
deals,
like the reason why prince had changed 

955
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:35,460
his name to a symbol because they 
fucking owned his name,

956
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:40,910
so that crafty bastard just decided to 
make his name some sort of a weird 

957
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:44,961
symbol and become the artist formerly 
known as Prince and they couldn't do 

958
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:44,961
shit about it.

959
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:46,050
It was a really clever workaround for 
prints,

960
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,330
but it was essentially in response to 
these devious practices by these fucking

961
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,170
record companies.
Right?

962
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:55,920
So in that sense,
I think like if someone,

963
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,670
if you have an album and everybody loves
it and then people start pirating it and

964
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,160
then it gets all over the place.
Like some musicians.

965
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:04,980
I had Paul Stanley from kiss and he was,
I heard that one.

966
00:46:04,981 --> 00:46:07,650
That's kind of what I'm referencing is 
super adamant about it.

967
00:46:07,651 --> 00:46:09,730
But he's so old school man.
He sold,

968
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:11,720
squeezed,
super adamant about it that it's still,

969
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:14,870
I get this vibe from those conversations
that like,

970
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,030
it's almost like these people are kind 
of.

971
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:23,310
They're wishing that an ecosystem 
existed still.

972
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,020
That doesn't of course.
Well he made fucking hundreds of 

973
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:29,020
millions of dollars through that 
ecosystem.

974
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,290
But I think the truth is the hard truth 
is that at least on the economic side,

975
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,230
music isn't worth what it used to be 
worth.

976
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:38,580
Absolutely.
And I,

977
00:46:38,581 --> 00:46:41,540
and I don't like saying that because to 
me it matters and like I,

978
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:46,460
I engage with it and it hasn't like an a
in a non economic weight.

979
00:46:46,461 --> 00:46:51,461
It might mean more than ever now that 
more people have access to it and you 

980
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:53,790
can be exposed to so much more of it.
But unlike a purse song basis,

981
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,280
it's a supply and demand situation now 
of we have an abundance of potential 

982
00:46:59,551 --> 00:47:04,551
music to interact with.
So there's no way that each song can 

983
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:04,551
possibly be worth what it used to be 
worth.

984
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:10,430
Well,
there's no way because it's so easy to 

985
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:10,430
access now.
That's one thing.

986
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,601
And the other thing is the sheer numbers
of songs that get put out every day,

987
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,530
they all exist now.
You could go back and listen to some Roy

988
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:24,530
orbison from the 19 fifties or you can 
listen to some shit that some new band 

989
00:47:24,530 --> 00:47:25,020
that you haven't heard of just put out 
last week.

990
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,920
They haven't stopped making bands.
They haven't stopped making music.

991
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:34,320
It's all just adding up.
So let's say collective pilar music is 

992
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:34,320
massive.
I would say

993
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:39,110
accelerating because the barrier to 
entry in actually creating continues to 

994
00:47:39,841 --> 00:47:40,710
be lowered.
Yes.

995
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,450
Like actually the equipment you need

996
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,790
laptop,
that's it.

997
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:48,100
No laptop microphone.
When you can create music on Garageband,

998
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:50,750
100 percent,
you really can create a good.

999
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,070
Have you ever heard of tone,
Netta?

1000
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,140
You to Annetta?
No tone.

1001
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:59,180
That is an interesting cat man.
He's a guy who lives in Toronto and cool

1002
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,600
link up.
He's like this weird androgynous guy in 

1003
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,331
his fifties.
He's got a kid who makes his own music 

1004
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:12,800
and he got famous for these songs on 
Youtube.

1005
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,980
This is a him.
He makes these videos were just puts up 

1006
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:22,770
a curtain behind him and he makes these 
youtube videos and he sings these songs 

1007
00:48:23,781 --> 00:48:25,580
and some of them are fucking good,
like,

1008
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:30,970
pull up a really big cock that's uh,
that's one of my favorite place to 

1009
00:48:32,961 --> 00:48:34,130
start.
But here's the thing,

1010
00:48:34,131 --> 00:48:36,350
it sounds like ridiculous,
right?

1011
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,820
But it's actually a cool song.
Like,

1012
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:40,600
listen to the.
Let's,

1013
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,110
let's play it.
Give me some volume.

1014
00:48:42,111 --> 00:48:42,410
Jamie,

1015
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,110
look at this guy.
There's no money in this forum.

1016
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,900
It was just some Weirdo hanging out.

1017
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:11,530
Good songs.

1018
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,190
So of baseline.
But look at this video.

1019
00:49:16,191 --> 00:49:21,191
I mean,
this could not be any more geo 

1020
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,560
cities.com.
This is so low rent.

1021
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:27,530
He does it in his apartment in Toronto.
He just has a camera pointed at him,

1022
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:32,770
like really primitive.
He's got a bunch of different weird 

1023
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,100
dresses and he puts on outfits and it's 
just really strange.

1024
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:40,130
But this guy,
he does it all himself and he's got this

1025
00:49:40,131 --> 00:49:43,390
massive cult following from doing this 
all himself.

1026
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,350
I bought his vinyl.
I have A.

1027
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:50,351
I owned this stuff.
I bought it on itunes and I bought the 

1028
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:50,351
vinyl of it too.
Support

1029
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,820
and you know what?
That's a great point you make there.

1030
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:55,700
I remember reading something recently,
don't quote me,

1031
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,100
I don't know the figures,
but that artists,

1032
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,250
a lot of artists are actually making 
more off the vinyl than they are off the

1033
00:50:01,251 --> 00:50:06,251
digital even though the volume is so 
much lower just because the actual per 

1034
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:09,971
unit cost is so high.
So like big bands are doing special 

1035
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:14,081
edition releases on vinyl and such to 
kind of get back some of that lost 

1036
00:50:14,301 --> 00:50:17,060
revenue that's existed because of 
digital.

1037
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,360
So that's an interesting angle to take.
But I think people are like you where 

1038
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,360
you're,
you're,

1039
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,420
you're,
you're kind of almost doing it.

1040
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,400
Not because you really need to have it 
on vinyl,

1041
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,660
but because you want to support 
something you like a.

1042
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:32,720
unfortunately,
I think there's a small percentage of 

1043
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:32,720
people that do that.
Most people,

1044
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:32,960
if they can get it for free,
they get it for free because most people

1045
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:34,700
are constantly worried about their 
bills,

1046
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,980
you know,
and if you can get something for free 

1047
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,010
and download it and no one's watching,
I mean that totally makes sense.

1048
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,930
Yeah.
Artist making more of vinyl sales.

1049
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,960
The streaming services.
If the article will streaming services 

1050
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:46,960
are the worst,
but are they?

1051
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,820
They are and here's why.
They're owned by the record companies 

1052
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,790
and they have circumvented the whole 
selling album system.

1053
00:50:52,791 --> 00:50:54,300
Right,
but is it,

1054
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,360
isn't it,
isn't it the demand from the customer 

1055
00:50:59,360 --> 00:50:59,360
that is always going to drive the 
marketplace.

1056
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:02,330
If people want streaming services,
sorry to break it to you.

1057
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:06,110
That's the reality.
We have what they want free money to.

1058
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,180
If you could just hand out from under,
that would be great as well.

1059
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:10,760
But I mean in this particular case with 
music,

1060
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,200
doesn't music work better when you can 
just launch any source process on the 

1061
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,230
planet?
Streaming services are profitable and 

1062
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:22,661
they're making a lot of money now.
The streaming services are making a lot 

1063
00:51:22,661 --> 00:51:25,211
of money.
The artists aren't making artists and 

1064
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:25,211
artist doesn't need to be on spotify 
plant.

1065
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:26,500
There are plenty of examples of people 
who pulled their stuff.

1066
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,520
I'll spot Taylor swift.
Oh,

1067
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,710
my podcast won't.
I won't put my pipe.

1068
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:31,700
That's easy.
Yeah.

1069
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:36,701
Well it's because of the amount of money
that they pay you is fucking 

1070
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:36,701
ridiculously low.
Right?

1071
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:37,640
It's insane.
Taylor swift pull that shit off.

1072
00:51:37,641 --> 00:51:42,641
Spotify when you get a big art,
it's like Taylor swift pulling their 

1073
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:42,641
shit off.
Spotify,

1074
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,940
I don't know how much you made off 
spotify.

1075
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:48,260
The figures maybe could discuss a couple
million or something,

1076
00:51:48,261 --> 00:51:50,160
but no,
she didn't make a couple of minutes.

1077
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,270
Maybe 500,
maybe $500,000.

1078
00:51:52,271 --> 00:51:52,620
No,
no,

1079
00:51:52,621 --> 00:51:53,870
no.
It was so low.

1080
00:51:53,871 --> 00:51:58,871
It was insane.
I think it's somewhere in there waiting 

1081
00:51:58,871 --> 00:52:02,360
for the biggest.
That's the biggest artists that exists 

1082
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:02,360
on the platform.
Well,

1083
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,060
there was like we went over this before 
where we put.

1084
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:09,130
We looked at the one song that got 
played the most on spotify and how much 

1085
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,270
that artists got for it and it was like 
2000 bucks.

1086
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,940
A fraction of a penny per play.
But see,

1087
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:18,941
my,
my feeling though is is the spotify 

1088
00:52:18,941 --> 00:52:21,880
audience,
are they a crossover of the itunes 

1089
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:21,950
audience or are they a crossover of the 
pirating audience?

1090
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:27,070
I think there are radio audience because
it's like instead of tuning into what 

1091
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:31,871
I'm saying is in the absence of spotify,
did those millions and millions of 

1092
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:35,590
users,
do they turn to itunes and give you the 

1093
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:35,590
ninety nine cents or do they give you 
nothing?

1094
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,710
Because if they're giving you nothing 
and stealing it right thing.

1095
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:41,920
Isn't spotify better than that 
alternative because at least you,

1096
00:52:41,921 --> 00:52:43,970
if it's the pirating audience.
Exactly,

1097
00:52:43,971 --> 00:52:48,971
and this is the fear that this is the 
thing that the music business doesn't 

1098
00:52:48,971 --> 00:52:50,180
seem to want to address,
is that when napster hit,

1099
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,670
everybody was a pirate.
I don't care who you are.

1100
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,630
I walked around and talked to him.
He was a pirate.

1101
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,370
It was so superior to any other method 
for discovering music.

1102
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,100
You even if you wanted,
you didn't want to steal things.

1103
00:53:01,101 --> 00:53:01,700
It's like,
fuck,

1104
00:53:01,701 --> 00:53:03,020
this is too good.
Right?

1105
00:53:03,230 --> 00:53:06,590
But the problem is this is not pirating 
because pirating,

1106
00:53:06,591 --> 00:53:09,530
nobody benefited from.
Everybody got free stuff,

1107
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:14,020
but no one profited with this recording,
these training service three,

1108
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,350
would that be.
Well,

1109
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,210
again,
this is not a direct,

1110
00:53:17,211 --> 00:53:18,350
but hold on,
let me finish my sentence.

1111
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:23,351
Go ahead and record.
Companies created a platform of 

1112
00:53:23,351 --> 00:53:24,530
financially profitable platform to 
stream from.

1113
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,250
That's a big difference between

1114
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:31,250
that and pirating because pirating 
doesn't have any central location is 

1115
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,690
just they're just floating around.
The only central location was napster.

1116
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:36,330
Right?
So Nat Napster got taken down because of

1117
00:53:36,331 --> 00:53:39,060
that,
but napster was a really profitable like

1118
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:44,061
these spotify is.
They've figured out a way to sort of 

1119
00:53:44,061 --> 00:53:44,370
circumvent this whole downloading 
situation,

1120
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,700
make things streaming.
They stream everything.

1121
00:53:47,701 --> 00:53:52,170
There are alternatives to spotify,
like Jay z's service title.

1122
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,300
Yeah,
and there are equally criticized.

1123
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:59,480
Yeah,
except that one is owned by artists and 

1124
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,010
record labels and they have.
They have similar issues in trying to 

1125
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:03,210
pay actual artists because at the end of
the day,

1126
00:54:03,211 --> 00:54:05,010
if they raise the price of their 
service,

1127
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:09,090
if spotify goes from 10 bucks to 20,
people aren't going to have it.

1128
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:14,180
Well,
what are the percentage of people that 

1129
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:14,180
use spotify that actually pay?
I bet it's way less.

1130
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,040
I bet most people get the free spotify 
go quite fast.

1131
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:17,960
Majority.
Let's see.

1132
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:19,740
Let's see.
I'm sure that the data is out there.

1133
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:21,730
It's a good question,
but I don't think.

1134
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,780
I don't think people are paying for it.
I guess what I'm trying to get back to 

1135
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:28,020
it was just this idea that music just 
simply isn't as valuable as it was and I

1136
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:30,930
think that it's tough as an artist.
Again,

1137
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:34,850
like I can sense I consent.
I feel the pressure of artists right now

1138
00:54:34,890 --> 00:54:35,850
way you're saying,
yeah,

1139
00:54:35,851 --> 00:54:39,180
I know it's problematic in the way you 
economically,

1140
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,400
economically.
I'm not saying the value,

1141
00:54:41,401 --> 00:54:44,910
the inherent value in expression,
like maybe a better way to say it as the

1142
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:49,911
market is completely changed and 
dissolved there you can see it's not 

1143
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:52,761
that the work is less valuable.
It's arguably more valuable and 

1144
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:57,920
troubling times.
These are certainly troubling times and 

1145
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,160
music is a massive source of info 
inspiration and yes,

1146
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:04,370
and mood and enhancement and that's why 
I also occurred it by saying like it's 

1147
00:55:04,891 --> 00:55:05,140
more.

1148
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,660
It's arguably more important emotionally
and all the rest of it,

1149
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,960
but I'm just specifically talking about 
that I think until I think artists need 

1150
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,521
to recognize that and then they can use 
whatever system comes forth for how to 

1151
00:55:19,521 --> 00:55:20,620
deliver,
uh,

1152
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:25,650
the future of how we listen to music.
At least they're involved in that 

1153
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:28,590
process instead of just being like 
participating in the current one,

1154
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:32,690
like it's like you need to be on spotify
for a number of different reasons as an,

1155
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,760
as an emerging artist because that's the
way people are discovering music.

1156
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,430
So there's a lot of pressure there to 
participate even in the,

1157
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,510
even though you're not getting rewarded 
for it as an emerging artist,

1158
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,600
but as an artist that already is 
established well and established making 

1159
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:51,621
money and you realize that spotify needs
people like you in order to legitimize 

1160
00:55:51,621 --> 00:55:52,950
its company,
then it becomes an issue.

1161
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,320
Right?
Well,

1162
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,910
our subscriber growth in the last six 
months or two felt it was,

1163
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,040
what does that mean?
Okay,

1164
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,010
just 10 million paid subscribers,
apple music,

1165
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,380
10 million quota stats.
Now,

1166
00:56:04,381 --> 00:56:09,381
spotify just crossed $100.
Million total users paying number could 

1167
00:56:09,721 --> 00:56:12,510
be more than $30 million.
Why don't they tell you that?

1168
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:15,180
But what does that mean though?
That's not a real number.

1169
00:56:15,181 --> 00:56:17,340
They're saying could be more whenever 
someone says,

1170
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:19,410
could be more,
could be three people,

1171
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,350
could be more than $30 million,
but it could be like five dudes.

1172
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,890
Doesn't spotify announced as $20 million
paying subscriber.

1173
00:56:26,891 --> 00:56:28,690
Okay.
Back in June of 2015,

1174
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:34,020
spotify announced as 20 million paying 
subscribers with an ad based fee free 

1175
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:36,490
user base of $55 million.
Okay.

1176
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:41,550
That's a pretty 75 million total and $20
million paying subscribers.

1177
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,750
Huh?
See the problem is to.

1178
00:56:43,751 --> 00:56:48,751
They can.
They like if you have a podcast on it 

1179
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:48,751
and they can get rid of your ads,
they could put their own shit on it.

1180
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:52,600
They want us and I can't.
I'm not making an argument for spotify.

1181
00:56:52,601 --> 00:56:57,601
I'm just like,
I just peaked my interest in a number 

1182
00:56:57,601 --> 00:57:00,361
of.
A number of times that is being 

1183
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:00,361
discussed is like I think yeah,
big artists,

1184
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:01,730
they can take a stand.
Taylor swift can take a stand.

1185
00:57:01,731 --> 00:57:03,370
She doesn't need the 500,000
bucks,

1186
00:57:03,371 --> 00:57:05,410
but if you look at those numbers,
those numbers,

1187
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:06,620
that's a lot of money.
Yeah.

1188
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:11,110
You're talking about 75 million people,
so 50,

1189
00:57:11,111 --> 00:57:13,000
whatever they are.
Fifty dollars million.

1190
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:16,120
They're using ad revenue and then the 
other $25 million,

1191
00:57:16,121 --> 00:57:17,870
they're actually paying for the service 
and bucks.

1192
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:23,010
That's an insane amount of money.
Yet 75 million people paying $10 a 

1193
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:24,370
month,
but you can see 25 million people paying

1194
00:57:24,371 --> 00:57:28,270
$10 a month and then the other 50 just 
getting their ad revenue from.

1195
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:29,540
That's a lot of fucking people.
Yeah,

1196
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:31,380
but you can see that.
You can see the breakdown.

1197
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:34,060
It's not like a.
it's not like hand over fist.

1198
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,880
They're making money,
but it's still the record companies,

1199
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:39,310
the record companies,
the ones that are in charge of this,

1200
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:44,311
like they're.
They're massive contributors to these 

1201
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:44,311
shows.
Companies.

1202
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:44,311
Yeah,
of course.

1203
00:57:44,311 --> 00:57:47,320
So they figured out a new way to not pay
artists and to stay open.

1204
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,300
Stay valid.
Yeah.

1205
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:53,320
Artists appear to be people that get 
taken advantage of have been for the 

1206
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,930
last 15 years.
Jay z things,

1207
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:59,940
a great thing to have artists doing it,
but see he see he was charging more and,

1208
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,590
and that's why their user base there and
they're in trouble.

1209
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,360
Uh,
he apparently they're in trouble because

1210
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:09,361
they couldn't build a substantial user 
base at the cost they wanted to get he 

1211
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:09,361
charging well,
what is it,

1212
00:58:09,361 --> 00:58:10,160
like 20 bucks?
Yeah,

1213
00:58:10,161 --> 00:58:15,161
but a higher quality.
You're getting to your higher quality 

1214
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:15,161
audio.

1215
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:15,430
Yeah.
Lossless audio,

1216
00:58:15,431 --> 00:58:18,880
higher quality audio 20 people don't 
care about that though,

1217
00:58:18,881 --> 00:58:23,500
which is the issue it for free or get 
they just get the 3:20

1218
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:25,420
kilobyte because I can't hear the 
difference.

1219
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:30,890
It's really hard to.
Well I had an amp once that I attached 

1220
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,080
to my ipod.
I had an ipod and an ipad amp.

1221
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:33,610
I set it up once,
never using it again.

1222
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,610
It was bullshit,
like it's barely better.

1223
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:37,690
Convenience.
That's,

1224
00:58:37,691 --> 00:58:39,610
that's the thing.
Convenience.

1225
00:58:39,611 --> 00:58:41,860
In many ways,
trump's quality.

1226
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:45,130
The trumps your uh,
well that's the beauty of itunes.

1227
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:47,380
And then apple's music streaming 
service.

1228
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,450
We'll see.
But in the case of Itunes,

1229
00:58:49,451 --> 00:58:54,451
you can make the argument like apples 
then involved in the promotion of your 

1230
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:54,451
business.
Right?

1231
00:58:54,451 --> 00:58:58,291
Because they're getting a huge chunk of 
the biggest distribution of music right 

1232
00:58:58,291 --> 00:58:58,720
now.
If you wouldn't break it down that way,

1233
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,000
no cds are being sold at like best buy.

1234
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,460
Unless you can really search really hard
and find the one best.

1235
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:08,461
Buy The house.
Know who the fuck has cds anymore 

1236
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:10,840
through a Ct.
I had a white stripe cd in my office 

1237
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:10,840
that was cleaning out my office and I 
was sitting on my desk.

1238
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:10,900
I'm like,
I'm just gonna.

1239
00:59:10,901 --> 00:59:12,760
Throw this out.
I have it on my phone.

1240
00:59:12,761 --> 00:59:17,761
Why would I want.
I want a stupid copy of it that I'm not 

1241
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:17,761
going to plug in and where's the thought
on that?

1242
00:59:17,761 --> 00:59:19,690
I've been having a lot recently because 
I've seen some things happen.

1243
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:21,920
If all of the musiC,
like let's say

1244
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,930
speak your 10 favorite albums of all 
time,

1245
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,350
you Don't have them a physical copy of,
but you have like the.

1246
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,230
You have them saved on your apple music,
whatever it is,

1247
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:32,750
whatever service you pick,
if it's all in the cloud,

1248
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:37,220
they can technically go change that 
music whenever they choose to change it.

1249
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:42,430
Yeah.
Kanye west has been doing some really 

1250
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:44,261
recently right now where he put out an 
album on title last month and for about 

1251
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:46,130
a month they were kind of tweaking it.
They were changing the mastering on it.

1252
00:59:46,490 --> 00:59:49,370
They were changing the featured artists 
on it even on one song.

1253
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,190
So while it was up,
he was tweaking.

1254
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,440
He's gone back on another album that's 
already been out for a long time now and

1255
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:59,441
change some of the mastering on two of 
those songs and some people think he 

1256
00:59:59,441 --> 00:59:59,441
might be doing more.
No one knows what,

1257
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:00,140
but it's a thought that I've been having
that.

1258
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:05,560
Um,
one of my favorite albums I went to go 

1259
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:05,870
back and find that the track little 
orders out of it's out of order now.

1260
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:11,080
Some of the songs are missing and it's 
because that artist has decided not to 

1261
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,591
have to the portion of that album up on 
I or on spotify the way it originally 

1262
01:00:14,591 --> 01:00:15,470
was.
So if you wanted to have that album,

1263
01:00:15,471 --> 01:00:16,940
you need to own It.
The way,

1264
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:21,970
the way he put it out in 2011 where you 
never have that actual album you have 

1265
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:27,110
with whatever they have existing in the 
cloud and that's some deep shit or 

1266
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:27,260
that's some deep shit.

1267
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:32,660
See,
I support someone being able to do that 

1268
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:35,731
because that's kind of interesting like 
what he's doing by changing the 

1269
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:36,790
mastering and adding new tracks and 
fucking around with things.

1270
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
It actually is compelling like it makes 
you want to kind of tune into it and 

1271
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,301
it's very intelligent on his part.
I think he does like as dumb as that 

1272
01:00:45,301 --> 01:00:46,540
dude is egocentric [inaudible].
That dude Is.

1273
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,630
He's so ridiculous,
but he makes some really good moves.

1274
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:54,750
Like when he goes on this massive rant 
about bill cosby being innocent right 

1275
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:56,070
before it releases his shit.
I mean it's,

1276
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,110
It's a classic role.
Yeah.

1277
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,340
It's a little too much for me most of 
the time,

1278
01:01:00,341 --> 01:01:04,060
but he's so entwined in the world of 
hate though.

1279
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:09,100
He has so much hate coming at him.
It almost makes sense to cultivate that 

1280
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:11,230
hate and use it like judo,
which in the right direction.

1281
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:13,810
He knows what he's doing for sure.
One hundred percent,

1282
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:18,900
100 percent.
It happened when he tweets something 

1283
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:18,900
crazy.
I mean,

1284
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,510
look,
do you really Think he thinks bill 

1285
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:21,510
cosby's in a sense.
Get the fuck outta here.

1286
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:25,501
Nobody thinks bill cosby's innocent.
Even bill cosby sitting around with his 

1287
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:25,650
one fucking good.
I going,

1288
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:29,800
maybe I did rape those girls.
Even he Is like coming to terms with the

1289
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:32,560
fact that you might be a piece of shit.
His wife left him.

1290
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:33,830
I mean even that crazy wife,
uh,

1291
01:01:33,831 --> 01:01:36,130
his smile through all those interviews,
she's like,

1292
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:38,560
I'm ghost dark.
That's dark.

1293
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:40,300
you look at those interviews and you 
watch her.

1294
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:42,370
Like she's smiling.
She knows,

1295
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:44,470
she knows something's up.
Well,

1296
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:49,500
she's been protected by royalty for so 
long because he existed as a celebrity 

1297
01:01:49,631 --> 01:01:53,680
in a strange time when an artist can get
away with almost anything.

1298
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,030
I mean you Were in a bubble.

1299
01:01:55,030 --> 01:01:58,030
You were different.
And I think that being in a bubble.

1300
01:01:58,031 --> 01:02:03,031
And also I think for a guy like you were
I to try to even understand what it's 

1301
01:02:03,031 --> 01:02:06,160
like to be as famous as bill cosby.
It's impossible.

1302
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:11,370
I think it's probably an unmanageable 
level of fame at a certain point in his 

1303
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:11,370
life,
you know,

1304
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:15,370
especially when he had bIll cosby 
himself and the cosby show and nbc.

1305
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,510
He was fucking royalty man and during 
that time he was inviting these girls to

1306
01:02:20,511 --> 01:02:25,511
come over and read scripts and suck his 
dick and fucking drugging them and 

1307
01:02:25,511 --> 01:02:25,890
they'd wake up with her panties down by 
their ankles and,

1308
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,350
and their hair.
They dIdn't know what the fuck was going

1309
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:31,110
on and he just got away with it over and
over and over again.

1310
01:02:31,290 --> 01:02:33,840
And because he got away with it because 
of the way people treated him,

1311
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:39,080
it's sort of fostered this rear really 
crazy sociopathic behavior that he had.

1312
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,730
Did he.
Where does that stand?

1313
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,930
Oh,
he's going to jail.

1314
01:02:42,931 --> 01:02:43,980
He is.
Oh yeah,

1315
01:02:43,981 --> 01:02:48,981
they're going to.
They're trying him and he's got the 

1316
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:48,981
criminal case is gonna go,
go forward.

1317
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:53,720
The judge already ruled that she had 
signed some shit saying that she 

1318
01:02:53,761 --> 01:02:58,280
couldn't testIfy against him,
that she wouldn't bring charges and that

1319
01:02:58,281 --> 01:03:00,180
she wouldn't reveal the details of the 
case.

1320
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,130
But then she did reveal the details of 
the case.

1321
01:03:02,131 --> 01:03:04,260
So you know what he did?
He sued her,

1322
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:09,090
so he's suing her for going back on her 
deal because he paid her off.

1323
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:14,360
I think he paid her like several million
dollars to keep her mouth shut and 

1324
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:19,040
because she is now talking about it now,
he's suing her for that money back.

1325
01:03:19,890 --> 01:03:24,120
And the argument was that because they 
had made this deal,

1326
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:29,270
he shouldn't be able to be prosecuted,
but unfortunately for him the deal that 

1327
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:30,270
he had made was a verbal deal only.

1328
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,630
There was nothing written down.
This is one of the things that the judge

1329
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:35,520
had said like,
you got to get this shit written down,

1330
01:03:35,521 --> 01:03:37,380
dude,
we're going to trial.

1331
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,510
So he's.
He's going to be charged.

1332
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:44,511
And it was recently announced it over 
the last couple of days that they're 

1333
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:48,410
charging him.
There's a criminal case on me and he's 

1334
01:03:48,410 --> 01:03:51,501
an old old man with half an eyeball.
Would that be a jury in that case?

1335
01:03:51,581 --> 01:03:52,950
That's a good question.
Or a judge?

1336
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:58,010
I don't know.
That's a very good question because you 

1337
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:58,650
gotta wonder being a juror up against 
bill cosby.

1338
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,590
I don't think anybody would think that 
he's innocent at this point in time.

1339
01:04:01,591 --> 01:04:02,950
I don't think anybody thinks he's 
innocent.

1340
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:08,090
Right.
I think it's the water's completely 

1341
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:08,090
tainted in a way.
Kanye west,

1342
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,790
he believes that.
I think in a way what they're doing.

1343
01:04:11,791 --> 01:04:12,960
Well,
chuck d,

1344
01:04:12,961 --> 01:04:17,520
that was one of the fucking sad as shit.
Chuck d was calling him dr cosby.

1345
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,510
Why is that?
Because of the show.

1346
01:04:21,511 --> 01:04:23,610
Was he a doctor on the show?
Because he's a doctor,

1347
01:04:23,611 --> 01:04:26,740
lIke an honorary degree.
They retracted.

1348
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:30,930
Oh,
so he was calling from public enemy.

1349
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:33,000
What does with those titles?
You know,

1350
01:04:33,001 --> 01:04:38,001
like you're a doctor,
so everywhere you go everyone has to 

1351
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:38,001
call you doctor.
He actually wanted people to call him dr

1352
01:04:38,001 --> 01:04:39,420
cosby.
That was one of his things.

1353
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,790
He's so fucking weird guy,
man.

1354
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,860
I've told this story before,
but I'll say it again just for you.

1355
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:47,430
There was a show that I did in seattle,
the seattle area,

1356
01:04:47,431 --> 01:04:52,431
this casino,
and one of the people that was working 

1357
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,390
there said that cosby used to have these
people sit down before the show.

1358
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,870
He had the.
All the employees like the ushers,

1359
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,940
the door people,
they sit down and watch him eat dinner,

1360
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:04,170
who sit there and eat curry and they had
to watch him stand in the room and watch

1361
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:05,880
him eat well before the show.

1362
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,330
Watch him watching me.
It's one of those things you want people

1363
01:05:10,331 --> 01:05:15,331
to watch him eat his curry so you'd sit 
down there and eat and they would all 

1364
01:05:15,331 --> 01:05:15,580
just stand there and say nothing.
They weren't allowed to talk.

1365
01:05:15,790 --> 01:05:20,380
They sit down there and watch them eat 
and he also had security guards tuck him

1366
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:25,410
in bed at night like you'd go and lay 
down in his bed and he wanted them to 

1367
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:25,940
tuck him in.
Shut the lights out.

1368
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:30,040
Let me ask you this.
Is this the case of justIce?

1369
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:35,041
Severely fucked up individual or it's 
just the case of have a relatively 

1370
01:05:35,041 --> 01:05:39,631
normal individual getting fucked up by 
circumstances like being this super 

1371
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,720
famous theorist.
You're responsible for getting fucked 

1372
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,301
up.
If you're a normal person and you get 

1373
01:05:48,301 --> 01:05:48,301
super famous and you become fucked up,
you are responsible.

1374
01:05:48,301 --> 01:05:49,720
It's like a high percentage do though.
Yeah,

1375
01:05:49,721 --> 01:05:50,650
but not in that way.

1376
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,440
That's an extreme version.
It's a different kind of way.

1377
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:58,500
Ego ego might get in the way and trip 
off a lot of people who might trip over 

1378
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:00,520
the dick of ego.
That's comment I saw when,

1379
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:05,521
um,
when prince died recently I signed 

1380
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:05,521
infographic.
I don't even know.

1381
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:08,790
Maybe you tweeted it about the average 
age of male pop stars when they die.

1382
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:11,040
I dunno,
I dunno who tweeted it.

1383
01:06:11,041 --> 01:06:14,830
It was how he was the exact age,
55 or whatever age he was.

1384
01:06:14,831 --> 01:06:16,780
Fifty four,
somewhere in there.

1385
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,540
That that's the average age for a male 
pops are female.

1386
01:06:19,541 --> 01:06:20,800
Wasn't too different either.
Well,

1387
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:23,210
his situation was he was addicted to 
painkillers,

1388
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:24,880
painkillers,
pink pill pull out.

1389
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:29,400
It just recently recently came out that 
he had overdosed by.

1390
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:31,660
He had been refusing treatment for aids 
as well.

1391
01:06:32,170 --> 01:06:33,940
Is that true?
I don't know if that's true.

1392
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:34,430
Oh really?

1393
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:35,080
Yeah.
Let's,

1394
01:06:35,081 --> 01:06:38,320
let's look that up.
But I know for sure he had a hip issue,

1395
01:06:38,530 --> 01:06:43,530
like a severe hip problem that he 
probably need hip surgery and he was 

1396
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,130
taking pain medication and he had had 
overdosed on pain medication.

1397
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:45,340
Yeah.
Yeah.

1398
01:06:45,341 --> 01:06:50,341
No,
he was definitely addicted to pain 

1399
01:06:50,341 --> 01:06:51,871
medications while I just realized I just
remembered a story coming out shortly 

1400
01:06:51,871 --> 01:06:52,740
after about hiv that he had believed 
that,

1401
01:06:52,810 --> 01:06:57,040
that he wasn't going to take treatment.
Print suffered from aids,

1402
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:59,560
but refuse treatment.
Believed god will cure him.

1403
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,180
Us tabloid claims.
See?

1404
01:07:01,660 --> 01:07:02,110
Yeah.
See,

1405
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:06,190
that's a us tablet clamps.
But he was a christian scientist.

1406
01:07:06,191 --> 01:07:11,191
Wasn't near a jehovah's witness.
Jehovah's witness don't use the medicine

1407
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:12,490
medicine,
right?

1408
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,110
Isn't that what's going on?
Because he.

1409
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:19,120
Cause he got it back in a minute.
Then how the fuck is he taking pain 

1410
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,120
pills then?
Supposedly he was on opiates too,

1411
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:19,150
so I don't think.

1412
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:20,360
Well that's pain pills.
Yeah.

1413
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:23,020
That doesn't make that logic doesn't 
make sense I suppose.

1414
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:28,110
Well,
people are just fucking convenient with 

1415
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:28,110
their logic on thing.
yeah.

1416
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:28,110
The things that weird guy,
man.

1417
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:32,970
First of all,
prince was like androgynous and is all 

1418
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:32,970
about free love anymore.
High heels,

1419
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:34,150
but he didn't like gay people.
Do you know,

1420
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:39,151
one of the things that prince prince is 
like a known homophobe and one of the 

1421
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:39,151
things that he said in a recent 
interview,

1422
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:43,771
and I hate to disparage him in his death
because he was a brilliant artist and 

1423
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:47,401
all that good stuff,
but he was talking about how one of the 

1424
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:50,380
problems with the world today is that 
god said all these rules and then people

1425
01:07:50,381 --> 01:07:55,381
just decide they want to stick their 
dick and this whole with that hole and 

1426
01:07:55,381 --> 01:07:55,780
just do anything they want to do and you
can't do that.

1427
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:58,280
And they were asking them about gay 
marriage and you know,

1428
01:07:58,360 --> 01:08:00,310
he was saying that this is not what god 
wanted.

1429
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:03,460
This is not what god asked for.
Like see if you can find the exact quote

1430
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:08,461
because it was pretty disturbing coming 
from a guy that you expect because of 

1431
01:08:08,461 --> 01:08:12,391
his sort of androgynous nature and how 
weird you think he's like going further 

1432
01:08:12,391 --> 01:08:15,380
in that direction because he's getting 
older.

1433
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:15,740
No,
no,

1434
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:15,920
no,
no,

1435
01:08:15,921 --> 01:08:18,170
no.
I meant just maybe because of his actual

1436
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:19,910
personal experience,
like,

1437
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,070
like in a way,
you know,

1438
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:24,290
some people they overcompensate on one 
side.

1439
01:08:24,470 --> 01:08:29,470
Honestly,
I think with prince was based on what 

1440
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:33,371
I've seen of his interviews,
I think he was insanely sheltered 

1441
01:08:33,371 --> 01:08:37,210
because he was so famous in that he 
could basically say anything and nobody 

1442
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:41,951
would disagree with him and he he 
cultivated some really fucking wacky 

1443
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:41,951
opinions.
First of all,

1444
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:46,661
he believed that the government was 
spraying things in the sky that made 

1445
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:46,661
people fight in the ghetto.

1446
01:08:46,661 --> 01:08:46,970
I remember that.
I heard that interview.

1447
01:08:47,180 --> 01:08:48,440
Yeah,
it's insane.

1448
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:53,500
It was like everybody would be fine and 
then they would be spraying the sky and 

1449
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:55,010
then why is everybody fighting?
Why are we all fighting?

1450
01:08:55,011 --> 01:09:00,011
Because you're poor.
You're living in the ghetto and there's 

1451
01:09:00,011 --> 01:09:01,340
crime and that's just what happens.
Crime riddled areas.

1452
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:04,400
There's violence.
It's not the government spraying the sky

1453
01:09:04,401 --> 01:09:08,240
like what a random thing to do.
The government just decided to spray the

1454
01:09:08,241 --> 01:09:11,060
entire city and then hope that everybody
beats the shit out of each other.

1455
01:09:11,061 --> 01:09:12,470
For what purpose?
Very convenient.

1456
01:09:12,471 --> 01:09:14,450
They have money in ambulances,
like what?

1457
01:09:14,451 --> 01:09:16,580
Where's the.
Where's the profit margin in this?

1458
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:19,820
Millions of dollars a spraying the sky 
with anger,

1459
01:09:19,821 --> 01:09:24,821
chemicals and what fucking chemicals 
have been proven to make people angry 

1460
01:09:24,821 --> 01:09:25,270
when you sprayed from the sky?
Um,

1461
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:30,700
yeah.
Whiskey vapor probably be more fucking 

1462
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:30,880
and hugging.
I mean,

1463
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:33,380
what percentage of people actually get 
angry when they get drunk?

1464
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,600
There's another one because think about 
all the people that go to bars,

1465
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:36,270
right?
Yeah.

1466
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,750
You get up fucking bar filled with 
people.

1467
01:09:38,751 --> 01:09:43,751
You've got a thousand people in there.
How many of them become angry when 

1468
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:43,751
they're drunk?
It's not even one.

1469
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:48,250
It's a small percent.
It's a very rare thing that people get 

1470
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:48,250
super angry and violent because they're 
drunk.

1471
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,090
Most like,
I get happY.

1472
01:09:50,091 --> 01:09:53,300
Same when I'm drunk.
I'm hugging and laughing and I might get

1473
01:09:53,301 --> 01:09:55,190
a little obnoxious,
but I'm not mean.

1474
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,470
I'm definitely not looking to start 
fights.

1475
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,540
So yeah,
that's a weird one.

1476
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,680
I think,
um,

1477
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,570
some people will say like,
hey,

1478
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:04,220
that's,
that guy is an angry drunk.

1479
01:10:04,221 --> 01:10:05,570
Like you've heard that people are.
Yeah.

1480
01:10:05,571 --> 01:10:10,571
You've heard that before.
But is that just maybe who they are all 

1481
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:12,350
the time?
I think there's a deep seated.

1482
01:10:12,351 --> 01:10:17,351
Yeah,
and then the alcohol sort of course is 

1483
01:10:17,351 --> 01:10:17,351
it out of them?

1484
01:10:17,351 --> 01:10:20,030
Maybe the alcohol releases your 
inhibitions and you're angry.

1485
01:10:20,031 --> 01:10:23,330
What does it say?
Prince denies anti gay rights remarks.

1486
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,180
New yorker stands by story.
This is from 2008.

1487
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:26,990
Yeah,
but see,

1488
01:10:26,991 --> 01:10:30,410
the problem is they quoted him.
It was like there were direct quotes.

1489
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:31,440
He.
Well,

1490
01:10:31,770 --> 01:10:34,190
as far as this story came out,
I'm assuming when he died,

1491
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:36,010
a lot of coats came out and stuff you 
said in this,

1492
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:38,240
this story which I traced back,
which was when he was still alive,

1493
01:10:38,241 --> 01:10:41,060
obviously he came out after the story 
came out,

1494
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:46,061
the new yorker said he was grossly 
misquoted and they took everything I 

1495
01:10:46,061 --> 01:10:46,061
said out of context.
right?

1496
01:10:46,061 --> 01:10:47,180
Stood by their story.
However.

1497
01:10:47,210 --> 01:10:49,160
Well,
let's read the context though.

1498
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:52,100
I mean even when you read the actual 
quote itself,

1499
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,990
here's the quote.
It's a little bit higher.

1500
01:10:53,991 --> 01:10:54,550
There we go.
Sponsor.

1501
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,630
He goes,
you got the republicans.

1502
01:10:56,631 --> 01:10:58,460
Basically they want to live according to
the bible,

1503
01:10:58,461 --> 01:11:00,260
but there's a problem with 
interpretation.

1504
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,970
uh,
and you've got some churches,

1505
01:11:01,971 --> 01:11:04,850
some people basically doing things and 
saying comes from here,

1506
01:11:04,851 --> 01:11:09,851
but it doesn't.
Then you've got the opposite of the 

1507
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:09,851
spectrum.
You got blue,

1508
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:09,851
you've got the democrats,
and they're like,

1509
01:11:09,851 --> 01:11:10,430
you could do whatever you want,
gay marriage,

1510
01:11:10,431 --> 01:11:12,050
whatever,
but neither of them is right.

1511
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,610
I'm asked about his perspective

1512
01:11:14,610 --> 01:11:16,020
on social issues.
Gay marriage,

1513
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:21,021
abortion.
Prince tapped his bible and said god 

1514
01:11:21,021 --> 01:11:23,790
came to earth and saw people sticking it
wherever and doing it with whatever,

1515
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,550
and he just cleared it all out.
He was like,

1516
01:11:26,551 --> 01:11:28,230
enough,
okay.

1517
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:33,740
That's hilarious because a lot of people
fucked each other in the ass listening 

1518
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:37,041
to let's go crazy how many people,
how many people suck?

1519
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:39,720
Cock,
because it was like,

1520
01:11:39,721 --> 01:11:42,300
we're going to party like it's 1999.
And they just said,

1521
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:44,970
fuck it.
I'll just do ecstasy in my asshole.

1522
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,000
You know?
I mean it's,

1523
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,660
I think he's sheltered or was sheltered 
and I think he's a brilliant,

1524
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:57,170
like,
like the outlier of outliers when it 

1525
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:59,070
comes to brilliant artists and I think 
that you just,

1526
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,740
you by yourself to luck too much.
You don't,

1527
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:03,630
you don't get to mingle,
you don't get to hang with.

1528
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,400
You don't have real conversations.

1529
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:08,520
But that's why I say like even in the 
case of bill cosby,

1530
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:13,590
are we looking at a condition of the 
circumstance because if we have data 

1531
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,130
that says,
hey,

1532
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,700
pop stars are dying,
I'm 30 years before any regular public 

1533
01:12:19,860 --> 01:12:24,860
on average like these,
these people obviously have an unusual 

1534
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:26,400
enough circumstance that it's affecting 
all of them the same.

1535
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:31,460
Unless the type of people drawn to that 
career in the first place are already 

1536
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,610
substantially different than the rest of
the public.

1537
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:37,850
Well,
they're definitely substantially 

1538
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:37,850
different than the rest of the public in
that they've developed as an entertainer

1539
01:12:37,850 --> 01:12:42,530
from their formative years.
I mean prince was an artist and a 

1540
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,550
musician when he was very young and then
when he came out with,

1541
01:12:44,551 --> 01:12:47,490
I want to be your lover.
I think he was only like 20 years old or

1542
01:12:47,491 --> 01:12:52,491
something like that.
How old was he when I wanna be your 

1543
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:52,491
lover came out?

1544
01:12:52,491 --> 01:12:52,780
Yeah,
definitely.

1545
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:55,550
Yeah,
that was a fucking jam too.

1546
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:00,580
God damn,
that was a good song because I remember 

1547
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:00,580
I was living in boston.
I'm 48.

1548
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:02,610
He was 55,
so he's not that much older than me.

1549
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:06,600
When he died and I was living in boston 
when that song came out and it was a jaw

1550
01:13:06,601 --> 01:13:07,410
dropper,
I was like,

1551
01:13:07,411 --> 01:13:11,330
who is this guy with no shirt on and the
cover trying.

1552
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:12,870
You're trying to figure out what the 
hell it is,

1553
01:13:12,871 --> 01:13:17,100
20 or 21,
20 or 21 and that is a fucking beautiful

1554
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:22,101
songs to this day.
I'll play that song out of nowhere and 

1555
01:13:22,101 --> 01:13:22,860
it's just,
it's who was an amazing artist.

1556
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,070
So if he was that good at 20,
21,

1557
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:30,120
I mean he was involved in music from the
time he was a small boy.

1558
01:13:30,121 --> 01:13:35,121
So he developed in a very bizarre and 
strange way and was under the microphone

1559
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:37,140
at an incredibly young age.

1560
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:42,680
Went to be that huge at 20 years old and
also to be such a revolutionary guy when

1561
01:13:44,281 --> 01:13:48,060
it came to style and fashion today I had
an overcoat when I was like 21,

1562
01:13:48,360 --> 01:13:52,500
a long overcoat because I saw principle 
just to listen to prince music.

1563
01:13:52,501 --> 01:13:54,990
I loved prince when I was a kid.
He was so good.

1564
01:13:54,991 --> 01:13:57,150
It was so different and interesting.
You know,

1565
01:13:57,780 --> 01:13:59,670
with so many good songs like 
controversy,

1566
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:02,910
you know,
he had some and then also like some guys

1567
01:14:02,911 --> 01:14:07,911
sort of like came along with him like 
morris day and the time because they 

1568
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:11,511
were in purple rain.
TheY sort of came along with him and 

1569
01:14:11,511 --> 01:14:11,511
they got famous for a brief period of 
time too.

1570
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:12,970
He was amazing,
man.

1571
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,250
It was amazing.
But I thinK I've always said this,

1572
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,020
that I think you can't.
There's,

1573
01:14:17,150 --> 01:14:21,880
there's a balance in this World that you
can achieve when you achieve greatness,

1574
01:14:22,030 --> 01:14:23,650
when you achieve that kind of greatness.

1575
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:28,650
I think it's at this,
at that is that the sacrifice of 

1576
01:14:28,650 --> 01:14:31,411
balance,
whether it's balancing your social life 

1577
01:14:31,411 --> 01:14:32,570
or balance in your,
your ability to have a,

1578
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:37,160
a healthy and a objective perspective.
I think in order like,

1579
01:14:37,170 --> 01:14:42,170
and I think that's what we're seeing 
with kanye west to in order to like 

1580
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:45,301
really go after something and just be 
obsessed with it to the point of just 

1581
01:14:45,301 --> 01:14:47,380
carving out this magnificent diamond of 
art.

1582
01:14:47,650 --> 01:14:50,950
You got to be a fucking nuts man.
You've got to be richard pryor.

1583
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:52,600
You know,
you gotta be nuts.

1584
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:55,840
You gotta be out of your fucking mind to
make something perfect,

1585
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,750
and what he made was perfect.
I mean,

1586
01:14:58,780 --> 01:15:02,530
purple rain is god damn perfect.
He was perfect.

1587
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:05,770
This is shit that he did that you just 
to this day,

1588
01:15:05,771 --> 01:15:07,660
you just go,
god damn.

1589
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:12,720
He was so good that all the other stuff 
is probably a symptom of a lack of 

1590
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:19,920
balance and development and his overall 
life that led to this incredible 

1591
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:20,560
brilliance and his art form.

1592
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,510
Right?
So there has to be.

1593
01:15:22,570 --> 01:15:23,890
It has to be.
You have to sacrifice,

1594
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:28,891
you have to take from somewhere where 
they say james cameron's out of his 

1595
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:28,891
fucking mind frame.
They say,

1596
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:29,680
James Cameron is out of his fucking 
mind,

1597
01:15:29,681 --> 01:15:31,030
and if you're on a set with james 
hamman,

1598
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:36,031
like if someone's painting a wall,
he'll fucking take the paint brush away 

1599
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:36,031
from you.
I can do it like this.

1600
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:36,640
And they'll start doing it.
Right.

1601
01:15:36,641 --> 01:15:38,980
It's got to be like this because he's a 
madman.

1602
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:43,981
And that's why,
I mean James Cameron made a fucking 

1603
01:15:43,981 --> 01:15:43,981
submarine and went to the bottom of the 
ocean with it.

1604
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:45,880
You know about all that I heard about 
that.

1605
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:50,380
He was researching for the record,
for know for his new movie.

1606
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:55,920
It's going to do avatar to underwater 
this crazy fuck his filming shit under 

1607
01:15:56,411 --> 01:16:01,411
water.
I mean he's not just like a 

1608
01:16:01,411 --> 01:16:01,411
groundbreaking guy.

1609
01:16:01,411 --> 01:16:05,070
He's like the groundbreaking guys are 
calling him up for advice because he's 

1610
01:16:05,070 --> 01:16:06,430
way ahead of everybody.
He's a maniac.

1611
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,520
He's making a fucking submarine to film 
a movie and he's breaking world records 

1612
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:13,510
in a single manned submarine.
Look at this.

1613
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,820
This is him.
I mean this is.

1614
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:20,880
He fucking went to the bottom of the 
ocean by himself in this fucking thing 

1615
01:16:21,281 --> 01:16:23,020
that he created.
I mean,

1616
01:16:23,021 --> 01:16:27,820
he's revolutionizing the science behind 
filming underwater things so that he can

1617
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:30,340
make movies.
You think anybody tells him what to do.

1618
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:32,530
Who the fuck?
Tell him what to do.

1619
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,300
Like nobody,
like none of nobody.

1620
01:16:34,301 --> 01:16:37,000
He's wife better shut the fuck up to 
everybody,

1621
01:16:37,001 --> 01:16:42,001
but shut the fuck up.
You're James Cameron talks when they're 

1622
01:16:42,001 --> 01:16:42,670
about to make a movie and he goes in 
there and it's just like they just write

1623
01:16:42,671 --> 01:16:44,950
the check and get the fuck out of.
They don't even write checks.

1624
01:16:44,951 --> 01:16:49,951
No,
I bet he probably writes the checks and 

1625
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:49,951
then they wrote a check to and what 
after it's all over.

1626
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:54,650
He's insanely wealthy,
insanely brilliant and some of his 

1627
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:55,240
movies are some of the greatest movies 
of all time.

1628
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:58,210
I mean he's just,
he's just knows how to do it big.

1629
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:59,020
Like,
you know,

1630
01:16:59,021 --> 01:17:04,021
there's some people that thought like 
avatar was both pocahontas and spoons 

1631
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:04,021
like stop,
look,

1632
01:17:04,021 --> 01:17:08,551
yes,
there's iconic themes that exist in a 

1633
01:17:08,551 --> 01:17:09,370
bunch of different mediums,
but that movie is fucking amazing.

1634
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:09,980
And if you

1635
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:13,510
overthink it and you say over the soil 
food,

1636
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:18,670
this is fucking wow.
you mean you could say the same for a 

1637
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:18,670
lot of the classic stories,
but he just,

1638
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:23,360
he nailed this insane version of that 
genre.

1639
01:17:23,361 --> 01:17:28,361
It's like a rock and roll song.
Like there's some classic rock and roll 

1640
01:17:28,361 --> 01:17:31,700
themes that you would,
you'd see if you heard this song is like

1641
01:17:32,420 --> 01:17:36,740
themes and songs that you can just kind 
of accept because it's cool to hear them

1642
01:17:36,741 --> 01:17:41,510
in songs and that's essentially what 
he's done on a grand scale or an avatar.

1643
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,070
Yeah,
no doubt.

1644
01:17:43,100 --> 01:17:44,160
No dispute.
Yeah.

1645
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:49,500
Cameron's a bad ass pad motherfucker.
To be that bad of a motherfucker.

1646
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,040
You got to be crazy.
He's making for avatar.

1647
01:17:52,060 --> 01:17:53,410
Sequel.
Yeah.

1648
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,990
You got to be a bad motherfucker to do 
that,

1649
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,190
you know,
but I imagine the stress,

1650
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,710
the stress of having that project.
Yeah.

1651
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:04,290
Oh yeah.
Moving people around.

1652
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:05,270
Oh my god.
Yeah.

1653
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:10,600
GeTting location and go to the bottom of
the ocean and that's the only way to 

1654
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:10,760
make a movie.
You can't make a movie by yourself.

1655
01:18:10,850 --> 01:18:12,170
No.
You got to have actors.

1656
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:14,030
You've got to read the script.
Todd.

1657
01:18:14,031 --> 01:18:17,120
I have a guy who points the camera.
I hate the whole.

1658
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:18,980
All that.
All the baggage.

1659
01:18:18,981 --> 01:18:20,780
All the people.
it's a nightmare.

1660
01:18:20,781 --> 01:18:22,610
It's weight.
That's why I'm a comedian,

1661
01:18:22,611 --> 01:18:24,320
dude.
That's really simple.

1662
01:18:24,410 --> 01:18:25,520
Well,
that's why I'm on youtube.

1663
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:28,010
So simple.
Just do whatever you want.

1664
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:30,890
I had a bit of a nightmare situation out
here.

1665
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,190
Out here.
Yeah,

1666
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:34,100
out here.
it's why I'm out here.

1667
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:36,770
I'm ouT here to be here on this show 
right now,

1668
01:18:36,771 --> 01:18:38,600
but yesterday I was,
you know,

1669
01:18:38,601 --> 01:18:40,580
it was on.
I was on set.

1670
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:45,610
I had to shoot this day.
I'm not gonna mention any brands or 

1671
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:47,360
names,
but it's like fucking 100 people on set,

1672
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:48,530
of course.

1673
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:53,700
I mean,
you don't need them and then they want 

1674
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,200
to try the ges and the soup.
Yes.

1675
01:18:54,201 --> 01:18:59,201
Yeah,
that's the best way to put it and it's 

1676
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:02,411
just.
How about if you wear a different suit 

1677
01:19:02,411 --> 01:19:05,501
for every different segment?
It's like I've made over 850 fucking 

1678
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:09,760
product videos that millions of people 
choose to watch,

1679
01:19:09,761 --> 01:19:10,880
choose,
choose.

1680
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:14,450
This is not one of these situations 
where you've got to stick it in front of

1681
01:19:14,451 --> 01:19:16,670
their face on the way to where they're 
going.

1682
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:21,850
This is something people like,
like let me look at the god damn thing 

1683
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:21,980
and get excited about it.
Well guess what?

1684
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,200
News flash.
We don't have to fake it.

1685
01:19:24,590 --> 01:19:29,590
They fake shit that doesn't need to be 
faked because it fits the protocol of 

1686
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:30,980
the machine.
You know what I mean?

1687
01:19:31,330 --> 01:19:34,670
It's like it just sucks the life out of 
all of it.

1688
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:38,060
Like I think there's this thing that 
happens.

1689
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:39,950
I mean,
and granted whatever,

1690
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:45,010
james cameron's brilliant and the shit 
they do in hollywood is fucking amazing 

1691
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:49,511
and all the rest of it.
But I'm in this weird situation where 

1692
01:19:49,511 --> 01:19:49,511
like,
I'm the guy.

1693
01:19:49,511 --> 01:19:51,410
Yeah,
I'm not acting right.

1694
01:19:51,710 --> 01:19:56,710
I'm the guy.
So if I go on this thing and I don't 

1695
01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:56,780
look like the guy,
well that's not why I'm here.

1696
01:19:56,781 --> 01:20:01,781
like what are they trying to change?
Like what are they specifically fucking 

1697
01:20:01,781 --> 01:20:01,781
with?
Oh man,

1698
01:20:01,781 --> 01:20:03,110
all of it.
You may love it.

1699
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:04,370
You name it.
That's so great.

1700
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:05,660
Okay,
so here's an example.

1701
01:20:05,661 --> 01:20:09,150
Like when I do my videos,
I want everything to be live.

1702
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:11,760
Everything we shoot three concurrent 
angles.

1703
01:20:11,761 --> 01:20:12,930
If we catch it,
we catch it.

1704
01:20:13,260 --> 01:20:16,110
If we don't so be it.
That's what it was.

1705
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:17,190
Right?
So it's authentic.

1706
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,870
Yeah.
Because I want to capture like,

1707
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:24,050
you know,
I feel like your relationship with the 

1708
01:20:24,050 --> 01:20:24,050
product is a lot like a relationship 
with another person.

1709
01:20:24,090 --> 01:20:29,090
Now you can.
You guys think I'm perverted at this 

1710
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:29,090
point.
I don't mean in tHat way,

1711
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:29,090
joe.
Okay.

1712
01:20:29,090 --> 01:20:29,130
Okay.
I didn't say anything,

1713
01:20:29,131 --> 01:20:29,830
dude.
You just,

1714
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,180
just the way you're looking at me 
looking at you that way all the time,

1715
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:40,220
but I'm saying it's like,
it's like this process of like getting 

1716
01:20:40,220 --> 01:20:40,620
to know the thing and well,
as a person who watches you,

1717
01:20:40,621 --> 01:20:41,480
sorry to interrupt you,
but yeah,

1718
01:20:41,590 --> 01:20:46,590
that authenticity comes through and it's
one of the reasons why your videos are 

1719
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:47,560
so compelling because like when you open
up a video and you're checking out a new

1720
01:20:47,561 --> 01:20:51,520
phone and you're going over the edges 
and you're experiencing it for the first

1721
01:20:51,521 --> 01:20:53,460
time with the person that's watching the
video.

1722
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:58,640
Yes.
I want to be you the proxy version of 

1723
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:02,121
you.
like how would you engage with this 

1724
01:21:02,121 --> 01:21:04,491
thing?
And in many cases the defacto standard 

1725
01:21:04,491 --> 01:21:05,400
for these types of videos was like a 
person who had,

1726
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,020
um,
was,

1727
01:21:07,060 --> 01:21:08,820
was,
was more sort of journalistic.

1728
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:10,140
Like they had it.
They're,

1729
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:12,360
they're,
they're expected to make a report on the

1730
01:21:12,361 --> 01:21:12,840
thing.
And he's like,

1731
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:14,130
that's cool.
I respect that.

1732
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:19,160
That's part of it too.
but at the same time it's like it 

1733
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:22,431
doesn't,
that part of it doesn't necessarily 

1734
01:21:22,431 --> 01:21:22,431
capture the excitement associated with 
the thing,

1735
01:21:22,431 --> 01:21:26,391
the oohs and aahs and and all that kind 
of natural reaction,

1736
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,400
which is impossible to fake all the rest
of it.

1737
01:21:29,401 --> 01:21:31,620
You can all the rest of it when it comes
to like,

1738
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:33,780
let's do that line again because I don't
know,

1739
01:21:33,781 --> 01:21:35,490
I didn't say you didn't say the spec,
right,

1740
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:37,770
or whatever.
Like that would be the equivalent of the

1741
01:21:37,771 --> 01:21:42,771
situation I was in yesterday.
But it's like I'm willing to sacrifice 

1742
01:21:42,771 --> 01:21:44,070
some of that to get the intangible 
stuff,

1743
01:21:44,160 --> 01:21:47,280
which is the oohs and ahs that will 
never happen again.

1744
01:21:47,281 --> 01:21:49,460
Not in the same way,
you know.

1745
01:21:49,930 --> 01:21:50,230
No,
I,

1746
01:21:50,231 --> 01:21:55,231
I agree with you and I think that you 
understand what you're doing and you 

1747
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:58,861
understand the appeal of what you're 
doing and to sacrifice that,

1748
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:04,440
to polish it,
to make it more professional or to make 

1749
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:08,240
them.
That's actually going to lessen the 

1750
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:08,240
appeal of it.
And that's what they don't understand.

1751
01:22:08,240 --> 01:22:11,581
It's a fine line.
It's like those fucking videos where 

1752
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:14,161
people have these edits every five 
seconds they say something is a cut and 

1753
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:17,761
they say something as a cut,
you know that style of youtube video 

1754
01:22:17,761 --> 01:22:18,190
cut,
that shit is gross man and there's a guy

1755
01:22:18,191 --> 01:22:23,191
who did that recently.
It was a video about bow hunting and 

1756
01:22:23,191 --> 01:22:25,270
he's trying to do that style and bow 
hunting,

1757
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:27,790
which is one of the most organic,
visceral,

1758
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:30,910
primal things you could ever engage in 
as a human being.

1759
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:35,020
You're going to go out and collect your 
food with a sharp stick,

1760
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:41,340
you know,
and so this guy is using this like this 

1761
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:41,920
common thing that you see like these 
girls do,

1762
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,780
and then I was like,
there's got to be a better way.

1763
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:48,930
A little app,
but I'm not bouncing around the screen 

1764
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:48,930
that was in this corner.
Then I wasn't doing that.

1765
01:22:48,930 --> 01:22:50,890
He was standing right in front of the 
fast cuts.

1766
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:54,700
Like there was no pauses and it was 
disconcerting.

1767
01:22:54,701 --> 01:22:59,701
It's like throws you off.
That is the opposite of authentic 

1768
01:22:59,701 --> 01:23:02,110
because you know that there's all these 
edits and those edits take you out.

1769
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:07,320
Also,
those edits treat you like you're a 

1770
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:07,390
like,
you're so fucking stupid.

1771
01:23:07,391 --> 01:23:12,010
You can't even listen to a guy talk.
Here's your attention span is so short.

1772
01:23:12,250 --> 01:23:17,250
I can't listen to louis open this vr box
and go to this thing in real time and 

1773
01:23:18,491 --> 01:23:20,170
inspect the overall.

1774
01:23:21,410 --> 01:23:23,000
To be quite honest with you,
I'm kind of,

1775
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:28,030
you know,
you mean you have this platform here 

1776
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:28,820
where people sit down for hours,
you know,

1777
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:31,010
that's,
that's becoming not,

1778
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:36,050
you know,
that's not the status quo on the 

1779
01:23:36,050 --> 01:23:37,841
internet.
The internet keeps chopping it in the 

1780
01:23:37,841 --> 01:23:38,150
other direction.
Getting shorter and shorter conversation

1781
01:23:38,151 --> 01:23:40,970
has to move faster.
You got to jump to the bowhunting guys.

1782
01:23:40,971 --> 01:23:45,971
Got to jump around the screen and so on.
And I mean if you get obsessed with the 

1783
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,990
analytics and stuff,
you can see like how,

1784
01:23:48,010 --> 01:23:51,230
how often an average person watches for 
and so on.

1785
01:23:51,231 --> 01:23:56,231
And there's no,
there's no denying the fact that 

1786
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:56,960
people's attention spans are shrinking,
but it's like,

1787
01:23:56,961 --> 01:24:01,961
do you want to contribute to that or do 
you think that there's enough people 

1788
01:24:01,961 --> 01:24:05,150
that are willing to accept the 
alternative because you know,

1789
01:24:05,151 --> 01:24:06,800
you've got.
You've got an example here,

1790
01:24:06,801 --> 01:24:08,870
which is unusual.
Why do you think,

1791
01:24:08,871 --> 01:24:13,871
what do you think happens here?
That people stick around for three 

1792
01:24:13,871 --> 01:24:13,871
hours?

1793
01:24:13,871 --> 01:24:15,240
I never thought about it.
That's what happeNs.

1794
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:17,550
I never thought about it.
I just said I like talking to people,

1795
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:19,590
so let's record it.
Right.

1796
01:24:19,591 --> 01:24:20,730
You know what I mean?
But man,

1797
01:24:20,731 --> 01:24:23,880
I took a lot of heat in the beginning.
You were telling me I had to edit it.

1798
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,110
Oh really?
People.

1799
01:24:25,230 --> 01:24:30,230
Oh my god.
It was like some of the earliest 

1800
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:30,230
comments were like,
why is it showed three hours long?

1801
01:24:30,230 --> 01:24:31,140
This is bullshit.
No one's going to listen to three hours.

1802
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:32,660
Like even my friends were telling me 
this like,

1803
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:33,390
dude,
you to edit it,

1804
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:34,320
make it an hour.
I go,

1805
01:24:34,321 --> 01:24:37,350
why go after an hour?
People just shut it off.

1806
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:40,260
If they don't want to watch more than an
hour or listen to it was listened back.

1807
01:24:40,261 --> 01:24:41,870
Then you don't want to listen to more 
than an hour.

1808
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,890
Just shut it off at an hour.
Who gets interesting?

1809
01:24:43,891 --> 01:24:45,750
Yeah,
but it was a who gives a fuck thing?

1810
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:47,160
Like,
I'm going to do what I want to do.

1811
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,640
I'm not trying to make money off this,
I'm not trying to do anything unusual.

1812
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:52,890
I just like having conversations with 
people,

1813
01:24:52,980 --> 01:24:57,980
so let's bring in someone interesting 
and let's talk because the art of 

1814
01:24:57,980 --> 01:25:02,481
conversation,
like just having a conversation for the 

1815
01:25:02,481 --> 01:25:05,241
purpose of having a conversation is lost
in a lot of venues because what you're 

1816
01:25:05,241 --> 01:25:06,450
gettIng instead is interviews.
You know,

1817
01:25:06,451 --> 01:25:08,670
like you and I are friends.
We've been friends for a couple of years

1818
01:25:08,671 --> 01:25:09,900
now.
When we sit down,

1819
01:25:09,901 --> 01:25:14,901
I'm super confident that we're just 
going to have fun and we're going to 

1820
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:14,901
talk and we're going to have a 
conversation.

1821
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:17,040
That's why this podcast,
I left my hoUse today and I was like,

1822
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,920
I'm going to go have fun with lewis.
We're going to have a good conversation.

1823
01:25:19,921 --> 01:25:22,230
It's going to be cool because that's 
what I want to hear.

1824
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:26,220
I want to hear people having a 
conversation and so for me it was just a

1825
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:27,030
matter of,
well,

1826
01:25:27,031 --> 01:25:32,031
I'm going to have this conversation.
It gives me an opportunity to sit down 

1827
01:25:32,031 --> 01:25:32,330
with someone for three hours,
which is super rare in this world when.

1828
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:37,380
Sure.
When do you ever get a chance to put 

1829
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:39,351
your phone aside and just sit down?
We'll just look at a friend in the eyes 

1830
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:39,351
and just talk about it.

1831
01:25:39,351 --> 01:25:41,320
I've before.
I mean when I was,

1832
01:25:41,550 --> 01:25:46,550
you know,
I've been here for a couple of days and 

1833
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,550
know I'm telling people,
okay,

1834
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,550
you know,
you know,

1835
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:46,550
saturday I can't hang out,
whatever.

1836
01:25:46,550 --> 01:25:47,740
I'm gonna be on the podcast.
And they're like,

1837
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:51,520
what do you guys do to prepare for that 
and on your podcast?

1838
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:52,030
I'm like,
no,

1839
01:25:52,031 --> 01:25:57,031
nothing.
Like you actually just sit down and you 

1840
01:25:57,031 --> 01:25:58,330
just start talking and they're like,
how long for three hours.

1841
01:25:58,780 --> 01:25:59,590
No,
come on.

1842
01:25:59,650 --> 01:26:04,650
How do you do it?
You don't like this some kind of magic 

1843
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:06,931
to it when it's,
when as you said it is the simplest 

1844
01:26:06,931 --> 01:26:06,931
thing.
It's like it's like,

1845
01:26:06,931 --> 01:26:08,400
or it's maybe it's a forgotten thing of 
just being able to

1846
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:13,530
do this well if you actually are 
interested in life and you find another 

1847
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:13,900
person who is actually interested in 
libraries,

1848
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:16,450
I think the hard part is ending it three
hours,

1849
01:26:17,080 --> 01:26:18,410
three hours.
We're talking.

1850
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,980
We haven't even talked about a million 
different things.

1851
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:23,770
I've been watching your videos.
I got a lot of fucking questions.

1852
01:26:23,771 --> 01:26:25,600
You know,
there's a lot going on in the world.

1853
01:26:25,690 --> 01:26:27,330
I mean,
there's so much to talk about.

1854
01:26:27,340 --> 01:26:29,410
I just,
I don't understand people who don't have

1855
01:26:29,411 --> 01:26:31,990
anything to say that.
That to me is perplexing.

1856
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:37,410
When someone says,
how can you find things to talk about 

1857
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:37,410
for three hours?
Like how do you not talk?

1858
01:26:37,570 --> 01:26:37,970
Yeah.

1859
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:41,140
Well in that sense,
I think that this kind of like a,

1860
01:26:41,640 --> 01:26:44,930
a service being like it's surprising to 
me how many.

1861
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,250
Like when I'm saying,
okay,

1862
01:26:46,251 --> 01:26:48,190
I'm going to be on here and I put it on 
my twitter or whatever,

1863
01:26:48,191 --> 01:26:49,850
like how many people are pumped about 
it,

1864
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:50,960
pumped.
Like,

1865
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,630
oh thank god we're amazing.
Right?

1866
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:56,630
Like they love the idea of it.
For me,

1867
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,660
it's a departure from the way I normally
communicate with them.

1868
01:26:59,950 --> 01:27:02,150
Right.
For you it's the standard,

1869
01:27:02,151 --> 01:27:04,310
so I think you're really aware of it.
It gets,

1870
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:09,340
it gets personal in a different way when
you're using this medium where there 

1871
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:11,580
aren't these definitive parameters that 
exist in your,

1872
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:16,610
your typical youtube video,
your typical sweet or vine or whatever 

1873
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:17,330
it is.
Like those ones are all,

1874
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:19,720
so it's almost like every social media 
is,

1875
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:23,720
it has it's kind of structure that it 
landed on for the standard,

1876
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,160
the status quo,
but you,

1877
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:30,370
you've been doing this for a while now 
and you've been on many different 

1878
01:27:30,370 --> 01:27:33,581
platforms and you just kept in here the 
same essentially like as far as the 

1879
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:34,460
format is concerned.

1880
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:37,340
But I think there is something to be 
said for.

1881
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:41,810
I think what ends up happening,
we end giving people that access is that

1882
01:27:41,811 --> 01:27:43,520
it means more to them like they,
they,

1883
01:27:43,650 --> 01:27:48,650
that you simply can't get to know 
somebody in a three minute segment that 

1884
01:27:48,650 --> 01:27:49,220
you can in three hours.
It'S impossible.

1885
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,100
So what would they actually end up 
getting here is,

1886
01:27:52,101 --> 01:27:57,101
uh,
is something that matters substantially 

1887
01:27:57,101 --> 01:27:59,891
more to them.
Will they kind of get like digital 

1888
01:27:59,891 --> 01:27:59,891
friendships?
That's what I'm saying.

1889
01:27:59,891 --> 01:28:00,590
Yeah,
I think that's exactly.

1890
01:28:00,591 --> 01:28:02,340
I think how it's looked at and I think 
in,

1891
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:08,150
in a world where we,
we realized that there is an 

1892
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:11,050
increasingly short attention span.
You wonder how much of this kind of 

1893
01:28:12,081 --> 01:28:15,620
stuff here actually replaces the real 
world version of it.

1894
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:20,650
If,
if people can't be in a movie theater 

1895
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:22,601
without being on their phones,
if they can't drive without being on 

1896
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:22,601
their phones,
if this thing,

1897
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:25,730
if we are literally building new 
pathways in our heads for how we,

1898
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:30,940
how we look at spare time,
then is this thing in alternative to 

1899
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:31,540
that like,
is this,

1900
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,540
is this where people get it?

1901
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,970
Well,
you know what I think a lot of people do

1902
01:28:34,971 --> 01:28:37,310
with podcasts is one of the things that 
I do with podcasts,

1903
01:28:37,340 --> 01:28:39,730
it replaced radio in my car.
Oh,

1904
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,270
for me,
200 percent.

1905
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:43,580
When I drive around,
I don't listen to the radio anymore.

1906
01:28:43,581 --> 01:28:47,280
I listen to different podcasts and media
or radio lab,

1907
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,780
ted radio hour.
All my friends like joey diaz,

1908
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:55,781
his podcasts and ras and dunkin's.
I listened to all my friends podcasts 

1909
01:28:55,781 --> 01:28:57,710
and different people's podcasts.
I just think it's an amazing thing.

1910
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:01,710
I love the fact that at a red light you 
could just go to your thing,

1911
01:29:01,740 --> 01:29:02,100
press

1912
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:03,450
play,
find it.

1913
01:29:03,480 --> 01:29:05,190
Oh,
there's a new episode of this out.

1914
01:29:05,191 --> 01:29:06,330
Boom,
press play,

1915
01:29:06,331 --> 01:29:08,970
and it goes.
So it stimulates you.

1916
01:29:08,971 --> 01:29:13,971
When you're in your car.
it gives you interesting conversations 

1917
01:29:13,971 --> 01:29:16,851
when you're on a plane or when you're at
the gym and it replaces a lot of 

1918
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:20,670
traditional standard media in that way.
Also because there's no ads,

1919
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,760
there's ads in the beginning and if you 
want you fast forward through those 

1920
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,281
fuckers,
but the three hours of the podcast is 

1921
01:29:28,281 --> 01:29:28,740
totally uninterrupted.
That's unusual though.

1922
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:30,180
Well,
it's my choice.

1923
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:35,420
I was unwilling to do it any other way 
because I don't want it to be 

1924
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:35,420
interrupted.
They try to get you to change.

1925
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:35,940
Yeah,
they still do.

1926
01:29:36,120 --> 01:29:39,970
Really fuck you.
It's not available.

1927
01:29:39,971 --> 01:29:41,100
It's not.
I'm just not doing it.

1928
01:29:41,101 --> 01:29:43,140
They want me to interrupt the middle of 
the conversation and go,

1929
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:48,590
you know,
I don't know if you know about 

1930
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:50,001
squarespace lewis,
but squarespace is a platform against 

1931
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:50,001
squarespace.

1932
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,080
Squarespace.
They're awesome,

1933
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:53,250
but I.
It wasn't squarespace that was asking me

1934
01:29:53,251 --> 01:29:56,250
instead that the agents,
right sell these course,

1935
01:29:56,270 --> 01:29:59,190
they zero fucks about the content 
itself,

1936
01:29:59,191 --> 01:30:01,520
about the actual important part.
It's this.

1937
01:30:01,590 --> 01:30:03,090
There was another thing that I had to 
fight with.

1938
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:08,091
They were like,
there's no way you're going to get ads 

1939
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:08,091
unless they do it in the middle of the 
show.

1940
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:08,091
I go,
well then I'm not going to have.

1941
01:30:08,091 --> 01:30:12,451
That's like,
this is not like my primary source of 

1942
01:30:12,451 --> 01:30:13,830
income.
So for me thIs is a labor of love,

1943
01:30:13,860 --> 01:30:14,930
if you will.
I mean,

1944
01:30:15,320 --> 01:30:17,890
I want to do it correctly and making me 
feel special here,

1945
01:30:17,950 --> 01:30:19,800
what it is,
but I don't have anybody on that.

1946
01:30:19,801 --> 01:30:22,350
I don't want to have on.
There is no one that tells me what to do

1947
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:27,351
is know producer.
So if I have someone like you or 

1948
01:30:27,351 --> 01:30:29,961
anybody,
it's because I think it is going to be 

1949
01:30:29,961 --> 01:30:29,961
an interesting conversation.

1950
01:30:29,961 --> 01:30:29,961
I'm looking forward to having it.
That's it.

1951
01:30:29,961 --> 01:30:31,350
That's the agenda.
That's the whole thing.

1952
01:30:31,351 --> 01:30:32,660
So I'm not interrupting that.
yeah,

1953
01:30:32,830 --> 01:30:33,870
I don't,
I don't have any.

1954
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:36,120
I think it's a great message.
I gotta be honest with you.

1955
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:41,510
I don't think there's a lot of people 
out there pushing that particular 

1956
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:41,880
message in the space I'm in.
I think,

1957
01:30:41,881 --> 01:30:42,760
uh,
you know,

1958
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:45,390
especially since he's a particularly on 
the video side,

1959
01:30:45,391 --> 01:30:48,780
on the youtube site,
it's emerging as a real business,

1960
01:30:48,781 --> 01:30:49,870
real enterprise.
What'S.

1961
01:30:49,890 --> 01:30:52,740
Because there's so much money in it,
there's so much money in it.

1962
01:30:52,860 --> 01:30:53,930
It's craziness.
Yeah,

1963
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:56,790
it's bonkers.
But at the same time,

1964
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:58,200
there's no rule book on it,
you know,

1965
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,510
there's no parameters.
There's nobody out there saying,

1966
01:31:00,511 --> 01:31:02,610
hey dude,
like you're taking a risk on that one.

1967
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,130
Here's what's going to happen in 
[inaudible].

1968
01:31:04,131 --> 01:31:05,690
I seen it because I've been there.
And like,

1969
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:10,700
um,
I think to hear somebody like you who's 

1970
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:10,920
had success in this space to say,
hey,

1971
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:12,310
fuck it,
I don't compromise.

1972
01:31:12,540 --> 01:31:17,540
I'm going to do it this way.
Even when a million people are telling 

1973
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:17,540
me to do it.
Otherwise,

1974
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:19,930
I think for a lot of people starting out
that might have a youtube channel,

1975
01:31:19,931 --> 01:31:21,580
they might whatever,
to,

1976
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:22,300
to,
to,

1977
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:25,230
to be empowered by knowing that like,
you can do it.

1978
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:28,890
I got steve rinella to do it.
The mediator podcasts,

1979
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,550
I don't interrupt the podcast anymore.
Oh,

1980
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:32,010
he used to.
They used to interrupt it.

1981
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,170
Like if you listen to the dan flores 
episode,

1982
01:31:34,171 --> 01:31:36,450
there's no interruptions and that's what
makes it good.

1983
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:39,120
Here's my ethic.
Number one,

1984
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:41,310
don't do anything.
Or do you do your best?

1985
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:43,140
Obviously.
Do your best to make it entertaining.

1986
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:48,380
Don't do anything that would compromise 
the quality of it just for profit and as

1987
01:31:48,690 --> 01:31:50,370
long as you just do that,
do your best.

1988
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:55,580
Don't completely honest here.
Like I fucked up on number of occasions 

1989
01:31:55,620 --> 01:31:56,350
like in,
in,

1990
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,710
in,
in completing what you just said.

1991
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,010
There are times

1992
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:05,010
where I get too deep,
too deep and then I'm in it and I'm 

1993
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,010
like,
holy fuck,

1994
01:32:05,010 --> 01:32:05,770
this is a.
This is a nightmare.

1995
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:06,760
Like how so?
Well,

1996
01:32:06,761 --> 01:32:11,761
I mean with,
with a brand or a sponsorship or 

1997
01:32:11,761 --> 01:32:11,761
something like that where where it'll be
like,

1998
01:32:12,430 --> 01:32:14,950
I'll know it's a nightmare once I'm in 
it,

1999
01:32:15,040 --> 01:32:17,380
but even though I've been sold a bill of
goods,

2000
01:32:17,381 --> 01:32:19,240
that isn't the thing that I actually 
signed up for.

2001
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:24,960
It happens frequently with mean I'm 
dealing with the biggest brands on the 

2002
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,810
planet and they're like,
yeah,

2003
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:27,970
it's going to be completely 
conversational.

2004
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,490
You're jusT going to discover the god 
damn thing or whatever.

2005
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:32,690
And then you get there and it's like,
here's your script.

2006
01:32:32,691 --> 01:32:33,910
And I was like,
what the fuck?

2007
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Oh,
so you like for a certain product they 

2008
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:40,870
actually do if you're there for a launch
or something to give you scripts.

2009
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:42,760
No big.
I don't read a script.

2010
01:32:42,761 --> 01:32:44,860
I never read a goddamn split.
They tried to.

2011
01:32:44,890 --> 01:32:46,060
Exactly.
whoa.

2012
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:47,680
And what does that conversation like 
when you tell them?

2013
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:52,681
No,
it's like a bunch of producers 

2014
01:32:52,681 --> 01:32:53,860
pretending that it's impossible for me 
to say that.

2015
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:54,820
Oh,
how about this?

2016
01:32:54,821 --> 01:32:58,340
How about them trying to change your 
wardrobe to try to change your wardrobe?

2017
01:32:58,370 --> 01:32:58,900
I'm like,
dude,

2018
01:32:58,901 --> 01:33:01,660
I've been in his hoodie forever.
I got the hat on,

2019
01:33:01,690 --> 01:33:03,390
like people know how I look.
Right.

2020
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:08,020
It's this weird situation of like 
advertisers and the business side of the

2021
01:33:08,021 --> 01:33:13,021
thing not being used to.
The idea of people have of basically 

2022
01:33:14,471 --> 01:33:16,720
disrespecting the audience is what it 
is.

2023
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:20,200
Because you're going to come at it from,
from a respect point of view.

2024
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:22,060
I'm going to come at it from a 
respectful point of view,

2025
01:33:22,061 --> 01:33:25,060
but they're used to like inserting 
things that nobody wants.

2026
01:33:25,240 --> 01:33:28,940
So they automatically assume if they're 
working with you that they got to that,

2027
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:34,140
that nobody wants what you're talking 
about in reference to that project or 

2028
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:35,140
whatever.
So they come at it from a negative,

2029
01:33:35,141 --> 01:33:37,540
from a guilty point of view as opposed 
to like,

2030
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:39,100
hey,
people like this guy,

2031
01:33:39,101 --> 01:33:41,320
the way he is like,
leave him alone,

2032
01:33:41,730 --> 01:33:43,300
you know,
that's what they signed up for.

2033
01:33:43,301 --> 01:33:45,580
Why are we trying to rewrite it?
Because they want to in the soup.

2034
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:50,640
That's what it is,
is like if you're going to have that 

2035
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:52,890
environment,
if you're going to have this situation 

2036
01:33:52,890 --> 01:33:53,650
where there's like 50 or 100 people to 
get this piece of content,

2037
01:33:53,651 --> 01:33:57,270
everybody in there needs to carve out 
that.

2038
01:33:57,490 --> 01:34:00,970
That grew for themselves,
a place to fit well and they look,

2039
01:34:00,971 --> 01:34:04,960
they look for some way that they can 
tell everybody.

2040
01:34:04,961 --> 01:34:07,210
Like lewis was going to wear that hat.
Yes.

2041
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:08,320
And I told him,
look,

2042
01:34:08,321 --> 01:34:09,820
yes,
see this,

2043
01:34:09,821 --> 01:34:11,800
I feel like you must have encountered.
Oh yeah,

2044
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:12,400
for sure.
Yeah.

2045
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:13,750
And how do you deal with it?

2046
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:18,840
well,
luckily in the podcast I really didn't 

2047
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:21,301
encounter that much.
Countered it outside of the podcast and 

2048
01:34:21,301 --> 01:34:22,000
it's one of the reasons like doing fear 
factor was a big one.

2049
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,100
Like sometimes I would show up with 
stubble and they'd be like,

2050
01:34:24,101 --> 01:34:25,000
you got to shave.
I go,

2051
01:34:25,001 --> 01:34:27,500
why?
Why do I have to shave somebody's gonna,

2052
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,100
wash your show and go,
this motherfucker didn't shave today.

2053
01:34:30,101 --> 01:34:31,420
I'm changing the channel.
Mike,

2054
01:34:31,421 --> 01:34:33,310
stop,
stop,

2055
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:35,070
and we would have these arguments,
right?

2056
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:37,430
I'd have some stubble on my face and 
they would tell me,

2057
01:34:37,560 --> 01:34:38,620
you could really got to shave.
I'm like,

2058
01:34:38,800 --> 01:34:41,590
you can't tell me how to look.
This is what I am.

2059
01:34:41,591 --> 01:34:46,591
Don't look ridiculous.
I don't have a fucking big dildo poking 

2060
01:34:46,591 --> 01:34:46,720
out of my forehead.
Like there's.

2061
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:48,520
There's nothing unusual about how I 
look.

2062
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:50,080
You don't.
You don't get that right.

2063
01:34:50,081 --> 01:34:51,550
It's really fucked up when you think 
about it.

2064
01:34:51,670 --> 01:34:54,550
Imagine right now if you and I were 
wearing makeup,

2065
01:34:55,150 --> 01:34:57,010
looking at each other like powder and 
shit,

2066
01:34:57,030 --> 01:35:02,030
like regulars awake.
Make regular guys having a conversation 

2067
01:35:02,030 --> 01:35:03,190
in makeup.
That's so fucked up to think about.

2068
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:04,070
Well,
let me tell you something.

2069
01:35:04,071 --> 01:35:06,650
There are podcasts where they put makeup
on the podcast.

2070
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:11,800
That's a fact.
I've seen a lady standing there and 

2071
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:12,530
she'll powder your forehead.
I know she'll.

2072
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:14,960
She'll just go,
I'm going to put some anti shine on your

2073
01:35:14,961 --> 01:35:15,690
nose.
How?

2074
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:20,700
How pissed off must make people in in 
the makeup hollywood makeup business be 

2075
01:35:20,701 --> 01:35:23,960
at like youtube and online media as a 
numbers.

2076
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:25,640
When they get the numbers and they 
realize it's not.

2077
01:35:25,730 --> 01:35:28,040
You don't really have to make someone 
that put a cartoon.

2078
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:29,600
Yeah.
In fact,

2079
01:35:29,660 --> 01:35:34,660
you could make the argument that if our 
goal is to connect with people on the 

2080
01:35:34,660 --> 01:35:37,871
other end form these relationships,
better to look to just in every way to 

2081
01:35:38,421 --> 01:35:43,421
be as close as you can to the real you,
because that's how you form 

2082
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:43,421
relationships in real life.

2083
01:35:43,421 --> 01:35:47,620
Unless you're never going to see people 
in real life unless you're like one of 

2084
01:35:47,620 --> 01:35:48,890
those instagram girls just it puts 
filters on and it takes pictures.

2085
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:50,480
Oversight.
I know a dude who does that.

2086
01:35:50,481 --> 01:35:55,481
I know a comedian dude who does that 
filters on his fucking pictures and you 

2087
01:35:55,481 --> 01:35:55,980
look at them and you go,
whoa,

2088
01:35:55,990 --> 01:35:56,900
whoa,
whoa.

2089
01:35:56,930 --> 01:35:58,910
What's going on with your face?
You're a cartoon.

2090
01:35:58,980 --> 01:35:59,780
Yeah.
Yeah.

2091
01:35:59,781 --> 01:36:01,130
You know what that is?
That's the,

2092
01:36:01,131 --> 01:36:03,020
uh,
that's the beauty mode,

2093
01:36:03,510 --> 01:36:07,730
but it's on,
it's on a lot of korean devices,

2094
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,190
korean devices specifically.
Really.

2095
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:13,280
I like samsung type things,
samsung type things,

2096
01:36:13,340 --> 01:36:17,000
lg type things.
They have a beauty mode while you know,

2097
01:36:17,090 --> 01:36:20,040
you know what the situation now over 
their vision,

2098
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:25,610
regardless,
they do have a situation when it comes 

2099
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:25,610
to plastic surgery that's streamline.
Yap.

2100
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:26,810
So that's where I'm going with it.
I'm very bizarre.

2101
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,220
It's a.

2102
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:31,610
It makes.
So this beauty mode,

2103
01:36:31,670 --> 01:36:34,520
it makes your eyes bigger,
smooth into your skin.

2104
01:36:35,240 --> 01:36:38,840
It changes the color.
The complexion can lighten it up.

2105
01:36:38,841 --> 01:36:43,841
It's very bizarre.
Is it only work on lg and samsung ships 

2106
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:47,981
from.
I'm sure you could get an app on any 

2107
01:36:47,981 --> 01:36:47,981
phone,
but if you get like a korean model,

2108
01:36:47,981 --> 01:36:49,490
a korean version of pretty much any 
flagship,

2109
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:51,680
it's gonna.
That's the default camera app is gonna.

2110
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:54,680
It actually is going to have beauty mode
on by by default.

2111
01:36:54,710 --> 01:36:55,550
What?
Yeah,

2112
01:36:55,551 --> 01:36:57,050
it's going to be like default.
Yeah.

2113
01:36:57,051 --> 01:37:00,470
You're going to be like at like level 
five out of 10 potential beauty mode,

2114
01:37:00,471 --> 01:37:05,471
but you know,
you see these selfies or whatever it 

2115
01:37:05,471 --> 01:37:05,471
looks like the person is painted.
You've seen them.

2116
01:37:05,471 --> 01:37:06,190
I'm sure it's,
uh,

2117
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:11,480
I,
there was one famous situation where 

2118
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:12,140
that chef.
Who's the chef,

2119
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:13,490
mario batali.
No,

2120
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:14,570
the one who's always yelling.

2121
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:16,640
Mr.
No,

2122
01:37:16,710 --> 01:37:17,230
no,
no,

2123
01:37:17,450 --> 01:37:19,080
no.
The one who's yelling at people like,

2124
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,310
get out of my kitchen,
gordon ramsay,

2125
01:37:21,980 --> 01:37:26,150
gordon ramsay.
And the mom of the kardashians.

2126
01:37:26,330 --> 01:37:27,260
Oh,
jesus.

2127
01:37:27,320 --> 01:37:31,400
What a combo.
So she took the photo filter out.

2128
01:37:31,430 --> 01:37:33,440
They each took their own.
And one of them,

2129
01:37:34,900 --> 01:37:37,370
somebody did like a comparison.
Oh,

2130
01:37:37,371 --> 01:37:39,680
that's right.
Because she of course had a filter on.

2131
01:37:39,860 --> 01:37:42,230
Oh,
being time made her look like an angel.

2132
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:43,490
Big time.
So yeah.

2133
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,190
It's a good point though.
It's like,

2134
01:37:45,200 --> 01:37:50,200
what?
As we continue to progress into this 

2135
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,170
digital realm,
which one is the real you?

2136
01:37:51,220 --> 01:37:56,220
What?
We're hiding that we're hiding that 

2137
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,220
reality with these filters.
And I.

2138
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,220
That's okay.

2139
01:37:56,220 --> 01:37:56,870
There you go.
Okay.

2140
01:37:56,880 --> 01:37:59,940
There's her look at her face.
Look at his.

2141
01:38:01,830 --> 01:38:03,540
Okay.
That is so bizarre.

2142
01:38:03,541 --> 01:38:06,240
There's the reality.
Oh jesus christ.

2143
01:38:07,230 --> 01:38:08,820
Wow.
What a difference.

2144
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,250
Wow.
She's like in a fog.

2145
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:16,360
They're repeat.
That mode of photographing people is so 

2146
01:38:16,441 --> 01:38:17,570
creepy.
But I,

2147
01:38:17,610 --> 01:38:19,260
like I said,
I know a male comedian.

2148
01:38:19,261 --> 01:38:20,540
he used that.
Well,

2149
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,740
I don't know man.
It'S all of it is weird.

2150
01:38:22,741 --> 01:38:27,540
Like I need to kind of in your head,
he needs to set up some rules.

2151
01:38:27,541 --> 01:38:29,310
That's what I want to do.
We need the rule book.

2152
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:33,180
We need the social media rule book.
You definitely do.

2153
01:38:33,370 --> 01:38:35,050
You kind of have it,
you know,

2154
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:40,060
we,
we kind of have it in a way where a 

2155
01:38:40,060 --> 01:38:41,360
personal qri there's a clear rule book.
We look at that one outta here,

2156
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:43,800
but it's unwritten.
It is undermining to write it down.

2157
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,480
Why,
you know,

2158
01:38:45,481 --> 01:38:47,580
and I know everybody knows that's true.

2159
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,350
It is kind of,
it is kind of fun that way,

2160
01:38:49,410 --> 01:38:53,580
but I feel like we could,
maybe we could maybe save the situation.

2161
01:38:53,581 --> 01:38:55,890
We can saying no,
you don't want to save it.

2162
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,410
You want to leave them to be able to 
still do that.

2163
01:38:58,411 --> 01:38:58,940
Yeah,
it's true.

2164
01:38:58,941 --> 01:39:00,690
Do you want people to look like a 
fucking cartoon?

2165
01:39:00,691 --> 01:39:01,350
Okay.
Okay.

2166
01:39:01,351 --> 01:39:02,220
Joe,
how many,

2167
01:39:02,910 --> 01:39:07,910
how many times can you,
how many times do you take a selfie 

2168
01:39:07,910 --> 01:39:10,200
before you post it?
Um,

2169
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:13,900
what's your maximum?
But not that many men come joke.

2170
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:15,060
It was.
The truth is,

2171
01:39:15,061 --> 01:39:17,490
and I'm a 48 year old guy who's not that
good.

2172
01:39:17,491 --> 01:39:22,491
Look,
there's not a whole lot I'm doing to 

2173
01:39:22,491 --> 01:39:24,591
make it look any better.
I might look for the best like smile or 

2174
01:39:24,591 --> 01:39:26,340
like this one,
this one looks best,

2175
01:39:26,341 --> 01:39:27,750
taken a few,
but it's me.

2176
01:39:27,990 --> 01:39:32,990
Every one of them has this weird filter.
Are we capping it at some point?

2177
01:39:33,121 --> 01:39:33,330
Like,
oh,

2178
01:39:33,331 --> 01:39:34,590
you're going like fuck,
I just took it.

2179
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:39,600
Someone you're trying to do,
like maybe trying to get everything in 

2180
01:39:39,600 --> 01:39:41,691
the background.
It's really dependent upon what you're 

2181
01:39:41,691 --> 01:39:42,330
trying to do,
but it's never more than like a couple.

2182
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:47,430
You ever gone over 10?
I don't believe so unless I was trying 

2183
01:39:47,430 --> 01:39:47,910
to achieve something very strange.

2184
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:53,010
I love how everybody's like a fine art 
photographer.

2185
01:39:53,011 --> 01:39:54,720
Now that we have phones.
I mean,

2186
01:39:54,721 --> 01:39:57,150
what else would I.
How would I ever get to 10?

2187
01:39:57,151 --> 01:39:58,140
I don't.
I don't know.

2188
01:39:58,141 --> 01:39:58,620
I don't know.
I,

2189
01:39:59,660 --> 01:40:01,920
I'm kind of joking around to be quite 
honest,

2190
01:40:01,921 --> 01:40:05,550
but like I catch myself sometimes like 
what the fuck am I doing?

2191
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:10,190
I'm a grown ass man in this place here.
Like what am I taking,

2192
01:40:11,330 --> 01:40:13,050
you know,
I kind of um,

2193
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:18,080
do you do duck lips ass out the arch?
I might break the internet.

2194
01:40:19,090 --> 01:40:24,090
Joe pussy out arch.
it's a but then and then I think about 

2195
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:24,090
it.
I think put okay.

2196
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:27,930
If I catch myself fairly confident guy,
you know,

2197
01:40:27,931 --> 01:40:32,931
I'm happy with myself to a certain 
degree if I catch myself at 10 or 

2198
01:40:32,931 --> 01:40:37,191
whatever the number is.
How many goddamn photos are these 

2199
01:40:37,231 --> 01:40:42,231
professional instagram girls taking 
before they pick one to post the very 

2200
01:40:42,231 --> 01:40:42,480
good point.
Could it be 100?

2201
01:40:42,990 --> 01:40:47,990
Some of them it's probably shocking 
numbers and then some of them what's 

2202
01:40:47,990 --> 01:40:51,231
really weird because they're taking 
these really like supposedly clandestine

2203
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,950
stein photos.
But like who's taken the photo?

2204
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:56,800
Like why do you,
why you like looking off in the distance

2205
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:58,480
whimsically like,
no one's around.

2206
01:40:58,840 --> 01:41:00,520
It's a fucking guy right there with the 
camera.

2207
01:41:00,521 --> 01:41:03,190
You lying bitch,
what are we doing here?

2208
01:41:03,191 --> 01:41:06,910
What are we selling?
In the early days of instagram,

2209
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,630
one of the unwritten rules was only 
phone photos,

2210
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:14,140
like if it's,
if it didn't come off your phone,

2211
01:41:14,141 --> 01:41:15,760
you just broke the rules of instagram.
Oh,

2212
01:41:15,761 --> 01:41:17,650
I didn't know there was a rule.
It's again,

2213
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:19,690
if I had joe,
if I had the book,

2214
01:41:19,990 --> 01:41:22,910
you would know it.
It'll be on amazon.com.

2215
01:41:23,570 --> 01:41:24,850
There'll be kickstarting it.
Actually,

2216
01:41:24,851 --> 01:41:28,930
that's crazy because that guy that sent 
me these wolf put pictures.

2217
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:30,780
Yeah.
It should pull up his,

2218
01:41:30,781 --> 01:41:31,810
uh,
his instagram.

2219
01:41:31,811 --> 01:41:32,930
So we could give this guy some.
No,

2220
01:41:32,931 --> 01:41:33,160
no,
no.

2221
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:33,760
See.
See,

2222
01:41:33,761 --> 01:41:38,761
in his particular case,
those obviously aren't phone photos and 

2223
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:38,761
he and he has broken the rules.

2224
01:41:38,761 --> 01:41:43,140
But that rule went away a long time ago.
Everybody did go because photos from 

2225
01:41:43,211 --> 01:41:45,190
real cameras look amazing.
Yeah.

2226
01:41:45,191 --> 01:41:46,240
But this.
Okay.

2227
01:41:46,241 --> 01:41:47,800
That's okay.
I see what your point is.

2228
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:48,480
Yeah.
Yeah.

2229
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:53,550
But why?
Why would there be only photos from 

2230
01:41:53,550 --> 01:41:53,680
that?
Because it's kind of like cheating,

2231
01:41:53,681 --> 01:41:55,750
like insta,
instagram.

2232
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,820
It should be like in the moment.
Okay.

2233
01:41:57,821 --> 01:41:58,490
Okay.
And,

2234
01:41:58,491 --> 01:42:03,491
and what you just described,
like this model overlooking cabo or 

2235
01:42:03,641 --> 01:42:05,560
whatever it is,
that's not instagram.

2236
01:42:05,561 --> 01:42:06,400
I mean,
it is,

2237
01:42:06,401 --> 01:42:11,401
it is now,
but in the early days it sure as hell 

2238
01:42:11,401 --> 01:42:13,451
wasn't so.
Did people get upset when they saw like 

2239
01:42:13,451 --> 01:42:13,680
a professional photography in days?
Yeah,

2240
01:42:13,790 --> 01:42:14,710
yeah,
for sure.

2241
01:42:14,711 --> 01:42:15,280
They,
they would,

2242
01:42:15,281 --> 01:42:17,830
uh,
amongst some of the tight knit groups on

2243
01:42:17,831 --> 01:42:18,850
there,
some of the bigger,

2244
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:23,200
a photo pages that emerged.
It was kind of like,

2245
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:24,280
it was kinda like,
hey,

2246
01:42:24,281 --> 01:42:29,281
I had to,
I built this business on the back of a 

2247
01:42:29,281 --> 01:42:32,161
stupid cell phone camera and then some 
person comes in with all these heavy 

2248
01:42:32,161 --> 01:42:35,500
duty equipment and kind of interrupts it
and I don't know how much of it was just

2249
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:38,410
them being competitive and how much of 
it was them thinking,

2250
01:42:38,470 --> 01:42:43,470
believing in the ethic of,
of it being instant friend meg has an 

2251
01:42:43,470 --> 01:42:45,450
instagram page where it's all just 
polaroids.

2252
01:42:46,610 --> 01:42:49,750
A photo of polaroid photo of a polaroid.
It's kind of cool.

2253
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:50,770
Yeah.
That's all she does.

2254
01:42:50,780 --> 01:42:52,450
Just take.
Or maybe she scans them.

2255
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:54,640
I don't know if she scans them for the 
record.

2256
01:42:54,641 --> 01:42:59,641
I'm not like,
I'm not of the opinion is the cjm 

2257
01:42:59,641 --> 01:43:01,090
underscore photographer.
His name is chris Montana and uh,

2258
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:03,820
he,
he sent us these photos of this,

2259
01:43:03,821 --> 01:43:04,690
uh,
these wolves.

2260
01:43:04,710 --> 01:43:07,090
See that wolf down there?
That's one of the ones that he sent us.

2261
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:10,000
I mean,
that is a fucking amazing photograph.

2262
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:11,530
Looking right at number wolf.
Yeah.

2263
01:43:11,940 --> 01:43:13,430
Yeah.
He uh.

2264
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:14,220
Oh.
It says he did.

2265
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,470
He got it.
He's got a promo code right now.

2266
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:18,160
Promo code rogan.
Um,

2267
01:43:18,161 --> 01:43:23,161
so if you go to chris Montana,
m o n t a n o j.r.com.

2268
01:43:24,821 --> 01:43:26,950
Chris Montana jr.
Com.

2269
01:43:27,430 --> 01:43:32,430
And use the promo code rogan.
You get 20 percent off your entire 

2270
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:33,070
purchase.
I guess he has these prints for sale,

2271
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:35,080
but let me pull it up so people could 
see it here.

2272
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,890
yeah,
that's amazing stuff.

2273
01:43:39,070 --> 01:43:44,070
I mean,
I think anytime you look at a 

2274
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,070
photograph,
photograph,

2275
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,070
when you go,
how did he get that shot?

2276
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:47,080
That's a good sign.
So we're going to put these on the wall.

2277
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:49,720
I'm getting tired of looking at elvis.
Wow.

2278
01:43:49,721 --> 01:43:52,000
I'm going to decorate the back wall.
The thing is,

2279
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:55,970
it's made out of metal on metal.
That's wild.

2280
01:43:57,920 --> 01:44:02,920
You know,
if I had one thing that I could look at 

2281
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:02,920
forever,
like if I had only one kind of art,

2282
01:44:02,920 --> 01:44:07,631
it would absolutely be wildlife art.
Like wildlife art to me is the most 

2283
01:44:07,631 --> 01:44:08,540
compelling.
It's just something about,

2284
01:44:08,541 --> 01:44:11,690
especially like predators,
like eagles and wolves.

2285
01:44:11,691 --> 01:44:16,691
Did you see that video was making the 
rounds of the eagle today?

2286
01:44:17,650 --> 01:44:19,580
The cat.
okay,

2287
01:44:19,581 --> 01:44:21,230
fine.
You can probably tweeted it then.

2288
01:44:21,610 --> 01:44:25,430
I did it.
It's funny when,

2289
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:27,470
when you come up,
when I come on here,

2290
01:44:27,471 --> 01:44:29,560
I'm like,
every time I'm referencing something I'm

2291
01:44:29,561 --> 01:44:34,561
like,
did was posted that or was it somebody 

2292
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:34,561
else?
But yeah,

2293
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:34,561
that's,
that's uh,

2294
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:36,880
it's weird how people have that kind of 
a,

2295
01:44:37,970 --> 01:44:42,970
how they have that perception of like 
nature only applies to stuff that I 

2296
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:44,860
don't recognize.
Exactly.

2297
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:46,310
Know what I mean?
Like you're not a part of it.

2298
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:51,430
It's like eating a salmon is fine,
but an eagle capturing a cat and feeding

2299
01:44:51,591 --> 01:44:54,650
it to his chicks [inaudible] not good.
And then he had to,

2300
01:44:54,740 --> 01:44:57,320
I guess I was reading through the 
article there and they had to say like,

2301
01:44:57,321 --> 01:45:02,321
oh,
the cat was probably already dead and 

2302
01:45:02,321 --> 01:45:02,321
bullshit.
Bullshit.

2303
01:45:02,321 --> 01:45:04,170
They fucking scoop up cats all the time 
or why not?

2304
01:45:04,190 --> 01:45:05,190
That's a lie.
Yeah.

2305
01:45:05,350 --> 01:45:06,740
Why not?
We're weird.

2306
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:11,600
We have a hierarchy of animals and 
things like cats and dogs.

2307
01:45:11,601 --> 01:45:16,601
Are they more favorable?
That's why that yulin dog festival in 

2308
01:45:16,601 --> 01:45:17,930
China is so problematic.
Dog eating.

2309
01:45:18,630 --> 01:45:19,650
Yeah.
Yeah.

2310
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:21,630
My brother ate dog.
Yeah,

2311
01:45:21,660 --> 01:45:22,010
he.
Well,

2312
01:45:22,011 --> 01:45:27,011
he was hit China here and there and he.
He said that there was one point where 

2313
01:45:27,011 --> 01:45:27,590
they were at a restaurant that all he 
had was dog,

2314
01:45:27,591 --> 01:45:30,860
so he was all they had.
It was a dog.

2315
01:45:31,120 --> 01:45:34,160
It was just dog restaurants like 
Kentucky fried chicken,

2316
01:45:34,161 --> 01:45:37,830
but dogs,
Kentucky fried dogs.

2317
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,810
But anyway,
I don't know.

2318
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:44,840
It just is problematic.
I think it comes back maybe full circle 

2319
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:48,101
to the whole.
The way that we started this 

2320
01:45:48,101 --> 01:45:48,101
conversation just about people,
whatever the convenient,

2321
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:49,910
didn't want to compartmentalize certain 
things.

2322
01:45:49,911 --> 01:45:52,790
Like that's the way that's going to be 
and it's not a.

2323
01:45:53,090 --> 01:45:58,090
Yeah,
well it's a similar thing to what the 

2324
01:45:58,090 --> 01:45:58,090
coyotes and me seeing a wolf here and 
he's like,

2325
01:45:58,090 --> 01:45:58,940
whoa.
Right.

2326
01:45:58,941 --> 01:46:01,040
You get this reset of like,
holy shit.

2327
01:46:01,100 --> 01:46:04,130
That's a natural.
It feels small and you can probably even

2328
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:09,131
more so because you go out,
you actually go out in the wilderness 

2329
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:09,131
and whatnot,
go hunting and whatnot.

2330
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:09,131
I mean,
could you.

2331
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:11,480
It's a humbling experience.
I assume it's very humbling.

2332
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:14,990
It's very psychedelic and people think 
that that sounds crazy like going out to

2333
01:46:14,991 --> 01:46:19,991
kill an animal psychedelic,
but what psychedelic about it is its 

2334
01:46:19,991 --> 01:46:24,131
boundary dissolving and that you enter 
into a truly wild world and there was 

2335
01:46:24,131 --> 01:46:28,481
these large animals that live in this 
wild world and you feel their world.

2336
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:34,600
There's no cell phone servIce out there.
You're in the woods with the trees and 

2337
01:46:34,600 --> 01:46:39,101
the animals and you're a part of this 
natural environment for a very brief 

2338
01:46:39,101 --> 01:46:39,860
time and you know people like,
well,

2339
01:46:39,861 --> 01:46:41,870
what would you want to go there and kill
those animals in this?

2340
01:46:42,110 --> 01:46:47,110
There's all these weird arguments that 
you could have back and forth about 

2341
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:50,141
this.
These conversations you can have about 

2342
01:46:50,141 --> 01:46:50,141
whether or not it's okay to kill these 
animals.

2343
01:46:50,141 --> 01:46:50,141
What

2344
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:55,730
I've.
I've made these conversations with 

2345
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:55,730
myself,
believe me,

2346
01:46:55,730 --> 01:46:55,730
like before I started hunting for the 
first time,

2347
01:46:55,770 --> 01:47:00,770
my thought was I am either going to go 
hunting and I'm going to never eat meat 

2348
01:47:01,111 --> 01:47:06,111
again.
I'm going to become vegan or I'm going 

2349
01:47:06,111 --> 01:47:07,941
to be a hunter,
and I decided to be a hunter and one of 

2350
01:47:07,941 --> 01:47:10,371
the reasons why I decided to be a hunter
is I realized I don't like factory 

2351
01:47:10,371 --> 01:47:10,371
farming.
I think it's fucked up.

2352
01:47:10,371 --> 01:47:14,070
I think the way we get our food,
I think we've made a huge mistake.

2353
01:47:14,670 --> 01:47:19,670
It's a great decision,
but a huge mistake at the same time in 

2354
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:23,271
that we've all.
We've decided to live in these gigantic 

2355
01:47:23,271 --> 01:47:27,950
urban areas in these urban areas that 
becomes our natural world and in that 

2356
01:47:27,950 --> 01:47:28,920
natural world,
we don't see tigers.

2357
01:47:28,921 --> 01:47:30,930
We don't see wolves,
we don't see bears.

2358
01:47:30,931 --> 01:47:32,400
We don't see these animals.

2359
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:36,120
So our association with these animals is
very unnatural.

2360
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:40,410
Our world consists of streets and cars 
and buildings and elevators,

2361
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,560
and that's our natural world.
That's the natural world that we live 

2362
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,610
in.
When you go out into the woods and you,

2363
01:47:47,690 --> 01:47:52,680
you see the actual natural world,
the tooth thing and claw natural world,

2364
01:47:52,890 --> 01:47:57,890
and you find mountain lions shit that 
has hair in it and you look around and 

2365
01:47:57,890 --> 01:48:00,150
you know,
you see an elk at the top of a ridge and

2366
01:48:00,151 --> 01:48:00,950
he's,
you know,

2367
01:48:01,050 --> 01:48:05,340
trying to fuck all these other cow elk 
and trying to fight all these bowls that

2368
01:48:05,341 --> 01:48:07,740
are coming in.
And I mean we last time was elk hunting.

2369
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
They had found a dead elk that had been 
killed by another elk is thousand pound 

2370
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,691
animal that died because this other 
animal with fucking a tree grown out of 

2371
01:48:17,731 --> 01:48:20,400
it's head spirited in the side and 
killed it.

2372
01:48:20,640 --> 01:48:25,640
I mean,
it's really wild to see like these 

2373
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:25,930
things kill each other so they can fuck.
And you're,

2374
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:29,140
you're out in that world.
And when,

2375
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:32,230
when you do it makes everything seem,
uh,

2376
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:32,960
the,
the,

2377
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:38,080
the whole predator prey experience seems
very intensified.

2378
01:48:38,161 --> 01:48:43,161
Like your,
your connection to your food is very 

2379
01:48:43,161 --> 01:48:43,360
intense.
It's the whole thing is like.

2380
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:47,780
And also from a wildlife management 
standpoint,

2381
01:48:48,240 --> 01:48:50,820
you kind of what we're talking about 
with lyme disease.

2382
01:48:50,970 --> 01:48:53,580
The reason why they have lyme disease,
because they have too many deer,

2383
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,470
they have too many deer,
they have these ticks,

2384
01:48:55,471 --> 01:48:58,530
these ticks get on these deer.
They developed this disease and this,

2385
01:48:58,590 --> 01:49:01,710
these ticks get onto people and it's 
because of an over abundance of dhea,

2386
01:49:01,750 --> 01:49:06,750
the overpopulation,
they can nip that shit in the bud if 

2387
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:08,040
they could figure out how to dwindle 
down the population of deer.

2388
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:11,610
When you have too many animals,
too many game animals,

2389
01:49:11,611 --> 01:49:13,530
too many,
too many wild animals,

2390
01:49:13,531 --> 01:49:15,360
and the balance gets over run.

2391
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:20,250
Whether it's too many wolves are too 
many bear or too many deer like wildlife

2392
01:49:20,251 --> 01:49:25,251
biologists understand what the correct 
numbers are better to keep that harmony 

2393
01:49:25,251 --> 01:49:27,570
and you have two options.
One option number one,

2394
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:29,280
hunters,
they pay money.

2395
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:34,520
They go out there and the money from 
those tags is responsible for the 

2396
01:49:34,520 --> 01:49:37,470
protection of these wildlife areas,
protection of habitat,

2397
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:40,260
or option number two,
they hire snipers.

2398
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:45,440
They hire people to go out there and 
kill these animals and that's what 

2399
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:45,440
they're doing in Zimbabwe.
With lions,

2400
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,340
they,
they're killing us.

2401
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:50,740
They're killing 200 lions rather this 
year because they have so many lions now

2402
01:49:50,741 --> 01:49:54,850
because of the the what happened with 
the dentist or the dentist went over and

2403
01:49:54,851 --> 01:49:55,480
shot.
Cecil.

2404
01:49:55,481 --> 01:49:57,400
The lion became this big thing.
Well,

2405
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:02,550
they had control of their population.
They had this sort of ecosystem balanced

2406
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:06,010
out and the hunter's got scared and 
hunter's got scared.

2407
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,780
They moved off.
They don't.

2408
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:12,810
They don't go there anymore,
and so now they have all these lines 

2409
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:12,810
that are destroying this undulate 
population,

2410
01:50:12,810 --> 01:50:17,430
so they made a wildlife biologist 
decision to go in there and killed 200 

2411
01:50:17,430 --> 01:50:20,170
lions to lessen the impact on the 
undulates.

2412
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:24,070
It's all in north America.
They do that with bears and they do that

2413
01:50:24,071 --> 01:50:29,071
with mountain lions in most states.
They figure out what is the healthy 

2414
01:50:29,071 --> 01:50:29,980
number or all these animals can coexist.

2415
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:30,600
Yeah,
well it's.

2416
01:50:30,770 --> 01:50:35,770
I mean it's one thing to have an opinion
on that matter and it's a different 

2417
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:38,600
thing to actually have exposure and then
maintain that opinion.

2418
01:50:38,890 --> 01:50:41,600
Know what I mean?
It's one thing to be on twitter,

2419
01:50:42,320 --> 01:50:47,320
sitting on your couch watching tv,
saying a couple words about how you 

2420
01:50:47,421 --> 01:50:50,240
think about the planet,
the wilderness and so on.

2421
01:50:50,530 --> 01:50:55,530
He say,
but to maintain that perspective when 

2422
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:55,530
you're actually in it.
Yeah,

2423
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:59,381
I would.
I would have to believe in speculate 

2424
01:50:59,381 --> 01:50:59,381
that that's a difficult thing to do.
Well,

2425
01:50:59,381 --> 01:51:03,611
there's a deep respect that comes in a 
deep love for an animal that is going to

2426
01:51:04,011 --> 01:51:06,140
sustain you and feed you,
and

2427
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,210
the thing about it is these animals,
they're not going to live forever if you

2428
01:51:10,211 --> 01:51:12,850
don't do that.
Their life is incredibly brutal,

2429
01:51:12,890 --> 01:51:15,580
incredibly short,
and what you're doing as a hunter,

2430
01:51:15,581 --> 01:51:20,581
as you're going into that world and 
you're dipping your toes into it for a 

2431
01:51:20,581 --> 01:51:23,311
brief amount of time a week or whatever 
it takes to find an animal and the 

2432
01:51:23,311 --> 01:51:26,770
animal's going to feed you for months.
And to me it's so much more.

2433
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:29,680
It's so much more ethical than buying it
from a store.

2434
01:51:29,681 --> 01:51:31,390
I mean that not even can't even be 
argued,

2435
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:34,870
but from a vegan perspective,
like they don't want anything to die.

2436
01:51:34,871 --> 01:51:39,871
They want everything to live forever,
but it doesn't work that way because 

2437
01:51:39,871 --> 01:51:39,871
first of all,
if you don't shoot animals,

2438
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:41,400
if you don't like,
if,

2439
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:46,440
if you don't control bear populations,
the berrigan and decimate the moose 

2440
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:49,861
population,
they're going to decimate the deer 

2441
01:51:49,861 --> 01:51:49,861
population.

2442
01:51:49,861 --> 01:51:49,861
They eat all the calves,
they eat all the fonz.

2443
01:51:49,861 --> 01:51:51,130
That's just what they do.
That's what they've always done.

2444
01:51:51,131 --> 01:51:52,060
Not only that,
they go in,

2445
01:51:52,061 --> 01:51:54,400
they eat each other.
Bears are all cannibals.

2446
01:51:54,760 --> 01:51:58,780
I mean there's a massive amount of 
cannibalism in in the bear world,

2447
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:03,900
the cubs.
It's one of the first things that males 

2448
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:06,211
do when they come out of hibernation,
and if you don't control their 

2449
01:52:06,211 --> 01:52:07,600
populations,
they will do that to every fucking thing

2450
01:52:07,601 --> 01:52:12,601
that's out in the woods and the only 
thing that can control their population 

2451
01:52:12,601 --> 01:52:16,141
is another predator and the only 
predator for bears is people sit and 

2452
01:52:16,141 --> 01:52:17,380
that the people will go.
What about people?

2453
01:52:17,381 --> 01:52:18,640
People who are over populated,
man,

2454
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:21,100
why don't you fucking shoot people,
but why don't you kill yourself?

2455
01:52:21,370 --> 01:52:23,020
How about I start with you?
Sounds about right.

2456
01:52:23,330 --> 01:52:26,150
You non human loving.
Fuck yeah.

2457
01:52:26,151 --> 01:52:30,870
I mean like life eats life and that is a
weird reality.

2458
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:35,040
There is a part of it though with the 
complicated part of it is that obviously

2459
01:52:35,130 --> 01:52:38,460
everybody can't do that.
Exactly.

2460
01:52:38,461 --> 01:52:39,330
I mean,
well that is true,

2461
01:52:39,331 --> 01:52:44,331
but that doesn't mean that everybody 
can't survive on the amount of money 

2462
01:52:44,911 --> 01:52:45,890
that you make every year.

2463
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:51,100
That doesn't mean you should give up 
that money because everybody can't make 

2464
01:52:51,100 --> 01:52:53,501
the amount of money that you make.
Are you singling me out here for 

2465
01:52:53,501 --> 01:52:53,501
anybody?
I mean,

2466
01:52:53,501 --> 01:52:55,130
look,
if you make more than $35,000

2467
01:52:55,131 --> 01:53:00,131
a year,
you're in the top one percent of the 

2468
01:53:00,131 --> 01:53:00,131
world.
We live in a very strange time.

2469
01:53:00,131 --> 01:53:00,580
I just mean like I think.
I think some people,

2470
01:53:00,910 --> 01:53:04,850
people's perspectives are formed by in 
some ways their capabilities.

2471
01:53:05,160 --> 01:53:08,450
If all they ever knew it was going to 
mcdonald's or whatever and it's just,

2472
01:53:08,451 --> 01:53:13,451
it's a hard thing to break.
It is a hard thing to break and it's a 

2473
01:53:13,451 --> 01:53:13,780
hard thing to recognize that it can't,
you know?

2474
01:53:13,781 --> 01:53:16,190
What will people say it's not 
sustainable for the entire population?

2475
01:53:16,191 --> 01:53:17,650
Well,
I'm not the entire population.

2476
01:53:17,700 --> 01:53:22,700
Not only that,
what we're doing is not sustainable for 

2477
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:22,700
the entire population of the world.
Actually,

2478
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:22,700
I don't know.

2479
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:24,410
I'm kind of optimistic about it.
I don't know if it's sustainable or not.

2480
01:53:24,411 --> 01:53:25,670
Sustainable.
Hunting's not.

2481
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:29,060
There's not enough animals.
There's just not gotten pharma.

2482
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:34,270
Yeah,
I mean if you wanted to eat the way 

2483
01:53:34,270 --> 01:53:36,671
people eat today,
there has to be some sort of farming 

2484
01:53:36,671 --> 01:53:36,671
going on.
If you want to eat it,

2485
01:53:36,671 --> 01:53:38,960
the amount of meat and people find that 
problematic and that's for good reason.

2486
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:41,420
There's a way to do the farming part 
better.

2487
01:53:41,900 --> 01:53:46,900
Maybe there's certainly as,
but there's also problems with just 

2488
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,050
eating vegetables just to your 
vegetables.

2489
01:53:48,051 --> 01:53:53,051
First of all,
to this place is massive amounts of 

2490
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:53,051
wildlife.
Second of all,

2491
01:53:53,051 --> 01:53:53,840
when you buy grain,
you're.

2492
01:53:53,841 --> 01:53:57,320
You are responsible indirectly for the 
death of thousands of animals.

2493
01:53:57,350 --> 01:54:02,350
There's just no way around it.
Those combines are indiscriminate and 

2494
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:02,350
they,
they,

2495
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:05,990
they grind up deer fawns and rabbits and
rats and mice and groundhogs and 

2496
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:06,380
everything else.

2497
01:54:06,590 --> 01:54:08,660
Then on top of that,
pesticides,

2498
01:54:09,010 --> 01:54:10,210
you know,
I mean if you,

2499
01:54:10,220 --> 01:54:13,610
unless you're buying absolute organic 
where there's no pesticides used,

2500
01:54:13,820 --> 01:54:18,440
your for sure going to be responsible 
for the death of millions of bucks.

2501
01:54:18,441 --> 01:54:20,180
If you live in a house,
you display.

2502
01:54:20,210 --> 01:54:25,210
You know what I mean?
Like everybody's fucking with animals 

2503
01:54:25,210 --> 01:54:27,580
and on top of that,
there's some very real and compelling 

2504
01:54:27,580 --> 01:54:29,660
evidence that plants have a level of 
intelligence.

2505
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:32,930
We don't want to think of them as 
sentience because they can't communicate

2506
01:54:32,931 --> 01:54:37,931
with us.
They don't say anything to us like out 

2507
01:54:37,931 --> 01:54:37,931
on chop me down.
It hurts,

2508
01:54:37,931 --> 01:54:40,840
but they communicate with each other.
There's something that plants do now.

2509
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:45,850
This is,
this is a crazy thing that they found 

2510
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:45,850
with giraffes,
that the plants that giraffes eat,

2511
01:54:45,850 --> 01:54:50,800
if they're downwind.
So like if the giraffes are eating this 

2512
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:53,591
plant and the wind from the plant,
they're eating goes downwind and catches

2513
01:54:53,811 --> 01:54:55,520
these other,
these other plants,

2514
01:54:55,790 --> 01:55:00,790
the plants will change the chemical 
composition of their leaves and become 

2515
01:55:00,790 --> 01:55:04,271
more bitter,
making them less attractive to 

2516
01:55:04,271 --> 01:55:04,271
predation.

2517
01:55:04,271 --> 01:55:06,110
So they're communicating with each other
like telepathic.

2518
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:08,990
I don't remember what planet was that 
does that,

2519
01:55:09,290 --> 01:55:14,290
but they have proven that plants do 
calculations that plants are doing some 

2520
01:55:14,871 --> 01:55:19,871
sort of some kind of strange mathematics
that they're communicating with each 

2521
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:24,311
other.
They know and other plants are being 

2522
01:55:24,311 --> 01:55:24,830
chopped down.
There's some shit going on with life and

2523
01:55:24,831 --> 01:55:29,831
we don't.
We don't have the capability to 

2524
01:55:29,831 --> 01:55:29,831
understand dolphins.
Okay.

2525
01:55:29,831 --> 01:55:34,240
We don't know what they're saying.
When dolphins communicate with each 

2526
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:34,240
other,
they have a complex language.

2527
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:38,560
They have dialects,
they sound differently in different 

2528
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:38,560
parts of the world.
They recognize each other.

2529
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:41,690
They have a very bizarre way of 
communicating that we have not been able

2530
01:55:41,691 --> 01:55:46,691
to decipher,
but we recognize that that's going on 

2531
01:55:46,691 --> 01:55:49,860
because it's close enough to our own 
kind of communication that we say,

2532
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,920
oh,
these things are smart and they're 

2533
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:54,920
talking to each other.

2534
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:57,920
Well,
there's something going on with plants 

2535
01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,691
too,
and this is a recent thing with a 

2536
01:55:59,691 --> 01:56:00,180
science behind it is starting to catch 
up.

2537
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:05,420
Whether it's emerging,
whether they're doing these tasks and 

2538
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:05,420
they're running these numbers and they 
go,

2539
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:06,030
look,
they're not.

2540
01:56:06,210 --> 01:56:09,570
They're not wooden in the sense that 
it's not like you're not talking about a

2541
01:56:09,571 --> 01:56:14,571
rock like a plant.
A living plant has some sort of 

2542
01:56:14,571 --> 01:56:16,710
awareness.
There's something going on and different

2543
01:56:16,711 --> 01:56:21,711
ones have more awareness,
but in there's some sort of 

2544
01:56:21,711 --> 01:56:24,090
communication through the actual,
the actual ecology of the ground.

2545
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:27,360
I mean,
the ground itself is a living thing.

2546
01:56:27,420 --> 01:56:31,010
Dirt itself is some sort of an organism,
right?

2547
01:56:31,090 --> 01:56:36,090
Mean it is a like a.
Like a person is like a person is an 

2548
01:56:36,090 --> 01:56:39,411
ecosystem.
We're responsible for the lives of 

2549
01:56:39,411 --> 01:56:42,510
untold trillions of bacteria that live 
inside of us.

2550
01:56:42,511 --> 01:56:43,170
Right?
Well,

2551
01:56:43,171 --> 01:56:45,510
that's the same thing can be said of the
dirt itself.

2552
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:50,690
The dirt itself as some sort of a 
strange balanced ecosystem were worms 

2553
01:56:50,701 --> 01:56:55,701
and bacteria and all of these different 
funguses and all these different 

2554
01:56:55,701 --> 01:56:59,960
lifeforms all exist together and then 
the plant feeds off of those life forms 

2555
01:57:00,480 --> 01:57:05,480
and the plant in some respects relies on
the death of biological things like 

2556
01:57:06,151 --> 01:57:10,950
mammals and rats and bugs.
It relies on them for the very nutrients

2557
01:57:10,951 --> 01:57:13,680
that it needs to make a plant in the 
first place.

2558
01:57:13,950 --> 01:57:16,080
It's all very,
very complex.

2559
01:57:16,081 --> 01:57:20,460
All connected.
It's all connected and to deny that your

2560
01:57:20,461 --> 01:57:25,461
eating life some strange life form when 
you're having a salad is the height of 

2561
01:57:25,531 --> 01:57:30,531
convenience.
There's nothing wrong with eating a 

2562
01:57:30,531 --> 01:57:30,750
salad,
but I don't think there's anything wrong

2563
01:57:30,751 --> 01:57:35,751
with eating and elk steak either.
Life is consuming life and it's just 

2564
01:57:35,761 --> 01:57:38,880
more obvious when you shoot an animal 
and you're there when it died.

2565
01:57:39,080 --> 01:57:44,080
What about.
What about when humans find a way to 

2566
01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:48,611
grow meat in a lab,
it's going to be very interesting and 

2567
01:57:48,611 --> 01:57:48,611
they kind of.
They're right there.

2568
01:57:48,630 --> 01:57:53,630
It.
I remember reading something about they 

2569
01:57:53,630 --> 01:57:54,650
had the.
They had the meat ready to go,

2570
01:57:54,950 --> 01:57:59,950
but they couldn't actually consume it 
because the governing body or whatever 

2571
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:01,940
for for food and beverage or whoever the
hell it is,

2572
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:05,360
said that it would be illegal to consume
it for some reason.

2573
01:58:05,361 --> 01:58:08,270
I can some probably some food lobby or 
something,

2574
01:58:08,271 --> 01:58:09,320
but,
but,

2575
01:58:09,530 --> 01:58:10,690
but theoretically,
right.

2576
01:58:11,420 --> 01:58:13,730
We could find a way to manufacture all 
this shit.

2577
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:14,950
One hundred percent.
Yeah,

2578
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:20,000
we can.
Where there's going to be away and then 

2579
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:20,000
what do we do?
What do we do at wildlife?

2580
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:20,000
Then?
It's a good question.

2581
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:21,110
Well here's a.
Here's a better question,

2582
01:58:21,410 --> 01:58:23,650
what do we do when we have robot fuck 
dolls and there's no,

2583
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:26,310
no need to date to what would happen.

2584
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:27,620
I don't think we're,
that.

2585
01:58:27,670 --> 01:58:28,880
I don't.
I think we're already there.

2586
01:58:28,910 --> 01:58:30,860
We're pretty close because,
I mean,

2587
01:58:30,861 --> 01:58:32,960
it's not a robot fuck doll,
but you have,

2588
01:58:33,410 --> 01:58:35,860
you have porn already.
Which many people,

2589
01:58:35,900 --> 01:58:39,180
many people consider to be one of the 
sort of uh,

2590
01:58:40,290 --> 01:58:42,760
uh,
stone building blocks.

2591
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:44,890
That's where I was looking for building 
blocks of the web,

2592
01:58:44,891 --> 01:58:49,270
like the reason that the web was adopted
or vhs or dvds or whatever.

2593
01:58:49,480 --> 01:58:52,300
Html five and it all goes the way of 
porn.

2594
01:58:52,410 --> 01:58:53,530
Porn adopts that.
Everything.

2595
01:58:53,531 --> 01:58:58,531
Everything else follows the sort of 
fundamental needs that people have and 

2596
01:58:58,531 --> 01:58:59,880
so on.
And so yeah,

2597
01:58:59,881 --> 01:59:04,360
I mean you have to wonder how 
disconnected from other people we can,

2598
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:06,820
we can get as this stuff continues to 
improve.

2599
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,210
We were looking earlier at this,
this hollow lens development kit.

2600
01:59:10,420 --> 01:59:12,760
I was recently playing with the htc 
vive,

2601
01:59:12,761 --> 01:59:17,761
which is,
that's probably the vr headset to get 

2602
01:59:17,761 --> 01:59:18,010
right now and it's like,
man,

2603
01:59:18,580 --> 01:59:23,580
these experiences are getting,
they're getting closer and you look at 

2604
01:59:23,580 --> 01:59:25,420
the camera that facebook just came out 
with,

2605
01:59:25,421 --> 01:59:26,590
I don't know,
it's like 60,000

2606
01:59:26,591 --> 01:59:26,890
bucks.

2607
01:59:27,160 --> 01:59:32,160
Facebook buying oculus has to be one of 
the creepiest things on the planet like 

2608
01:59:33,100 --> 01:59:38,100
to know that they see where that's going
and that they were interested in that 

2609
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:40,330
and what their sort of agenda and 
objectives are currently.

2610
01:59:40,350 --> 01:59:41,590
Well,
virtual communities,

2611
01:59:41,680 --> 01:59:46,680
that's what's going to happen.
We're all going to be able to sync up 

2612
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,021
together and some virtual place and 
we'll all be like low calorie takers at 

2613
01:59:49,021 --> 01:59:53,401
that point.
We're all going to look like asian 

2614
01:59:53,401 --> 01:59:53,401
supermodels,
text.

2615
01:59:53,401 --> 01:59:56,760
That's what we're going to be.
You're going to go there and we're all 

2616
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,471
going to sync up with each other and 
we're probably going to be able to fuck 

2617
01:59:58,471 --> 01:59:58,471
each other in some sort of a virtual 
environment.

2618
01:59:58,471 --> 01:59:59,320
Yeah,
it's like total recall,

2619
01:59:59,321 --> 02:00:02,110
man,
but the thing is it's actually tone that

2620
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:03,300
is going to be playing.
Got a really,

2621
02:00:03,310 --> 02:00:04,800
really,
really nice guy.

2622
02:00:05,320 --> 02:00:10,320
The thing is like the physiology part of
it is only part part of the conversation

2623
02:00:10,601 --> 02:00:15,601
does also the psychological part in that
for the most part I feel like there's a 

2624
02:00:16,421 --> 02:00:16,990
trade off.

2625
02:00:17,020 --> 02:00:22,020
I feel like women in my life make me 
different than I would be if they 

2626
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:25,771
weren't in my life.
One hundred percent and in many ways I 

2627
02:00:25,771 --> 02:00:25,771
think they make me a more,
a more,

2628
02:00:25,771 --> 02:00:30,690
a more moderate person.
Like about the way I think about a lot 

2629
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:31,580
of things because you want to fuck and 
you want whatever,

2630
02:00:33,560 --> 02:00:36,040
whatever,
whatever the reasoning is the biological

2631
02:00:36,041 --> 02:00:41,041
part pulls you in,
but then there's a psychological 

2632
02:00:41,041 --> 02:00:42,220
aftermath of you now being a different 
person because of the.

2633
02:00:42,760 --> 02:00:47,760
Because of the moves you made in the 
first place and then there's a 

2634
02:00:47,760 --> 02:00:48,250
compromise you have to figure out how 
much do you compromise?

2635
02:00:48,251 --> 02:00:50,410
Like do you become some sort of henpeck 
bitch?

2636
02:00:50,411 --> 02:00:55,411
Yes.
Because we know a lot of guys that are 

2637
02:00:55,411 --> 02:00:57,480
bitches because they've given in to the 
aggression of their mate like they're 

2638
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:58,060
made is the dominant one in the 
relationship.

2639
02:00:58,330 --> 02:01:00,010
You know,
I have a relative like that.

2640
02:01:00,011 --> 02:01:01,900
I have an uncle like that,
he's got a wife,

2641
02:01:01,901 --> 02:01:04,840
it just runs the ship and everybody just
gets the fuck out of the way.

2642
02:01:04,870 --> 02:01:09,870
So part part,
part of me worries though that like in 

2643
02:01:09,870 --> 02:01:12,901
the absence of those interactions,
what happens to the psyche of males and 

2644
02:01:14,621 --> 02:01:19,621
females now just kind of allowed to 
bathe in their own perspective over and 

2645
02:01:20,681 --> 02:01:23,530
over and over again and never have to 
make those adjustments and never have to

2646
02:01:23,531 --> 02:01:27,510
make those compromises because 
historically that's.

2647
02:01:27,850 --> 02:01:30,880
That hasn't really been a good sign.
You send a bunch of guys into,

2648
02:01:30,881 --> 02:01:35,881
into jail without any females or you 
send them off to war without any 

2649
02:01:35,881 --> 02:01:36,490
females.
They become fucking savages,

2650
02:01:36,491 --> 02:01:41,491
pretty god damn quickly.
So is that what's going to happen is 

2651
02:01:41,491 --> 02:01:45,660
just it's the digital onslaught going to
create some kind of hyper aggressive 

2652
02:01:45,660 --> 02:01:45,660
male.

2653
02:01:45,980 --> 02:01:48,330
It may do the opposite.
Oh,

2654
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:53,440
it may do the opposite because all of 
your sexual needs will be satisfied so 

2655
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,610
easily,
so easily that you'll be satiated.

2656
02:01:55,960 --> 02:02:00,960
So your,
your need for sex is not going to be 

2657
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:04,991
there anymore.
So maybe your need for posturing and 

2658
02:02:04,991 --> 02:02:07,481
aggression won't be there anymore 
because the need for like for you to be 

2659
02:02:07,481 --> 02:02:09,530
preferable to the other men,
you don't have to posture,

2660
02:02:09,531 --> 02:02:11,720
you don't have to,
you don't have to peacock.

2661
02:02:11,810 --> 02:02:16,810
And if you could just put on your 
facebook virtual reality headset and go 

2662
02:02:16,810 --> 02:02:19,820
fuck the asian supermodel and another 
dimension like why would you be with you

2663
02:02:19,821 --> 02:02:24,821
on that?
But what about never having to 

2664
02:02:24,821 --> 02:02:24,821
compromise?
That's a problem.

2665
02:02:24,821 --> 02:02:26,000
See,
because we talked before,

2666
02:02:26,001 --> 02:02:31,001
but all these people that suck because 
they want to control everything about 

2667
02:02:31,001 --> 02:02:33,080
their lives because they don't want to 
interact with people.

2668
02:02:33,130 --> 02:02:34,310
All got to be their way.

2669
02:02:34,370 --> 02:02:39,370
What the fuck is this lineup?
What the fuck is this car in front of 

2670
02:02:39,370 --> 02:02:39,370
me?
What the fuck?

2671
02:02:39,370 --> 02:02:39,370
They said that they want to complain 
about everything.

2672
02:02:39,370 --> 02:02:42,920
I want to sue this person over here and 
do this over there and in an environment

2673
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:47,921
where we take that a step further and 
now we never compromised for other 

2674
02:02:47,921 --> 02:02:48,740
people.
When we do emerge,

2675
02:02:48,770 --> 02:02:52,260
emerge from our headset world,
what?

2676
02:02:52,261 --> 02:02:55,130
What is our personality?
It's a good question because like what?

2677
02:02:55,140 --> 02:03:00,140
What does our personality based on most 
of our personality is based on the long 

2678
02:03:00,140 --> 02:03:04,571
running equation of your life,
all the interactions you've ever had 

2679
02:03:04,571 --> 02:03:08,711
with other people and how they've 
reacted to you and how you've adjusted 

2680
02:03:08,711 --> 02:03:08,711
your personality accordingly.
Yes,

2681
02:03:08,711 --> 02:03:10,970
there's a cool this,
this is reminding me of something.

2682
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:14,150
There's a cool a channel on youtube 
called smarter everyday.

2683
02:03:14,220 --> 02:03:15,550
I don't know if you've ever,
ever heard of.

2684
02:03:15,570 --> 02:03:16,670
Okay,
it's a guy,

2685
02:03:16,671 --> 02:03:18,770
he's a scientist and he does these,
uh,

2686
02:03:18,840 --> 02:03:21,500
he does these videos that sort of a,
I don't know,

2687
02:03:21,940 --> 02:03:26,940
a attack sort of everyday things that 
might seem obvious but then break them 

2688
02:03:26,940 --> 02:03:29,960
down a little bit and what he did a 
video about a bicycle.

2689
02:03:30,500 --> 02:03:32,840
And what happened was this was a bicycle
that was,

2690
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:35,630
had a,
had a gear in the steering.

2691
02:03:35,930 --> 02:03:38,990
So that left was now wright and wright 
was now left.

2692
02:03:39,080 --> 02:03:40,910
Oh,
I remember this.

2693
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:44,630
Maybe you've seen this before.
And what he did was he took this bicycle

2694
02:03:44,631 --> 02:03:48,920
around various talks that he was giving 
a different universities and stuff.

2695
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:54,250
And uh,
and he made a bet to people in the 

2696
02:03:54,250 --> 02:03:56,861
audience,
but you $100 that nobody in here can 

2697
02:03:56,861 --> 02:03:57,290
ride this bike.
And of course every time he got somebody

2698
02:03:57,291 --> 02:03:58,090
coming up going,
I'm going,

2699
02:03:58,130 --> 02:03:59,060
I can do it easily.

2700
02:03:59,060 --> 02:04:01,430
Whatever they get on the bike,
they couldn't pedal it once,

2701
02:04:01,990 --> 02:04:06,990
even even though they are completely 
aware of what change has been made to 

2702
02:04:06,990 --> 02:04:10,331
it.
And so he spent six months before he 

2703
02:04:10,331 --> 02:04:11,090
could actually get down the street on 
his bike.

2704
02:04:11,091 --> 02:04:16,091
That was reversed.
And what he talks about in the video is 

2705
02:04:16,091 --> 02:04:19,301
about how he has the pathways that he 
had created in his mind for how to ride 

2706
02:04:20,391 --> 02:04:21,740
a bike.
Right.

2707
02:04:21,741 --> 02:04:24,620
Were,
were very difficult to rewrite that.

2708
02:04:24,621 --> 02:04:25,970
Once they're in there,
they're in there.

2709
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:29,900
And so he did an experiment where he 
took his eight year old,

2710
02:04:29,901 --> 02:04:34,901
I want to say,
who had just recently learned how to 

2711
02:04:34,901 --> 02:04:34,901
ride a bike the right way,
gave him the same bike.

2712
02:04:34,901 --> 02:04:36,890
And in a couple of weeks he had it down 
the kid.

2713
02:04:36,930 --> 02:04:41,930
The kid could write either bike,
he could ride the reverse bike or the 

2714
02:04:41,930 --> 02:04:43,770
regular bike.
And so he was building this kind of,

2715
02:04:43,771 --> 02:04:45,150
um,
um,

2716
02:04:45,750 --> 02:04:50,750
perspective that like,
but potentially when it comes to 

2717
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:50,750
language,
when it comes to learning,

2718
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:54,471
when it comes to everything,
that the absence of those pathways for 

2719
02:04:54,471 --> 02:04:57,330
young people actually makes them more,
uh,

2720
02:04:57,780 --> 02:04:59,010
flexible.
Yeah.

2721
02:04:59,540 --> 02:05:04,540
A greater ability to change their way of
thinking on a more frequent basis 

2722
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:05,070
because he was looking big picture at 
it.

2723
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:09,270
And the funny thing is when he went back
to go back to the regular bike,

2724
02:05:09,590 --> 02:05:12,560
he couldn't ride the regular bike.
Hm.

2725
02:05:12,980 --> 02:05:14,780
Wow.
That doesn't make any.

2726
02:05:14,810 --> 02:05:15,530
Maybe he's retarded.

2727
02:05:16,170 --> 02:05:17,870
If that's possible.
I doubt it though.

2728
02:05:17,871 --> 02:05:19,720
He's a really smart guy.
I doubt it though.

2729
02:05:19,730 --> 02:05:21,920
He talked to a bunch of.
Might just be on gordon dated.

2730
02:05:22,250 --> 02:05:24,840
I mean it's like I would like to see the
bike.

2731
02:05:25,010 --> 02:05:30,010
We're getting you the bike.
I like to see the same thing with an 

2732
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:32,891
athlete that they could figure it out.
Well they might have a better 

2733
02:05:32,891 --> 02:05:32,891
understanding of how their body works.
It's true.

2734
02:05:32,891 --> 02:05:36,170
I don't think that.
I don't know how critical the test was.

2735
02:05:36,171 --> 02:05:38,660
I think he had,
he had a number of test subjects

2736
02:05:38,830 --> 02:05:40,690
because I just feel like it's like a 
boat,

2737
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,520
you know,
like when you're steering a boat,

2738
02:05:42,580 --> 02:05:46,240
if you want to go right,
you turn the rudder left.

2739
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:51,700
You know what I'm saying?
Like if you have an outboard motor 

2740
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:51,700
behind you and you want to go to the 
right,

2741
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:51,700
you have to go again.

2742
02:05:51,700 --> 02:05:54,790
Conceptually it makes complete sense.
It's the fact that it's actually,

2743
02:05:55,240 --> 02:05:56,230
there it is.
Here it is.

2744
02:05:56,500 --> 02:05:59,290
It's actually not the fact that you 
don't know how it's working.

2745
02:05:59,320 --> 02:06:04,320
It's the fact that you are keep 
triggering back into that state of mind 

2746
02:06:04,320 --> 02:06:05,680
of riding a bike.
When you're riding a bike,

2747
02:06:05,681 --> 02:06:08,740
you're not thinking about riding a bike.
You're just writing it.

2748
02:06:09,700 --> 02:06:12,280
Yeah,
you can watch it.

2749
02:06:12,281 --> 02:06:15,130
Please send a bunch of people fail in in
the actual video.

2750
02:06:15,180 --> 02:06:17,640
Well,
it makes complete sense because pathways

2751
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:22,080
that you've developed are incredibly 
difficult to break and one of the things

2752
02:06:22,110 --> 02:06:27,110
that when I was teaching martial arts I 
found was it's way easier to teach a 

2753
02:06:27,270 --> 02:06:30,420
person who has no martial arts 
experience whatsoever.

2754
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:35,720
Then a person who studied a different 
style where they might be using bad 

2755
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:38,580
mechanics,
so they developed bad mechanics and then

2756
02:06:38,610 --> 02:06:43,610
they came to a really good school.
It was incredibly difficult to break 

2757
02:06:43,610 --> 02:06:47,691
them of their bad habits.
Whereas if I could get two people and 

2758
02:06:47,691 --> 02:06:51,891
one person was um,
they save one person maybe even had a 

2759
02:06:51,891 --> 02:06:54,420
black belt in one style and one person 
was a white belt.

2760
02:06:54,870 --> 02:06:59,870
I feel like if the black belt had bad 
technique and bad form and bad,

2761
02:07:00,270 --> 02:07:05,270
bad mechanics,
if I could watch the two of them 

2762
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:08,901
progress over a few years,
eventually the white belt would surpass 

2763
02:07:08,901 --> 02:07:12,600
the black belt and move forward and be 
able to reach their full potential where

2764
02:07:12,601 --> 02:07:15,570
the black belt with bad mechanics,
even though they might know how to fight

2765
02:07:15,571 --> 02:07:20,571
good because they might know what they 
can do and even though what they're 

2766
02:07:20,571 --> 02:07:22,050
doing is not optimized with the most 
effective technique.

2767
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:27,320
They know what,
how it works and how it fits in the 

2768
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:30,321
language of the community.
Like I think fighting is kind of like a 

2769
02:07:30,321 --> 02:07:30,660
language.
And even with like your shitty words and

2770
02:07:30,661 --> 02:07:35,661
your bad grammar,
you could still form a sentence and 

2771
02:07:35,661 --> 02:07:38,361
still talk and communicate with people 
that's similar to the articulation of a 

2772
02:07:38,361 --> 02:07:42,451
real polished technical martial artist 
versus a person with a very limited 

2773
02:07:42,451 --> 02:07:44,150
vocabulary with street knowledge,
you know,

2774
02:07:44,151 --> 02:07:49,151
you can,
the person with the polish vocabulary 

2775
02:07:49,151 --> 02:07:51,751
will be able to express themselves more 
clearly and expressing yourself is what 

2776
02:07:51,751 --> 02:07:55,411
you're actually doing when you're 
fighting a really cool way to look at 

2777
02:07:55,411 --> 02:07:58,081
it.
So the person who starts out with 

2778
02:07:58,081 --> 02:08:00,370
nothing is better off than the person 
who starts out with shit technique.

2779
02:08:00,780 --> 02:08:05,780
Unless the person who starts out with 
shit technique is super open minded and 

2780
02:08:06,250 --> 02:08:11,250
has no ego and is willing or is it very 
good control of the ego and is willing 

2781
02:08:11,250 --> 02:08:14,590
to try to completely learn everything 
from scratch and not go into it saying,

2782
02:08:14,591 --> 02:08:15,520
hey,
I'm already blackballed.

2783
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:16,820
Already know my shit.
Right?

2784
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:17,980
Yeah.
Most people do.

2785
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:18,780
It's a,

2786
02:08:19,050 --> 02:08:24,050
it's an interesting topic.
I think it applies across the board to 

2787
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:24,050
be quite honest.
Know I,

2788
02:08:24,050 --> 02:08:28,361
um,
I started working with a couple of 

2789
02:08:28,361 --> 02:08:28,361
people in,
in my,

2790
02:08:28,361 --> 02:08:28,361
uh,
for my channel.

2791
02:08:28,361 --> 02:08:32,840
I have an editor now,
he's a guy who I've known for a long 

2792
02:08:32,840 --> 02:08:36,411
time,
but he doesn't have a background in 

2793
02:08:36,411 --> 02:08:38,031
editing at all.
He didn't have any kind of preconceived 

2794
02:08:38,031 --> 02:08:38,031
notions of what these videos should look
like,

2795
02:08:38,031 --> 02:08:39,730
but I,
but I liked that when,

2796
02:08:39,830 --> 02:08:41,370
when he came in because I was like,
you know,

2797
02:08:41,371 --> 02:08:46,371
I can kind of finesse this idea of how I
want things to look and how I want them 

2798
02:08:46,371 --> 02:08:50,280
to be and he can kind of learn starting 
with this,

2799
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:52,290
these parameters,
the ones that,

2800
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:57,350
you know,
as opposed to somebody coming in who 

2801
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:57,350
would have been like a professional in 
this space.

2802
02:08:57,350 --> 02:08:58,330
And I think,
um,

2803
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:02,700
that particular perspective is something
that a lot of startups are doing as well

2804
02:09:02,701 --> 02:09:04,860
when it comes to hiring new people is 
it's like,

2805
02:09:05,190 --> 02:09:10,190
are you hiring a person and their 
skillset or are you hiring a 

2806
02:09:10,190 --> 02:09:11,430
personality?
Are you hiring potential?

2807
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:13,890
And what is the difference in each of 
those decisions?

2808
02:09:14,200 --> 02:09:15,630
Sure.
If you hire a professional,

2809
02:09:15,631 --> 02:09:20,631
it probably,
you're gonna be able to snap your 

2810
02:09:20,631 --> 02:09:20,631
fingers and be and be achieving things 
immediately.

2811
02:09:20,910 --> 02:09:25,910
But in the end is that person that's 
capable of flexing and floating along 

2812
02:09:25,910 --> 02:09:27,390
with the needs of that business over 
time.

2813
02:09:27,850 --> 02:09:30,760
That's good point.
And also do they come into that business

2814
02:09:30,761 --> 02:09:33,580
with a preconceived notion of what their
future is going to be based on,

2815
02:09:33,581 --> 02:09:38,581
like I'm going to move from here to 
there and then I'll get a corner office 

2816
02:09:38,581 --> 02:09:42,211
and then blah.
And they have this idea already mapped 

2817
02:09:42,211 --> 02:09:42,220
out in front of them and then when 
things aren't that way,

2818
02:09:42,550 --> 02:09:45,670
they may be disappointed or don't know 
how to react.

2819
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:50,790
Yeah.
This is the equivalent of the bicycle 

2820
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:50,790
pathway thing

2821
02:09:50,790 --> 02:09:51,400
mapped out in like a different scenario 
and.

2822
02:09:51,401 --> 02:09:54,180
But it gets me thinking about myself too
in the,

2823
02:09:54,260 --> 02:09:54,760
in,
in,

2824
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:58,450
in what are my pathways that I can't 
break in.

2825
02:09:58,451 --> 02:10:03,451
Went in thinking about subject matter in
looking at the way I behave because I 

2826
02:10:03,451 --> 02:10:08,041
feel like I feel like the not being able
to ride the bike the other way is the 

2827
02:10:08,041 --> 02:10:11,200
perfect example of how we,
how we treat a lot of things like our.

2828
02:10:11,201 --> 02:10:13,660
I think our perspective should always be
floating.

2829
02:10:13,840 --> 02:10:16,300
We should always be able to,
you know,

2830
02:10:16,301 --> 02:10:17,950
in politics and stuff they're always 
done,

2831
02:10:17,951 --> 02:10:19,810
but that guy,
he flipped flopped.

2832
02:10:19,811 --> 02:10:21,270
He used to say that.
Now he says yes.

2833
02:10:21,271 --> 02:10:21,310
Says,

2834
02:10:21,330 --> 02:10:22,370
well,
isn't that normal?

2835
02:10:22,371 --> 02:10:27,371
Isn't that life will flip flopping and 
politics is hilarious because it's the 

2836
02:10:27,651 --> 02:10:31,820
one part of life where you're supposed 
to have a preformed decision by the time

2837
02:10:31,821 --> 02:10:34,480
you enter into public office and that 
never changes.

2838
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:37,760
Like you can't evolve.
It's weird as a society

2839
02:10:37,850 --> 02:10:42,850
seems that we,
we value for some reason a person who 

2840
02:10:42,850 --> 02:10:44,540
doesn't change their opinion when in 
reality it should be the other thing.

2841
02:10:44,640 --> 02:10:48,190
Well also some of these opinions,
it's not like murder is bad,

2842
02:10:48,670 --> 02:10:53,670
you know what I mean?
I mean there are complex issues that 

2843
02:10:53,670 --> 02:10:53,670
were under a lot of consideration.
Yes.

2844
02:10:54,040 --> 02:10:59,040
You know,
I mean especially when it comes to 

2845
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:00,391
things about maybe the economy or things
about what should and shouldn't be a 

2846
02:11:00,391 --> 02:11:01,800
crime and you know,
and what,

2847
02:11:02,090 --> 02:11:07,090
you know,
is it actually a crime to make people 

2848
02:11:07,090 --> 02:11:10,740
prisoners?
Is that more of a crime then then 

2849
02:11:10,740 --> 02:11:10,990
selling drugs?
Like what is the crime here?

2850
02:11:11,080 --> 02:11:16,080
No,
it should be dynamic and it always has 

2851
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:16,080
been dynamic.
That's the thing,

2852
02:11:16,080 --> 02:11:17,710
but I don't know what it is exactly that
holds it back.

2853
02:11:17,711 --> 02:11:22,711
I also,
I think it's a fine line because on the 

2854
02:11:22,711 --> 02:11:25,260
other side of it,
if a person's bouncing around from day 

2855
02:11:25,260 --> 02:11:25,590
to day on how they feel about something,
it can be a fucking nightmare as well.

2856
02:11:25,620 --> 02:11:30,620
Well then they shouldn't be a leader 
mean that sort of even need in your 

2857
02:11:30,620 --> 02:11:30,620
life,
in a relationship.

2858
02:11:31,150 --> 02:11:36,150
It's like it's like there's this really 
this groove somewhere in the middle of 

2859
02:11:36,150 --> 02:11:38,230
like committing to certain things,
but being open minded about others.

2860
02:11:38,231 --> 02:11:39,790
It's like kind of a balance to it.

2861
02:11:40,070 --> 02:11:42,170
Isn't that the case with pretty much 
everything in life,

2862
02:11:42,171 --> 02:11:47,171
that life really doesn't have a whole 
lot of real solid black and whites that 

2863
02:11:47,171 --> 02:11:49,860
there's a lot of room for consideration.
There's a lot of.

2864
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:53,270
A lot of variables that you're managing 
on a daily basis.

2865
02:11:53,420 --> 02:11:55,250
Definitely comes to many things in life.
Definitely,

2866
02:11:55,330 --> 02:11:57,890
and that's why a lot of things when you 
look at them to go,

2867
02:11:57,891 --> 02:11:58,460
oh,
well,

2868
02:11:58,461 --> 02:12:03,461
okay,
well there's a lot of ways to look at 

2869
02:12:03,461 --> 02:12:05,081
this and when someone wants to come at 
it from a real hard black or white 

2870
02:12:05,081 --> 02:12:06,570
perspective,
that usually is either someone with a,

2871
02:12:06,571 --> 02:12:11,571
like a deep agenda or someone who 
doesn't have a considered nuance 

2872
02:12:12,141 --> 02:12:14,300
perspective of the subject of hayes.
One of them

2873
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:19,340
most.
It's one of the most frustrating things 

2874
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:20,810
about like living a substantial part of 
my life on the internet is that,

2875
02:12:21,570 --> 02:12:23,750
and I don't know if we talked about this
previously or not,

2876
02:12:23,751 --> 02:12:28,751
but it's like,
it's this idea of everybody having kind 

2877
02:12:28,751 --> 02:12:28,751
of a,
a,

2878
02:12:28,751 --> 02:12:32,500
a microphone.
Everybody being able to blast out there.

2879
02:12:32,790 --> 02:12:34,670
They're kind of a perspective.
Like,

2880
02:12:35,500 --> 02:12:40,500
I don't like the comments section on 
youtube and my comments are not that 

2881
02:12:40,500 --> 02:12:40,520
bad.
Okay?

2882
02:12:40,521 --> 02:12:44,160
But I don't like the way it works.
The idea that you could,

2883
02:12:44,200 --> 02:12:47,720
you could create this video,
put all this effort into it,

2884
02:12:48,230 --> 02:12:53,230
uh,
formulate a perspective and then 

2885
02:12:53,230 --> 02:12:55,820
everybody's going to scroll to the top 
comment and this dude put in what,

2886
02:12:56,300 --> 02:13:00,380
10 seconds a knee jerk reaction and he 
gets to occupied at real estate.

2887
02:13:01,130 --> 02:13:03,590
I don't like it.
I think there's a better way to do that.

2888
02:13:03,650 --> 02:13:08,650
What is the better way?
And then the person who published the 

2889
02:13:09,621 --> 02:13:14,621
thing has to have a little bit more 
control over kind of like in a forum 

2890
02:13:14,621 --> 02:13:19,600
traditionally how you could have 
moderators who had certain abilities 

2891
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:23,470
that others didn't.
You should be able to promote people in 

2892
02:13:23,470 --> 02:13:23,960
your community to be kind of the 
authority figures,

2893
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:26,480
just like everything else you have to 
manage in life when it comes to.

2894
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:28,690
But doesn't that censorship?
And a lot of ways.

2895
02:13:28,691 --> 02:13:29,550
I mean,
no,

2896
02:13:29,820 --> 02:13:31,060
I don't think it seems to have the 
option.

2897
02:13:31,140 --> 02:13:32,130
Have not have comments.

2898
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,090
Okay.
But that's not,

2899
02:13:33,210 --> 02:13:34,860
that's not a good look.
It's not a good look.

2900
02:13:35,580 --> 02:13:39,150
You have comments turned off if you're a
feminist.

2901
02:13:39,510 --> 02:13:44,510
Yeah.
Like if I come to your video and you 

2902
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:44,510
have comments turned off,
I'm like,

2903
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:44,510
oh,
I get it.

2904
02:13:44,510 --> 02:13:46,440
I get it.
You're probably talking bullshit because

2905
02:13:46,441 --> 02:13:49,500
you're not even willing to have the to 
have anybody saying anything here.

2906
02:13:49,530 --> 02:13:50,280
Well,
they can say it.

2907
02:13:50,281 --> 02:13:52,380
They just cannot say right underneath 
your work.

2908
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:53,460
Yes.
See,

2909
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:58,050
I wish I'm thinking it would be cool 
that if it was that way it would be cool

2910
02:13:58,230 --> 02:14:03,230
and trust me whenever I engage in 
anything slightly more artistic or 

2911
02:14:03,230 --> 02:14:04,290
subjective online,
I'm like,

2912
02:14:04,380 --> 02:14:05,250
I'm thinking,
man,

2913
02:14:05,251 --> 02:14:10,251
it'd be cool to turn off the comments 
and let it just let it breathe a little 

2914
02:14:10,251 --> 02:14:10,800
bit.
But at the same time I'm like,

2915
02:14:10,801 --> 02:14:15,440
this is the format that has been what 
everyone's accepted and and,

2916
02:14:15,441 --> 02:14:17,280
and,
and expects now.

2917
02:14:17,490 --> 02:14:22,490
And so I feel like probably the 
healthier approach is this idea of 

2918
02:14:22,490 --> 02:14:26,181
tweaking it and what are the numbers 
like what percentage of people actually 

2919
02:14:27,340 --> 02:14:32,160
comment fucking dominate the goddamn 
perspective.

2920
02:14:32,250 --> 02:14:37,250
That's the problem.
And the ones with the shittiest points 

2921
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:37,250
of view are the ones that are the 
loudest,

2922
02:14:37,250 --> 02:14:39,240
loudest,
most black and white.

2923
02:14:39,270 --> 02:14:41,970
Just like the headline science we were 
talking about before.

2924
02:14:42,010 --> 02:14:47,010
There's a reaction that you have to 
really negative aggressively shitty 

2925
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:47,010
comment,
yes,

2926
02:14:47,010 --> 02:14:51,620
or I'm going to reply to that and now 
now there's a whole thread underneath of

2927
02:14:51,621 --> 02:14:56,621
that guy single comment which then 
pushes it to the top because it's 

2928
02:14:56,621 --> 02:14:58,590
creating conversation and this is stuff 
that like on the highest level,

2929
02:14:58,740 --> 02:15:01,470
the biggest businesses in the space.
If you're google,

2930
02:15:01,471 --> 02:15:05,040
if you're facebook or they're having 
board room meetings about this stuff,

2931
02:15:05,130 --> 02:15:10,130
you hear about what clinton's doing.
Know hillary clinton is spending 

2932
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:13,191
$1,000,000
to combat forum trolls and people on 

2933
02:15:13,561 --> 02:15:16,590
reddit and twitter and social media.

2934
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:18,570
Yeah.
What with her own mercenaries,

2935
02:15:18,571 --> 02:15:23,571
who was going to do it?
They have a hundred people that are 

2936
02:15:23,571 --> 02:15:26,301
working for her that actively go out and
correct people that are saying negative 

2937
02:15:27,991 --> 02:15:32,991
things about this fucking career 
criminal and might be the president 

2938
02:15:32,991 --> 02:15:33,360
United States day.
I don't like that either.

2939
02:15:33,590 --> 02:15:37,170
You know when I'm talking about maybe 
tweaking the comment system.

2940
02:15:37,171 --> 02:15:39,470
Hell no to that,
but look at this like,

2941
02:15:39,750 --> 02:15:42,840
do you have a junior?
It is bizarre.

2942
02:15:42,870 --> 02:15:43,610
Yeah,
it's creepy,

2943
02:15:43,611 --> 02:15:48,611
man.
This is the first time anyone has ever 

2944
02:15:48,611 --> 02:15:49,881
done this before.
Done it opened the way that politicians 

2945
02:15:49,881 --> 02:15:53,300
have been able to use social media,
paying online trolls to attack anyone 

2946
02:15:53,300 --> 02:15:54,350
disparages her pay.
Who?

2947
02:15:54,400 --> 02:15:58,350
Who's the guy who wrote that?
Isn't that the guy that twitter guy who.

2948
02:15:58,680 --> 02:15:59,730
Oh,
cool.

2949
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:04,620
We're complaint is the white guy.
That does be black.

2950
02:16:05,010 --> 02:16:07,170
It's not easy.
It definitely is.

2951
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:08,630
I don't know.
I haven't fallen it.

2952
02:16:08,650 --> 02:16:11,370
If you'd follow it,
there's no evidence whatsoever.

2953
02:16:11,371 --> 02:16:13,290
There's any african american in him at 
all.

2954
02:16:13,291 --> 02:16:15,600
You'll get his brothers and his sister.
They all look like him.

2955
02:16:15,601 --> 02:16:17,730
His dad's white.
The whole thing's a mess.

2956
02:16:17,731 --> 02:16:19,740
His mom's white.
Yeah.

2957
02:16:19,830 --> 02:16:23,790
Don't ever pull up this guy's articles.
There's a lot of other articles on it.

2958
02:16:24,420 --> 02:16:26,160
That guy's a fucking fraud.

2959
02:16:28,500 --> 02:16:33,500
It's weird that that guys employed to.
He's employed by like the daily news or 

2960
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:35,050
something like that.
Jesus christ like.

2961
02:16:35,230 --> 02:16:38,710
Do you guys have google?
Like what are you doing daily news?

2962
02:16:39,220 --> 02:16:42,000
It's probably because you can promote 
the article and tweeted out.

2963
02:16:42,020 --> 02:16:47,020
I assume he has a following I guess,
and there's a lot of that going on that 

2964
02:16:47,020 --> 02:16:50,350
that is a lot of what's happening with 
with these newspapers too.

2965
02:16:50,380 --> 02:16:55,380
They've.
They've sort of fallen into a state 

2966
02:16:55,380 --> 02:16:56,650
realm to have to survive on that.
Do you remember when they used to try to

2967
02:16:56,890 --> 02:16:58,720
make you pay to subscribe?
They,

2968
02:16:58,721 --> 02:17:00,220
some do.
New york times is still pay.

2969
02:17:00,221 --> 02:17:05,221
Well you can still do that and articles 
and then you had to pay to continue 

2970
02:17:05,221 --> 02:17:09,541
beyond news papers.
I mean those institutions and the most 

2971
02:17:09,541 --> 02:17:12,130
entitled group of people that still 
exists.

2972
02:17:12,131 --> 02:17:17,131
Then maybe radio.
I can't wait to be honest for every car 

2973
02:17:17,131 --> 02:17:18,930
on the planet to ship with android auto 
or,

2974
02:17:19,010 --> 02:17:23,380
or apple car play because then it's a 
wrap android art.

2975
02:17:23,630 --> 02:17:28,210
But the problem is like I've seen a lot 
of cars that have google car play.

2976
02:17:28,211 --> 02:17:29,530
I haven't had one of my cars.
Okay,

2977
02:17:29,531 --> 02:17:30,460
cool.
But I don't,

2978
02:17:30,940 --> 02:17:33,400
I don't recall ever seeing a car with 
android auto,

2979
02:17:33,460 --> 02:17:38,460
but it's an android.
At least 50 percent of the smartphone 

2980
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:38,460
market.
Oh yeah.

2981
02:17:38,460 --> 02:17:39,420
Probably more.
Um,

2982
02:17:39,550 --> 02:17:41,710
maybe not in the us globally.
It's more than 50.

2983
02:17:41,860 --> 02:17:46,860
More than 50,
but it because in emerging markets 

2984
02:17:46,860 --> 02:17:47,880
nobody can afford iphones.
You know,

2985
02:17:48,350 --> 02:17:49,840
you,
you could tell me this,

2986
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:53,890
like the latest samsung,
the galaxy s seven.

2987
02:17:53,891 --> 02:17:56,430
Yeah.
It's basically a wrap right there,

2988
02:17:56,480 --> 02:17:59,260
a wash,
you've got pros and cons,

2989
02:17:59,261 --> 02:18:01,570
but they're both pretty goddamn camera.
Yeah.

2990
02:18:01,720 --> 02:18:02,530
Oh,
100 percent.

2991
02:18:02,531 --> 02:18:05,290
I wouldn't have a problem recommending.
Yeah.

2992
02:18:05,720 --> 02:18:09,610
An s seven.
Any of the nexus devices?

2993
02:18:10,020 --> 02:18:11,500
Uh,
what else?

2994
02:18:11,501 --> 02:18:16,501
I mean,
the one that I didn't really like that 

2995
02:18:16,501 --> 02:18:16,501
much.
I haven't made a video about it.

2996
02:18:16,501 --> 02:18:20,850
Sometimes the problem with me is 
sometimes if I'm not into something I 

2997
02:18:20,850 --> 02:18:21,030
just don't make a video about it.
And so people are like,

2998
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,140
well I just got what you so fucking 
excited about everything.

2999
02:18:23,141 --> 02:18:24,010
It's like,
well shit,

3000
02:18:24,011 --> 02:18:29,011
I want to make video,
but that stuff I'm excited about trying 

3001
02:18:29,011 --> 02:18:29,011
to be positive.
Yeah.

3002
02:18:29,011 --> 02:18:30,190
Like I understand how that can look 
like,

3003
02:18:30,191 --> 02:18:31,820
you know,
you're just always taking,

3004
02:18:31,840 --> 02:18:36,840
you're not taking a strong position,
but it's like if I put my sim card into 

3005
02:18:36,840 --> 02:18:38,830
a phone and I'm not feeling it,
it's not going to last very long,

3006
02:18:39,150 --> 02:18:40,330
you know?
So anyway,

3007
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:42,640
I had some issues with lgs.
Latest phone,

3008
02:18:42,641 --> 02:18:47,440
even though I like some stuff about it 
that [inaudible] it's a modular phone so

3009
02:18:47,441 --> 02:18:48,880
it's like,
I don't know if you remember,

3010
02:18:48,881 --> 02:18:53,881
there was this thing called project aria
project or a project I remember it was a

3011
02:18:54,890 --> 02:18:55,880
modular could like.

3012
02:18:56,330 --> 02:18:58,150
Anyway,
That obviously never happened,

3013
02:18:58,151 --> 02:19:02,110
but lg kind of a took,
took the approach of like trying to make

3014
02:19:02,111 --> 02:19:03,820
what the consumer version of that would 
look like.

3015
02:19:03,821 --> 02:19:08,821
So tHere's modules,
so the battery compartment you can pull 

3016
02:19:08,821 --> 02:19:12,571
out the battery and then re insert like 
a camera module which is going to give 

3017
02:19:12,571 --> 02:19:14,890
you a better grip,
different attributes to the camera.

3018
02:19:15,590 --> 02:19:19,260
You can pull this fucking thing up,
you can pull that out and you could put,

3019
02:19:19,370 --> 02:19:24,370
put in,
put in another module which is a better 

3020
02:19:24,370 --> 02:19:26,140
headphone amplifier so you can run 
better headphones off of your phone.

3021
02:19:26,680 --> 02:19:27,320
Yeah.
So.

3022
02:19:27,650 --> 02:19:30,560
And I like that kind of shit.
Turns me on.

3023
02:19:31,070 --> 02:19:33,200
I liked that stuff.
So when I see it I'm like fuck,

3024
02:19:33,201 --> 02:19:36,320
I want to support that.
Even if it's not 100 percent polished.

3025
02:19:36,910 --> 02:19:37,940
Yeah.
So here we go.

3026
02:19:37,941 --> 02:19:38,820
If you scroll down,
you'll,

3027
02:19:38,821 --> 02:19:43,821
you'll see if you can see how the 
battery pulled out on the bottom and 

3028
02:19:43,821 --> 02:19:46,751
that picture there so that they call 
them friends as a bit of an issue with 

3029
02:19:46,751 --> 02:19:47,300
translation there.

3030
02:19:48,020 --> 02:19:48,680
But,
uh,

3031
02:19:48,681 --> 02:19:52,520
the different modules are called friends
and you'll see here he can slide it out.

3032
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:56,210
Hopefully he does in this clip here,
there so that pops out.

3033
02:19:56,990 --> 02:19:59,330
And you could even just carry around 
another battery,

3034
02:19:59,390 --> 02:20:02,510
which that's becoming a tougher thing to
do with phones.

3035
02:20:02,511 --> 02:20:05,830
Obviously you're getting killed here.
Fucking hit.

3036
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:09,320
I'll look at the options.
I don't want to save.

3037
02:20:09,710 --> 02:20:11,390
I want to be a loser.
Can I click on,

3038
02:20:11,391 --> 02:20:13,560
I want to be able to.
So,

3039
02:20:13,640 --> 02:20:14,690
so anyway,
um,

3040
02:20:14,691 --> 02:20:19,691
I hope,
I don't know if they show any of the 

3041
02:20:19,691 --> 02:20:20,981
other modules here,
but they're opening it up to third 

3042
02:20:20,981 --> 02:20:23,081
parties as a port.
So essentially if you're a in audio 

3043
02:20:23,081 --> 02:20:24,730
maker and you want to have your own amp 
or,

3044
02:20:24,780 --> 02:20:28,790
or if you're a god knows what accessory 
you might want to have utilized,

3045
02:20:28,791 --> 02:20:30,440
that may be a bigger battery,
you know,

3046
02:20:30,441 --> 02:20:32,490
maybe uh,
um,

3047
02:20:32,840 --> 02:20:33,650
who knows,
whatever,

3048
02:20:33,651 --> 02:20:38,651
whatever it is that you might want to 
improve that you could access that and 

3049
02:20:38,651 --> 02:20:38,651
do so what an uphill battle it is 
though,

3050
02:20:38,651 --> 02:20:41,600
for these cell phone companies to come 
up with something that you can get other

3051
02:20:41,601 --> 02:20:46,601
people to jump in on and make 
accessories for because people look at 

3052
02:20:46,601 --> 02:20:46,601
and go,
man,

3053
02:20:46,601 --> 02:20:46,850
I don't know if this is going to catch 
on,

3054
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:52,030
do we,
do we use our resources and our 

3055
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:52,030
engineers to develop something.

3056
02:20:52,030 --> 02:20:54,380
This is Lg platform when we can just 
make some shit for the iphone.

3057
02:20:54,381 --> 02:20:55,840
And it's gonna sell for sure.
Yep.

3058
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:01,000
And this is a problem.
This is why there's such a huge 

3059
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:01,100
abundance of accessories for that 
platform.

3060
02:21:01,101 --> 02:21:03,200
And it's something to consider for a 
person.

3061
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:05,100
There's some of the modules,
wow.

3062
02:21:05,101 --> 02:21:10,101
The module and the,
that brown one is that the camera one 

3063
02:21:10,101 --> 02:21:10,970
that what the fuck wouldn't grip.
So you get a real shutter,

3064
02:21:10,971 --> 02:21:15,971
like a regular camera.
what does that upper left one that was 

3065
02:21:15,971 --> 02:21:16,940
like a speaker that's actually lgs 
camera one.

3066
02:21:17,130 --> 02:21:22,130
so that's a camera.
So basically what it does is it gives 

3067
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:25,481
you a bigger battery first of all and 
then it gives you some control over the 

3068
02:21:25,481 --> 02:21:29,861
shutter as well as a wheel now under 
professional camera that we'll normally 

3069
02:21:29,861 --> 02:21:34,691
it would be mapped to like shutter speed
or something more professional style of 

3070
02:21:34,851 --> 02:21:35,540
interaction.

3071
02:21:35,570 --> 02:21:40,570
So it wouldn't just be clicking go,
you could get more control over the 

3072
02:21:40,570 --> 02:21:41,150
manual functions of it.
and uh,

3073
02:21:41,160 --> 02:21:46,160
that went in the middle I think is a,
a digital analog converter.

3074
02:21:46,251 --> 02:21:51,251
So headphone amp from,
I think it's bang and olufsen some high 

3075
02:21:51,251 --> 02:21:52,220
end audio company.
So you can drive bigger headphones.

3076
02:21:52,221 --> 02:21:53,990
But anyway,
I really liked the approach.

3077
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:59,000
Another thing they did on that phone is 
they put two lenses on the back and a 

3078
02:21:59,000 --> 02:21:59,930
lot of people think on the next iphone 
we might see two lenses as well.

3079
02:22:00,740 --> 02:22:03,680
Among I'll ask,
I'll ask you this before I get into this

3080
02:22:03,681 --> 02:22:05,030
next part.
Did actually know what,

3081
02:22:05,031 --> 02:22:08,570
I'm going to get to that in a second.
I'm going to go do dual lens,

3082
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:10,820
but uh,
the dual lens on the,

3083
02:22:11,240 --> 02:22:16,240
on the lg,
one of them is super wide angle so you 

3084
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:16,240
can capture a really wide frame.

3085
02:22:16,240 --> 02:22:20,650
This is one of them,
that's one of my pet peeves about a 

3086
02:22:20,650 --> 02:22:21,710
phone cameras and you can see both of 
them there if they're not very wide.

3087
02:22:21,950 --> 02:22:25,920
So like you want to capture like a group
or architecture or beach or something.

3088
02:22:25,921 --> 02:22:28,170
It's always like this really narrow 
field of view.

3089
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:33,680
So in this particular case one of them 
is super wide and one of them is a more 

3090
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:35,850
standard field of view and so it's like 
having an interchangeable lens system,

3091
02:22:35,851 --> 02:22:40,851
but it's always in your phone.
So right from within the app you can 

3092
02:22:40,851 --> 02:22:40,920
switch between lenses.
That's interesting.

3093
02:22:40,950 --> 02:22:41,670
Yeah,
I like that.

3094
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:43,740
So the iphone might do something 
similar.

3095
02:22:43,741 --> 02:22:46,140
What do you not like about this?
Okay.

3096
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:50,100
So what is it?
I don't know how fair it is,

3097
02:22:50,101 --> 02:22:55,101
but really the way I evaluate a phone,
he's how it kind of interacts with all 

3098
02:22:55,101 --> 02:22:56,790
the other devices that I expected to 
interact with,

3099
02:22:56,791 --> 02:23:00,060
so for example,
if I get in my truck and I wanted,

3100
02:23:00,150 --> 02:23:03,000
I want this shit to seamlessly connect 
via bluetooth,

3101
02:23:03,110 --> 02:23:05,280
start playing my podcast and so on.

3102
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:07,560
ThIs phone,
for whatever reason,

3103
02:23:07,620 --> 02:23:12,620
it had no problem linking up the 
multimedia portion to play the music,

3104
02:23:13,790 --> 02:23:17,070
the podcasts,
but the headset portion and for whatever

3105
02:23:17,071 --> 02:23:20,280
reason it wouldn't connect for answering
phone calls via my bluetooth.

3106
02:23:20,640 --> 02:23:21,960
Again,
this is anecdotal,

3107
02:23:21,961 --> 02:23:23,820
this is my personal experience.
We shouldn't.

3108
02:23:24,150 --> 02:23:26,760
It's tough to even put that out there 
because who knows?

3109
02:23:26,761 --> 02:23:29,220
It's just the way that's talking to my 
my truck,

3110
02:23:29,790 --> 02:23:33,150
but that that issue doesn't exist with 
any of the other flagships,

3111
02:23:33,151 --> 02:23:35,010
so that's something that I'm going to 
consider.

3112
02:23:35,630 --> 02:23:38,580
Another thing is build,
so a lot of people were upset because of

3113
02:23:38,581 --> 02:23:40,830
the way that that modular portion fits 
in.

3114
02:23:40,860 --> 02:23:44,010
It's not completelY flush.
It's a little bit rough around the edges

3115
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:47,940
and so again,
it's so competitive in this marketplace.

3116
02:23:48,090 --> 02:23:52,140
Any lIttle inch you're going to give up,
it's going to have a drastic impact.

3117
02:23:52,141 --> 02:23:54,180
Then lastly,
I don't like their software,

3118
02:23:54,181 --> 02:23:57,030
their skin that they put on android,
but we talked about this before.

3119
02:23:57,030 --> 02:24:00,660
I'm a purist when it comes to that and I
usually modify that anyways,

3120
02:24:00,661 --> 02:24:04,770
but there was some weirdness from the 
get go about not just the skin they have

3121
02:24:04,771 --> 02:24:09,771
on there but.
But how hard it is to really switch it 

3122
02:24:09,771 --> 02:24:11,910
around too much to the samsung theme 
store is a little bit more elaborate.

3123
02:24:11,970 --> 02:24:16,970
If you want to change the appearance of 
the way your touchwiz touch with has 

3124
02:24:16,970 --> 02:24:20,031
gotten a lot better,
but I still have a nexis in my pocket 

3125
02:24:20,031 --> 02:24:20,031
right now.
So now the nexus phones,

3126
02:24:20,031 --> 02:24:22,440
what is,
what's the service aluminate this.

3127
02:24:22,450 --> 02:24:27,450
There's something where with google you 
can pay google and that becomes your 

3128
02:24:28,681 --> 02:24:33,681
provider and you are.
Your phone will work on everything t 

3129
02:24:33,681 --> 02:24:34,350
mobile not as.
Not everything?

3130
02:24:34,351 --> 02:24:35,630
No.
What is it?

3131
02:24:35,820 --> 02:24:37,020
I don't think so.
No,

3132
02:24:37,050 --> 02:24:42,050
no.
I think it's just a select carriers 

3133
02:24:42,050 --> 02:24:42,990
because I don't think the verizon bands 
are different or their cdma.

3134
02:24:43,410 --> 02:24:44,250
Right?
Yeah.

3135
02:24:44,280 --> 02:24:49,280
I think the thought that cdma and gsm,
like most phones will work on cdma and 

3136
02:24:49,280 --> 02:24:50,880
gsm,
like the iphones will like if you travel

3137
02:24:50,881 --> 02:24:53,260
overseas and you're in a gsm 
environment.

3138
02:24:53,620 --> 02:24:54,280
Yeah,
I have.

3139
02:24:54,430 --> 02:24:57,330
Iphone is actually one of the few.
I'm not sure if nexus does or not,

3140
02:24:57,331 --> 02:25:00,510
but that seems crazy that they wouldn't.
It bounces around.

3141
02:25:00,511 --> 02:25:03,780
I think it might be t mobile and it can 
bounce to sprint and a t and t.

3142
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:08,810
That's cdma and gsm as well.
Then they're going back and forth 

3143
02:25:08,810 --> 02:25:08,810
between two different types of.
They are.

3144
02:25:08,880 --> 02:25:11,760
I'm not 100 percent sure that service is
not available where I am.

3145
02:25:11,880 --> 02:25:12,310
Oh,
okay.

3146
02:25:12,320 --> 02:25:13,380
Okay.
Just in Canada.

3147
02:25:13,830 --> 02:25:16,140
No,
so I'm not 100 percent sure on that,

3148
02:25:16,141 --> 02:25:20,190
but with nexus devices in general,
you do whatever you want with them.

3149
02:25:20,191 --> 02:25:25,191
They're completely unlocked,
so even if you just went to the google 

3150
02:25:25,191 --> 02:25:26,410
google play store and ordered a nexus 
six p or five x,

3151
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:31,920
any sim card you put in there is going 
to work and nexus does it that way so 

3152
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:32,890
they can give you the pure google 
experience.

3153
02:25:32,890 --> 02:25:35,340
You're buying it directly from google 
witHout skins?

3154
02:25:35,380 --> 02:25:40,380
No apps,
no touch with no bullshit and the tough 

3155
02:25:40,380 --> 02:25:42,961
part about that is there's so few people
who have ever even experienced it 

3156
02:25:42,961 --> 02:25:43,810
because you can't pick it up in a 
verizon store and att and t store.

3157
02:25:44,350 --> 02:25:46,270
That's got to be frustrated for the 
google people.

3158
02:25:46,390 --> 02:25:48,040
Yeah,
I think so.

3159
02:25:48,130 --> 02:25:53,130
But at the same time it feels like they 
could do more from a marketing 

3160
02:25:53,130 --> 02:25:53,130
perspective to build awareness around 
the brand.

3161
02:25:53,240 --> 02:25:55,540
I would definitely because um,
I mean I'm barely aware of it.

3162
02:25:55,570 --> 02:25:58,090
I know most people are.
I think part of it has to do with,

3163
02:25:58,091 --> 02:25:59,590
it's kind of like,
uh,

3164
02:25:59,700 --> 02:26:03,010
the oil business and the highway 
business and it's like you don't want to

3165
02:26:03,011 --> 02:26:06,960
piss off carriers.
Carrier still pull so much weight and so

3166
02:26:07,010 --> 02:26:12,010
it's weird that the carriers would want 
to just all over the soup we are back 

3167
02:26:12,010 --> 02:26:12,040
there.

3168
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:12,850
Yeah.
Yeah.

3169
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:15,100
Now the carriers on the,
hey,

3170
02:26:15,101 --> 02:26:20,101
I mean there's tons of evidence of 
verizon and comcast and fucking,

3171
02:26:21,941 --> 02:26:26,941
you name it,
they're all trying to protect this 

3172
02:26:26,941 --> 02:26:29,251
really this really strange business.
I mean they started out as what cable 

3173
02:26:29,251 --> 02:26:33,511
companies and give doing home phones and
then it was like all of a sudden this 

3174
02:26:33,511 --> 02:26:37,961
whole thing was mobile and we've seen t 
and we could and we could bounce around 

3175
02:26:37,961 --> 02:26:41,611
and we had and it's like a really.
The busIness has changed but they've 

3176
02:26:41,611 --> 02:26:43,840
continued to try to lock you into this 
bundle,

3177
02:26:44,260 --> 02:26:49,260
the bundle of things that you could have
the tv package that's $200 and you 

3178
02:26:49,260 --> 02:26:53,881
watched four stations and I mean their 
banking so hard that I can understand 

3179
02:26:54,101 --> 02:26:55,550
why that,
what they're trying to protect,

3180
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:59,110
they trying to lock you in.
Anything you buy that they going to lock

3181
02:26:59,111 --> 02:27:01,180
you into a contract and it's a few 
hundred dollars.

3182
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:03,550
I mean it's pretty obvious there's a bit
of a play there.

3183
02:27:03,730 --> 02:27:06,580
Yeah.
People are wising up to a lot of people.

3184
02:27:06,670 --> 02:27:09,040
A lot more people are buying their own 
devices now.

3185
02:27:09,130 --> 02:27:14,130
So jamie,
see if you can figure out what exactly 

3186
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:15,020
that nexus service is,
how it works.

3187
02:27:15,690 --> 02:27:17,590
Well,
google project five.

3188
02:27:17,640 --> 02:27:22,640
Yeah.
It does not saying anything on here 

3189
02:27:22,640 --> 02:27:23,730
specifically about which network 
networks.

3190
02:27:23,750 --> 02:27:28,750
Click on the network button.
It just says that judas is the best 

3191
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:28,750
network and it goes from lte to fly back
and forth.

3192
02:27:28,750 --> 02:27:32,200
It doesn't say which carrier.
They're actually in an lc to wifi.

3193
02:27:32,470 --> 02:27:34,190
Yeah.
It bounces back on lte.

3194
02:27:34,310 --> 02:27:36,100
Lte.
I'm sorry to wifi.

3195
02:27:36,740 --> 02:27:38,300
Um,
so,

3196
02:27:38,330 --> 02:27:43,330
but how is it using wifi?
This two to four g lte networks to 

3197
02:27:44,560 --> 02:27:46,060
networks.
I don't remember who they are.

3198
02:27:46,120 --> 02:27:50,000
Phi access the best of two,
four g lte network.

3199
02:27:50,001 --> 02:27:53,110
So you can connect to more towers and 
get fast speeds at more places.

3200
02:27:53,111 --> 02:27:55,420
I'm nearly positive that one of them is 
t mobile.

3201
02:27:55,780 --> 02:27:58,840
It doesn't say on here.
Why wouldn't not say that?

3202
02:27:58,841 --> 02:28:03,841
Seems crazy.
That might have a white paper somewhere 

3203
02:28:03,841 --> 02:28:03,841
on the internet to get.
You can get your hands on.

3204
02:28:03,841 --> 02:28:05,050
But listen,
this connected better wifi.

3205
02:28:05,051 --> 02:28:08,050
There are lots of wifi wifi hotspots out
there,

3206
02:28:08,860 --> 02:28:12,520
but not all of them are high quality.
Project fi automatically connects you to

3207
02:28:12,521 --> 02:28:14,950
more than a million free open wifi 
spots.

3208
02:28:14,951 --> 02:28:19,951
We verified for faster.
How does that affect you while you're 

3209
02:28:19,951 --> 02:28:22,390
walking around?
Is it really going to go from why spider

3210
02:28:22,410 --> 02:28:23,850
wife?
That sounds ridiculous.

3211
02:28:23,851 --> 02:28:26,180
They had a little graphic on here to 
kind of just shows it,

3212
02:28:26,181 --> 02:28:27,370
but I mean it's just graphics.
I don't.

3213
02:28:27,400 --> 02:28:29,780
It's not.
It's not real life application.

3214
02:28:29,800 --> 02:28:30,090
Right,
right,

3215
02:28:30,100 --> 02:28:35,100
right.
It's not giving you actual data 

3216
02:28:35,100 --> 02:28:35,100
experience.
Yeah.

3217
02:28:35,720 --> 02:28:39,410
Calls and text over wifi for more 
coverage.

3218
02:28:39,440 --> 02:28:41,330
Seed.
This sounds good in paper,

3219
02:28:41,331 --> 02:28:46,331
like maybe 10 years.
calls transition seamlessly from wifi 

3220
02:28:46,331 --> 02:28:46,370
and cell phone networks.
Tell it to people.

3221
02:28:46,510 --> 02:28:48,830
Their phone drops off left and right and
they're yelling at you.

3222
02:28:48,880 --> 02:28:51,750
I'm switching networks.
Going back to the mobile.

3223
02:28:51,800 --> 02:28:53,330
The movement of a nightmare,
but I don't know.

3224
02:28:53,331 --> 02:28:54,080
I mean,
again,

3225
02:28:54,081 --> 02:28:55,070
this is kind of,
to me,

3226
02:28:55,071 --> 02:28:57,590
this is kind of along the lines of that 
modular phone.

3227
02:28:57,591 --> 02:28:58,550
It's like,
I like it.

3228
02:28:58,670 --> 02:29:01,950
It speaks to me in some way at least 
this idea of,

3229
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:07,320
of innovating in this space,
but that doesn't necessarily mean it's 

3230
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:07,320
all the way.

3231
02:29:07,320 --> 02:29:11,470
There was jamie cv you can find instead 
of this commercial cartoon,

3232
02:29:11,841 --> 02:29:16,190
they're showing us actual data of what 
networks they're using and how it works.

3233
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:17,360
Probably can.
YeaH.

3234
02:29:17,390 --> 02:29:19,640
Because chris ryan,
dr chris ryan,

3235
02:29:19,670 --> 02:29:24,670
the guy wrote sex at dawn.
He was the one who first told me about 

3236
02:29:24,670 --> 02:29:24,670
it and that's why he bought the phone 
and he's like,

3237
02:29:24,670 --> 02:29:28,901
I love it because everywhere I go he 
just finds the best service and I was 

3238
02:29:28,901 --> 02:29:28,901
like,
oh,

3239
02:29:28,901 --> 02:29:31,320
okay.
That sounds like a great idea if it's in

3240
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,650
paper who,
who's a partner,

3241
02:29:33,830 --> 02:29:38,330
sprint t mobile carriers in the us to 
launch our service.

3242
02:29:38,540 --> 02:29:39,590
But you know what man,
that's.

3243
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:40,820
So,
that's exactly what.

3244
02:29:41,100 --> 02:29:42,540
That's what tim does.
Yeah.

3245
02:29:42,750 --> 02:29:44,480
Ten years.
Uses sprint t mobile as well.

3246
02:29:44,481 --> 02:29:48,080
They use a t mobile for gsm and sprint 
for cdma.

3247
02:29:48,440 --> 02:29:52,030
And so you would get the same coverage 
that you get with t mobile or with um,

3248
02:29:52,190 --> 02:29:52,760
with ting.

3249
02:29:53,060 --> 02:29:55,220
But with ting yOu only pay for what you 
use.

3250
02:29:55,221 --> 02:29:57,580
Like ting has a great deal where,
you know,

3251
02:29:57,590 --> 02:29:59,000
if,
if you barely use it,

3252
02:29:59,001 --> 02:30:01,580
like I barely used my phone before and 
I've got a $10 bill.

3253
02:30:01,710 --> 02:30:02,370
Yeah.
You know,

3254
02:30:02,450 --> 02:30:05,720
the one thing that they have there is 
that wifi transition thing.

3255
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:07,680
Maybe you're using less data.
I don't know where,

3256
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:09,980
where you have to log into wifi 
networks.

3257
02:30:09,981 --> 02:30:11,990
That's what I don't understand.
How could that be verified?

3258
02:30:12,020 --> 02:30:14,660
I know and they're like reliable.
I don't know about that mean,

3259
02:30:14,810 --> 02:30:19,810
but this idea of free why spot wifi 
hotspot if you go to starbucks and use 

3260
02:30:19,810 --> 02:30:24,581
their hotspot or just coffee bean,
you have to log in so you're going to 

3261
02:30:24,581 --> 02:30:28,840
have to pre log in to all these places 
unless they have some kind of clearance 

3262
02:30:28,840 --> 02:30:31,910
maybe where those numbers could somehow 
have access.

3263
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:32,940
I'm not 100 percent sure.

3264
02:30:33,250 --> 02:30:34,820
That sounds fishy.
I'm not,

3265
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:36,620
I'm not 100 percent sure how that works,
but,

3266
02:30:36,650 --> 02:30:39,650
but wifi calling and what night is cool 
because generally speaking,

3267
02:30:39,680 --> 02:30:41,900
even in your own places like the places 
you frequent,

3268
02:30:41,901 --> 02:30:43,670
like your office and your house and 
such.

3269
02:30:43,730 --> 02:30:46,400
I have laughed calling on my phone and 
exactly.

3270
02:30:46,430 --> 02:30:47,630
It's amazing.
high quality.

3271
02:30:47,631 --> 02:30:52,631
You have a great connection.
So it does make sense in theory the way 

3272
02:30:52,631 --> 02:30:54,230
they were showing it on that graphic is 
probably overstating it,

3273
02:30:54,430 --> 02:30:55,090
right?
Yeah.

3274
02:30:55,260 --> 02:30:56,450
Yeah.
But anyway,

3275
02:30:56,451 --> 02:30:57,320
so,
so,

3276
02:30:57,321 --> 02:30:59,090
so in,
in the android space,

3277
02:30:59,091 --> 02:31:04,091
I think it's pretty easy.
I think right now for me it would be 

3278
02:31:04,091 --> 02:31:06,200
probably an s seven or the nexus six p 
keys in my pocket,

3279
02:31:06,230 --> 02:31:07,580
which I like.
Can I see that?

3280
02:31:07,640 --> 02:31:09,690
Yeah.
Pull up this,

3281
02:31:09,790 --> 02:31:11,240
um,
this again,

3282
02:31:11,350 --> 02:31:16,350
what you're seeing a lot of now you're 
seeing the fingerprint scanner being 

3283
02:31:16,350 --> 02:31:19,630
moved to the back of the device,
so you could just do it as you're 

3284
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:19,630
holding it,
so.

3285
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:19,630
Yeah,
exactly.

3286
02:31:19,630 --> 02:31:20,040
You'll notice it sort

3287
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:21,180
of fits in there.
Wow.

3288
02:31:21,210 --> 02:31:22,080
Yeah.
That's nice.

3289
02:31:22,170 --> 02:31:25,020
I like that.
That's actually really clean.

3290
02:31:25,080 --> 02:31:26,510
I've actually got a skin on it.
It's,

3291
02:31:26,690 --> 02:31:27,540
oh,
this is a skin.

3292
02:31:27,570 --> 02:31:28,050
Yeah.
Yeah.

3293
02:31:28,650 --> 02:31:30,870
It would look a little different.
It's a little more grippy like that.

3294
02:31:31,160 --> 02:31:32,190
I like it.
Yeah.

3295
02:31:32,250 --> 02:31:34,080
This is really thin and nice.
Yeah.

3296
02:31:34,500 --> 02:31:36,440
It's a 6:00
PM,

3297
02:31:36,750 --> 02:31:37,230
6:00
PM.

3298
02:31:37,231 --> 02:31:42,231
It's the bigger brother.
So the five x is pretty much identical 

3299
02:31:42,231 --> 02:31:45,500
to screens,
a little lower resolution on physical 

3300
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:45,500
buttons on the outside.
Just over here on the side.

3301
02:31:45,500 --> 02:31:45,500
Yeah.
But no,

3302
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:47,010
no,
they're all digital.

3303
02:31:48,180 --> 02:31:49,740
Well,
if you look at like an iphone,

3304
02:31:49,890 --> 02:31:54,890
that giant,
that giant home button increases the 

3305
02:31:54,890 --> 02:31:55,460
size of the bezel substantially.
Yeah.

3306
02:31:56,030 --> 02:31:57,780
Another thIng that,
that phone makers,

3307
02:31:57,781 --> 02:32:02,781
I think,
I don't remember if I talked about this 

3308
02:32:02,781 --> 02:32:02,781
before,
it's like forward facing speakers.

3309
02:32:02,781 --> 02:32:06,770
It's such a huge thing.
The fact that we don't have that on a 

3310
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:06,770
lot of devices yet.

3311
02:32:06,770 --> 02:32:07,760
Yeah.
The iphone has a little dinky speaker in

3312
02:32:07,761 --> 02:32:08,520
the bond,
the bottom.

3313
02:32:08,521 --> 02:32:11,550
It's kind of,
it's like from a design perspective,

3314
02:32:11,580 --> 02:32:14,550
you can't imagine ever doing a drawing 
where for any reason you do that,

3315
02:32:14,551 --> 02:32:19,551
unless it was an absolute necessity,
but the thing is a lot of filmmakers 

3316
02:32:19,551 --> 02:32:22,791
keep trying to slim down the devices.
It has to be thinner every single 

3317
02:32:22,791 --> 02:32:26,600
generation and so that usually means 
they're subtracting things rather than 

3318
02:32:26,600 --> 02:32:29,901
adding them,
which is a problem for people who were 

3319
02:32:29,901 --> 02:32:32,001
like super into tech,
like are you complaining about the 

3320
02:32:32,001 --> 02:32:34,761
thickness of that?
That could be a little bit thicker if 

3321
02:32:34,761 --> 02:32:34,761
you got better battery life.
Say a better camera,

3322
02:32:34,761 --> 02:32:34,761
right?
Yeah.

3323
02:32:34,761 --> 02:32:35,850
Do you need it to be that thin?
No,

3324
02:32:35,851 --> 02:32:37,560
I'm good with it the way it is.
I like it.

3325
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:38,820
Yeah.
Battery life is fun.

3326
02:32:38,990 --> 02:32:41,220
Like the six plus has a huge battery.

3327
02:32:41,310 --> 02:32:43,620
It was pretty pretty fucking get it has 
a huge battery.

3328
02:32:43,790 --> 02:32:45,870
Was actually okay with the six.
The six was okay.

3329
02:32:45,880 --> 02:32:47,130
The battery life was not bad.
It just.

3330
02:32:47,720 --> 02:32:50,520
I picked up one of these again and I was
like,

3331
02:32:50,580 --> 02:32:51,720
oh,
like the screen better?

3332
02:32:52,620 --> 02:32:53,310
Bigger screen?
Yeah.

3333
02:32:53,311 --> 02:32:58,311
Especially for like going on a website 
or something like that and reading 

3334
02:32:58,311 --> 02:32:58,311
emails.
The only argument,

3335
02:32:58,311 --> 02:33:01,440
the real argument against the big screen
is one handed use.

3336
02:33:01,590 --> 02:33:02,490
Right?
So you're.

3337
02:33:02,491 --> 02:33:04,150
If you're a person who takes public 
transit,

3338
02:33:04,151 --> 02:33:07,800
you're on the subway and they got a 
coffee in one hand and then you can make

3339
02:33:07,801 --> 02:33:09,780
the argument that like any of these 
giant phones,

3340
02:33:09,781 --> 02:33:11,730
it's difficult to interact with them one
handed.

3341
02:33:11,790 --> 02:33:13,950
Well then the argument is the new 
iphone,

3342
02:33:13,980 --> 02:33:16,660
the one that they've come out with it 
the old four inch.

3343
02:33:16,960 --> 02:33:19,230
Yeah.
That sucker fits right in your hand.

3344
02:33:19,650 --> 02:33:20,230
It's timeless.

3345
02:33:20,950 --> 02:33:23,280
It's so easy to text one handed with.
Oh yeah,

3346
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:24,630
definitely.
I kind of,

3347
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:28,560
I was kind of lukewarm about it just 
because it's like going backwards.

3348
02:33:28,770 --> 02:33:30,480
It's like what do we,
you know,

3349
02:33:30,600 --> 02:33:35,600
this stuff I get excited about is,
is the innovation and the sort of the 

3350
02:33:35,640 --> 02:33:38,100
people behind it,
the research development and such.

3351
02:33:38,101 --> 02:33:41,880
And it's like anytime you see a company 
kind of going back,

3352
02:33:41,910 --> 02:33:43,680
but then again,
I thought about it when I made that,

3353
02:33:43,710 --> 02:33:45,090
when I made a video about it,
it's like,

3354
02:33:45,120 --> 02:33:48,480
well if you drive a porsche,
they don't look all that different.

3355
02:33:48,520 --> 02:33:49,320
Like,
well not only that,

3356
02:33:49,321 --> 02:33:53,160
a porsche small suv it give you invented
of suv and you're like,

3357
02:33:53,161 --> 02:33:55,980
I don't want to drive an suv.
I want a little shapes around.

3358
02:33:56,030 --> 02:33:56,330
Yeah,
yeah,

3359
02:33:56,340 --> 02:33:57,580
yeah.
That's kinda what that phone is.

3360
02:33:57,581 --> 02:33:59,490
It's like a little sports.
Yeah.

3361
02:33:59,491 --> 02:33:59,950
You could make.

3362
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:01,170
Yeah,
because it's fast.

3363
02:34:01,350 --> 02:34:03,060
It's fast.
They upGraded the camera.

3364
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:04,320
I just,
yeah.

3365
02:34:04,350 --> 02:34:07,590
I feel like I feel like we could've seen
a new design.

3366
02:34:07,591 --> 02:34:08,700
That's all.
It would have been interesting.

3367
02:34:08,701 --> 02:34:13,701
They've had a lot of time to figure out 
what they wanted to do with a smaller 

3368
02:34:13,701 --> 02:34:14,130
phone,
but the edgy of that old phone,

3369
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,320
super grid,
big grips.

3370
02:34:15,580 --> 02:34:20,580
It's got us a angular sort of edge.
That one right in your hand.

3371
02:34:20,651 --> 02:34:22,990
One of the slippery as phones is.
Exactly.

3372
02:34:23,230 --> 02:34:24,400
Well,
that's why I like this scan.

3373
02:34:24,401 --> 02:34:29,401
I gOt the skin.
It's got texture on the outside and it 

3374
02:34:29,401 --> 02:34:29,401
would.
Yeah,

3375
02:34:29,401 --> 02:34:29,401
you're,
you're,

3376
02:34:29,401 --> 02:34:29,401
you're gripping.
Yeah.

3377
02:34:29,401 --> 02:34:31,720
Yeah.
So the issue with the Next iphone,

3378
02:34:31,721 --> 02:34:33,100
this is what I'm going to ask you,
joe.

3379
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:38,400
There's a rumors.
They're probably beyond rumors that 

3380
02:34:38,400 --> 02:34:38,680
they're going to give up the headphone 
jack.

3381
02:34:39,310 --> 02:34:40,450
Yeah,
that's gross.

3382
02:34:40,720 --> 02:34:41,670
You're not happy about.
No,

3383
02:34:41,860 --> 02:34:42,730
I think that's gross.

3384
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:43,780
Uh,
cut the shit.

3385
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:45,430
What if you're going to get improved 
audio,

3386
02:34:45,940 --> 02:34:47,610
how much improved?
What are you doing?

3387
02:34:47,640 --> 02:34:52,640
You just making things proprietary,
like they're trying to sell a fuck ton 

3388
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:53,180
of beats.
Headphones when they're trying to do.

3389
02:34:54,160 --> 02:34:59,160
And then also the problem with that is,
are you gonna be able to charge it at 

3390
02:34:59,160 --> 02:35:00,020
the same time as listening to music?
Is it gonna be one of the little things.

3391
02:35:00,021 --> 02:35:02,470
So here's the thing,
I had an idea,

3392
02:35:04,510 --> 02:35:05,980
I'm just gonna put it out there because 
I'm not going to do it.

3393
02:35:05,981 --> 02:35:10,150
I'm too fucking busy,
but like up for a set of headphones that

3394
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:15,160
use that port that actually have a 
battery that charge your phone while 

3395
02:35:15,160 --> 02:35:18,451
you're listening because you know,
a lot of people carry around backup 

3396
02:35:18,451 --> 02:35:18,451
batteries.
Anyone?

3397
02:35:18,451 --> 02:35:18,640
Yeah,
anyone that's not a bad idea.

3398
02:35:18,670 --> 02:35:20,530
I'm not going to makE it.
Like I said,

3399
02:35:20,531 --> 02:35:22,540
I'm totally a bad idea,
but anyway,

3400
02:35:22,541 --> 02:35:27,541
the point being is it's not universal,
so you couldn't just be over at your 

3401
02:35:27,541 --> 02:35:27,541
friends and grab it.

3402
02:35:27,541 --> 02:35:32,350
Any pair of headphones,
all this stuff you may be already 

3403
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:32,350
invested in.
A lot of people have invested a lot into

3404
02:35:32,350 --> 02:35:37,201
audio.
Everything fits with this three point 

3405
02:35:37,201 --> 02:35:39,220
five millimeter universal jack and it's 
been that way for god.

3406
02:35:39,640 --> 02:35:41,200
Fifty years,
more,

3407
02:35:41,620 --> 02:35:46,620
more than 50 years.
It used to be a quarter inch jack like 

3408
02:35:46,620 --> 02:35:47,260
this stuff here,
which could be adapted,

3409
02:35:47,261 --> 02:35:52,261
but essentially it's been that analog 
connection for as long as there's been 

3410
02:35:52,261 --> 02:35:52,270
audio equipment,
so this is a big move.

3411
02:35:52,300 --> 02:35:57,300
If the leader in the marketplace gives 
up on that and goes with the strictly 

3412
02:35:57,300 --> 02:36:01,171
digital connection,
you can expect all the other people to 

3413
02:36:01,171 --> 02:36:01,960
follow suit because apple just has that 
kind of pull.

3414
02:36:02,020 --> 02:36:07,020
well,
they were the first ones to abandon the 

3415
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:07,020
floppy disk.
Remember that,

3416
02:36:07,020 --> 02:36:08,120
and then they abandon everything.
Yeah,

3417
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:10,600
I mean the new ones,
this new laptops,

3418
02:36:10,601 --> 02:36:12,250
they don't even have a usb.

3419
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:17,580
They just have the see usbc port to 
provide power to interface with it.

3420
02:36:20,960 --> 02:36:25,960
It should really should have to.
Most of the pc manufacturers with 

3421
02:36:25,960 --> 02:36:28,480
competitive products to that mac book 
have to usbc ports.

3422
02:36:28,570 --> 02:36:33,570
Yeah.
Do you think that they're trying to 

3423
02:36:33,570 --> 02:36:35,461
establish the cloud?
Is it to try to encourage people to 

3424
02:36:35,461 --> 02:36:37,300
upload data to the cloud?
And part of it,

3425
02:36:37,420 --> 02:36:42,420
that's part of it,
but honestly not to be too pessimistic 

3426
02:36:42,420 --> 02:36:46,891
about it,
but apple does have a history of this 

3427
02:36:46,891 --> 02:36:50,071
sort of planned obsolescence and I,
I fully believe that at least with the 

3428
02:36:51,011 --> 02:36:56,011
next generation,
a lot of people were hoping it would be 

3429
02:36:56,011 --> 02:36:58,231
this generation.
You'll just see that second port and 

3430
02:36:58,231 --> 02:36:59,020
they'll go now wIth two boards and 
everybody runs the lineup for it,

3431
02:36:59,021 --> 02:37:00,850
you know.
But anyway,

3432
02:37:00,910 --> 02:37:02,050
um,
the two,

3433
02:37:02,110 --> 02:37:07,110
the most controversial thing on the next
version is certainly going to be this 

3434
02:37:07,110 --> 02:37:10,501
idea of giving up the headphone jack.
Is that confirmed is pretty fucking 

3435
02:37:10,501 --> 02:37:15,061
close question about that.
Wouldn't they still be able to let that 

3436
02:37:15,061 --> 02:37:16,220
little port the to have headphones that 
plug into the charging

3437
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:18,950
port in a day in adapter?
Humans are new headphones.

3438
02:37:18,951 --> 02:37:23,951
Everyone has to go by,
but that doesn't completely kill 

3439
02:37:23,951 --> 02:37:23,951
headphones,
right?

3440
02:37:23,951 --> 02:37:23,951
yeah.
Oh yeah.

3441
02:37:23,951 --> 02:37:24,260
They could totally

3442
02:37:24,370 --> 02:37:24,910
sticking,
adapt,

3443
02:37:24,970 --> 02:37:29,970
but then you'd have to have some new 
thIng in your pocket that you'd hold 

3444
02:37:29,970 --> 02:37:29,970
onto

3445
02:37:29,970 --> 02:37:34,650
and have to be an adaptive,
but they could put out just like they 

3446
02:37:34,650 --> 02:37:36,661
put on ear buds with every iphone.
They could just give you new ones that 

3447
02:37:36,661 --> 02:37:36,730
plug.
Oh yeah,

3448
02:37:36,731 --> 02:37:38,470
no doubt.
No doubt.

3449
02:37:38,530 --> 02:37:43,530
Right,
but the problem is you wouldn't be able 

3450
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:43,530
to charge it at the same time.
You would have to have one or the other.

3451
02:37:43,530 --> 02:37:48,270
I'm saying that wouldn't be wireless.
ThE new ones they give you wouldn't be 

3452
02:37:48,270 --> 02:37:48,520
plugged into the port we charged into 
now.

3453
02:37:48,640 --> 02:37:53,640
Right.
That's what I'm saying is the exact 

3454
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:53,640
charge.
And can I get you on that?

3455
02:37:53,640 --> 02:37:53,920
Yeah.
Yeah.

3456
02:37:53,921 --> 02:37:56,830
I know there's going to be some drawback
and people are gonna lose their shit and

3457
02:37:56,831 --> 02:37:58,480
then everybody's going to buy the 
fucking iphone.

3458
02:37:58,760 --> 02:38:03,760
Well,
it's so convenient that it works so 

3459
02:38:03,760 --> 02:38:06,701
seamlessly with your laptop and max do 
make the best operating system for home 

3460
02:38:06,701 --> 02:38:07,760
computers.
In my opinion.

3461
02:38:07,761 --> 02:38:12,761
You know what?
We're going to try some window shit out 

3462
02:38:12,761 --> 02:38:12,761
because razor is gonna.
Send us.

3463
02:38:12,761 --> 02:38:16,781
I heard about this laptop.
Am I invited to this party or what I 

3464
02:38:17,530 --> 02:38:20,130
getting on the doom party?
We're going to have a doom loop.

3465
02:38:20,290 --> 02:38:23,240
You know what you're getting into here 
and what went well?

3466
02:38:23,260 --> 02:38:25,490
I don't know.
I mean how elaborate will this thing be?

3467
02:38:25,491 --> 02:38:27,560
What kind of systems are you getting?
What's happening?

3468
02:38:27,590 --> 02:38:30,740
We're probably going to use razors.
Laptop systems.

3469
02:38:30,741 --> 02:38:34,350
They have gaming laptops that are pretty
fucking financial definitely.

3470
02:38:34,351 --> 02:38:39,351
And so the razor blade,
I actually was one of the razor 

3471
02:38:39,351 --> 02:38:43,280
developers like early back in the day,
in the nineties.

3472
02:38:43,310 --> 02:38:45,250
Excuse me,
I was the one,

3473
02:38:45,270 --> 02:38:47,090
one of the guys who helped them with 
their mice.

3474
02:38:47,600 --> 02:38:52,600
Get out of town.
You know how much credit you're getting 

3475
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:52,600
right now.
Your original raiser guy,

3476
02:38:52,600 --> 02:38:56,950
robert krakoff was a friend of mine and 
he was trying to figure it out.

3477
02:38:57,321 --> 02:38:59,270
I met him,
I think at e three.

3478
02:38:59,610 --> 02:39:01,610
Think I met him there.
I forgot where I met him,

3479
02:39:01,880 --> 02:39:02,450
but uh,
you know,

3480
02:39:02,451 --> 02:39:04,310
I was friends with like the software 
guys,

3481
02:39:04,311 --> 02:39:09,311
like way back in the day I met john 
carmack way back during quake too when 

3482
02:39:09,311 --> 02:39:10,100
they were developing quake three.
I got to play quake three,

3483
02:39:10,101 --> 02:39:13,400
like the early developer model.
You would deep man that was deep.

3484
02:39:13,730 --> 02:39:16,550
They had their original.
The razer mamba,

3485
02:39:16,551 --> 02:39:21,551
the original.
I know that my sensitivity house and 

3486
02:39:21,551 --> 02:39:25,300
ergonomically people didn't like it.
They love the fact that it was like a 

3487
02:39:25,300 --> 02:39:28,870
really super sensitive module inside of 
it that would the sensor that would pick

3488
02:39:29,691 --> 02:39:31,660
up the movement and it was super 
sensitive and high,

3489
02:39:31,820 --> 02:39:34,730
high dpi,
but we didn't like the ergonomics.

3490
02:39:34,760 --> 02:39:36,980
THe shape didn't seem right.
what was wrong with the shape?

3491
02:39:36,981 --> 02:39:38,750
Too flat.
It was a really weird shape.

3492
02:39:38,751 --> 02:39:42,620
I had like a hump in the back then it,
it leaned forward to a flat front,

3493
02:39:42,621 --> 02:39:45,200
like a duck's foot.
It was real weird.

3494
02:39:45,350 --> 02:39:47,960
Do you remember the early shane?
I'm trying to remember it right now.

3495
02:39:47,961 --> 02:39:52,961
I don't.
I don't think I can pinpoint that in my 

3496
02:39:52,961 --> 02:39:52,961
head.
Well,

3497
02:39:52,961 --> 02:39:55,211
obviously people have different shaped 
and sized and also some people employ 

3498
02:39:55,211 --> 02:39:55,730
the claw.
Yes.

3499
02:39:55,731 --> 02:39:57,950
They have a different grip and that's 
how you would,

3500
02:39:58,130 --> 02:40:00,310
I guess you'd want a different shape 
depending on the grip,

3501
02:40:00,480 --> 02:40:02,480
but there's a lot of the,
there's a lot of variables,

3502
02:40:02,481 --> 02:40:04,400
right?
One of the variables is do you rest your

3503
02:40:04,401 --> 02:40:09,401
arm,
the rest your arm or you were hover and 

3504
02:40:09,401 --> 02:40:11,960
you guys go with high sensitivity or you
do low sensitive and quick movements and

3505
02:40:11,961 --> 02:40:13,340
do you use,
um,

3506
02:40:13,410 --> 02:40:15,390
do you use a mouse sampling?

3507
02:40:15,660 --> 02:40:16,230
Like,
you know,

3508
02:40:16,231 --> 02:40:19,140
there's,
there's like a mouse acceleration.

3509
02:40:19,141 --> 02:40:19,910
Do you know what that is?
Yeah,

3510
02:40:19,930 --> 02:40:21,780
of course.
So like if you move quicker,

3511
02:40:21,810 --> 02:40:24,390
the mouse actually moves quicker than 
that.

3512
02:40:24,391 --> 02:40:25,200
It like,
it,

3513
02:40:25,230 --> 02:40:30,230
it works on some sort of like a 
gyroscope or that's probably not the 

3514
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:31,170
right word,
but like excelorometer accelerometer.

3515
02:40:31,290 --> 02:40:35,280
Whereas if you move quicker,
it actually covers distance quicker than

3516
02:40:35,281 --> 02:40:36,270
your movement.
It,

3517
02:40:36,530 --> 02:40:40,470
it helps you move quicker and then we're
in find slower movements.

3518
02:40:40,471 --> 02:40:42,390
It slows down.
Some people like that,

3519
02:40:42,570 --> 02:40:45,930
some people don't like that ending on a 
game depending on how you play.

3520
02:40:46,270 --> 02:40:49,020
But for me it was first person shooters,
so,

3521
02:40:49,100 --> 02:40:50,780
um,
me and um,

3522
02:40:51,330 --> 02:40:56,330
my friend lou morton who is a hardcore 
gamer is one of the writers for news 

3523
02:40:56,330 --> 02:40:59,340
radio and a bunch of friends that were 
in my clan at the time.

3524
02:40:59,580 --> 02:41:04,580
We got together with the razor guy and 
we had a land party and we all 

3525
02:41:05,611 --> 02:41:10,611
discussed,
we brought in a bunch of different 

3526
02:41:10,611 --> 02:41:12,021
shaped mouse mice and we all showed 
which mouse we used and why we used it.

3527
02:41:12,750 --> 02:41:16,250
And I believe at the time I was using a 
microsoft mouse and uh,

3528
02:41:16,270 --> 02:41:18,510
I really liked laser mice because they 
were,

3529
02:41:18,540 --> 02:41:20,160
there were,
back then they were,

3530
02:41:21,180 --> 02:41:24,630
they were not quite good enough for a 
pre games.

3531
02:41:24,631 --> 02:41:26,580
There were a little awkward.
They weren't a sensitive.

3532
02:41:26,590 --> 02:41:27,750
They would,
they would miss things,

3533
02:41:27,751 --> 02:41:32,220
but they wouldn't require cleaning.
And the ball mice required clean not.

3534
02:41:32,221 --> 02:41:32,850
Yeah.
Right.

3535
02:41:32,851 --> 02:41:35,790
And so we all had these different ones 
that we would would use.

3536
02:41:35,791 --> 02:41:40,791
And so they compiled all of our 
suggestions and then created their next 

3537
02:41:40,791 --> 02:41:42,330
generation mice.
So this isn't a nine days.

3538
02:41:42,420 --> 02:41:46,610
So I was like one of the early guys that
help them with a shape.

3539
02:41:47,140 --> 02:41:51,060
So imagine all the kids out there right 
now with a razor mouse.

3540
02:41:51,840 --> 02:41:56,840
I was just one of them.
There's a lot of people don't get 

3541
02:41:56,840 --> 02:41:56,840
carried away.
Yeah,

3542
02:41:56,840 --> 02:42:00,560
I wouldn't.
I wouldn't do that because it was a 

3543
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:01,590
gaming mouse that one of the logitech 
logic tac had the best shape.

3544
02:42:01,620 --> 02:42:03,960
I love logitech mouse.
I use one right now.

3545
02:42:03,961 --> 02:42:05,010
I use the,
uh,

3546
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:08,760
what is it called?
The performance mx love.

3547
02:42:08,761 --> 02:42:13,761
It wouldn't use anything else,
but they had one that was specifically 

3548
02:42:13,761 --> 02:42:14,520
designed for gaming and it only had 
three buttons,

3549
02:42:14,670 --> 02:42:19,670
but the shape of it,
the logitech gaming mouse just fit 

3550
02:42:19,670 --> 02:42:20,400
perfectly.
The 5:18.

3551
02:42:21,120 --> 02:42:24,210
That was a super popular gaming mouse 
back in the day but could be.

3552
02:42:24,211 --> 02:42:26,430
I mean they just called it the logitech 
gaming mouse.

3553
02:42:26,760 --> 02:42:28,800
Yeah.
It was mostly a gray mouse.

3554
02:42:28,890 --> 02:42:33,890
Didn't have any buttons.
Three buttons might be earlier than I'm 

3555
02:42:33,890 --> 02:42:34,410
thinking.
It was kind of crude and primitive,

3556
02:42:34,411 --> 02:42:39,411
but people really loved It because it 
was set these buttons for different 

3557
02:42:39,601 --> 02:42:44,601
things.
Like some of them would set one of the 

3558
02:42:44,601 --> 02:42:44,601
buttons for a jump.
Some of them would set one of the.

3559
02:42:44,601 --> 02:42:44,640
By the way,
I would have it,

3560
02:42:44,670 --> 02:42:46,740
I would have the index finger would be 
my trigger.

3561
02:42:46,860 --> 02:42:48,540
That's how I would shoot the middle 
button,

3562
02:42:48,541 --> 02:42:51,840
would be a rail gun and the far left 
button would be a rocket launcher,

3563
02:42:51,990 --> 02:42:54,150
so if I wanted a rocket launcher or I'd 
hit that far button,

3564
02:42:54,151 --> 02:42:59,151
who would come to me instantly and I 
could shoot it and then the rail gun 

3565
02:42:59,151 --> 02:43:01,170
would be the one that I would count on 
for like a long range sniper shot and so

3566
02:43:01,171 --> 02:43:04,230
you have all your keys.
Keys would be in fronT of uwa,

3567
02:43:04,231 --> 02:43:08,340
s and d for movement and then various 
weapon keys which are really close,

3568
02:43:08,341 --> 02:43:11,130
like lightning gun was up here,
a c you would hit that,

3569
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:12,130
this and that for that

3570
02:43:12,310 --> 02:43:14,260
and you would configure it based on what
you would like.

3571
02:43:14,740 --> 02:43:15,880
And so there was.
Yeah,

3572
02:43:16,010 --> 02:43:18,070
that was one,
but that was not the one.

3573
02:43:18,170 --> 02:43:20,660
This is a,
this is probably right,

3574
02:43:20,810 --> 02:43:23,420
but it's a fun one from the 90th.
But yeah,

3575
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:25,690
no need but pretty.
That's pretty dope.

3576
02:43:25,720 --> 02:43:27,100
That one right there,
the.

3577
02:43:27,440 --> 02:43:31,240
They have tons of buttons now.
Like the performance mice now they could

3578
02:43:31,241 --> 02:43:36,241
have it.
Nevermind the ones for those massive 

3579
02:43:36,241 --> 02:43:36,700
multiplaYer games.
Yeah,

3580
02:43:36,790 --> 02:43:39,360
those guys are crazy.
Those mice can have like 30,

3581
02:43:39,390 --> 02:43:42,280
40 buttons on it to trigger certain 
behaviors.

3582
02:43:42,281 --> 02:43:44,230
I don't know.
I'm not an expert in that space.

3583
02:43:44,260 --> 02:43:47,590
Those game scare.
The shit out of me really is massive.

3584
02:43:47,591 --> 02:43:50,140
Multiplayer games are the ones that just
suck your life on.

3585
02:43:50,200 --> 02:43:50,990
Oh yeah.
Those.

3586
02:43:50,991 --> 02:43:53,020
Those people would just vanished from 
the world.

3587
02:43:53,230 --> 02:43:58,230
You know what is going to happen with 
those people when they get a little 

3588
02:43:58,230 --> 02:43:59,320
something like this to this box that we 
have in front of us.

3589
02:43:59,710 --> 02:44:03,830
Louis and I were playing with this 
before the show and we had the gentleman

3590
02:44:03,860 --> 02:44:05,730
in that helped work with it.
yeah.

3591
02:44:05,740 --> 02:44:10,210
Let me give them a shout out.
This master of shapes on twitter.

3592
02:44:10,211 --> 02:44:11,020
These,
these guys,

3593
02:44:11,021 --> 02:44:16,021
they create mostly vr experiences,
but this headset here is actually an ar 

3594
02:44:17,591 --> 02:44:21,190
headset and you may have heard of it.
It's caLled the microsoft hollow lens.

3595
02:44:21,550 --> 02:44:25,030
Essentially you've got a lens in front 
of you in a fairly narrow field of view,

3596
02:44:25,031 --> 02:44:30,031
but what ends up happening is you have 
this digital representation that's 

3597
02:44:30,031 --> 02:44:32,920
overlaid on your own physical space.
That's how I would describe it.

3598
02:44:32,990 --> 02:44:34,030
You tried it out,
joe,

3599
02:44:34,031 --> 02:44:34,790
why don't you,
uh,

3600
02:44:34,840 --> 02:44:36,290
give us some feedback?
Well,

3601
02:44:36,640 --> 02:44:39,120
right now it's kind of crude.
Um,

3602
02:44:39,220 --> 02:44:44,220
there's some holes in it and these are 
just developer kit so it's not meant to 

3603
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:46,240
be a polished consumer product,
but it's pretty,

3604
02:44:46,810 --> 02:44:51,810
it's pretty revealing as far as what the
potential is and we're in for a wild 

3605
02:44:52,631 --> 02:44:54,280
ride in the next 20 years.

3606
02:44:55,090 --> 02:45:00,090
What we're Seeing with this is a kind of
a crude version of virtual reality in a 

3607
02:45:02,021 --> 02:45:04,130
video game where things are coming at 
you,

3608
02:45:04,450 --> 02:45:05,560
but you know,
they're bullshit.

3609
02:45:06,430 --> 02:45:07,910
They don't look real,
you know,

3610
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,720
you're pressing a clicker.
You can shoot them out of the air.

3611
02:45:10,840 --> 02:45:13,390
It's kind of fun.
My interest in gaming perspective,

3612
02:45:13,391 --> 02:45:18,391
I still think uh,
the vr experiences are a lot more 

3613
02:45:18,391 --> 02:45:22,201
immersive than,
than something like this where you can 

3614
02:45:22,201 --> 02:45:22,201
still see your surroundings.
Exactly.

3615
02:45:22,201 --> 02:45:24,050
When you put the headset on and 
everything is gone and you're doing like

3616
02:45:24,070 --> 02:45:26,780
some zombie game or some shit.
And I was a.

3617
02:45:27,270 --> 02:45:32,270
So I was playing with the htc vive 
recently that most people are saying 

3618
02:45:32,270 --> 02:45:33,610
that's the one to get for vr headsets.
Really?

3619
02:45:33,880 --> 02:45:35,230
Yeah.
Over oculus rift.

3620
02:45:35,260 --> 02:45:37,330
Yeah.
Just the way the tracking is done.

3621
02:45:37,360 --> 02:45:39,160
It's,
it's a very smooth experience.

3622
02:45:39,161 --> 02:45:40,780
They've got controllers that come With 
it,

3623
02:45:41,650 --> 02:45:44,530
that map against the headset itself.
There were,

3624
02:45:44,580 --> 02:45:49,580
they're wireless.
You're still wired into huge gaming pc 

3625
02:45:49,580 --> 02:45:49,660
via your head,
but it's kind of cool.

3626
02:45:49,661 --> 02:45:54,661
Some of the demos I did have a,
they have these digital walls that you 

3627
02:45:54,661 --> 02:45:58,030
bump into so you know,
the sort of limits of where you can go.

3628
02:45:58,720 --> 02:46:01,480
But some people have done some really 
interesting things.

3629
02:46:01,640 --> 02:46:04,840
Um,
if you can bring up jamie into the void.

3630
02:46:05,110 --> 02:46:06,960
Have you seen this yet?
Okay.

3631
02:46:07,480 --> 02:46:09,710
Should I say anything or should we play 
the clip?

3632
02:46:09,900 --> 02:46:10,090
Okay.

3633
02:46:10,100 --> 02:46:12,510
Play the clip into the void.
Yeah.

3634
02:46:12,740 --> 02:46:17,740
I'm curious as to if someone is going to
develop something like those laser tag 

3635
02:46:17,740 --> 02:46:18,410
warehouses.
Oh my god.

3636
02:46:18,470 --> 02:46:20,930
How the fuck did you just nail it?
How did you just nail it?

3637
02:46:20,970 --> 02:46:25,970
That's what we're about to watch.
Somebody in salt lake city built this 

3638
02:46:25,970 --> 02:46:28,100
experience where you have this pack on 
which if you get shot,

3639
02:46:28,130 --> 02:46:30,770
it's like a.
It's like an actual physical.

3640
02:46:30,830 --> 02:46:32,720
I think we have talked about this 
before.

3641
02:46:32,780 --> 02:46:37,780
Did this come up?
I feel like this came up and one of the 

3642
02:46:37,780 --> 02:46:37,970
red band podcasts I'm looking for right 
now.

3643
02:46:38,830 --> 02:46:40,970
Or just void.
Something called the voice.

3644
02:46:40,990 --> 02:46:41,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

3645
02:46:41,520 --> 02:46:44,180
That might be it because if you can 
establish,

3646
02:46:44,210 --> 02:46:49,210
if you can get a place where you have 
this enormous warehouse space and then 

3647
02:46:49,210 --> 02:46:52,700
in that warehouse space you said it like
if you ever play paint ball.

3648
02:46:52,790 --> 02:46:54,980
Of course I played paintball wants in 
boston.

3649
02:46:54,981 --> 02:46:59,981
There's this place in linn that had 
these black lights and it was a 

3650
02:46:59,981 --> 02:47:02,351
warehouse you would run around.
There's boxes and those barriers and 

3651
02:47:02,351 --> 02:47:02,351
shit.
So here it is right here.

3652
02:47:02,351 --> 02:47:02,351
Okay,
here we go.

3653
02:47:02,900 --> 02:47:06,140
We're dream because we become reality.
Okay.

3654
02:47:06,141 --> 02:47:11,141
So this girl is walking around and 
there's actual walls and she turns the 

3655
02:47:11,141 --> 02:47:13,220
corner and she's in some fucking magical
land.

3656
02:47:14,660 --> 02:47:16,850
So the computer in this case is in the 
backpack.

3657
02:47:17,680 --> 02:47:20,240
So you're completely untethered.
oh my god.

3658
02:47:22,390 --> 02:47:26,780
And so they've constructed all this 
stuff,

3659
02:47:27,560 --> 02:47:32,560
unparalleled visuals and body tracking,
and so you're wearing a suit like an x 

3660
02:47:32,560 --> 02:47:35,840
men type uniform and it's got sensors on
it.

3661
02:47:35,960 --> 02:47:38,360
Virtual worlds built over physical 
environments.

3662
02:47:38,361 --> 02:47:41,090
I do believe we've talked about.
This looks a little familiar.

3663
02:47:41,091 --> 02:47:42,320
Yeah,
we're getting to this part of it.

3664
02:47:42,410 --> 02:47:44,600
I don't feel like it looked like.
No,

3665
02:47:44,750 --> 02:47:48,770
I feel like this dated version of what 
we've seen that I think they've actually

3666
02:47:48,771 --> 02:47:50,900
launched now.
I think you can actually go do it.

3667
02:47:50,960 --> 02:47:54,050
It's not just a concept for d 
environmental effects.

3668
02:47:54,051 --> 02:47:58,070
So you've got air that blows on you yet 
know to go along with what's happening.

3669
02:47:58,190 --> 02:47:59,090
Wow.
Water,

3670
02:47:59,091 --> 02:48:03,170
rain,
explore with and play against others.

3671
02:48:03,230 --> 02:48:08,230
Whoa.
So they wouldn't have to be mapped in 

3672
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:08,230
that physical space as well.
Well,

3673
02:48:08,230 --> 02:48:10,220
at least you're going to move around a 
little and get some exercise.

3674
02:48:11,010 --> 02:48:16,010
I kind of liked that.
I liked the idea of actually holding a 

3675
02:48:16,010 --> 02:48:17,660
physical gun and being have,
having to aim a physical gun.

3676
02:48:18,170 --> 02:48:20,180
Give me some hand eye coordination.
And by the way,

3677
02:48:20,181 --> 02:48:22,460
of course this is how they're going to 
train soldiers now.

3678
02:48:22,520 --> 02:48:23,570
Oh yeah.
Big time.

3679
02:48:24,020 --> 02:48:29,020
They're going to get people that are 
really good at doing it this way and 

3680
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:29,020
they're going to train them for the 
battlefield.

3681
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:29,930
This is wild man.
Oh,

3682
02:48:29,931 --> 02:48:31,420
jesus christ.
Doom.

3683
02:48:32,420 --> 02:48:37,420
Yeah.
You can imagine if when that thing 

3684
02:48:37,420 --> 02:48:38,831
grabbed hold of you and your vest is 
gripping you tighter and you're feeling 

3685
02:48:39,321 --> 02:48:44,321
the physical surroundings,
that's going to hijack our our sensory 

3686
02:48:44,321 --> 02:48:44,321
system.
Big time,

3687
02:48:44,321 --> 02:48:45,920
especially when it gets better and 
better.

3688
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:50,950
Whereas like it's more and more reactive
like you could feel it in very specific 

3689
02:48:51,231 --> 02:48:56,231
areas of your body.
If something grabs your shoulder from 

3690
02:48:56,231 --> 02:48:59,501
behind you turn it actually has his hand
on your shoulder and the thing is after,

3691
02:48:59,790 --> 02:49:04,790
you know,
people grow up with those kinds of 

3692
02:49:04,790 --> 02:49:04,790
experiences.
How the fuck are they going to go to the

3693
02:49:04,790 --> 02:49:04,810
movie theater and just sit there?
Then not.

3694
02:49:05,690 --> 02:49:07,230
Well,
the move is going to have to ramp it up.

3695
02:49:07,290 --> 02:49:08,070
That will be.

3696
02:49:08,070 --> 02:49:09,780
Yeah.
That'll be the equivalent of what it is.

3697
02:49:10,110 --> 02:49:11,660
Maybe disney,
maybe the neck,

3698
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:14,220
maybe some star wars down the road.
You'll be in it.

3699
02:49:14,490 --> 02:49:16,710
Well sometimes though,
you just want to go to the movies.

3700
02:49:16,711 --> 02:49:17,900
You know,
you want to go on a date,

3701
02:49:17,940 --> 02:49:19,890
eat some popcorn,
and sIt down and relax.

3702
02:49:20,940 --> 02:49:23,370
Although I think that,
I mean those experiences,

3703
02:49:23,371 --> 02:49:28,371
who knows,
who knows if the next generation will 

3704
02:49:28,371 --> 02:49:28,620
give a fuck about any of that.
They don't need a date.

3705
02:49:29,160 --> 02:49:31,710
They don't need the popcorn.
They don't even need a date.

3706
02:49:31,740 --> 02:49:33,630
No,
that's what I'm saying.

3707
02:49:33,631 --> 02:49:35,280
They got it all figured out,
man.

3708
02:49:35,281 --> 02:49:39,070
They don't need to leave the house.
what is our personality like?

3709
02:49:39,210 --> 02:49:40,830
The collective personality,
human beings,

3710
02:49:40,831 --> 02:49:45,000
how much is it going to be affected by 
robot sex slaves on hundred percent.

3711
02:49:45,420 --> 02:49:48,390
One hundred percent.
No one will compromise for anYthing.

3712
02:49:48,420 --> 02:49:49,200
We will.
We will.

3713
02:49:49,890 --> 02:49:52,140
We will be such ugly motherfuckers,
dude.

3714
02:49:52,800 --> 02:49:56,940
Or be like completely uneasy.
No,

3715
02:49:57,030 --> 02:49:58,980
not at all.
I do not think so.

3716
02:49:59,180 --> 02:49:59,800
well,
where are you?

3717
02:50:00,180 --> 02:50:02,000
You want to weigh in there?
We're getting real close.

3718
02:50:02,080 --> 02:50:07,080
demolition man.
I feel like all the things that are 

3719
02:50:07,080 --> 02:50:07,080
happening with that taco bell is going 
to become everyone's favorite meal.

3720
02:50:07,090 --> 02:50:10,870
We're going to have to be what it was in
the movie.

3721
02:50:10,890 --> 02:50:15,890
Oh,
three shells to wipe our Asses and no 

3722
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:15,890
one knows what that means.
StIll.

3723
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:15,890
And go ahead.

3724
02:50:15,890 --> 02:50:18,690
Yeah,
or the matrix or whatever scifi film you

3725
02:50:18,691 --> 02:50:23,691
choose,
but under ultimately I think we're just 

3726
02:50:23,691 --> 02:50:27,441
becoming.
We continued to have a smaller slice of 

3727
02:50:27,441 --> 02:50:30,630
the pizza and the digital realm,
the internet,

3728
02:50:30,720 --> 02:50:33,630
the data realm continues to have a 
bigger slice of the pizza,

3729
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:39,500
so as long as that continues in that 
kind of a direction we're going to,

3730
02:50:40,710 --> 02:50:45,710
we're going to become more and more 
passengers and less and less drivers 

3731
02:50:45,710 --> 02:50:49,020
know.
And of course that that's happening to 

3732
02:50:49,020 --> 02:50:51,980
look.
I'm sure you heard about the model 

3733
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:51,980
three.
Like they,

3734
02:50:51,980 --> 02:50:54,390
they moved so many fucking unit sight 
unseen.

3735
02:50:54,870 --> 02:50:57,600
Like can you imagine buying a car 
without seeing it?

3736
02:50:58,320 --> 02:51:01,530
These people teslas are so proven though
and it's elon musk.

3737
02:51:01,531 --> 02:51:04,380
He's like literAlly tony stark.
Exactly.

3738
02:51:04,470 --> 02:51:07,260
But all that stuff,
all that hype around it,

3739
02:51:07,760 --> 02:51:09,150
right?
It doesn't come easy.

3740
02:51:09,180 --> 02:51:11,550
It's all part of kind of a perspective.

3741
02:51:11,550 --> 02:51:14,220
They represent somethIng bigger.
Like in so many ways.

3742
02:51:14,460 --> 02:51:16,770
tech is like our god,
we worship it.

3743
02:51:16,910 --> 02:51:19,740
[inaudible] like this is evidence of 
that in my opinion.

3744
02:51:19,770 --> 02:51:21,480
If you're gonna buy something without 
seeing it,

3745
02:51:21,481 --> 02:51:25,590
that's the ultimate fucking cult,
the ultimate coercion,

3746
02:51:25,650 --> 02:51:29,040
but you're only buying it from an,
a massively proven brand,

3747
02:51:29,041 --> 02:51:30,600
100 percent,
100 percent.

3748
02:51:30,601 --> 02:51:35,601
But it's like,
do you have many people do that with 

3749
02:51:35,601 --> 02:51:35,601
porsche as well?
Listen at with iphones,

3750
02:51:35,601 --> 02:51:39,750
with porsche has a model are that's 
comIng out and it's actually very retro.

3751
02:51:40,080 --> 02:51:42,600
the porsche model,
our is so spoken for.

3752
02:51:42,601 --> 02:51:45,300
It's a nine slash 11 with a gt three 
engine,

3753
02:51:45,301 --> 02:51:48,860
but a six speed manual transmission and 
no,

3754
02:51:48,890 --> 02:51:53,100
uh,
none of the terminal.

3755
02:51:55,890 --> 02:52:00,890
What am I looking for?
A aerodynamic like spoilers and shit 

3756
02:52:01,051 --> 02:52:06,051
like that.
It looks like a regular nine slash 11 

3757
02:52:06,051 --> 02:52:08,210
and all the aerodynamics is sort of 
built into undercarriage of the car in 

3758
02:52:08,210 --> 02:52:11,401
order to keep it down at weight.
Interested in what they've done is made 

3759
02:52:11,401 --> 02:52:13,360
a very retro type experience.
what about our electronics?

3760
02:52:13,361 --> 02:52:14,230
Like,
well,

3761
02:52:14,231 --> 02:52:16,360
you could shut all that stuff off this 
car there.

3762
02:52:16,510 --> 02:52:21,510
There's so few of them that they're 
selling this car now for a million 

3763
02:52:21,510 --> 02:52:25,090
dollars.
This is a regular fucking nine slash 11 

3764
02:52:25,090 --> 02:52:27,790
that just has like retro capabilities 
and it's going for,

3765
02:52:27,791 --> 02:52:30,100
people are selling them sight unseen for
a million dollars,

3766
02:52:30,101 --> 02:52:35,101
but I understand it at the high end 
because at the high end this is not car 

3767
02:52:35,101 --> 02:52:35,440
number one for most people.
You know,

3768
02:52:35,470 --> 02:52:36,220
this is like,
yeah,

3769
02:52:36,221 --> 02:52:37,180
on a whim,
whatever.

3770
02:52:37,181 --> 02:52:39,400
I have some fucking money burning a hole
in my pocket.

3771
02:52:39,640 --> 02:52:41,950
In the case of the model three,
that's a $35,000

3772
02:52:41,951 --> 02:52:44,810
car and he wasn't that more 
understandable then.

3773
02:52:45,850 --> 02:52:47,560
How so?
Because there's less of a risk.

3774
02:52:47,561 --> 02:52:47,790
No,
no,

3775
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:49,390
no.
I'm talking about volume.

3776
02:52:49,720 --> 02:52:53,170
So I looked at their numbers and then 
went and referenced it against like what

3777
02:52:53,171 --> 02:52:54,340
about honda civic?
What about,

3778
02:52:54,341 --> 02:52:57,040
how significant is this number?
Like I'm sure porsche is only gonna.

3779
02:52:57,041 --> 02:52:58,750
Make 50 of those,
you know,

3780
02:52:58,751 --> 02:53:01,300
I don't know that many.
Many for north America.

3781
02:53:01,301 --> 02:53:03,670
Yeah.
so in those cases you understand it like

3782
02:53:03,671 --> 02:53:07,450
it's super exclusive and probably make 
like 911.

3783
02:53:07,510 --> 02:53:08,920
That's probably what they'll do.
Exactly.

3784
02:53:08,950 --> 02:53:13,120
And number one and number nine slash 11 
will be worth the most and whatever.

3785
02:53:13,150 --> 02:53:18,150
But in this case it was like,
like there's not as much as it can be 

3786
02:53:18,150 --> 02:53:19,630
learned from a sort of small experiments
like that,

3787
02:53:19,870 --> 02:53:21,580
but there's a lot more that can be 
learned from when you're,

3788
02:53:21,610 --> 02:53:25,120
when you're moving half a million cars 
because then it's like holy fuck,

3789
02:53:25,121 --> 02:53:26,770
this is now an industry trend.

3790
02:53:26,770 --> 02:53:31,770
ThIs is not like some outlier.
And so when I saw the numbers and I'm 

3791
02:53:31,770 --> 02:53:31,840
like,
holy shit,

3792
02:53:31,841 --> 02:53:34,510
like honda only sold this number of 
whatever last week.

3793
02:53:34,511 --> 02:53:39,511
Now we have this significant.
We kind of have proof of concept in a 

3794
02:53:39,511 --> 02:53:40,120
different way now.
Yeah,

3795
02:53:40,510 --> 02:53:45,510
I definitely agree with you there.
I think that the proven brand of tesla 

3796
02:53:45,550 --> 02:53:49,930
has gotten people so excited about what 
this guy's capable of with a smaller,

3797
02:53:50,140 --> 02:53:55,140
less expensive car that like the price 
of entry for like the model s or 

3798
02:53:55,391 --> 02:53:57,320
whatever it is,
expensive run 80,000.

3799
02:53:57,390 --> 02:53:58,200
A little too much.
Yeah.

3800
02:53:58,250 --> 02:54:03,250
So when you come around with $35,000
version of it and it looks pretty dope 

3801
02:54:03,250 --> 02:54:04,750
and it has that big laptop screen just 
like the other ones do.

3802
02:54:04,751 --> 02:54:06,700
Like people just jumped in.
Yeah.

3803
02:54:06,730 --> 02:54:07,690
Oh yeah.
One hundred percent.

3804
02:54:07,780 --> 02:54:11,200
but the part that brought me to tesla in
the first place was just the autonomy of

3805
02:54:11,201 --> 02:54:14,350
them [inaudible] they're completely 
capable right now of driving themselves.

3806
02:54:14,350 --> 02:54:15,970
They do.
I have a buddy who does it.

3807
02:54:15,971 --> 02:54:17,770
He gets on the highway and texts.
Oh yeah.

3808
02:54:17,771 --> 02:54:22,771
One hundred percent is drives and.
Well apparently the bmw seven series 

3809
02:54:22,771 --> 02:54:26,281
does the mercedes benz,
but they might want you to have your 

3810
02:54:26,281 --> 02:54:29,761
hand on the wheel.
It actually asks you to have your hand 

3811
02:54:29,761 --> 02:54:29,761
on the wheel.
To me.

3812
02:54:29,761 --> 02:54:30,880
Still a little bit of sentence.
I know.

3813
02:54:30,881 --> 02:54:35,881
See that's the thing is obviously 
there's gonna be some friction between 

3814
02:54:35,881 --> 02:54:39,211
where we're going and where we're at and
how much control we're willing to give 

3815
02:54:39,211 --> 02:54:39,940
to these two d systems.
But,

3816
02:54:39,941 --> 02:54:41,620
you know,
getting back to the pizza thing,

3817
02:54:41,770 --> 02:54:44,430
it's like that's a huge one if we're 
willing up to,

3818
02:54:44,550 --> 02:54:46,540
if we're willing to give up control of 
our vehicles,

3819
02:54:46,541 --> 02:54:51,541
I think we're also probably willing to 
give up control of a lot of other 

3820
02:54:51,541 --> 02:54:51,541
things.
And you know,

3821
02:54:51,541 --> 02:54:56,280
uh,
I'm not sure if we talked about this 

3822
02:54:56,280 --> 02:54:56,280
before,
but there was this really interesting.

3823
02:54:56,860 --> 02:55:01,860
Was it where did they,
I don't know if I read it or if it was 

3824
02:55:01,860 --> 02:55:02,980
on a podcast or how he was relating to 
facebook in the early days and how one,

3825
02:55:03,050 --> 02:55:08,050
the biggest issues they had with people 
getting tagged in photographs that 

3826
02:55:08,050 --> 02:55:09,740
didn't want to be tagged and so they had
a.

3827
02:55:10,040 --> 02:55:12,350
They did this kind of test where they 
were like,

3828
02:55:12,351 --> 02:55:13,640
well,
how the hell do we get?

3829
02:55:13,730 --> 02:55:16,250
Allow people to get taken off the 
photograph without having to go to their

3830
02:55:16,251 --> 02:55:21,251
friend and saying,
I don't want to be tagged in that 

3831
02:55:21,251 --> 02:55:21,251
photograph because that was an 
embarrassing thing to do.

3832
02:55:21,350 --> 02:55:26,350
Right?
And so what they did is they put in the 

3833
02:55:26,350 --> 02:55:27,650
stock answers like that you can send off
to your friend,

3834
02:55:27,651 --> 02:55:30,030
like select abc,
like I don't,

3835
02:55:30,430 --> 02:55:33,770
I don't want to be in that photo,
or I look stupid or whatever.

3836
02:55:34,070 --> 02:55:37,490
And the second that they made it a 
multiple choice way,

3837
02:55:37,491 --> 02:55:39,950
more people began,
began to use it because they didn't have

3838
02:55:39,951 --> 02:55:41,390
to come up with their own reason.

3839
02:55:42,170 --> 02:55:45,860
They felt like it was more accessible.
So humans are low friction,

3840
02:55:45,861 --> 02:55:49,940
like we're lazy as fuck.
And many times we get overwhelmed at the

3841
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:53,420
prospect of having to come up with our 
own,

3842
02:55:53,720 --> 02:55:58,720
I don't know,
our own method for dealing with the 

3843
02:55:58,720 --> 02:56:00,491
awkwardness of life.
So if you can imagine in the future if 

3844
02:56:00,491 --> 02:56:03,200
these things are phones and the systems 
we interact with,

3845
02:56:03,740 --> 02:56:08,480
get really smart at figuring out the 
correct responses for certain inquiries.

3846
02:56:08,690 --> 02:56:10,550
Let's say a girl texts you and she's 
like,

3847
02:56:10,551 --> 02:56:12,770
hey man,
meet me at 8:00

3848
02:56:12,770 --> 02:56:15,320
PM or call me later.
What if your phone knows better than you

3849
02:56:15,321 --> 02:56:18,440
are than you do at what the correct 
response is?

3850
02:56:18,441 --> 02:56:22,190
If you want to sleep with her later,
like here's the 50 percent likelihood if

3851
02:56:22,191 --> 02:56:24,950
you say this,
this might be the outcome,

3852
02:56:24,951 --> 02:56:28,440
but if you say that you understand where
I'm going with this most sorta,

3853
02:56:28,470 --> 02:56:32,180
but that doesn't take into account 
personality and the playful nature,

3854
02:56:32,190 --> 02:56:37,190
the people engaging into account,
how that's attracted it takes into 

3855
02:56:37,190 --> 02:56:37,190
account nothing of that.

3856
02:56:37,190 --> 02:56:39,530
Okay,
but you and I are fully aware of that.

3857
02:56:39,560 --> 02:56:43,460
Facebook has this exorbitant amount of 
data to say people aren't doing that.

3858
02:56:44,060 --> 02:56:47,750
People prefer to have the fucking stock 
response.

3859
02:56:47,751 --> 02:56:52,751
Look at emoji.
Where the fuck did emoji come from and 

3860
02:56:52,751 --> 02:56:54,080
now everybody's like,
it's like there's a face for everything,

3861
02:56:54,480 --> 02:56:59,480
right?
Used to make your owN fake ones on your 

3862
02:56:59,480 --> 02:57:00,350
character and Before that you didn't do 
it or don't do that.

3863
02:57:00,351 --> 02:57:02,900
I don't use a mobile as well.
A way they blew up.

3864
02:57:02,901 --> 02:57:07,901
Everybody's using them now as this 
alternative form to expressing yourself 

3865
02:57:07,901 --> 02:57:10,580
with the tools you have available 
beCause they're defacto.

3866
02:57:10,710 --> 02:57:13,160
So tHere's something accepting about 
seeing,

3867
02:57:14,360 --> 02:57:18,020
answering a multiple choice question 
versus one that requires more input from

3868
02:57:18,021 --> 02:57:23,021
you.
The same reason people jump to 

3869
02:57:23,021 --> 02:57:24,581
conclusions when they're building a 
response or a perspective on any of 

3870
02:57:24,581 --> 02:57:24,581
those issues.
And I,

3871
02:57:24,581 --> 02:57:25,460
I envision a future.

3872
02:57:25,460 --> 02:57:27,740
I mean if you've ever used any of the 
wearable devices,

3873
02:57:27,741 --> 02:57:31,130
I'm not wearing one right now.
The fucking bother me way too much.

3874
02:57:31,870 --> 02:57:36,870
This is just a g shock.
It's a plane watch because these things 

3875
02:57:36,870 --> 02:57:38,780
like I don't understand how that's 
helpful to be quite honest.

3876
02:57:38,830 --> 02:57:41,600
It and interpret it interrupts more than
anything else.

3877
02:57:41,601 --> 02:57:44,120
It's like the objective was what to get 
me to look at my phone less,

3878
02:57:44,240 --> 02:57:44,880
but now I'm,
I'm,

3879
02:57:44,920 --> 02:57:47,240
I'm flashing you in the face every five 
seconds.

3880
02:57:47,670 --> 02:57:49,610
Like they'd really didn't solve the 
problem.

3881
02:57:49,611 --> 02:57:51,530
Maybe we have to figure out how to use 
them better,

3882
02:57:51,531 --> 02:57:54,740
but one thing I noticed immediately on 
the apple watch when I was experimenting

3883
02:57:54,741 --> 02:57:58,730
with it was the auto responses for 
questions for text,

3884
02:57:58,731 --> 02:58:01,160
for anything,
it would have five or six options.

3885
02:58:01,290 --> 02:58:04,500
How to get back to that person and maybe
none of them are perfect,

3886
02:58:04,501 --> 02:58:08,250
but just the easiness of it is why you 
want to interact with it.

3887
02:58:08,250 --> 02:58:09,180
You're like,
oh fuck,

3888
02:58:09,181 --> 02:58:11,850
maybe I'm not late because I'm at the 
grocery store,

3889
02:58:12,210 --> 02:58:17,210
but it's easier than pulling out my 
phone and telling the person where I 

3890
02:58:17,210 --> 02:58:20,121
actually am.
How far away do you think we are from 

3891
02:58:20,121 --> 02:58:22,290
entire conversations take place with 
predetermined questions and answers.

3892
02:58:22,291 --> 02:58:27,291
This is what I'm talking about.
I'm saying that pizza is shrinking and 

3893
02:58:27,291 --> 02:58:30,890
our involvement in any of this,
the meaning of any of this is becoming 

3894
02:58:30,890 --> 02:58:32,910
less evident.
Eventually it'll be computers talking to

3895
02:58:32,911 --> 02:58:37,620
computers through us and then we'll just
be the vehicle for the delivery and what

3896
02:58:37,621 --> 02:58:39,660
will be the thing that helps it get to 
that point.

3897
02:58:39,960 --> 02:58:44,960
Well,
isn't that the thing that people were 

3898
02:58:44,960 --> 02:58:46,341
worried about more than anything anyway?
Is artificial intelligence and what 

3899
02:58:46,341 --> 02:58:49,851
better way for artificial intelligence 
to emerge then to convince us to stop 

3900
02:58:49,851 --> 02:58:50,520
using our own?
Yes.

3901
02:58:50,820 --> 02:58:52,980
Yes.
It's an interesting.

3902
02:58:53,010 --> 02:58:58,010
It's an amazing hack that didn't get 
plays on our own inability to put in 

3903
02:58:58,010 --> 02:58:58,770
work well.

3904
02:58:58,840 --> 02:59:03,840
It also,
it reduces variables and it cuts down 

3905
02:59:03,840 --> 02:59:08,181
the unlikelihood of success.
It cuts down on all the possible 

3906
02:59:08,851 --> 02:59:13,380
pitfalls and mistakes and chooses a much
more potentially successful scenario.

3907
02:59:13,400 --> 02:59:18,400
Yes,
and this is what's going on on the web 

3908
02:59:18,400 --> 02:59:18,600
on a daily basis when you're on youtube 
and that next recommended video comes up

3909
02:59:18,601 --> 02:59:21,330
and it catches your attention that this 
fucking thing,

3910
02:59:21,331 --> 02:59:26,331
inaction and it works and they are the 
smartest people in the world of 

3911
02:59:26,331 --> 02:59:29,760
engineers sitting around day and night,
ab testing what works on joe rogan,

3912
02:59:29,761 --> 02:59:34,761
what works on this other person,
and then hyper focusing in on the 

3913
02:59:34,761 --> 02:59:39,291
success stories and finding the things 
that are universal and ultimately what 

3914
02:59:39,291 --> 02:59:42,270
we ended up finding out is that we.
We all think we're so fucking unique yet

3915
02:59:42,271 --> 02:59:44,190
our behaviors sake,
the complete opposite.

3916
02:59:44,490 --> 02:59:49,490
We all do.
The shit we're expected to do was so 

3917
02:59:49,490 --> 02:59:51,900
fascinated that no one saw any of this 
coming either like 10 years ago.

3918
02:59:51,900 --> 02:59:54,150
no one thought that that was gonna be a 
real issue,

3919
02:59:54,151 --> 02:59:59,151
that you're going to have a bunch of 
predetermined answers to a phone call 

3920
02:59:59,151 --> 02:59:59,151
coming in.
How do you respond with a text?

3921
02:59:59,190 --> 03:00:00,660
Yes.
It gives you a bunch of options.

3922
03:00:00,661 --> 03:00:01,260
Yeah.
Nobody.

3923
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:04,080
Nobody thought that.
That was like a slippery slope.

3924
03:00:04,140 --> 03:00:05,790
How about this?
How about how do you trust that?

3925
03:00:06,180 --> 03:00:08,550
Anything you're going to be like,
fuck,

3926
03:00:09,270 --> 03:00:12,480
is the robot talking to me again,
or is it actually you this time?

3927
03:00:12,870 --> 03:00:17,870
You know what I mean?
You imagine having those conversations 

3928
03:00:17,870 --> 03:00:17,870
with your loved ones,
your turn,

3929
03:00:17,870 --> 03:00:18,750
your turn,
your robotic responses off,

3930
03:00:19,210 --> 03:00:24,210
right?
Because what about getting back to 

3931
03:00:24,210 --> 03:00:24,210
people?
Right?

3932
03:00:24,210 --> 03:00:26,421
I suck at it.
What about robotic robotic responses 

3933
03:00:26,421 --> 03:00:26,421
that mimic the way that you talk?
Yes,

3934
03:00:26,421 --> 03:00:31,281
because they're analyzing your keyboard 
in real time and making suggestions 

3935
03:00:31,281 --> 03:00:32,520
already.
You're already pulling the data know,

3936
03:00:32,720 --> 03:00:35,340
but the thing is,
we know we're lazy to begin with.

3937
03:00:35,341 --> 03:00:38,160
Now if we can get this system in place 
to auto response,

3938
03:00:38,170 --> 03:00:40,350
I can't even get to all the emails I 
have right now,

3939
03:00:40,920 --> 03:00:44,070
so if I can turn this guy on when I'm 
not available,

3940
03:00:45,060 --> 03:00:48,270
this responder answering emails for 
bingo.

3941
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:50,880
Oh,
if you could download your consciousness

3942
03:00:50,881 --> 03:00:53,460
into a robot assistant that knows 
exactly what you would say.

3943
03:00:53,520 --> 03:00:54,450
Robot version of me.

3944
03:00:56,760 --> 03:00:59,490
Is it me saying it though?
Nope.

3945
03:01:00,280 --> 03:01:00,790
I don't know.

3946
03:01:02,240 --> 03:01:04,370
What is key here?
then you're getting into like the whole,

3947
03:01:04,371 --> 03:01:07,490
what is consciousness thing is like,
I don't even know if it's transferable.

3948
03:01:07,880 --> 03:01:09,740
If it is transferrable than it would be 
you,

3949
03:01:09,741 --> 03:01:10,760
right?
Is it essential?

3950
03:01:10,980 --> 03:01:15,980
Yeah.
Is it necessary or are these emotions 

3951
03:01:15,980 --> 03:01:17,180
and all these things that we're clinging
to we hold onto so dearly,

3952
03:01:17,181 --> 03:01:20,720
or are they just artifacts of our 
ancient primate ancestors?

3953
03:01:20,840 --> 03:01:22,820
One hundred percent.
Definitely.

3954
03:01:22,880 --> 03:01:27,880
I think the cool part of this,
like the weird thing to identify is how 

3955
03:01:27,880 --> 03:01:32,170
our physiology has been kind of the 
system for the distribution,

3956
03:01:32,750 --> 03:01:33,890
like our own.
We talked,

3957
03:01:33,891 --> 03:01:38,891
we started off the podcast talking about
entitled people talking about that self 

3958
03:01:38,891 --> 03:01:42,830
centric emerging kind of way of living 
and you look at these things.

3959
03:01:42,831 --> 03:01:47,831
That's what they needed.
They needed us to develop into those 

3960
03:01:47,831 --> 03:01:47,900
people.
We had to become dependent on them.

3961
03:01:48,050 --> 03:01:51,650
We had to have everything we wanted to 
see available on a win.

3962
03:01:52,100 --> 03:01:56,930
For us to become the person necessary to
continue this distribution process,

3963
03:01:57,200 --> 03:02:02,200
we had to rely on it.
We had to stop relying on ourselves in 

3964
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:03,890
order to enable the reliance on 
something else.

3965
03:02:05,340 --> 03:02:10,340
We shut down our own sort of our own 
sort of response mechanisms for a lot 

3966
03:02:11,041 --> 03:02:16,041
of.
I wake up in the morning and this 

3967
03:02:16,041 --> 03:02:16,041
fucking thing.
I pick it up,

3968
03:02:16,041 --> 03:02:19,720
yeah,
I pick it up and I look at it and my 

3969
03:02:19,720 --> 03:02:22,030
fucking neck neck is cranked up and I'm 
in pain and why have I not had a coffee 

3970
03:02:22,030 --> 03:02:23,010
yet?
Why am I not on my way to work?

3971
03:02:23,280 --> 03:02:26,610
Why am I not making something that I get
incredible amount of fulfillment out of?

3972
03:02:27,450 --> 03:02:29,070
There are,
and again,

3973
03:02:29,160 --> 03:02:30,900
I think a lot of people aren't willing 
to admit this.

3974
03:02:30,901 --> 03:02:33,780
Nobody ever wants to in it and it's 
something has control over them,

3975
03:02:34,290 --> 03:02:36,680
but like in this particular case,
there are plenty of times where you go,

3976
03:02:36,780 --> 03:02:40,920
why am I looking at this right now?
And I'm still looking your check.

3977
03:02:41,100 --> 03:02:44,880
SomeThing else booked size and a lot of 
ways.

3978
03:02:44,880 --> 03:02:46,650
Well that's why a lot of people are 
flipping a flip phone.

3979
03:02:46,651 --> 03:02:50,280
Great transition.
I have a phone in my office right now.

3980
03:02:50,281 --> 03:02:52,320
It's called pumped.
Bring up a picture of this thing.

3981
03:02:52,790 --> 03:02:54,720
Pumped.
It's made by a company in Denmark.

3982
03:02:54,870 --> 03:02:59,870
It is the intentionally modern,
nice to look at dumb phone for people 

3983
03:02:59,870 --> 03:03:02,340
trying to get off the system,
bring it up,

3984
03:03:02,850 --> 03:03:06,120
whatever happened to discipline c.
Is that fair?

3985
03:03:06,900 --> 03:03:08,810
Is it fair?
Sure it was.

3986
03:03:08,820 --> 03:03:11,820
You leave heroin out.
Are you going to shoot heroin?

3987
03:03:11,940 --> 03:03:13,310
I don't shoot heroin.
Well,

3988
03:03:13,320 --> 03:03:15,450
here's the finish shoot heroin.
I have discipline.

3989
03:03:15,660 --> 03:03:17,160
Yeah,
I'm sure it's wonderful,

3990
03:03:17,430 --> 03:03:19,290
but the heroin addicts,
it's right there.

3991
03:03:19,291 --> 03:03:20,770
You can't have it right there.
What happens?

3992
03:03:20,790 --> 03:03:23,310
What happened when they put a.
What was that study?

3993
03:03:23,311 --> 03:03:25,530
That cocaine in the mouse studies.
No,

3994
03:03:25,531 --> 03:03:26,220
good.
No,

3995
03:03:26,320 --> 03:03:27,060
no.
Here's why.

3996
03:03:27,061 --> 03:03:28,650
Because it's in an artificial 
environment.

3997
03:03:28,651 --> 03:03:28,950
Oh yeah.

3998
03:03:28,950 --> 03:03:30,750
They were pissed.
They were depressed to begin with.

3999
03:03:30,810 --> 03:03:32,730
Well,
they're in a cage and they're in.

4000
03:03:32,731 --> 03:03:37,731
They're being stared at by people.
If you take those same mice and you 

4001
03:03:37,731 --> 03:03:38,710
leave them in the woods,
they wouldn't be at be happening.

4002
03:03:38,760 --> 03:03:39,450
Woods,
mice,

4003
03:03:39,780 --> 03:03:44,780
but here's the thing.
You have data and you have opinion and 

4004
03:03:44,780 --> 03:03:47,580
in in big,
big fucking digital companies,

4005
03:03:47,581 --> 03:03:52,080
they value one way more than the other 
data and the truth of the matter is that

4006
03:03:52,081 --> 03:03:53,640
people can't,
can't keep away.

4007
03:03:53,870 --> 03:03:54,560
Right?
Whether,

4008
03:03:54,580 --> 03:03:56,850
whether we want to argue it to the,
you know,

4009
03:03:56,851 --> 03:04:00,450
it's like we are the proof.
The evidence is out there.

4010
03:04:00,470 --> 03:04:02,810
It's hijacked or curiosity and with 
every click,

4011
03:04:02,811 --> 03:04:05,000
something fascinating may come.
Even if it doesn't.

4012
03:04:05,270 --> 03:04:06,740
There you go.
Even if it doesn't,

4013
03:04:06,770 --> 03:04:09,470
there you go.
So it's like discipline over what?

4014
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:11,630
Discipline over the way we think about 
everything.

4015
03:04:12,020 --> 03:04:12,500
You know what I mean?

4016
03:04:12,500 --> 03:04:15,200
It's like we just have to recognize when
it becomes a problem,

4017
03:04:15,201 --> 03:04:16,790
stop using it that way.
Yeah.

4018
03:04:16,791 --> 03:04:18,140
But I,
I again,

4019
03:04:18,141 --> 03:04:21,770
I think that's like a.
That's not going to slow it down.

4020
03:04:22,850 --> 03:04:24,480
Slow it down for everybody.
That's for sure though.

4021
03:04:24,540 --> 03:04:29,540
Were most people the sort of mass,
the mass movement continues on and find 

4022
03:04:29,540 --> 03:04:31,880
this punk thing and we find it.
Oh,

4023
03:04:31,881 --> 03:04:35,960
it's p u n k t,
sorry.

4024
03:04:35,961 --> 03:04:38,660
They're getting fancy with.
What can I say?

4025
03:04:38,661 --> 03:04:41,510
They're from Denmark.
Maybe that's how they spell it.

4026
03:04:41,930 --> 03:04:44,120
Yeah,
it has.

4027
03:04:44,210 --> 03:04:49,210
It has battery life for like two weeks.
It doesn't make phone calls,

4028
03:04:50,120 --> 03:04:50,930
you know?
Anyway,

4029
03:04:52,010 --> 03:04:57,010
that little guy right there,
punkt phone launched at the london 

4030
03:04:57,010 --> 03:04:57,530
design festival,
let's you call and text.

4031
03:04:58,040 --> 03:05:00,980
It also has nice buttons and it's easy 
to hold and that's about it.

4032
03:05:02,750 --> 03:05:07,750
Okay.
But the texting even is that old school 

4033
03:05:07,750 --> 03:05:07,750
method of so you're not going to want 
to.

4034
03:05:07,750 --> 03:05:09,380
Yeah.
You press four times to get a z.

4035
03:05:09,440 --> 03:05:11,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

4036
03:05:11,150 --> 03:05:16,150
But see,
the weird thing was for somebody who 

4037
03:05:16,150 --> 03:05:17,960
wanted to make this statement,
you had to go by like literally some old

4038
03:05:17,961 --> 03:05:19,790
device.
Well here's a new one.

4039
03:05:19,990 --> 03:05:23,600
It's a modern design,
but it's intentionally done.

4040
03:05:24,530 --> 03:05:25,700
Yeah.
You know what this,

4041
03:05:25,701 --> 03:05:30,701
you know what the designer is saying 
about it is like they're not trying to 

4042
03:05:30,701 --> 03:05:31,700
convince people to quit what their 
smartphone.

4043
03:05:31,940 --> 03:05:33,500
They're just saying,
hey,

4044
03:05:33,560 --> 03:05:34,910
put a sim card in it,
set up,

4045
03:05:34,911 --> 03:05:37,340
call forwarding when you go on vacation 
and don't.

4046
03:05:37,390 --> 03:05:39,560
And just don't take this.
If somebody really needs you,

4047
03:05:39,590 --> 03:05:44,590
they can get in touch with you,
but otherwise you're not going to have 

4048
03:05:44,590 --> 03:05:45,830
that poll.
And so I haven't cracked it open yet.

4049
03:05:45,890 --> 03:05:47,180
I'm going to do a challenge.
well,

4050
03:05:47,181 --> 03:05:49,490
I'd like a flip phone better than that,
honestly.

4051
03:05:49,670 --> 03:05:52,790
Just as flip phones,
you can shut it to hang up,

4052
03:05:52,820 --> 03:05:54,920
which is called hang up.

4053
03:05:54,980 --> 03:05:55,860
It's pretty cool.
Yeah,

4054
03:05:55,880 --> 03:05:58,160
I mean that was.
I missed that click.

4055
03:05:58,690 --> 03:06:02,090
Yeah,
her couch flip phones are cool.

4056
03:06:02,091 --> 03:06:02,930
Don't get me wrong,
I had,

4057
03:06:02,960 --> 03:06:07,960
I had a flip phone too.
I don't know why they took that 

4058
03:06:07,960 --> 03:06:07,960
particular approach.
I just think they're interesting because

4059
03:06:07,960 --> 03:06:09,530
they're the.
They're making that statement as opposed

4060
03:06:09,531 --> 03:06:13,730
to like the flip phone marketplace,
which is just like old leftover phones.

4061
03:06:13,740 --> 03:06:16,970
You can have discipline.
Maybe I'm old school,

4062
03:06:17,000 --> 03:06:19,820
just one such thing and I like it.
I use discipline.

4063
03:06:19,850 --> 03:06:24,850
Listen,
I think discipline is fucking 

4064
03:06:24,850 --> 03:06:27,281
incredible.
It's one of the which one of the 

4065
03:06:27,281 --> 03:06:27,281
greatest characteristics a human being 
can have,

4066
03:06:27,410 --> 03:06:30,230
but I didn't say.
But you were ready to use it.

4067
03:06:30,231 --> 03:06:32,360
But no,
I mean when it comes to phones,

4068
03:06:32,361 --> 03:06:34,250
I think we have the evidence.
I think we have the evidence.

4069
03:06:34,260 --> 03:06:39,260
We even you,
I believe you have that moment that I 

4070
03:06:39,260 --> 03:06:39,260
spoke of.
Oh,

4071
03:06:39,260 --> 03:06:39,260
100 percent.
Yeah,

4072
03:06:39,260 --> 03:06:43,951
definitely do.
So where's the discipline that when I 

4073
03:06:43,951 --> 03:06:43,951
realized that I put it down right,
but it's too late.

4074
03:06:43,951 --> 03:06:46,520
He already got you already clicked,
but joe and then I realized the next day

4075
03:06:46,521 --> 03:06:49,220
and I don't do it.
I check my text messAges when I wake up.

4076
03:06:49,221 --> 03:06:51,500
I look people I care about that actually
I have my number,

4077
03:06:51,501 --> 03:06:56,501
I look at that,
check my emails or anything super to 

4078
03:06:56,501 --> 03:06:56,501
have to get to and

4079
03:06:56,501 --> 03:06:59,000
then I put that fucker down and then I 
go about my day.

4080
03:06:59,020 --> 03:07:04,020
You know what?
I think I'm coming off kind of harsh 

4081
03:07:04,020 --> 03:07:06,321
here.
I'm a guy who like talks about 

4082
03:07:06,321 --> 03:07:06,321
technology all the time and it sounds 
like I'm shitting on technology.

4083
03:07:06,321 --> 03:07:07,530
You're just recognizing a real issue.
That's all.

4084
03:07:07,670 --> 03:07:12,150
And so I'm going to do an experiment.
I have the punk phone I'm going to do.

4085
03:07:12,151 --> 03:07:13,560
I'm announcing it here.
Okay,

4086
03:07:13,561 --> 03:07:16,830
so the first time anybody's heard of it,
because all you have to live on the punk

4087
03:07:16,831 --> 03:07:19,130
phone.
This is what I want to ask.

4088
03:07:19,170 --> 03:07:24,170
I'm going to send you text messages.
Nothing but youtube links would be links

4089
03:07:24,811 --> 03:07:28,910
to websites.
I want to rick roll.

4090
03:07:28,930 --> 03:07:32,550
You just sabotage.
This is a real question for you.

4091
03:07:33,030 --> 03:07:36,870
Coming from your perspective,
how long do I need to do it for?

4092
03:07:37,050 --> 03:07:39,210
To really gather the insight necessary 
to say,

4093
03:07:39,211 --> 03:07:41,040
hey,
this is how this thing is changing me.

4094
03:07:41,250 --> 03:07:42,840
I think you should talk to someone who's
done it.

4095
03:07:42,880 --> 03:07:46,010
Like what you should do is you should 
have a conversation with ari shaffir,

4096
03:07:46,020 --> 03:07:50,340
so he's had a text phone or a flip phone
rather for over a year now still.

4097
03:07:50,400 --> 03:07:51,540
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

4098
03:07:51,541 --> 03:07:54,060
He decided he was an addict and he said,
look,

4099
03:07:54,061 --> 03:07:55,650
I'm not going to change it any other 
way.

4100
03:07:55,740 --> 03:07:57,780
I tried to say we'll just have some 
discipline.

4101
03:07:57,810 --> 03:07:59,850
Nope,
not gonna do it because I'm an addict.

4102
03:08:00,090 --> 03:08:05,090
And so he just got a flip phone and 
that's all he is is he has a flip phone 

4103
03:08:05,090 --> 03:08:08,481
thing that flips two ways so you could 
flip it sideways and it actually is a 

4104
03:08:08,481 --> 03:08:09,530
full keyboard.
He can send a reasonable text message.

4105
03:08:09,540 --> 03:08:10,800
Yeah,
that's what he does.

4106
03:08:12,390 --> 03:08:17,390
Yeah.
I talked to him and being some people 

4107
03:08:17,390 --> 03:08:17,670
have told me that in order to some 
study,

4108
03:08:17,671 --> 03:08:21,960
like in order to build a habit,
it has to be 30 days gets 90.

4109
03:08:22,230 --> 03:08:23,610
Uh,
shit,

4110
03:08:23,670 --> 03:08:27,240
I ain't going to happen.
You can't do it for 90 days.

4111
03:08:27,680 --> 03:08:28,890
Dude,
what am I to do on my channel?

4112
03:08:32,100 --> 03:08:34,170
What'd you do it for 30 days?
Thirty days.

4113
03:08:34,171 --> 03:08:36,360
Thirty was the high end of 
consideration.

4114
03:08:36,361 --> 03:08:38,100
I was thinking two weeks.
Yeah.

4115
03:08:38,820 --> 03:08:39,960
Give it a shot.
Yeah.

4116
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:45,020
I don't know,
but for me it's hard because like it's 

4117
03:08:45,020 --> 03:08:46,260
kind of my business to say it's a 
different what's mine as well.

4118
03:08:46,410 --> 03:08:51,410
With comedy,
I rely heavily on information I rely on 

4119
03:08:51,410 --> 03:08:56,001
in podcasting as well.
I rely really heavily on like finding 

4120
03:08:56,001 --> 03:08:56,190
out what's going on the world,
what's,

4121
03:08:56,220 --> 03:08:59,010
what's the new latest shit that's going 
down right now.

4122
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:01,200
I mean,
so many times during this podcast,

4123
03:09:01,201 --> 03:09:04,110
jamie will pull something up as the 
podcast is going on,

4124
03:09:04,111 --> 03:09:05,520
like breaking news.
Check this out.

4125
03:09:06,240 --> 03:09:08,160
Paris just got attacked or this just 
happened on that,

4126
03:09:08,161 --> 03:09:09,170
right?
You know,

4127
03:09:09,360 --> 03:09:11,490
conor mcgregor retired.
We got to end this pitch.

4128
03:09:11,870 --> 03:09:12,840
We're at a time.
Okay,

4129
03:09:12,910 --> 03:09:17,910
great.
Well we flew by through three plus 

4130
03:09:17,910 --> 03:09:17,910
hours.
Why we're over three hours.

4131
03:09:17,910 --> 03:09:21,870
We when dude seed so easy,
like we were saying before,

4132
03:09:22,520 --> 03:09:25,720
it's really harder to end it than it is 
to just.

4133
03:09:26,370 --> 03:09:29,760
I mean it's easy to keep going.
Keeping going is the easy part.

4134
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,880
Glue is from unbox therapy.
