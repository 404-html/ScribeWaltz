1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:09,490
Boom. And we're Lively's gentlemen
who has special guest. Well, Jimmy

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,280
didn't think he was going to be here. This
was a total surprise. This is awesome.

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,710
Yeah. I'm shooting something tomorrow and
I want it to watch the fights. I'm like,

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,950
at this point, I didn't think you'd
be in town. You're always off.

5
00:00:19,951 --> 00:00:22,560
Like every time I call he's like guy, he's
a way, he's hunting, he's unreachable.

6
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,810
Um, and I was just happy that you get back
to me. Yeah, dude was perfect timing. Uh,

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,860
you know, we uh, decided a while ago, well
I was supposed to be out of town too. Um,

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:36,960
and then, uh, decided to
come back and make it back in
time for this. I'm like, wow,

9
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:40,410
we should definitely do a fight
companion. So we decided to, but uh,

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,150
Eddie was available,
luckily should be what?

11
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:46,300
Be watching the UFC.
Oh,

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,170
we are going to watch two different
things at the same time, folks,

13
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:50,610
this should be fucking complete.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:56,100
The deal is that the Canelo Alvarez fight
is supposed to start at eight o'clock.

15
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:58,090
That's what they've been pushing. And, uh,

16
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,300
I think they're doing that because they're
trying to get a lot of people in the

17
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:04,170
east coast to buy it because after
11:00 PM you're like, Jesus Christ,

18
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:07,050
I want to go to sleep. You know, because
they were doing them a lot of times,

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,370
like 9:00 PM nine 30, it's fucking
midnight, New York. It's crazy.

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,140
You're tired. Even Saturday people can
do it, but it's like, it's tough to,

21
00:01:16,141 --> 00:01:18,990
when it goes out and 1112
o'clock at night, it's not wise,

22
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,110
especially with boxing
because boxing has weak.

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:25,270
Undercards not necessarily saying
that this is a week fight. Right.

24
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,550
But even if they have a good undercard,
what do they have? Like two fights, right?

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,480
I mean, how many fights they have. You
don't want to see more than that. No,

26
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:34,440
I'm not going to pay per view.
The worst part is when you,

27
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,600
when you watch one of these
fights on the east coast,

28
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,840
by the time you get out the
arena, get your car, it's,

29
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,120
you have time for one drink maybe,
and then they shut down bars. Well,

30
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,370
the good thing is really east coast,

31
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:46,900
they shut down bars at four
in New York for a year.

32
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,980
You can go back to the hotel room,
take a shower, take a little power nap,

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,140
and then you're ready to
go to the after party.

34
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:55,290
Writes over it like tenish it's
way better. It's way better.

35
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,850
I never watched boxing anymore either.

36
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,340
Like I watched Conor and Floyd just
to watch it, but I never watch. Uh,

37
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,550
but I think I watched the last
triple g fight. That's it.

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:07,100
I watch all of his fights and I watch
it all Canelo's fights and uh, you know,

39
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:10,020
it's weird. So when you're
watching a guy started slow down,

40
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,020
like I watched him Miguel
Cotto fight and he won.

41
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,820
But he's getting hit more than he used
to get hit. It's like 36 now, you know,

42
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,980
I don't think they have
UFC style testing though.

43
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:23,850
They don't have like Usada they don't
have a Jeff Novitsky so these guys can get

44
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:27,170
away with a lot more.
It's a little slippery with like,

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,140
I don't think they did steroids in boxing.
That's hilarious.

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,180
Illegal Dude. You know
what, you got to see it.

47
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,780
Caerus I don't know how you say it
is an ecourse or oh, you are? Yeah,

48
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:44,450
but I would say that it's one of those
words that have only read the documentary.

49
00:02:44,451 --> 00:02:45,720
It's fucking amazing.

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:50,220
And it's all on this Russian doctor that
was like one of the top guys over there

51
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:51,910
for steroids and how,
what,

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,980
how much shit they can give you and
you still test negative. Holy Fuck.

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:01,140
These guys are wizards. This is,
they take this guy who's the, uh,

54
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:03,740
the main person in the
documentary and they,

55
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:06,220
they just pump them full of steroids.
He's like,

56
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,700
I want you to have a full cc of this
and five of, I mean, shooting like six,

57
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:13,260
seven things in his past
filling an experiment. Yes. Oh,

58
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,970
can experiment with this
Russian guy who's response.

59
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,760
One of the things they said was
that out of the Russian athletes,

60
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,480
there was some estimate in the
high nineties of percentage
of people that are on

61
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:24,430
steroids who wasn't on steroids.
Well,

62
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:29,020
he still like to this day in Rio,
they were actually the Olympics.

63
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,900
We're thinking about banning the
entire Russian team. They'll like,

64
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:36,370
their anti-doping program is so
sophisticated and so state sanctioned.

65
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,600
Well, can they pass Usada testing
though? Could they pass that lol? No,

66
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,750
I mean it depends because
they see the sought of thing.

67
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,000
They'll show up at your fucking house,
you know,

68
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,640
like you have to give your whereabouts
at all times. Yeah, they'll,

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,990
they'll catch you.

70
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,770
And the other thing is they keep your
piss and to keep your blood and they keep

71
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:57,160
it for a long time.
I think like seven or eight years.

72
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,080
And they actually just busted a guy
who won the Olympics, I think in tooth,

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,320
I want to say 2008 and 2012 or
something like that. But uh,

74
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,630
I think it was two guys. I don't know,
maybe Jamie could find it, but they,

75
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,700
they took away their gold metals,
these Russian wrestlers,

76
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,930
they busted them eight years later,

77
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,140
way later that they didn't have a
test for whatever they were doing.

78
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,020
So that's what happens.
It's like these guys are one step ahead,

79
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,540
but then the test catch up,
you know,

80
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,690
and then they find stuff in them and
they retroactively go and grab your shit

81
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,510
from from years ago.

82
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,590
It's like when they saved somebodies head
like Ted Williams hoping they can find

83
00:04:29,591 --> 00:04:31,480
a cure for whatever he died
from and bring him back.

84
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,450
That's why they freeze your body or
freeze your head. Right. That's so crazy.

85
00:04:34,451 --> 00:04:37,120
The freezing the head thing is so bananas.
You're like,

86
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:41,560
well listen for $5 more we
can keep your body. No Dude,

87
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:44,800
you know I'm taking a chance
as it is. Let's just go with
the head. Just the head.

88
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,130
Yeah,

89
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,130
just the idea that they're going to just
keep your head frozen and then you need

90
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:55,141
to get like they don't wake you up
amongst the first people you get woke up

91
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,420
after they figured out how
to reattach heads to bodies.

92
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,680
You get woken up way later.

93
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,390
Like I figured I'd just had a re animate
dead bodies that won't be that big of a

94
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:09,340
deal, but then attach heads on a new
body like that's a couple more decades.

95
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:12,640
Lets you talk to Ray Kurzweil. He thinks
we're going to have that in 15 years.

96
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:17,230
It's very wishful timeline. Is it
possible to be such a famous fighter,

97
00:05:17,231 --> 00:05:21,760
you have s you're rubbing shoulders with
a powerful, the elite. You're so famous.

98
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,930
Is it possible for,

99
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:27,490
for a fighter and have so much fame that
he has connections to the Illuminati?

100
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,330
No, the people that tell them our
group, the people tends to steroids. It,

101
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,710
he would never get busted. Like it's
totally winky, winky. Certain foods.

102
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,390
Is that possible?
It's totally possible,

103
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:40,510
but it's just super unlikely because
there's too many pieces involved.

104
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,200
Too many people would know and it's uh,
also there's no benefit to them.

105
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,870
They would have to be getting paid shit.
Tons of money.

106
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,730
It's just so sneaky like that
in order if you have, cause you,

107
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,760
what if someone dies,

108
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,720
you know like what if someone gets a
ship eight out of the winds up dying and

109
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:59,510
turns out that these people got ahold
of money and that's what allowed them to

110
00:05:59,511 --> 00:06:00,950
not do drug tests on this guy.

111
00:06:00,951 --> 00:06:04,430
And this guy was on Jews and then he
goes in and beat someone to death.

112
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,910
It's Kinda hard to keep anything
electronically. A secret. I mean,

113
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:12,600
the head of the CIA could make a fucking
email disappear. This the Russians,

114
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,670
no one got buses to returns driven.
Matter of everything gets out.

115
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,770
No one goes to jail.
Please step down.

116
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,260
Now he had to step down
because he would have you,

117
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm just saying what you say Jim. I
missed it electronically. You can't,

118
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,410
nothing's a secret anymore.
Like we're not always his name.

119
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:32,130
The head of the CIA who was cheating and
he got busted that stupid email. Yeah.

120
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,260
Betrayal of trust yet. And he was, you
know, a war hero? Yeah. He ran the a,

121
00:06:37,261 --> 00:06:39,460
the whole, what they call it,
the uh, the theater. He was a,

122
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,650
do you know the story behind him though?
How he got caught?

123
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,710
I think you're investigating
someone else, right? No.

124
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:49,880
He was hooking up with a chick
and the chick was a little mouthy.

125
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,160
Didn't she write his
book? His biographer? Ah,

126
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,210
I think there was her and I think there
was another one and the other one.

127
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:01,010
What might have been a part of some freaky
marriage situation where the husband

128
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:03,380
and wife banging other people
or something. It was, it got,

129
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,630
it got heavy enough where it was weird.
Yeah,

130
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:10,160
and the one of the ways they got Patraeus
out of there was like through some

131
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,470
sort of adultery clause,
which is hilarious.

132
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:17,570
It's like a morals clause is one of the
best killers in the military and you're

133
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:20,450
telling him if you bang on the
chicks we won't let you kill people.

134
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,540
All information that's
coming from the mainstream.

135
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,580
Who knows what really how those guys tell
the truth knows what's going on. Yeah.

136
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,910
Who knows what that is, why they
made him do that. Like what?

137
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,970
What pieces might have fallen into play
Frank Underwood's style that allow that

138
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:37,690
to happen.

139
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,020
Who they piss off Elliot Spitzer piss
somebody off 10 years ago and they went

140
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:45,590
and digging and they got him.
Well Spitzer went after the banks Spitz.

141
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,800
It's really a shame about
Spitzer because in any other era,

142
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,520
Eliot Spitzer would have been
probably like a big time hero,

143
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,350
like some sort of a like clean him up cop
type of guy who's like looking out for

144
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,184
the good guy.

145
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,030
The problem is there was some serious or
proxy because it turns out that he was

146
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:06,860
actually targeting brothels as
well as visiting and which is just,

147
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,920
yeah man, you can't do that.
Like it's just, that's even,

148
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,690
it's one thing if he just got hookers,
sure.

149
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:15,500
But the fact that the guy was arresting
all of those [inaudible] out of his way

150
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,780
for it. Yeah. He's a real
douche and it's like,

151
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:20,950
that's why I love to see these guys who
legislate against gay people get busted

152
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:24,020
and restrooms and stuff because you're
actively trying to fuck somebody life. Oh,

153
00:08:24,021 --> 00:08:25,490
for sure.
And it's always those people.

154
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:28,520
It's always those people that care so
much, they get angry at gay people.

155
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:32,330
You know? It's just such a classic
story writing. They're hiding,

156
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,820
hiding their whole life that they're,

157
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,430
they overdo it just so that
no one sniffs them out.

158
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,990
It's such a classic cliche that you
see it. You're like, Oh God. So,

159
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:46,340
so obvious. Did a great documentary
on politicians who are outed,

160
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,650
like who were anti gay but
got out of there as being gay.

161
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,460
You know what it's like.

162
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,020
It's like that really scrawny type of
male feminists that's always like sticking

163
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:58,950
up for women and saying like, of course
you are like, it's such a cliche.

164
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,280
It's,

165
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:04,280
it's almost the same cliche as the gay
guy that's it hates gay marriage and

166
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,120
hates gay people because
he's trying to cover it up.

167
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,720
It's usually these guys that
are like overwhelmed with lust.

168
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,630
The women seem so impossible to,

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,080
to get with that.
They,

170
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:21,170
they morph themselves into this like a
semi real human being that only looks out

171
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:25,770
for women's issues all the time.
24 seven.

172
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,870
It doesn't see anything
wrong with women ever.

173
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,870
You know that guy where it's like
you're not even real anymore. Yeah.

174
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,250
It gets you to put on
you because then you're,

175
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,210
then you're fucking allowed to walk among
them and be comfortable and they trust

176
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:40,620
you and they call you an ally.
You're an ally and they fucked the allies.

177
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,890
So everyone wants to be an
Alpha course. Watch the UFC. Ah,

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,810
Eddie Brown like boxing, but luck man,
they keep punching each other. Ah,

179
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:53,520
it is interesting how it becomes
way less interesting. Right? Yeah.

180
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:55,720
I haven't watched watch anymore a good,

181
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,580
well I watched Mayweather versus a Connor.
She thought that was interesting.

182
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,320
I was in Iceland for that.
It was like five o'clock in the morning.

183
00:10:02,321 --> 00:10:05,130
He was in a bar and it was fun to
watch because of, you know, again,

184
00:10:05,131 --> 00:10:08,080
I wanted to see if cotton would do okay
but Mayweather against anybody else that

185
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:11,460
have no interesting cause that was fun.
That was lots of fun.

186
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,280
I like watching that guy fight period.
I'm always,

187
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,970
I watched may whether even
if it's a boring ass fight
cause what you're watching

188
00:10:17,971 --> 00:10:21,660
is some guy that just can do things that
other people who are not able to do.

189
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,630
He's, yeah, he's going to be one
step ahead. I just don't enjoy them.

190
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:28,380
Like I watched the uh, the pack. Y'all
fight in a bar and I was like, Ugh,

191
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,080
what am I you one round from the next?

192
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,310
I look exactly the same and what
channel on to 19 to 19. Thank you sir.

193
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,280
So what we're going to do folks is
just go back and forth from the fight.

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,020
So you got that c you're totally hardcore
MMA fan. Would you consider yourself,

195
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,740
I love the podcast. That's
her Matthew, the UFC podcast

196
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,110
fan.

197
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,700
That's like the expert and I'm like the
guy who can do the more humans I use

198
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,030
every UFC or you're going to try to watch
unless you've got something going on.

199
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,080
I watch most of them. I usually
watch them the next day on the uh,

200
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,990
fight pass cause I'm usually doing
gigs Saturday night too. Matt is Great.

201
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,000
I love that too.
He's such a great guy.

202
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,180
He took Eddie and I into his gym
when in like 2001 or some shit.

203
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:20,160
Remember that he took us to his,
Jimi picked us up at the train station.

204
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:22,440
We took the train in the long island.
He took us,

205
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,540
picked us up in the train station,
took it to his gym,

206
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,930
showed us his apartment in the basement
where he used to pee in a jug because he

207
00:11:27,931 --> 00:11:31,380
drank so much water he couldn't get out
of bed cause he needed his sleep because

208
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,214
he was fighting.

209
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,550
So he would just carry a jug and put it
right by the bed and just piss in the

210
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:39,390
jug in the middle of the night. It was
hilarious. Matt Serra is awesome. Yeah.

211
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:43,770
And he's such a real guy. Like he's
exactly that guy all the time. He's great.

212
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:47,130
He's great. What a great move
it is to have him on that.

213
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:50,100
Dana white looking for a fight show
and to have him on your podcast.

214
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,980
Well he had the podcast first
and I think that they asked him,

215
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,040
couple of people and

216
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,110
when he, when Dana brought
up my name, he's like, yeah,

217
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:59,620
I would love to it because we got a
long while. So it's a fun dynamic.

218
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:04,420
I mean you could just fun and you guys
got jelled with each other. You know,

219
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:09,250
you gel. Yeah. But you could see it's
like you guys are friends. It's fun.

220
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,180
That's like a big thing, man. You know?
And I think people underestimate that.

221
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:16,390
It's one of the reasons why these TV
shows sometimes are so stale and flat.

222
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,040
They're stiff. Yeah, well
they don't like each other.

223
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,900
Then our friends with each other,
you know,

224
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,120
like people like when they see people who
actually like Goldberg and I like when

225
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:27,850
we used to do broadcast
together Goldberg's my friend,

226
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,660
like I really liked that guy.
And Jon Anik, same thing.

227
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,020
Annex my friend Dominic Cruz, my friend,
like I hanging out with that guy.

228
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,260
He's interesting. Paul Felder. Like
I could hang out with these guys.

229
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:41,950
That's big man. You know? That's why
people like these kinds of podcasts.

230
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:44,050
That's why people like,
you know,

231
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,100
anything where people get together and
they can hang out and you feel like a

232
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:53,101
real camaraderie versus like entertainment
tonight store is back and boy and see

233
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:57,220
angry. Yes, he is. Mike
Thor's back in the newest,

234
00:12:57,221 --> 00:13:01,750
most amazing version of Thor.
Let's take a look like those people don't,

235
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,690
even if they are friends,
you can't tell. It's,

236
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:07,330
it's unwatchable and it's
unlistenable and it doesn't feel,

237
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,010
it feels like nothing you can connect to,

238
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,260
so I don't know anybody I
speak to like that. Exactly.

239
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,150
I was going to tell each
other to shut up on that show.

240
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,080
I wonder if w with wonder woman now at
the forefront of sports and technology

241
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:24,250
and shut the fuck up. Yeah, it's annoying.

242
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,030
They have like these pre scheduled
scheduled promos that they do.

243
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:31,300
They feel so stale and
everything's just stay.

244
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,210
Well that's why even on TV I go back
and watch old Dick Cavett Shit like

245
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,510
interview bishop prior in 1985 I'd
rather hear a real conversation with dead

246
00:13:37,511 --> 00:13:41,440
moments then like a late night TV show
now where everybody thinks they're on

247
00:13:41,441 --> 00:13:44,680
fire every time the camera's are
on this terrible. Most of them.

248
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,460
These like entertainment shows like
shows on entertainment, like pool.

249
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,640
That's hard to get right will you used
to be that the networks had all the power

250
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,690
and there wasn't ever a PR a content
problem. It wasn't like, damn,

251
00:13:58,691 --> 00:14:02,470
we need content that was slots.
There's Thursday eight 30 Thursday,

252
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:05,350
nine o'clock they'll slot. There's
just those slots. That's it.

253
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,430
We got plenty of motherfuckers trying to
make pilots and that's never a problem

254
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,280
with content.
Now it's the opposite.

255
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:17,110
Now they need content so more people
can get their shit out now it used to be

256
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:21,400
totally controlled. TV has
always suck. You can't watch aid.

257
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,960
We Watch TV shows that we grew up on
because we had no choice. You would.

258
00:14:25,961 --> 00:14:29,860
I would watch TV going, okay, what's
the best of this? These terrible shows.

259
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:30,820
I'll just watch that.
You're like,

260
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:34,630
fuck it badly just to love think some of
them were good back then to right now,

261
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,250
the fall guy.
Watch now.

262
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:43,420
Watch a Paul Guy now I can't
probably doesn't. Hold on TV.

263
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:47,620
Didn't have to be good. You're right.
He had all the control now. Shit,

264
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:51,920
it has to be good and now you need
content. The $6 million different world

265
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,430
holds up. The Sasquatch episode
reflect the Big Foot Douchey,

266
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,690
just thing ever on television and I
couldn't wait to watch the fight tomorrow.

267
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,840
Louis Martinez, Sergio, more eyes.
This is a great fucking fight.

268
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,080
Gomar Huisman is a stud wrestler.

269
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:11,110
Fucking serious athlete and [inaudible]
is one of the best Jujitsu guys in MMA

270
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:15,470
today for sure. Tapped out chrome
Gracie and its first black belt match.

271
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:20,270
He's a legit anybody that he's the guy
that set up then mounted triangle. Right.

272
00:15:20,271 --> 00:15:23,900
Nice and slow. Yeah. You know what he
said once about one of his opponents,

273
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:27,920
he said it would be more likely that
he got me pregnant than submit me.

274
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,610
He was talking about an improvements
in is striking. It's like in striking,

275
00:15:34,611 --> 00:15:38,090
I think I have the advantage and in the
ground it would be more likely that he

276
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:42,320
got me pregnant and then you submit me.
That's how bad ass that mother fucker is.

277
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,150
But Camaros Huisman is a
stud and he is super legit.

278
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,780
Fantastic wrestler with
really good striking,

279
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,420
very strong guy.
Very dangerous.

280
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,440
Could be future superstar
world champion guy type of guy.

281
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,300
You'd have to take out Leeanne Edwards,

282
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,070
just Edwards actually doing
really well against him.

283
00:16:01,071 --> 00:16:03,890
It seemed like in the first round and
then like you know once he had them on the

284
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:06,590
ground he was finished.
So see us, he's a savage.

285
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:11,260
You got to watch a match ISM ground
and pound vicious from wrestler.

286
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,220
He can do everything, man. He
could submit guys, you know he's,

287
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:18,440
he's a super stud wrestler but he
absolutely can do all that stuff.

288
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:23,000
What are his best American top team guy?
So he's like a black belt in Jujitsu.

289
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,240
No wonder what he is and Jiu Jitsu.
I wonder like if he's ranked,

290
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:29,180
but you know like there's a lot of
guys that aren't ranked like Michael

291
00:16:29,181 --> 00:16:29,840
[inaudible].

292
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,860
Michael Kass in my mind is like a
black belt but he's not even ranked.

293
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:37,670
Should that fight him and stop your
thing? No, definitely not. Never.

294
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,130
You don't stop chokes.
Why would you stop a choke?

295
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:43,520
You let a guy go to sleep so he's up. He's
actually fit. If the guys unconscious,

296
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:46,310
he was clearly not unconscious
guys get out of shit.

297
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,440
You've got to give him an
opportunity to get out of shit.

298
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,380
His arms were like this
man. You're right. Stop it.

299
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,600
Cause there's no next move.
Yamasaki stopped it early. Yes.

300
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:58,850
He should have let him go out. Yes, yes.

301
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,870
But a 100% Yamasaki everybody,

302
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,770
any black belt knows when a guy's
about to go out his before he goes out,

303
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,490
his hands go like this and that's
what happens a lot of times.

304
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:11,540
If you let go with the choke,

305
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,030
you pop right back up and say you're
all totally correct. But Buddy,

306
00:17:15,031 --> 00:17:17,690
she did let him go to sleep. Shit, let him
go to sleep. And here's the other thing.

307
00:17:17,810 --> 00:17:21,200
This is our absolutely also possible to
some guys when they're getting choked,

308
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,230
they will concentrate just on their neck
and they were tight enough their neck

309
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,300
and they won't do this
and fight around with it.

310
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:29,750
They would literally put all their
energy and concentration on the neck and

311
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,960
avoiding the choke by just
squeezing and holding on their neck.

312
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,700
If they think they have a
little bit of blood flow,

313
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,910
if they could force a little bit of blood
flow and they think that they can stay

314
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:41,990
conscious longer than the guy can squeeze,
I don't buy it for the long haul.

315
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,350
I think the on the long haul,
a guy like you know,

316
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:48,350
someone who someone is a really
good fight, like a Damien Maia Guy,

317
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:51,990
he's gonna fucking put you to sleep. You
can't, you can't do that on him, right?

318
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:56,720
The question is can I do it on Kevin?
But even I don't want him to go down.

319
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,210
He's very good.
Even when you're tightening your now,

320
00:18:00,211 --> 00:18:04,380
but he's not limp if he's doing this,
okay, this is, his arms are here, right?

321
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:07,080
So if he's concentrating on
his neck and his arms are here,

322
00:18:07,081 --> 00:18:10,890
if he really does decide to stop doing
this and just try to just concentrate on

323
00:18:10,891 --> 00:18:12,960
his neck,
it's not a good strategy,

324
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,130
but it might be something you would
use if you thought you were fucked.

325
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,530
If you thought you're fucked,

326
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:21,680
you in a really bad spot and you really
can't peel his arms off, and he goes,

327
00:18:21,681 --> 00:18:24,120
you know what, I might be able to
just power through and he might not,

328
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:27,540
he might've had a tap or it might even
want to sleep or he might have gotten out.

329
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,250
We don't fucking know because guys have
gotten out of some crazy shit. In fact,

330
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,240
earlier that night, the
woman who got it right. Yeah.

331
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:40,510
Who I fuck, I forget that fight.
What was that fight? Find out? Um,

332
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,330
what the card was on the Kevin
Lee Michael Key s a fight.

333
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,600
But the point is it's not dangerous.
It's not like a,

334
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:51,420
an arm bar or taking
punishment on the ground.

335
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,910
Like when someone takes a couple of
extra shots on the ground that aren't

336
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:58,800
necessary, that that's bad. But if
someone gets choked out, that's not bad.

337
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,850
It's not bad. You've got to let him get
choked out. You're not preventing anything

338
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,880
damage. Glen. Um, who just, it just a,

339
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,650
that fight that should
have been stopped on the,

340
00:19:07,651 --> 00:19:10,210
I want to say it was one of the
prelims tug. Gavin Tucker. Yeah.

341
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,130
Guaranteed against brick land.
That was bad. I saw Dana tweeting.

342
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:15,730
I hadn't seen the fight yet.
He's like this referee.

343
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,670
And then when I watched it fight
like this must've been the fight.

344
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:19,470
He was talking. Well, you
know what the thing is,

345
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,400
is that it was a slow beating work
was giving him a slow beating.

346
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:26,280
He just kept beating him up. It
was, there was no giant big bombs,

347
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,020
but it was a cumulation of bombs. It
never ended. It just, he was so workman,

348
00:19:31,021 --> 00:19:34,470
like in professionals. Very,
very impressive victories.
Is that why he didn't get,

349
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:36,450
I thought he should have got like a,
a fight of the night or,

350
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:38,970
or performance of the night. I mean, I
thought that that was a pretty amazing,

351
00:19:38,971 --> 00:19:42,480
and he didn't get anything for
that, which were the girls that, uh,

352
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,930
almost choked the shit out of each other.
Was it flees, Harrigan, Justine Kush? Yes,

353
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:48,230
it was.
Was that seen Keshon fleets Herrick?

354
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,270
Is that the fight where she
shit or know who on that? Uh,

355
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:55,810
I believe police did right? When did that
happen? Yeah. Philly's won last week. No,

356
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,710
that, no, that was a couple of months ago.

357
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:03,850
I was asked to fight that fight that
Kish had that allegedly she hit herself.

358
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,860
Oh, whatever happened. Yeah.
I Dunno if she did or not.

359
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:10,980
It's supposedly that can
be grounds to stop a fight.

360
00:20:10,981 --> 00:20:14,250
Now it's like in the rules like if they,
you shit yourself,

361
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,600
it's too dangerous cause there's
all like scratches and shit. Yeah.

362
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:21,180
If you have cut so you can get like the
worst staph infection known to man and

363
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:23,230
plus you may make a move
to avoid being put in that.

364
00:20:23,231 --> 00:20:25,130
That's going to put you in other
kinds of danger. Like just you,

365
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:27,210
you want your face mushed in
that you may do something right.

366
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:30,240
Your neck and Jennifer is a very good
point. If someone's going 69 on you,

367
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,680
if you're in like north south position,

368
00:20:31,681 --> 00:20:36,120
which is legit position and this dude just
shit himself. That's super rude. Yeah.

369
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,660
Yeah. It's a bad place to be. But hey
man, it's life and death in there.

370
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,760
[inaudible] he would go,

371
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,470
this is a good fucking fight

372
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:48,000
is like Ooh,
what's going

373
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,090
to happen here? Fight. Okay.

374
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,300
Dan Merkel Yada dance lemon down.
Yeah.

375
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:58,760
He's the only 500 pounds
now cause gigantic policy.

376
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:03,780
Huge. He's like at least six five
and he's not like a tall thin guy.

377
00:21:03,781 --> 00:21:07,710
Users at giant for real though.
He's probably 300 pounds easy.

378
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,570
Very interesting.
He's one 74 51 of the first round,

379
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:16,280
(504) 094-0840 seven if you want to

380
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:21,180
sync it up with us.
42 41

381
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:26,790
we're rise is missing a tricep on
his left arm has got one missing.

382
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,110
I know he's got a bicep
misery. What happened? What
happened to the tricep? His uh,

383
00:21:30,111 --> 00:21:34,260
arm tour and he never got surgery on or
if he got surgery it never came back.

384
00:21:34,261 --> 00:21:36,960
But look, you could see it doesn't
really have a tricep on his left arm.

385
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:41,450
It doesn't start when he got hurt,
he got hurt to the bomb. Oh Shit.

386
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,440
He's in a lot of trouble.
He's a,

387
00:21:45,441 --> 00:21:48,680
he's in a lot of trouble and get on top
of it and the get that he's hurt and

388
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:51,380
he's on his back and he won't get on
top of it. Yeah, but that's smart.

389
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:53,780
Like make them stand out with
your team to let off on him.

390
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:56,030
But he's on his back on his back.

391
00:21:56,031 --> 00:21:59,270
He might have a chance to do something
standing up. He's getting tooled.

392
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm agreeing with you,
Joe. I'm just, it's smart.

393
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,580
Mariah's recently. Yeah,
it's smart. I mean,

394
00:22:07,581 --> 00:22:10,520
wouldn't you tell them if you were
Comoros coach, fuck cow. You're like,

395
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:14,680
don't go in the rounds of sky lit up,
kick kick his calf because not theirs,

396
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:15,441
isn't it that chance?

397
00:22:15,441 --> 00:22:18,350
He's just gonna wrap his arms around
you and catch his breath. Oh, 100%.

398
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,540
How do don't get any my sweep you,
you might,

399
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,580
you might think he's
more tired than he is.

400
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,100
He might recover quicker than you think.
Next thing you know,

401
00:22:25,101 --> 00:22:27,290
he's got deep half on you
and next thing you know, Ooh,

402
00:22:27,291 --> 00:22:32,180
he's swinging and he might have a better
shot on his back then he does standing.

403
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:32,661
Hey,

404
00:22:32,661 --> 00:22:37,661
how long before someone
starts doing sidekicks and
front kicks to the calves and

405
00:22:38,001 --> 00:22:42,770
to the, to the shins. How long before
like a Shin Kit comes back like in school?

406
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,850
Remember when that hurt?
Like a motherfucker. Kids
would kick kids in the shins.

407
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:48,810
Yeah, but I think that
after that, that civil,

408
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,420
I've been fight and get on your toes.
You have done,

409
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,110
if you curl your foot back
in, uh, like a front kick,

410
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,820
oh shit. It's illegal kick,
right? Yeah. I think it's legal.

411
00:22:59,821 --> 00:23:04,420
If you could sidekick the thigh, if you
could, uh, we'll kick the head. How,

412
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,130
how has anything to do like illegal.
It's Hilarious, right? Yeah.

413
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:13,170
Well in almost mean how many people
that get hit on the back of the head.

414
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,330
That's one thing I was
noticing about boxing tonight.

415
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,110
Guys will complain while they're in the
middle of an exchange of a punch hits

416
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,800
the back of the head. I touched the back
of their head like, hey, you're cheating.

417
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,000
You're hitting me back here
to fucking hit me back here.

418
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,890
It's almost like an excuse
for getting hit at all.

419
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,430
You fucking never see that
in the UFC in stand up.

420
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,160
He never see guys complaining about
getting hit in the back of the head.

421
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,470
You hear about it on the ground.
You know,

422
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:37,290
like you hear about like sometimes
when a guy is trying to finish someone,

423
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:40,620
they'll hit him all over the place and
sometimes it'll hit the head whether it's

424
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:45,230
on purpose or not. They only know,
but standing up you never hear it.

425
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,110
What did you think?
That referee

426
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:50,860
is? Pretty Tall. He's
out. He's out. Oh Shit.

427
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,850
Wow. That was sensational. I told
you tomorrow Huisman is legit.

428
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,570
That that dude is seriously talented.

429
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,280
Upstanding up was a smart move.
Yeah. He could be the one.

430
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,900
That guy could be a legit world champion.
I believe he's undefeated too.

431
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,750
Here's one loss. Who's
his loss too? He was like,

432
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:14,780
it was his second fight or something. I
think he's in a long, long winning streak.

433
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,370
Who's his lost to jamming Camaros?
Man,

434
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:24,990
I'm a problem. I said, oh man. For some
reason I thought it was like Nigerian.

435
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,960
He came when he was young.
I asked him about it that
he's faced. Serious wrestler,

436
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,310
serious athlete.

437
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,840
Siri did get everything so thick
is speed and the thing is man,

438
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:40,820
he didn't even start out as a
striker. Jose, he wrestled in college.

439
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,880
He got submitted way back in
CFA 11 in a second profile.

440
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,530
Boom to look at the speed on that
shit. What about the shot? Hello?

441
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,364
Take that too.

442
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:57,270
Is that Dan just giving this guy an
extra second to see if he didn't stop,

443
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,360
stop his eyes rolled back.

444
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:02,630
I just wanted to see if the
guy was conscious cause if
he rolled and then he was

445
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:07,310
looking at him and he had his hands
up, he would let it go. Stop it fish.

446
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,030
So you don't think it should have
been stopped before that car?

447
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,750
She had to get that second floor.
You know what one extra punch.

448
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:15,020
It's a violent sport. They could have
stopped it but he could have recovered.

449
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,790
That was the perfect stop it.

450
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,340
She got to let it play out a
little bit and it's hard to do.

451
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,730
Dan's one of the best in the
business though. He's so good.

452
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,000
He's on t he liked you very rarely
have complaints about Dan Merkel,

453
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:29,390
Yada fighters hate I'll fighters hate.
Dan stopped early.

454
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,310
You know Jay Gavin Tucker actually said
that he thanked that referee for not

455
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:37,570
stopping at chance, but that's just
the guy was too tough for his own good.

456
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,100
That's just first lost though. I mean
he's a really tough dude and like he, he,

457
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:42,280
there was no way he was
going to quit but it isn't.

458
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:43,850
It's like orbital socket all fucked up.

459
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,860
I mean he's going to have a
lot of things wrong with him.

460
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:50,750
He got beat up real bad. It was a
bad beating. He took a beating for,

461
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,870
I mean the first round it
took a while before, you know,

462
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,630
it got sort of lopsided.

463
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:00,290
But then from the second round on it
was pretty obvious that Rick Lynn wasn't

464
00:26:00,291 --> 00:26:04,370
getting tired and you're just pushing
this crazy steady pace and just Gavin

465
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:08,600
could not keep up with them and Rick was
long and he couldn't get close to him

466
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:13,601
and Rick just had this very workman Lee
approach just cap on him and the dude

467
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:15,140
just started breaking.

468
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,250
Just the guy who knows a guy who's been
around for a long time and then the

469
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,930
least the way Frankie Edgar beat up on
y'all, y'all Rodriguez and your guy,

470
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:22,040
he's been around for a long time.

471
00:26:22,041 --> 00:26:24,230
Who knows how to beat the
hot young guy coming up.

472
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:27,860
Well Frankie Edgar's on
a totally different level
cause Frankie can keep this

473
00:26:27,861 --> 00:26:32,390
ferocious pace that's so few
people can keep up with like yeah,

474
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,400
he thought he could,
might keep up with it.

475
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,460
He thought like maybe when I get in
there I'll be able scrambled this guy,

476
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:39,980
I'll be able to keep up with them.
My gout ground games pretty good.

477
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,040
Probably worked on get back up to his
feet, probably thought I'll surprise them.

478
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,330
I'll surprise him and when
we're kicking standing up,

479
00:26:45,331 --> 00:26:46,560
he's not gonna be able
to deal with my shit.

480
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,110
They just realize there's
levels to this thing.

481
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:53,460
Frankie Edgar is on that
world championship level.
Is that what he's thinking?

482
00:26:53,461 --> 00:26:55,830
Probably is like there's no way
Frankie's didn't get close enough to me.

483
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,150
I'm going to be able to
keep him away from me.

484
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,930
Well or catch him coming in or Frankie
might try to exchange with them on the

485
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:05,280
feet and he has a chance to land something
or maybe it's takedown defense is

486
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:07,680
better than you know.
Frankie thinks it is.

487
00:27:07,681 --> 00:27:10,560
There's a lot of thoughts that go into
your head when he tried to pull something

488
00:27:10,561 --> 00:27:13,830
like that off, but it was, if you
are as a manager, there's not,

489
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,230
it's not the fight to make,
it's just not the fight.

490
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,970
It's the one of the worst fights to make.

491
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,850
It's good to find out how you
do against an elite wrestler,

492
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:25,560
but not the elite wrestler. The guy
who is a lightweight world champion,

493
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,170
now he's coming down to one 45 was the
only guy has been able to beat him as

494
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,910
Aldo. [inaudible] here's the decision
I think, right? Yeah. I mean,

495
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:37,260
Frankie's Goddamn world class, although
might have his number, I don't know.

496
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,710
But that doesn't mean that
Frankie can't beat a lot of guys.

497
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,850
He fucked up cub Swanson like
easily his world championship level.

498
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:48,780
But sometimes like guys, just for
whatever reason, can't be another guy.

499
00:27:48,781 --> 00:27:51,540
Like Joe Frazier was always
a world championship level.

500
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,440
Boxer could not be George Foreman.
If they fought a hundred times,

501
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:58,080
George following would've beat
him a hundred times. Yeah.

502
00:27:58,081 --> 00:27:59,910
And that's got to get into your
head after. I mean, I mean,

503
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,310
John's called me only twice and plus
all this stuff that happened there is

504
00:28:02,311 --> 00:28:05,160
always that one guy that you just
can't do anything against theirs.

505
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,510
There's guys that have a solution to your
style, you know? Do you remember, um,

506
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,060
sugar? Shane Mosley? Sure. Vernon Forrest.

507
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,300
Verna Forrest just had this
solution to sugar. Shane Mosley,

508
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,060
I believe he beat him twice,
you know,

509
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:23,061
and it was like one of those things
where Vernon didn't look the best rest in

510
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:26,880
peace. He got shot actually
is a terrible story man.

511
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,240
Cause that someone was trying to rob his
car and he tried to stop someone from

512
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,520
Robin as cotton that shot him.
The gas station in Atlanta.

513
00:28:32,521 --> 00:28:34,230
Is that the guy I'm
thinking of? Yeah. Yeah.

514
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:38,200
Chase the guys still like he chased him
in a fucking pop them. It was, yeah.

515
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:42,540
And apparently he was a super nice guy.
It's just a really, really sad store.

516
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,100
But he like,

517
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,490
he could shine against Shane in a way
that he couldn't shine against other

518
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:50,850
people. Yeah. But then like Ricardo
my org and knocked him out. Remember,

519
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,180
I don't remember if I Believe
Mountain Mel Mayorga knocked him out.

520
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:58,070
Definitely beat him.
I believe actually my Shane Mosley,

521
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,950
one of my first UFC event,
he was there. It's, I'm,

522
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,750
I want to say it's 2008 2000 I
might in a rampage fight 2009 mm.

523
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,550
It's weird to watch boxers and those
things and how they react. It is weird,

524
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:10,710
right. But watching Bernard
high, stepping on a behind bug,

525
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:11,790
Bernard Hopkins and Yale,

526
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,520
he had critical things to save a bunch
of guys rolling around. It looks gay.

527
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,600
And then watching him and his trainers
watch the guys on the ground that they

528
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,610
were there watching the standup,
they were fine,

529
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:23,070
but what they really got impressed with
was the stuff on the ground because

530
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:24,120
that's the stuff he can't do.

531
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,350
So it was interesting to watch him kind
of watch his opinion change as he was

532
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:31,590
there. Right? Yeah. I
mean they have to talk.

533
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,510
The problem is there's like these,
these camps like look at that. Boom,

534
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:38,700
look at that right hand.
Good Lord. That was clean.

535
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,950
Like you see him shaking his head.
He's totally out of it.

536
00:29:41,951 --> 00:29:45,640
There were the timing on
this. Oh, that's so good.

537
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,280
Uh, but you know, people just get lumped
off into camps. I get what sports better.

538
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,720
That's so silly.
Yeah.

539
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:58,330
It's so silly because boxing at
its highest level like tonight,

540
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,080
well we're going to watch and just
hopefully like five or 10 minutes they're

541
00:30:02,081 --> 00:30:06,400
walking out now. Oh Shit.
That is a very compelling,

542
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,140
do you know that's one of the
main differences right there.

543
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:09,110
What you just saw we spend,

544
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,290
that's where the main differences
between UFC in every sport is the,

545
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,130
the way that fighters treat the
fans and interacting with the fans.

546
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:18,850
You just don't see that in any
other sport. No, it's true. They,

547
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:21,670
and there was a lot of events
where people get to meet fighters,

548
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,960
they do a lot of events,

549
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:25,710
a lot of signings and share it and
go meet him and hang out with them,

550
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,520
getting invested in them and
you get connected to them.

551
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:29,080
So then when they're on the
prelims and the under car,

552
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:33,060
you still want to watch them fight. Yeah.
Yeah. There's a lot, a lot of good things.

553
00:30:33,061 --> 00:30:37,360
The UFC figured out that boxing had
fucked up and now boxing is kind of take

554
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:42,220
picked up the slack and a lot of
ways. Rob Font, powerful rob font,

555
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,760
he's a Markdale grottos student.

556
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:49,860
Very talented guy and they also figured
out giving you the fights that you want

557
00:30:49,861 --> 00:30:53,380
to say. Yup. Let's just give
you the fights. Don't make
it wait five years, like,

558
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:57,100
which we did with uh, uh, Tyson
Holyfield just put the fight together.

559
00:30:57,101 --> 00:31:00,580
Make it happen. You don't have 10
different promoters working on it. Yeah.

560
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,060
It's hard to do that with
boxing, you know? Sure. I mean,

561
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:06,330
this Canelo a Gennady Golovkin fight.

562
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,280
This is a unification middleweight
title fight. Let's go to her right now.

563
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,640
It's uh, it's very fucking hard
to get these things to pull off.

564
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,573
Okay.

565
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,960
It's all the behind the scenes people.
Yeah.

566
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,270
Back thing is not working.

567
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,320
Hey, real quick. All right. You
think the bathroom is saved now?

568
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,940
I gave it the mandatory hour. Yeah.
That's a good hour. All right.

569
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,130
Let me try to find this. Jamie. What
did, where am I supposed to point?

570
00:31:41,131 --> 00:31:44,280
This fucking thing? That
side. Okay. Now it's working

571
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,040
big fight for branch.

572
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:53,770
Huge dude that they
give him Luke Rockhold.

573
00:31:53,771 --> 00:31:58,070
It's kind of crazy.
Is this his first fight in the UFC?

574
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,080
No. No. He used to be in the
UFC a while back and then,

575
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:07,730
um, I guess I'm going to have to keep
doing that. So to 19 button or something.

576
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,720
Yeah, it's not working. Um,

577
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:16,300
one 23 maybe. Okay. Hang on a sec.

578
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:20,160
This is the most boring part of the
podcast ever. What did you just ask me?

579
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,170
David Branch. He fought, I'm
Gerald Harris way back in the day.

580
00:32:25,171 --> 00:32:29,640
Gets slammed and code.
This is like his first fight in the UFC.

581
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:30,780
He was in a,

582
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,760
Gerald Harris has guard and he
slammed him and knocked him out cold.

583
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,280
So it was a good fight up until
that moment. But he was in,

584
00:32:38,281 --> 00:32:39,710
his guard is trying to his guard

585
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,230
and he got just body slam and
got knocked out from it. Yeah,

586
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,260
he got picked up in the guard like a Rona
rampage. Gerald Harris a stud. He um,

587
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:52,160
he didn't get picked up that high.
It wasn't like that.

588
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,470
That's the craziest shit of all
time cause that wasn't the guard.

589
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:58,910
That was a trial bridge.
Think of that. Crazy.

590
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,060
Extra higher. Ooh, that's terrifying.

591
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,560
That's the most terrifying slam of all
times. We watched that the other day.

592
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,450
He did? Yeah. We watched the head.

593
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,260
The head collide as he slammed into
the ground and you see Rampage's head

594
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:17,270
smashing der Rhona's head dude.
Nobody could spell rampage.

595
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:22,040
Slam people. All right folks, so
Gennady Golovkin just walked out.

596
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,460
I got all those belts.
Motherfuckers. A lot of belts.

597
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,780
Like a 23 or 24 first round knockout
streak to be something something

598
00:33:31,611 --> 00:33:35,930
preposterous. Not Cruiser
checking account. They're
bull champions. Not Heavier.

599
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,910
The well Gennady Golovkin it's been
fighting at a heavier weight class and a

600
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,940
Canelo fought Floyd Mayweather I think
at one 52 and I think earlier in his

601
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:51,960
career he fought lighter than
that, I believe. Early way
earlier too though. Fans?

602
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,600
Yes. He was a young guy. When you were,
when you went pro like real young. What?

603
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:01,340
What's that? He had 23 straight
chaos in the first round.

604
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:05,210
Gennady Golovkin did, is that what
you're saying? Yeah, 23 straight chaos.

605
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:08,540
But then he went to, I don't think they
were on the first day. They weren't. No.

606
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,301
Okay.
First.

607
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:12,040
I'm just adding to his legend for no
reason and how it's making sure most of

608
00:34:12,041 --> 00:34:16,820
them, he would break guys down over
fight all the hype and the Promo.

609
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,470
How it blew him up. He's at like from
that fight. He's like a national hero.

610
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:25,520
Couldn't hello? Kayla was
already a national hero. Not
Quite as big as he is now.

611
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,290
Yeah.
I guess the main with if I made a big,

612
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:30,740
but when it just beat the shit out of
Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. That's terrible.

613
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,270
Terrible fight. That
was sad to watch. Yeah.

614
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,530
My mom didn't know who Canelo was
before that. Mayweather fight.

615
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:37,610
Now she worships him.

616
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:41,450
I don't love the daddy that it'd be
honest with you as Mexican as it gets.

617
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:46,250
Isn't it sad to watch a guy like Julio
Cesar Chavez Jr fight a guy like Canelo?

618
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:48,920
Like you could tell one of them,
oh dude,

619
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,450
this is supposed to be the ones in the
family business. He's not that good.

620
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,700
You get knocked out just now.
You got to heat up that.

621
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,550
He went into a defensive shell.
He just stopped firing back at all.

622
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:00,740
It was just getting tooled on,
you know,

623
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:02,630
he reminded me of the kid
and the bad news bears.

624
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,300
Remember the kid when he had you holding
the ball and he's so pissed off at his

625
00:35:05,301 --> 00:35:08,690
father and his father slapped him in the
face and he won't throw the ball home.

626
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:10,070
That's what he reminded me of jargon.

627
00:35:10,071 --> 00:35:12,680
That fight just like fucking just
kind of stand there letting it happen.

628
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,970
It was hard to watch man. I was like,
this kid doesn't need to be doing this.

629
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,530
Like he doesn't really want to do it.

630
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,210
Didn't it seem like he
didn't want to fight? Yeah,

631
00:35:20,211 --> 00:35:22,880
he definitely didn't want to fight
the head like a panic attack. No.

632
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:26,210
I just think you realized that there
was just a level of commitment the canal

633
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,610
possesses that he just
doesn't and he knew it in the,

634
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:33,320
there's like tells in their interviews
like Max Kellerman does a very nice

635
00:35:33,321 --> 00:35:37,010
interview when he sits down with two
fighters and he sits in between of him.

636
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,040
He asked some questions

637
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,790
and Alaskan questions and they have this
like translate thing back and forth.

638
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:46,791
But you could see like psychologically
Canelo had a big advantage over him.

639
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,370
You know, Canelo was just saying,
look, you know, his, his fight career,

640
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:54,990
it's been a disgrace. I fought
the best of the best. And uh, he,

641
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:58,530
his, you know, his father was amazing and
it was an incredible world champion, but,

642
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,610
uh, he's just never lived up to the
hype and you could see like, you know,

643
00:36:02,611 --> 00:36:06,300
he was like, well, we'll know. Yeah, it's
not going on back. I'm going to know.

644
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,550
That's a very poor comeback.
Was He good though?

645
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,240
Was he like before Canelo
he's always been good.

646
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:16,770
He's always been a fighter. No, he's,
he's, he's lost to some fighters,

647
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,170
like maybe one or two.
I can't remember how many people,

648
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,360
he's one of the best. He's just, and
he just can't, he can't get that belt.

649
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,770
He was better I think a few years ago,
but he was always been,

650
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,100
he's always been a very good fighter.
Like he's not a bad fighter. Like Julio,

651
00:36:32,101 --> 00:36:36,120
Cesar Chavez, Jr knows how to fight for
sure. He's just not at this guy's level.

652
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:38,240
But do you think it's because
like their fathers are both, well,

653
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,770
I'm thinking about Marvis Frazier
to or your guys whose fathers,

654
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,570
when you grow up with boxing money,

655
00:36:42,571 --> 00:36:45,390
it's a little harder to be motivated
then kind of like that for sure.

656
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:47,970
You don't have that kind of confidence,
you know, that kind of means streak.

657
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:51,870
It's not a coincidence that so many
of these guys grow up in impoverished

658
00:36:51,871 --> 00:36:55,410
situations. But here's the thing,
Jon Jones I don't think grew up in,

659
00:36:55,411 --> 00:36:57,000
I mean his family is still together.

660
00:36:57,330 --> 00:37:01,830
I think he had a comfortable financial
childhood. I might be wrong about that,

661
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,410
but I mean his family
is all together so it's,

662
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:11,370
it's, it doesn't like some guys
are just better at it. Yeah.

663
00:37:11,371 --> 00:37:12,750
But I think there's is
much more the other way.

664
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,810
Then there are guys who
grew up comfortably. There's
some like bill and Bam,

665
00:37:15,811 --> 00:37:16,710
they still lay in bed.

666
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:19,710
They said grew up pretty comfortable and
wealthy and was still like the biggest

667
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:21,330
animal on the cool.
Totally happen.

668
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,030
You could have a kid that has
all the money in the world,

669
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:27,480
but they just have some psychotic drive
where they just want to be the best at

670
00:37:27,481 --> 00:37:29,750
something. They want to prove
they're not pussies. Let me even get,

671
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,170
it could be that or it could just be,

672
00:37:31,171 --> 00:37:33,990
there's people that just
really love testing themselves.

673
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,000
They just really love competing and they
get, you get a few steps ahead, right?

674
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:39,361
Like you,

675
00:37:39,361 --> 00:37:41,670
you do it for a little bit and then you
really start getting into it and then

676
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:44,760
you get into it more and then it becomes,
you come to your favorite thing to do,

677
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:47,910
becomes your identity.
Like even if you grew up with money,

678
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,180
you could still become
obsessed with something. Sure.

679
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,780
And if you could come obsessed by being
the best at anything, it's possible.

680
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,280
It's just not as likely. It's way more
likely when it's a poor kid, they grow up,

681
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,230
you know,
with a sense of urgency.

682
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:05,420
He grow up with a like this
knowledge in your head that hey man,

683
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:09,180
it might not always be okay.
Like there could be a real bad time.

684
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:11,940
And a lot of times your motive for going
after it is different too because you,

685
00:38:11,941 --> 00:38:14,430
you really do remember what it's
like to have absolutely nothing.

686
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:17,850
So your motive is to avoid that. Again,
it's that, that's a very powerful thing.

687
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,000
It is a very powerful thing and
you can't fake that by like boxing.

688
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:22,230
It's too much shit in the ring.

689
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:26,150
There's just too much business happening
and look at all these people and it's

690
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,730
very unnecessary as 30 people in it Kinda,

691
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,390
it's Kinda like that in music too because
the thought is that you have to grow

692
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:35,950
up and not in the same kind of,
you know,

693
00:38:35,951 --> 00:38:40,750
impoverished or like just a serious,
a broken family,

694
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:44,750
lack of love. But then you have
Chris Martins, singer from cold play.

695
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,310
He breaks the mold, like
Valedictorian, you know,

696
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:52,660
brought up with money and a just
a happy lot. You know, he's just,

697
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,800
it's just one like make them, yeah,
exactly. Bayless that's there. By the way,

698
00:38:56,801 --> 00:39:00,610
the referee, I think who was
shitting on Conor and Floyd fighting,

699
00:39:00,611 --> 00:39:03,040
who'd want to see that? It's two
different sports. Kenny Bayless.

700
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,760
I'm pretty sure that's the ref that they,
that they did not want. Oh, that's funny.

701
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:09,730
Well, you know, a lot of boxing
people want, like I was saying before,

702
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:14,230
they want to defend boxing. They want,
you know, they want to be on team boxing.

703
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,611
And honestly,

704
00:39:15,611 --> 00:39:20,611
I played apart that a little bit when
I had this thing with Lou Dibella very

705
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:24,040
good in that, by the way. Well,
it felt like it was pretty easy.

706
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:27,100
It wasn't making very good argument.
It's terrible argument. The problem,

707
00:39:27,101 --> 00:39:30,430
the other problem is, I mean, you know,
if I really went to war with somebody,

708
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:34,870
I said, yeah, I got that guy. It was
a terrible argument. And I'm a fan,

709
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:39,760
like does the dump truck, I'm a fan
of boxing and I probably know a lot.

710
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,930
I bet if he and I sat down and we just
start talking about classic fights,

711
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,770
Hagler Hearns you know, sugar
ray Leonard, Roberta it around,

712
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:51,490
like he would realize like really quick,
I'm a legit boxing fan.

713
00:39:51,491 --> 00:39:56,290
I fuckin love boxing. How many rounds did
Hagler Hearns go was at three. Yes. Yes.

714
00:39:56,291 --> 00:40:00,520
What did you draw with Third
Hagler? Oh, I don't know.

715
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,170
He had that fight with Mayweather though,

716
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:05,050
where Mayweather just Mayweather
did a genius thing. First of all,

717
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:08,620
I made him cut a lot of weight and him
get down to one 52 drained him up a

718
00:40:08,621 --> 00:40:10,570
little bit and then you know,

719
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:13,870
he caught him before he reached
the level that he's at now.

720
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:16,350
Like when he fought Amir Khan America,

721
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,570
he fucked Amir Khan up dude with
a haymaker of her right hand.

722
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,230
And you know when you, when he landed
that bomb and put Amir Khan to sleep,

723
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:27,760
you've got to go. Okay, this
is a guy that's now at the
fucking peak of his game.

724
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,200
So when he fought Mayweather,

725
00:40:29,201 --> 00:40:32,590
Mayweather caught him right when he
was getting into it. You Know Ryan,

726
00:40:32,591 --> 00:40:35,140
when he was coming up and that may where
the fight I think took them over the

727
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:35,974
top.

728
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:40,480
When you fight a guy that's a slick
and it's talented fucking fast and the

729
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:43,960
timing that may whether has, and you
realize like there's levels to this thing.

730
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:47,470
It's the Lufkin fighting it
the way he normally five.
Oh yeah, this is his weight,

731
00:40:47,471 --> 00:40:50,860
man. He's the king. This guy's a beast.

732
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,810
I know the guys behind him
look exactly like him too.

733
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,340
The good thing about this fight is
what's interesting is Gooden. Golovkin.

734
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:02,460
Some experts believe that he might be
slipping slightly and Canelo is coming up.

735
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:07,930
And the idea is that a year ago go,
Lufkin would've fucked Canelo up.

736
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,610
This is what a lot of people believe,

737
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:13,570
but now Canelo was better and Golovkin
might have faded a little bit.

738
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,890
What's the age difference? I think
Lufkin is, he's older for sure,

739
00:41:17,891 --> 00:41:21,460
but I think he's 35 see if you
could find that young. Jamie.

740
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,090
I want to say he's 35 or 36 yeah.

741
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,480
Oh,
he's still Lufkin is what?

742
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:34,130
34 I think he's coming Thursday 35

743
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,810
okay. Yeah, so that's like the law is if,

744
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,420
unless he's Jewson that's the last
of the squeeze. Eight years. Yeah.

745
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,890
When you're around.
No,

746
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:46,940
but I mean when you're around 35 like
that's when the decline happens to almost

747
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:51,170
everybody. Right? 36 it's
slips. 37 slips more. 39 40.

748
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:54,990
Very rarely see a 40 year old champion
that's not on the sauce only now.

749
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,560
That's why Randy coture was
such an amazing, I mean,

750
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,380
that's really what Bernard Hopkins
was the most impressed Jesus.

751
00:42:00,381 --> 00:42:05,300
Yet he went into his fifties and he still
was out boxing worldclass fighters and

752
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:08,600
drop in them. You know, I mean
he got fucked up by Joe Smith,

753
00:42:08,601 --> 00:42:11,370
but Joe Smith is a monster. The final
thought we get knocked to the rain.

754
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,420
How scary. How old is he now? 52 or
53. And he was 50 when he last thought.

755
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:19,290
If he was 51 or 52 in his brain,
his Pr, I've interviewed him.

756
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,980
He's perfectly coherent. Like
there's the, I don't know how he,

757
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:26,360
here we go round one, ladies and
gentlemen. Eddie Bravo prediction.

758
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:31,220
I'm going to go with the Mexican too.
You got to go with your people.

759
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:36,020
I understand. Um, Norton I got
to go with fuck Lufkin have to.

760
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,510
Yeah,
absolutely.

761
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:43,960
I feel like either one of these
motherfuckers could shock the orthotics.

762
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,860
Don considered white. Uh, well,
yeah, I mean it's definitely white.

763
00:42:48,861 --> 00:42:52,610
If you go to a black neighborhood
and try to say the n word. Yeah.

764
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:56,510
That's all you need to know
is are you white? Well,

765
00:42:56,511 --> 00:43:01,210
can you get away with being in a black
neighborhood and using the n word or that

766
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:04,070
type of credibility or do not.
If you're Wesley snipes dark,

767
00:43:04,071 --> 00:43:06,890
you can get away with using it
anywhere in the world, right? Sure.

768
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,690
So Canelo's white Canelo was actually
Mexican, but he's got red fucking hair.

769
00:43:11,691 --> 00:43:12,870
It's crazy.
It's like holes.

770
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:18,230
Kazakhstan is considered white then why
wouldn't Canelo be considered white?

771
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,800
But he is white for sure.
I mean he's rushing or you know,

772
00:43:21,830 --> 00:43:26,390
part of the former Soviet Soviet Union,
China and it's right by China. Well,

773
00:43:26,391 --> 00:43:28,640
you know, a lot of these
people have Mongolian and them.

774
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:33,920
A lot of these people there, well
no, it's like an Asian, but it's um,

775
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:38,570
that's gangs con. I mean
Gingiss con, they, I think
they said some insane number,

776
00:43:38,571 --> 00:43:43,130
like 5% of all the men in Asia or all
the people in Asia have gang is cons.

777
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:45,530
Jeans. Jesus is, he's jumping
loads all over the place.

778
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,820
Everybody and killed everyone
killed. Like, you know,

779
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,210
they don't even know how many millions,

780
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:55,211
but somewhere between 20 and 70 million
people died directly by his hand.

781
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,670
You and his daughter was named.
Which one? Shaka chocolate cones

782
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,660
a fee.
I met her on a falafel place in New York,

783
00:44:05,661 --> 00:44:07,780
being Godfrey chased her down
the street and ran it by me.

784
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:12,000
God love comes fucking this one
in 200 of the whole population.

785
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,870
The world is directly
descended from Gaviscon.

786
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,440
Look at that. Oh my God.
What years was he a,

787
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,480
was he alive because he was like the
$1,200 a hundred percent of China.

788
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,000
Yeah. Oh Dude, this is a great fight. Huh?

789
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:32,070
Golovkin just double

790
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:32,820
jab them.

791
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,690
Ooh,

792
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,760
that's a strong jab.
That might be a big factor.

793
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:42,920
He's used that jab before on guys and
shocked him and out Jay outboxed him.

794
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,840
Uh,
Lemieux he did that with,

795
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,690
he came out and started popping him
with the jab and a lot of people didn't

796
00:44:47,691 --> 00:44:52,100
expect that he can. Outbox is shit
out of people. He caught him. Yeah.

797
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,650
Oh yeah. Those are blocked though.
Those nothing's happening there.

798
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:01,250
Those are getting blocked.
The Jab is what you got to keep an eye on.

799
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,010
C in order counter,
right hand of Canelo

800
00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:11,090
triple G. Yeah, he is bigger. He's
taller. We'll see how that keeps landing.

801
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,820
His face is fucked up
and it's the first round.

802
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:15,240
Okay.

803
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,000
He's getting lit up
with that straight jab.

804
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,030
He's shaking the attitude.
He shaded a lot. Well,

805
00:45:25,031 --> 00:45:27,850
he gets angry at people and starts
talking shit to him and he puts his hands

806
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,230
down and lets them punch him in the face.

807
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,200
When he was breaking this one dude down,
as he was breaking him down,

808
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:34,900
he put his hands down and started
walking towards them and letting the guy

809
00:45:34,901 --> 00:45:38,320
punched him. Just moving his hands
slightly and then fucking digs in on him.

810
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:43,000
He's a mean guy man. How blocking. Yeah,
he's seen ecology that amazing though.

811
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:43,751
When you drop your hands,

812
00:45:43,751 --> 00:45:46,840
a lot of times guys won't react
immediately convinced as a school yard

813
00:45:46,841 --> 00:45:49,720
humiliation of a guy doing
that and you missing.

814
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:53,410
It's really weird to watch professional
fighters not always just go right in and

815
00:45:53,411 --> 00:45:55,120
when someone's hands are down.
Let me help you out with that.

816
00:45:55,121 --> 00:45:56,830
There's also a reason
when you drop your hands,

817
00:45:56,831 --> 00:45:59,410
you don't know where the punches are
coming from. It's a different thing.

818
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,720
Like it's very tricky.
When someone drops their hands,

819
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:04,330
you have to be very careful because
things can come from anywhere.

820
00:46:04,331 --> 00:46:06,970
It's one of the reasons why
Tommy Hearns when he jabbed,

821
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,610
he kept his hand down here
and pop it up in your face.

822
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:12,160
It's do you don't see it as much.
You don't see it. It's quick.

823
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:15,700
If someone's standing right here and you
see this and you see that you see the

824
00:46:15,701 --> 00:46:19,270
hands a little bit more there, it's a
traditional pattern that you understand.

825
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:21,300
When someone has their hands
down low and they start moving,

826
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:24,100
their head shift can come
wild from all over the place.

827
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:28,750
How many cards has a triple g headline?
Only a few.

828
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,990
He's been mostly like an HBO
fighter be but because his,

829
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:34,090
his paper views didn't sell well.

830
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:37,120
Like one of them only Gennady
Golovkin I forget it. We fought,

831
00:46:37,121 --> 00:46:38,980
but he was like 150,000 buys.

832
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:44,290
It's unfortunate because he's fucking
look marvelous in there. I mean,

833
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,700
his name is Gus guys. He beat Kell
Brook, Kell Brooks. Very good.

834
00:46:48,701 --> 00:46:51,910
And he broke him down. Yeah, no,
he's a black guy from England.

835
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:54,640
Really bad ass world
champion at a lighter weight.

836
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:57,100
He was world champion I believe
at welterweight and it came up.

837
00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,120
Oh look at this Kennel. I don't like
all that wasted energy right there.

838
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:06,370
A little too much emotion. He, I mean
he liked rooster them, got behind them.

839
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,240
That's a lot of energy.
Just blew there.

840
00:47:09,241 --> 00:47:12,460
And I find a lot too during
in Connor met with a lot.

841
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,080
I think that was different though.
You know,

842
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:20,050
these guys are way more identical
in terms of skill and career,

843
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,770
but I'm seeing Golovkin get the better.
These exchanges,

844
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,650
they just showed him both jab at
each other at the same time. Stiff,

845
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:30,070
you know,
the,

846
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,500
the age could really be a factor.
You know?

847
00:47:32,501 --> 00:47:34,600
Canelo has never really taken a beating.

848
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:38,200
He only had one fight that he lost and
that was that fight with Mayweather.

849
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,760
And he really didn't get beat up in
that fight. He just got out boxed.

850
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,380
Is that a decision? Yeah. Unanimous. Clear
Mayweather just showed him what's up.

851
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,900
But he didn't knock him out.
You know what I mean?

852
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:54,310
It's like Canelo's beating the fuck
out of some really good fighters.

853
00:47:56,370 --> 00:48:01,370
He's super dangerous puncher and Golovkin
has been a way more wars than canal

854
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,600
Canelo has. Canelo has figured out a way
to avoid wars and just put it on people.

855
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,140
It's just fucking really
good, man. This is for boxing.

856
00:48:10,141 --> 00:48:11,340
This is like as good as it gets

857
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:17,450
because Canelo is still getting better,
you know? Ooh, that's a sweet jab. I mean,

858
00:48:17,451 --> 00:48:20,570
he's 27 now and this fight is gonna
make them better too. You know,

859
00:48:20,571 --> 00:48:22,580
he's only 27 Golovkin.

860
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:27,940
If canal managed to Kale him
and he's 35 could be the end,

861
00:48:28,131 --> 00:48:30,110
you know?
Or at least the beginning of the end.

862
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,200
He's not 25 but Canelo almost is.

863
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,590
And part of the appeal is that he's 37
and now there's something that undefeated

864
00:48:36,591 --> 00:48:40,610
firelight, those three g's on his
belt. That's it. That's dope. Well,

865
00:48:40,611 --> 00:48:44,530
he's undefeated for a reason, man. He's a
fucking master. Gucci should sponsor him.

866
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:48,080
Nah, it's all right. Just
like we want to have your gs

867
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:53,660
or the free masons. Just the other
one put over your day. Just put,

868
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:58,661
put our gs up top and then your g over
the Dick who bloat the watch company

869
00:48:59,571 --> 00:49:04,100
sponsored his Dick. Look, isn't that
funny that people care about that? Like,

870
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:04,990
yeah,

871
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:09,410
like that the UFC WWE like didn't
want that lot of people felt,

872
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:13,410
felt like you guys see too much of that
on boxer shorts. It bothers them. Like,

873
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:14,450
I don't even notice it.

874
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:15,810
Okay.

875
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:18,560
I didn't even help with sales.
Or does it just get into your psyche?

876
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,370
You don't even realize it's in there?
It's a good question.

877
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,960
I remember back in the day, um, cigarette
companies used to sponsor fighters.

878
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,860
Like boxers used to have cigarette
companies and their shorts.

879
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:34,890
Forget who did that. You know what
it might've been Mayorga did. Ooh,

880
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,240
fuck.
Had a cigarette company sponsored them.

881
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,890
Cigarette company sponsored boxers give
ever see the old way they would sponsors

882
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,990
cartoons and they would
show Fred smokey a Winston.

883
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,050
Like they would have like fucking
a, what's that? I hate that show.

884
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:51,220
The Flintstones. Do you hate the
font style? It makes me sick.

885
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,930
The spies from why? I don't
know. I just always hated them.

886
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:59,290
Why? It's a weird one.
I'm not a big cartoon guy,

887
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:02,830
but that one I particularly at
that left hook the body son. Ooh,

888
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,860
boom. Good love came with
a crisp straight, right.

889
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:14,210
This is good as it gets for boxing man.
It really is.

890
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:19,060
You know you got a guy and Golovkin
undefeated 35 and now that blast and

891
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,280
everybody wanting that big fight
and then kill Navajo Alvarez.

892
00:50:22,281 --> 00:50:24,710
This proud superstar steps up.

893
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,610
Wants this fight and just stay the fight.
They both call each other out.

894
00:50:28,611 --> 00:50:31,280
They both want, I mean canal is always
said he wanted to fight the very best.

895
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,800
He's bleeding glove.
It looks like he's

896
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,740
looking at another one behind
it. Wow. God Damn. Go off gins.

897
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:44,330
Good God damn. He's good.
He landed some shots there,

898
00:50:44,331 --> 00:50:46,880
man.
Whew.

899
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,970
That was an interesting combination
the way through the left hook and then

900
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:54,290
through it again. It's surprising. Left
Hook. The second left took in particular,

901
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,070
he's forcing this kid to box with them.
I mean the slug with him.

902
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:59,660
That's his style of fight.

903
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:05,620
Canelo is a really good counter striker
and what's what's going on here now it's

904
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:11,990
Golovkin is just really coming to him
and Canelo's this is like a perfect fight

905
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,780
in a lot of ways. This is like
the kind of fight you would hope.

906
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,910
But this Canelo want to stand
there with him and trade punches.

907
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,640
Well he wants to counter strike but it
mean glove is going to come towards him.

908
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:23,440
So he has his opportunities.
I mean it's,

909
00:51:23,441 --> 00:51:26,140
it's a brilliant fight
like as far as like what,

910
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,650
you know stylistically
it's perfect. Has, uh,

911
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,810
has glock could ever even really been
in trouble in a fight? Not really.

912
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:36,520
He's been punched a lot though. Never
been dropped? No, I don't believe so.

913
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:39,130
I've never even seen him like stunned.

914
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,820
He did have a really good
fight in his last fight.

915
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:45,550
Can you put Golovkin record up
so I can remember homeboy's name.

916
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,980
He's had a couple of very
good fights where, you know,

917
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:53,980
people are coming to him
very, you know, enthusiastic.

918
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,970
Last Friday for his Sherman was
less, I don't, I Daniel j Dash Jacob.

919
00:51:57,971 --> 00:52:01,420
Daniel Jacobs is the one that's the,
that guy that was a really close fight.

920
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,370
Awesome,
awesome fight.

921
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:07,030
But it was unanimous decision for Gennady
Golovkin but Daniel Jacobs is fucking

922
00:52:07,031 --> 00:52:11,770
for real white guy, black guy.
He's super good. So it was like,

923
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,200
it was a big win and you know,

924
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:18,580
everybody could tell watching the fight
that Jacobs is super legit. I mean,

925
00:52:18,581 --> 00:52:22,930
we already knew it coming in,
but so even though he did knock 'em out,

926
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,640
it's still,
he's still one damn Canelo's fierce.

927
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:31,720
Fierce. Both guys are fierce. Oh, that
left hook to the body. What? Hello?

928
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:35,470
They're both so good man.
Oh that EPR cut.

929
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,870
Damn. See. And then the other thing,

930
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,430
you've got to think of his age man.

931
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:47,460
The reality of age 35 with some wars
behind them versus 27 with really no wars.

932
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,060
Just smashing a lot of people.

933
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:58,593
Okay.

934
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:03,000
Really good trainers. When the
same trainer, since he was a kid,

935
00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:08,430
what he's showing me, Jamie, what's
going on? Is that the UFC, oh my God,

936
00:53:08,431 --> 00:53:11,880
you're amazing.
How can we can't put it on that TV.

937
00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:15,990
Oh,
we got to fix that.

938
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,800
Who are these guys fighting
arm triangle.

939
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:26,370
Oh, Craig Gillespie. Jason Jaws.

940
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:29,353
Okay,

941
00:53:29,420 --> 00:53:32,120
well folks, we are, we should
be on Twitter at the same time.

942
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:33,930
We should be periscoping.
Yeah.

943
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:38,543
Hmm.

944
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,410
I don't use any of those live. I want you
to a while ago on Facebook. I just, yeah,

945
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,460
I know it's supposed to help,
but I just can't do it. Yeah,

946
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,870
just it's sometimes it's too much.
He keeps going back to the arm triangle.

947
00:53:48,871 --> 00:53:52,380
He lost it last time you went back to now.
Oh No.

948
00:53:52,381 --> 00:53:54,660
He lost it against like he's
going to under jack it again.

949
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:59,070
You go right back to it. Easy on us. He
goes right back to it. Look at this shit.

950
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,000
You could tell.
You know.

951
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:02,070
I knew he was going to do it cause
he's so good at it and at it.

952
00:54:02,071 --> 00:54:04,170
There's no way he's going to,
he's going to wear him out.

953
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:06,330
He's got to keep them in the
chopping block right there.

954
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,120
He's got to not try to finish them.
Just keep them on the chopping block.

955
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:13,070
What do you think of that way of
defending? That was a nice way Dan,

956
00:54:13,071 --> 00:54:15,240
when you grab the escrow.
No, that's the thing.

957
00:54:15,241 --> 00:54:19,260
You've done doing it the way he's
doing it. Oh, he's out. He's gone.

958
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:24,030
It's over tap. What was that? What it
a ghost. Angeles finished off by Neil.

959
00:54:24,031 --> 00:54:28,860
Maggie with uh, yes he did smushed
them round four. Here we go.

960
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,710
This is to add having the UFC
play here too. That was dude.

961
00:54:34,711 --> 00:54:37,450
You turn it on at the perfect
time because you don't,

962
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:42,480
you rarely see an under Jack
Battle in the UFC like that battle.

963
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:46,200
He tried it three different times. You
rarely see that. You don't ever see that.

964
00:54:46,201 --> 00:54:50,850
That's Greg or Gillespie. He's a
fucking beast man. Greg Ward Gillespie.

965
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:53,610
Yeah,
it's a bad mother fucker right there.

966
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,330
He's at least I have some
good mount strategies. He
wasn't trying to beat him up.

967
00:54:57,331 --> 00:54:59,730
He was trying to show shots in the body.
Oh Man.

968
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:02,310
Can Ella just hit him with a hard
left hook to the body and go,

969
00:55:02,311 --> 00:55:06,600
let's see if they show. These guys
are going at it. Man. This is crazy.

970
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,010
This is a fucking warm man.
I mean you like,

971
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:18,060
we were watching like an all time
classic boxing war right now.

972
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:24,580
Ooh. Maybe that jab that hit him. It looks
like I missed him. Did I hit him? Huh?

973
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:26,680
Popped him fast.
Ooh

974
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:35,230
hmm.

975
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,040
Eddie Bravo. Would you be watching
this if it wasn't for us? Yes,

976
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:43,210
because he's Mexican. Ah. Did you
know it was gonna Start at eight?

977
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,800
They always start around eight,
eight 30. We'll hold the money.

978
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,820
Eventually they started like nine. They
decided to start this one early. Okay.

979
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,150
Just to make sure that people in the
east coast, Ooh. Golovkin with that Jab.

980
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:57,640
You think that was the thinking to like,

981
00:55:57,641 --> 00:56:00,730
let's make sure people in New York and
Jersey and Florida can order this for

982
00:56:00,731 --> 00:56:05,060
sure. That's what I'm, oh dude.
Oo, this is distractible Shit.

983
00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:07,650
All right. That's a good idea first. But

984
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:12,550
um, he just did that thing by the way. He
dropped his arms a little bit too. Yeah.

985
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:19,370
It's boxing them up. He shook his head
as soon as they shake their head. No,

986
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,430
that means yes. Yeah. Does that ever
mean guy isn't hurt when he shakes?

987
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,350
Because why would you tell him you
didn't hurt? You're not hurt. Well,

988
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:30,310
it does kind of look, he ain't got
shit. You could say that a guys,

989
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,390
but the problem is when someone actually
hits you and really dangs you and then

990
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:38,080
you do it like never. Well,
maybe the Noah's saying, no,
you didn't knock me down.

991
00:56:38,081 --> 00:56:42,490
Not this time. Maybe that's what he
means, baby. It doesn't seem like it.

992
00:56:42,810 --> 00:56:46,390
Almost mostly what? It seems like that
didn't hurt. Like that ain't shit.

993
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,880
You didn't get me. No one ever
says he didn't knock me down. Yeah.

994
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,180
Except in like a Jake lamata movie.
That was exactly it.

995
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,800
Very close up on the rings
trying to Fucking Ooh,

996
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:01,010
Jab and that counter right together.
These guys are so well matched. Ooh,

997
00:57:01,011 --> 00:57:05,780
look at that tight left hook by
triple g. He's hurt triple gene. No.

998
00:57:05,781 --> 00:57:08,090
Canella you think so?
What makes you say that?

999
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:10,670
Because it keeps going
backwards into the ropes

1000
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:18,190
body shot that you were talking
about. Right when that landed, he was,

1001
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:22,620
he looked at his eyes, he went, oh shit.
You might be right. Might be right.

1002
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,440
I keep forgetting. These are
three men around and know
they're weird, right? Yeah.

1003
00:57:25,441 --> 00:57:26,910
You get into it, you're
like, I'll fuck the bell.

1004
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,410
You know what's interesting about that?

1005
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:33,470
It's easier to go five minutes boxing
than it is to go three minutes of

1006
00:57:33,841 --> 00:57:34,674
wrestling.

1007
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:39,540
You have the shoe fc is like five
minute rounds and boxing is three minute

1008
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:40,770
rounds,
so they just got used to it.

1009
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:43,980
But one thing though is if
you give a short around,

1010
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,160
there is a good argument
for a shorter round.

1011
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,380
That argument is guys can go faster and
harder in three minutes then they can

1012
00:57:51,781 --> 00:57:53,900
and five cause they have to
conserve themselves. Right.

1013
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,940
Do you feel like boxing over the last year
is making a comeback or not? For sure,

1014
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:03,270
but I think boxing isn't a
good place. Right? It's making
a little comeback. Yeah,

1015
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,570
and it might have something to do with
the fact that there's a rivalry going on

1016
00:58:06,571 --> 00:58:09,250
between UFC and boxing. Like
what sport is better? Yeah.

1017
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:13,080
I think it's bringing more attention
to boxing. You know, by the UFC fans,

1018
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,960
they're paying attention a boxing
because there's this debate.

1019
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,730
Maybe it's a good idea.
We'll could argument maybe
the UFC and boxing up. Well,

1020
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:22,950
it's also boxing in a
real good place right now.

1021
00:58:22,951 --> 00:58:27,951
There's so many good fighters
Chanko I mean these two gentlemen,

1022
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,180
right? You really do a three
minute round you have to say,

1023
00:58:30,181 --> 00:58:31,320
I mean with Jujitsu and all that,

1024
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,030
but I was thinking is maybe a
five minute round a box here.

1025
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:37,680
It'd be kind of interesting, but I
think they're doing it right, honestly,

1026
00:58:37,681 --> 00:58:39,120
because I think you know,

1027
00:58:39,121 --> 00:58:42,510
you could go hard and fast for three
minutes and maybe it will ensure a faster

1028
00:58:42,511 --> 00:58:44,070
pace for the majority of the fight.

1029
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,440
Then if you made God's
fight five minute rounds,

1030
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:50,190
how often did they get out of ten eight
rounds in boxing when guys get dropped

1031
00:58:50,191 --> 00:58:53,630
quite a bit,
it's pretty common.

1032
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:57,140
It was uncommon for a long time and MMA,
but it's more common now.

1033
00:58:57,141 --> 00:58:58,910
While that was good head
movement there by Canelo,

1034
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:03,500
that's either the rule changes, right?
Yeah. Canelo avoided most of that.

1035
00:59:03,970 --> 00:59:07,430
He's, he's good. Really good
defense there. His defense is tight.

1036
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:11,270
Good movement. Ooh, that's a
good right hand of the body.

1037
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:18,550
It's just like to get to this level.
So it's this,

1038
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:22,070
what's exciting about this fight
is that to get to this level,

1039
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,170
there's so much shit
you got to go through.

1040
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:28,670
It's so rare that a guy comes
out this good, you know,

1041
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:32,870
like there's so few of them and it's even
rare that you get two of them finally

1042
00:59:32,871 --> 00:59:34,770
fighting. Yeah. Like this. Who else?

1043
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:39,400
Who are the top paper view boxers and
you're looking at it right now, man. This,

1044
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:41,720
yeah. What flooded. Who
else? Voids are tired.

1045
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:45,020
Manny Pacquiao is not drawing the
numbers he used to in his last fight,

1046
00:59:45,021 --> 00:59:48,350
he fought and he lost to like
a school teacher. You know,

1047
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:52,670
his time is basically done. Where did
he go to fight? That was a Australia.

1048
00:59:52,970 --> 00:59:55,670
What about in heavyweight division?
No paper view there. Well,

1049
00:59:55,671 --> 01:00:00,470
Anthony Joshua was a huge star in London
and in England and probably in Europe

1050
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:04,640
and the UK. Uh, in America. He's
a big star with boxing fans,

1051
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:07,370
but sorta like how triple g's
a big star with boxing fans.

1052
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:12,200
Canelo's a huge star with actual
Mexicans like across the board.

1053
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:17,010
And maybe, uh, you could say that
about Anthony Joshua with England. I,

1054
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,250
you know, I'm not in England.
Could very well be, oh,

1055
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,900
look at that right hand over
the top. He said No. He said No.

1056
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:24,883
Ah,

1057
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,540
I dunno about that.
Boxing needs to do to,

1058
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,070
to keep the upward. It's
just hard. It's just hard.

1059
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:36,970
He got guys like Terrence Crawford.
He's a bad motherfucker.

1060
01:00:37,330 --> 01:00:40,300
He got Loma Chenko. You've,
you've got some good fighters.

1061
01:00:40,301 --> 01:00:44,380
You've got Andre Ward is one of the best
in the world. The UFC light or the, uh,

1062
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:49,270
boxing light heavyweight champion who's
also the US gold medalist in boxing.

1063
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:52,360
He's a beast. I think we got to do is
get people the fight that they want,

1064
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:54,640
not make them wait for it for two years.
In three years.

1065
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:59,170
That's easier said than done. It's what
helped the UFC. I think much of that.

1066
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,290
And they're shaking the hands at
each other. Oh, this is crazy.

1067
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:07,570
Canelo's weighing some shots.
He's throwing them hard. Mat. Oh.

1068
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:13,160
[inaudible] glove glove gal out a
little bit. Maybe glove again. Glow.

1069
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:18,070
How'd he say it? Come on off.
Kin Calavo again. Colif kin. Ooh,

1070
01:01:18,071 --> 01:01:20,960
this is a good fight. Oh, dropped
his hands. You got popular jam.

1071
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:24,440
Cologne in the back of his pants
be June by June or pianos. Yeah,

1072
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:25,293
that's a cologne.

1073
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,450
This guy Norman used to wear it in a
department store I worked in and he was

1074
01:01:28,451 --> 01:01:30,730
arrested for stealing.
He smelled good.

1075
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,750
Oh, that's hilarious. This
smells. Yeah, he smelled great.
I was like, what is that?

1076
01:01:37,751 --> 01:01:42,280
He's like, by June, people are weird
with their fucking colognes, right? Yeah.

1077
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:45,880
I have a whole fucking shelf. All
of them to, yeah. Yeah. I just,

1078
01:01:45,881 --> 01:01:48,360
I don't know why I liked them until the
compensation I think I used to wear and

1079
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,950
your car. Oh God. Yeah. It was
great. That was like fucking,

1080
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,450
there was like Guido stuff and like,

1081
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:56,020
like 1988 1990 he thought he
had where it get laid. Yeah.

1082
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:58,750
Girls like CEO's. Yeah. Like it.

1083
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,410
For some reason they love it because I
get you got to where it got away with

1084
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:05,350
their like, I don't like a girl to wear
perfume at all. Like I really don't like,

1085
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:08,770
I like natural.
I like the fruity smelling like a,

1086
01:02:08,771 --> 01:02:12,320
the the sweet look at this perfumes.
Ooh,

1087
01:02:12,340 --> 01:02:14,260
not the ground up his son.

1088
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,230
Okay.

1089
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,660
Yeah. No, I don't like any of them. I
wanted it to smell like a fucking gorilla.

1090
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:24,200
Hello? Canelo shook his head, but that,

1091
01:02:24,201 --> 01:02:27,770
that was a bomb that he got hit with it.
Grazed them.

1092
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:35,760
It's weird. Male perfume. It's weird
that we accept that, you know. Oh,

1093
01:02:35,761 --> 01:02:40,260
look at that right hand. Damn
Dude. The Lumpkins porn it on. Oh,

1094
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,000
Golovkin is landing some shots,
man. It's only the sixth round.

1095
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:47,490
This is just the six round.
I don't know.

1096
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:49,550
Oh,
Canelo's was fired back.

1097
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:53,080
That's a hard shot to the body. You heard
him to the body. He heard him to live.

1098
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:57,500
Oh, and he went back to it. Golovkin
is in trouble. He's hurt to the body.

1099
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:00,950
He knows it. Yeah, man. He does know it.

1100
01:03:00,951 --> 01:03:03,240
He hit him with a right
hand and he's landing.

1101
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,960
Oh Shit.
What a turn around.

1102
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:09,640
Okay.

1103
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:12,730
It's so hard to recover from that liver
shot too. You've got to keep moving,

1104
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:18,590
but you're diminished. You've
been hitting the liver. Jim,

1105
01:03:18,591 --> 01:03:21,020
I know you've had a lot of guy's
leg kick you and choke you.

1106
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:23,300
I don't think anyone's ever
purposely punched me in the liver.

1107
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:25,070
I've had a lot of things done.
They're all in pleasant,

1108
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:29,050
but they say that's a pretty bad one.
It's horrible and to fact I,

1109
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:31,110
I'm pretty sure that happened just now.

1110
01:03:31,130 --> 01:03:34,160
Gennady Golovkin and you could
barely tell watching him fight. Ooh,

1111
01:03:34,161 --> 01:03:36,200
get hit in the chest.
They're little high.

1112
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:42,100
Who's a good vibe? It's
so back and forth. Yeah.

1113
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:46,330
I punched the guy in the liver and
the fourth grade didn't do shit. Yeah,

1114
01:03:46,331 --> 01:03:47,740
you got to work on new techniques.
On

1115
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:54,220
the fourth grade means you were nine.
How you should actually hit the liver.

1116
01:03:56,260 --> 01:04:00,580
Totally, Bro. Crushed it.
It's a horrible thing to kick.

1117
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:05,590
Well, people, do you think it's a bit of
liver need? Deliver might be the worst.

1118
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:08,680
That's one of the worst need to deliver.

1119
01:04:08,681 --> 01:04:12,460
As horrifying as a Rhonda
Rousey was so good at that.

1120
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:17,260
She would tie girls up in that judo
clinch and then just need the fuck out of

1121
01:04:17,261 --> 01:04:22,261
their body was ruthless because she was
so good at the like upper body control.

1122
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,300
She could tie you up so well from Judah.
Oh God.

1123
01:04:26,301 --> 01:04:27,640
He Columbia with the
right hand of the body.

1124
01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:32,530
She would just get ahold of girls and
then she started fucking Newcome with

1125
01:04:32,590 --> 01:04:35,050
knees to the body.
She did that to Sara Mcmann.

1126
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:40,720
God Damn, this is good. Yeah.
This is really so tense, right?

1127
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:45,500
I can't think it happened here. Fortunes
can change the drop of a hat. Okay.

1128
01:04:46,970 --> 01:04:49,840
Whew. Canelo is firing them. Huh?

1129
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:58,340
44 49 to 44 power punches.
God dammit. That is so insane.

1130
01:04:58,341 --> 01:05:00,490
Favor of Golovkin.
Is Rhonda coming back you think?

1131
01:05:00,620 --> 01:05:03,530
I don't think she's going to wrestling.
I think it's over. Yeah, I think so.

1132
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,180
I don't think she wants to do it anymore.
You know,

1133
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:11,840
for whatever reason you could break that
down psychologically all day. You know,

1134
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,920
Matt Serra had a great line
that, uh, I never forgot.

1135
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:17,590
He said a long ago

1136
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:22,540
that everybody likes to be the hammer.
Oh yeah.

1137
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:26,410
But nobody wants to be the nail.
Yeah. If you, if you're the nail,

1138
01:05:26,411 --> 01:05:27,090
can you come back?

1139
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,090
Okay.
Yeah.

1140
01:05:28,091 --> 01:05:31,250
And there's always going to be fighters
out there that you can't take down.

1141
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,520
You're going to be forced to stand.
Sure.

1142
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:37,750
And the level of striking right now
with the girls is at an all time high.

1143
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,050
And if you ain't top of on top of your
striking, even if you get really good,

1144
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:43,240
it's still Russian roulette.
These girls are,

1145
01:05:43,310 --> 01:05:47,830
are many like chef
Chenko and Amanda Nunez.

1146
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,950
So Dane, was he going to do, if you can't
take the person down, you have to strike.

1147
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:56,170
And then it becomes a kickboxing battle.

1148
01:05:56,200 --> 01:05:59,320
How good is your kickbox kickboxing
battle where you hope and pray that

1149
01:05:59,321 --> 01:06:01,330
something goes wrong and you get it
to the ground. And you know what?

1150
01:06:01,331 --> 01:06:04,450
Rhonda has good striking.
It's not terrible,

1151
01:06:04,690 --> 01:06:08,080
but even if it was great,
there's a lot of great strikers out there.

1152
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:12,250
So at the end of the day you're going
to be forced to when a kickboxing

1153
01:06:12,251 --> 01:06:15,100
tournament at the very top,
it's going to be very hard.

1154
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:18,520
She didn't wrestle her whole life.
She's doing judo at an Olympic level.

1155
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:23,140
She has great takedowns. She was able
to rag doll most of her opponents,

1156
01:06:23,141 --> 01:06:24,940
but right now man,

1157
01:06:24,941 --> 01:06:27,400
it's going to be very hard for her
to take these girls down right now.

1158
01:06:27,401 --> 01:06:30,310
She's going to be forced to strike.
So then it becomes a, you know,

1159
01:06:30,490 --> 01:06:32,170
she could win some,
she could lose some.

1160
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:36,040
How many people did she beat that Stryker
is as good as Holly Holm? Ronda Nunez?

1161
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:36,933
None.

1162
01:06:37,330 --> 01:06:38,750
No.
None of them were as good as her.

1163
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,310
The only one who was closest cats and
Ghana and she caught cat really linearly.

1164
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,020
First round, right? Yeah. With an arm bar.

1165
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:47,800
Cat just charged data and got caught in
an arm bar. Yeah. I think Rhonda said,

1166
01:06:47,801 --> 01:06:49,280
I think you just catt
deserved better that like she,

1167
01:06:49,281 --> 01:06:50,950
she knew that that was
just a kind of a fluke.

1168
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:53,450
You know what cat said that
the reason why she charged out,

1169
01:06:53,451 --> 01:06:57,610
I like that it's cause like she took a
furious beating and that Amanda Nunez

1170
01:06:57,611 --> 01:06:58,180
fight.

1171
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:02,560
She won the fight but she got fucked up
and that first round like real bad and

1172
01:07:02,561 --> 01:07:04,600
she was like, I didn't want to
go through that again. She goes,

1173
01:07:04,601 --> 01:07:06,610
I just want to charge at
her and get ahold of her.

1174
01:07:08,810 --> 01:07:09,643
Okay.

1175
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:14,480
Imagine of Ronda Rousey decided to on
the girl she couldn't throw or take down.

1176
01:07:14,690 --> 01:07:18,800
Plan B is that flying guard pool.
She had the guard for it.

1177
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:21,260
She has an amazing guard,
amazing arm bar from the guard.

1178
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:25,190
Her plan should have been, in my
opinion, to get the fight to the ground,

1179
01:07:25,191 --> 01:07:27,950
try to be on top, try to use
your Jido. If that didn't work,

1180
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:29,660
we have to go to Poland.
Guard.

1181
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:33,470
Other option with someone like Amanda
Nunez is that's not going to happen.

1182
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,530
You don't think she didn't pull guard on
the [inaudible] as you know on anything,

1183
01:07:36,570 --> 01:07:38,930
you're going to get eaten up and punches.
When he tried to get close,

1184
01:07:38,931 --> 01:07:43,270
Amanda's got some long got us arms. In
order to pull guard, you've got, uh,

1185
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:47,780
you got to pull off a legit shot to get
them to react, to get them to sprawl.

1186
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:48,830
And that's when you pull guard.

1187
01:07:48,831 --> 01:07:51,260
When you're under him and they
sprawl you time and perfect. It's a,

1188
01:07:51,261 --> 01:07:53,270
it's a technique.
It's just like a takedown.

1189
01:07:53,330 --> 01:07:57,530
Was that the biggest problem
of Rhonda, Rhonda? This game?
Your game was all right.

1190
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:00,740
The guards. Amazing. Just like in
that fight with that Sergio Mri,

1191
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:03,320
he was on his back hurt and,

1192
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:06,200
and his opponent wouldn't
get on top of this.

1193
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:08,480
Let's pay attention to this cause
some shit is happening here.

1194
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:15,210
Golovkin cracked him.
We're,

1195
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:20,090
we're still gonna be able to watch the
Rockhold fight to ou. So exciting. Yeah.

1196
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,560
It's only eight 30. This fights nuts, man.

1197
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:27,680
Okay.

1198
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:31,730
He's really impressive. Off the ropes
to Golovkin. I know Alvarez. Oh yeah.

1199
01:08:31,731 --> 01:08:33,950
Well he's impressive. Everywhere
they bolt are. I mean,

1200
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:37,670
these are two legit world champions.
That's why this is so exciting.

1201
01:08:37,700 --> 01:08:40,370
I haven't seen it off a glove down
on the ropes much at all this fight

1202
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:46,310
because he's been taking it to Canelo
and that's his style and when that's

1203
01:08:46,311 --> 01:08:50,270
what's so interesting about this setup
is that everybody knew that Canelo's a

1204
01:08:50,271 --> 01:08:54,730
really good counter puncher.
Scott. Real good timing.

1205
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,660
He just seems a bit too small.
Canelo yeah,

1206
01:08:57,830 --> 01:09:00,400
well that Chad really there's
a size difference man.

1207
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:03,540
There's definitely a size
difference but he's thick, you know?

1208
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,980
I just think frame wise,
I think you're right.

1209
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:11,500
But I think the money is where he's at.
You know? I mean I think this fight,

1210
01:09:11,501 --> 01:09:13,270
he's a big,
big money fight.

1211
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:18,010
Did I don't know how many good fights
there are for him at 54 what big names

1212
01:09:18,011 --> 01:09:21,310
there are. I think he struggles
to make that weight too.

1213
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:28,700
Who Glove given no Canelo I think he
struggles even to make six day and this is

1214
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:34,170
what this is 60 I think one 54 is a real
struggle for him because that's what

1215
01:09:34,261 --> 01:09:38,070
may, whether got them down to one
52 mainly with, it's so smart,

1216
01:09:38,830 --> 01:09:40,710
like just lose a little bit more weight.

1217
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:45,360
We'll talk a little more way
this little hallway. And uh,

1218
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:48,900
the thing about Connor, like what,
what he did to Connor for a smart too,

1219
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:54,150
which was just make them fight, make
them work, get him, get him tired,

1220
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:58,860
and then start putting it to him to
start piling it up, wiring them out,

1221
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,590
piling up, wearing them out. And when you
saw me with her unloading, you're like,

1222
01:10:01,591 --> 01:10:05,520
oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. He's
fucking Floyd Mayweather. He's one of,

1223
01:10:05,521 --> 01:10:09,990
if not the best box or hour. And Connor
did catch them with a couple of things.

1224
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:14,280
Ooh, look at that. Jab
Son. Oh No. Hbo Paper.

1225
01:10:14,281 --> 01:10:17,820
You went blank for a student there.
They all panicked. Can Imagine.

1226
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,690
Let's see.
What do you think here?

1227
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,180
Definitely losing the
rounds, but he, well,

1228
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:30,750
he's putting up a good fight and
I was losing. Oh yeah, yeah. He's,

1229
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,290
he's got like 19 more head
shots for a gloved hand. Yeah.

1230
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:38,580
They have Golovkin ahead. Three to s
three, right? Three point 65 to 68.

1231
01:10:38,581 --> 01:10:41,580
But the thing is, it looks like a
Lufkin is trying to put him away.

1232
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:45,420
He's not just content to beat him.
He's putting massive pressure on him here,

1233
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:46,801
you know,
I mean,

1234
01:10:46,801 --> 01:10:50,610
and you saw canela take a big deep breath
and as we get into the eight, nine,

1235
01:10:50,611 --> 01:10:54,750
10 1112 Canelo fades a little.
He fades a little,

1236
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:58,650
he throws hard power shots and I know he
keeps working hard on his conditioning

1237
01:10:58,651 --> 01:11:03,600
and he works harder than anybody, but
it's just, that style is exhausting. Well,

1238
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,510
plus Galafi wants to put him away because
he hears people talking about his age

1239
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:09,060
too. I mean, you know, everyone is
saying is he, does he have it anymore?

1240
01:11:09,070 --> 01:11:12,810
It's just slowing down. Yeah. That's
a consensus. Oh, shots to the body.

1241
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,040
Good shots of the body

1242
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:18,240
by Canelo.
Well,

1243
01:11:18,241 --> 01:11:20,610
he might've heard him again.
He might have heard him again to the body.

1244
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:22,390
Go Africans not firing at UPMC.

1245
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,533
Ooh,

1246
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:29,560
it's catching his breath. Yeah, you
got it. Rip to the body due to food.

1247
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:36,030
This is such a good fight. This fight.
If every boxing match was like this,

1248
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,980
boxing would be huge. The thing
is genius about Mayweather. He's,

1249
01:11:39,981 --> 01:11:43,710
he managed to never be in one of these.
Yeah, he really did avoid everything.

1250
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:46,110
Avoided it. All of it.
He never got beat up.

1251
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:50,370
He'll get hit clean like seven times,
eight times his whole career.

1252
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:53,640
He's made the most money made way
more than anybody else combined.

1253
01:11:54,090 --> 01:11:56,280
Like double or triple at
least, right? Oh yeah.

1254
01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:00,150
And to me he's for sure the
number one money maker ever.
Oh, without a doubt. Yeah.

1255
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:03,750
Close it. Let's put them
into a billionaire, a
category in the neighborhood,

1256
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,560
you know, who knows exactly
what the deal is and, but dude,

1257
01:12:06,561 --> 01:12:10,950
they got 6.25 something
million paper views.

1258
01:12:11,340 --> 01:12:14,730
That's insane. I wonder what he's
saving up for. I wonder what he wants.

1259
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:17,500
And he doesn't quite have enough
modeling is balling out of control.

1260
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:19,470
Does he owe taxes too?
I think he owes money.

1261
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,090
He owed a little bit before this fight,
but by basketball teams.

1262
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:25,800
Oh look at that upper
cut. The big thing is, um,

1263
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:29,960
him not going too crazy and spending
it on and blowing it all he does.

1264
01:12:30,030 --> 01:12:33,630
He doesn't seem like the, I think they
have one more fight by mansions and shit.

1265
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:38,310
All sorts of Rolls Royces. But, well,
you know, when he got quality cars,

1266
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:43,440
he was like way deep in the
TAC. Oh yeah. Nice Opera Cup.

1267
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:44,274
I can know.

1268
01:12:44,550 --> 01:12:48,150
He was definitely like a big tax trouble
before we got bailed out with a fight

1269
01:12:48,660 --> 01:12:53,130
in the past. Do you think they rematch? I
think they rematch. They should. Why not?

1270
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:58,700
I think Connor would have to beat somebody
good in a boxing match and he would

1271
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:02,730
also have to have a real training camp,
I think.

1272
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,760
I think boxing's over for
Connor. Oh, I don't think so.

1273
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,100
That is one more fight like that.
It gives, people will buy it.

1274
01:13:08,101 --> 01:13:10,180
That just kind of went to the 10th round.
He got fatigued.

1275
01:13:10,181 --> 01:13:14,050
It there's still a motive for people
to buy it. Yeah. I mean, look, he,

1276
01:13:14,140 --> 01:13:17,130
he went the very first fight
against the greatest hour.

1277
01:13:17,550 --> 01:13:21,540
There's so many lights to bag. You're
right. Yeah, you're right. You're right.

1278
01:13:21,541 --> 01:13:25,710
There's that too. But the thing
is if there's a legit big fight,

1279
01:13:25,740 --> 01:13:30,740
like say if Canelo Alvarez steps up
and says that he wants to fight Conor

1280
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,250
Mcgregor, I don't think Conor, I'll do it.

1281
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:39,690
He might realize,
I think Connor made me realize,

1282
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:43,350
you've got to specialize.
Well actually you can't do both.

1283
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,200
Especially the difference
between Canelo and Floyd.

1284
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:47,820
Floyd was just a brilliant boxer.

1285
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:52,870
Canelo is a murderous puncher and
he'll fuck you up, he'll hurt you.

1286
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,260
There's also a promotional difference
to Kyron. Floyd are pretty much they,

1287
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:59,730
they're very similar guys and they
both understood what they were doing

1288
01:13:59,731 --> 01:14:02,070
promotion wise.
I don't know if Canelo is that God,

1289
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,740
while he's not going to promote
it that way, but he's got,

1290
01:14:04,830 --> 01:14:09,030
oh look at that upper cut.
That's his genius. It's,

1291
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:13,270
he's got the support of the American
people does love Lufkin vs Mcgregor.

1292
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:15,430
Okay.

1293
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:19,030
Ooh, look at that. Africa. I, um, I don't
know if Mcgregor would take that fight.

1294
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,990
No, that sounded good. Fight
for him either. Neither.

1295
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:26,350
Canelo Orga Lufkin's a good fight for him.
It's a terrible fight for him.

1296
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:30,280
Those guys are different.
They're, they're, they're,
they're this, you know, like,

1297
01:14:30,281 --> 01:14:31,960
look at what,
the way these guys fight,

1298
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:36,820
especially with this is how
go Lufkin fights every fight
I bring, big drama show.

1299
01:14:39,070 --> 01:14:39,970
That's what he calls it.

1300
01:14:44,490 --> 01:14:45,323
Dude.

1301
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:49,320
I mean, this is one of those fights
were going to be looking back on Sunday.

1302
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,490
Look at those shots of the boss.

1303
01:14:52,350 --> 01:14:55,380
This is one of those fights that
we're going to look back on and go,

1304
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:59,280
you remember when we watched that
fucking fight? Holy Shit. Look at it.

1305
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,480
He just shook his head on him. Golovkin
is putting tremendous pressure on him.

1306
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:07,120
He's trying to break him.
Yeah.

1307
01:15:07,121 --> 01:15:09,010
He's keeping him against the
ropes for 80% of the fire.

1308
01:15:09,070 --> 01:15:12,700
It's not just that like it's a pace that
he's fighting and he's trying to make

1309
01:15:12,701 --> 01:15:16,840
them wither. He sees something.
You think he sees him Fetty yeah,

1310
01:15:16,841 --> 01:15:20,590
he sees him trying to catch some breaks.
He's still super dangerous,

1311
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:22,270
but Golovkin catches.

1312
01:15:22,540 --> 01:15:27,190
He's seen Canelo trying to catch his
breath and that seat is splayed out on the

1313
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:30,820
seat in between rounds. His feet were
all out. Yeah. See if I, if I know this,

1314
01:15:30,821 --> 01:15:32,320
and I don't know that much about boxing,

1315
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:37,600
I know that Canelo has what people think
of as an endurance problem and it's not,

1316
01:15:38,220 --> 01:15:42,190
you know, it's not a big mystery.
He just kind of fades a little bit.

1317
01:15:42,191 --> 01:15:45,910
Who we just got tagged. He just kept
tagged. He might get fired. Oh my God,

1318
01:15:45,911 --> 01:15:50,170
that was bad. Or the big right hand.
Oof. It's not that he doesn't work hard,

1319
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:54,240
it's just that his style is just so
explosive and he's got so much muscle that

1320
01:15:54,241 --> 01:15:55,074
he carries around.

1321
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,280
That style requires you to be in fucking
sensational shape. Well it does. It does.

1322
01:16:00,281 --> 01:16:02,530
It mean anything that is a counter
puncher cause they're always getting hit

1323
01:16:02,531 --> 01:16:05,260
first. So you've got to take a little
bit more to, no, not necessarily.

1324
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:07,030
His defense is outstanding.
Like look at that.

1325
01:16:07,031 --> 01:16:10,330
Look how good he ducked under that
right hand. His defense is amazing.

1326
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:14,230
It's just like he's never been hit like
this before and not with a guy like a

1327
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:15,700
Lufkin is just putting it to him.

1328
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:20,680
He's been hit by a guy like Floyd who
just caught them with good clean scoring

1329
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:24,910
shots. Snapped his head back a couple
of times, but nothing like that.

1330
01:16:24,911 --> 01:16:26,650
Like a mule kicking you in the face.

1331
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:29,410
This is a different thing because
Golovkin is trying to break him.

1332
01:16:29,411 --> 01:16:32,470
He's not just trying to win.
He's putting himself in danger.

1333
01:16:32,770 --> 01:16:35,530
He's putting himself in danger
to prove that he's the best.

1334
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:39,000
And that's a different thing.
That's a different kind of person with,

1335
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,640
he's not making the kind of money that
these guys are making. He's hungry.

1336
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:45,970
It's fuck. See that upper
cut. Ooh Baby. And again,

1337
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:50,260
he's not making the kind of like
superstar money that he just saw Conor and

1338
01:16:50,261 --> 01:16:54,370
Floyd meg and the only way that he can
make it as to being big drama show.

1339
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:59,540
And so he's just coming from for death
once again for this fight. Who knows is,

1340
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:02,340
I think it's probably depending
upon the paper view. Sales. Yeah.

1341
01:17:02,341 --> 01:17:06,120
I literally have no scale for what
these guys make. I, I have no clue.

1342
01:17:07,060 --> 01:17:10,010
You were gonna make it a couple of
million elements. Millions. Canelo is

1343
01:17:10,010 --> 01:17:11,990
a superstar.
He's going to sell.

1344
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:14,960
I mean he would sell fucking
a million paper views.

1345
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:18,470
He was fighting the Uber
driver and I'm not joking.

1346
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:22,910
Ooh,
Ooh.

1347
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:25,650
So he's a bigger draw than GALACTICA.
Oh yeah.

1348
01:17:25,651 --> 01:17:29,860
And I was getting five g tripleG is
getting three. Nice. That was amazing.

1349
01:17:29,861 --> 01:17:34,560
He's 2 million more to know if you know
how famous he is. It makes sense. Yeah.

1350
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:38,430
He's huge. Right? That guy
goes, Viva Mexico and every,

1351
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,140
the fucking roof almost falls off.

1352
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:41,680
Okay.

1353
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,730
I'll tell you what, man,
Mexicans and Irish did.

1354
01:17:45,731 --> 01:17:48,940
They make you reconsider the idea of
patriotism. Very, very proud of people.

1355
01:17:49,570 --> 01:17:52,900
Like when you hear the Irish
people that were in town in Vegas,

1356
01:17:52,901 --> 01:17:56,200
when Connor was fighting,
you ever see that video of Mandalay bay,

1357
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,680
the whole Mandalay bay? What's the
fight? Wasn't even there. Okay.

1358
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:01,480
The whole Mandalay bay filled,

1359
01:18:01,540 --> 01:18:04,900
I mean to where you couldn't walk with
Irish people and they're all singing

1360
01:18:04,901 --> 01:18:09,070
together. Yeah. It was insane.
And that wasn't even where
the fight was being held.

1361
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:11,680
We showed him at the garden outside
in November. It was fucking,

1362
01:18:11,681 --> 01:18:14,560
I was with Matt Serra was freezing outside
and these maniacs have short sleeve

1363
01:18:14,561 --> 01:18:16,900
shirts and tank tops.
Yeah.

1364
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:20,200
Didn't we walk to the garden
together there today about coming,

1365
01:18:20,260 --> 01:18:23,050
leaving the guard? It was, it was
freezing that night. Would remember. Yeah,

1366
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,260
that's right. There was protest in front
of Trump's apartment. Yeah, that's right.

1367
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:30,410
How Fun was that? Oh, it was awesome.
We had a walk, little Jimmy, uh,

1368
01:18:30,411 --> 01:18:33,790
me and a cam and weren't you there young?

1369
01:18:33,791 --> 01:18:37,450
Jamie was Tony there to Brendan
mischief maker was there.

1370
01:18:39,830 --> 01:18:44,280
Look at that. Oof. Oof.

1371
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:46,603
Oof.

1372
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,840
God Damn. Look at those. That left to
the body in that right over the top.

1373
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:52,760
Holy Shit.
What a fight this is.

1374
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:56,210
But we had a walk because there were
so many people protesting Trump.

1375
01:18:58,570 --> 01:19:03,180
Oh, he's done. He's got hurt.
He got hurt. He stumbled.

1376
01:19:03,550 --> 01:19:04,383
Woo.

1377
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:05,813
Yeah.

1378
01:19:05,860 --> 01:19:10,000
Canelo hit him with something. Oh,
look at that jab. Oh my goodness.

1379
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,020
Oh, it again. Oh my God.
This isn't your fight back.

1380
01:19:15,170 --> 01:19:18,740
This is a fucking fight.
And this is the 10th round kids.

1381
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:23,660
Oh my God. This is amazing. I've hardly
ever has to hold. Yeah, pull them apart.

1382
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:26,210
Oh my God. No. These
guys are going for blood.

1383
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:30,560
Golovkin is a fucking savage man.
Savage.

1384
01:19:30,561 --> 01:19:35,330
He's kind of like 82% Genghis Khan
blood. Right? If you've got a gas,

1385
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:40,070
you're right. The rats are good point.
The Ref is not stepping in that much.

1386
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,400
He hasn't had a chance. He just
no need to. This is a warm, yeah.

1387
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:47,270
Especially the way Golovkin fights,
man. What a pace he puts on you.

1388
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:49,670
You just don't get a chance to breathe.

1389
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:53,960
He just on you like he stays in
a phone booth no matter what,

1390
01:19:54,380 --> 01:19:58,430
and there's no brakes. He pops a jab,
you step back, you're right back on.

1391
01:19:58,431 --> 01:19:59,660
You look at this,

1392
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:03,840
he's just right back on him constantly
look at this pressure right hand.

1393
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,020
But you've gotta understand
how terrifying this is.

1394
01:20:07,110 --> 01:20:11,190
You're fighting a guy like
this that doesn't get tired,
continues to push on you,

1395
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:13,950
and like that's why Canelo
has to take some breaks here.

1396
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,480
Then you start just trying
to get out of his way.

1397
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:17,970
He doesn't really want to be
up against the ropes like this.

1398
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:19,590
He has to fight like this.

1399
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:23,160
He really doesn't have the energy to just
meet him in the center and go Kablooey

1400
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,960
at each other.
So go,

1401
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:29,520
go Lufkin's pressure and
constant forward movement.

1402
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:34,380
That's a big factor here. He's controlling
where this fight takes place. A weapon.

1403
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:35,940
Yeah,
it's ring generalship.

1404
01:20:36,150 --> 01:20:40,710
He's completely controlling where the
fight takes place and he showing much more

1405
01:20:40,711 --> 01:20:41,820
desire to win.

1406
01:20:42,150 --> 01:20:46,950
He's trying to stop Canelo Canelo's
trying to catch Golovkin as he's trying to

1407
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:49,350
stop them. There's two very
different things happening here.

1408
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:52,740
It doesn't mean that canal can't
still put the lights out on them,

1409
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:55,710
but what's way more impressive
as what Golovkin is doing?

1410
01:20:55,711 --> 01:21:00,711
He's just swarming a man and could see
Canelo called grabs him after that.

1411
01:21:00,781 --> 01:21:03,270
See that? That's right. He throws
that shot and he grabs them.

1412
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:06,320
It's cause he's wilting lilies. He
has legs. Just give out there dude.

1413
01:21:06,330 --> 01:21:08,910
He's wilting. He is.
He's getting fucked up.

1414
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:12,810
He could still come back hard because
he's a fucking animal and he's a world

1415
01:21:12,811 --> 01:21:17,280
champion. But the bottom line is he
started to fade. We're in the 10th round.

1416
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,620
This shits getting weird.
Look at that.

1417
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,760
He's still got some good head movement
though. I'll tell you that. That was nice.

1418
01:21:23,761 --> 01:21:27,210
The Cardio is tremendous,
right? Credible, tremendous.

1419
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:31,230
Guloff Kins cardios we'll glove gins
and other big bear guy. Is it? Yes,

1420
01:21:31,231 --> 01:21:35,730
he is a big bear guy. Goes to big
bear to train. Same as L. Kukui.

1421
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:39,420
Tony's a savage dude. I've, I've watched
that guy trying for six hours straight.

1422
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:44,130
Tony Ferguson has cardio is fucking
through the roof. Through the roof.

1423
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:46,950
He's an animal. Should see the shit
we're doing up there. Crazy, crazy.

1424
01:21:46,951 --> 01:21:50,820
She loved big bear man and said peaceful
up there. It's cool. What do you do?

1425
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:54,840
Love it. It's fun. You could work
out there at a very high altitude,

1426
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:58,260
low oxygen content in the air.
They say Eddie,

1427
01:21:58,261 --> 01:22:00,750
honestly the best thing to
do is not to train up there.

1428
01:22:00,990 --> 01:22:04,590
They say the best thing to do is
live up there and to train like down,

1429
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:08,910
like to go down to like sea level, like
drive an hour, go down to sea level,

1430
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:14,100
train there and then go do what everything
else up top because your body will

1431
01:22:14,101 --> 01:22:15,510
adapt because the altitude,

1432
01:22:15,511 --> 01:22:19,560
especially when you're sleeping up
there but you'll have more work output.

1433
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:23,730
You'll get more work in with
your body at a seed level. Yeah.

1434
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:29,010
What do I know? I'm not a scientist
son. Do Tony? Donny more work there.

1435
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:31,980
Tony goes forever. No, I'm sure,
but I mean he could be even better.

1436
01:22:31,981 --> 01:22:35,280
It's what I'm saying. I just think that
that's what the science is. I mean,

1437
01:22:35,281 --> 01:22:39,030
it doesn't mean anything. Tony's
obviously adapted to big bear. Well fuck,

1438
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,420
that's such a good fight, man.
Such a good fight, Kevin Lee.

1439
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:48,720
Kevin is, it is a
serious threat. You know,

1440
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:51,600
he's the one who not taking him lightly.
Very serious threat.

1441
01:22:51,630 --> 01:22:55,380
They're both very serious. Look at their
opponents. Tony's been through some,

1442
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:00,480
you know, he fucked up Edson
Barboza, Josh Thompson,

1443
01:23:01,110 --> 01:23:04,530
Rafael dos Anjos, those are
big names. Big giant fight.

1444
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:08,770
Dos Swan was very fucking impressive.
Very impressive.

1445
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,170
That was an incredibly impressive fight.

1446
01:23:11,171 --> 01:23:14,380
And then the other one that was
really impressive to me was a,

1447
01:23:14,381 --> 01:23:19,060
the Barboza Phi because Barboza standup
is top of the food chain and Tony was

1448
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:23,500
cracking him and then finished him in
a crazy bloody Doris who was it wasn't

1449
01:23:23,501 --> 01:23:26,590
that all bloody and everything
on that Doris. Yup. Yup.

1450
01:23:26,920 --> 01:23:31,690
And Edson Barboza is considered probably
top three most dangerous strikers in

1451
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:35,050
the UFC. Oh yeah. That guy will
light you up with wheel kegs head.

1452
01:23:35,051 --> 01:23:37,840
Kevin thinks he's so fast.
He's so powerful.

1453
01:23:37,960 --> 01:23:40,150
Here's the first wheel
kick Kao in the UFC.

1454
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:44,440
You know in the highlight you could see
a Ra should fear in the background going

1455
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:48,970
like this? Yeah, like as he gets hit
and cracked. Terry, he hits Terry.

1456
01:23:48,971 --> 01:23:53,971
Adam with this crazy we'll kick is the
first wheel kick Kayo in the UFC and it

1457
01:23:54,251 --> 01:23:56,230
was the perfect one.
Why it all those stock?

1458
01:23:56,260 --> 01:23:58,570
It seemed like all though I noticed
it in the Frankie Edgar fight,

1459
01:23:58,571 --> 01:24:02,320
it really stopped kicking or throws
a lot less as he oh good question.

1460
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:03,490
It's a very good question.

1461
01:24:03,491 --> 01:24:07,270
It could be because he's got injuries
that don't allow them to kick anymore.

1462
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:10,720
It could be that it's easier for guys
to take him down when he kicks. Huh?

1463
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,880
You'd have to talk to him.
I'd like to talk to him,

1464
01:24:13,630 --> 01:24:15,640
but he didn't use it very much.
A Max Holloway.

1465
01:24:15,641 --> 01:24:19,150
But if you go back to like the Uriah Faber
fight, it was like his biggest weapon.

1466
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:20,830
Yeah. But I noticed it against
frank Yeager. I'm like,

1467
01:24:20,831 --> 01:24:22,750
he's not throwing a lot of
kids. Yeah. I wondered why.

1468
01:24:22,810 --> 01:24:25,660
I thought Frankie was probably try
to time those kicks in. The rematch.

1469
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:27,130
That made total sense to me.

1470
01:24:27,340 --> 01:24:30,250
What didn't make sense as how he
didn't use them that much against Max.

1471
01:24:30,700 --> 01:24:33,820
But you know, max is a motherfucker man.
When he said he wants to box now Josie.

1472
01:24:33,821 --> 01:24:35,800
Although, yeah, yeah, I've heard that.

1473
01:24:35,801 --> 01:24:38,480
But that doesn't take away from
the fact that an MMA fight,

1474
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:43,510
his kicks one of the most deadly weapon
weapons in the sport in his prime man.

1475
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:47,950
He was so fucking good. But like everyone,
it's just like they reach a time, oh,

1476
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,810
golf can caught him with a right hand.

1477
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:51,303
Ooh,

1478
01:24:52,180 --> 01:24:54,880
this is a crazy, crazy fight, man.

1479
01:24:57,810 --> 01:25:02,640
Like you usually don't get these fights.
96 95 Golovkin power punches landed. Wow,

1480
01:25:02,670 --> 01:25:07,220
that's incredible. These guys are
just bad. The cards Atlanta too. Oh,

1481
01:25:07,221 --> 01:25:11,650
the good left hook too.
You know.

1482
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,210
[inaudible] I mean a Canelo router is
absolutely a champion and that's the

1483
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,340
reason why it keeps firing
back and he won't wilt.

1484
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:20,290
And he keeps using good head movement,

1485
01:25:20,291 --> 01:25:24,460
but there's no doubt about Golovkin
is putting it on them. One more round.

1486
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:29,800
So exciting. And then we get to cool
to see David Branch and Luke Rockhold.

1487
01:25:30,250 --> 01:25:34,050
How are we? So lucky I'll at this
some Jesus shit going on. Yeah,

1488
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:36,620
I don't know what that is.
That's got, that's got to be,

1489
01:25:36,621 --> 01:25:40,250
or else can I ask mom or something.
She was like,

1490
01:25:40,251 --> 01:25:43,930
this is got that moment.
Come to Jesus moment.

1491
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,053
Okay.

1492
01:25:47,080 --> 01:25:49,900
Um, Sandra, it looks so much
better at one seven. He doesn't he,

1493
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:52,820
I missed that five but he did get
an a, I'm trying to, I saw this,

1494
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:57,570
the finish put a smash on
Neil Magni put the smash.

1495
01:25:57,580 --> 01:26:02,080
That's how big his legs. Let's a big
giant, massive, yeah. Well he's filled in.

1496
01:26:02,081 --> 01:26:03,860
This is what he gives body
supposed to look like.

1497
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:06,500
He was starving himself.
It's terrible idea. I mean,

1498
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:10,070
he was a beast at one 55 from you
smashing guys and running him over.

1499
01:26:10,071 --> 01:26:13,880
But he got to a point where he really
could not make the weight anymore. I mean,

1500
01:26:13,881 --> 01:26:17,630
he was real in real bad shape.
When you made the wait for Eddie Alvarez,

1501
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:21,590
he's thick man, so thick
dude. And at one 70, I mean,

1502
01:26:21,591 --> 01:26:22,730
he's a fucking animal.

1503
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:26,390
He kicked Neil Magnus legs out from
under him and then he got on top of them.

1504
01:26:26,391 --> 01:26:30,920
And just put the smush on them.
It was just so high level.

1505
01:26:30,980 --> 01:26:31,910
How did he get them down?

1506
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:36,140
A dumbed down with kick kicked his
fucking leg out from under him and then

1507
01:26:36,141 --> 01:26:39,590
jumped on him. Yeah, just jumped
on him. It was a, it was a beating.

1508
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:42,970
I mean it was an Ellis golf. He has
to know. I need to knock out. Yeah,

1509
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:46,580
he's got know
12th round.

1510
01:26:48,770 --> 01:26:49,530
Okay.

1511
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,840
Ooh.
Behind the ear and the clinch.

1512
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:02,330
Ooh, look at that upper cut in the clinch,
pulling the head down, going MMA on him.

1513
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,190
That Jab of fucking Golovkin is so slick.

1514
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:09,510
Oh goodness.
Can Nasa with the by how?

1515
01:27:09,511 --> 01:27:12,510
Shit combination yellow with the Combo.

1516
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,370
Golovkin caught him with a left hook.

1517
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:22,470
Goddamn Golovkin Lufkin has
a chin man tell you that.

1518
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,820
An unbelievable chin

1519
01:27:25,310 --> 01:27:29,570
show shit. Oh Shit. Oh Shit.

1520
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:33,890
What a crazy fun is on. Oh
my God, this is amazing. Oh,

1521
01:27:33,891 --> 01:27:35,390
and Canelo landed her right hand.

1522
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:41,420
This is a crazy fight. Holy
Shit. Look at that top flower.

1523
01:27:41,470 --> 01:27:45,740
The Jab and the right hand real tight
in the clinch. It's constant pressure.

1524
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:49,850
Minute 30 to go. Does he
take over? Does he take over?

1525
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:55,330
Does Canelo have enough to sustain
arms down swinging and missing?

1526
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:58,250
Trying to catch some blood in there,

1527
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:02,150
throwing some punches that just don't
have the steam on him anymore and Golovkin

1528
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:04,800
and of it has to know he's a head and
he's still coming after him. Yeah.

1529
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,410
He's a fucking spider dude.

1530
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:11,650
He's like a spider trying to suck the
blood out of a fly just on you like almost

1531
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:14,870
like just so predator,

1532
01:28:14,871 --> 01:28:18,740
like just constantly look,
it's not backing off.

1533
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:23,630
He's not boxing. This is not a boxing
match. She's trying to fuck him up.

1534
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:27,560
That's the Golovkin style that
makes them so exciting, man.

1535
01:28:27,561 --> 01:28:31,040
That's why Mexican fighters love
him. They do, right? Yeah. Yeah.

1536
01:28:31,041 --> 01:28:35,660
Mexican fight fans are big triple g
fans to the point where his last fight,

1537
01:28:35,661 --> 01:28:38,090
it was a Mooc was grass.
Yes.

1538
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,850
He knows man because he fights like
a world class. Top of the food chain,

1539
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,500
Mexican boxer and a lot of ways.

1540
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:48,420
Okay.

1541
01:28:48,420 --> 01:28:52,710
God Damn, he's good. This
is fucking fantastic. Yeah,

1542
01:28:52,711 --> 01:28:55,770
those are just hitting the gloves. Yeah.
Canal was tired, man. He's real tired.

1543
01:28:55,771 --> 01:29:00,000
There's still 20 something to go,
but he's still hanging in there. Man.

1544
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:03,030
That's that world champion
heart still swinging.

1545
01:29:04,380 --> 01:29:06,810
It doesn't get any better
than this for boxing.

1546
01:29:07,200 --> 01:29:10,170
Especially like after the Conor
Mcgregor Floyd Mayweather fight.

1547
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:14,220
This is a fight that like,
hey, this is how it's done.
Yeah, this is the real deal.

1548
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,770
I mean obviously Floyd did it
how it's supposed to be done,

1549
01:29:16,771 --> 01:29:20,460
but that wasn't two fighters on the
same level. Look at this. This is crazy.

1550
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:25,800
These were absolutely glorious. It's
fine. These are both great moments.

1551
01:29:25,801 --> 01:29:28,620
Or boxing though. The, uh, Mayweather
Mcgregor on this ship, both really,

1552
01:29:28,621 --> 01:29:31,110
really great for boxing. Brendan
Schaub, I should say this,

1553
01:29:31,111 --> 01:29:32,610
before the decision gets announced,

1554
01:29:32,790 --> 01:29:37,790
said that if Golovkin didn't win
by some ungodly lopsided beat down,

1555
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,920
that he could lose the decision
crew because of corruption. He goes,

1556
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:47,460
cause that's how boxing roles and there's
way more money and Canelo winning.

1557
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:52,860
So that's sad. Now that we know that
[inaudible] sponsor. That's true. Well,

1558
01:29:52,861 --> 01:29:57,330
apparently the audiences are like half
Mexican. He's a superstar in Mexico.

1559
01:29:57,720 --> 01:29:59,700
Just a super steady talking about Canelo.
Yeah.

1560
01:30:00,180 --> 01:30:03,900
So let's see if Brendan shop predicted
this correctly because we think it has to

1561
01:30:03,901 --> 01:30:05,080
be Golovkin the rap,
the,

1562
01:30:05,090 --> 01:30:09,540
the unofficial scorecard guy had
it for Golovkin by several rounds.

1563
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,930
We think it was go Lufkin clearly.
Although Candela fought a great fight,

1564
01:30:14,010 --> 01:30:17,080
have there been bad decision
if Canelo wins have there,

1565
01:30:17,700 --> 01:30:20,610
what was the last time there was
a decision like that? Tim Bradley,

1566
01:30:20,611 --> 01:30:24,510
Manny Pacquiao who won that and
I believe Bradley one, but pack,

1567
01:30:24,511 --> 01:30:28,470
y'all should have one. And then came
back and outboxed him. It was worse.

1568
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:33,660
It was worse. If I remember
correctly, I said, what was
the reasoning of that? Boom,

1569
01:30:33,780 --> 01:30:38,550
boom, boom. Oh Jesus, they're
shown hello. Oh my goodness.

1570
01:30:38,551 --> 01:30:42,220
This is the last round that was Chanel
just tried to put it to him and glove and

1571
01:30:42,221 --> 01:30:46,570
he's like, come on, come on, come
on. I'm from Kazakhstan. Boom.

1572
01:30:48,170 --> 01:30:50,100
Just boom over the top.

1573
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:53,360
God Damn just war here.

1574
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:56,190
Leave that had just paid back every
punch he took in a combination.

1575
01:30:56,410 --> 01:31:00,690
Just sharp jab to his jam.
So snappy. Okay. Turns it.

1576
01:31:02,980 --> 01:31:07,950
Give me a guest. Eddie
Bravo for sure. Glove again,

1577
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:11,010
for sure. Right. Unless there's, unless
there's corruption, like Brendan says,

1578
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:15,290
he's not crazy to say that. I doubt
it. They're getting garage pad. We're,

1579
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:19,860
we're saying this, look at this. They
got at one 16 one 12 for Golovkin Hara.

1580
01:31:19,861 --> 01:31:24,450
Let him in here. Harold led. They gave
that last, Lufkin ran away with it.

1581
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,280
They gave ten nine on that last fight.

1582
01:31:26,940 --> 01:31:30,420
I mean that last round to fucking know
Canelo yeah. You know what I really like?

1583
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:31,770
I don't know why they did that.

1584
01:31:32,010 --> 01:31:35,820
I like how these girls just stand there
and smile. They're doing really good job.

1585
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:39,780
They're always smiling. It
seems easy, but it's hard.

1586
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:43,890
You got to be frozen and fucking clapping
and it drives me crazy. I hate it.

1587
01:31:43,950 --> 01:31:46,320
I love it.
I love the f their focus,

1588
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:51,150
they're focused on not being even
remotely normal. This Adelaide bird,

1589
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:52,620
the job,
their focus,

1590
01:31:52,621 --> 01:31:57,360
their job is to stand there and smile in
Assam psychotic way. If they were a guy,

1591
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:58,920
like if they were a guy,
if you were,

1592
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:02,530
if they hired a guy to stand there in a
nice suit and tie and stand there like

1593
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:03,280
this,

1594
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:08,020
could you fucking imagine how crazy
it would be if you hired guys to stand

1595
01:32:08,021 --> 01:32:11,500
behind fighters with giant smiles
on their face and just not,

1596
01:32:11,530 --> 01:32:14,380
especially if they were in their
underwear. Just imagine that.

1597
01:32:15,310 --> 01:32:18,820
Imagine guys in a speedo
standing there like ripped,

1598
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:22,810
like holding it to caught tay sign with
a big giant smile on their face that

1599
01:32:22,811 --> 01:32:24,900
happens on Santa Monica Boulevard going,

1600
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:28,000
it doesn't happen during a big
final paper view. Any Bravo,

1601
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,170
you silly goose one day when,
hey, let's hear the volume.

1602
01:32:32,920 --> 01:32:34,600
Let's here it is this a
split decision to know

1603
01:32:46,190 --> 01:32:48,620
told you son.
Oh boy,

1604
01:32:48,621 --> 01:32:52,120
they fucking boxing fucking stinks.
Toads,

1605
01:32:52,121 --> 01:32:56,600
you son boxing in Shaw.
Apokyn is the sage. Brendan.

1606
01:32:56,630 --> 01:33:00,860
Brendan Schaub as a sage fucking stinks.
Why is he mad?

1607
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,990
Cause he knows.
He knows he got fucked.

1608
01:33:03,020 --> 01:33:05,660
You know Canelo well he's
going to feel terrible now.

1609
01:33:05,870 --> 01:33:09,470
He knows he got his ass Catsa
draw. There's no way. That's
how it was that a draw?

1610
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,500
No, it's, hold on second,

1611
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:21,560
he's asking to see if he was happy then
that would mean that he thought he lost.

1612
01:33:21,790 --> 01:33:25,060
So the fact that he looks pissed
that smart. He's gonna shoot a one.

1613
01:33:25,070 --> 01:33:27,320
This is bullshit.
He's tiny notes.

1614
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:31,310
[inaudible] 69 I think he's
mad because he didn't win.

1615
01:33:31,370 --> 01:33:34,580
He threw 200 punches. Didn't
win. But he's definitely mad.

1616
01:33:34,610 --> 01:33:38,460
Did he got outbox and they made it
a draw? I did 50 more punches. Yeah.

1617
01:33:38,470 --> 01:33:42,620
The fuck is that a draw?
It's not even close to that though.

1618
01:33:42,621 --> 01:33:46,180
There are punches different though.
There you go. That's the difference too.

1619
01:33:47,990 --> 01:33:52,040
Maybe I'll go higher percentage.
Oh, I can't stand it. Yeah,

1620
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:56,630
but it's a higher number. Landed two one
14 and one 10 and total power punches.

1621
01:33:58,320 --> 01:34:02,580
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, all right. Jab,

1622
01:34:02,581 --> 01:34:05,910
weird thing though. When you're looking
at numbers wise, I mean it's one,

1623
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,260
it's one way or looking at it,

1624
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:12,210
but like one big shot that's a power
punch and then another power punch.

1625
01:34:12,211 --> 01:34:14,670
It doesn't do anything. They're both
power punches. You know what I'm saying?

1626
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:19,290
Like one shot that really fucks you up
and your legs go and you get wobbly.

1627
01:34:19,410 --> 01:34:23,730
That's a power punch and another power
punches his shot that lands in the same

1628
01:34:23,731 --> 01:34:26,370
spot but doesn't do anything. They're
both powerful. Are these colors mean?

1629
01:34:26,371 --> 01:34:29,220
What are the, what is it? You know what
I'm saying? What is the blue ear? Maine.

1630
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:34,410
I don't know. Look at the
number of punches that, uh,
landed on [inaudible] face.

1631
01:34:34,620 --> 01:34:39,620
Hundred nine on his right side and a
95 on his left to 10 landed to one 27.

1632
01:34:40,260 --> 01:34:40,450
Yeah.

1633
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:44,400
Big Difference in how many landed to
the head getting 40 level or landed way

1634
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:46,720
more he made,
made,

1635
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,520
said only four shots were
landed to Canelo's body.
That doesn't make any sense.

1636
01:34:50,730 --> 01:34:54,300
Is that what it really what said and
see what he says here. Let's hear this

1637
01:34:56,870 --> 01:34:57,703
tonight.

1638
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,090
What happened tonight?

1639
01:35:02,350 --> 01:35:03,183
What happened tonight?

1640
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:07,810
Today?
Really Big Mexican day.

1641
01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:11,230
All my friends romance about

1642
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:18,430
good move. Go right to the Mexican
fans. Fucking smart move. Oh,

1643
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,510
able to neutralize you,

1644
01:35:20,511 --> 01:35:25,511
especially early in the fight and have
success late when it looked like you and

1645
01:35:25,751 --> 01:35:30,050
started to build the lead.
I want to,

1646
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:33,150
we probably can't play this without
getting yanked off of a youtube,

1647
01:35:33,151 --> 01:35:34,800
so we're going to go to the other way.
How?

1648
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:37,770
How is it first of all that I
didn't think that last fight was a,

1649
01:35:37,830 --> 01:35:42,210
I mean that last round
was a ten nine Canelo no.

1650
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,470
How was he not fucking angry about
this? I mean, why am I angry about it?

1651
01:35:45,510 --> 01:35:50,430
Don't we get shit? Big Drama show two
19 if he wins, he retains his belt,

1652
01:35:50,431 --> 01:35:52,590
so nothing really changes for
him and he gets all that money.

1653
01:35:52,591 --> 01:35:54,840
Now that your record in the
rematch is going to be insane.

1654
01:35:54,870 --> 01:35:57,300
The rematch will be insane.
Those dollars

1655
01:35:58,950 --> 01:36:03,790
to 19 good job by Brendan Man.
Fucking good call. Yeah, box.

1656
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:08,010
All the fighters were amazing, but
the organizational, it just stinks.

1657
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:13,320
Brendan. Nailed it. Can you hear this?
Are you, are you guys hearing this? What?

1658
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:18,090
No. Okay. What am I hearing? What
he thought? Oh No, no, no. The TV,

1659
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,340
you know,
I don't want to hear in here.

1660
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,840
He's not saying I got really
lucky that they gave me that draw.

1661
01:36:24,841 --> 01:36:25,740
I don't want to hear what he's saying.

1662
01:36:26,270 --> 01:36:30,300
If he thinks he wanted his stupid still
owes a great fight. Amazing. I love it.

1663
01:36:31,230 --> 01:36:33,690
I don't eat, I mean I do
care, but I don't care.

1664
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:37,560
I do care that I think that I thought
they're going to go off in one,

1665
01:36:37,561 --> 01:36:42,080
but I don't care. It's great fight.
I like seeing great fights. I don't,

1666
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:45,990
decisions means less to me as I get older
because I looked at it and like, okay,

1667
01:36:45,991 --> 01:36:46,531
what am I doing?

1668
01:36:46,531 --> 01:36:51,531
I'm basing like how I feel about something
based on an inaccurate assessment by

1669
01:36:52,921 --> 01:36:55,230
people that don't necessarily
know what they're doing.

1670
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:59,190
Like what I take advice on whether or
not an episode of game of Thrones is good

1671
01:36:59,191 --> 01:37:01,050
from three people I
thought were knuckleheads.

1672
01:37:01,770 --> 01:37:04,680
Like what if there's like three
judges for TV shows? Like,

1673
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:08,640
well the game of Thrones finale, you
know, I gave it an a 100 you know,

1674
01:37:08,641 --> 01:37:13,560
let's go to these judges don't we decided
it gets a 40 no fucking way. Right?

1675
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:15,630
And you go to school the next day like,
dude,

1676
01:37:15,631 --> 01:37:20,430
you hear fucking game of Thrones
final got a 40 bro. We lost it.

1677
01:37:20,431 --> 01:37:24,140
Got a little ridiculous at the end.
Shut your mouth. Oh my gosh. Let's see.

1678
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:29,110
One show. Come on. Okay, let
me ask you a couple questions.

1679
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,001
I loved it.

1680
01:37:30,001 --> 01:37:34,920
I remember when they first escaped the
white walkers didn't like the water.

1681
01:37:34,921 --> 01:37:35,910
Have something to do with it.

1682
01:37:35,911 --> 01:37:39,000
Like pick out on a boat and it's for some
reason they can't get in water, right?

1683
01:37:39,001 --> 01:37:40,300
That's the thing, right? Right.

1684
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:45,440
But their eyes are you spoiler alert
in the fucking oil or something.

1685
01:37:45,550 --> 01:37:49,680
They at something. Don't do
something about the water. Right.

1686
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:50,610
They can't hang it.

1687
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:55,640
There was a few horse when who
the fuck tied chains around

1688
01:37:56,070 --> 01:38:00,420
that dragon and dragged it up who went
scuba diving in and tied that dragon up?

1689
01:38:00,421 --> 01:38:03,310
You'd probably have to assume who
had the are they that's wrong.

1690
01:38:03,311 --> 01:38:05,550
They're not that strong because
those dudes are fucking them up.

1691
01:38:05,551 --> 01:38:06,480
They're not that strong.

1692
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:09,750
Who's carrying those gigantic
chains down there underwater?

1693
01:38:09,870 --> 01:38:13,770
Tie Up the dragon and drag it up. Who's
doing that? Well, they're all dead,

1694
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:16,170
so they probably don't give a shit
over a kilometer. They couldn't go.

1695
01:38:16,670 --> 01:38:20,720
They can't get into water. He's right. So
how did they do a big hole? A big hole?

1696
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,480
I'll accept the drag. The
accepted slept. Very good point.

1697
01:38:24,660 --> 01:38:26,010
It's a drag and I can accept.

1698
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:28,650
That's a very legitimate happens when
they hit the water that I don't remember.

1699
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:31,830
I don't like water but they don't like it,
but no ties to drag him.

1700
01:38:31,831 --> 01:38:36,120
I'm getting to ships, so islands like
a keeping them from going to an island.

1701
01:38:36,120 --> 01:38:38,490
That's why these other guys are like,
fuck this, I'm going to an island.

1702
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:40,230
I'm going to wait on the iron island.

1703
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:43,660
Is it possible that just one
of the things down, they,

1704
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:46,440
they cannot get into
water for some reason.

1705
01:38:46,441 --> 01:38:50,370
They established that several times
and then all of a sudden they cut.

1706
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:50,760
They don't,

1707
01:38:50,760 --> 01:38:55,410
they don't show how they tied this
God damn dragon up with the chain.

1708
01:38:55,950 --> 01:38:59,940
It's like one of those chains that
you hold navy ships to port, you know,

1709
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:04,170
and who typed them up.
They just cut to then dragging them out.

1710
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:07,290
Watching that dragon get pulled out.
I can suspend a little bit. I can,

1711
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:10,770
I can live with the inconsistency of the
dead people dragging the dragon out of

1712
01:39:10,771 --> 01:39:14,820
the ice water. I can on consistency. I
can live with that. But I'm, I'm with him.

1713
01:39:14,821 --> 01:39:17,580
I didn't even notice that when I
was in a show. I didn't need that.

1714
01:39:17,581 --> 01:39:19,860
They went in the water and I
love game of Thrones. Ma'Am.

1715
01:39:19,890 --> 01:39:24,120
I haven't this shit that just got
me fucked up. Yeah, they fucked up.

1716
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:26,940
It's a big hole. You're right. Big.
Hello. God Damn it. You're right.

1717
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,610
Maybe like in the last uh,
episodes,

1718
01:39:29,611 --> 01:39:33,930
they'll show how the fuck they tied that
dragon up or maybe we should set up big

1719
01:39:33,931 --> 01:39:37,370
ass. Stupid whole. Yeah. And did
anyone catch it? And you know,

1720
01:39:37,371 --> 01:39:40,170
what do they say? Fuck
it. Let's do it anyway.

1721
01:39:40,171 --> 01:39:44,100
Bothers me is we're led
to believe that these,

1722
01:39:44,160 --> 01:39:48,080
these different kingdoms like a
king's landing and all that are like,

1723
01:39:48,290 --> 01:39:51,360
like for like countries away.
But man,

1724
01:39:51,420 --> 01:39:53,820
they are traveling to damn quick.

1725
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:57,540
They get from one city to the next city
that at the wall and then they meet and

1726
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:02,180
then the snow in The Bahamas walking
over mountains like, dude, this,

1727
01:40:02,190 --> 01:40:05,250
this can take months. She
told double. It's like,

1728
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:09,840
it's almost like that whole kingdom
is like, like Redondo Beach,

1729
01:40:09,870 --> 01:40:13,830
West Hollywood,
North Hollywood comped in

1730
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:16,180
20 minutes.

1731
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:20,730
This is Mike Perry was supposed to
be Mike Perry versus a Tiago Alvarez.

1732
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:23,280
He could get to Florida.
Right? Is that what he said?

1733
01:40:23,281 --> 01:40:25,500
He couldn't get out of Florida
others? Is that what happened? Yeah,

1734
01:40:25,770 --> 01:40:28,290
he was stuck in Florida and my
parents that we came up early,

1735
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:33,540
so I don't want to hear that shit.
Is that really what happened?

1736
01:40:33,570 --> 01:40:35,580
I believe so, yeah. That's terrible.

1737
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,670
Do you ever think like when they showed
the army's walking through like fucking

1738
01:40:38,671 --> 01:40:43,530
no man's land, like who's carrying the
fucking food and where? Where's the water?

1739
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:46,950
Hey Bro, you're fucking my high.
What are they taking shirts?

1740
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:51,810
I always think that the budget is taking
shit. That's a good point. Like where,

1741
01:40:51,811 --> 01:40:53,400
what kind of sewage system do help

1742
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:54,430
you?

1743
01:40:54,430 --> 01:40:59,410
Just walking across deserts and
shot shitting in ancient Rome.

1744
01:40:59,650 --> 01:41:01,600
Taking pisses in every
scene in the background.

1745
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:03,900
There was a big issue in ancient Rome,
like they,

1746
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:07,510
people got diseases cause they would shit
in the streets. Let's talk about that.

1747
01:41:07,511 --> 01:41:11,620
Let's bring that in. Making
it more realistic. I see
more shit. You're right man.

1748
01:41:12,440 --> 01:41:15,370
Like come on.
Like explain how these fuckers are eating.

1749
01:41:15,371 --> 01:41:18,340
I'd love to see Khaleesi dropping a deuce
off the side of that fucking castle.

1750
01:41:18,341 --> 01:41:20,650
How great would that be?
That'd be great. Oh Man.

1751
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:25,340
Maybe the queen maybe
like she's shots shots,

1752
01:41:25,730 --> 01:41:29,990
tight shots where they show Khaleesi
on the tracking. I don't care for that.

1753
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:35,380
Remember the Superman TV show?
She's the mother of dragons.

1754
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:36,970
You don't think she knows
how to ride a dragon?

1755
01:41:37,290 --> 01:41:39,490
I was barely going and
she's barely holding on.

1756
01:41:39,491 --> 01:41:42,420
Somebody's watching you in a
Jujitsu match like, oh come on man.

1757
01:41:42,420 --> 01:41:43,800
He strangle that guy with his legs

1758
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:49,300
now and then she got to fall off the
dragon every now and someone almost too.

1759
01:41:49,340 --> 01:41:52,210
I drag. Oh No, that was the
Harry Potter ride fall off.

1760
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:55,600
She's got to fall off one or
to once or twice. Come on, man.

1761
01:41:55,601 --> 01:41:56,900
She's just like barely grip.

1762
01:41:56,940 --> 01:42:00,610
I hate those shots when they go to her
of riding the Dragon. It drives me nuts.

1763
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:05,350
John Wayne shows are both gay for each
other cause I thought that was the most

1764
01:42:05,351 --> 01:42:08,590
awesome. Don't get me
wrong. I love it. I love it.

1765
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,310
When she was riding that dragon,

1766
01:42:11,320 --> 01:42:15,180
I was standing up cheering cause it looks
green screen it look better without it

1767
01:42:15,370 --> 01:42:17,200
kind of weird that all
the rulers are women.

1768
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:20,380
Like what kind of some feminist shit?
Murder.

1769
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,330
Just keep that murder coming
and I'm happy. Look at it.

1770
01:42:22,331 --> 01:42:27,160
So let's look up fake that Louis.
Dude. Come on man. That's terrible.

1771
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:28,300
Hold it out of that dragon.

1772
01:42:28,360 --> 01:42:31,180
Do you know how many spikes would be
inside of her pussy right there? Yeah.

1773
01:42:31,630 --> 01:42:32,580
I mean we're here.

1774
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:36,730
Where is it safe to stick your box?

1775
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:41,290
You're going to ride that thing between
bikes. Look at the size of the spikes.

1776
01:42:41,490 --> 01:42:44,400
How gross the yard.
Scary and pointy by disease

1777
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:47,720
group strength.
What's credible?

1778
01:42:47,870 --> 01:42:51,160
Never show her training
strengths out of this world.

1779
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,950
She should have like a rock
climbing wall in her castle.

1780
01:42:54,010 --> 01:42:57,070
Maybe she takes one of those spikes
and she puts it down in her posting.

1781
01:42:57,071 --> 01:43:00,310
She's lamps hold of it and that's
how she goes the whole time.

1782
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:04,780
She just has a spot she had locked
in like a ball and socket joint.

1783
01:43:05,290 --> 01:43:08,200
I was just another really bad one, but
it's called dragon's way bigger than that.

1784
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:09,580
Like yeah,
the dragon's way,

1785
01:43:09,970 --> 01:43:12,370
way bigger than hate the way she's
holding on and you're right. Our whole,

1786
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:17,180
when they show the drag and sometimes
it looks tremendous. Huge. Yeah.

1787
01:43:17,181 --> 01:43:19,870
This is old episode. That's
like a Moray Eel, right?

1788
01:43:19,900 --> 01:43:23,110
It might be smaller than it
might be younger. Oh, that
might've been earlier days.

1789
01:43:23,170 --> 01:43:26,830
Oh, you're right. You're right. You're
right. You're right. You're right. Okay,

1790
01:43:26,831 --> 01:43:29,930
I'm wrong. Did you have any that she
used it to kill a bunch of people, man.

1791
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:33,210
Some people know some of the last
episodes. Didn't she get out of the chain?

1792
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:36,330
Look got big. It was there. Oh my
God. That's a full grown drag. Okay.

1793
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,650
Hold on a second. Look
at that thing. Dude,

1794
01:43:38,651 --> 01:43:43,270
that's bad and moving to the dragon is
amazing. I know that motherfucker CGI,

1795
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:46,960
but when that, when that White Walker
through that spear, I was like,

1796
01:43:46,961 --> 01:43:50,710
when it missed this the first
time, like, oh cool. I know.

1797
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:53,570
I feel like it's alive.

1798
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:58,040
Leave versus forgot me with the
drag and Johnson versus Borg again.

1799
01:43:58,160 --> 01:44:02,420
It was a virus though, right? Did they
kept him out? He's missed weed a lot. Oh,

1800
01:44:02,450 --> 01:44:06,440
he's Ms. Wade a lot.
Ray Borg is miss wait several times.

1801
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:09,560
And uh, I don't know if he got
sick while he was cutting weight,

1802
01:44:09,561 --> 01:44:14,390
if other people around him, but
it's just, you know, got, you can't,

1803
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:19,130
boy, it's a big opportunity to get
sick for and it can happen for sure.

1804
01:44:19,131 --> 01:44:23,240
But yeah, I guess they have
to do it again. They are,

1805
01:44:23,300 --> 01:44:25,620
they already trained for it. Oh, well.

1806
01:44:25,700 --> 01:44:30,700
Well one of the judges gave it one
18 the one 10 for Canelo Adelaide.

1807
01:44:31,410 --> 01:44:36,000
Yeah. Adelaide. Bert Adelai
bird did that. Was it? I mean,

1808
01:44:36,630 --> 01:44:38,370
what's that about her record in the UFC?

1809
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:42,460
Terrible one 18 and one 10
for Canelo had they bird.

1810
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:46,350
That's so crazy that a woman or a man,
she's a woman. She's very nice lady.

1811
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:50,850
Wow. There's that fucking bad she's
going to get towards for that. No,

1812
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,090
that's terrible.
How she stays offline and they have no,

1813
01:44:54,091 --> 01:44:56,190
but they have no accountability.
It doesn't matter. No, it doesn't.

1814
01:44:56,210 --> 01:44:59,340
Nothing happens to them. They just
keep right on being fucking horrible.

1815
01:44:59,341 --> 01:45:03,560
That that's terrible. Yeah, it's
not good. I better pissed jeans.

1816
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,430
There was one woman who got,

1817
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:11,600
she got in serious trouble for several
really bad decisions and she wound up

1818
01:45:12,511 --> 01:45:15,420
retiring because it was like
people were threatening our life.

1819
01:45:18,820 --> 01:45:22,960
Mike Perry's a bad motherfucker.
He's scary. It's hard.

1820
01:45:23,120 --> 01:45:27,670
See that Jake Ellenberger fight if
I dunno,

1821
01:45:27,671 --> 01:45:32,650
a casino owner or whoever is running
like the gambling, the guy at the top of,

1822
01:45:32,651 --> 01:45:36,550
he wanted to it just say it in a
different, yeah. If you wanted to rig it,

1823
01:45:36,700 --> 01:45:39,220
would you go after? How would you do
go after the judges or the fighter?

1824
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,890
You got your explanation. Two explanation
for the game of Thrones thing. Okay.

1825
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,820
Multiple tweets have come that
said that they can't swim,

1826
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:48,520
but they can go and water. They
just sink to the bottom. Oh,

1827
01:45:48,521 --> 01:45:51,250
so they sacrificed them. Yeah,
but who's carrying those chains?

1828
01:45:51,251 --> 01:45:54,100
They're not strong enough to carry those
strings. Those chains were gigantic.

1829
01:45:54,390 --> 01:45:56,790
[inaudible] steel is,

1830
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:00,970
can they get hundreds of them dragging
him? They just sink. But wait a minute.

1831
01:46:00,971 --> 01:46:03,550
They drag the dragon. How did their
strong, I have to drag the dragon out.

1832
01:46:03,550 --> 01:46:05,860
Why are they strong enough
to take the chains in?

1833
01:46:06,200 --> 01:46:07,360
A lot of doesn't make any sense.

1834
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:10,600
There's still less holes now or whoever
to put them down there is still done.

1835
01:46:10,630 --> 01:46:14,020
Make sense? He just sacrifice them. Let
them stay at the bottom of the water.

1836
01:46:14,200 --> 01:46:16,560
They can't get out. That doesn't
make sense. So they're just walking.

1837
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:20,530
Just walk out how you're going to just
walk out hard. It'd be to chain him up.

1838
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:23,710
Even if you had cranes and all
this shit. The chain. Nothing up.

1839
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:27,580
You'd have to have James Cameron down
there with that little submarine trying to

1840
01:46:27,581 --> 01:46:31,240
scope it out for awhile.
Done that shit up like the titanic.

1841
01:46:31,930 --> 01:46:36,370
Keith Peterson. Another
excellent refereeing. That
would be way harder. Titanic.

1842
01:46:36,371 --> 01:46:38,980
A dead body. No, it wouldn't
be hard than the titanic.

1843
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:43,110
Titanic's like miles deep into the water.
Yeah. 13,000 feet down. Yeah, some.

1844
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:46,400
It's crazy. How good its deal and as
shit to hook on. You could just look,

1845
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:49,440
go hook it up. This, Ooh.

1846
01:46:50,360 --> 01:46:53,100
My concern is usually, does
it usually look like that? No,

1847
01:46:53,101 --> 01:46:56,850
he's going Jersey shore for this fight is,
he's a ruthless guy though.

1848
01:46:56,851 --> 01:47:00,630
Super Powerful fucking knockout
artists. Very dangerous. Yeah.

1849
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:03,210
We knocked out Ellenberger.
I was like, wow,

1850
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:07,140
he's just real reckless and angry.
Allen Joe,

1851
01:47:07,141 --> 01:47:11,220
Ben handled them know Joe Band did a
really good job. He had one last smart.

1852
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:16,170
I think that's his loss. I think
that's as lost. But you know,

1853
01:47:16,171 --> 01:47:17,160
that's a good fight for him.

1854
01:47:17,220 --> 01:47:22,220
Joe Ban fought a technical fight and beat
him and for a guy like Mike Perry was

1855
01:47:22,740 --> 01:47:26,490
super dangerous up and come and do. That's
a good fight for him. Learn something,

1856
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:30,480
you know, got leg kick there. As
long as they just learn, you know,

1857
01:47:30,481 --> 01:47:32,040
as long as fighters don't get discouraged,

1858
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:34,940
fights like that are always good for them
because then you just realize there's

1859
01:47:34,950 --> 01:47:38,270
a higher level and the only way
to reach that higher levels.

1860
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:43,280
You gotta you gotta see it
woo fuck room or is this live?

1861
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:48,030
I was alive. Yeah. Yeah.

1862
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:52,020
Kids, fucking ferocious man. Look at
that knee to the head. Look at this.

1863
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:55,740
Fucking fighting him off. So good
tie right there. Hey, good, good.

1864
01:47:55,741 --> 01:47:59,790
Moitai good clinching, but most
importantly, like just relentless attack.

1865
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:03,420
Look at a boom, that elbow on the clicks.
Boom. There's any, that's it. That's it.

1866
01:48:04,860 --> 01:48:07,380
Ruthless.
He's a ruthless motherfucker.

1867
01:48:07,530 --> 01:48:12,090
That guy is relentless and it's just
like all attack. It's all attack,

1868
01:48:12,091 --> 01:48:15,060
all full bore all out.

1869
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,790
Just trying to smash you all the way.

1870
01:48:18,060 --> 01:48:22,920
The guy that's going to beat him is a
guy like Joe Ban who's going to fight a

1871
01:48:22,921 --> 01:48:27,090
very smart technical stand up fight.

1872
01:48:27,270 --> 01:48:31,170
Like Joe Band did a lot of footwork, a
lot of movement, but he also made him pay.

1873
01:48:31,350 --> 01:48:33,360
He made sure that like when it
comes charging out, I'm like,

1874
01:48:33,361 --> 01:48:34,980
you're not gonna get away with that.
Like boom.

1875
01:48:34,981 --> 01:48:36,630
We would catch them with some
stuff and you realize like, oh,

1876
01:48:36,660 --> 01:48:41,610
this guy can hurt me.
It was enough for him to keep Perry off.

1877
01:48:41,611 --> 01:48:44,330
I'm a look at this shit. Elbow and
tight. That's nice. That's nice.

1878
01:48:44,340 --> 01:48:48,540
I'll get this dough.
I limit limp Ville population one,

1879
01:48:48,570 --> 01:48:51,170
Bam hammer fists to the back of the year.

1880
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:54,660
Did this guy have any kind
of camp them? No, he did not.

1881
01:48:54,690 --> 01:48:58,740
I don't see a lot of Thai clinches.

1882
01:48:59,370 --> 01:49:02,700
Well remember Anderson and rich
Franklin knows enough for like 10 years.

1883
01:49:02,730 --> 01:49:04,050
Do you think it's because,

1884
01:49:04,290 --> 01:49:07,740
because obviously it's a clinch that has
a thousand levels and we need a lot of

1885
01:49:07,741 --> 01:49:08,010
work.

1886
01:49:08,010 --> 01:49:12,360
Do you think it's because most fighters
don't specifically work on developing

1887
01:49:12,361 --> 01:49:12,991
that clenching,

1888
01:49:12,991 --> 01:49:15,750
controlling people from like clench
and their training camps or it's just

1889
01:49:15,751 --> 01:49:19,890
something that's low percentage in MMA?
Not,

1890
01:49:20,150 --> 01:49:21,240
it's not that it's low percentage.

1891
01:49:21,241 --> 01:49:25,170
It's there's less of a chance of getting
in an MMA because you're essentially

1892
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,300
allowing to got to get
double under hooks on here.

1893
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:30,810
I mean if you think about
what you're doing when you're
clenching someone's head,

1894
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:32,580
Anderson was so good at it,
man.

1895
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:35,700
He had such a tight squeeze
and it's like anything else.

1896
01:49:35,701 --> 01:49:38,700
Like you know how like some people
just have a sick Gabe cable grip.

1897
01:49:38,701 --> 01:49:42,310
Some people just have just a six
squeeze. They didn't have a, yeah,

1898
01:49:43,630 --> 01:49:47,330
our fight or spending time developing
that for short and Thailand. They,

1899
01:49:47,530 --> 01:49:51,520
they stayed in Thailand. They
specialize in it. They're working on it.

1900
01:49:51,521 --> 01:49:54,580
They spend time on it. Yeah. You
don't see it that much in MMA.

1901
01:49:54,581 --> 01:49:58,750
You think it's good, take it to its low
percentage. You're committing to this,

1902
01:49:58,751 --> 01:50:01,870
right. You're committing to this
guys are too good. You know,

1903
01:50:01,871 --> 01:50:04,510
you give a guy a double under hook
and he's tripping you and he's on top.

1904
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:07,660
But people don't want that and it's also
guys are good at keeping their hands on

1905
01:50:07,661 --> 01:50:09,430
the hips.
That's what rich Franklin fucked up.

1906
01:50:09,550 --> 01:50:12,490
But there is a reality
though that if the guy has,

1907
01:50:12,491 --> 01:50:16,270
like if you have your hand on a guy's
hips and the other guy is like got you in

1908
01:50:16,271 --> 01:50:17,104
a Thai clinch,

1909
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:21,820
he can't elbow you from that clinch while
you're grabbing on his hips and you're

1910
01:50:21,821 --> 01:50:24,640
not really going to be in a good
position to stop it if he's fast.

1911
01:50:24,790 --> 01:50:26,950
It's a very good position to be in.
You know,

1912
01:50:26,951 --> 01:50:31,240
if a guy is worried about your knees and
he does commit one hand or maybe even

1913
01:50:31,241 --> 01:50:33,820
two to the hips, like you catch
them with a couple of hard ones.

1914
01:50:34,120 --> 01:50:37,620
A lot of guys will just switch to
elbow like right from here. I am.

1915
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:41,860
And it's a ruthless ruthless thing.
Elbows are so nasty. It's so,

1916
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:45,940
it's really kind of amazing that we cover
up the knuckles because you break your

1917
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:50,860
knuckles a lot. You never break your
fucking smash bricks with your elbow.

1918
01:50:50,861 --> 01:50:55,660
No problem. Nobody ever breaks or elbow
fighting unless you get kicked, you know.

1919
01:50:55,661 --> 01:50:58,360
But like hitting somebody,
you might get like little chips,

1920
01:50:58,630 --> 01:51:01,330
like Anderson had a bunch of chips in
his elbow that he actually had to get

1921
01:51:01,331 --> 01:51:05,950
removed, like bone chips and shit.
Stuff that snapped off on the job on.

1922
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:09,640
I'm sure a serious problem with
that, with this album. Didn't Gerald?

1923
01:51:09,641 --> 01:51:12,610
I think Gerald's treatment had a bunch
of floating around shit and his elbow to

1924
01:51:12,760 --> 01:51:16,300
a lot of guys get that. I think he was
the third choice for this too, I think.

1925
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:18,790
Really? Yeah. There was
one guy they had, um,

1926
01:51:19,620 --> 01:51:22,660
and he couldn't do it and I
guess I don't care who is second.

1927
01:51:22,990 --> 01:51:25,360
Will you watch how fucking
ferocious Perry is?

1928
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:30,010
You realize why Tiago didn't want to take
this with no camp or far with a fucked

1929
01:51:30,011 --> 01:51:31,990
up camp?
What was talked about his camp.

1930
01:51:31,991 --> 01:51:34,630
Didn't he have a full scan to get out
of Florida for the hurricane? You know,

1931
01:51:34,631 --> 01:51:37,960
if that was like a week before the
here yeah. Pulled from the fight.

1932
01:51:38,230 --> 01:51:41,410
That's what they both came from.
Farm that that's I think what uh,

1933
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:46,540
what the reason he gave was,
let me make sure that's right.

1934
01:51:46,570 --> 01:51:48,250
He's talking to some shit
about Tiago right now.

1935
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:53,683
Everybody

1936
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:54,583
Center.

1937
01:51:56,350 --> 01:52:00,490
Everybody wants to see me beat up
Robbie Lawler look at them. Wow.

1938
01:52:02,720 --> 01:52:03,553
This week

1939
01:52:04,750 --> 01:52:08,020
everybody wants to see me be a Robbie
Lawler. Ooh. What a crazy thing to say.

1940
01:52:08,350 --> 01:52:10,390
What a great fight that would be though.
Good Lord.

1941
01:52:10,970 --> 01:52:11,803
Hello.

1942
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,810
This is a fucking interesting one.
If he really does do that,

1943
01:52:17,811 --> 01:52:20,260
if Tiago doesn't fight him
and then he wants happen,

1944
01:52:20,470 --> 01:52:23,980
cause he didn't get hurt in this fight
at all, he just swarmed them. And K Odom,

1945
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,200
he could probably fight
again in a few months. Okay.

1946
01:52:27,290 --> 01:52:27,700
Wow.

1947
01:52:27,700 --> 01:52:28,570
I wonder what they're going to do.

1948
01:52:28,571 --> 01:52:33,190
Are they gonna read match or make the
remake remake rather the Tiago fight or

1949
01:52:33,191 --> 01:52:37,630
whether they really do give this kid
Robert Ponds and Aveo cause a good fight

1950
01:52:37,720 --> 01:52:39,620
that guys, that's actually who I thought
they were going to wind underneath.

1951
01:52:39,700 --> 01:52:40,690
They put them up an Nelson.
Yeah.

1952
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:45,523
Okay.

1953
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:50,510
I don't hear any of this nonsense. Yeah.
Yay. We go into the game. How can we,

1954
01:52:50,511 --> 01:52:51,141
what do you give a fuck?

1955
01:52:51,141 --> 01:52:55,420
You just knocked a dude unconscious
it enjoyable guy though. Yeah.

1956
01:52:55,850 --> 01:52:57,020
Ferocious fighter.
Yeah.

1957
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:01,730
Just like his style is
just a marauding ferocious,

1958
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:05,690
full attack. Reckless.
A lot of lot of, uh,

1959
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,670
confidence in his ability to take a shot.

1960
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:11,360
A lot of confidence and ability
to knock people dead. Like boom,

1961
01:53:11,361 --> 01:53:12,800
landed that and like that's it.

1962
01:53:13,190 --> 01:53:17,630
And then these great fight would
be him and Alan Jobe on again.

1963
01:53:17,631 --> 01:53:20,060
What the history. Um, yeah, it could be,

1964
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:23,600
doesn't show up on and have a
big fight coming up. Uh, does it,

1965
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:28,580
why do I think Alan has a big fight
coming up? Maybe I'm making that up.

1966
01:53:28,610 --> 01:53:31,310
I don't think I am now.
I think something was just announced.

1967
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:34,990
I Dunno it saying that uh,
uh,

1968
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:37,520
Jago lost his dog and
was living with family.

1969
01:53:37,890 --> 01:53:40,570
I with his family at the gym because of
the hurricanes and then he'd be like,

1970
01:53:40,670 --> 01:53:44,240
oh maybe you didn't before camp
Mack, right. Yeah. Fuck all that.

1971
01:53:44,310 --> 01:53:48,740
Being at the gym with your family and
he's got a kid, a really young kid. Yeah,

1972
01:53:48,741 --> 01:53:52,760
I get it. I think clinching
insane. Insane. He's a beast man.

1973
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,920
And that's how Alan fights too.

1974
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:57,740
He's got a serious crunch
to the fucker right there.

1975
01:53:58,250 --> 01:53:59,510
That's the picture on my phone.

1976
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:03,440
I took my girlfriend off and put
Francis in Ghana cause look at his hat.

1977
01:54:03,441 --> 01:54:06,920
I love it. He's like, Edi mean
up in that bitch. Here we go.

1978
01:54:08,270 --> 01:54:11,710
Did they find anyone for him by the
way, are know Francis after dusk? I

1979
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:14,420
don't know. They don't know what's
going to happen with junior. Uh,

1980
01:54:14,590 --> 01:54:19,190
what the substance was. They said it was
a very small trace amount of a diuretic.

1981
01:54:19,670 --> 01:54:21,620
Um,
so it wasn't like a steroid,

1982
01:54:21,860 --> 01:54:26,510
but a lot of times guys use diuretics to
mask steroids because it flushes it out

1983
01:54:26,511 --> 01:54:28,700
of your system quicker.
So like I say,

1984
01:54:28,701 --> 01:54:31,580
if a guy's doing something
he wants to test negative.

1985
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:36,260
Apparently you can flush some stuff out
with diuretics because he just drains

1986
01:54:36,261 --> 01:54:38,870
all the water out of your body and
you keep pouring more water in.

1987
01:54:38,871 --> 01:54:43,160
It flushes things out quicker. I think. I
don't, I don't understand how that works.

1988
01:54:43,161 --> 01:54:47,640
Diuretics are illegal.
Yes. That's what, uh,

1989
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:51,200
cris Cyborg got popped for a diuretic.
Um,

1990
01:54:51,290 --> 01:54:54,030
but then they gave her a
use exemption cause she has,

1991
01:54:54,031 --> 01:54:57,020
who has a legitimate reason for using it,
like a medical condition.

1992
01:54:57,220 --> 01:54:59,510
When are they know what he took over.
They never know.

1993
01:54:59,570 --> 01:55:03,590
They know what he took or was
it the process of they have to,

1994
01:55:03,620 --> 01:55:07,640
it has to play out.
Like what did they think happen?

1995
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:10,670
What's the evidence? Like they're
very, very thorough about it.

1996
01:55:10,900 --> 01:55:15,020
As one of the things I really appreciated
about that Jeff Novitsky is that he,

1997
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:17,570
one of the things he said about John
Jones, he said before you judge him,

1998
01:55:17,571 --> 01:55:21,950
we have to let this process play out.
And he's right, like it can play out.

1999
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:24,650
Not yet. I mean they,
they got the B sample,

2000
01:55:24,770 --> 01:55:28,000
the B sample is positive as well.
Um,

2001
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:29,810
but it was a lot of
weird shit was going on.

2002
01:55:29,811 --> 01:55:34,580
Like a lot of his chiropractor was
tweeting that John passed the blood test

2003
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:35,151
free.

2004
01:55:35,151 --> 01:55:39,980
John and like this is so irresponsible
because like anybody who looked into it

2005
01:55:39,981 --> 01:55:44,220
even for a moment would realize that
they don't even test that stuff in the

2006
01:55:44,221 --> 01:55:47,850
blood. They only task for that
stuff in the urine. So there was no,

2007
01:55:47,851 --> 01:55:50,250
like when they said his
blood test was clear of it,

2008
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:53,790
it's because they didn't task for
it. It's a, it's a urine test.

2009
01:55:53,910 --> 01:55:58,020
So like it was so disingenuous.
So then they waited,

2010
01:55:58,110 --> 01:56:03,000
they got the B sample, they tested that.
Yup. Same exact stuff. So it's in there.

2011
01:56:03,150 --> 01:56:06,380
So the question is now,
not whether or not it was in his body,

2012
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:07,770
but how did he get in his body?

2013
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:13,260
There's a big issue with a bunch of sports
guys. What, what does it, baseball guys,

2014
01:56:13,340 --> 01:56:15,900
they're getting popped with that stuff.
Brendan Schaub brought that up as well,

2015
01:56:16,260 --> 01:56:19,800
that apparently that stuffed Taranto Ball,
Toronto and a ball,

2016
01:56:19,810 --> 01:56:23,460
whatever the fuck it is,
tee ball is in a ton of supplements.

2017
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:28,800
You can get in a lot of that GNC over
the counter muscle builder, bullshit,

2018
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:32,820
all those testosterone boosters
and your mind could be,

2019
01:56:32,821 --> 01:56:34,470
but you're not supposed to take that shit.

2020
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,710
You shouldn't take that shows you
have to come back off a suspension.

2021
01:56:37,711 --> 01:56:40,290
Like shouldn't you be sending everything?
And that's, that's, it's crazy.

2022
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,260
But they're tainted
supplements are a real issue.

2023
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:46,250
But obviously the thing is don't take any
fucking supplements and unless they're

2024
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:48,990
absolutely approved and
certified and you know,

2025
01:56:48,991 --> 01:56:52,470
and you can get supplements
that are approved and
certified and then there could

2026
01:56:52,471 --> 01:56:56,280
be a random bad batch that's,
that's totally possible.

2027
01:56:56,970 --> 01:56:59,250
That happened to somebody.
Um,

2028
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:03,780
I supplements where a guy never really
took a steroid but got popped because

2029
01:57:03,781 --> 01:57:07,740
something was going to supplant that
happened at Tim means to means took some

2030
01:57:07,741 --> 01:57:09,600
shit from a GNC.

2031
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:13,680
Just some normal shit that supposed to
be some stuff you could buy off the shelf

2032
01:57:13,681 --> 01:57:18,540
like and uh, he tested positive
and he told everybody what he took.

2033
01:57:18,780 --> 01:57:22,830
They went to different
stores independently. Pull
that stuff off the shelf,

2034
01:57:22,831 --> 01:57:26,180
tested it. Yep. There it is
steroids, but he still got his boy.

2035
01:57:26,200 --> 01:57:28,080
Is it a six month suspension?
They do a year. Yeah.

2036
01:57:28,081 --> 01:57:31,800
He's not supposed to take that stuff. Like
even though it's not illegal, you just,

2037
01:57:31,830 --> 01:57:35,640
you have to approve everything.
And then on top of that they have a list.

2038
01:57:36,030 --> 01:57:39,810
They have a Usada list on the website
that you can go to and find out what's

2039
01:57:39,870 --> 01:57:44,610
tainted and what's not. Holy Shit Dude.
It is the craziest thing you've ever seen.

2040
01:57:44,910 --> 01:57:47,640
It's hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of supplements.

2041
01:57:48,120 --> 01:57:51,360
It's like there's so much shit that
makes you piss hot. It's crazy.

2042
01:57:51,660 --> 01:57:55,140
What's the most common? What's the most
popular? I think there's a most popular,

2043
01:57:55,141 --> 01:57:57,240
they start with like muscle
farm type stuff. Yeah.

2044
01:57:57,241 --> 01:58:02,160
They're starting with a and they work
in the way through P and, and sec. Yeah.

2045
01:58:02,250 --> 01:58:04,290
Dude,
I'm talking hundreds of things.

2046
01:58:04,291 --> 01:58:07,260
Like Novitsky pulled the
website up and we were laughing.

2047
01:58:07,280 --> 01:58:09,660
We were laughing at how many things
are work cause it's so absurd.

2048
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:11,940
Is there anyone who doesn't take anything,
any supplements?

2049
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:13,970
Do you know of any fires or
they talk the most minimal.

2050
01:58:13,980 --> 01:58:18,560
There's some guys that just take fruit.
Fruits and vegetables. Yup. That like, uh,

2051
01:58:19,170 --> 01:58:21,360
the ones from mom's
Sanford and son now are,

2052
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:26,420
those are tainted Mon Sanford
and son and not total Elijah.

2053
01:58:26,910 --> 01:58:30,990
She saw fruit and vegetables. Those are
tainted, those are genetically modified.

2054
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:33,150
They didn't have a shelf life of 20 years.

2055
01:58:33,180 --> 01:58:38,020
He posted a Joe Hogan from mayor sign
and somebody who put up the word. Yeah.

2056
01:58:41,750 --> 01:58:43,840
Well he might not have
somebody else did I guess.

2057
01:58:43,841 --> 01:58:48,670
And they were just talking about
him, jog and, but I think that,

2058
01:58:48,671 --> 01:58:53,080
um, there's a lot of tainted
supplements for sure.

2059
01:58:53,530 --> 01:58:57,340
But I think there's a lot of guys
using steroids too. So I was like,

2060
01:58:57,341 --> 01:58:58,180
which one is it?

2061
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:03,130
Is Did Jon Jones take it
tainted supplement or it was
Jon Jones using steroids.

2062
01:59:03,160 --> 01:59:05,800
Those are the only two options at this
point cause that's Tufts in his body.

2063
01:59:06,010 --> 01:59:07,810
They'll all,
the other option is somebody dosed him.

2064
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:10,630
Then I thought I'm going to
have somebody couldn't find out.

2065
01:59:12,010 --> 01:59:15,100
Well they have to do some sort of an
investigation. He has to come clean.

2066
01:59:15,660 --> 01:59:18,790
I talk about everything that
he's taken. Um, they have to,

2067
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:23,080
if he took something that is not on
their list of approved substances,

2068
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:27,940
any didn't claim that one. You
know when they, if that's the case,

2069
01:59:27,941 --> 01:59:30,700
he needs a goddamn babysitter.
If that's really what happened.

2070
01:59:30,701 --> 01:59:32,050
If it really was a tainted supplement,

2071
01:59:32,051 --> 01:59:36,490
just some normal bullshit from a
supermarket, a health food section,

2072
01:59:36,820 --> 01:59:41,140
who the fuck knows if it's really just
some nonsense. He needs a babysitter.

2073
01:59:41,170 --> 01:59:44,920
He needs someone that's around him
that he trusts and respects some mentor

2074
01:59:44,921 --> 01:59:48,280
figure that does not allow him to take
anything stupid and tells him, Hey man,

2075
01:59:48,550 --> 01:59:52,030
you're the baddest motherfucker of all
time and you're about to get put on the

2076
01:59:52,031 --> 01:59:54,580
shelf for four years over some nonsense.

2077
01:59:55,630 --> 01:59:58,840
Matt Serra raised a very
interesting point about, again,

2078
01:59:58,841 --> 02:00:00,100
it was just a speculation,

2079
02:00:00,101 --> 02:00:03,160
but is it possible that this was happening
because all those fights happened

2080
02:00:03,161 --> 02:00:06,670
before you saw sada? Yeah,
except for Osp. Well,

2081
02:00:06,671 --> 02:00:09,580
there's always going to be that
speculation. If someone pisses hot,

2082
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:11,890
you always got to think,
well,

2083
02:00:12,100 --> 02:00:16,750
if they piss hot in Usada and back when
it wasn't very sophisticated and the

2084
02:00:16,751 --> 02:00:20,530
drug searching wasn't that sophisticated,

2085
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:23,440
maybe they were doing it the whole time.
You got to, you got to wonder. You know?

2086
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:28,120
That's why I like a guy like Tony Ferguson
is so fucking spectacular. You know,

2087
02:00:28,121 --> 02:00:32,920
you look at a guy like Tony Ferguson and
he's just got mad focus and work ethic.

2088
02:00:33,220 --> 02:00:36,160
He's just for Roche and he's
just ferocious in his, in his,

2089
02:00:36,161 --> 02:00:39,610
in his focus and his intent.
Like that guy doesn't need steroids.

2090
02:00:39,880 --> 02:00:43,750
He just needs food and life, you know,
and he's just going to keep going.

2091
02:00:45,730 --> 02:00:49,240
He just needs a place to
work out and he'll build it
too. That's the crazy thing.

2092
02:00:49,241 --> 02:00:53,890
He's up there in big bear building gyms.
Builds his own fucking rolling room.

2093
02:00:53,891 --> 02:00:57,280
He's got video of it and photos of it
and shit. They mapped it out a room.

2094
02:00:57,281 --> 02:01:01,670
He nailed all the boards down and
shit. And he built a bag stand. Yeah,

2095
02:01:01,720 --> 02:01:06,490
like a workout little why does he do
that? He just liked the act of doing it.

2096
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:10,990
He's the kind of guy that if shit hit
the fan and we, it was an apocalypse,

2097
02:01:11,320 --> 02:01:14,950
uh, like he's the guy that you're
going to want to hang out with.

2098
02:01:14,980 --> 02:01:17,260
He's going to build your house.
He's on your shelter. Yeah.

2099
02:01:17,950 --> 02:01:20,560
And all you gotta do is just make sure
everything's cleaned when it gets,

2100
02:01:20,561 --> 02:01:24,100
I'm not that guy call up
like a Beta and I begged.

2101
02:01:25,570 --> 02:01:27,430
Yeah,
well that's what community is all about.

2102
02:01:27,700 --> 02:01:30,220
It's supposed to have one of those guys,
one guy like you.

2103
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:33,640
So we'll just have one guy Ligeti I mean
that's, that's what a real community is.

2104
02:01:33,940 --> 02:01:36,550
The idea that everybody has to be
the guy that could build a bandstand,

2105
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:40,250
but he can, he does man. He cleans

2106
02:01:40,290 --> 02:01:44,300
your friends the cabin. He's on
fire dude. He's just always on fire.

2107
02:01:44,580 --> 02:01:49,280
He'll go for a run through these hills
and these mountains in the streets and

2108
02:01:49,281 --> 02:01:52,610
he'll have a crew with them running. And
I'm in the car cause I have a torn ACL,

2109
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:57,380
some of my car following them and he'll
beat them by so much and then come back

2110
02:01:57,381 --> 02:01:59,980
for him and then go and then
come back for him and go,

2111
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:04,740
these are all professional athletes now.
His, his endurance is insane. He's at,

2112
02:02:04,870 --> 02:02:08,120
he's into doing extra credit and if
we're going to do 10 rounds of sprints,

2113
02:02:08,180 --> 02:02:11,750
he'll do 12. And he's always going to go
extra. What's going on with your knee?

2114
02:02:12,230 --> 02:02:14,630
Did you pour ACL?
Tore MCO.

2115
02:02:15,330 --> 02:02:18,560
Um, is it partially torn? Is that
deal is, yeah, it's not Tom to um,

2116
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:19,740
Doctor Rati Mcgee.

2117
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:24,100
He's talking about surgery and my doctor,
uh,

2118
02:02:25,250 --> 02:02:26,180
we're talking about,

2119
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:30,530
let's try to rehab it and see what happens
first and then you could always get

2120
02:02:30,531 --> 02:02:34,910
surgery later. Um, he said,
has it, you know, with me,

2121
02:02:34,970 --> 02:02:39,890
I told you that all I did was just stretch
out and I just stood up and my knee

2122
02:02:39,891 --> 02:02:41,660
just fell apart.

2123
02:02:42,200 --> 02:02:47,200
It came out and I had to pop it back in
and then I got an Mri the next day and

2124
02:02:49,010 --> 02:02:49,843
it came back.

2125
02:02:50,480 --> 02:02:54,110
Partial tear in the ACL torn MCL.

2126
02:02:54,260 --> 02:02:55,820
You really don't need surgery for the MCL.

2127
02:02:55,821 --> 02:02:59,480
Those apparently they just heal by
themselves. You just got to stay off

2128
02:03:01,130 --> 02:03:02,750
the ACL. I'm on, I'm on the fence.

2129
02:03:02,751 --> 02:03:06,770
I could have surgery right now or
I could try to rehab it, but um,

2130
02:03:07,210 --> 02:03:07,841
what's,
what I'm the,

2131
02:03:07,841 --> 02:03:11,410
I don't know what Clz anterior cruciate
ligament is a ligament that stabilizes

2132
02:03:11,411 --> 02:03:13,330
the knee,
keeps it from popping forward.

2133
02:03:13,630 --> 02:03:18,010
I've had both my ACL reconstructed
from the same, from fighting.

2134
02:03:18,011 --> 02:03:20,740
One of them from Jujitsu,
one of them from taekwondo popped out.

2135
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:23,540
Three weeks later I was doing a
seminar at 10th Planet Ocean side.

2136
02:03:23,541 --> 02:03:26,030
And right there in the middle of
seminar. Boom. It came out again. Yeah,

2137
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:29,800
it's going to pop out in front of her.
I'm just like, if it pops out that much,

2138
02:03:29,801 --> 02:03:33,690
man, I would go to a different doctor.
I go to Rodney Mcgee, man, just go,

2139
02:03:33,691 --> 02:03:37,570
go to him in Vegas. I talked to him
and we see, he seems totally legit,

2140
02:03:37,780 --> 02:03:40,840
but when he's talking about
is the surgery, you know,

2141
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:42,340
new kind of surgery that they're doing,

2142
02:03:42,370 --> 02:03:45,040
the new surgery only the
healing is only three months.

2143
02:03:45,130 --> 02:03:46,690
They don't use a cadaver anymore.

2144
02:03:46,750 --> 02:03:50,320
Now they reattach and you're a perfect
candidate for it because your shit's not

2145
02:03:50,321 --> 02:03:51,340
totally torn apart.

2146
02:03:51,610 --> 02:03:56,610
They reattach and they resell it up and
one dude did it in five months later he

2147
02:03:56,651 --> 02:03:58,780
competed in the Olympics.
The the,

2148
02:03:58,930 --> 02:04:03,010
the recovery time is so much different
because what they're doing now is

2149
02:04:03,011 --> 02:04:04,870
repairing your ligament.

2150
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:08,440
Whereas before what they were doing is
putting in an artificial ligament and

2151
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:12,520
then that ligament would
act as a scaffolding. So
not artificial, but a donor.

2152
02:04:12,550 --> 02:04:16,960
Like I have a donor on my right, one from
a cadaver, cadaver Patella or hamstring.

2153
02:04:16,990 --> 02:04:19,900
I had patella on my
left and cadaver on her.

2154
02:04:19,901 --> 02:04:22,690
She left feeling both of them are
awesome. Left Zoster, Baltimore.

2155
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:26,340
Apparently people are moving away a little
bit from cadavers cause sometimes you

2156
02:04:26,341 --> 02:04:30,420
can get an infection like Benji radic.
He had his ACL,

2157
02:04:30,421 --> 02:04:33,600
a cadaver ACL and he got it got infected.
You got

2158
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:37,710
infected from the surgery. He got staff
from the surgery, which is super, yeah,

2159
02:04:37,711 --> 02:04:41,940
it's common from the cadaver.
It's at the actual tendon.

2160
02:04:42,620 --> 02:04:45,860
Well you know Murcia I know,
I know the doc,

2161
02:04:45,900 --> 02:04:49,010
the doctor that I'm going to cause
the one who did his, yeah, but it's,

2162
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:52,710
there's no way to tell whether it was
from the actual surgery itself from

2163
02:04:52,711 --> 02:04:56,340
cutting you open because a lot of people
get it from like any sort of simple

2164
02:04:56,341 --> 02:04:58,080
operation.
They get mercy stopped doing,

2165
02:04:58,260 --> 02:05:02,310
he stopped doing so you don't do consumers
and he's just does patellas well now

2166
02:05:02,311 --> 02:05:06,270
what he's Dr. McGee was saying is
the most latest cutting edge shit.

2167
02:05:06,271 --> 02:05:07,590
You don't even have to do that.

2168
02:05:07,800 --> 02:05:11,100
Now what they're doing is they're taking
this torn stuff and he had pictures of

2169
02:05:11,101 --> 02:05:13,500
it and images of the actual surgery.

2170
02:05:13,740 --> 02:05:18,540
They stitch it together and rope it down
and like literally stitch it together

2171
02:05:18,660 --> 02:05:23,100
and they have this technique that they
do and then you're up and moving like

2172
02:05:23,101 --> 02:05:28,080
you're up and moving. And if in three
months it's 100% instead of six months,

2173
02:05:28,110 --> 02:05:28,801
what's the technique?

2174
02:05:28,801 --> 02:05:31,500
When are they just kind of cocoon
it with a bunch of rows of stitches.

2175
02:05:31,740 --> 02:05:34,650
Crazy looking like apparatus,
the way they were doing it,

2176
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:38,850
the way they had it stitched up
like some crazy fishing not but uh,

2177
02:05:39,090 --> 02:05:40,910
apparently it worked
amazing cause they the,

2178
02:05:40,940 --> 02:05:45,150
he had some videos of this guy a few
months postsurgery doing box jumps and I

2179
02:05:45,151 --> 02:05:49,920
was like this is crazy. Do inside box
jumps, like hopping on top of things,

2180
02:05:49,921 --> 02:05:53,070
hopping on top of another thing,
jumping over things left and right.

2181
02:05:53,071 --> 02:05:56,840
I was like that is incredible for
someone to go from ACL surgery,

2182
02:05:56,860 --> 02:06:00,520
do it like that was a rat. That's a
recipe for blowing your knee apart.

2183
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:03,810
Three cause I remember after I
got mine for like six months,

2184
02:06:03,811 --> 02:06:05,800
I was terrified to do anything like,
and I,

2185
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:10,590
when I first came back to Jujitsu I was
terrified. I was like, Huh, Huh, Huh.

2186
02:06:10,830 --> 02:06:12,690
Like every time I roll it's like,
please don't fall apart.

2187
02:06:12,691 --> 02:06:15,870
Please don't fall apart because
if you call them for six months,

2188
02:06:16,260 --> 02:06:18,750
so hard to do and how long until you're
doing it, you're like, all right,

2189
02:06:18,751 --> 02:06:22,380
it's not going to fall apart. A
couple months, like eight months in,

2190
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:25,020
I realized I was like, this is
pretty good. I'm feeling pretty good.

2191
02:06:25,021 --> 02:06:26,790
I was through any kicks forever.

2192
02:06:26,970 --> 02:06:30,120
I didn't kick the bag forever
and when I did Jujitsu,

2193
02:06:30,121 --> 02:06:32,550
like if anybody even went for my leg,
I would tell him, I please don't,

2194
02:06:32,551 --> 02:06:36,510
don't Yank on this one. This one's
still ginger. And it was like,

2195
02:06:36,570 --> 02:06:40,800
I wouldn't like try to explode with it
and push off with it. I was real gentle,

2196
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:45,730
gentle on it. This fights
about to go down. Ah.

2197
02:06:46,110 --> 02:06:50,430
What do you think Eddie? Bravo
initial thoughts. I don't know.

2198
02:06:50,460 --> 02:06:53,930
Does Luke Rockhold get the same guy
after getting catered by Bisbing?

2199
02:06:54,450 --> 02:06:58,320
That's a hard, hard one to call. Been a
long time outside the octagon. Jim Norton,

2200
02:06:58,321 --> 02:07:02,220
what do you think? You're the host of UFC
uncensored. I'm taking David Branch. Ooh,

2201
02:07:02,460 --> 02:07:05,340
New Yorker goes with the New Yorker,
David Branch moving towards him,

2202
02:07:05,580 --> 02:07:10,510
dropping some shots. Luke Rockhold
is got a powerful left kick. Yeah,

2203
02:07:10,740 --> 02:07:13,980
strong left kick. And he landed it
a few times to the body already.

2204
02:07:14,610 --> 02:07:17,130
It's a legit kick and he
catches you with it way outside.

2205
02:07:17,131 --> 02:07:19,320
And Luke Rockhold super hard to take down.

2206
02:07:19,920 --> 02:07:23,610
He trains all the time with
Daniel Cormier and Cain Velasquez.

2207
02:07:23,640 --> 02:07:25,990
He's got all these monster
wrestlers over there.

2208
02:07:25,991 --> 02:07:29,280
How be you've never met off and you
think branch wants to take him down.

2209
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:31,310
He might,
he's kind of very good ground game.

2210
02:07:31,330 --> 02:07:35,710
Sends a Roscoe Spinning
Sidekick Kale finish,

2211
02:07:36,380 --> 02:07:39,010
is that right? No, he got wheel kicked
in the head by Vitor Belfort and,

2212
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:42,990
and then he got um,
uh,

2213
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:46,510
Chris Weidman tried to will kick them
and he took why into the ground and beat

2214
02:07:46,511 --> 02:07:48,890
the fuck out of them. And that was
the beginning of the end, right? Yeah.

2215
02:07:48,970 --> 02:07:51,640
It was crazy cause up until that,
it was like a really competitive fight.

2216
02:07:52,210 --> 02:07:55,990
Branches, Sarc doing a good
job of circling to his left
to avoid that left kick.

2217
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:59,740
He's not well, but he landed it right.
Their branch is doing a real good job. Oh,

2218
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:02,990
he's, he's putting Rockhold
and danger and Rockhold

2219
02:08:06,850 --> 02:08:11,110
he teed off on him. Oh my God. Rock
holds in trouble. This is a real fight.

2220
02:08:11,170 --> 02:08:12,070
And he's,
Oh my God,

2221
02:08:12,071 --> 02:08:15,040
he's take Rockhold down and that's
how you know rock is in big trouble.

2222
02:08:15,340 --> 02:08:18,970
I brought, she was super hard to
take down the state standing ab,

2223
02:08:18,971 --> 02:08:23,740
but he lets him know he can take
them down. God Damn, this is legit.

2224
02:08:23,860 --> 02:08:27,130
And he just looked over at his
friend and waved and said, I'm okay,

2225
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:30,670
or as coach his corner,
but it doesn't look okay.

2226
02:08:31,600 --> 02:08:34,360
He got hit with bombs,
man. You never, okay.

2227
02:08:34,361 --> 02:08:37,180
When you get hit with those kind of bombs,
you might not have gone out,

2228
02:08:37,420 --> 02:08:41,890
but you're not okay. She's fucking him.
I may so much different than boxing.

2229
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:44,060
These two fights highlight it like you do.

2230
02:08:44,140 --> 02:08:47,110
You guys barely know who Mike Perry
is, right? Yeah. But meanwhile,

2231
02:08:47,111 --> 02:08:50,620
he's so invested in that fight.
Chaos. Right? And this fight,

2232
02:08:51,210 --> 02:08:55,180
this is the fucking chaos
in so many different ways.

2233
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:58,870
One 18 to one 10. I'm not going to, I
guess get a room or the fucking weekend.

2234
02:08:59,050 --> 02:09:01,930
Adelai Berge it's a very nice lady.
I can't say anything terrible,

2235
02:09:02,230 --> 02:09:03,970
but that's where it is.

2236
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:09,160
She's always very pleasant.
She always waves and says hello.

2237
02:09:09,850 --> 02:09:13,390
I mean just cause I don't think I
agree with her. And boxing. Yeah.

2238
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:14,410
Not Mad at the lady.

2239
02:09:15,620 --> 02:09:20,620
Do judges get removed for poor officiating
to good questions that ever happened?

2240
02:09:21,220 --> 02:09:21,401
Well,

2241
02:09:21,401 --> 02:09:24,880
back in the old days with the Nevada
state athletic commission wasn't being run

2242
02:09:24,881 --> 02:09:28,330
very well. Um, Bob Bennett, the guy
who runs it now as an animal, he's,

2243
02:09:28,360 --> 02:09:29,200
he's on the ball.

2244
02:09:29,230 --> 02:09:34,210
He's really good and he's really smart
and he's just a real easy guy to talk to

2245
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:38,810
too. And you know, he wants
us commission though, Nate.

2246
02:09:39,810 --> 02:09:42,310
Yeah, he's, yeah, he
handles all that stuff.

2247
02:09:42,520 --> 02:09:44,980
So most likely he'll probably
be looking into that. That's,

2248
02:09:44,981 --> 02:09:46,990
do they ever get booted though?
If it's not corruption,

2249
02:09:46,991 --> 02:09:49,600
if they literally just think this
guy sucks and making decisions,

2250
02:09:49,601 --> 02:09:52,020
do they ever get kicked out?
Like you've questioned many times.

2251
02:09:52,030 --> 02:09:54,820
It's a good question. I don't
know enough about boxing. About,

2252
02:09:54,850 --> 02:09:57,760
I know when there's a bad decision
and I know names that I keep hearing,

2253
02:09:58,060 --> 02:10:00,780
but it's not like I know a MMA judges.
That was the,

2254
02:10:00,980 --> 02:10:04,180
that's that's disgraceful
score. Disgraceful. I agree.

2255
02:10:04,240 --> 02:10:06,840
And has she had an another? Yeah, there.

2256
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:11,170
Just that she's had some
terrible decisions in terms
of what I think about the

2257
02:10:11,171 --> 02:10:15,010
call. Ooh, look out for the knees on.
He's trying to trip. Branched down.

2258
02:10:15,100 --> 02:10:17,620
Luke Rockhold super strong,
super strong.

2259
02:10:17,621 --> 02:10:20,680
Top game branch might be
fading and been here. Nope.

2260
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:23,740
Branch still looking at wing.
Some shots.

2261
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:27,220
One of the things that branch thought
was a big factor in this fight with his

2262
02:10:27,221 --> 02:10:31,180
boxing but he's got to avoid those kicks.
Especially the left one man,

2263
02:10:31,181 --> 02:10:34,820
the left one's the big one for Rockhold
and he'll do it off the switch. Ooh,

2264
02:10:34,821 --> 02:10:35,840
that's a nice right leg kick.

2265
02:10:36,230 --> 02:10:38,930
He'll do it off the switch
and he's got a nasty question.

2266
02:10:38,931 --> 02:10:42,650
Mark kick is question mark kick is what
he used to crack Bisbing with cause he

2267
02:10:42,651 --> 02:10:45,410
hits you with the body shots like
over and over and over again.

2268
02:10:45,590 --> 02:10:46,700
And then he gets your region.

2269
02:10:46,940 --> 02:10:51,680
So he throws one like this to the body
and then at the last minute he whips it

2270
02:10:51,681 --> 02:10:55,230
around over the top. He's nasty
with that. Really good with that.

2271
02:10:55,231 --> 02:10:56,660
And it's like one of his best techniques.

2272
02:10:57,860 --> 02:10:58,360
Okay.

2273
02:10:58,360 --> 02:11:02,230
That in his left power kick, that left
power kick to the body. It's just so good.

2274
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:07,450
He stopped cops to Phillip. Who would
that left body kick as well? Oh,

2275
02:11:07,451 --> 02:11:11,140
we went jumping round. Kicking. Nice
straight left. He said, no, no, no.

2276
02:11:11,740 --> 02:11:14,640
He certainly looked like he recovered.
Yeah, he recovered for sure. Oh,

2277
02:11:14,641 --> 02:11:18,790
we just clipped David Branch
with a right hook. Look.

2278
02:11:18,820 --> 02:11:22,420
Rockhold does not want to
go out like that. Bisping
fight. See, here's the clinch.

2279
02:11:22,450 --> 02:11:25,840
Well, you're talking about, yeah,
so it's just way harder to pull off.

2280
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:32,100
This is too much scrambling in MMA
and looking for take downs and stuff.

2281
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:36,040
Look at how Luke Rockhold getting
the back. Get in the back. Oh Shit.

2282
02:11:36,041 --> 02:11:40,120
David Branch almost goes down.
Oh, Luke Rockhold on top.

2283
02:11:40,121 --> 02:11:44,620
Very dangerous on top. Super strong
and branches tired as fuck man.

2284
02:11:48,230 --> 02:11:51,320
Rockhold looks like he's surgeon here.
Branch is doing a good job.

2285
02:11:51,321 --> 02:11:54,620
That protecting them. One thing Brock
holds, got to watch out for is his legs.

2286
02:11:54,700 --> 02:11:58,640
What brand is on the Henzel Gracie school?
What's his motive?

2287
02:11:58,641 --> 02:12:00,670
And putting them up against
the cage when he's smashing,

2288
02:12:01,190 --> 02:12:05,630
smashed against the wall. They can't move.
He wants to just hold them somewhere.

2289
02:12:05,660 --> 02:12:06,920
Ooh,
not makeup.

2290
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:09,230
Okay,

2291
02:12:09,230 --> 02:12:13,490
dude. What do that shit?
Um, yeah, just smash him.

2292
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:16,070
Rockhold came on strong
towards the end of that round,

2293
02:12:16,250 --> 02:12:19,340
there's nothing more claustrophobic and
washing that when someone's mushed up

2294
02:12:19,341 --> 02:12:22,250
against the cage like
that. Uh, I could be,

2295
02:12:22,251 --> 02:12:25,310
but Johnson fight that it's probably
the most claustrophobic I've ever been

2296
02:12:25,311 --> 02:12:28,040
watching fight over it.
That was one of the worst ones over.

2297
02:12:28,070 --> 02:12:31,190
There's an art to smashing a
guy against that fence for sure.

2298
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:34,760
Keeping them there and land in shots and
wearing them out and just smashing them.

2299
02:12:34,820 --> 02:12:36,290
It takes you back to
when you're 10 years old,

2300
02:12:36,291 --> 02:12:38,360
like that's how I got beat
up when I was a kid. Like,

2301
02:12:38,361 --> 02:12:41,240
you're just helpless in a corner. Dude.
That happened to me when I was 14.

2302
02:12:41,241 --> 02:12:42,380
That's when I started wrestling.

2303
02:12:42,530 --> 02:12:46,460
This guy took me down in the locker room
and he was like gonna Punch me in the

2304
02:12:46,461 --> 02:12:49,400
head, but he decided not to because it
was so easy for him to take me down.

2305
02:12:50,390 --> 02:12:53,390
He just grabbed me in a head lock or I
didn't even know if we were fighting.

2306
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:54,560
Like I didn't know what was going on.

2307
02:12:54,561 --> 02:12:58,670
Like we were looking at each other and
he was talking some shit and I wasn't

2308
02:12:58,671 --> 02:13:01,130
exactly sure like what we're going to
do and then all of a sudden we were

2309
02:13:01,131 --> 02:13:04,100
grabbing each other and he just got me
in a headlock and threw me on the ground

2310
02:13:04,340 --> 02:13:07,070
and held me there and could
have easily punched my face.

2311
02:13:07,071 --> 02:13:10,100
And to this day I owe him a debt
of gratitude. Changed Your Life?

2312
02:13:11,090 --> 02:13:13,610
He did change my life because he
made me realize like, oh my God.

2313
02:13:13,880 --> 02:13:16,010
And then I had a friend,
my friend and Arduino,

2314
02:13:16,250 --> 02:13:21,250
he was a wrestler in high school and I
was already doing a martial arts den and

2315
02:13:21,621 --> 02:13:25,670
it just had no idea how easy it
was for someone to take me down.

2316
02:13:25,850 --> 02:13:29,930
And we went outside. We went outside
on the grass and it was like,

2317
02:13:29,931 --> 02:13:33,570
I could take you down easy. I was, no you
can't. He's like wash, boom. I was like,

2318
02:13:33,571 --> 02:13:37,770
fuck that. Try again. Boom. I was like,
oh my God, I gotta start wrestling.

2319
02:13:38,010 --> 02:13:39,120
So those two events

2320
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:42,730
led me to wrestling class,
wrestle in high school and I was terrible.

2321
02:13:42,731 --> 02:13:44,980
I was probably one of the worst
wrestlers in high school history.

2322
02:13:44,981 --> 02:13:48,030
I got one one take down.
I would never take anybody down.

2323
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:50,650
I was always afraid that I was
going to catch a knee and my teeth.

2324
02:13:50,980 --> 02:13:54,580
So I would just sprawl on dudes. It
took down, they tried to take me down.

2325
02:13:54,581 --> 02:13:58,060
That was my game plan. But regular
people, when I'd get in a fight,

2326
02:13:58,480 --> 02:14:02,230
I would take them down and I always felt
like I was cheating, but I didn't care.

2327
02:14:02,231 --> 02:14:04,660
Cause you use wrestling. Yeah, go.
You know what? I don't give a fuck.

2328
02:14:04,661 --> 02:14:05,411
If someone fucks with me,

2329
02:14:05,411 --> 02:14:08,350
I'm a double leg them and then I'd get
like twister cycle from a punch their

2330
02:14:08,351 --> 02:14:11,080
stomach. I did that to
us, a soccer player.

2331
02:14:11,410 --> 02:14:16,400
He was talking Shit in school and um, I
took him down. It took several guys down.

2332
02:14:16,401 --> 02:14:18,190
I think that it would be cheating.
I thought it was,

2333
02:14:18,191 --> 02:14:21,070
I didn't think it was real fighting
back then. So when I saw her voice,

2334
02:14:21,190 --> 02:14:23,200
when I saw, holy smokes,
he too, I'm like, Oh shit.

2335
02:14:23,201 --> 02:14:26,860
You could take dudes down and
fight. That's, that's legit.
He's hurting that light.

2336
02:14:26,861 --> 02:14:27,161
By the way.

2337
02:14:27,161 --> 02:14:29,830
Rockhold was really hurting that lag
bolt guys are hurting their legs.

2338
02:14:29,890 --> 02:14:30,530
Rockhold yes,
it's

2339
02:14:30,530 --> 02:14:33,870
been landed a bunch of hard leg kicks
on branch too. This is a serious fight.

2340
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:37,320
That's what I mean. He's been, he's
been hurting branches like Oh yeah,

2341
02:14:37,321 --> 02:14:40,710
but rock holds her too man.
This is a, this is a real fight.

2342
02:14:41,820 --> 02:14:42,660
Very good fight.

2343
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:47,700
Is it a funny now like a fight
where two guys take each other down.

2344
02:14:47,701 --> 02:14:50,210
It's like totally standard.
Like you know,

2345
02:14:50,250 --> 02:14:52,230
kids today would ever think
that would be cheating.

2346
02:14:52,300 --> 02:14:53,640
Like that's how you fight motherfucker.

2347
02:14:54,240 --> 02:14:55,830
If someone takes someone
down like Oh shit,

2348
02:14:55,831 --> 02:15:00,570
grounded pound kids know the moves so I
can draw. Oh you guys, I see fight videos.

2349
02:15:00,571 --> 02:15:03,450
Just street five videos where someone
takes him down and they tap like that's

2350
02:15:03,451 --> 02:15:07,740
like the understood move. Now
it's hilarious. I but it, look,

2351
02:15:07,741 --> 02:15:10,600
if people can tap in street fights, the
world would be a better place. Yeah.

2352
02:15:11,400 --> 02:15:13,830
Because if somebody leaves you alone
after you tap and they let it alone.

2353
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:17,150
Like if you guys agree to fight and
then someone taps and then the guy who

2354
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:22,110
respects the tap. That's good that
that'll done opens. Yeah. I hope it does.

2355
02:15:22,140 --> 02:15:25,380
I hope it happens more often I guess
of the Times it will push your fight to

2356
02:15:25,381 --> 02:15:28,790
begin with though. Yeah. You know.
Sure. You're not signing the contracts.

2357
02:15:28,791 --> 02:15:33,240
Some Guy Fuck your chair.
Exactly. Exactly. Boom.

2358
02:15:33,590 --> 02:15:37,650
Then what's some of the craziest shit
girls fighting? Cause it's so primal,

2359
02:15:38,160 --> 02:15:41,010
especially when they don't know how to
fight and that grabbing hair and just

2360
02:15:41,011 --> 02:15:45,630
screaming come off
laws wailing at each other.

2361
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:51,660
See the thing about Rockhold is he's so
used to this shit cause he's in the gym

2362
02:15:51,661 --> 02:15:56,040
with DC and Cain doing this.
So like there's very few guys,

2363
02:15:56,041 --> 02:15:59,970
they're going to have a kind of clinch
game that Rockhold is going to have and

2364
02:15:59,971 --> 02:16:03,690
the kind of grappling like grinding
skills that Rockhold is going to have

2365
02:16:03,930 --> 02:16:08,500
because he's been doing it with these
fucking monsters. Yeah. I mean, Ryan,

2366
02:16:08,510 --> 02:16:10,260
his past, he's said, oh,

2367
02:16:10,261 --> 02:16:14,730
there's a lot of time left to full
Mount Cha not good for branch.

2368
02:16:14,760 --> 02:16:18,630
Super Bad for branch. Let's see if he
gives up his back and trying to get out.

2369
02:16:19,440 --> 02:16:23,280
That's, that's super dangerous.
Don't panic. Let's see if he panics.

2370
02:16:23,700 --> 02:16:27,270
He's got to figure out a way to
defend himself. Oh look at this.

2371
02:16:27,271 --> 02:16:31,120
He's given up his back. He's given
us, do you have it off of his back?

2372
02:16:31,780 --> 02:16:36,220
It's going to handcuff him. Oh, he got
that back. Oh, bad place to base flat.

2373
02:16:36,221 --> 02:16:39,310
And this is terrible planning at time.
Branches in a world of Shit.

2374
02:16:39,320 --> 02:16:41,820
Doing Rockhold does this
to everybody, man. Yeah.

2375
02:16:41,950 --> 02:16:46,480
He gets on top of you when he just smashes
you. It's so impressive to veto. Right.

2376
02:16:46,481 --> 02:16:51,400
Look at his top mount. No,
he did it to, um, uh, uh,

2377
02:16:51,640 --> 02:16:55,900
the Odo Leo Machida. Oh to our wheel.
Kicked him in the head, remember? Oh,

2378
02:16:55,901 --> 02:16:59,500
that's right dude. Ranches in serious
trouble. He's going to flatten them out.

2379
02:16:59,710 --> 02:17:03,370
That's a serious mountain man.
That back mountain is out of control.

2380
02:17:04,090 --> 02:17:08,410
His mount and his back mount or sees his
top game. It's just fucking ferocious.

2381
02:17:08,670 --> 02:17:12,760
Oh, branch has done. He has done,
he's just, he was just covering up.

2382
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:17,520
Dan's giving me a lot of chances here, but
he's taken a fucking bad beat. Tap, tap,

2383
02:17:17,650 --> 02:17:20,530
tap, tap, tap, tap strikes.

2384
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:23,253
Yeah.

2385
02:17:23,910 --> 02:17:28,230
To, to strikes. Great fight. Fuck.
Yeah. That was a great fight,

2386
02:17:28,650 --> 02:17:32,430
dude. Brock holds top game. Might
be the best in the fucking division.

2387
02:17:32,970 --> 02:17:36,360
He might be better than
Romero. He might be cray. Yeah.

2388
02:17:36,361 --> 02:17:40,470
He's a black belt under who? I don't know.
I don't know who they are. Um, it's not,

2389
02:17:40,471 --> 02:17:43,100
um, oh, it's an achy Dave Camera Rio.

2390
02:17:44,880 --> 02:17:49,680
How long has he been at this forever?
[inaudible] still in Aka? No, I think,

2391
02:17:49,681 --> 02:17:51,660
but a lot of guys,
I trained with them still.

2392
02:17:51,661 --> 02:17:55,800
A lot of guys still go over there and she
just, yeah, we'll throw it to somebody.

2393
02:17:55,890 --> 02:17:59,850
That's a joy. Would you suck on that? No,
I wouldn't. Would you put in your mouth?

2394
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,470
No, I wouldn't. Girls
would. Some girls would.

2395
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:06,810
Some girls want to get pregnant with that.
Spit get you pregnant.

2396
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:08,010
I used to depend on the fighter.

2397
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:19,910
Boom. I got a text message from
Vinny Shoreman fucking Adelaide bird.

2398
02:18:19,970 --> 02:18:20,803
Again,

2399
02:18:22,420 --> 02:18:25,970
a lot of people are aware that alley
birds does know the best decisions.

2400
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:31,340
It's true. Boom, boom, boom, boom. She's
trending. Jamie knows who's trending.

2401
02:18:31,341 --> 02:18:33,740
Would you ever know who's trending?
Never. Not. You'd ever know?

2402
02:18:34,130 --> 02:18:36,590
Would you ever had any idea ever
who's trending? What was that?

2403
02:18:36,740 --> 02:18:41,270
Would you ever have any idea who's
trending? No. Sas. Jamie. Oh,

2404
02:18:41,990 --> 02:18:44,050
it's just the newer still trending.

2405
02:18:46,580 --> 02:18:50,330
Can't you train it? Two different ways
to like locally like I've had guys go,

2406
02:18:50,331 --> 02:18:53,450
dude, you're trending, but I'm not. It's
like a fucking local, like in Jersey.

2407
02:18:53,451 --> 02:18:56,450
I'm trying to compare it to other
Jersey people. Nice. Which is,

2408
02:18:56,540 --> 02:18:59,090
how does that work? How do you get, how
do you train in Jersey? I don't know.

2409
02:18:59,091 --> 02:19:02,120
There's a way to do it location wise.
Like it gets your hopes up and utilize.

2410
02:19:02,120 --> 02:19:07,040
I'll no one fucking cares.
Luke Rockhold put the beat down.

2411
02:19:07,370 --> 02:19:08,330
But I'll tell you what,
man,

2412
02:19:08,331 --> 02:19:12,680
David Branch made it a scrap made a scrap
from the beginning till Luke Rockhold

2413
02:19:12,681 --> 02:19:17,270
wore on him with that pressure,
that clench and that wrestling too.

2414
02:19:17,300 --> 02:19:20,240
I'm telling you man,
all those years with Cain and DC,

2415
02:19:20,510 --> 02:19:23,630
I mean you don't get any better wrestling
than that. You don't get any better,

2416
02:19:23,810 --> 02:19:28,490
more savage,
big giant dudes than to think about it.

2417
02:19:28,500 --> 02:19:33,500
Olympic class wrestler and the arguably
arguably the greatest UFC heavyweight

2418
02:19:33,921 --> 02:19:35,240
ever.
Well who puts,

2419
02:19:35,480 --> 02:19:38,480
but who helps cane light that cause he's
obviously he's heavier than combination.

2420
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:43,700
Not much. Not much. DC walks around
all the time at two 35 to 40.

2421
02:19:44,090 --> 02:19:44,590
You know,
he'll,

2422
02:19:44,590 --> 02:19:48,860
he even said he was feeling kind of
slim like this time after the fight.

2423
02:19:48,861 --> 02:19:52,970
You know, we did commentary last
weekend and he said, uh, he was, uh,

2424
02:19:52,971 --> 02:19:57,380
usually he'd be at like two 35 by
now, but uh, he was lighter than that.

2425
02:19:57,380 --> 02:19:59,780
I think you'd be like two 15 or
two 20 or something like that.

2426
02:19:59,900 --> 02:20:04,040
But he'll get up to two 35 so it canes
to 40 so when they're in the neighborhood

2427
02:20:04,041 --> 02:20:04,700
of each other,

2428
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:08,570
like five pounds difference
with a worldclass grappling
like those two guys have,

2429
02:20:09,110 --> 02:20:10,470
they're just going to war constantly.

2430
02:20:10,471 --> 02:20:12,350
It's always a problem
now for big guys guys,

2431
02:20:12,410 --> 02:20:15,890
two 50 and above finding
training part. Sure. Tough

2432
02:20:17,420 --> 02:20:21,170
man. It's tough. We don't have very
many big guys we've got right now

2433
02:20:22,670 --> 02:20:23,630
in my class,

2434
02:20:23,690 --> 02:20:28,690
I think the biggest guy
pro 200 pounds crazy it.

2435
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:34,340
What a fight man. Huh? And that crazy
Luke Rockhold. I'll tell you dude,

2436
02:20:34,341 --> 02:20:37,760
when that guy gets people down,
they are not getting up.

2437
02:20:38,180 --> 02:20:40,370
He has one of the best fucking top games.

2438
02:20:44,820 --> 02:20:47,610
You don't see a lot of tap house due to
strikes. A lot of people don't do it.

2439
02:20:47,611 --> 02:20:48,444
They don't believe in it.

2440
02:20:48,920 --> 02:20:51,060
A lot of people have said
that like that's a bitch move.

2441
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:55,410
I don't think it is even a, even a
little bit. I think it's a smart move.

2442
02:20:55,411 --> 02:20:56,161
When you're getting hit,

2443
02:20:56,161 --> 02:20:59,100
you're getting fucked up and you know
you're not going to recover, you know,

2444
02:20:59,101 --> 02:21:00,150
and the fights over it.

2445
02:21:00,151 --> 02:21:03,810
There's no need to take extra shots if
you know that you're done, just tap.

2446
02:21:04,470 --> 02:21:06,530
But it seems as if they
see fighters say this.

2447
02:21:06,570 --> 02:21:09,210
Well a lot of people
like George Saint Pierre.

2448
02:21:09,540 --> 02:21:12,780
That's one of the things that Bj Penn
was taunting him about how he tapped it

2449
02:21:12,781 --> 02:21:15,150
strikes against Matt when Matt beat him,

2450
02:21:15,480 --> 02:21:19,290
Matt beat the shit out of
him and a clipped him with
a pig right hand early gun

2451
02:21:19,291 --> 02:21:23,550
on top of them, banged him out. And then
GSP tapped his tracks and Bj was like,

2452
02:21:23,580 --> 02:21:24,810
I would never tap the strikes.

2453
02:21:25,230 --> 02:21:27,840
But really maybe some of those
career fights he should have.

2454
02:21:27,970 --> 02:21:29,760
If you know you've got
nothing left, why not? Yeah.

2455
02:21:35,090 --> 02:21:35,923
Getting out of what.

2456
02:21:42,560 --> 02:21:43,393
Okay.

2457
02:21:43,550 --> 02:21:45,010
Brisbane.
I Dunno.

2458
02:21:45,020 --> 02:21:48,500
That's some bad trash bitch being
cause he's saying it's his fights.

2459
02:21:48,620 --> 02:21:51,290
I think he feels he should be
fighting for the belt. Nut. GSP. Yeah.

2460
02:21:57,590 --> 02:22:00,830
Oh Man. You're getting credit for taking
that and so I got my first round. Yeah,

2461
02:22:00,831 --> 02:22:02,990
he was in trouble, dude.
He was in trouble for sure.

2462
02:22:03,020 --> 02:22:07,250
That Thai clinch stopped the strikes. Yep.
This, this is what stops everything man.

2463
02:22:07,251 --> 02:22:08,900
His fucking smushed game.

2464
02:22:09,070 --> 02:22:12,350
I look at that step over mount may no
resistance and getting that amount.

2465
02:22:13,130 --> 02:22:16,430
He just overwhelmed branch branches
couldn't keep up that pace.

2466
02:22:18,110 --> 02:22:22,640
You know Luke Rockhold.
I mean he's a reason why he was the champ.

2467
02:22:22,730 --> 02:22:25,260
He's fucking world class November,

2468
02:22:26,430 --> 02:22:31,160
November Madison Square
Garden. Whoa. He's,

2469
02:22:31,161 --> 02:22:33,390
so he's telling GSP to back out.
Well,

2470
02:22:33,391 --> 02:22:35,880
there's people who are still thinking
that GSP is not going to make that fight.

2471
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:40,590
Yeah. There's a lot of people think that
GSPS crazy. Now he's lost his marbles.

2472
02:22:41,070 --> 02:22:43,980
Why didn't they keep delaying
it? Well, because of the, uh,

2473
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:48,420
the time lapse thing and the Ufo thing
that he saw, he kept talking about aliens.

2474
02:22:48,420 --> 02:22:51,540
Like he was obsessed with aliens to the
point where they wanted to leave it out

2475
02:22:51,570 --> 02:22:55,900
of a, one of the UFC countdown shows.
No Way. He talks a lot about us.

2476
02:22:56,820 --> 02:23:01,710
Yes. Yeah. He's trying to tell us
we're not listening to, there was some,

2477
02:23:02,190 --> 02:23:05,630
he talked about it on my
podcast, man talked about, uh,

2478
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:07,680
he thinks that like sometimes he'll,

2479
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:10,500
he'll like be missing time and
then we'll like be somewhere else.

2480
02:23:10,830 --> 02:23:12,300
It wasn't comfortable listening to,

2481
02:23:12,720 --> 02:23:15,600
didn't you pointed out to them that
that was kind of a trauma? Yeah,

2482
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:18,720
well that's one of the main
signs of trauma. You know,

2483
02:23:18,721 --> 02:23:20,550
loss of memory is one of the big ones.

2484
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:25,470
You know when you start talking about
missing time and aliens like, Whoa, okay,

2485
02:23:25,770 --> 02:23:30,690
why would you think it would be aliens
when you got hit 800 times? Like he's,

2486
02:23:30,780 --> 02:23:34,680
he was hitting more than 800
times in his UFC career. It
was like, no, no, no, no, no,

2487
02:23:34,681 --> 02:23:38,280
I'm fine with that. Aliens
are fucking with me, dude.

2488
02:23:39,630 --> 02:23:43,410
Damn, that's crazy. Maybe it's true.
Maybe it is. Imagine if we were like,

2489
02:23:43,830 --> 02:23:47,910
we're joking around about it. Meanwhile,
every night while GFP, GSP sleeping,

2490
02:23:48,480 --> 02:23:52,500
his body freezes wool.
The room fills up with blue light.

2491
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:55,710
Little dudes like fucking
walk right to the walls will

2492
02:23:56,420 --> 02:23:58,400
and he's like, no, don't take me again.

2493
02:23:58,700 --> 02:24:03,300
And they take him to this patient
cartoons. They want to get that.

2494
02:24:04,190 --> 02:24:07,550
You want that perfect super athlete.
GSP DNA.

2495
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:09,650
They take them there and then fucking,

2496
02:24:09,710 --> 02:24:14,710
they have a whole underarmour lab and
space and they do an anal probe and him

2497
02:24:15,291 --> 02:24:19,580
and then he turns around and
goes, I am not impressed. Why?

2498
02:24:19,581 --> 02:24:20,540
Why is it always your,

2499
02:24:20,541 --> 02:24:23,420
but man that was playing with
your but regular doctors don't,

2500
02:24:23,421 --> 02:24:26,040
but I think it's like that.

2501
02:24:26,050 --> 02:24:28,280
That's how they test the blood
to see what you're eating.

2502
02:24:29,390 --> 02:24:32,450
Plus they probably know it bothers us.
I bet you could learn a lot from shit.

2503
02:24:34,770 --> 02:24:38,480
What did they started giving poop samples
like that was more accurate than than

2504
02:24:38,481 --> 02:24:42,670
pis. I mean we have no problem with
piss samples. Try Shit samples.

2505
02:24:42,690 --> 02:24:47,010
It is shit and colic. Hey,
piano, piano like all right,

2506
02:24:47,030 --> 02:24:48,320
can't believe you're making me do this,

2507
02:24:48,321 --> 02:24:52,230
but I'll do it like w if ups
made you shit in a bucket. Yeah,

2508
02:24:52,760 --> 02:24:56,900
cellophane. The top. We found a new,
there's a new blood, a drug test,

2509
02:24:56,901 --> 02:25:00,040
but we need your shit. That's the only way
you really, no way you're going to, yes,

2510
02:25:00,350 --> 02:25:04,370
you're going to do this and we have
to have at least four pounds of it.

2511
02:25:05,360 --> 02:25:10,340
Can you imagine
getting a friends to ship for them?

2512
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:15,350
Dude, I need your shit to do, do to
just hide in the fucking air duct.

2513
02:25:15,530 --> 02:25:16,670
You have like a bag of shit.

2514
02:25:16,700 --> 02:25:20,660
You're like tap the wall twice and
you dropped down like a fucking demon.

2515
02:25:21,020 --> 02:25:24,160
Take a shit in my bucket and climb
back up bro. What can he get caught?

2516
02:25:24,860 --> 02:25:29,230
It is shit. Listen, you been eating
good. Like eat a lot of fiber.

2517
02:25:29,231 --> 02:25:30,370
Like can you shit on command

2518
02:25:33,240 --> 02:25:37,150
and they don't be dogs and smelled.
There'll be like a steroid sniffing dogs.

2519
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:42,310
It was just a fucking Bagel and
they started eating your shit.

2520
02:25:42,311 --> 02:25:46,750
Then that means you're guilty.
You don't get this puppy.

2521
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:50,560
And when, uh, when he was little, like
as the shit would be coming out of his,

2522
02:25:50,561 --> 02:25:53,190
but he be turning around and trying
to eat it like dance. It was,

2523
02:25:53,260 --> 02:25:56,260
he's was like taking a shit. He's like,
oh he couldn't wait with that. No.

2524
02:25:56,440 --> 02:25:59,510
Like puppies are weird man. They
smell shit and they, they're so,

2525
02:25:59,590 --> 02:26:02,180
they're their babies. They think it's
food. Yeah. They don't understand that.

2526
02:26:02,181 --> 02:26:02,920
Just like bad move.

2527
02:26:02,920 --> 02:26:06,190
Literally like soft serve ice cream coming
out of his ass always turn around and

2528
02:26:06,191 --> 02:26:09,160
try to snatch us. It's like a
thousand times stronger than ours,

2529
02:26:09,390 --> 02:26:11,910
but they don't think it's bad.
Can you imagine what shit smells like?

2530
02:26:11,920 --> 02:26:14,760
Liked the smell shit bad. They
like it. It's like it just,

2531
02:26:14,860 --> 02:26:17,800
it just flips out of like it's
a defense mechanism. Well No,

2532
02:26:17,801 --> 02:26:22,730
they like rotting bodies. Two dogs.
Yeah. Dogs find like a dead beaver.

2533
02:26:22,750 --> 02:26:26,860
Some shifts they'll roll around in it.
They're like, like it on their skin.

2534
02:26:26,890 --> 02:26:27,770
It's weird.
A weird,

2535
02:26:28,430 --> 02:26:32,080
maybe we've been brainwashed into not
liking it because we're supposed to eat

2536
02:26:32,081 --> 02:26:34,630
bugs where I was supposed to eat insects.
Right.

2537
02:26:34,800 --> 02:26:36,910
It was a smart thing to
eat when they're being,

2538
02:26:37,170 --> 02:26:40,000
I mean we wouldn't need to go to
supermarket if we'd like bugs,

2539
02:26:40,001 --> 02:26:41,250
which is eat bugs.
We just trapped.

2540
02:26:41,260 --> 02:26:44,170
We slice and stuff are only
up to a certain point. Like
once you can make shit,

2541
02:26:44,171 --> 02:26:48,020
there's no need to eat them anymore.
But she knows supposed the Ilene. Yeah.

2542
02:26:48,130 --> 02:26:52,930
I was listening to a lecture about this.
Well they were talking about, um, okay.

2543
02:26:52,931 --> 02:26:54,520
No, it was Terence
Mckenna. That's who it was.

2544
02:26:54,760 --> 02:26:59,760
And he was talking about how we used
to be insectivores and so that reward

2545
02:27:00,131 --> 02:27:01,930
system is still in our consciousness.

2546
02:27:01,931 --> 02:27:06,190
That's why people get super excited when
they catch a bug. I'll give you like,

2547
02:27:06,220 --> 02:27:10,180
that's why people like those
butterfly kept catchers.

2548
02:27:10,600 --> 02:27:12,940
They'll like to collect butterflies
and shit and the capture.

2549
02:27:12,941 --> 02:27:17,320
I'm like there's a whole like group of
people you know you can't trophy like no

2550
02:27:17,321 --> 02:27:20,650
one like no, you know like people don't
like trophy hunters. Like it's gross.

2551
02:27:20,651 --> 02:27:22,420
You go over there, shoot Ryan,
I was to put them on your wall.

2552
02:27:23,170 --> 02:27:27,640
Collecting butterflies is totally fine.
Nobody gives a fuck about butterfly.

2553
02:27:27,641 --> 02:27:30,910
They kill them once they get them right.
Well they don't last long anyway.

2554
02:27:30,940 --> 02:27:33,280
So that's like actually
like I guess the mindset.

2555
02:27:33,550 --> 02:27:35,790
But there's people that like
collect them like serial killer.

2556
02:27:35,810 --> 02:27:39,710
I think they have these butterflies
pressed up on the glass and I've,

2557
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:43,720
I've collected all these
beautiful killing all these bugs.

2558
02:27:43,721 --> 02:27:47,090
It's like they're like trophy
hunters. But for bug, that's one step.

2559
02:27:47,360 --> 02:27:50,980
Throwing a fat girl and your well anybody
out there fighting for bug rights?

2560
02:27:51,490 --> 02:27:53,680
Well I'll tell you when it could happen.

2561
02:27:53,740 --> 02:27:57,940
It is possible that it could
happen some day with um, with,

2562
02:27:58,300 --> 02:28:01,570
with there's a bunch of different people
in different parts of the world that he,

2563
02:28:01,571 --> 02:28:05,680
crickets and cricket protein is
like really rich. It's very good.

2564
02:28:05,681 --> 02:28:09,700
Cricket protein is very good for you.
Yeah. Cricket protein powder right there.

2565
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:10,810
People um,

2566
02:28:10,810 --> 02:28:14,800
are starting to turn towards crickets
for animal protein for vitamin B,

2567
02:28:14,801 --> 02:28:15,850
12 for a lot of things.

2568
02:28:16,120 --> 02:28:19,390
And a lot of people that might have
like ethical issues with eating animal

2569
02:28:19,391 --> 02:28:21,860
protein don't have it with like,

2570
02:28:21,890 --> 02:28:24,680
maybe insectivore will be like a thing.

2571
02:28:24,830 --> 02:28:27,890
Like people don't want to mess
necessarily commit to being Vegan,

2572
02:28:28,100 --> 02:28:29,720
but they don't want animals to suffer.

2573
02:28:29,721 --> 02:28:31,520
But they're cool with
eating crickets like that.

2574
02:28:31,820 --> 02:28:33,650
That would actually be a good health move.

2575
02:28:33,860 --> 02:28:37,640
Like you could get a lot of really rich
protein, like look at all the fucking,

2576
02:28:37,641 --> 02:28:41,780
look at all the shit that's in, in,
in crickets. Like how many crickets,

2577
02:28:42,500 --> 02:28:46,220
how many crickets you get out of 10 a
hundred, what is it? 10 gallons of water.

2578
02:28:47,510 --> 02:28:48,710
They're going to be in there anyways.

2579
02:28:48,980 --> 02:28:53,980
So for a hundred gallons of water you
get 71 grams of crickets versus 19 grams

2580
02:28:54,201 --> 02:28:55,790
of chicken.
I don't really know what this means.

2581
02:28:55,820 --> 02:29:00,170
I don't even that it's just so weird and
they must be protein protein versus a

2582
02:29:00,171 --> 02:29:03,740
or or the amount of a weight
of body mass of the animal.

2583
02:29:03,830 --> 02:29:07,070
Cause I would imagine crickets
use very little water, right?

2584
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:08,330
They're creepy little bus.

2585
02:29:08,331 --> 02:29:11,780
They used to create that much less
water use to create that much protein.

2586
02:29:12,060 --> 02:29:14,660
Whereas like cows drink water,

2587
02:29:14,661 --> 02:29:18,550
chickens do like they need actual water.
How long we forced him.

2588
02:29:18,650 --> 02:29:21,680
Asshole comes out and tries to
defend cricket rides. It'll happen.

2589
02:29:21,681 --> 02:29:22,790
It'll also happen with robots.

2590
02:29:22,830 --> 02:29:25,640
As soon as we start making human
looking robots that do shit for us,

2591
02:29:25,940 --> 02:29:28,340
somebody will start to say you
have to treat them a certain way.

2592
02:29:28,400 --> 02:29:30,120
It may or may not happen.
Right.

2593
02:29:31,680 --> 02:29:36,020
There's a real problem that if we figure
out that plants have consciousness and

2594
02:29:36,021 --> 02:29:38,800
they know that plants do have some
consciousness. Yeah, they had,

2595
02:29:38,801 --> 02:29:40,910
they know there's some communication
going on between plants.

2596
02:29:40,911 --> 02:29:43,280
It's just not what we
think of his consciousness,

2597
02:29:43,400 --> 02:29:46,490
first of all because it doesn't
entail moving, but there's,

2598
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:49,280
there's some sort of information
that's being passed on. In fact,

2599
02:29:49,340 --> 02:29:52,610
plants have chemical reactions
to being preyed upon.

2600
02:29:53,030 --> 02:29:56,480
Like clants plants change their floor,
their flavor profile.

2601
02:29:56,720 --> 02:30:00,560
Like they'll make themselves disgusting
for animals to eat just based on whether

2602
02:30:00,561 --> 02:30:03,230
or not an animal is trying to eat them.
So if something eats them,

2603
02:30:03,231 --> 02:30:06,930
it changes the smell of all the animals
around them or all the plants rather

2604
02:30:06,960 --> 02:30:10,610
around them. And then they
change. Like for the Keisha Bush,

2605
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:15,080
they've studied these things when they
go down wind like one will get eaten by a

2606
02:30:15,081 --> 02:30:18,530
giraffe and then the wind will catch
the other trees and the other trees will

2607
02:30:18,531 --> 02:30:22,550
become inedible to the giraffe.
It's filed. It's crazy.

2608
02:30:22,551 --> 02:30:25,370
There's some sort of community.
I have my stuff trimmed,

2609
02:30:25,371 --> 02:30:26,990
wants to know while I'm
like dead fucking that hurt.

2610
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:29,840
I really did the one more with the
snapping in the face and goods plants.

2611
02:30:29,860 --> 02:30:32,210
It's a good question. Like
what is pain though? Right?

2612
02:30:32,211 --> 02:30:36,200
Cause our pain might have to do entirely
with movement in our central nervous

2613
02:30:36,201 --> 02:30:40,070
system, which plans definitely don't have.
So even though there are living thing,

2614
02:30:40,071 --> 02:30:43,010
they might have consciousness but
they might not be experiencing pain.

2615
02:30:43,460 --> 02:30:48,460
But they do know that they have some crazy
rep relationship with fungus and that

2616
02:30:49,311 --> 02:30:53,420
the fungus or extracting minerals from
the dirt and he's like mycelium under the

2617
02:30:53,421 --> 02:30:56,840
ground and they have some
sort of relationship with
the root system and there's

2618
02:30:56,841 --> 02:31:01,841
a whole community and this like exchanges
going on and like these ecosystems of

2619
02:31:01,881 --> 02:31:05,420
plants, like when you see a jungle, we
think about a bunch of individual plants,

2620
02:31:05,421 --> 02:31:07,130
but they're all working together.

2621
02:31:07,131 --> 02:31:12,131
They're all like sinked up in some way
that we're too stupid and self centered

2622
02:31:12,321 --> 02:31:16,610
to consider. Plans gave me the creeps
I like, they fucking creepy out fuck.

2623
02:31:16,611 --> 02:31:20,010
Out of a plant is bugs. There's so
much about them. I don't get in the

2624
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:24,840
fungus. They really do freak me out.
Anybody thinks the understand plants?

2625
02:31:25,410 --> 02:31:30,210
Look at Venus fly traps. Okay. D
that's a plant that kills bugs.

2626
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:34,740
Look at this fucking plant in, I want
to say Ecuador. Is that worth from?

2627
02:31:34,860 --> 02:31:35,641
There's this plant,

2628
02:31:35,641 --> 02:31:40,400
it looks like a flower and mice and rats
go around the edge of it cause it's,

2629
02:31:40,401 --> 02:31:43,110
it's smell sweet and
the smells like rotting,

2630
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:47,550
rotting meat in there and they fall in
and this thing closes up on them and they

2631
02:31:47,551 --> 02:31:51,140
absorb it and eat it.
They eat rats or that goes right to

2632
02:31:52,860 --> 02:31:56,250
check that. Okay. Back that up so I
can see it to sell Venus fly traps.

2633
02:31:56,251 --> 02:31:59,500
You can remember that shit. Look at this
show. This mouse is like, man, that's,

2634
02:31:59,590 --> 02:32:02,640
Michelle knows good. Whoops. I mean
they're now I'm dead. So it gets get out.

2635
02:32:02,670 --> 02:32:06,660
Is it slippery on the sides or does it?
There's a plant. It's just super slippery.

2636
02:32:06,661 --> 02:32:09,870
Like the mouse. It's, it
has a delicious smell.

2637
02:32:10,110 --> 02:32:14,280
So what else comes there and just
falls right in the hole. A frog bitch,

2638
02:32:14,310 --> 02:32:17,920
boom.
Venus fly trap eats a fucking frog son.

2639
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:22,680
And how does the Venus fly trap
actually eat it. Crushed to death.

2640
02:32:24,540 --> 02:32:26,100
Trying to eat it.
It's like just a react.

2641
02:32:26,820 --> 02:32:29,790
It just the reaction and then they
just die and then somehow it just like

2642
02:32:29,791 --> 02:32:31,020
fertilizer just feeds it.

2643
02:32:31,021 --> 02:32:36,021
But it's an accident like that fell in
that plant that could be just like a

2644
02:32:36,331 --> 02:32:41,190
glitch and the design and we're actually
falling in will end up ends up being

2645
02:32:41,191 --> 02:32:42,080
fertilizer anyways.

2646
02:32:42,390 --> 02:32:46,320
All sort of changes in plants or in,

2647
02:32:46,321 --> 02:32:49,770
in in animals is all like
natural selection. Right.

2648
02:32:49,771 --> 02:32:54,450
So there has to be some random mutations
and then some of them stick and then

2649
02:32:54,451 --> 02:32:58,600
the was one funny, another rat shit.
It's going to smell the place up guy.

2650
02:32:59,190 --> 02:33:03,930
Maybe mice were eating it and slowly but
surely figured out a way over millions

2651
02:33:03,930 --> 02:33:08,150
of years to shrink those fucking
mice in the fall and into, yeah.

2652
02:33:09,590 --> 02:33:12,120
So like they fall under and
they starve to death. They die,

2653
02:33:12,210 --> 02:33:15,510
they get absorbed by the plant. What
is there, is there, I don't know,

2654
02:33:15,511 --> 02:33:19,110
some sort of a judge justice breakdown
and just digest them while they're alive.

2655
02:33:19,111 --> 02:33:23,430
Something I want to, shit way
to go eventually dies in there,

2656
02:33:23,431 --> 02:33:27,240
but the frog, the the Venus fly trap.
I didn't even know they can eat a frog.

2657
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:31,380
That's a fucked up way to go.
Yeah. Plant clamps down on you.

2658
02:33:31,480 --> 02:33:32,760
If you're walking through the jungle,

2659
02:33:32,820 --> 02:33:37,560
they need to try to breed gigantic
ones of those two and why can't they?

2660
02:33:37,561 --> 02:33:39,450
If they can manage them in your house,
that's something that

2661
02:33:41,710 --> 02:33:46,420
you had Parana
besides Bronto.

2662
02:33:47,070 --> 02:33:49,830
That was the craziest, I was thinking
about getting crocodiles at one point.

2663
02:33:50,740 --> 02:33:54,810
The illegal or know exactly.
I'm Venus fly trap.

2664
02:33:54,811 --> 02:33:58,830
That's gangster. Giant breeding
giant ones. Big Ones, big ones,

2665
02:34:00,310 --> 02:34:04,070
some what do you call those dudes?
Botanists. Geologists. Triology

2666
02:34:05,640 --> 02:34:08,820
a tree side.
That's actually a great idea.

2667
02:34:08,940 --> 02:34:12,130
Someone should do the giant ones and
that's your security system. Climate.

2668
02:34:12,131 --> 02:34:16,170
Do you need for a Venus flytrap don't
try to rob me. Alero perfect. Kyla,

2669
02:34:16,171 --> 02:34:17,980
you can't grow them
here but what you do or

2670
02:34:17,980 --> 02:34:21,460
as a, as an animal, what a Dick, you
must feel like when a plant catches you.

2671
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:25,240
So fucking humiliating badge if you were
walking through the jungle was probably

2672
02:34:25,241 --> 02:34:28,810
the retards and caught by some plant
that they didn't know about yet because

2673
02:34:28,811 --> 02:34:33,180
there's like hundreds of thousands of
different species in the Amazon and this

2674
02:34:33,181 --> 02:34:36,880
place is in the Amazon that people
just don't go. This is no one there.

2675
02:34:36,881 --> 02:34:39,250
And if there are people that
like these uncontacted tribes,

2676
02:34:39,251 --> 02:34:42,190
they find these villages like, what the
fuck are you doing here? And they're like,

2677
02:34:42,191 --> 02:34:47,191
what are you like this people to this day
that are like these uncontacted tribes

2678
02:34:47,321 --> 02:34:48,370
in the middle of the Amazon?

2679
02:34:48,550 --> 02:34:52,720
I read somewhere that 90% of the bugs
in the Amazon don't have names because

2680
02:34:52,721 --> 02:34:56,050
they've just evolved so quick. They
just can't keep up with the evolution.

2681
02:34:56,051 --> 02:34:57,490
I don't know if that's true or not.
Oh No.

2682
02:34:57,491 --> 02:34:59,860
There's a bunch of bugs that don't
have names, but I'll tell you this.

2683
02:34:59,861 --> 02:35:00,730
When I went to coast,

2684
02:35:00,731 --> 02:35:05,250
I got tricked into going to Costa Rica
once I that thought we were going to

2685
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:07,810
Costa Rica Party, Ken Kuhn,
I was thinking Ken Kuhn,

2686
02:35:07,811 --> 02:35:10,570
the whole time going to Costa
Rica is a bunch of people went.

2687
02:35:10,571 --> 02:35:14,050
I'm thinking Cancun, Cancun. I didn't
know we were going into the jungle.

2688
02:35:14,440 --> 02:35:18,340
We went into the jungle and when
at night to sleep in the jungle.

2689
02:35:18,820 --> 02:35:21,110
A mansion in the jungle.
Oh, that's mentioned. I can,

2690
02:35:21,340 --> 02:35:25,390
but still you're in the middle of
the jungle and at night. Holy Shit.

2691
02:35:25,391 --> 02:35:26,500
I just doused mice.

2692
02:35:26,530 --> 02:35:30,100
I bought all the off at the knee at the
data village and they had like a little

2693
02:35:30,101 --> 02:35:34,060
convenience so I cleaned them out cause
I'm scared of bugs and I didn't want to

2694
02:35:34,061 --> 02:35:37,180
really let anybody know that I
was a big pussy about bugs. I got,

2695
02:35:37,240 --> 02:35:39,940
I got tricked into gone.
I literally die.

2696
02:35:39,970 --> 02:35:44,320
I used off as gel in my hair and put
her all over my face because I knew when

2697
02:35:44,321 --> 02:35:46,150
that sun went down it
was going to get nuts.

2698
02:35:46,151 --> 02:35:47,610
Even in the mansion you
worried about getting,

2699
02:35:47,620 --> 02:35:52,340
we were all hanging out outside of
Soho and the mansion has open, um,

2700
02:35:52,600 --> 02:35:56,590
ceilings. It's open air. Oh Dude.
It was a complete nightmare.

2701
02:35:56,591 --> 02:35:59,410
But my point is at night,
every night we'd all,

2702
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:03,310
we'd all sit in front of the pool and
all first you'd see all the frogs coming

2703
02:36:03,311 --> 02:36:06,010
out of nowhere.
And that first night it was so trippy.

2704
02:36:06,190 --> 02:36:09,280
The guys that live there go, you're going
to love these frogs. Don't be scared.

2705
02:36:09,281 --> 02:36:10,750
They're the ones that are
going to save your ass.

2706
02:36:10,960 --> 02:36:12,280
All these frogs are everywhere in.

2707
02:36:12,281 --> 02:36:14,490
All of a sudden the bugs just
start coming out and it's,

2708
02:36:14,520 --> 02:36:17,770
it really is like Braveheart.
It's a bunch of frogs and you see them.

2709
02:36:17,771 --> 02:36:21,670
You don't have to wait and see.
You just see them just going after bugs.

2710
02:36:21,671 --> 02:36:22,900
It's just a war.
And the guy,

2711
02:36:22,990 --> 02:36:24,970
the guy that lived in a house that
was watching the house, it goes,

2712
02:36:24,971 --> 02:36:27,310
you're going to love this.
It's just chaos.

2713
02:36:29,130 --> 02:36:31,780
Was that they're preventing you from
getting bitten by just eating the fucking

2714
02:36:31,781 --> 02:36:34,570
bus was preventing that. I was cool.
They didn't, they didn't come around me.

2715
02:36:34,571 --> 02:36:37,930
But I swear only once
did I ever see a bug.

2716
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,120
The same species that were all different.

2717
02:36:40,121 --> 02:36:45,121
They're all mobs looked like
mosquitoes that look like centipedes.

2718
02:36:45,131 --> 02:36:46,420
It looked like stick one.

2719
02:36:46,630 --> 02:36:49,420
There were all different and
there was all open air too, right.

2720
02:36:49,421 --> 02:36:51,310
So they were flying in your room and shit,
dude,

2721
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:56,320
I could talk about this one hour,
but they tricked me.

2722
02:36:56,321 --> 02:36:59,380
It was a night mare.

2723
02:37:00,810 --> 02:37:02,200
Cause the people that liked it,

2724
02:37:02,770 --> 02:37:06,250
they're the kind of people that have a
giant like spider moth lands on their

2725
02:37:06,251 --> 02:37:11,200
shoulders. They do. You know, like one
of those dudes, you know what I mean?

2726
02:37:12,890 --> 02:37:14,720
You know those dudes that
don't give a shit about,

2727
02:37:14,721 --> 02:37:17,810
but if you would like Costa Rica,
if you want to move there,

2728
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:21,950
you're 100% one of those guys that
doesn't get around you and you slept here.

2729
02:37:21,960 --> 02:37:22,730
She'll be hosted,

2730
02:37:22,730 --> 02:37:25,200
but no one told me to bring a
fucking net and there was no more.

2731
02:37:25,790 --> 02:37:26,601
Bring your own net,

2732
02:37:26,601 --> 02:37:30,080
put a shit hole the first I walked in
there as soon as soon as we're driving in

2733
02:37:30,081 --> 02:37:34,820
this bus through the jungle, I'm
going, oh my God. How many days?

2734
02:37:35,830 --> 02:37:39,850
It was a nightmare.
Every night was a nut.

2735
02:37:39,970 --> 02:37:40,850
It was a nightmare.

2736
02:37:40,851 --> 02:37:44,900
But I had to keep it inside because there
was girls and when I was single and I,

2737
02:37:45,050 --> 02:37:49,790
it was like a slasher movie
and so I didn't say anything.

2738
02:37:49,790 --> 02:37:53,150
I just knew and I'm like, damn, I thought
it was going to be like king can shit.

2739
02:37:53,360 --> 02:37:57,770
So we get, we get to the Manchin, we
get to the mansion I have and they go,

2740
02:37:57,771 --> 02:38:00,320
your room's air, your rooms there
and everyone's got their own rooms.

2741
02:38:00,321 --> 02:38:04,070
There's a couple of couples, they got a
room and as soon I'm already tripping.

2742
02:38:04,071 --> 02:38:06,860
Uncle Buck when the sun comes down.
Holy Shit,

2743
02:38:06,920 --> 02:38:10,310
I'm a big gigantic vagina
when it comes to bugs,

2744
02:38:11,000 --> 02:38:12,860
like mod scare the shit out of me.

2745
02:38:12,861 --> 02:38:16,070
I'm a big pussy and we're going into
the jungle. That's all I was thinking.

2746
02:38:16,380 --> 02:38:20,360
Oh my God. Oh my God. So as
soon as I walk into my room,

2747
02:38:20,480 --> 02:38:25,480
I noticed that it's all open there and I
look up and there's about 40 50 bees in

2748
02:38:27,141 --> 02:38:29,660
my room.
40 50 be nesting in your room.

2749
02:38:29,661 --> 02:38:31,310
They're just flying all
over the fucking place.

2750
02:38:31,460 --> 02:38:35,010
So I dropped my bags and I go downstairs
and the guy that's watching the match,

2751
02:38:35,011 --> 02:38:39,050
an old Vietnam vet, white guy who left
civil, all those guys live down there.

2752
02:38:39,051 --> 02:38:40,490
They leave their jobs,
they leave their family,

2753
02:38:40,491 --> 02:38:43,130
they try a new life than they hate it.
And now they can't go back.

2754
02:38:43,190 --> 02:38:45,980
Now they can't go back cause they do.
They left everything. Yeah. But anyways,

2755
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:49,730
so I went downstairs and I talked
to this Vietnam vet. I'm like,

2756
02:38:50,330 --> 02:38:53,500
is there supposed to be a bunch of bs?
And I room like God,

2757
02:38:53,510 --> 02:38:57,200
just turn on the ceiling fan on low,
don't turn it too high. It will make just,

2758
02:38:57,290 --> 02:38:59,060
you just want it to be
uncomfortable for them.

2759
02:38:59,240 --> 02:39:02,090
And then a couple hours there'll be gone.
They don't like that little breeze.

2760
02:39:02,540 --> 02:39:05,060
And I'm like, okay, all,
and then I'm thinking,

2761
02:39:05,061 --> 02:39:09,980
what about at night when the bugs
just flood in? And he's said, oh,

2762
02:39:09,981 --> 02:39:14,450
you need a, you need a net to sleeping.
I'm like, Shit, what do you get those?

2763
02:39:15,050 --> 02:39:18,830
It was a, they're usually sold out,
you know? And they were sold out.

2764
02:39:18,860 --> 02:39:22,940
There was no net. So I slept every
night, every night. I said, first of all,

2765
02:39:23,600 --> 02:39:27,110
I was complaining about the bees. I talked
her, I was like, I had to let it out.

2766
02:39:27,111 --> 02:39:30,410
I held it in and I said, dude, you
guys have bees in your only go. Yeah,

2767
02:39:30,411 --> 02:39:32,390
we got bees too. I'm like, oh my God.

2768
02:39:32,391 --> 02:39:36,110
So I started complaining about
bees and then a girl goes, okay,

2769
02:39:36,111 --> 02:39:40,580
captain be watched. We get it. You don't
like bees? And then at that point like,

2770
02:39:40,581 --> 02:39:43,280
fuck, I got to shut the fuck
up. No more peep out of me.

2771
02:39:43,410 --> 02:39:47,810
No Sarcozi captain be watched. Conscious.
The appropriate response. Yeah. Yeah,

2772
02:39:48,020 --> 02:39:51,890
so I never said Shit.
I held it in every night was an ironman.

2773
02:39:51,920 --> 02:39:56,920
I slept in the sheet like completely
covered and you could just hear z z and

2774
02:39:57,650 --> 02:40:00,920
then we now that when I had to
take a leak, the bathroom again,

2775
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:03,320
if you like that you don't,
you don't care about bugs.

2776
02:40:03,321 --> 02:40:06,830
So they want crazy shit like a bathroom.
When you opened the door as a bathroom,

2777
02:40:06,890 --> 02:40:10,460
there's no walls and there's no ceiling.
It's like an outside bathroom.

2778
02:40:10,940 --> 02:40:13,350
They liked that shit.
They like that shit. Oh,

2779
02:40:13,351 --> 02:40:17,700
it's cool that people that don't
mind bugs. If you're like the jungle,

2780
02:40:18,030 --> 02:40:19,050
if you like the jungle,

2781
02:40:19,051 --> 02:40:21,630
that means you don't mind bugs
here that it's like there's like,

2782
02:40:21,810 --> 02:40:26,280
I think 60% of the population that
don't mind bugs. 40% are terrified.

2783
02:40:26,550 --> 02:40:29,910
I'm terrified. That
guy, that pets hornets.

2784
02:40:30,540 --> 02:40:33,060
I watch videos and this
guy to go on youtube.

2785
02:40:33,061 --> 02:40:36,600
There's a guy who will appeal
gently stroke wasps and Hornets.

2786
02:40:36,600 --> 02:40:40,820
He's like really fucking creepy
fingernails, but he touches be there.

2787
02:40:40,830 --> 02:40:44,730
That's probably my greatest
fears every night nightmare. Oh,

2788
02:40:45,420 --> 02:40:48,260
did you get will never go to
a jungle again in my life.

2789
02:40:48,261 --> 02:40:49,860
Did you stumble a baby much off on me.

2790
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:53,700
Had completely doused in pets the bees,

2791
02:40:53,730 --> 02:40:57,550
but he actually does it with
this one probably has. It
looks like a, I don't know.

2792
02:40:58,070 --> 02:41:01,540
That one probably has those
stingers probably in Japanese horn.

2793
02:41:01,541 --> 02:41:04,680
It they're away from the nest. But
uh, this one may not have a stinger,

2794
02:41:04,860 --> 02:41:06,360
but this guy is that
he does it on the nest.

2795
02:41:06,361 --> 02:41:09,750
I've seen guys petting them on the next,
yeah. This guy can live in Costa Rican.

2796
02:41:09,751 --> 02:41:13,320
No problem. That might not have a
stinger. You'd fucking love that man.

2797
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:16,040
It looks like a stand to me PPO.

2798
02:41:16,060 --> 02:41:18,810
They put those things honey on
their finger and it just fuck it.

2799
02:41:18,811 --> 02:41:22,110
It comes up to Jack Him Man is just
trying to sting him though. Yeah,

2800
02:41:22,111 --> 02:41:23,010
he's just avoiding it.

2801
02:41:25,780 --> 02:41:27,870
It keeps trying to jack and
I wish I had those powers.

2802
02:41:27,871 --> 02:41:30,450
I wished there was a pill that
could make me feel like that.

2803
02:41:30,480 --> 02:41:33,560
Why would you want to do that? I wouldn't
take that. Some pharmaceutical get fit.

2804
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:37,350
Get rid of the fear of bugs like you
gotta it gotta be on it every day.

2805
02:41:37,470 --> 02:41:40,290
It's a weird reactions.
What if the shit hit the fan?

2806
02:41:40,440 --> 02:41:43,210
North Korea blows up the United
States and it's not gonna happen.

2807
02:41:43,700 --> 02:41:45,350
North Korea would go to war with Russia.

2808
02:41:45,470 --> 02:41:47,660
We go to war with China at
this place is a disaster,

2809
02:41:47,661 --> 02:41:51,950
but you can live in Costa Rica is still,
it's safe. You just gotta deal with bugs.

2810
02:41:51,980 --> 02:41:52,813
Eddie.

2811
02:41:53,550 --> 02:41:58,170
I would go, you'd get dapped. I
would. You would adapt. You adapt.

2812
02:41:58,210 --> 02:42:01,350
You adapt. But I couldn't bugs
really. A, it's a really weird,

2813
02:42:01,380 --> 02:42:04,830
I don't know how anybody
can be comfortable around
them. I don't get used to it.

2814
02:42:04,920 --> 02:42:09,570
I have silver fish in my apartment.
They fucking disgusting. Fucking whore.

2815
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:13,650
Creepy. But I was diagnosed. I douse
myself every morning, fresh coat.

2816
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:16,020
Does that make you feel creepy?
I didn't give a shit. No.

2817
02:42:16,021 --> 02:42:19,200
I mean like did it make your
body feel worth it was worth it.

2818
02:42:19,201 --> 02:42:23,880
The bugs didn't want not had too much
on me do I put it all over my face,

2819
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:27,170
all over my hair in my balls.
I didn't want to get bitten a dick.

2820
02:42:28,090 --> 02:42:32,910
There's a this stuff like, you know what
line of Cain is like a pain killer? Yeah.

2821
02:42:33,020 --> 02:42:37,030
It's like a numbing cream they
put on. I uh, had a bad sunburn,

2822
02:42:37,031 --> 02:42:38,410
wants like real bad.

2823
02:42:38,440 --> 02:42:42,670
I was in Mexico and I was sitting on
the beach and I was not paying attention

2824
02:42:42,700 --> 02:42:46,000
and I didn't realize how bad I got burned.
My back was on fire.

2825
02:42:46,240 --> 02:42:49,240
I mean it was like serious, serious
pain, especially if I'd start sweating.

2826
02:42:49,780 --> 02:42:53,320
And so I got some, some of this
light of Cain stuff and it says like,

2827
02:42:53,321 --> 02:42:56,450
only put like two pumps of
this shit put on your back.

2828
02:42:56,451 --> 02:42:58,150
Of course I put like 13 pumps.

2829
02:42:58,480 --> 02:43:00,580
I put it all over my back
because my back is an agony.

2830
02:43:00,850 --> 02:43:05,850
And then like an hour plus later
I started feeling like shit,

2831
02:43:06,490 --> 02:43:11,110
like nervous, like sketchy, like
shaky. And I was like, oh my God.

2832
02:43:11,230 --> 02:43:11,980
Got like this

2833
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:16,870
is like almost like I'll like a cousin
of cocaine, you know, it's like,

2834
02:43:16,871 --> 02:43:20,200
it's doing something to me. It's not
like getting me high. Like I'm like,

2835
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:25,540
no, no, I felt shaky and creepy. And you
want to have sex. I didn't want to eat,

2836
02:43:25,570 --> 02:43:27,980
I didn't want to do any of that.
Did it go into your skin right here?

2837
02:43:28,080 --> 02:43:29,260
Fucking central nervous system,

2838
02:43:33,270 --> 02:43:37,000
but it makes your Dick numb. That's
like the thing. It's a numbing cream.

2839
02:43:37,570 --> 02:43:42,100
Like Dick would wilt with the numbing
cream and I feel it. When I was a kid,

2840
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:46,450
my problem when I first
started having sex young,

2841
02:43:46,480 --> 02:43:50,290
I was 13 my girlfriend was 13 she talked
me into it. I didn't want to have sex.

2842
02:43:50,291 --> 02:43:54,850
I was cool with dry humping, but I was
cool with that. I was really aggressive.

2843
02:43:54,851 --> 02:43:58,090
It took like 10 months to get the
dry humping. It took a long time.

2844
02:43:58,091 --> 02:44:01,180
But once I got the dry humping, I
would not, she would not. We were done.

2845
02:44:01,990 --> 02:44:05,950
We never got hit a big wall.
We plateaued, but my problem,

2846
02:44:05,951 --> 02:44:07,590
well we ended up having sex and the,

2847
02:44:07,600 --> 02:44:12,160
after the 10th time she started crying and
I asked her, what's going on? She goes,

2848
02:44:12,910 --> 02:44:13,581
this is no way.

2849
02:44:13,581 --> 02:44:16,810
They thought it was going to be nice
and I know what the fuck I did wrong.

2850
02:44:16,811 --> 02:44:19,990
So I told my brother was older and he
was really experienced with girls at that

2851
02:44:19,991 --> 02:44:23,920
point. And the first thing
he said is, well, how long
are you fucking her? I said,

2852
02:44:23,921 --> 02:44:27,550
I don't know. Minute, 90
seconds. I don't know,

2853
02:44:27,820 --> 02:44:32,200
cause dude, that's why she started crying.
Dude, you've got to hold that shit.

2854
02:44:32,530 --> 02:44:36,610
So I had a problem. I was premature
ejaculation. Like that was my big problem.

2855
02:44:38,310 --> 02:44:42,640
So, uh, my brother gave me this cream
called, it was called stay hard.

2856
02:44:43,550 --> 02:44:45,550
That's how the poor of shops,
shit,

2857
02:44:46,060 --> 02:44:50,470
it was called the s s s t
a just without the y hard.

2858
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:55,060
And I used that to just to, to, you know,
so I could last a couple more minutes,

2859
02:44:55,180 --> 02:44:56,020
but didn't really work.

2860
02:44:56,050 --> 02:44:58,720
I remember guys would always say that
there was talk about that. So yeah,

2861
02:44:58,721 --> 02:44:59,830
the reason one of those
girls could do the,

2862
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:02,320
they put the shit on the Duke so
they don't feel anything. Yeah.

2863
02:45:02,321 --> 02:45:05,530
That's why they could folks along
first time, five minutes for me.

2864
02:45:05,531 --> 02:45:09,090
Then my shit just went right through.
It almost came by, it was fucking gay.

2865
02:45:09,091 --> 02:45:11,800
I was getting blown.
Me and my friend were hanging out and uh,

2866
02:45:11,801 --> 02:45:14,950
I had my dick through a hulk
doll and my friend is blowing me.

2867
02:45:14,951 --> 02:45:17,120
I didn't know what come was,
so I felt that come coming.

2868
02:45:17,140 --> 02:45:20,530
So I ran to the toilet and stood over it
and nothing happened. It was a real dud.

2869
02:45:21,470 --> 02:45:22,810
Um,

2870
02:45:22,960 --> 02:45:27,960
this dude that I know that was in the
porn business told me that back in the

2871
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:33,130
day, they used to literally inject some
sort of chemical into the vein and their

2872
02:45:33,610 --> 02:45:36,880
average yet they use to make their, what
is it average yet? They still do that,

2873
02:45:36,881 --> 02:45:38,830
but it can fuck your dick up so bad.

2874
02:45:38,831 --> 02:45:41,290
It can turn purple and black
cause the blood doesn't leave it.

2875
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:45,310
It's called Havard Jabber jet, I
think. I think it's cabbage yet. Yeah.

2876
02:45:45,311 --> 02:45:48,430
I've talked to guys who have used it
and they said one guy said that his dick

2877
02:45:48,431 --> 02:45:53,120
almost would've died. I, no,
no, no. I think he needed
to have the, uh, the pledge,

2878
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:54,280
right.
Drained.

2879
02:45:54,370 --> 02:45:56,560
But he had a real problem with it
and he said he wouldn't do it again.

2880
02:45:56,920 --> 02:46:01,540
It got so bad in the porn industry that
they got their own form of Usada testing

2881
02:46:01,541 --> 02:46:05,140
porn stars for Viagara. Oh
my God. Like it wasn't fair.

2882
02:46:05,200 --> 02:46:07,990
Porn stars Viagara the business
would call apps. Can you imagine,

2883
02:46:07,991 --> 02:46:10,460
go back to those 19 days when John Holmes

2884
02:46:10,460 --> 02:46:15,320
had a limp snake. He's trying to
like shove it in checks or on Bola.

2885
02:46:15,430 --> 02:46:18,860
You remember our Bulla, he looked, he was
the fucking the worst looking guy ever.

2886
02:46:18,920 --> 02:46:22,620
But John Holmes, isn't that the guy
with the giant tick? Johnny White? Yeah.

2887
02:46:23,390 --> 02:46:27,360
All medications ever invented isn't,

2888
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:30,720
isn't Viagara the most effective?
That's the one that works. The bad.

2889
02:46:30,721 --> 02:46:35,270
The side effects of Lisa's heart is bad
for you. I mean it was a side effect.

2890
02:46:36,760 --> 02:46:41,390
Yeah. But now it's wonderful, but the side
effects of it, like pretty mild stuff.

2891
02:46:41,391 --> 02:46:44,510
Who knows? But how many people
are dropping dead of that?

2892
02:46:45,560 --> 02:46:49,340
Are People dropping dead by
Agra? What does it say? You know,

2893
02:46:49,341 --> 02:46:53,020
fibrosis from this coverage act
is one of the, Oh, Caverject.

2894
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:59,480
What is that? What's penile fibrosis?
And that sounds like a dick saying.

2895
02:46:59,481 --> 02:47:01,880
It's like we would know what the
fuck that is. You have to explain.

2896
02:47:03,370 --> 02:47:07,480
It's like psoriasis of the
Dick Penis Shit to form.

2897
02:47:07,490 --> 02:47:12,110
Penis shaped that way. Hmm.
I wonder what it looks like.

2898
02:47:12,830 --> 02:47:16,940
Maybe a curves down. That's good. Damn.

2899
02:47:16,941 --> 02:47:21,200
There's some chaos tonight.
I guess we missed a bunch of chaos.

2900
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:27,050
So we found out that Brennan
shop is a fucking genius. Genius.

2901
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:32,060
He's a soothsayer. Is that the word?
Uh, he's uh, he sees the future.

2902
02:47:32,770 --> 02:47:35,770
It's a prognosticator he's dead
right? He's right. He couldn't,

2903
02:47:35,780 --> 02:47:38,960
couldn't give it to go up
kid unless he killed Canela.

2904
02:47:39,680 --> 02:47:42,740
I wonder what the general public
thinks about the decision,

2905
02:47:42,860 --> 02:47:47,140
whether or not they think it
was a good decision. Yeah.

2906
02:47:47,790 --> 02:47:51,140
We're insulated to hear the
interview, but uh, yeah,

2907
02:47:51,150 --> 02:47:54,350
he didn't speak English anyway.
No, I forget what he thinks.

2908
02:47:54,351 --> 02:47:58,040
What I to he of course he, I'm sure
he thinks he won. I would like to see,

2909
02:47:58,460 --> 02:48:01,520
I don't think he thinks of one, but what
if he says like, you know what? I didn't,

2910
02:48:01,521 --> 02:48:04,150
when he deserves it as a bad decision.
What if he says something like that?

2911
02:48:04,370 --> 02:48:07,370
That would be ballsy.
That's a ballsy move guys up.

2912
02:48:07,371 --> 02:48:11,210
That said that recently in the UFC, right?
Yeah. There was someone who has that.

2913
02:48:12,320 --> 02:48:15,950
He won a bad decision and he's like,
you know what? I didn't win. Yeah.

2914
02:48:15,980 --> 02:48:20,510
Who was that? I don't know man. I
see too many fucking fights. Eh?

2915
02:48:21,680 --> 02:48:26,680
Are you going to be there on
October 7th for Beautiful Vegas?

2916
02:48:28,860 --> 02:48:31,550
Yeah. It's going to be insane, man.

2917
02:48:31,670 --> 02:48:35,930
He's training like a fucking
machine. I'm sure he is. Holy Shit.

2918
02:48:36,170 --> 02:48:39,800
His jujitsu is sharper than ever,
man.

2919
02:48:41,500 --> 02:48:45,740
You know it's going to be a great fight.
It's very fun. Very interesting fight.

2920
02:48:45,741 --> 02:48:50,030
Big Step up for Kevin Lee. Yeah,
he's a, he's an animal. He's a beast.

2921
02:48:50,031 --> 02:48:53,930
He's explosive. He's fast. He's got
a really good, a rear naked choke.

2922
02:48:53,931 --> 02:48:57,350
He likes getting the back and putting
a anacondas in body triangles.

2923
02:48:57,620 --> 02:49:02,190
He likes that. He likes super well
rounded. Yup. Yup. And surging,

2924
02:49:02,510 --> 02:49:06,830
surging young guy, you know, only like
25 but you got to kill Tanita beat him.

2925
02:49:06,920 --> 02:49:07,980
You do.
You've got to

2926
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:12,270
kill him. He's a savage. There's no way
he's, he's going to fight to the death.

2927
02:49:12,300 --> 02:49:15,050
Does he rent the same house every
time when he goes up to big bear,

2928
02:49:15,060 --> 02:49:18,200
does he do it in a different
house? Yeah, Tito's place.

2929
02:49:18,280 --> 02:49:21,450
I think it was still for sale for awhile
back and we just work out at his house.

2930
02:49:21,451 --> 02:49:24,720
It just turn the garage out,
turn it into a little Jiu Jitsu,

2931
02:49:24,721 --> 02:49:28,470
the room and we just fucking work.
She's still fighting Tito? Yeah,

2932
02:49:28,471 --> 02:49:29,970
he's got a couple more fights going on.

2933
02:49:30,540 --> 02:49:35,010
He said he's supposed to fight Chael
Sonnen again and he wants to fight uh,

2934
02:49:35,250 --> 02:49:38,640
chocolate Dell. I think they check.
You have any interest in that? Yeah,

2935
02:49:38,641 --> 02:49:42,600
he needs that cash. Tina used to
have the sweetest set up up there.

2936
02:49:42,601 --> 02:49:44,820
He had crazy big log houses,

2937
02:49:44,910 --> 02:49:47,790
like two of them and one of them
is fighters would stay in that.

2938
02:49:47,790 --> 02:49:48,571
He was training with one of them.

2939
02:49:48,571 --> 02:49:52,300
He would stay in and he had a whole
gym set up with a full size octagon,

2940
02:49:52,330 --> 02:49:56,430
the whole deal. Pretty fucking dope.
And it was for sale for a while.

2941
02:49:56,460 --> 02:49:57,720
I don't know if anybody bought it,

2942
02:49:58,170 --> 02:50:01,920
but Tito was one of the first UFC fighters
to realize that I just fucking hit up

2943
02:50:01,921 --> 02:50:05,700
to big bear, man. Get that work in up
there. It's worth it. How old is Tito?

2944
02:50:06,780 --> 02:50:10,560
I would say now he's probably 37 38.
If I had to guess,

2945
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,930
why do you feel when you got by going
to home? Find out how old title.

2946
02:50:15,300 --> 02:50:18,510
I've been aware of it like 30,000.
You know when you do a camp up there,

2947
02:50:18,511 --> 02:50:23,100
you feel like you've done everything
right and you've done everything you can.

2948
02:50:23,300 --> 02:50:28,080
Some mentally 42 just being up
there. Yeah, right. Mentally. Yeah,

2949
02:50:28,500 --> 02:50:32,040
I'm doing, I'm up in big bear. That's
like there's nowhere else to go.

2950
02:50:32,041 --> 02:50:36,060
That's the spot, right? These at as
high as you can train in I California,

2951
02:50:36,061 --> 02:50:40,800
California. Cow. It's smart.
You don't want to go any
higher. Um, like I said, the,

2952
02:50:40,840 --> 02:50:42,420
the best guys now,

2953
02:50:42,450 --> 02:50:47,450
most of the time they tried to work at
sea level and sleep up high for endurance

2954
02:50:48,540 --> 02:50:50,700
glove gun does. He doesn't
work out in Big Ben. No,

2955
02:50:50,701 --> 02:50:54,690
I think he works out of whatever
the fuck he does. Doubt that shit.

2956
02:50:54,890 --> 02:50:59,890
Cause that guy when 100% all 12 rounds
and he wasn't tired at all at the end.

2957
02:51:00,570 --> 02:51:03,390
Well for sure it's definitely beneficial.
The question is,

2958
02:51:03,391 --> 02:51:07,850
is it the maximum amount of benefit?
It doesn't need any more to be more maxi.

2959
02:51:08,150 --> 02:51:11,110
Why? He could imagine, check
this out, check this show. Right.

2960
02:51:11,760 --> 02:51:14,940
We know what big bear does
by watching glove. Good.

2961
02:51:15,130 --> 02:51:19,590
They're doing it the new way might
be better, but who's proven that?

2962
02:51:20,070 --> 02:51:22,980
Let me see a file. Let me see a high
level of fight like that. Let me see.

2963
02:51:22,981 --> 02:51:27,780
12 rounds like that. Oh you went down,
you trained at sea level and then slept.

2964
02:51:28,370 --> 02:51:29,580
I mean I could see that working,

2965
02:51:29,581 --> 02:51:33,300
but we already know what the glove
can style works. We already know that.

2966
02:51:33,450 --> 02:51:36,480
We know that. You know it's a
good point and I fuck with it.

2967
02:51:36,510 --> 02:51:38,640
We know it works because if
one of them works better,

2968
02:51:38,641 --> 02:51:41,640
if one of them works better, I think it
works. I think that would be like shit.

2969
02:51:41,641 --> 02:51:44,190
We don't even know if that even
works at all. No, it does work.

2970
02:51:44,220 --> 02:51:46,800
They don't know how it works.
Who Does it? I don't know.

2971
02:51:46,980 --> 02:51:51,980
I know that they've done these studies
on a oxygen utilization and you know they

2972
02:51:52,021 --> 02:51:55,250
do. Did they do those studies do
what's called vo two Max tests.

2973
02:51:55,920 --> 02:52:00,570
It's very clear like you can just watch
glow going against Canelo and I saw his

2974
02:52:00,571 --> 02:52:04,350
ass. I wouldn't change shit. I want to
go, you know what? This might be better.

2975
02:52:04,380 --> 02:52:08,050
Let's try that. If he had 10% more
endurance and he stopped, you know,

2976
02:52:08,110 --> 02:52:09,160
and canal training,

2977
02:52:10,210 --> 02:52:13,360
endurance training because of that woman.

2978
02:52:13,540 --> 02:52:16,900
That's what you gotta do is
heritable cardio but glove.

2979
02:52:16,901 --> 02:52:20,800
Kim's cardio is clearly better because
canola was dropping back. Well,

2980
02:52:20,801 --> 02:52:23,080
he couldn't keep the pressure.
He wanted to rest a little bit.

2981
02:52:23,350 --> 02:52:27,460
Glove killing was clearly in better shape.
What is on [inaudible] mom's shirt?

2982
02:52:28,720 --> 02:52:33,370
What are all those little gold? It
doesn't matter. As long as it's gold, man,

2983
02:52:33,371 --> 02:52:37,390
that's all the matters. Those glasses,
I hope they're not even real glasses.

2984
02:52:37,810 --> 02:52:40,390
I liked those clear lenses. Come
on, man. Those are some dope.

2985
02:52:40,420 --> 02:52:42,610
That's what I'm saying.
I hope they're just dope clear lenses.

2986
02:52:43,120 --> 02:52:46,210
Michael Cardio is so fucking terrible.
Like I literally,

2987
02:52:46,211 --> 02:52:49,190
I can't do 10 minutes on a treadmill.
You can do 10 minutes on a treadmill.

2988
02:52:49,191 --> 02:52:52,330
You've got to start at four and then
work your way up to five and then

2989
02:52:52,331 --> 02:52:56,440
eventually six. So this is the apnea.
Fuck it. This shit. I walk up the steps.

2990
02:52:56,450 --> 02:52:59,620
I'm like, ugh. Like I shouldn't be
feeling this. It's fucking awful.

2991
02:52:59,650 --> 02:53:01,210
You got to do something about that.
I know.

2992
02:53:01,211 --> 02:53:03,980
I might get the surgery again and
then go with the man because I Mac,

2993
02:53:03,981 --> 02:53:06,820
he was telling me take you Jitsu, but
I'm like, I'm exhausted all the time.

2994
02:53:06,821 --> 02:53:10,660
I really want to take it. But I
like that weird. It sucks dude.

2995
02:53:11,110 --> 02:53:15,340
Fuck it often is rough.
That's a rough thing man. It's
yours is all fucked up too.

2996
02:53:15,341 --> 02:53:17,960
Cause it's like central nervous system
stuff, right? It's not your, it's,

2997
02:53:17,970 --> 02:53:22,870
it's the both. Both kinds. Just science.
My fucking blow us. Speaking of which,

2998
02:53:22,871 --> 02:53:25,960
let's wrap this pitch up. I've got
to hit at the comedy store tonight.

2999
02:53:26,080 --> 02:53:30,760
Can I live a couple of dates? October
10th October 10th at the Ice House.

3000
02:53:30,761 --> 02:53:34,360
We're doing me and Sam
Tripoli Tin Foil Hat. Kameni.

3001
02:53:34,570 --> 02:53:37,190
We're going to just make fun of comedy,
uh,

3002
02:53:37,300 --> 02:53:41,080
conspiracy theorists and then doing his
podcast. Is that what it is? No, no.

3003
02:53:41,110 --> 02:53:46,070
It's a comedy show. Comedy show.
Nothing but conspiracy dairy themes. Oh,

3004
02:53:46,071 --> 02:53:49,420
you know, he's got that podcast.
Tinfoil hat conspiracy. Exactly.

3005
02:53:49,421 --> 02:53:52,690
That's why we call it that. Just cool.
Just going to, what's the date again?

3006
02:53:53,470 --> 02:53:57,460
Tuesday,
October 10th October 22nd Ebi,

3007
02:53:57,970 --> 02:54:01,210
13 Gary, Tony, lightweights, we're
going to have reach you, boogie man,

3008
02:54:01,211 --> 02:54:06,211

November 12th is Combat Jujitsu worlds.

3009
02:54:06,790 --> 02:54:08,620

I feel worthless enough when
I'm working muscles for a lot,

3027
