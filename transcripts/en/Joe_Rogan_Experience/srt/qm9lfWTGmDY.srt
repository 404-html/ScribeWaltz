1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
Vanette close.
Are we close?

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,813
I'll be close.
All right.

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,103
Okay.

4
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,380
Oh,
sweet baby.

5
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:09,570
Jesus.
We uh,

6
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:13,150
live Gavin mcinnes first beer already
cracked,

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:16,240
dressed up like Michael Douglas and
falling down showing the briefcase.

8
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,030
Sean with a briefcase.
I got the exact briefcase he had.

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,910
Are those the same glasses he had
basically yet ray bans and I got him.

10
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,250
Normally detector would not wear a
pocket protector.

11
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,750
Correct?
No one wears him anymore.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,090
But everyone in the movie has one.
Yeah.

13
00:00:31,091 --> 00:00:32,980
Whenever you want to have a geek in a
movie,

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,290
like some sort of scientific character
science character,

15
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,000
he has to have a pocket protector.
Well,

16
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:40,240
I got all this on Ebay.
If you have some pre planning,

17
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,450
you can get a costume for like 10 bucks.
So this is a dollar 50.

18
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,420
You would have taken me months to find
this on the street.

19
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,250
Yeah.
How do you find a pocket protector?

20
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:50,140
Ebay.
Ebay,

21
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,270
Ebay,
Ebay and the tie,

22
00:00:52,271 --> 00:00:52,660
I assume.

23
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:54,400
Is Yours the shirt?
Is that a your shirt?

24
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:55,900
Did you buy that shirt?
It's a great example.

25
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,940
I'm talking about,
I had to find this in New York.

26
00:00:57,941 --> 00:01:01,060
It took me like two hours.
I had to go to a uniform supply store.

27
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,600
Huge pain in the ass.
I could've got it on Ebay or Amazon for

28
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:05,890
two seconds.
Yeah,

29
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:10,030
that's a weird kind of shirt.
A button up shirt with short sleeves

30
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:12,130
that you wear with a tie.
That's an odd look.

31
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:15,550
It's like I'm formal,
but I'm not because I need my forearms

32
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:16,600
free.
Yeah,

33
00:01:16,601 --> 00:01:18,790
it's like La.
Everyone in that movie has one.

34
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,230
It's like an la business.
It guy back then back then,

35
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,910
now no one wears them anymore.
Now it's like like a like a hoodie

36
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,300
that's like an it guy where like a weird
tee shirt and a hoodie.

37
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:33,130
Like Jamie be dressed.
Exactly like Jamie.

38
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,360
Look,
that's what a Hoodie,

39
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,180
that's what a an it guy's dressed
meeting in the form too.

40
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,220
They all went at American apparel
sweatshirt.

41
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,470
Exactly.
Oh,

42
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:44,170
that's his own.
That's a Jamie Vernon special.

43
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,350
It says pull that shit up.
Yeah,

44
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,710
and you can get that@ayoungjamie.com
what does that mean?

45
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:52,360
Pull that shit up.
I always telling them,

46
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,000
whenever there's something going on in
the news or we're talking about

47
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:56,470
something,
we don't know what the answer is.

48
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,401
Like what is that?
Oh,

49
00:01:57,401 --> 00:01:58,270
pull it.
Shut up Jamie,

50
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,580
and it'll find it up on youtube.
Huh?

51
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,820
Speaking to pull that shit up.
I liked this.

52
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,660
I like your,
your profile because I think you get

53
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:12,520
lumped into like a lot of like really
fucked up crazy people because you've

54
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:15,310
got some controversial ideas.
But I like what you did.

55
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:20,580
I liked this pro west pro gun pro life
pro gay pro Israel pro trump,

56
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,470
anti Nazi.

57
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:26,080
I don't know what Antifa is.
I see it all the time.

58
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,250
I'm sure you can explain it to us.
Uh,

59
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,430
anticensorship antifeminist anti Islam.
He leave your heart on your sleeve.

60
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,920
You've got it all.
It's really handy to do that.

61
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:39,280
I just did that about a week ago.
But in this day and age,

62
00:02:39,281 --> 00:02:41,770
we're in a weird era where it's like a
philosophy age.

63
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:44,740
We're all Romans all of a sudden,
like socrates sitting here

64
00:02:44,741 --> 00:02:47,650
philosophizing.
And you kind of have to make everyone

65
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,900
know exactly where you stand on this
spectrum.

66
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,930
Because if you're slightly right of
center,

67
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,900
your alt right and your go,
no,

68
00:02:55,901 --> 00:02:59,770
those guys hate me but I hate these guys
so I'm right.

69
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,900
You're pro gay.
Yeah.

70
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:05,540
I think gays are just,
you're born gay and the idea that I

71
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,400
know,
I know I've,

72
00:03:06,401 --> 00:03:10,300
I lived in the city since I was 18 so
I've been around gays for a quarter

73
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,880
century and I think of these guys I know
that had been together for 10 years and

74
00:03:12,881 --> 00:03:14,290
I go,
so let me get this straight.

75
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,330
This,
these two are going to break up

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,050
according to you and evangelical person
and then they're just going to make out

77
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,910
with some chick with blonde hair and eat
her out

78
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,500
and like fucker and have a boner and
pray to God.

79
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,810
Come on.
You'd know that won't happen.

80
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:33,160
I,
I wonder how much of homosexual behavior

81
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,110
could be induced by molestation and
early age though.

82
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,670
Yeah,
that's the million dollar question

83
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,520
because that seems to be a real factor.
It's not,

84
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:47,230
and this is not the nine people that are
born gay,

85
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:51,850
but I think there's a spectrum and I
think there's most certainly some gay

86
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:56,851
acts that are committed on young people
and horrifically those people tend to on

87
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:03,040
a a pretty frequent basis do the same
thing to other young kids,

88
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,750
young kids.
Really Weird in,

89
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:07,330
in,
in terms of like the victims becoming

90
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,890
the victimizer.
Yeah.

91
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,410
I know where you're going with this.
We're walking into the elephant in the

92
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,191
room,
but what kind of,

93
00:04:12,191 --> 00:04:16,120
not even mean just just talking about,
I was listening to the George to Chi

94
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:19,150
interview today because they're trying
to pull up everybody now that the Milo

95
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:22,480
thing is out there,
they're pulling up everybody who in any

96
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:25,720
way it has condoned sex with underage
people.

97
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,130
And George to Kai was talking about his
own experiences in camp and it was on

98
00:04:30,131 --> 00:04:34,240
the stern show and he was just talking
about what he,

99
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:39,480
the way he was describing it as a
positive experience with a kid who was

100
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:42,460
in his late teens,
I think he said he was 19 and he was

101
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:46,000
like 13 somewhere in that age.
And you know,

102
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:50,230
it's absolutely child molestation.
It's absolutely illegal.

103
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,700
But the way he was describing it,
he was pretty much describing it as a

104
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,350
positive experience,
right?

105
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,000
Which when it's your experience,
I mean,

106
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,400
it's illegal.
The guy did something that was against

107
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:05,890
the law.
But boy,

108
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:09,280
that's a weird area because it's his
experience.

109
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:10,780
And he was talking about,
yeah,

110
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,390
well here's the deal and this is a
mistake Maiello made.

111
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:18,220
You have to acknowledge that what you're
talking about is fucked up and horrible

112
00:05:18,221 --> 00:05:22,600
and wrong,
but you just so happen to have not had a

113
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:27,601
bad experience within those parameters.
Like say you were raped as a woman and

114
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:29,380
you came,
right?

115
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,360
Uh,
which by the way happens for some

116
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,490
strange reason.
So if you're one of those women in,

117
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:36,910
you're about to say that you have to
understand that we're going into a very

118
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:38,770
dangerous place right now.
And you can't say,

119
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,690
look,
some rapes are absolutely fabulous,

120
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,760
and women have come from them.
You have to say,

121
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,860
this is fucking horrible.
Rape is evil.

122
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:48,150
But I buy some weird freak of nature
actually liked,

123
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,320
or a murderer.
I'm sure there's times when you murdered

124
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,570
a guy and he ended up,
he was a mass murder and it was a good

125
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:53,350
murder.
Right?

126
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:53,951
And you go,
okay,

127
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,120
this,
I'm describing a murder.

128
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,700
I'm not condoning murder.
But in this weird case it worked.

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,390
And Milo's mistake was he said it worked
for me.

130
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:06,980
And then he implied that it could work
for a ton of other gays to be fucked at

131
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,330
13.
Well he did that,

132
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:11,540
um,
drunken peasants podcast and his take on

133
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:15,260
it from the drunken peasants was
different than his take on it from mine.

134
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,060
And on my podcast it seemed more like he
was trying to make light of something

135
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:22,850
that most likely definitely did happen
to him.

136
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:23,740
The father,
Michael.

137
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,100
Yeah.
So there's two,

138
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,490
there's the father Michael thing,
and I don't know if I believe that.

139
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,860
I think that's just a,
I've heard him say that joke a few times

140
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,750
where he's like,
I'd never would've given such good head

141
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:34,270
if it wasn't for Father Michael.
Right.

142
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,460
So you think that might be something
like that he's constructed?

143
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,110
I don't believe it.
I don't know why.

144
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,260
That's just my gut.
And then the other thing was condoning

145
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,720
sexual relationships with 13 year olds.
And he said,

146
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:49,750
especially in the gay world,
now I know of straight guys who were a

147
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:51,650
strict,
I'm thinking of in particular who was

148
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:55,580
molested at camp and it was by an older
gay camp counselor.

149
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,300
This guy thinks of that guy every day,
falls them on Linkedin,

150
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,920
hoping he'll die.
He wants to murder him.

151
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,280
Uh,
so the problem with what Milo said is

152
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,970
you end up normalizing this behavior and
say it's okay if in the gay world,

153
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:10,910
next thing you know,
some older gay who's at Camp Goes,

154
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:13,100
well,
this is probably a fag that I'm blowing.

155
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,031
Right?
So this is,

156
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:15,950
okay.
Yeah.

157
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,590
So what I say to these gays,
these 13 year old gates to go,

158
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:20,480
I would be okay with fucking a 29 year
old.

159
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,261
I go,
well,

160
00:07:21,261 --> 00:07:24,320
I'm sorry,
but we're not normalizing that because

161
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,260
the vast,
vast majority of times it doesn't turn

162
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,460
out well.
So No.

163
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,890
Yeah,
that's a very good way of putting it,

164
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,210
you know,
and it's,

165
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,000
it's really disturbed.
Well done.

166
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,010
The Milo thing is so odd because first
of all,

167
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:42,011
I think he's got this act and let's call
it an act cause part of it has got to be

168
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,840
an act.
He's got a wide spectrum of his

169
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,870
personalities.
So on Bill Maher he can be a raging

170
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:50,960
liberace queen with pearls on dress like
a woman.

171
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:52,330
I mean just like a woman.
Yeah.

172
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,770
Camper than any woman I know.
Yeah.

173
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,770
And then for the apology,
he's the conservative with the coke

174
00:07:57,771 --> 00:07:58,600
bottle glasses.

175
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,910
Yeah.
It's sorta like when a Jamaican goes

176
00:08:01,911 --> 00:08:04,610
back to Jamaica and they start speaking
in Patois,

177
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,610
like their grandmother and not
necessarily lying.

178
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,700
It's just a wide range of use.
Yeah.

179
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:14,060
He plays it up and there it,
there's definitely a performance piece

180
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:16,030
to a lot of what he does.
What's,

181
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,060
what's really interesting is he's very
good at riling people up.

182
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:22,790
He's obviously very good at getting
people upset and,

183
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:26,480
and in doing so,
he's created these sort of false

184
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,820
narratives about him,
that he's a Nazi,

185
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,640
that he promotes genocide.
I mean,

186
00:08:31,641 --> 00:08:34,280
there was so many people outside the
Berkeley thing that were screaming,

187
00:08:34,281 --> 00:08:39,281
calling them a Nazi and saying he's a
fascist when they in fact were behaving

188
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,380
in very authoritarian fascist ways.
That's Antifa by the way,

189
00:08:45,681 --> 00:08:47,030
you said,
I don't know what Antifa is.

190
00:08:47,031 --> 00:08:50,100
That's those guys antifascist is that
what Antifa stands for?

191
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,580
But you're right,
they're terrorists and they use terror.

192
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:54,740
They use violence to achieve political
gains,

193
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:59,741
which terrorism and these people,
it's not like Milo ever set or trump

194
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:04,290
even ever said anything that is remotely
close to genocide,

195
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,860
but those guys just go.
Anyone that wants to enforce immigration

196
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:11,820
laws is a fucking Nazi.
So I need violence cause I'm trying to

197
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:15,060
stop Hitler.
I'm around the first stages of Hitler,

198
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:17,400
so I'm going back in time and strangling
him in his crib.

199
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:18,480
Right,
right.

200
00:09:18,481 --> 00:09:22,980
But the problem is the way they're
reacting to it is the absolute wrong way

201
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:26,220
to react to someone who sang something
that you don't agree with.

202
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:30,060
Oh yeah.
The the right way is to say something

203
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,960
that you feel opposes what they're
saying and makes more sense to debate

204
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,430
them.
That's the beauty of free speech,

205
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:38,940
like w it has no limits.
If you want to get out there and deny

206
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:41,760
the Holocaust,
you want to get out there and sexualized

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,190
toddlers all go to your talk.

208
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,050
I want to hear it.
Then in the q and a,

209
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,850
I'll shoot you down.
Well not,

210
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:50,400
I don't think he even should just be a q
and a.

211
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:53,350
I mean I think it should be real clear
other there.

212
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:56,970
There should be someone and we shouldn't
just rely on the audience to come up

213
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,180
with some sort of a response.
I think if you're going to have someone

214
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:04,710
as controversial as Milo and you are so
opposed to it that you're willing to

215
00:10:04,711 --> 00:10:08,430
throw bricks through starbucks windows
and light cop cars on fire,

216
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:12,810
there should be someone that can speak
for your side and then you should

217
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:16,050
organize some sort of a talk.
But this is setting it up the wrong way

218
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:19,020
because you go,
it's like someone said to me once,

219
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:19,751
hey man,
you know,

220
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:21,210
like we were talking about martial arts
falls,

221
00:10:21,211 --> 00:10:22,980
black belt.
I'd fucking kick everybody's ass.

222
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:24,053
No,
you wouldn't.

223
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,511
No,
you wouldn't.

224
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:25,590
First of all,
you wouldn't because you'd have

225
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,870
discipline and you'd realize the
consequences of that.

226
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:30,150
But second of all,
when you just kick someone's ass,

227
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,120
they don't,
they don't just take it like they come

228
00:10:33,121 --> 00:10:35,390
back with a bat or a gun or their
brother,

229
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,770
he started fighting.
They want to get it back and it goes

230
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:42,630
back and forth and back and forth.
And all conflict pretty much goes that

231
00:10:42,631 --> 00:10:44,760
way.
You have conflict and then someone

232
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,650
responds to that conflict and it
escalates.

233
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,830
So if you have this thing where you
start throwing bricks through windows

234
00:10:49,831 --> 00:10:52,980
and light and cop cars on fire in
stopping people from talking and hitting

235
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:55,980
people that have a make bitcoin great
again,

236
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:59,250
hats and just see that girl got maced in
the face by a 60 year olds.

237
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,970
Eventually people show up with guns.
That's what happens.

238
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:06,060
And this is what happens when you keep
escalating the violence.

239
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,420
You become a them,
you become the other,

240
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:14,480
you become the enemy and you create this
polarizing atmosphere that's so intense

241
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:18,940
that no dialogue's kind of fix it now
because you're the enemy.

242
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:20,160
We,
you're talking about the north versus

243
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:20,970
the south.
You're,

244
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:22,410
you're talking about,
you know,

245
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,150
the,
the Protestants versus the Catholics,

246
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:24,541
you,
you,

247
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:29,541
you create this horrific environment
where almost it's almost impossible to

248
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,850
avoid violence.
Well,

249
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,340
so I'm done avoiding it.
I'm taking the low road.

250
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,410
I'm punching them in the face.
So that's what you're doing with this

251
00:11:37,411 --> 00:11:38,520
outfit?
Yes.

252
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,850
That is really what I'm doing with this
outfit.

253
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,900
I did a talk at Nyu.
They pepper sprayed me.

254
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,990
Did they re when was this?
This was a couple of weeks ago.

255
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,250
What did,
what was it talk about?

256
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,120
I didn't even have a plan.
They know me as pro trump or something

257
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:51,661
and they,
the,

258
00:11:51,661 --> 00:11:52,980
I'm a Nazi because of that.

259
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,900
They sh they don't want to give a
platform to free speech.

260
00:11:55,901 --> 00:12:00,520
That's the irony of all this is they
pretend that it's gotten so far.

261
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:05,521
It's beyond debate now in their world.
We are recruiting fascists for some sort

262
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:08,740
of imminent genocide.
So we're like signing up the brown

263
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:13,741
shirts with a form at our talks and you
go say that was possible.

264
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:16,270
Uh,
how does that work?

265
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,610
Like we sign you up,
then you're part of the club.

266
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:20,560
Then you come with us on the next
genocide.

267
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,050
The fuck are you talking about?
You haven't played it through in your

268
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:25,240
mind because for these people it's a
religion.

269
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:28,060
That's why they don't want to debate.
It's like a born again.

270
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:30,130
He doesn't want to debate about the
existence of God.

271
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:34,390
He's already on that side.
So what was your plan when you went

272
00:12:34,391 --> 00:12:35,051
there?
What did,

273
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:35,980
what did you want to talk?

274
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,840
I was going to say,
uh,

275
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,150
this Nazi that,
uh,

276
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:43,690
that you've made Milo and I out to be
who wants genocide and who,

277
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,320
uh,
sees nonwhites is inhuman,

278
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:46,691
blah,
blah,

279
00:12:46,691 --> 00:12:46,931
blah,
blah,

280
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,070
blah,
homophobic,

281
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:48,970
sexist,
whatever.

282
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:51,550
Uh,
first of all,

283
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,190
that guy should be allowed to talk if he
existed,

284
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,550
but he doesn't exist.
Your monster is a mythical beast and

285
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:03,010
you've gone to college,
you're 60 grand in debt already to fight

286
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:05,200
this mythical beast who doesn't fucking
exist?

287
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,250
Well,
in terms of Milo,

288
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:08,890
he definitely doesn't exist.
Milo is not a Nazi.

289
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,110
He's definitely,
he's not promoting genocide.

290
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:13,840
And those are two things that just get
trumpeted about left and right.

291
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,070
Exactly who is.
But Milo has said some very inflammatory

292
00:13:18,071 --> 00:13:23,071
things about and in a very generalizing
way about women and about the wage gap

293
00:13:24,191 --> 00:13:29,191
and about all sorts of things that he
designs his words and his phrases to be

294
00:13:30,191 --> 00:13:31,030
inflammatory.

295
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,540
So he gets the most response and it's
been incredibly profitable.

296
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,490
I mean up into Harper Collins pulled his
book deal.

297
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:40,870
He had a $250,000 book advance.
His book was number one on Amazon.

298
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,750
Just sheerly through controversy.
Yup.

299
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,990
I mean through presales and controversy.
So it's a strategy and a lot of ways and

300
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:54,061
it's also a response to this really hard
stance that the far left is taking this

301
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:58,870
anti anti free speech stance.
Right.

302
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,420
But always with these cases you go,
what exactly did he say?

303
00:14:01,421 --> 00:14:03,190
I always say this to people who bitch
about it and I told her,

304
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:06,430
I go,
what sentence in what book is factually

305
00:14:06,431 --> 00:14:07,870
incorrect?
What specifically are you saying?

306
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:12,940
And with this Milo thing,
he said that often sexual relationships

307
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:16,330
with 13 year olds can be beneficial for
gays.

308
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,460
Uh,
he has since retracted that and

309
00:14:18,461 --> 00:14:20,980
apologized,
but that's not enough.

310
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,560
And that's about as as egregious as it
gets.

311
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,390
The other stuff that he says we all say
in a joking way and then that becomes

312
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:32,170
pure evil and you advocate for this,
right?

313
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,460
So the left is willfully ignorant of
humor when it comes to Milo and with

314
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,590
trump too,
like the grab the pussy thing,

315
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,190
which they had a whole fucking parade
about and they still wear these dumb

316
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:45,750
wool hats to look like a pussy,
which is a joke you said on a bus,

317
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,010
you're wearing a dumb joke on your head.
Uh,

318
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,500
they,
they know that he doesn't want to have a

319
00:14:50,501 --> 00:14:52,730
new policy called the pussy grabbing
statute,

320
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,930
but they are willfully hiding their
sense of humor so they can take things

321
00:14:56,931 --> 00:14:59,830
literally and go off on a tirade of it.
Well,

322
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,870
I think they're shocked that we've been
fed our entire life po politicians that

323
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:11,720
speak in a statesmen Lee like way a very
predetermined,

324
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:16,040
planned out way where they have pauses
in their speech like Obama,

325
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:21,080
when he speaks,
he has some very non normal patterns to

326
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:21,914
his behavior.

327
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,611
Yeah.
Like those,

328
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:26,120
those things that people do.
The showmanship of being a president,

329
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,280
that it's all designed to comfort you
and have you think that this person is

330
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,380
clearly different than anyone.
You know,

331
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,540
they talk different,
they have better speaks president

332
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,880
beaches,
they have better speaks.

333
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:38,801
They,
they're,

334
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,190
they're,
they're statesmen like,

335
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:40,971
you know,
they,

336
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:43,000
they speak in these,
uh,

337
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,080
preplanned out sentences that are
articulate and,

338
00:15:46,081 --> 00:15:48,020
and,
and cleanly worded.

339
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,350
And that's not what you get with trump.
And that disturbs the shit out of

340
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:52,520
people.
It just serves it.

341
00:15:52,521 --> 00:15:54,410
Like,
I saw so many people going off the other

342
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:58,490
day about his talk about uranium and
Hillary Clinton's selling uranium.

343
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,910
You know,
how it's things and you,

344
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,170
it's for things very bad.
Things like he's running out of words.

345
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,720
She doesn't know what the words are.
You know,

346
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:09,260
that doesn't necessarily mean anything,
but people are pointing to it like it's

347
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:12,230
this horrible moment where this
president,

348
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,910
essentially all he did was run out of
words and just the fucking guys probably

349
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,730
working 16 hours a day,
that's probably exhausted.

350
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,580
I mean,
the overwhelming stress of the job for

351
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,790
any one of them is almost immediately
apparent once they get into office.

352
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,010
And you're seeing it with trump as well.
You're seeing like,

353
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,430
like that unhinged press conference that
he made guarantee you.

354
00:16:31,431 --> 00:16:34,610
Some of that has to do with the fact
that guy has worn the fuck out.

355
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,310
You know,
he's a 70 year old man,

356
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,710
like I'm almost 50 and I'm fucking tired
all the time.

357
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,320
How's this guy who's 20 years older than
me?

358
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:46,250
Can I deal with the stress of running
the biggest economy,

359
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:51,251
the biggest military,
the most insane country the world has

360
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:53,240
ever known.
Yeah,

361
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:55,250
I mean that's what the United States is.
Yeah.

362
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,170
They say Maggie Thatcher slept four
hours a night,

363
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,800
four hours a night repeatedly starts to
chip away at your psyche.

364
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,660
Oh yeah.
But the thing I would say about trump

365
00:17:02,661 --> 00:17:05,120
when they say he's not presidential is I
tried that,

366
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,800
I tried it with Romney.

367
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:09,060
You got mad at his binder comment.
I,

368
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,190
I tried it with cruise,
the constitutional superman and who

369
00:17:13,191 --> 00:17:16,820
could debate anyone and was area died
and and presidential.

370
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,601
And you went,
no,

371
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:18,740
he's ugly.
So I said,

372
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:20,480
okay,
I'm bringing in Rodney dangerfield from

373
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,090
caddyshack and he's just going to be a
wrecking ball.

374
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,910
And when Huffington Post says we're
putting trump in the entertainment

375
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,110
section,
said of the new section,

376
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,170
Romney and cruise wouldn't have said
anything.

377
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:32,090
Trump says,
ann coulter points this out in your

378
00:17:32,091 --> 00:17:32,901
book.
In trump,

379
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:34,680
we trust jump goes,
uh,

380
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,550
Arianna Huffington.
Didn't your husband leave you for a man?

381
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,230
Yeah,
I think he made the right choice.

382
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,120
I think it was a very good choice.
And I go that you,

383
00:17:42,121 --> 00:17:44,780
you brought this on yourself.
You made me have to get him.

384
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,450
Well,
what she's doing,

385
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,470
you know,
within culture is doing is very similar

386
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,490
to what Milo's doing.

387
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,210
You mean there,
there are merchants of outrage and

388
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:55,500
that's what they're doing.
I disagree.

389
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:57,660
I think they're speaking in a hyperbolic
tone.

390
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,120
They're flamboyant,
but that's what the charter was still

391
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,050
there.
Yes.

392
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:03,030
There's,
there's definitely some truth,

393
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,850
especially with Milo that some of the
things that he says,

394
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,710
um,
but all truth.

395
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:08,071
What,
what?

396
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:09,720
Like again,
I'm saying it right now.

397
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:11,370
What,
what did he say this factually

398
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:12,600
incorrect?
Well,

399
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:14,040
that wasn't a joke.
Not,

400
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:18,240
not factually incorrect,
but extremely offensive to people like

401
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:23,270
the 13 year old boy comment.
Like the thing about sort of normalizing

402
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:26,280
relationships between grown men and 13
year old boys.

403
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,151
Right.
You know,

404
00:18:27,151 --> 00:18:31,890
I think a big part of why he even says
that is because he's in many ways like a

405
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:36,891
natural contrarian and in many ways a
guy who wants to get a rise out of

406
00:18:37,351 --> 00:18:39,540
people.
And by saying that he didn't feel like

407
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,810
there's any consequences to being
outrageous in that regard.

408
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,440
But I think we could both agree whether
or not it's factual.

409
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:47,400
In his case

410
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:50,920
it's a fucked up thing to say right at
the fucked up thing to say it was

411
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,690
negligent,
which is why I apologize.

412
00:18:52,691 --> 00:18:57,160
But I think the grain of truth to that
and with his other statements is a lot

413
00:18:57,161 --> 00:18:59,680
more than a grain,
but the grain of truth to what he was

414
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:02,620
saying,
his gaze have less chastity than

415
00:19:02,621 --> 00:19:05,230
straights.
And if a woman is known as a slut,

416
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,590
she's less likely to be picked up.
And I've been sued for calling woman a

417
00:19:08,591 --> 00:19:09,610
slut.
Where are you really?

418
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,930
Yup.
Who Sued you?

419
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,270
It was a long time ago.
Back in vice days it was in do's and

420
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:14,560
don'ts.
And the,

421
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,620
the way the law is,
it's kind of antiquated,

422
00:19:17,621 --> 00:19:18,454
but it's like,
oh,

423
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:22,780
you called her a slut now she won't have
currency in the market of marriage.

424
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,190
Well,
because she's known as a whore,

425
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,550
so we're going to punish you punitively
for this sin.

426
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,440
Did you have to settle?
Yeah.

427
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,290
God dammit.
You can't even call someone a slut.

428
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,850
There's no word for a man.
No,

429
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,650
I cad.
That's a compliment.

430
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:39,600
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

431
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,080
A cat is hilarious.
Well,

432
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,750
the fact that there's no equivalent for
a man shows you that there's a different

433
00:19:43,751 --> 00:19:47,050
standard.
And then with gays it is different to

434
00:19:47,051 --> 00:19:50,380
like 13 year old and an older person,
right?

435
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:52,720
If it's a girl and a 40 year old
teacher,

436
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,840
I want to take him to the parking lot
and beat him till he's has a weird,

437
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,470
he walks weird for the rest of his life.
If it's a woman in a boy,

438
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,300
uh,
I don't want to murder her.

439
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,280
I'm grossed out 13,
especially 14 little better.

440
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,430
And then with gays,
uh,

441
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,130
well I'm not gonna make the same mistake
Milo made right now.

442
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,240
Don't ever do it.
But if a guy's known as a slut in the

443
00:20:16,241 --> 00:20:18,640
future,
like say a 19 year old fucks,

444
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:22,810
200 people as a woman,
no one wants to go near as a gay.

445
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:24,460
You've been around the block.

446
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,711
Yeah,
it's not,

447
00:20:25,711 --> 00:20:27,540
this is not the same consequences for
sure.

448
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,790
And I,
I had a bit of my act about,

449
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,770
I don't know if you remember this
commercial,

450
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,940
but there was a commercial adjust for
men commercial where there was a baby

451
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:40,080
that was driving a porsche,
a baby with a beard and there was a

452
00:20:40,081 --> 00:20:44,100
grown woman next to the baby and the
baby has like a Tuxedo on and it's like

453
00:20:44,101 --> 00:20:47,380
you've always wanted the biggest bed,
his beard and the baby goes to the

454
00:20:47,381 --> 00:20:49,190
nightclub and a bouncer looks at him a
winks.

455
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:49,991
And I'm like,
look at this,

456
00:20:49,991 --> 00:20:52,330
look at this commercial.
[inaudible] see the babies.

457
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,850
Yeah.
So the baby walks in just for men.

458
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,860
I mean,
I dunno what the fuck just for men,

459
00:20:56,861 --> 00:20:59,320
if you don't know it is some stuff that
guys put in their beard when they're

460
00:20:59,321 --> 00:21:01,390
getting old.
So this baby's got a bottle,

461
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,740
he goes out to the dance.

462
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,960
For this.
All these girls with these tiny little

463
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:09,961
skirts dancing around him and he's like,
he's like a pimp and he's with this hot

464
00:21:10,751 --> 00:21:12,160
woman.
And this to me,

465
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,160
my bit was this is proof,
positive proof,

466
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:17,260
positive.
There's no sexual equality when it comes

467
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:20,500
to child molesting.
Cause if you even wrote that down with

468
00:21:20,501 --> 00:21:22,750
the sexist reversed,
if you wrote it down,

469
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:25,060
you're fucking going to jail.
Okay.

470
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,050
There's a little baby girl and she goes
out to a room full of guys who are

471
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:32,800
wearing Tarzan skirts and they're all
swinging dicks around her and she's got

472
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:35,770
a bottle and they're all fighting for
her attention and kissing her on the

473
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:37,930
cheek.
You would go to fucking jail.

474
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,840
But that was a commercial that aired on
mainstream television.

475
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,330
No one cared about it.
That commercial aired for years.

476
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,320
It's probably still on now.
And that commercial is proof positive

477
00:21:47,321 --> 00:21:51,460
that we have a completely different
attitude towards a grown woman who's hot

478
00:21:51,461 --> 00:21:53,770
as fuck and a little baby.

479
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:56,050
Yeah,
well even I was watching big with the

480
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,180
kids the other day.
Tom Hanks is what?

481
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,480
Eight in that movie?
Nine and then that woman's seduces him

482
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:04,630
and I guess he fucks her.
He gets a boner and I'm like,

483
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,850
you're raping a child.
Exactly.

484
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,680
Why are we watching?
And she's hot.

485
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,890
She's hot and he looks like a man.
So I'll just let it ride.

486
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,930
If that movie was reversed and it was a
young girl that all of a sudden was in a

487
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,690
sexual woman's body and the guy was
fucking her,

488
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:20,530
she's like,
I don't know.

489
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,960
Are we supposed to be doing this?
You would be horrified.

490
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,170
You would be absolutely horrified.
I've been arguing about cause of the

491
00:22:26,171 --> 00:22:29,860
Milo thing when arguing about all this a
lot and I've been getting from gays and

492
00:22:29,861 --> 00:22:32,590
guides with kids that are young.
Uh,

493
00:22:32,591 --> 00:22:34,600
this whole thing about how they,
they keep saying,

494
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,040
come on,
don't lie.

495
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,980
You would definitely want to fuck a 13
year old girl if she was hot.

496
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,110
And I go,
I don't know where this became a normal

497
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,400
sentence.
I fucked 17 year olds when I was 17 it

498
00:22:45,401 --> 00:22:47,650
was the worst sex.
I remember that.

499
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,760
And you'd be on top of her and is out.
You didn't even know when it was in.

500
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,050
Nobody do what was going on.
Yeah.

501
00:22:53,051 --> 00:22:54,490
It's not like they go,
yeah,

502
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:55,660
fuck it.
Aw.

503
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:01,920
They didn't like it until they were like
26 I want pendulous breasts.

504
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,870
I want a divorce.
Say with a neck pendulous,

505
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:07,330
like worn out just for pencils.
Hey,

506
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:09,540
hanging.
Hanging low for I want,

507
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:13,570
I want to look like Cox when she's on
all and I want to see them.

508
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,500
Actually I don't want to see them swing
cause I'll come if I look at this.

509
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,880
Oh come on.
I'm not talking about like a orange in a

510
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:22,450
sock.

511
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:24,370
Oh,
I mean like it's got meat there,

512
00:23:24,371 --> 00:23:26,890
but they droop you like when you're
fucking her from behind.

513
00:23:26,891 --> 00:23:29,020
They go and they've experienced life
circles.

514
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,370
Yes.
They've experienced.

515
00:23:30,371 --> 00:23:31,810
When I want to play tennis with a
toddler.

516
00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:34,180
You want to play tennis with somebody
who can return a serve.

517
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,920
Yes.
Good point.

518
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,780
Yeah.
I don't know.

519
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,460
Get that.
Yay.

520
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,710
Come on.
You never been attracted to a 15 year

521
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,630
old girl like I don't,
I really don't get that.

522
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,930
But I know I was molested by a woman
when I was 13 years old.

523
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,120
Oh Shit.
When I was 13 years old,

524
00:23:50,121 --> 00:23:54,230
there was a woman that we used to play
softball with on our block and

525
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,740
apparently she did it to a lot of boys
and she took me up to her room.

526
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,850
She played me some really good music.
She introduced me to a lot of led

527
00:24:01,851 --> 00:24:02,570
Zeppelin.

528
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,190
She introduced me to comfortably numb
floyd this day.

529
00:24:07,191 --> 00:24:09,080
When I think about that song,
I think about making out with her,

530
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,560
but she was 21 and I was 13 she just
kissed you?

531
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,450
No,
she grabbed my dick but I was just so

532
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,460
little fuck I was doing now.
No,

533
00:24:16,461 --> 00:24:19,280
I was so confused.
I was 13.

534
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,590
I was like a little boy,
you know,

535
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,330
if she had caught me like a year or two
later,

536
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:28,010
I probably would have fucked her.
But that at that stage I was baffled

537
00:24:28,011 --> 00:24:31,070
because I had like zero sexual
experience.

538
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,210
And then all of a sudden a woman,
a 21 year old woman with tetes of smoked

539
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:39,110
cigarettes and she was making out with
me and taking me up to a room is really

540
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,880
weird.
And she had a boyfriend and her

541
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:43,340
boyfriend was a construction worker and
he was a man.

542
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,280
I remember seeing him like on the job,
he has his shirt off and had a hairy

543
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:46,640
chest.

544
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,810
I was like,
what in the fuck?

545
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,920
And that was her boyfriend,
but she was just a wild woman.

546
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,760
And she uh,
apparently like taking young boys that

547
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:58,430
didn't know what they're doing and
taking them up to her room.

548
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,400
You know,
this is why we have judges cause there's

549
00:25:01,401 --> 00:25:03,020
different cultures,
different genders,

550
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:06,230
different circumstances.
Every time I talked to a black guy about

551
00:25:06,231 --> 00:25:08,750
their first sexual experiences,
my hair is whitened.

552
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,550
Why?
It's always like,

553
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:12,800
yeah,
I just fucked my cousin when I was 12

554
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:17,300
like Chris cotton was talking about
fucking his cousin was Chris Cotton,

555
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,820
comedian guy,
dark as a piece of coal,

556
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:23,540
uh,
fucked his cousin's Shirad small fucked

557
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:27,410
his babysitter when he was like 11 or 12
stories before.

558
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,410
I've heard the babysitter story before
where it's like,

559
00:25:30,411 --> 00:25:33,950
you know,
you're 13 she's 18 and next thing you

560
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,020
know you're making out with her and
Ollie,

561
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:39,710
she's horrible,
but should she go to jail for 15 years?

562
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,520
Well,
that's a big,

563
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,560
there's a big difference between an
eight year old,

564
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:47,450
18 year old boy rather,
and an 18 year old girl and a 13 year

565
00:25:47,451 --> 00:25:51,020
old girl and a 13 year old boy.
There's a just a big goddamn difference

566
00:25:51,021 --> 00:25:53,810
if you're a grown woman and a 13 year
old boy.

567
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:55,160
Like,
here's the thing,

568
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,410
here's the big one,
and this is like,

569
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,270
this is,
this was one of the things that came up

570
00:25:59,271 --> 00:26:02,060
in the Milo,
a conversation to where he was saying

571
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:05,720
that it's not that big a deal if a man
grabs a woman's tit and she doesn't want

572
00:26:05,721 --> 00:26:06,291
them to.
I'm like,

573
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:07,340
well,
that's sexual assault.

574
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,760
If a woman grabs my dick and I don't
want her to,

575
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,880
that might be sexual assault,
but I'm not in danger.

576
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,160
You know what I'm saying?
It's like she's not going to fuck me up.

577
00:26:16,161 --> 00:26:17,060
She's not going to rape me.

578
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,310
And that's where it gets different.
Like I'm not scared.

579
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,730
Like if a woman came over and grabbed my
ass like that,

580
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,880
you probably shouldn't do that,
but I'm not scared of you.

581
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,571
You know?
So,

582
00:26:26,571 --> 00:26:29,150
um,
but if a man does that to a woman and

583
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,070
he's willing to violate our space like
that,

584
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:34,850
a woman has a real fear,
there is a possibility what the,

585
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,790
the door might be open it,
this guy could rape her.

586
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,220
Right.
And this all comes down to the myth of

587
00:26:40,221 --> 00:26:43,190
equality.
And this is why the right is more,

588
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,020
has a more benevolent society than the
left.

589
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,580
The,
and I've noticed this with girls.

590
00:26:47,581 --> 00:26:50,700
I've always said you can hit a woman if
she hits you 12 times,

591
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,160
that includes punches in the face.
So you just sit there going,

592
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:53,760
one,
two,

593
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,740
three,
12 and then 11 12th and then one I can't

594
00:26:58,741 --> 00:26:59,190
even hit one.

595
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,380
If they hit me 12 I'd have to arm drag
her,

596
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,910
take her back.
Choker,

597
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,640
you could choke.
A crazy woman is trying to kill you,

598
00:27:05,641 --> 00:27:10,080
but you can't punch 12 I would only do
it if I thought they were hurting

599
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:11,470
someone in my family.
Well,

600
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,380
when I talked to a feminist and liberals
about this,

601
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:15,780
they go 12 one and I go,
what?

602
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,230
Why?
It's,

603
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,670
you know,
we're stronger than you,

604
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:18,870
right?
They don't want to admit that.

605
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,200
They don't to admit that.
And it's the same with gays and it's the

606
00:27:21,201 --> 00:27:24,930
same like I was writing about.
You remember that documentary dog fight

607
00:27:24,931 --> 00:27:29,620
dwg and I'm looking at that.
That was Kimbo slice is in that and I'm,

608
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:33,540
I'm done on two dot.
A 5,000 a 5,000 and a I'm looking at it

609
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:36,000
going,
you guys were murdering each other on

610
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:38,160
the streets.
You figured out a way to solve it with

611
00:27:38,161 --> 00:27:39,570
fights,
backyard fighting.

612
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,530
You shouldn't have the same enforcement
as rich white kids doing it in the

613
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:47,730
suburbs.
Or at least that's what your instincts

614
00:27:47,731 --> 00:27:49,440
are when you see that.
Now that doesn't make sense.

615
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:52,020
The laws should be equitable across the
board,

616
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,850
but you go,
this is a different situation.

617
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:56,130
They're in a shitty situation.
They're murdering each other,

618
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:58,770
these backyard fights.
Sure someone loses an eye,

619
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:00,150
but they're not murdering each other
anymore.

620
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:02,040
It's an improvement.
And you go,

621
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,920
I don't know how to enforce this.
I don't know how it's done,

622
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,600
but you feel like there should be
different,

623
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,910
lots of different people.
And when you say we're all exactly the

624
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:10,560
same,
well the next thing you know,

625
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:15,561
women are getting punched one on one and
they're not as strong as men.

626
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:17,880
So they're getting fucking beating them.
Or you're telling women they're

627
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:20,070
invincible,
they're going out and getting shit faced

628
00:28:20,071 --> 00:28:21,240
like you and I do.

629
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,380
And you go,
no,

630
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,730
you,
you're a Lamborghini.

631
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,450
You can't get wasted.
Your delicate,

632
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,350
I'm a fucking cheap old,
57 Chevy beat me up.

633
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,423
Right,
right,

634
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,810
right.
Well,

635
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,550
there's,
there's a narrative,

636
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,230
um,
whether or not people are aware of it,

637
00:28:37,231 --> 00:28:42,210
but there is something that is actually
being thrown around as being a viable

638
00:28:42,211 --> 00:28:45,780
narrative.
And that is that there's no biological

639
00:28:45,781 --> 00:28:50,781
difference between men and women.
There's no biological difference between

640
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:54,030
the sexes and it,
when you see people say it,

641
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,350
it's,
I saw it,

642
00:28:55,351 --> 00:28:57,420
there was a debate that Jordan Peterson
had.

643
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,060
Uh,
and one of the PR,

644
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:03,420
the people that he was debating was a
professor from the University of Toronto

645
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,550
and it was a gender equality professor
or something along that,

646
00:29:08,551 --> 00:29:13,551
some bizarre discipline.
And I think it was a transgender man.

647
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,280
Like she was born a woman and then she's
a man or maybe,

648
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:17,801
yeah,
I,

649
00:29:17,801 --> 00:29:18,780
I'm,
I'm pretty sure it's,

650
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:21,120
I'm not sure,
but it seems like it anyway,

651
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,830
it's a very feminine man.

652
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,650
Whatever it is.
And it seems like a woman that became a

653
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:27,930
man and it,
she,

654
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:30,650
he,
whichever how Z,

655
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:31,850
Z,
Z,

656
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:33,250
z.
Um,

657
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:37,320
and literally arguing,
knowing that this is going to be

658
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:39,270
broadcast,
knowing this is going to be on

659
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:40,350
television,
on the Internet,

660
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,500
saying that there's no difference.
There's no biological basis.

661
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,100
And like,
that's insane.

662
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:51,280
There's,
there's no difference between men and

663
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:53,500
women.
It is absolutely insane.

664
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,310
It's absolutely insane.
There are no women who come anywhere

665
00:29:57,311 --> 00:30:01,990
near what men power lifters can do.
They don't come anywhere near,

666
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:04,490
they might be stronger than you or I,
they might.

667
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,390
They might cause they're doing it for a
long time and had taken steroids,

668
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:11,230
but even the women who take steroids,
there are no where near as strong as the

669
00:30:11,231 --> 00:30:12,490
men.
It's not even close.

670
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:15,730
There's no women who are in the NFL.
There's no women heavyweight boxing

671
00:30:15,731 --> 00:30:16,564
champions.

672
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,160
They're never going to beat the men.
There's,

673
00:30:18,161 --> 00:30:21,100
there's an absolutely a biological basis
and sex.

674
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:26,260
I have trained extensively with women in
martial arts extensively.

675
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,130
There is an enormous difference and how
hard they hit.

676
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,440
There's an enormous difference in how
strong they are.

677
00:30:32,441 --> 00:30:35,290
I feel like I could beat them up.
There's a lot of would fuck you up.

678
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,180
I'm just like,
I couldn't beat Ronda Rousey,

679
00:30:37,181 --> 00:30:39,070
but I feel like I could beat up the
base.

680
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,290
No,
a lot of feathers weighs,

681
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,990
most of them would fuck you up,
but it's just a technique thing.

682
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,440
You know,
if if you had trained as long as them,

683
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,620
they would be in trouble.
It's just there's a lot of factors

684
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,440
didn't.
Yes.

685
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,010
Well,
I got in Shit for saying it because

686
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,120
there was a man who transitioned to a
woman after 30 years of being a woman

687
00:30:58,121 --> 00:31:00,460
after fathering a child,
being in the military,

688
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:02,560
the whole deal,
go on living life as a man,

689
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:07,210
became a woman for two years and then
started having mma fights with women and

690
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:11,270
not telling them that he was a woman for
30 years.

691
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,980
She was a woman for 30 years and then
became a one.

692
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,620
I'm like,
that's fucking crazy.

693
00:31:14,950 --> 00:31:16,690
And that the structure of the body's
different,

694
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:19,630
the hips are different.
The jaws different than the size of the

695
00:31:19,631 --> 00:31:23,050
hands is different.
The size of the fist is an enormous

696
00:31:23,051 --> 00:31:25,600
difference between the hour that a man
can generate.

697
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:28,570
When I see that trainee pounding the
living shit out of a woman,

698
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,340
it's like domestic violence.
Disturbing.

699
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:30,691
Yeah.
I,

700
00:31:30,691 --> 00:31:32,080
I've,
I see it on the TV and I go,

701
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:33,370
there you go,
liberals.

702
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:35,590
There's your utopia.
What do you think?

703
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,990
And that's the problem with their
utopia.

704
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,680
It keeps making things worse and worse
and worse for them.

705
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:45,070
Yes.
Like even abortion and immigration in

706
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:45,821
Canada,
now they're,

707
00:31:45,821 --> 00:31:50,620
they're pouring all these Indians in
like pancake batter and a Indians prefer

708
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:55,360
to have boys than girls and they're
starting to have gender based abortions

709
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,790
where they go,
I don't want to have a boy.

710
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,430
I mean I go to hanging out around here.
I'm good.

711
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,220
Let's keep aborting till we get a boy.
And you go,

712
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,570
Hey Lena,
is that real?

713
00:32:04,571 --> 00:32:05,920
Yeah,
he liberals,

714
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:07,930
it's,
it's mostly the immigrants,

715
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:11,140
but you know,
it's the beginning of ethnic genocide

716
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,280
and you go,
hey feminists,

717
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:14,530
you're pro choice shit is getting you
fucking killed.

718
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,431
What?
That wasn't,

719
00:32:15,431 --> 00:32:16,930
they're going to become the next
retards.

720
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,270
That wasn't the,
you know,

721
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,280
the reason why they wanted it in the
first place.

722
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:23,770
They just wanted the right to choose.
They want someone to tell them,

723
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,810
and particularly in the most extreme
cases,

724
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:28,840
like if a woman's raped,
like if a woman's raped and she gets

725
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:30,940
pregnant,
she should not have to keep that baby.

726
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:34,780
They're taking right exceptions.
But that is the freaking second that I'm

727
00:32:34,781 --> 00:32:37,330
sick of freak exceptions.
Defining policies.

728
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,920
Okay,
but would you be,

729
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,540
would you be fine with those freak
exceptions being law?

730
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,621
Like if you're,
you,

731
00:32:45,621 --> 00:32:47,060
you're a pro life person,
right?

732
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,170
That's your stance.
Sure.

733
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,310
Okay.
Um,

734
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,890
would you be pro choice of a woman was
raped?

735
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,480
I'm not doing that anymore.
No.

736
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:55,700
No.
What do you mean I'm not playing that

737
00:32:55,701 --> 00:32:56,570
game anymore?
Okay.

738
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,490
Well I'm not trying to play it in what
they do.

739
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,301
I know,
I know.

740
00:32:59,301 --> 00:33:01,430
Other side of that is that your
daughter,

741
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,650
they always,
inevitably,

742
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:06,170
especially with journalists,
I'll be talking about sexism,

743
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:06,441
blah,
blah,

744
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:06,981
blah.
And they'll go,

745
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:09,050
what if your daughter was blah,
blah,

746
00:33:09,051 --> 00:33:09,884
blah?
And I go,

747
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,140
you're trying to make me irrational.
Okay,

748
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:15,830
but I'm not accusing you of this.
But it's like these liberals have these

749
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:19,520
tricks where like what if a girl was
raped by her father and she got pregnant

750
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,490
and I looked it up.
I could only find one case,

751
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,480
one case in America of a father
impregnating a daughter.

752
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:30,420
And I thought this freak occurrence
keeps defining the whole debate.

753
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:34,820
We've got kermit Gosnell killing 40,000
babies that were in their third

754
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:38,500
trimester yet.
This one man is who's a,

755
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:39,620
he was the guy,
he's,

756
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,430
he's a,
he was arrested for performing a late

757
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:47,530
term abortion from abortions and they
discovered that it was a,

758
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:50,780
sorry 40,000 is my personal estimate of
the whole country,

759
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,850
but I think he did hundreds and
hundreds.

760
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,830
Now I understand what you're saying that
you don't want to get roped into any

761
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,700
crazy sort of hypothetical scenario
where you say,

762
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:04,790
what if it was your daughter and she was
raped by some convict to just got to

763
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,050
that.
You know what I'm saying?

764
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,730
Yeah.
I know you don't want to get into that,

765
00:34:07,731 --> 00:34:11,150
but in,
in certain circumstances,

766
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,920
I really think there's a,
there's,

767
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:13,754
there is,
uh,

768
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:18,470
a difference between someone who's
pregnant for three weeks and someone was

769
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,940
pregnant for five months.

770
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,830
There's a big difference.
Yeah.

771
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,990
Like with the ocean,
I just want to get it,

772
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,630
get it away from 17 weeks.
Like I want to get it down.

773
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:33,410
I want to get the whole argument down to
eight weeks,

774
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,670
eight weeks.
My goal.

775
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,680
Okay.
So my,

776
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,660
I have friends in New York City where
everyone has to think outside the box

777
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:39,890
and they're all like,
yeah,

778
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:42,980
it's murder and I'm for it.
Like Jim Goad says that all the time.

779
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,640
Anthony Kumina says that it's murder and
I think it's awesome.

780
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,950
Well,
that's because he doesn't want to be

781
00:34:48,951 --> 00:34:52,010
responsible and he,
he fucks a lot of crazy girls.

782
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,280
That's really the problem.
I mean,

783
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:59,060
I've been to super fortunate that the,
the person that I had babies with,

784
00:34:59,061 --> 00:35:00,890
I love.
Yeah.

785
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,140
I mean,
[inaudible] uh,

786
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,190
is got to take a lot of blame for this
shit he got in recently.

787
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,180
We all told him to get the fuck away
from her and he kept walking back into

788
00:35:11,181 --> 00:35:16,181
the client's fun and I would see him
with her and it was like a fucking rape

789
00:35:16,461 --> 00:35:17,660
victim being with their rapists.

790
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,740
Like I go,
oh,

791
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,430
what is that doing here?
And she left thigh high stockings.

792
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,700
Ooh.
Time to fuck.

793
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,890
I can get you a five year old.
No,

794
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,381
no,
no,

795
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:28,741
no,
no,

796
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:29,091
no,
no,

797
00:35:29,091 --> 00:35:29,451
no,
no,

798
00:35:29,451 --> 00:35:30,560
not fun.
He,

799
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,270
I have a friend,
my friend Tony,

800
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:34,250
Tony's Zara from Columbus,
Ohio.

801
00:35:34,251 --> 00:35:35,084
Good Buddy.
Of Mine,

802
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,560
who's a great guy,
but he's,

803
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:38,850
he's also a wise man.
And uh,

804
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,800
he has had this theory about psychotic
and erotic until almost the,

805
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,530
to basically almost that's true,
interchangeable,

806
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:48,720
that they sort of rotate on each of this
access.

807
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:53,730
And that when you get,
like we've all had gals from the past,

808
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:54,930
there were just like,
Whoa,

809
00:35:54,931 --> 00:35:56,310
you know,
you'll leave their apartment and go,

810
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:59,190
Holy Shit,
I gotta take a shower.

811
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:01,110
I got to cool down jasmine.
Yeah.

812
00:36:01,111 --> 00:36:03,180
And then they start calling you later,
like,

813
00:36:03,181 --> 00:36:04,830
come over and fuck my mouth.
Like what?

814
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,920
Jesus Christ,
like the crazy ones,

815
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:12,340
the ones who want you to take a teaspoon
and scoop the come off their face so

816
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:15,600
they can get,
and this is only going to happen once in

817
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:16,930
my entire life,
but here we go.

818
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,480
And those girls exist and some of them
are really fun.

819
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:24,900
And when you're a guy and you're used to
girls that are like,

820
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:25,860
no,
don't come in my mouth.

821
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,100
No,
don't touch me there.

822
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:27,900
No,
I'm not going to.

823
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,470
You know there's like some,
so many people are so reserved and so

824
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:36,471
restricted and so,
so confined and then you date some crazy

825
00:36:36,601 --> 00:36:39,630
girl and she's just wild.
She's like put it in my ass.

826
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,500
You're like,
Whoa,

827
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,890
where are we going with anthony?
She was that and then some and already

828
00:36:46,591 --> 00:36:51,060
was like framing little kids who were at
the house.

829
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:54,450
I think she got one of them got marker
on them and or she,

830
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,700
she put sparkles in his hair or
something and the mother goes,

831
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:58,800
what the hell is going on with your hair
you've got that's going to take forever

832
00:36:58,801 --> 00:36:59,430
to get out.

833
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,070
And she goes,
it was her and blamed some 10 year old,

834
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,160
no evils dark shit she had done.
But that being said,

835
00:37:07,290 --> 00:37:09,500
so that's going too far.
But I do agree wholeheartedly.

836
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,510
And when my friends tell me they dumped
some bitch cause she's crazy,

837
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,900
I get mad at them because I go,
you crazy.

838
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,670
Pitches are the best sex you'll ever
have in your life.

839
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:21,540
If she's not calling the cops then he
fucking her.

840
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,490
But that's what you're hypocritical
then.

841
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,160
Cause that's anthony.
That's the gun.

842
00:37:25,161 --> 00:37:27,440
It's the balance gets to the point where
they call the cops.

843
00:37:27,441 --> 00:37:31,350
Sex should be right before that.
You should see the judge in the room

844
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:34,150
floating above your head with the gavel
like,

845
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,460
uh,
see,

846
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:42,060
nobody wants to say that.
And there is a reality.

847
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,460
And here's another reality.
It's super uncomfortable reality.

848
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,640
And this is,
I want to just get real clear about

849
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:47,850
this.

850
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:52,850
This is in no way condoning any form of
rape or any form of sexual assault or

851
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:59,430
any form of doing anything to anyone,
male or female against their will.

852
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:04,670
That said,
there are women who undeniably have rape

853
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,300
fantasies.
Yes.

854
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,990
So what's that?
Margaret Atwood talks about that and she

855
00:38:09,991 --> 00:38:11,250
says,
yes,

856
00:38:11,251 --> 00:38:14,160
but in our rape fantasies,
it's not a guy with a ski mask who jumps

857
00:38:14,161 --> 00:38:19,080
out of a Bush fat and ugly.
It's Mr clean and he's cleaning our

858
00:38:19,081 --> 00:38:20,460
house and then he says,
Hey,

859
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:21,840
I want to make love to you and you're
going,

860
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,120
no,
no level of law.

861
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:25,410
But that's her though.
Some,

862
00:38:25,411 --> 00:38:28,020
some women,
it's a guy comes in with a gun and makes

863
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:29,790
her suck his dick.
There's,

864
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,770
I've,
I've had a friend who that was her

865
00:38:31,771 --> 00:38:32,604
thing.
We've all,

866
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,590
everyone Louis C k does a bit about
that.

867
00:38:34,591 --> 00:38:36,100
We've all had women where they're like,
no,

868
00:38:36,101 --> 00:38:36,934
no,
no.

869
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,190
And then you stop and they go,
you find it the next day.

870
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:39,431
No,
no.

871
00:38:39,431 --> 00:38:41,040
You were supposed to.
Oh yeah.

872
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,500
Louie had the thing like,
I'm not going to take a chance

873
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,090
to find out if it's your thing.
I got an email,

874
00:38:49,091 --> 00:38:51,340
I can talk about this all the time,
but I got an email from a girl that said

875
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:53,170
thank you for raping me last night.
Oh,

876
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,290
but that might be that like right up to
the girls.

877
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,020
And I always say like that and they
might be joking around.

878
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,040
Oh yes,
of course she was.

879
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,530
But that was her way of saying you got
right to the line.

880
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,300
But I noticed this when I moved to New
York too.

881
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,480
I was,
went to college in the 90s when it was

882
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:09,910
about permission and feminism.
So I tried that.

883
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,601
I was like,
do you,

884
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:12,370
is this okay?
Is this feminist?

885
00:39:12,371 --> 00:39:13,360
And let's be clear about that.

886
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,860
You are a feminist at one point your
life,

887
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:16,870
would you define yourself as a feminist?
I still would.

888
00:39:16,871 --> 00:39:19,840
In many ways.
I see them as magical centi and beings.

889
00:39:19,841 --> 00:39:22,030
They're wizards.
They can make a fucking person come out

890
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:26,200
of their current
and to say they're dudes is,

891
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,870
is to trivialize.
It's like saying to Clark Kent,

892
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:32,570
just be a journalist.
Just focus on your journalism and Clark

893
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,780
Kent's a shitty journalist.
You're a shitty man.

894
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:37,180
Does he have one store that he came in
his story I've ever,

895
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,220
he's turned time backwards.
Oh,

896
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:40,840
that's right.
But he's never broken a story,

897
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:41,830
but we keep telling women,
no,

898
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:42,071
no,
no.

899
00:39:42,071 --> 00:39:45,490
Come to our meetings.
Come to where a tough mudder relay and

900
00:39:45,491 --> 00:39:47,650
walk through electrical wires and go
underneath.

901
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:49,930
So good at that.
By the way,

902
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:53,410
you tough mudder people that fucking
water you would never drink.

903
00:39:53,411 --> 00:39:54,910
You would never drink puddle water.

904
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,170
Right?
Right.

905
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,250
Yeah,
of course you wouldn't.

906
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,941
Well,
guess what?

907
00:39:57,941 --> 00:40:01,180
Fuck face you getting that water in your
mouth when you're crawling around.

908
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:03,610
That same shit that you would get in
your intestinal tract.

909
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,430
You're going to get in your mouth and
you're going to get sick as fuck.

910
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:09,100
Okay.
So big God damned careful when you're

911
00:40:09,101 --> 00:40:11,230
doing those things.
It seems like a weird beef to have.

912
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,670
Well,
tough mudder or people to the puddles

913
00:40:15,671 --> 00:40:18,640
are way too.
You gotta be really careful about

914
00:40:18,641 --> 00:40:20,920
drinking puddle water.
Like I know guys who have gotten

915
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:22,900
Giardia,
they've gotten like some serious

916
00:40:22,901 --> 00:40:25,030
intestinal disorders from drinking
water.

917
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:25,451
Yeah,
well,

918
00:40:25,451 --> 00:40:28,180
you're out in the mountains.
You go out in the mountains and like

919
00:40:28,181 --> 00:40:29,940
they don't bring water with them or
their,

920
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,380
they,
the water filter breaks or they put

921
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:34,990
these a iodine tablets of the water,
but they don't wait long enough.

922
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:38,470
Then they drink it and you're getting
these live bacteria in your body and

923
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:40,630
they wreck havoc with your system.
I mean,

924
00:40:40,631 --> 00:40:42,640
put you out for months.
Okay.

925
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:43,990
Okay.
I won't drink puddle water,

926
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,640
please.
So anyway,

927
00:40:45,641 --> 00:40:47,050
you're fucking chicks.
And,

928
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:49,150
uh,
through trial and error,

929
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:53,650
there's that time that you're on 24,
and you're fucking girl from behind and

930
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,221
you go,
yeah,

931
00:40:54,221 --> 00:40:57,240
you like that and you go,
I'm going to try a dad thing just,

932
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,300
and then you go,
who's your?

933
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,100
Yeah,
you'd like that daddy's fuck.

934
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:05,130
And then all of a sudden,
pussy juice galore and she's coming and

935
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:06,251
you go,
oh,

936
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:08,810
okay,
I'm going to keep mining this vein.

937
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,530
I'm your father,
blah,

938
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:11,891
blah,
blah.

939
00:41:11,891 --> 00:41:14,890
You start saying shit like that.
And then you start and then you come to

940
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:17,140
New York and Jewish girls in New York,
they're like,

941
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:18,610
choke me.
Kill me.

942
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,960
I'm a fucking whore.

943
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,840
Slap me.
And you're like,

944
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,510
um,
like that,

945
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:25,211
uh,
no harder.

946
00:41:25,211 --> 00:41:28,120
You fucking pussy.
See those,

947
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,850
those,
those girls never made their way to me.

948
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,020
Oh really?
Yeah.

949
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,860
You fucked girls in New York?
No.

950
00:41:33,861 --> 00:41:34,521
Well,
I did,

951
00:41:34,521 --> 00:41:38,060
but I think I,
I don't know,

952
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:40,070
maybe.
I don't know,

953
00:41:40,071 --> 00:41:42,230
man.
Maybe I just shied away from them or

954
00:41:42,231 --> 00:41:44,690
something like that.
I had some domestic violence in my house

955
00:41:44,691 --> 00:41:46,520
when I was growing up.
Old Shit like that.

956
00:41:46,521 --> 00:41:47,031
I was like,
well,

957
00:41:47,031 --> 00:41:49,190
that's kind of what I'm saying.
We don't naturally go.

958
00:41:49,191 --> 00:41:52,600
There were sweeties I had one girl that
liked to get choked though it,

959
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,830
but it always weirded me out.
We don't,

960
00:41:54,831 --> 00:41:57,470
we're not that enthusiastic about it,
but if they want us to dress like

961
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,610
clowns,
I would put it on the little nose.

962
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,453
Yeah,
it is.

963
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,620
You get into it after a while you
realize it's awesome,

964
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,900
but don't want to get choked by someone
who knows how to choke you though.

965
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,670
You want to get choked by someone
ineffective,

966
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,970
like a sloppy choke where you could
still breathe.

967
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,830
Well,
I remember it was fucking this Jewish

968
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:14,480
girl and she was,
she said,

969
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,710
kill me.
Whoa cheese.

970
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,900
And uh,
obviously I didn't do that.

971
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,240
And then she's like,
I'm your fucking whore at some coming on

972
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:20,571
her.
She's like,

973
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:23,420
I'm your dirty whore.
And then she's having a cigarette after

974
00:42:23,421 --> 00:42:24,850
and she goes,
I brought your whore.

975
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,770
By the way.
I was like,

976
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,190
Duh.
And I thought the Liberals now are

977
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:35,090
ruining that whole role playing fun game
that we all play.

978
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:37,220
And sex is a nebulous,
it's like religion,

979
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,390
it's personal,
it's private.

980
00:42:38,391 --> 00:42:40,970
It's a weird area where you do weird
things.

981
00:42:40,971 --> 00:42:45,020
You say stupid shit.
Like I want to lick your cock because

982
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,030
you're thinking,
I want you to suck my cock and want to

983
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,470
lick your pussy,
but you're so horny.

984
00:42:48,471 --> 00:42:49,281
You're brain goes,
yeah,

985
00:42:49,281 --> 00:42:53,450
I want to lick your balls when you look
my balls.

986
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:55,603
Sorry.

987
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:59,150
Yeah.
Dirty talk is so awkward.

988
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:02,750
I can't do fucking stupid.
I just can do like so good.

989
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,730
Love it.
Heaven.

990
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Yeah,
but it's also like when you're intimate

991
00:43:12,921 --> 00:43:14,540
with someone,
it's like you're,

992
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,630
you're sharing that extremely vulnerable
moment.

993
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,230
I mean,
it's,

994
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,790
look,
it's vulnerable nature because you don't

995
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:21,020
have your clothes on,
you know,

996
00:43:21,021 --> 00:43:22,070
and just,
you feel weird.

997
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,780
You know,
we always have our clothes on so we

998
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:25,460
don't have our clothes on.
It's just odd,

999
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,620
you know?
And then like funny nude.

1000
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah.
You're funny.

1001
00:43:29,001 --> 00:43:32,210
You look funny and you're aroused and it
feels good and you're,

1002
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,930
you want the other person to feel good.
You feel good to each other and it's

1003
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:37,640
just,
you're looking at each other's eyes and

1004
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:38,960
you're like that close.
It's like,

1005
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,100
it's very strange and there's other,
there's also the issue that people

1006
00:43:43,101 --> 00:43:46,670
become very addicted to each other.
I think human beings,

1007
00:43:46,671 --> 00:43:48,080
especially when having sex with each
other,

1008
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,850
it's just like a drug addiction.

1009
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:52,910
I mean,
I remember the first time is in a lot of

1010
00:43:52,911 --> 00:43:55,490
ways I think it is.
I think there's a lot of,

1011
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,300
there's a lot of endorphins that are
being exchanged and there's a lot of

1012
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:03,200
arousal chemicals that are excluded when
you're with that person that are

1013
00:44:03,201 --> 00:44:06,590
extremely potent and when the person's
not there,

1014
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:09,530
there's this deep need to get to that
person.

1015
00:44:09,531 --> 00:44:11,210
Again,
just like a drug,

1016
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,163
just like,
uh,

1017
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:14,300
you know,
someone who's got hooked on pain pills

1018
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:15,890
and you just,
you have to get the pills.

1019
00:44:15,891 --> 00:44:17,660
He got to get the pills.
And I remember,

1020
00:44:17,661 --> 00:44:18,740
um,
when I was in,

1021
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,410
when I was like 18,
my girlfriend broke up with me and I had

1022
00:44:21,411 --> 00:44:24,530
just graduated from high school and I
was really lost and confused.

1023
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,320
And when she broke up with me,
I was devastated.

1024
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:29,480
I couldn't believe I had to be without
her.

1025
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:33,090
And it was very much like withdrawal
from a drug.

1026
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:37,050
It was like probably the worst breakup
for me ever because it was the first

1027
00:44:37,051 --> 00:44:37,711
one,
you know?

1028
00:44:37,711 --> 00:44:39,090
And I was like,
I can't believe this.

1029
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:42,420
Like this is crazy.
And then I just was amazed at like how

1030
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,450
potent it was on my system,
you know,

1031
00:44:45,451 --> 00:44:47,940
and how it would fuck with my psyche and
my mind.

1032
00:44:47,941 --> 00:44:50,760
I felt like a loser.
I felt like if this girl didn't want me,

1033
00:44:50,761 --> 00:44:54,150
like I must be a fool,
I must be a failure.

1034
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,760
Well that's the,
we've all had that.

1035
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,890
And that's where you learn never to be
vulnerable again.

1036
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,430
And you learn to be a man sort of,
but you also learn to me,

1037
00:45:02,431 --> 00:45:05,010
I,
I've always been fascinated by

1038
00:45:05,011 --> 00:45:08,700
psychology and fascinated by the inner
workings of the mind and the tricks the

1039
00:45:08,701 --> 00:45:11,010
mind plays on you.
Cause all throughout high school,

1040
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,520
from age 15 on,
I was competing in martial arts

1041
00:45:14,521 --> 00:45:16,620
tournaments and there were terrifying,
you know?

1042
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,020
And so I was always scared and I would
go from,

1043
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:19,751
I mean,
I,

1044
00:45:19,751 --> 00:45:21,930
I'd like to say that all y'all was just
bad motherfucker.

1045
00:45:21,931 --> 00:45:24,060
I wasn't scared of Shit.
I was scared of fucking everything,

1046
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:26,280
man.
That's why I was good cause I was

1047
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,790
terrified and I was always training
super hard and I wouldn't drink it.

1048
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:31,560
I wouldn't do anything.
I wouldn't,

1049
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:35,400
I smoked pot maybe a couple of times
because I was fucking scared of getting

1050
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,410
killed.
I was scared of getting my ass kicked.

1051
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,650
So when this happened and this girl
broke up with me,

1052
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:44,130
it was so doug,
just devastating to my,

1053
00:45:44,590 --> 00:45:46,410
to,
to my confidence.

1054
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,360
And I remember thinking like,
God,

1055
00:45:48,361 --> 00:45:51,780
why do I feel like such a fucking loser?
And then breaking it down and try to

1056
00:45:51,781 --> 00:45:54,870
figure like,
how was I a winner just like a few

1057
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:56,820
months ago and now I'm a loser.
Like in my mind,

1058
00:45:56,821 --> 00:45:59,550
I feel like a fucking loser and I can't
get laid.

1059
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,910
Girls that smelled desperation.
I mean they run from me like Ah,

1060
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,680
like,
like 18 year old girls.

1061
00:46:04,681 --> 00:46:06,300
When you're desperate,
they fucking,

1062
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:09,510
they smell,
you stink like a sewer and they run from

1063
00:46:09,511 --> 00:46:11,190
you.
My couldn't get laid for like six

1064
00:46:11,191 --> 00:46:12,600
months.
I couldn't even get close.

1065
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:13,920
It's nature.
You,

1066
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:15,870
you played yourself,
you were vulnerable.

1067
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:18,180
You learned to never do that again.
And I think adult men,

1068
00:46:18,181 --> 00:46:21,600
especially married men,
have to understand that you're

1069
00:46:21,601 --> 00:46:24,030
constantly in high school when you're
married.

1070
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:27,000
It's not Dale Aiken when I was eight
years old,

1071
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:27,931
he said,
dude,

1072
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:30,000
when you're married,
you can just go up to your wife and go,

1073
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,790
let me see your tits.
Does she has to show you her tits right

1074
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:33,360
there.
And I thought,

1075
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,600
I cannot fucking wait.
I remember seeing him,

1076
00:46:36,601 --> 00:46:39,940
I'm just going to put my face in her
vagina and just go blow.

1077
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,600
Uh,
but you can't do that if I want it to my

1078
00:46:42,601 --> 00:46:43,980
wife and said,
show me a tip sheet.

1079
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,350
Say Fuck off.
So you're constantly wooing them

1080
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:47,910
according to,
and I had a buddy who got divorced

1081
00:46:47,911 --> 00:46:51,270
recently and he said,
I just found myself having to draw lines

1082
00:46:51,271 --> 00:46:54,780
in the sand and make these parameters
around how it can be treated and how it

1083
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:56,070
can be spoken to.
And he goes,

1084
00:46:56,071 --> 00:46:57,630
I've never had to do that before.
I shouldn't have to do that.

1085
00:46:57,631 --> 00:46:58,411
And they go,
dude,

1086
00:46:58,411 --> 00:47:00,870
that's what marriage is.
You're constantly on a date.

1087
00:47:00,871 --> 00:47:03,000
I was on a date with my wife last night.
Uh,

1088
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:06,150
we got a hotel in the city or my kids
are staying with their grant.

1089
00:47:06,230 --> 00:47:08,490
We're,
we're here on vacation in Malibu.

1090
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,770
And uh,
I was constantly going,

1091
00:47:10,771 --> 00:47:12,390
all right,
I wanted her to have a good night.

1092
00:47:12,391 --> 00:47:15,300
She wants to get Tacos,
but also I have to draw the line and

1093
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:15,571
say,
no,

1094
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:17,250
actually we're going here,
we're going to the comedy store,

1095
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,950
we're going to meet Don Barris and go
upstairs and blah blah.

1096
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:24,240
So I was giving her some democracy but
also taking the reigns and it's a push

1097
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,930
and pull that we've been married,
we've known each other since 2001 but

1098
00:47:27,931 --> 00:47:31,030
it's constantly like first day trying to
get in her pants,

1099
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,450
watch the real housewives,
pretend to care about that.

1100
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,130
Chico was Pinot Grigio all the time
trying to get pussy.

1101
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,410
You're not guaranteed the pussy.
No.

1102
00:47:41,411 --> 00:47:44,020
If you are,
you have a very strange relationship and

1103
00:47:44,021 --> 00:47:46,420
you probably not going to be satisfied
with it because that's part of what's

1104
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:50,920
going on in a relationship is that
wooing is also like kind of that wooing

1105
00:47:50,921 --> 00:47:52,260
and courting and,
and,

1106
00:47:52,261 --> 00:47:53,800
and,
and being nice to each other.

1107
00:47:53,801 --> 00:47:56,490
It's very important to like how the
whole thing works.

1108
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,120
Yes.
It's what attracts like we were,

1109
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,080
we were in Costa Rica on those stupid
sands of flights that are one engine.

1110
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:04,750
So if it goes out,
we're dying and the turbulence was

1111
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:05,584
insane.

1112
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,570
And so she's gripping me and I'm like,
it's okay.

1113
00:48:07,571 --> 00:48:09,430
It's just a bus.
We're in a bus in the sky.

1114
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:13,270
I am shitting my pants,
my heart is pounding through my chest

1115
00:48:13,271 --> 00:48:16,090
and I'm holding her rationally,
explaining to her what is going on.

1116
00:48:16,091 --> 00:48:17,290
And then I'm looking at the window
going,

1117
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:18,460
holy fuck,
we're going to fucking die.

1118
00:48:18,461 --> 00:48:19,480
We're going to fucking die.
Holy Shit.

1119
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,390
And I still married to her for years.
We've got kids.

1120
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:26,140
I have to convey this man in order to
keep her pussy wet.

1121
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,890
And it's the same with sons
particularly,

1122
00:48:29,891 --> 00:48:32,740
but kids in general.
But so much of being a dad is being a

1123
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:35,830
prison warden.
And even after bedtime,

1124
00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:38,770
you're walking down the hallways to see
if lights are on.

1125
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,190
The other day I go into my son's,
my middle son's room,

1126
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:44,920
I touch the light bulb is reading light
and I can feel it's warm.

1127
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:46,390
I'm like,
what's going on in here?

1128
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,400
Where you reading?
He was like,

1129
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:49,234
yeah,
a little bit.

1130
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:53,200
Bedtime is bedtime.
Went back with my little fucking,

1131
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:57,700
it was 10 30 at night and he's reading
mad magazine was blackjacks black

1132
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:00,640
[inaudible] thing when I was a kid,
cops had them.

1133
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,570
I remember it was like,
it was a leather like paddle with low

1134
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:07,570
shot and yeah,
whack people with it.

1135
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,270
So really shitty weapon cause it only
hurts,

1136
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,150
you know,
you walk someone out if you hit him on

1137
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:14,770
the jar,
the back of their head.

1138
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,400
But if you're covering up and someone's
whacking you with that blackjack,

1139
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:21,580
not so bad.
I'll take a shot with a black jack to

1140
00:49:21,581 --> 00:49:23,770
try to get ahold of you.
But like a club,

1141
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,680
like a club or a baton,
like that's going to really fucking

1142
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:28,240
hurt.
A blackjack is weird.

1143
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:29,350
It's a weird weapon.

1144
00:49:29,350 --> 00:49:30,850
It kind of went away.
They're like,

1145
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:32,440
yeah,
this isn't the best thing to be carrying

1146
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:34,480
around.
I remember wanting to get one of those

1147
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:37,120
aerial sort of in tennis.
Those are dangerous.

1148
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:38,680
Those cops told me I'm not allowed to
have that.

1149
00:49:38,681 --> 00:49:40,420
You can have a leather man,
you could buy those.

1150
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:41,770
Yeah,
but you're not allowed to have it on

1151
00:49:41,771 --> 00:49:44,110
you.
Leatherman and pepper spray or Anna

1152
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,670
maglite flashlight.
You can have,

1153
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:48,850
wait a minute.
So You concealed carry,

1154
00:49:48,851 --> 00:49:50,800
meaning walking around,
you're not allowed to have one of those,

1155
00:49:50,801 --> 00:49:53,920
but you're allowed to have a knife.
You could have a knife if it's a utility

1156
00:49:53,921 --> 00:49:56,380
knife and it's smaller than the palm of
your hand.

1157
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:58,270
I'm talking about New York rules.
Right?

1158
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:00,970
And then at Nyu I was going to do that
talk.

1159
00:50:00,971 --> 00:50:03,760
I got pepper sprayed.
Perfectly legal if they can argue that.

1160
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,320
No.
Who was pepper sprayed you and did you

1161
00:50:05,321 --> 00:50:07,120
see the person doing it and do you know
who they are?

1162
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,020
They are all the same.
They're all middleclass,

1163
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:13,060
uh,
kids of professors,

1164
00:50:13,061 --> 00:50:15,640
they all live at home.
They all look exactly the same.

1165
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:17,680
They look British.
Uh,

1166
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:18,491
how do they look?
British?

1167
00:50:18,491 --> 00:50:20,300
I don't know.
They have like these angular features

1168
00:50:20,301 --> 00:50:23,410
and these Roman noses in glasses,
they all look exactly the same.

1169
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:27,830
Nothing Italian about them.
Now what was it that they pepper sprayed

1170
00:50:27,831 --> 00:50:28,310
you about?

1171
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,520
Will you actually get going to do tacos
and going by the College Republicans?

1172
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,730
I started this gang called the proud
boys.

1173
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,070
And how boys?
The proud boys.

1174
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:41,090
What is was proud boys about?
We have chapters all over the world.

1175
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,390
We meet once a month.
We,

1176
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:45,620
uh,
we uh,

1177
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,070
get drunk and just,
it's like the elks lodge like Mason's or

1178
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:51,200
whatever.
Celebrating manhood.

1179
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,190
Yeah,
no women allowed.

1180
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,240
Oh Wow.
Can't tell your woman what goes on at

1181
00:50:54,241 --> 00:50:55,090
the meetings.
Uh,

1182
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,070
and we have different degrees like the
knights of Columbus first degree,

1183
00:50:58,071 --> 00:50:59,990
you declare yourself a proud boy.
Second degree.

1184
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:02,570
We'd beat the shit out of you until you
can name five breakfast cereals and you

1185
00:51:02,571 --> 00:51:06,020
have to give him masturbating.
And then third degree,

1186
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,870
you still have to give up masturbating,
but you have to get a tattoo and then

1187
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:12,620
fourth degree you get arrested or in a
serious violent fight for the grills.

1188
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:15,530
Yes.
You get arrested in a serious violent

1189
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:18,110
fights.
So you're promoted by some sort of major

1190
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,500
altercation.
You shouldn't erase that part.

1191
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,690
Well we don't,
we don't encourage it.

1192
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:27,470
But if you're defending is like at the,
at the Berkeley thing with Milo,

1193
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,890
we just,
the my guys just 14 of them just walked

1194
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:33,320
into a mob of 200 people just to get
their stripes.

1195
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:37,820
Said I thought you guys were tough.
No they were doing it just for fun and

1196
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:40,370
these people outside of pepper spray and
clubs,

1197
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:42,200
they can't fight.
Like at the Nyu thing,

1198
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:44,240
my guys were beating them up and he
goes,

1199
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:46,970
this one guy we call friar tuck cause
he's just a monster.

1200
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,740
He goes,
I started feeling bad in it.

1201
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,200
I started feeling bad after a while
cause I was just,

1202
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,350
I could tell these kids had never been
in a fight and I was just mowing through

1203
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,193
them.

1204
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:59,210
They're terrible fighters.
They're total proceeds fighting like

1205
00:51:59,211 --> 00:52:02,780
this is what confuses me.
Like why are they getting so angry that

1206
00:52:02,781 --> 00:52:05,180
they're hitting people and spraying that
girl in the face.

1207
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:08,210
The girl was really disturbing because
she was talking to someone and she

1208
00:52:08,211 --> 00:52:12,260
wasn't offering any threat and she,
she had a hat that looked like a make

1209
00:52:12,261 --> 00:52:15,620
America great again hat but it said make
bitcoin great again.

1210
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,500
They walk up to her,
the guy hits her with a stick that's

1211
00:52:18,501 --> 00:52:21,110
holding a sign.
So he hits her in the head with a piece

1212
00:52:21,111 --> 00:52:23,000
of wood and she's like,
what the fuck?

1213
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:25,280
And someone sprays her in the face with
pepper spray.

1214
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:29,840
I mean it's like how in any way,
how could you ever,

1215
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:34,841
in any other scenario justify beating a
woman publicly for doing nothing but

1216
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:42,110
representing what you think is offensive
and you're even a wrong about what she's

1217
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,944
representing.

1218
00:52:43,010 --> 00:52:44,570
Here's the problem with what you're
doing.

1219
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:49,010
And I did this too much to your
intellectualizing a fashion movement.

1220
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:54,220
This is the mods and the rockers in
Brighton Beach in 1961 just fighting

1221
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:57,710
each other because one likes Elvis and
the other likes the WHO.

1222
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,560
And if you were to sit down with this
mod in this rocker and say,

1223
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,810
have a debate,
they wouldn't say anything.

1224
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:05,750
They have nothing to say.
It's leather versus park cause it's

1225
00:53:05,751 --> 00:53:09,140
vespas worth versus triumph motorbikes.
There's no context there.

1226
00:53:09,260 --> 00:53:13,640
So this guy is on this team and she's on
the other team and that their tool is

1227
00:53:13,641 --> 00:53:15,440
pepper spray and that's what they're
doing.

1228
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:16,940
There's no that's,
they pretend,

1229
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,170
oh,
I don't want to give you a platform.

1230
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,630
No,
they don't want to give you in anything

1231
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,460
because they don't have anything to say.
In fact,

1232
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,070
at the Nyu talk I,
after I watched the pepper sprayed,

1233
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,160
I went and did the talk.

1234
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:27,340
They're all screaming,
uh,

1235
00:53:27,341 --> 00:53:28,800
who's campus?
Our campus.

1236
00:53:28,801 --> 00:53:32,990
As soon as I walk over to the mob with a
microphone and I have to and Oh,

1237
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:33,843
come on up,
come on up.

1238
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:37,380
And it was a radioactive cock.
I was handing him like,

1239
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,500
he just went,
well because then it was a mike.

1240
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,300
He shriveled up because he wanted to be
a part of the big group.

1241
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:45,180
Right.
And didn't want to be an individual with

1242
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:48,270
an opinion and didn't exactly know why
he was there in the first place and

1243
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,330
exactly know what he was protesting
against.

1244
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:53,550
That's why like Milo would kill to
debate any of these people.

1245
00:53:53,551 --> 00:53:55,560
He's,
he's been scrounging for pneumonia.

1246
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:57,960
The problem is that they're not
debating.

1247
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:01,320
That's the real problem.
I feel like this could be really

1248
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,890
productive if people could sit down in
Milo,

1249
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,730
by the way,
we'll debate you.

1250
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:07,770
I mean he might say outrageous things.

1251
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:09,960
He might say offensive things,
but he will debate.

1252
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:14,120
He will sit in front of a podium here.
We always time and anyone else will that

1253
00:54:14,121 --> 00:54:16,890
will have their time and they will be
able to take questions from the

1254
00:54:16,891 --> 00:54:19,350
audience.
And this could be very productive and

1255
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:24,351
you could kind of figure out like what
you and I are not far left and we're not

1256
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:25,380
far right.
You know,

1257
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:26,790
neither one of us are.
We're,

1258
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:30,570
we're in some sort of a weird way.
I think I'm more maybe more left than

1259
00:54:30,571 --> 00:54:32,940
you are,
but I'm not as left as a lot of people I

1260
00:54:32,941 --> 00:54:36,390
know and there's a lot of people out
there and I think this left white right

1261
00:54:36,391 --> 00:54:39,210
paradigm is really kind of fucking
foolish at this point.

1262
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:41,280
And we should kind of figure out like
what's,

1263
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,540
what's,
what's,

1264
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:46,170
what kind of opinions are okay to have
because they don't interfere with

1265
00:54:46,171 --> 00:54:47,280
anybody else's life.

1266
00:54:47,310 --> 00:54:49,680
And it's just a,
your philosophy and the way you look at

1267
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:52,950
the world and you should be able to
express that opinion and express those

1268
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:56,640
ideas in front of someone else who has
an opposing idea and they tell you why

1269
00:54:56,641 --> 00:55:00,450
they disagree and you should be able to
consider why they disagree and see if

1270
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:03,900
there's any merit in that.
The problem you're w with what you're

1271
00:55:03,901 --> 00:55:07,530
saying is you're implying that these are
all informed people right and left and

1272
00:55:07,531 --> 00:55:08,970
they need to hash out ideas.
No,

1273
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,500
these people on the right are
intelligent people who have looked it up

1274
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,180
and want to debate.
You want to see a good debate.

1275
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:20,810
Pat Buchanan versus Sean Hannity or
Peter Brimelow versus some open borders

1276
00:55:21,961 --> 00:55:24,010
libertarian like uh,
uh,

1277
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,370
Matt Walsh or something or someone from
the Wall Street Journal.

1278
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:29,490
All the inner right fights are
fascinating to me.

1279
00:55:29,790 --> 00:55:32,280
These people are religious fanatics.
They,

1280
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:34,260
they,
for them it's sports.

1281
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,560
It's The Dallas cowboys is their team
and they want to fuck up your team.

1282
00:55:37,561 --> 00:55:39,810
They don't want it to be like jared
diamond who did guns,

1283
00:55:39,811 --> 00:55:40,644
germs,
and steel.

1284
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:44,370
Tons of flaws with that book.
Steve sailor was begging him for debate.

1285
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,320
You wouldn't answer.
Uh,

1286
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:48,780
J uh,
jared Taylor,

1287
00:55:48,781 --> 00:55:49,800
John Derby,
Shire,

1288
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,870
all these three,
even Richard Spencer,

1289
00:55:51,871 --> 00:55:53,580
all these far right guys have made it
clear.

1290
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:57,660
They'd love to argue with anyone on the
other side and the other side knows that

1291
00:55:57,661 --> 00:56:01,560
they will lose because their foundation
isn't truth or information.

1292
00:56:01,561 --> 00:56:04,800
Their foundation is just emotions.
We're a nation of immigrants,

1293
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:06,470
so everything's racist.
Oh,

1294
00:56:06,770 --> 00:56:09,120
gays are people too.
And you like you think,

1295
00:56:09,121 --> 00:56:11,790
I don't think gays are fucking people.
What is your point?

1296
00:56:11,791 --> 00:56:14,190
I don't even understand your side of
things.

1297
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:16,080
Right.
Well I'm sure you saw that woman,

1298
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:17,611
excuse me,
who's a,

1299
00:56:17,611 --> 00:56:22,440
a a middle school teacher who uh,
was a part of the protest at Berkeley.

1300
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:22,830
Yeah.
Yeah.

1301
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:27,830
She was on Carlson Tucker Carlson show
and she was talking about fascism and

1302
00:56:28,541 --> 00:56:31,150
she said that Milo is homophobic even
though he's fucking gay.

1303
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:32,110
Yeah,
he's a racist.

1304
00:56:32,111 --> 00:56:34,210
Homophobe who sucks black cock.
Yeah.

1305
00:56:34,211 --> 00:56:37,480
It's so hilarious.
And she was also saying that he promotes

1306
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:40,720
genocide.
Like you can't just throw those labels

1307
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:41,960
out and that,
that,

1308
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,840
I mean it's a clear example of what
we're talking about.

1309
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:48,841
Cause those labels allow her to do
anything necessary to get you out of the

1310
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,860
mix.
And that's fascism.

1311
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:53,200
That is fascism,
that's authoritative,

1312
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,390
authoritative thinking,
authoritarian thinking in a,

1313
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,600
in a way that's eliminating someone else
from expressing themselves because you

1314
00:57:01,601 --> 00:57:04,270
have deemed them unworthy of expressing
themselves.

1315
00:57:04,271 --> 00:57:06,130
They're off.
This is a racist,

1316
00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:08,890
this is a homophobe.
This is someone who promotes genocide.

1317
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:11,040
We will shut them down.
Like that's,

1318
00:57:11,090 --> 00:57:14,560
that's nonsense.
And you could see from her talking on

1319
00:57:14,561 --> 00:57:17,230
that show that she,
she talks over him.

1320
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,040
She doesn't express herself well.
She doesn't have clearly thought out

1321
00:57:21,041 --> 00:57:23,470
reasons for why she's saying he does
these things.

1322
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:25,240
She doesn't have quotes and she's
relying on,

1323
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,420
she doesn't say why it's so dangerous
that he has these controversial

1324
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:30,910
opinions.
She just says he's a Nazi,

1325
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,190
he's a racist,
he's a homophobe.

1326
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:35,110
He promotes genocide.
We're going to shut them down.

1327
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:37,800
But you can't just say that.
You can't just label people cause

1328
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,090
someone could do that to you too.
And they will.

1329
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:41,620
They will.
That's the problem.

1330
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:44,590
I forget her name.
Michelle give Ellis [inaudible] her

1331
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,080
name.
Is she really in my car

1332
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:51,180
by any means necessary.
But I was game.

1333
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:53,010
I like playing with these people is play
it through.

1334
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,570
They do that at AIA.
They go,

1335
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:55,470
you want to be here?
Okay,

1336
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:57,060
have a beer,
then you're gonna have another beer,

1337
00:57:57,061 --> 00:57:58,530
then you're going to get coke and
heroin,

1338
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:58,741
blah,
blah,

1339
00:57:58,741 --> 00:57:59,320
blah.
Play it through.

1340
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,780
Right.
And I always say to these people,

1341
00:58:00,781 --> 00:58:02,400
play it through.
So he wants genocide.

1342
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,840
Trump wants denison.
Okay?

1343
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:06,860
So he wants to kill what blacks and uh,
Mexicans.

1344
00:58:06,861 --> 00:58:11,861
So there's a van that drives to this
house in New Orleans and picks up these

1345
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:14,070
black people and then they went,
they go to a gas chamber.

1346
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,020
How does this work?
What happens to their property?

1347
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,210
Is that divvied up?
Does a state on that now?

1348
00:58:18,211 --> 00:58:20,190
Like are you talking about the Cuban
revolution?

1349
00:58:20,191 --> 00:58:21,390
The irony is,
by the way,

1350
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:23,520
whenever you start describing their
universe,

1351
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,710
you end up describing Venezuela,
Cuba,

1352
00:58:25,830 --> 00:58:28,350
socialist countries,
or you end up describing the Middle

1353
00:58:28,350 --> 00:58:28,510
East.

1354
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:29,790
Oh,
he's going to want throw gays off

1355
00:58:29,791 --> 00:58:31,100
buildings.
He's going to,

1356
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:33,450
uh,
start stoning women to death who are

1357
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:36,030
rape victims.
You have your villains right there,

1358
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:39,570
but you're purposely ignoring him.
And the other thing that's going on

1359
00:58:39,571 --> 00:58:41,630
here,
which is still a theory I'm working on,

1360
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,500
but there seems to be a disturbing peek
at what a matriarchy would be like.

1361
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:51,950
And I'm seeing a lot of women in these
movements who are sort of vindictive and

1362
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:56,070
cruel and like this woman we were
talking about,

1363
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:56,701
uh,
you know,

1364
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,800
you watch these videos and you hear like
fuck them up,

1365
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:03,270
get 'em get 'em these women voices from
behind the crowd and I called him shit

1366
00:59:03,271 --> 00:59:03,940
chest

1367
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,140
woman from the University of Missouri.
Can I get some muscle over here?

1368
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,140
Remember her?
Yeah,

1369
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,551
yeah,
yeah,

1370
00:59:08,551 --> 00:59:09,100
yeah,
yeah.

1371
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:11,980
She wants men to fight on her behalf.
And you know,

1372
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:13,750
iron man has that blue thing in his
chest.

1373
00:59:13,770 --> 00:59:15,760
Yeah.
I don't think women are evil.

1374
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:17,650
I like women are like ironman there
magic.

1375
00:59:17,651 --> 00:59:20,140
Right?
But by ripping out that blue thing,

1376
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:21,880
you're ripping out the

1377
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,780
ability to have children and be mothers
and everything.

1378
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,080
And then you put in a piece of shit into
iron man's chest.

1379
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,110
That's what feminists and like this
woman are there shit chests

1380
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,430
and they're malfunctioning robots and
they're like,

1381
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:37,940
this kill him.
Milo wants genocide killing.

1382
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:41,630
So do you think that they're imitating
what they think are patriarchal

1383
00:59:41,631 --> 00:59:44,000
societies?
They're doing their version of it and

1384
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:47,810
that's what they're doing with this.
The whole matriarchal posturing.

1385
00:59:47,811 --> 00:59:48,920
Yeah.
It's like Clark Kent,

1386
00:59:49,010 --> 00:59:51,030
I want to run an article.
Ah,

1387
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:52,340
I'm writing Christian.
No,

1388
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,740
you're not ready it.
And you go clerk,

1389
00:59:54,741 --> 00:59:56,090
simmer down,
dude.

1390
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,980
You write your article.
I'm doing mine.

1391
00:59:58,010 --> 00:59:59,540
No.
And he crunches.

1392
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:01,640
Oh,
there's not a whole lot of matriarchal

1393
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,440
societies in the animal world other than
hyenas.

1394
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:07,970
I try it.
There's a few of them.

1395
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,460
There's a few where the females are
larger than the males.

1396
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:14,810
A few bugs especially,
but hyenas in particular,

1397
01:00:14,811 --> 01:00:16,940
the female Hyena is,
are much larger than the males.

1398
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,760
Even at fake dicks really have a pho
penis.

1399
01:00:19,761 --> 01:00:22,550
He has this big large tube,
fake Dick that hangs down.

1400
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:26,390
They actually give birth out of it and
they climb on top of the males and they

1401
01:00:26,391 --> 01:00:28,940
fucked him.
And the speculation when there's a lot

1402
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,680
of speculation as to why the females are
bigger,

1403
01:00:30,681 --> 01:00:35,510
but one of them is that they think that
she has to be bigger because Cayenne is

1404
01:00:35,511 --> 01:00:37,340
are so goddamn ruthless.
They eat their babies.

1405
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,070
Oh,
so the female has to go get the fuck

1406
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:43,100
away from the baby cooked up when she
gets on top of books,

1407
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,650
you pieces of Shit.
It's my baby.

1408
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,660
I mean,
there's no more,

1409
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:49,310
you know,
no pun intended,

1410
01:00:49,311 --> 01:00:51,890
dog eat dog world than a fucking Hyena
world.

1411
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,800
You're out there fighting for scraps
with lions.

1412
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:55,670
Yeah.
Well,

1413
01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,540
I actually have described to Antifa and
these people as hyenas because that

1414
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:02,030
thing I was talking about at Berkeley
where there are guys went in and said,

1415
01:01:02,031 --> 01:01:03,560
I thought you guys were like tough or
something,

1416
01:01:03,561 --> 01:01:04,394
was his exact quote.

1417
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:06,200
And they're going get him,
get him,

1418
01:01:06,201 --> 01:01:08,330
fuck him up.
And then the guys sort of give up

1419
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,790
because no one wants to fight them.
They start walking away and then someone

1420
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:14,360
runs up behind him,
knocks him out with a flag pole as

1421
01:01:14,361 --> 01:01:16,460
they're screaming these Italian slogans,
by the way,

1422
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:17,330
like,
no fuck.

1423
01:01:17,331 --> 01:01:21,350
She's thought [inaudible] oh from the
1920s are having fun.

1424
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,770
They knock yet game there.
Larping and then knocked him out.

1425
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,370
And then as soon as he's out,
the hyenas come out and then they start

1426
01:01:28,371 --> 01:01:30,920
kicking his unconscious body and they
start grabbing their,

1427
01:01:30,921 --> 01:01:32,180
really?
Yeah,

1428
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:33,450
it's online.
You can find it.

1429
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,630
Oh,
ugly savages.

1430
01:01:35,631 --> 01:01:36,620
The scary thing,
man,

1431
01:01:36,621 --> 01:01:38,970
you're going to invite right wing people
to,

1432
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:41,120
to do the same thing and you're going to
get some,

1433
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:44,570
some veterans and you're going to get
some fighters and you can do,

1434
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,840
and it's,
it's gonna.

1435
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,530
It's gonna be horrific man.
It's going to be horrific.

1436
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:51,320
And again,
you start kicking their ass and then

1437
01:01:51,321 --> 01:01:53,720
they're going to come back with weapons
and people are going to show up with

1438
01:01:53,721 --> 01:01:56,180
guns.
It always leads to someone showing up

1439
01:01:56,181 --> 01:01:59,240
with guns maybe.
And if this keeps going and these,

1440
01:01:59,241 --> 01:02:01,700
these protests,
especially the things like the Milo

1441
01:02:01,701 --> 01:02:04,280
protest,
I mean maybe now that Milo has been

1442
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:09,550
humiliated and it at least temporarily
side tracked or put down for a bit while

1443
01:02:10,611 --> 01:02:14,540
he has to rebuild.
Maybe someone can come along and have

1444
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:18,450
reasonable dialog and do some sort of a
campus be I don't like it.

1445
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:20,040
Why is he doing these things on
campuses?

1446
01:02:20,041 --> 01:02:21,810
First of all,
I don't think he gets paid for most of

1447
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:22,740
them.
What?

1448
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:27,330
My theory with Milo is a,
I think his eyesight's getting worse.

1449
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:30,780
His glasses are getting thicker and
thicker and he's sorta going,

1450
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:33,990
this is my moment to make an impact.
So he's just like,

1451
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:35,400
you think he's going blind?
I think so.

1452
01:02:35,401 --> 01:02:37,350
Yeah.
You just theorizing this.

1453
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,200
Yeah.
He's only like 28.

1454
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:41,640
Yeah.
But you look at him,

1455
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,160
he's just can't reading glasses.
They're insane.

1456
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,143
Really?
Yeah.

1457
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:47,240
And they're getting thicker.
Maybe it's stress,

1458
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:49,800
stress,
stressing his eyes worse.

1459
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:52,410
Um,
I don't know.

1460
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:53,273
I'm not a doctor.

1461
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:58,740
I can't think it would be good.
But I think he's trying to make a

1462
01:02:58,741 --> 01:03:02,610
maximum impact in a short amount of time
because you think he doesn't have much

1463
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:03,720
time left.
That's such a way.

1464
01:03:03,721 --> 01:03:06,600
He seems healthy.
Totally wrecked eight.

1465
01:03:06,601 --> 01:03:07,980
In fact,
when we were in Orlando,

1466
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:09,750
we made out at the site of the,
uh,

1467
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,500
you guys made out at the Milo to offend
Muslims.

1468
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,060
Wow.
So I said,

1469
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,890
what was,
I did a big speech about freedom and

1470
01:03:16,891 --> 01:03:21,030
funny states in this America delicious
strawberries.

1471
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,010
Well,
at least he freshens breath up before no

1472
01:03:24,090 --> 01:03:25,200
gaze just tastes better.

1473
01:03:27,330 --> 01:03:28,350
I said,
fuck is lamb.

1474
01:03:28,351 --> 01:03:31,920
And then we made out at the site of the
Orlando shooting to the Noi Muslims,

1475
01:03:31,921 --> 01:03:33,870
but we had armed guards and stuff.
And I said,

1476
01:03:33,871 --> 01:03:35,040
all right,
I want to make sure these guys are

1477
01:03:35,041 --> 01:03:37,470
scoping out the rooms and shit.
And he goes,

1478
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:39,840
I don't care if I die,
I'll happily die for this.

1479
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:40,921
I was like,
well,

1480
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:41,940
I do care.
Actually.

1481
01:03:41,941 --> 01:03:43,500
I've got three kids.
What does,

1482
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:45,660
is it Neil Ism or nihilism?
I always say it wrong.

1483
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:47,100
I always say nihilism,
nihilism,

1484
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:52,370
that nihilistic sort of instinct that he
has.

1485
01:03:52,921 --> 01:03:57,180
He has a burn it all down instinct.
And I think he has that with his life as

1486
01:03:57,181 --> 01:03:59,250
well.
And I think a lot of that,

1487
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,310
um,
I'm playing some serious bro

1488
01:04:02,311 --> 01:04:04,170
psychologists here.
You know,

1489
01:04:04,171 --> 01:04:07,440
some armchair psychology from someone
totally unqualified,

1490
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:12,470
but you've got to attribute that to in
at least in some ways being molested as

1491
01:04:12,781 --> 01:04:13,614
a child.

1492
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,400
I would imagine that his experiences
that he's calling positive experiences

1493
01:04:17,401 --> 01:04:20,940
when he was young,
in many ways those could have

1494
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:25,170
potentially damaged him and also being
young and being homosexual and being

1495
01:04:25,171 --> 01:04:29,610
rejected.
All of those things wreck havoc and you

1496
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,320
develop this,
fuck you,

1497
01:04:31,321 --> 01:04:34,620
I want to burn it down.
And this is one of the strategies that

1498
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:39,621
he sort of adopted that strategy to be
this guy who was very difficult for like

1499
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:41,730
he's,
he's gay,

1500
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:47,300
he's an English gay guy who's a right
winger and mean it's,

1501
01:04:47,781 --> 01:04:50,400
it's so baffling to them.
They don't know what to do.

1502
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:54,870
They hate it because they see blacks and
gays as their little pets and they like

1503
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:57,450
putting them on the front lines and
going look good who were helping.

1504
01:04:57,690 --> 01:04:59,640
And then when one of them defects to the
other side,

1505
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:03,480
they become particularly outraged,
but very few defect at the level that

1506
01:05:03,481 --> 01:05:04,290
he's defected.

1507
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:05,121
Right?
I mean,

1508
01:05:05,121 --> 01:05:09,630
he turned around and started attacking
direct guy who bankrupted buzzfeed with

1509
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,840
the Hulk Hogan lawsuit.
Peter Thiel,

1510
01:05:12,841 --> 01:05:13,770
is that his name?
Teal.

1511
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,150
Teal.
Teal.

1512
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,130
Uh,
the silicon valley billionaire.

1513
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:19,510
He's on trump's sort of board,
right,

1514
01:05:19,511 --> 01:05:21,280
isn't he?
He's one of the people that trump has

1515
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:23,710
appointed to help him with technology or
something.

1516
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:26,320
I think there's some sort of,
see if he could find with it.

1517
01:05:26,321 --> 01:05:28,230
It's Polish it up.
Jamie a,

1518
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,820
there's some sort of a,
a,

1519
01:05:29,821 --> 01:05:31,240
a position that he has.
I mean,

1520
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:35,230
he's an interesting one cause he's a gay
man and he's a hugely successful

1521
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,970
entrepreneur,
billionaire character.

1522
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:38,530
So He's,
he's a weird one too.

1523
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:41,170
Like these guys that get that they're
supposed to,

1524
01:05:41,171 --> 01:05:42,070
like,
if you're gay,

1525
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,740
you should be on the left.
If you are,

1526
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,010
you know,
if you're,

1527
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:45,870
you know,
uh,

1528
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,410
transgender,
you should be on the left.

1529
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,460
Like when Bruce Jenner became Caitlyn
Jenner and steady still against gay

1530
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,510
marriage,
everybody was like,

1531
01:05:52,511 --> 01:05:53,740
what about fuck?

1532
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:57,880
What in the fuck?
He's a trump supporter and he's against

1533
01:05:57,881 --> 01:06:00,550
gay marriage.
But now call me Caitlyn,

1534
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:03,760
and this is my favorite part was when
they asked him like,

1535
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:05,230
uh,
like ellen,

1536
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:07,540
like really sort of grilled him on it
and he goes,

1537
01:06:07,541 --> 01:06:10,690
we're all more of a traditionalist or
you definitely aren't you?

1538
01:06:10,691 --> 01:06:12,430
Fuck,
well that makes sense to me though.

1539
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:17,700
Cause if you see women as so special
that it's a major thing to go over

1540
01:06:17,951 --> 01:06:20,110
there,
then you must have a 1950s view of a

1541
01:06:20,111 --> 01:06:24,340
lady that's a Dorothy Day girl with a
poodle skirt doing the vacuuming because

1542
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:28,090
liberals and college students just go.
You and I are chicks,

1543
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:33,010
so they don't see it as a long jump,
but Bruce Jenner sees it as this massive

1544
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,330
pole vault.
Can I Peter Thiel?

1545
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:34,960
Yeah,
sure.

1546
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,030
Peter Thiel,
Teal ads,

1547
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:39,580
uh,
allies to trump transition.

1548
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:42,040
So it says,
starting to make his mark on trump's

1549
01:06:42,041 --> 01:06:47,041
transition team teal,
a billionaire investor and facebook

1550
01:06:47,411 --> 01:06:51,730
board member joined the transition team
days after the election and gradually

1551
01:06:51,731 --> 01:06:53,380
bringing in other members of his circle.

1552
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:57,730
While teal clashed with Silicone Valley
during the campaign by endorsing trump

1553
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,240
early,
this group may be the strongest or only

1554
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:05,110
bridge between the tech industry.
And the president elect,

1555
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:10,840
this is to me,
while Gavin's painting,

1556
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,960
this is to me the most volatile time
that I can ever remember.

1557
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:21,460
Like the most vulnerable I've felt like
our country is like as a nation,

1558
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:24,430
like as a structure,
as a traditional structure like

1559
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:27,190
president and vice president,
Congress and Senate.

1560
01:07:28,540 --> 01:07:31,390
Now that Gavin's returning,
I was just saying that I think this is

1561
01:07:31,391 --> 01:07:35,500
the most vulnerable I've ever felt like
this country is in terms of like its

1562
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:36,640
structure.
Yeah.

1563
01:07:37,030 --> 01:07:39,770
I just see it as a soldier divided
cleanup.

1564
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,440
I feel great.
Yeah.

1565
01:07:41,470 --> 01:07:43,510
Why do you think it's a cleanup and in
what way?

1566
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,050
Uh,
trump hiring people as heads of

1567
01:07:47,051 --> 01:07:50,230
departments that hate that department.
I hate the government.

1568
01:07:50,320 --> 01:07:52,150
I want it reduced to almost nothing.

1569
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:54,940
Right?
So when you have someone in the

1570
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,740
Department of Education that likes
charter schools and hates public

1571
01:07:56,741 --> 01:07:58,660
schools,
I go get in there.

1572
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:01,480
Just start dismantling the unions,
the teachers' unions.

1573
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:04,720
Start tearing them to shreds,
make it possible to fire a teacher.

1574
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,790
Let's get the free market.
And that is a huge,

1575
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,140
wonderful,
that is a huge issue.

1576
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:12,580
I have a friend whose daughter is going
to the school and he is absolutely

1577
01:08:12,581 --> 01:08:16,090
furious because the teacher has tenure.
You literally can't fire the most.

1578
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:20,060
They commit some sort of a felony and
this woman doesn't give a fuck about her

1579
01:08:20,061 --> 01:08:25,061
classes and he was describing like how
negligent she is as a teacher and how

1580
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:30,870
how careless and how little effort she
puts into it because she has the class,

1581
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:33,950
it's hers,
it's like a free paycheck and she's just

1582
01:08:33,951 --> 01:08:38,690
not the type of person that's committed
to our work and she can't be fired and

1583
01:08:38,691 --> 01:08:42,590
he's so furious and so frustrated with
the public school system and how it all

1584
01:08:42,591 --> 01:08:43,220
works at.

1585
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,560
He's gonna pull his daughter out and put
her in a private school now.

1586
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:46,730
Yeah,
I had to do that too.

1587
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:49,150
I got to,
I call it the $40,000 posted note.

1588
01:08:49,151 --> 01:08:50,660
I've got to post postnatal my daughter's
homework and said,

1589
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:53,600
you're awesome while you are.
No Way.

1590
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:55,390
Yup.
Public schools.

1591
01:08:55,391 --> 01:08:59,300
She also got no markers because my
daughter used markers on our homework.

1592
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:03,200
M R K no markers.
This is a teacher.

1593
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,360
Yeah.
Wow.

1594
01:09:05,510 --> 01:09:07,190
Well,
if you don't have that squiggly red line

1595
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:09,230
underneath your text,
it's very difficult to tell what the

1596
01:09:09,231 --> 01:09:11,210
fuck you just said and what's wrong with
it.

1597
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:14,240
Does it,
does this trump thing bother you with

1598
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:16,070
the tax returns?
No,

1599
01:09:16,071 --> 01:09:17,390
not at all.
That bothers me a lot.

1600
01:09:17,690 --> 01:09:18,560
Really?
Yes.

1601
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,420
Cause I want to know how much money he
makes from Russia.

1602
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,510
He's got significant business ties with
Russia apparently.

1603
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:26,600
W were you concerned about Hillary's
ties with Russia?

1604
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:27,230
No.
Look,

1605
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:27,691
look,
mom,

1606
01:09:27,691 --> 01:09:30,900
I'm know Hillary's porter by any stretch
of the imagination.

1607
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:34,940
I think she's impossibly corrupt.
I think she represents,

1608
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:38,000
um,
this system where people get to a place

1609
01:09:38,001 --> 01:09:41,840
of influence and they use that influence
to make massive amounts of money by

1610
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:46,040
giving speeches to bankers and finding
ways to profit and look there.

1611
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,660
They're shutting down the Clinton
Foundation,

1612
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,710
right?
You're aware of that,

1613
01:09:48,711 --> 01:09:49,200
right?
Yeah.

1614
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,260
Like this is,
yeah.

1615
01:09:50,261 --> 01:09:50,730
I mean,
this,

1616
01:09:50,730 --> 01:09:51,210
this,
this,

1617
01:09:51,210 --> 01:09:53,690
the whole thing was a big,
as soon as she hasn't had any power

1618
01:09:53,691 --> 01:09:54,290
anymore.
Gee,

1619
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:56,150
how weird at this whole thing is
shutting down.

1620
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:57,580
It's a pay to play scheme.
Yep.

1621
01:09:57,740 --> 01:10:00,350
And that's really what it's been the
entire time and everyone knows that,

1622
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,570
but it's one of those things where the
left didn't want to talk about it

1623
01:10:02,571 --> 01:10:04,670
because it weakens our position.
It strengthens the right,

1624
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:08,090
but by not talking about it,
it makes them extremely vulnerable as

1625
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:08,510
well.

1626
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:12,230
So I'm the,
I'm no supporter of anything that she

1627
01:10:12,231 --> 01:10:15,080
stand for or bill stands for,
especially now,

1628
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:17,930
but he,
he makes me nervous.

1629
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,060
Their skin,
they're spending more money on travel

1630
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:22,160
and he complained how much of Obama
spent on travel.

1631
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,850
The trump will have spent more money on
travel in the first seven months than

1632
01:10:26,851 --> 01:10:30,170
Obama did in the entire eight years was
in the White House because he's flying

1633
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,880
back and forth tomorrow,
Lago,

1634
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,380
back and forth to Manhattan.
He's doing whatever the fuck he wants to

1635
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:38,450
find his kids when his kids have to fly
to do business forum,

1636
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,660
when they're opening up casinos,
it's all secret service.

1637
01:10:41,690 --> 01:10:44,720
Everything is being done with taxpayer
money.

1638
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:47,390
It's,
he is the most very consistently

1639
01:10:47,391 --> 01:10:52,391
threatened president in history.
I mean that the Daily Mail printed this,

1640
01:10:52,430 --> 01:10:52,821
no,
sorry.

1641
01:10:52,821 --> 01:10:57,020
The Daily News in New York printed this
list of how many people would have to be

1642
01:10:57,021 --> 01:11:01,160
killed to get to a Democrat and they go,
we're just throwing this out there just

1643
01:11:01,161 --> 01:11:01,750
so you can see.

1644
01:11:01,750 --> 01:11:04,970
We'd have to be this person and then
there's the vice president and the

1645
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:06,800
secretary,
then the postmaster general blah blah,

1646
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:07,101
blah,
blah,

1647
01:11:07,101 --> 01:11:07,934
blah,
and you go,

1648
01:11:07,970 --> 01:11:10,460
why are you publishing hit lists?
Why would they do that?

1649
01:11:10,930 --> 01:11:12,980
Because the pizzas come in.
I've seen it all over the place.

1650
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:15,030
People will read it.
Comedians are talking about it too,

1651
01:11:15,031 --> 01:11:17,250
like let's just take them out and you
just got to be taken out.

1652
01:11:17,251 --> 01:11:21,300
Comedians are saying more said something
strange could happen before some crazy

1653
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:23,460
horror said.
Something like that too.

1654
01:11:23,461 --> 01:11:25,520
Well that was Sarah Silverman too.
She had this thing she was,

1655
01:11:25,521 --> 01:11:28,020
she was advocating,
she was saying that once the military

1656
01:11:28,021 --> 01:11:30,040
steps in the mad king will no longer be
there.

1657
01:11:30,041 --> 01:11:34,050
Like what?
You do not want the fucking military to

1658
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:37,770
run the country ever.
Do you understand what that means?

1659
01:11:37,771 --> 01:11:40,290
If they can kill the president,
that can kill you too.

1660
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,960
Do you?
You have to be absolutely out of your

1661
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:46,680
fucking mind to want the military to
step in and run the country.

1662
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:50,460
You are advocating a military
dictatorship because by the way,

1663
01:11:50,461 --> 01:11:53,760
that's what happens in the military
comes over when they take over.

1664
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,550
You don't get a vote.
There's no fucking vote now that's all

1665
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,140
gone.
The people with the guns are now running

1666
01:11:58,141 --> 01:12:01,350
things and they do whatever the fuck
they want and it's very inconvenient for

1667
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:05,580
them to have to sit down and listen to
people who go to Largo on Tuesday night

1668
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:09,890
to watch Sarah Silverman speak like it's
very inconvenient for them to take your

1669
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:11,940
opinion into consideration and they're
not going to,

1670
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,440
well,
the implication there too is that she's

1671
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:18,110
running it like General Brigadier Judd
Apatow is calling up the commands of

1672
01:12:18,111 --> 01:12:20,100
God.
General Patton Oswald just don't think

1673
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:21,900
they found the tanks.
They haven't thought it through.

1674
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,700
They never think it through because it's
just religion.

1675
01:12:23,701 --> 01:12:26,430
It's all platitudes.
It's all mods and rockers made up.

1676
01:12:26,431 --> 01:12:27,750
Shit.
What's also,

1677
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:32,520
there's a lot of posturing online when
you're making these statements online.

1678
01:12:32,521 --> 01:12:35,730
You're doing it to not just because you
have something to say,

1679
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,450
which I believe there's something there,
but also because you want love.

1680
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:43,560
You want people to,
to like what you're saying,

1681
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:45,870
you want people to retweet it.
You want people to say,

1682
01:12:45,871 --> 01:12:48,300
hey,
that guy is really on the ball.

1683
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,330
That girl is really on top of politics.
Yeah,

1684
01:12:51,331 --> 01:12:53,880
you go girl.
You know you're saying the right things.

1685
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:54,780
Yeah,
fuck him.

1686
01:12:54,781 --> 01:12:55,720
We've got to get up.
But they're,

1687
01:12:55,721 --> 01:12:59,100
they're not,
they're not thinking this thing out.

1688
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,550
You had a contest.
There's a fucking contest.

1689
01:13:02,790 --> 01:13:05,910
The person that you had go against the
person that you were,

1690
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:11,180
you didn't want to win sucked.
So the person who won won the fucking

1691
01:13:11,191 --> 01:13:12,024
contest.

1692
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:15,330
You can't just come in and say,
now the military has to take over

1693
01:13:15,331 --> 01:13:17,340
because I don't agree with the results
of the contest.

1694
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:21,780
We have a country,
the country is filled with 350 million

1695
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:22,614
people,
uh,

1696
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:27,300
enough with your shitty electoral
college system decided that this guy

1697
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,280
should win the contest.
He Won.

1698
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:31,980
He won fucking fair and square.
Whether or not the Russians were

1699
01:13:31,981 --> 01:13:35,100
involved in hacking the DNC.
Take that aside,

1700
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:38,580
look at it for what it is,
because what the Russians exposed was

1701
01:13:38,581 --> 01:13:40,770
fucking corruption.
And I don't,

1702
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,410
they are obsessed with these emails and
I go,

1703
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,360
you know,
that's not what lost it for her.

1704
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:48,160
There was no real smoking guns and those
emails there was,

1705
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:49,870
what's her name,
uh,

1706
01:13:49,871 --> 01:13:50,660
donate,
uh,

1707
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,690
to come up with questions for CNN.
There was jake tapper looking dirty and

1708
01:13:54,691 --> 01:13:56,580
there,
there was a jake tapper looked dirty

1709
01:13:56,581 --> 01:13:57,780
from,
uh,

1710
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:02,250
he looked like he was getting questions,
talking points from the DNC.

1711
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,290
There was shit up.
Yeah.

1712
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:05,160
There was,
um,

1713
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:10,340
there was also the,
the very clear collusion where they were

1714
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:13,840
making that Bernie Sanders did not win
the primaries.

1715
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,240
Right.
That was where it was most disturbing to

1716
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:18,760
me because it's that leap through
emails.

1717
01:14:18,761 --> 01:14:19,840
Yes,
yes.

1718
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:20,943
Yeah.
I mean,

1719
01:14:21,090 --> 01:14:22,660
she did something corrupt.
Yeah.

1720
01:14:22,661 --> 01:14:24,580
She,
it's not the crops and they're saying,

1721
01:14:24,581 --> 01:14:25,840
well,
the Republicans didn't,

1722
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:29,860
didn't get exposed and well,
the implication is that the Russians had

1723
01:14:29,861 --> 01:14:31,210
something on them,
but there was a deal.

1724
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:33,670
But how do you know that's the case?
They might not have done anything

1725
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:35,290
illegal.
That's also possible.

1726
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:38,380
It's possible.
It's possible that if you look at the

1727
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,190
very minimal amount of things that were
done by the DNC,

1728
01:14:42,220 --> 01:14:44,830
there's just a few incidents.
None of them landed anybody in jail.

1729
01:14:44,831 --> 01:14:47,050
Right.
So I think we can kind of agree that

1730
01:14:47,051 --> 01:14:49,240
whether or not they are corrupt,
they're fairly minimal,

1731
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,150
even though you are fucking with
democracy.

1732
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:54,310
I mean that's what you're doing when
you're rigging the primers.

1733
01:14:54,311 --> 01:14:56,680
You're fucking with democracy.
No one went to jail.

1734
01:14:56,710 --> 01:14:59,920
So the worst case scenario that they
were a tribute that was attributed to

1735
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:04,480
them was still not enough to warrant a
criminal investigation or jail time.

1736
01:15:04,810 --> 01:15:07,660
Then you have the other side and you're
supposed to assume that their side was

1737
01:15:07,661 --> 01:15:10,780
more egregious or was it equal and we're
just not exposed.

1738
01:15:10,781 --> 01:15:11,620
Like what?
Look,

1739
01:15:11,621 --> 01:15:13,990
all the shit that was exposed.
Look at all,

1740
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:17,050
look at that Billy Bush interview you're
telling me that sounded worse than

1741
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:19,780
anything that was exposed on the other
side as far as like public opinion,

1742
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,570
it seemed to resonate more.
I don't know why it was just a dumb

1743
01:15:22,571 --> 01:15:23,800
joke,
but it seemed to be,

1744
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:26,110
that's what that march was.
It was a pussy joke.

1745
01:15:26,111 --> 01:15:27,040
March.
Look,

1746
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:29,590
trump won because of transgender
bathrooms.

1747
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:31,390
He won because of the grievement
industry.

1748
01:15:31,540 --> 01:15:34,690
He won because of the liberal media
spinning stories.

1749
01:15:34,691 --> 01:15:37,330
He won because we're all sick of
governor obamacare.

1750
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:41,020
Obamacare was a lot of factors.
There was so much animosity built up

1751
01:15:41,021 --> 01:15:43,930
against the establishment that when
Rodney dangerfield showed up in,

1752
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:46,000
in Tartan Pants,
and today you whoa,

1753
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:46,750
Whoa,
whoa,

1754
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,730
someone stepped on a duck.
We all went,

1755
01:15:48,731 --> 01:15:51,730
that fucking guy.
I want him to come in and just blow it

1756
01:15:51,731 --> 01:15:54,520
all up and let's start from scratch.
It doesn't leak.

1757
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:56,620
But the,
but the ties to the Russians,

1758
01:15:56,621 --> 01:15:58,330
that doesn't bother you at all?
No.

1759
01:15:58,540 --> 01:16:00,040
The fact that he won't release his
taxes,

1760
01:16:00,041 --> 01:16:01,270
it doesn't bother you at all?
No,

1761
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,990
that bothers me because we should know
where money comes from.

1762
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:08,860
But look at what they do.
Look at this obsession with reframing.

1763
01:16:08,861 --> 01:16:12,240
Things like Milo's sentence,
uh,

1764
01:16:12,460 --> 01:16:17,460
has been construed to mean he wants 13
year olds to have sex all the time with

1765
01:16:17,591 --> 01:16:18,424
adults.

1766
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:20,110
Uh,
every time they get a,

1767
01:16:20,470 --> 01:16:23,080
like w ann coulter said,
our blacks are better than their blacks.

1768
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:26,290
She meant conservative.
Blacks tend to be more well researched

1769
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:29,230
cause they get a hammering at
Thanksgiving from their family and

1770
01:16:29,231 --> 01:16:31,870
they're not conforming to the majority
of their race.

1771
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:37,020
So they tend to be heartened that gets
construed into ankles or thinks we still

1772
01:16:37,211 --> 01:16:41,380
have slaves and blacks.
So you can just see the way these tax

1773
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:43,660
returns,
especially in an era where we seem to

1774
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:46,390
hate entrepreneurs and we seem to hate
wealth.

1775
01:16:46,391 --> 01:16:48,990
And me,
I've heard so many people criticized

1776
01:16:48,991 --> 01:16:53,800
trump saying he's a billionaire or the
betsy devoss cause she's a billionaire

1777
01:16:53,980 --> 01:16:56,320
and you go since when is that a fucking
insult?

1778
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,080
That's the only thing everyone on earth
wants to be.

1779
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,213
Well,
okay.

1780
01:17:00,660 --> 01:17:04,000
I mean you're kind of setting up a bit
of a straw man with that because I don't

1781
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:07,810
think that's just what people are
challenging and what people are upset

1782
01:17:07,811 --> 01:17:11,510
about with trump with they're about is
that they believe that he might be

1783
01:17:11,511 --> 01:17:15,710
influenced by foreign governments that
have a vested interest in controlling

1784
01:17:15,711 --> 01:17:16,670
our democracy.

1785
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,410
And that's what the Russian thing is
scary.

1786
01:17:18,411 --> 01:17:21,800
If he's making considerable amount of
money in Russia and a considerable

1787
01:17:21,801 --> 01:17:25,160
amount of money in China,
you have to wonder whether or not he

1788
01:17:25,161 --> 01:17:28,370
will be influenced by that financial
tie,

1789
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:32,510
by those financial ties and whether or
not that that will influence way the

1790
01:17:32,511 --> 01:17:35,570
policy that it creates in this country.
Whether or not he allows things to

1791
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:37,790
happen that we don't think should
happen,

1792
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,950
just so that he can profit valid
concern,

1793
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,520
but it's not proven yet.
And if it is proven,

1794
01:17:43,521 --> 01:17:45,170
we'll drag him out of the White House by
his heels.

1795
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:48,320
But don't you think that the only way
you're ever going to really prove that

1796
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,810
is by seeing his taxes?
You have to,

1797
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:53,400
you have to see his tax returns and how
business works.

1798
01:17:53,401 --> 01:17:55,910
We,
that's why I bring up this Auntie Auntie

1799
01:17:55,911 --> 01:17:59,720
entrepreneurial age.
Like with the bankruptcy laws in the

1800
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,670
nineties everyone was taking advantage
of bankruptcy laws because the

1801
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:03,440
government was so bad at its job.

1802
01:18:03,710 --> 01:18:05,450
So they,
uh,

1803
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:08,510
trump had to go on at the same with his
manufacturing,

1804
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:11,120
his ties in China.
I've tried to make things in America

1805
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:14,720
like toy dolls it,
they were going to be 17 times the price

1806
01:18:14,721 --> 01:18:16,880
if we didn't make them in China.
So it wasn't like it would be a

1807
01:18:16,881 --> 01:18:18,920
challenge.
It just wasn't possible.

1808
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:23,630
Once that system is like that,
you have to adhere to that system if

1809
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:25,970
you're going to eventually change it.
And I think people are going to see

1810
01:18:25,971 --> 01:18:27,740
these tax returns,
they don't know what the fuck they're

1811
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:28,970
doing and they're going to go,
oh,

1812
01:18:28,971 --> 01:18:31,580
here's proof that he's in bed with these
people.

1813
01:18:31,581 --> 01:18:33,080
But well,
some people are going to be able to

1814
01:18:33,081 --> 01:18:35,740
analyze them and come up with accurate
assessments of where,

1815
01:18:35,741 --> 01:18:39,200
where he's being influenced and where he
makes money and why that can be a

1816
01:18:39,201 --> 01:18:41,210
problem and why could be a conflict of
interest.

1817
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:43,100
But we should be able to have that
information.

1818
01:18:43,370 --> 01:18:47,480
Every single president before him has
been forthcoming with that information.

1819
01:18:47,650 --> 01:18:48,110
He,
yeah,

1820
01:18:48,110 --> 01:18:51,650
every day was going to release a
financial loser maybe,

1821
01:18:51,860 --> 01:18:55,790
but he said he was going to release it
up until the moment where he got in and

1822
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:56,900
then he said,
no,

1823
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,590
why should I?
I guess I dunno.

1824
01:18:58,620 --> 01:19:00,230
It's,
you don't think they should force him to

1825
01:19:00,231 --> 01:19:01,820
release the tax returns?
She to me,

1826
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,200
like these,
these people,

1827
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:03,580
they,
they're,

1828
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:06,440
they're worried about foreign influence.
We had Hillary,

1829
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:09,360
uh,
showing us her foreign influence,

1830
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,380
rainy,
and we showed her selling the

1831
01:19:12,381 --> 01:19:14,510
presidency,
having Bill Clinton do a talk about this

1832
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:15,950
doesn't exonerate trump,
right?

1833
01:19:15,980 --> 01:19:17,330
No,
but where were you then?

1834
01:19:17,660 --> 01:19:19,460
You pronounce it of you,
right?

1835
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:21,200
You're right.
We're not talking to them.

1836
01:19:21,201 --> 01:19:22,680
Right.
We talking to me and I'm,

1837
01:19:22,681 --> 01:19:26,210
I'm not a left wing hillary supporter
and in any way,

1838
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:27,020
shape or form.

1839
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:29,120
I just think that if we're going to have
a president,

1840
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:31,610
we have to have some pretty universal
rules that we follow.

1841
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:35,330
And one of them should be,
the president should be beyond

1842
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,960
influenced by foreign governments.
And there's really,

1843
01:19:38,150 --> 01:19:41,990
there's really not a whole lot of ways
to tell what's influencing you other

1844
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:43,520
than tax returns.
So you,

1845
01:19:43,650 --> 01:19:45,440
you're implying that in these tax
returns,

1846
01:19:45,441 --> 01:19:46,940
you're going to see massive checks from
rush.

1847
01:19:46,941 --> 01:19:48,980
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying we should find out.

1848
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:51,351
I mean,
you should.

1849
01:19:51,351 --> 01:19:52,550
Absolutely.
You're,

1850
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:53,870
you're the president.
You shouldn't,

1851
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:56,150
it's,
it's very eroding.

1852
01:19:56,610 --> 01:20:00,050
It erodes the public confidence.
If you hide that,

1853
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,040
if you conceal that,
if you don't tell us where you have your

1854
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:06,910
money stored,
you don't tell us where you're,

1855
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:09,240
where you're making money,
where you have bank accounts,

1856
01:20:09,241 --> 01:20:10,950
where you,
where you know there's,

1857
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:14,550
there's a lot of factors involved in a
guy like trump was running a massive

1858
01:20:14,551 --> 01:20:19,050
global empire and if,
if we don't know like where he's being

1859
01:20:19,051 --> 01:20:22,170
influenced through his financial
connections,

1860
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:24,690
I feel it,
I feel like that's really problematic

1861
01:20:24,691 --> 01:20:25,650
and I think it's,
it's,

1862
01:20:25,651 --> 01:20:29,870
it's a real dangerous thing to deny it
because it's always been,

1863
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:33,120
it's always her spin,
what presidents do and we've always said

1864
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:35,250
it was a good thing and I always thought
it was law.

1865
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:37,920
I thought it was mandatory.
I never knew that there was a way to get

1866
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:41,310
around under a,
they're under the being an under audit

1867
01:20:41,311 --> 01:20:44,340
right now that was over.
He says it's still going and it's been

1868
01:20:44,341 --> 01:20:47,070
going since the 70s or something like
that or that atl area.

1869
01:20:47,071 --> 01:20:49,360
So he just has to keep the audit going
then it doesn't have to tell us how

1870
01:20:49,361 --> 01:20:49,880
much.
Yes.

1871
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,120
I mean,
I understand your logic.

1872
01:20:51,121 --> 01:20:53,220
I just,
the bigger picture here is I think that

1873
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:57,060
people don't understand that he took a
major hit and uh,

1874
01:20:57,090 --> 01:21:00,390
becoming president financially.
And I think that was part of the appeal.

1875
01:21:00,630 --> 01:21:01,830
Americans went,
Holy Shit,

1876
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:03,720
you're putting it all on the line for
us.

1877
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:07,680
But he's not losing tons of my sons are
running the business and they're doing a

1878
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:10,740
great job doing it took a huge hit and
none,

1879
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:13,990
oh yeah.
How so is residences the golf courses?

1880
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,300
Well,
that Mara Lago,

1881
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:18,470
the attendance is up and they raise the,
uh,

1882
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:23,010
admission fee to $200,000 a year.
That's how much it costs now to join

1883
01:21:23,070 --> 01:21:26,130
there.
My understanding is the brand with his

1884
01:21:26,131 --> 01:21:29,340
residencies and his golf clubs and
everything else took a major hit.

1885
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:32,580
And I understand that because it's like
if you're in New York and you say,

1886
01:21:32,581 --> 01:21:34,560
we're up mets,
mattress company,

1887
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:37,110
well it doesn't,
it's not that people are anti med,

1888
01:21:37,111 --> 01:21:38,970
but now Yankees fans don't want your
mattress.

1889
01:21:38,971 --> 01:21:41,400
So Z,
anything political when you're a brand

1890
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:44,520
like that is going to lose you 50% of
your followers.

1891
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:46,860
And he went on a limb and if you'd lost
the election,

1892
01:21:46,950 --> 01:21:50,070
he still would have had that brand
damage without any of the benefits and

1893
01:21:50,071 --> 01:21:52,110
what he saw and put everything on black
and they went,

1894
01:21:52,350 --> 01:21:55,680
I appreciate you risking that.
Has that been proven that his brand has

1895
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:56,250
been damaged?

1896
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:01,250
Like if there's been any studies of like
attendance or a residency's dropping

1897
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:04,620
that shit up.
It wasn't the people that owned condos

1898
01:22:04,621 --> 01:22:08,100
in one of the trump buildings tried to
change the name in New York.

1899
01:22:08,101 --> 01:22:10,920
They literally ripped the word trump off
of their building.

1900
01:22:11,490 --> 01:22:12,330
They did do that,
right?

1901
01:22:12,331 --> 01:22:13,050
Yep.
Yeah,

1902
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,830
they had construction and these are
people that own condos in that building.

1903
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:17,890
Right.
So it's a,

1904
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:22,590
it's a place where you buy the New York.
So weird like that.

1905
01:22:22,591 --> 01:22:24,420
You buy your apartment.
It's so strange.

1906
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:27,360
But they pulled the trump name down.
Oh,

1907
01:22:27,361 --> 01:22:29,640
whose,
whose idea is that and how do we get

1908
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:32,730
away board all agreed it was a
democratic decision and they said,

1909
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:34,530
we don't want to sell.
They probably don't want to be targeted

1910
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:36,660
to,
because I was there right after the

1911
01:22:36,661 --> 01:22:38,400
election.
I just happened to be there because of

1912
01:22:38,401 --> 01:22:41,460
the UFC was there and Madison Square
Garden right after the election.

1913
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:45,960
So I walked to the gym and when I came
back it was like,

1914
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:49,830
why we're in the gym,
the the riots or the parade?

1915
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,360
The march started and so we walked back
right in the thick of it and they were

1916
01:22:54,361 --> 01:22:58,290
parked out in front of the trump tower,
just fucking scream and a bunch of

1917
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:00,780
fucking losers.
I saw the project,

1918
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:01,381
k,
k,

1919
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:02,430
k,
racist,

1920
01:23:02,431 --> 01:23:03,900
sexist,
anti gay.

1921
01:23:04,080 --> 01:23:06,610
His guy just kept screaming that.
Where did that even come from?

1922
01:23:06,640 --> 01:23:08,290
They,
they did another thing where they,

1923
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:09,220
they,
first of all,

1924
01:23:09,221 --> 01:23:11,440
they dance up freedom outside of Mike
Pence,

1925
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:13,390
his house.
He's not even there.

1926
01:23:13,720 --> 01:23:16,480
Like he gives a fuck.
He never said gaze can't dance.

1927
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:20,620
And then they just do that in New York.
They start making out with each other in

1928
01:23:20,621 --> 01:23:21,880
front of the trump building.
Like he's going to go,

1929
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:23,450
oh,
stop it.

1930
01:23:23,570 --> 01:23:24,810
Stop it army.
Oh,

1931
01:23:24,870 --> 01:23:27,550
I can't see Gargamel from the smurfs.

1932
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:29,830
I hade that.
Well,

1933
01:23:29,860 --> 01:23:34,420
it's the same thing we were talking
about earlier with labeling Milo a Nazi

1934
01:23:34,421 --> 01:23:39,190
and a fascist and homophobic and
promoting genocide.

1935
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:41,800
If you just say those words and defined
someone,

1936
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:45,130
you immediately put them in a nice box
that you can attack.

1937
01:23:45,190 --> 01:23:46,280
Right?
And so by someone you,

1938
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:48,760
this guy was right next to me fucking
screaming it.

1939
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:51,640
Donald Trump KKK,
racist,

1940
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:53,740
sexist anti day.
This was hilarious.

1941
01:23:53,741 --> 01:23:55,570
He saw a black guy come in,
he starts yelling,

1942
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:58,090
black lives matter,
black lives matter.

1943
01:23:58,420 --> 01:24:00,160
I was like,
oh you son of a bitch.

1944
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:03,190
You fuck.
They come up with this concept that the

1945
01:24:03,191 --> 01:24:06,130
president is pro hate.
So then they go,

1946
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:08,350
hey trump,
I'm against hate.

1947
01:24:08,770 --> 01:24:10,060
And he goes,
that's nice.

1948
01:24:10,270 --> 01:24:13,360
So they build a straw man and then
they're attacking him and letting him on

1949
01:24:13,361 --> 01:24:16,560
fire and the rest of us are going,
I don't care that your lighting is scare

1950
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:19,300
crow on fire.
You look fucking ridiculous.

1951
01:24:19,330 --> 01:24:22,750
Well it's,
it's not empowering their cause to be

1952
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:29,250
exaggerating about his stances on things
like gay rights or any of these other

1953
01:24:30,161 --> 01:24:31,420
things.
It's not empowering.

1954
01:24:31,421 --> 01:24:34,870
So when you say he's KKK,
when you say he's anti gay,

1955
01:24:35,110 --> 01:24:37,800
when you say he's racist without like
real proof,

1956
01:24:37,801 --> 01:24:42,801
like you could say that he has said some
very racist things about some Mexicans.

1957
01:24:43,571 --> 01:24:45,190
You can say that.
No you can't.

1958
01:24:45,220 --> 01:24:46,570
Well,
you could say that you just talking

1959
01:24:46,571 --> 01:24:50,080
about all the rapists and murderers that
are coming over from Mexico who crossed

1960
01:24:50,081 --> 01:24:51,400
the border,
the women get raped.

1961
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:54,430
They're at the point now where these
women just take contraception.

1962
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,020
Uh,
as part of the deal,

1963
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:58,270
it,
it's almost like it's not rape at this

1964
01:24:58,271 --> 01:25:00,820
point because it's a currency.
Let's see.

1965
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:03,400
You're talking to people that are coming
across was saying they're sending

1966
01:25:03,401 --> 01:25:04,330
they're rapists.

1967
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:05,710
Okay.

1968
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:08,620
Uh,
and they are a Mexico as an program

1969
01:25:08,621 --> 01:25:11,740
where they send their criminals over the
board that he did a good job of

1970
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:14,260
expressing that if that's what people
really want to say.

1971
01:25:14,261 --> 01:25:17,440
And I think he could have been more
measured and he could have done it in a

1972
01:25:17,441 --> 01:25:19,210
way that would,
but that's not how he talks.

1973
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:22,960
He could've done it in a way that would
have removed any doubt as to what his

1974
01:25:22,961 --> 01:25:24,910
intentions are.
How he feels about people,

1975
01:25:24,970 --> 01:25:27,820
right?
But it is chest like sometimes he talks

1976
01:25:27,821 --> 01:25:30,480
like an idiot,
they're doing bad things and then

1977
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:31,090
okay

1978
01:25:31,090 --> 01:25:33,010
you realize four days later,
Holy Shit,

1979
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,380
that was brilliant.
So with the Mexicans thing,

1980
01:25:35,470 --> 01:25:37,090
these Mexicans are rapists.
You go what?

1981
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:39,100
And then you look it up and go,
Holy Shit,

1982
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:42,070
80% of these women get raped crossing
the border by these coyotes.

1983
01:25:42,071 --> 01:25:44,650
Holy Crap.
And then another example of this,

1984
01:25:44,651 --> 01:25:47,500
him being four steps ahead,
is when he says he's trying to do this

1985
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:48,370
travel ban,
right?

1986
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,590
Muslims are a threat to America.
And everyone goes,

1987
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:52,270
that's crazy.
And then he says,

1988
01:25:53,020 --> 01:25:55,990
the press isn't reporting on the
following terrorism cases,

1989
01:25:55,991 --> 01:25:56,711
this,
this,

1990
01:25:56,711 --> 01:25:57,191
this,
this.

1991
01:25:57,191 --> 01:25:59,290
He lists about 20 so then the meeting he
goes,

1992
01:25:59,291 --> 01:26:01,180
that's not true.
We reported on this,

1993
01:26:01,181 --> 01:26:02,920
we were putting on that,
we put it on the London bombing,

1994
01:26:02,921 --> 01:26:04,550
we on Bengazi,
we reported on this.

1995
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:09,710
And then he dupe them into talking about
terrorism for three days straight.

1996
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,800
All of a sudden his travel ban looks
pretty reasonable.

1997
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,330
Ah,
that's interesting.

1998
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:17,180
So he's off.
He's often setting a trap for people

1999
01:26:17,181 --> 01:26:19,040
that they come bounding into.
Well,

2000
01:26:19,041 --> 01:26:20,960
whether or not he's doing it on purpose
or whether or not,

2001
01:26:20,961 --> 01:26:25,961
just by finding things that he can say
that backup his point,

2002
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:29,660
he's starting that conversation off in a
way that they wouldn't ordinarily start

2003
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:30,980
off.
It might have been what happened with

2004
01:26:30,981 --> 01:26:31,814
Sweden,
where he goes,

2005
01:26:31,940 --> 01:26:34,820
look what happened with Sweden last
night on a particularly dead night in

2006
01:26:34,821 --> 01:26:36,830
Sweden.
Now you could say,

2007
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:40,190
look how many blacks died in gang
warfare today in Chicago.

2008
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:42,450
It might be none today,
right?

2009
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:45,320
But the average is years to write.
And when you look it up and you go,

2010
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:48,410
Holy Shit,
780 people died in Chicago this year.

2011
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:52,940
W is today the 22nd there was a
significant event on the 21st in Sweden.

2012
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,650
Massive laughs.
Yeah,

2013
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:55,250
yeah.
Look,

2014
01:26:55,250 --> 01:26:57,700
it's Sweden has got problems.
Europe has problems there.

2015
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,720
They definitely do.
And whenever you have people from one

2016
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:03,140
culture that immigrate into another
culture and they're disenfranchised and

2017
01:27:03,141 --> 01:27:08,141
poor and they have a really not,
so I'm just going to keep going with it.

2018
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:10,790
But,
and they also have a really restrictive

2019
01:27:10,791 --> 01:27:14,720
fucked up culture that they're coming
from and they want to impose that

2020
01:27:14,721 --> 01:27:18,590
culture on the people that live in
Germany or wherever and they want women

2021
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:21,680
to start wearing long dresses and they
treat them like they're whores.

2022
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:23,990
If they don't,
that's all fucking real dangerous.

2023
01:27:23,991 --> 01:27:27,020
They're from a different part of the
world and it's a part of the world that

2024
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:32,350
hasn't changed much in a long time.
And that part of the world,

2025
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:35,630
I mean you could call it culture,
you can call it religious tradition,

2026
01:27:35,631 --> 01:27:39,350
but whenever you're dealing with a part
of the world that still has honor

2027
01:27:39,351 --> 01:27:43,980
killings and female genital mutilation
and you don't let women drive and you

2028
01:27:43,981 --> 01:27:45,800
know you,
you women aren't allowed to vote and you

2029
01:27:45,801 --> 01:27:49,510
have this incredibly restrictive world
that you are,

2030
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,430
your existing him and then you bring
that world somewhere else,

2031
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:53,780
you're going to have a culture clash.

2032
01:27:53,990 --> 01:27:55,520
And you're seeing that.
And this is,

2033
01:27:55,521 --> 01:27:56,480
this is,
you know,

2034
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:00,920
if you want people to be free and you
want people to have the ability to

2035
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:03,890
integrate into a more free culture like
America is,

2036
01:28:04,010 --> 01:28:07,610
you also have to be honest about what
the consequences are and you have to be

2037
01:28:07,611 --> 01:28:09,800
honest about what kind of culture
they're coming from.

2038
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,860
And as soon as you talk about that,
you get labeled in Islamophobia.

2039
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:15,830
Soon as you talk about this incredibly
restrictive,

2040
01:28:15,831 --> 01:28:18,890
misogynistic culture that's based on an
ancient,

2041
01:28:19,010 --> 01:28:24,010
ancient series of rituals and beliefs.
Do you become a racist and a bigot by

2042
01:28:24,301 --> 01:28:27,770
talking about a reality like when
they're not a race?

2043
01:28:28,220 --> 01:28:30,890
You're talking about culture and I,
it's important to make that distinction

2044
01:28:30,891 --> 01:28:33,770
as a Western chauvinist that I think the
West is the best.

2045
01:28:33,771 --> 01:28:36,470
I don't care what race you are,
but I don't think that other cultures

2046
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:40,130
are different.
I think they're worse and Islam is 500

2047
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:41,870
years behind us.
We were shitty.

2048
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:45,050
We had witch hunts inquisition,
we had the inquisition.

2049
01:28:45,080 --> 01:28:47,270
They're doing,
they're not caught up to us yet.

2050
01:28:47,271 --> 01:28:49,880
They're not as advanced.
And I think two big problems with them

2051
01:28:49,881 --> 01:28:53,510
as far as progress,
progress goes is the Koran is an

2052
01:28:53,511 --> 01:28:57,200
exceptionally violent book.
It doesn't have a 2.0 the way Christians

2053
01:28:57,201 --> 01:29:00,410
do and no one ever talks about this.
But they have a major problem with

2054
01:29:00,411 --> 01:29:02,070
inbreeding.
They

2055
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:05,460
are marrying their first cousins again
and again and again.

2056
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:09,810
And that makes your evolution group
works.

2057
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:12,030
Is this true?
Where are you getting that from?

2058
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:15,630
I never ever heard of ginnaty.
I think it's called Muhammad said it's

2059
01:29:15,631 --> 01:29:19,860
okay to marry your first cousin for real
and you do that once or twice.

2060
01:29:19,861 --> 01:29:23,910
It's pretty bad and you do it for 40
generations and now you're going back in

2061
01:29:23,911 --> 01:29:27,210
time and look at Iran in 1965 mini
skirts,

2062
01:29:27,211 --> 01:29:29,910
woman doing chemistry with test tubes,
driving around.

2063
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:33,000
Hi,
you want to go to the Gogo hot later and

2064
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:35,280
now just garbage bags.
Oh,

2065
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:39,000
Gregorian chants everywhere.
They've gone backwards in time.

2066
01:29:39,001 --> 01:29:42,480
And I blame obviously the,
the courage and the culture and

2067
01:29:42,481 --> 01:29:45,270
religion,
but also I think inbreeding enables them

2068
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:47,800
to get hijacked by these radicals.
I mean we've got,

2069
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:50,130
you think they can beat snakebites in
America?

2070
01:29:50,131 --> 01:29:51,720
Can you mentioned them taking over
Christianity?

2071
01:29:51,930 --> 01:29:52,763
Do you think,
well,

2072
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:54,750
there are people in America,
right,

2073
01:29:54,751 --> 01:29:56,910
that the do do that still.
It's hilarious.

2074
01:29:56,970 --> 01:30:00,510
But they're not taking over America.
The way they took over of the Middle

2075
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:03,120
East you think is the same.
They're the equivalent as far as their,

2076
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:05,490
yeah,
I think Irshad Manji and uh,

2077
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,650
uh,
the trouble with Islam,

2078
01:30:07,651 --> 01:30:12,651
she says a weird group of Wasabi is just
hijack their religion and sent it into

2079
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:13,920
the dark ages.
And I go,

2080
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:17,100
yeah,
but how were they vulnerable to

2081
01:30:17,101 --> 01:30:20,580
hijacking Christianity?
Couldn't be hijacked by the snake guys.

2082
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:24,990
So why,
and I think a part of it was inbreeding.

2083
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,420
Uh,
this is our own theory.

2084
01:30:27,690 --> 01:30:28,021
No,
no,

2085
01:30:28,021 --> 01:30:30,390
no.
Look at them and breeding major,

2086
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:32,010
major problem.
Never heard this,

2087
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:34,410
but especially with immigrants in
Britain,

2088
01:30:34,411 --> 01:30:38,010
like the Pakistanis in London,
they'll have all kinds of serious

2089
01:30:38,011 --> 01:30:42,240
inbreeding problems because that's an
even smaller sample size you're dealing

2090
01:30:42,241 --> 01:30:43,074
with.
Ha.

2091
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:44,490
And every time I bring this up,
people go,

2092
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,530
Yo,
what about white people hillbillies?

2093
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,570
They were in breeding or royalty.
They were in breeding.

2094
01:30:48,571 --> 01:30:49,590
And I go,
yeah.

2095
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:52,400
And it went real bad.
It was a bad move.

2096
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:54,570
Learned the hard way we saw it.
Deliverance.

2097
01:30:55,380 --> 01:30:56,101
Well,
there was the first,

2098
01:30:56,101 --> 01:30:57,690
I've heard of it,
but pull it up.

2099
01:30:57,691 --> 01:30:58,530
I'm,
I'm sure.

2100
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,770
I'm sure you're not lying.
You find anything?

2101
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:05,140
Something on snopes popped up.
So,

2102
01:31:05,230 --> 01:31:06,160
oh,
snopes,

2103
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:08,650
snopes.
Snopes is,

2104
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:11,650
I've,
once I found out about the origins of

2105
01:31:11,651 --> 01:31:15,340
snopes and who's running snopes,
the guy who married a prostitute and

2106
01:31:15,341 --> 01:31:17,860
left his wife and didn't know the whole
deal that guys partying.

2107
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:21,550
He married some woman who was an escort.
You ever seen the story on snopes?

2108
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:23,770
Yeah.
The guy who ran snopes ran it with his

2109
01:31:23,771 --> 01:31:26,440
wife,
left his wife for a prostitute.

2110
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:29,530
She's still in him because all the money
he spent on prostitutes.

2111
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:32,170
And uh,
now he married the prostitute and she's

2112
01:31:32,171 --> 01:31:35,310
not a prostitute anymore.
Now she works for snopes and uh,

2113
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,120
oh wow.
I knew it was a husband and wife team.

2114
01:31:37,121 --> 01:31:38,480
I didn't know that's how they met.
Yeah,

2115
01:31:38,481 --> 01:31:39,040
yeah,
yeah.

2116
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:39,721
Now.
Well the,

2117
01:31:39,721 --> 01:31:42,610
there was a husband and wife team and
now it's a husband with the new wife.

2118
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:46,510
And then there are suing each other,
the ex wife and the husband or suing

2119
01:31:46,511 --> 01:31:48,010
each other over who gets the money.

2120
01:31:48,130 --> 01:31:51,310
Some big crazy story,
but he's just got a big fucking smile on

2121
01:31:51,311 --> 01:31:52,840
his face and he's hanging out with this
girl.

2122
01:31:52,841 --> 01:31:57,100
He used to be an escort and I find that
distasteful unless it's Richard Gere and

2123
01:31:57,101 --> 01:31:58,810
Julia Roberts.
Cause they're gorgeous.

2124
01:31:58,811 --> 01:31:59,980
And I like it.
Well,

2125
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:03,160
I think it's the best looking guy.
But the prostitute at one point in time,

2126
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:04,450
the Gow who,
uh,

2127
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,650
worked as an escort,
I should say,

2128
01:32:05,651 --> 01:32:09,070
I don't want to be disrespectful.
I dated an escort ones.

2129
01:32:09,130 --> 01:32:11,650
Did you Holla while she was escorting?
No.

2130
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:15,070
Post Post.
She was molested as a kid.

2131
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,540
Ooh.
So she,

2132
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:19,540
for sex for her,
we had to go super intense,

2133
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,690
like public humiliation.
She wanted me to slap her in a grocery

2134
01:32:22,691 --> 01:32:24,160
store and stuff.
Oh Jesus.

2135
01:32:24,250 --> 01:32:27,100
Because intimacy had been ruined by dad.
Oh.

2136
01:32:27,190 --> 01:32:30,340
So that we had to leap over that and get
right into mean stuff.

2137
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,270
Fuck man.
Yeah,

2138
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:34,210
it wasn't great.
But that brings me back to what you were

2139
01:32:34,211 --> 01:32:36,550
saying earlier.
Let's just spitball here.

2140
01:32:36,640 --> 01:32:38,260
Okay.
Molestation gaze.

2141
01:32:38,440 --> 01:32:39,820
Here's my theory.
First of all,

2142
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:44,530
I think 1% of people are gay and 1% 1%
in theory,

2143
01:32:44,540 --> 01:32:47,330
like you were thinking 10 all the time.
And it's crazy.

2144
01:32:47,331 --> 01:32:49,690
It's fucking nuts.
Told people that's not.

2145
01:32:49,691 --> 01:32:51,910
So remember your classrooms,
you'd have three classes.

2146
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:55,390
There was that one fe guy who wore
lacrosse a few costs.

2147
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:57,340
There's a few,
I mean it might be as high as five,

2148
01:32:57,460 --> 01:32:58,810
but it's definitely,
I mean,

2149
01:32:58,811 --> 01:33:01,810
unless you're in some place with maybe
some sort of a gas leak,

2150
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:05,230
well that's what we're getting at nature
and nurture.

2151
01:33:05,231 --> 01:33:06,400
So out.
So there's,

2152
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,320
these are gays,
these are lesbians.

2153
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:13,770
I think a higher proportion of lesbians
are that way for getting from getting

2154
01:33:14,231 --> 01:33:17,050
molested.
And it's easier to go with a woman cause

2155
01:33:17,051 --> 01:33:18,310
they're not as gross as Cox.

2156
01:33:19,090 --> 01:33:22,870
So I'm in a more nurturing and they're
also been sexualized by our culture.

2157
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:23,771
Right?
I mean,

2158
01:33:23,771 --> 01:33:26,320
they're constantly on billboards selling
things and the right,

2159
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:28,810
you know,
and it's girls kissing girls is hot,

2160
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,700
you know,
you can just get a strap on there.

2161
01:33:30,701 --> 01:33:32,410
I can have a dude and I want to think of
dad.

2162
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:35,050
I'm just totally spit balling here,
making it up.

2163
01:33:35,370 --> 01:33:37,420
I'm going to say a third of lesbians
were molested.

2164
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:40,120
Right.
That's a lot.

2165
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,700
I'm going to lie within the percentage
of gays.

2166
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:45,040
Less than that.
I'm gonna say a fifth,

2167
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:47,260
a fifth.
This is talking out of my ass here.

2168
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,560
A fifth of gay.
So it's possible that Milo was that way.

2169
01:33:50,710 --> 01:33:53,320
Lena Dunham,
sister Lena brags about molesting her

2170
01:33:53,321 --> 01:33:55,480
sister.
She's a lesbian now she has.

2171
01:33:55,630 --> 01:33:56,860
Yup.
Jesus.

2172
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,740
So maybe you get molested.
It could be by anyone.

2173
01:33:59,770 --> 01:34:01,670
And Sex,
you know,

2174
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:03,910
brings you bad feeling thing.

2175
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:06,880
When children experience sex,
when they're not sexual,

2176
01:34:06,881 --> 01:34:08,830
like when they're not,
their hormones have been kicked in.

2177
01:34:08,831 --> 01:34:12,190
They haven't reached puberty and they
experienced sex at a very early age.

2178
01:34:12,191 --> 01:34:15,040
They become hypersexualized.
And they say that that's one of the

2179
01:34:15,041 --> 01:34:16,750
things that happens to women that are
molested.

2180
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:21,130
And they speculate that that could also
be one of the things that happened to

2181
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:25,480
men when they experience a molestation
by another man at an early age.

2182
01:34:25,690 --> 01:34:28,690
And there's an imprinting that happens,
Christopher Ryan,

2183
01:34:28,691 --> 01:34:31,360
where the author of a sex at dawn has
talked about this,

2184
01:34:31,710 --> 01:34:34,870
but there's imprinting that happens
during the formative years and I forget

2185
01:34:34,871 --> 01:34:38,350
what those years are.
I think he said between 10 and 14.

2186
01:34:38,530 --> 01:34:42,120
But things that can happen during those
years are they like,

2187
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:46,750
they like a lock in and that's where
people develop fetishes and they develop

2188
01:34:46,751 --> 01:34:51,160
all sorts of weird sort of like kinky
sort of things that they connect to sex.

2189
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:55,180
And it's because of the fact that your
body and mind are developing your

2190
01:34:55,181 --> 01:34:56,650
hormones kicking in.
Yeah.

2191
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:57,890
Yeah.
Makes Sense.

2192
01:34:58,610 --> 01:34:59,443
Well,
it's uh,

2193
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:03,020
it's,
it's a disturbing trait and your job as

2194
01:35:03,021 --> 01:35:08,000
a parent and as a society is to keep
kids as pure for as long as possible.

2195
01:35:08,001 --> 01:35:11,090
You want Santa to go as long as humanly
possible.

2196
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:12,880
He wanted the Easter bunny.
The,

2197
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,900
I don't,
I even nine 11.

2198
01:35:15,260 --> 01:35:19,970
My kids don't know what nine 11 is.
I'm keeping that race to racism.

2199
01:35:20,270 --> 01:35:21,830
They,
I just want them to know that that guy

2200
01:35:21,831 --> 01:35:24,110
has dark skin.
I don't want them to know any of those

2201
01:35:24,111 --> 01:35:26,420
other things.
And we're living in a culture where

2202
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:31,720
we're normalizing so much decadence that
we're destroying our own innocence in

2203
01:35:32,151 --> 01:35:36,320
the process.
Strap yourself in for this 70% of all

2204
01:35:36,321 --> 01:35:41,321
Pakistanis are inbred and in Turkey the
amount is between 25 to 30% more

2205
01:35:44,091 --> 01:35:45,740
stillbirths among immigrants.

2206
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:49,100
A rough estimate reveals that close to
half of everybody living in the Arab

2207
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:52,250
world is inbred.
A large percentage of the parents that

2208
01:35:52,251 --> 01:35:55,070
this is blowing my mind.
Large percentage of the parents that are

2209
01:35:55,071 --> 01:35:56,270
blood.
Where's this coming from?

2210
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:59,150
What does this website,
I blog posted it before I came here.

2211
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:01,820
He gave media,
but these are all the sources that went

2212
01:36:01,821 --> 01:36:03,740
to this is a,
this sources reproductive health

2213
01:36:03,741 --> 01:36:05,420
journal.com.
Uh,

2214
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:07,730
this is a BBC investigation that went to
it.

2215
01:36:07,731 --> 01:36:09,650
So,
so listen to the BBC investigation in

2216
01:36:09,651 --> 01:36:14,150
Britain several years ago revealed that
at least 55% of the Pakistani community

2217
01:36:14,151 --> 01:36:16,280
in Britain was married to a first
cousin.

2218
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:21,050
The Times of India from that in quotes,
this is thought to be linked to

2219
01:36:21,051 --> 01:36:25,010
probability to the probability that a
British Pakistani family,

2220
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:29,990
British Pakistani family is at least 13
times more likely than the general

2221
01:36:29,991 --> 01:36:34,220
population to have children with the
recessive genetic disorders.

2222
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:39,200
Holy Shit.
Bbcs research also discovered that while

2223
01:36:39,201 --> 01:36:44,150
British Pakistanis account for just
3.44% of all births in Britain,

2224
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:49,420
they accounted for 30% of all British
children with recessive disorders and a

2225
01:36:50,271 --> 01:36:55,271
higher rate of infant mortality.
What in the fuck Labour Party MP has

2226
01:36:57,441 --> 01:36:59,330
called for a ban on first cousin
marriage.

2227
01:36:59,331 --> 01:37:02,780
Medical evidence shows that one of the
negative consequences of inbreeding is a

2228
01:37:02,781 --> 01:37:07,781
100% increase in the risk of stillbirth.
One study comparing the Norwegians and

2229
01:37:08,361 --> 01:37:12,260
Pakistan showed that the risk of child
of the child dying during Labor

2230
01:37:12,261 --> 01:37:15,620
increases by 50%.
Wow.

2231
01:37:16,460 --> 01:37:18,770
That is insane.
I also read somewhere that's a lot of

2232
01:37:18,771 --> 01:37:23,771
the symptoms of inbred people are
irrational rage fanaticism and they end

2233
01:37:27,441 --> 01:37:31,220
up just describing isis.
Look at what it says here that um,

2234
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:32,450
with the,
uh,

2235
01:37:32,451 --> 01:37:34,820
the Iq points,
it says findings.

2236
01:37:34,821 --> 01:37:38,750
Unintelligence research shows that if
one parents are cousins,

2237
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:43,310
if one's parents or cousins,
intelligence goes down 10 to 16 Iq

2238
01:37:43,311 --> 01:37:44,060
points.

2239
01:37:44,060 --> 01:37:48,770
The risk of having an Iq lower than 70
criterion for being retarded.

2240
01:37:48,771 --> 01:37:50,720
In quotes,
they using that word,

2241
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:53,420
who uses that word?
They use it like that.

2242
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:55,800
I'm noticing that you use like I've
always done it.

2243
01:37:55,980 --> 01:37:57,510
I don't think it's a medical
distinction.

2244
01:37:57,750 --> 01:38:00,110
This is a real website.
The fuck can we read it from?

2245
01:38:00,770 --> 01:38:02,310
Did they say no?
It says retarded.

2246
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:04,470
Retarded in quotes.
He had a suit.

2247
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:07,590
Their legal,
that is the medical definition increases

2248
01:38:07,591 --> 01:38:11,730
400% among children from cousin
marriages.

2249
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:12,720
Well,
let me say that again.

2250
01:38:12,840 --> 01:38:17,840
The risk of having an Iq lower than 70
increases 400% amongst children from

2251
01:38:20,281 --> 01:38:25,050
cousin marriages.
An academic paper published in the

2252
01:38:25,050 --> 01:38:27,780
Indian National Science Academy found
that the onset of various social

2253
01:38:27,781 --> 01:38:32,760
profiles like visual fixation,
social smile and sound seizures,

2254
01:38:32,761 --> 01:38:37,761
oral expression in hand grasping are
significantly delayed among the newborn

2255
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,270
inbred babies.
What in the fuck could name for a band

2256
01:38:42,660 --> 01:38:43,890
newborn inbred babies?

2257
01:38:43,910 --> 01:38:45,480
Yeah,
that's our punk or band.

2258
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:47,760
I ever heard one.
Wow.

2259
01:38:48,660 --> 01:38:52,020
Jesus Christ.
Then why don't we know this because I've

2260
01:38:52,021 --> 01:38:54,030
never don't like the truth.
Islamophobia.

2261
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:55,660
They don't like being called
Islamophobia,

2262
01:38:55,661 --> 01:38:58,470
but even discussing it like we're going
to be called Islamophobic for even

2263
01:38:58,471 --> 01:39:00,510
bringing this.
I know and I'm glad you read that from a

2264
01:39:00,511 --> 01:39:03,780
reputable site,
so it's not a Joe Rogan and Gavin

2265
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:06,810
McInnes is called Muslims retarded.
This is PJ media.

2266
01:39:06,811 --> 01:39:09,810
I don't know what that is,
but let's find out if there's other

2267
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,840
corroborating or dissenting sources.
Like Pajama media is a,

2268
01:39:15,081 --> 01:39:19,230
a a well established network of
champions or what you wear when you want

2269
01:39:19,231 --> 01:39:24,231
to be serious about problems with Islam.
If you wear your footie pajamas and he

2270
01:39:24,571 --> 01:39:27,990
gets out of the basics,
people are scared of genetics too,

2271
01:39:27,991 --> 01:39:30,270
cause it gets into eugenics and they,
they get uncomfortable,

2272
01:39:30,271 --> 01:39:32,580
but it gets into racism too.

2273
01:39:33,960 --> 01:39:38,440
I come from a Shitty Glaswegian family
and my uncles were drunks and maybe

2274
01:39:38,470 --> 01:39:39,970
coming from a shitty group,
you,

2275
01:39:40,060 --> 01:39:43,590
you develop this immunity to fear of
your group sucking like,

2276
01:39:43,591 --> 01:39:46,950
I don't care what you say about roofs.
I'm battalion mostly Italian.

2277
01:39:46,951 --> 01:39:51,000
I'm one quarter Irish and fucking I came
from a line of savages.

2278
01:39:51,410 --> 01:39:53,070
They're there.
Eight people,

2279
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:56,160
you know,
it was a good percentage of my ancestors

2280
01:39:56,161 --> 01:39:59,930
and relatives that I know that are
fucking ape people and I can say that

2281
01:39:59,931 --> 01:40:03,550
cause I know them and I come from them
and I have eight people instincts that I

2282
01:40:03,551 --> 01:40:05,640
fight off every goddamn day or my life.
Man,

2283
01:40:05,670 --> 01:40:08,610
the first time I came here you were
trying to separate your spinal cord

2284
01:40:08,611 --> 01:40:10,590
cause you had crushed it from choking
people out.

2285
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:14,180
While I'm not trying to separate it,
I'm trying to relax it and uh,

2286
01:40:14,280 --> 01:40:17,790
decompress it.
Some sound like doctor Zay us right now,

2287
01:40:18,810 --> 01:40:19,650
but I've worked,
I did,

2288
01:40:19,651 --> 01:40:20,520
I worked at,
it's great.

2289
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:22,530
Now my back works wonderful.
I stretched out.

2290
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:25,500
My philosophy is I don't care what the
truth is,

2291
01:40:25,501 --> 01:40:27,980
no such thing as hate fax to me.
Let's hear it.

2292
01:40:27,981 --> 01:40:30,870
And I was talking to the facts and they
might be uncomfortable for you,

2293
01:40:31,020 --> 01:40:33,450
but they are facts,
the truth and it's best for everyone.

2294
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,090
Let's talk about this.
A surgeon recently and I,

2295
01:40:36,150 --> 01:40:38,970
he's,
he's trying to accrue a DNA database

2296
01:40:39,510 --> 01:40:42,600
that would just sort of like going into
the singularity,

2297
01:40:42,601 --> 01:40:47,370
it would be like becoming God and you
would be able to tell from a baby if a

2298
01:40:47,371 --> 01:40:50,520
baby is going to have a propensity for
lung cancer and you know right out of

2299
01:40:50,521 --> 01:40:54,340
the gate and he,
he's scared of this concept

2300
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:57,670
because he's worried it will affect
insurance policies.

2301
01:40:57,970 --> 01:41:01,420
They'll demand to see ya a smear some of
your spit and they'll go,

2302
01:41:01,421 --> 01:41:03,050
oh fuck this.
We're not insuring you.

2303
01:41:03,060 --> 01:41:05,360
You,
you have a 40% chance of prostate cancer

2304
01:41:05,361 --> 01:41:08,290
and 50% chance of this,
the point of insurance.

2305
01:41:08,291 --> 01:41:10,780
Cause then insurance gets real weird.
It's not a gamble anymore.

2306
01:41:10,781 --> 01:41:12,100
It's like you could see the car.
It's like,

2307
01:41:12,101 --> 01:41:13,120
let me see your cards.
No,

2308
01:41:13,121 --> 01:41:14,580
I'm not gambling.
Yeah,

2309
01:41:14,581 --> 01:41:15,340
yeah,
yeah.

2310
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:16,870
You know,
now it's just a bank account.

2311
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:18,460
Isn't that kind of what insurance is,
right?

2312
01:41:18,461 --> 01:41:20,110
It's like I look at you,
Hey Gavin,

2313
01:41:20,111 --> 01:41:21,700
let me take your blood pressure.
Well,

2314
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:23,180
uh,
yeah,

2315
01:41:23,181 --> 01:41:24,670
a cough.
Okay,

2316
01:41:24,671 --> 01:41:27,580
let me hit your knee with this little
rubber mallet.

2317
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:29,620
Everything seems okay.
Hey,

2318
01:41:29,621 --> 01:41:31,720
how are you sleeping?
Sleeping pretty good.

2319
01:41:31,750 --> 01:41:32,291
Wow.
Okay.

2320
01:41:32,291 --> 01:41:35,110
I'm going to give you a positive checkup
and you bring it to the insurance

2321
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:35,771
company and go,
look,

2322
01:41:35,771 --> 01:41:36,604
everything checks out.

2323
01:41:36,700 --> 01:41:37,660
You're going to insure me.
They're like,

2324
01:41:37,690 --> 01:41:39,040
hmm.
All right,

2325
01:41:39,041 --> 01:41:41,140
we'll take a chance.
But it is taking a chance.

2326
01:41:41,141 --> 01:41:42,310
But do you smoke?
Oh,

2327
01:41:42,311 --> 01:41:45,190
you smoke.
I don't like my odds there.

2328
01:41:45,310 --> 01:41:47,230
Do Drink.
I don't like my odds.

2329
01:41:47,530 --> 01:41:48,700
Well,
as we're getting smarter,

2330
01:41:48,701 --> 01:41:51,190
we're turning into those,
those chicks in the hot tub,

2331
01:41:51,191 --> 01:41:53,860
in minority report,
and sooner be able to just go,

2332
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:55,560
I can't and chill.
You,

2333
01:41:55,970 --> 01:41:58,990
you're dying on the way home today.
Oh No.

2334
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,160
I say to him,
I go,

2335
01:42:00,161 --> 01:42:01,810
fine.
Let's get it out there.

2336
01:42:01,811 --> 01:42:04,960
The free market will figure out
insurance for the doomed,

2337
01:42:05,240 --> 01:42:07,210
uh,
some sort of catastrophic policy,

2338
01:42:07,211 --> 01:42:09,580
but there'll be more money over here to
even it out.

2339
01:42:10,120 --> 01:42:13,180
Information has to come out.
We need this information.

2340
01:42:13,181 --> 01:42:15,430
But inbreeding,
I think it explains the hijacking of,

2341
01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:16,690
of Muslim religion.
You know,

2342
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:19,270
Hasidic Jews have the same problem,
but they,

2343
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:21,280
because they're aware of this and the
truth is out.

2344
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:24,400
They have all kinds of elaborate DNA
tests.

2345
01:42:24,401 --> 01:42:26,230
They do on each other.
Not everyone takes it,

2346
01:42:26,231 --> 01:42:29,110
but,
but rabbis will encourage this for us to

2347
01:42:29,111 --> 01:42:31,580
check you out and make sure you're not
related and encourage this marriage

2348
01:42:31,581 --> 01:42:34,220
because it makes the most genetic sense.
I had no idea you,

2349
01:42:34,221 --> 01:42:36,500
you blew my mind with that information.
I'm,

2350
01:42:36,501 --> 01:42:39,550
I'm hoping that Jamie's going to pull up
something that shows that that's a right

2351
01:42:39,551 --> 01:42:43,690
wing hate group that's infiltrated this
statistics and there does seem to come

2352
01:42:43,691 --> 01:42:46,180
on a lot of right wing websites.
I'm trying to find more sources,

2353
01:42:46,181 --> 01:42:49,030
but trying to find another source.
So just try to find another source and

2354
01:42:49,330 --> 01:42:51,220
we'll continue to talk about other
genetic things.

2355
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:52,950
Have you,
are you aware of Crispr?

2356
01:42:52,980 --> 01:42:56,200
You know,
that's some crazy shit and they've,

2357
01:42:56,201 --> 01:42:59,350
they've been given the green light to go
ahead and start working on human

2358
01:42:59,351 --> 01:43:00,184
fetuses.

2359
01:43:00,670 --> 01:43:04,330
I actually had this crazy theory in
church the other day where I thought,

2360
01:43:04,780 --> 01:43:07,660
is it possible that we're in heaven?
Like,

2361
01:43:07,661 --> 01:43:11,290
you know how the concept of Heaven is
unfathomable,

2362
01:43:11,350 --> 01:43:13,270
right?
It's something that's totally different

2363
01:43:13,271 --> 01:43:16,480
from where we are now and it's this
infinite universe thing that our brains

2364
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:17,980
can't handle.
And then I was thinking,

2365
01:43:17,981 --> 01:43:20,650
wait a minute,
this sounds like a sperm trying to

2366
01:43:20,651 --> 01:43:22,950
figure out what earth is,
right?

2367
01:43:23,110 --> 01:43:26,680
Maybe the sperm was us being born was
dying.

2368
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:32,400
Now we're alive here on heaven and we're
slowly getting closer and closer to

2369
01:43:32,981 --> 01:43:35,320
perfection.
I mean lifespan has been getting better.

2370
01:43:35,650 --> 01:43:37,180
The quality of life has been getting
better.

2371
01:43:37,330 --> 01:43:41,590
We're going to die soon,
but in like 50 generations with crispers

2372
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:43,420
and all this incredible genetic
information,

2373
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:45,730
soon we might be able to just be like,
we all is.

2374
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:48,890
Usually we have cured your liver
cancers.

2375
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,100
Well it's going to get really weird
because they're kind of be able

2376
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:54,830
to integrate the,
the human beings that are here today

2377
01:43:55,370 --> 01:43:59,270
with not just communication,
not just visual information,

2378
01:43:59,480 --> 01:44:03,380
but some sort of computer language.
Jamie and I were just talking about this

2379
01:44:03,380 --> 01:44:06,950
yesterday where we were talking about
emojis and you know,

2380
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:08,990
and this is something that has been
brought up before.

2381
01:44:09,010 --> 01:44:13,340
The emojis are in many ways a lot like
hieroglyphs and that they,

2382
01:44:13,370 --> 01:44:18,370
you can say something with emojis that
it can kind of translate what you're

2383
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:23,780
thinking without an actual language.
And we're saying we're going to get down

2384
01:44:23,781 --> 01:44:26,630
to,
the only words you say are like yes and

2385
01:44:26,631 --> 01:44:27,500
no.
Like yeah.

2386
01:44:27,501 --> 01:44:32,501
And know like nods and affirmations and
confirmations and the,

2387
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:37,930
the language that we speak could be some
sort of a weird universal emoji based

2388
01:44:38,481 --> 01:44:43,481
language that's just expressed from mind
to mind through some neural implants or

2389
01:44:43,761 --> 01:44:46,220
some fucking snapchat glasses.
We were,

2390
01:44:46,221 --> 01:44:48,080
I mean,
we're not too far away from something

2391
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:50,450
really bizarre and paradigm shifting
like that.

2392
01:44:50,490 --> 01:44:54,440
I remember when downloading your brain
was just science fiction movies and you

2393
01:44:54,441 --> 01:44:56,630
know,
you talk to people our age about their

2394
01:44:56,631 --> 01:45:00,260
dead grandfather and they go,
I have this black and my photo and I

2395
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:04,910
have this letter.
He wrote the newspaper in 1896 that's

2396
01:45:04,911 --> 01:45:08,600
all I got my life.
My kids will never be able to read all

2397
01:45:08,601 --> 01:45:11,270
the articles I've written or watch all
the videos I've done.

2398
01:45:11,271 --> 01:45:12,620
They'll,
they'll never get through them all.

2399
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:15,260
They can watch them for 100 hours if
they're bored.

2400
01:45:15,261 --> 01:45:18,620
But they'll,
there's way more of my brain permanently

2401
01:45:18,621 --> 01:45:20,870
out there in the cosmos than they could
ever want.

2402
01:45:21,020 --> 01:45:23,030
Oh yeah,
for sure is and everything.

2403
01:45:23,870 --> 01:45:27,780
So the next generation,
your dad isn't really going to die and

2404
01:45:27,820 --> 01:45:29,720
just hang out with them whenever you
want.

2405
01:45:29,870 --> 01:45:31,490
Well,
I'm sure you're aware of Ray Kurzwell

2406
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:36,410
and you know Kurzweil's thing is that he
wants to somehow or another recreate his

2407
01:45:36,411 --> 01:45:41,411
father cause his father died when he was
young and he has some information about

2408
01:45:43,491 --> 01:45:48,020
his father and he has some DNA that
obviously is his and he has,

2409
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:51,170
you know,
photographs and memories and he wants to

2410
01:45:51,171 --> 01:45:55,430
figure out a way to literally recreate
his father and have a conversation with

2411
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:57,890
them that I know you,
I know you're an atheist,

2412
01:45:57,891 --> 01:45:58,370
right?

2413
01:45:58,370 --> 01:46:00,740
No.
Oh I am a nothing.

2414
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:02,330
This is,
I feel like,

2415
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,070
you know,
the beginning of atheists where he

2416
01:46:04,071 --> 01:46:06,620
drinks that thing and then he
deteriorates and goes into the water.

2417
01:46:07,070 --> 01:46:10,580
That's what I think the big bang was.
It was this beautiful microchip that

2418
01:46:10,581 --> 01:46:13,040
just started the first domino and
everything else.

2419
01:46:13,041 --> 01:46:17,180
He's going to this place like the
singularity is near this incredible

2420
01:46:17,570 --> 01:46:20,750
perfection that we're headed to.
And there's all these checks and

2421
01:46:20,751 --> 01:46:22,820
balances along the way.
Like I was reading about Audrey Hepburn

2422
01:46:22,821 --> 01:46:25,280
the other day and she,
um,

2423
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:27,860
was super skinny,
right breakfast at tiffany's chick.

2424
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:29,660
She grew up in I think,
uh,

2425
01:46:29,661 --> 01:46:30,560
the,
uh,

2426
01:46:30,590 --> 01:46:35,510
Holland during the war and the Nazis
Cutoff Holland from all supplies.

2427
01:46:35,511 --> 01:46:38,000
So they were forced to eat lips and
they,

2428
01:46:38,150 --> 01:46:40,580
a lot of them,
hundreds of thousands of them starve to

2429
01:46:40,581 --> 01:46:44,180
death.
And Audrey Hepburn was from that world

2430
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:46,760
and she was a skinny chick who didn't
need a lot of food.

2431
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:52,840
And then all of her ancestors kids
became obese,

2432
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:57,450
big giant fat pigs.
And they say it could have been genetic

2433
01:46:57,451 --> 01:47:00,720
memory where they,
their bodies went,

2434
01:47:00,721 --> 01:47:02,490
Holy Shit,
you found Doritos.

2435
01:47:02,910 --> 01:47:05,400
I'm going to hold onto this cause you're
never gonna find one again.

2436
01:47:05,570 --> 01:47:08,160
And then you get an a,
and I'm noticing this in La with all

2437
01:47:08,161 --> 01:47:12,630
these Mexicans I see everywhere,
they seem more obese than the general

2438
01:47:12,631 --> 01:47:15,000
populace.
And I think they have genetic memory

2439
01:47:15,240 --> 01:47:19,020
from a generation or two ago where food
was scarce and they,

2440
01:47:19,080 --> 01:47:21,330
their bodies hold onto it more
thoroughly.

2441
01:47:21,331 --> 01:47:22,920
We see this with the American Indians
all the time.

2442
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:27,150
It's a major diabetes problems send its
genetic memory where these are the

2443
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:30,660
checks and balances your,
you're at the fact that a cell can

2444
01:47:30,661 --> 01:47:34,950
remember this generation is like you
ever heard cell memory where the you get

2445
01:47:34,951 --> 01:47:37,920
an eye transplant and all of a sudden
you're seeing the guy that killed that

2446
01:47:37,921 --> 01:47:38,754
guy.

2447
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:42,390
I've heard stories and out but I don't
know if it's ever been proven and it's

2448
01:47:42,391 --> 01:47:44,640
still in the got to look it up to prefer
my brain.

2449
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:48,210
People getting organ transplants as well
where they have hungers,

2450
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:52,470
like they have a hunger,
a hunger pangs for something that they

2451
01:47:52,471 --> 01:47:54,270
never craved before.
Right?

2452
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:55,950
It's,
it's not,

2453
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:59,370
it's not known as big foot shit.
It is known as as a,

2454
01:47:59,670 --> 01:48:02,670
I think it was on 60 minutes.
But I know genetic memory is a real

2455
01:48:02,671 --> 01:48:06,450
thing and I just see all of this as part
of the bigger picture as we,

2456
01:48:06,650 --> 01:48:08,520
you know,
checking balance ourselves,

2457
01:48:08,940 --> 01:48:11,760
constantly improving.
And the left seems to always deny that,

2458
01:48:11,761 --> 01:48:14,280
that there's this 45 degree line.
Even in the stock market,

2459
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:18,180
if you invested right before the Great
Depression and you had the patience to

2460
01:48:18,181 --> 01:48:19,950
wait 10 years,
you still would have been up.

2461
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:22,650
So all the dips we've had,
it's always been improving,

2462
01:48:22,651 --> 01:48:23,490
improving,
improving,

2463
01:48:23,491 --> 01:48:24,150
improving.

2464
01:48:24,150 --> 01:48:26,160
Yeah.
Well there's definitely some memories

2465
01:48:26,161 --> 01:48:30,780
that are passed on between parents and
children and they're trying to figure

2466
01:48:30,781 --> 01:48:33,510
out exactly what's the mechanism.
But they don't know.

2467
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:36,600
What they do know is that they've done
these studies with mice and it's really

2468
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:39,570
fascinating.
They take mice and they put them in this

2469
01:48:39,571 --> 01:48:42,780
cage that has a floor that they can give
an electric shock to it.

2470
01:48:42,990 --> 01:48:45,550
And then they release a citrus smell,
that nice smell,

2471
01:48:45,551 --> 01:48:47,040
the citrus smell,
and they zap them.

2472
01:48:47,190 --> 01:48:50,940
So these APP their feet.
So then these mice have children.

2473
01:48:50,941 --> 01:48:53,670
The children have never had this
experience before.

2474
01:48:53,970 --> 01:48:58,620
The children are the grow to full size
and then they spray the citrus smell and

2475
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:00,630
they fucking panic.
No Way.

2476
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:03,080
They've never been zapped before,
but they fucking panicked.

2477
01:49:03,081 --> 01:49:04,830
They have an immediate reaction to it.
See,

2478
01:49:04,831 --> 01:49:05,611
when I hear that,
I go,

2479
01:49:05,611 --> 01:49:06,810
how can people not believe in God?

2480
01:49:06,990 --> 01:49:07,471
Does it?
Well,

2481
01:49:07,471 --> 01:49:10,710
I don't know if it's a god thing.
I think it's a learned reaction to

2482
01:49:10,711 --> 01:49:13,950
genetics that passed on from parent to
child.

2483
01:49:13,980 --> 01:49:18,150
That is the reason for instincts.
So reason why we have the rational fee

2484
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:21,330
is magic.
It is kind of mad at me for what is that

2485
01:49:21,331 --> 01:49:22,530
magic?
I mean,

2486
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:24,420
what is,
what is the universe itself?

2487
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:26,850
I mean,
what is the magic that makes you see me?

2488
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:28,830
What does the magic,
but what does God,

2489
01:49:29,070 --> 01:49:34,070
I mean it's a weird limited expression
to to sort of make some sense out of

2490
01:49:35,131 --> 01:49:38,730
something that's beyond our feeble mind
and imagination at this point.

2491
01:49:39,330 --> 01:49:40,980
I don't know.
I don't know if it's necessarily,

2492
01:49:41,010 --> 01:49:43,260
there was an article going around about
a month ago where they said,

2493
01:49:43,261 --> 01:49:46,470
we may all be in the matrix.
This could all be some sort of giant

2494
01:49:46,471 --> 01:49:48,790
experiment and uh,
I go wait.

2495
01:49:48,791 --> 01:49:52,060
It had to have discovered God,
that's what it is.

2496
01:49:52,060 --> 01:49:53,920
It's the matrix.
It's the first domino.

2497
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:57,220
It's the,
the machine about God.

2498
01:49:57,221 --> 01:50:00,220
You're not talking about a guy who lives
in the clouds with a harp trying to get

2499
01:50:00,221 --> 01:50:01,240
a grip on it,
right?

2500
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:03,300
That says drawing a face on the guy.
Like,

2501
01:50:03,301 --> 01:50:05,350
like you think it's a gun?
Wilson and castaway.

2502
01:50:05,351 --> 01:50:07,460
You're just putting a face on a,
on a baseball glove,

2503
01:50:07,690 --> 01:50:09,580
volleyball.
Do you think it's a guy?

2504
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,680
Like what are you guys sure guy?
I don't know.

2505
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:18,490
When you trainee if God,
God is a really fat German guy with a

2506
01:50:20,321 --> 01:50:23,770
dress and he's got a deep voice and he
eats lipstick.

2507
01:50:23,771 --> 01:50:27,910
He's got lipstick all over his teeth.
Man Hands.

2508
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:30,800
He's got a twitch chat all the time.
It's really nice.

2509
01:50:30,850 --> 01:50:35,850
Got Chipped Nail Polish on its toes and
just disgusting feet shoved into some

2510
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:38,040
high heel shoes.
Do you,

2511
01:50:38,130 --> 01:50:40,960
what do you think it's a physical
entity?

2512
01:50:41,650 --> 01:50:46,630
Do you think it's an energy clickable?
I mean our meager of this whole sperm to

2513
01:50:46,631 --> 01:50:51,310
human thing because the only
relationship I can see in front of me,

2514
01:50:51,730 --> 01:50:55,380
uh,
that mimics this is a pilot is kind of

2515
01:50:55,390 --> 01:50:57,660
human being we're the pilot is,
right.

2516
01:50:57,661 --> 01:51:01,120
So if you said to a sperm,
so what is this earth man like?

2517
01:51:01,270 --> 01:51:02,920
Does he wear a tie and the spring we
just go

2518
01:51:06,720 --> 01:51:09,430
that why does the,
those aren't words,

2519
01:51:09,431 --> 01:51:12,540
but it seems to me that like when you
say something as God or you believe,

2520
01:51:12,580 --> 01:51:17,500
you say you believe in God what you are,
you're defining something but you don't

2521
01:51:17,501 --> 01:51:19,720
even know what you're defining
gratitude.

2522
01:51:19,870 --> 01:51:24,550
You go to church and it's just about
reverence and thank God that I'm here

2523
01:51:24,551 --> 01:51:27,370
and I really appreciate it.
That's Latin mass.

2524
01:51:27,371 --> 01:51:32,350
You go to Latin mass and it's just like
[inaudible] like I don't know what

2525
01:51:32,351 --> 01:51:34,120
they're saying,
but I'm in this incredible building.

2526
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,370
It's blown.
I was talking to Milo,

2527
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:38,020
but at once when he was last in New York
and I go,

2528
01:51:38,710 --> 01:51:41,660
it is kind of unusual.
How good to these churches are.

2529
01:51:41,661 --> 01:51:43,890
Like how beautiful there do you feel
like when the,

2530
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:47,020
the the guy that the contractors were
making them like the stained glass,

2531
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:50,470
it was like they're on adderall and they
had this sort of divine intervention and

2532
01:51:50,471 --> 01:51:51,251
they're like,
holy fuck,

2533
01:51:51,251 --> 01:51:53,860
I'm really good today.
I was like,

2534
01:51:53,861 --> 01:51:55,870
I can't leave a weld.
It's carvings turning out.

2535
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:58,150
Have you been,
she's described you've been to Rome.

2536
01:51:58,540 --> 01:52:00,070
Yeah.
Did you go to the Vatican?

2537
01:52:00,850 --> 01:52:01,690
Uh,
yeah.

2538
01:52:01,691 --> 01:52:04,030
I think we went up to the wall.
I can't remember if we went in or not.

2539
01:52:04,060 --> 01:52:05,320
Oh God man.
You got it.

2540
01:52:05,321 --> 01:52:09,160
You want to talk about something that'll
blow your mind as far as like the

2541
01:52:09,161 --> 01:52:14,161
religious undertones and the majestic
magnificence of its construction.

2542
01:52:15,340 --> 01:52:18,550
St Peter's Basilica.
I mean I,

2543
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:20,620
the,
the whole Vatican is incredible.

2544
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:22,570
The artwork is just amazing.
I mean,

2545
01:52:22,571 --> 01:52:24,590
were there for hours and hours wandering
around.

2546
01:52:24,620 --> 01:52:27,980
We had this really cool professor we
hired as a guide.

2547
01:52:27,981 --> 01:52:30,370
It was amazing.
He told us all the history of

2548
01:52:30,371 --> 01:52:32,590
everything.
But when you get to St Peter's basilica

2549
01:52:32,591 --> 01:52:35,590
and he was explaining how many hundreds
of years it took to build and they're

2550
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:38,740
building all this shit with no
electricity,

2551
01:52:38,741 --> 01:52:40,360
no machines,
no nothing.

2552
01:52:40,361 --> 01:52:42,790
Everything is massive and perfect and
beautiful.

2553
01:52:42,791 --> 01:52:47,791
It's like you're looking at such an
incredible work of art that's designed

2554
01:52:48,891 --> 01:52:53,891
to inspire awe and reverence and the
motivation behind building something

2555
01:52:54,141 --> 01:52:56,320
like this fucking hundreds of years ago.
It's,

2556
01:52:56,660 --> 01:52:58,970
it's really,
I think it's gratitude and you see this

2557
01:52:58,971 --> 01:53:01,820
with my wife's American Indian and at
all those ceremonies.

2558
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:03,770
It's a,
we give things to the north.

2559
01:53:03,771 --> 01:53:05,060
Yeah.
We give thanks to the West.

2560
01:53:05,060 --> 01:53:07,610
We give thanks to the east and that's
what church is.

2561
01:53:07,611 --> 01:53:09,530
It's just like,
I don't know the details,

2562
01:53:09,830 --> 01:53:12,320
but thank you for that.
While my hands work,

2563
01:53:12,321 --> 01:53:15,050
thank you so much for this.
Let's pray for other people.

2564
01:53:15,140 --> 01:53:18,830
I think that's a great way to live.
Life is living life with gratitude and I

2565
01:53:18,831 --> 01:53:22,130
try to be thankful all the time.
I'm a very lucky person and I've always

2566
01:53:22,131 --> 01:53:25,190
been very lucky and I'm always very
thankful to and I try to be very

2567
01:53:25,191 --> 01:53:26,960
generous.
I tried to be very thankful,

2568
01:53:26,970 --> 01:53:30,860
try to be friendly as much as I can and
all those things I think sort of build

2569
01:53:30,861 --> 01:53:34,640
onto it,
but to have it and define it and to put

2570
01:53:34,641 --> 01:53:38,680
it into like a religion,
that's where things can get awry because

2571
01:53:38,700 --> 01:53:41,000
they can,
they can get screwy when you're sort of

2572
01:53:41,001 --> 01:53:44,300
defining things by this ancient set of
rules.

2573
01:53:44,300 --> 01:53:47,300
That was sort of established before we
really understood science before we

2574
01:53:47,301 --> 01:53:48,980
really understood,
uh,

2575
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:51,410
the,
the laws of thermodynamics,

2576
01:53:51,411 --> 01:53:54,800
the way the universe is formed,
what we know now about the cosmos,

2577
01:53:54,801 --> 01:53:57,710
it's just,
there's so many variables that have to

2578
01:53:57,711 --> 01:54:00,950
be taken into account when you're
looking at an entire system,

2579
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:05,360
when you're trying to define what,
what God is and what religion is,

2580
01:54:05,480 --> 01:54:09,560
and then you look at how restrictive
religion has been in the past and how

2581
01:54:09,561 --> 01:54:14,561
many people have suffered because the
discoveries that they had didn't jive

2582
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:18,540
with the ancient texts.
He mean like Galileo and sure.

2583
01:54:18,590 --> 01:54:23,090
All that stuff I guess.
I mean the Catholic Church was,

2584
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:26,810
is very pro science and has been pro
science for a long time.

2585
01:54:26,811 --> 01:54:29,540
So as the Islamic church for the longest
time,

2586
01:54:29,541 --> 01:54:32,810
Islam was like the foundation of science
and the foundation of literature.

2587
01:54:32,811 --> 01:54:33,920
Like before,
you know,

2588
01:54:33,930 --> 01:54:37,400
like the,
before Gaviscon came riding into Iraq

2589
01:54:37,401 --> 01:54:41,510
and fucked up uh,
Baghdad and turned the river red with

2590
01:54:41,511 --> 01:54:46,280
blood and black with ink as they said,
like they were some of the best scholars

2591
01:54:46,281 --> 01:54:46,820
in the world.

2592
01:54:46,820 --> 01:54:48,560
It was like some of the best
mathematics,

2593
01:54:48,561 --> 01:54:49,490
some of the,
the,

2594
01:54:49,510 --> 01:54:50,810
the,
the best writing.

2595
01:54:50,830 --> 01:54:54,860
It had come out of the Islamic world and
they had been conquered and destroyed.

2596
01:54:54,861 --> 01:54:56,750
And so much of that was lost.
And you know,

2597
01:54:56,751 --> 01:55:01,370
the ebb and flow of these cultures to us
seems like such a long time to go from

2598
01:55:01,371 --> 01:55:06,320
1200 to 2017 but in the course of
humanity,

2599
01:55:06,321 --> 01:55:08,360
it's a blip.
It's a nothing.

2600
01:55:08,390 --> 01:55:10,490
Maybe they're right.
Maybe gays should be thrown off

2601
01:55:10,491 --> 01:55:12,290
buildings to pick scientifically proved
it.

2602
01:55:12,670 --> 01:55:15,410
Maybe a lot of these rape victims are
bitches that it should have stones

2603
01:55:15,411 --> 01:55:17,900
thrown in the fall.
Just kidding.

2604
01:55:17,901 --> 01:55:19,640
Internet,
you can't kid,

2605
01:55:19,641 --> 01:55:21,730
man.
There's certain things you can't kit

2606
01:55:21,731 --> 01:55:23,840
about Gavin.
You know what it has allowed,

2607
01:55:24,230 --> 01:55:28,760
thinking about the whole Catholic versus
Protestant things goes back to,

2608
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:32,030
uh,
the ultimate core of all arguments,

2609
01:55:32,210 --> 01:55:33,710
which is nature versus nurture.

2610
01:55:34,160 --> 01:55:37,880
And the Catholics say some people are
better than others.

2611
01:55:38,030 --> 01:55:42,080
Some people are special.
The Protestants say we're all the same.

2612
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:44,280
Uh,
that guy,

2613
01:55:44,310 --> 01:55:46,200
the guy up there on that pedestal isn't
better.

2614
01:55:46,380 --> 01:55:48,870
And I vacillate myself like you for
example,

2615
01:55:49,830 --> 01:55:52,320
are you special?
Are you magic?

2616
01:55:52,410 --> 01:55:57,000
Are you blessed?
Like you're on that show why your career

2617
01:55:57,001 --> 01:55:59,670
has been so weird.
It seems like every time you get thrown

2618
01:55:59,671 --> 01:56:02,070
out of a plane,
we come back a few days later and you've

2619
01:56:02,071 --> 01:56:04,260
got a coconut stand and you're wearing a
grass skirt and you're like,

2620
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,123
hi,
come on in.

2621
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:07,380
These are where everyone sits for their,
uh,

2622
01:56:07,560 --> 01:56:09,720
their coconut juice.
Um,

2623
01:56:12,570 --> 01:56:16,950
and maybe you were kind of the Jew.
Judaism seems to say that you're a

2624
01:56:16,951 --> 01:56:19,800
chosen one.
That there's some people who are picked

2625
01:56:19,801 --> 01:56:22,170
by God,
like that Davinci code thing with Tom

2626
01:56:22,170 --> 01:56:24,980
Hanks where some people are just way
better than others.

2627
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:26,640
Like I was having dinner with Sean
Lennon,

2628
01:56:26,641 --> 01:56:27,840
but you got to get them on the shelf.
Yeah.

2629
01:56:27,841 --> 01:56:29,850
You were telling me one of the most
interesting guys I've ever met in my

2630
01:56:29,851 --> 01:56:31,200
life,
but he was,

2631
01:56:31,201 --> 01:56:34,730
he's a mason.
Him and Vincent Gallo are masons and

2632
01:56:34,770 --> 01:56:36,750
during one of his Doo Hickey's hope he
doesn't mind me telling this,

2633
01:56:37,020 --> 01:56:39,640
but there were these like it's so no
snow to roll.

2634
01:56:39,720 --> 01:56:42,030
Two guys,
they're looking through like a wood

2635
01:56:42,031 --> 01:56:44,880
thing and they invited him to the heavy
shit.

2636
01:56:44,881 --> 01:56:49,320
One that's like made a golden is through
a book where you go upside down and you

2637
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:53,040
have to swim there and you've come out
of your workload and your hold like a

2638
01:56:53,041 --> 01:56:55,590
diamond sword or something.
I'm just making that up.

2639
01:56:55,591 --> 01:56:57,690
Right.
I'm super fancy one and he's like,

2640
01:56:57,691 --> 01:56:59,850
I didn't do it because that's not me.
I don't feel like doing that.

2641
01:56:59,851 --> 01:57:01,140
I'm not going to go to the fancy one.

2642
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:04,560
I want to be with my boys and I was
thinking later you have a,

2643
01:57:04,561 --> 01:57:09,000
maybe you are that Ans Davinci code
guys.

2644
01:57:09,240 --> 01:57:12,990
Well this is my take on it.
I think there's definitely nature and

2645
01:57:12,991 --> 01:57:15,720
there's definitely nurture.
I think both are factors and to go

2646
01:57:15,721 --> 01:57:18,030
nature versus nurture to me seems
simple.

2647
01:57:18,060 --> 01:57:20,220
Simple.
It seems too simplistic.

2648
01:57:20,221 --> 01:57:23,130
It seems too silly because it seems to
me like your,

2649
01:57:23,190 --> 01:57:27,480
you're trying to pick a side.
We're clearly both have massive amounts

2650
01:57:27,481 --> 01:57:29,280
of animal.
It comes down to percentages and I think

2651
01:57:29,281 --> 01:57:31,040
they've discovered the frontal lobe
where it,

2652
01:57:31,041 --> 01:57:35,070
everything matters is 80 nature,
20 nurture.

2653
01:57:35,310 --> 01:57:37,500
And we see this with identical twins
separated at birth.

2654
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:39,140
One grew up rich and Paris.
Yeah.

2655
01:57:39,141 --> 01:57:42,090
There was poor in Detroit.
Similar dogs.

2656
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:44,070
Husbands looked the same.
Same car.

2657
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:47,370
One does film critic critiques.
The other makes movies.

2658
01:57:47,371 --> 01:57:50,400
She's aligned producer.
They are basically the same person.

2659
01:57:50,760 --> 01:57:53,550
Hmm.
Well there's definitely gifts,

2660
01:57:53,551 --> 01:57:55,530
right?
Some people are intellectually gifted

2661
01:57:55,690 --> 01:57:57,870
when we know people that are just really
fucking smart.

2662
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,540
They're just born really fucking smart.
They're smarter than me.

2663
01:58:00,541 --> 01:58:01,351
I talked to him.
I go,

2664
01:58:01,351 --> 01:58:02,390
Jesus.
Yeah.

2665
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:05,190
And then there's other people that are
athletically gifted like Michael Jordan.

2666
01:58:05,400 --> 01:58:06,860
Like you can't,
like there's not,

2667
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:10,890
there's not a chance in hell like a take
a Jonah Hill.

2668
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:15,930
Jonah Hill could work every day.
All Day for the rest of his fucking

2669
01:58:15,931 --> 01:58:17,520
life.
He's never going to play basketball like

2670
01:58:17,521 --> 01:58:20,820
Michael Jordan.
It is impossible if Michael Jordan never

2671
01:58:20,821 --> 01:58:23,460
worked out ever,
like never,

2672
01:58:23,610 --> 01:58:26,880
like literally just kind of did normal
stuff like everybody else does.

2673
01:58:26,881 --> 01:58:28,260
Like man,
went to the gym,

2674
01:58:28,350 --> 01:58:31,410
took a spin class,
he could probably jump way fucking

2675
01:58:31,411 --> 01:58:34,260
higher than Jonah Hill.
He could probably run way faster than

2676
01:58:34,261 --> 01:58:37,770
Jonah Hill and he probably would be
better at anything he applied himself to

2677
01:58:37,860 --> 01:58:40,590
athletically because he's got a gift.

2678
01:58:40,740 --> 01:58:43,540
He's get clearly genetically gifted.
You know?

2679
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:45,550
Uh,
I think the same could be said of Karl

2680
01:58:45,550 --> 01:58:47,230
Malone.
Same could be said of Mike Tyson.

2681
01:58:47,440 --> 01:58:50,560
The same could be said of a,
a bunch of great athletes.

2682
01:58:50,620 --> 01:58:52,480
Um,
the same could be said of Brock Lesnar.

2683
01:58:52,690 --> 01:58:54,250
They didn't,
no matter what you do,

2684
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:55,930
you can lift weights all your fucking
life.

2685
01:58:55,990 --> 01:59:00,070
You're never going to be as strong as
that guy who was the mountain drew thorn

2686
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,170
was named,
can be Orson or whatever the fuck his

2687
01:59:02,171 --> 01:59:04,600
name is.
That gigantic mountain dew guy from game

2688
01:59:04,601 --> 01:59:06,320
of thrones.
Like that's a gift,

2689
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:09,940
man.
That guy's gifted 100% and I'm glad you

2690
01:59:09,941 --> 01:59:13,390
use sports as an analogy because the
general understanding is there's this

2691
01:59:13,391 --> 01:59:18,100
sort of line and it's a gray area and
there's a guy who can throw a softball,

2692
01:59:18,150 --> 01:59:22,330
a fast ball at 10 miles an hour or 20
miles an hour and it goes up to 100 and

2693
01:59:22,331 --> 01:59:26,170
then there's a guy who can do 99 98 but
I don't think it works like that with

2694
01:59:26,171 --> 01:59:26,530
baseball.

2695
01:59:26,530 --> 01:59:30,370
I think there's like the 40 miles an
hour people and then there's this

2696
01:59:30,371 --> 01:59:35,371
floating bubble of the hundred mile an
hour pitchers and these guys are magic.

2697
01:59:35,441 --> 01:59:37,450
They are very special.
They're the Davinci code.

2698
01:59:37,930 --> 01:59:41,890
Children of Jesus.
Well in fight and fighting in striking

2699
01:59:41,891 --> 01:59:43,750
in particular,
there is,

2700
01:59:43,870 --> 01:59:45,580
well there it exists in grappling as
well.

2701
01:59:45,581 --> 01:59:47,740
There's strength and grappling that's
like there's some people who have just

2702
01:59:47,741 --> 01:59:49,870
freak strength,
but I believe that that could be

2703
01:59:49,871 --> 01:59:54,430
nurtured more than striking strength
people when people are good hitters

2704
01:59:54,460 --> 01:59:58,030
Stryker's like a guys who are power
punchers empower power kickers.

2705
01:59:58,540 --> 02:00:00,400
There's only so much you can teach
someone.

2706
02:00:00,460 --> 02:00:01,990
You could teach someone proper
technique,

2707
02:00:02,230 --> 02:00:06,820
but power is something that's just given
to you by the great beyond and no one

2708
02:00:06,821 --> 02:00:09,190
understands it.
No one knows why you could take two

2709
02:00:09,191 --> 02:00:12,400
guys.
One of them looks exactly like the other

2710
02:00:12,401 --> 02:00:13,810
one.
They're built the same.

2711
02:00:13,930 --> 02:00:17,560
They're both have big muscles.
They both have big hands and one of them

2712
02:00:17,561 --> 02:00:21,490
can punch a hole through the fucking
universe and the other one could barely

2713
02:00:21,491 --> 02:00:24,670
make the bag move.
It doesn't make any sense and no one

2714
02:00:24,671 --> 02:00:28,030
knows why you could take someone in
their body looks completely

2715
02:00:28,031 --> 02:00:29,920
unimpressive,
but when they hit people,

2716
02:00:29,921 --> 02:00:32,350
people just go flat and no one knows
why.

2717
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:32,981
Well,
no,

2718
02:00:32,981 --> 02:00:36,310
I don't believe transfer that hard truth
to intellect.

2719
02:00:36,550 --> 02:00:38,620
Yes,
there's this myth that we all need to be

2720
02:00:38,621 --> 02:00:39,940
educated.
We all have to go to college.

2721
02:00:39,970 --> 02:00:44,320
When my dad was young and Britain,
you did your old levels at 13 and my dad

2722
02:00:44,321 --> 02:00:45,760
had a high Iq.
His brothers didn't.

2723
02:00:45,850 --> 02:00:49,810
So they sifted through just like a pink
floyd video and they sifted him over to

2724
02:00:49,811 --> 02:00:52,670
a scholarship and private school and
they sit at his brother's over to work

2725
02:00:52,671 --> 02:00:53,504
in a printing press.

2726
02:00:53,650 --> 02:00:57,430
And they all did fine.
They had good jobs and they were,

2727
02:00:57,490 --> 02:01:01,000
they were taking advantage of their
skills and then we came with this idea

2728
02:01:01,001 --> 02:01:04,840
where everyone had to go to college and
now to lower the bar so everyone can get

2729
02:01:04,841 --> 02:01:06,820
in.
We have all these retarded classes.

2730
02:01:06,850 --> 02:01:10,390
There's a class at Nyu called 20
something where it's just about being 20

2731
02:01:10,391 --> 02:01:13,480
something
done.

2732
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:17,770
Everyone there is 20 something and you
go now you've just wasted your time by

2733
02:01:17,771 --> 02:01:21,160
not admitting that some people are
special and that's what I was getting at

2734
02:01:21,161 --> 02:01:23,860
earlier with the Western culture thing.
Some cultures are better,

2735
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:27,910
some are more advanced.
There might be a satellite of people

2736
02:01:27,911 --> 02:01:29,380
that are just magical.
Like Jimmy Kimmel.

2737
02:01:29,620 --> 02:01:33,550
He kept having his career shadowing when
he was in sports radio.

2738
02:01:33,551 --> 02:01:36,040
We had this woman above him was out to
sabotage him.

2739
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:37,690
He got sent down the shitter.

2740
02:01:37,720 --> 02:01:38,790
Yeah.
What it was.

2741
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:40,280
I heard that story.
What was that about?

2742
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:43,790
Asking him about it?
Some horrible con that tortured him

2743
02:01:43,791 --> 02:01:45,500
every day and producer or something.
Yeah.

2744
02:01:46,190 --> 02:01:48,080
Wow.
He's so talented though.

2745
02:01:48,200 --> 02:01:49,490
Well,
that's why I said that's what I'm

2746
02:01:49,491 --> 02:01:51,200
saying.
Like Michael Jordan,

2747
02:01:51,201 --> 02:01:53,390
you throw them in Africa and there would
be,

2748
02:01:53,391 --> 02:01:55,820
there'd be like,
you'll have to meet this man who is in

2749
02:01:55,821 --> 02:01:58,050
the Congo.
He got jump on Minnie and miles.

2750
02:01:59,120 --> 02:02:03,860
His name is Juju or Jordan and he has
like a leather basketball and I don't

2751
02:02:03,861 --> 02:02:05,390
know what it is.
I am so good at this.

2752
02:02:05,420 --> 02:02:09,470
He would be flown over like Jeremy Lin
or whatever and I think Jimmy Kimmel and

2753
02:02:09,471 --> 02:02:10,760
you are the same.
They just,

2754
02:02:10,970 --> 02:02:12,650
they get fucked over.
I've done it a million times.

2755
02:02:12,651 --> 02:02:15,950
I've thrown my career down the toilet
and then I just keep flying through the

2756
02:02:15,951 --> 02:02:18,470
sewers and pup.
I come out of another man hole.

2757
02:02:18,620 --> 02:02:23,620
Well you figured out a way now
particularly with your show to let your

2758
02:02:23,781 --> 02:02:28,040
personality shine through like to like
your unique way of looking at things.

2759
02:02:28,041 --> 02:02:32,710
Very thorough examination of the world
around you in an honest take on and that

2760
02:02:32,730 --> 02:02:35,030
also happens to be humorous.
But I did that with advertising.

2761
02:02:35,031 --> 02:02:37,960
I got involved in advertising
advertising agency.

2762
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:42,100
He sold it for millions.
Then we got fired cause I said shitty

2763
02:02:42,110 --> 02:02:45,970
stuff about trainees.
I pointed out they're mentally ill gaze.

2764
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:48,230
Well,
what you pointed out was that there's a

2765
02:02:48,231 --> 02:02:52,250
lot of regret and that was where people
were getting really uncomfortable.

2766
02:02:52,370 --> 02:02:54,380
And there's,
there's a website,

2767
02:02:54,381 --> 02:02:59,381
I think it's called trends,
gender regret.com and there you cannot

2768
02:02:59,871 --> 02:03:04,430
tell me that any sort of major surgery
doesn't carry some sort of regret.

2769
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:07,100
When I was in my twenties I had hair
transplants.

2770
02:03:07,101 --> 02:03:09,020
I have a big scar on the back of my
head.

2771
02:03:09,020 --> 02:03:10,340
You see that?
Oh yeah.

2772
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,090
That's because they take a piece of meat
or the back of your head with hair on

2773
02:03:14,091 --> 02:03:16,040
it.
Because my hair was falling out and I

2774
02:03:16,041 --> 02:03:17,870
was on TV and I was like,
fuck,

2775
02:03:18,020 --> 02:03:19,970
if my looks go,
I'm going to be poor again.

2776
02:03:19,971 --> 02:03:21,950
I'm fucked.
I'm losing my screen's radio.

2777
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:22,843
Yeah.
Yeah.

2778
02:03:22,880 --> 02:03:26,120
And so a while we were on hiatus,
I had hair transplants.

2779
02:03:26,121 --> 02:03:29,510
They take a piece of meat back here with
take the hair and they move it all up in

2780
02:03:29,511 --> 02:03:30,680
here.
And the way I just,

2781
02:03:30,770 --> 02:03:32,840
you know,
it doesn't work because eventually the

2782
02:03:32,841 --> 02:03:35,420
other hair falls out and it's just,
you left with this mess.

2783
02:03:35,780 --> 02:03:37,520
But yeah,
I regretted it.

2784
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:42,820
It was a stupid thing to do and people
make irrational choices that can become

2785
02:03:43,131 --> 02:03:47,330
permanent and if you don't think that
some people who decide that they would

2786
02:03:47,331 --> 02:03:51,620
be happier as a woman and then become a
woman and then are miserable because

2787
02:03:51,621 --> 02:03:53,780
first of all,
their hormonal profile has changed.

2788
02:03:53,900 --> 02:03:56,690
They don't have a penis anymore.
They don't have their testicles anymore.

2789
02:03:56,780 --> 02:03:58,520
They wish they could go back to where
they were.

2790
02:03:58,580 --> 02:04:01,850
You don't think that that's possible,
that those people who have major surgery

2791
02:04:01,851 --> 02:04:06,320
could also possibly have major regret.
That is debt is dishonest,

2792
02:04:06,530 --> 02:04:11,530
it's disingenuous and you are,
you are adhering to an ideology rather

2793
02:04:12,561 --> 02:04:17,130
than looking at something in a
completely objective and and,

2794
02:04:17,131 --> 02:04:19,130
and open and honest way.
You're,

2795
02:04:19,131 --> 02:04:23,360
you're using these people as pawns for
your own virtue signaling and it's

2796
02:04:23,361 --> 02:04:25,310
murder.
It's like when you see toddlers,

2797
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:28,160
like at that woman's March,
they had these toddlers thing with my

2798
02:04:28,161 --> 02:04:30,740
pussy grabs back and you're looking at a
three year old and you're going,

2799
02:04:30,950 --> 02:04:32,330
Jesus Christ,
that's child abuse.

2800
02:04:32,480 --> 02:04:35,690
And I feel like the,
these liberals are doing tranny abuse by

2801
02:04:35,691 --> 02:04:39,810
normalizing such a drastic decision.
And it inevitably,

2802
02:04:39,811 --> 02:04:41,010
I know this is the guy you're talking
about.

2803
02:04:41,010 --> 02:04:43,890
He's rights for the federalist all the
time and he goes,

2804
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:46,410
what happens with these people as they
have all these problems?

2805
02:04:46,590 --> 02:04:47,640
Clearly you're not sick,
you think,

2806
02:04:47,641 --> 02:04:50,110
or a woman,
but they also have bipolar and

2807
02:04:50,130 --> 02:04:52,350
schizophrenia and manic depression and
all these other things.

2808
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:54,120
They go,
if I could just get rid of my cock and

2809
02:04:54,121 --> 02:04:55,650
be a woman,
it would be fine.

2810
02:04:55,651 --> 02:04:58,050
Then they do that and for a month
they're happy and then they realize,

2811
02:04:58,051 --> 02:04:59,550
wait,
the bipolar is still here.

2812
02:04:59,970 --> 02:05:02,160
I'm still depressed.
What the fuck have I done?

2813
02:05:02,190 --> 02:05:04,710
Holy Shit.
This isn't the cure all solution.

2814
02:05:04,830 --> 02:05:06,840
Not only that,
there's also this,

2815
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:10,530
there's a real problem and that you're
not allowed to bring that up.

2816
02:05:10,770 --> 02:05:13,860
Like we know when you look at the,
the the average person,

2817
02:05:13,861 --> 02:05:15,780
whether they're gay or straight,
the average people,

2818
02:05:15,781 --> 02:05:18,180
men and women out there in the world,
there's a certain amount that are going

2819
02:05:18,181 --> 02:05:19,014
to be schizophrenia.

2820
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:21,960
There's a certain amount that are going
to have all sorts of mental illnesses,

2821
02:05:21,961 --> 02:05:23,190
depression,
et cetera.

2822
02:05:23,400 --> 02:05:26,640
There's a certain amount.
When you start talking about transgender

2823
02:05:26,641 --> 02:05:29,940
people,
you are no longer allowed to take that

2824
02:05:29,941 --> 02:05:33,960
into consideration and you must treat
every transgender person is if there are

2825
02:05:33,961 --> 02:05:38,610
100% mentally healthy,
which is insanely rare in regular

2826
02:05:38,611 --> 02:05:40,920
people,
people that are not transgender,

2827
02:05:41,040 --> 02:05:42,360
cisgendered.
If you were,

2828
02:05:42,590 --> 02:05:44,490
when you use that term,
you look at this gender.

2829
02:05:44,640 --> 02:05:46,710
That's what I sent him,
that article that got me and shit.

2830
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:48,060
I go,
let's get the shit here.

2831
02:05:48,061 --> 02:05:50,670
Okay,
you're looking at what's his name and

2832
02:05:50,671 --> 02:05:53,970
transparent Jeremy,
whatever his name is,

2833
02:05:54,150 --> 02:05:55,230
the actor.
Sorry,

2834
02:05:55,530 --> 02:05:56,880
when does that,
what is his name?

2835
02:05:56,910 --> 02:06:00,150
What does,
the guy was [inaudible] board and you're

2836
02:06:00,151 --> 02:06:02,760
supposed to look at them and go,
you know that's an interesting struggle

2837
02:06:02,761 --> 02:06:04,740
you're going through.
It's Mrs doubtfire.

2838
02:06:05,040 --> 02:06:06,510
I can't not laugh when I look at you.

2839
02:06:06,510 --> 02:06:10,290
It's comical and everyone just has this
willful ignorance.

2840
02:06:10,291 --> 02:06:14,670
Like I saw Laverne Cox on some dumb day
today show type thing at the hotel

2841
02:06:14,671 --> 02:06:17,730
earlier and he's sitting there with his
legs crossed going,

2842
02:06:17,910 --> 02:06:20,340
you want to tell the mcbeal?
And so then I was so nervous,

2843
02:06:20,341 --> 02:06:23,010
like didn't even slow,
still suck my stomach in.

2844
02:06:23,011 --> 02:06:25,230
And you're like,
are we all pretending that you're not a

2845
02:06:25,231 --> 02:06:26,140
dude?
Who is the,

2846
02:06:26,141 --> 02:06:30,870
who is Laverne Cox was on that show?
A orange is the new black.

2847
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:32,910
I never watched that.
No,

2848
02:06:32,911 --> 02:06:34,830
me neither.
But he's a famous Janet mock.

2849
02:06:34,831 --> 02:06:36,990
There's Laverne Cox.
They're all the top ones.

2850
02:06:37,270 --> 02:06:39,030
It Caitlyn Jenner.
And whenever you see them,

2851
02:06:39,031 --> 02:06:40,500
you go,
you're a dude.

2852
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:41,900
Uh,
but a shirt.

2853
02:06:41,910 --> 02:06:43,440
I'll sit here and clap and go like,
yes,

2854
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:45,180
you're gorgeous.
Oh my God.

2855
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,430
That is a problem.
It's,

2856
02:06:46,431 --> 02:06:47,264
it's,
this is,

2857
02:06:47,280 --> 02:06:48,810
that's a guy.
Yeah.

2858
02:06:48,811 --> 02:06:50,100
Wow.
That's a huge guy.

2859
02:06:50,220 --> 02:06:52,290
Is that he a giant.
Really?

2860
02:06:52,350 --> 02:06:55,380
Yeah.
And not a guy anymore.

2861
02:06:55,381 --> 02:06:56,970
How long has she been a girl?
I don't know.

2862
02:06:56,971 --> 02:06:58,800
You never get the straight answer from
these people.

2863
02:06:58,860 --> 02:07:01,980
I think he has some pussy out of,
of chopping their dick off she goes.

2864
02:07:02,130 --> 02:07:03,780
He thinks well Caitlyn did,
right?

2865
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:04,920
I don't think so.
No.

2866
02:07:05,130 --> 02:07:06,210
Oh yeah.
Katelyn didn't,

2867
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,250
I mean did pussy out of it.
Yeah.

2868
02:07:08,290 --> 02:07:09,300
Yeah.
You get it done.

2869
02:07:09,930 --> 02:07:11,310
There you go.
You go girl.

2870
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:13,660
It's a 10.
If there be,

2871
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:18,510
if there comes a time where through
crispr or some other new fangled genetic

2872
02:07:18,511 --> 02:07:21,450
manipulation,
you can turn a man to a woman and then

2873
02:07:21,451 --> 02:07:24,270
back and forth and you really can be
gender fluid.

2874
02:07:24,570 --> 02:07:27,900
Like there's a,
there's an instagram page about gender

2875
02:07:27,901 --> 02:07:29,640
fluidity and one of the things it's
like,

2876
02:07:29,641 --> 02:07:30,630
I'm not a man.
I'm not.

2877
02:07:30,690 --> 02:07:32,790
Sometimes I'm a man,
sometimes I'm a woman,

2878
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:36,310
but I'm always a human like,
okay,

2879
02:07:36,610 --> 02:07:37,270
you know,
like,

2880
02:07:37,270 --> 02:07:38,860
I don't know,
it may be here.

2881
02:07:38,890 --> 02:07:40,600
That's another thing about I'm not a
homophobe,

2882
02:07:40,601 --> 02:07:43,270
I'm a homo board.
I don't care who you fuck.

2883
02:07:43,870 --> 02:07:45,940
Like when you make out in front of my
building,

2884
02:07:46,380 --> 02:07:50,140
have a nice French session.
I don't fucking give a shit with Milo.

2885
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:52,570
And you see that,
I see that sometimes it's black and

2886
02:07:52,571 --> 02:07:54,700
white couples.
Like in New York there'll be walking the

2887
02:07:54,701 --> 02:07:56,560
chain holding hands and looking
indignant.

2888
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:57,341
You know,
high,

2889
02:07:57,341 --> 02:07:58,600
we're in love.
Got a problem with that.

2890
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,540
Oh congratulations.
You're fucking someone you're attracted

2891
02:08:01,541 --> 02:08:05,890
to ooze.
We to go up there and blow minds,

2892
02:08:07,510 --> 02:08:12,510
you're sucking your boyfriend's Dick.
I'm stunned and I think that's why they

2893
02:08:12,641 --> 02:08:14,020
get so mad too,
is I go,

2894
02:08:14,021 --> 02:08:16,840
you're not a snowflake.
You're not transgendered.

2895
02:08:16,841 --> 02:08:18,880
You're just a fucking dude.
Well,

2896
02:08:19,180 --> 02:08:24,180
when time moves on and once,
we really do eliminate all the things

2897
02:08:26,141 --> 02:08:29,590
that trouble us when it comes down to
homophobia or racism,

2898
02:08:29,980 --> 02:08:32,800
all these issues that they're really
still do exist.

2899
02:08:32,920 --> 02:08:35,890
You're going to be left with the actual
human beings themselves.

2900
02:08:36,070 --> 02:08:39,520
So when no one is transphobic,
when no one's homophobic and no one's

2901
02:08:39,521 --> 02:08:42,010
racist,
they can judge you for who you are.

2902
02:08:42,160 --> 02:08:45,100
We're there,
but we're not in a lot of ways because

2903
02:08:45,101 --> 02:08:48,430
people get free passes if they are
transgender.

2904
02:08:48,520 --> 02:08:51,220
If they're gay,
like a guy like Caitlyn Jenner saying

2905
02:08:51,221 --> 02:08:53,110
that he's,
he doesn't support gay marriage like

2906
02:08:53,290 --> 02:08:55,690
that.
You get a fucking free pass like you're

2907
02:08:55,691 --> 02:08:58,600
getting a free pass you,
but here's the best free pass.

2908
02:08:58,601 --> 02:08:59,530
The caitlyn Jenner,
God,

2909
02:09:00,070 --> 02:09:04,210
she fucking killed a person.
She slammed her car and it's some lady

2910
02:09:04,211 --> 02:09:07,750
because she wasn't paying attention,
slammed her fucking escalate and pushed

2911
02:09:07,751 --> 02:09:12,100
her in at oncoming traffic and the lady
died and no one brings it up.

2912
02:09:12,250 --> 02:09:16,960
That's the freest,
free pass of all took a life by

2913
02:09:17,050 --> 02:09:21,520
completely being negligent.
And that's the problem with this bigotry

2914
02:09:21,521 --> 02:09:22,450
of low expectations.

2915
02:09:22,450 --> 02:09:25,180
You put these people on a pedestal until
they can do no wrong.

2916
02:09:25,181 --> 02:09:27,640
And they ended up doing wrong.
I mean that hadn't been Milo to,

2917
02:09:27,820 --> 02:09:30,160
he had to get out of jail free card.
He could say whatever he wants and the

2918
02:09:30,161 --> 02:09:32,980
next thing you know,
he goes too far on the devil's advocacy

2919
02:09:32,981 --> 02:09:35,140
with the 13 year olds sexual
relationships.

2920
02:09:35,141 --> 02:09:36,430
And you go,
come on guys,

2921
02:09:36,431 --> 02:09:38,770
let's just dial it in a bit here.
We're all the same.

2922
02:09:38,890 --> 02:09:41,560
Racism is over.
Homophobia is over.

2923
02:09:41,600 --> 02:09:44,530
Let's not sexism.
Racism is over.

2924
02:09:44,531 --> 02:09:47,140
I don't think it's over.
I think there's plenty of racist people.

2925
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:48,910
Here's the deal with racism.
Okay,

2926
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:51,280
I'm hiring.
Okay,

2927
02:09:51,281 --> 02:09:52,840
I'm checking out your resume here.
Oh,

2928
02:09:52,841 --> 02:09:53,770
you're an accountant.
Oh,

2929
02:09:53,771 --> 02:09:55,240
you want to,
you want to make 80 grand a year.

2930
02:09:55,241 --> 02:09:57,520
You saved your previous company 150
grand a year.

2931
02:09:57,521 --> 02:09:58,480
Well,
that's a great point for me.

2932
02:09:58,480 --> 02:10:00,040
I'm gonna make 70 grand a year just
hiring you.

2933
02:10:00,250 --> 02:10:02,710
I'm going to look like a champ.
My job would be more secure.

2934
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:04,150
Uh,
the company will make more money.

2935
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:06,840
I think we,
oh yeah.

2936
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:09,640
Uh,
I didn't know you were black.

2937
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:12,580
Uh,
you're going to have to leave.

2938
02:10:12,790 --> 02:10:17,620
We're a negro free zone,
but you're only talking about hiring.

2939
02:10:17,860 --> 02:10:18,940
Okay.
You an hour,

2940
02:10:18,941 --> 02:10:21,850
you're sitting there and you're like,
I got my blt.

2941
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:24,220
You didn't toast the bread.
It's like socks.

2942
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:26,080
You just put a sock on a tomato and
some,

2943
02:10:26,380 --> 02:10:28,610
and now when I touch it,
it forms in the shape of my fingers.

2944
02:10:28,630 --> 02:10:31,210
Like a tempurpedic mattress.
You can't fucking toe spread.

2945
02:10:31,450 --> 02:10:33,590
And then some black guys like I fucking,
when they do that,

2946
02:10:33,620 --> 02:10:36,710
who has a sandwich that's not toasted?
And by the way,

2947
02:10:36,711 --> 02:10:39,830
the giant sucked this year and you feel
the same way about toast,

2948
02:10:39,831 --> 02:10:40,700
the same way about the giants.

2949
02:10:40,700 --> 02:10:42,180
And you go,
Oh,

2950
02:10:42,360 --> 02:10:43,101
uh,
yeah,

2951
02:10:43,101 --> 02:10:46,280
I'm going to deny myself this
interesting conversation because you're

2952
02:10:46,281 --> 02:10:47,330
a negro.
But you're,

2953
02:10:47,331 --> 02:10:50,210
you're being rational though.
Like you're talking about rational

2954
02:10:53,660 --> 02:10:56,480
deny themselves money that,
that they don't deny things that are

2955
02:10:56,481 --> 02:10:58,010
gonna make them money and people are
selfish,

2956
02:10:58,020 --> 02:10:59,240
don't deny themselves.
Cool,

2957
02:10:59,241 --> 02:11:03,350
interesting friends.
I think there's plenty of people today

2958
02:11:03,500 --> 02:11:07,070
amongst us that are very racist.
What is racist?

2959
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:11,120
Racist is prejudging someone based on
the color of their skin or their ethnic

2960
02:11:11,121 --> 02:11:13,220
origin.
So they,

2961
02:11:13,230 --> 02:11:16,760
the guy likes all this stuff you like,
but you refuse to see them as an

2962
02:11:16,761 --> 02:11:20,480
exception to the ones you like.
Because if you're looking at him and at

2963
02:11:20,481 --> 02:11:22,280
the bar,
well that's that one guy and your

2964
02:11:22,281 --> 02:11:23,270
scenario.
Yeah.

2965
02:11:23,590 --> 02:11:24,800
Well I,
you know you,

2966
02:11:24,940 --> 02:11:28,250
you're painting some very simplistic
scenarios that deal with a really

2967
02:11:28,251 --> 02:11:31,610
complex issue.
People prejudging people and people not

2968
02:11:31,611 --> 02:11:34,870
liking people or people identify with
other people that look like them.

2969
02:11:34,880 --> 02:11:37,640
Like you and me being too white guys.
Okay.

2970
02:11:37,700 --> 02:11:39,830
The racist you're describing doesn't
like black people.

2971
02:11:39,980 --> 02:11:43,870
I'm bringing up a scenario where if he
sees a black person say there is a

2972
02:11:43,871 --> 02:11:46,400
racism,
it's like this thin veneer,

2973
02:11:46,430 --> 02:11:48,740
oily,
slick in the bathtub.

2974
02:11:48,741 --> 02:11:51,080
When you have brill cream and you take a
bath,

2975
02:11:52,220 --> 02:11:53,780
all you got to do to go through it,
it just go.

2976
02:11:54,590 --> 02:11:57,290
So the second that black guy says,
I hate the giants this year,

2977
02:11:57,410 --> 02:12:00,500
that guy's racism just goes.
I mean I have so much more prejudice for

2978
02:12:00,501 --> 02:12:04,730
people wear flip flops for men who have
those utility backpacks when they wear a

2979
02:12:04,731 --> 02:12:05,700
suit.
What about man,

2980
02:12:05,701 --> 02:12:07,490
stay at home dads,
man buns.

2981
02:12:07,491 --> 02:12:10,210
I don't think I could be your facility
backpacks and then wear a suit.

2982
02:12:10,410 --> 02:12:14,330
Father's suit on put their backpack is
all mountain climb marine with an

2983
02:12:14,350 --> 02:12:16,130
ergonomic things and it bothers you.

2984
02:12:16,220 --> 02:12:19,490
It drives me nuts.
Why does that bother?

2985
02:12:19,491 --> 02:12:21,260
You should have a briefcase if you have
a suit.

2986
02:12:21,290 --> 02:12:23,360
But what do you mountain climbing and to
do,

2987
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:25,790
you're a tax audit.
But what is that?

2988
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:29,380
I mean they want to have their laptop
and all their books and they want to

2989
02:12:29,390 --> 02:12:31,070
carry it and it's easy to carry things
in your bag.

2990
02:12:31,071 --> 02:12:36,020
So find a canvas backpack if you must.
But what's the matter with Karen and I

2991
02:12:36,021 --> 02:12:37,760
don't even like when people have rolling
luggage,

2992
02:12:37,970 --> 02:12:40,610
we all are growing luggage.
She can't carry 20 pounds.

2993
02:12:40,611 --> 02:12:43,610
You Pussy rolling luggage.
It's easy to roll.

2994
02:12:43,640 --> 02:12:45,560
Yeah.
So is wearing your pj's on the plane.

2995
02:12:45,561 --> 02:12:47,390
It's disgusting to do.
But this is,

2996
02:12:47,570 --> 02:12:49,070
is this acceptable?
This backpack?

2997
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:50,540
Yeah.
That's great because you have a tee

2998
02:12:50,541 --> 02:12:51,470
shirt on.
Okay,

2999
02:12:51,530 --> 02:12:55,310
so your,
your backpack is actually more a fancy

3000
02:12:55,311 --> 02:12:57,230
mall than your clothing.
That's fine.

3001
02:12:57,260 --> 02:12:59,090
I might not,
I'm not measuring and matching up

3002
02:12:59,091 --> 02:13:00,950
correctly.
You're matching up just fine.

3003
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:03,760
But if a young Jamie with his,
uh,

3004
02:13:03,790 --> 02:13:08,660
it tech slash comedians outfit,
if he was wearing that and he had maybe

3005
02:13:08,661 --> 02:13:10,970
like a certain type of backpack,
what,

3006
02:13:11,240 --> 02:13:12,680
what would he be allowed?
What's he got?

3007
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:13,461
Oh,
that seems,

3008
02:13:13,461 --> 02:13:14,270
that's nice.
Perfect.

3009
02:13:14,270 --> 02:13:15,500
My problem with you,
Jamie,

3010
02:13:16,580 --> 02:13:20,090
you shouldn't have anything on your tee
shirt after 30 but that's a fighter and

3011
02:13:20,091 --> 02:13:22,110
the kid promoted my friends.
That's,

3012
02:13:22,150 --> 02:13:22,870
I'm like,
okay,

3013
02:13:22,870 --> 02:13:24,440
I'm doing a commercial.
My friends,

3014
02:13:24,441 --> 02:13:26,090
this is my friend John Dudley's.
Okay,

3015
02:13:26,091 --> 02:13:29,900
you're doing an ad,
but people like loans on your shirt when

3016
02:13:29,901 --> 02:13:32,220
you're 40 or no one cares what bands

3017
02:13:32,220 --> 02:13:33,600
you like at that age.
Wow.

3018
02:13:33,630 --> 02:13:35,880
Anyway,
my general point is we all have our

3019
02:13:35,881 --> 02:13:39,150
little quirks.
You general point is you're very

3020
02:13:39,151 --> 02:13:41,670
specific in what you allow people to do
and not do.

3021
02:13:42,120 --> 02:13:43,530
Very rigid.
A Guy,

3022
02:13:43,600 --> 02:13:46,080
we were in Jamaica on vacation and it
was all you can eat thing.

3023
02:13:46,140 --> 02:13:48,570
And he,
he had his plate and he just,

3024
02:13:48,571 --> 02:13:52,740
he must've been Irish.
He piled on three huge spoonfuls of

3025
02:13:52,741 --> 02:13:55,170
mashed potatoes.
It took up most of his plate.

3026
02:13:55,590 --> 02:13:57,420
And I'm looking at him going,
we're in fucking Jamaica,

3027
02:13:57,421 --> 02:14:00,450
the jerk chicken,
all this fancy shit and you're using up

3028
02:14:00,451 --> 02:14:02,100
your whole meal on mashed potatoes,
you,

3029
02:14:02,101 --> 02:14:03,120
that bothers me,
the mic.

3030
02:14:03,540 --> 02:14:05,250
And I hated him for the rest of the
trip.

3031
02:14:06,950 --> 02:14:08,820
I think I needed someone to hate on the
trip.

3032
02:14:08,821 --> 02:14:10,920
So I would see him.
He'd just be like eating an ice cream

3033
02:14:10,921 --> 02:14:11,850
cone.
And I just go,

3034
02:14:11,851 --> 02:14:12,684
fuck.

3035
02:14:13,080 --> 02:14:15,720
Wow.
Maybe you do you recognize that's your

3036
02:14:15,721 --> 02:14:17,490
own personal issue?
It's a Scottish thing.

3037
02:14:17,670 --> 02:14:20,160
Same as the news.
We were at war for 800 years with the

3038
02:14:20,161 --> 02:14:23,150
English and they're constantly looking
at the ones who don't like confrontation

3039
02:14:23,151 --> 02:14:24,690
or extinct.
Uh,

3040
02:14:24,720 --> 02:14:26,730
so Dr drew says this,
he goes,

3041
02:14:26,731 --> 02:14:29,910
the reason that Scott's are drunks is
they like,

3042
02:14:30,030 --> 02:14:32,700
they like conflict.
So they'll put a war in their body.

3043
02:14:32,910 --> 02:14:35,250
So they were going out.
Those walking is hard.

3044
02:14:35,580 --> 02:14:39,030
I'm giving myself a handicap,
so we liked struggle.

3045
02:14:39,031 --> 02:14:41,970
We like pain.
That's fascinating.

3046
02:14:42,240 --> 02:14:46,470
Even in fucking,
I'm never totally enjoying it.

3047
02:14:46,471 --> 02:14:47,670
I'm always like,
I got to last longer.

3048
02:14:47,671 --> 02:14:50,310
Think of Kevin Spacey.
Do the alphabet backwards.

3049
02:14:51,060 --> 02:14:53,380
What do you think of what,
when do you think of Kevin Space Still?

3050
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:54,660
Dude,
it's you think of kindness.

3051
02:14:55,010 --> 02:14:56,400
You're going to call me tomorrow.
I'll go.

3052
02:14:56,401 --> 02:14:59,430
Thank you so much.
My wife can't walk to that.

3053
02:15:00,150 --> 02:15:03,420
You Imagine Kevin Spacey's head floating
over the bed.

3054
02:15:03,720 --> 02:15:07,080
Not like dismembered and bleeding,
just like his face doing nothing.

3055
02:15:07,081 --> 02:15:10,200
Just staring.
Just staring at you two and a half

3056
02:15:10,201 --> 02:15:12,310
minutes.
Do you imagine him as Kaiser San Jose or

3057
02:15:12,311 --> 02:15:14,160
as Frank Underwood?
I don't.

3058
02:15:14,310 --> 02:15:16,140
I'm not.
I don't have strong feelings about it.

3059
02:15:16,141 --> 02:15:17,050
I'm like,
I've never seen that.

3060
02:15:17,051 --> 02:15:19,680
A house of lies show her cards.
The card show.

3061
02:15:19,830 --> 02:15:20,850
Okay,
sounds great.

3062
02:15:20,851 --> 02:15:23,700
Show.
I don't know why I'm in a season three

3063
02:15:23,701 --> 02:15:24,510
right now.
Oh,

3064
02:15:24,510 --> 02:15:26,130
just started off like you were seeing it
in it.

3065
02:15:26,190 --> 02:15:26,581
No,
no,

3066
02:15:26,581 --> 02:15:27,030
no,
no.

3067
02:15:27,030 --> 02:15:29,700
Intuit.
I talked to a guy who was gay and he

3068
02:15:29,701 --> 02:15:30,750
goes,
I'm with Kevin Spacey.

3069
02:15:30,751 --> 02:15:33,360
And I go,
can you tell him banging them that I use

3070
02:15:33,361 --> 02:15:35,460
him and all my friends do?
And he's like,

3071
02:15:35,461 --> 02:15:36,600
no,
I'm not saying that.

3072
02:15:36,601 --> 02:15:39,840
That's really mean.
And I had never occurred to me that,

3073
02:15:39,841 --> 02:15:41,310
yeah,
you don't want to be known as the guy

3074
02:15:41,311 --> 02:15:42,540
who can make you not come.

3075
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:44,130
Yeah.
Nobody wants that.

3076
02:15:44,550 --> 02:15:45,990
But anyway,
even fucking,

3077
02:15:46,020 --> 02:15:48,000
I'm stressed out.
Even when trump won,

3078
02:15:48,150 --> 02:15:50,340
we had a big party,
we were all wearing Hawaiian shirts.

3079
02:15:50,580 --> 02:15:53,490
And when I saw Donald Trump president on
the big screen in the bar,

3080
02:15:53,860 --> 02:15:56,190
everyone started cheering.
My Buddy Alan was just pouring beer on

3081
02:15:56,191 --> 02:15:57,660
his head and I went,
yeah,

3082
02:15:57,661 --> 02:15:59,160
cause I didn't want to bomb other guys
out,

3083
02:15:59,190 --> 02:16:02,490
but my brain hadn't processed it yet and
I couldn't thoroughly enjoy it.

3084
02:16:02,491 --> 02:16:05,130
And then everyone picked me up and
they're carrying me around the bar.

3085
02:16:05,131 --> 02:16:07,950
Yeah.
Do you have any problems with him being

3086
02:16:07,951 --> 02:16:09,410
the president?
You,

3087
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:10,191
cause you,
you,

3088
02:16:10,191 --> 02:16:14,010
you seem pretty,
pretty aware and pretty rational other

3089
02:16:14,011 --> 02:16:16,950
than the way you make people dress and
wear backpacks.

3090
02:16:17,760 --> 02:16:20,160
But did you have any problems with him
being president?

3091
02:16:21,040 --> 02:16:23,250
Is there anything disturbs you about it
or are you totally open?

3092
02:16:23,251 --> 02:16:24,870
Like if he starts fucking with the First
Amendment,

3093
02:16:24,900 --> 02:16:26,370
I'm going to drag him out of there by
his heels.

3094
02:16:26,580 --> 02:16:29,040
I'm not excited about this son in law
getting a job.

3095
02:16:29,050 --> 02:16:30,130
That sounds like nepotism

3096
02:16:30,130 --> 02:16:31,120
to me.
What a coincidence.

3097
02:16:31,300 --> 02:16:33,550
Your son in law is the most qualified
person for the job.

3098
02:16:34,030 --> 02:16:35,980
Uh,
there's times when the tweets can be

3099
02:16:35,981 --> 02:16:37,120
petty.
I don't know why we're talking about

3100
02:16:37,121 --> 02:16:40,420
Arnold Schwarzenegger's a ratings.
Um,

3101
02:16:40,630 --> 02:16:41,081
and then,
no,

3102
02:16:41,081 --> 02:16:44,020
I'm not excited about the travel budget,
although he is doing a lot of shit.

3103
02:16:44,320 --> 02:16:47,160
But as far as what we've come out with
and,

3104
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:50,410
and the amount of fucking left wing
back,

3105
02:16:50,850 --> 02:16:52,810
uh,
back patting that we've been going

3106
02:16:52,811 --> 02:16:56,140
through for the past eight years,
I'm fucking ecstatic.

3107
02:16:56,320 --> 02:16:58,060
What's the backpacking that you're
talking about?

3108
02:16:58,061 --> 02:17:01,810
Like they were so wonderful and Obama's
so great and you know,

3109
02:17:01,811 --> 02:17:04,870
you,
you come to La and you realize that

3110
02:17:04,871 --> 02:17:07,660
everyone in this fucking city thinks
Obama did an awesome job.

3111
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:11,170
And they also think that Bill Maher is
Christopher hitchens.

3112
02:17:11,710 --> 02:17:14,380
Like he's an intellectual Demi God in
this town.

3113
02:17:14,680 --> 02:17:15,550
Bill Maher's.
Yeah.

3114
02:17:15,551 --> 02:17:17,140
Every time I talked to someone they go,
Oh,

3115
02:17:17,380 --> 02:17:18,213
you should talk to go.

3116
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:19,930
I'd love to see you in a room with Bill
Maher.

3117
02:17:19,960 --> 02:17:21,730
I'm like,
that's your intellectual heavyweight.

3118
02:17:22,120 --> 02:17:24,700
That's your main guy.
I think he would probably agree with you

3119
02:17:24,701 --> 02:17:27,820
on a lot of things,
which really be confusing to them

3120
02:17:27,821 --> 02:17:29,680
because he agreed with Milo on a lot of
things.

3121
02:17:29,681 --> 02:17:31,420
So a lot of people are mad at him
because of that.

3122
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:34,450
And you know,
he said that he removed Milo,

3123
02:17:34,480 --> 02:17:37,480
reminded him of a young Christopher
hitchens except you know,

3124
02:17:37,481 --> 02:17:39,870
gay and foppish and he said a bunch of
other things about him.

3125
02:17:40,180 --> 02:17:41,080
Yeah.
But he's like,

3126
02:17:41,081 --> 02:17:42,940
you know,
he just got abandoned some of what

3127
02:17:42,941 --> 02:17:46,750
you're doing because some of what he's
doing is fighting the good fight against

3128
02:17:46,870 --> 02:17:51,310
irrational feminism that denies the
biological differences between men and

3129
02:17:51,311 --> 02:17:55,750
women and lies about the gender wage gap
and all these different things that he

3130
02:17:55,751 --> 02:18:00,700
does accurately point out which people
it all the fucking time and drives me

3131
02:18:00,701 --> 02:18:01,300
nuts.

3132
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:02,980
I've talked about a way too many times
in the show,

3133
02:18:02,981 --> 02:18:06,050
but that God damn gender gap was in the
Guardian yesterday.

3134
02:18:06,051 --> 02:18:07,480
I know,
and when Obama said it,

3135
02:18:07,481 --> 02:18:09,520
I go,
do you know that you're full of shit?

3136
02:18:09,600 --> 02:18:10,840
Oh no,
that's not true.

3137
02:18:10,870 --> 02:18:13,630
You know you have researchers.
Did you ask him or are you knowingly

3138
02:18:14,080 --> 02:18:17,200
repeating this myth?
Because most people don't get votes.

3139
02:18:17,260 --> 02:18:20,530
Most people don't know.
It's smart people that I know who have

3140
02:18:20,531 --> 02:18:23,710
not looked into it or haven't had
debates about it with other people don't

3141
02:18:23,711 --> 02:18:25,660
understand what the gender pay gap
really is.

3142
02:18:25,661 --> 02:18:29,140
That it's simply a matter of working
less hours and choosing different jobs.

3143
02:18:29,141 --> 02:18:31,210
It's not two people.
One man,

3144
02:18:31,211 --> 02:18:34,150
one woman working side by side doing the
same job with a woman makes

3145
02:18:34,151 --> 02:18:36,280
significantly less.
And that's what we're being led to

3146
02:18:36,281 --> 02:18:39,850
believe and that is,
that is a real sticking point with

3147
02:18:39,851 --> 02:18:40,330
feminism.

3148
02:18:40,330 --> 02:18:43,900
They're being dishonest in their
portrayal of the issues of the workplace

3149
02:18:44,050 --> 02:18:47,320
and you end up going,
you guys are making me think woman are

3150
02:18:47,321 --> 02:18:50,530
dumb,
so I don't like that woman's March.

3151
02:18:50,531 --> 02:18:51,230
I go,
you guys are,

3152
02:18:51,230 --> 02:18:53,710
I don't know what you're out to.
Prove here that your pussy has teeth,

3153
02:18:54,120 --> 02:18:55,810
uh,
you're making women look dumb.

3154
02:18:56,050 --> 02:18:59,050
Even the abortion thing,
half 50% of women are pro life.

3155
02:18:59,260 --> 02:19:01,510
So why are you making this a gender
issue?

3156
02:19:01,930 --> 02:19:03,430
It's an,
it's an ethics thing.

3157
02:19:03,431 --> 02:19:06,570
It's like a euthanasia,
but it does nothing to do with men or

3158
02:19:06,580 --> 02:19:08,830
woman.
Are you okay with abortion up to a

3159
02:19:08,831 --> 02:19:10,600
certain age?
No,

3160
02:19:10,810 --> 02:19:14,620
not at all.
So week after conception when it's a

3161
02:19:14,621 --> 02:19:16,540
bundle of cells,
the size of your fingernail,

3162
02:19:17,350 --> 02:19:17,980
uh,
no.

3163
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:19,450
Do not kill that.
Wow.

3164
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:21,480
No heartbeat.
Just uh,

3165
02:19:21,490 --> 02:19:23,590
of,
of viable cluster.

3166
02:19:23,591 --> 02:19:26,380
A little gals,
beautiful little three cells sitting

3167
02:19:26,381 --> 02:19:27,920
there.
You can suck it out with one of those

3168
02:19:27,921 --> 02:19:28,310
tiny

3169
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:30,290
cocktail straws you don't really drink
out of,

3170
02:19:30,350 --> 02:19:32,660
but they don't do they,
they stuck it out and they want you to

3171
02:19:32,661 --> 02:19:35,620
splat against the plexiglass walls
ripped down the side.

3172
02:19:35,630 --> 02:19:38,480
Turns out it's good for your skin.
If we can get down to the morning after

3173
02:19:38,481 --> 02:19:41,930
pills and that kind of stuff,
I would love to debate to go there.

3174
02:19:41,931 --> 02:19:44,270
But right now it's,
it's way too far down the line.

3175
02:19:44,300 --> 02:19:45,710
And you know what,
speaking of Bill Maher,

3176
02:19:45,711 --> 02:19:48,110
he doesn't have kids.
Angela Merkel doesn't have kids.

3177
02:19:48,440 --> 02:19:53,440
There's this lack of connection that
these childless people have in our media

3178
02:19:53,870 --> 02:19:58,820
and in our political system.
And there's an anti kid culture going on

3179
02:19:58,821 --> 02:20:01,670
that is f no masochism combined with
laziness.

3180
02:20:01,671 --> 02:20:03,440
And it really is our death now in many
ways.

3181
02:20:03,441 --> 02:20:07,100
Like when I'm in Williamsburg with my
fucking stupid dog that I would happily

3182
02:20:07,101 --> 02:20:11,150
kill right now
and will kill your dog,

3183
02:20:11,151 --> 02:20:12,350
feel nothing for them.

3184
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:15,260
It's my daughter's dog and it's a little
Havanese puppy.

3185
02:20:15,261 --> 02:20:16,900
I don't fucking know.
It's a poppy.

3186
02:20:16,901 --> 02:20:18,230
You would kill the puppy.
Well,

3187
02:20:18,231 --> 02:20:19,070
if it,
you know,

3188
02:20:19,430 --> 02:20:21,620
one of the kids,
I could take a meat cleaver to its head

3189
02:20:21,621 --> 02:20:25,040
and I would be on the phone as I did it.
Like we'd be like preparing a chicken

3190
02:20:25,041 --> 02:20:26,930
for dinner.
I feel no Jesus.

3191
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:28,730
Um,
and when I have that dog,

3192
02:20:28,731 --> 02:20:30,080
all these spinsters,
oh,

3193
02:20:30,081 --> 02:20:32,210
what's his name?
Is it in boy and girl and my,

3194
02:20:32,250 --> 02:20:33,950
who fucking cares?
He's not going to wear a dress.

3195
02:20:33,951 --> 02:20:35,660
But when you're with your kid,
when I'm with my kids,

3196
02:20:36,230 --> 02:20:37,220
my son,
my youngest,

3197
02:20:37,221 --> 02:20:39,170
my four year old is so cute.
He's a freak.

3198
02:20:39,470 --> 02:20:41,330
Like it's,
he's the elephant man of cuteness.

3199
02:20:41,331 --> 02:20:42,860
He doesn't,
he looks away from people because they

3200
02:20:42,861 --> 02:20:43,694
freak out.
It's,

3201
02:20:43,730 --> 02:20:44,990
he's Garish.
She's so cute.

3202
02:20:45,530 --> 02:20:47,690
Uh,
but they see them with disdain.

3203
02:20:48,050 --> 02:20:50,480
And I've noticed that not just in
hipster Williamsburg,

3204
02:20:50,481 --> 02:20:52,430
but you know,
at Fox News,

3205
02:20:52,431 --> 02:20:54,170
I would get that from people who didn't
have kids.

3206
02:20:54,180 --> 02:20:56,540
Are you sitting at Fox News and you're
looking around the table and you're

3207
02:20:56,541 --> 02:20:58,310
like,
we're sitting here talking about family

3208
02:20:58,311 --> 02:21:02,840
values and the future of America and I'm
the only person in this entire panel

3209
02:21:02,841 --> 02:21:07,841
with kids and I can't help but think
that Angela Merkel suicidal policy of

3210
02:21:08,061 --> 02:21:12,920
bringing the refugees and fuck the whole
country is somehow lik linked to her.

3211
02:21:12,921 --> 02:21:16,880
Childlessness it may be,
it's certainly linked to her desire to

3212
02:21:16,881 --> 02:21:19,700
not come off as racist or homophobic or,
excuse me,

3213
02:21:19,701 --> 02:21:21,500
Islamophobic.
Yeah,

3214
02:21:21,501 --> 02:21:24,200
it's definitely like their life is
parties and dinner parties.

3215
02:21:24,201 --> 02:21:25,760
You don't want things to be weird,
but when you have,

3216
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:28,040
when you have skin in the game,
you go,

3217
02:21:28,041 --> 02:21:31,520
I don't fucking care if you hate me.
I gotta make sure that things are kosher

3218
02:21:31,580 --> 02:21:33,440
for the boys,
like Dana,

3219
02:21:33,470 --> 02:21:36,230
Dana Lash,
she was a feminist raver with big

3220
02:21:36,231 --> 02:21:40,220
fucking Ginkgo genes in college and
chain wallet.

3221
02:21:40,490 --> 02:21:45,080
And then she saw what a feminism was
doing to young boys and making them

3222
02:21:45,081 --> 02:21:47,330
ashamed of being men.
And she had boys.

3223
02:21:47,480 --> 02:21:48,111
She went,
Whoa,

3224
02:21:48,111 --> 02:21:50,630
whoa.
We created a monster here and pivoted

3225
02:21:50,631 --> 02:21:53,870
and became all about saying,
masculinity is aok.

3226
02:21:54,380 --> 02:21:56,330
Fuck these feminists.
We were wrong.

3227
02:21:57,100 --> 02:21:59,210
You know,
weird times,

3228
02:21:59,211 --> 02:22:01,660
man.
It's really weird times where people try

3229
02:22:01,680 --> 02:22:04,340
and define themselves now just fucking
breed.

3230
02:22:04,370 --> 02:22:07,940
I was talking to some asshole at the bar
last night and he's repeating what he

3231
02:22:07,941 --> 02:22:10,490
saw and in all of her stone movie,
and I'm like,

3232
02:22:10,491 --> 02:22:11,780
that movie's been debunked,
Michael.

3233
02:22:11,781 --> 02:22:12,411
Malice,
no,

3234
02:22:12,411 --> 02:22:16,730
sorry,
Michael Moynahan the one about a World

3235
02:22:16,730 --> 02:22:19,100
War II and how Stalin was under,
you know,

3236
02:22:19,101 --> 02:22:21,530
under appreciated.
And we have to understand that we

3237
02:22:21,531 --> 02:22:23,680
shouldn't have gone into World War II
and we shouldn't have fucked with the,

3238
02:22:23,700 --> 02:22:26,850
I don't know what move is,
is you're talking about the a untold

3239
02:22:26,851 --> 02:22:27,690
history of the world.

3240
02:22:27,970 --> 02:22:31,230
I'm watching that right now.
It's read Michael Moynihan's take down

3241
02:22:31,231 --> 02:22:33,660
of it.
God Damn it.

3242
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:36,600
I'll just sit for stone is a sale and
really good apologist.

3243
02:22:36,780 --> 02:22:39,330
Well he was,
he made out stolen to be a fucking

3244
02:22:39,331 --> 02:22:40,710
monster in it.
Oh,

3245
02:22:40,711 --> 02:22:41,990
I thought he didn't,
he didn't do enough.

3246
02:22:42,030 --> 02:22:44,220
I thought down came out real nice.
Really?

3247
02:22:44,250 --> 02:22:46,230
Yeah.
Did you watch the same thing I saw?

3248
02:22:46,770 --> 02:22:48,060
Did you watch it?
Yes.

3249
02:22:48,090 --> 02:22:48,923
Wow.
Long ago.

3250
02:22:49,710 --> 02:22:51,210
When did it come out?
Four years ago.

3251
02:22:51,240 --> 02:22:53,700
Longer than that thing.
But a long ass time ago.

3252
02:22:54,180 --> 02:22:57,620
But I was really interested in,
but they talking about in all of us

3253
02:22:57,621 --> 02:22:59,160
don't have to respond to Moynihan's
take.

3254
02:22:59,340 --> 02:23:00,060
Oh,
okay.

3255
02:23:00,060 --> 02:23:01,640
Well I'll have to read those.
To what,

3256
02:23:01,670 --> 02:23:02,920
what is his name?
Patrick point hand.

3257
02:23:03,330 --> 02:23:05,600
Michael Mine the one hand.
Who's Patrick Moynihan?

3258
02:23:05,700 --> 02:23:07,140
What do I know that name?
I forget,

3259
02:23:07,860 --> 02:23:08,730
but I know that name too.

3260
02:23:09,420 --> 02:23:10,253
But,
uh,

3261
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:13,770
I'm listening to this fuck face,
this 34 year old and he's,

3262
02:23:13,771 --> 02:23:15,780
he's with this,
we've been with this woman for five

3263
02:23:15,781 --> 02:23:18,300
years and she's 29.
And I just said to him,

3264
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:22,920
just stop repeating a documentary you
saw last night and go fucking propose

3265
02:23:22,921 --> 02:23:25,610
you pussy.
Did you not know him before those?

3266
02:23:26,340 --> 02:23:28,440
This is,
I was shit.

3267
02:23:28,470 --> 02:23:30,240
I was shit faced.
My wife and I had,

3268
02:23:30,350 --> 02:23:32,380
well my,
and I left the kids in the and Malibu

3269
02:23:32,381 --> 02:23:33,390
and we came to,
uh,

3270
02:23:34,050 --> 02:23:35,670
we went out,
partied and got a hotel room,

3271
02:23:35,730 --> 02:23:37,110
got laid.
It was awesome.

3272
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:40,650
Nice single again.
I don't know how these childless people

3273
02:23:40,651 --> 02:23:43,650
are not fucking 24 hours a day.
They probably are.

3274
02:23:43,770 --> 02:23:45,630
That's,
but they don't want that to end.

3275
02:23:45,660 --> 02:23:48,570
They don't want the fun part to end.
I want to be wrapped up together and

3276
02:23:48,571 --> 02:23:51,630
then contemplating divorce.
If you're out there right now and you're

3277
02:23:51,631 --> 02:23:53,280
in a relationship with a girl,
you guys live together.

3278
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:56,310
I don't know why she's allowed to wear
clothes in the house the second she

3279
02:23:56,311 --> 02:23:58,830
walks into the front door nude,
we'll draw the blinds.

3280
02:23:59,130 --> 02:24:01,230
She should be nude at all times.
Don't you kind of want them to wear

3281
02:24:01,231 --> 02:24:03,120
clothes so you can take the clothes off?
Nope.

3282
02:24:03,390 --> 02:24:05,190
If I was sick,
if I didn't have kids,

3283
02:24:05,430 --> 02:24:08,220
my wife would be,
there'd be a basket by the front door

3284
02:24:08,221 --> 02:24:10,030
for clothes that she has to take off
when she comes in.

3285
02:24:10,040 --> 02:24:10,873
You make her,
Huh?

3286
02:24:10,980 --> 02:24:12,570
Yeah.
Noodle lady rules.

3287
02:24:12,600 --> 02:24:13,740
High heels.
Only getting a,

3288
02:24:13,890 --> 02:24:15,630
or just thinking about it.
Leather underwear.

3289
02:24:15,750 --> 02:24:19,630
I would wear leather pants and an
oversized baseball cap.

3290
02:24:19,890 --> 02:24:21,690
He comes out about a fluff,
flat brim,

3291
02:24:23,460 --> 02:24:24,830
Guitar Player,
Plastic Guitar.

3292
02:24:24,831 --> 02:24:27,210
Now how about a Ukulele?
Ukulele too.

3293
02:24:27,211 --> 02:24:28,980
And clench shoes,
clown shoes.

3294
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:30,960
Those,
those need to come back.

3295
02:24:31,440 --> 02:24:33,290
Actually,
you know what's a hot outfit for Amanda

3296
02:24:33,300 --> 02:24:36,870
were in bed is a white t shirt and black
socks and you're just like,

3297
02:24:36,871 --> 02:24:38,790
I'm such an ugly pig man.

3298
02:24:39,950 --> 02:24:42,350
Spaghetti stains on it.
Just like such a dad,

3299
02:24:42,580 --> 02:24:45,660
a big gut hanging out of the bottom of
the t shirt.

3300
02:24:46,540 --> 02:24:48,060
I was like,
my buddy Dan goes,

3301
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:52,800
he goes smelling a woman's ass as a poor
man's Viagara cause you're grossed out

3302
02:24:52,801 --> 02:24:56,100
by how much you like it and you're like,
I'm a fucking pig.

3303
02:24:56,250 --> 02:24:57,083
And then boy,
you know,

3304
02:24:57,090 --> 02:24:57,340
young,
young,

3305
02:24:57,340 --> 02:25:02,340
young man,
poor man shot by yourself.

3306
02:25:03,781 --> 02:25:04,710
You're like,
that's hilarious.

3307
02:25:04,740 --> 02:25:05,740
Like this.
Ooh,

3308
02:25:05,880 --> 02:25:09,000
what the fuck?
You're sticking your nose in it while

3309
02:25:09,001 --> 02:25:12,060
you're eating her out from behind.
Joey Diaz calls that doing the pigeon

3310
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:19,950
piggish and on that note,
should we wrap this up?

3311
02:25:19,980 --> 02:25:20,813
Yeah,
let's wrap it up.

3312
02:25:20,840 --> 02:25:22,180
All Right Gavin.
Thank you man.

3313
02:25:22,181 --> 02:25:23,530
It was fun.
Always fun to you.

3314
02:25:23,560 --> 02:25:24,100
Yeah.
Appreciate

3315
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:27,880
times and tell everybody where they can
see your show and listen to it and watch

3316
02:25:27,881 --> 02:25:32,860
it.
My show is it compound media.com I also

3317
02:25:32,861 --> 02:25:37,600
do a video series on the rebel.media and
I have a regular written column,

3318
02:25:37,630 --> 02:25:42,630
a story coming out tomorrow about
milo@tackymagtakitackymag.com and a

3319
02:25:45,700 --> 02:25:48,610
compound media is all Anthony Kumina
stuff because that is correct.

3320
02:25:48,670 --> 02:25:51,490
So he changed the name because of that
stupid bitch.

3321
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:53,950
That's why you had to change.
And rallies.

3322
02:25:54,110 --> 02:25:57,250
He's fucking damaged goods now.
I don't know.

3323
02:25:57,251 --> 02:25:59,020
It was still going on.
I thought it was over.

3324
02:25:59,080 --> 02:26:01,540
It is,
but comedians are such pussies these

3325
02:26:01,540 --> 02:26:03,430
days that they don't want to fuck up
their future.

3326
02:26:03,900 --> 02:26:05,980
You know,
hanging out with Kevin can wait show.

3327
02:26:06,220 --> 02:26:09,520
Ah,
and on that note,

3328
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:12,130
uh,
we'll be back tomorrow with former UFC

3329
02:26:12,131 --> 02:26:15,040
bantamweight champion Dominick Cruz.
See Ya.

3330
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:15,993
Bye.

3331
02:26:26,300 --> 02:26:26,370
Okay.
