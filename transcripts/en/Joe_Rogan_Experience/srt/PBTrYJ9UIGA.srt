1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,650
Five,
four,

2
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,000
three,
two,

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,980
boom.
And we're live Ramey warrant

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,430
international man of adventure.
How's it going?

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:13,020
Good to see you,
man.

6
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:16,320
Good to see you.
I purposely didn't ask you or talk to

7
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:19,620
you about the grizzly bear attack
because I wanted to save it.

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,550
You want it?
You want,

9
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:25,551
what is it like to have survived but
literally being two feet away from an

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,540
attack and grizzly bear.
You could have grabbed it.

11
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,410
Yeah.
Oh yeah,

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:32,340
yeah.
Easily.

13
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,390
Easily.
Oh,

14
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,430
it was,
that was just nuts.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,330
It was one of those things.
Okay.

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:40,830
I've thought about it a million times.
I'm sure.

17
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:42,390
How long ago was this?
This was.

18
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,120
So,
that would've been early October.

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,790
Mid October.
So you've answered three months,

20
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,710
three months to kind of wait around.
Yep.

21
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,710
And uh,
yeah man,

22
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:57,240
it's just one of those things that I've
thought about it so many times in my

23
00:00:57,241 --> 00:01:00,060
head and I've always been.
I think Steve was the same way.

24
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,661
Like,
oh,

25
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:05,520
it'd be pretty cool to survive a bear
attack gets scratched up a little bit

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,760
after that experience.
I thought to myself,

27
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,010
if that never happened to me.
Okay.

28
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,030
Yeah.
Steve used to always say steve or no,

29
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:17,190
we're talking about from the mediator
podcasts and he has a two part series on

30
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,720
this particular bear attack,
but he always say he wanted to get

31
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:25,950
clawed across the chest and have like
not a tattoo but like a big closet.

32
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,110
I'm like marketing,
like what?

33
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,680
What are the odds that that happens?
Yeah.

34
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,660
I think that in order to get that you
have to go through a really,

35
00:01:33,661 --> 00:01:38,661
really horrible experience.
There's guys that have had those attacks

36
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,890
or there's guys that have had those
detects a lot,

37
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,940
but yeah,
I mean I've been around a lot of wild

38
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:49,941
animals and seen a lot of things and
been charged by bears and this was just

39
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:51,780
different.

40
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,720
It was that kind of attack where while
it's happening,

41
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:57,780
you're going,
this is not gonna Pan out.

42
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,550
Well,
somebody who's going to die something

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,320
either you're just looking at this bear
and it's coming in hot and just

44
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:06,090
everything.
It's a weird experience.

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,460
You don't.
Your memory's a little foggy.

46
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,670
I mean everything happened so fast,
but it felt like it was so long.

47
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,560
So the adrenaline overwhelmed brain.
Yeah,

48
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:20,190
and if you don't even think about,
I just remember it was,

49
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:23,250
it was a weird situation.
So maybe I'll just kind of recap the

50
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,620
story.
Um,

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,500
so we're,
we're on a fog neck island and we're

52
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,620
hunting in a fog.
Neck island is off of Kodiak.

53
00:02:31,621 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah.
So a fog neck island has some of the

54
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:36,760
largest bears in the world.
They're brown bears are,

55
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,190
they are big brown,
various,

56
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:43,050
it can be over a thousand pounds.
So we're hunting elk there.

57
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,740
My brother and myself have hunted elk on
that island before and it's just a

58
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,560
miserable place to be.
What's a fascinating hunt the way you

59
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:54,490
guys were describing it,
because the,

60
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,940
the,
just the fact that you would choose out

61
00:02:56,941 --> 00:02:58,980
of all the places you can go,
you pretty much can go anywhere,

62
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:04,080
want you chose to go on this brutal
adventure hunt because it's so difficult

63
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:08,710
and says he wants.
Because like Rinella was talking about

64
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:12,820
this once in the way he described it as
like there's things that are fun while

65
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:14,860
you're doing them,
but they're not fun later,

66
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,220
like rollercoasters.
And then there's things that are

67
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:21,910
terrible and awful,
but you'll think about them forever and

68
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:23,470
look back at them fondly.
Yeah,

69
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:27,700
that's exactly what this is.
Is that after the fact you think back

70
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:31,630
and you go in the moment you go,
I will never do this again.

71
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:34,450
And then about a year later you should
do that again.

72
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,880
Weird.
And what is it about the place?

73
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:38,740
It's so miserable.
It's just,

74
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,910
it's hard to walk through.
It looks,

75
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,320
it looks easy.
Hiking.

76
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,770
And there's just this big mountain where
you can get to with a plane,

77
00:03:45,771 --> 00:03:50,630
you've kind of got to climb this big
mountain and the vegetation is so thick

78
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,870
and it's so steep that it takes forever
to go somewhere.

79
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,490
So to put it in perspective,
to go say a mile might take five hours.

80
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,680
Whoa.
That's how much verdict.

81
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,100
Like a map mile.
So the way the crow would fly if you're

82
00:04:04,101 --> 00:04:08,590
just going a mile and then another
distance could take you half that time

83
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,200
recorder that time.
But there's a big mountain in between

84
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:17,000
where you need to go plus the vegetation
and it's really steep.

85
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,370
So you've got all that kind of working
against you,

86
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:21,620
plus you can't really walk and just a
straight line there.

87
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:24,370
You've got to navigate around all kinds
of stuff.

88
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,660
You from place them in this journey that
was and is gay.

89
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,140
So that was after the bear attack.
Well,

90
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,440
I'll have to figure out because I poke
right after the bear attacked.

91
00:04:42,441 --> 00:04:46,880
I pulled out my phone and just kind of
like recording everyone's reactions and

92
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:51,350
then I put it on my instagram story,
but I'll try to find it tonight and I'll

93
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,510
post it onto some.
I'll figure out a way to.

94
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:57,000
Yeah.
And they let you save them now.

95
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,600
Now this was like three weeks before
that.

96
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:03,920
Unfortunate.
So this place is miserable.

97
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:05,870
It's raining all the time.
Rain,

98
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,070
high winds,
thick,

99
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:10,880
thick,
dense vegetation and literal monsters.

100
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,380
Yeah.
I mean giant bears and then big.

101
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:18,740
Um,
the elk are probably with they way they

102
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:21,120
wait,
they can wait up to 1400 pounds either.

103
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,610
It was way bigger.
Yeah,

104
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:26,720
it was like the size of two normal elk
weight wise because like an average elk

105
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:30,260
would probably be around 500 pounds in
most places.

106
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,010
Really big one.
Like we were talking about the

107
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:35,590
California ones that the whole.
And sometimes it can get to a thousand.

108
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,380
This is another 400 pounds,
but exactly.

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,310
It's a lot of digging and there's bears
that eat those giant ant,

110
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,010
so those bears are giant.
The barriers can be over 1200,

111
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,110
1500 pounds themselves.
Eleven feet or more?

112
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,780
Yeah,
11 feet and feet.

113
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,970
It's not 11 foot bear.
No.

114
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,040
This one

115
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,900
that attacked you guys.
How big do you think it was if you had

116
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,860
to guess?
I would say,

117
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,280
well,
I would say it's 11 and a half feet

118
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,110
because I know because actually after we
went in there,

119
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:11,480
my friend who's a pilot there in dropped
us off.

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,870
He called me about a week or two later
and he was like,

121
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,030
they shot that bear.
They went after you guys.

122
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,090
Somebody went in there,
same place.

123
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:23,990
Bear attacked them.
They killed it in self defense.

124
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,160
It was 11 and a half feet and I think
almost 1200 pounds.

125
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,940
So there's very good odds that that was
the same bear.

126
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,770
I would imagine that it was.
I mean,

127
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,820
because marry had just taken over that
area.

128
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,100
Seemed about the same.
So when I,

129
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,110
when it came in,
I thought that's a big bore.

130
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,000
It wasn't one of those ones you think,
oh,

131
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,834
that's a.

132
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,960
It looked like a big mature animal
in the piecing together.

133
00:06:50,511 --> 00:06:52,880
What happened in my mind later.
But yeah,

134
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:57,881
so we're hunting elk on this island.
Steven's up getting an ell.

135
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,760
We hanging in a tree.
We do all the stuff you're supposed to

136
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:03,710
do.
Get the meat away from the carcass.

137
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,240
But we had yet to see a bear up until
this point and when my brother and I

138
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:11,130
went in there a few years earlier,
we just saw bears everyday.

139
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,360
We'd see six beers a day.
So your mind's just bear,

140
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,800
bear bear.
When you're seeing them all the time

141
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:16,970
when you weren't seeing them all the
time,

142
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,360
you get a little lax and that's where we
really screwed up because the attack

143
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:25,970
went down.
No one was prepared,

144
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,590
we were just sitting around having some
sandwiches and one of uh,

145
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,310
so we're,
we're,

146
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,120
we're filming and there was six of us
altogether and I think that large group,

147
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,650
that six is what saved us because when
the bear ran in,

148
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,890
it was six of us sitting kind of in a
semi circle strange circle and when that

149
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:50,471
bear came in we did that scatter effect
and I think that scatter was kind of

150
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:55,850
like if a lion is going after a zebra,
they use their numbers and stripes to

151
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:59,900
confuse the lion is that scattering of
things just going everywhere that,

152
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,900
that caused confusion for the bear.

153
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:06,170
So I think the bear went in thinking
whatever's under that tree,

154
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:08,630
I'm going to kill it.
And it thought it was one thing and when

155
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:13,310
we blew up into six different pieces,
it just tried to kill everything at once

156
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,210
and couldn't actually get one person.
God.

157
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,750
But so lucky.
Yeah,

158
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:20,750
it was crazy because we're sitting down,
we decided,

159
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:23,720
oh,
we'll have lunch before we hiked back

160
00:08:23,721 --> 00:08:26,210
because the day before we,
we hiked along ways.

161
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,440
We got back to camp at three in the
morning or something.

162
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,240
I can't remember.
Two or three in the morning.

163
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:36,410
We'd barely eaten.
So everyone was just thinking let's have

164
00:08:36,411 --> 00:08:38,090
lunch,
regroup,

165
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:41,240
hike out.
So we're pat.

166
00:08:41,241 --> 00:08:45,800
When the other guys that was with us
brought the jet boiled boil up some

167
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:48,440
coffee.
So I was going around collecting water

168
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:51,080
from everyone to get coffee going
around.

169
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,770
And when I sat down I took my pack off
and the whole week I had been doing this

170
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:56,100
thing where I take my pistol from

171
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,100
the PAC belt and put it on the holster
on my body when I dropped my pack and I.

172
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,310
It was a weird deal where I took the
pack off and I'm thinking about

173
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,370
switching and I'm like,
no,

174
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,670
it's fine.
You know,

175
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,430
and I thought I'll just sit because
there's few times I'd set my pack down

176
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:14,130
and was like,
I'll just sit or lay on my pack like as

177
00:09:14,131 --> 00:09:17,560
a chair backrest and then all flop the,
you know,

178
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,860
have the pistol right there.
So it's within arms reach and I'll be

179
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,810
sitting there while I go around and get
the water.

180
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,240
And someone had moved kind of where I
was sitting so now,

181
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,600
so I sit down across from the pack where
my pistol is and then thinking I was

182
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,890
thinking about me that pistol,
but I just was like,

183
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,430
man,
you know,

184
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,210
you don't want to be that guy.

185
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:36,991
Like,
Oh yeah,

186
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:39,980
the guy.
That's exactly right.

187
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,660
We not everybody had pistols,
just me.

188
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:46,980
And Jada said a pistol and then,
and then pat pat's behind us.

189
00:09:46,981 --> 00:09:48,840
He goes,
I hear something and I look up and

190
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:51,510
that's,
that bears like dead set.

191
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:54,840
So Steve would be where you are.
The bear behind Steve.

192
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,110
So Steve was between me and the bear,
his back was to it.

193
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,510
Like how far away?
Not Far.

194
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:03,500
I don't 30 yards something the first
time you see that?

195
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,370
Thirty yards and ends the marriage.
Yeah,

196
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,920
it's dead run super fast.
And I just locked eyes with this thing.

197
00:10:09,921 --> 00:10:14,921
I mean I see it coming in the whole way.
Just beady eyes locked in on me and I

198
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,240
think this thing's gonna kill me.
And so I'm thinking,

199
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,490
you know,
when I say I'm thinking,

200
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:23,010
I don't know if I'm thinking,
I'm just,

201
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,180
I just remembered what I was kind of
going through my head at the time.

202
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,500
I thought,
Oh fuck,

203
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,440
I'm gonna die and my protections,
right?

204
00:10:31,441 --> 00:10:32,790
They're like,
I'm going to die.

205
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,380
This is a situation where I'm dead and
they talk about it and he could have

206
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,020
saved himself but his guns on the ground
and I think that that was like,

207
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,810
go for the gun was my whole thing.
So I start to go for the gun Yonis who

208
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:48,990
would have been here as I remember it.
And so I start to go for the gun and

209
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:49,561
realized,
fuck,

210
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,260
I don't have time to get to my gun.
And it's three feet away.

211
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,950
That bears like right there,
comes to me so fast.

212
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,280
So I kind of do like a football juke
move left,

213
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,250
right?
And then we'll around,

214
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,480
right.
Do like a spin with my back and they

215
00:11:03,481 --> 00:11:08,040
start running to the left.
And at that point Yonis it.

216
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:11,610
I didn't know this at the time because I
looked at some pictures afterwards,

217
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:13,020
kind of piece everything together.

218
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:16,110
So Yannis was sitting right next to me.
I think he got up to turn.

219
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:17,970
There was some trekking poles right
here.

220
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,970
He grabbed a trekking pole,
so probably while I was joking,

221
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,740
he reached around and grabbed the
trekking.

222
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,620
Pole swings around,
hits the bear in the face of Jesus.

223
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:28,350
So then the IC,
the bear running off.

224
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:30,750
Then I see someone going down the
mountain with the bear.

225
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:33,060
I'm thinking he's got someone.
So I grabbed my pistol,

226
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,850
start going down the mountain,
yelling,

227
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,700
Oh,
I guess I count off.

228
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,690
And everyone's like,
one.

229
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,080
I'm like,
Oh shit.

230
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:45,860
And then Garrett pops up out of the
bushes and his eyes.

231
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,390
He's like wide eyed.
So Garrett,

232
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,740
Aka dirt,
dirt myth.

233
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:53,650
He's the one who was on top of the.
Somehow he's on the bears back.

234
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,940
So I think when the bear wheeled around
you like hit him and he ends up on the

235
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,760
back.
So I saw just legs and bear going down

236
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,670
the mountain.
I saw his legs on the back of the bear.

237
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,830
So the bear had them in his job.
Yeah,

238
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,030
that's what I was thinking.
Well,

239
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,570
I mean,
what,

240
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:08,590
who,
who would think

241
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,370
like if that was in a movie,
you'd be like,

242
00:12:12,371 --> 00:12:13,850
get the fuck Outta here.
I think.

243
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:17,590
What was the anchorman where the guy's
like writing the bear.

244
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,790
Exactly.
Yes.

245
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,350
And then we kind of circled up around
the treat and the real scary part was

246
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:29,200
that bear.
So it was so thick.

247
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:32,340
You really couldn't see.
You could see maybe as far as the wall

248
00:12:32,341 --> 00:12:34,090
is from us with.
Was that with the tree?

249
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:35,050
Eight feet?
Yeah.

250
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,730
And just real thick brush.
And you'd hear the bear charging again

251
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,650
and we only have the two pistols.
Yonis I and the wind was so strong.

252
00:12:44,651 --> 00:12:49,330
There's no way we could use bear spray.
So we hear the bear charging in and me

253
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:53,440
and Jada like pistols out ready waiting
for this thing to pop out at point blank

254
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:55,770
range.
And then he would in your yelling,

255
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:00,490
hey.
And then that thing stops and then it

256
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:04,750
would just crash off and then would
charge in from the other direction.

257
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,500
She ain't got to like circle around the
tree the other way and did that I think

258
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:10,780
three times that was just under.

259
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,990
It's like a horror movie where it keeps
coming in from different angles.

260
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,230
It was weird.
It was not a fun feeling.

261
00:13:17,231 --> 00:13:20,830
You just felt so small.
So you guys had come back to the carcass

262
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:24,220
that was hanging in the tree and it had
probably claim that carcass.

263
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,000
We don't know who he was there.
I,

264
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I assume now the weird thing was,
is it came in with the wind so the wind

265
00:13:34,751 --> 00:13:39,751
was blowing pretty stiff and say into
our face and the bear came in with the

266
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:44,200
wind so he wasn't going into the scent.
Normally they go around,

267
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:48,430
they catch the scent and they charge in.
So I don't know if you'd heard something

268
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,280
if he was there.
We saw what slightly looked like.

269
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:54,250
Bear sign.
Both Steve and Steve and I kind of

270
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,560
pointed it out,
but we weren't.

271
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:00,040
We were thinking maybe it was something
older you wouldn't you say bear sign?

272
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,940
You mean bear shit?
Yeah.

273
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:03,160
Bear Shit in the base of the tree.
Yeah.

274
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,820
And so I think we did some things that
are wrong,

275
00:14:06,821 --> 00:14:11,821
but in in the instance what saved us all
now if we were to do it 100 times over,

276
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:17,140
I would say I would do it differently,
but it worked out how it worked out.

277
00:14:17,141 --> 00:14:21,830
So I obviously wouldn't.
I would never opt to just have nothing

278
00:14:21,831 --> 00:14:25,810
and have this weird scatter effect.
But I think what saved everyone from

279
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,780
getting anyone from getting hurt,
which is a miracle,

280
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:33,970
was the fact that when we scattered it
just confused that bear because he kind

281
00:14:33,971 --> 00:14:37,540
of had this look after you started,
you started wheeling around kind of like

282
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,600
trying to pick a person trying to go and
he couldn't target one individual and

283
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:46,890
then things started hitting him and
somebody is on his back and I think it

284
00:14:46,891 --> 00:14:49,330
just freaked him out and he went off to
regroup,

285
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,220
keep charging back in,
but never made that full

286
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,410
charge all the way back in again.
Wow,

287
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:58,220
that's crazy.
How many people have ever gone through a

288
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:02,650
bear attack unscathed like that?
In a group of six and the.

289
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:06,800
And the thing about it was it wasn't
just a bear attack,

290
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:11,801
but had looking at it later,
had someone even been grabbed and mauled

291
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:17,330
to death but injured.
I think that it would have been very

292
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:20,840
unlikely that that person was survived
because we.

293
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,830
The weather that came in was so bad.
I don't know if it was a hundred mile an

294
00:15:24,831 --> 00:15:26,240
hour winds.
I mean,

295
00:15:26,241 --> 00:15:28,310
you aren't getting rescued in a hundred
mile an hour winds.

296
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,980
I wouldn't think.
I don't know those coast guard

297
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:33,140
helicopters.
I'm not really sure what they're capable

298
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:34,250
of.
Maybe someone would say,

299
00:15:34,251 --> 00:15:34,970
yeah,
we'd,

300
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,400
we'd go,
but that would be a very hard thing.

301
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,720
The gusts were so bad when we came back
over the ridge to our camp.

302
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,160
Now we're all on edge.
You just want to get back to camp to put

303
00:15:46,161 --> 00:15:47,240
it mildly.
Yeah.

304
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,380
Every now and then of course we see
bears on the way back and we're like,

305
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:52,970
thinking,
is this bear gun?

306
00:15:52,971 --> 00:15:55,760
Follow us this.
How many beds do you guys see on the way

307
00:15:55,761 --> 00:15:56,920
back?
One one another.

308
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,780
So we saw a bear on the front one.
Yeah,

309
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,350
I'm smaller,
but still after that.

310
00:16:03,351 --> 00:16:06,290
Yeah,
you're thinking now before that happened

311
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:06,951
were thinking,
no,

312
00:16:06,951 --> 00:16:09,470
bears will attack us.
After that happened were thinking every

313
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:14,060
bear will attack us and we start to go
over the ridge back toward camp.

314
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,910
I think at that point I was in the
front,

315
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:21,200
Steve and someone else was behind me.
As we go over this little saddle,

316
00:16:21,201 --> 00:16:23,870
the wind hits,
knocks the first three people over.

317
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:27,590
One of the guys have like a pack cover
on his pack,

318
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,540
ripped that off and just sent it in.

319
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,780
The never evers.
I mean it went up and it was crazy.

320
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:34,490
I've never seen anything blow away like
that.

321
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:39,140
It just went flying,
so then we get down the winds or gusting

322
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:42,680
the rain's pouring.
We look down the two main tensor

323
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:47,120
destroyed steve and I's tensor flopped
down on the ground.

324
00:16:47,121 --> 00:16:50,450
I see somebody,
a sleeping pad blowing away,

325
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,430
sleeping bags,
getting soaked.

326
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,550
So now we have a,
a real situation of hypothermia.

327
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,690
If the bear didn't get us,
this hypothermia might and we now no

328
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:01,610
longer have a camp that we can just go
to.

329
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:05,330
So we've been attacked by a bear.
Our camps destroy.

330
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,750
We get down there,
one of the tents is jacked up.

331
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:10,820
We take all the camp down,
relocate behind the spruce,

332
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:14,270
gather up everybody stuff.
Most of the guys sleeping bags or wet.

333
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:18,620
Uh,
we ended up like restringing the bear

334
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:22,610
fence around this new camp.
This is after you've just had a full day

335
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,240
and been attacked by a bear and by bear
fence.

336
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:27,660
You're talking about one of those
electric fencing?

337
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:28,790
Yeah,
that's a little electric.

338
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,300
How do those things work?
It's a battery operated deal.

339
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:36,440
You run electric fence.
It's a ribbon to electric fence,

340
00:17:36,441 --> 00:17:41,441
just like a cattle yard would have you
run that around and then it's just off

341
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:45,470
of I think six d batteries.
That's it.

342
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,410
Pulses and it just,
it tingles just a little bit.

343
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,190
It doesn't really.
If you touch

344
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,720
it,
it doesn't really light you up.

345
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,380
So I think they just,
I don't like that feeling,

346
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
especially if it got like their wet
nose.

347
00:17:57,001 --> 00:18:00,390
They might feel it with their nose first
and shocks them and gets them to run off

348
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,680
hopefully.
Yeah.

349
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I don't think I'd like cuddle up with a
dead carcass inside that fence.

350
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,380
I don't trust it that much,
but yeah,

351
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:12,480
it was,
it was just a nuts a day.

352
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,850
So how did you guys eventually set camp
back up?

353
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,510
So we,
there was a spruce that we're using and

354
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:22,230
we got behind that spruce tree and input
one of the GP tents up,

355
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:26,730
kind of tied it off to the spruce and
then Steve and I had too small a

356
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,430
backpacking tents that we put underneath
a few of the limbs,

357
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,610
cut out some limbs and got up under
there and it's still 100 mile an hour

358
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,260
winds.

359
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,070
Yeah,
70 to a hundred,

360
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,160
a hundred and something gusts out there.
And then uh,

361
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,520
some of the guys we actually cut
wouldn't stashed it under the tree

362
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,870
earlier.
So that was good.

363
00:18:45,871 --> 00:18:50,210
We had semi dry wood and we tried some
out in the tent before and the carpet

364
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,340
kind of fallen over it.
So we had a little bit of dry wood were

365
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,750
after a couple of hours we're able to
get a fire going inside the inside the

366
00:18:57,751 --> 00:19:01,140
tent
and then they could dry out some their

367
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:04,020
sleeping bags and stuff like that.
Jesus Christ,

368
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,440
it was crazy.
How long did it take before you guys got

369
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:09,000
off the island?
Um,

370
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:14,330
so what was,
I guess it would have been the next day

371
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:19,290
in the evening.
Did you get any sleep?

372
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,450
Yeah,
I slept pretty hard.

373
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,430
Wow.
I was ready for bed.

374
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,220
But how could you sleep knowing that?
The fucking things out there.

375
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,590
Yeah.
It's not like that for me.

376
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:31,910
It was Kinda,
it was Kinda.

377
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,890
I was thinking that was awesome.
We serve when it's over,

378
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,560
you're fine.
I was fine with it.

379
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,840
You didn't think like we're still on the
same island.

380
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:42,030
The same bear still there.
And we only walked like,

381
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,190
how many miles?
Only three miles.

382
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,090
Three miles.
It's nothing.

383
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,100
Yeah.
Firstly for a bear,

384
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,660
for a bear,
that wouldn't have been a problem for

385
00:19:48,661 --> 00:19:49,860
us.
It takes five,

386
00:19:49,861 --> 00:19:51,750
six hours,
seven hours or something like that.

387
00:19:51,751 --> 00:19:54,510
It was crazy.
But yeah.

388
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:59,250
And after it happened,
once we cleared the area I was okay,

389
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:03,090
but in the moment I thought,
this is it,

390
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,150
this is how I die.
It was a weird feeling.

391
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,930
I've had that feeling a few times in my
life and I just don't like that,

392
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,050
that helpless feeling of like thinking,
but what scares me the most is that

393
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:21,350
thought of thinking while you're dying.
You're thinking about that,

394
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:26,550
like while you're dying,
knowing that this is that last thought.

395
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:30,870
I don't like the idea that last thought,
like if I was hearing the plane and the

396
00:20:30,871 --> 00:20:33,000
plane's going down and you think,
well,

397
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:36,570
I know I'm going to die.
There's nothing I can do in those

398
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,700
thoughts that go through your head.
I don't like those thoughts.

399
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,350
Just not see it coming because those
thoughts are the worst part.

400
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,050
I've thought of that before,
like how do you deal those thoughts?

401
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,070
The feeling right before the plane hits
the ground,

402
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,923
right?
What?

403
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,060
What are your parachute doesn't go and
the same with the bear attack that bears

404
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,280
coming in.
You have no.

405
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:58,000
If you have a gun,
you're focused on your task and then if

406
00:20:58,001 --> 00:21:02,080
the bear got you crushed your head,
maybe you have that task to focus on,

407
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:05,080
but you're focusing on the inevitable is
going to happen.

408
00:21:05,081 --> 00:21:07,780
There's nothing I can do.
I don't like that thought.

409
00:21:07,781 --> 00:21:11,280
It's the worst.
They are crazy animals.

410
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,580
They're nuts.

411
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,020
Been a Adam Green tree who were talking
about before the podcast,

412
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,800
did this 28 day backpack trip in Montana
and Colorado and elk hunting in

413
00:21:23,821 --> 00:21:28,821
September and a solo all by himself and
took a bunch of instagram pictures and

414
00:21:29,491 --> 00:21:34,290
putting them on instagram story of him
holding up a pistol with a sow.

415
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:38,970
Grizzly standing on two legs,
looking at them in the distance while

416
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:42,240
it's snowing out and she got within 15
yards.

417
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,520
She bluff,
charged them within 15 yards.

418
00:21:44,521 --> 00:21:46,140
She's just trying to get them away from
her cubs.

419
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,240
Different situation than with with you
guys because the sow when they have the

420
00:21:51,241 --> 00:21:54,150
cubs will just try it.
They just don't want their kids to get

421
00:21:54,151 --> 00:21:57,030
fucked up by you.
They don't want you anywhere near them,

422
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,160
so they try to scare you off.
There's Adam.

423
00:21:59,200 --> 00:21:59,880
Yeah,
I remember.

424
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,910
Yeah,
I saw that.

425
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,810
That was crazy.
Yeah,

426
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:02,920
that was in Montana I think.

427
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,060
Look at the bottom,
bottom comments,

428
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,300
some dickhead Chutney.
Ninety four.

429
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:11,910
You are a current and then his next
comment.

430
00:22:11,911 --> 00:22:14,250
Hashtag Vegan.
Hashtag animal rights.

431
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,143
Hilarious.

432
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,880
You fucking idiots.
I hope that guy gets eaten.

433
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,530
Yeah,
it's really.

434
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,250
I don't really know what you get eaten
Chinese,

435
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:24,010
but you silly.
Fuck.

436
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:25,630
Yeah.
It's not a fun feeling.

437
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:30,580
Those bluff charges are still extremely
scary because you never know if that's

438
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:32,020
going to be the one.
Yeah.

439
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,420
They said

440
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,320
10 has had quite a few lately.
You know,

441
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:40,990
there was a really crazy video where the
guy had half his head hanging off,

442
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:44,170
like a scalp was hanging off his head
and he was explaining what happened and

443
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:49,060
bit his arm and he apparently was just
was just scouting

444
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,700
and that guy if I recollect right.
I think that was him.

445
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:58,150
He was kind of one of those guys that I
think even my taught classes on bear

446
00:22:58,821 --> 00:23:01,220
safety and other stuff like that.
And I think afterwards he said,

447
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,810
yeah,
it's a fucked up deal.

448
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,113
Happens.

449
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,450
Well,
he was lucky he had a backpack on

450
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:10,050
apparently because he was down and the
thing was just tearing them apart and.

451
00:23:10,051 --> 00:23:10,884
But he was,
you know,

452
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,670
pedal in the backpack.
So a few years ago when I was in Alaska,

453
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:19,480
I met this guy and he was an older guy,
I don't know if I talked about this

454
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,480
before,
but he was a older guy that was on that

455
00:23:22,481 --> 00:23:27,481
same island and he got attacked by a,
I think it was like an 11 foot brown

456
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:31,210
bear while you're skinning a deer and
killed the bear with a knife.

457
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,580
But he got destroyed.
Yeah.

458
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,120
Killed it with a buck knife.
He's,

459
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,070
he's probably 80 something now.
Uh,

460
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,820
there used to be.
I remembered reading stories about it

461
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:44,821
and outdoor life magazine when I was a
kid and then somehow I got to kind of

462
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,070
interview them and get

463
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,130
the whole story firsthand and recorded
it on a video and stuff.

464
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,370
Where's the video?
Um,

465
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,740
I've just got it on my hard drive.
I'll,

466
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,850
I'm going to do something with it.
Yeah,

467
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,340
I got it.
I'll put it out this year is cool.

468
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,900
How big was the knife?
Uh,

469
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,370
it was a 500.
Says yes.

470
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,190
Six inch buck knife,
something like that.

471
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,190
You know,
the black handle kind of almost like a.

472
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,740
yeah,
like a solid straight blade knife.

473
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:10,160
Yeah,
and the bear like attacked him.

474
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,950
He kept stabbing it,
fighting it off.

475
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,740
Um,
what does this.

476
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,550
Yeah,
that's the video.

477
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,960
That's your video.
No,

478
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:19,550
that's not my video.
Oh,

479
00:24:19,551 --> 00:24:20,960
that's the guy.
That's the guy.

480
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,710
That little tiny knife,
that little thing.

481
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,200
Oh my God,
that's not a big knife.

482
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,390
No.
So where did he kill it?

483
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,810
Uh,
he stabbed it.

484
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,390
It was like he kept getting it in neck
and then the bear would go off and then

485
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:38,900
charge him again.

486
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,930
And then finally the bear went off.
He said it was pretty sick,

487
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:45,770
like getting wobbly every time you
attack it'd be less and less.

488
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,320
And then I think he actually grabbed his
rifle and shot it last time we,

489
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,280
a bear was laying there because he was
able to get the bear away.

490
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,870
He was,
he,

491
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,470
he was really fucked up.
And there's a part of the story.

492
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,860
So there's a cabin there that I've
actually been by.

493
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,870
They got him to that cabin and they had
the cabin.

494
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:10,871
They have these things called Arctic
doors where it's a to keep the cold out

495
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:14,510
when you open the door,
it's like a two door system.

496
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,030
Well,
the way that the Arctic doors set up,

497
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:23,530
the emergency responders couldn't get a
Gurney in there,

498
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,490
so the owner of the cab and rips out a
chainsaw and cuts his wall open low to

499
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:36,230
get say I mean saved his life because
then they got the Gurney in the coast

500
00:25:36,231 --> 00:25:37,064
guard got him out.

501
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,540
He was in the hospital for a long time.
Skin graft after skin graph and all

502
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:45,680
kinds of surgeries and he survived.
The problem with those stories is that

503
00:25:45,681 --> 00:25:47,920
gives me hope.
I always have these stupid fantasies,

504
00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:49,700
like if a mountain lion ever comes after
me,

505
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,670
I'm going to stab it in the net.
You want to put my arm in its mouth and

506
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,240
think about.
Yeah.

507
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,950
You think about all that stuff until
it's just right on top of you.

508
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,030
Yeah.
Oh Shit.

509
00:26:02,031 --> 00:26:04,530
None of this is going to work.
I'm looking up at the thousand pounds,

510
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,650
so I think.
No Way.

511
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,840
I think we're.
I mean,

512
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:12,530
I know we're really weak,
like we were so weak,

513
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:15,370
you know,
strong person is really,

514
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:16,640
really.
Exactly.

515
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,010
You feel really strong up until the
point.

516
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,250
This breaths on you.
I'm going to happen.

517
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,870
When I was on news radio,
we did a scene once with a chimpanzee.

518
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,480
I don't know everything you've ever made
air.

519
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,700
I think it got edited out,
but we had a baby chimp.

520
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,120
It was a tiny champ like I think it
might've even had a diaper on,

521
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,950
but this little chimp I'm was like two
years old or something like that and it

522
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:42,560
was on top of me playing around with me,
you know,

523
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:44,070
like you want hold them accountable,
hold

524
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:49,070
it and I'm holding it and it
just hits me a couple times on the back.

525
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:53,400
Just fucking decides to smack me a
little bit like a puppy and I just

526
00:26:53,401 --> 00:26:57,760
couldn't believe how fucking strong this
little thing I had in my mind like,

527
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,860
like you think of a chimp that's like 30
pounds or 50 pounds.

528
00:27:01,861 --> 00:27:02,131
You Go,
oh,

529
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:05,010
that's like a person that's 30 pounds or
50 pounds.

530
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:09,930
Like it is a totally different thing.
Like it's body was hard,

531
00:27:09,931 --> 00:27:13,020
like would like,
it felt like this table,

532
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,200
like everything was hard.
Like you have it in your mind like,

533
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:19,890
oh that skin and muscle,
that's like my skin and muscle.

534
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,850
No,
no.

535
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,200
Crazy.
There's so.

536
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:25,200
There's so much stronger and they ain't
shit compared to a bear

537
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:31,140
little baby chimpanzee in a day.
It's so crazy how weak we are.

538
00:27:31,141 --> 00:27:33,990
I mean,
it's amazing how our brains and the

539
00:27:33,991 --> 00:27:37,620
development of our intellect and our
ability to use tools and houses have

540
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:41,880
protected us from all these animals.
And I wonder what we used to be like.

541
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,030
I was thinking about that the other day
and I was kind of debating in my head

542
00:27:47,031 --> 00:27:52,031
whether our tools.
I think our tools are the only thing we

543
00:27:52,161 --> 00:27:53,510
hide behind him.
Oh,

544
00:27:53,511 --> 00:27:55,070
for sure.
I think that's the only thing that kept

545
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:56,180
us alive for so long.

546
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:00,680
I wonder what we used to be like though.
I wonder if before the tools we were

547
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:03,380
more like the chimps,
maybe why we,

548
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:03,790
we,
uh,

549
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,460
we were showing photos of Australia
[inaudible],

550
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:10,130
which is like one of the oldest human
beings and it looks kinda like a chimp

551
00:28:10,131 --> 00:28:10,970
person,
you know,

552
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,000
it's all covered in hair.
Oh,

553
00:28:13,001 --> 00:28:15,230
I'm sure they,
they weren't very big.

554
00:28:15,231 --> 00:28:17,690
You know,
it's about chimps size,

555
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,680
maybe a little bit of the underdog.
The underdog is apparently we're only

556
00:28:21,681 --> 00:28:24,380
like five feet tall,
but they weighed 200 pounds.

557
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,830
Really?
Yeah.

558
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,833
Five,
four,

559
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,000
maybe something like that.
Probably guerrilla type drink.

560
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,740
Stupid Jack.
Giant bones like probably waste stronger

561
00:28:33,741 --> 00:28:35,060
than us.
Yeah,

562
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,370
that's crazy.
Yeah.

563
00:28:37,371 --> 00:28:42,371
We just figured out a way to build stuff
and I guess we just got soft.

564
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,170
Yeah.
And the way it's amazing that we made it

565
00:28:45,171 --> 00:28:48,190
this far though.
What do you think bears like that and

566
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,890
all the various animals that we must
have encountered along the way.

567
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,580
I think that's why when the pioneers
came West,

568
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,470
they thought,
let's get rid of all the bears.

569
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,490
I see why they got rid of the bears.
Imagine those guys back then cruising

570
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:07,870
crossed the plains and constantly being
attacked constantly.

571
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,590
They had a legit fear of bears.
Oh yeah.

572
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:15,910
Because it wasn't.
We don't understand it in our society of

573
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:21,100
having these natural predators be actual
threats to you in your daily life.

574
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:21,811
Yeah.
Well,

575
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:23,970
not only that,
but back then they didn't even have like

576
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:26,820
a real legit map of the territory.
No,

577
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,160
they were just trying to figure it out
as they went along.

578
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,700
Cruising around,
stumbling in the stomach thing and yeah.

579
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,870
Well the last guy in California to be
killed by a bear.

580
00:29:36,871 --> 00:29:40,140
They named the town after him.
It's a out near Bakersfield.

581
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:43,090
It was the last guy in California to get
killed by a grizzly bear,

582
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,380
which is interesting is that's the
California state flag as a grizzly bear

583
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:48,610
on it,
but we killed all of them.

584
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,230
You're like,
fuck this.

585
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,600
Well,
I feel like the California grizzly bears

586
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,910
I.
This is just from my opinion,

587
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,880
it would have been semi coastal,
so they would've been very similar to

588
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:02,560
the brown bears with a mild climate.
They probably would not have needed to

589
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,410
hibernate,
like they would have been very large

590
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:06,244
bears.

591
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:10,320
We should reintroduce him though.
I'm all for that.

592
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,790
Well,
I think there's probably some people

593
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:13,930
that would agree with you.
Yeah.

594
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:17,770
A lot of the people that want to
reintroduce wolves everywhere I say for

595
00:30:17,771 --> 00:30:19,390
everyone they reintroduced somewhere
else.

596
00:30:19,391 --> 00:30:21,580
Let's reintroduce a bear somewhere.
You know,

597
00:30:21,581 --> 00:30:26,050
in the Monterrey San Francisco area
where they naturally were all those

598
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,600
cmos.
Jesus Christ.

599
00:30:28,601 --> 00:30:30,940
Imagine I couldn't.
I couldn't.

600
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,120
Yeah,
I think people really have no idea what

601
00:30:34,121 --> 00:30:36,940
that is.
They think of it as some sort of a thing

602
00:30:36,941 --> 00:30:38,970
that they've seen on,
you know,

603
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,780
the discovery channel or some cool
youtube video or you see them wandering

604
00:30:43,781 --> 00:30:46,330
to the fields,
but until you're there with it,

605
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,190
well it was going to say about with Adam
said,

606
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,220
like Adam said,
he's like Mike.

607
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:54,340
He goes,
he gets a fucking monster monster.

608
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,420
He goes,
he goes,

609
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:57,040
people are out there looking for
monsters.

610
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,510
He goes,
that fucking real.

611
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,700
He goes most as a real.
He goes,

612
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,680
he goes,
it's not their fault that the monsters

613
00:31:02,681 --> 00:31:06,400
put that fucking month is the worst.
Adam Green spot on impression,

614
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:08,410
that was exactly like him.
He's around me.

615
00:31:08,411 --> 00:31:11,260
I could do it better.
Might have that thing where they talk.

616
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:16,290
Well at the end they've always goes up,
but he was talking about out.

617
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:22,080
It was charging him from 15 yards.
He could see the muscles and the hair

618
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:25,570
was standing straight up and it was
looking at him and rippling and he was

619
00:31:25,571 --> 00:31:28,750
saying is this it?
And then he found out later that the gun

620
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:31,030
had the wrong bullets in it.
That's crazy.

621
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,930
So the bullets were too big for the gun
and the only way it would have worked as

622
00:31:34,931 --> 00:31:36,640
if he got one in the chamber.
He had,

623
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:39,070
he couldn't cock it to put one in the
chamber.

624
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,640
He would have had to individually put
one in the chamber and then who had had

625
00:31:42,641 --> 00:31:43,480
one shot?
Yeah,

626
00:31:43,481 --> 00:31:45,590
that wouldn't work too.
Oh yeah.

627
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,490
The weird.
I remember it almost seemed like slow

628
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,560
motion.
The way that hair is just waving back

629
00:31:50,561 --> 00:31:52,600
and forth.
This shouldn't be locking eyes with it.

630
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,950
I just saw one grizzly once ever in the
wild at close range in Alberta and it

631
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:01,600
wasn't a big one.
It was like maybe six,

632
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,510
six and a half feet,
but they'll look.

633
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:07,030
It gave me,
was so different than,

634
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,690
look black bears give you.
Yeah.

635
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:11,430
This is the zero fucks look.
They just know.

636
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,650
You just look at you.
They look through you through you.

637
00:32:14,651 --> 00:32:17,330
Yeah.
Look at you like your food to figure out

638
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:19,480
if it was going to eat me and how it was
going to eat me.

639
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,640
It wasn't looking at me like I was
scary.

640
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:24,400
Like black bears look at you like,
what are you doing man?

641
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,160
I'm like,
can I come over here?

642
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,800
They bought smell you.
I'm Outta here.

643
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,030
And then they take off.
But the,

644
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,720
the grizzly was just looking at me like
these marble eyes like black.

645
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,500
Yup.
Those eyes man dead.

646
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,360
They are dead eyes man.
Like Shark

647
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,193
eyes.
Yup.

648
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,553
Yeah,
it's nuts.

649
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,663
They,
uh,

650
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,280
with all the ones,
all the videos you see bears tear in.

651
00:32:46,281 --> 00:32:49,790
That cap might preserve where they've
just eating fish and they're chomping.

652
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:51,800
Oh,
the young ones because they have food.

653
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,670
Now.
Imagine,

654
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:55,790
imagine if you just took all those fish
away and put one person there.

655
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:59,030
That's the look that those bears would
have just completely changed.

656
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:00,140
Yeah,
we.

657
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,320
We showed a video of that.
Pull that video up.

658
00:33:03,321 --> 00:33:06,660
Jamie have that.
There's a crazy video of this guy who's

659
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,830
a photographer who's taking pictures of
what it looks like.

660
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:14,860
15 plus brown bears and this one river
and one of them walks up beside them and

661
00:33:15,651 --> 00:33:18,500
just sits down,
like literally sit down about 10 feet

662
00:33:18,501 --> 00:33:22,640
away and apparently this one particular
area is so rich with salmon.

663
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,680
No one's ever been killed there.
Yeah,

664
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,510
that's.
That's probably the.

665
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,710
I think it's kept my preserve.
I think that that's what they call it,

666
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:31,850
but now you have to get permits because
it's just such a popular place.

667
00:33:31,851 --> 00:33:35,180
You go and you fly in there and you just
take pictures of the bears and they're

668
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:36,890
just.
They have so much food and there are so

669
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:40,640
habituated that they don't.
But if you took the food source away,

670
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,683
yeah.
This is it.

671
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,530
Look at the size of that thing.
See that gun sitting there?

672
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,050
That's not what you want to do.
I've decided,

673
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:50,780
yeah,
that seems like an issue.

674
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:52,770
It's

675
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:54,060
go over and grab that gun,
you know,

676
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:58,740
buddy for your launch or you'd be.
You'd be so crushed before he even got

677
00:33:58,741 --> 00:34:00,660
to that and it's given me some volumes
so you could see it

678
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:04,520
here at breathing.
Let me that thing.

679
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:09,310
Fucking arms on that thing.
What is the name of this video,

680
00:34:09,311 --> 00:34:10,720
Jamie?
So we can give the people credit.

681
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,440
Says bear sits next to guy
it just sitting now.

682
00:34:18,031 --> 00:34:20,600
Is that bigger or smaller than the bear
that attacked you guys?

683
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,360
That's probably smaller.
Jesus Christ.

684
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:24,823
Yeah,
that's.

685
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,800
Leave that thing.
I mean that's.

686
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:30,830
That's a like,
that's not a very old bear there to see.

687
00:34:30,921 --> 00:34:34,850
I was chest is kind of smaller up in the
top I guess.

688
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,150
Yeah.
This video freaks me the fuck out

689
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:41,150
though,
that this bear was just sitting right

690
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:43,010
next to this guy,
but I mean you look at that and they

691
00:34:43,011 --> 00:34:44,980
just look so peaceful.
Nice.

692
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,020
You wouldn't ever think it's two
completely different worlds.

693
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:53,021
When you go to somewhere like this.
Now you see how close that thing is now

694
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,990
in that video,
it just looks like a docile,

695
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,910
fuzzy animal.
Now Watch this,

696
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,140
look down there
bed so crazy.

697
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,120
That is literally like 15

698
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:08,090
huge fucking bears.
Just pulling salmon out of that river.

699
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:08,983
Yeah,
that's not.

700
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,660
Yeah,
I mean I think they're beautiful.

701
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,240
I think they're amazing and I'm glad
they're there,

702
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:19,420
but it disturbs me to no end that people
don't really understand what they are

703
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:23,210
and they treat them as if there's some
sort of a mythical creature in some

704
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:28,211
Disneyland movie and they don't.
They don't understand conservation and

705
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:31,700
controlling their populations,
which is what they did understand when

706
00:35:31,701 --> 00:35:33,650
they killed them all out of California.
They were like,

707
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:35,660
look,
people are getting fucking killed at a

708
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:38,280
regular basis.
This is a is a real problem

709
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,390
and now British Columbia's in this weird
situation,

710
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:47,070
my friend Michael Hockridge lives up in
the woods in British Columbia.

711
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:50,640
He lives in the real,
the real BC,

712
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,090
but the population centers,
all Vancouver Vancouver,

713
00:35:54,091 --> 00:35:56,670
which is this amazing city,
great restaurants and everybody's like,

714
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,230
what killed baron?
Fuck that.

715
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:01,860
You don't need to kill the bears,
but if you fly in to where my friend

716
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,170
Mike Lives and talk,
those people out there,

717
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,730
they can,
first of all,

718
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:07,950
they can hunt as many wolves as they
want.

719
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:10,410
You could shoot 100 loaves a day.
Yeah.

720
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:11,990
There's no lack of wolves.
There is.

721
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,160
They're everywhere.
We heard them,

722
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:15,121
you know,
I didn't,

723
00:36:15,121 --> 00:36:17,850
I didn't see one when I was up there,
but you could hear him off in the

724
00:36:17,851 --> 00:36:20,910
distance,
but he said that he's got one in his

725
00:36:20,911 --> 00:36:24,840
house that jumped at him.
He shot in the air,

726
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:26,760
jumping off of a ridge at him.

727
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:27,840
Wow.
Yeah.

728
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:32,841
He was making a Predator call and this
wolf closed in on him and literally

729
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,160
jumped at him and he shot it in the air.
So in his house he's got his house like

730
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:42,420
this.
He's got the wolf mounted like in the

731
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:44,610
same position it was in when it was
trying to eat him.

732
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,050
Yeah,
that's great.

733
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,260
People.
People have to realize that like,

734
00:36:49,261 --> 00:36:51,240
I love wolves,
don't get me wrong,

735
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,960
but you know,
once I started hunting and then I

736
00:36:54,961 --> 00:36:59,100
started really looking into wildlife
conservation and then the consequences

737
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:02,340
of letting apex predators get out of
control.

738
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:03,510
Like it's scary.

739
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,080
Yeah.
Yeah.

740
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,860
The,
the wolves I've never really been afraid

741
00:37:07,861 --> 00:37:10,260
of,
but I did one time I was in Idaho is

742
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:15,261
springtime and I heard something in the
real thick brush again and here's

743
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:22,930
something and all of a sudden this wolf
pops out like five or six feet away,

744
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,990
just fold dead run.
And I like freak out.

745
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:30,360
Hey,
I was about ready to kick it and it

746
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:34,950
veered off the path and then I hear and
then another one comes running in and I

747
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:39,720
grabbed my gun and shooting the ground,
not when it like from me to you,

748
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:41,040
Jesus Christ.
And uh,

749
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,320
and it ran off.
But I didn't know.

750
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:47,610
My initial thought was they were just
chasing each other playing and I just

751
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:50,610
happened to be in their way,
but I don't know,

752
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,400
you might've been lunch.
Who knows?

753
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,240
And maybe I scared it because I had
this.

754
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,480
Well,
they hung them in Idaho,

755
00:37:57,481 --> 00:37:59,400
so they probably,
this was before you can hunt them.

756
00:37:59,460 --> 00:37:59,851
Oh,
okay.

757
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:01,410
I was just an,
I had a,

758
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,970
you know,
like got my gun off after the first one

759
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:04,804
was just thinking,
well,

760
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,690
I don't know what's going on here,
but just in case some trays,

761
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:08,850
you know,

762
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:11,360
John has a crazy story.
You ever talked to him about it?

763
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,500
No,
we talked to.

764
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,040
He told us on the podcast.
But um,

765
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,340
there's a video if anybody wants to
listen to the actual story on the

766
00:38:17,341 --> 00:38:18,300
podcast,
you can find it.

767
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:20,610
But he shot a wolf.
Excuse me.

768
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,640
He shot an elk in a pc,
you know,

769
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,740
and uh,
oh no.

770
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:30,750
Our Alberta Alberta thing was Alberta
shot an elk and um,

771
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,680
didn't realize that where the elk went
down was literally right in a wolf's

772
00:38:36,701 --> 00:38:37,930
den.
Oh Wow.

773
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,650
There was these bones around and shit.
It was literally like a scene from that

774
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:42,510
movie,
the gray,

775
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,880
like it's like broken jack bottles.
So it was him and John only has a four

776
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:51,610
Arrow quiver,
right?

777
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:54,190
Yeah.
He shot one arrow which used to take

778
00:38:54,191 --> 00:38:57,340
down the elk.
So he's got three hours left and he's

779
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:00,160
got a guide with them and the guide has
a rifle,

780
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,560
but the guide only has a handful of
bullets.

781
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,500
He's got like three or four bullets.
So they're standing there,

782
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,900
they're trying to take this elk out
there,

783
00:39:07,901 --> 00:39:10,720
quartering it up,
and then we'll start circling them and

784
00:39:10,721 --> 00:39:13,870
howling and then they realize like,
oh fuck,

785
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:19,440
like we're literally in the wolf's den
and one wolf makes a dead run out of

786
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,250
them.
He kills it with his bow.

787
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,030
Another wolf makes a dead run at it.
They shoot it,

788
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,110
another wolf comes down,
he shoots it with the rifle.

789
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:33,880
So John is shot to have his bow and the
other guy shot one with a rifle.

790
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,050
John's down to one Arrow and the other
guy has like maybe two bullets.

791
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,150
Wow.
And they're freaking the fuck out.

792
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,210
They have their back to a tree and
wolves are circling them and they're

793
00:39:43,211 --> 00:39:45,700
howling because they've already lost
three wolves.

794
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:49,270
Yeah.
So he's literally getting charged by

795
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:53,000
wolves with his back to a tree with a
giant elk carcass behind them that

796
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:53,890
they're trying to claim.

797
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,630
That's crazy.
Crazy.

798
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,260
He said the Alpha male was standing on a
ridge.

799
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:00,950
He drew back,
uh,

800
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,620
on the,
on the wolf.

801
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:04,690
The Wolf looked at him and bolted and
took off in.

802
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,290
The rest of them took off.
Yeah,

803
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:10,570
but he said they were circling them
howling from like doing like a roll

804
00:40:10,571 --> 00:40:12,700
call.
I try to see who's still alive like

805
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:16,690
what's going on here,
but even after a gunshot and two of them

806
00:40:16,691 --> 00:40:18,880
killed with arrows,
they were still chart.

807
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,680
That's crazy.
Fuck Huh.

808
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,370
Two great story.
It's terrifying.

809
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,620
But just to let you know,
like people think,

810
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,690
oh well was don't harm people.
In World War II,

811
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:35,170
the Russians and the Germans had to call
a ceasefire because so many people were

812
00:40:35,171 --> 00:40:38,260
getting killed by wolves.
They decided to call a ceasefire,

813
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:41,080
killed a wolves,
and then go back to killing each other.

814
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,110
That's crazy.
It's a crazy story.

815
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:48,170
World War One or two.
I think it's one to the two like fed on

816
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:50,440
the dead people.
Well,

817
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:54,790
I think there were so many wolves like
Siberia or Russia or wherever the fuck

818
00:40:54,791 --> 00:40:56,350
they were.
There's a lot of walls,

819
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,450
you know,
and they don't give a shit if you're a

820
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:01,780
person or a chicken and they're here to
just go for it.

821
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:02,710
Yeah,
I mean it's cold.

822
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,713
It's tough.
Tough.

823
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,650
Tough living is one.
It was one.

824
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,810
So where we're one.
Yeah.

825
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:09,930
But um,
but it's a confirmed story.

826
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:14,050
I mean they were just,
guys would go out on scouts and they

827
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:16,990
would just vanished and then they find a
boot with like half a foot still in it

828
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:20,500
and like fuck.
And people don't realize like a wolf can

829
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,320
cut through an elk bone with its teeth.

830
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:24,420
Yeah.
When you,

831
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:29,050
when you see a wolf actually take down
and now it's pretty impressive if you've

832
00:41:29,051 --> 00:41:29,801
seen it live.
Yeah,

833
00:41:29,801 --> 00:41:32,220
I've seen it.
I've seen a single scene,

834
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:36,470
a single take down,
a spike elk ones.

835
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,200
And what it did was just so fast to.
It ran in and ran it downhill.

836
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,480
They're so smart too,
but it was the ELC was on a ridge.

837
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,350
The Wolf start chasing it down and it
starts chasing the elk through what we

838
00:41:51,351 --> 00:41:53,630
call dead,
where a bunch of trees have fallen over.

839
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:57,590
So the ELC has to exert itself and jump
over things and then the wolves would

840
00:41:57,591 --> 00:42:01,250
come in and bite its back legs and that
how old was so fast,

841
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,280
it could run almost between its legs.
Is that elks running?

842
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,420
I mean it was crazy.
And then it got it stomach open so it's

843
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:12,980
dragging its guts and then the,
the elk finally would get its guts

844
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,670
caught on the trees that it was going
over and then got it by the neck and

845
00:42:16,671 --> 00:42:20,450
just held it until it died.
When you saw this from,

846
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,140
how far away?
Um,

847
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,560
I don't know,
probably 300 yards maybe.

848
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,493
Wow.
Yeah,

849
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:27,530
a lot of it.
Some of it you couldn't see,

850
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,300
you know,
it'd be because it was a hill across

851
00:42:29,301 --> 00:42:30,230
from me.
So you could see it,

852
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:33,160
you lose it in the timber and then it
come out in the patch and then it was

853
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:35,840
right below us and then we just kinda
backed out and left it to them.

854
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,460
Dudley saw a grizzly bear swat the moose
down with one shot.

855
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,680
Really?
He said that the grizzly literally

856
00:42:42,681 --> 00:42:43,371
lifted up.
It's.

857
00:42:43,371 --> 00:42:47,420
Paul was chasing the Moose and slammed
it on the Moose back and broke.

858
00:42:47,421 --> 00:42:48,380
It's back.
We're going,

859
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,390
yeah.
That's how strong a fucking grizzly

860
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,550
bears.
He said you couldn't use it.

861
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,480
It's like to to see it is like to see it
as one thing,

862
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,690
but to try to describe it as like
there's no way I want to describe

863
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,480
because the amount of power that thing
had and it's Paul.

864
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,000
He goes,
it just gives you a totally different

865
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:06,740
perception of what it's capable of.
You know,

866
00:43:06,741 --> 00:43:10,310
you have an idea while the grizzlies big
and the Moose is big kind of a bra.

867
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:12,110
Nope.
Swats it.

868
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,540
Boom.
Just snap down.

869
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:17,090
Most just went like he got shot.
That's crazy.

870
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,700
Yeah.
When you see the power of you think,

871
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,583
yeah,
I don't know.

872
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,060
The whole getting scratched things
probably that's not happening and

873
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:26,060
getting scratched.
You're getting tore up.

874
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:31,070
So in BC they've recently,
they passed two laws.

875
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:34,160
The first law they pass,
they were going to outlaw trophy hunts.

876
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:37,910
So what they said is,
because eating black bear is a

877
00:43:37,911 --> 00:43:39,890
traditional thing.
A lot of people eat black pair and a lot

878
00:43:39,891 --> 00:43:43,160
of people that are that don't hunt or
don't have anything to do with hunting.

879
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:45,440
Don't know this,
but black bear is eaten by a lot of

880
00:43:45,441 --> 00:43:46,274
people.
Yeah.

881
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:49,940
Grizzly bears not eating as much,
but some people eat it.

882
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,920
A lot of the indigenous people eat it or
whether they call first nations in

883
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,850
Canada day,
they'll eat brown bear,

884
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,000
some of them will,
but they decided no more quote unquote

885
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:05,780
trophy hunts so you can't keep the skin
and you couldn't keep the head,

886
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,760
but you could keep the meat.
Okay.

887
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,540
So it was a weird,
weird law that got passed and people

888
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,230
like,
well that doesn't make any sense because

889
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,670
people.
I understand that they would want the

890
00:44:16,671 --> 00:44:18,890
people to only hunt for meat.
That makes sense,

891
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,540
but why not allow them to keep the skull
and keep the Cape and all that other

892
00:44:23,541 --> 00:44:24,610
stuff too.
And it was useful.

893
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,483
It's wasteful.
Yeah.

894
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:29,750
Then they changed it entirely and they
said no grizzly hunts at all and it was

895
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,080
really quickly the one,
one law changed and

896
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:34,760
changed and they based it on a really
small sampling like the,

897
00:44:34,761 --> 00:44:36,840
the um,
they had like a,

898
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:39,840
I think it was an email sample.
Pretty Bowman has a thing on it.

899
00:44:39,841 --> 00:44:43,640
They did a podcast on it,
but they explained how it went down that

900
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,230
it wasn't,
they said 75 percent of the population

901
00:44:46,231 --> 00:44:48,060
degrees,
but it's not really 75 percent of the

902
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:50,370
population.
Seventy five percent of the 3000 people

903
00:44:50,371 --> 00:44:55,371
that got responded to the email and,
or online petition or whatever the fuck

904
00:44:56,011 --> 00:44:58,470
it was,
but they have a problem now.

905
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:00,630
These people that actually live there,
like my friend Mike,

906
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:02,130
it's like,
okay,

907
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:03,390
if you're,
if you're not going to control the

908
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:05,880
populations of them,
like Mike had to shoot one that

909
00:45:05,881 --> 00:45:09,720
literally had its face in his cabin.
He opened the door.

910
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:12,540
It was literally,
he shot it like we're literally right

911
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:15,750
there where you are.
It was trying to come in his cabin and

912
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:16,584
he shot it.

913
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,160
Yeah.
I think that the reason there's,

914
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:24,470
I've I've heard that there's more people
are attacked or affected by black bears

915
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:29,030
and grizzly bears or brown bears,
but it's just not as many people live in

916
00:45:29,031 --> 00:45:32,840
proximity to them.
If you put a major metropolitan area in

917
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,400
the middle of fog,
neck island,

918
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:37,790
people will be getting jacked all the
time.

919
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,990
Yeah,
and that's what's going on.

920
00:45:39,991 --> 00:45:41,640
Also in Montana,
I mean when,

921
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:45,870
when these most recent attacks,
it's just because there's a large

922
00:45:45,871 --> 00:45:50,280
population of bears there and you can
hunt them and the good thing is that

923
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:53,700
people hunted them almost to the brink
of extinction and now through

924
00:45:53,701 --> 00:45:56,430
conservation they brought them back to
the point where they're no longer

925
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:59,490
endangered,
but there's the dispute between the

926
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:04,260
animal rights people and the wildlife
biologist and the hunters and you know,

927
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,490
trying to figure out what,
what,

928
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,700
what,
how big does the population you have to

929
00:46:08,701 --> 00:46:12,060
be before you realize that you have to
chop some of them down.

930
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,790
Like you don't.
Nobody wants to eliminate grizzly bears,

931
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,280
but you don't want 100,000 grizzly bears
in the metropolitan thing

932
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,920
area.
Yeah.

933
00:46:20,921 --> 00:46:22,000
And it's,
it's a weird.

934
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:24,400
It's kind of a weird balance when you
check them out,

935
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,910
hunting an animal populations,
and then you throw in predators,

936
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:33,270
because I don't think a lot of people
even understand how humans have affected

937
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,140
the environment in such a negative way
that nothing will ever be as it was,

938
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,430
right?
People go,

939
00:46:39,431 --> 00:46:42,760
oh,
well the predators will control the prey

940
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:45,940
populations,
and so why would we need to control the

941
00:46:45,941 --> 00:46:47,070
predators?
Well,

942
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,930
we,
we've upset the balance in such a way

943
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:53,710
that if we don't insert ourself into the
equation,

944
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:58,711
which is far as we know humans have been
in the equation,

945
00:46:59,111 --> 00:47:03,610
hunting since the animals that are in
currently in North America have been

946
00:47:03,611 --> 00:47:05,710
around.
Brown birds have always been hunted by

947
00:47:05,711 --> 00:47:07,120
humans.
You know,

948
00:47:07,121 --> 00:47:09,010
when you're looking at the way things
were,

949
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,700
I mean indigenous people on it.
Um,

950
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,700
people before,
you know,

951
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,020
settlers and whatever came in the bears
were being hunted.

952
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,000
So humans,
we're always a natural Predator of the

953
00:47:19,001 --> 00:47:22,450
bears.
But the way that humans have affected

954
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:27,130
the landscape between obviously taking
up habitat and habitat and the number

955
00:47:27,131 --> 00:47:31,750
one thing is habitat is gone.
Invasive plant species is crazy.

956
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,600
The type of plants that grow in places
they shouldn't be.

957
00:47:34,601 --> 00:47:38,320
Now we'll never get rid of those plants.
So because those plants are there,

958
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,730
native plants that the animals
originally should be eating off of don't

959
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:45,640
exist.
They out competed by noxious weeds and

960
00:47:45,641 --> 00:47:48,490
other things.
So the amount of food sources smaller.

961
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,240
So then the,
the prey population cannot there.

962
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:56,440
They've lost their winter range because
of developments and other things.

963
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,300
And then if you just inserted it and
said,

964
00:47:58,301 --> 00:48:00,160
well,
all the predators will take care of

965
00:48:00,161 --> 00:48:02,920
those numbers still.
Well that's not true because the numbers

966
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:07,240
can't get to what they were because
there's less availability starting at

967
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:11,650
the bottom level of food source and
winter range and habitat.

968
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:13,750
So what do you do about that?
I mean,

969
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:16,560
is that,
is it possible to kill all the invasive

970
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:17,394
plants?
No,

971
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:19,110
it's not possible.
Not even close.

972
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,003
No.

973
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:23,230
I mean there's.
There's no way that like where I'm from

974
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:27,070
Nevada,
he talked about invasive plants.

975
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,550
There's species of grass cheat grass
fires,

976
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:32,740
wiped through the native grasses.
Can't compete with that.

977
00:48:32,741 --> 00:48:36,040
So the cheat grass takes over.
It has less nutrients and doesn't have

978
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:39,280
the same type of browse that the native
deer and whatever species,

979
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:43,630
deer and elk need mostly meal deer cheat
grass coming from.

980
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,970
Somebody brought it over because of was
ornamental and it's just gone rampant.

981
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:52,270
Most of our plants aren't native plants
now it.

982
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,393
Oh yeah.
You look at.

983
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:56,560
Yeah.
Most of the plants that take over or are

984
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:58,840
invasive plants.
Yeah.

985
00:48:58,841 --> 00:49:01,640
Our countries primarily invasive
species.

986
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,550
Maybe someone will call me out on that.
Say That's not true,

987
00:49:03,551 --> 00:49:06,220
but there's more invasive plants.
The native plants.

988
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,300
That's crazy.
Yeah.

989
00:49:07,301 --> 00:49:09,640
The grasses,
most of the grasses that we have around

990
00:49:09,641 --> 00:49:13,720
aren't from the regions.
Kentucky bluegrass in California.

991
00:49:13,721 --> 00:49:14,350
Does it make sense?

992
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:15,790
Well,
it's always fascinating to me when an

993
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:19,270
animal gets into an area where it
doesn't have natural predators,

994
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,330
like a nutria.
Yeah.

995
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,130
Like nutri is down south and they just
have to hunt those things.

996
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:26,500
Like all over the place.
These giant rat thing.

997
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:27,580
Yeah.
Well,

998
00:49:27,581 --> 00:49:28,110
I was just.

999
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,730
We're in Maui hunting access,
dear said,

1000
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:34,140
the populations,
they're just have exploded.

1001
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:34,800
Oh yeah.
It was.

1002
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,680
No,
they don't have predators and all the

1003
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,040
native species actually are being
negatively affected by the invasive

1004
00:49:43,321 --> 00:49:44,010
species.

1005
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,210
Now,
were you there?

1006
00:49:45,211 --> 00:49:46,150
Um,
how,

1007
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:48,600
how recently?
Was this yesterday?

1008
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:49,440
Yesterday.
Yeah.

1009
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,400
Oh,
so you just got back?

1010
00:49:50,401 --> 00:49:51,061
Yeah,
well I got back.

1011
00:49:51,061 --> 00:49:54,240
What is it like in relationship to where
we hunted in Lanai?

1012
00:49:54,790 --> 00:49:56,680
It's very,
it's very similar.

1013
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,090
Different,
different terrain,

1014
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,810
little more mountainous terrain.
Um,

1015
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,350
so probably kind of cooler.
Yeah,

1016
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:03,700
lot of lava,
a lot.

1017
00:50:03,701 --> 00:50:07,450
A lot of rock and cliffs and some other
stuff that goes to the ocean.

1018
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:09,100
Um,
and then there's,

1019
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:12,040
there's kind of all different.
There's more of a dry side of the

1020
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,740
island.
It's more of that law of a type terrain.

1021
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,110
And you've got bamboo forest on the
other side.

1022
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,860
Once the deer get into that thick bamboo
type forest,

1023
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:23,680
they'll never eradicate them.
Same with the pigs and everything.

1024
00:50:23,681 --> 00:50:26,080
They just can't get them out of there.
Yeah.

1025
00:50:26,081 --> 00:50:28,400
Well the good news is they've instituted

1026
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,930
a hunters for the hungry type program
in,

1027
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:32,850
in Maui,
right?

1028
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,863
Correct.
Yeah.

1029
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,760
So one of my,
one of my buddies that don't with every

1030
00:50:35,761 --> 00:50:36,281
there,
robin,

1031
00:50:36,281 --> 00:50:38,180
he,
he started getting some of that rolling

1032
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:43,181
where they could go on the ranch's,
shoot the deer off the excess deer and

1033
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:45,800
then give them the people that need
food.

1034
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,590
God's amazing.
Which they should be able to.

1035
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,940
Sure why,
why not?

1036
00:50:49,941 --> 00:50:52,010
It's,
it's the some of the best tasting meat

1037
00:50:52,011 --> 00:50:55,160
there is.
And they're overrun with these animals.

1038
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,740
Yeah.
That's an argument for hunting.

1039
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:01,910
It's really difficult for animal rights
people to argue against because you

1040
00:51:01,911 --> 00:51:05,540
already have this invasive species
that's overpopulating this island and

1041
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,350
you're going to bring in wolves,
which is another invasive species,

1042
00:51:09,351 --> 00:51:12,230
which isn't that similar to what they
tried to do in Australia?

1043
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,251
Yeah,
Australia.

1044
00:51:13,251 --> 00:51:14,780
They started to try to bring in a bunch
of stuff.

1045
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,120
I wish was here.
They brought foxes and cats,

1046
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,960
but the foxes and cats.
Well you've got these marsupials that

1047
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:23,510
are slow and lay eggs and don't run
away.

1048
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,960
The rats rats hide and her fast
platypuses don't nesting bird ground

1049
00:51:29,511 --> 00:51:30,620
nesting birds,
all that stuff.

1050
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:35,710
So they just hammer the native species
and then the invasive rats and mice

1051
00:51:35,771 --> 00:51:37,820
still just take a toll on everything.
Yeah.

1052
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:40,460
What is the solution to a place like
Lanai,

1053
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:45,410
other than hunting?
I mean you'd have to give the deer birth

1054
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:48,970
control or bringing predators or poison
or poison.

1055
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,040
So they use that.
They use fair talks in New Zealand.

1056
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,760
Oh God.
You imagine just,

1057
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:54,801
they,
they use,

1058
00:51:54,801 --> 00:51:56,720
uh,
a poison called tent and they will,

1059
00:51:56,721 --> 00:52:00,570
the fair tax is mostly for a possums
that they use a,

1060
00:52:00,571 --> 00:52:03,680
a poison called 10 80 and it's serial
poisoning.

1061
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:07,730
So they essentially cold cereal,
which would be like grains and rice and

1062
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:11,780
other things with this extremely deadly
poison.

1063
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:15,290
And then they just dump it out of
helicopters into the forest.

1064
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,290
It doesn't discriminate.
No.

1065
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,870
Just whatever's local as well.
Correct.

1066
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:22,670
And you're,
you're putting.

1067
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:23,823
I mean,
you're,

1068
00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:26,240
you're dumping poison.
It's crazy.

1069
00:52:26,241 --> 00:52:27,740
It's going to get into the ground water.
Yeah.

1070
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:28,910
Yeah.
I mean,

1071
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:30,890
that's so stupid.
What kind of,

1072
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:34,400
what kind of solution is that?
If you think hunting's bad,

1073
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,690
that poison is not an easy death.
No,

1074
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:39,560
no,
it's awful.

1075
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,900
It takes a long time too.
And the thing is,

1076
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,920
again,
like you said,

1077
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:47,950
that the meat is delicious if you just,
if they just had a program where they

1078
00:52:48,411 --> 00:52:52,430
went to Lanai and just shot animals just
for,

1079
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:57,460
for hungry people in la who are in Maui
and they could have a lot of amazing

1080
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:59,130
meals for people.
Oh yeah.

1081
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,600
And not even just here.
What about sending that freezing it

1082
00:53:02,601 --> 00:53:04,880
somehow sending it other places in the
world?

1083
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,340
Yeah,
we're doing that with other places in

1084
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:08,540
New Zealand,
Australia,

1085
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,070
whatever,
setting up programs like that.

1086
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,330
Well,
people like that fellow,

1087
00:53:11,331 --> 00:53:15,590
that was the con Hashtag animal rights
and Hashtag Vegan.

1088
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,940
This is,
this is where they run into a wall,

1089
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:23,030
like an ideological wall.
Like what do you think should happen to

1090
00:53:23,031 --> 00:53:25,010
wild pigs?
Like what do you think should happen?

1091
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:26,130
You think they should just go

1092
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,590
run rampant and destroy all the other
wildlife.

1093
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:33,890
They're not just an invasive species,
but a ruthlessly reproducing invasive.

1094
00:53:34,590 --> 00:53:36,510
Yeah.
And they can outcompete other things.

1095
00:53:36,511 --> 00:53:38,660
So by leaving one thing,
you're,

1096
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,800
you're killing something else.
There's always,

1097
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,000
there's always this weird trade off
where for some one thing to exist,

1098
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:46,580
something else has to die.
Yeah,

1099
00:53:46,581 --> 00:53:48,690
that's unfortunate,
but that's just how the world is.

1100
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:51,600
If you don't like the way the world
works socks,

1101
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,120
it's kind of unfortunate,
but it's also kind of.

1102
00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:55,590
Look,
it's the way it is.

1103
00:53:55,591 --> 00:53:56,424
Yeah,
and I don't.

1104
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,260
I don't want that elk to get killed by
that wolf,

1105
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:01,840
but I would have loved to see it happen.
It's going to happen.

1106
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:02,710
Exactly.
I mean,

1107
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:04,060
we,
you got to see in my,

1108
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:06,580
in my opinion,
you got to see something really fucking

1109
00:54:06,581 --> 00:54:07,490
amazing.
Oh yeah.

1110
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,460
What are the odds that you're there?
Right?

1111
00:54:09,461 --> 00:54:11,320
When a wolf takes out an elk.
Yeah.

1112
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:13,600
Not Very.
Not very likely.

1113
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,180
Yeah.
Cam hands posted a few things.

1114
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,950
We did that Una el con concerned.
Oh good.

1115
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,761
Yeah.
Great.

1116
00:54:21,761 --> 00:54:22,360
Yeah,
that was great.

1117
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:26,740
But Cam posted a bunch of videos because
a bunch of people were,

1118
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,960
you know,
it's always gonna bunch of people

1119
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:30,270
complaining about hunting.
Yeah.

1120
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,830
What?
He posted a bunch of videos about bears

1121
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:38,250
and one of them was a bear eating a big
grizzly eating this elk calf while it

1122
00:54:38,921 --> 00:54:43,921
was alive while the mother was off just
like just a 30 yards away,

1123
00:54:45,041 --> 00:54:45,970
freaking the fuck out.

1124
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:50,970
And she's watching this big old grizzly
just tear her and it's going making

1125
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:54,700
weird noises where it just gets mauled
and you know,

1126
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:59,320
I don't want that to happen,
but it's going to happen and it's not.

1127
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,860
I'm not happy that it's happening,
but it's fascinating to watch.

1128
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,140
Like if I was there,
I would definitely watch that.

1129
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,530
Yeah.
I mean it's just like it's live.

1130
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,280
But I think that is the real ideological
argument and this is where like the

1131
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:17,950
Vegan people fall short.
It's like I understand that you don't

1132
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:19,630
want to kill animals.
You don't have to.

1133
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:22,120
I understand that you don't want factory
farming.

1134
00:55:22,121 --> 00:55:24,100
I don't want it either.
I don't want any of that stuff.

1135
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,250
But this is a.
you're dealing with a different thing

1136
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,320
and it's,
it's a smaller thing,

1137
00:55:29,321 --> 00:55:32,650
like the amount of people that are
hunting for food and managing wildlife

1138
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:36,610
and controlling populations too small.
It's a smaller thing than the amount of

1139
00:55:36,611 --> 00:55:39,160
people that actually eat meat.
But to target that.

1140
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:41,110
Like you,
you're literally targeting the one thing

1141
00:55:41,111 --> 00:55:43,540
that's been thought out the most.
Yeah,

1142
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,430
yeah.

1143
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,690
Yeah.
You've created,

1144
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:50,700
we've created these systems that we're
okay with yet if you really look at it,

1145
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:52,980
they're just fucking weird.
Yeah.

1146
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,880
No farming of animals.
We've done.

1147
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:59,280
We've done that for a very long time,
but the way that we do it now is just

1148
00:55:59,281 --> 00:56:01,120
some kind of different strategies.
Yeah.

1149
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,100
It's,
it's different.

1150
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:04,200
You know,
you're putting things in your body that

1151
00:56:04,201 --> 00:56:07,620
shouldn't be there when you can go out.
I can go and shoot a Caribou that's

1152
00:56:07,621 --> 00:56:11,340
never had.
It's only been eating native grasses on

1153
00:56:11,341 --> 00:56:15,580
the Tundra and it's completely wild and
healthy in my body.

1154
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:16,700
Even feels different when I eat

1155
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:18,100
that sort of stuff.
Yeah.

1156
00:56:18,110 --> 00:56:18,970
Same with elk,
right?

1157
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,410
Yeah.
And um,

1158
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,690
I get their argument that not everybody
could do that.

1159
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,500
You're right.
Not everybody would do it again,

1160
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,910
but guess what?
Not Everybody is going to do a lot of

1161
00:56:27,911 --> 00:56:29,200
things.
It's hard to do.

1162
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,790
It's not,
it's not an easy thing to do.

1163
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,290
It's not easy to get a bow and Arrow and
go into the mountains and find an elk

1164
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,290
and shoot it and then pack it out.
And most people are just,

1165
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:40,090
they're not going to do that.

1166
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,033
No.
And I think if you,

1167
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,210
if you really.
Well I think it was kind of cool this,

1168
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:47,640
this,
the last week I took my fiance hunting.

1169
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:49,490
It was their first time hunting.
Really?

1170
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,990
Yeah.
I mean like where she was hunting.

1171
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:52,880
Oh,
okay.

1172
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,660
So she's been with you before when you
were hunting?

1173
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,310
Yeah.
But like when are you doing?

1174
00:56:56,311 --> 00:56:57,120
Are you done?
Yeah,

1175
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:57,953
exactly.

1176
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,780
But you know,
over the years she's seen me go,

1177
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,040
okay.
She gets it,

1178
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:05,070
she enjoys eating the meat.
She has always,

1179
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,200
you know,
when we first started dating or ever

1180
00:57:07,201 --> 00:57:07,651
said,
oh,

1181
00:57:07,651 --> 00:57:11,340
I could never kill anything.
And I understood that not everyone can,

1182
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,760
but through the process of watching what
I do,

1183
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,710
the respect that I have for the animals
and going,

1184
00:57:16,711 --> 00:57:18,810
okay,
this isn't as bad as I had always

1185
00:57:18,811 --> 00:57:20,430
thought it was nothing.
It was bad.

1186
00:57:20,431 --> 00:57:23,940
But she gave it a try and just like,
okay.

1187
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,380
And then when we,
you know,

1188
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,350
she,
the first time she killed something she

1189
00:57:28,351 --> 00:57:30,570
cried a little bit.
But immediately after she was like,

1190
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,620
I'm actually really excited.
I'm really happy that I got this,

1191
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:37,500
this deer,
and then last night we cooked it up for

1192
00:57:37,501 --> 00:57:38,610
dinner.
When we got home.

1193
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:40,950
She's like,
it does taste better.

1194
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:41,780
I was like,
yeah,

1195
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:45,240
because this is your dear.
This is you provided this meal for us.

1196
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:47,220
This is your and well now you're a part
of it.

1197
00:57:47,221 --> 00:57:49,590
It's not.
You didn't go by that you killed it

1198
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,990
yourself.
You knew what that deer was and you just

1199
00:57:51,991 --> 00:57:55,470
respect it a lot more now because you
were a part of that process.

1200
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,140
You had to struggle a little bit.
We almost didn't get one.

1201
00:57:58,141 --> 00:58:00,390
You went through the whole thing of.
Well,

1202
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:02,790
you know the whole process of it.
It's completely different.

1203
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:06,010
It's just a different thing that when
you're eating the food.

1204
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,470
Yeah.
When you buy a steak from a supermarket,

1205
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:11,590
you have zero connection with that other
than the fact that he had to work to pay

1206
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:12,550
for it.
You know,

1207
00:58:12,551 --> 00:58:14,380
you go to a restaurant,
you have even less because you're not

1208
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:16,390
even cooking it and they just sit down
there.

1209
00:58:16,391 --> 00:58:17,320
Yeah,
I'll have the t bone.

1210
00:58:17,321 --> 00:58:18,970
Medium rare please,
and then it comes back.

1211
00:58:18,971 --> 00:58:19,960
We'll looks good.
Shopped up,

1212
00:58:19,961 --> 00:58:20,261
trump,
trump,

1213
00:58:20,261 --> 00:58:20,711
trump,
trump,

1214
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:21,041
trump,
trump,

1215
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:21,770
trump,
trump,

1216
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:23,800
you know,
but when you do it yourself,

1217
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,560
you know when you,
you described it once,

1218
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:29,910
I think a great way like that.
When you pull out an elk stack from an

1219
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:31,690
you shot,
it's almost like a sacred.

1220
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,940
Oh yeah,
like you're holding it like a baby.

1221
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:34,810
You will.
You've just,

1222
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,060
you've worked.
So you just appreciate everything.

1223
00:58:37,061 --> 00:58:40,300
You work hard for it.
It's also that you were there,

1224
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,390
like you understand this when you're
eating that meal,

1225
00:58:43,391 --> 00:58:47,770
that meal has a memory attached to it.
Whereas effort attached to it,

1226
00:58:47,771 --> 00:58:52,480
it has a comprehension.
You understand the process,

1227
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:56,590
you understand where the Arrow went.
You understand the blood trail,

1228
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:59,080
you under your,
you were there when you quartered it.

1229
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,080
The whole thing is like,
it's all coming back to you as you're

1230
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,880
eating.
There's no way you could reproduce that

1231
00:59:03,881 --> 00:59:04,870
without actually doing it.
I

1232
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:06,440
know,
and there's,

1233
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,740
there's that value when you look at.
We even just having a set of antlers

1234
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:12,750
around people might,
they don't hunt think,

1235
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:14,730
oh,
that's just trophy.

1236
00:59:14,731 --> 00:59:17,400
It's glorifying it,
but after the meats gone,

1237
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,380
you're still in remembrance of that
animal.

1238
00:59:19,381 --> 00:59:22,430
Oh yeah.
It's like a very deep process

1239
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:25,940
that you take with you for a long time.
Yeah,

1240
00:59:26,050 --> 00:59:29,200
no doubt.
I have my first elk that I shot on my

1241
00:59:29,201 --> 00:59:31,540
wall at my house.
The only one that my wife lets me put up

1242
00:59:31,830 --> 00:59:36,060
with the first shot over the bow and I.
I walked by that thing all the time and

1243
00:59:36,061 --> 00:59:38,320
I just.
I remember the whole experience.

1244
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:42,070
I remember bugling coming up the hill.
I remember hiding behind the tree.

1245
00:59:42,071 --> 00:59:44,910
I remember drawing back.
I remember waiting till I could see it's

1246
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,690
vitals.
I remember the Arrow hitting it.

1247
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,220
I remember going,
Holy Shit,

1248
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:53,440
we're watching it stumble.
I remember going down a vivid,

1249
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:58,470
like super vivid and vivid in a way that
not a lot of memories are because it's

1250
00:59:59,351 --> 01:00:02,490
so primal because it's a life and death
and I,

1251
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:03,750
I think,
I mean,

1252
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,270
I'm not a neuroscientist obviously,
but there's some shit that's turning on

1253
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:12,271
in your head that's like from the
caveman days when you shoot an elk with

1254
01:00:12,461 --> 01:00:16,690
a bow and Arrow and you see it go down,
you realize you like you're going to eat

1255
01:00:16,691 --> 01:00:17,170
this thing.

1256
01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:19,660
Like they're,
it's very,

1257
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:22,230
it's very interesting.
It's almost like the way I am.

1258
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:26,330
There's certain experiences in life
where once those experiences happen,

1259
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:26,831
you go,
Whoa,

1260
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,560
I didn't even know that that was a part
of my brain.

1261
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:31,810
Oh yeah.
Being a father is that way in a more

1262
01:00:31,811 --> 01:00:34,390
intense way.
Like once you have kids and then you

1263
01:00:34,391 --> 01:00:35,950
realize like how much you love your kids
are like,

1264
01:00:35,951 --> 01:00:36,850
wow,
this is,

1265
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:40,960
this is a part of my brain that I didn't
even know was there.

1266
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:45,520
And that was like fully lit up and
overcoming all of my senses and

1267
01:00:45,521 --> 01:00:46,660
thoughts.
You know,

1268
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:49,840
there's um,
some sort of strange deep connection

1269
01:00:49,841 --> 01:00:52,540
that we have.
And I always tell people like a good way

1270
01:00:52,541 --> 01:00:57,280
to let's that you,
you sort of feel that in a mild way

1271
01:00:57,610 --> 01:01:00,720
without too much craziness is fishing.
Yeah.

1272
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:02,180
When you catch a fish,
like,

1273
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:03,540
oh,
we got decided,

1274
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,743
oh Jesus,
he's.

1275
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:07,150
There's this weird sort of excitement to
it.

1276
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,640
But people don't have a problem with
dead fish.

1277
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,570
No.
Yeah,

1278
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:14,950
it's weird because fish don't have faces
or something like title,

1279
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:19,840
like your dog.
Something that you maybe just because

1280
01:01:19,841 --> 01:01:21,910
nothing you don't cuddle fish or
something.

1281
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,580
Yeah,
it's in the water fish.

1282
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:25,600
So the difference.
Yeah,

1283
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,150
it's

1284
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,100
in the water.
It's in a different world.

1285
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,190
Yeah.
There's something that we have about and

1286
01:01:31,191 --> 01:01:32,480
then.
But then there's other animals.

1287
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:33,920
So we're super racist when

1288
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,070
it comes to animals over share,
like rats.

1289
01:01:36,071 --> 01:01:40,310
I don't give a fuck about.
Rats kills things gusting because they

1290
01:01:40,311 --> 01:01:44,710
have hair everywhere but their tail.
So it's just slimy ass fucking rep type

1291
01:01:44,711 --> 01:01:46,010
retail.
Yeah.

1292
01:01:46,250 --> 01:01:49,760
But you know,
something cute like a chip on click on a

1293
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,940
little fella.
It was funny because today on my

1294
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:53,790
instagram page,
I,

1295
01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:56,450
because I was doing some spear fishing
and stuff,

1296
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,030
I caught an octopus and when to kill an
octopus,

1297
01:01:59,031 --> 01:02:02,330
you swim,
you bite their skull to kill him.

1298
01:02:02,660 --> 01:02:03,493
Really?
Yeah.

1299
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:04,311
Skull.
Yeah.

1300
01:02:04,311 --> 01:02:06,170
It's right between their eyes.
It's where their,

1301
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:09,560
I guess their brain is.
You bite them between the eyes because

1302
01:02:09,561 --> 01:02:13,820
otherwise it moves around too much,
so it's hard to cause an octopus.

1303
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:15,920
They just latch on to everything.
You have to bite it.

1304
01:02:15,921 --> 01:02:18,680
You can't stab it there.
It'd be really hard to undo.

1305
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,650
I'm trying to move and it's got,
you know,

1306
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:24,510
it can is you stick the knife and it
would move around.

1307
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,220
So everybody does it that way.
You always bite?

1308
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:27,540
Yeah,
for the most part.

1309
01:02:28,190 --> 01:02:32,310
So you just write eyes and you feel the
school and you bite down and crush it.

1310
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:37,700
Nobody had has a problem with you biting
an octopus in the head at least not yet.

1311
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:41,520
Probably fucking smart,
man.

1312
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,290
This guy's got one.
Yeah,

1313
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:45,480
that dude's a kiwis.

1314
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,810
Whoa.
That guy's an animal.

1315
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:53,840
Jesus Christ.
Imagine if you're that poor octopus is

1316
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:58,841
fucking savage with a beard.
Brian is my is running around before

1317
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
now.
Wow.

1318
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:07,070
And the thing is,
yeah,

1319
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:10,050
nobody gives a shit about that.
But the thing is octopus are smart as

1320
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:11,700
fuck.
They're weird.

1321
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:12,600
Weird,
smart.

1322
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,220
Yeah.
We've talked about that before.

1323
01:03:15,870 --> 01:03:18,390
Just the way that they hide the way that
they do stuff.

1324
01:03:18,510 --> 01:03:20,640
Well,
your show that you.

1325
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:21,750
You're not doing anymore,
right?

1326
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:24,300
Yeah.
Creditor Apex Predator was a great show

1327
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:26,250
and one of the things that were for
people don't know what it was.

1328
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,260
You traveled all over the place and
tried to learn from the way different

1329
01:03:31,261 --> 01:03:32,710
animals would hunt things.
But yeah,

1330
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:35,640
I remember when you came in here and you
were talking about octopus.

1331
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:36,690
I didn't.
By the way.

1332
01:03:36,691 --> 01:03:39,810
You can say octopuses and you could say
Octopi.

1333
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:40,590
Yeah,
absolutely.

1334
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:45,540
Whatever you want it both ways.
But I had no idea like when you came in

1335
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:46,021
here like,
dude,

1336
01:03:46,021 --> 01:03:47,760
they're not even from this planet.
They're like aliens.

1337
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:48,643
Yeah,
they're weird.

1338
01:03:49,010 --> 01:03:49,970
But they,
uh,

1339
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,440
they are smart,
but in the ocean they're definitely at

1340
01:03:54,441 --> 01:03:56,110
the bottom of the food chain.
Are they really?

1341
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,940
But they kill sharks will the big ones,
the little ones,

1342
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,350
everything eats them.
Really.

1343
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,260
If you're an octopus,
you are.

1344
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:06,020
You are a savory dish for every fish I
guess are quite delicious.

1345
01:04:06,021 --> 01:04:07,430
Yeah.
When you're fishing,

1346
01:04:07,431 --> 01:04:10,550
that kind of octopus for bait works
better than anything.

1347
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:11,361
Really.
Yeah.

1348
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:13,490
These fish,
that's actually how he saw the one that

1349
01:04:13,491 --> 01:04:15,320
I got.
I swam down to go shoot a fishing,

1350
01:04:15,350 --> 01:04:19,850
usually pecking at it because they get
into the reef and just keep going for it

1351
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:23,270
until it gets out of their spear.
Phishing is supposed to be really fun.

1352
01:04:23,271 --> 01:04:24,730
It's like hunting underwater.
It's.

1353
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:25,850
Yeah,
it's really fun.

1354
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:26,840
I.
You'd enjoy it.

1355
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,440
I think you dig the hole.
You got to go that one of the best

1356
01:04:30,441 --> 01:04:34,780
things I've ever done in my life was
that free diving essentially like as

1357
01:04:34,781 --> 01:04:38,810
free diving class.
But that's one of the coolest things

1358
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,430
when I guarantee you'd be able to hold
your breath for four minutes or so and

1359
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:44,240
after you do that,
you think like,

1360
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,320
shit,
I can do anything.

1361
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,060
It's weird.
It's a weird feeling.

1362
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:50,060
That was one of the coolest things that
I did and I did it on that apex

1363
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:51,380
predators show.
That's what he did it for.

1364
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,900
But then since then I've been doing
quite a bit of,

1365
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:57,270
as much as I can,
try to go diving and spear fishing.

1366
01:04:57,430 --> 01:05:00,220
And the first time you held your breath
you couldn't hold it that long.

1367
01:05:00,310 --> 01:05:02,680
And then they told you how to do it.
Just a minute,

1368
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:04,220
a minute,
minute and a half,

1369
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:05,660
something like.
So what was the difference?

1370
01:05:05,990 --> 01:05:07,680
It's all mental really?
Yeah.

1371
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,930
So what did they tell you to concentrate
on?

1372
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:15,220
Just the fact that you aren't going to
die [inaudible] key and relaxing when

1373
01:05:15,471 --> 01:05:18,310
your heart rate starts.
So it's more about just controlling

1374
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:20,590
things,
controlling your heart rate and other

1375
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:22,300
stuff.
I'm no expert,

1376
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:26,080
but I'm,
there's people there really have been

1377
01:05:26,081 --> 01:05:28,210
spear fishing and diving as much as I go
hunting.

1378
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,210
But I try to learn as much as I can when
I'm out with people that know what

1379
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:32,870
they're doing.
And uh,

1380
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,420
it's just a cool experience of being
underwater and you get that little bit

1381
01:05:37,421 --> 01:05:40,930
of a panic and you start to use your
oxygen and then you just try to relax,

1382
01:05:40,931 --> 01:05:41,591
relax,
relax,

1383
01:05:41,591 --> 01:05:43,870
relax,
and you can stay longer.

1384
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:47,890
And sort of this guy does he given you
like techniques,

1385
01:05:47,891 --> 01:05:52,891
tech techniques to breathe,
slow your heart rate and then just

1386
01:05:53,081 --> 01:05:56,200
knowing the fact of how to hold your
breath,

1387
01:05:56,201 --> 01:06:00,280
don't let it out.
And the fact that what your body goes

1388
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:03,400
through the stages that your body goes
through when you are out of oxygen.

1389
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:08,680
So when you get to that end period,
you actually almost feel like you don't

1390
01:06:08,681 --> 01:06:10,870
need to breathe.
It's really weird.

1391
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:12,010
Yeah.
And that's when he got to breathe.

1392
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,250
That's when you got to breathe.
Because when I,

1393
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,600
when I was done doing the four minute
breath,

1394
01:06:16,601 --> 01:06:18,430
all that came out.
And the first thing he says,

1395
01:06:18,431 --> 01:06:21,790
breathe like x.
They tell you like exhale and breathe.

1396
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:23,500
Because I got up and like,
oh yeah.

1397
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:24,400
And then I'm like,
oh yeah,

1398
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:24,821
shit,
yeah,

1399
01:06:24,821 --> 01:06:26,950
I need to breathe.
That's weird.

1400
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,780
So is it sort of like hypothermia,
like as you get really,

1401
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,130
really cold,
you start heating up?

1402
01:06:31,790 --> 01:06:33,590
Um,
oh.

1403
01:06:33,591 --> 01:06:36,110
Like you feel the opposite.
Like when people are dying of

1404
01:06:36,111 --> 01:06:38,120
hypothermia,
one of the things when they find them,

1405
01:06:38,121 --> 01:06:39,550
they took all their clothes off.
Yeah.

1406
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,620
It could be something similar to that.
Wow.

1407
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,030
I don't know.
Yeah.

1408
01:06:44,031 --> 01:06:44,864
So,
um,

1409
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,610
when you hold your breath and you'd take
arts,

1410
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:53,270
why is it better to hold your breath and
to have no breath in and just not

1411
01:06:53,271 --> 01:06:55,970
breathe because your body needs the
oxygen.

1412
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:59,960
So the big breath like,
yeah,

1413
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:02,210
that's better.
Just hold that.

1414
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:04,250
Yup.
Because I was wondering like how,

1415
01:07:04,310 --> 01:07:09,200
what is the record for exhaling is all
your air and then holding your breath

1416
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:11,100
before you take another deep breath.
Wait,

1417
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:12,150
exhaling all your,
all.

1418
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:16,550
You're taking a big deep breath.
Exhaling everything and then holding it

1419
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,680
while you have no air in your lungs.

1420
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,630
Like how long can you go on for too
long?

1421
01:07:20,631 --> 01:07:25,030
Really know you're saying you breathe in
and breathe all the air out and then

1422
01:07:25,040 --> 01:07:25,820
stop.
Yep.

1423
01:07:25,820 --> 01:07:26,810
Oh,
a few seconds.

1424
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:27,651
Really?
Yeah.

1425
01:07:27,651 --> 01:07:28,910
You wouldn't.
Well,

1426
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:29,650
I mean,
not,

1427
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:32,270
not a few seconds.
Maybe a minute it with.

1428
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:32,990
No,
no,

1429
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:34,070
no,
no worry.

1430
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:35,030
Blackout.
Yeah.

1431
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:36,770
Well,
I don't know.

1432
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:41,090
You gotta breathe everything out and
then do 10 jumping jacks.

1433
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,020
Oh yeah,
you're fucked.

1434
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:44,810
You know what I mean?
Then there's no way he'd burn it out.

1435
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:45,900
Totally.
Yeah.

1436
01:07:46,370 --> 01:07:48,770
Probably.
I'd probably be the fastest way to pass

1437
01:07:48,771 --> 01:07:50,060
out of Eagan.
Anyways,

1438
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:54,170
a guy who fought in the UFC and he was a
free dive champion and I believe,

1439
01:07:54,770 --> 01:07:58,880
I want to say he went longer than seven
minutes.

1440
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,530
Yeah.
In the ocean.

1441
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:03,500
Underwater.
Holding his breath.

1442
01:08:03,690 --> 01:08:05,160
Yes,
and people are incredible.

1443
01:08:05,161 --> 01:08:09,240
I mean they can go five,
seven that some of that too is building

1444
01:08:09,241 --> 01:08:12,660
up your endurance,
but a lot of it is building up your

1445
01:08:12,661 --> 01:08:15,320
endurance and just really slowing your
heart rate

1446
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:20,930
and not using up the oxygen that you
have and not freaking out is a freakout.

1447
01:08:20,990 --> 01:08:22,740
You get scared,
you're heart rate goes up and you use

1448
01:08:22,741 --> 01:08:25,790
them more oxygen.
It's one of those things if you're

1449
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:30,791
running out of gas and you want to speed
up to the gas station and burn more gas

1450
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:35,750
was instead of slow down,
drop it down to 35 and cruise,

1451
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:41,500
you're going to go 70 if he can do to
really fascinating life when it comes to

1452
01:08:42,561 --> 01:08:45,680
like your experiences in the wild,
like how old are you?

1453
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,240
Thirty five,
33,

1454
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:51,290
33,
33 year old guys have not been to as

1455
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:52,640
many places.
Experiences.

1456
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:55,370
Many wild things as you have.
I mean you've,

1457
01:08:55,371 --> 01:08:58,310
you've really had a very,
very unusual life.

1458
01:08:58,311 --> 01:08:59,270
That's.
Oh definitely.

1459
01:08:59,330 --> 01:09:01,130
Especially with wildlife experience.
Yeah.

1460
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,930
Well,
I mean if I look at it,

1461
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:06,170
I've spent the majority of my life out
in the wild.

1462
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,110
That's crazy.
That's crazy.

1463
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,290
We'll normal.
Yeah,

1464
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:10,670
I try.
I try.

1465
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,580
I'm not honestly not that normal,
but we try to upgrade.

1466
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:16,230
Or You were into you,
you,

1467
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,050
you.
Who told you that?

1468
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:20,540
I was him.
It was young.

1469
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:21,010
Yeah.
No,

1470
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:23,990
probably with.
Oh well when I was in middle school,

1471
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,330
but friends into it.
You were a dancer,

1472
01:09:26,331 --> 01:09:28,220
right?
Didn't you like do like dance

1473
01:09:28,221 --> 01:09:31,260
competitions and chill?
I think that's one of those rumors,

1474
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,453
you know,
those,

1475
01:09:33,490 --> 01:09:35,280
you know,
when you get really drunk and you pull

1476
01:09:35,281 --> 01:09:36,830
it out,
that party trick that you know when

1477
01:09:36,831 --> 01:09:41,050
you're 15 years old and it looks shitty,
but nobody else like,

1478
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:44,460
it's one of those,
it's one of those things because people

1479
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:47,640
like you won't believe it,
but it was like a dance champion of the

1480
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:48,530
world.
Now it's true.

1481
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,380
That is like,
that is not anywhere close.

1482
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,640
I was in,
some summer was in me and my brother

1483
01:09:55,641 --> 01:09:59,840
went to Iceland in the summer when I was
in high school and the person that we

1484
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:03,530
stayed with was like a break dancer and
just taught us how to break dance and

1485
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:04,580
we'd just do it for fun.

1486
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,620
It's the only those things you whip out
at like a wedding.

1487
01:10:06,950 --> 01:10:08,870
Okay.
So you never went anywhere.

1488
01:10:09,470 --> 01:10:13,070
That's hilarious.
That's one of those things that everyone

1489
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,960
was one Christmas party with Zpz.
Everyone was just hammered and I

1490
01:10:17,961 --> 01:10:18,794
thought,
oh yeah,

1491
01:10:18,860 --> 01:10:21,950
someone was trying to do like the white
break dance thing,

1492
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:25,040
which as my version is extremely white
and bad,

1493
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:30,310
but I could do like a few no head spins,
but maybe some wind mills and some cool

1494
01:10:30,501 --> 01:10:31,151
stuff,
you know,

1495
01:10:31,151 --> 01:10:34,700
that might have been like,
and then it just goes from there.

1496
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:38,820
That's what happened because the rumor
has spread like wildfire.

1497
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:39,411
That's great.
Hey,

1498
01:10:39,411 --> 01:10:41,060
warren was a break desi champion.
I'm like,

1499
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:44,210
does he have time for these things?
Thirty three years old.

1500
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,060
Have all the places that you've been
[inaudible] you.

1501
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:50,090
That's the first time I saw you was on
that show solo hunter,

1502
01:10:50,091 --> 01:10:50,924
I think.
Yeah.

1503
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,760
No,
I think the first time I saw you was on

1504
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:55,040
Steve Show and that I saw you on soul
hunter as well.

1505
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,780
Yeah,
because I was actually supposed to go on

1506
01:10:56,781 --> 01:10:59,570
that first hunt with you guys,
but I had to guide that week when

1507
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,910
Callahan and I wish I would have made
it,

1508
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:03,980
but I was fortunate.
It would have been cool.

1509
01:11:04,210 --> 01:11:05,810
I love that area.
You have to.

1510
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,650
You have to go into the woods with Brian
Cowen.

1511
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:08,410
Yeah,
it's.

1512
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:11,150
It's a problem.
You will not stop laughing because.

1513
01:11:11,151 --> 01:11:11,984
Yeah,
he's,

1514
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,150
he's way than me like

1515
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:16,950
with a captive audience.
Like he's like,

1516
01:11:16,951 --> 01:11:21,040
it's almost like he's wasted on stage.
Like a Bra.

1517
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:21,481
Yeah,
yeah,

1518
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:24,150
yeah.
Where he's at his best is a bunch of

1519
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,870
friends just hanging around.
Small group,

1520
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:28,020
just small,
and he would just,

1521
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,300
he would just be.
He's so funny.

1522
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:33,270
He's like,
it's almost like there's no art forum

1523
01:11:33,271 --> 01:11:34,630
for what he does.
He,

1524
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:39,240
it's like he can take it to a stage in
front of a bunch of strangers and 300

1525
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:41,820
people and whatever on a credit.
It'll be really funny.

1526
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:43,440
Don't get me wrong.
He's standups really,

1527
01:11:43,441 --> 01:11:45,090
really funny.
It's one of the best standups in the

1528
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:47,940
country,
but it's not as funny as when you're

1529
01:11:47,941 --> 01:11:51,600
alone with him in the woods.
He did this thing about he had a

1530
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:55,230
character that he created called the
ravine calmer where he would jerk off

1531
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:58,560
intervenes.
It's so stupid,

1532
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:02,430
but when you're there and you're in
Montana and his fucking nine degrees out

1533
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:06,450
and you've been sleeping on the ground
for five days and hiking around miles

1534
01:12:06,451 --> 01:12:10,140
every day and you're kind of half half
out of it and laughing and you're,

1535
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,960
you're,
we're in the middle of a quartering,

1536
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:13,980
a deer,
and he just starts,

1537
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:14,731
guys,
guys,

1538
01:12:14,731 --> 01:12:16,320
let me tell you what to do,
what a dealer,

1539
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:20,970
and he just starts like pretending pulls
his pants halfway down his jacket off

1540
01:12:20,971 --> 01:12:22,560
into the,
into a canyon.

1541
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,320
That's it.
I'm not doing it any justice.

1542
01:12:25,321 --> 01:12:26,910
Purely that.
So juvenile.

1543
01:12:26,970 --> 01:12:29,690
It's definitely Juvie is.
But that's what cried.

1544
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:31,980
When you're hunting.
You have to have that,

1545
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:35,690
that sense of humor to keep you going.
And there's guys like that.

1546
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:40,230
Just when you're out there sharing
things that are just extra money,

1547
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:45,231
I don't know what it is because you're
just but see him when he's at his best.

1548
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:48,100
When you're in a captive audience,
like I'm just,

1549
01:12:48,140 --> 01:12:49,170
I'm,
that's not me.

1550
01:12:49,171 --> 01:12:50,790
I don't,
I don't have that sense of humor.

1551
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:52,260
I have a different kind of sense of
humor,

1552
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:54,900
but he,
he's the guy where there's like five of

1553
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:55,501
us,
like guys,

1554
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:56,281
you got a piece on,
you don't.

1555
01:12:56,281 --> 01:12:57,140
Yeah,
like he'll just

1556
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,990
making you uncomfortable.
The next thing you know,

1557
01:13:00,991 --> 01:13:02,010
who,
you know,

1558
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:05,100
it just,
it's so silly.

1559
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:09,060
So that trip and that's when I knew too,
like on the first hunting trip and I

1560
01:13:09,061 --> 01:13:10,590
knew he was like,
out of all my friends,

1561
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:13,740
he's one of the ones that I knew would
be able to tough it out.

1562
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,460
Like all the other guys that are urban
guys stand up Comedians,

1563
01:13:17,461 --> 01:13:21,000
like what are the odds that I can get
one of those guys to go to Montana for

1564
01:13:21,001 --> 01:13:24,320
seven days?
And then they'd be like,

1565
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:29,250
fucking Rogan might bring me out here,
but column was a trooper all the next

1566
01:13:29,251 --> 01:13:30,960
time we do it.
You should go because we're were.

1567
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:33,120
Steve and I are,
we're trying to put together something

1568
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:34,650
now.
We might do it in Mexico.

1569
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:37,050
Oh yeah.
I'm actually going there next week.

1570
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:37,710
Are you?
He's,

1571
01:13:37,710 --> 01:13:39,360
I think he's there now.
Yeah.

1572
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:40,203
Yes.
Yeah,

1573
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:41,740
they're there with,
uh,

1574
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,870
with Benno,
Brian and a pianist who's dear,

1575
01:13:45,871 --> 01:13:46,540
right?
Yep.

1576
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:49,390
You say kooser cows.
Some people say cows.

1577
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,200
It's,
it's,

1578
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,130
it's one of those things.
It was originally pronounced one way,

1579
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:57,420
like the state of Nevada is not Nevada,
Nevada.

1580
01:13:57,570 --> 01:13:59,410
Everyone who lives there calls it
Nevada,

1581
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:00,820
Nevada.
In Nevada,

1582
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,863
Nevada,
I think.

1583
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:04,350
Yeah,
it's Las Vegas,

1584
01:14:04,351 --> 01:14:06,180
Nevada.
I don't know what I say.

1585
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:08,640
Yeah.
I have to be alone without you

1586
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:11,980
influencing me to remember when you,
when you think next time they'll call

1587
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,830
it in Nevada,
you're going to be like a big ad

1588
01:14:14,831 --> 01:14:16,780
campaign,
but there's just certain things that

1589
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:18,400
when you're there,
it set a certain way.

1590
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:22,210
Well,
when we went and borrowed your truck

1591
01:14:22,211 --> 01:14:25,660
when we went bowhunting outside of Reno.
Yup.

1592
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:29,650
That's when I got to see the Nevada that
you guys know.

1593
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:34,150
Everybody thinks everybody thinks of
Nevada as Vegas.

1594
01:14:34,690 --> 01:14:36,500
Vegas and Barstow.
No,

1595
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:40,000
this like mule deer and elk and mountain
mountains.

1596
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:41,680
Yeah.
And there's more independent mountain

1597
01:14:41,681 --> 01:14:45,610
ranges in Nevada than anywhere else.
And more public land outside of Alaska

1598
01:14:45,611 --> 01:14:48,370
and there's more public land percentage
wise.

1599
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:49,990
Wow,
that's crazy.

1600
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:51,790
It's almost all public.
That's,

1601
01:14:52,060 --> 01:14:55,960
that's one of the reasons why I'm so
gung Ho for public lands.

1602
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,050
I grew up in a place where you never saw
a no trespassing sign.

1603
01:14:59,051 --> 01:15:00,430
You weren't told you you couldn't go
anywhere.

1604
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,800
That's amazing.
It's like the Anti Texas.

1605
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:04,900
It's the,
it is the Anti Texas.

1606
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,210
Nothing wrong with Texas,
but it's all,

1607
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:08,970
it's all private.
So weird.

1608
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:13,030
There's probably some public land where
guys hunting Texas,

1609
01:15:13,031 --> 01:15:13,900
right?
It was public,

1610
01:15:13,901 --> 01:15:15,830
but they sold it all off.
Did they sell it all off?

1611
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,190
You know,
the states got the land and they sold it

1612
01:15:18,191 --> 01:15:20,020
off to people.
State hardly has any land.

1613
01:15:20,230 --> 01:15:23,950
That's the worry for places like Utah
and where they're shrinking their

1614
01:15:23,951 --> 01:15:28,420
monuments and they're starting to sell
off rights for drilling and mining and

1615
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:31,090
you know,
people are really concerned about this

1616
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:33,550
administration and their,
what they're doing with the

1617
01:15:33,551 --> 01:15:35,680
environmental protections because,
uh,

1618
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:37,840
today trump signed some new thing,
uh,

1619
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:41,080
allowing for offshore drilling,
like pretty much fucking everywhere.

1620
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:43,690
He just went.
See if you can find that.

1621
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:46,270
It's just,
it's,

1622
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:50,680
it's rolling back all of the
environmental protections from the Obama

1623
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:53,080
administration and his ideas like
economics.

1624
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,110
Trumps trumps wrong word.
Yeah.

1625
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:59,590
Trump's environmental and then will we
really need is to just maximize our

1626
01:15:59,591 --> 01:16:00,940
ability to earn money.
Yeah.

1627
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:06,270
Trump moves to open nearly all offshore
waters to drilling nearly all offshore

1628
01:16:08,051 --> 01:16:10,810
waters to drilling.
That sounds so fucking crazy.

1629
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,090
FTC,
the BP oil spill,

1630
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:15,340
like how many of those can we endure?
Yeah,

1631
01:16:15,341 --> 01:16:16,174
it's,
it's,

1632
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:20,560
there's a lot of scary stuff when it
comes to the environment because we only

1633
01:16:20,561 --> 01:16:21,970
get one.
There's only one earth.

1634
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,410
Yeah.
We're so interested in Mars,

1635
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,390
like just figure out how to manage the
shit we got.

1636
01:16:28,870 --> 01:16:29,703
Well,
I just,

1637
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:34,360
he's all about business.
It's really weird to see a super pro

1638
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:38,470
business guy that's in the White House.
It's quite strange.

1639
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:39,660
The whole thing is quite.
It's,

1640
01:16:39,730 --> 01:16:42,940
it seems surreal.
Like every couple of days I'll look at

1641
01:16:42,941 --> 01:16:44,980
the paper and it says president trump
and I'll go,

1642
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:48,350
oh yeah,
that guy is the president and that's why

1643
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:51,730
for what I do,
I can just get to unplug for very long

1644
01:16:51,731 --> 01:16:55,390
periods of time just.
But that's not even the right way to go

1645
01:16:55,391 --> 01:16:58,780
about it sometimes because then there's
things that affect me and what I love

1646
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:01,360
and of course,
and then I get hit blindsided by it

1647
01:17:01,361 --> 01:17:05,170
because they don't know that I'm gone
and out in the woods and enjoying what I

1648
01:17:05,171 --> 01:17:07,050
like and then I come home and
everything.

1649
01:17:07,051 --> 01:17:09,680
Everything's gone.
But do you have a hard time relating to

1650
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:13,290
a lot of people your age that don't
experience the things you experienced

1651
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:17,480
because your life is so vastly different
than the average 33 year old guy?

1652
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:19,610
No,
I mean I think people.

1653
01:17:20,660 --> 01:17:22,520
I think people respect.
If you,

1654
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:24,260
if you're really passionate about
something,

1655
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:27,590
whether if you are passionate about
something that isn't even non hunting

1656
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:28,730
lease,
I'm like,

1657
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:30,230
well I give you respect your passion.
Yeah.

1658
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:34,160
You're doing your thing.
And I think a lot of people get that

1659
01:17:34,161 --> 01:17:35,810
with me.
Whether they hunter don't hunt,

1660
01:17:36,130 --> 01:17:38,540
I can relate to anybody because
everybody's kind of passionate about

1661
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:41,300
something.
We use that group of people that have no

1662
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:42,810
passion and you're like,
wow,

1663
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,810
okay.
I don't relate with them,

1664
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:47,690
but I feel like they were raised wrong.
Somebody didn't come along,

1665
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,030
introduce them to something,
exactly something.

1666
01:17:50,031 --> 01:17:51,350
I mean,
everybody's got their thing,

1667
01:17:51,790 --> 01:17:52,480
you know,
if,

1668
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,920
if your thing is whatever,
video game or whatever,

1669
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:56,540
that's not my thing,
but if you're cool,

1670
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,760
if you like it and you're passionate
about it and I can tell that,

1671
01:17:58,790 --> 01:18:01,730
then we can have a conversation about it
because I think that's cool when people

1672
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,380
are passionate about something.
Oh yeah.

1673
01:18:03,381 --> 01:18:06,770
I mean it's very infectious.
I watch people make furniture.

1674
01:18:06,771 --> 01:18:09,200
I don't want to make furniture that.
I've watched people that are really into

1675
01:18:09,201 --> 01:18:10,130
furniture like,
fuck,

1676
01:18:10,131 --> 01:18:10,970
that looks awesome.

1677
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:15,530
Does something exciting.
My instagram feed is like woodworking

1678
01:18:15,531 --> 01:18:16,364
stuff.
I'm like,

1679
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:17,750
yeah,
I don't know.

1680
01:18:17,780 --> 01:18:20,240
It's just like the people that are
really passionate about where we're

1681
01:18:20,241 --> 01:18:22,820
going.
It's cool to see them build stuff.

1682
01:18:23,180 --> 01:18:25,430
I into that.
I liked makers.

1683
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:26,570
Yeah.
That's cool.

1684
01:18:26,571 --> 01:18:29,720
Watching gorging orange blades,
hammer them down.

1685
01:18:29,721 --> 01:18:32,810
It's just there's something about
tactile,

1686
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:36,790
just actual physical things that you're
making and changing it.

1687
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:38,630
I'm fascinated by that stuff.
Yeah,

1688
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,180
so it doesn't mean if you,
if you do it or whatever.

1689
01:18:41,181 --> 01:18:45,970
I think everybody can relate on some
level to to things that they're into or

1690
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:47,750
their passions,
I'm sure,

1691
01:18:47,751 --> 01:18:51,710
but what you've done is pretty unique.
Like I said that about that show solo

1692
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:52,970
hunter.
I remember thinking,

1693
01:18:52,971 --> 01:18:53,930
watching that like,
Whoa,

1694
01:18:53,931 --> 01:18:56,120
this is.
This guy goes out there.

1695
01:18:56,540 --> 01:19:00,830
You're out there by yourself.
You don't really have a lot to save.

1696
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:03,100
You know that.
That's my thing is I.

1697
01:19:05,470 --> 01:19:08,660
me and Steve are actually talking about
this on that a fog neck.

1698
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:12,740
It was before the bear attack,
but it's just real shitty weather,

1699
01:19:12,770 --> 01:19:17,770
hard hiking and I'm just loving it is.
You think you'll ever get sick of this.

1700
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:22,310
You just want to go on on a ranch
somewhere and drive around and not kill

1701
01:19:22,311 --> 01:19:24,440
yourself,
but it's a different.

1702
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:28,160
That's my thing.
If I have two options,

1703
01:19:28,161 --> 01:19:32,810
option a is just this.
Go hunting in a place that there's very

1704
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:36,800
few animals and you probably won't have
any success and it's just really shitty

1705
01:19:36,801 --> 01:19:40,520
weather and it's tough and big mountains
or there's this one where I'm guaranteed

1706
01:19:40,521 --> 01:19:44,180
that I'll get some big animal and I'll
have a lot of encounters and I can just

1707
01:19:44,181 --> 01:19:46,670
drive around.
I'm going to choose the really hard one

1708
01:19:47,390 --> 01:19:49,280
and that's just,
it's just how I am.

1709
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:51,470
I like that.
I like the,

1710
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:55,580
it's like a masochistic thing of I like
to struggle.

1711
01:19:55,581 --> 01:19:58,100
I like to hurt for it.
Like if I'm going to kill an animal,

1712
01:19:58,370 --> 01:20:02,480
I want to have had some kind of struggle
where I feel like I've earned some

1713
01:20:02,481 --> 01:20:04,400
respect.
Like I dunno,

1714
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:06,590
it's like my payment.
I had to work for it.

1715
01:20:06,591 --> 01:20:09,660
It's my payment to the animal's life.
It's a weird.

1716
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:11,760
So it's just my thing.

1717
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,670
Don't you feel like also it's because
you've had so much success.

1718
01:20:14,671 --> 01:20:18,600
It's not like you're hurting for meat
desperado meat hunt.

1719
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,290
Yeah,
and I think that that's part of it

1720
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:23,080
because sometimes I might go,
if something's too easy,

1721
01:20:23,081 --> 01:20:24,820
if I go somewhere and I think,
oh man,

1722
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:28,330
this is too easy.
Then I'll look for an animal that might

1723
01:20:28,331 --> 01:20:33,331
be bigger or harder to find or a certain
one just to give myself some kind of

1724
01:20:33,521 --> 01:20:37,540
challenge and that was part of the thing
of filming myself while hunting and

1725
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:40,450
going out there is that added challenge
of being alone.

1726
01:20:40,451 --> 01:20:44,590
The added challenge of filming myself,
all those challenges just to,

1727
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:48,790
you know,
create that experience of the struggle

1728
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:49,720
of it.
I guess.

1729
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:52,510
It's like I crave that struggle a lot as
well.

1730
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,500
So weird.
So weird thing.

1731
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,750
It's weird,
but I think a lot of people do that and

1732
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:57,450
different stuff.

1733
01:20:57,450 --> 01:20:59,190
It's like exercise.
It's like I,

1734
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:03,990
I firmly believe that a person who
doesn't struggle with anything is going

1735
01:21:03,991 --> 01:21:07,110
to be a miserable person because I don't
think you're really going to truly

1736
01:21:07,111 --> 01:21:10,590
appreciate relaxation.
I don't appreciate relaxation unless I

1737
01:21:10,591 --> 01:21:13,140
work hard.
If I worked like if I come home from the

1738
01:21:13,141 --> 01:21:14,760
gym,
I worked out hard.

1739
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,220
I worked all day,
worked out hard,

1740
01:21:17,460 --> 01:21:20,790
come home from the gym,
I'm fucking exhausted and I can put my

1741
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:23,430
feet up on the couch and I can enjoy TV
show.

1742
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:26,220
I can really enjoy it.
It's one of the only times I can because

1743
01:21:26,221 --> 01:21:28,830
if I wake up in the morning and I eat
breakfast and I turned on the TV,

1744
01:21:28,831 --> 01:21:30,240
I'm like,
why the fuck you watching TV?

1745
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:33,270
Shut that shit off.
They'll get something done if I've

1746
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,510
already done.
I think this is the reason why people

1747
01:21:36,511 --> 01:21:41,460
like working out hard is because your
body desires struggle and I think that's

1748
01:21:41,461 --> 01:21:45,090
the way human beings evolved.
I think we evolved to have a certain

1749
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:49,410
amount of our reward system geared
towards us accomplishing difficult

1750
01:21:49,411 --> 01:21:51,330
things because that's how people
survived.

1751
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,400
Yeah.
I think there's a lot to that.

1752
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:56,440
It's a,
it's an accomplishment feeling that you

1753
01:21:56,441 --> 01:21:58,810
get.
It's kind of releases those endorphins.

1754
01:21:58,811 --> 01:21:59,980
You okay?
I feel good about.

1755
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:05,080
And you really see the real hard times
really make you appreciate the easy

1756
01:22:05,081 --> 01:22:06,610
times.
It was just all easy.

1757
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:09,760
You just get stagnant.
Like a rich kid,

1758
01:22:09,761 --> 01:22:14,530
not be happy.
Born with silver spoons and you go,

1759
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:16,860
oh,
you don't.

1760
01:22:17,050 --> 01:22:18,670
Yeah.
I can't just keep buying.

1761
01:22:18,690 --> 01:22:19,361
I can't.
Yeah,

1762
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:20,050
you need.

1763
01:22:20,050 --> 01:22:23,020
You need some sort of struggling.
Like I just,

1764
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:25,900
uh,
I don't know if that's been mapped out.

1765
01:22:25,901 --> 01:22:28,990
If people understand like you need x
amount of struggle to have this amount

1766
01:22:28,991 --> 01:22:29,990
of happiness,
like a really,

1767
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:31,600
most people just think,
oh,

1768
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:33,910
you know,
just get a job and do your thing and

1769
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,920
you'll be,
you'll be happy and if you're not,

1770
01:22:35,921 --> 01:22:36,820
you take paxil.

1771
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:40,040
Yeah.
I think a lot of people's goal plans

1772
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:42,080
don't.
They try to find the way around that

1773
01:22:42,081 --> 01:22:44,050
struggle part and I kind of seek out
that

1774
01:22:44,570 --> 01:22:47,670
or just a different.
Your experiences have taught you that

1775
01:22:47,740 --> 01:22:50,910
that struggle is where the happiness
comes from and most people are.

1776
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:53,500
They think that the happiness is
avoiding the struggle.

1777
01:22:53,530 --> 01:22:55,690
It's a real cat.
It's a trick.

1778
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,140
It's like that feeling that your body
gives you.

1779
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,340
Like when you don't want to go to the
gym,

1780
01:23:00,341 --> 01:23:01,000
like,
Oh,

1781
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:01,870
come on man,
don't go.

1782
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,780
But if you push through that,
then afterwards,

1783
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:07,090
like I fucking did this time.
Yes,

1784
01:23:07,091 --> 01:23:09,790
I've now I feel.
And then also you see the results in

1785
01:23:09,791 --> 01:23:12,340
your body.
Whereas if you just give in to that I'm

1786
01:23:12,341 --> 01:23:15,260
lazy thing all the time,
then you just have this dumpy doughy

1787
01:23:15,310 --> 01:23:16,143
body.

1788
01:23:16,190 --> 01:23:17,510
Then you feel like shit when you're
naked.

1789
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,780
A lot of problems.
Yeah.

1790
01:23:20,781 --> 01:23:23,300
You're your experience.
He's still doing yoga.

1791
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:26,570
I had not.
Not like I should because my back's all

1792
01:23:26,571 --> 01:23:28,940
jacked up now.
I think probably from not doing it,

1793
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:31,960
I need to get back into doing it for a
while.

1794
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:32,451
Right.
I was.

1795
01:23:32,451 --> 01:23:33,284
Yeah,
and I actually,

1796
01:23:33,410 --> 01:23:37,130
I actually never felt better.
Just the,

1797
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:40,820
well,
I mean since I was probably 18 years old

1798
01:23:40,821 --> 01:23:44,620
for most my most,
my year was in,

1799
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:48,650
was guiding hunters and that involved
packing out animals.

1800
01:23:49,010 --> 01:23:50,300
So if you think about it,
I don't,

1801
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:53,390
I probably should.
I'm one day I'll sit down and try to

1802
01:23:53,391 --> 01:23:55,760
figure out how many animals I've carried
out,

1803
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:59,090
like heavy packs,
a hundred pound pack probably in.

1804
01:23:59,630 --> 01:24:01,250
I don't even,
I wouldn't even want to guess.

1805
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:06,280
It's a lot more than probably most
people a strong back from that,

1806
01:24:07,070 --> 01:24:08,570
but it's a weird.
Yeah,

1807
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:09,680
it's really.
Yeah,

1808
01:24:09,681 --> 01:24:13,250
it's just very.
And now it's only been

1809
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:19,400
17,
18 years of really doing all the time.

1810
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,680
You just start feeling like,
oh,

1811
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:25,280
the back end here and oh no.
And I think when I was doing the yoga

1812
01:24:25,281 --> 01:24:27,890
more,
I didn't get those pains a little bit

1813
01:24:27,891 --> 01:24:28,790
more flexible.

1814
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:30,210
Yeah.
The decompression,

1815
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:34,110
that's a big part of what yoga is.
Yoga makes you move your body in a way

1816
01:24:34,111 --> 01:24:36,130
that's almost the opposite of carrying
weight

1817
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:37,230
I think.
Yeah,

1818
01:24:37,330 --> 01:24:38,950
that's exactly it.
I mean,

1819
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,970
you just got so much weighted down,
so much compression.

1820
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:44,280
Oh,
the toddler Jujitsu people have turned

1821
01:24:44,281 --> 01:24:45,100
to yoga now.

1822
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,150
The to realize that they,
like,

1823
01:24:47,151 --> 01:24:49,670
there's a lot of guys that for the
longest time me included,

1824
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:53,060
what we did was uh,
like working out with weights,

1825
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:55,460
maybe kettle bells,
like heavy,

1826
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,770
heavy explosive stuff,
box jumps,

1827
01:24:57,771 --> 01:24:59,360
things on those lines.
And then Jujitsu.

1828
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,990
So the idea was that the working out
with weights would prepare you for the

1829
01:25:02,991 --> 01:25:05,180
Jujitsu and,
but then everybody gets injured.

1830
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:10,100
But a lot of guys have turned now
towards yoga in Jujitsu because there's

1831
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:15,101
something about the rugged smashing and
crushing and pulling and Yanking of g of

1832
01:25:15,321 --> 01:25:20,321
Jujitsu that it's complemented by the
stretching and elongating and holding

1833
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:25,580
static positions and completely
non-explosive actions of Yoga.

1834
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:28,640
I think there's A.
I was actually talking with one of my

1835
01:25:28,641 --> 01:25:30,170
good buddies,
David Wise,

1836
01:25:30,171 --> 01:25:34,480
he's actually a Olympic gold medalist
for halfpipe freeskiing.

1837
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:37,690
I mean he's just like the top of his
game for what is happening.

1838
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,520
What does that mean?
So he does the halfpipe like said it'd

1839
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:43,700
be like half a water bottle.
Cut Pipe.

1840
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:46,410
Does it tricks in it?
Oh Skis.

1841
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:49,850
It's Kinda like what Shaun white does on
a snowboard or skis,

1842
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:55,390
but we were talking about exercise that
controls those little muscles for

1843
01:25:56,361 --> 01:25:58,870
balance because he's big into hunting
too.

1844
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:02,030
It was like,
and he's when you're moving through the

1845
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:03,740
mountains,
you've got that heavy on.

1846
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,100
Sometimes when you see an animal it
means the difference between you getting

1847
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:09,140
it not is it the speed that you get
there.

1848
01:26:09,770 --> 01:26:12,530
So you just have to have that,
that ability,

1849
01:26:12,531 --> 01:26:15,260
that agility.
So when you set your foot on something,

1850
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:16,660
know that that's that word.

1851
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:18,310
That's where it's going to stay.
Right.

1852
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:21,980
And you don't get off balance because a
lot of the stuff I hunts mountain type

1853
01:26:21,981 --> 01:26:26,981
stuff cliffs and especially in Alaska
and New Zealand.

1854
01:26:27,170 --> 01:26:29,780
Other stuff is dangerous country.
People die in that.

1855
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:32,990
I mean,
cams friend died in an area that I was

1856
01:26:32,991 --> 01:26:35,270
hunting that same year for,
for dall sheep,

1857
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:37,090
you know,
and that's just like,

1858
01:26:37,370 --> 01:26:38,840
yeah,
and that's a guy that does it all the

1859
01:26:38,841 --> 01:26:42,680
time like you need,
it's very important to have that

1860
01:26:42,681 --> 01:26:44,150
balance,
that balance,

1861
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:49,200
those muscles that you can't lift for.
It's the weird being able to stand on

1862
01:26:49,221 --> 01:26:53,980
one leg and move around in every
direction because especially when you've

1863
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:56,060
got weight on your back,
packing something out,

1864
01:26:56,540 --> 01:26:59,960
that kind of weird agility,
strength training and those guys that do

1865
01:26:59,961 --> 01:27:03,020
those kinds of sports like skiing and
snowboarding and all that,

1866
01:27:03,290 --> 01:27:06,260
and they're like cats.
You can not tip them over.

1867
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:07,970
I was like,
I want to be like that.

1868
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:11,540
Like even Shane Dorian and I guy when he
walks in the mountains,

1869
01:27:11,541 --> 01:27:12,500
it's,
it's different.

1870
01:27:12,501 --> 01:27:14,270
Like his balance,
he's so centered.

1871
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,540
It makes him quiet and it's just like,
it's cool.

1872
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:19,310
Right.
So from all the surfing.

1873
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:20,470
Yeah.
Um,

1874
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:22,300
do you ever do a Kettlebell?
Windmills?

1875
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:24,110
That's a great one for that as well.
Yeah,

1876
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:27,890
I've done that a couple times.
Something about holding that overhead

1877
01:27:27,891 --> 01:27:30,560
and then bending all your body down,
touching the floor,

1878
01:27:30,561 --> 01:27:35,420
and then extending backup it.
It put strength into the core or weird

1879
01:27:35,421 --> 01:27:37,190
way,
especially if you can do it with heavy

1880
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:40,720
weights like you can.
You have a church Turkish get up.

1881
01:27:41,070 --> 01:27:43,540
That's what I've been doing.
A Turkish get up there,

1882
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:45,590
so there's so non-glamorous.
You're right.

1883
01:27:45,591 --> 01:27:48,380
Everybody else do curls,
press and stuff and get jacked,

1884
01:27:48,381 --> 01:27:52,520
but for functional strength is very few
things that are as good as a Turkish

1885
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,530
getup.
There's something about pressing that

1886
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:58,130
weight on your back,
getting up to your knees,

1887
01:27:58,610 --> 01:28:00,920
anchoring your body up,
standing all the way up,

1888
01:28:00,921 --> 01:28:02,750
and then lowering yourself all the way
back down again.

1889
01:28:02,751 --> 01:28:05,720
It's just phenomenal for all these weird
muscles.

1890
01:28:06,050 --> 01:28:09,550
Your back and your neck and shoulder
stability and all these gifts that

1891
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:10,810
people ignore.
Yeah,

1892
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:11,750
yeah.
That's it.

1893
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:13,970
In the off season I'll try to do.
See I'm.

1894
01:28:14,010 --> 01:28:17,330
I'm out there a lot with the pack on all
day long,

1895
01:28:17,331 --> 01:28:22,331
so for me I'd have to find something
that's not that right to get more

1896
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,220
benefit and I think that that's why the
yoga thing,

1897
01:28:25,221 --> 01:28:28,970
because if I go for to work out and put
a heavy pack on and go for a hike,

1898
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:32,030
well for work I do that for 12 hours a
day.

1899
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:35,240
So like the one hour I go do it when I'm
not working.

1900
01:28:35,241 --> 01:28:36,620
Isn't gonna do much for me.

1901
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:40,540
Your back must be like really fucking
strong for you think about 17,

1902
01:28:40,541 --> 01:28:42,170
18 years of doing that?
Yeah,

1903
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:45,130
I mean your back must be ridiculous.
You know,

1904
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:46,020
it's,
you know,

1905
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:47,590
you aren't carrying a heavy pack every
day,

1906
01:28:47,591 --> 01:28:49,870
but there's been a substantial number
of.

1907
01:28:49,930 --> 01:28:51,420
Even if you're doing it once a week.
Yeah,

1908
01:28:51,510 --> 01:28:52,420
yeah.
There's definitely.

1909
01:28:52,421 --> 01:28:54,670
It would probably help you.
That's what you get strong.

1910
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,380
If you're doing it everyday,
I'd probably break you down.

1911
01:28:56,381 --> 01:28:58,330
Yeah.
But doing it once a week,

1912
01:28:58,331 --> 01:29:01,090
that gives your body a chance to break
down and then slowly recover.

1913
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:03,840
Most.
I'm that guy that's like 55 years old

1914
01:29:03,841 --> 01:29:07,170
and can't walk.
Have you seen that outdoorsmen

1915
01:29:08,980 --> 01:29:10,710
trainer?
That thing's amazing.

1916
01:29:10,711 --> 01:29:11,310
Yeah.
That's cool.

1917
01:29:11,310 --> 01:29:14,610
I love hiking with that thing on,
so it keeps the.

1918
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:17,790
It keeps the weight real centered.
I haven't actually used that.

1919
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:21,330
I'm
just because the time it takes to take

1920
01:29:21,331 --> 01:29:22,520
my bag off,
I've only got it

1921
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:24,580
one of them,
so I haven't actually used it,

1922
01:29:24,581 --> 01:29:25,660
but it,
it doesn't make sense.

1923
01:29:25,661 --> 01:29:26,800
It looks pretty cool.
No,

1924
01:29:26,920 --> 01:29:29,650
it's very cool.
It's a lot of athletes are using that

1925
01:29:29,651 --> 01:29:30,700
now to.
It's a,

1926
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:34,690
they like it better than weight vests
and just sits on your body better,

1927
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:36,130
you know?
That's cool.

1928
01:29:36,220 --> 01:29:37,530
Yeah.
It's uh,

1929
01:29:37,870 --> 01:29:40,660
for a person who lives,
like say if you live in the Midwest,

1930
01:29:40,661 --> 01:29:43,840
like say if you live in Kansas where
it's all flat and you want to prepare

1931
01:29:43,841 --> 01:29:46,120
for an elk hunt,
what do you do?

1932
01:29:46,180 --> 01:29:46,541
Well,
yeah.

1933
01:29:46,541 --> 01:29:50,350
What the fuck would you do?
I guess box steps with like a weighted

1934
01:29:50,351 --> 01:29:51,940
pack over and over and over again.

1935
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:56,910
You know,
I get asked that question a lot and I

1936
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,530
kind of,
when I start,

1937
01:29:59,770 --> 01:30:03,070
when I say late teens or whatever,
trying to,

1938
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:07,330
I'd see elk and then just trying to be
able to get that endurance where I never

1939
01:30:07,331 --> 01:30:12,331
had to stop and what I would do is I
would go out and I would do something

1940
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:16,810
that was prolonged to where the point
that I had to stop,

1941
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:19,290
I wouldn't stop,
but I would switch the way that I did.

1942
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:21,910
Did it.
So say I pick them out or stairs or

1943
01:30:21,911 --> 01:30:24,700
whatever and you can run and then the
point that you'd have to,

1944
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:27,070
I'd have to stop.
I turn around and start walking

1945
01:30:27,071 --> 01:30:31,060
backwards and then I would turn to start
sidestepping and I would refuse to stop.

1946
01:30:31,061 --> 01:30:35,410
So I'd pick a point that I knew I
couldn't or almost couldn't get to if I

1947
01:30:35,411 --> 01:30:38,260
walked up a mountain one day and thought
I have to stop now.

1948
01:30:38,261 --> 01:30:41,130
At that point where I had to stop,
I would just switch the type of muscle

1949
01:30:41,131 --> 01:30:43,480
and movement that I would do.
So I thought,

1950
01:30:43,481 --> 01:30:46,240
okay,
like if you're some kind of workout,

1951
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:51,720
whatever that workout is,
like some kind of say stairs or

1952
01:30:52,241 --> 01:30:55,030
whatever,
if you're running stairs and you go

1953
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:59,260
until your body's like absolutely I
cannot go anymore.

1954
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,470
But keep moving in just a different
muscle group

1955
01:31:03,790 --> 01:31:05,110
backwards.
Like I do,

1956
01:31:05,111 --> 01:31:06,700
they don't want to bag.
But if I'm,

1957
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:09,790
if I'm doing like kickboxing on a heavy
bag and I'm exhausted,

1958
01:31:10,030 --> 01:31:12,190
like say if I'm throwing punches and
roundhouse kicks,

1959
01:31:12,191 --> 01:31:15,610
I get so exhausted I'm almost done and I
know there's still a minute left to the

1960
01:31:15,611 --> 01:31:17,860
Brown,
then I'll switch to front kicks and

1961
01:31:17,861 --> 01:31:20,010
weirdly enough I have energy to do that.
Yeah.

1962
01:31:20,170 --> 01:31:22,960
It's like I almost can't kick the way
I've been kicking butt.

1963
01:31:22,961 --> 01:31:24,220
I can kick otherwise.
Yeah.

1964
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:27,820
It's a weird way that I started just
building endurance to the point where

1965
01:31:27,821 --> 01:31:30,850
then I never had to stop.
But if you're a guy lives in a flat

1966
01:31:30,851 --> 01:31:32,320
area,
you'd.

1967
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:33,090
Ah,
that's,

1968
01:31:33,090 --> 01:31:34,300
that's exactly it.
I don't know.

1969
01:31:34,330 --> 01:31:38,080
You'd have to get like I've seen guys on
those stair machines where it's a

1970
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:41,110
rotating stairs and they have a backpack
on like a heavy backpack.

1971
01:31:41,111 --> 01:31:42,700
I think that'd be the way to do it and
then not.

1972
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,040
And then try to go for like five or six
hours.

1973
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:49,390
Fuck,
nobody's going to do that.

1974
01:31:49,391 --> 01:31:50,740
No,
that's the thing.

1975
01:31:50,741 --> 01:31:52,330
You,
you no one's ever prepared.

1976
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:53,343
Well that's the thing is,

1977
01:31:53,720 --> 01:31:54,560
I mean,
I hate to say it,

1978
01:31:54,561 --> 01:31:57,050
but how do you prepare it?
Will you just have to do it?

1979
01:31:57,080 --> 01:32:02,080
You can't,
you can't actually go into a go into a

1980
01:32:02,381 --> 01:32:05,890
gym and think that you're going to be
able to carry a heavy pack for days at a

1981
01:32:05,891 --> 01:32:06,780
time.
No,

1982
01:32:06,850 --> 01:32:11,200
there's no.
Like for what I do at a hiking speed,

1983
01:32:11,201 --> 01:32:13,000
carrying a pack,
I'm really good at that.

1984
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,900
But this year we went in,
we wanted to go in to the spa was a

1985
01:32:16,901 --> 01:32:21,901
little bit further and I got on a bike.
I got smoked my 65 years old.

1986
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:25,060
I mean he rides a bike all the time.
I don't write them.

1987
01:32:25,061 --> 01:32:27,820
I don't even know if I knew how to ride
a bike when I got on it,

1988
01:32:28,260 --> 01:32:31,570
but it kicked my ass so it was just
different.

1989
01:32:32,140 --> 01:32:32,973
It was like,
no,

1990
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:35,170
all the hiking every day with the pack.

1991
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,310
I thought,
oh no,

1992
01:32:36,311 --> 01:32:39,190
this will be no problem and I get on
that bike and get my ass kicked.

1993
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,050
I was like,
you cannot,

1994
01:32:41,410 --> 01:32:45,570
you have to do to do in a certain level,
but there's certain things I could.

1995
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,440
You could probably do.
You could,

1996
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:49,500
I could pedal,
you know,

1997
01:32:49,501 --> 01:32:52,600
and a little bit.
And then I'd be like on a stationary

1998
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:56,540
bike everyday and then you'd have more
muscle memory for that type of action.

1999
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:59,560
So if you did the stare thing,
I think that's probably the closest you

2000
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:01,480
could get to get that muscle memory.
Yeah,

2001
01:33:01,481 --> 01:33:02,810
I think it would be a stair thing.
Yeah.

2002
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:05,890
Or finding actual stairs.
Actual stairs,

2003
01:33:05,891 --> 01:33:07,390
running up flights of stairs.
Yeah.

2004
01:33:07,391 --> 01:33:09,550
There's a good place out here in
Calabasas

2005
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:13,860
that has several.
It's a up the side of this hill,

2006
01:33:14,040 --> 01:33:14,821
like many,
many,

2007
01:33:14,821 --> 01:33:16,770
many stairs.
It's probably like a quarter mile all

2008
01:33:16,771 --> 01:33:19,850
the way to the top and I'll run it up
and go down and run it up and go down.

2009
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:21,080
Awesome.
Let's do it.

2010
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:25,820
People in the midwest where it's flat,
she'd open up gyms like rent stairwells,

2011
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,730
you just have packs at the bottom and
people get a membership and you can just

2012
01:33:28,731 --> 01:33:31,910
go up the stairs as many times as they
want up and downstairs.

2013
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:34,350
It's amazing how just carrying your body

2014
01:33:34,410 --> 01:33:38,520
uphills is so difficult.
Like it doesn't to a person who never

2015
01:33:38,521 --> 01:33:39,150
does it.
Like,

2016
01:33:39,150 --> 01:33:39,983
oh,
we're hiking,

2017
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:41,071
walking.
What?

2018
01:33:41,071 --> 01:33:41,904
You're walking outside.

2019
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:44,790
No,
it's way harder.

2020
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,400
It just doesn't seem like it should be,
you know,

2021
01:33:47,730 --> 01:33:49,710
every,
every ounce of weight on your body or

2022
01:33:49,711 --> 01:33:51,330
you,
she even your shoes.

2023
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:54,120
People buy these real heavy
mountaineering boots because like those

2024
01:33:54,121 --> 01:33:55,560
are the.
And then they never wear them in a

2025
01:33:55,561 --> 01:33:57,540
mountain and then they try to go up the
mountain.

2026
01:33:57,541 --> 01:33:59,370
It's like,
what did they say?

2027
01:33:59,371 --> 01:34:02,930
Every pound on your foot's like eight
pounds on your back and get a pair of

2028
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,310
five pound boots and it's a lot of
weight,

2029
01:34:05,460 --> 01:34:07,710
but you do need some sort of stability.
Right?

2030
01:34:07,711 --> 01:34:09,120
I mean the reason why those boots
exists,

2031
01:34:09,121 --> 01:34:10,560
like if you were going to go to the
Alps,

2032
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:12,210
you need that stuff.
So yeah.

2033
01:34:12,240 --> 01:34:13,950
Yeah.
And you have to actually walk different

2034
01:34:13,951 --> 01:34:15,390
and um,
a lot of people don't realize that.

2035
01:34:15,650 --> 01:34:17,370
Yeah,
more of a rocking step.

2036
01:34:17,371 --> 01:34:18,510
And then a,
uh,

2037
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:22,320
almost like ski boots.
So ski cubits and you've got to walk on

2038
01:34:22,321 --> 01:34:24,780
your lot of people don't walk on their
toes.

2039
01:34:25,610 --> 01:34:27,470
Big problem.
Well,

2040
01:34:27,471 --> 01:34:31,460
it's modern shoes will have started
going heel to toe,

2041
01:34:31,461 --> 01:34:34,670
heel to toe.
Humans are supposed to go ball the foot

2042
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,160
down to the heel ball,
but that's how we're supposed to run.

2043
01:34:37,370 --> 01:34:40,400
So we're supposed to walk.
But modern shoes that particularly ones

2044
01:34:40,401 --> 01:34:43,010
with heels,
they just accentuate that heel to toe

2045
01:34:43,190 --> 01:34:44,390
thing,
which is real weird.

2046
01:34:44,391 --> 01:34:44,670
Weird.

2047
01:34:44,670 --> 01:34:45,503
Yeah.
It's not.

2048
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:50,660
Well if you'd like people.
When I was a kid I learned to walk with

2049
01:34:51,650 --> 01:34:54,360
the pads of my fingers just quiet.
Right around.

2050
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:55,260
Do you,
uh,

2051
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,540
do you stalk animals with socks on?
Do still do that?

2052
01:34:57,680 --> 01:34:58,130
Socks

2053
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,330
or barefoot?
Mostly,

2054
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,340
yeah.
Just depends.

2055
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:03,770
Have you ever tried those?
Like five finger shoes?

2056
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:06,190
Those Viv says before?
Yeah,

2057
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,520
I've got pretty tough feet,
so it's nothing to just take my socks

2058
01:35:10,521 --> 01:35:13,370
off shoes and just walk my socks and the
real quiet.

2059
01:35:13,450 --> 01:35:15,230
It would.
If you're in like a rocky area,

2060
01:35:15,470 --> 01:35:16,550
I'll still do it.
Really?

2061
01:35:16,551 --> 01:35:18,740
Yeah.
Like were you were hunting in Nevada?

2062
01:35:18,741 --> 01:35:22,090
I mean that's the idea that barefoot
with socks.

2063
01:35:22,100 --> 01:35:24,320
Yeah.
I'll go a couple miles and that stuff.

2064
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:25,820
Yeah.
You just.

2065
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,410
You just,
you get used to it.

2066
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:30,350
You never.
It's kind of a weird because I always

2067
01:35:30,351 --> 01:35:30,831
thought,
oh,

2068
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:34,460
your feet get tough that your feet
really don't get any tougher.

2069
01:35:34,461 --> 01:35:37,870
You just get used to the sensation of
your feet hurting you.

2070
01:35:37,871 --> 01:35:38,960
Exactly.
Well,

2071
01:35:38,961 --> 01:35:40,520
they do get tough if you go as far as
that.

2072
01:35:40,521 --> 01:35:43,400
You ever see that dual survivor guy?
What's the guys name?

2073
01:35:43,430 --> 01:35:46,160
Corey something or another.
He had the most disgusting feet ever.

2074
01:35:46,420 --> 01:35:49,040
Just.
He just walked everywhere barefoot.

2075
01:35:49,120 --> 01:35:50,510
Yeah.
He would go to the forest.

2076
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:54,110
They would do these survivor shows.
It was like there was a series of shows

2077
01:35:54,111 --> 01:35:57,920
after survivor man came out that were
ripping off survivor man in a way,

2078
01:35:58,670 --> 01:36:01,760
and this was one of the weird ones
called dual survivor.

2079
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,360
It was hammered.
Everybody something.

2080
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:04,520
It was like so staged,
like,

2081
01:36:04,521 --> 01:36:07,550
what do you think we should do that we
need to make a bone marrow?

2082
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:10,760
And they'd be wandering through the
forest and you see this guy's fucking

2083
01:36:10,761 --> 01:36:12,390
disgusting feet,
feet.

2084
01:36:13,650 --> 01:36:15,590
I mean,
that's barely a human foot.

2085
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:17,180
Yeah.
Now that in that case,

2086
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:19,190
I mean,
I guess I take that back.

2087
01:36:19,191 --> 01:36:21,680
Your feet do get tough for you build
calluses,

2088
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,110
but you can get a rock right in that
arch area.

2089
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:27,250
I'll still hurt,
but the bottom of the hill,

2090
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:28,620
we're just there.

2091
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:32,420
They're dark like a soul.
It literally looks like he's got

2092
01:36:32,421 --> 01:36:36,320
something on his feet because I really,
I take pride in my foot calluses.

2093
01:36:36,321 --> 01:36:37,850
They just,
if I ever lost them,

2094
01:36:37,851 --> 01:36:40,990
I feel like I'd start getting blisters
and fewer deal.

2095
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:43,130
Those are,
that's next level.

2096
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,680
Well,
I've seen some people that go to the

2097
01:36:45,681 --> 01:36:48,560
woods and they go hiking and they don't,
they,

2098
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:52,970
they're not prepared for it.
And they give these horrible like areas

2099
01:36:52,971 --> 01:36:55,310
of their foot where their skin gets
rubbed off,

2100
01:36:55,640 --> 01:36:56,990
rubbed raw,
especially in the back,

2101
01:36:56,991 --> 01:36:59,570
like the heel area.
When I first started guiding,

2102
01:36:59,571 --> 01:37:04,040
this guy was from Pennsylvania and he
just,

2103
01:37:04,220 --> 01:37:06,140
he just kept pushing himself,
was just cool.

2104
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:09,180
He kept hiking and I always tell them,
you know,

2105
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:11,540
if something,
you know you're aren't going to keep up

2106
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:15,590
you just because you aren't used to it,
so just stop and I'll stop this,

2107
01:37:15,591 --> 01:37:16,424
that and the other thing.

2108
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:17,930
And I was like,
if anything is wrong,

2109
01:37:17,931 --> 01:37:19,760
let me know.
He started to get a blister,

2110
01:37:19,761 --> 01:37:23,120
but he didn't say anything and his foot
started getting rubbed down.

2111
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,340
Why would he just had him duck tape it
up.

2112
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:27,950
Ended up getting gang green.
Whoa.

2113
01:37:28,010 --> 01:37:31,040
Yeah.
Just from his foot getting rubbed inside

2114
01:37:31,041 --> 01:37:32,750
of his shoe and then just keep pushing
himself.

2115
01:37:32,751 --> 01:37:35,000
Pushing himself.
Or how many days did it take to get gang

2116
01:37:35,001 --> 01:37:36,380
green?
Not that long.

2117
01:37:36,381 --> 01:37:40,880
I think it was for five days.
The fifth day he had gangrene.

2118
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:42,660
So what happens?
You got to get him to the hospital.

2119
01:37:42,670 --> 01:37:43,410
Yeah.
Yeah.

2120
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:47,150
You get blood poisoning of some kind.
I think so.

2121
01:37:47,151 --> 01:37:48,740
Weird.
Wow.

2122
01:37:48,741 --> 01:37:51,930
I didn't get gang green from hiking,
you know,

2123
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:55,710
you just didn't just toughing it out and
I'm just going to it out and didn't do

2124
01:37:55,711 --> 01:37:56,070
anything

2125
01:37:56,070 --> 01:37:57,960
for it.
I don't and I probably didn't hear it

2126
01:37:57,961 --> 01:38:00,300
because it hurt.
Take the sock on it so he's probably

2127
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,000
right.
I don't really know what his situation

2128
01:38:03,001 --> 01:38:04,140
was,
but it wasn't good.

2129
01:38:04,470 --> 01:38:05,820
You know,
putting the.

2130
01:38:06,060 --> 01:38:08,520
So you probably had it in a boot
sweating all day,

2131
01:38:09,060 --> 01:38:12,840
rubbing on it,
getting sweat and bacteria.

2132
01:38:13,170 --> 01:38:15,390
Who knows that it just had gotten
infected.

2133
01:38:16,250 --> 01:38:17,670
It was nasty.
I mean you,

2134
01:38:17,970 --> 01:38:20,220
you could smell it.
It was rotting flesh.

2135
01:38:20,221 --> 01:38:23,430
It's disgusting word.
Otherwise folks put some duct tape on

2136
01:38:23,431 --> 01:38:24,510
that.
Just some duct tape on it.

2137
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:27,210
You take a lot of guys out that have
never hunted before.

2138
01:38:27,630 --> 01:38:29,140
Yeah,
quite a few often.

2139
01:38:29,150 --> 01:38:33,240
You do that every year.
A couple times a year I would say.

2140
01:38:33,870 --> 01:38:37,170
What does that do you enjoy that is that
I had experienced.

2141
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,580
No,
it's fun for me.

2142
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:42,570
It's mostly guys that have.
They may have tried and may have been

2143
01:38:42,571 --> 01:38:47,571
successful or it might be their first
real big game type hunt or whatever.

2144
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:53,720
I like it because a,
I get to be a part of the experience and

2145
01:38:54,570 --> 01:38:58,490
kind of helped shape that first
experience because you could go out with

2146
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:01,360
some.
I mean I kind of say some hunt.

2147
01:39:01,410 --> 01:39:05,730
There are hunters out there that fit the
stereotype and it's a shame I think

2148
01:39:05,731 --> 01:39:08,970
somebody that's getting into hunting,
if they go with somebody that fits that

2149
01:39:08,971 --> 01:39:11,760
stereotype and they're probably going to
have a bad experience and that's not

2150
01:39:11,761 --> 01:39:16,160
what hunting is to me.
So I think that by me being able to kind

2151
01:39:16,161 --> 01:39:21,000
of help form that first experience and
make it about the experience because for

2152
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:21,900
me,
when I go hunting,

2153
01:39:21,901 --> 01:39:26,610
it's not just about killing something.
It's about the entire experience around.

2154
01:39:26,640 --> 01:39:28,320
It's the,
that's what hunting is.

2155
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:30,210
You go out into the woods,
you,

2156
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:34,310
there's just certain things that I do
that other people might not do,

2157
01:39:34,530 --> 01:39:36,030
but there are a lot of people that do
it.

2158
01:39:36,031 --> 01:39:38,880
Say I pay attention to the plants that
are there.

2159
01:39:38,881 --> 01:39:41,670
I pay attention to really everything,
you know,

2160
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,490
the things that I noticed someone else
might notice that I point those out to

2161
01:39:44,491 --> 01:39:47,520
them and,
and just like give them an overall good

2162
01:39:47,521 --> 01:39:51,000
experience of why we're out there and
what we're doing.

2163
01:39:51,001 --> 01:39:52,230
And that's fun.

2164
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:54,990
Well,
I think a lot of people have an idea of

2165
01:39:54,991 --> 01:39:59,130
what a hunter is from television or from
the movies or from duck dynasty or

2166
01:39:59,131 --> 01:40:03,010
something like that,
and a lot of that is maybe even Trieste

2167
01:40:03,011 --> 01:40:06,220
and hunters who are maybe overweight not
fit and yeah,

2168
01:40:06,310 --> 01:40:11,310
they don't understand that western big
game style hunting like you do is really

2169
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:16,610
an athletic endeavor as well as a skill
as well as a like a really comprehensive

2170
01:40:20,580 --> 01:40:24,510
knowledge based approach to problem
solving.

2171
01:40:24,930 --> 01:40:27,690
Like you have to know what you're doing.
There's so many factors

2172
01:40:27,940 --> 01:40:29,480
so much that goes into it.
I mean you're,

2173
01:40:29,510 --> 01:40:30,780
you're backpacking,
you're,

2174
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:33,430
you've got.
You also have to have a certain amount

2175
01:40:33,431 --> 01:40:38,080
of Bush skills and I call it like
there's a lot of people that do it,

2176
01:40:38,081 --> 01:40:42,010
but they don't have those,
those little nuance skills that you pick

2177
01:40:42,011 --> 01:40:45,460
up over over time.
There's a lot of things that I do that

2178
01:40:45,461 --> 01:40:47,800
maybe people that have hunted their
whole life's won't even notice.

2179
01:40:47,801 --> 01:40:51,100
Just the more you do things,
the more the better you get at it.

2180
01:40:51,101 --> 01:40:52,840
The more you notice,
the more you've had times,

2181
01:40:52,841 --> 01:40:56,860
two more times you fucked up and then
figured out why that got messed up and

2182
01:40:56,861 --> 01:41:00,910
then you try to remedy it in the future,
don't do it this way and you just start

2183
01:41:00,911 --> 01:41:04,480
paying attention to really small things
that other people might not pay

2184
01:41:04,481 --> 01:41:07,000
attention to.
Just like the way that I.

2185
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:10,000
it's really weird.
I've noticed even went from when I first

2186
01:41:10,001 --> 01:41:13,620
started hunting until now,
the way that I do things is just

2187
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:16,450
completely different.
It's almost like I have a method and a

2188
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:19,210
system,
but it's all based on the millions of

2189
01:41:19,211 --> 01:41:24,211
times that things haven't gone right and
trying to to progress into be a better

2190
01:41:24,461 --> 01:41:25,211
hunter.
Right.

2191
01:41:25,211 --> 01:41:26,740
Like you see this situation like,
okay,

2192
01:41:26,741 --> 01:41:28,780
I fucked this up before.
Exactly.

2193
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,340
No,
I know what's going on here.

2194
01:41:30,341 --> 01:41:32,620
Why is the wind at the back of my neck?
I got to get out of here now.

2195
01:41:32,621 --> 01:41:34,300
I got to back down,
go around,

2196
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:38,800
go around trying to push it.
When you pick areas as people that I

2197
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:42,730
hung with all go into a new area and
I'll be fairly successful for not going

2198
01:41:42,731 --> 01:41:45,760
into that area,
but I've done it enough times to where,

2199
01:41:45,761 --> 01:41:48,860
okay,
I do things a certain way and it's

2200
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,190
constantly changing too as the
environment changes,

2201
01:41:51,191 --> 01:41:53,500
but you know,
if I'm going into an area instead of

2202
01:41:53,501 --> 01:41:56,770
going down that hill,
I go around the other way and look at

2203
01:41:56,771 --> 01:41:59,680
the hill facing me or things that I
don't know.

2204
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:02,440
It's really hard to explain to like when
I'm out there I can explain it a lot

2205
01:42:02,441 --> 01:42:03,820
better.
I can explain,

2206
01:42:03,821 --> 01:42:04,990
okay,
this is what I'm doing and this is why

2207
01:42:04,991 --> 01:42:06,460
I'm doing it,
and then there's other stuff that you

2208
01:42:06,461 --> 01:42:09,520
do.
The easiest is just more of an instinct

2209
01:42:09,550 --> 01:42:12,850
than anything and I think a lot of
people have those hunter instincts.

2210
01:42:12,851 --> 01:42:17,230
Those are the whole point of that Apex
Predator show was to talk about just the

2211
01:42:17,231 --> 01:42:20,080
instincts that humans have that we may
not even tap into.

2212
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,360
When you say as a father,
I think you just.

2213
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:25,120
You have that instinct to protect your
children at all costs.

2214
01:42:25,121 --> 01:42:26,560
I'm not a father,
I don't have that,

2215
01:42:26,860 --> 01:42:29,140
that instinct,
but I'm sure it's in there somewhere.

2216
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:32,770
It's like that.
Nobody has to teach you that you just

2217
01:42:32,820 --> 01:42:35,010
kind of all of a sudden go,
yeah,

2218
01:42:35,070 --> 01:42:38,340
that's a switch,
which is something goes off if I,

2219
01:42:38,341 --> 01:42:41,090
I think that most people would,
if they were carrying their child in

2220
01:42:41,091 --> 01:42:44,410
some kind of danger,
they would do some kind of natural

2221
01:42:44,470 --> 01:42:48,520
instinctive movement to get that child
away from the danger for sure.

2222
01:42:48,640 --> 01:42:50,360
I mean,
that's literally walk human being

2223
01:42:50,370 --> 01:42:55,370
survived as long as we did in hunting is
one of those primal things that tap into

2224
01:42:55,931 --> 01:42:59,650
and there's some things that are just
instinctual and there's not a lot of,

2225
01:42:59,651 --> 01:43:02,860
uh,
there's not a lot of lessons that people

2226
01:43:02,861 --> 01:43:06,280
can talk about as far as like what
instincts are.

2227
01:43:06,370 --> 01:43:08,410
Yeah.
It's something that you just have to do

2228
01:43:08,411 --> 01:43:10,110
it.
That's why it's an instinct is not.

2229
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:12,280
You can't put it into a category.
You can't go to a class.

2230
01:43:12,281 --> 01:43:14,380
You can,
you can't read a book on instincts.

2231
01:43:14,620 --> 01:43:18,700
You can know what they are,
but that whole instinctual,

2232
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:23,650
it just has to happen.
The grizzly bear charges something else

2233
01:43:23,651 --> 01:43:25,360
takes over,
but it's not.

2234
01:43:25,630 --> 01:43:28,180
It's not a Stevie said.
He's like.

2235
01:43:28,181 --> 01:43:31,030
It wasn't even a primal level who is not
fight or flight.

2236
01:43:31,031 --> 01:43:32,740
It was just this,
this weird.

2237
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:35,230
You just did what you had to do in that
very second.

2238
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:36,860
There was no thought.
Yeah,

2239
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:37,870
I don't know.
Yeah,

2240
01:43:37,871 --> 01:43:40,840
it's you're.
You're almost like your DNA.

2241
01:43:41,370 --> 01:43:42,690
Your DNA is like,
oh,

2242
01:43:42,730 --> 01:43:47,730
we've seen this before.
This happened to a fatty maximus 1500

2243
01:43:48,191 --> 01:43:50,110
years ago.
Your great grandfather was eaten by a

2244
01:43:50,111 --> 01:43:52,040
bear.
Those genes

2245
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:52,873
passed on.

2246
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:53,821
Well,
that time too,

2247
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:56,650
if you've got,
when you're hunting and you go like this

2248
01:43:56,760 --> 01:43:57,990
animal,
whatever,

2249
01:43:57,991 --> 01:44:00,810
and you just have that feeling like,
I should sit here and then it works out

2250
01:44:00,811 --> 01:44:02,070
and you go,
right,

2251
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:05,250
I got to go over this region.
It's just some kind of instinct that

2252
01:44:05,251 --> 01:44:09,000
says,
to survive you need to do this.

2253
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:11,260
It's hard to tap into it and you're out
there enough.

2254
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:14,490
You start to pay attention to the things
that work and things that don't.

2255
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:16,980
Well,
guidelines that has so much experience

2256
01:44:16,981 --> 01:44:18,930
in the woods.
I would imagine that you're kind of

2257
01:44:18,931 --> 01:44:21,120
like,
it's like your data chunking.

2258
01:44:21,410 --> 01:44:23,310
It's like you've seen so many,
like you're like,

2259
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:24,690
oh,
I know what this is.

2260
01:44:24,920 --> 01:44:25,940
Yeah.
That's the way I.

2261
01:44:26,020 --> 01:44:28,340
I,
I kind of like think of instincts is

2262
01:44:28,341 --> 01:44:30,860
like a bunch of ones and Zeros and your
computer,

2263
01:44:31,130 --> 01:44:34,280
so you don't really think about all the
ones in zero patterns that are in your

2264
01:44:34,281 --> 01:44:36,830
head.
You just enter a situation and then

2265
01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:39,080
something you know,
your,

2266
01:44:39,081 --> 01:44:42,680
your instinct is that data processing
of.

2267
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:43,723
Okay,
slow down.

2268
01:44:44,430 --> 01:44:45,620
It might be there.
Yeah.

2269
01:44:46,390 --> 01:44:47,380
Something.
Yeah,

2270
01:44:47,381 --> 01:44:50,800
there's,
there's definitely parts of us that we,

2271
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:55,510
I don't think we were ever going to
really experience it unless you're doing

2272
01:44:55,511 --> 01:44:56,890
something physically,
you know,

2273
01:44:56,891 --> 01:44:58,030
you,
you don't even probably know.

2274
01:44:58,031 --> 01:45:01,690
You have the instinct to get the fuck
away from a bear as it's charging or to

2275
01:45:01,691 --> 01:45:06,691
Juka bear until it actually happens.
You go who that was more like the fuck

2276
01:45:06,761 --> 01:45:10,120
out of here,
but the fact that your brain was capable

2277
01:45:10,121 --> 01:45:15,121
of coming up with that move in that
moment while it's 11 and a half foot

2278
01:45:15,610 --> 01:45:17,710
monster.
Fucking bear was coming down on you.

2279
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:20,070
Well,
and I think the whole Yannis man hitting

2280
01:45:20,071 --> 01:45:21,600
that thing in the face with the
tracking,

2281
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:24,840
that's crazy.
And he probably also,

2282
01:45:24,841 --> 01:45:26,070
I don't know,
you'd have to ask him,

2283
01:45:26,071 --> 01:45:29,030
but it probably didn't even process what
he's saying

2284
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:31,570
dealing and as big as this table.
Right?

2285
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:34,240
It's true.

2286
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:39,000
Just huge.
Just and that turned into,

2287
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:43,480
I had no clue that he did that because I
wouldn't get was on the back.

2288
01:45:43,481 --> 01:45:44,800
He's like,
I was on his back and I was like,

2289
01:45:44,801 --> 01:45:47,460
yeah,
he juked it in the bear ran away and

2290
01:45:47,570 --> 01:45:48,161
yeah,
it's just like,

2291
01:45:48,161 --> 01:45:50,640
no dude,
I hit it in the face of the trekking.

2292
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,800
Well,
that's why I ran away.

2293
01:45:51,860 --> 01:45:52,700
I was like,
Oh yeah,

2294
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:55,520
okay.
The whole thing that Aspen unbelievable

2295
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:58,730
is that that's the most intense
experience you've ever had in the woods.

2296
01:45:59,080 --> 01:46:03,520
Uh,
intense in that in a different way.

2297
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:06,890
It,
I've had a lot of just momentary.

2298
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:10,150
They're just intense in different ways.
Um,

2299
01:46:10,930 --> 01:46:12,070
but yeah,
that one was,

2300
01:46:12,580 --> 01:46:14,890
that one was pretty intense in the way
that I thought,

2301
01:46:15,630 --> 01:46:17,260
oh,
this bear's going to fucking kill me.

2302
01:46:17,980 --> 01:46:22,480
A big part of what hunting is to is
being able to stay calm in that moment.

2303
01:46:22,690 --> 01:46:24,230
Yeah,
and because you're,

2304
01:46:24,231 --> 01:46:26,710
you're looking for an animal,
you're hiking,

2305
01:46:26,711 --> 01:46:29,260
you're exhausted day in,
day out.

2306
01:46:29,261 --> 01:46:31,750
You're out there for long time and then
all of a sudden it comes down to one

2307
01:46:31,751 --> 01:46:34,420
moment and that wall moment literally
might be five seconds.

2308
01:46:34,421 --> 01:46:37,750
Holy Shit is coming out from behind that
tree draw and it's right there.

2309
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:40,960
And you have to just be able to be
there.

2310
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:43,550
Yeah.
You can't be thinking about something

2311
01:46:43,551 --> 01:46:44,460
else because you just fucked

2312
01:46:44,660 --> 01:46:46,120
and you can't be freaking out.
You can't go,

2313
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:46,881
you to go,
oh my God,

2314
01:46:46,881 --> 01:46:49,800
I can't believe this is happening.
You can't think that either anybody does

2315
01:46:49,801 --> 01:46:50,130
have.

2316
01:46:50,130 --> 01:46:52,950
I mean,
you do freak out on or even I've done it

2317
01:46:52,951 --> 01:46:56,580
a thousand times.
You get that rush of,

2318
01:46:56,610 --> 01:46:59,960
I guess it's that rush of adrenaline.
Do you have,

2319
01:46:59,961 --> 01:47:01,060
um,
something that,

2320
01:47:01,200 --> 01:47:05,010
that you say in your head,
like when you draw back your bow or

2321
01:47:05,011 --> 01:47:07,530
anything like that,
do you have like a series of things like

2322
01:47:07,531 --> 01:47:09,900
a checklist that you go off?
A few things.

2323
01:47:09,901 --> 01:47:11,790
I just,
I guess with my bow,

2324
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:16,560
the one thing I think because I have a
trigger release so I just try to feel

2325
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:20,000
the trigger in my finger,
in the corner,

2326
01:47:20,020 --> 01:47:22,620
my finger.
So I mean I know that I'm not going to

2327
01:47:22,621 --> 01:47:26,370
like slap or punch later,
so if I'm thinking about that,

2328
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,780
but mostly I'm focusing on where I'm.
Yeah,

2329
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:30,440
I guess I,
my checklists would be like,

2330
01:47:30,510 --> 01:47:31,860
drawback,
pick a spot,

2331
01:47:32,280 --> 01:47:34,560
feel the trigger,
let it go.

2332
01:47:34,800 --> 01:47:36,750
Did you ever have any classic archery
training?

2333
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:38,170
No.
No,

2334
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:41,100
no.
I probably would.

2335
01:47:41,190 --> 01:47:44,430
Should you at this point in time?
Well I was talking to Debbie about that

2336
01:47:44,431 --> 01:47:45,510
and he's like,
he's like,

2337
01:47:45,540 --> 01:47:48,990
you could pick up a rubber band and a
pencil and kill something with it.

2338
01:47:48,991 --> 01:47:51,210
Like you just have the instinct to do
it.

2339
01:47:51,211 --> 01:47:55,740
But I,
I've noticed when I started hunting with

2340
01:47:55,741 --> 01:47:59,100
a bow I just kind of tried to pick it up
myself and I did everything wrong,

2341
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:03,840
but I would go to these three d shoots
and winham not like,

2342
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:09,080
not like real tournament's but just like
local things and I know I'm the best

2343
01:48:09,091 --> 01:48:10,740
shop around.
That's great.

2344
01:48:10,950 --> 01:48:11,790
And then you guys would be like,
Hey,

2345
01:48:11,791 --> 01:48:13,050
you're shooting wrong,
you're doing.

2346
01:48:13,110 --> 01:48:16,980
And I just would slap the trigger and I
never thought about holding still.

2347
01:48:16,981 --> 01:48:21,000
I had always just shoot with movement
because I started shooting a,

2348
01:48:21,001 --> 01:48:26,001
a like a long bow and I would watch time
tnn outdoors.

2349
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,090
There's guy named Byron Ferguson.
Have you ever seen his stuff?

2350
01:48:30,420 --> 01:48:33,940
This dude would throw up and aspirin and
shoot it out of the air over and over.

2351
01:48:33,941 --> 01:48:36,360
Yeah.
And his whole thing was be the arrow.

2352
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,730
That was my only archery advice.
Be The arrow.

2353
01:48:38,731 --> 01:48:41,880
That's all I knew.
So you just be the arrow.

2354
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:43,650
It made no sense.
But I'd be out there.

2355
01:48:43,770 --> 01:48:48,390
I had a ball on a string in the backyard
and I would like a softball and swing

2356
01:48:48,391 --> 01:48:50,960
the soft ball back and forth and just
tell myself beat the Arrow,

2357
01:48:51,380 --> 01:48:56,070
shoot it made no sense.
And then when I got a compound bow I

2358
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,870
just be the arrow.
So I just move.

2359
01:48:57,871 --> 01:49:00,180
And when it felt right,
I let her let her rip.

2360
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:02,850
But you've obviously made adjustments
because you don't move.

2361
01:49:02,910 --> 01:49:04,710
Yeah,
I in the shot right now.

2362
01:49:04,711 --> 01:49:09,711
So in the process of switching the way
that I shoot at developed a few bad

2363
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:14,910
habits,
which now I think if I would have just

2364
01:49:14,911 --> 01:49:16,530
stuck with it,
it had been fine,

2365
01:49:17,040 --> 01:49:20,820
but now that I've tried to switch,
then I kind of try to all those bad

2366
01:49:20,821 --> 01:49:25,230
habits that I had originally tried to
creep back in and it doesn't really,

2367
01:49:25,470 --> 01:49:29,040
in the end I do really well so it
doesn't really matter,

2368
01:49:29,041 --> 01:49:33,960
but I like the idea of trying new things
and there's always room for improvement.

2369
01:49:34,140 --> 01:49:35,640
You should talk to Dudley.
Yeah,

2370
01:49:36,130 --> 01:49:38,010
we should go over some coaching with
them.

2371
01:49:38,730 --> 01:49:40,700
What's interesting to me is that,
uh,

2372
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:45,780
I've seen a bunch of guys who are like
very accomplished hunters,

2373
01:49:45,781 --> 01:49:48,100
very accomplished archers and

2374
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,100
they,
they get real weird around him really

2375
01:49:51,130 --> 01:49:55,660
because they know he's a master.
He's a master of form and technique and

2376
01:49:55,661 --> 01:49:59,710
he does it absolutely the right way and
people do not like to get in shootouts

2377
01:49:59,711 --> 01:50:02,380
with him.
Like when you have little competitions,

2378
01:50:02,530 --> 01:50:04,170
he's too fucking accurate.
He's,

2379
01:50:04,300 --> 01:50:06,010
he's ridiculous.
He shot,

2380
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:11,050
we did a video for on it where he shot a
Kettlebell handle at 120 yards.

2381
01:50:11,350 --> 01:50:13,500
He shot in the handling.
Yeah,

2382
01:50:13,540 --> 01:50:16,510
at night and the sparks because he did
it at night,

2383
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:19,180
like he said,
a lighted nock in there and aim for the

2384
01:50:19,181 --> 01:50:23,620
lighted nock and shot it through and you
can see the sparks as the broad head

2385
01:50:23,621 --> 01:50:27,060
hits the bottom of the,
a handle the,

2386
01:50:27,110 --> 01:50:28,720
the,
the top edge of the Kettlebell.

2387
01:50:29,020 --> 01:50:33,660
He's ridiculous shot.
But everything he does is text book and

2388
01:50:33,800 --> 01:50:35,740
he's like a technical.
He's.

2389
01:50:35,741 --> 01:50:36,420
Yeah,
he.

2390
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:37,900
And he does that when he's hunting too.
I mean,

2391
01:50:37,901 --> 01:50:40,160
but he does that with everything but so
it's real weird.

2392
01:50:40,161 --> 01:50:43,300
Like guys almost have this thing in
their head like I don't want to fuck

2393
01:50:43,301 --> 01:50:45,940
with it.
It's already are already very successful

2394
01:50:45,941 --> 01:50:47,410
doing this way.
I don't want to change anything.

2395
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:49,780
Like I'm not listening to you,
blah blah blah blah blah.

2396
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:53,770
Like some guys will try to revamp their
whole system but a lot of really

2397
01:50:53,771 --> 01:50:56,530
successful guys won't.
And they get real weird around him.

2398
01:50:56,531 --> 01:50:57,270
It's very interesting

2399
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:59,690
watch.
I can see that whole if it's not broken,

2400
01:50:59,691 --> 01:51:01,250
don't fix it,
but I'm not that type.

2401
01:51:01,251 --> 01:51:03,200
I don't really.
If somebody is really good at something,

2402
01:51:03,201 --> 01:51:04,940
I want to learn from them.
Like,

2403
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:06,860
you know,
if he came to me and was like,

2404
01:51:06,861 --> 01:51:10,160
Hey,
I want to know my thing isn't technical

2405
01:51:10,161 --> 01:51:13,910
archery.
My thing is being out outdoor skills,

2406
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:15,980
survival skills,
hunting,

2407
01:51:16,010 --> 01:51:17,350
being in the woods,
you know,

2408
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:18,111
if he's like,
hey man,

2409
01:51:18,111 --> 01:51:23,111
I want to know some more stuff about
stocking mountain goats in wherever

2410
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:25,251
you're like,
okay,

2411
01:51:25,251 --> 01:51:26,630
cool.
I can tell you what I know.

2412
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:30,140
And I asked him the same thing,
like tell me about some archery stuff

2413
01:51:30,141 --> 01:51:34,880
because there's always areas where I can
improve and I'm not so stuck in my ways

2414
01:51:34,881 --> 01:51:37,880
that I need to do it the way I've been
doing it.

2415
01:51:37,940 --> 01:51:40,670
I'm not.
There's definitely better ways to do

2416
01:51:40,671 --> 01:51:42,320
things,
but you can definitely get by the way,

2417
01:51:42,321 --> 01:51:43,870
you're doing it really well here.
Here's,

2418
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:47,030
here's John.
So he put a light on it.

2419
01:51:47,031 --> 01:51:48,170
That's what he did.
Yeah,

2420
01:51:52,050 --> 01:51:56,160
check it out.
But you want to talk about a guy who

2421
01:51:56,190 --> 01:51:57,610
loves archery?
Yeah.

2422
01:51:57,611 --> 01:52:00,160
He loves coaching.
He loves doing it,

2423
01:52:00,460 --> 01:52:05,460
like that's a perfect thing for him.
He loves it and he loves teaching people

2424
01:52:06,941 --> 01:52:08,650
how to do it too,
but if you watch his form,

2425
01:52:08,651 --> 01:52:09,484
it's just

2426
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:11,070
absolutely perfect.
Yeah.

2427
01:52:11,071 --> 01:52:12,420
That's cool.
Yeah.

2428
01:52:12,421 --> 01:52:14,430
And that's what I mean.
I love bow hunting.

2429
01:52:14,431 --> 01:52:17,640
That's my passion.
And I'll still go rifle hunting

2430
01:52:17,641 --> 01:52:20,580
depending on the hunt.
How often your rifle and every year.

2431
01:52:21,990 --> 01:52:23,820
That's a good question.
You know,

2432
01:52:23,821 --> 01:52:26,460
am I doing one or two on senior?
I always,

2433
01:52:26,461 --> 01:52:29,550
uh,
the one hunt generally because I guide

2434
01:52:29,551 --> 01:52:34,551
during the elk season in Montana.
So my thing is El Camino is my number

2435
01:52:34,861 --> 01:52:39,861
one thing that I want in the freezer,
so I generally save a few days at the

2436
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:42,090
end of the season to go out and try to
kill an elk with a rifle.

2437
01:52:42,330 --> 01:52:45,740
It's mostly just because I want that
meat in the freezer

2438
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,860
and I don't.
And there's nothing wrong with rifling

2439
01:52:49,030 --> 01:52:50,990
in there.
The thing about that I,

2440
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:53,720
if I take a rifle,
it's also that challenge thing.

2441
01:52:54,080 --> 01:52:58,940
So I might go into an area where the
odds of me getting something with a

2442
01:52:58,941 --> 01:53:03,941
rifle even would be 100 or say multiple
multiple times less than the odds of me

2443
01:53:06,291 --> 01:53:10,790
going into an area with a bone and
getting something right because it's low

2444
01:53:10,791 --> 01:53:12,770
density of animals so he didn't see any
animals or even.

2445
01:53:13,110 --> 01:53:17,590
Well with Elc I think it's actually
easier to get an elk and maybe people

2446
01:53:17,591 --> 01:53:18,141
will be like,
no,

2447
01:53:18,141 --> 01:53:20,330
that's bullshit,
but it's easier to get an elk with a bow

2448
01:53:20,660 --> 01:53:23,000
than a rifle.
Yeah.

2449
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:26,120
During Europe,
because most archery seasons or during

2450
01:53:26,121 --> 01:53:27,710
the Rut,
that's the easiest time to.

2451
01:53:28,130 --> 01:53:31,780
It would be like a no brainer with a
rifle and during the rut because the

2452
01:53:31,781 --> 01:53:34,430
animals were all distracted and when
they're trying to hump and it mostly

2453
01:53:34,431 --> 01:53:35,510
across the West.

2454
01:53:35,690 --> 01:53:38,600
The elk season with a rifle and general
elk season,

2455
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:40,880
is it the absolute worst time to finding
out?

2456
01:53:40,881 --> 01:53:44,850
Just seeing an elk is the struggle.
You might go five days and not seeing

2457
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:47,120
elk in some areas.
That's probably really cold.

2458
01:53:47,121 --> 01:53:51,640
Really cold hartree equipment might not
even work and some of those temperatures

2459
01:53:51,641 --> 01:53:56,360
sometimes you draw it back.
Well icicles on you're frozen and it

2460
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:59,510
gets wet and then it's frozen and then
try to shoot.

2461
01:53:59,720 --> 01:54:04,720
And how did you start going to Montana?
My grandpa actually lived there.

2462
01:54:04,821 --> 01:54:09,821
I just went there summers and I grew up
kind of in hunting that area and stuff.

2463
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:14,240
The bitterroot valley.
Southwest Montana.

2464
01:54:14,300 --> 01:54:16,100
What's that?
Near Missoula.

2465
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:16,990
Missoula.
Okay.

2466
01:54:16,990 --> 01:54:20,000
South of Missoula.
And I just grew up hunting there.

2467
01:54:20,190 --> 01:54:21,100
And you know,
with.

2468
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:23,600
No,
there's no grizzlies there.

2469
01:54:23,860 --> 01:54:25,850
Some areas of Montana have them.
Some don't.

2470
01:54:25,880 --> 01:54:26,713
Yeah,
correct.

2471
01:54:26,840 --> 01:54:29,060
What's that about?
Um,

2472
01:54:29,090 --> 01:54:33,440
well they have them in the park and then
the main population and then they did

2473
01:54:33,441 --> 01:54:37,100
the reintroductions and say,
so glacier has them,

2474
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:39,170
a yellowstone has them.

2475
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:41,630
They reintroduced grizzlies to certain
areas.

2476
01:54:41,690 --> 01:54:44,290
Yeah.
Real upside of glacier in some other

2477
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:47,240
areas you,
they do the problem grizzlies and trap

2478
01:54:47,241 --> 01:54:49,150
them or something or as far as I know,
yeah,

2479
01:54:49,190 --> 01:54:53,160
they did do some transplants or
reintroductions.

2480
01:54:53,590 --> 01:54:55,530
Um,
but those parks have had them.

2481
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:00,100
And then the ones in that greater
yellowstone area of spread out and in

2482
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:04,040
that glacier if spread out.
Montana is a very unusual place.

2483
01:55:04,041 --> 01:55:07,480
It's such a small population,
but the people are like,

2484
01:55:07,790 --> 01:55:12,790
I've only been to Bozeman and billings
when we went and hunted the Missouri

2485
01:55:13,041 --> 01:55:13,850
breaks.
But yeah,

2486
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:16,640
people are very nice.
It's really cool area.

2487
01:55:16,670 --> 01:55:18,080
Interesting.
It's like they're not,

2488
01:55:18,081 --> 01:55:19,310
they're not Hicks.
Yeah,

2489
01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:20,510
no,
they're tuned in.

2490
01:55:20,890 --> 01:55:23,000
Well Weird Montana is a small
population,

2491
01:55:23,001 --> 01:55:26,390
but that population explodes in the
summer with all the,

2492
01:55:26,570 --> 01:55:28,070
with the parks there.
Right.

2493
01:55:28,160 --> 01:55:32,330
So it's tourists type people coming in.
And that's why,

2494
01:55:32,860 --> 01:55:36,080
I mean it seems like.
I don't actually have the stats,

2495
01:55:36,081 --> 01:55:40,940
but it seems like the law almost every
year somebody dies from a grizzly now or

2496
01:55:40,941 --> 01:55:42,550
multiple people.
It's been.

2497
01:55:42,590 --> 01:55:44,010
A lot of people have been getting
attacked and

2498
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:49,010
I think it's just the amount of people
that are there and just think that

2499
01:55:49,021 --> 01:55:52,380
they're cuddly,
cute animals and they don't really have

2500
01:55:52,381 --> 01:55:55,050
precautions.
Because I think if you go on a hunt in

2501
01:55:55,051 --> 01:55:59,310
Alaska where we went in a fog neck,
you're probably a lot safer than the

2502
01:55:59,311 --> 01:56:02,940
tourists going into a yellowstone just
because you,

2503
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,440
you're,
you should be prepared.

2504
01:56:04,441 --> 01:56:07,370
You've got the idea that these bears are
dangerous and they're probably going to

2505
01:56:07,410 --> 01:56:11,730
come at you in some way.
You need to be ready at all times.

2506
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:14,460
Then you go into yellowstone or glacier
park.

2507
01:56:14,630 --> 01:56:17,220
There was a lot of attacks around
delisted bears there,

2508
01:56:17,221 --> 01:56:18,690
right?
Yeah.

2509
01:56:18,691 --> 01:56:19,710
They're,
they're delisted.

2510
01:56:19,711 --> 01:56:20,200
No,

2511
01:56:20,200 --> 01:56:22,390
but they don't have a,
a season open for hunting.

2512
01:56:22,391 --> 01:56:23,780
But that's under debate.
Correct.

2513
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:28,810
So the ideas there are populations of
reached a steady or maybe even over the

2514
01:56:29,860 --> 01:56:30,600
that level.

2515
01:56:30,600 --> 01:56:32,160
Yep.
Yeah.

2516
01:56:32,161 --> 01:56:35,790
They're no longer,
they're no longer threaten or

2517
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:37,720
potentially in danger.
There's no.

2518
01:56:38,430 --> 01:56:40,440
They aren't going to go extinct right
now.

2519
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:42,300
And did you ever see,
um,

2520
01:56:42,510 --> 01:56:47,040
a short face bear?
You ever see images of the bear that

2521
01:56:47,041 --> 01:56:51,780
used to live somewhere in the bearing
landmass between the US and Asia?

2522
01:56:51,830 --> 01:56:54,600
It's a way bigger than even a grizzly.
Very large.

2523
01:56:54,700 --> 01:56:56,940
Yeah.
They think that's what made of might

2524
01:56:56,941 --> 01:57:01,170
have kept people from migrating to North
America quicker.

2525
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:02,273
It's crazy.

2526
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:06,320
Well,
they say they say that a polar bear's

2527
01:57:06,321 --> 01:57:09,650
still actively hunt people,
which is a.

2528
01:57:10,370 --> 01:57:12,530
those bears.
They do have a different temperament

2529
01:57:12,770 --> 01:57:16,010
now.
I think that the bears in Montana,

2530
01:57:16,070 --> 01:57:18,680
we just keep going back to barriers,
but the barriers in Montana,

2531
01:57:19,250 --> 01:57:24,250
landlocked grizzly bears just seemed to
be slightly more aggressive than the

2532
01:57:25,731 --> 01:57:28,970
larger coastal brown bears just because
they don't have as much food.

2533
01:57:29,400 --> 01:57:32,870
There's always slightly pissed off.
They always see everything as a,

2534
01:57:32,910 --> 01:57:33,950
as a potential meal

2535
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,790
and everything is like.
They look at mammals moving around on

2536
01:57:36,791 --> 01:57:39,280
the ground as a meal as opposed to like
the bears and the coastal.

2537
01:57:39,281 --> 01:57:41,530
They'll connect salmon.
Salmon most of the year.

2538
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:43,540
Yeah.
They're not thinking of things walking

2539
01:57:43,541 --> 01:57:44,590
around as being food.

2540
01:57:44,710 --> 01:57:47,770
Yeah.
Well the salmon are a very large food

2541
01:57:47,771 --> 01:57:48,910
source,
but only in the fall.

2542
01:57:49,660 --> 01:57:52,660
So for a quarter of the year.
Did you ever see that

2543
01:57:52,830 --> 01:57:57,600
BC special or the guy they put him in a
giant plexiglass box.

2544
01:57:57,630 --> 01:58:01,080
Yeah.
And they dropped him off somewhere where

2545
01:58:01,081 --> 01:58:03,750
there's a large polar bear population.
Oh No,

2546
01:58:03,751 --> 01:58:07,050
I thought it was.
I saw one where they did with the brown

2547
01:58:07,051 --> 01:58:10,170
bear and the got to attack the thing.
No,

2548
01:58:10,180 --> 01:58:11,580
this is.
This was a polar bear.

2549
01:58:11,600 --> 01:58:12,080
Yeah,
the.

2550
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:14,940
They put the polar bear,
they put this box there and the guys

2551
01:58:14,941 --> 01:58:18,030
inside the box and the polar bear comes
up to the box.

2552
01:58:18,031 --> 01:58:18,751
This is it.
Oh,

2553
01:58:18,751 --> 01:58:23,751
so is this like super thick glass thing
with steel and bolts and rivets?

2554
01:58:25,321 --> 01:58:28,890
I mean it literally looks like some sort
of a like something you would drop out

2555
01:58:28,891 --> 01:58:33,891
of a fucking spaceship and this bear
comes up and sees him and start smelling

2556
01:58:36,211 --> 01:58:38,850
them to tries to bite through the thing.
Look at this.

2557
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:40,920
Wow,
fuck this bad.

2558
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:43,960
He's tightening everything down.
Freaking out.

2559
01:58:45,020 --> 01:58:48,010
It's licking everything and
systematically trying.

2560
01:58:49,300 --> 01:58:54,220
That's a big thing,
but there's times where it opens its

2561
01:58:54,221 --> 01:58:55,570
mouth.
Yeah.

2562
01:58:55,650 --> 01:58:59,920
And the guys inside of it and it's.
It can smell him through these little

2563
01:58:59,921 --> 01:59:02,190
holes,
see where it's going through that hole

2564
01:59:02,780 --> 01:59:04,570
and is trying to eat them.
Oh yeah.

2565
01:59:04,600 --> 01:59:07,090
That thing is trying to snack on the ice
right there.

2566
01:59:08,670 --> 01:59:10,450
Yeah.
I mean it's not curious is trying to

2567
01:59:10,451 --> 01:59:12,550
figure out a way to get them.
Fuck man,

2568
01:59:14,310 --> 01:59:15,230
that's pretty cool.
Well,

2569
01:59:15,240 --> 01:59:17,010
there are so ruthless that they're,
you know,

2570
01:59:17,370 --> 01:59:19,470
all of them are cannibals.
That's what's really crazy.

2571
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:22,680
I mean there's not a,
there's not a lot of food up there now.

2572
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:27,270
The sources that they do have,
the seals and things are just high fat

2573
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,650
content so they don't have to eat as
much in Wales.

2574
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:32,000
Like the.
Yeah,

2575
01:59:32,270 --> 01:59:36,290
picture crazy.
It's got its mouth open trying to bite

2576
01:59:36,291 --> 01:59:38,510
through the class and its head is so
fucking big.

2577
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:42,140
Yeah.
I mean there's a heartbreaking video.

2578
01:59:42,141 --> 01:59:45,660
I don't know if you saw it.
It was going around a couple of weeks

2579
01:59:45,660 --> 01:59:47,920
ago of a polar bear is starving to death
and you know,

2580
01:59:47,930 --> 01:59:49,370
they're attributing it to climate
change.

2581
01:59:49,400 --> 01:59:54,400
I did see that little nat geo thing.
It's weird that you do not want that to

2582
01:59:54,591 --> 01:59:55,221
happen,
right?

2583
01:59:55,221 --> 01:59:57,890
I mean the last thing you want to see as
a polar bear starving to death,

2584
01:59:58,850 --> 02:00:01,670
but I also don't want to get eaten by
that fucking thing.

2585
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:04,730
We'll just go.
It's just.

2586
02:00:05,930 --> 02:00:07,520
I mean that's the balance,
right?

2587
02:00:07,630 --> 02:00:11,150
We want them to thrive and survive.
We just don't want him anywhere near me.

2588
02:00:11,380 --> 02:00:12,830
Yeah.
I think,

2589
02:00:13,060 --> 02:00:13,520
I mean,
I,

2590
02:00:13,520 --> 02:00:15,710
I've never been anywhere that there are
a polar bears.

2591
02:00:15,800 --> 02:00:17,560
So would you be interested in going?
Yeah,

2592
02:00:17,700 --> 02:00:19,850
I'd go check it out.
I think it'd be cool to see.

2593
02:00:20,150 --> 02:00:21,650
Do they have a,
what are those big,

2594
02:00:21,651 --> 02:00:23,720
furry things?
Muskox.

2595
02:00:23,721 --> 02:00:25,520
Are they anywhere near a polar bears?
Yeah,

2596
02:00:25,521 --> 02:00:26,140
they are.

2597
02:00:26,140 --> 02:00:28,780
Yeah.
They've got them in the Arctic.

2598
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:31,190
The polar bears hunt.
Those muskox says,

2599
02:00:32,340 --> 02:00:33,173
Nah,
I don't.

2600
02:00:33,250 --> 02:00:37,000
Not that I know of.
And they're mostly go for seals and

2601
02:00:37,001 --> 02:00:37,834
other things.

2602
02:00:38,920 --> 02:00:40,030
Well,
what's next for you?

2603
02:00:40,031 --> 02:00:41,540
Man?
You going to do any more TV shows?

2604
02:00:41,550 --> 02:00:43,330
Because I really enjoyed that.
Apex predators.

2605
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:45,880
Well,
I'm still doing the solo hunter stuff

2606
02:00:45,970 --> 02:00:47,590
and uh,
we did.

2607
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:52,640
I did some cool stuff in Australia this
year and did a buff Huntington,

2608
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:55,720
like a solo little mission there.
I was with some people,

2609
02:00:55,721 --> 02:00:58,090
but then I did all the hunting alone
just to get out there.

2610
02:00:58,091 --> 02:01:03,010
It's pretty far out.
I'm still doing the solo stuff and then

2611
02:01:03,330 --> 02:01:04,840
yeah,
I've got some stuff in the works,

2612
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:08,030
uh,
for the coming future that be,

2613
02:01:08,430 --> 02:01:11,710
it's exciting.
I just can't really divulge a lot of it

2614
02:01:11,711 --> 02:01:13,450
yet,
but I hope you do something that

2615
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:18,990
allows people that are more mainstream
that aren't on outdoor TV to get a look

2616
02:01:19,961 --> 02:01:23,830
at your approach and your philosophy and
the way you look at things because I

2617
02:01:23,831 --> 02:01:28,831
think that guys like you and Rinella and
campaigns and Dudley very valuable

2618
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:33,400
because people have this sense that you
said,

2619
02:01:33,401 --> 02:01:34,240
well,
you're talking about like the

2620
02:01:34,241 --> 02:01:38,880
stereotypical idea of what a hunter is.
They have this idea of what it is and

2621
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:40,340
they see a guy like you and they go,
oh,

2622
02:01:40,341 --> 02:01:42,140
well this guy is like more like an
athlete.

2623
02:01:42,170 --> 02:01:46,790
Like this is more like a pursuit.
This is more like an endurance skill

2624
02:01:46,791 --> 02:01:50,000
thing on top of being a hunting thing.
Like there's a lot of,

2625
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:54,320
a lot of variables here that most people
don't take into consideration.

2626
02:01:54,321 --> 02:01:57,500
It's why I think it's so important to.
That's why I really enjoyed having you

2627
02:01:57,501 --> 02:02:01,490
on a podcast and having guys like you on
to talk about this stuff so people get

2628
02:02:01,491 --> 02:02:03,320
an understanding of it in a different
way.

2629
02:02:03,560 --> 02:02:03,981
Yeah.
Thanks.

2630
02:02:03,981 --> 02:02:05,180
I appreciate that.
Yeah,

2631
02:02:05,181 --> 02:02:09,230
it's nice to be able to kind of share
what I do with a population that might

2632
02:02:09,231 --> 02:02:12,860
not really understand it because I think
if you really look at it hunting in

2633
02:02:12,861 --> 02:02:17,600
general and the way that myself,
and I'm not the exception,

2634
02:02:17,601 --> 02:02:20,000
there's a lot of people that hunt the
way that I do,

2635
02:02:20,300 --> 02:02:23,420
especially out west.
I think that if you really understand

2636
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:26,200
that way,
then you kind of start to get a grasp of

2637
02:02:26,210 --> 02:02:29,360
it's not bad.
It's actually a better system and some

2638
02:02:29,361 --> 02:02:32,210
of the systems that we have around now
and I think some of the stuff that I'm

2639
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:33,590
going to be doing in the future will
really,

2640
02:02:33,930 --> 02:02:35,990
uh,
just give people more access to that.

2641
02:02:36,380 --> 02:02:38,780
And you know,
right now you can go get their solo

2642
02:02:38,781 --> 02:02:39,800
hunter episodes.
We have a,

2643
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:42,110
we,
we decided to put them all on our

2644
02:02:42,111 --> 02:02:45,230
website and do like a solo hunter all
access kind of thing.

2645
02:02:45,670 --> 02:02:48,830
Just like a subscription and you can go
on there and just watch anything that

2646
02:02:48,831 --> 02:02:49,820
we've done.
There's.

2647
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:52,070
I don't even know how long.
That's awesome.

2648
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:56,190
I think that a lot of times what's
happening with the

2649
02:02:58,190 --> 02:02:59,960
stories that are being told about
hunting,

2650
02:02:59,961 --> 02:03:01,850
it's.
It's all everyone's preaching to the

2651
02:03:01,851 --> 02:03:02,930
converted.
Yeah,

2652
02:03:03,260 --> 02:03:08,260
and occasionally something comes along
like this podcast where people maybe

2653
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:12,380
would have a prejudiced idea what it is.
Then they get introduced to a guy like

2654
02:03:12,381 --> 02:03:13,700
you or Rainelle and go,
oh,

2655
02:03:13,701 --> 02:03:16,290
these aren't meatheads.
These aren't dumb people.

2656
02:03:16,291 --> 02:03:18,980
Like this is a different thing,
and then they realize that this is

2657
02:03:18,981 --> 02:03:23,981
actually a very difficult,
honorable pursuit and very respectful

2658
02:03:24,291 --> 02:03:28,040
pursuit and really hard to do.
When you were talking about like what

2659
02:03:28,041 --> 02:03:30,590
the kind of physical fitness levels that
are required of you,

2660
02:03:30,591 --> 02:03:35,300
the the knowledge and understanding.
This is not some easy thing where you go

2661
02:03:35,301 --> 02:03:39,890
into the mountains and just go find an
animal that's trying to survive and kill

2662
02:03:39,891 --> 02:03:41,360
it.
It especially with a bow and Arrow,

2663
02:03:41,361 --> 02:03:42,194
it's not easy.

2664
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:43,900
Not Easy.
I think if anyone.

2665
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:46,490
I used to hear those comments that
people that don't hunt,

2666
02:03:46,540 --> 02:03:49,930
oh you big hunter,
go out there and kill an animal with a

2667
02:03:49,931 --> 02:03:51,520
gun or boat,
whatever.

2668
02:03:52,180 --> 02:03:54,190
Go give it a try,
give it a try,

2669
02:03:54,310 --> 02:03:56,800
see if you can do it because it's not as
easy as you might think.

2670
02:03:57,190 --> 02:03:59,440
It's unbelievably difficult is.
It's very difficult.

2671
02:03:59,610 --> 02:04:01,590
I mean they smell you hundreds of yards
away and I'm like,

2672
02:04:01,591 --> 02:04:02,570
fuck,
this guy gone,

2673
02:04:02,620 --> 02:04:04,680
gone and you're never going to come
close to him.

2674
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:07,110
Yeah,
and a lot of people's interactions with

2675
02:04:07,111 --> 02:04:10,140
wildlife or an urban zones are in
national parks.

2676
02:04:10,141 --> 02:04:12,840
It's like it's like Disneyland.
It's like going to the zoo.

2677
02:04:12,841 --> 02:04:17,841
It's not like where I go into remote
wilderness areas where the animals are

2678
02:04:18,091 --> 02:04:21,870
completely wild and you have no support
system,

2679
02:04:21,871 --> 02:04:26,850
new net of safety and you just have to
rely on your skills and your ability and

2680
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:30,660
you're just another like you're just
another Predator out there on the

2681
02:04:30,661 --> 02:04:34,110
mountain and there are things in some of
those places that want each you and you

2682
02:04:34,111 --> 02:04:36,300
just.
You have to adapt and deal with it and

2683
02:04:36,301 --> 02:04:38,820
be prepared and,
and go off the skills.

2684
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:41,280
Are those solo backpacking trips your
favorite ones?

2685
02:04:41,330 --> 02:04:42,240
Oh,
by far,

2686
02:04:42,270 --> 02:04:43,230
yeah.
I love that.

2687
02:04:43,620 --> 02:04:46,170
I love it.
And in those mouse there's some,

2688
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:48,780
there's some hints that I used to do a
lot of that.

2689
02:04:48,780 --> 02:04:53,240
I try to like,
they're actually looking back on man as

2690
02:04:53,250 --> 02:04:55,650
way dangerous.
I probably shouldn't do that alone.

2691
02:04:55,710 --> 02:04:58,830
And then I still go do it,
but there's going to be some point I'll

2692
02:04:58,831 --> 02:05:00,680
probably.
Well we're,

2693
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:02,960
we're rinella night hunted and got
attacked by the.

2694
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:04,290
I've been in.
They're very,

2695
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:05,580
quite a few times,
probably

2696
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:10,140
three or four times alone.
Solo Watts?

2697
02:05:10,230 --> 02:05:12,480
Yeah.
Hunting deer and other things in there.

2698
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:13,580
Yeah.
And,

2699
02:05:14,180 --> 02:05:17,420
and I think about it and go God that
stupid,

2700
02:05:17,740 --> 02:05:18,560
terrible,
stupid,

2701
02:05:18,560 --> 02:05:19,380
terribly steep.
And,

2702
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,840
and to be honest,
there's times that I've been in there by

2703
02:05:21,841 --> 02:05:26,520
myself and taking precaution and I
remember one specific time I was

2704
02:05:26,521 --> 02:05:30,210
stocking a black tail and I,
I had my pistol in my backpack,

2705
02:05:30,270 --> 02:05:32,160
which now obviously I would never do
again,

2706
02:05:32,161 --> 02:05:35,250
but I had my bear spray on my hip and my
pistol.

2707
02:05:35,251 --> 02:05:37,590
I pull it out,
have no bullets in the thing,

2708
02:05:38,010 --> 02:05:42,540
and I'm on a fog neck island thinking I
would be dead.

2709
02:05:42,540 --> 02:05:46,350
I would have been dead if that would've
happened and I wasn't by myself and I've

2710
02:05:46,351 --> 02:05:48,250
been in that.
The shitty thing is I've been.

2711
02:05:48,360 --> 02:05:52,050
The thing that really kind of pissed me
off later was thinking the amount of

2712
02:05:52,051 --> 02:05:56,520
times I've been in those situations
alone an and just thinking,

2713
02:05:56,521 --> 02:05:57,900
man,
I got to lax on that.

2714
02:05:58,950 --> 02:06:01,650
Why did you not bullets in the gun?
Is that just one of those things?

2715
02:06:01,690 --> 02:06:06,390
You just been there too many times and
think so and I did.

2716
02:06:06,490 --> 02:06:08,400
I did have bear spray.
I think,

2717
02:06:08,430 --> 02:06:10,410
Oh,
the bear spray is good enough,

2718
02:06:10,740 --> 02:06:13,500
but now knowing the way that that bear
charged in bear spray would have been

2719
02:06:13,501 --> 02:06:15,720
completely useless.
They'll just run right through it.

2720
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:17,220
Well,
the wind was blowing so,

2721
02:06:17,221 --> 02:06:20,010
so fast in our faces.
We would have blinded ourselves.

2722
02:06:20,850 --> 02:06:23,190
Now whether you're coated with bear
spray in it,

2723
02:06:23,260 --> 02:06:24,930
words the bear off,
I don't know,

2724
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:25,963
but I wouldn't.

2725
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:30,270
You want to whip out.
You want to whip out bear spray and 70

2726
02:06:30,271 --> 02:06:32,220
mile an hour winds that blown in your
face.

2727
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:34,500
Maybe that time you'd probably 40,
50 miles an hour,

2728
02:06:34,501 --> 02:06:37,350
but that bear spray is not gonna work in
that.

2729
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:39,150
No,
that's ridiculous.

2730
02:06:39,900 --> 02:06:43,440
Bear sprays.
I mean I bet it works some of the time.

2731
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:46,110
Yeah.
I think in in some instances is probably

2732
02:06:46,111 --> 02:06:49,110
a lot more effective friend Johnny
Rivets that he sprayed it right and the

2733
02:06:49,111 --> 02:06:51,270
grizzlies face and the grooves of walk
right through it.

2734
02:06:51,290 --> 02:06:55,440
It just closes his eyes and then shook
his head and then walk right through it.

2735
02:06:55,620 --> 02:06:58,810
Yeah.
I think that there's now I think I just

2736
02:06:58,820 --> 02:07:02,340
carried both because there's certain
instances where that is probably better

2737
02:07:02,341 --> 02:07:03,174
than option.
Yeah.

2738
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:06,810
Because I'm shooting something that's
charging you with a pistol is very

2739
02:07:06,811 --> 02:07:11,280
difficult in that situation.
I think that was a 44 magnum.

2740
02:07:11,550 --> 02:07:13,110
I think in,
in that situation,

2741
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:15,700
you're really relying on it when the
bears on top of you.

2742
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:19,080
It's just a last ditch effort.

2743
02:07:21,450 --> 02:07:24,600
Any of those and even those,
any kind of deterrent you have.

2744
02:07:25,350 --> 02:07:27,330
I think it's just hard to,
uh,

2745
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:31,920
hard to really,
like when it comes down it's either

2746
02:07:31,921 --> 02:07:34,560
going to go down and you're going to get
away and they are,

2747
02:07:34,561 --> 02:07:35,600
you not,
don't.

2748
02:07:35,790 --> 02:07:40,790
Do you think anything you can,
but horrific experience made that place

2749
02:07:41,021 --> 02:07:43,300
more attractive to you in about a year?
Yeah,

2750
02:07:43,301 --> 02:07:47,800
I think so.
I don't answer before I asked it.

2751
02:07:48,460 --> 02:07:51,070
I was hoping you'd be surprised.
The weather sucks.

2752
02:07:51,071 --> 02:07:55,580
It's hard walking around now.
I know that the bear attacks are leads

2753
02:07:55,581 --> 02:07:56,440
yet.
Okay.

2754
02:07:56,441 --> 02:07:57,900
Let's go back.
I'll go.

2755
02:07:58,150 --> 02:08:00,370
I'll go back there next year.
And hunt deer for sure.

2756
02:08:00,460 --> 02:08:02,440
Yeah.
And I echoed in for tags in different

2757
02:08:02,441 --> 02:08:04,810
area in there,
so I'll go back.

2758
02:08:05,030 --> 02:08:07,390
I wasn't,
it wasn't one of those type of

2759
02:08:07,391 --> 02:08:10,780
experiences where you go.
I think even if I had got tore up a

2760
02:08:10,781 --> 02:08:12,850
little bit,
I would still go back as.

2761
02:08:13,310 --> 02:08:15,970
Yeah,
it's not tore up a little bit defined

2762
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:17,990
like lived through it.
Oh yeah.

2763
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:21,880
What if you like lost half your nose?
I'd probably go.

2764
02:08:21,910 --> 02:08:26,910
I'd probably start bear hunting
grizzly.

2765
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,201
Um,
yeah,

2766
02:08:29,201 --> 02:08:30,940
I have.
Once it was,

2767
02:08:31,420 --> 02:08:33,160
it was one of those things I thought,
well,

2768
02:08:33,170 --> 02:08:34,420
I'll,
I'll do it.

2769
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:38,110
I had an opportunity and I wasn't.
I'm not,

2770
02:08:38,170 --> 02:08:41,890
I'm not really just,
I'm not big into bear hunting.

2771
02:08:42,430 --> 02:08:44,470
The meat to me is,
is good.

2772
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:46,270
It's okay,
but I just,

2773
02:08:46,330 --> 02:08:47,350
it's not like,
it's not,

2774
02:08:47,410 --> 02:08:48,340
no,
it's not my thing.

2775
02:08:48,610 --> 02:08:50,350
And you can't eat it medium rare.
No,

2776
02:08:50,351 --> 02:08:52,270
exactly.
That's part of it where you want to eat

2777
02:08:52,271 --> 02:08:53,770
in.
And uh,

2778
02:08:54,040 --> 02:08:59,040
and the other thing is there is a,
like some of it might just be like you

2779
02:08:59,861 --> 02:09:02,110
have emotional connections to certain
things.

2780
02:09:02,470 --> 02:09:04,660
Like I would,
I don't have any desire to go hunt and

2781
02:09:04,661 --> 02:09:05,620
African lion.

2782
02:09:05,650 --> 02:09:10,030
It's just not like you just whatever,
you know.

2783
02:09:10,350 --> 02:09:13,590
Not that I don't know.
I mean now if it's a thing where it's

2784
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:16,960
like you just to save the species,
you have to go hunting and African lion,

2785
02:09:16,961 --> 02:09:19,480
then I'd probably do it,
but it's not something that appeals to

2786
02:09:19,481 --> 02:09:20,230
me.
Yeah.

2787
02:09:20,230 --> 02:09:22,870
But that's like to say to save mankind,
you know,

2788
02:09:22,871 --> 02:09:23,710
you,
you have to go,

2789
02:09:23,711 --> 02:09:28,540
fuck Jennifer.
Jennifer flashdance with the lady.

2790
02:09:29,030 --> 02:09:30,700
Where was she in my head,
Jennifer

2791
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:34,270
is that flash dance.
But um,

2792
02:09:34,330 --> 02:09:36,250
I did.
I didn't hunt bears.

2793
02:09:36,270 --> 02:09:38,200
What's wrong with my memory?
That's weird.

2794
02:09:38,201 --> 02:09:39,910
I couldn't come up with a current hot
chick

2795
02:09:41,910 --> 02:09:42,743
out.
Weird.

2796
02:09:43,390 --> 02:09:44,860
You did?
I did.

2797
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:45,723
Yeah.
And I,

2798
02:09:45,790 --> 02:09:49,090
it was like a weird.
So the area that I went into,

2799
02:09:49,510 --> 02:09:51,360
it was a,
um,

2800
02:09:51,570 --> 02:09:55,960
a Predator control area and it's an area
that the state of Alaska,

2801
02:09:56,230 --> 02:09:58,840
so the state of Alaska works different
than other places,

2802
02:09:58,990 --> 02:10:01,690
so I actually went and met with a
biologist and kind of like,

2803
02:10:02,030 --> 02:10:03,700
it was like,
what's the deal with this?

2804
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:08,710
And so the deal was that there's change.
The state of Alaska has to manage their

2805
02:10:08,711 --> 02:10:12,040
wildlife populations for subsistence
subsistence

2806
02:10:13,630 --> 02:10:16,360
food sources.
It's mandated by the state.

2807
02:10:16,780 --> 02:10:21,780
So in that particular area that the
Predator population is got so high that

2808
02:10:22,660 --> 02:10:27,660
the moose populations and populations
were in severe decline and in danger of

2809
02:10:30,100 --> 02:10:35,090
not being able to provide food,
inadequate food source for the people

2810
02:10:35,091 --> 02:10:37,040
that lived.
And when I'm talking to people that

2811
02:10:37,041 --> 02:10:39,230
live,
people live in these remote areas.

2812
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:41,420
Yes they do.
And seeing the shows,

2813
02:10:41,421 --> 02:10:44,050
yeah,
it's a lot more real than the shows,

2814
02:10:44,060 --> 02:10:45,860
but they,
they live in these areas where there is

2815
02:10:45,861 --> 02:10:48,890
no access to other food sources.
One of the guys that I met,

2816
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:52,580
the only thing he eats for an entire
year is bear meat.

2817
02:10:53,330 --> 02:10:56,450
He has no other.
I mean I don't know if he gets some kind

2818
02:10:56,451 --> 02:10:59,780
of grow,
some kind of garden forages as well,

2819
02:10:59,960 --> 02:11:02,690
but his main food source through the
winter is bear meat.

2820
02:11:03,050 --> 02:11:05,990
Which gun?
Black lives right there in that area or

2821
02:11:05,991 --> 02:11:06,920
Brown.
It didn't matter.

2822
02:11:06,950 --> 02:11:08,620
Whatever you could get.
So there,

2823
02:11:08,621 --> 02:11:12,470
there's people that live in certain
places that the only way that they live

2824
02:11:12,471 --> 02:11:14,870
is from the animals that live there.
And that's the only way they could

2825
02:11:14,871 --> 02:11:16,820
survive.
I like to get the scientists to study

2826
02:11:16,821 --> 02:11:17,654
that guy.
Yeah,

2827
02:11:17,720 --> 02:11:19,310
that'd be interesting.
He's an interesting guy.

2828
02:11:19,640 --> 02:11:22,100
I mean the guy who just eats bear,
what does he like?

2829
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:26,360
If he's like ridiculously strong,
will they get them to the left?

2830
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:30,220
No,
he seemed like his normal as somebody

2831
02:11:30,221 --> 02:11:32,380
that lives off grade is.
That makes sense.

2832
02:11:32,830 --> 02:11:33,940
Very odd.
Yeah.

2833
02:11:34,150 --> 02:11:36,370
So they,
um,

2834
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:38,320
but anyways,
this particular area,

2835
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:43,650
the bear population was so high that it
was severely hurting the undulate

2836
02:11:46,181 --> 02:11:47,800
population to the point where there
might,

2837
02:11:48,130 --> 02:11:52,030
it'd be very hard to repair.
So then they open up these special

2838
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:56,590
seasons,
like for people to go in to hunt bears

2839
02:11:56,650 --> 02:12:01,180
in this particular area with a certain
objective and since they opened it,

2840
02:12:01,181 --> 02:12:04,150
now that area has been starting to
recuperate and then they stop the

2841
02:12:04,151 --> 02:12:05,770
Predator management thing.
They,

2842
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,750
they still,
you can hunt certain,

2843
02:12:07,780 --> 02:12:09,390
but they have.
So they've got a,

2844
02:12:09,480 --> 02:12:11,710
uh,
an interesting balance and they put a

2845
02:12:11,711 --> 02:12:15,160
lot of time in research and into this
whole deal.

2846
02:12:15,190 --> 02:12:16,023
The soul.

2847
02:12:16,100 --> 02:12:18,740
There's something very bizarre about
those television shows because they're,

2848
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:22,010
they're captivating those people that
live off the grid.

2849
02:12:22,430 --> 02:12:26,300
But there's something really ironic
about a person who doesn't even have a

2850
02:12:26,301 --> 02:12:29,240
television in their house,
but they're on television.

2851
02:12:29,990 --> 02:12:31,580
That is weird.
Weird.

2852
02:12:31,640 --> 02:12:34,880
Yeah.
This guy is living as close to the land

2853
02:12:34,881 --> 02:12:37,610
as possible,
but yet there's some millennial behind a

2854
02:12:37,611 --> 02:12:38,830
camera.
Tell him,

2855
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,521
tell him,
hey man,

2856
02:12:40,521 --> 02:12:42,560
can you,
can you pretend that you just found that

2857
02:12:42,561 --> 02:12:43,850
again?
Just put it down.

2858
02:12:43,880 --> 02:12:44,900
Pick it up again,
like,

2859
02:12:44,901 --> 02:12:46,640
Whoa,
I can't believe this is here.

2860
02:12:46,700 --> 02:12:47,720
Just give me one of those.

2861
02:12:47,740 --> 02:12:48,940
Yeah.
Yeah.

2862
02:12:48,941 --> 02:12:50,630
I think some of those people,
I,

2863
02:12:50,670 --> 02:12:55,090
I've met quite a few people that live,
like in that aren't on television that

2864
02:12:55,091 --> 02:12:59,080
live in the,
in they're fairly strangely normal

2865
02:12:59,081 --> 02:13:01,180
people.
It's kind of,

2866
02:13:01,420 --> 02:13:04,250
you would think that they,
some of them have the,

2867
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:07,480
might live in a shack,
but they've got some kind of Internet

2868
02:13:07,481 --> 02:13:10,300
service off their generator that they
run every once in a while.

2869
02:13:10,310 --> 02:13:11,143
It's weird.

2870
02:13:11,450 --> 02:13:14,510
I see that vice piece on that guy that
lives in,

2871
02:13:14,590 --> 02:13:17,030
um,
eastern Alaska.

2872
02:13:17,230 --> 02:13:18,380
Uh,
hi Mo.

2873
02:13:18,410 --> 02:13:19,250
Why mo?
Right.

2874
02:13:19,700 --> 02:13:22,190
Heimos arctic adventure.
No,

2875
02:13:22,370 --> 02:13:26,390
it's amazing.
He's been there since the seventies and

2876
02:13:26,900 --> 02:13:31,900
he came out there I think as a guide or
a forestry or something like that and

2877
02:13:32,851 --> 02:13:36,420
built a cabin and he's the last guy out
there that has the,

2878
02:13:36,510 --> 02:13:39,990
uh,
has rights to a cabin and that they

2879
02:13:39,991 --> 02:13:42,990
alloW that has permits to keep this
cabinet out there.

2880
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:45,150
Heimos arctic refuge.
That's what it is.

2881
02:13:45,151 --> 02:13:46,140
Hi,
mo course.

2882
02:13:46,380 --> 02:13:49,920
It's amazing man.
He's a hunter and he lives off of

2883
02:13:50,220 --> 02:13:53,210
caribou and he takes these caribou and
he,

2884
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:55,230
they're all frozen because it's all
cold.

2885
02:13:55,231 --> 02:14:00,231
They're hanging froM hanging from trees.
He saws it and throws it on the grill,

2886
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:04,110
you know,
like saws a frozen steak and throws it

2887
02:14:04,111 --> 02:14:06,750
on the grill.
But he's remarkably intelligent and

2888
02:14:06,751 --> 02:14:07,410
articulate.

2889
02:14:07,410 --> 02:14:08,940
He's not,
he's not crazy.

2890
02:14:09,390 --> 02:14:11,740
He lives up there with his wife and you
know,

2891
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:15,570
she's a
nun I guess.

2892
02:14:15,750 --> 02:14:17,550
And um,
so what you would say?

2893
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:18,470
Yeah.
Yeah.

2894
02:14:19,040 --> 02:14:22,020
WheRe is it okay to say eskimo?
Because some of them prefer eskimo.

2895
02:14:22,350 --> 02:14:26,850
I'm not sure where the line is there.
Some people think that eskimo is a slur,

2896
02:14:26,851 --> 02:14:29,280
like you're not supposed to say,
but other ones say no,

2897
02:14:29,281 --> 02:14:32,070
you should say eskimo.
So it's like rinella was trying to

2898
02:14:32,071 --> 02:14:35,770
explain it to me and it went in one ear
and out the other probably just where

2899
02:14:35,771 --> 02:14:38,010
they live.
YeaH.

2900
02:14:38,010 --> 02:14:41,100
But this guy lives in this shack that's
smaller than this room,

2901
02:14:41,580 --> 02:14:44,040
smAller than the studio and it's just
log thing.

2902
02:14:44,430 --> 02:14:46,140
And uh,
during the show,

2903
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:49,890
a bear tried to eat his dog.
So he ran out in the middle of the

2904
02:14:49,890 --> 02:14:50,611
night,
it's dark out,

2905
02:14:50,611 --> 02:14:52,860
he's blowing his shotgun off,
boom,

2906
02:14:52,861 --> 02:14:53,611
boom,
boom.

2907
02:14:53,611 --> 02:14:55,680
chasing this bear through the forest and
shooting it.

2908
02:14:55,720 --> 02:14:58,530
Wow.
And then had to skin it and send the

2909
02:14:58,531 --> 02:15:00,950
skull in and you know,
had to uh,

2910
02:15:01,080 --> 02:15:03,000
tell the wildlife people.
Okay.

2911
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:06,000
It's been tried to,
tried to kill my dog so I had to shoot

2912
02:15:06,001 --> 02:15:06,751
it.
Yeah.

2913
02:15:06,751 --> 02:15:10,410
Defensive life.
Shoot when we're defensive life or

2914
02:15:10,411 --> 02:15:11,850
property technically.
Yeah.

2915
02:15:12,270 --> 02:15:14,790
But this guy again,
like you're saying,

2916
02:15:14,820 --> 02:15:15,870
remarkably normal.

2917
02:15:15,930 --> 02:15:17,010
Yeah.
It's kind of strange,

2918
02:15:17,310 --> 02:15:17,970
but yeah,
in that,

2919
02:15:17,970 --> 02:15:22,250
in that area I did,
I went on that hunt and then um,

2920
02:15:23,400 --> 02:15:26,100
the,
I eight because people have always said,

2921
02:15:26,130 --> 02:15:29,220
oh bear whatever.
I ate it.

2922
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:31,030
And it was fine.
It was better than blackberry meet.

2923
02:15:31,080 --> 02:15:32,070
I thought,
what was it really?

2924
02:15:32,090 --> 02:15:34,260
Yeah.
So the whole like,

2925
02:15:34,261 --> 02:15:36,380
you caN't eat him as a weird deal
because my own,

2926
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:39,270
my one thing was if I do this,
I'm going to eat it.

2927
02:15:40,020 --> 02:15:40,853
And I,
you know,

2928
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:42,150
I didn't see anything

2929
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:43,890
wrong with them.
So it wasn't coastal.

2930
02:15:44,190 --> 02:15:45,480
It was,
it was coastal.

2931
02:15:45,510 --> 02:15:49,830
So it was eating fish is eating seals.
Navy seals tastes better.

2932
02:15:49,940 --> 02:15:50,750
I don't know.
Oh,

2933
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:52,010
it was.
It was summertime too.

2934
02:15:52,020 --> 02:15:54,770
So it would've been,
it would've been eating fish and seals

2935
02:15:54,771 --> 02:15:57,380
and whatever can find dead dead seals
mostly

2936
02:15:57,550 --> 02:16:00,110
because I remember rinella telling me
that he shot a black bear one,

2937
02:16:00,111 --> 02:16:03,750
so it'd be nothing but fish and that
they smoked it and that terrible

2938
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:06,010
borrowed a friend's smoker.
He didn't say it was terrible,

2939
02:16:06,011 --> 02:16:08,020
but he said he borrowed a friend smoker
and he said,

2940
02:16:08,021 --> 02:16:09,910
hey man,
you got to clean that smoker out.

2941
02:16:10,210 --> 02:16:10,781
And he goes,
why?

2942
02:16:10,781 --> 02:16:11,171
He goes,
oh,

2943
02:16:11,171 --> 02:16:12,670
it smells like fish.
And he goes,

2944
02:16:12,671 --> 02:16:14,560
I've never smoked fish in that thing
ever.

2945
02:16:15,220 --> 02:16:16,120
And he was like,
what?

2946
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:17,620
Really?
And they realize like,

2947
02:16:17,650 --> 02:16:19,570
oh no,
it's coming off of the actual meat,

2948
02:16:19,900 --> 02:16:24,460
like the bear ate so much fish that it
tasted like fish in the fat.

2949
02:16:25,120 --> 02:16:26,370
And tHen when they,
um,

2950
02:16:26,550 --> 02:16:29,980
they,
they smoke this bear ham and

2951
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,680
then slice it thin.
It literally tastes like salmon

2952
02:16:32,681 --> 02:16:35,170
carpaccio it's not.
Yeah.

2953
02:16:35,171 --> 02:16:36,580
See,
that doesn't appeal to me.

2954
02:16:37,900 --> 02:16:41,230
I think if you get your head past it
like salmon.

2955
02:16:41,500 --> 02:16:43,390
So why wouldn't I like that?
Yeah.

2956
02:16:43,410 --> 02:16:45,160
That's a weird.
Like a weird bear.

2957
02:16:45,161 --> 02:16:46,570
Salmon combination.
Yeah.

2958
02:16:46,800 --> 02:16:50,440
Was somebody asked me the other day,
well me and ronelle on mediators eight

2959
02:16:50,441 --> 02:16:52,750
that coyote in Mexico.
That was weird.

2960
02:16:52,940 --> 02:16:57,340
Yeah.
And it wasn't at the time it just tasted

2961
02:16:57,341 --> 02:16:58,930
like meat.
It was weird meat.

2962
02:16:58,990 --> 02:17:02,440
It tastes like goose or something.
Thinking back on it,

2963
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:05,680
it's like I have no desire to go out and
eat coyote again.

2964
02:17:05,920 --> 02:17:06,753
No,
no,

2965
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:09,820
no.
That's just the things that are close to

2966
02:17:09,821 --> 02:17:10,770
a dog.
Yeah,

2967
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:13,540
that's too weird.
I kind of like coyotes.

2968
02:17:13,600 --> 02:17:14,920
I liked it.
I liked to seen them around.

2969
02:17:14,980 --> 02:17:19,350
I mean I feel like our weird neighbors.
So this is this year I got man.

2970
02:17:19,350 --> 02:17:21,070
I got charged by a lot of stuff this
year.

2971
02:17:21,320 --> 02:17:23,130
The,
I was a hunting.

2972
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,000
Where you.
I sent you in rinella.

2973
02:17:25,360 --> 02:17:27,730
I went back there.
You got charged with something up there?

2974
02:17:27,790 --> 02:17:29,240
Yeah.
So this is just,

2975
02:17:29,570 --> 02:17:32,290
this is weird.
So I'm sitting there in this.

2976
02:17:32,320 --> 02:17:35,130
Just see like that white sandy area up
in there.

2977
02:17:35,140 --> 02:17:37,150
It was like this weird white dirt up
there.

2978
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:41,170
So I'm sitting in this weird white dirt
in the middle of the day,

2979
02:17:41,350 --> 02:17:45,400
100 degrees out,
so I'm trying to get in the shade and

2980
02:17:45,401 --> 02:17:48,520
I'm,
I'm actually had a trip coming up that

2981
02:17:48,521 --> 02:17:52,450
we did a caribou hunt that we filmed
with under armour for one of their rigs

2982
02:17:52,451 --> 02:17:55,540
reaper series,
which I've done a few of those that um,

2983
02:17:55,700 --> 02:17:56,350
you,
my brother,

2984
02:17:56,350 --> 02:17:59,350
you did one and then me and my brother
did a moose hunt.

2985
02:17:59,351 --> 02:18:02,050
That was just before that green trees.

2986
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:06,100
Australia on cam has a couple of the on
cam's got the,

2987
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:11,950
he had the elk this year and then the.
Is that Australia has got the time.

2988
02:18:12,060 --> 02:18:15,470
Will chose him working in the job.
Yeah that was good one.

2989
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:17,870
So anyways,
um,

2990
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:23,050
I'm leaving for that shortly.
So I'm sitting out there makIng a list

2991
02:18:23,051 --> 02:18:28,051
on my phone and I'm full camoed up,
but I had no gloves on and I've got my

2992
02:18:28,511 --> 02:18:33,511
phone there and I hear this slight noise
behind me and I turned around in,

2993
02:18:34,601 --> 02:18:39,601
this coyote is running full speed at me,
like full tilt and I cocked my fist

2994
02:18:40,481 --> 02:18:43,690
back,
that punch in the face and it like hits

2995
02:18:43,691 --> 02:18:47,410
the brakes and start skidding because
it's running down hill.

2996
02:18:47,710 --> 02:18:52,210
So I think my estimation of what
happened was I'm sitting there with my

2997
02:18:52,211 --> 02:18:57,211
hands and cammo and saw maybe the flash
of my hands working on the phone or

2998
02:18:57,311 --> 02:19:00,310
maybe something in the flash in the
phone and thought it was a small animal.

2999
02:19:00,550 --> 02:19:02,230
Probably thought it was a rabbit or
something.

3000
02:19:02,290 --> 02:19:06,460
I'm not sure.
This is just what I'm assuming it ran in

3001
02:19:06,461 --> 02:19:10,000
so fast and so quiet.
I don't know what I heard,

3002
02:19:10,001 --> 02:19:14,090
but I happened to turn around at the
right time and when I turned around at

3003
02:19:14,110 --> 02:19:18,560
things eyes I swear just doubled in size
and he hit the brakes and his ass

3004
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:20,110
started skidding toward me because I
was.

3005
02:19:20,410 --> 02:19:24,640
I was going to punch it,
had no clue what else to do and it it

3006
02:19:24,641 --> 02:19:29,641
started like skidded and this started
rolling and then got up within could

3007
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:34,160
have grabbed it and just reeled off the
other direction 100 miles away,

3008
02:19:34,370 --> 02:19:38,900
but it was in full on attack mode.
I don't think he realized what it was

3009
02:19:38,901 --> 02:19:40,640
attacking.
I don't think it knew that I was a

3010
02:19:40,641 --> 02:19:43,460
person.
I think it just thought movement,

3011
02:19:43,610 --> 02:19:45,200
movement,
small thing,

3012
02:19:45,860 --> 02:19:48,750
attack and when I scared the shit out of
it,

3013
02:19:48,751 --> 02:19:49,480
it's crazy.

3014
02:19:49,480 --> 02:19:51,260
Your hand.
Little little squirrel.

3015
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:54,080
Squirrel or something.
It was just coming full tilt.

3016
02:19:54,500 --> 02:19:57,740
So quiet.
It's just so quiet.

3017
02:19:57,741 --> 02:20:00,980
I see how they can grab stuff.
Have you ever had a mountain lion sneak

3018
02:20:00,981 --> 02:20:05,210
up on you?
I'm not sneak up on me,

3019
02:20:05,211 --> 02:20:09,650
but I've been in very close proximity.
I was in Arizona,

3020
02:20:09,740 --> 02:20:13,100
hemanchu's deer with my bow probably.
I don't even know.

3021
02:20:13,101 --> 02:20:17,690
Maybe even 10 years ago now,
and I was going through this wash and I

3022
02:20:17,691 --> 02:20:20,510
see it drag mark and tracks.
I'm like,

3023
02:20:20,570 --> 02:20:25,100
oh,
a lion killed a cow and drug it through

3024
02:20:25,101 --> 02:20:28,010
this wash and I'm like,
sweet.

3025
02:20:28,280 --> 02:20:33,280
I was filming.
I had my video camera in my backpack so

3026
02:20:33,651 --> 02:20:38,150
I'm bent over getting my video camera
out because I'm going to like film the

3027
02:20:38,151 --> 02:20:40,790
tracks and the drag mark and then maybe
finding the cow.

3028
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:46,350
Well in the wash it's like sand and then
each tree and some real tall grass and

3029
02:20:47,301 --> 02:20:52,301
I'm bent over going through my backpack
and I look up and maybe three,

3030
02:20:52,521 --> 02:20:53,290
four feet away.

3031
02:20:53,290 --> 02:20:56,900
Is that cat crouched down?
Just looking at me through the grass.

3032
02:20:56,901 --> 02:20:58,360
three or four feet away?
Yeah,

3033
02:20:58,790 --> 02:20:59,970
within.
Yeah.

3034
02:21:00,260 --> 02:21:01,730
Two arms length.
So 40 feet away.

3035
02:21:01,800 --> 02:21:03,020
So like right where I am.
Yeah,

3036
02:21:03,021 --> 02:21:06,570
exactly.
And I look up and I lock eyes with it

3037
02:21:06,890 --> 02:21:11,890
just and it and it like slinks back,
goes underneath the log and pops up at

3038
02:21:12,501 --> 02:21:16,610
maybe 15,
20 feet and turns of stairs like oh

3039
02:21:16,611 --> 02:21:19,370
shit.
And then I get the camera out and then

3040
02:21:19,371 --> 02:21:22,310
it just sauntered off like digit on
film.

3041
02:21:22,630 --> 02:21:24,980
Um,
I think I got it walking away but I

3042
02:21:24,981 --> 02:21:26,950
didn't get it when it was close.
Cause now I'm like,

3043
02:21:27,260 --> 02:21:31,280
now I'm digging for my pistol brushes.
And where was my pistol?

3044
02:21:31,281 --> 02:21:34,790
It was in the bag too.
I don't know what my deal is to keep my

3045
02:21:34,791 --> 02:21:39,380
pistol in my bag or steven.
I'm so.

3046
02:21:39,381 --> 02:21:44,381
Then it went off well what it had done,
it had drugged the calf into that,

3047
02:21:45,110 --> 02:21:49,640
into that patch of grass and then they
kind of bury it and it just been gorging

3048
02:21:49,641 --> 02:21:52,940
on it and it was laying on top of it and
I didn't even see any of that because

3049
02:21:52,941 --> 02:21:55,580
I'm so focused on the tracks and
everything else.

3050
02:21:55,580 --> 02:21:59,270
I didn't even notice it and it was the
way it was the lane that the cow is

3051
02:21:59,271 --> 02:22:01,550
tucked up under the tree and covered in
stuff.

3052
02:22:01,551 --> 02:22:05,180
She couldn't see it until I went through
the thick grass and that cat must have

3053
02:22:05,181 --> 02:22:10,181
just heard me in slunk down waiting for
me to go by and then it was probably

3054
02:22:11,301 --> 02:22:12,980
just so full.
It had no end.

3055
02:22:12,981 --> 02:22:15,350
They're faring fairly shy animals as
well,

3056
02:22:15,650 --> 02:22:19,040
but I was very vulnerable position.
It could have easily jumped on me,

3057
02:22:19,340 --> 02:22:24,200
easily know the only thing I saw was its
eyes and there because it blended in so

3058
02:22:24,201 --> 02:22:25,110
well.
I was.

3059
02:22:25,111 --> 02:22:26,070
One thing that I was shocked

3060
02:22:26,070 --> 02:22:29,580
by when we were in Nevada is Nevada,
Nevada.

3061
02:22:29,820 --> 02:22:33,870
It is.
So now I know I say Nevada that we were

3062
02:22:33,871 --> 02:22:38,280
in Nevada.
How many domestic cows wander through

3063
02:22:38,281 --> 02:22:40,960
those areas?
Grazing and that they,

3064
02:22:41,500 --> 02:22:44,220
they spend,
I don't know how that works.

3065
02:22:44,310 --> 02:22:47,070
Like they,
they pay money for permits to allow

3066
02:22:47,071 --> 02:22:48,210
these cows to graze.

3067
02:22:48,310 --> 02:22:51,070
Yeah,
you lease a lease it and then you pay x

3068
02:22:51,071 --> 02:22:53,590
amount to the forest service for
grazing,

3069
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:55,660
atonement,
certain areas and then generally you

3070
02:22:55,661 --> 02:22:57,910
have to have him off.
but October 1st.

3071
02:22:58,390 --> 02:23:03,370
So like me and dan dody were on a stock
and we're moving through this area and

3072
02:23:03,371 --> 02:23:07,330
then we hear some noise and this fucking
cows standing in front of us.

3073
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:10,120
Like tHis is just weird.
Like you feel like you shouldn't be

3074
02:23:10,121 --> 02:23:11,680
here.
Like at my end,

3075
02:23:11,980 --> 02:23:14,950
some farm somewhere.
But you're not there just just running

3076
02:23:14,951 --> 02:23:16,510
their cows grAzing.
Yeah.

3077
02:23:16,511 --> 02:23:18,640
And then they'll go up in horses and
just round them up.

3078
02:23:18,760 --> 02:23:20,500
Push them down into the field.
Yeah.

3079
02:23:20,501 --> 02:23:21,510
So odd.
I,

3080
02:23:21,511 --> 02:23:25,030
I didn't understand that.
I always thought that cows were in pens

3081
02:23:25,031 --> 02:23:26,490
and that's just the way it is.
But no,

3082
02:23:26,500 --> 02:23:29,860
there's a lot of cows that are just
wandering around on grazing land.

3083
02:23:30,050 --> 02:23:31,550
Yeah.
It's all open range.

3084
02:23:31,820 --> 02:23:34,700
That was with all that bundy stuff up in
Oregon was about right.

3085
02:23:34,760 --> 02:23:37,640
It was about it.
I'm not an expert on it,

3086
02:23:37,850 --> 02:23:39,320
but I remember them talking.
IT was.

3087
02:23:39,830 --> 02:23:41,210
Yeah.
He didn't pay his,

3088
02:23:41,250 --> 02:23:45,860
his fees.
He said have to erica.

3089
02:23:45,950 --> 02:23:48,440
She was on blm land,
which.

3090
02:23:49,100 --> 02:23:49,933
Okay.
Yeah.

3091
02:23:50,480 --> 02:23:52,420
I mean with bureau of land management.
Yeah.

3092
02:23:52,850 --> 02:23:54,830
And so yeah,
the fees aren't,

3093
02:23:54,860 --> 02:23:57,730
weren't even that much.
It's a lot cheaper than having an on

3094
02:23:57,731 --> 02:23:59,210
private land.
Yeah.

3095
02:23:59,660 --> 02:24:02,030
well there's something that happens to
white people when you leave him alone

3096
02:24:02,031 --> 02:24:02,864
with guns.
YeaH.

3097
02:24:03,490 --> 02:24:07,370
Get a little muddy.
Please leave me alone in the forest with

3098
02:24:07,371 --> 02:24:09,560
guns.
They almost always get a little

3099
02:24:09,561 --> 02:24:10,590
squirrely.
Yeah,

3100
02:24:10,940 --> 02:24:13,850
the poor.
That was a weird stand up though.

3101
02:24:13,940 --> 02:24:17,720
It was very strange because there was
shootouts with the federal rallies and

3102
02:24:17,721 --> 02:24:20,600
everything and they take over soMe kind
of a,

3103
02:24:21,240 --> 02:24:24,040
like forest reserve area.

3104
02:24:24,290 --> 02:24:25,550
Um,
something happened.

3105
02:24:25,670 --> 02:24:29,780
Refuge won some kind of federal little
building out there.

3106
02:24:29,830 --> 02:24:30,663
And there was,
I can't remember.

3107
02:24:30,860 --> 02:24:32,750
one of them was shot and killed.
Yeah,

3108
02:24:33,080 --> 02:24:35,790
I mean it was like a big uproar.
Well,

3109
02:24:35,791 --> 02:24:40,760
a bunch of other fucking yahoo's white
dudes with guns flew there to sort of

3110
02:24:40,761 --> 02:24:42,900
help out.
That's when It got real weird memory of

3111
02:24:42,901 --> 02:24:44,540
those big standoff.
Yeah,

3112
02:24:44,541 --> 02:24:47,720
that's good.
See my mile thought on it is,

3113
02:24:47,770 --> 02:24:49,040
it's,
it's public land.

3114
02:24:49,190 --> 02:24:51,620
It's not your land.
It's our land.

3115
02:24:51,950 --> 02:24:54,860
So you can't go do commercial shit.
It'd be like,

3116
02:24:54,920 --> 02:24:55,491
oh,
you know what,

3117
02:24:55,491 --> 02:24:58,790
I'm just going to go open up a hotel on
the forest service land over here

3118
02:24:58,791 --> 02:25:01,430
because it's my land.
It's government it,

3119
02:25:01,580 --> 02:25:02,450
I own it.
No,

3120
02:25:02,451 --> 02:25:04,000
it's everybody's,
everybody's shit.

3121
02:25:04,260 --> 02:25:05,210
Yeah.
Yeah.

3122
02:25:05,240 --> 02:25:07,010
But people have weird ways justifying
anything.

3123
02:25:07,040 --> 02:25:11,330
Maybe if he's giving out as beef for
free to everyone who owns the land,

3124
02:25:11,690 --> 02:25:13,850
that's the one thing,
but he wasn't doing that.

3125
02:25:14,120 --> 02:25:14,690
So,
uh,

3126
02:25:14,690 --> 02:25:15,950
before we wrap this up,
do you have any,

3127
02:25:15,951 --> 02:25:17,690
uh,
interesting places that you're headed to

3128
02:25:17,691 --> 02:25:19,520
soon?
Um,

3129
02:25:19,940 --> 02:25:24,640
I'll be going down to Mexico next week.
And then was that sonora sonora?

3130
02:25:24,730 --> 02:25:25,350
Yeah,
that's,

3131
02:25:25,350 --> 02:25:26,680
that's always been there.
Yeah.

3132
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:28,990
It's amazing down there of real Mexico,
right?

3133
02:25:28,991 --> 02:25:29,824
Yeah.
That's cool.

3134
02:25:30,050 --> 02:25:32,050
It's awesome.
Do you want that ramps that steve goes

3135
02:25:32,051 --> 02:25:33,280
to all the time?
Um,

3136
02:25:33,610 --> 02:25:35,530
similar area.
Different place.

3137
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:37,660
YeaH.
I thought that was amazing where they

3138
02:25:37,690 --> 02:25:41,680
showed how they preserve buffalo,
where they would cut it really thin and

3139
02:25:41,681 --> 02:25:44,690
hanging on clotheslines to dry it and
make machaca as

3140
02:25:46,260 --> 02:25:48,940
a I went.
I've been to that place a couple times.

3141
02:25:48,941 --> 02:25:51,040
That place is pretty cool.
Where they've got those buffalo down

3142
02:25:51,041 --> 02:25:52,150
there.
Is that what you did?

3143
02:25:52,151 --> 02:25:54,490
That episode of solo hunter where you
put the wolf skin?

3144
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:56,270
A apex predator.
Apex predator,

3145
02:25:56,310 --> 02:25:56,650
sorry.
Yeah,

3146
02:25:56,650 --> 02:25:58,330
and we still those apex predator
episodes,

3147
02:25:58,331 --> 02:26:03,331
you can still go apex predator.tv and if
you just want to get them,

3148
02:26:03,521 --> 02:26:04,900
you can get the downloads still.

3149
02:26:05,020 --> 02:26:06,640
I think that's the only place that
exists now.

3150
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:08,290
But um,
yeah,

3151
02:26:08,291 --> 02:26:09,280
I did that.
That was cool.

3152
02:26:09,281 --> 02:26:14,050
They show up sometime on dvr because I
have you as a season pass,

3153
02:26:14,051 --> 02:26:15,670
like sometimes they'll just throw one
on.

3154
02:26:15,880 --> 02:26:16,900
Yeah,
that makes sense.

3155
02:26:17,020 --> 02:26:19,010
On the channel and it'll just pop up.
Yeah,

3156
02:26:19,210 --> 02:26:20,260
that's what my buddy was like,
hey,

3157
02:26:20,370 --> 02:26:22,890
they're doing an apex predator marathon
time.

3158
02:26:23,710 --> 02:26:26,050
Can they do that?
Did you want to do more of those?

3159
02:26:27,240 --> 02:26:29,500
Yes and no.
I really enjoyed doing it,

3160
02:26:29,890 --> 02:26:34,110
but the other thing is I also liked
everything else I was doing and there

3161
02:26:34,111 --> 02:26:38,110
was a lot of tv networks are dying.
They just,

3162
02:26:38,480 --> 02:26:43,480
it seems like they don't want to,
they don't want shows it or it was a,

3163
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:46,900
I thought it was extreme.
It was an extremely high quality show

3164
02:26:46,901 --> 02:26:50,740
for that network and those high quality
shows Costs too much for that network to

3165
02:26:50,741 --> 02:26:53,240
make is whether it ended up being,
um,

3166
02:26:53,440 --> 02:26:55,480
now is there a way to do something like
that for the internet?

3167
02:26:55,870 --> 02:26:58,470
Because I know that netflix is starting
to do rinella.

3168
02:26:58,480 --> 02:27:01,630
Shows,
flicks and he's still on regular tv too,

3169
02:27:01,631 --> 02:27:02,350
right?
Yeah.

3170
02:27:02,350 --> 02:27:04,480
Um,
I think they're just reruns.

3171
02:27:04,481 --> 02:27:06,880
I don't think there's any new stuff.
I'm not sure new stuff is just going to

3172
02:27:06,881 --> 02:27:08,170
be on netflix.
I don't know.

3173
02:27:08,260 --> 02:27:10,160
I don't know.
I'm not really sure how interesting.

3174
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:11,860
Yeah,
I have to ask him,

3175
02:27:12,280 --> 02:27:14,650
but uh,
yeah,

3176
02:27:14,651 --> 02:27:15,251
I,
you know,

3177
02:27:15,251 --> 02:27:18,340
I think there,
there will be a plaCe for that kind of

3178
02:27:18,341 --> 02:27:21,610
stuff in the future when I think,
you know,

3179
02:27:21,670 --> 02:27:24,100
but I,
I enjoyed doing it but I also didn't

3180
02:27:24,101 --> 02:27:28,840
want to do 15 episodes of it a year
because there was other things that I

3181
02:27:28,841 --> 02:27:32,050
enjoy doing.
I enjoy doing those under armor pieces.

3182
02:27:32,051 --> 02:27:36,280
I enjoy giving solo hunters enjoy doing
a lot of stuff.

3183
02:27:36,610 --> 02:27:40,360
I don't like just doing one thing.
So when you do a lot of New Zealand as

3184
02:27:40,361 --> 02:27:42,730
well,
so I'll be going over to New Zealand

3185
02:27:42,731 --> 02:27:43,564
this year.

3186
02:27:45,060 --> 02:27:47,710
yeah,
because that's a place where again,

3187
02:27:47,740 --> 02:27:50,230
it's all invasive species,
invasive species in New Zealand and

3188
02:27:50,231 --> 02:27:52,780
Australia.
I really liked Australia when I went

3189
02:27:52,781 --> 02:27:57,781
there actually that a video with green
tree and cam actually swung by kind of

3190
02:27:58,571 --> 02:28:02,320
crash their party for a couple of days
when they're taking is cool as fun.

3191
02:28:03,350 --> 02:28:06,910
I had a good time over there and then I
went and did my own thing after they,

3192
02:28:06,940 --> 02:28:10,030
after they left for their buffalo,
I kind of went off and did my own thing

3193
02:28:10,031 --> 02:28:11,470
somewhere completely different.
Yeah,

3194
02:28:11,471 --> 02:28:12,520
you went by yourself,
right?

3195
02:28:12,850 --> 02:28:14,230
Um,
yeah,

3196
02:28:14,231 --> 02:28:16,900
I,
I have a friend over there and so we

3197
02:28:16,901 --> 02:28:21,200
drove out into arnhem land which is like
aboriginal land.

3198
02:28:21,201 --> 02:28:22,310
We got special permission

3199
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:25,700
and got all these permits and everything
and we drove out there and went hunting

3200
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:28,340
for a week and a half,
two weeks,

3201
02:28:28,341 --> 02:28:30,380
something like that.
And uh,

3202
02:28:30,540 --> 02:28:32,510
and then we,
because we only had one vehicle between

3203
02:28:32,511 --> 02:28:35,450
the two of us,
so I dropped him off somewhere and then

3204
02:28:35,451 --> 02:28:39,050
I'd drive out and then go hunt and then
the next day he would take the vehicle

3205
02:28:39,051 --> 02:28:42,140
and I would go out and hunt.
So I was hunting by myself for most,

3206
02:28:42,680 --> 02:28:43,790
most of it,
which was,

3207
02:28:44,870 --> 02:28:48,530
I liked that experience because it's
kinda dangerous and buffalo,

3208
02:28:49,010 --> 02:28:51,980
but it's when you only have a bow and
you're completely by yourself.

3209
02:28:52,220 --> 02:28:54,410
There is no,
you aren't gonna get medivaced out of

3210
02:28:54,411 --> 02:28:59,360
there in a helicopter because you're 13
hours by vehicle from the nearest town.

3211
02:29:00,340 --> 02:29:02,210
Yeah.
I don't know how you even get out.

3212
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:07,040
He'd be in a world of hurt.
You hear that adult greentree fuck that

3213
02:29:07,041 --> 02:29:07,874
place.

3214
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:11,010
He's keeps trying to get me to go there.
Stop it at him.

3215
02:29:11,550 --> 02:29:12,650
Yeah.
It's a cool place.

3216
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:15,770
I enjoyed it.
It's a certain type of person will

3217
02:29:15,771 --> 02:29:17,570
really like it and other people will
hate it.

3218
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:18,433
Yeah.
People like you.

3219
02:29:18,560 --> 02:29:20,650
That's why you need to have a television
show or not,

3220
02:29:21,250 --> 02:29:26,250
if not a television show.
Some real in depth show that that they

3221
02:29:26,991 --> 02:29:29,990
do on the internet.
That shows like the preparation that's

3222
02:29:29,991 --> 02:29:32,420
involved.
I just think it's something that most

3223
02:29:32,421 --> 02:29:35,810
people are ignorant to think,
so I'm kind of obsessed with that.

3224
02:29:35,990 --> 02:29:38,810
The idea of explaining it to people.
Yeah.

3225
02:29:39,400 --> 02:29:40,610
Yeah.
I think that that hunt.

3226
02:29:40,700 --> 02:29:43,040
You can.
I filmed it for solo so you can watch

3227
02:29:43,041 --> 02:29:44,450
that and I thought that turned out
pretty good.

3228
02:29:44,451 --> 02:29:45,450
That was really cool.
I saw it,

3229
02:29:45,980 --> 02:29:49,460
but there's just something to you about
north american hunting and we have so

3230
02:29:49,461 --> 02:29:50,240
much.

3231
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:54,410
Awesome.
We have a lot of awesome places here,

3232
02:29:54,460 --> 02:29:57,000
but a lot of people live close to them.
Probably don't even take advantage of

3233
02:29:57,001 --> 02:29:58,280
them,
but there's a lot of cool places and a

3234
02:29:58,281 --> 02:30:03,281
lot of cool things you can do in the us
and in the western us and it was just a

3235
02:30:04,431 --> 02:30:05,840
lot of cool places around.
Well,

3236
02:30:05,841 --> 02:30:08,360
one of the things that I said when we
were in Nevada,

3237
02:30:08,510 --> 02:30:09,051
set it right,
right.

3238
02:30:09,051 --> 02:30:09,590
Yeah.
Got it.

3239
02:30:09,590 --> 02:30:11,240
When we were up there,
uh,

3240
02:30:11,300 --> 02:30:13,720
outside of reno,
it's like three hours outside of reno,

3241
02:30:13,740 --> 02:30:16,860
somewhere like that.
So I was saying,

3242
02:30:16,980 --> 02:30:20,960
but yeah,
this might as well be some alien world.

3243
02:30:21,250 --> 02:30:22,950
Like there's nothing up there.
No,

3244
02:30:23,030 --> 02:30:26,030
it's a lot.
A lot of public land and not much in

3245
02:30:26,031 --> 02:30:29,960
between.
And these big giant hills and valleys

3246
02:30:29,961 --> 02:30:31,890
where there's nothing in them but
animals.

3247
02:30:31,891 --> 02:30:33,320
And it's just weird.
Yeah.

3248
02:30:33,320 --> 02:30:35,600
It's not flat.
No mountains or

3249
02:30:37,160 --> 02:30:39,040
13,000 feet.
Yeah,

3250
02:30:39,170 --> 02:30:41,570
it's on one of them.
It's pretty incredible.

3251
02:30:41,630 --> 02:30:45,530
It's pretty incredible.
But it's also incredible that so few

3252
02:30:45,531 --> 02:30:48,620
people understand that this is all
public land.

3253
02:30:48,621 --> 02:30:51,650
You can go out there anytime you want.
You can go travel this stuff.

3254
02:30:51,651 --> 02:30:55,940
And that's one of the reasons why people
like back country hunters and anglers

3255
02:30:55,950 --> 02:30:58,660
and conservation groups are so
important.

3256
02:30:58,900 --> 02:31:03,800
They preserve your access to these
places because there are so many places

3257
02:31:03,801 --> 02:31:08,450
like that that are just fantastic and
they're there for you and most people

3258
02:31:08,451 --> 02:31:10,970
don't even know about it.
Even if you have zero desire to go

3259
02:31:10,971 --> 02:31:12,590
hunting,
just go and visit.

3260
02:31:12,650 --> 02:31:15,890
Just go and wander through those woods
in Idaho.

3261
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:17,240
Just go.
Yeah,

3262
02:31:17,480 --> 02:31:22,350
there's some cool places that there is.
It's just cool to walk into a spot.

3263
02:31:22,860 --> 02:31:25,620
Especially Idaho has got huge wilderness
areas.

3264
02:31:25,621 --> 02:31:30,420
Walk in there and look around and think
it's what everything looks like when

3265
02:31:30,421 --> 02:31:31,140
there's no roads.

3266
02:31:31,140 --> 02:31:33,390
When there's.
There's nothing you might be the only

3267
02:31:33,391 --> 02:31:36,300
person for.
It's a cool feeling to be know that

3268
02:31:36,301 --> 02:31:39,750
there's no one else around and it's not
much different than it was 5,000 years

3269
02:31:39,751 --> 02:31:40,584
ago.
It's not.

3270
02:31:40,720 --> 02:31:43,040
It's not much has changed.
All right,

3271
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:44,310
I've got to get out of here for.
So stop.

3272
02:31:44,550 --> 02:31:46,170
Start coughing up a storm.
Cool.

3273
02:31:46,380 --> 02:31:48,420
Fighting off a little bit of a cold here
in redmond warrant.

3274
02:31:48,510 --> 02:31:49,770
Oh,
That nasty.

3275
02:31:49,771 --> 02:31:52,680
Flu virus.
The flu virus.

3276
02:31:52,681 --> 02:31:55,140
I just have a mild mild cough.
It's no big deal.

3277
02:31:55,930 --> 02:31:57,310
It's really,
it's all fine.

3278
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:01,370
How often do work out?
I'll show you what it is.

3279
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:05,910
A virus,
a remy warren on twitter,

3280

3281
02:32:08,610 --> 02:32:10,680

3282
02:32:10,860 --> 02:32:11,700

02:32:11,940 --> 02:32:13,420
Mostly instagram.
