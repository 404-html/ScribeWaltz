1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,570
All right,
sweetie.

2
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,530
We live.
What's up?

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,120
Hey,
finally,

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,600
finally across the table from Joe Rogan
himself.

5
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,650
My pleasure,
man.

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:18,740
I watch a Netflix documentary today too.
It's great,

7
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:19,820
man.
It's intense.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,300
Thank you very much.
That was when I first saw it.

9
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:24,650
I was like,
what is this going to be about?

10
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,330
But you get into it and you're like,
Whoa,

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,370
there's a lot going on in this
documentary.

12
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:32,150
There's big guys had more than fuck.
It's not just that.

13
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:35,450
It's like they just went,
they went deep into your life and to

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,050
everything.
The struggles to the heart condition,

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:40,080
the whole deal,
man.

16
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:40,670
It's,
yeah,

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,410
it's heavy.
It did a pretty good job.

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,420
Yeah.
So where are you staying now?

19
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:45,790
Like health wise?
Oh,

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,150
oh,
okay.

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:48,990
Um,
yeah.

22
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,740
Uh,
I fought my way back and just recently

23
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:54,020
this June,
uh,

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,660
had another set bag,
had no other major setback and a heart

25
00:00:57,661 --> 00:01:00,500
attack out of the blue.
And I thought I was a gun,

26
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:00,690
right.

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,800
Again,
Joe,

28
00:01:01,801 --> 00:01:06,000
but I'm still here.
So you had a heart attack.

29
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,930
They fixed your heart.
They put in an artificial valve and then

30
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,100
what happened with the second?

31
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,650
Okay.
Uh,

32
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,380
then that lasted for 12 years.
I had oh five,

33
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:19,910
I had the surgery to open heart surgery
actually passed away or flatline three

34
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:24,200
times during that surgery.
And then this past June I did the blue.

35
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,590
I'm thinking,
well it's not really out of the blue on

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,490
kind of had a few signs,
but I thought I,

37
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:30,530
you know,
I didn't think it was that serious.

38
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:35,330
I mean I had another heart attack
sitting on the counter at home and uh,

39
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,650
I thought I was gone for sure man.

40
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,800
Well,
what's confusing to a lot of people is

41
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,360
you're obviously this like intense
healthy guy and you're,

42
00:01:45,361 --> 00:01:48,470
you're fit and you're lifting weights
and you're looking jacked.

43
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,070
Like is it a condition that you were
born with a genetic condition?

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,420
It is.
Most definitely hereditary.

45
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,600
My mother and all nine of her siblings
all passed away from heart related

46
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:06,000
problems and my mom had the chf lungs
and you know,

47
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,730
so many of them,
we have pastor 72 are,

48
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,630
my mom died at 63 they all passed away
and I will do now I'm 58.

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,820
And so you've gotten through two of them
so far?

50
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,710
Yeah.
So far.

51
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,990
And what did they do after the second
heart attack?

52
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,821
Well,
they,

53
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:23,620
they the,
the next thing I had a pacemaker

54
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:27,100
installed in a,
I got the already had metal valve and I

55
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,730
think they'd done just about all we can
do this or this one.

56
00:02:30,731 --> 00:02:33,400
I got you down.
So they tell him next step is a

57
00:02:33,401 --> 00:02:34,234
transplant

58
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,050
man.
That's intense.

59
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,540
Yeah.
But you know what,

60
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,460
Yo,
uh,

61
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,490
it's not so intense for me.
I think I have a,

62
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,930
um,
uh,

63
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,280
had bandage to somebody else who might
be getting the news.

64
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,280
Uh,
and the advantage is I've been through

65
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:57,020
so much already man,
until,

66
00:02:57,021 --> 00:02:57,980
you know,
it's just,

67
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,270
and when you three times it ain't too
much else.

68
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:03,220
Can you know,
throw you for too many loops.

69
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,750
I got a lot of faith now.
Um,

70
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,640
so you,
are you in line for transplant now?

71
00:03:09,641 --> 00:03:10,810
Is that how that works?
Yeah,

72
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,200
well it's a really long process,
Steve,

73
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,690
and get on the west.
So I'm going,

74
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,430
you know,
through that process.

75
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:19,031
Now I'm,
I'm,

76
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,670
I'm almost through lean,
uh,

77
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,180
but it's a really long process.
If they presented my case to the doctors

78
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:28,060
who perform,
asks for a transplant and they said that

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,260
I'm a good candidate and everything's
looking at right now,

80
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:37,290
except I may have a little throwback or
I had a a cancer biopsy yesterday and if

81
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,070
that's positive,
then that's going to hold me up a little

82
00:03:42,071 --> 00:03:43,570
bit for heaven.
Jesus Christ.

83
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,970
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

84
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,470
No,

85
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,170
it's just crazy because when you look at
a guy like you and you know,

86
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:49,920
you look at you,
when you,

87
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,540
especially in you and your prime,
you think there's,

88
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,610
nothing's going to stop this guy.
Shit,

89
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:56,910
I didn't think so.
I mean,

90
00:03:56,911 --> 00:04:00,060
I feel like your muscles are strong.
Your heart's a muscle shit.

91
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:01,780
His heart's got to be ridiculous.
Yeah,

92
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:03,950
I probably,
I thought I was indestructible.

93
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,450
Go,
but obviously I was wrong.

94
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,550
Well,
you pretty much,

95
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:09,420
I mean,
correct me if I'm wrong,

96
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,430
but you pretty much became famous from
the Internet right now.

97
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,450
Definitely launched it right there for
me,

98
00:04:14,451 --> 00:04:15,284
man.
I ain't,

99
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,240
nobody knew who I was.
Do I got fit when I was 53 until I was

100
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:22,350
53 years or when I was world champion?
Nobody knew what gave a fuck about who

101
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,750
pretty much when I found out about it.
And you're like,

102
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,820
when you first started making youtube
videos,

103
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,230
that's when I found out about yet I
think someone on twitter sat me,

104
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,360
uh,
you know,

105
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,900
like people send me cool shit on twitter
all the time,

106
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:34,470
you know,
like,

107
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,710
and retweet it or I'll find out about it
and send it to other people.

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,690
And someone sent me some,
um,

109
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,960
well I've seen a bunch of your videos,
but one of them was you working out with

110
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,060
Tyron Woodley,
UFC welterweight champion.

111
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:46,080
And I was like,
Jesus Christ,

112
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:49,380
he's going to break them.
He got tired of doing all these crazy

113
00:04:49,381 --> 00:04:53,490
super sets and all this different shit.
And so if you worked with a lot of MMA

114
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:54,840
fighters,
not a lot,

115
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:59,370
but a few and uh,
oh man.

116
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:02,370
Are we going to talk about the fake
feud?

117
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,040
That that wasn't an yeah,
we can talk about it,

118
00:05:05,041 --> 00:05:06,320
but it didn't,
it wasn't a fake.

119
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,730
Oh man,
it really,

120
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,330
your light is killing me.
Oh yeah.

121
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,450
Keeps lighting your face.
I've got to talk about it and got to

122
00:05:15,451 --> 00:05:17,810
talk about thought that we were really
upset at each other.

123
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,400
I was,
the debate was,

124
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:25,401
and this is a constant debate in mma,
whether big muscles in enhance you or

125
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:26,130
hurt you.

126
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,770
And My,
my take on it is they do both.

127
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,100
My take on it is the bigger the muscle,
the more power you have.

128
00:05:32,101 --> 00:05:35,640
And I think tyron is a perfect example
of a guy who's figured out how to use

129
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:38,250
them perfectly.
Like what he does is he conserves as

130
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,710
energy and when he sprints you can't
stop him.

131
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,790
So like when he's in the,
in the cage and he has these moments of

132
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:47,640
explosion,
the amount of horsepower that he can

133
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:51,120
generate in a short period of time is
just above and beyond everybody else in

134
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:53,070
the division.
And it's a terrifying thing for

135
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:56,970
everybody in the division.
But he can't operate at the same pace

136
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,090
constantly.
Like some of the guys can't.

137
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,970
Some of the guys who have less muscle,
the cane around less mass,

138
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:06,890
they have a less oxygen requirements.
They can go longer,

139
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:09,020
but they just can't generate the same
kind of power.

140
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,170
But what tyrons figured out how to do
pretty brilliantly is how to conserve

141
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:16,300
his energy into these bursts.
And,

142
00:06:16,301 --> 00:06:19,010
and then now,
like his big criticism earlier in his

143
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:21,890
career was that he would gas out as he
got into the later rounds,

144
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:24,110
but now he's able to fight five rounds.
No problem.

145
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:25,610
He just fights it at his pace.

146
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,890
Exactly.
But that's not exactly,

147
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:32,100
I want to start it with this two.
Okay.

148
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,050
Now,
uh,

149
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,400
for all the people,
all the people said that I would never

150
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:40,950
be able to sit down across the table
from Joe Rogan.

151
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,040
I want to take a special moment to say,
fuck Yo.

152
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,860
Right man.
Uh,

153
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,980
I'm here and I'm in.
I attacked Joe Rogan on the Internet.

154
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,270
I attacked him and I want to explore.
I got the opportunity to explain to you,

155
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,850
it's true.
I did attack Joe Rogan and I want,

156
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:05,610
I have the opportunity to explain to you
why exactly I did that.

157
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,140
Okay.
And I want to do that because I don't

158
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,750
want you to think I'm just an asshole.

159
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,110
No,
I didn't think you were an asshole at

160
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:12,400
all.
It didn't bother me at all.

161
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,161
Oh,
okay.

162
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,100
I didn't change my feelings.
I never attacked you back.

163
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,040
No.
So she,

164
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,980
you should did you,
but you know what you did do too,

165
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,640
but then I couldn't get you to do before
that was,

166
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:25,930
you've actually talked to me and tried
to talk to me.

167
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,470
I wanted to talk to you though that I
had people,

168
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,220
Eh,
uh,

169
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,530
you know,
cause I'm really cool with a lot of UFC

170
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:36,050
fighters and I said,
wow,

171
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,160
I wonder if he even knows him.
But they had people that was especially

172
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,310
set out to keep tagging you until you
were going to get you on the podcast.

173
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,560
So he knows that that shit does not
work.

174
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,510
That's the way to get on the podcast is
to get a bunch of people that,

175
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,570
oh my God,
the CCTC team who then we're going to

176
00:07:55,571 --> 00:07:56,420
get you.
Hey Joe.

177
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,580
Hey Joe.
We won't tell our CTO and I,

178
00:07:58,581 --> 00:07:59,270
you know,
my,

179
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,930
my response is always,
you know,

180
00:08:00,931 --> 00:08:02,810
Joe,
he probably don't even know who the fuck

181
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:03,830
I am man.
Just,

182
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:04,850
you know,
quick tag him.

183
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,350
He don't,
he don't even know who the fuck I am.

184
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,420
Just quit tagging them.
Don't bother the man.

185
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,680
That was my,
uh,

186
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,450
you know,
response to them all the time.

187
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:12,111
All the time.
I just said,

188
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:13,880
look,
don't behind the Joe,

189
00:08:13,881 --> 00:08:15,890
he's busy.
You don't know the fucking ham.

190
00:08:15,891 --> 00:08:16,491
I'm not,
you know,

191
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:18,940
not in that league,
so don't even bother him.

192
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,941
And I said,
well,

193
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:21,920
you know what,
I got these fighters,

194
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:25,400
I know all these fighters and they
friendly with me.

195
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:27,950
I said,
maybe till do know who I am.

196
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,811
And I'm like,
you know,

197
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:32,240
after I made it,
you just don't like my ass.

198
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,350
So I see,
you know,

199
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:37,330
Tony Tyron Woodley thing came up and
they was talking about the muscular guy.

200
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,731
I said,
well,

201
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:38,890
you know,
here's my arm turns.

202
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,670
Hey Joe,
you don't know what the fuck you're

203
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:42,610
talking about.
And as soon as I could,

204
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,430
I said,
hey joe,

205
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:45,260
that motherfucker don't know what the
fuck he talking about.

206
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,560
Then you responded to,
I responded to you cause I like you.

207
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,340
Oh Wow.
Responding.

208
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:50,911
Yeah,
why?

209
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:53,010
I really didn't.
That's why I didn't attack you back.

210
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,850
I get why people,
he has a thing.

211
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,000
I get why people would think that I
don't respond because I don't like you.

212
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:02,400
I just can't keep up.
Oh Man.

213
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:06,510
I understand him.
I found out I have 1.6 million fake

214
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:08,380
followers though.
Oh Wow.

215
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,270
Apparently that's not a real,
a good measurement.

216
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,620
You know the,
the twitter audit,

217
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,780
it's just,
people don't use their account to tweet.

218
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:17,250
Maybe they just check twitter.
I Dunno.

219
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,860
I Dunno whether or not,
but I've never paid for any of the fake

220
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:21,870
ones.
They might be Russian bots.

221
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,780
I don't know what it is.
But um,

222
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,380
there's too many people.
I look at my mentions and,

223
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,550
and then at least 1% of them are
assholes so that you read one assholes

224
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,480
things like,
fuck this,

225
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:35,310
you put your phone down.
So it's,

226
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,190
it's not a matter of like me not liking
people.

227
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:41,190
It's a matter of me in it being in an
impossible situation.

228
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,240
There's no way I can keep up.

229
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,100
You're only one guy.

230
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,470
I am the only one guy.
I don't let anybody fuck with my

231
00:09:47,471 --> 00:09:48,760
twitter.
Nobody's,

232
00:09:48,761 --> 00:09:50,110
nobody's doing that.
That's all me.

233
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,070
So,
yeah,

234
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:53,080
so there's,
if you get a tweet from me,

235
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:54,980
it's from me.
Why don't I,

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
there's no way I can keep up with all of
them.

237
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:59,830
So people that try to talk to me and get
ahold of me,

238
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,680
if you think I'm ignoring you,
it's just I'm ignoring everything.

239
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,060
Yeah.
Well man,

240
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,300
Nah,
I don't feel so bad

241
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,790
that was in,
I wanted to kick to or tend to,

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,800
uh,
I was trying to get that.

243
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:14,390
That's what,
so that's why I came out with the attack

244
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,560
and,
and uh,

245
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,600
well it worked.
Yeah,

246
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,840
it did.
At least you got,

247
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,830
I was trying to be nice for as soon as
I'm going to ask.

248
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,210
So then he responded.
I said,

249
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,230
oh man.
I said,

250
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,360
okay Joe,
you're absolutely right.

251
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,910
I jumped over you.
I seen the jumped on you like that.

252
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,620
But we do,
um,

253
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:35,980
we do possess a little difference of
opinion on the muscle guy.

254
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,141
Yeah.
You deal.

255
00:10:37,141 --> 00:10:38,390
So it's,
tell me what you think.

256
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,390
Okay.
Uh,

257
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,280
I was trying to explain that y'all never
know.

258
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:47,240
You have to have known guys like this
that are naturally,

259
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,910
naturally just more muscular.
Yes.

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,500
More built and they look like they lift
weights and work out,

261
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,050
but they don't write guys like,
you know,

262
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,640
I didn't know this guy,
uh,

263
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,590
Herschel Walker.

264
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,780
Sure.
Outstanding Athlete,

265
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,450
you know,
and uh,

266
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,680
both Jackson for example,
these guys,

267
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,620
fantastic athletes,
muscular,

268
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,360
very Muslim guys.
But I think if you were born,

269
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,800
born muscular,
there's a difference in the guy that

270
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:21,110
goes to me,
Jim and works out three,

271
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,580
four hours a day and adds muscle on.
He started out,

272
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,431
you know,
normal guy.

273
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:28,790
But if you were born with that muscle,
then you were born with the

274
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:32,600
cardiovascular system,
the lungs and what not to support that

275
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:34,580
muscle and it's,
yeah,

276
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,490
take it way,
way back to guys like Jim Thorpe.

277
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,250
Okay.
Uh,

278
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,310
head and shoulders above all the other
athletes of his error because he was

279
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:45,620
born that way.
So he was born.

280
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,730
The good Lord gives us the cardio system
in the lungs and everything to,

281
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,713
uh,
you know,

282
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:55,810
to go along with that extra they've,
we were born with in some cases,

283
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,190
in some cases.
Now.

284
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,820
I thought they were making a blanket
statement and it covered a lot of,

285
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,820
you know,
the all muscular guys aren't going to

286
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,940
tire out because of the extra muscle and
I disagreed because I think if they were

287
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:12,430
born with that muscle,
then they were born with the support

288
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:13,360
system to support it.

289
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,080
Demos.
I think there's a lot of logic to that.

290
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,960
I think it makes sense,
but I do think that if you have a

291
00:12:18,961 --> 00:12:23,070
certain amount of muscle,
like there's just no way you are going

292
00:12:23,071 --> 00:12:24,870
to be,
you're going to have the same

293
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:27,810
cardiovascular capabilities as someone
that's been like a marathon runner.

294
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:30,140
You're not going to have,
the marathon runner has.

295
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,450
There's advantages and disadvantages I
think to all sorts of body types,

296
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,400
especially when it comes to fighting.
There's a big advantage to be in

297
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,030
powerful,
scary look at you look at a guy like

298
00:12:39,031 --> 00:12:40,260
Woodley and go,
oh shit.

299
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,660
You know,
like you know you can't stop him like

300
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:43,980
it.
The only thing that's going to stop him

301
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:46,410
as him getting tired or you've got to
catch him when he's coming in.

302
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,000
Right?
He's just faster than you.

303
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,530
Stronger than you.
So there's,

304
00:12:49,531 --> 00:12:50,520
there's benefits to that.

305
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,670
But I think that when it comes to like,
there's no,

306
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:56,220
you never going to see a marathon runner
that's built like Woodley.

307
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,210
They just don't exist.
So even though he has the,

308
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:03,690
the cardiovascular system and the
support system that's designed for that

309
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:07,260
build that he's born with,
he still is never going to be able to

310
00:13:07,261 --> 00:13:11,610
compete with like an elite triathlete
because your body has to be smaller.

311
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,130
You have to have less oxygen
requirements,

312
00:13:14,131 --> 00:13:16,530
less weight that you're carrying around.
There's just no,

313
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,580
there's no way.
But there's benefits there.

314
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,890
Certain,
it's a real,

315
00:13:19,891 --> 00:13:23,310
it's a real like balancing act,
I think at mma because you have to have

316
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:25,560
some muscle,
you have to be able to get guys off you,

317
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,210
you have to be able to get up from the
bottom.

318
00:13:27,211 --> 00:13:30,210
You have to be able to explode.
You have to be able to close the

319
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:32,460
distance quickly.
There's a lot of like real benefits to

320
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:34,080
being powerful,
but then there's,

321
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,980
you know,
it's,

322
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,240
it's like,
uh,

323
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,530
it's a balancing act,

324
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,401
you know?
Yeah,

325
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,330
you're right.
Go.

326
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,280
Uh,
but,

327
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,220
um,
ah,

328
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:46,940
here we go.
It's not just muscle,

329
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,650
Eh,
you don't see,

330
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,760
um,
marathon runners did or you know,

331
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,250
250 pounds either.
They can be fat,

332
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:57,080
smooth butterball,
and,

333
00:13:57,081 --> 00:13:58,100
and still,
you know,

334
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,503
uh,
not,

335
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,110
it's not because of the muscular
musculature that they,

336
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:06,110
you know,
just bigger guy period would have a hard

337
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:09,770
time being a marathon runner.
So the musculature,

338
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,020
that's where we have a little,
I don't think it's the,

339
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:15,450
the muscle trip because that
musculature,

340
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,390
if you're born,
if you're just born more muscular,

341
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:24,020
and if you can look at little kids in
grade school and you see some of the

342
00:14:24,021 --> 00:14:27,710
kids are going to have a six pack,
they're going to just be built better

343
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,470
than the other kids.
And the,

344
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,910
and if fear,
if you're at that muscle,

345
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,220
you were born with that muscle,
in my opinion,

346
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,600
it's just my opinion,
Joe,

347
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,050
if you were born with that muscle and
that musculature,

348
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,040
it's not,
you know,

349
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,110
it,
it's not going to be detrimental in your

350
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,090
system is made for,
you know,

351
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,440
it's good little major system able to in
a bit.

352
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,210
But you're right,
you won't see,

353
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,073
uh,
uh,

354
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,710
anybody built like turn rhyme wouldn't
be running in the New York marathon or

355
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:57,140
winning the New York marathon.
He could run it.

356
00:14:57,141 --> 00:15:01,310
But he was,
when you read that Oprah and me

357
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,350
like four hours and 20 minutes reading,
pretty fucking impressive to beat me.

358
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,920
Right.
But I think that uh,

359
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,950
uh,
that's just a bigger person period is

360
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,310
not how they're defined or the
definition that musculature,

361
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,420
you know,
I know boss route and I talked to her

362
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,490
boss route and a little bit about it and
I say,

363
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,500
man,
boss have built like a fucking statue

364
00:15:27,501 --> 00:15:28,700
and shit.
And he goes,

365
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,580
oh,
and he was quick,

366
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,160
hey man,
but I don't lift weights.

367
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,950
And I said,
you're proving my point.

368
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,890
You're proving my point,
dude.

369
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,870
That's what I'm saying.
If you were born that way,

370
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,850
you didn't go in the gym and lift
weights.

371
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,970
I don't lift weight.
I don't like it proved my point,

372
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:44,810
but I see it.
Right.

373
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,550
You don't,
uh,

374
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,550
you know,
you didn't get that muscle from going to

375
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:53,180
the gym and pumping iron and get good.
You born that way and so,

376
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:56,940
well he was born that way,
but boss also does a tremendous amount

377
00:15:56,941 --> 00:16:00,510
of plows,
like lot of explosive stuff like all of

378
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,280
his bag work.
You'll see boss hit the bag.

379
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:05,580
Oh my God man.
Oh man,

380
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:09,060
that dude is bad.
It's ferocious and everything he does,

381
00:16:09,061 --> 00:16:11,880
he does like with a thousand percent
effort.

382
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,270
So you know his workouts,
like he would tell me that the way he

383
00:16:15,271 --> 00:16:18,840
would work out was when he would prepare
for five minute round.

384
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,030
When he would start to get in shape,
he would go as hard as he could for like

385
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:27,990
a minute and then like be exhausted and
then he will work himself up to a minute

386
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,400
and a half.
Then worked himself up to two minutes

387
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,590
and then by the end of his training
camp,

388
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33,510
he'd go five minutes full clip.
I'm like,

389
00:16:33,511 --> 00:16:37,030
that's fucking crazy.
Method can work.

390
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,220
But in,
you know,

391
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,990
against that,
his boss,

392
00:16:41,991 --> 00:16:45,000
his body started to deteriorate because
he's so God damn tough.

393
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,510
Like he has no cartilage in his knees.
His knees are completely shot.

394
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,880
He kept shooting cortisone and all of
his joints.

395
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:52,200
Like whenever you'd have injuries.
So it was,

396
00:16:52,201 --> 00:16:54,810
joints are all fucked up.
He has got tendinitis everywhere.

397
00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:00,150
It's just his mind was too strong for
like the vehicle that it was carrying

398
00:17:00,151 --> 00:17:00,984
his mind around.

399
00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:02,190
Wow.
Yeah.

400
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,193
Roche,
this dude,

401
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,460
this dude one.
Yeah.

402
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,230
The basketball time.
Yeah.

403
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,730
What do you think about Matt Hughes?
Ah,

404
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,080
I love Matt Hughes.
Okay.

405
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,160
How's he built like a tank if you've
ever seen them.

406
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:14,994
Gas?
Yeah.

407
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:19,510
Well now no,
but you know Matt Hughes in his day.

408
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,820
Let me see how to put this.
Like,

409
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,700
first of all,
he's not built like a tank.

410
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,010
Like maybe the way Woodley's belt is a
little bit,

411
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,280
a little bit more slight than Woodley
but still pretty God damn thick.

412
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,390
Um,
but also like what he was able to do too

413
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:37,450
was he was such a good wrestler.
He was able to dictate where the fight

414
00:17:37,451 --> 00:17:40,240
takes place and a good wrestler can
control situations,

415
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,640
take guys down and then,
you know,

416
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,740
once you're on top,
like you get a break,

417
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,371
you know,
you can,

418
00:17:45,371 --> 00:17:46,680
you could rest and then,
you know,

419
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,700
he would use his ground and pound and
submit.

420
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:52,320
Guys was one of the first guys ever too.
There was a high level wrestler that

421
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,910
started submitting dudes.
Yeah.

422
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,013
Submitted George.

423
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,950
Yeah.
Good.

424
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,620
Good friend of mine also built really
well.

425
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,080
Like a brick shit.
Another one and a cardio is pretty damn

426
00:18:05,081 --> 00:18:06,620
good and I'm bad.
Yeah.

427
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,170
You make you make it my point

428
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,990
just,
I just think there's a,

429
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,490
there's requirements,
right?

430
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:16,670
And if you,
if you can get into a physical shape

431
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,350
where you can use those muscles,
uh,

432
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,090
the way you need to,
do you know what you need to do inside

433
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,350
the octagon.
I mean there's,

434
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,250
there's obviously a great benefit to
being Moscow.

435
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:25,690
Well,
I,

436
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:27,240
I think that,
uh,

437
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:30,630
guys there were naturally born like that
and I say,

438
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,350
I think Saint Pierre and he was both or,
I mean,

439
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:37,430
it wasn't a matter foreign boy.
Yeah.

440
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,600
I think those guys were born.
Sure.

441
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,730
Yeah.
Yeah.

442
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,570
And if you're born,
if you're born like that,

443
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,780
then I think,
you know,

444
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:50,880
but the guys are going to gym and put on
muscle.

445
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,860
They act,
the muscles are what they call bill.

446
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,290
I can't build muscle.
So

447
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,420
small hands.
Smaller frame.

448
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,750
Yeah.
The one he got that built muscle that

449
00:18:58,751 --> 00:19:01,440
built muscle tires out real fast.
And I,

450
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:05,020
and I agree with you 100% on a guy that
has built most,

451
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:08,920
so they went into the gym comp time and
guidance muscles that way.

452
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,440
I agree with you 100% joey.
Absolute correct.

453
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,680
He's going to tire out those added on
muscles,

454
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,830
oxygen's going to suck the winner and
he's going to be tired as fucking no

455
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:18,664
time.

456
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,120
Uh,
you were of Francis and Ghana.

457
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,480
Oh yeah.
He's fighting this weekend and Francis

458
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:28,481
and got just broke the world record for
the most power ever shown in a punch.

459
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:31,340
They have this machine that they use
worldwide.

460
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,970
It's a widely accepted that there's like
one of the best ways to measure a punch.

461
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,230
It's,
it's this large pad and you hit it with

462
00:19:39,231 --> 00:19:44,210
full power and it generates and Frances
and who beat the second place by some,

463
00:19:44,211 --> 00:19:46,040
some insane amount of power.
I mean,

464
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:49,070
he's a ridiculously powerful dude.
He's,

465
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,690
he scares the shit out of everybody
here.

466
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:52,400
He is ready.
So they,

467
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:54,650
uh,
they show show this is this thing.

468
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,940
It shows what the original world record
was.

469
00:19:58,941 --> 00:20:01,820
And then in Gando broke it by like 3000
pounds.

470
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,260
He's ridiculous.
He's terrifying.

471
00:20:06,261 --> 00:20:07,220
You know,
they found this dude,

472
00:20:07,221 --> 00:20:09,950
he was a homeless guy.
If he was home,

473
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:12,290
he was homeless living in France.
And uh,

474
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,910
he made his way into a gym and I believe
he wanted to box and when they brought

475
00:20:16,911 --> 00:20:21,770
him in,
so I guess is see 129,000,

476
00:20:21,771 --> 00:20:25,520
161 units.
The previous one was 114,000.

477
00:20:25,521 --> 00:20:29,120
Like what tyrone spot?
Who's a beast.

478
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,050
And uh,
so frances and Gannon,

479
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,300
who's fighting this weekend,
who is fighting?

480
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,950
Alistair overeem is another,
so fantastic,

481
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:44,890
funny predicts chaos.
That's the same Dick Chaos.

482
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,530
Good for dig suit right there.
Yeah.

483
00:20:47,531 --> 00:20:48,040
I mean

484
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,480
I don't,
we were talking,

485
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:54,100
I was talking about this on my a Lma
podcast that Alistair's been stopped I

486
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:55,870
think in mma.
MMA.

487
00:20:55,871 --> 00:21:00,871
He's been stopped at least 11 times and
I think he's been stopped three or four

488
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:06,541
times in kickboxing as well.
There's like 14 Kaos plus knocked out in

489
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,680
his career,
either Tko or knocked out.

490
00:21:08,681 --> 00:21:10,060
Like,
that's the guy that's got to be worried

491
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,670
about getting hit by the guy who got the
world record punch.

492
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,913
Yeah.
It's,

493
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:18,940
it's going to be a youth and exuberance
versus the experience craftiness.

494
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,090
Yeah,
sure.

495
00:21:20,091 --> 00:21:22,340
Yeah.
That's what it's going to be.

496
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,920
Consequences of allister getting hit
though are so brave and Ghana was so

497
00:21:27,921 --> 00:21:28,550
terrible.

498
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,550
Yeah.
Yeah.

499
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,290
It's you thing,
I mean,

500
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,310
yeah,
it has to be able to use,

501
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,010
they're pretty good.
Yeah.

502
00:21:35,011 --> 00:21:35,850
It's very interesting.

503
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,550
Ghana was supposed to fight junior dos
Santos at one point,

504
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:41,790
which was also really interesting fight.
But I think the Alistair overeem fight

505
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:44,850
is more dangerous for him,
but also it's going to let everybody

506
00:21:44,851 --> 00:21:47,940
know because Alistair's at the top of
the heap and the heavyweight division

507
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,140
right in Ghana can get by ouster most
likely he'll get a shot at the title

508
00:21:52,141 --> 00:21:52,790
very soon.

509
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,550
Right.
So what do you think his ground game?

510
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,390
Well,
we don't know too much about it.

511
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,340
He submitted one guy in the octagon and
you know,

512
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,320
we know that he does have submission
skills.

513
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:05,530
He was one fight by submission,
I think Anthony Hamilton.

514
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,150
But I think,
uh,

515
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,970
you know,
he's for first of all,

516
00:22:09,971 --> 00:22:12,010
every fight starts standing up,
you know,

517
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,220
you gotta get through hell to get that
guy to the gown,

518
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,340
good luck,
you know,

519
00:22:15,341 --> 00:22:18,790
and he's been taken down before and
survived and came back to knock the guy

520
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:19,624
out.
So,

521
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,140
and he's also,
you know,

522
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,440
still learning and growing.
I mean,

523
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,490
he just started really,
you pretty much only been doing it for a

524
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,540
few years.
He's terrifying.

525
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,970
Yeah.
Yeah.

526
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,901
Yeah.
Well,

527
00:22:31,901 --> 00:22:35,620
you know what I think he represents,
I think he represents a real world class

528
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:37,890
athlete that's fighting and mma,
whereas like,

529
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,590
maybe that guy would have gone to
football or somewhere else in another

530
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:45,730
era for sure.
But now that MMA is,

531
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:48,430
you know,
it's like I said the same thing about

532
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:50,290
Jon Jones.
Jon Jones I think could have done

533
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:52,990
anything,
but John Jones got into mma and you see

534
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:55,260
what happens when you see a real world
class half?

535
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,030
Oh Man.
Dang,

536
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,540
Dang good.
Uh,

537
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:04,080
I like John and I got to meet him a few
times and he told me that he listens to

538
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,790
me before he goes out.
And,

539
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:07,271
uh,
you know,

540
00:23:07,271 --> 00:23:12,271
before it goes out and fight.
And I was a real honor for him to say

541
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:12,770
that.
Yeah.

542
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,770
He likes to say I am the one speech that
I did and he always used to say it along

543
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,490
Whitney Cpa,
we were staying in there and gail and in

544
00:23:21,491 --> 00:23:26,491
his phone
and he goes out and kills people like he

545
00:23:27,041 --> 00:23:28,870
does.
He's a murderer man.

546
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,090
Yeah.
I hope he,

547
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,590
I hope he sorts all his problems out.
I don't know what's,

548
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,210
what the fuck's going on with this
recent positive drug test.

549
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
So we'll see.

550
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,030
It seems like the only guy that can beat
Jon Jones.

551
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,900
Jon Jones used to say about Tyson.
It's true.

552
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:45,140
It was true.
It's,

553
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,830
you won all of your world records drug
free.

554
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,530
Yeah.
Yeah,

555
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:52,670
100% a drug free.
Uh,

556
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,970
I a Jug free for 37,
38 years.

557
00:23:58,161 --> 00:24:01,260
But I did try,
I did try roids uh,

558
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,710
in 1980 or 81,
I believe it was before it became

559
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:07,710
illegal.
I tried.

560
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,940
What'd you try?
I try and I went to a doctor and I don't

561
00:24:10,941 --> 00:24:13,810
know if I should say this fucker's name
cause he might still be in business,

562
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:16,640
still vying for the same doctor that
Arnold and uh,

563
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,210
uh,
all the guys who were in the magazines,

564
00:24:20,211 --> 00:24:23,570
you know,
I thought everybody was drug free.

565
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:24,990
I didn't think,
you know,

566
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:27,590
I didn't think nobody talks.
It's a weird thing about those

567
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,251
magazines,
right?

568
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:29,084
Yeah,
yeah,

569
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,500
yeah.
Oh fucking man.

570
00:24:33,501 --> 00:24:36,370
I couldn't wait before I get,
some of them are meeting her ass shit,

571
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,213
man.

572
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:40,610
So they got me for sewer.
That's what he was taking about.

573
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,780
Uh,
uh,

574
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:45,140
I want to a couple of little contest and
a guy,

575
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,970
uh,
the guy who was promoting the contest,

576
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:47,870
he came to me and said,
hey,

577
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,850
what are you taking?
Ct and a half,

578
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,460
28 arms,
you know,

579
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,560
then I didn't,
I thought everybody had thought every

580
00:24:54,561 --> 00:24:58,760
fucking by not seen those magazines or
on or anybody else was drug free.

581
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,770
He goes,
what are you taking?

582
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,080
And I told him to me going to ask us and
shit.

583
00:25:03,081 --> 00:25:04,580
And he goes,
Oh man,

584
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,380
what,
what kind of steroids are you taking?

585
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:07,214
I said,
what's that?

586
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:09,740
And he said,
you don't know what a stair radius.

587
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,140
You didn't even know what,
I don't even know what the fuck he was,

588
00:25:12,141 --> 00:25:13,930
man from Canton.

589
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,650
He told me,
you know,

590
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,070
you gotta go to this doctor.
And uh,

591
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,550
and uh,
gave me the address and everything and

592
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,530
he said,
I don't know if I'd say the doctor's

593
00:25:24,531 --> 00:25:26,210
name,
but I still remember.

594
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,493
And,
uh,

595
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:30,950
I went to the dining thing.
Guy Looked at my nose and ears and shit

596
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:33,470
and listen to my lungs and gave me a
prescription for,

597
00:25:33,471 --> 00:25:34,940
uh,
uh,

598
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,700
decker.
Yeah.

599
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:38,860
It gave me a prescription for some
decades to Rovelyn.

600
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,580
And I took it right.
The Kaiser Pharmacy and a pharmacist.

601
00:25:43,581 --> 00:25:44,810
Uh,
I said,

602
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:45,740
you know,
what they see is,

603
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,270
and I said,
yes,

604
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,850
fucking steroids are thinking.
He said,

605
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:50,780
yeah,
it's bad.

606
00:25:50,781 --> 00:25:52,370
You don't need this shit.
You know what?

607
00:25:52,371 --> 00:25:53,240
Look,
I want to give you,

608
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:55,610
try it.
I want to be a professional body

609
00:25:55,611 --> 00:25:56,780
building.
They told me if I want to be a

610
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:59,660
professional and be like Arno and
Franklin Reza Guy,

611
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,330
I gotta take this shit so I want to take
it.

612
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,070
And he gave,
he gave it to me.

613
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:07,670
We are judging me.
You get fifth wheel prescriptive where I

614
00:26:07,671 --> 00:26:10,280
took it home and I take my deck then and
then,

615
00:26:10,281 --> 00:26:14,390
uh,
went back to doctor [inaudible] and he

616
00:26:14,391 --> 00:26:18,200
gave me no picture for testosterone.
So I took Deca and testosterone.

617
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,530
And did you notice a difference?
Fuck yes.

618
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,060
Fuck yes.
I know that the different I got off of

619
00:26:26,061 --> 00:26:26,721
it.
Yeah,

620
00:26:26,721 --> 00:26:28,340
I got off of it,
but I had a,

621
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,230
I had realized I had reasons and you
won't judge Jv with those words.

622
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,430
Sure.
Okay.

623
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:36,230
It worked.
It definitely worked.

624
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:39,160
Uh,
I got fucking hard.

625
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:39,800
It's,
you know,

626
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,190
just tight as fuck.
And uh,

627
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,050
but,
uh,

628
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,540
I also,
uh,

629
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,220
I don't know if it does,
it does this to everyone.

630
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,083
People,
when I told him,

631
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,230
I tell him about this sometimes and know
it's you,

632
00:26:54,231 --> 00:26:56,070
you must've been an ass hole beforehand.

633
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,580
And that's quite,
quite possibly true because I was a

634
00:27:00,581 --> 00:27:03,480
pretty much an asshole because the way I
was raised,

635
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:06,060
you know,
I had a bad attitude going in.

636
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:11,390
So when I got on scene it and it seemed
to amplify my bad attitude and every

637
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,630
matter a short fuse like this is a
fighter.

638
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,300
UFC fighting him short shortfuse yeah,
yeah.

639
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:21,000
Well I should have had that nickname way
before.

640
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:24,390
Head hurt me man.
Cause I had fucking short fuse big time

641
00:27:24,391 --> 00:27:26,580
and everything.
Everything pissed me off.

642
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,180
So I had a really bad attitude.
I was married at the time,

643
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:32,730
you know,
I had a real bad attitude and my wife

644
00:27:32,731 --> 00:27:35,520
and she couldn't do shit wrong,
you know,

645
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,000
I mean nothing man and but okay that,
that was part of it.

646
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,080
Another big,
big fucking thing with me is what I love

647
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:51,711
more than muscles and lifting weights
and fast cars and I love all that shit.

648
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:57,990
It's sex and a big giant,
big old giant.

649
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:02,910
Why rolled over to have sex and nothing
was happening.

650
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,590
I said fuck these steroids.
When he got off of them,

651
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,300
he told me,
it was like,

652
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,790
oh you got to take this,
this other shit to make this five dead.

653
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,360
Anything,
Joe,

654
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,830
anything boners
fuck it.

655
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,170
Fuck it.
Oh No,

656
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:24,820
no,
it ain't,

657
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,340
nothing is going to do.
And I'd rather be 110 pounds soaking wet

658
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,290
and still be able to,
you know,

659
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:33,360
get my boner,
uh,

660
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,440
fuck that,
you know,

661
00:28:34,441 --> 00:28:38,340
so there must have the effect of you're
lifting too because what comes is just a

662
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,980
giant dip and your natural testosterone
when she get off of it.

663
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,060
Oh.
Oh,

664
00:28:43,170 --> 00:28:44,003
it's bad.
Huh?

665
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:48,240
It was the,
because I,

666
00:28:48,241 --> 00:28:49,170
you know,
I decided,

667
00:28:49,171 --> 00:28:49,830
hey,
I'm out.

668
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,430
Fuck this shit.
Fuck this shit what you want for a total

669
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,790
of six months.
But what they do is they told us back

670
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,890
then you do two months on,
two months off.

671
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,870
So it took longer.
So I do two months,

672
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,130
it'll take two months off,
two months on two months.

673
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,790
That was the protocol.
Yeah,

674
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,070
that's,
that's what they told us.

675
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:08,760
That's what doctor man,
man,

676
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,200
whatever his name is,
uh,

677
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,260
talks how to do.
So it was told six months,

678
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:16,020
but it took longer than,
because they had two months off in

679
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:17,790
between two months.
And,

680
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,490
um,
uh,

681
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,250
that stuff it fucking definitely,
definitely.

682
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,790
Uh,
w what they don't tell you is when you

683
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:30,270
stop taking it and shit and we just
stopped taking it cold Turkey like that

684
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,310
every fucking thing that you gained
during that time.

685
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,640
And I gained,
you know,

686
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,010
I was ready for,
I had one like little small,

687
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,030
the Boone County,
cause I thought I was ready for fucking

688
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:45,430
Mister America after this shit.
You know,

689
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:49,510
I'm like Oh fuck I'm,
I just got so much tighter and I had a

690
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,660
more veins and shit than ever and I'm
like,

691
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,360
Oh man,
this is great shit.

692
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:58,240
But when you get off they see everything
that you came,

693
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,990
you lose it.
And then some I lost any strength gains

694
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:06,520
that I might've might've gang got from
it or any,

695
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:07,600
you know,
the harness at me.

696
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,690
I had to start from lower than where I
was before I started taking it.

697
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:20,290
They say you do gain something and you
keep something once your body

698
00:30:20,291 --> 00:30:21,790
normalizes,
you know,

699
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:24,790
you do have some sort of gains.
That's one of the arguments that they

700
00:30:24,791 --> 00:30:28,870
say about people that have taken
steroids and gotten off of them,

701
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,210
that if you can normalize your
testosterone,

702
00:30:31,211 --> 00:30:33,340
you're still gonna have an advantage of
where people that have never taken it

703
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:34,174
before.

704
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,270
Genuine.
I don't know how true that is.

705
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,630
I felt like that,
uh,

706
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,240
uh,
every single thing game than I possibly

707
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,170
can.
I think I,

708
00:30:44,171 --> 00:30:48,240
I mean I felt like I lost ground
actually.

709
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,360
Uh,
cause I just stopped cold Turkey and I

710
00:30:51,361 --> 00:30:54,680
think I actually lost Brown.
It's still supposed to wean yourself off

711
00:30:54,681 --> 00:30:56,270
and stuff.
But,

712
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,220
you know,
but I'm telling me when I roll over,

713
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,260
you know,
I'm fucking 21 years old and I thought

714
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,680
that sex every day was the normal.
Right.

715
00:31:07,681 --> 00:31:08,920
I mean you,
you,

716
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,060
you just,
that's what you get married for sex

717
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:12,901
every day,
man.

718
00:31:12,901 --> 00:31:14,640
That's one of the benefits.
And if I don't,

719
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,330
if I can't have sex every day,
then you know something's wrong.

720
00:31:18,331 --> 00:31:18,610
Right?
Yeah.

721
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,500
Like this,
you know,

722
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:22,650
so I just,
that was my normal normal thing.

723
00:31:22,651 --> 00:31:24,550
And I'm probably pretty sure that my
wife,

724
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,310
who at the time probably didn't think
that,

725
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:28,300
but I was like,
she's probably got tired.

726
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,320
We this motherfucker that was a,
she had a break when the steroid things,

727
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,970
we got a little break for the first time
ever,

728
00:31:35,971 --> 00:31:37,650
you know who was married.
Like you know,

729
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:38,461
like,
oh no,

730
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:38,941
no,
no,

731
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:40,730
no.
Anything that's going to fuck with that.

732
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,210
But that's what gets people back on it a
lot.

733
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,000
Yeah.
You couldn't get psychologically

734
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:47,190
addicted,
of course.

735
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,120
I mean,
uh,

736
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,380
who,
I mean,

737
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:50,250
you,
you,

738
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:53,400
you,
Jack and I talked about it,

739
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,540
you know,
and I was,

740
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,960
I was interviewed and magazine articles
and stuff a few times when I was world

741
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:03,270
champion back Lena.
I brought it up in the Arctic cause I

742
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,580
never thought it was anything that high,
you know,

743
00:32:05,581 --> 00:32:06,690
or anything like that.
I said,

744
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:07,524
yeah,
you know,

745
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:11,910
I,
I wish that I had never done it.

746
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:14,420
I wish I could say now we got it from
the were saying,

747
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:17,520
I can say I have,
I have a perfectly clean record.

748
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,810
Like my,
my training partner,

749
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,770
Richard Sherman,
were for 20.

750
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,100
We've trained together for 20 years.
And this guy,

751
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,920
perfect record,
never even tried it.

752
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,120
Well,
he was stronger than me.

753
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,520
He was,
his mind was stronger than my eye.

754
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:34,200
Peer pressure and wanting to be in the
magazines and wanting to make a living,

755
00:32:34,201 --> 00:32:37,350
doing something that I love is did a
punch in the clock every fucking day.

756
00:32:37,351 --> 00:32:42,290
That that appeal too great for me as a
young guy for me to pass it up.

757
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:47,240
I wanted to do something that I love and
make money at it way back then.

758
00:32:47,241 --> 00:32:50,510
But I wind up working at the Post Office
for 28 years.

759
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:51,821
Well,
it makes sense.

760
00:32:51,821 --> 00:32:52,300
I mean,
it,

761
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,850
it definitely makes sense that the
appeal would be so strong.

762
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:57,580
And so it's a very,
it works.

763
00:32:57,581 --> 00:32:59,740
I mean,
that's the big reason why people want to

764
00:32:59,741 --> 00:33:02,350
take it out of sports.
And I don't know if he ever watched that

765
00:33:02,351 --> 00:33:04,450
documentary that's on Netflix called
ICARUS.

766
00:33:04,451 --> 00:33:05,680
Have you seen that?
No,

767
00:33:05,681 --> 00:33:08,650
I haven't seen incremental.
ICARES is all about the Russian,

768
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,230
uh,
anti-doping state sponsored program.

769
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,370
The Russian,
well,

770
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:14,290
I should say pro doping.
Oh,

771
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,500
Yay.
You go ahead early.

772
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:17,560
Give steroids to every single one of
their athletes.

773
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,010
It's a crazy documentary man because the
guy,

774
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:23,350
Bryan Fogel,
who's the director is also,

775
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,470
he's in it because he was an amateur
cyclist and what he wanted to do as an

776
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:30,400
experiment.
So he ran it or he cycled this race one

777
00:33:30,401 --> 00:33:31,780
year,
totally clean,

778
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,590
and then the next year he went to this
Russian doctrine,

779
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,450
said just fucking juice me up to the
gills.

780
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,940
Like let's do this.
And they just shot him up with

781
00:33:39,941 --> 00:33:42,550
everything.
And in the process of him getting to

782
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:47,200
know this doctor,
the scandal broke out about the Sochi

783
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,530
Olympics,
about the Russians cheated during the

784
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,840
Sochi Olympics.
And it's all documented in this film as

785
00:33:52,841 --> 00:33:55,540
the news is breaking.
And then the guy who's the Russian

786
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:58,690
doctor has to flee Russia.
He leaves his family behind,

787
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:02,020
they take his family's house and they
take all their money and they're

788
00:34:02,021 --> 00:34:05,170
basically making this family homeless to
try to get him to come back to Russia.

789
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,750
He's in protective custody and America
right now.

790
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,810
And he detailed the entire program.
Everyone was hot.

791
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,180
Everyone,
everyone was on something.

792
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,220
They want 13 g.
What's hilarious?

793
00:34:15,221 --> 00:34:18,550
They just took some of the metals away
and the metals they took with the most

794
00:34:18,551 --> 00:34:23,551
bullshit metals like gymnastics who can
have this one.

795
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,760
Like they took like four bullshit metals
away,

796
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,070
but they kept the big real,
yeah.

797
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:32,140
They kept wrestling.
They kept all the big ones.

798
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:35,510
It's bullshit.
Indeed.

799
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,240
I did see big,
strong fast.

800
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,500
Um,
uh,

801
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,470
that's crazy.
They take yeah.

802
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,110
Right.
Because they're pro steroids.

803
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:44,940
Right,
right.

804
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,750
Yeah.
That is interesting.

805
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,950
Yeah.
Pro Steroids and a lot of people are,

806
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:51,850
yeah.
Well the,

807
00:34:51,851 --> 00:34:53,560
the argument is,
I mean,

808
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:53,921
uh,
see,

809
00:34:53,921 --> 00:34:56,440
I see it in the terms of fair
competition.

810
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,080
I see the argument against it for fair
competition.

811
00:34:59,081 --> 00:35:00,490
That makes sense.
But like,

812
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,250
I also see the argument in terms of
like,

813
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:07,810
if you're going to be taken amino acids
and creatine and all these different

814
00:35:07,811 --> 00:35:10,750
things that do give you some sort of a
benefit,

815
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,060
why don't I take the shit that gives you
the real benefit?

816
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,531
Well,
I,

817
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:15,410
you know,
uh,

818
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,200
I,
uh,

819
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,100
I,
I don't find a fault with people who

820
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:25,630
would be side too to take roids because
like I said,

821
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,340
I'm 21 year old kid and uh,
I took,

822
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,490
so how the fuck can I talk shit about
anybody who's,

823
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:36,970
who decides to make the same decision
that I,

824
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,640
that many years ago,
you know,

825
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:43,350
I,
I be a hypocrite asshole if I was,

826
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:47,010
you know,
to do that as long as everybody in the

827
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:50,700
competition that you're in,
whatever that competition might be,

828
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:53,370
if you fucking flipping pies or
whatever,

829
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,880
whatever the fuck it is,
a tech and grab whatever fuck it is.

830
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,550
If everybody else is doing it then,
then it's a level playing field that,

831
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:05,940
but when you got guys that are trying to
compete naturally,

832
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,000
right against guys that are not,
then it becomes unfair.

833
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:09,810
So,
uh,

834
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:10,950
if they,
uh,

835
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,180
if they have a division and they do it
in a lot in these weight lifting contest

836
00:36:15,181 --> 00:36:17,160
and things,
now they have divisions that are called

837
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:21,240
natural divisions and they actually test
for steroids and stuff like that.

838
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,980
And maybe they should do something like
that for the fighters to,

839
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,610
hey,
we ain't going to text you guys if you

840
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:29,340
want fuckers.
He just come on in here and whatever you

841
00:36:29,341 --> 00:36:30,174
bring,
bring,

842
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:31,750
bring what you got.
Yeah,

843
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:34,190
we're kind of doing that in Japan.
Really?

844
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,240
Yeah.
Japan has an organization called

845
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,510
[inaudible] where it's essentially an
offshoot of pride or at least some of

846
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:42,970
the people are involved.
It that were involved in pride and

847
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:45,260
pride.
Like I had ensign anyway on the podcast

848
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:46,690
and he was talking about his pride
contract.

849
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:49,900
He said,
it's specifically stated we will not

850
00:36:49,901 --> 00:36:53,170
test you for steroids in all caps and
shit.

851
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,370
Some fucking animals.
I was it a lot of ways and a lot of

852
00:37:00,371 --> 00:37:03,010
people's eyes.
That was the golden age of MMA.

853
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,770
He's just in terms of just sheer
performance.

854
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:08,620
Oh man,
you gotta wonder like all those guys

855
00:37:08,621 --> 00:37:11,290
like fader and Cro cop and all those
guys in their prime,

856
00:37:11,291 --> 00:37:13,330
like how much shit were they on?
Were they on things?

857
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,860
I mean,
nobody wants to talk about it.

858
00:37:14,861 --> 00:37:14,960
Yeah,

859
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,490
that's in the Goddamn in the contract.
I was just back then,

860
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,420
you know,
maybe they

861
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,260
possibly we're for half.
And then you know,

862
00:37:23,261 --> 00:37:25,660
when people want to say it like fate or
who most people think is like the

863
00:37:25,661 --> 00:37:28,480
greatest heavyweight of all time,
or at least it's an argument,

864
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,710
right?
He,

865
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,790
he was real good friends with Putin who
is at the head of the Russian doping

866
00:37:35,951 --> 00:37:38,920
state sponsored doping program.
Like what are the odds that they just

867
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:41,710
let him compete clean?
Like what are the odds that didn't juice

868
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:43,810
them up,
but they're not testing you?

869
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:44,950
I,
you know,

870
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,810
I don't know.
I don't know.

871
00:37:46,811 --> 00:37:49,120
I don't know.
He didn't have a steroid by it though.

872
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:50,350
Well,
you say that,

873
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,970
but in the early days,
he sure as fuck did.

874
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,651
Really?
Yeah.

875
00:37:52,651 --> 00:37:57,280
And you pull up that picture of a,
of a fade or with the kettle bells was a

876
00:37:57,281 --> 00:38:00,970
famous picture of him.
He was a big proponent of,

877
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,740
I mean,
he didn't lift weights per se.

878
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,260
He did like Kettlebell exercises,
which are weight,

879
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:06,491
not like,
you know,

880
00:38:06,491 --> 00:38:07,370
bench press.
Right.

881
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,790
That kind of shit and curls.
He did a lot of,

882
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:11,850
um,
pliers and a lot of,

883
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:12,910
uh,
explosive,

884
00:38:12,911 --> 00:38:15,460
uh,
strength training exercises and things

885
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,270
on that.
But this,

886
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,400
when you still get this picture,
like he was pretty fucking jacked

887
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,290
anyway.
We definitely knock your fucking head.

888
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,520
Oh,
he's an animal.

889
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,500
Looks like a power with,
yeah,

890
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,960
exactly.
He was built and then there's early

891
00:38:25,961 --> 00:38:28,690
fights.
He was very built and then later in his

892
00:38:28,691 --> 00:38:32,410
career there's was a lot of things going
on later in his career.

893
00:38:32,411 --> 00:38:34,420
But it seems like when he came to
America,

894
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,460
one of the first he did,
if I,

895
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:39,790
if he was ever on anything before,
he wasn't on it when he came to America

896
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:43,690
because it looks like you also stopped
weight training and only concentrated on

897
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:47,440
sports specific exercises,
which a lot of people disagree with.

898
00:38:47,441 --> 00:38:50,560
Some people say that you have to have
some kind of weight training,

899
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,680
you have to have some sort of strength
and conditioning program.

900
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:55,170
Right.
I W I w you know,

901
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,470
of course I'm from that background,
I would say yes.

902
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:00,600
Yeah,
I would agree with that.

903
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,040
I think so too.
I think you need both.

904
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,890
Um,
and I think you certainly need skill.

905
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,830
That's the most important thing.
But in order to really highlight that

906
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:10,660
skill,
you've got to have that body up to full

907
00:39:10,661 --> 00:39:12,570
potential.
You gotta be peaking.

908
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:14,770
You gotta be ready to rock and roll my
boy man,

909
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:19,490
Maitri Maitri own mountain or those.
Yeah,

910
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:22,240
that's a huge feather in his cap.
And it's my buddy.

911
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,370
I love that guy.
He's hilarious.

912
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,273
Funny,
funny,

913
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,743
funny dude.

914
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,620
You gather and you got to know him even
better.

915
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,180
And we had been talking and shit.
And I get to talk to a lot of a lot of

916
00:39:36,181 --> 00:39:36,961
fighters.
Man.

917
00:39:36,961 --> 00:39:39,300
I really,
when you're an inspirational dude,

918
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,610
you know people like you.
Yeah.

919
00:39:41,611 --> 00:39:43,190
You know I'm just blessed man.
I,

920
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,740
I tell you what do I have no idea why
that you know,

921
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,170
the first video I did for you to the
strong man ain't never heard of.

922
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,180
I don't know why people watched it.

923
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,350
I'll tell you why.
Cause cause it's fuel.

924
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,940
Everybody who wants to do something in
their life has ups and downs and we need

925
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:03,350
fuel.
Like,

926
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,300
I'll tell you,
I got some fuel today.

927
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:09,650
When you were in front of those kids and
Compton and you were talking to them

928
00:40:09,651 --> 00:40:13,310
about obsession being a good thing.
If you want to be great at anything,

929
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,580
I wanted to shut that fucking tv off and
go run the hill.

930
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:20,750
Man.
Fuel like that is important for people.

931
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:24,590
Like seeing someone like you get fired
up and talk about things.

932
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,900
It energizes the people that are
watching.

933
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:29,630
Like every time he put out one of those
youtube videos and a million people

934
00:40:29,631 --> 00:40:33,020
watch it.
How many of those million people engaged

935
00:40:33,021 --> 00:40:35,450
in an activity that maybe they weren't
gonna do that day?

936
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,850
How many of them went to the gym when
they weren't going to go to the gym?

937
00:40:37,851 --> 00:40:41,030
How many of them just decided to get
their fucking career in order to get

938
00:40:41,031 --> 00:40:44,240
their life in order to just get their
shit together when they maybe weren't

939
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:45,680
like,
we need each other.

940
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,200
People need each other.
Yeah,

941
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:50,210
in a weird way.
Then people need people like you.

942
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,760
You know what's the reason why I
surprised with drugs?

943
00:40:53,761 --> 00:40:58,020
Because I told him right in the video,
if you don't like what I'm saying,

944
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:59,880
turned to my fuck off.
Perfect.

945
00:40:59,970 --> 00:41:01,620
You don't fucking,
I don't care.

946
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:03,270
Look,
I didn't even,

947
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,090
I didn't know that they paid you.
You know,

948
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:10,470
they do too.
And I was broke as fuck.

949
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,080
Anyway,
I was walking back and forth to the gym

950
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:14,440
to train people.
I didn't happen.

951
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:18,840
I was a horrible personal trainer.
People would come,

952
00:41:18,841 --> 00:41:19,800
you know,
uh,

953
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,910
I,
first of all,

954
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,710
I went to try and get a job as a
personal trainer,

955
00:41:22,711 --> 00:41:26,070
a lot of different gyms.
And they would ask me if I had my

956
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,020
certificate and I said,
look,

957
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,470
I'm a six time world champion.
I don't need a fucking certificate.

958
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,020
I know how to lift weights.
And they'd,

959
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:35,030
Oh yes,
you do my fucking,

960
00:41:35,031 --> 00:41:37,380
if you don't got this certificate,
get on.

961
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,140
You know,
I would leave on my little,

962
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,610
my little plaques and Shit under my arm,
you know,

963
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:46,340
and I got,
I got turned down a bunch of time and

964
00:41:46,341 --> 00:41:48,610
they finally,
I went to a hardcore gym and say,

965
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,060
Hey,
you ct Fletcher.

966
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:51,110
Yeah,
yeah man.

967
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,270
Hey,
we know,

968
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:55,530
you know I had to go to,
but I went to these changing,

969
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,050
so when who turned me down?
Fuck it.

970
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:00,830
Yeah.
Oh No.

971
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,890
And I had,
I was the right side of the harbor first

972
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,650
shitty breaking those pictures.
Oh my God.

973
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:08,150
They come in and they'd say,
Hey,

974
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,220
at one session,
one session,

975
00:42:10,221 --> 00:42:14,060
they pay me for a month,
but they trade one time with me and

976
00:42:14,061 --> 00:42:14,550
they're like,
hey,

977
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:17,750
no,
hey if you no pussy,

978
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:21,740
fuck pussy out that fucking fast.
Take your fucking ass back home.

979
00:42:21,741 --> 00:42:23,330
Here's your money.
Take your fucking money.

980
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,790
And I needed that fucking money to Joe.

981
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:27,140
I needed it.
Bad Man.

982
00:42:27,141 --> 00:42:28,700
Like I said,
I was walking,

983
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,950
uh,
cause when I had my heart can you,

984
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:34,900
I used up all my sick leave and stuff.
I working at the post doc,

985
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:37,490
I can use it for all the sick leave and,
and uh,

986
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,340
they let me go.
They let me go from it and he thinks you

987
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:42,840
can't get let go from a government job
is bullshit.

988
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:43,870
The Kid,
I'm gonna live in exams.

989
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:46,190
So they let you go because you're sick.
Well,

990
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:48,860
I used up all my sick leave and
everything.

991
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:53,320
I had a rough recovery.
The recovery was rubbed.

992
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:54,980
So I,
I stayed out too long.

993
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:57,530
They gave me so much and I stayed out
too long.

994
00:42:57,531 --> 00:43:00,470
My son sick,
sick week was all worn out in it and

995
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,900
they actually let me go.
Uh,

996
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,590
but before he let me go,
they granted me a full,

997
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:07,630
you know,
um,

998
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:09,130
health,
uh,

999
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,973
health related.

1000
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,600
Um,
they gave it to me.

1001
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,320
So for a year and yeah,
everything for a year and then

1002
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,200
unexplained to be the same doctor who
granted it to me,

1003
00:43:18,201 --> 00:43:20,540
which was their doctor,
took it away a year later.

1004
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,500
So a year later broke as fuck,
I don't got no time and I've got no

1005
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,870
benefits after working for 28 years
there.

1006
00:43:26,871 --> 00:43:28,970
I don't got no kind of retirement,
no nothing.

1007
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,030
So I'm walking around,
that's what I'm trying to get a personal

1008
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:34,070
training job and walked around town and
get person training.

1009
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,913
I mean,
they find me,

1010
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:39,450
gave me one at a hardcore gym and gave
me a,

1011
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,330
uh,
a personal training job.

1012
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,240
And then like I said,
I didn't have very many clients at all.

1013
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,780
The guys that had called the original
iron addicts.

1014
00:43:46,781 --> 00:43:49,370
So the guys that stuck with me and uh,
you know,

1015
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:51,440
even I put him through hell,
they liked it.

1016
00:43:51,441 --> 00:43:52,670
They come back for more.
They can,

1017
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,640
those are the guys that I call the
original iron addicts.

1018
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,590
Yeah.
There's some people that are just not

1019
00:43:57,591 --> 00:43:59,330
going to have the mental fortitude for
that.

1020
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,440
But you are,
you're,

1021
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:04,400
that's like for someone starting out.
It's kind of crazy.

1022
00:44:04,401 --> 00:44:05,230
Tony.
You,

1023
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:06,021
yeah,
yeah.

1024
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:07,550
No,
I'm definitely not for the,

1025
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,320
again,
you know the average guy.

1026
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,161
No,
no,

1027
00:44:10,161 --> 00:44:10,521
no,
no,

1028
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:10,930
no,
you didn't.

1029
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:11,420
I mean,
and

1030
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,570
what you were saying to those kids is
very important.

1031
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:19,370
Like there's a difference between the
kind of effort and focus that you want

1032
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:22,910
to put in in order to get yourself fit.
I just want to be in good shape.

1033
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:27,170
I just want to be able to do 10 pushups
and 10 chin ups and normal shit.

1034
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,470
There's a difference between that person
and the type of person that's going to

1035
00:44:30,471 --> 00:44:32,320
seek out excellence.
It's,

1036
00:44:32,321 --> 00:44:34,810
that person's going to go to a guy like
you and go,

1037
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:40,070
I just want every day to give 100% I
want to drain myself on that bench.

1038
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,750
I want to drain myself at that squat
rack.

1039
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,370
I want to have nothing left when I leave
here.

1040
00:44:44,371 --> 00:44:46,470
Can you do that?
Most people,

1041
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,630
most people know it.
Sounds good.

1042
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,980
Fuck that.
After like three weeks of that fucking

1043
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,170
joints,
her aiken and your,

1044
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:54,750
your body's

1045
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,200
falling apart.
No.

1046
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,470
Fuck.
You see them keep the money.

1047
00:44:58,471 --> 00:45:01,650
Me and sometimes,
I mean it would show at once and I

1048
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:03,750
didn't see him no more.
No explanation.

1049
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,100
No.
They need even say one person told me to

1050
00:45:06,101 --> 00:45:07,770
go into the bathroom.
I never seen him no more.

1051
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,580
I'm going to bathroom fucking coming
back.

1052
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,590
Did you get a lot of injuries when you
were training?

1053
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,870
Um,
no.

1054
00:45:15,871 --> 00:45:18,780
I was lucky in the,
in that,

1055
00:45:18,781 --> 00:45:22,440
you know,
my first career as a power lifter,

1056
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:26,760
I didn't get injured and ever had any
injuries and I didn't,

1057
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:29,060
you know,
wrap up or really,

1058
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:32,880
really crazy.
I had a cracked bones.

1059
00:45:32,881 --> 00:45:37,050
My bones are really strong and tendons,
no shoulder problems,

1060
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,670
shoulder problems.
Wow.

1061
00:45:38,671 --> 00:45:42,240
That's an even Dorian that Dorian Yates
is all fucked up now.

1062
00:45:42,241 --> 00:45:44,770
I had him on the podcast and one of his
arms is just jacked.

1063
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:48,030
He can't do pushups anymore.
It's shoulders all fucked up and all the

1064
00:45:48,031 --> 00:45:50,910
connective tissues torn off the bone and
just,

1065
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:52,703
yeah,

1066
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,280
it's amazing that you don't mean you
must have an excellent genetics in

1067
00:45:58,281 --> 00:45:58,740
tonight.

1068
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,670
Yeah,
that's,

1069
00:45:59,770 --> 00:46:00,820
that's the,
uh,

1070
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,610
that's what I created to,
exactly.

1071
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,700
It's just to do genetics.
Uh,

1072
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,760
you know,
as much as my dad,

1073
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,870
I don't,
I hated them growing up.

1074
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:16,000
I got a credit buddy fletcher for that
man I hated to do growing up.

1075
00:46:16,001 --> 00:46:16,830
John.
Really good.

1076
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,690
That was a big part of your documentary,
man.

1077
00:46:18,691 --> 00:46:19,860
That was intense.
You know,

1078
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:21,240
when you,
uh,

1079
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,910
were told that story about getting a gun
because a,

1080
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:28,050
you were supposed to go and apologize to
the teacher because you had said

1081
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,070
something to teacher.
You're like,

1082
00:46:29,071 --> 00:46:32,850
you were disagreeing about evolution and
your father got mad at you and said,

1083
00:46:32,851 --> 00:46:34,380
you're going to go apologize to the
teacher,

1084
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:35,880
but the teacher was sick.
Yeah.

1085
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,760
And you didn't even get a chance to say
no,

1086
00:46:38,761 --> 00:46:40,710
she was sick,
you just said no,

1087
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:45,711
and he broke her nose like that.
That's a heart wrenching story as a

1088
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:46,800
father.

1089
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:47,760
Yeah.
Yeah.

1090
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:51,050
That's buddy fluxes rule right there,
man.

1091
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,990
I mean,
he tell you to do something Goddamn to

1092
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,440
bear to do.
Yeah.

1093
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,660
So when I,
when I went there after,

1094
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,100
you know,
growing up like that,

1095
00:46:58,101 --> 00:46:59,000
I was,
uh,

1096
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,160
I grew up,
uh,

1097
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,440
in fear.
Yeah.

1098
00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:04,730
I was afraid of my dad all the time.
And uh,

1099
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:08,870
but growing up with in the buddy
Fletcher's household when I went into

1100
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:11,990
the military was a piece of cake.
I was used to it.

1101
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,360
I was already used to guest sir.
No Sir.

1102
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:18,620
Standing at attention and saluted and
shit and doing impossible shit or

1103
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:21,170
whatever you asked me to fucking do.
I was already used to it.

1104
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,060
So the army was,
you know,

1105
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,000
ah,
shit already been doing.

1106
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,890
Every guy's crying and shit.
I been doing this my whole fucking life.

1107
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,653
No.

1108
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,550
How did you get on Youtube?
Oh,

1109
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,720
a guy came into the team into the gym,
uh,

1110
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:38,730
and he said that his name was,
arrives,

1111
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,900
Babu,
I got to give a Ross credit for that.

1112
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:45,040
He was a strength project and he had a
big following already on a youtube.

1113
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:45,491
He said,
Hey,

1114
00:47:45,491 --> 00:47:47,930
can I interview you,
uh,

1115
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:49,930
for you to,
I don't know what the fuck is you to?

1116
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,380
And he said,
uh,

1117
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,890
well,
it's just a social media thing.

1118
00:47:53,891 --> 00:47:54,391
And I,
I'm,

1119
00:47:54,391 --> 00:47:55,570
I,
I have one question.

1120
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,370
Can I say whatever the fuck I want to
say?

1121
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,481
And he said,
yeah,

1122
00:47:58,481 --> 00:47:59,860
you can say whatever the fuck you want.
I said,

1123
00:47:59,861 --> 00:48:01,810
can I cuss and say yes,
cuts all you want to.

1124
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:02,441
I said,
fuck it.

1125
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:03,274
It's,
um,

1126
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,790
that's cool.
Yeah,

1127
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:06,600
Guy,
man.

1128
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,760
It,
think about how that works.

1129
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:13,470
I like one thing leads to all these
other things like that guy coming in and

1130
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:17,040
talking to you,
led to you inspiring countless millions

1131
00:48:17,041 --> 00:48:17,874
of people.
Yeah.

1132
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,760
Crazy.
It is absolutely crazy.

1133
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:25,270
I never thought,
I never thought in a million years,

1134
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:27,490
you know,
that something like that would happen.

1135
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:28,380
I never did.
You know,

1136
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:31,780
I always wanted as a kid.
It's funny,

1137
00:48:31,781 --> 00:48:33,360
I want it to,
uh,

1138
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:36,010
inspire people because my dad was a
preacher.

1139
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,770
He was a Korean War vet,
uh,

1140
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:40,780
and a preacher.
So,

1141
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:44,080
uh,
I grew up soup in a super religious

1142
00:48:44,081 --> 00:48:45,580
household,
super religious,

1143
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:49,630
everything was the same.
Every fucking thing was the scenes or

1144
00:48:49,631 --> 00:48:50,680
you couldn't do shit,
you know,

1145
00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:52,990
dating girls.
I was saying going to the movies,

1146
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,910
ever seen,
listen to whatever kind of music that

1147
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,720
wasn't gospel music.
It was a sin.

1148
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,200
I think I'm telling you it was,
everything was a fucking saying.

1149
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:04,060
So,
uh,

1150
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:08,290
but you know,
Buddy Fletcher is,

1151
00:49:08,291 --> 00:49:09,820
you know,
I recently,

1152
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:11,950
since this last heart attack,
I recently went to him,

1153
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:17,170
I was waiting for 58 years to hear an
apology from him that was never going to

1154
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:20,450
come and eat meat up,
toast,

1155
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,380
tearing me to fucking pieces,
man.

1156
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:24,860
Because I would,
you know,

1157
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,050
being an old dude,
I would wake up at night punching and

1158
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:33,940
kicking and shit and I'm still fighting
buddy fletcher at 56,

1159
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:37,660
57 years old.
I'm still fighting this dude cause I'm

1160
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:41,380
still carried around this hate.
I hated him,

1161
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,360
but it was okay cause the hate was
neutral.

1162
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,850
I don't think I just hated him.
He didn't hate me.

1163
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,780
He told me he got what?
He got up in church and he made an

1164
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:50,770
announcement.
He said,

1165
00:49:50,771 --> 00:49:53,260
hey look,
I know what it is.

1166
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,930
Um,
between that sign,

1167
00:49:55,931 --> 00:49:59,290
which was me and pointed me that,
that sign right there and he,

1168
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:00,560
I can get on with the rest of,
you know,

1169
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:01,450
my other brothers.
No,

1170
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,840
no problem buddy.
He hated me and he says,

1171
00:50:03,841 --> 00:50:06,790
because he's so much like me.
That's why I hate him.

1172
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,190
And went to know that.
That's why we can't get along.

1173
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:11,890
I hate you because you're so much like
me.

1174
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:13,030
She's,
yeah.

1175
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:14,560
So I was like,
Hey,

1176
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:16,150
no problem.
I hate your ass too.

1177
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,690
She has never worked it out.
Oh yes we did.

1178
00:50:19,691 --> 00:50:21,100
We did.
But it was,

1179
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:23,230
uh,
have you seen the movie?

1180
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,960
I hadn't had,
it wasn't worked out during the movie.

1181
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,010
I still didn't like him during

1182
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:29,620
the movies.
They asked him,

1183
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,400
they asked him why.
Do you have any recollections of,

1184
00:50:34,401 --> 00:50:37,460
when you see t growing up,
when his childhood,

1185
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,920
do you have any fond recollections of
you and cte?

1186
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,190
You know,
as a kid and out boy,

1187
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,680
I was looking at them jobs waiting now
where I really,

1188
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:49,500
I really want to hear if he was going to
fabricate something right?

1189
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:51,410
Because I didn't have man.
And I'm like,

1190
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,860
oh,
I want to be with this motherfucker

1191
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,180
going to say to this questionnaire and
he didn't have anything.

1192
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:57,620
And I was like,
okay,

1193
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:58,543
cool.
You know,

1194
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:03,500
but I was ready to stop the fucking
movie and just make an ass out of

1195
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:04,670
myself.
And like,

1196
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:05,090
no,
you're,

1197
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:07,730
that's bull shit.
We ain't got you ain't one fucking time

1198
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,680
that we ever did anything pleasurable
together.

1199
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,690
Motherfucker.
And I was ready to go off,

1200
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,040
but he didn't have any.

1201
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,810
So when he didn't have any fines,
okay.

1202
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,660
Now that's the same recollection that I
have,

1203
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,890
but I really didn't forgive him until
his last heart attack in June.

1204
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,880
And what happened then when I had the
heart attack in June and it seemed like,

1205
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,113
uh,
uh,

1206
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,680
a revelation came to me and he was like,
I'm,

1207
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:34,520
it's not hurting him.
It's not hurting him at all.

1208
00:51:34,521 --> 00:51:37,430
My Dad is 86 years old.
He's fine,

1209
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:38,021
man.
He,

1210
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:38,621
he's,
he's,

1211
00:51:38,621 --> 00:51:39,470
he's good.
I don't,

1212
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:40,461
he's like,
well,

1213
00:51:40,461 --> 00:51:42,800
you know,
I don't think he thinks that he has

1214
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:45,920
anything to be sorry for that.
I think he thinks he's,

1215
00:51:45,921 --> 00:51:49,400
he's done a fantastic job of raising me.
And uh,

1216
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,010
I was just waiting on a policy that was
never going to come,

1217
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,220
but,
but it was still that hate that I had

1218
00:51:55,221 --> 00:51:59,150
for him was eating me up.
I had to get that burden off me and I

1219
00:51:59,151 --> 00:52:02,690
think having that last harder,
I didn't want to die carrying that

1220
00:52:02,691 --> 00:52:04,670
burden with me of hating my dad.

1221
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:08,480
So I went to my dad and I asked him to
forgive me.

1222
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:10,580
Whoa.
Yeah.

1223
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,100
Damn.
Yeah.

1224
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,750
How did you say that?
What did you,

1225
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,130
what did you say?
I said,

1226
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:17,010
you know,
looked at,

1227
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:20,060
I have blamed you.
I told him that I had recently had a

1228
00:52:20,061 --> 00:52:24,470
heart attack and I have blamed you my
entire life for a whole lot of things

1229
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,330
that went bad or when you know that
always,

1230
00:52:27,390 --> 00:52:28,870
you know,
blames you fix and,

1231
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:31,550
and I'm sorry.
Uh,

1232
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:32,750
you know,
I don't,

1233
00:52:32,751 --> 00:52:34,370
you know,
I don't want to blame me for that

1234
00:52:34,371 --> 00:52:38,300
anymore.
And would you please forgive me for

1235
00:52:38,301 --> 00:52:40,430
carrying this against you from,
you know,

1236
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:42,620
my whole life.
I don't want to die,

1237
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,960
you know,
letting you think that,

1238
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:46,490
you know,
I love you man,

1239
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,860
and I want you to know that.
Wow.

1240
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:52,100
Yeah.
How good does that feel?

1241
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,580
I can't,
I don't wake up punching and shit

1242
00:52:55,581 --> 00:52:57,680
anymore.
I probably be out of breath if I did it

1243
00:52:57,681 --> 00:53:00,380
anyway,
but I don't wake up with those night.

1244
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,600
Why haven't had that nightmare since
then?

1245
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:03,890
Wow.
Yeah.

1246
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:05,700
How did he react to that?
He was,

1247
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:10,720
he was a fully accepting of my ipod.
He graced me or he was graciously

1248
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:13,160
accepted.
My apology.

1249
00:53:13,161 --> 00:53:15,080
So,
so do you communicate regularly?

1250
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:15,914
No.
No,

1251
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:16,761
no.
Still don't.

1252
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:20,030
Still don't communicate regularly.
I just really wanted to,

1253
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,290
uh,
you know,

1254
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:23,330
get that off my chest.
Released the birds.

1255
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:25,560
Yeah.
I just really wanted to get that off my

1256
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:25,980
chest and

1257
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:28,890
get the release that burden and uh,
you know,

1258
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:30,480
uh,
I probably,

1259
00:53:30,481 --> 00:53:34,080
uh,
try to communicate more after I get this

1260
00:53:34,081 --> 00:53:34,914
new heart.

1261
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:36,110
You know,
it's,

1262
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:38,180
it's Kinda fucked up,
but in a way,

1263
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:41,300
and I don't know why this is,
but sometimes people that have gone

1264
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:44,330
through terrible childhoods,
they wreck.

1265
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:47,300
Recognize what it means to be a good
father.

1266
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,720
Oh No,
I see you with your kids.

1267
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:54,130
I see it in the documentary and I,
and I see how your kids are around you,

1268
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:54,570
right?

1269
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,381
Yeah.
Yeah.

1270
00:53:55,381 --> 00:53:57,360
I think they came and they were like,
shit,

1271
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:59,970
they want to meet Joe Rogan too.
But uh,

1272
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,220
yeah,
I have a super,

1273
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:03,180
super tight.
I made,

1274
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:06,370
you know,
I want to make sure that was,

1275
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:09,030
if somebody asks my kid,
you know,

1276
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,500
uh,
20 years from now,

1277
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,010
what,
do you have any fine memories of your

1278
00:54:14,011 --> 00:54:17,400
dad and your child and how you go?
I want to make sure that they got plenty

1279
00:54:17,401 --> 00:54:19,410
of fucking fine memories.
You know,

1280
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,570
they can say,
you know,

1281
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:24,090
my dad was my dad,
we did this together and my dad was,

1282
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,590
he was loved me to death.
I never had one doubt in my mind.

1283
00:54:28,591 --> 00:54:32,130
My Dad loved the shit out of me.
I don't want my kids grow up,

1284
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,020
you know,
like I get,

1285
00:54:33,030 --> 00:54:35,970
so I put four for extra African.
Makes sure that's,

1286
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,140
you know,
that's not going to happen.

1287
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:42,160
So in some sort of way it turned out to
be positive because you're such a doting

1288
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:43,030
father.
You're so,

1289
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:44,230
you're so into it.
I mean,

1290
00:54:44,231 --> 00:54:47,030
so obvious that it's like you,
the,

1291
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,870
the negative consequences of how your
dad treated you.

1292
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,210
Like it came out of you the opposite
way.

1293
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,660
Yeah.
I made it,

1294
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:57,770
I made it up fucking point man.
Cause this is miserable on their kid.

1295
00:54:57,771 --> 00:54:59,080
But,
but also John,

1296
00:54:59,081 --> 00:55:01,130
you know what good came out of that?
Uh,

1297
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:04,640
the childhood that I,
the kind of time that I went through,

1298
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,620
I get in,
I'm sure what I get is just a 10th of

1299
00:55:09,621 --> 00:55:13,300
what you get,
but it's so many thousand thousand

1300
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,430
people that contact me and tell me,
hey man,

1301
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,600
my dad,
you know,

1302
00:55:17,601 --> 00:55:22,580
I had a fucked up childhood and I,
and I see how you were able to come out

1303
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:25,790
of that or some kids,
kids contact me now that I'm going

1304
00:55:25,791 --> 00:55:30,470
through a fucked up childhood ct and,
and because you made it because you

1305
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:34,730
will.
So that when I looked back and I used to

1306
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,920
think,
why did I have to go through this?

1307
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:40,280
Why did I have to have such a fucked up
time?

1308
00:55:42,050 --> 00:55:46,100
It's because of that,
because I can talk about my childhood

1309
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:50,500
and it helps so many other people,
so many other kids in the go.

1310
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,030
All Joe,
I look back on it now and I said it was

1311
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:55,790
so worth it that it wasn't even finding
me.

1312
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:59,510
It's so worth it.
Everything that I had to go through.

1313
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:03,230
I wanting to hide every time I heard my
dad's keys in the door,

1314
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,340
wanting to just,
you know,

1315
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:07,040
run away from fucking home warranty.
I hated,

1316
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:10,340
hated my child,
but it was so worth it.

1317
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,450
Everything was so worth it.
Just being able to help one kid who

1318
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:18,140
might be going through the same thing,
it's so fucking worth that counted as a

1319
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:19,790
blessing.
It was just the place,

1320
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,450
right?

1321
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,070
That right there,
that attitude.

1322
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,260
This is reason why people attracted to
you because you really do like helping

1323
00:56:26,261 --> 00:56:29,710
people like you really do.
You're happy that you suffered so that

1324
00:56:29,711 --> 00:56:32,350
you can help other people.
That is one of the reasons why people

1325
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:34,330
are so attracted to you.
Wow.

1326
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,040
Yeah,
I guess,

1327
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,350
but after I tell him,
you know,

1328
00:56:38,351 --> 00:56:38,711
hey,
look,

1329
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:43,480
turn me to fuck off.
You're just trying to weed out the weak.

1330
00:56:43,540 --> 00:56:44,800
I mean,
and weed out the payments.

1331
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,810
Not even the week.
It's the people that aren't willing to

1332
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:49,450
take the leap.
Like you can't have any excuses.

1333
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,940
It's like the excuses are a real problem
with people.

1334
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,100
Oh my God,
it's a real problem because you give

1335
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:56,260
yourself a way out,
like you can fail at things,

1336
00:56:56,261 --> 00:56:58,000
so you could try and not be able to do
it,

1337
00:56:58,210 --> 00:57:02,110
but the excuses for why you can't do it
or why you're going to fail or why you

1338
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:05,740
don't feel up to it today or why you're
tired or why you have other things on

1339
00:57:05,741 --> 00:57:06,990
your mind while you have others.

1340
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,420
Things you have to deal with first
before you can start working out.

1341
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,140
That's all bullshit.
Oh yeah.

1342
00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:14,510
And I told him,
yeah,

1343
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:18,190
he did tell them they needed to hear it.
They need to hear that shit.

1344
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:20,410
You need to hear it.
Because they create their own

1345
00:57:20,411 --> 00:57:22,870
boundaries.
They create their own borders to create

1346
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:25,660
their own obstacles.
They create their own things that cannot

1347
00:57:25,661 --> 00:57:26,980
be surpassed,
and they'll,

1348
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:29,200
all those things are just products of
the mind.

1349
00:57:29,201 --> 00:57:32,440
And it's just the ego protecting you
from failure,

1350
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,130
from protecting you from that horrible
feeling that you need to experience in

1351
00:57:36,131 --> 00:57:38,440
order to move forward.
If you want to move forward,

1352
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,960
you got to experience some falls.
You got it slip,

1353
00:57:40,961 --> 00:57:42,400
you got to fall down.
You gotta get back up,

1354
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,890
you got to,
you got to try and fail because if you

1355
00:57:44,891 --> 00:57:46,570
don't fail,
that means you weren't trying hard

1356
00:57:46,571 --> 00:57:49,870
enough because nobody just fucking
excellent in everything all the time.

1357
00:57:49,930 --> 00:57:52,150
All the time.
It's impossible.

1358
00:57:52,330 --> 00:57:54,670
Good person.
That means that one point in your life

1359
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:56,430
you fucked up.
Yeah.

1360
00:57:56,470 --> 00:57:58,150
You figured out how to be a better
person.

1361
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,390
There's no other way around it.
There's no,

1362
00:58:00,391 --> 00:58:02,320
no one's just great from the womb.
No,

1363
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,270
I mean,
unless you're the Dalai Lama or Buddha

1364
00:58:04,271 --> 00:58:06,640
or some shit,
no one is great from the womb at

1365
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:09,080
anything as correct.
It'll be 34 yeah.

1366
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:13,470
Or Buddy fuck being a human being,
an athlete,

1367
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,790
being a whatever,
a doctor or whatever the fuck you are

1368
00:58:15,791 --> 00:58:17,110
trying to do,
you're going to,

1369
00:58:17,111 --> 00:58:20,500
if it's difficult to do,
you're gonna fuck up along the way.

1370
00:58:20,501 --> 00:58:22,450
And some people can't handle the fuck
up.

1371
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,640
They can't handle it.
So they don't even try.

1372
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:26,020
They don't even try it.
They can't,

1373
00:58:26,021 --> 00:58:27,190
they can't.
Oh,

1374
00:58:27,191 --> 00:58:28,890
it's my thyroid.
It's all,

1375
00:58:28,891 --> 00:58:29,321
it's,
you know,

1376
00:58:29,321 --> 00:58:32,500
I just,
I have a problem with my metabolism or

1377
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:33,370
Oh,

1378
00:58:33,371 --> 00:58:33,921

1379
00:58:33,921 --> 00:58:37,530

1380
00:58:37,530 --> 00:58:38,890
It,
it just fucking get up and go.

1381
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,200
Just one foot in front of the other.
Keep moving.

1382
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,150
Just keep moving tomorrow.
Do more.

1383
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,150
Can I get up in the morning?
All the alarm clock.

1384
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,110
That means you get up.
Do you know,

1385
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,590
do you get the fuck up?
No.

1386
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,340
That.
Press that button.

1387
00:58:51,370 --> 00:58:54,280
Get the fuck up and go.
And if you don't have an out,

1388
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,040
if it's impossible to not get the fuck
up and go,

1389
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:00,100
then you just do it.
So just don't allow that other part.

1390
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,840
Don't allow that.
I'm going to hit the snooze button.

1391
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:05,200
Fucking snooze button is the worst shit
that's ever been invented.

1392
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,690
Do you really feel better after nine
minutes?

1393
00:59:07,930 --> 00:59:10,510
That shit doesn't do you any good.
Get up bitch.

1394
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,890
Get up,

Got Goddamn bed you,

1396
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,290

That's one thing.

1397
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:22,490
Here's a,
here's a business view.

1398
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,690
He should do ringtones,
ringtones and,

1399
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:28,310
and alarms.
An alarm,

1400
00:59:28,311 --> 00:59:31,430

it goes instead of beep,

1401
00:59:31,431 --> 00:59:32,001
beep,

1402
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:33,620

I don't,

1404
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:38,980
we hear no excuses.
You know what,

1405
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,960
there's I do something similar to that.
Yeah.

1406
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:46,340
I be cussing people out my whole life
for method and it got this thing,

1407
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:50,150
a book cameo,
iron addicts@bootcamp.com you can find

1408
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:52,240
me on it and the people,
uh,

1409
00:59:52,310 --> 00:59:55,150
pay 25 bucks.
I think I have 35,

1410
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,023
35,

1411
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:57,730
uh,
for me to cut some out.

1412
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,430
Yeah.
So I get on any custom mount for two

1413
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:02,660
minutes,
two minutes straight.

1414
01:00:02,661 --> 01:00:05,690
I cussed him out and tell him you'll
call him all kind of motherfuckers and

1415
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:08,330
shit.
Then I'd been doing my whole life for

1416
01:00:08,331 --> 01:00:09,630
nothing,
you know,

1417
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:14,900
and now you know that people pay me to
do with man and it is wonderful.

1418
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,910
It is wonderful.
Yeah.

1419
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:19,250
Hey Ma,
one guy told me and I want you to cuss

1420
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:21,220
my ex wife out.
Yeah,

1421
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,220
yeah,

1422
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:23,000
no,
exactly.

1423
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,310
Fights.
So I had to let had to let her know

1424
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:26,720
right up front,
hey,

1425
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,520
this is not me saying this.
Yeah.

1426
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,560
Oh yeah,
no,

1427
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:32,394
yeah,
I did.

1428
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,900
I said,
no,

1429
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:34,461
no,
no.

1430
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:37,540
I did it.
Not me seeing if this is great.

1431
01:00:37,541 --> 01:00:39,080
Gregory and Greg,
he said,

1432
01:00:39,081 --> 01:00:44,081
he told me you can leave him the fuck
alone and he is not interested in your

1433
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,870
ugly ass no more.
Stop stalking him,

1434
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,030
bitch.
But this is gregory talking.

1435
01:00:50,031 --> 01:00:53,980
Not Big.
So if you get your gun and shooting,

1436
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:57,620
make sure it was gregory and not buy.
She ever get ahold of you.

1437
01:00:57,680 --> 01:00:58,513
No,
no.

1438
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:05,650
I'm expecting her to book one for Greg
and that's good way to keep the business

1439
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,493
going back.
Yeah.

1440
01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:08,030
Yeah.
We

1441
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:10,560
think that those videos that you do are
very important.

1442
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:11,830
I really do.
You know,

1443
01:01:11,831 --> 01:01:13,830
I just,
I think that inspiration,

1444
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,500
this is like a people for some reason
there's,

1445
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:20,400
there's a bunch of people that like to
mock that stuff.

1446
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,470
They like to,
and most of those people were out of

1447
01:01:22,471 --> 01:01:25,980
shape.
They liked the mock that and they like

1448
01:01:25,981 --> 01:01:29,430
to make fun of it.
And I'm not talking about Comedians I'm

1449
01:01:29,431 --> 01:01:30,091
talking to,
you know,

1450
01:01:30,091 --> 01:01:31,980
which is,
it can be really funny doing that.

1451
01:01:31,981 --> 01:01:35,490
But I'm talking about there's a lot of
people that sincerity,

1452
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:40,790
like for whatever reason bothers them
and sincerity when it comes to

1453
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:43,470
inspiration and motivation and those
kinds of things.

1454
01:01:43,471 --> 01:01:46,050
Like some,
and for some people,

1455
01:01:46,051 --> 01:01:48,780
some people overdo it,
like go to some people's pages and their

1456
01:01:48,781 --> 01:01:50,670
instagram page,
just all bunch of quotes.

1457
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,700
It's all other people saying shit,
it's fine every now and then,

1458
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,340
every now and yeah,
it's like,

1459
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:56,333
it's like your diet.

1460
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:57,240
Yeah.
You know,

1461
01:01:57,241 --> 01:01:58,950
it's okay to eat a piece of cake every
now and then.

1462
01:01:58,990 --> 01:02:02,610
Don't eat cake all day.
You're gonna fucking minor and cake.

1463
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,020
And if you see just nothing but
inspirational memes all day long,

1464
01:02:07,021 --> 01:02:08,560
you like,
this is not working anymore.

1465
01:02:08,561 --> 01:02:11,280
And they don't,
they don't get in too much.

1466
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,450
But a real person,
a real person like you who's already

1467
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:19,290
accomplished a shitload of things,
who understands the benefits,

1468
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:23,400
real hard work and intensity and focus.
When you do those videos,

1469
01:02:23,401 --> 01:02:24,930
man,
I get fired up.

1470
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,450
I get fired the fuck up.
I see those videos.

1471
01:02:27,451 --> 01:02:29,250
And I just want to go to the gym right
away.

1472
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:30,563
Fucking fire.

1473
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:32,260
Let me see.
I didn't even think they were broken.

1474
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:36,830
Knew who the fuck I wish
I knew who you were in once I get upset

1475
01:02:36,831 --> 01:02:40,580
when you were getting mad at me.
Don't even know who the fuck I am.

1476
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,520
No.
People know who the fuck you are man.

1477
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:44,220
I mean how many millions of people have
seen your video?

1478
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,050
Oh maybe one or two.
Yeah.

1479
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,300
You know quite a few people who I've
seen it in weight way more than I ever

1480
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:53,680
thought it would,
that's for sure.

1481
01:02:53,681 --> 01:02:57,100
Cause I mean you go on Youtube and you
tell people they turned me to fuck off.

1482
01:02:57,390 --> 01:02:59,050
I mean people are going to keep
watching.

1484
01:03:00,581 --> 01:03:02,650
I don't give a fuck if you watched me or
not.

1485
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,310
You don't like what the fuck I'm saying

1486
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,330
I mean people are going to keep watching

1492
01:03:24,071 --> 01:03:25,780
over the world.
I'm in the army base.

1493
01:03:25,781 --> 01:03:28,390
I've been to Russia,
Australia,

1494
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,550
Germany,
I've been all over the fucking place.

1495
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:36,340
Fuck you see tv for so many people at
the airport in rush and they all had

1496
01:03:36,341 --> 01:03:38,250
beards.
They all had fake beards are the women

1497
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:40,450
men.
Everything about 120 people met me at

1498
01:03:40,451 --> 01:03:45,451
the airport and he,

1500
01:03:51,701 --> 01:03:56,640
think it was gonna make it out of my
childhood to go to Russia and have all

1501
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:58,730
these people with these beers on can
yard steal.

1502
01:03:58,731 --> 01:04:02,080
Steve motherfucking said,
man,

1503
01:04:02,081 --> 01:04:02,914
Joe,
it's know.

1504
01:04:03,110 --> 01:04:07,030
It's like sometime I think I actually
did down in the operating table and now

1505
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,080
I'm in heaven.
Man,

1506
01:04:08,081 --> 01:04:09,910
I'm just,
this is my heaven.

1507
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,960
You know what I mean?
So it's,

1508
01:04:11,470 --> 01:04:12,730
it's,
it's fantastic.

1509
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,930
It is unbelievable.
And I'm sitting across the fucking tape

1510
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:17,890
of Joe Road.
I'm sitting across the table from ct

1511
01:04:17,891 --> 01:04:19,480
Fletcher and after all he's going to
fucking say,

1512
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,430
oh yeah,
it's this big giant few,

1513
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,570
but you can do,
he'll never,

1514
01:04:22,571 --> 01:04:25,780
you'll never be on everybody who said,
I'd never be on this show.

1515
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:26,614
Fuck yeah.

1516
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,880
Bothered me for a second.
That was never upset at you at all.

1517
01:04:30,030 --> 01:04:33,420
But I could see your point of view and I
could see why you'd be upset at my point

1518
01:04:33,421 --> 01:04:34,140
of view.
I get it.

1519
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:34,990
It didn't bother me.
No,

1520
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:36,990
I don't take things very personally.

1521
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:38,003
No.
You,

1522
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:40,920
you know,
and immediately when he responded to me,

1523
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:42,060
I said,
hey joe,

1524
01:04:42,061 --> 01:04:44,820
you're an absolute we 100% right.
You know,

1525
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:46,830
it was,
I just want,

1526
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:48,960
I really wanted to get your attention,
man,

1527
01:04:48,961 --> 01:04:50,220
more than anything.
I thought,

1528
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,530
uh,
I d I did feel,

1529
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,540
you know,
I felt we had a little difference.

1530
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:58,020
It's in,
it's a slight difference because I agree

1531
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:01,920
with about 90% of what you said.
It's just a slight difference that we

1532
01:05:01,921 --> 01:05:03,610
don't agree on.
And as soon as you say,

1533
01:05:03,611 --> 01:05:04,231
hey man,
you didn't,

1534
01:05:04,231 --> 01:05:07,380
and you came in here,
attack me like a fucking wild man.

1535
01:05:07,381 --> 01:05:08,440
And you.
Yes.

1536
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:09,960
Yep,
I did though.

1537
01:05:09,961 --> 01:05:12,270
You're absolutely right.
I apologize for it.

1538
01:05:12,271 --> 01:05:14,220
I shouldn't,
it came at you that you're African.

1539
01:05:14,221 --> 01:05:15,930
That was,
that was the end of the few right now.

1540
01:05:15,931 --> 01:05:17,850
Maybe I can I be on your soda?

1541
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:21,430
Well,
shout out to Kevin Pereira.

1542
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,500
Forgetting Kevin Hill.
Yeah,

1543
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:24,221
man.
Thank you.

1544
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:24,910
Thank you.
Thank you.

1545
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:26,150
Brought them with you right now.
Yeah.

1546
01:05:26,151 --> 01:05:31,151
We're doing this patriarch campaign,
which I'm going to be honest with you.

1547
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,260
I hate,
um,

1548
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,510
to,
to ask anybody for anything.

1549
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:38,553
I hate that.
I,

1550
01:05:38,640 --> 01:05:39,650
I,
I been,

1551
01:05:40,030 --> 01:05:44,440
I've had a job,
I mean I'm working jobs since I was 12

1552
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:47,980
years ago and 12 years old.
I've worked in a gas station pumping gas

1553
01:05:47,981 --> 01:05:52,780
and it was during the fucking gas crisis
when the gas lines are super long.

1554
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:56,020
But I've always worked for,
I hate asking people going in this

1555
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:59,890
patriarchy campaign.
It's like asking people to help me,

1556
01:05:59,891 --> 01:06:02,170
you know,
now that I'm not able to travel the

1557
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:06,190
world or not able to get out there and
promote things like I used to,

1558
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,190
patron is a way that they can support me
in and it's called,

1559
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:10,720
uh,
define Dev.

1560
01:06:10,780 --> 01:06:14,320
I wanted to call it my last will and
testament because if,

1561
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:15,820
uh,
if I don't,

1562
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,040
if I'm not successful in my fighting and
if I don't get a heart transplant,

1563
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:22,750
I do get a heart transplant and rejects
and I'm dead.

1564
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:27,600
I have a record at there was a wreck.
And I thought last will and testament be

1565
01:06:27,601 --> 01:06:30,550
the best thing to call it because if I
lose the fight,

1566
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:35,110
then people can go back and see and
hopefully get some better.

1567
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:37,740
They can see how I faced.
You know,

1568
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,240
he hit a lot of people.
I have so many people telling me,

1569
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,730
oh sweetie,
don't worry about it.

1570
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,900
We were praying for you.
We got your back.

1571
01:06:43,901 --> 01:06:45,160
You know,
but hey,

1572
01:06:45,190 --> 01:06:48,460
none of that matters when you're in that
operating room.

1573
01:06:48,461 --> 01:06:51,970
Man,
I appreciate the good wishes and the

1574
01:06:51,971 --> 01:06:54,070
goodwill and all that.
But in the end,

1575
01:06:54,071 --> 01:06:55,270
you got to face it.

1576
01:06:55,290 --> 01:06:57,400
It's,
it's a solo experience.

1577
01:06:57,401 --> 01:07:00,010
You have to face death.
Everybody will,

1578
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:05,100
you have to face death on your own and
nobody else can step in for you and died

1579
01:07:05,201 --> 01:07:06,310
for you or,
or,

1580
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,700
or it's how you deal with it.
So this is uh,

1581
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:12,250
a permanent record of how I deal with,
uh,

1582
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:13,450
you know,
being in a,

1583
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:15,340
in a,
in a situation where I could possibly

1584
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:20,530
die and I want people to be able to look
at it just in case we want to make it,

1585
01:07:20,531 --> 01:07:23,110
don't make it whatever.
They can look back and they say,

1586
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:25,780
well this is how cte built with it.
This is,

1587
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,820
he's,
he's facing a transplant.

1588
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:33,150
He didn't make it but he went in with a
shit ton of faith and he believed he was

1589
01:07:33,281 --> 01:07:34,660
going to make it.
He was bleeding,

1590
01:07:34,661 --> 01:07:37,000
he was going to make it.
And then if I don't make it fucking,

1591
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:38,390
I ain't going to learn about it anyway.

1592
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:42,820
You guys talk all the shit they want to.
But I went in with a very positive

1593
01:07:42,821 --> 01:07:45,700
attitude.
I want to be able to see that now when

1594
01:07:45,701 --> 01:07:48,760
they do a heart transplant.
If you talked to anybody that's had a

1595
01:07:48,761 --> 01:07:50,080
heart transplant,
yes I am.

1596
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:51,120
Yeah.
And,

1597
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:54,880
and you know that those are the people
that I really,

1598
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:59,470
really want to hear from because they
can,

1599
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:02,110
he said,
and I appreciate it's,

1600
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,430
I get a shit shit.
Turn of well wishes and support and I

1601
01:08:06,431 --> 01:08:08,890
think from iron addicts all across the
planet.

1602
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,350
I mean they all behind me and I really,
really appreciate it,

1603
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,280
but I actually,
it's easy for me.

1604
01:08:13,281 --> 01:08:14,170
He said,
hey joe,

1605
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:16,040
be tough.
You're going through.

1606
01:08:16,070 --> 01:08:17,690
Yeah,
I know you're going through this thing,

1607
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:19,340
Joe,
but I want you to be tough.

1608
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,560
I want you to hang tough and I want you
to,

1609
01:08:21,561 --> 01:08:22,720
you know,
I'm rooted,

1610
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:28,240
but have I actually gone through when
I'm asked to circumstance that you're

1611
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:30,800
facing the difficulty to facing right
now?

1612
01:08:30,980 --> 01:08:33,770
Have I actually had any experience with
it?

1613
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:36,830
Because it's hard for me to listen to
you to tell me to,

1614
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,480
you know,
be strong and be tough about getting

1615
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:42,830
into heart transplant and you know,
you ain't never had nothing but a

1616
01:08:42,831 --> 01:08:45,150
fucking hang nail or something like,
you know what I mean?

1617
01:08:45,151 --> 01:08:47,450
If you've actually been through
something,

1618
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:51,140
then I can listen to you a lot better.
It's like a fighter,

1619
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,380
a guy who's never been in a fight trying
to tell a fight or what to do in his

1620
01:08:58,011 --> 01:08:58,890
next cage.
Right?

1621
01:08:58,891 --> 01:08:59,430
Hey,
hey,

1622
01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:01,100
you get in there and want you to put
this on.

1623
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:02,180
Put them in,
right?

1624
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:03,560
Yeah.
That fight.

1625
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:06,410
Yeah.
I'm not going to be listening too hard

1626
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,540
to a motherfucker.
Don't have no experience.

1627
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,720
Experiences to me is still the best
teacher.

1628
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,120
Especially something like a hard time.
Yeah.

1629
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:14,940
I mean I how it fit.

1630
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,810
What percentage of people have ever even
happen?

1631
01:09:16,830 --> 01:09:18,920
I mean,
how many people have successful heart

1632
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:19,970
transplants a year?
Do you know?

1633
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:20,930
You know,
I,

1634
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:23,780
I've tried to look it up,
but they don't give you too many numbers

1635
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:24,510
on,
on a,

1636
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:29,510
I think that uh,
the survival rate is 75 for the first,

1637
01:09:29,810 --> 01:09:30,920
no,
I think it's higher.

1638
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,260
80% for the first year.
Now it was lower,

1639
01:09:33,261 --> 01:09:33,861
you know,
years ago.

1640
01:09:33,861 --> 01:09:38,840
But now it's up to 80% survive for the
first year and they go some pretty

1641
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,420
intense drugs just to keep your body
from rejecting the organ.

1642
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:42,201
Right.
Definitely.

1643
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:45,040
But I'm taking a shit load of drugs
right now to take.

1644
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:48,410
Now I got 15 different pill,
15 different drugs,

1645
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:51,500
uh,
and I take every day just to survive.

1646
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:53,750
What are they all for?
Uh,

1647
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,230
the kid water off my lungs and lower my
blood pressure,

1648
01:09:57,570 --> 01:10:00,060
kidney,
all kinds of fucking different pills

1649
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,130
and,
and just to,

1650
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:03,530
that supposedly helped me function.

1651
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:06,380
And then sometime I honestly think they
fucked me up.

1652
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,960
Uh,
some of them fucked me up.

1653
01:10:07,961 --> 01:10:09,140
This,
it's hard for me to,

1654
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:12,490
you know,
function properly on a daily basis,

1655
01:10:12,530 --> 01:10:17,530
just a day of feeling normal.
If I can feel normal for the whole day,

1656
01:10:18,740 --> 01:10:20,770
oh,
that's fantastic man.

1657
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:23,840
Not good or,
you know,

1658
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:25,970
great.
I feel great today or there's no such

1659
01:10:25,971 --> 01:10:28,780
thing as me getting them saying I have,
I had a fucking great day to day,

1660
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:31,970
but if I can just feel normal for that
day,

1661
01:10:31,971 --> 01:10:35,000
then that's fantastic man.
And this is since June?

1662
01:10:35,150 --> 01:10:36,350
Yeah.
So before June,

1663
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:38,480
you were fine.
Even with the artificial heart valve.

1664
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,640
A,
I wouldn't say I W I was,

1665
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:41,391
I was,
yes.

1666
01:10:41,391 --> 01:10:44,060
For,
for 11 and a half of those years,

1667
01:10:44,061 --> 01:10:47,450
but six months prior to the,
the heart attack I had signs.

1668
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:49,130
So he started feeling it coming.
Yeah.

1669
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:49,993
Yeah.
Hanson,

1670
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:51,630
do you do any cardio or what?

1671
01:10:51,630 --> 01:10:54,140
Are you doing any cardio before?
Uh,

1672
01:10:54,590 --> 01:10:56,730
not really.
I can,

1673
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,310
you know,
the way I work out,

1674
01:10:58,311 --> 01:11:00,350
it's kind of cardio.
You be sweating,

1675
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,720
you know,
big puff of a sweat on the floor,

1676
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,170
like a calorie muscle.
I remember I put them through a workout

1677
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:09,260
and I was trained a lot of pro wrestlers
and stuff too when I put them through

1678
01:11:09,261 --> 01:11:12,080
the workout.
And Kelly Muslim who had the best,

1679
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,070
uh,
he said willikers

1680
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:17,550
that was the best one.
You said,

1681
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:19,710
damn ct,
he fucking crazy man.

1682
01:11:19,711 --> 01:11:21,590
But that was the best,
uh gee,

1683
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,040
that's bringing it way back Eddie
Griffin show.

1684
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:26,890
Yeah,
right,

1685
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:30,450
exactly.
Kelly was on fear factor.

1686
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:31,553
Yeah.
Waze.

1687
01:11:31,590 --> 01:11:32,670
Yeah,
yeah,

1688
01:11:32,940 --> 01:11:33,880
yeah,
yeah,

1689
01:11:33,900 --> 01:11:36,030
I do.
Do you fell off of a car?

1690
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:37,260
Oh,
what didn't work.

1691
01:11:37,261 --> 01:11:38,980
They have suspended over a,
uh,

1692
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:42,060
was like suspect.
See if they could find that giant

1693
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,120
giant.
It was a one of those dots where you had

1694
01:11:48,121 --> 01:11:50,830
to carry your own weight,
like climbing over thing.

1695
01:11:50,850 --> 01:11:53,240
Oh Shit.
He's like close to 350.

1696
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,170
Yeah.
So he's doing that.

1697
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:56,740
It's just,
it was the wrong stop.

1698
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,390
Yeah,
I bet it was.

1699
01:11:58,910 --> 01:12:01,230
I,
I adopted that guy.

1700
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,850
My son.
He's fucking,

1701
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,400
he's,
he's got an interesting story.

1702
01:12:04,401 --> 01:12:05,610
I'm so,
oh my God,

1703
01:12:05,611 --> 01:12:08,070
he's got a youtube story.
Yeah.

1704
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,660
Yeah.
Hell of a story,

1705
01:12:09,661 --> 01:12:10,680
man.
He's a real,

1706
01:12:10,710 --> 01:12:13,290
real good.
And the good thing about him,

1707
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:16,200
he's the same way on and off youtube.
Yeah.

1708
01:12:16,201 --> 01:12:17,730
He was a very friendly guy when I met
him.

1709
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:20,640
I enjoy talking to him a lot.
He's jacked as fuck.

1710
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,050
Oh yeah,
definitely.

1711
01:12:22,170 --> 01:12:23,850
Definitely counting muscles.
Jack.

1712
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,240
Yeah.
I interviewed,

1713
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:29,520
one of my favorite interviews was hoists
gracie.

1714
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:30,570
Really?
Yeah,

1715
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:32,070
I got the interview.
He's crazy.

1716
01:12:32,071 --> 01:12:35,280
And it was incredibly,
uh,

1717
01:12:35,670 --> 01:12:40,200
we had some incredible similarities in
our train of thought and how we think

1718
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,000
he,
yeah,

1719
01:12:42,001 --> 01:12:43,260
he told me that,
uh,

1720
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:48,310
on the day of fight,
he made no plans for after the fight.

1721
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,040
No plans.
No,

1722
01:12:50,041 --> 01:12:53,160
we're going out to dinner.
You're gonna celebrate none of that.

1723
01:12:54,030 --> 01:12:58,230
He was,
he said I was completely 100% prepared

1724
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:02,040
to die in that octagon.
And I'm like,

1725
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:03,170
fuck.
Yeah.

1726
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:11,970
That resonated with me so hard because I
remember my last context cause you know

1727
01:13:12,780 --> 01:13:15,650
they told me about my heart valve and
uh,

1728
01:13:15,780 --> 01:13:18,060
the 90s,
in 95 at my last congress,

1729
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,470
greatest bench press in America,
they say you're going to miss it for

1730
01:13:20,471 --> 01:13:23,040
two.
You can go out there and in front of all

1731
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,670
those people and,
and,

1732
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,760
and uh,
your valve could break,

1733
01:13:26,761 --> 01:13:30,960
burst and you could die right there on
the bench press in front of all those

1734
01:13:30,961 --> 01:13:32,820
people.
Are you going to go?

1735
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:36,720
And I looked at him and I said,
fuck yeah,

1736
01:13:36,721 --> 01:13:37,820
I'm going,
are you out?

1737
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,690
Took my doctor looked at me like I'm
crazy.

1738
01:13:39,691 --> 01:13:42,090
I'm looking at him like he crazy.
Fuck yes,

1739
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:43,480
I'm going.
Hell yeah.

1740
01:13:43,730 --> 01:13:45,870
I your mind,
what a glorious,

1741
01:13:45,871 --> 01:13:49,140
wait,
what did is way to go out doing what I

1742
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:53,550
fucking love to do what I chained to do
my whole fucking life in front of all

1743
01:13:53,551 --> 01:13:55,410
these people.
Oh Man.

1744
01:13:55,411 --> 01:13:58,440
I couldn't ask if I was writing a movie
script and couldn't be any better.

1745
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,900
Wow.
Fucking died right there on stage in

1746
01:14:00,901 --> 01:14:05,550
front of every fucking body bitch brush.
So I'm felt the same way.

1747
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:09,600
I felt the same way because he's crazy
and it just really made me feel good

1748
01:14:09,601 --> 01:14:11,710
that I wasn't the only crazy
motherfucker when the plan,

1749
01:14:11,740 --> 01:14:11,980
he's

1750
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:14,050
definitely crazy.
He's the most important figure in the

1751
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:19,051
history of martial arts.
His UFC one in 1993 changed the world,

1752
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:23,950
changed the world because people thought
that you had to be like the bigger guy

1753
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:25,990
and then all of a sudden he showed that
no,

1754
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:27,400
there's,
there's this thing called Brazilian

1755
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:30,310
Jujitsu and this dude coming out wearing
pajamas is just going to fuck all you

1756
01:14:30,311 --> 01:14:34,870
people change the world of martial arts.
Everybody started training Jujitsu.

1757
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,210
Oh my God.
I don't even know what it was.

1758
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,580
I didn't have no idea what it was.
No idea.

1759
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,080
As soon as it came out,
I was like,

1760
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:43,180
I'm enrolled.
I went to Carlson Gracie,

1761
01:14:43,570 --> 01:14:45,910
I went to Hixon Gracie's first and then
the Carlson gracie's.

1762
01:14:45,911 --> 01:14:48,040
Yeah.
And I think that is why,

1763
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:48,851
uh,
up in,

1764
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:49,684
uh,
uh,

1765
01:14:49,940 --> 01:14:52,070
uh,
blow some smoke up your butt there,

1766
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:53,810
Joe.
I think that's why you said two

1767
01:14:53,820 --> 01:14:57,290
fantastic analyst.
I think that's why you're the best at

1768
01:14:57,291 --> 01:15:01,730
what you do because you get to ass in
there and actually experience it.

1769
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:02,780
And even when you say

1770
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:06,480
a hold or you see a Omoplata or whatever
it,

1771
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:08,250
you know what the fuck you're talking
about.

1772
01:15:08,430 --> 01:15:10,560
And I think that helps.
But I think I'm very,

1773
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:13,920
very fortunate that I have a series of
jobs that help each other.

1774
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:16,800
Yeah.
And that like being a Canadian and being

1775
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:19,020
able to talk on stage in front of all
those people.

1776
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:22,210
I'm comfortable.
I'm comfortable in front of a microphone

1777
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,870
doing a podcast.
I'm going to see and I'm comfortable and

1778
01:15:24,871 --> 01:15:26,490
I love MMA.
Obviously.

1779
01:15:26,491 --> 01:15:28,900
I'm a huge fan of martial arts,
so this is good.

1780
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,090
It's my chance to express myself about
something that I really enjoy it and I

1781
01:15:33,091 --> 01:15:35,870
don't,
I don't feel burdened down by the,

1782
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,070
the moment of like the camera on me
counts.

1783
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:40,940
Yeah.

1784
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:44,500
The performing in front of a live
audience and you're being comedian or,

1785
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:45,970
or what did you do for the,

1786
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,250
Oh,
you have seats way,

1787
01:15:47,251 --> 01:15:48,680
way easier.
Yeah.

1788
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:49,650
It's very,
very,

1789
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,570
it's,
I wouldn't say it's easy because you

1790
01:15:51,571 --> 01:15:53,460
have to have,
you have to understand what you're

1791
01:15:53,461 --> 01:15:56,010
talking about.
You have to have a lot of information in

1792
01:15:56,011 --> 01:16:00,420
your head and you have to really care.
Like it's my job just to represent the

1793
01:16:00,421 --> 01:16:02,100
experience that these guys are going
through it.

1794
01:16:02,170 --> 01:16:03,870
When I,
when I think about commentary,

1795
01:16:03,871 --> 01:16:07,110
I'm thinking about he's these guys been
through months of training camp.

1796
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:08,760
They've dieted,
they've,

1797
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:11,100
you know,
cut weight just to get down to their

1798
01:16:11,101 --> 01:16:13,830
weight class there.
Rehydrated there's so much emotions and

1799
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:16,380
intensity.
It's just my job to honor their

1800
01:16:16,381 --> 01:16:20,290
experience and to do my best to make it
fun for the fans at home and make a

1801
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,380
traumatic.
That's all my job there.

1802
01:16:22,381 --> 01:16:26,490
They have the hard job.
My job is just to not fuck up and to try

1803
01:16:26,491 --> 01:16:31,110
to describe it the best way that I can.
It's way easy than stand up.

1804
01:16:31,610 --> 01:16:32,590
Aye.
Aye.

1805
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:34,190
Aye.
The live art.

1806
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:36,620
Oh Shit.
I know.

1807
01:16:36,621 --> 01:16:37,640
I'm just being,
uh,

1808
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,340
uh,
well I can imagine not going around the

1809
01:16:40,341 --> 01:16:45,341
world giving speeches and uh,
seminars in front of live audiences.

1810
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,920
It's much easier for me.
And now I'm,

1811
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:53,000
this is a big ass thing,
but it's much easier for me to sit

1812
01:16:53,001 --> 01:16:54,770
across the table,
Joe Rogan and talk to him.

1813
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,670
Then he used to do his people,
you know,

1814
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:58,650
shooting all kinds of questions at me.

1815
01:16:59,060 --> 01:16:59,930
Yes.
All right.

1816
01:16:59,931 --> 01:17:03,150
It's going to be odd for you to
experience this late in life too.

1817
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:06,530
I couldn't do it.
I,

1818
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:10,160
if I had to sit across the table from
Joel going to 21 days or I'd be too

1819
01:17:10,161 --> 01:17:14,450
fucking pantry fried to do it,
I think he would talk and I think you

1820
01:17:14,451 --> 01:17:16,280
would loosen up and then you'd be
yourself.

1821
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:21,260
I'd be choked up for a while.
Maybe fucking two.

1822
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:23,200
I'd be tied to him that wouldn't be able
to,

1823
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:28,490
once it's just people,
people relax.

1824
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:30,920
I don't think so.
I was to,

1825
01:17:30,921 --> 01:17:32,710
uh,
to uh,

1826
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:35,870
wound up emotionally as a 21 year too.
Who isn't?

1827
01:17:35,930 --> 01:17:37,040
Oh Man.
You know,

1828
01:17:37,130 --> 01:17:40,620
I could imagine I was talking with a
buddy of mine cause I started standing

1829
01:17:40,621 --> 01:17:43,340
up at 21 and I was like,
what the fuck did I have to talk about

1830
01:17:43,341 --> 01:17:44,840
when I was 21?
I didn't know shit.

1831
01:17:45,110 --> 01:17:47,050
Wow.
You literally don't know anything doing

1832
01:17:47,051 --> 01:17:48,100
anything.
Yeah.

1833
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,660
It started at 21.
Wow.

1834
01:17:49,661 --> 01:17:51,500
I don't know a fucking thing.

1835
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:56,810
We now 35
fucking 50 50 old bastard.

1836
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:03,650
This guy's fucking 15 years old.
I started in August 27th,

1837
01:18:04,970 --> 01:18:06,410
1988.
Wow.

1838
01:18:08,140 --> 01:18:11,760
Thanks very much man.
I have my big for Joe Rogan's.

1839
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,630
Looks good.
It's fucking fuck man.

1840
01:18:14,631 --> 01:18:17,240
What's it like when you don't die?
It's white as fuck.

1841
01:18:17,270 --> 01:18:17,871
Cause it.
Yeah.

1842
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:21,000
I'll give someone gave him Santa Claus
and run for fucking money.

1843
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,000
Get rid of black beard.
Oh,

1844
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:25,400
I had to make the loan for lacking that
shit up.

1845
01:18:25,401 --> 01:18:26,470
Who gives a shit?
Yeah,

1846
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:27,041
I know.
I do.

1847
01:18:27,041 --> 01:18:30,050
I know just for me and better start
paying me for this fucking Shit,

1848
01:18:30,051 --> 01:18:31,850
man.
I've been advertising for them fucker

1849
01:18:31,851 --> 01:18:35,450
for years.
They should get in there with that comb

1850
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:36,380
right here.
Yeah.

1851
01:18:36,410 --> 01:18:39,020
I'm getting in their work it out and
making that shit black.

1852
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,690
So how often do you do youtube videos
now?

1853
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,130
Uh,
we released a new one every Saturday and

1854
01:18:46,131 --> 01:18:47,690
they have changed so much.

1855
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:50,360
Your last week I had a cooking show.
Oh yeah,

1856
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:52,110
yeah.
A vegan cooking show.

1857
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,780
Yeah.
You're doing all the Vegan Diet now,

1858
01:18:53,781 --> 01:18:54,411
Huh?
Well,

1859
01:18:54,411 --> 01:18:56,150
you know,
I can't call myself beacon.

1860
01:18:56,180 --> 01:18:59,480
I call myself plant based.
I started out seeing I was Vegan and

1861
01:18:59,490 --> 01:19:04,300
then I realized how crazy new Vegan
folks in and I said,

1862
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:07,250
you know,
I'm not thinking cause I'm not doing it

1863
01:19:07,251 --> 01:19:10,900
because I,
I'm thinking about the animals and

1864
01:19:10,901 --> 01:19:11,511
they're going be,
you know,

1865
01:19:11,511 --> 01:19:15,170
fuck your ass up out.
That shit is super serious about that.

1866
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,390
I'm not doing it because of that.
I'm doing it for,

1867
01:19:17,630 --> 01:19:21,500
here's a lot of people that are Vegan
that are Vegan for the right reasons.

1868
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:25,160
They're Vegan because the conscientious
cause they want to do it for health

1869
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:28,700
because they want to have the least
amount of impact on the environment

1870
01:19:28,701 --> 01:19:31,430
because they want,
they don't want animals to die.

1871
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:35,450
But then there's a lot of people that
are Vegan that really just belonged to

1872
01:19:35,451 --> 01:19:38,140
something.
They could have been scientology or he

1873
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:40,070
could have been a moonie.
They could have been any.

1874
01:19:40,090 --> 01:19:45,090
They found that and they ran with it and
now they are fucking ruthless against

1875
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:47,940
people that aren't in that group.
And they,

1876
01:19:47,941 --> 01:19:51,650
they generally give like goodhearted,
kindhearted,

1877
01:19:51,651 --> 01:19:52,730
vegans,
a bad name.

1878
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:55,700
And it's a small percentage,
but a lot of these motherfuckers,

1879
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:58,720
they have like Vegan in their online
name and there,

1880
01:19:58,721 --> 01:19:59,480
you know,
and they

1881
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,340
tack like you look at their,
like their comments,

1882
01:20:01,341 --> 01:20:03,720
they're all attacking all the old people
at constant.

1883
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:05,083
Yeah.

1884
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:10,080
Angry people that found reason to be a,
an aggressive person.

1885
01:20:10,081 --> 01:20:12,570
Like you've found a greenlight,
oh this person's not vegan.

1886
01:20:12,571 --> 01:20:14,670
I can attack them.
And you're the reason why the world,

1887
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:17,370
you're the responsible for the pollution
and all the car.

1888
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,280
Did you know that if you were Vegan that
this would be less suffering and this

1889
01:20:20,281 --> 01:20:21,890
would be,
oh my God,

1890
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:24,810
this.
And they do the worst job of promoting

1891
01:20:24,811 --> 01:20:27,800
veganism because people see those crazy
ass holes and then they go,

1892
01:20:27,810 --> 01:20:30,660
fuck these people.
I'm going to go eat a steak just for

1893
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:33,210
you,
but I'm going to shoot this fucking cow

1894
01:20:33,211 --> 01:20:35,580
right now and I'm going to eat them
right in front of you.

1895
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:36,893
Fuck you,
man.

1896
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,840
It was,
I didn't want to be associated with

1897
01:20:39,841 --> 01:20:42,840
them,
that radical part of at all.

1898
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:45,630
So I stopped saying I'm being,
I just don't eat meat.

1899
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:50,430
I would like to get you connected to
some real nutrition experts that could

1900
01:20:50,431 --> 01:20:52,720
break down why that might not be the
best idea.

1901
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,560
And what,
what is important in your diet in terms

1902
01:20:55,561 --> 01:20:59,610
of like essential fatty acids and
healthy fats in terms of like,

1903
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:04,470
like a lot of people think that refined
carbohydrates are the big problem with

1904
01:21:04,471 --> 01:21:07,830
heart disease are fine carbohydrates and
sugar is what contributes to heart

1905
01:21:07,831 --> 01:21:09,450
disease.
Do you know the whole thing that came

1906
01:21:09,451 --> 01:21:12,990
out pretty recently in the New York
Times did an expo say about the sugar

1907
01:21:12,991 --> 01:21:17,991
industry having paid off scientists in
the 1950s to put the blame on saturated

1908
01:21:18,781 --> 01:21:23,781
fats and cholesterol instead of sugar
and then yeah,

1909
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:28,440
is a complete total fabricated
conspiracy by the sugar industry because

1910
01:21:28,441 --> 01:21:30,030
they were,
they were doing these tests and they

1911
01:21:30,031 --> 01:21:31,320
were realizing like,
Holy Shit,

1912
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:34,320
like sugar fucks people up.
It's terrible for you.

1913
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,830
And so what they did is they literally
bribed scientists and not that much

1914
01:21:37,831 --> 01:21:39,030
money,
which is kind of crazy.

1915
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,360
In the 1950s they paid them something
around $50,000 and I don't even know if

1916
01:21:44,611 --> 01:21:48,780
it's $50,000 today,
I think it was the equivalent of $50,000

1917
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:54,150
and these people just fabricated these
reports and got everybody convinced that

1918
01:21:54,151 --> 01:21:56,880
saturated fat,
which is an essential part of the human

1919
01:21:56,881 --> 01:22:01,110
diet and cholesterol,
which is the literally the substrate for

1920
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,140
hormone production,
like cholesterol is important for your

1921
01:22:04,141 --> 01:22:08,400
body and that these things are
responsible for heart disease and not

1922
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:12,630
sugar,
refined sugar and refined carbohydrates.

1923
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:15,150
They're completely unnatural in the
human body.

1924
01:22:15,151 --> 01:22:18,540
You're not supposed to be able to just
scoop up a fucking tablespoon full of

1925
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:21,360
sugar and dump it in your mouth.
It's not real in the world.

1926
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:24,300
I give you get sugar in the world.
It's attached to an apple.

1927
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:26,730
You know,
as you get carbohydrates,

1928
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:29,850
it's in plants,
it's fiber you're eating to end.

1929
01:22:29,851 --> 01:22:33,000
Your body knows how to process that.
Your body doesn't know what the fuck to

1930
01:22:33,001 --> 01:22:35,760
do with bread,
especially the bread that we eat today

1931
01:22:36,580 --> 01:22:40,860
sprayed down with fucking all sorts of
shit to prevent pesticide.

1932
01:22:40,890 --> 01:22:45,240
All these pesticides and it's the,
they changed the wheat and made it more,

1933
01:22:45,241 --> 01:22:48,360
more complex glutens,
so your body's a hard time processing

1934
01:22:48,361 --> 01:22:50,160
it.
So a lot of bad food.

1935
01:22:51,730 --> 01:22:53,070
No,
I'm not a Vegan,

1936
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:57,180
but I respect the people that are doing
it because they're doing it because they

1937
01:22:57,181 --> 01:23:00,120
don't want to cause harm and I respect
the people that are doing it that think

1938
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,290
they're doing it for their health.

1939
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:04,530
But I've talked to a lot of vegans that
were formally Vegan,

1940
01:23:04,531 --> 01:23:08,620
especially Chris Kresser who is an
actual scientist and is one of the

1941
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:13,210
leading experts on the,
the real issue with the Vegan Diet and

1942
01:23:13,211 --> 01:23:17,290
how it does work for some people,
some people with their biological

1943
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,930
requirements and their,
their physical requirements in terms of

1944
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:22,990
like what their activity is.
They functioned fine on a Vegan Diet.

1945
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,240
As long as they're careful,
they make sure they get enough.

1946
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,370
12,
they make sure they get their fatty

1947
01:23:27,371 --> 01:23:29,860
acids,
make sure they get their essential fatty

1948
01:23:29,861 --> 01:23:33,040
acids from coconuts and flaxseed oil.
And there's a,

1949
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,060
you know,
avocado,

1950
01:23:34,061 --> 01:23:36,310
there's a lot of different ways you can
get oils for your body,

1951
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:38,470
but your body needs that shit.
It's essential.

1952
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,940
There's a like a lot of essential
things.

1953
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:41,770
I would love to connect you with these
guys.

1954
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:42,501
Yeah.
And I'm,

1955
01:23:42,501 --> 01:23:45,540
I'm open to very open to it.
I changed my,

1956
01:23:45,541 --> 01:23:46,840
uh,
outlook,

1957
01:23:46,841 --> 01:23:48,230
you know,
after this last for architecture.

1958
01:23:48,260 --> 01:23:50,540
I changed my outlook a completely and
that's,

1959
01:23:50,590 --> 01:23:52,780
that's what made me even trying to,
yeah.

1960
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,940
A plant based Diet.
Um,

1961
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:55,681
you know,
I,

1962
01:23:55,681 --> 01:23:56,500
I had,
uh,

1963
01:23:56,500 --> 01:24:00,320
I have a supplement company that's earn
an experience,

1964
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:04,660
a hardcore hardcore forts.
It's billed as for the hardest core

1965
01:24:04,661 --> 01:24:06,770
motherfuckers on the quick kind of Shit.
Yeah.

1966
01:24:06,790 --> 01:24:09,790
You know,
preworkouts and pumps and stuff.

1967
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,760
But after he had,
I started,

1968
01:24:11,761 --> 01:24:13,870
I started another brand,
uh,

1969
01:24:14,080 --> 01:24:14,913
uh,
Odyssey.

1970
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,880
Nutraceuticals is completely different.
Our named Odyssey because that's what I

1971
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:21,150
consider my life is this isn't an
artist.

1972
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:24,220
He can punch a difference.
I got one hell of a legacy going on.

1973
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:28,750
But anyway,
it's a a plant based protein or is very

1974
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,810
health conscientious,
a very health conscious entity.

1975
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:32,753
So

1976
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,000
I'm a fan of plant based protein.
Oh,

1977
01:24:35,001 --> 01:24:37,310
pea protein is really good.
I love hemp protein.

1978
01:24:37,311 --> 01:24:39,920
That's my favorite.
I think hemp protein is very easy for

1979
01:24:39,921 --> 01:24:43,180
you to body digest.
The real problem with a lot of plant

1980
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:44,570
plant proteins is,
I mean,

1981
01:24:44,571 --> 01:24:47,390
if you just eat just plants,
especially eating whole foods,

1982
01:24:47,660 --> 01:24:51,200
you're not nest that your body's not
breaking it down the same way your body

1983
01:24:51,201 --> 01:24:54,320
would break down a steak,
say or grass fed beef.

1984
01:24:54,740 --> 01:24:57,070
I'm going to send you a fan,
pulled my shit.

1985
01:24:57,170 --> 01:25:00,590
I'd love to get it.
And you tell me what you think and uh,

1986
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:02,790
uh,
I see nutraceuticals.

1987
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:05,890
I had to get there early and on the air
before Joe King can fuck off.

1988
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,160
What is the website?
You have a website for nutraceuticals

1989
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:13,570
dotcom and go check it out.
I've got to get that city and before he

1990
01:25:13,571 --> 01:25:14,404
kicked me off,

1991
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:15,840
yeah.
You know,

1992
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:18,190
when we were going back and forth,
I remember one of the questions that I

1993
01:25:18,191 --> 01:25:19,210
had to ask you,
I said,

1994
01:25:19,211 --> 01:25:22,870
what is I?
S y m f.

1995
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,940
S what the fuck is that?
Cause it's something under your thing

1996
01:25:24,941 --> 01:25:28,150
all the time.
And when you told me I was laughing out

1997
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:32,590
loud in front of my computer,
still your mother fucking says exactly

1998
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:34,090
what it stands for,
Jo.

1999
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:35,420
And I love that.

2000
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:37,190
But if you,
uh,

2001
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:40,360
it's really based on,
uh,

2002
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,830
my mom,
uh,

2003
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:44,740
my mom was raising rom.
Not completely retarded.

2004
01:25:44,741 --> 01:25:45,040
I mean,
I,

2005
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,810
I,
I think I'm seeing my retarded,

2006
01:25:46,811 --> 01:25:49,330
but I'm not complete or retarded.
That's not a,

2007
01:25:49,420 --> 01:25:51,280
I shouldn't say I still allow it.
Okay,

2008
01:25:51,281 --> 01:25:51,971
thank you.
Joe.

2009
01:25:51,971 --> 01:25:54,680
It doesn't mean the disease a dummy.
Yeah.

2010
01:25:54,681 --> 01:25:56,640
I'm not saying I'm not completely,
you know,

2011
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:59,140
it retarded and intent.

2012
01:26:00,210 --> 01:26:02,770
She'd just be noises that you make the
convey intent.

2013
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,280
I don't,
that should be magic noises.

2014
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:05,350
Can't say,

2015
01:26:05,350 --> 01:26:07,930
Ooh,
God dammit Joe.

2016
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:08,873
Ooh,
that was,

2017
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:09,933
that was deep.

2018
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:12,450
Yeah.
I think people are too sensitive.

2019
01:26:12,451 --> 01:26:14,910
And then on top of it,
people are looking to tell you to not

2020
01:26:14,911 --> 01:26:16,340
say certain words.
We all took that,

2021
01:26:16,341 --> 01:26:17,174
the art board,

2022
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:20,020
wrong word now it's problematic today.
Oh my God.

2023
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:22,690
Oh yeah.
So it came from my mom.

2024
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,940
My mom was,
I tell you that her now,

2025
01:26:24,941 --> 01:26:27,340
all of his siblings died from a heart
related prom.

2026
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:31,000
So she was sick most of her adult life,
I swear.

2027
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:33,550
I remember mostly,
I remember very early when I was very

2028
01:26:33,551 --> 01:26:34,780
young,
my mom being healthy,

2029
01:26:34,990 --> 01:26:38,980
but she was sick most of her adult life.
Most of my memories of my mom when she

2030
01:26:38,981 --> 01:26:41,380
was sick,
but every day,

2031
01:26:41,530 --> 01:26:42,580
every day,
and I mean,

2032
01:26:42,581 --> 01:26:45,220
she was really sick in and out of
emergency rooms and said,

2033
01:26:45,610 --> 01:26:47,020
if you ask my mom,
hey,

2034
01:26:47,021 --> 01:26:48,820
I,
Mrs. Fletcher Hard,

2035
01:26:48,940 --> 01:26:53,940
she would say I'm blessed.
Her standard answer was always blessed.

2036
01:26:54,850 --> 01:26:57,910
And the reason she told me the reason
why she would say that is because I'm

2037
01:26:57,911 --> 01:26:59,680
still alive.
I'm not dead.

2038
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:01,820
So if I'm still alive,
I ha ha,

2039
01:27:01,890 --> 01:27:02,870
I still have life.

2040
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:04,900
If I still can go on,
I still could make a change.

2041
01:27:04,901 --> 01:27:07,700
I still can make it different.
So it's,

2042
01:27:08,060 --> 01:27:10,960
I got it from her no matter what the
situation,

2043
01:27:10,961 --> 01:27:13,830
how bad it may seen,
how people complain,

2044
01:27:13,850 --> 01:27:16,210
that man,
you still alive motherfucker.

2045
01:27:16,630 --> 01:27:18,970
So you said your life and you're still
alive,

2046
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:20,450
you still have a chance to make a
difference.

2047
01:27:20,451 --> 01:27:22,270
You're still going,
what's the worst thing that happened?

2048
01:27:22,271 --> 01:27:23,440
I could die.
Okay,

2049
01:27:23,441 --> 01:27:25,360
well if you ain't dead,
motherfucker keep going.

2050
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:29,190
You ain't did it scare you?
Said Fuck.

2051
01:27:29,470 --> 01:27:30,850
Yeah.
So yeah,

2052
01:27:30,851 --> 01:27:32,840
she was blessed and that's why I always,
you know,

2053
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:33,140
people,
hey,

2054
01:27:33,140 --> 01:27:34,360
how you doing sweetie?
I'm blessed.

2055
01:27:34,361 --> 01:27:36,610
No matter what the fuck's going on,
I'm still alive.

2056
01:27:36,611 --> 01:27:37,444
So I'm blessed.

2057
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,980
That's awesome that people need to hear
that.

2058
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:43,070
They do need to hear that and they need
to hear your attitude about excuses.

2059
01:27:43,071 --> 01:27:44,810
Cause both of those things are very
important.

2060
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:46,760
It's very important for people to
process.

2061
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:51,560
There's a lot of people have like bad
patterns in their mind and these bad

2062
01:27:51,561 --> 01:27:55,040
patterns,
the way they've interacted with the

2063
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:57,410
world,
the way they've approached all sorts of

2064
01:27:57,411 --> 01:27:59,630
different problems.
They have these patterns and they fall

2065
01:27:59,631 --> 01:28:02,720
right into these patterns and maybe they
learn these patterns from their family

2066
01:28:02,721 --> 01:28:04,940
member that maybe they learn these
patterns from their environment.

2067
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:08,990
Maybe these patterns are like defense
mechanisms to keep them from challenging

2068
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:11,420
themselves.
But you got to recognize what those are.

2069
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:14,240
It's not you like you're not a lazy
fuck,

2070
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:16,340
but you've been behaving like a lazy
fuck.

2071
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:18,330
Well,
you are as a human right,

2072
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:19,520
and you could be anything.

2073
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:22,430
You could just decide to me,
you know the story of David Goggins,

2074
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,170
David Goggins.
Damn.

2075
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:26,980
This navy seal.
Exactly.

2076
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:27,640
Yeah.
Yeah.

2077
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,690
I recently looked them up.
It was super fat.

2078
01:28:31,070 --> 01:28:32,720
Fully out of shape.
Like,

2079
01:28:32,721 --> 01:28:37,440
like literally like on death's door,
healthwise guy just starting school I

2080
01:28:37,441 --> 01:28:40,230
fucked with,
but a sided.

2081
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:42,440
Yep.
The enough is enough.

2082
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:46,760
Just literally in his own mind decided
he was gonna win the world record for

2083
01:28:46,761 --> 01:28:51,140
Chin ups decided he's going to be like
this incredible endurance athlete did.

2084
01:28:51,141 --> 01:28:52,010
It just did.
It just does.

2085
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:54,710
It just forces his mind.
And he has this thing that he says that

2086
01:28:54,711 --> 01:28:56,480
I think about whenever I'm tired.
He said,

2087
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:57,950
most people quit at 40%

2088
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:02,010
wow.
Believe I believe

2089
01:29:02,010 --> 01:29:04,500
that too.
I believe that most people get a little

2090
01:29:04,501 --> 01:29:05,041
tired and like,
oh,

2091
01:29:05,041 --> 01:29:06,270
fuck this.
You know,

2092
01:29:06,271 --> 01:29:08,270
but you couldn't go further.
You can't go further.

2093
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:09,600
Yeah,
man.

2094
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:13,070
Yeah.
I just recently read a on and I had

2095
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,360
watched the video of him.
Somebody sent it to me.

2096
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:17,680
He's a savage.
He's tricked me.

2097
01:29:17,720 --> 01:29:19,130
Mental savage.
Aw,

2098
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:20,000
yeah.
I love it.

2099
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,690
I love those guys.
Those people are important.

2100
01:29:21,691 --> 01:29:24,360
You've got to know that those people are
out there and him in particular,

2101
01:29:24,361 --> 01:29:26,790
he's really important because he was
super out of shape.

2102
01:29:27,330 --> 01:29:31,170
It's not like he was always this ripped
super athlete like he was like fat and

2103
01:29:31,171 --> 01:29:34,680
terrible diet and poor health and poor
depression.

2104
01:29:34,681 --> 01:29:39,210
The whole deal and just tightened it up
and now he's an animal.

2105
01:29:39,211 --> 01:29:41,560
Now you can't fuck with them.
Fucking beside.

2106
01:29:41,590 --> 01:29:44,940
Yes.
Decided to and anybody can do that.

2107
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:46,830
All the people out there that think
they're lazy.

2108
01:29:46,860 --> 01:29:49,890
No.
You've been behaving like a lazy person.

2109
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:53,580
You've been following lazy patterns.
If you just decide tomorrow,

2110
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,410
first of all,
if you decide tomorrow you're going to

2111
01:29:55,411 --> 01:29:59,760
be a discipline focused person,
don't expect to have the kind of energy

2112
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,850
that someone who's been disciplined and
focused for years house cause you're not

2113
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:04,560
going to,
that's we're going that your body's not

2114
01:30:04,561 --> 01:30:07,080
going to be conditioned for it.
Your mind's not going to be accustomed

2115
01:30:07,081 --> 01:30:09,270
to the strain,
but you can still do it right.

2116
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:10,140
You just,
you're going to scale,

2117
01:30:10,141 --> 01:30:13,920
you get tired quicker and then hopefully
by next week you'll have more endurance

2118
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,680
and then by the week after that you'll
have more and if you keep building six

2119
01:30:16,681 --> 01:30:18,330
months from now,
you'll be unrecognizable.

2120
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:18,841
Yes.
Right.

2121
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:22,290
If you stick with you definitely will,
but everything's got to start from right

2122
01:30:22,740 --> 01:30:25,200
here in important.
That's why you're important.

2123
01:30:25,201 --> 01:30:28,080
That's why your videos are so important
because your videos,

2124
01:30:28,081 --> 01:30:29,470
I guaran fucking tee it.

2125
01:30:29,470 --> 01:30:32,010
I don't know the number,
but I want to say 100,000 people

2126
01:30:32,011 --> 01:30:33,720
probably watch your videos and change
their life.

2127
01:30:34,110 --> 01:30:38,400
I guarantee you real.
It's a lot more than I though.

2128
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:43,320
I bet you've changed people's entire
outlook on things.

2129
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:46,500
That's,
that's everything in this life.

2130
01:30:46,730 --> 01:30:49,500
This is a little,
because you can get information.

2131
01:30:49,770 --> 01:30:51,990
Books are wonderful documentaries and
one full.

2132
01:30:51,991 --> 01:30:56,991
What's really great is inspiration.
The fuel that the little push,

2133
01:30:57,391 --> 01:30:59,980
just a little push just to get you
moving.

2134
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:04,320
Sometimes that's all it needs and then
next thing you know it and then people

2135
01:31:04,321 --> 01:31:07,830
like you because you've had a lifetime
of this discipline and dedication and

2136
01:31:07,831 --> 01:31:12,150
obsession that that reinforces it in
people's heads.

2137
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:15,140
Like I want to do what ct does.
I want to be like that.

2138
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:17,040
I want to have that kind of energy and
focus.

2139
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:20,190
Joe Rogan,
me ever started about thought about

2140
01:31:20,191 --> 01:31:21,660
getting into the octagon yourself?

2141
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:24,810
I want to know I'm too old now.
I almost did at one point in time,

2142
01:31:24,811 --> 01:31:26,210
but not at this point.
No,

2143
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,600
no.
What earlier?

2144
01:31:27,780 --> 01:31:29,850
Yeah.
Well when I was kickboxing man,

2145
01:31:29,851 --> 01:31:33,000
I got a lot of fucking headaches and I
was really worried.

2146
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,610
I,
I came from a real meathead gym and we

2147
01:31:35,611 --> 01:31:40,140
did like hard sparring and I did a lot
of hard spot in this one kid in

2148
01:31:40,141 --> 01:31:43,410
particular who was a really good boxer
and we'd beat the fuck out of each

2149
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:44,244
other.
Oh.

2150
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:47,760
And um,
the problem is like I would go home and

2151
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,310
you know,
this was going on over a few years.

2152
01:31:50,311 --> 01:31:52,590
I would go home and my head would be
pounding,

2153
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:54,060
just boom,
boom,

2154
01:31:54,061 --> 01:31:55,140
boom,
lying in bed.

2155
01:31:55,141 --> 01:31:57,090
And I was thinking,
what am I doing myself?

2156
01:31:57,091 --> 01:31:58,680
Am I going to be stupid when I get
older?

2157
01:31:58,681 --> 01:32:00,820
Am I going to not know where I am?

2158
01:32:00,820 --> 01:32:05,260
I going to be stumbling on my words.
I was terrified to brain damage because

2159
01:32:06,230 --> 01:32:09,700
I've always been,
I've always been a very curious person

2160
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:14,410
and I've always been fascinated by the,
the way you can change the way you think

2161
01:32:14,411 --> 01:32:17,380
about things and by being in.
So that's why I'm so excited about

2162
01:32:17,381 --> 01:32:20,320
talking to you,
like inspiration and motivation and even

2163
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:22,420
information like having these things in
your mind.

2164
01:32:22,690 --> 01:32:25,150
You can forge these things together to,
to,

2165
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,430
to make your mind going a certain
direction.

2166
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,980
So the quality of my thoughts has always
been very,

2167
01:32:29,981 --> 01:32:33,820
very important to me because I know that
that's what made me successful in all

2168
01:32:33,821 --> 01:32:36,160
the different areas that I've chosen to
pursue.

2169
01:32:36,161 --> 01:32:39,010
It's like the quality of your thinking
and being able to recognize what's good

2170
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:42,280
and what's bad,
but the mind itself,

2171
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:45,820
if the mind itself is compromised,
then you're not going to be able to do

2172
01:32:45,830 --> 01:32:46,930
all those things that you want to do.

2173
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:51,130
Gonna be able to appreciate life if you
don't remember where you are and you

2174
01:32:51,131 --> 01:32:54,430
don't know how to talk anymore.
And I was around people that I was

2175
01:32:54,431 --> 01:32:58,280
watching their ability to talk and
their,

2176
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:01,660
their cognitive function to k is
fighting is,

2177
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:06,010
it's glorious.
But you gotta know when to stop.

2178
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:08,140
You got to know when to stop.
And for me,

2179
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:11,800
when I was,
when I stopped as 1989 there was no ufc,

2180
01:33:11,801 --> 01:33:14,320
there was no money,
there was no money in kickboxing.

2181
01:33:14,580 --> 01:33:19,040
Like I think I got offered a fight for
500 bucks and that,

2182
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:20,980
that was a,
I was doing amateur fights and I got

2183
01:33:20,981 --> 01:33:23,710
offered a pro fight for like madmen 400
bucks.

2184
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:27,190
I don't remember how much it was,
but it was like what I was like,

2185
01:33:27,191 --> 01:33:30,040
that's crazy.
Like I'm going to train for months and

2186
01:33:30,041 --> 01:33:34,330
maybe get my ass kicked and maybe get
head kicked for like 400 bucks.

2187
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:38,110
And I was getting these headaches.
The headaches were bad man.

2188
01:33:38,590 --> 01:33:40,660
And uh,
so I just decided early on,

2189
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:43,630
if the UFC was around back then,
I'm most certain I would have pursued

2190
01:33:43,631 --> 01:33:45,700
it.
But glad it wasn't.

2191
01:33:45,910 --> 01:33:50,530
You did a whooper fans ass one time a
fan.

2192
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:53,050
Well not a fan.
A guy talking shit.

2193
01:33:53,230 --> 01:33:54,670
Oh,
the guy on fear factor?

2194
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:56,050
No,
I just grabbed him.

2195
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:57,520
He,
I thought he was gonna hit me.

2196
01:33:57,790 --> 01:33:59,480
I didn't hurt him.
No,

2197
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:02,500
he's [inaudible].
I just tied him up.

2198
01:34:02,670 --> 01:34:05,650
Damn Boy Thai clinch.
I was thinking of choking him,

2199
01:34:05,651 --> 01:34:07,570
but I was like,
I better not choke them because if I

2200
01:34:07,571 --> 01:34:08,670
choke him,
you know,

2201
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:10,870
maybe they could sue me.
So I just decided,

2202
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:15,220
I decided if I grab a hold of him and
grab him by the back of the head,

2203
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:19,270
he'll probably realized once I lock on
to him that he's pretty helpless and

2204
01:34:19,271 --> 01:34:20,860
he'll probably stop.
And he kind of did.

2205
01:34:21,040 --> 01:34:23,050
He kinda just flailed around a little
bit,

2206
01:34:23,051 --> 01:34:23,770
but he's like,
oh,

2207
01:34:23,770 --> 01:34:26,530
when someone grabs your neck,
there's something about controlling

2208
01:34:26,531 --> 01:34:27,850
someone's neck.
It's a very,

2209
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:29,740
it just does not feel good.

2210
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,050
You feel powerless.
You,

2211
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:38,770
that was a guy that he had attacked a
counselor before on another television

2212
01:34:38,771 --> 01:34:42,550
show and he had thrown his girlfriend to
the ground or his wife on another

2213
01:34:42,551 --> 01:34:45,760
television show.
And they had told me about him before he

2214
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:46,421
did the show.
They're like,

2215
01:34:46,421 --> 01:34:49,540
this guy's a series hothead.
We're thinking about not having him on

2216
01:34:49,541 --> 01:34:52,300
the show at all,
but we thought it'd be good drama just

2217
01:34:52,301 --> 01:34:56,650
but be careful.
And so he punched some God or she

2218
01:34:56,651 --> 01:35:01,040
punched some guy on the show and I said,
the wife punched the guy who was those

2219
01:35:01,041 --> 01:35:02,810
heckling him.
And I said,

2220
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,400
you can't hit someone.
I go,

2221
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:06,590
just because you hit your husband
doesn't mean you can hit other people.

2222
01:35:06,591 --> 01:35:10,040
And then the guy got in my face and
there's a lot of it,

2223
01:35:10,041 --> 01:35:11,990
there wasn't on film that they didn't
put on tv,

2224
01:35:11,991 --> 01:35:13,220
but I pushed him out of my face.

2225
01:35:13,220 --> 01:35:14,210
He goes,
don't touch me.

2226
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:15,140
And I said,
or what?

2227
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:17,030
Bitch,
what the fuck are you going to do?

2228
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:19,340
And he got in my face again and I pushed
him again.

2229
01:35:19,341 --> 01:35:21,080
And then I said,
this is just two,

2230
01:35:21,320 --> 01:35:22,670
two tents.
I go,

2231
01:35:22,671 --> 01:35:24,470
I'm just going to grab this guy.
I'm like,

2232
01:35:24,471 --> 01:35:27,580
I'm not getting punched in the face.
Cause sucker punches happening.

2233
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:31,610
And especially if you're not,
if you're not ready to get punched and

2234
01:35:31,611 --> 01:35:32,880
you get punched,
you can get fucked up.

2235
01:35:33,710 --> 01:35:35,390
Especially if you don't think someone's
going to punch you.

2236
01:35:35,391 --> 01:35:36,530
And then they do.
You know?

2237
01:35:36,531 --> 01:35:38,900
So I'm always thinking when someone
raises their voice,

2238
01:35:38,901 --> 01:35:41,510
they're ready to punch me.
So I'm just going to clamp down on this

2239
01:35:41,511 --> 01:35:43,160
dude's neck,
get ahold of them.

2240
01:35:43,190 --> 01:35:44,690
So I just grabbed him.
I didn't hurt him.

2241
01:35:45,140 --> 01:35:49,580
I was fucking man.
I always liked to when I was a fucking

2242
01:35:49,581 --> 01:35:52,790
Joe Rogan Fan,
he called the police on me though.

2243
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:54,240
The police had to go over the,
he,

2244
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,440
he would claimed I hit him.
He claimed a bunch of shit.

2245
01:35:56,450 --> 01:35:59,150
The police had to go over the videotape.
They had to show all the,

2246
01:35:59,151 --> 01:36:01,070
uh,
the footage from all the different

2247
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:02,000
cameras.
Yeah.

2248
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:05,120
I never really hit him and the fucking
real

2249
01:36:06,620 --> 01:36:08,150
man.
Fuck yeah,

2250
01:36:09,830 --> 01:36:10,663
yeah,
yeah.

2251
01:36:11,090 --> 01:36:14,810
You have a guys a challenge.
You'd have no social media.

2252
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:16,130
No.
No idiots.

2253
01:36:16,131 --> 01:36:18,080
Maybe friendly.
Yeah.

2254
01:36:18,200 --> 01:36:20,630
No,
but in real life,

2255
01:36:20,631 --> 01:36:22,250
when people meet me,
I'm always friendly.

2256
01:36:23,970 --> 01:36:28,180
It's so many idiots on social media.
There's a lot of guys have,

2257
01:36:28,350 --> 01:36:29,200
yeah.
Somebody,

2258
01:36:29,230 --> 01:36:31,210
oh,
I'll kick your well that's,

2259
01:36:31,211 --> 01:36:35,930
see that the idiots of the reasons why I
never was getting your information in

2260
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:37,250
the first place when you're reaching out
to me,

2261
01:36:37,251 --> 01:36:38,660
cause I'm not paying attention to
anything.

2262
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:41,480
Right.
If I dip my toes in the water

2263
01:36:41,481 --> 01:36:43,670
occasionally and like see what the
fuck's going on in the world,

2264
01:36:43,671 --> 01:36:44,570
like,
oh Whoa,

2265
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,610
fuck outta here.

2266
01:36:46,810 --> 01:36:47,600
Yeah.
It's,

2267
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,530
I've seen too many people,
it starts their day off in a bad way and

2268
01:36:51,531 --> 01:36:55,070
they get obsessed with it and they start
going battling back and forth with

2269
01:36:55,071 --> 01:36:56,870
people in the comments.
Guilty,

2270
01:36:58,910 --> 01:37:03,010
guilty as him up where I'm ask you and I
had the discussion.

2271
01:37:03,020 --> 01:37:04,940
You rang back and forth and people,
oh,

2272
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:08,630
so Joe Rogan has got some fucking fans,
man.

2273
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:13,070
They wanted their fucking string mine.
How dare you talk to Joe?

2274
01:37:13,071 --> 01:37:14,820
Like I said,
motherfucker,

2275
01:37:14,860 --> 01:37:18,050
this between me until the fuck you want
to jump in.

2276
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:20,030
Oh,
they won't get killed me and fucking

2277
01:37:20,031 --> 01:37:22,700
assassinate you want to make you feel
bad.

2278
01:37:22,701 --> 01:37:25,430
It's what they really want to do.
They want to figure out a way that they

2279
01:37:25,431 --> 01:37:29,570
can point out that you're wrong or make
you feel stupid or they just,

2280
01:37:29,870 --> 01:37:33,380
it's almost all of it.
Almost all of it is unhealthy people

2281
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,540
unhappy,
right?

2282
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:39,440
Maybe not bad people who are doing this,
but it's an unhealthy practice to just

2283
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:41,750
lash out.
This is not even people that are really

2284
01:37:41,751 --> 01:37:43,070
in your life.
It's one thing,

2285
01:37:43,071 --> 01:37:47,120
didn't have a debate about things.
And I think this is where we as human

2286
01:37:47,121 --> 01:37:50,570
beings have to learn how to use social
media better cause there's nothing wrong

2287
01:37:50,571 --> 01:37:53,990
and having discussions about things,
but you got to figure out a way to do it

2288
01:37:53,991 --> 01:37:56,580
where you're not just trying to
someone's feelings all the time and

2289
01:37:56,581 --> 01:37:58,500
lashing out because that's what a lot of
it is.

2290
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:02,880
It just bitter,
very small minded squabbling.

2291
01:38:02,910 --> 01:38:06,390
Even if you're using big words,
the intent behind it is very small

2292
01:38:06,391 --> 01:38:06,990
minded.

2293
01:38:06,990 --> 01:38:11,400
Exactly.
People see me videos of their work,

2294
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:15,810
their been working out all the time and
uh,

2295
01:38:16,710 --> 01:38:19,140
you know,
some of them are not doing it correctly.

2296
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,870
Right.
But I don't criticize people.

2297
01:38:21,900 --> 01:38:23,330
I never,
you know,

2298
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:26,400
because it really,
most important thing to me is that

2299
01:38:26,401 --> 01:38:28,740
they're trying,
they actually in the of trying to,

2300
01:38:28,741 --> 01:38:31,020
trying to do something,
but man,

2301
01:38:31,021 --> 01:38:34,020
the people,
other people don't look at it like that.

2302
01:38:34,370 --> 01:38:36,870
Oh you're fucked up.
You're doing that fucking wrong.

2303
01:38:36,871 --> 01:38:39,030
You're fucking why you don't know what
the fuck.

2304
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:41,790
They jumped on him immediately.
You know,

2305
01:38:41,791 --> 01:38:45,300
that they're trying to discourage them.
People that are at least trying to do

2306
01:38:45,301 --> 01:38:47,430
something,
they've tried to discourage him and he's

2307
01:38:47,431 --> 01:38:52,070
got so many fucking experts out there,
or are you not doing this correctly?

2308
01:38:52,071 --> 01:38:54,190
Your farm is fucked up.
I'm like,

2309
01:38:54,210 --> 01:38:55,500
man,
why?

2310
01:38:55,501 --> 01:38:56,400
Why do they,
I mean,

2311
01:38:56,401 --> 01:38:59,580
if you really want to do that,
then direct message to people,

2312
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:01,050
right?
If you're really trying to help him

2313
01:39:01,051 --> 01:39:02,010
direct message,
why,

2314
01:39:02,011 --> 01:39:04,170
why put it out there so everybody can
see it?

2315
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:06,030
You know,
you're just trying to draw attention to

2316
01:39:06,031 --> 01:39:07,590
yourself.
There's a lot of that.

2317
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,611
Oh,
so rod,

2318
01:39:08,611 --> 01:39:11,650
if they just want people to look at me,
I'm going to explain what the fuck I'm

2319
01:39:11,651 --> 01:39:13,290
doing.
Fuck them guys I don't like.

2320
01:39:13,640 --> 01:39:15,650
Yeah.
And it's what's interesting too about

2321
01:39:15,651 --> 01:39:20,420
exercises is there's some things that
are debatable in terms of the way to do

2322
01:39:20,421 --> 01:39:23,120
it and what not to do.
It does not necessarily always a

2323
01:39:23,121 --> 01:39:25,430
consensus about how someone's doing
something,

2324
01:39:25,431 --> 01:39:26,270
right?
Whether it's like,

2325
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:27,261
you know,
like,

2326
01:39:27,261 --> 01:39:30,170
uh,
there's just a lot of people online that

2327
01:39:30,171 --> 01:39:33,530
are just making a lot of noise.
It's hard to figure out who's right and

2328
01:39:33,531 --> 01:39:34,340
who's wrong.

2329
01:39:34,340 --> 01:39:35,380
Yeah.
I,

2330
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:38,300
I think it's only right and wrong for
you.

2331
01:39:38,360 --> 01:39:39,530
I mean,
you try.

2332
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:43,070
If Joe Rogan tells me I had to do
something a certain way and I try it and

2333
01:39:43,071 --> 01:39:44,210
it works for me,
then I'm fucking,

2334
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:45,560
I'm going to do it right.
I,

2335
01:39:45,561 --> 01:39:47,720
if it works for me,
if it works for me,

2336
01:39:47,721 --> 01:39:51,170
because we all are so goddamn different,
it's like we're not,

2337
01:39:51,260 --> 01:39:54,410
nobody's exactly the same.
So when somebody,

2338
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:55,393
somebody says,
Hey,

2339
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:57,770
if now somebody says they got the
perfect routine,

2340
01:39:58,010 --> 01:39:59,330
it's going to work for every fucking
body,

2341
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,310
then that guy,
you gotta be Lyria,

2342
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:04,350
he's going shit,
because nobody has one routine is going

2343
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:06,350
to work for every fucking buy.
It's just impossible.

2344
01:40:06,351 --> 01:40:07,490
It's not going to happen.
Yeah,

2345
01:40:07,491 --> 01:40:08,260
I agree.

2346
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:11,380
I think especially,
it's really interesting with mma because

2347
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:15,730
the fact that hoists gracie bursts on
the scene in 1990 3000 not that long

2348
01:40:15,731 --> 01:40:16,511
ago,
right?

2349
01:40:16,511 --> 01:40:20,050
I mean that's really 24 years is not a
lot of prep time.

2350
01:40:20,051 --> 01:40:24,460
It's just too similar or it's too close.
And so there's all these different

2351
01:40:24,461 --> 01:40:28,690
methods that have been sort of devised
along the way and nobody really,

2352
01:40:28,720 --> 01:40:30,340
I mean,
until someone comes along the real,

2353
01:40:30,341 --> 01:40:32,080
you know,
someone's like an Anderson Silva that's

2354
01:40:32,081 --> 01:40:34,630
like super successful doing it one way,
and then you go,

2355
01:40:34,631 --> 01:40:35,860
well,
how the fuck is he doing it?

2356
01:40:35,890 --> 01:40:36,790
We've got to do it his way.
Yeah.

2357
01:40:36,791 --> 01:40:38,020
But you're not him.
Right?

2358
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:39,790
Like maybe you started out as a
wrestler,

2359
01:40:39,791 --> 01:40:42,130
whereas he's a Moyie Thai guy.
Maybe it works good for him,

2360
01:40:42,131 --> 01:40:46,210
but maybe you need a different approach
and nobody really knows how to do it for

2361
01:40:46,211 --> 01:40:48,190
you.
You have to kind of figure out your own

2362
01:40:48,191 --> 01:40:52,870
way when you've got to hone it and tweak
it along the way while you're competing.

2363
01:40:52,871 --> 01:40:53,560
So,
yeah,

2364
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:54,250
it's hard.

2365
01:40:54,250 --> 01:40:55,083
Yeah.
Well,

2366
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:56,130
the,
the rule,

2367
01:40:56,131 --> 01:40:58,270
uh,
innovators that are real guys,

2368
01:40:58,271 --> 01:40:59,140
it didn't,
you know,

2369
01:40:59,590 --> 01:41:02,230
they,
I'm sure that they did that.

2370
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:02,870
They,
they,

2371
01:41:02,870 --> 01:41:04,800
they're not trying to copy.
Yeah.

2372
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:08,440
It's so important to be an original,
uh,

2373
01:41:08,441 --> 01:41:09,850
at Danny.
Anything.

2374
01:41:09,851 --> 01:41:13,060
I mean,
it was set out to try to beat Joe Rogan.

2375
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,670
You're gonna fail motherfucking cousin,
April one,

2376
01:41:15,671 --> 01:41:19,390
Joe Rogan.
And he and so try,

2377
01:41:19,530 --> 01:41:21,820
I tell him he's got no time.
He sees me.

2378
01:41:21,821 --> 01:41:24,010
I want to be just like,
you don't be just like me,

2379
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:26,950
my damn self,
you know,

2380
01:41:26,951 --> 01:41:28,030
be yourself,
man.

2381
01:41:28,031 --> 01:41:30,100
Be,
don't try and beat just like Joe Rogan

2382
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:30,941
be.
You said,

2383
01:41:30,941 --> 01:41:33,100
cause you can't be doing,
it's hard to tell

2384
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,300
people that though.
If you,

2385
01:41:34,301 --> 01:41:37,870
if you see someone who inspires you and
you admire them and you want to do what

2386
01:41:37,871 --> 01:41:38,740
they're doing,
it's,

2387
01:41:38,741 --> 01:41:41,830
it's hard.
But everybody starts out in the

2388
01:41:41,831 --> 01:41:43,570
beginning,
like special in.

2389
01:41:43,571 --> 01:41:45,370
You're a young person.
When you admire someone,

2390
01:41:45,371 --> 01:41:47,860
you kind of copy a lot of their
mannerisms and the way they do it.

2391
01:41:47,861 --> 01:41:49,780
But eventually you've got to find
yourself.

2392
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:50,830
Oh yeah,
definitely.

2393
01:41:50,831 --> 01:41:52,030
I mean,
I used to go around,

2394
01:41:52,060 --> 01:41:52,893
uh,
uh,

2395
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,480
uh,
float like a butterfly back.

2396
01:41:55,481 --> 01:41:56,340
Muhammad Ali.
Oh,

2397
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,060
I was my home and I read when I was a
kid,

2398
01:41:58,061 --> 01:41:58,720
man,
I want to do,

2399
01:41:58,720 --> 01:41:59,860
you know,
I wanted to be him.

2400
01:41:59,861 --> 01:42:03,350
And then I wanted to be Bruce Lee and I
got into fucking,

2401
01:42:03,351 --> 01:42:04,500
uh,
term,

2402
01:42:04,550 --> 01:42:06,160
uh,
point karate,

2403
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,490
you know,
point turning tournament.

2404
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:09,310
Oh yeah.
Joe Brooks.

2405
01:42:09,311 --> 01:42:10,420
He didn't know that.
No,

2406
01:42:10,421 --> 01:42:13,600
I didn't know it was a point fighter and
I came very close.

2407
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:16,170
Uh,
Goddamn Typo,

2408
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:19,610
typo billy blanks.
Every planes came very close to find a

2409
01:42:19,690 --> 01:42:23,590
billy blanks in the long beach arena.
Uh,

2410
01:42:23,980 --> 01:42:27,460
ed Parker's Kenpo karate put on the
international rights EMC baby.

2411
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,980
Yeah.
And I was very close to find billy

2412
01:42:29,981 --> 01:42:32,700
blanks and I,
every time I see billy now say,

2413
01:42:32,701 --> 01:42:34,450
hey billy,
I thank you so much.

2414
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,850
Cause the guy when I seen the finals,
billy,

2415
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:37,890
fuck that guy up.

2416
01:42:37,990 --> 01:42:41,230
He was supposed to be point and he
knocked him my fucking house.

2417
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:42,400
Or Billy,
you know,

2418
01:42:42,401 --> 01:42:46,120
fought even in point.
Like they would hit each other hard.

2419
01:42:46,150 --> 01:42:47,130
Oh hell.
You know.

2420
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:50,890
And Billy was knocked out before two
people got knocked out.

2421
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:53,230
I know,
I know.

2422
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:55,720
They made them fight after they got
knocked out.

2423
01:42:56,260 --> 01:42:58,180
Nobody knew any better.
Brown yourself back.

2424
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,940
Revive yourself and getting,
keep fighting,

2425
01:43:00,941 --> 01:43:01,774
man.
Yeah,

2426
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:02,920
it was,
it was,

2427
01:43:02,921 --> 01:43:04,270
uh,
it was pretty good.

2428
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:06,070
I look good.
I love Marshall,

2429
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:09,160
but my favorite sport,
I think bar none in Nepal or not

2430
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:12,460
overweight lifting and mma is getting
really close.

2431
01:43:12,461 --> 01:43:14,350
It was really close,
but I think he's boxing.

2432
01:43:14,770 --> 01:43:16,300
He loved boxing going,
Oh,

2433
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,140
I love it.
I love it.

2434
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:20,770
What's your favorite fighter deal face?
Ooh Man.

2435
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:22,270
Ooh,
that's,

2436
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:24,080
that's really hard.
Uh,

2437
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,390
as a,
uh,

2438
01:43:25,510 --> 01:43:26,291
a role,
minor,

2439
01:43:26,291 --> 01:43:31,240
I guess a Muhammad Ali would be my
favorite block as a role model,

2440
01:43:31,241 --> 01:43:33,520
but not because of what he did in the
ring.

2441
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:38,880
It's more so because of what he did
outside the ring is why I hold him in

2442
01:43:38,891 --> 01:43:42,430
such high regard.
But Roy Jones Jr course,

2443
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:44,380
Mike Tyson,
but Roy Jones.

2444
01:43:44,470 --> 01:43:45,670
Oh my God.
It's prime.

2445
01:43:45,671 --> 01:43:47,680
There was nobody like Roy.
Oh,

2446
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:50,530
on a completely different level.
He wasn't even Javin.

2447
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,400
He was in with a left hook and he was
most career too.

2448
01:43:54,410 --> 01:43:56,010
Oh yeah.
And it's,

2449
01:43:56,070 --> 01:43:59,040
it was weird shaped.
His biceps were giant,

2450
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:02,370
but he has a small triceps biceps with
Jack.

2451
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,940
He went all the way up to heavyweight.
Remember that?

2452
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:08,030
And won beat John Ruiz.
The heavyweight title too.

2453
01:44:08,031 --> 01:44:10,170
I remember.
You don't want to talk about boxing.

2454
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:11,761
Yeah,
yeah.

2455
01:44:11,761 --> 01:44:13,940
Go Man.
I'm all fucking boxing,

2456
01:44:14,690 --> 01:44:15,770
man.
Really?

2457
01:44:16,100 --> 01:44:17,330
Well,
I'm a fan of boxing too.

2458
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:19,790
You know,
even though a woman made your number one

2459
01:44:19,791 --> 01:44:20,590
though,
right?

2460
01:44:20,590 --> 01:44:25,030
Like mma better because anything can
happen.

2461
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,270
You can get head kicked.
He get kicked down,

2462
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:28,031
strangled.
There's,

2463
01:44:28,031 --> 01:44:29,470
to me,
there's so many possibilities that it's

2464
01:44:29,471 --> 01:44:31,610
more complicated.
What I call him and May I see,

2465
01:44:31,700 --> 01:44:35,650
I'll call it high level problem solving
with dire physical consequences.

2466
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:36,490
Ooh,

2467
01:44:36,490 --> 01:44:38,020
that's what it is.
X for days,

2468
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,700
these tools,
you have all these tools.

2469
01:44:40,701 --> 01:44:42,980
He has all these tools.
You'd go in there and you try to figure

2470
01:44:42,981 --> 01:44:45,770
out who's got the best approach and
who's going to be able to use their

2471
01:44:45,771 --> 01:44:47,150
body,
who's going to be able to use their

2472
01:44:47,151 --> 01:44:48,170
talent,
their skill,

2473
01:44:48,171 --> 01:44:50,390
their dedication.
Who's going to be able to figure out a

2474
01:44:50,391 --> 01:44:51,470
way to solve your problem?

2475
01:44:51,790 --> 01:44:53,790
Wow.
What do you think about nate bees?

2476
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:55,970
It's a bad motherfucker.
I love fucking,

2477
01:44:56,790 --> 01:45:00,130
and I met him at a,
at a fight in UFC fight.

2478
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:04,510
He was the humblest.
It was so nice.

2479
01:45:04,860 --> 01:45:05,780
And he goes,
you know,

2480
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:08,020
I'm not,
I'm not fucking Jack like you,

2481
01:45:08,021 --> 01:45:12,330
but I do my pig.
Like fucking you are fucking killer man.

2482
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:14,250
He's a great guy,
but he's another,

2483
01:45:14,460 --> 01:45:15,370
he's another guy.

2484
01:45:15,450 --> 01:45:19,440
It was a perfect example of how you
can't make everyone trained the same

2485
01:45:19,441 --> 01:45:20,730
way.
He's incredibly successful,

2486
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:23,250
but a lot of his training is not weight
lifting here.

2487
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:27,480
He does triathlons,
does his Jujitsu and it's kickbox

2488
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:29,070
singing all the other stuff.
But on top of that,

2489
01:45:29,071 --> 01:45:30,960
like he does crazy endurance work.

2490
01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:33,330
Yeah.
Nick and nick.

2491
01:45:33,331 --> 01:45:34,930
Amy,
I love brothers,

2492
01:45:34,950 --> 01:45:36,160
man.
Yeah.

2493
01:45:36,180 --> 01:45:38,790
I may have to King Mo.
Uh,

2494
01:45:38,820 --> 01:45:42,270
he was real cool.
A lot of guys at fights.

2495
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:43,740
Uh,
uh,

2496
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:47,190
the most famous referee,
big John McCarthy,

2497
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:49,320
McCarthy,
excellent guy.

2498
01:45:49,730 --> 01:45:51,590
Uh,
he was really friendly.

2499
01:45:51,610 --> 01:45:54,030
I was a very good guy.
Trying to think.

2500
01:45:54,120 --> 01:45:56,970
I didn't,
I couldn't really figure out why the guy

2501
01:45:56,971 --> 01:45:59,130
liked me so much.
George Saint Pierre,

2502
01:45:59,131 --> 01:46:01,410
he said,
I want you to make a special,

2503
01:46:01,430 --> 01:46:03,860
uh,
a video for me before.

2504
01:46:03,870 --> 01:46:06,170
It's one of one of his big fights.
So I'm going to,

2505
01:46:06,171 --> 01:46:10,080
I'm spitting all over the mic and shit.
Fucking hardcore.

2506
01:46:10,380 --> 01:46:13,140
And then he made a video back for me the
game.

2507
01:46:13,141 --> 01:46:16,140
I had his fucking fuck George Saint
Pierre had his fucking phone number,

2508
01:46:16,141 --> 01:46:17,140
man.
He calls me and says,

2509
01:46:17,141 --> 01:46:17,940
ct,
I want,

2510
01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:19,560
can you do a one arm pull up?
I said,

2511
01:46:19,561 --> 01:46:20,670
no,
I can't do what he said,

2512
01:46:20,671 --> 01:46:22,950
I can't eat.
Let's see who could be the first one to

2513
01:46:22,951 --> 01:46:26,540
do a one arm pull.
I say your own George t t.

2514
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:27,713
And I'm like,
I don't,

2515
01:46:27,720 --> 01:46:29,030
I don't know.
Uh,

2516
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,350
I couldn't really,
uh,

2517
01:46:31,530 --> 01:46:36,160
understand why fighters like me so much.
I couldn't understand why he didn't like

2518
01:46:36,161 --> 01:46:37,980
me.
So fighters need motivation,

2519
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:40,200
man.
I guess what it is.

2520
01:46:40,201 --> 01:46:41,034
Yeah,

2521
01:46:41,140 --> 01:46:42,190
that's a big part of it.
Well,

2522
01:46:42,191 --> 01:46:43,930
because you're real,
you're 100% real.

2523
01:46:43,931 --> 01:46:44,950
You are,
you are who you are.

2524
01:46:44,951 --> 01:46:49,000
You don't put on any false airs.
But also inspiration is critical for

2525
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,370
cause.
They're always tired.

2526
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:53,510
They're always trying to find the energy
to keep going.

2527
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,000
They're always trying to find that that
pushed to get up and keep going.

2528
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:01,500
When you're two months into camp and
every day is a grind and you're just

2529
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:03,000
exhausted,
you know,

2530
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:05,670
and it's repetitive there.
You're constantly drilling,

2531
01:47:05,671 --> 01:47:07,470
constantly sparring,
strength and conditioning.

2532
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:08,490
You're swimming,
you're running,

2533
01:47:08,491 --> 01:47:09,450
you're doing this,
you doing that,

2534
01:47:09,720 --> 01:47:10,553
and then the,
the,

2535
01:47:10,580 --> 01:47:15,030
the impending moment of that fight is
constantly looming in the background of

2536
01:47:15,031 --> 01:47:16,830
your life.
There's no escape from it.

2537
01:47:16,831 --> 01:47:21,180
And like you need like sometimes you
need like a ct Fletcher video to get you

2538
01:47:21,181 --> 01:47:21,790
over the hump.

2539
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:23,600
Wow.
I guess I,

2540
01:47:23,601 --> 01:47:28,601
I mean I could,
I have the utmost respect for fighters,

2541
01:47:29,590 --> 01:47:32,830
boxers and or mma guys especially,
I mean,

2542
01:47:33,250 --> 01:47:37,630
anybody is,
I'm going to be the guy who gets knocked

2543
01:47:37,631 --> 01:47:41,200
out every time he steps in.
I respect the fuck out of him because he

2544
01:47:41,201 --> 01:47:45,460
had the testicular fortitude to step
through the fucking gate man and get in

2545
01:47:45,461 --> 01:47:47,740
there and actually do,
do you know Joe?

2546
01:47:47,770 --> 01:47:48,670
I know,
you know,

2547
01:47:48,750 --> 01:47:53,750
but people don't understand how much it
takes to just take that trip down in

2548
01:47:56,590 --> 01:48:00,550
actually getting that cage and face
another man who's trying to take your

2549
01:48:00,551 --> 01:48:03,970
fucking head off.
That takes a tremendous,

2550
01:48:04,150 --> 01:48:09,150
I remember how much you took fighting at
the long beach arena and just the crowd

2551
01:48:11,171 --> 01:48:13,540
there.
And I know there's nothing compared to

2552
01:48:13,541 --> 01:48:15,700
him.
He may cry in the half people.

2553
01:48:15,880 --> 01:48:17,980
That crowd makes a big fucking
difference.

2554
01:48:18,790 --> 01:48:21,040
It makes it,
I got so fucking nervous,

2555
01:48:21,310 --> 01:48:25,110
everything that I had learned,
I fucking forgot.

2556
01:48:25,310 --> 01:48:27,370
As soon as it got kicked me upside the
head,

2557
01:48:27,490 --> 01:48:30,220
I forgot her every fucking,
every quarter,

2558
01:48:30,280 --> 01:48:32,860
all that shit went right out the window.
And I went and tried to kill,

2559
01:48:33,210 --> 01:48:35,830
I forgot everything.
And I went straight to compton there.

2560
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:38,770
I forgot all my cards and everything,
man.

2561
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:39,900
And,
and I,

2562
01:48:40,470 --> 01:48:43,360
it's,
it takes a tremendous,

2563
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:48,400
and that's why I respect the guy so much
because I have an inkling of an idea.

2564
01:48:48,401 --> 01:48:50,230
I don't have a real idea cause I ain't
never done this.

2565
01:48:50,470 --> 01:48:55,470
But I have an inkling of an idea of what
it takes to actually get into an octagon

2566
01:48:55,780 --> 01:48:59,720
and before all those downs of people and
put when the millions of people watching

2567
01:48:59,740 --> 01:49:03,140
on TV and perform.
Oh yeah.

2568
01:49:03,820 --> 01:49:07,620
And rise and rise.
He can sit fucking case

2569
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:12,020
guys actually literally fight better
than they train better inside the cage.

2570
01:49:12,021 --> 01:49:15,320
And then there's the rare human being
that when the chips are down,

2571
01:49:15,321 --> 01:49:18,050
when it's difficult,
when the situation is intense pressure,

2572
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,190
they shine.

2573
01:49:19,600 --> 01:49:22,430
Why are at their best?
Do you have a problem?

2574
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:25,130
Uh,
do you think you would have a problem in

2575
01:49:25,131 --> 01:49:28,460
your youth?
If you got a guy in trouble to pound on

2576
01:49:28,461 --> 01:49:29,294
that guy?

2577
01:49:29,970 --> 01:49:32,910
It's hard if you've been hurt before and
you know what you're doing and the guy,

2578
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:34,740
you know,
I think a lot of guys get very upset

2579
01:49:34,741 --> 01:49:37,590
when the referee doesn't stop the fight
in time.

2580
01:49:37,650 --> 01:49:39,870
And I think for good reason,
like they'll look at the referee then

2581
01:49:39,871 --> 01:49:40,740
and go,
what the fuck?

2582
01:49:41,070 --> 01:49:42,420
How many times you want me to hit this
dude?

2583
01:49:42,480 --> 01:49:45,690
Man,
he's barely defending himself.

2584
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:47,830
Obviously he's out.
But you know,

2585
01:49:47,831 --> 01:49:49,980
in the moment,
in the heat of the battle and you,

2586
01:49:49,981 --> 01:49:51,670
you catch someone,
you're smashing him,

2587
01:49:51,671 --> 01:49:52,750
you know,
it's like,

2588
01:49:53,050 --> 01:49:56,200
uh,
I think it also depends on what,

2589
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,810
how you feel about that person.
Like the recent fight between,

2590
01:49:58,811 --> 01:49:59,590
uh,
uh,

2591
01:49:59,590 --> 01:50:03,160
Tj dillashaw and cody Garbrandt,
they had this intense and tense feud.

2592
01:50:03,460 --> 01:50:04,950
And then finally,
um,

2593
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,820
tj catches him,
hurts him,

2594
01:50:06,850 --> 01:50:08,680
drops of,
and then puts him out and you could tell

2595
01:50:08,681 --> 01:50:10,960
when he smashed it and when he's out,
you know,

2596
01:50:10,961 --> 01:50:13,130
he's not,
he's not thinking good things about

2597
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:14,770
lifting off the game.
No,

2598
01:50:14,830 --> 01:50:17,050
he's trying to kill him.
And then when cody got up and he was

2599
01:50:17,051 --> 01:50:20,830
just still days and t j's in his face
screaming in his face,

2600
01:50:21,530 --> 01:50:22,240
the,
the,

2601
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:24,090
there's nothing like fighting.
It's like,

2602
01:50:24,570 --> 01:50:25,470
no,
like any others

2603
01:50:25,560 --> 01:50:26,170
for,
um,

2604
01:50:26,170 --> 01:50:27,060
I,
uh,

2605
01:50:27,120 --> 01:50:32,120
talked to a UFC fighter I'm at,
and I'm not gonna mention his name

2606
01:50:32,761 --> 01:50:33,750
because I think,
yeah,

2607
01:50:33,820 --> 01:50:36,150
I don't know if he wants me to or not,
so I'm not going to do it.

2608
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:39,960
But he told me that he goes into some
fights,

2609
01:50:39,961 --> 01:50:43,680
not all of them having a real fear of
hurting his opponent.

2610
01:50:44,490 --> 01:50:49,490
And I think it's really hard to do your
absolute best when you have that fear

2611
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:51,990
of,
of,

2612
01:50:51,990 --> 01:50:53,760
you know,
doing real damage.

2613
01:50:53,761 --> 01:50:55,680
To your point,
I think it's one more element.

2614
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:59,340
Think this guy,
I think he would be a champion.

2615
01:50:59,610 --> 01:51:03,870
If you completely get rid of there,
it's very hard.

2616
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:07,590
But when you're going in the ring
hoping,

2617
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:10,260
I mean in your Aco job,
Brian,

2618
01:51:10,290 --> 01:51:14,580
to stop this guy to stop you up on it.
And if you're going in and hoping that

2619
01:51:14,581 --> 01:51:16,880
you don't hurt him,
then he,

2620
01:51:16,980 --> 01:51:21,210
I don't think you can perform to the
utmost capabilities if that's,

2621
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:22,230
you know,
a really,

2622
01:51:22,550 --> 01:51:24,570
uh,
foremost in your mind and I don't want

2623
01:51:24,571 --> 01:51:25,280
to hurt this.

2624
01:51:25,280 --> 01:51:26,960
Yeah.
I think fighters only have a certain

2625
01:51:26,961 --> 01:51:31,160
amount of time they can compete as well
for the overwhelming reality of what

2626
01:51:31,161 --> 01:51:32,450
they're doing.
Set Tent.

2627
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:35,630
I mean the beginning,
when they're 19 2021,

2628
01:51:35,631 --> 01:51:39,320
they're just fucking full of piss and
vinegar and shit and lightning and

2629
01:51:39,321 --> 01:51:41,790
kicking people in the head and just,
yeah,

2630
01:51:42,090 --> 01:51:44,510
it's just chaos.
And then as time goes on,

2631
01:51:44,511 --> 01:51:46,500
you deal with your own injuries.
You,

2632
01:51:46,580 --> 01:51:51,580
you start to see people just suffer the
repercussions of a career in combat

2633
01:51:52,191 --> 01:51:53,990
sports.
And then as you get older,

2634
01:51:53,991 --> 01:51:56,870
you just realize like,
what this is really that you're doing.

2635
01:51:56,970 --> 01:51:59,280
So you think rumble Johnson was really
smart.

2636
01:51:59,730 --> 01:52:00,563
I think ramp,
well

2637
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:04,590
rumble is the scariest fucking guy at
two oh five pounds.

2638
01:52:04,650 --> 01:52:05,790
Terrifying.
Right.

2639
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:08,310
And then decides after a world title vi
like,

2640
01:52:08,490 --> 01:52:11,280
I don't want to do this.
I don't want to hug do's.

2641
01:52:11,281 --> 01:52:12,480
Get hit in the head.
He goes,

2642
01:52:12,481 --> 01:52:13,670
I'm not really a fighter.
He goes to,

2643
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:16,050
as a really good athlete,
I'm preaching real good at it.

2644
01:52:16,230 --> 01:52:17,120
Take it easy everybody,

2645
01:52:17,530 --> 01:52:18,363
man.
Uh,

2646
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:22,660
you know,
I talked to Ron on social media back and

2647
01:52:22,661 --> 01:52:25,510
forth,
really cool kid very early too,

2648
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:29,040
and I respect the fuck out his dcs.
Yeah.

2649
01:52:29,050 --> 01:52:31,600
And I respect him,
but he's talked about coming back now.

2650
01:52:31,620 --> 01:52:32,180
Yeah.
Yeah.

2651
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:33,380
Well,
I mean it's,

2652
01:52:33,540 --> 01:52:38,160
I'm sure that some of them is going to
make him an offer he can't refuse then

2653
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:40,340
he's very marketable.
I'll tell you that.

2654
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:41,710
Yeah.
They do what he can do.

2655
01:52:41,711 --> 01:52:44,800
The people destroyed.
GTFO man,

2656
01:52:44,801 --> 01:52:46,760
just fucking be strong.
He's a good,

2657
01:52:46,770 --> 01:52:47,180
uh,

2658
01:52:47,180 --> 01:52:48,290
examples.
Also,

2659
01:52:48,291 --> 01:52:50,810
if someone who cut weight when they
shouldn't have,

2660
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:53,870
I hate weight cutting.
I think it's the worst thing that

2661
01:52:53,871 --> 01:52:56,140
fighters do to themselves.
I think it's even worse than finding

2662
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,500
these guys that get organ failure.
A woman just died in Australia who was

2663
01:53:00,501 --> 01:53:02,450
cutting weight for an amateur kickboxing
fine.

2664
01:53:02,930 --> 01:53:05,810
It's just a terrible,
terrible practice that people do.

2665
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:08,360
But he was one of the biggest weight
cutters ever.

2666
01:53:08,361 --> 01:53:11,000
He was like,
well over 200 pounds getting down to one

2667
01:53:11,001 --> 01:53:13,940
70 and when he was at one 70 he was
smashing people.

2668
01:53:13,941 --> 01:53:17,270
Yeah.
But as long as it was quick because you

2669
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:20,450
write dehydrated himself so bad that
when he gets into the third,

2670
01:53:20,451 --> 01:53:22,340
fourth and fifth round,
he just had nothing left.

2671
01:53:22,341 --> 01:53:25,430
He just was so drained at heavyweight,
he will be fucked.

2672
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:26,333
Terrified.
Terror,

2673
01:53:26,360 --> 01:53:27,760
terror,
terror.

2674
01:53:28,140 --> 01:53:29,620
Oh my God.
Yeah.

2675
01:53:30,090 --> 01:53:31,560
Yeah.
If he really wants to do it,

2676
01:53:31,830 --> 01:53:33,720
maybe he just needed a break.
I mean who knows?

2677
01:53:34,110 --> 01:53:37,920
Sometimes guys just need to take some
time off and he's gonna offer him,

2678
01:53:37,921 --> 01:53:41,980
cause he's a very marketable,
I think he's in the weed business now.

2679
01:53:42,480 --> 01:53:47,480
I did see a rumble puppies or to
grabbing a few things going on.

2680
01:53:50,641 --> 01:53:51,630
Yeah,
he's got a candle.

2681
01:53:51,690 --> 01:53:52,560
Yeah.
Yeah.

2682
01:53:52,561 --> 01:53:53,280
He's involved

2683
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:57,240
some businesses and you know,
he's obviously not damaged like when you

2684
01:53:57,250 --> 01:54:01,200
talked and he's totally,
totally there.

2685
01:54:01,350 --> 01:54:04,110
He's not suffered the damage that a lot
of fighters have suffered.

2686
01:54:04,111 --> 01:54:08,310
So if he did decide to get out,
now he's at a good place in his life

2687
01:54:08,311 --> 01:54:09,031
where he's,
you know,

2688
01:54:09,031 --> 01:54:12,570
he's accomplished a lot and he's also,
he's going to walk away unscathed.

2689
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:13,950
Yeah.
As long as he,

2690
01:54:13,960 --> 01:54:16,820
you know,
can make money doing other shit.

2691
01:54:16,821 --> 01:54:18,860
I don't see,
he would just touch people.

2692
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,680
Yeah.
And he would see the lights go out.

2693
01:54:21,710 --> 01:54:23,750
Oh my God.
Like glow over to sheriff.

2694
01:54:23,790 --> 01:54:25,310
Oh,
nobody ever did that to clover.

2695
01:54:25,311 --> 01:54:28,760
Like upper cut and it's over.
It's over.

2696
01:54:28,790 --> 01:54:29,670
Go home.
Yeah.

2697
01:54:30,290 --> 01:54:32,000
Yeah.
I want to see him punch that thing that

2698
01:54:32,001 --> 01:54:34,550
Francis and gone no punches.
He might be right up there with Francis.

2699
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:37,340
I would like to see yeah.
To Randall's and terrifying

2700
01:54:37,390 --> 01:54:38,223
human.
Yeah.

2701
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:39,340
Terrifying.
There's a,

2702
01:54:39,350 --> 01:54:40,183
you know,
it's,

2703
01:54:40,300 --> 01:54:41,740
it's a very,
um,

2704
01:54:42,250 --> 01:54:45,130
it's a very interesting sport to fall
because there's so many exceptional

2705
01:54:45,131 --> 01:54:47,610
human beings that are competing in this
thing that,

2706
01:54:47,611 --> 01:54:50,950
that are involved in this high level
problem solving event.

2707
01:54:50,980 --> 01:54:53,710
It's just,
you see these human beings that are

2708
01:54:53,711 --> 01:54:55,210
pushing themselves,
their mind,

2709
01:54:55,211 --> 01:54:57,160
their bodies to such extreme limits that
it's,

2710
01:54:57,161 --> 01:54:59,200
uh,
it's very valuable for people.

2711
01:54:59,230 --> 01:54:59,771
Much.
Like I say,

2712
01:54:59,771 --> 01:55:02,590
your videos are very valuable.
It's very valuable for people to be able

2713
01:55:02,591 --> 01:55:04,570
to watch someone competing at
[inaudible]

2714
01:55:04,750 --> 01:55:08,530
high level
paper.

2715
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:09,590
Who Neck?
Man,

2716
01:55:09,591 --> 01:55:11,860
if I ain't there in person,
I'm buying anything.

2717
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,400
I won't miss it.
Yeah,

2718
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:18,401
me too.
Did He fucking say me too?

2719
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:22,100
It's true,
but I am a fan at all of them,

2720
01:55:22,101 --> 01:55:23,330
man.
Not at all of them

2721
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:29,000
than ever before.
I have seen a couple of North American

2722
01:55:29,001 --> 01:55:33,160
paper views
really as too much traveling man flying

2723
01:55:33,170 --> 01:55:37,550
Australia and shit breaks you down.
I couldn't,

2724
01:55:37,670 --> 01:55:40,070
yeah,
I couldn't imagine because like before I

2725
01:55:40,071 --> 01:55:43,230
had the heart attack,
I was traveling every weekend.

2726
01:55:43,231 --> 01:55:44,130
I'm in a different city,

2727
01:55:44,130 --> 01:55:44,963
man.
Yeah,

2728
01:55:44,980 --> 01:55:48,210
I have rarely.
It will really run you the fuck down.

2729
01:55:48,230 --> 01:55:50,540
Yeah,
but I know my travel schedule,

2730
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:52,290
we had to be nothing compared to yours,

2731
01:55:52,720 --> 01:55:56,260
but one year it was a rough one year I
think I did 24 events.

2732
01:55:56,320 --> 01:55:59,380
That was the most I ever did at 22 or 24
and it was crazy.

2733
01:55:59,381 --> 01:56:02,380
It was like every other weekend I was
flying somewhere and wow.

2734
01:56:02,440 --> 01:56:07,440
That was before someone else started
doing like picking up some of the work,

2735
01:56:07,571 --> 01:56:11,170
like the UFC then hired a second
commentary team and they started doing

2736
01:56:11,171 --> 01:56:13,960
the Fox sports events and different
events.

2737
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:16,000
Yeah,
you gotta have his shit going too.

2738
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:18,000
And I have a family,
you know,

2739
01:56:18,001 --> 01:56:20,410
and have some time for all that shit.
But I'd still enjoy it.

2740
01:56:20,470 --> 01:56:21,910
I still love it.
Of course we're fine.

2741
01:56:22,010 --> 01:56:23,110
How,
how many uh,

2742
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:23,840
uh,
uh,

2743
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:26,150
comedian gigs do you do?

2744
01:56:26,410 --> 01:56:27,790
Well,
I work all the time.

2745
01:56:27,791 --> 01:56:30,580
Like I'm working tonight.
I'm at the comedy store tonight.

2746
01:56:30,610 --> 01:56:32,230
I'm working tomorrow,
this weekend.

2747
01:56:32,231 --> 01:56:35,440
I'm working in Detroit.
The night before the UFC I got a couple

2748
01:56:35,441 --> 01:56:37,720
shows in Detroit,
so I'm always doing stand up.

2749
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:40,810
Stand up is like in a lot of ways like,
um,

2750
01:56:41,170 --> 01:56:43,510
like an athletic event and that you have
to be in shape for it.

2751
01:56:43,900 --> 01:56:45,790
He can't get out of shape.
If you get a shape,

2752
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:47,090
you'll,
you'll build rusty up there.

2753
01:56:47,091 --> 01:56:48,490
And how you deal with hecklers,
John,

2754
01:56:48,790 --> 01:56:53,050
just shutting down
most of the time you'd,

2755
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:55,060
you know,
most people don't heckle.

2756
01:56:55,120 --> 01:57:00,120
It's the rare dummy out.
Once a bark at you will get them rear

2757
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:03,430
dummy up our rear dummy everywhere
dummies exists.

2758
01:57:03,440 --> 01:57:04,870
Map they do.
So listen,

2759
01:57:04,871 --> 01:57:06,340
brother,
I gotta wrap this up,

2760
01:57:06,341 --> 01:57:08,810
but okay.
I wish you the best and I'm,

2761
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:11,410
I really appreciate you coming here and
I'm really excited that we got a chance

2762
01:57:11,411 --> 01:57:12,970
to talk and what I said,
what I said.

2763
01:57:12,971 --> 01:57:14,650
I really mean,
I think you're very valuable.

2764
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,450
You know,
I think what you've done is,

2765
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:18,640
I mean,
I know it just kind of came to you out

2766
01:57:18,641 --> 01:57:21,280
of nowhere by accident,
but I think you've helped a tremendous

2767
01:57:21,281 --> 01:57:23,080
amount of people and I know you've
helped me.

2768
01:57:23,550 --> 01:57:27,030
Oh Man,
I appreciate that so much and I

2769
01:57:27,031 --> 01:57:29,340
appreciate the opportunity to be on your
show.

2770
01:57:29,341 --> 01:57:33,600
I feel like I finally made it on the Joe
Rogan experience.

2771
01:57:33,760 --> 01:57:34,481
Well,
listen man,

2772
01:57:34,481 --> 01:57:36,940
keep us posted with your,
your health and uh,

2773
01:57:36,970 --> 01:57:38,500
you know,
we're gonna send you all the best

2774
01:57:38,501 --> 01:57:42,010
positive energy and wishes we can and I
really hope you get that transplant and

2775
01:57:42,011 --> 01:57:44,680
everything works out well and we'll have
you and afterwards we'll talk about it,

2776
01:57:44,681 --> 01:57:45,270
man.
All right.

2777
01:57:45,270 --> 01:57:47,440
But actually do ct Fletcher,
Ladies and gentlemen.
