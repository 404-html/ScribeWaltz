1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:08,370
Yee ha,
ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,660
he fucking Ha.
That's what I have to say to everyone in

3
00:00:12,661 --> 00:00:14,670
America,
but dude,

4
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,140
when you get to call yourself a name

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,500
like action,
like how dare you.

6
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,230
First of all,
how dare you be so bold that that's your

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,070
name.
Action.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:25,150
That's my name,
man.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:28,570
That's who I am.
Who I was born.

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,040
How did you get this name?
Man?

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,460
Listen,
I'm just known to be doing things.

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,520
I'm just known for things.
It's just too cool,

13
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,940
too cool for a white person.
You know,

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,543
dude,
I've been watching your stuff on vice 

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,510
and uh,
first of all,

16
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:47,344
what a great idea.
What a great idea to come up with that 

17
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:50,710
Hashtag.
Fuck,

18
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:52,090
that's delicious.
Thank you man.

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,040
Because your,
your instagram picture is.

20
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,950
It is a one big fuck.
That's delicious.

21
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,110
Instagram page rather.
It's awesome.

22
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,410
You wouldn't expect it from a,
from a rapper slash food traveling human

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,970
being such as myself.
I would expect exactly that.

24
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,973
Yeah,
yeah,

25
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,850
that's exactly what I expect from you.
All right.

26
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,450
Yeah.

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:15,090
Good.
I think I've got you figured out.

28
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,330
They put the thumb on me already.
It's a good thing though.

29
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,270
I'm a fan.
I like what should do in the well,

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,010
do you think that people try to define 
you?

31
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:24,844
Is that what it is?
It's like people look at you and they 

32
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:29,260
try to dismiss you or what is it?
I don't think they tried to dismiss me,

33
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:32,660
but I feel that people try to define you
of course put you in a box for us,

34
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,820
but I'm not the one that's ever to be 
put in a box.

35
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,673
You just,
there hasn't been any person like me 

36
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,920
ever and they probably,
you know,

37
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:42,700
there will be someone like me coming 
along but are use the white Kanye.

38
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,313
Definitely.
I'm the,

39
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,710
I'm the,
I'm the slightly 10 Audi.

40
00:01:49,711 --> 00:01:52,750
I know slanty Aka Action Bronson.
So you're,

41
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,584
you're traveling around.
How many of these restaurants are you 

42
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:55,780
visiting?

43
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,400
How many of these shows you doing for 
advice?

44
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,733
Uh,
we already did eight episodes of the 

45
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,260
first season.
We got picked up for a second.

46
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:04,360
We're going to be doing 12 episodes for 
the second.

47
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,450
Shit.
I'm trying to sign a longterm deal.

48
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,990
Seven years.
One hundred $38 million around there.

49
00:02:10,991 --> 00:02:14,260
A couple of incentives.
Well it's a great idea man,

50
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,163
and in the future as things like what 
you're kidding on vice.com or these 

51
00:02:19,601 --> 00:02:23,320
youtube pages that people just can,
you can do your own show like that.

52
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,580
Yep.
And it can,

53
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,280
it can get gigantic.
Like again,

54
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,243
it can get almost bigger than I could 
ever get on tv because you can download 

55
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:30,904
it and watch it anytime you want.
Well that's the issue I'm having right 

56
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:33,574
now because we've become such a global 
show that we're now on vices television 

57
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,230
network that is about to start on March 
third,

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:46,260
I mean on February 29th called Viceland 
and I have some,

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,233
some quarrels about it to say the truth 
because it's only going to be in North 

60
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,183
America and I mean people are going to 
get what they want so obviously they're 

61
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:57,520
going to download a touring or whatever 
they're going to do,

62
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,810
but it's necessary for it to be on 
Youtube as stressed.

63
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,600
I would.
Every video that I ever do it is totally

64
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,230
necessary to be on youtube because 
everyone needs access to it.

65
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,660
You could be right here.
You want to show me something.

66
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:11,930
Boom.
Type of writing,

67
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,670
you could show it to me.
We don't have to go to the TV,

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,980
see what time it comes on.
You know?

69
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:17,823
I know they have on demand,
but still it's the fucking process 

70
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,573
easier.
Yeah,

71
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,500
it's.
It's so universal.

72
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,210
It's where everyone goes.
Yeah.

73
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,120
It's like you wake up in the morning and
you go to youtube for some shit.

74
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:30,250
You listen to some music,
you put a mix on the.

75
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,903
You Watch some highlights for some shit.
Why you have it in your tv now you know 

76
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,850
if you have apple tv,
it's just,

77
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,820
it's so easy to use.
It's pretty much making TV obsolete.

78
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Well between that and Netflix and Hulu 
and all these different online providers

79
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,230
where you could access.

80
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,063
It's super easy now on your television 
and especially if you have one of those 

81
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:54,454
apple tvs,
so easy to get and this is just what's 

82
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,370
going to be like a decade from now,
man.

83
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,204
I mean you're got to be able to talk to 
your TV and say action Bronson and 

84
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,030
they'll just pull up room.
What would you like to know?

85
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,610
You know,
I would like to listen to his best shit.

86
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,060
That's right.
It'll his best shit.

87
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,830
Yeah,
I mean it's going to be,

88
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,640
it's going to be able to,
uh,

89
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,830
easily decipher what you're saying 
because right now they're pretty fucking

90
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,664
good if you like,
fucked with Siri at all and ask Siri 

91
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:24,364
questions.
Yup.

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,300
They,
I mean it's,

93
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,163
it gets pretty next level.
This guy right here is like the tech 

94
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:32,620
guy,
so I leave it to him and it's like 7,000

95
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:36,310
apps and this shit and that is fucking 
games all day long.

96
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,340
Do you have a flip phone?
I did.

97
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,310
Did you really?
Not.

98
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,143
My first phone was the STARTAC Motorola 
Startac my friend Ari Shaffir went back 

99
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,180
to the flip phone.
Yeah.

100
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,170
Yup.
He's like,

101
00:04:47,171 --> 00:04:49,420
fuck all you people.
You're losing your mind.

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,290
He's like,
know what?

103
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,760
He's right.
He is right.

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,340
He's right because I'm a fucking slave.
There's no doubt about that.

105
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,960
I go on,
I'm on twitter,

106
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,700
know when I wake up I just put it on to 
see what the hell's going on.

107
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:02,080
And it's upsetting.
Everybody's a slave to that thing.

108
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,530
That thing's monstrous but awesome.
Right.

109
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:10,590
It's incredible the amount of data that 
you can just get on anything instantly.

110
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,980
Tell me about kettlebells.
Tell me about airplane.

111
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,823
Who invented the first drone?
Just boom and he just started going 

112
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:24,310
through all this Chinese guy probably.
We were talking about this yesterday,

113
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,144
how like a youtube video now recommends 
and starts playing the next youtube 

114
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,320
video.

115
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,560
Like you just sit there.
It's sorta like Netflix does with like a

116
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:33,394
series.
He'll just start playing the next one's 

117
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,584
like sit down bench.
Where are you going to wait until he 

118
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,753
trapped you playing automatically like 
playing for you and Youtube does that 

119
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:43,870
all the time.
Now things related,

120
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,140
things that are slightly related you 
would discuss.

121
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:52,200
I mean just from me to make music using 
youtube has become a pleasure.

122
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,263
You know,
it's like a new age of digging in the 

123
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:00,260
crates.
You'd have to search pages for rare shit

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,510
and see,
make sure no one,

125
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,170
no one else has used it and it's like a 
never ending a catalog of musical talent

126
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:14,050
from all over the globe.
Now from blue,

127
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,380
from the early opera singers shift from.
You can listen to anything from any.

128
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,070
They have,
um,

129
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:23,300
from the early 19 hundreds of the first 
recording somehow.

130
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,750
That's insane.
Know.

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,353
Yeah.
It's insane to think that they figured 

132
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:29,564
out how to put sound on a black plastic 
disk that made it so awesome and they 

133
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,360
figured out how to do that when we were 
apes,

134
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,741
you know,
I mean,

135
00:06:39,741 --> 00:06:43,660
people were like in comparison to today,
like the amount of technology they had.

136
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:47,030
Then it was like the early 18 hundreds 
of figured out how to do that.

137
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:47,530
Right.
Like what,

138
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:48,363
what year was it?
They invented the phonograph record 

139
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:50,744
player.
Remember they used to have that big 

140
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:53,840
hoop,
you the hook,

141
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,793
the big,
like a tube and you have to look into 

142
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,893
fucking churned it and he would sit on 
it and the sound would come off the 

143
00:06:59,211 --> 00:07:00,044
record through that.

144
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,480
The thing before that,
I was looking up right now in 18,

145
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,314
77,
edison had this thing that the recorded 

146
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,960
on tin foil shape.
It looks slow.

147
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:09,893
So when eight cylinders,
it was a video from like tech tv where 

148
00:07:13,981 --> 00:07:17,790
some guy drops one and it's like an old 
viral video from the early wow.

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,920
Jesus Christ.
He dropped it.

150
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:21,220
And broke it.
Oh No,

151
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,540
fuck head.
It's unbelievable.

152
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,810
Coronet Solo.

153
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,990
Well,
if that was done today,

154
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,210
I'd want my fucking money back.
I'd be like,

155
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,083
you shitty audio engineer you foot.
What did you keep your phone in your 

156
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:47,440
pocket from there,
but listening to that.

157
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:49,300
It sounds good when you consider the 
time.

158
00:07:49,301 --> 00:07:52,050
It sounds amazing.
So what was the first phonograph?

159
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,893
What year was that invented?
Why don't feel like it was the 18 

160
00:07:55,511 --> 00:07:57,250
hundreds?
Am I wrong?

161
00:07:57,251 --> 00:07:58,084
Or is it like way earlier than that?
I think it was at the end of the 18 

162
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,180
hundreds.
The end of it,

163
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,920
they used to use look so wild with that 
big tube thing that came out of it,

164
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,073
but they haven't really figured out how 
to make it sound better than the record 

165
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:14,140
does know what has the difference 
because some people say it's bullshit.

166
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:14,974
Some people say it's just fetishism and 
some people who are real audio file 

167
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,800
type,
they,

168
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:24,070
they're all kind of agreed as like a 
different kind of sound.

169
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:28,330
Well it's what everyone explains to me.
And now I understand there's a warmth.

170
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,560
Yeah.
There's a warmth to it every,

171
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:31,394
you know,
it's easier on the ear then say the 

172
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,730
electronic music in the digital should 
have today,

173
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,983
so a little bit more harsh.
The oldest stuff was toned better and I 

174
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:43,090
don't know,
it was just the plastic.

175
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,930
The vinyl does something something to 
it.

176
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,870
The page like audio freaks all seemed to
agree on that,

177
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:50,704
right?
For sure.

178
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,693
But there's something about tape 
recording directly to two inch tape 

179
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,513
using this thing,
this big machine nowadays we just go 

180
00:08:59,611 --> 00:09:02,130
right into the computer through 
whatever.

181
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:06,510
I don't know what the fuck,
like m box or so what?

182
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:07,950
What Jamie,
you're.

183
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,813
You're one of the people that doesn't 
think it makes that much of a 

184
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:10,800
difference.

185
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,560
Right now it's just up to what?
At this point it's what you're hearing.

186
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:14,394
So like people today are trained to hear
things off of [inaudible] funds and 

187
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,670
itunes where it lists like mp3s,
that compression.

188
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:23,700
We're used to hearing it.
So being told that something else sounds

189
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:24,534
better.
It's like you're trying to tell them 

190
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:28,170
they don't lean on the compression.

191
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,223
Oh,
compression makes everything sound 

192
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,463
smooth.
And is it possible that it's a more 

193
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:35,410
familiar sound?
Is that why?

194
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,251
SORTA.
Yeah.

195
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:39,160
Like they're even mixing things now.
You'll see it's mastered for itunes.

196
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,860
It's mastered to be heard through those 
little two ear buds,

197
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:44,260
not through a giant's sound system at 
home.

198
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,140
Have giant speakers with subwoofers.
Absolutely correct.

199
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:50,290
Interesting.
Interesting personal.

200
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,143
No,
no one ever drives down the street 

201
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:53,431
anymore.
Blessed.

202
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:57,880
And the music fuck happened to that.
You know,

203
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,353
used to go when you got the car,
he used to have to go and buy the 

204
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,390
humongous speakers to put it in the 
bitch.

205
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,420
I think people start going deaf,
whatever,

206
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,693
whatever.
If you're driving around with earplugs 

207
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:13,410
on and you're blasting music,
it's kind of a Douche move,

208
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,060
right?
If it's so bad,

209
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,100
it hurts your ears.
You have to put ear plugs in his.

210
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:20,550
This guy in my neighborhood that just 
drives around every Sunday in a piece of

211
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:21,384
Shit Cadillac with a bow in the front,
playing all types of Frankie Valli at 

212
00:10:25,231 --> 00:10:26,064
the loudest,
the loudest volume that could possibly 

213
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:29,700
be and just singing along.
It's.

214
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:33,780
It's incredible.
It's just ritual every Sunday you really

215
00:10:33,781 --> 00:10:34,614
are right.
Because it used to be like every 

216
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,350
stoplight you would hear.

217
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,960
Yup,
Yup.

218
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,873
You'd feel like you're your car vibrate.
Those people that go crazy with the sub 

219
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:48,810
woofers to the point where you feel it 
in the air around you.

220
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,510
Fucking mirrors are rattling.
I love it.

221
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:52,820
Do you love it?
Naw,

222
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:57,690
I don't stare at it.
Have you ever been in a vehicle with the

223
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,130
ship?
Turns up all the way.

224
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
If you sit in the back seat with a 
Subwoofer is.

225
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,760
It feels like it's coming through your 
chest.

226
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:08,010
Like get your fucking heart is about to 
explode.

227
00:11:08,011 --> 00:11:08,844
What that base.
Especially if you play like dipset of 

228
00:11:11,341 --> 00:11:15,060
something like some sort of a,
some sort of Edm.

229
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:15,871
We,
you know,

230
00:11:15,871 --> 00:11:20,040
like some crazy house music.
You literally go into a trance.

231
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:23,010
Well you know what else went out dudes 
with the crazy,

232
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,670
the crazy wagon rims,
those wagon wheel rims.

233
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,360
Everybody was like,
how many potholes we're going to hit?

234
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,970
Add another rooms.
You can't have a 28 inch rim.

235
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,470
Is this,
these ridiculous ribs and tires are like

236
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:41,250
a piece of bubble gum.
The run flats,

237
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,410
thin nose.
I can't do it.

238
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,300
Man.
I got some Schmidt's on my car.

239
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,760
What's the Schmidt?
There's some German rooms that you could

240
00:11:47,761 --> 00:11:51,240
fucking tank would roll over them shits 
and there'll be all right.

241
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,740
You can literally drive the car without

242
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:56,140
rubber wheels on it.
Just on the rims.

243
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,123
What?
Yeah.

244
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,340
What kind of real wheels in these day 
was Schmidt's?

245
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:03,300
You could look him up as this Schmidt.
Um,

246
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,600
that's crazy.
Yeah.

247
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:09,610
Some drive them on the road over there 
on the left up.

248
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:10,563
Yep.
Those,

249
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:16,240
that's what kind of car do you have?
A BMW wagon five series 95.

250
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,320
That's a nice.
Those,

251
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,861
those,
uh,

252
00:12:21,861 --> 00:12:24,350
those years of like the nicest years.
Yeah,

253
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:27,380
for sure.
BMW five series.

254
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,690
It doesn't.
Tony have one of those.

255
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,470
Hinchcliffe has one of those.
They say that like,

256
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:37,250
um,
like they'll five series bmw from like,

257
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:40,340
um,
there's like two errors.

258
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,323
Like there's the one they have now,
the one they had before and then they 

259
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:45,260
want to have before that.
And that's where you're at.

260
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,950
Yeah.
I'm in the 95.

261
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:49,550
One is the,
is the one right before they changed the

262
00:12:49,551 --> 00:12:50,390
body.
Yeah.

263
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:52,600
Those are like classic cars.
Mammon.

264
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:53,823
There's.
Tony has a five series from there and I 

265
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:58,100
have another friend who was a three 
series from there.

266
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,440
Like those cars were something special.
Man.

267
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,660
They just figured out a way to make 
them.

268
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,370
They handle so good.
They break so good.

269
00:13:05,371 --> 00:13:07,910
That is the right amount of weight.
They're not too heavy.

270
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:08,783
Exactly.
You get like a good movement with them 

271
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:12,080
and that metal site.
Yeah.

272
00:13:12,081 --> 00:13:13,610
Look at that thing.
That fucking metal.

273
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,940
Exactly.
That's the [inaudible] from that era and

274
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,690
that car was a piece of genius.
That's the beauty of it too.

275
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,713
There's a fucking crazy video that 
someone put out that I could barely 

276
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:24,164
watch.
Man.

277
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,650
It's some asshole in some other country.
I don't know what countries in,

278
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,753
but he's in an m five,
one of those that series and he's 

279
00:13:31,221 --> 00:13:34,880
driving to traffic like a fucking 
maniac.

280
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,290
Like you watch it.
You just go.

281
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,310
Cheeses.
Yeah.

282
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,430
Holding onto the chair when he burns it 
into the oncoming lane.

283
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:41,264
Cuts in front of people.
I mean he is doing some fucking crazy 

284
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:47,270
shit really fast,
but driving like a wizard,

285
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,300
like going around corners sideways.
He must be a race car driver.

286
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,430
There's no way he's not a race car 
driver because,

287
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,600
oh,
this is it.

288
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,800
Jesus Christ.
Jamie,

289
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,460
how dare you this,
this motherfucker is nuts.

290
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:00,890
Look at this and watch this.
Look at this.

291
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,930
Oh Shit.
He's just drifting.

292
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,240
Yeah,
he's drifting.

293
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,310
Oh,
that's a beauty too.

294
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:07,460
Going around people and I mean,
look,

295
00:14:07,461 --> 00:14:09,830
I always driving.
Where's this fucking guy?

296
00:14:09,831 --> 00:14:12,890
Speeding while people are walking across
the road and he doesn't give a fuck,

297
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,920
this oncoming doesn't give a fuck.
This guy is fucking crazy shit.

298
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,750
Just killing it.
Look at this.

299
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,210
Where's this?
Austria.

300
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,253
I don't know where it is.
It's something they have those crazy 

301
00:14:25,491 --> 00:14:26,324
long European license plates stuff,
but look at them like this motherfucker 

302
00:14:28,641 --> 00:14:30,100
drives.
Oh,

303
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,660
what is this?
Jamie's for people.

304
00:14:32,661 --> 00:14:37,661
If they want to watch it.
The BMW m five need to need for Dr. Com.

305
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,040
Last illegal street racing and drift 
driver.

306
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,060
Georgie [inaudible].

307
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,470
He just died.
Look at this.

308
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,371
Did he?
Yeah,

309
00:14:49,371 --> 00:14:50,204
he just died.
I think he just did some shit in the 

310
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:53,300
whip.
He died in this car actually.

311
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,770
Come on,
check it out.

312
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,000
Oh my goodness.
All right.

313
00:14:56,001 --> 00:15:00,120
P,
Georgie or Giorgio Tevye.

314
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:02,310
Z.
Z.

315
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:05,870
Yeah.
Georgia z think he's dead.

316
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,250
He died in the Burgundy.
Bema riced.

317
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:16,710
He died in the infamous BMW street.
Drifter dies in crash.

318
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,250
Hot outside of Barclay.
Oh No.

319
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,790
Holy Shit.
He was 26 years old.

320
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,550
Yep.
What are not man?

321
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,560
He was leaving a restaurant in Georgia 
with a sober driver at the wheel.

322
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:35,561
The MTI skidded at what appears to be a 
high speed into a tree on the right hand

323
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:41,060
side of the car tabs.
Xie Xie died.

324
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,070
He wasn't.
The driver wasn't driving traffic shit.

325
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,473
That is ironic tale.
It's not like Atlanta last Morrissette 

326
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,290
Ironic,
ironic.

327
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,050
Not Ironic,
but it's a,

328
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,390
it's kind of fucked.
So you know,

329
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,503
like Kennison was killed by a drunk 
driver and Kennison used to have those 

330
00:16:03,441 --> 00:16:05,000
bits about drinking and driving.

331
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,480
We're gonna do it.
We're going to drag.

332
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,330
We're going to drive.
We're going to pull it off.

333
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,550
We do it every fucking night.

334
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,720
The crowd would go crazy and people get 
so mad.

335
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:16,554
They were like,
this guy is encouraging drunk driving 

336
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,740
like what the fuck?
And then boom,

337
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,110
he gets killed by a drunk driver.
I like fucking comma.

338
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,340
Yeah.
I don't know if Karma is real,

339
00:16:26,341 --> 00:16:28,620
but God damn is a lot of evidence out 
there,

340
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:29,640
you know,
was just to say,

341
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,950
you know,
one of those things saying,

342
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:34,123
I swear to God a real,
but it's one of those things like an 

343
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:41,460
American slang word Karma is a 
motherfucker though.

344
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,600
It is and that,
that,

345
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,380
that statement.
Karma is a motherfucker.

346
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:48,060
It's like one of the best statements as 
far as like,

347
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:49,750
when shit goes down like that,
you're like,

348
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,550
oh man,
you know,

349
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,200
nobody wishes that on somebody.
Especially if you're a driver and you're

350
00:16:58,201 --> 00:16:59,560
like me.
And He's probably like,

351
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:01,200
pitch.
This would've never happened if I was at

352
00:17:01,201 --> 00:17:01,740
the wheel.

353
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,040
Never fucking Georgie the way that kind 
of drives.

354
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,170
That was insane.
I mean,

355
00:17:07,171 --> 00:17:08,004
it's horrific to watch.
Definitely shouldn't be allowed to do 

356
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:11,964
it.
What about the videos of the fucking 

357
00:17:14,821 --> 00:17:18,090
Russian dudes climbing the buildings?
I was just going to say something,

358
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,530
some new dude.
I put one up on my instagram page.

359
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:25,650
I put like two of them in a row.
They were fucking freaking me out.

360
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,030
And this dude,
uh,

361
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,310
contacted me through twitter and said 
Hi.

362
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,833
His,
uh,

363
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
his,
his stunts are,

364
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:35,970
he's insane and he's got youtube videos.
These things to you just,

365
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,173
they're insane.
He's on like the Eiffel Tower or some 

366
00:17:38,761 --> 00:17:39,594
shit.
Right?

367
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,040
I saw that one.
Is that,

368
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:41,874
what is the,
is that in Paris that he's on that top 

369
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:46,170
of that tower?
He's fucking palm sweat.

370
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,830
Mixed.
Like what the fuck to the mix.

371
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,840
Every fucking cell on your body just 
starts vibrating really savvy.

372
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,453
I don't get that man.
If I was in that shape and I probably 

373
00:18:02,671 --> 00:18:04,380
would try to.
What'd you really?

374
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,240
Yeah,
but they're in crazy shape.

375
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,470
You see them doing.
Look at this.

376
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,800
Look at this.
Oh my God.

377
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,170
Oh my God.
Oh,

378
00:18:13,171 --> 00:18:14,370
this is in New York,
I guess.

379
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,700
Is this New York,
Dubai?

380
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,660
Others like,
oh my God.

381
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:18,494
Look at the age.

382
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,720
This is not good.
James Kingston's,

383
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:27,390
isn't he?
He's crazy Mexican dude.

384
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,530
Oh my God.
You know what?

385
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,373
A guy like this,
I would just like to hit for him to 

386
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,720
retire right now.
Look,

387
00:18:33,721 --> 00:18:34,950
you did it.
Congratulations.

388
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,740
Let's not keep doing this.
This is not.

389
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,940
Keep doing this.
Look their fuck.

390
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:41,280
Oh my God.
Look at this.

391
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,370
Oh my God,
he's doing chin ups on this thing.

392
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,670
Oh,
please stop.

393
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,420
I can't do this.
Oh,

394
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,110
fucking Christ.
Oh my God.

395
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:55,960
Dude.
Dude.

396
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,590
Dude.
Dude.

397
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,410
Dude.
Dude.

398
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,550
Dude.
Dude.

399
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:03,480
Too.
For people who are in his name,

400
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,020
James Kingston on Instagram,
that's his page and I don't feel so good

401
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,370
that way.
He was holding on.

402
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,130
The blood was thick ass.
Boy.

403
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,173
He's got with one arm and he's hanging 
with one arm and he's like a mile in 

404
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:22,320
this guy.
Dude,

405
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,273
stop it.
Jamie's.

406
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,110
I can't do it.
Stop.

407
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,343
Cut it off.

408
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,690
Fuck man.

409
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,080
Oh my God.
What?

410
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,100
Flint.
My God.

411
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:38,890
He just jumped from one building to 
another.

412
00:19:38,891 --> 00:19:41,380
Look at this.
Not even a running start.

413
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,950
This is insane.
That is insane.

414
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,820
How does he do that?
Like I would splatter.

415
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,250
I would never make it that far.
How's he making it that far?

416
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,333
He has some good thrust.
The momentum than the thrust and that 

417
00:19:58,921 --> 00:20:01,200
seems like an insane amount of distance 
to travel,

418
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:05,060
doesn't it?
How the fuck does he judge that?

419
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:09,340
How does he jump and land like that?
You got a crazy one.

420
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,680
Look at Jamie's face.
Look at this.

421
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,170
Look at this.
Oh,

422
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:19,171
there's no way.
He just jumps across a building.

423
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,240
How is that possible,
man?

424
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,350
How is that possible?
And this is one of his favorite jumps in

425
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:35,351
the city apparently.
Come on son.

426
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:40,800
And you know like this doesn't make any.
Doesn't make any sense.

427
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,510
At the end of the day,
man.

428
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,610
How is that possible?
If I could,

429
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,980
I would.
When skateboarding,

430
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:51,010
like once Tony Hawk does the 900,
once you see it done,

431
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,190
everyone else can just start doing it.
But I just looked.

432
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,540
I'm shocked by the distance he's 
covering I guess.

433
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,270
I guess what's going on?
It's like

434
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,400
the distance of one building.
It's,

435
00:21:02,401 --> 00:21:03,840
it's,
it's far away,

436
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:04,674
but it's also higher.
So in his leap if he get a good 

437
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,680
spraying,
his arc will carry him over,

438
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:14,850
but he's got a judge that perfectly like
you have to you.

439
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,960
There's no room for error whatsoever.
This is what it looks like sideways.

440
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,210
Oh Shit.
To look out far.

441
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:22,050
He's jumping,
man.

442
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,913
That's insane.
That's an insane amount of space he's 

443
00:21:25,411 --> 00:21:27,510
covering.
When it lands on that edge,

444
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,080
like that kid,
he must be like.

445
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:33,030
I mean,
I don't know how much you ways,

446
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,073
but he must be insanely strong for his 
weight and he can just throw his body 

447
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:38,664
through the air like that.
He must have just ridiculous explosion 

448
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,890
out of his legs.
Land so lightly.

449
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,133
That's freakish shit.
I guess it's those things like if you 

450
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:54,060
just concentrate on only doing that,
you can do it in a way that doesn't make

451
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:57,730
sense to someone like you or me or.
No,

452
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,920
I can't even ice skate.
Skate at all.

453
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,080
Well fuck.
I'm.

454
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,490
I cannot escape incredibly man.
I'm fucking again.

455
00:22:10,491 --> 00:22:12,450
Ice 80 five.
Yeah.

456
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:13,790
Good day.
First of all,

457
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:14,624
I can't find it.
Shoot when I don't have my own ice 

458
00:22:16,341 --> 00:22:17,174
skates so I have to rent.
Ice Skates is for the same reason why I 

459
00:22:19,461 --> 00:22:20,210
couldn't answer.
No.

460
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,940
For years I can rent.
Those are fucking shitty.

461
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,430
Well it's not even just that my feet are
too wide,

462
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:27,620
so if I had a regular size 11,
my feet,

463
00:22:27,621 --> 00:22:28,454
I have someone in my background fucked a
monkey when it was fucking big foot one 

464
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,453
time ago.
Like when you shouldn't be able to fuck 

465
00:22:36,111 --> 00:22:36,944
monkeys anymore.
Someone just went back in for one more 

466
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:41,210
shot,
fucked them monkey guaranteed.

467
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:46,270
It was like the last,
like last call evolution last car in one

468
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:49,700
of my ancestors just snuck back in and 
cut one more nut off.

469
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,030
Um,
but my feet are just too wide,

470
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,953
so I get in those things.
I'm just in agony and I just never 

471
00:22:55,851 --> 00:22:56,684
learned how.
And I'm not gonna I'm not interesting 

472
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:00,200
enough for me to go out and buy ice 
skates,

473
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,060
you know?
It felt like this is it.

474
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,923
It's just something I have to conquer.
Then I would have to learn how to ice 

475
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:08,000
skate.
It was much more exciting as a youth.

476
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,250
Yeah.
Fucking roller.

477
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:11,383
Not Roller blading.
Fucking ice skating to green day shit 

478
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:15,950
like that.
You know what I mean?

479
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:20,100
That's right.
They play loud music and you spin around

480
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,140
the ice.
Yeah.

481
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:26,270
See,
I guess hockey would be the reason to do

482
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:27,104
it.
Like if you wanted to learn how to play 

483
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:28,574
hockey,
you say you pretend you're doing hockey 

484
00:23:30,261 --> 00:23:31,094
moves and like you're on the ice.
Snowing when you stop and you throw the 

485
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:38,900
snow of people,
you know that that's a cool move.

486
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:39,651
Yeah,
exactly.

487
00:23:39,651 --> 00:23:40,484
So you were the hockey skates.
You definitely don't where the figure 

488
00:23:42,981 --> 00:23:45,680
skating ones.
No chance.

489
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,340
No,
you don't.

490
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,510
What's the difference?
Well,

491
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,650
they had the spikes in the front so you 
could do the triple toe Lutz.

492
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,023
You know anybody what?
You don't want anybody seeing your 

493
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,180
spikes.
You're gonna.

494
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,073
When you go straight you have to lift a 
little bit and you're going to fall on 

495
00:23:59,661 --> 00:24:02,270
your face.
The hockey is a little curvature,

496
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,630
like a running shoe.
It just allows you to maneuver,

497
00:24:05,631 --> 00:24:09,230
to dice so it allows you to maneuver 
better,

498
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,360
but it doesn't allow you to do tricks.
Can't do.

499
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,370
You can't do a stop and then tripled 
toilets or like Scott Hamilton flip.

500
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,360
So were they doing flips and when they 
do those spins on the ice?

501
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:22,130
They doing them with like special 
skates?

502
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:24,620
Is that what the deal is?
Show a Brian Boitano.

503
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:32,130
Remember South Park by Brian Boitano do 
love it.

504
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,040
That was one of the first episodes,
right?

505
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:36,590
Was it?
The first one was funny,

506
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:40,400
man,
that was going around as a vhs tape back

507
00:24:40,401 --> 00:24:41,234
in the day.
That was one of those things where a 

508
00:24:42,951 --> 00:24:45,260
buddy of mine said,
you have to see this.

509
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:48,380
Check this out.
These guys made this video.

510
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,810
It was Jesus and Brian Boitano,
right?

511
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,300
[inaudible].
Who else was in it?

512
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,240
Santa Santa.
That's right.

513
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,390
Whatever it was.
It was fucking hilarious.

514
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:04,391
And it was way before its time.
You know what?

515
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,070
What was the year?
The first south park tape was made.

516
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,310
When you find out how long those guys 
have been around.

517
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,340
Nineteen 92.
Jesus Christ,

518
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,463
dude,
they've been killing it since 

519
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,700
[inaudible] 92 92 South Park came out in
[inaudible] 92.

520
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,300
That the spirit of Christmas.
Oh,

521
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,620
that was the 97.
Okay.

522
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:26,180
Yeah,
that much later.

523
00:25:26,181 --> 00:25:27,860
Really?
God,

524
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:28,700
it was so funny.

525
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,880
I must've got it after if they did it in
[inaudible] 92.

526
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:34,520
I didn't move here until [inaudible] 94.
And I know that I got it.

527
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,623
Um,
when I was living in Encino because I 

528
00:25:36,861 --> 00:25:38,810
remember popping.
And then when a friend came over,

529
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,860
it was amazing.
You had a ball.

530
00:25:42,861 --> 00:25:45,230
He hit a lend you the tape.
Somebody gave it to me.

531
00:25:45,231 --> 00:25:46,064
I don't remember how I got the tape,
but I remember somebody gave it to me 

532
00:25:47,811 --> 00:25:48,980
and said,
you gotta watch this.

533
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,203
And um,
then I remember popping into VCR for my 

534
00:25:52,971 --> 00:25:55,580
friend.
It was so ridiculous.

535
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,810
It was super funny.
It was really crude.

536
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,510
I almost wish he would go back to doing 
it this way,

537
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,853
you know,
because it was so obvious that it was 

538
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,740
just really shitty animation.
Like,

539
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:12,080
look at the mouth movements.
It's more,

540
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,540
it's still shitty,
but it's more sophisticated now.

541
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,340
Right.
We just did shitty.

542
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,290
Yeah.
And this is a,

543
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,350
I bet the amount of time it took to do 
this.

544
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,630
It's probably ridiculous though,
you know,

545
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:24,543
like the team America,
I think he said he would never do a one 

546
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:31,340
of those movies again because it was 
just way too time consuming.

547
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,920
I mean he was a pretty incredible 
fucking movie.

548
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,060
It's one of my favorites ever.
Yeah.

549
00:26:37,061 --> 00:26:37,894
That's one of my all time favorites.
We were talking about like movies that 

550
00:26:41,241 --> 00:26:43,800
are funnier than tropic thunder and 
it's,

551
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,663
it's

552
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,150
probably none are funnier.
Like in moments I,

553
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,800
it's as funny as a movie gets,
but there's other really funny movies to

554
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,870
teach.
That's the funniest of all time.

555
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,320
One of them.
It's one of the funniest.

556
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:03,660
It's stupid funny movie team America to 
Zulu lenders.

557
00:27:04,171 --> 00:27:05,610
Really funny.
Yeah.

558
00:27:05,611 --> 00:27:06,444
There's a lot of.
There's a lot of fucking Talladega 

559
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,320
nights and now I lost all credibility 
right there.

560
00:27:10,321 --> 00:27:12,700
Jamie,
when I first saw the fucking board,

561
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:14,790
pretty much shit my pants.
Yeah,

562
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
Porat.
Even Bruno.

563
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,900
I didn't see Bruno.
I still haven't seen it.

564
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,740
My Albanian father.
Fuck it out.

565
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,574
Beatty and father.
Immigrant hardhead only knows one way a 

566
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:33,540
neanderthal thinks that's one of the 
funniest movies ever.

567
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,490
You know what I mean?
It's just weird.

568
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:38,430
It's a crossover hit.
You know what's a.

569
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,500
Oh,
like an underrated funny movie.

570
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,140
And Adam Sandler's don't mess with the 
Zohan.

571
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,500
Oh yeah.
That one's a good one too.

572
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,060
Rated funny movie man.
Like,

573
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,890
because a lot of people,
they put Adam Sandler movies into like a

574
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:51,330
category,
you know,

575
00:27:51,331 --> 00:27:52,164
sometimes you can get a little,
they can get a little dismissive of an 

576
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:57,000
Adam Sandler movie,
but that don't mess with the Zohan.

577
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,350
It's classic,
it was a good one.

578
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,250
Yeah.
So tell me how your show works,

579
00:28:02,251 --> 00:28:03,084
man.
Do you just decide where you want to go 

580
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,470
to somebody else's suggest where to go?
Well,

581
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,190
a lot of the times it's A.
I go on tour for my music and then while

582
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,380
we're there we ended up shooting the 
show.

583
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,900
If that's not the case,
I just tell them,

584
00:28:15,901 --> 00:28:18,960
listen,
I want to go to Sicily and then we're in

585
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,580
Sicily,
you know,

586
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,713
it's that simple and we just,
I bring my boys with me and we just go 

587
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,204
in,
they put the camera on and we just act 

588
00:28:28,981 --> 00:28:29,814
how we act.

589
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:32,220
Sub B us.
Wow.

590
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:35,280
Then you just get to pick where you're,
where you're eating and just.

591
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,330
Well yeah.
Were a chef at one point in time was.

592
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,120
That's how I really started.
I was uh,

593
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,660
my,
when I was like 18,

594
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,513
I went to culinary school and fucked off
after that for about a year and a half 

595
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:54,900
or two and had a child and went back 
into the kitchen and started working and

596
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,513
that was just said I thought I was just 
going to be a fucking short order cook 

597
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:02,580
or chef or whatever for the rest of my 
life out of nowhere.

598
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:06,090
I broke my leg,
just slipped on the floor,

599
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,373
broke my leg.
I was working a little bit with music 

600
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:10,434
before that,
but not in any capacity where I thought 

601
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:17,880
it would be where I am now and shit.
Here we are,

602
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,313
you know,
that took me out of the kitchen 

603
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:21,204
professionally,
put me in a recording studio all the 

604
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:24,264
time.

605
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,750
That's crazy.
Yeah,

606
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,080
fall changed your destiny and straight 
up,

607
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,320
broken my right leg,
my right ankle from a slip,

608
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,190
a very like I've snipped much worse,
much worse than myself.

609
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:41,160
And this one just got cracked,
cracked.

610
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,333
That's so interesting.
How something like that can happen or 

611
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
something that looks like a bad thing 
that happened to you.

612
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,080
Turned into like this amazing door that 
opened up.

613
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,013
Yup.
And then all of a sudden you could do 

614
00:29:52,361 --> 00:29:54,760
what you really want to do.
It's,

615
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,010
this is what I wanted to do my whole 
life.

616
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:57,880
Nothing,
you know,

617
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,080
just what I wanted to do.

618
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,293
So what is this?
We're watching Jamie Niamh jam or does 

619
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:06,131
that.
Oh yeah,

620
00:30:06,131 --> 00:30:08,290
this is a,
this is me in,

621
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,060
in Jamaica.
Oh Wow.

622
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,490
I went down here to do.
Would that go down here and do.

623
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,600
I went down here to do some sort of 
exhibition with Mario Vitale,

624
00:30:16,601 --> 00:30:20,020
but he was in no condition to do 
anything with me that day.

625
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:23,770
So I ended up just hanging out pretty 
much at the beach the whole time.

626
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,653
Oh,
so you were supposed to hang out with 

627
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,370
Mario and he got fucked up pretty much 
he,

628
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,403
I was hanging out with him,
but we were just sitting at the bar 

629
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,760
hanging.
He was,

630
00:30:33,761 --> 00:30:35,710
you know,
he was doing well.

631
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,370
He just didn't feel like doing anything.
He just wanted to hang out.

632
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,080
The weather was too good.
Oh,

633
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,690
I get it.
The weather was just too beautiful.

634
00:30:43,691 --> 00:30:45,940
So he just didn't want to participate in
a show,

635
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,160
but no,
not this one.

636
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,493
Just in the entire events of the thing.
I feel like we're dancing around the 

637
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,890
store.
He was pushed you on the bottom line.

638
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:03,900
I was fucking eight a macaroon,
like one of these edibles and I was just

639
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:08,150
demolished walking around.
Did Mario get demolished to now?

640
00:31:08,151 --> 00:31:10,050
Maryville doesn't get demolished.
Like he's just,

641
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,400
he just drinks one that's too bad.
Yeah,

642
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,990
he's missing out.
He is.

643
00:31:13,991 --> 00:31:16,030
I think that he's had this year.
You think?

644
00:31:16,031 --> 00:31:17,320
So how would the same?
He's done.

645
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,453
Um,
I would say I got to get back to the 

646
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,510
fucking kitchen,
got to cook the shit out.

647
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,353
Some food I can't have,
I don't have time for these deep soul 

648
00:31:24,521 --> 00:31:25,930
searching.
We trips now.

649
00:31:25,931 --> 00:31:27,180
He's just hanging out,
man.

650
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,920
He's just living his life.
He's like a fucking superstar.

651
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,160
He's a rockstar.
That guy to world.

652
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:35,230
The world of chefs is a very different 
world.

653
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,640
And when I was younger I didn't really 
appreciate it like as an art form.

654
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:43,390
I think I just thought it was almost 
more like a,

655
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,440
you know,
just a cool thing that someone knows how

656
00:31:47,441 --> 00:31:49,390
to make really good food because you can
go to that restaurant,

657
00:31:49,391 --> 00:31:53,470
you can get it there and didn't think of
like who is the creator of that food and

658
00:31:53,471 --> 00:31:55,330
what is that?
Is that an art form?

659
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,550
You know,
because I think it definitely is.

660
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:02,950
And guys like you and like you look like
a chef,

661
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,270
which is like you're all tattooed up 
like you a lot of chefs and chef.

662
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:07,801
Yeah,
yeah,

663
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:08,960
yeah.
That's the date.

664
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,480
Like they can be artists.
Yeah,

665
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:13,460
for sure.
Well that's today chefs chefs are,

666
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,530
you know,
young,

667
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:17,360
crazy,
tattooed motherfuckers.

668
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,830
You can't really cool who's the chef,
you know,

669
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:21,723
but a classic chef is usually the French
guy with a handkerchief around his neck 

670
00:32:25,601 --> 00:32:26,434
and a big hat.

671
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,770
It's not like that anymore.
The chefs are now rockstars.

672
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,233
Well,
they definitely have become because I 

673
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:33,694
think a lot of it is because of 
Bourdain's show that definitely become 

674
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,740
more highlighted in that regard.
Like on his show,

675
00:32:38,741 --> 00:32:42,550
he's always like interviewing these 
weird funky people in Portland that are,

676
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:43,803
you know,
raising their own chickens and shit and 

677
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,360
you know,
farm to table type restaurants.

678
00:32:47,361 --> 00:32:48,194
He'll,
he'll hang out with a lot of like weird 

679
00:32:49,521 --> 00:32:52,910
experimental chef people and a lot of 
them look like you.

680
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:53,920
Yeah,
no that's,

681
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:56,780
that's a good thing.
He definitely opened a door for a lot of

682
00:32:56,781 --> 00:32:57,614
people,
but I feel like the celebrity chefs 

683
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,090
started with emeril Lagasse and people 
like that,

684
00:33:02,091 --> 00:33:03,890
like earlier with.
Excuse me.

685
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:06,170
What about Julia Child?
Exactly.

686
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,033
There you.
Oh,

687
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,080
excuse me.
Excuse me.

688
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:12,120
You can't go Mro.
You can't say it started with Emeril,

689
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,983
but I'm like in this era,
you know where it really fucking took 

690
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:15,500
off.

691
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:20,270
Julia child was really the only one and 
that other Guy Graham Kerr or some shit,

692
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:21,104
whatever the fucking guys name was.
So was there like a calm before the 

693
00:33:23,271 --> 00:33:24,920
storm?
Before emeril arrived?

694
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,933
Man,
I don't know the child and there was 

695
00:33:26,811 --> 00:33:29,630
nothing in the world searching for a TV 
cook.

696
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,720
I was fucking driving around in fucking 
jettas and shit.

697
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,050
Smoking weed and Queens.
I had no idea watching.

698
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:39,884
Saved by the bell at 7:00 AM.
Emeril was supposed to be a super nice 

699
00:33:42,321 --> 00:33:46,460
guy that emeril lagasse every blow by 
all accounts,

700
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,990
like one of the nicest guys in the 
world.

701
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,630
Bam.
It says Bam all the time,

702
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,140
Pam.
He gets hyped by all accounts.

703
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:54,974
Like one of the nicest guys.
He just keeps scallions in his pocket 

704
00:33:57,591 --> 00:34:00,590
and every fucking time he says band.
Just throw scallions in your face.

705
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:02,323
Yeah.
It's also interesting in the world of 

706
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:04,874
food and likes and cooks and chefs that 
there's different schools of food and 

707
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:10,400
cooks and chefs.

708
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,383
There's like the really experimental 
artistic people make maybe even 

709
00:34:14,781 --> 00:34:15,614
alternative and their musical choices.
And then it was like Guy Fieri and he 

710
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,380
was like,
you know,

711
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:24,140
a big bolster.
Its American drives a yellow corvette.

712
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,850
It's got frosted tips.
It's like he's got his own.

713
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:33,880
He's a fucking classic character.
White snake version is a leopard.

714
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,020
Equally entertaining.
You know what I mean?

715
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,820
Like I'm a white snake fan,
you know?

716
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,290
I love him.
He's,

717
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,670
he's,
he's incredible.

718
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:42,043
It's funny how those guys like don't 
like each other and they board Dane and 

719
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,270
him go back and forth.
Has a beef.

720
00:34:47,271 --> 00:34:51,260
It's hilarious for Dane is fucking 
hilarious.

721
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,390
He's hilarious.
He's like a comic.

722
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,040
He's.
He's 100 percent.

723
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,760
Only works in New York kitchen his 
entire life.

724
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,280
He still.
He started Jujitsu at 58.

725
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,590
I know I see 57,
58.

726
00:35:03,591 --> 00:35:05,450
She's doing a good job.
He's rolling around over there.

727
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,040
He got a blue belt.
Really?

728
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,030
Yeah.
He got his blue belt.

729
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,360
That's a legit blue belt from Henzel 
gracie academy.

730
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,570
That is about as legitimate blue belt as
there is in the world.

731
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,210
You have to earn that.
You don't just get that.

732
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,880
He that guy.
That's very impressive.

733
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:20,773
That's very impressive to do that at his
age and apparently he's just doing it 

734
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,540
every day.
Man Becomes addictive,

735
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:26,961
right?
Yeah.

736
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:28,550
And I,
I looked at your instagram page.

737
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:29,510
You're,
you're working out.

738
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,560
You have someone trains sometimes.
Oh yeah.

739
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,463
You know,
like I,

740
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,980
I've been athletic my entire life.
I played football.

741
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,080
Fucking high school baseball.
Know as time goes on you get lazy.

742
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,183
You know.
When I was younger I was fucking 

743
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,950
juicing.
I was taking steroids and shit.

744
00:35:46,951 --> 00:35:49,860
I was fucking buff.
I'm serious.

745
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,053
I believe I was squatting like six.
I was fucking bench in my highest was 

746
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,460
100 pounds straight up.

747
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:59,340
No shoes on belt,
no wraps.

748
00:35:59,341 --> 00:36:02,820
Just in the bucket.
You don't want to wear shoes,

749
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,720
no shoes.
You know,

750
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:08,030
you gotta keep the flat flat shoe.
Six hundred pounds with no shoes.

751
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:09,390
That's crazy.
That's a lot of weight.

752
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,310
It was out.
It was like 22 years old,

753
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:13,650
23 years old,
but it was,

754
00:36:13,651 --> 00:36:14,484
it was probably because of the steroids 
will do in a show like this where you 

755
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:19,140
traveled around the world and you're 
eating all that food.

756
00:36:19,141 --> 00:36:23,630
I would imagine it would be so easy to 
just get lazy.

757
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:27,630
Just literally lost 50 pounds and I just
gained another 20.

758
00:36:27,631 --> 00:36:28,464
So,
um,

759
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,670
my whole life is fluctuation.
I just need to get to that point where I

760
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:33,504
need to get past that fluctuating point 
and just go down and start seeing all 

761
00:36:40,111 --> 00:36:42,170
these fucking abs that I have under 
there.

762
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:46,970
You know what I'm saying?
I have like 32 ab muscles that you know,

763
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,360
you could possibly see.

764
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,113
All it needs to be done is shredded.
Do you really want to lose that much 

765
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:54,384
weight?
Of course anybody that's overweight 

766
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,200
wants to have a fucking six pack before 
they die.

767
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,080
The fact,
is it a fact?

768
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,940
Yeah.
I have one vein.

769
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:06,550
I've,
you know,

770
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,500
you know when you gauge working gal you 
if you can see the vein or not.

771
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:13,170
Yes.
I have that good one vein over here.

772
00:37:13,171 --> 00:37:16,230
The squiggly upper shoulders.
Exactly.

773
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,180
The squiggly one.
Yeah,

774
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:19,840
that's a good one.
Like a.

775
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,890
What was the bodybuilder?
The fucking French guy forgot his name.

776
00:37:24,891 --> 00:37:28,560
The French guy told delay.
I don't know who that guy is.

777
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:32,940
That's secure reference.
Obscure stroke man.

778
00:37:32,941 --> 00:37:35,730
References on types of bodybuilding 
references.

779
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,440
Yeah,
that's a ridiculous one.

780
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,390
Look up.
Pulled the.

781
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,590
It tells me that he doesn't have that 
fucking.

782
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,863
He's famous for the squiggle.
So have you thought about like hiring a 

783
00:37:47,161 --> 00:37:47,994
nutritionist?

784
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,850
I know what to do.
You know what to do.

785
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,060
I don't know what to do.
It's just not easy doing it alone.

786
00:37:54,061 --> 00:37:55,440
I need someone to,
you know,

787
00:37:55,441 --> 00:37:57,060
literally.
No,

788
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:57,894
you can't do that.
You can't have that at one in the 

789
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:01,104
morning.
You can eat a fucking in and out right 

790
00:38:03,991 --> 00:38:05,640
now.
You can have fries right now,

791
00:38:05,641 --> 00:38:07,290
just do,
just stick to it.

792
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,630
It's hard to stick to it.
So is it um,

793
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:11,400
just a selfcontrol thing?
Yes,

794
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:15,840
but I have self control in spirits,
which is weird.

795
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:21,100
There is Paul delay.
Here is guys bodies sad.

796
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,410
It doesn't even look real.
Oh my God.

797
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,403
What's with the suspenders?
There's two pictures of the road with 

798
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:28,674
him wearing suspenders.
They always have suspect outfits on and 

799
00:38:30,631 --> 00:38:33,390
fucking body they help is wearing some 
wild.

800
00:38:33,391 --> 00:38:34,870
Like where did you get that?
Oh,

801
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,190
it genes with the best.

802
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,510
So that's definitely call Kanye dude his
wall.

803
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,450
He's so sweet.
That's ridiculous.

804
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,460
Yeah,
that guy's so big.

805
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,770
I used to look at magazines and want to 
be like that.

806
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,143
It's just crazy.
It's like Ronnie Coleman and fucking 

807
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:54,380
insane science project or really that's 
it.

808
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,353
That's a science project.
It's amazing how many of those science 

809
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:58,654
projects exist though.
I mean that's what all those magazines 

810
00:39:01,541 --> 00:39:04,150
are.
It's the weirdest conspiracy and it is a

811
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:04,984
conspiracy that all those,
like if you looking at those 

812
00:39:07,301 --> 00:39:10,900
bodybuilding magazines and shit that 
none of them like,

813
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,480
I don't know,
maybe they do now,

814
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:17,200
but back in the day none of them were 
talking about how they did steroids.

815
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,930
You're right there all dancing around 
it,

816
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,240
but they were also talking about like,
you know,

817
00:39:22,241 --> 00:39:23,074
I take creatine muscled Dick hard 
corporation and let's a team is 

818
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:29,374
guaranteed to pack on 30 pounds a mass 
and they were all like pretending that 

819
00:39:33,401 --> 00:39:37,030
they got all that muscle from some stuff
that,

820
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,650
you know,
it's like barely works.

821
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,330
Like creatine works a little bit,
but if you get to the Paul delay levels,

822
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:47,020
no way.
You can't look like that as like a human

823
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:48,280
being.
Can't look like that.

824
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:50,300
I don't think people understand that.
No,

825
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,363
and I don't think I understand why the 
fuck they used to not talk about it 

826
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:57,520
while I was just so taboo because it was
illegal.

827
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,640
It was legal and everyone knows what 
you're doing.

828
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:03,850
It's like more out in the open now with 
all the baseball shit and this.

829
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:06,010
Yeah.
I don't think that it's wrong.

830
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,030
Every baseball player he looks like now.
That's crazy.

831
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,350
Oh,
that looks like a meme that you know,

832
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:16,450
that looks like something on the Yo.
What the fuck?

833
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,200
That is insane.
What does it say above that,

834
00:40:20,201 --> 00:40:21,034
Jamie?
He already experienced some atrophy in 

835
00:40:24,041 --> 00:40:25,780
his arms and back,
but why?

836
00:40:25,781 --> 00:40:30,700
What had happened to him says he's 
clearly off anabolics and stuff.

837
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,780
Oh,
I see.

838
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:34,210
Wow.
Jesus Christ.

839
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,210
Well,
you know that guy,

840
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:38,283
when he was as big as he was at the top,
he had to be on just staggering amounts 

841
00:40:43,511 --> 00:40:44,344
of that stuff.
That's what people don't understand 

842
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,890
this.
You even if you.

843
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,440
I do know one dude though.
I have to be honest.

844
00:40:50,441 --> 00:40:54,610
I know one dude that I know who never 
took anything.

845
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,280
I know he didn't because he didn't.
He wouldn't even eat vitamins.

846
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,193
I eat all his vegetables.
He's a very smart guy and he got really 

847
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,010
big,
like ridiculous.

848
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:05,020
He was my friend Brian Frazier.
He's a writer.

849
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,453
He's a comic out of Boston and at one 
point in time he was fucking enormous 

850
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,090
and I know all he did was work out.
That's all he did.

851
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,133
He was just a,
a dedicated bodybuilder dedicated to 

852
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:20,140
lifting weights.
He was fucking gigantic.

853
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,540
And so he was cleaning out those 
genetics,

854
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,590
but he was.
No,

855
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,710
it wasn't even genetics.
He was just dedicated,

856
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:28,210
just dedicated,
just dedicated hard work.

857
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,750
And he got it,
read it,

858
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,710
read it while I was entering 
competitions.

859
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,580
He was ridiculously

860
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:37,430
swoll so much.
So that one time you went up on stage,

861
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,080
he had a,
uh,

862
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,003
like a,
like a golf shirt on like an alligator 

863
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:44,180
shirt and he came off stage.
I pulled him aside and said,

864
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:44,920
dude,
listen to me.

865
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,720
You can't go on or short sleeve shirts.
And he goes,

866
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:48,540
why?
I go,

867
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,130
your arms are way too big.
Way Too distracting me.

868
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,040
I'm like,
I'm your friend and that distracted me.

869
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,360
You're,
you're up there like,

870
00:41:56,361 --> 00:41:58,660
you're so intimidating,
like crazy because he's,

871
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,140
he was so swollen.
I was like,

872
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,540
you can't,
you can't go on stage like that.

873
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:04,130
Nobody wants to see that.
I feel like that's how I wanted to be at

874
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:06,590
one point.
I feel like that's what I wanted.

875
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,090
Yeah,
but maybe it's this.

876
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,300
Maybe it's the height thing,
we want to be wired that way and because

877
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:12,134
you know,
you know a little bit shorter than the 

878
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,780
normal men,
you want to be.

879
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,820
Exactly.
We can't go north south,

880
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,830
but I think that if you really wanted to
do it though,

881
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:26,090
you would be like,
Brian,

882
00:42:26,091 --> 00:42:28,400
you would be dedicated to it and you'd 
really want to do it.

883
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,234
You get into it,
but it's one of those things where you 

884
00:42:30,951 --> 00:42:31,784
want to do it,
but you're also like a guy who really 

885
00:42:33,471 --> 00:42:37,900
enjoys life and there's too many things 
that I have to be dedicated to math.

886
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:38,823
It's fucking hard.
You're not to be dedicated to music to 

887
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:42,131
this,
to that.

888
00:42:42,131 --> 00:42:44,720
It's a fucking everybody family.
Just like,

889
00:42:44,721 --> 00:42:47,630
come on man.
You know how many more things I have to.

890
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,450
But I think if you do decide to do 
something like that,

891
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,284
I think what you're saying is what's 
really the true thing that a lot of 

892
00:42:54,021 --> 00:42:54,854
people that we're trying to avoid when 
it comes to losing weight or changing 

893
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,333
your life,
it's like you have to be dedicated to 

894
00:42:59,841 --> 00:43:00,590
that.

895
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,240
It can't be something to do like,
Hey,

896
00:43:02,241 --> 00:43:03,700
I'm dedicated to my music.
Hey,

897
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,160
I'm dedicated to,
you know,

898
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,620
whatever my golf game,
but I'm out.

899
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,560
I'm going to lose weight to like,
no,

900
00:43:09,561 --> 00:43:12,920
you have to be dead gas.
That has to be your main goal in life is

901
00:43:12,950 --> 00:43:15,140
to be doing that.
You have to focus on that.

902
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,460
Pissed to one of them are going to try 
to change your chemistry and when people

903
00:43:19,461 --> 00:43:21,320
do it,
it's so fucking impressive.

904
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,183
I mean,
how many people have you met that have 

905
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,900
lost like a hundred pounds and you just 
want to just shake their hand and go,

906
00:43:26,901 --> 00:43:28,370
dude,
you fucking did it,

907
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,200
bro.
He lost 100 pounds.

908
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,200
I lost 80 and I gained it back and 
there's one truck and a bad.

909
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,250
My fluctuation.
It's crazy.

910
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,130
Have you ever thought about.
I mean I know you love food,

911
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,180
but if you ever thought about like 
changing the kinds of foods you eat.

912
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:45,751
Yeah,
of course.

913
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:46,584
Just,
you know,

914
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,430
I don't think it's the,
it's the defined foods that I eat.

915
00:43:49,431 --> 00:43:53,510
I think it's the refined sugars and 
disgusting shit that I decided to eat.

916
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:56,150
Why don't you try to wish that I had 
last night?

917
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,380
What'd you have?
A chip?

918
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:58,214
Which with the chip,
which it's a fucking to toll house 

919
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:02,990
cookies with ice cream in between.
That sounds awesome.

920
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:04,910
It was good and it was melted and I 
still ate it.

921
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,900
Damn fucking disgusting.
It's piglets shit,

922
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,800
right?
Shit.

923
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,833
We actually.
He actually had it in his pocket for 

924
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:17,960
about a half an hour before I.
before I hated it.

925
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,210
I'm like,
God.

926
00:44:20,211 --> 00:44:22,670
Yeah,
so I bet it was glorious.

927
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,533
It was who?
My friend Aubrey has the best way of 

928
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:27,464
looking at it.
We were talking about it and he was 

929
00:44:28,641 --> 00:44:29,474
like,
it's so crazy that just just a few 

930
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:32,034
moments of mouth pleasure is worth 
fucking up your entire body like your 

931
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:37,134
body,
the thing that carries you around in 

932
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:39,294
this light,
the thing that you need more than 

933
00:44:40,201 --> 00:44:42,990
anything and just for a few moments of 
mouth.

934
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:44,290
Pleasure.
Long,

935
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,440
long.
Oh,

936
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,290
and then you feel in your whole body 
going,

937
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,360
what did you just throw in here?
And have us deal with you ass crazy.

938
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:57,240
It's fucking asshole.
Fucking nuts.

939
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:58,950
What a cruel,
sick,

940
00:44:59,040 --> 00:44:59,873
fucked up joke nature has played on us 
to make the things that are the most 

941
00:45:03,391 --> 00:45:07,150
delicious going down the worst for your 
body out.

942
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:08,243
That's a fucking conspiracy.
What I want our current nature is they 

943
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:16,230
just dirty guts.
What a bitch you imagine man,

944
00:45:16,231 --> 00:45:21,231
like,
like if you're eating fried chicken with

945
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:23,120
waffles.
Okay.

946
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:24,143
Fried chicken with waffles is one of the
most fucking bang up meals America's 

947
00:45:27,211 --> 00:45:28,044
ever created.
Like a good solid to put butter on the 

948
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:34,110
wealth.
Of course like Roscoe's Roscoe's chicken

949
00:45:34,111 --> 00:45:34,944
and waffles.
Just the sheer amount of sugar you are 

950
00:45:37,591 --> 00:45:38,424
taken in with the want drink.
You're going to have to have a diet 

951
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:44,760
coke.

952
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,760
You gotta get the fucking the fucking.
It's like Koolaid.

953
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,990
What is sense it.
It's like an orange drink.

954
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,700
Red Drink and yellow drink.
Mixed is throw them all together.

955
00:45:59,701 --> 00:46:01,800
That's the sunset.
It's fucking stupid.

956
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,113
But then if you want to get nuts,
do you throw butter on the fried 

957
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:08,160
chicken?
Maple Syrup definitely.

958
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,340
But then you have to have the grits as 
well that has made butter in it.

959
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,553
And uh,
you know,

960
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,513
it's like when does it end?
I think the issue is the sheer grams of 

961
00:46:19,891 --> 00:46:24,690
sugar you're taking in from the waffle 
and the Maple Syrup alone,

962
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,860
you must be taking in an ungodly amount 
of sugar.

963
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,270
Yeah.
Straight off that stuff.

964
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,750
Yeah,
because I drench those things to the way

965
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:35,940
I do it.
It's like if I'm having some maple syrup

966
00:46:35,941 --> 00:46:37,650
I'm going to go in.
Can Be covered.

967
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,610
I went in,
yeah.

968
00:46:38,611 --> 00:46:39,990
I'm not going to drizzle it and go.

969
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,060
I wish I would've had a little bit more 
maple syrup,

970
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:43,380
but I'm pink.
Sensible enough.

971
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:44,520
Fuck that.
Fuck that.

972
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,133
If you're eating Roscoe's,
you know it probably already made some 

973
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,470
critical errors and you're doing a crazy
dire right now.

974
00:46:52,471 --> 00:46:53,520
Right?
Right now.

975
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:55,350
So that's what I'm saying.
Like if you,

976
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:57,690
if you will,
you can't even have a cheat day.

977
00:46:57,710 --> 00:46:59,370
Kenya,
you're not supposed to.

978
00:46:59,371 --> 00:47:01,260
I had a beer yesterday.
That's what I'm saying.

979
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:02,840
Like it's supposed to have beer but 
have.

980
00:47:02,850 --> 00:47:05,540
See you didn't go all out.
If you have a cheat day,

981
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,560
just like,
yeah,

982
00:47:07,561 --> 00:47:08,394
I haven't gone all out.
I've just decided to try it for 60 days 

983
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:12,980
and you know.
Well,

984
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,380
I want to just see what it's about.
I don't,

985
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,410
I don't think you really evaluate.
I think I've,

986
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:18,553
I've been eating pretty healthy but one 
way my whole life and I took some time 

987
00:47:23,251 --> 00:47:26,010
off of gluten for awhile and I liked 
that,

988
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,590
but what I liked about it was that I 
felt like really what was going on was I

989
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:30,100
was just taking

990
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,130
in way less sugar by not having pastas 
and breads,

991
00:47:33,131 --> 00:47:33,964
which I really love.
I was just taking them way less sugar 

992
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:38,500
and I lost weight.
My face got thinner and I was like,

993
00:47:38,501 --> 00:47:41,980
this is interesting.
It's like how much of what I'm taking in

994
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:42,843
is sugar.
So I went back to occasionally eating 

995
00:47:45,551 --> 00:47:50,551
bread and just trying to avoid it.
And then from the last 15 or maybe 16,

996
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,480
15 days,
something like that,

997
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,600
I've been doing this where I'm doing 
nothing.

998
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,760
No grains,
no pasta,

999
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:59,440
no bread,
no sugar,

1000
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:03,010
nothing.
That's just nothing other than plants,

1001
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:05,290
vegetables,
fats,

1002
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,300
coconut oil,
shit like that and meet.

1003
00:48:07,570 --> 00:48:09,280
That's it.
So it's Kinda like that.

1004
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,560
It's kind of like the Atkins died from 
back in the day,

1005
00:48:11,561 --> 00:48:13,930
right where you just sort of.
But more fats,

1006
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,930
fats,
fats even than proteins.

1007
00:48:16,931 --> 00:48:17,764
It's actually what the Diet is saying is
that we use too much protein and that 

1008
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,243
like if you want to do some extreme 
power lifting and you want to get to be 

1009
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,710
the size of Paul dillet,
delay,

1010
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,200
delay those Arnold Schwartzenegger.

1011
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,680
How about that?
You gotta you know you have to eat a lot

1012
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:38,200
more than the average person,
but for the average person,

1013
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:40,210
the average person,
it's like reasonably athletic.

1014
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:41,103
You'll probably doesn't really want to 
process all that extra protein and what 

1015
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,273
it really needs to burn.
It's fats and so your body will convert 

1016
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:50,913
anything in the energy that you put.
If you live off of a carbohydrate based 

1017
00:48:54,971 --> 00:48:55,804
diet,
their argument is you know you're 

1018
00:48:56,981 --> 00:49:00,670
subject to more fluctuations.
You're your levels,

1019
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,504
rise and fall.
That's when you crash after you eat and 

1020
00:49:04,661 --> 00:49:06,310
when you know you haven't eaten in a 
while,

1021
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:07,144
you're starving and a lot of that I 
think is also related to gut bacteria 

1022
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,100
and I'm starting to learn more about 
that,

1023
00:49:12,101 --> 00:49:15,100
but not enough really where I can talk 
probiotic stuff,

1024
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,720
probiotics,
gut bacteria,

1025
00:49:16,721 --> 00:49:19,510
and just the amount of different things 
that you eat,

1026
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:20,830
like what?

1027
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,480
There's certain types of gut bacteria 
that thrive off of unhealthy food and if

1028
00:49:26,681 --> 00:49:27,514
you're eating a lot of sugars,
apparently what they're saying is that 

1029
00:49:30,101 --> 00:49:30,934
there's different types of gut bacteria 
that crave that sugar and so when you 

1030
00:49:35,081 --> 00:49:37,020
haven't had in awhile that gut back to 
you,

1031
00:49:37,021 --> 00:49:40,990
even if you're full,
you might have like pot roast and mashed

1032
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:43,450
potatoes and vegetables and it was like 
nothing.

1033
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,770
Nothing fucked up at all.
Right?

1034
00:49:44,771 --> 00:49:47,050
You eat that and your body's like,
hey asshole,

1035
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:48,490
where's the sugar?
Come on,

1036
00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:50,620
come on.
Because they're craving craving it.

1037
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:54,280
Like those rumbles that you would get.
So I don't know what.

1038
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:58,420
I don't know if that's the case with me,
so I'm just giving it 60 hold days,

1039
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:00,970
see what it's like,
you know?

1040
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:04,150
And if I,
if I like how I'm feeling after 60 days,

1041
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,790
I'll tell you right now though,
just a couple of weeks in.

1042
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:08,260
It's awesome.
I feel great.

1043
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,140
I feel great.
Um,

1044
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,480
I feel I don't feel very hungry in 
between meals,

1045
00:50:13,481 --> 00:50:14,314
which is interesting.
So go eat and then I guess once you get 

1046
00:50:18,041 --> 00:50:20,860
fat adapted you don't,
you just don't have as many crashes.

1047
00:50:21,070 --> 00:50:24,430
I just don't know if it's like what I 
want to do sustainably because it's hard

1048
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:26,590
when you go to a restaurant or something
like that.

1049
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,000
It's hard to tell them he

1050
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:29,223
can't even have rice.
Like there's a lot of delicious deep 

1051
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:31,963
dishes that come with Rice.
Like you can't even have rice with a 

1052
00:50:34,221 --> 00:50:36,590
meal.
Like that seems so extreme.

1053
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,230
So unbelievable.
But so far so good.

1054
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,990
Every time have attempted to lose 
weight.

1055
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,720
It was like I did that Atkins Diet back 
in the day,

1056
00:50:44,721 --> 00:50:45,554
but it felt like I'm eating eggs and 
sausage and all this nasty shit and 

1057
00:50:50,271 --> 00:50:51,770
still losing weight.
Yeah.

1058
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:53,143
I didn't understand that,
but I fucking ate a piece of bread and 

1059
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:56,444
it would be over.
I put five pounds on [inaudible] not 

1060
00:50:58,761 --> 00:50:59,470
crazy.
And it's just,

1061
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:00,303
it's not worth it.
And then you feel shittier than you did 

1062
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:06,220
because you gain all that weight and you
ate all that disgusting stuff that's got

1063
00:51:06,221 --> 00:51:07,670
to be sticking to somewhere,
right?

1064
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:09,283
Well,
it's just hard for your body to process 

1065
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:11,063
exact,
become sugar and not fucking makes you 

1066
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:16,090
shit really badly,
really badly rich.

1067
00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:20,420
Like you can't leave the house.
You have to run to the fucking bad.

1068
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,630
But the Atkins is,
uh,

1069
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:24,643
a little bit different than this start 
that I'm doing and that this guy just 

1070
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:30,230
has more fat.
But you still go into that same thing,

1071
00:51:30,231 --> 00:51:31,190
right?
To ketosis.

1072
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:35,980
That's what they want you to do.
That's the point of these guides.

1073
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,220
Yup.
Yeah.

1074
00:51:37,221 --> 00:51:41,040
So your body starts burning fat.
And it's fascinating.

1075
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,320
The most fascinating thing about it is 
seeing people argue it from both sides.

1076
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,690
Seeing people argue that this is bad for
your health and you're,

1077
00:51:48,691 --> 00:51:50,060
you're,
you're fucking up.

1078
00:51:50,061 --> 00:51:52,340
And don't do this.
Like people get upset,

1079
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,590
like they get upset,
like to try and Satanism,

1080
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:56,240
you know,
it's like all of a sudden like,

1081
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,074
oh,
well I'm thinking maybe Satan's maybe 

1082
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,173
saying he's got a point.
I'm going to go meet these guys and I'm 

1083
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:01,490
just gonna.

1084
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:02,720
See,
I'm just going to see what's going on.

1085
00:52:02,900 --> 00:52:03,733
Like that's how they're behaving.
When you talking about just going on 

1086
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:10,160
this key to genic diet,
they pretend like you're doing something

1087
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,240
evil,
like don't do it.

1088
00:52:11,241 --> 00:52:12,650
You're going to fuck yourself up,
man.

1089
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:13,610
Cut it out.
Yeah,

1090
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:14,443
like anyone really fucking knows.
And then they start posting all these 

1091
00:52:17,061 --> 00:52:19,820
pro car like you know,
more carbs.

1092
00:52:19,821 --> 00:52:23,780
Hashtag carb up.
Carb is brain fuel or come on,

1093
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,380
but he just relax.
Relax.

1094
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,820
I said I'm trying to for 60 days.
I'm not going to lie.

1095
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:29,654
It's not the easiest thing to have to 
give up those sheep's milk on your 

1096
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:39,020
little day in the fucking Nilkie.
I know New York is very good stuff.

1097
00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:39,903
A hostile linguine with clams sauce as a
place that just opened up directly 

1098
00:52:43,581 --> 00:52:45,990
across the street from my house.
Incredible.

1099
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:48,900
It has one of my favorite dishes ever.
It's like,

1100
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:49,743
Gotcha.
We peppy just cheese and pepper with 

1101
00:52:51,531 --> 00:52:53,010
pasta.
Oh my God.

1102
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:54,890
But she does it with the pink 
peppercorn.

1103
00:52:55,190 --> 00:52:57,710
So it's like you're eating a bowl of 
flowers.

1104
00:52:57,920 --> 00:52:58,753
Wow.
One of the most incredible things in 

1105
00:52:59,931 --> 00:53:01,940
life.
I crave it.

1106
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,190
God dammit.
This diet's bullshit.

1107
00:53:04,191 --> 00:53:06,330
Exactly my bad.
I'm sorry about.

1108
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,350
It's definitely about pasta.
Please keep talking.

1109
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,240
Take my pants off real quick.

1110
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:14,713
Pasta,
whore.

1111
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,333
That's what you will.
There's just something about pasta 

1112
00:53:18,351 --> 00:53:20,810
that's.
It's like a.

1113
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,330
it's,
it's the real comfort food,

1114
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,470
you know,
for you.

1115
00:53:25,471 --> 00:53:26,460
For me,
for sure.

1116
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,750
Yeah.
Like Ravioli's.

1117
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,430
Just cheese.
Ravioli's with like a good sauce.

1118
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,730
Like a fried fried,
fried Ravioli.

1119
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,653
I've never had it.
Just fucking do it as if you were doing 

1120
00:53:38,351 --> 00:53:39,930
the chicken cutlet.
Put it into the egg.

1121
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:41,490
Really?
Breadcrumb.

1122
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:43,470
You'll thank me.
Trust me.

1123
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:46,220
Wow.
Like a chicken colors.

1124
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,390
Unbelievable.
Fried Ravioli.

1125
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,800
Woo.
Some unbelievable.

1126
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,530
Jamie shaking his head.
You've been all over this country.

1127
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:54,930
I'm surprised you've never eaten.
Fried Ravioli.

1128
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:56,333
Submit Western thing to some standards 
that I have that I have to like stick 

1129
00:54:00,301 --> 00:54:01,320
with.
Like,

1130
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,490
you know,
like if I go to Philly,

1131
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:04,680
I'm having a cheese day.
One hundred percent standard.

1132
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:06,330
What does that.
Do you eat pork?

1133
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:08,040
Yes,
but what about the pork sandwich?

1134
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,310
That I feel like the cheese steak is a 
bit overrated over there.

1135
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:12,143
I feel like my guy listen to me,
the guy at my Deli in queens makes a 

1136
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:19,290
fucking better cheese.
Steak,

1137
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:20,250
watts.
Then who?

1138
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:21,800
Then?
All Philadelphia.

1139
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,650
Not.
No,

1140
00:54:22,650 --> 00:54:23,271
no.
Let's,

1141
00:54:23,271 --> 00:54:24,104
let's not get crazy.
But that's what you're saying better 

1142
00:54:27,061 --> 00:54:29,790
because they're not.
They usually not flavored.

1143
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:30,660
Oh,
okay.

1144
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:32,100
You know what I mean?
They just do the steak.

1145
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:33,510
The cheese.
There's no salt.

1146
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:37,820
That needs to be salt a little bit.
At least a little bit of salt with me.

1147
00:54:37,821 --> 00:54:39,870
It was always good and you know,
it brings out the flavor.

1148
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,850
You know,
I don't want to have to drench it in hot

1149
00:54:41,851 --> 00:54:43,260
sauce or ketchup.
Imagine that.

1150
00:54:43,261 --> 00:54:44,970
Like you're telling everybody.
Everybody's fucking up.

1151
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,910
You need salt.
Get it together,

1152
00:54:47,911 --> 00:54:49,260
bitch.
It's just that simple.

1153
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:52,740
It's that simple.
And they've yet to.

1154
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:54,700
Well that's Fogo de Chao.
You have read it.

1155
00:54:54,930 --> 00:54:55,763
I have it.
One of the things about Fogo de Chao 

1156
00:54:57,001 --> 00:54:58,860
when you get a nice piece of Pecan.

1157
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:02,100
Yeah.
From them it's always got salt on it.

1158
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,123
It's always got a nice salty.
They have like a base that they based 

1159
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:07,104
the the meat on when they put them over 
the fire place to protect this 

1160
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,850
incredible.
So good.

1161
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,370
When they bring out that whole side of 
beef rib and they just.

1162
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,820
Oh,
that's ridiculous too,

1163
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:21,300
because you just get right after it.
You sit down to one of those places.

1164
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:24,990
They have a red and a green on your 
little card,

1165
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:27,090
like a poker chip.
Just flip it over.

1166
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:29,220
Whenever you're ready to party.
Like let's do this.

1167
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,173
He put it on green.
These dudes just start swooping in on 

1168
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:35,830
you with skewers.
Straight up with me and swords.

1169
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:39,660
Yeah.
Have you ever flipped it to read flipped

1170
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:40,860
a tourette?
No.

1171
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,380
Have you ever flip to read?
Have you ever flipped the thing to read?

1172
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:47,880
Oh yeah,
definitely.

1173
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,430
Fuck.
That stays on green.

1174
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:54,420
Wow.
Until we literally got a waddle out.

1175
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,230
You will.
And this explains my issue.

1176
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:00,480
Yeah.
We're all different.

1177
00:56:00,481 --> 00:56:01,314
We all have different needs.
I can't feel like a knowing that now I 

1178
00:56:07,471 --> 00:56:09,570
feel a little bit down.
Don't feel down.

1179
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:10,673
Red should.
Fears are undisputed world champion of 

1180
00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:15,840
continuing to eat at Fogo de Chao.
No one's been able to touch them.

1181
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:18,060
Rel Beats.
He already eats joey.

1182
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:21,180
He always.
He'd always tell me he just keeps going.

1183
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,070
Ari Shaffir can put away food.
Like probably almost no

1184
00:56:24,070 --> 00:56:26,300
one I've ever seen at one of those 
forgotten child.

1185
00:56:26,370 --> 00:56:28,210
He's ridiculous.
He just keeps it coming.

1186
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:29,860
I'm like,
where are you putting this?

1187
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,050
Because it just keeps it coming because 
he go get the rice and everything.

1188
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:38,051
I just goes for the meats,
a couple of pieces of lettuce.

1189
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,360
He's there.
He's there at parties.

1190
00:56:40,510 --> 00:56:41,343
You know that dude just,
he keeps that fucker grain like we all 

1191
00:56:43,991 --> 00:56:45,670
tap out and like Jesus,
sorry.

1192
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,580
And he's in the guys like coming by with
like some lamb chops.

1193
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:49,900
He was like,
sure we're going over different.

1194
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:52,540
That Joey,
Joey,

1195
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:54,340
what it is.
What is the Jelly?

1196
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:55,570
The Mint Mint.

1197
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:01,210
How many of these?
You've spoken a lot.

1198
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,360
I'm usually hitting the oil,
you know,

1199
00:57:04,361 --> 00:57:06,280
all day long.
Hitting that pure oil,

1200
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,983
taking some fucking mushrooms.
I just got some nice mushrooms and 

1201
00:57:11,801 --> 00:57:16,030
yesterday he'd be like,
food mushrooms are magic.

1202
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:17,510
Magical ones.
Yeah.

1203
00:57:17,850 --> 00:57:21,850
[inaudible] mushrooms.
How long before those illegal.

1204
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,930
How long before after pot becomes legal,
we all just get together and go,

1205
00:57:25,931 --> 00:57:26,980
hey,
cut this shit.

1206
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,860
All the people that made it illegal,
they're all dead now.

1207
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,660
We know there were liars.
I don't.

1208
00:57:31,661 --> 00:57:33,910
I don't even think it's illegal.
I don't know what you.

1209
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:35,230
Illegal.
I just think is legal.

1210
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,890
All it is is it's something that grows 
from here.

1211
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:41,890
Honor.
May I speak with my client.

1212
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:45,580
Just didn't,
didn't know I wasn't.

1213
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,000
What do you want me to say?
You were registered voter.

1214
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,340
Okay.
You already got.

1215
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:51,183
You have a driver's license.
You have to know what is and is not 

1216
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,520
legal as far as like what you're being 
arrested for it.

1217
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,160
Bad citizen.
Can't say that to her.

1218
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:01,870
You say,
let's try this again.

1219
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:06,790
Have you ever been hit in the head once?
Try to come up with some real.

1220
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,624
We.
I've reasonable believe my client has 

1221
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,450
sustained a head injury earlier in his 
life and virtually never recovered.

1222
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:17,770
What he needs is our care when he 
doesn't need is our judgment.

1223
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,023
I'm like Vincent Gigante,
he only feels going around like I'm 

1224
00:58:21,661 --> 00:58:22,494
local.
He only feels normal when he gets 

1225
00:58:23,561 --> 00:58:27,130
mushrooms in him.
That's when therapeutic use of mushrooms

1226
00:58:27,131 --> 00:58:28,150
is on its way,
folks.

1227
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,090
There's no doubt about that happen.
It should have happened a long time ago.

1228
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:33,370
It'd be better for all of us.
My girl and studying that.

1229
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:34,320
So is she?
Yeah.

1230
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:37,660
She's into like holistic medicine and 
healing through psychedelics.

1231
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:39,880
There's a lot of people that are 
involved in that now,

1232
00:58:39,881 --> 00:58:41,320
including maps,
the.

1233
00:58:41,530 --> 00:58:42,220
I don't know what it is.

1234
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:47,220
Multidisciplinary Association,
something Psychedelic Studies,

1235
00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,110
but these are acknowledging it,
right?

1236
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,023
Oh,
they've made some massive strides in 

1237
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:54,303
getting.
Trying to get therapeutic use of a Mtma 

1238
00:58:58,330 --> 00:59:01,180
for soldiers,
excuse me,

1239
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:02,014
and other people suffering from ptsd and
they're showing all these applied uses 

1240
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,043
of like really excellent compounds that 
have been demonized and and because 

1241
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:17,710
they've been deemed my demonize,
people that could really use them,

1242
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:21,380
aren't getting them like can you abuse 
them?

1243
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:22,214
But I think we've already established 
that's a dumb argument because you can 

1244
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:25,694
abuse anything.
You can go to a store and buy a hammer 

1245
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,490
and you can build houses or you could 
hit yourself in the Dick.

1246
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,550
You're fucking stupid.
You can do whatever you want.

1247
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,470
Right?
Like you can't.

1248
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:37,333
You can't.
That's not a good argument that someone 

1249
00:59:39,021 --> 00:59:40,790
could abuse it,
so it shouldn't be legal.

1250
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:44,180
There's massive amounts of shit to abuse
all over us all the time.

1251
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:47,240
So stop cars.
You get anything?

1252
00:59:47,270 --> 00:59:51,380
Bikes you can abuse everything.
I think the use of them,

1253
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,073
their magic.
There's a reason why we call magic 

1254
00:59:54,801 --> 00:59:56,810
mushrooms.
Absolutely fucking magic.

1255
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:57,973
You can,
you can have incredible experiences on 

1256
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:02,090
them and the fact that we are not 
allowed to.

1257
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,750
Then we have to worry about someone 
locking us in a cage for doing some shit

1258
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:07,850
that's not hurting anybody.
It's not even hurting you.

1259
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,223
Like mushrooms don't hurt you.
You have to take some insane amount of 

1260
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:14,390
um,
for it to be like the ld 50 rate.

1261
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,910
It's like you have to take pounds of it.
Right?

1262
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:17,923
What's The ld?
50 from micro from a psychedelic 

1263
01:00:20,001 --> 01:00:24,500
mushrooms or psilocybin?
It's really high.

1264
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:26,990
It's like something stupid like you 
can't,

1265
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:30,490
you almost can't even eat it.
How many pounds you have to eat.

1266
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,150
So this two grams had me on my fucking 
ass.

1267
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,300
This is from mice.
You killed mice with mushrooms.

1268
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:46,850
Oh my God.
First of all,

1269
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:48,280
that's what they go.
And have it.

1270
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,900
Here's something fucked up.
Scroll up,

1271
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:52,000
scroll down again,
scroll up again rather.

1272
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:54,100
So I could see this study.
Um,

1273
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:57,110
the name of the study was the name of 
the study at the top.

1274
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:58,303
How many dried mushrooms,
what I have to eat to die from an 

1275
01:01:00,321 --> 01:01:01,470
overdose.
Silicide.

1276
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,460
What is this on?
What website is this shrew?

1277
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:09,461
Marie Marie is.
How fucking crazy is that?

1278
01:01:10,191 --> 01:01:13,280
The dude asks,
he asks,

1279
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:16,640
how many mushrooms do I have to eat 
before overdose?

1280
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,333
Using the data for rats and accepting a 
medium of a median of one percent 

1281
01:01:23,301 --> 01:01:24,134
potency,
it would require the consumption of 

1282
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:31,600
1,680 grams of mushrooms to reach the ld
50 for a 60 kilogram rat.

1283
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:35,143
You have to eat a lot.

1284
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,733
Whoa.

1285
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,660
That's a lot of grams.
So,

1286
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:44,661
but rats are tougher than us.
Rats can eat rats and they don't die.

1287
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,713
Exactly.
Same each other mckinney even go off 

1288
01:01:47,101 --> 01:01:48,900
that.
I've told this story 100 times.

1289
01:01:48,901 --> 01:01:51,420
I killed a rat once in my driveway in 
my,

1290
01:01:51,421 --> 01:01:52,950
uh,
garage.

1291
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,890
Went out in the morning to clean the 
trap and it was gone.

1292
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,670
They had eaten them the others.
The others had eating them.

1293
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:02,070
Yeah,
dude,

1294
01:02:02,071 --> 01:02:05,550
I mean down to nothing.
Sounded like the tail and insane.

1295
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,310
Yeah,
savages,

1296
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:10,380
man.
It was just so.

1297
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:11,273
Yeah,
but it was so creepy to think that I'm 

1298
01:02:13,741 --> 01:02:14,574
sharing my house with cannibals,
like these are roden animal that when 

1299
01:02:20,761 --> 01:02:21,594
one of them dies,
the other ones just burned through them 

1300
01:02:23,161 --> 01:02:24,870
and there's.
There's a bunch of them around me.

1301
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,670
They were there in my ceiling.
I healed crawling around in there.

1302
01:02:27,671 --> 01:02:28,504
They're in the house.
They're just too small or too small for 

1303
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:35,340
them to kill me as Shit freaks me the 
fuck out man.

1304
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:36,174
At a squirrel in my house one time and 
the wool and you hear them three and no 

1305
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:41,004
more.
I'm sitting at three in the morning 

1306
01:02:41,701 --> 01:02:44,910
naked with my fucking just watching 
sports center

1307
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:48,790
and they started fighting screaming.
I'm like,

1308
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:51,110
Holy Fuck.
Is that in the ceiling?

1309
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:52,190
In the ceiling.
I'm like,

1310
01:02:52,191 --> 01:02:53,024
what?
I started hitting the ceiling with a 

1311
01:02:53,901 --> 01:02:55,260
broom.
Oh my God.

1312
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,150
I stopped.
I started hitting the closets,

1313
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,970
like trying to scare them and then

1314
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:05,000
eventually the motherfucker eight 
through the wall.

1315
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:10,220
One day I was laying on the couch and I 
just suddenly opened my eyes and look up

1316
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:15,760
and he's just fucking looking at me.
We make eye contact and it's like,

1317
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,070
it's a fucking.
It's a of,

1318
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,440
is about to be,
you know,

1319
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:25,780
like a Mexican shootout.
So it was,

1320
01:03:26,580 --> 01:03:28,640
it was crazy.
So then my,

1321
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,090
uh,
bad.

1322
01:03:30,410 --> 01:03:34,720
Then my Greek landlord decided to put 
traps out and I think that he

1323
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:39,910
literally slaughtered about 60 of them 
from the neighborhood.

1324
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,980
Oh my God.
It's not his fault.

1325
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,050
It's not his fault.
It was in the trap,

1326
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,430
the trap or listen,
they did bad things to the neighborhood.

1327
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:53,640
They would eat through lines grow.
Nobody gives a fuck about rats.

1328
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,393
If he killed 60 rats who had been like,
good kill 60,000 and I now feel bad 

1329
01:04:01,031 --> 01:04:03,640
about that.
Don't feel better because why is it?

1330
01:04:03,990 --> 01:04:07,150
Why is it if you kill squirrels,
people get bummed out.

1331
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,520
But if he killed rats,
people were like,

1332
01:04:09,521 --> 01:04:10,354
yeah,
you go kill him shit and fucking kill 

1333
01:04:11,261 --> 01:04:13,330
anything.
But at the end of the day shit happens.

1334
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:14,920
Yeah.
But if you're,

1335
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,740
if you're killing something with a trap,
you're definitely trying to kill it.

1336
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,640
Yeah.
Well,

1337
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:23,170
I had no involvement,
but I'm just wondering why we so readily

1338
01:04:23,171 --> 01:04:25,180
accept killing rats,
but not squirrels.

1339
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,950
Like how to rats.
It's viewed as vermin.

1340
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,600
I feel like squirrels have viewed as a 
lot of people.

1341
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,460
Yeah.
I feel like that's the case.

1342
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,360
Like an issue,
like a big federal hug.

1343
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,400
Same Shit.
In certain parts of the world,

1344
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,430
they're considered just as much of a 
nuisance as a rhet.

1345
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:46,810
Wow.
That's crazy.

1346
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:51,220
Where certain islands,
Jamaica as rats,

1347
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:52,900
what they think of him.
Like rats.

1348
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:56,410
I feel like squirrels like in just in 
New York,

1349
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:59,680
a lot of people just fucking scared of 
squirrels will do.

1350
01:04:59,681 --> 01:05:01,690
You know the difference between like 
tree squirrels,

1351
01:05:01,691 --> 01:05:04,360
those cute ones that everybody likes and
those ground squirrels.

1352
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:10,120
Ground squirrels are fucking crazy.
Ground squirrels.

1353
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:15,280
I was on this ranch in California and 
they have a ground squirrels problem and

1354
01:05:15,281 --> 01:05:18,340
we're driving down this road as we're 
driving down this road.

1355
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:19,443
You're watching these little tiny 
creatures pop their head out of the 

1356
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:25,090
ground,
run across and jump into another whole.

1357
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,620
There's holes all over the place and 
craps over there.

1358
01:05:29,621 --> 01:05:32,140
They would try a bunch of different shit
that grow in there.

1359
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,983
They have have cattle that are grazing.
They have a bunch of different things 

1360
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:36,754
going on there.
You can't do anything about these 

1361
01:05:39,011 --> 01:05:40,030
things.
There's so many of them.

1362
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:41,103
They say there's so many ground 
squirrels that the biomass of these 

1363
01:05:44,531 --> 01:05:48,430
things is like a biomass of like a giant
herd of cattle or something like that.

1364
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:52,120
There's so many of them.
It's like a 100 cows,

1365
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,233
like that's how many of these little 
fucking ground squirrels just running 

1366
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:55,900
around this area.

1367
01:05:55,900 --> 01:05:56,733
So what do they do?
I saw that they do these like where it 

1368
01:05:59,411 --> 01:06:00,244
gives them a shock.
They had these things where they put 

1369
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:06,250
food in and it kills them humanely.
They shocks him.

1370
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,650
I don't know how many there are.
I don't know if they know,

1371
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:09,753
like if you're driving down the road and
you just keep seeing these little heads 

1372
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:14,770
pop up and run across.
There's another one that's another one.

1373
01:06:14,830 --> 01:06:15,940
Bang,
pop up,

1374
01:06:15,941 --> 01:06:18,400
run across a little tiny thing they'll 
tell you wrote and boom.

1375
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:21,150
Jumped into a whole,
jumps into a hole and your wife's up.

1376
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,600
Scramble all.
Consequently you're like,

1377
01:06:22,601 --> 01:06:24,810
whoa,
if these were rats,

1378
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,700
I would be freaking the fuck out.
Right?

1379
01:06:27,710 --> 01:06:29,350
Nipping,
I'd be going,

1380
01:06:29,351 --> 01:06:30,360
Jesus,
fuck it.

1381
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:34,240
If you were driving down New York City 
and that's the kind of.

1382
01:06:34,410 --> 01:06:37,510
That's what you saw with rats.
Just pop it up and running across.

1383
01:06:37,510 --> 01:06:39,100
Popping in the whole.
Everybody be like,

1384
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,610
let's get the fuck out of here.
Fucking run.

1385
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:44,813
We got to get out of the city.
It would be like that scene in aliens 

1386
01:06:46,931 --> 01:06:50,590
for the dude was talking about nuking it
from orbit it up.

1387
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:52,630
You got to get out of the city.
We're going to poison everything.

1388
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:55,750
We're going to take five years off the 
city and then we can return.

1389
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:58,420
Just poison everything there for five 
years.

1390
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,600
Heavy,
but these little ground squirrels,

1391
01:07:01,990 --> 01:07:03,640
they're a little cuter,
slightly cuter,

1392
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:09,480
so they're more accepted like all those 
little animals.

1393
01:07:09,761 --> 01:07:12,940
A cute little rats.
Not that cute.

1394
01:07:13,540 --> 01:07:16,900
Not really into them.
There's something about him that just to

1395
01:07:17,020 --> 01:07:17,853
untrustworthy the true rat,
like people that have rats for pets 

1396
01:07:23,591 --> 01:07:25,570
though they love them.
It's the same thing.

1397
01:07:25,571 --> 01:07:28,300
I mean,
if you have a domesticated animal and it

1398
01:07:28,301 --> 01:07:31,270
grows up with you and it's care for its 
entire life,

1399
01:07:31,271 --> 01:07:33,130
then you become like family,
you know,

1400
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,600
just like a dog or a cat.

1401
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,700
But if you've ever been around a feral 
cat,

1402
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:39,760
have ever been around a feral dog,
like Ooh,

1403
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:42,010
they can.
That can be really scary.

1404
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:43,493
I had a cat.
My mother rescued a cat when I was 

1405
01:07:47,321 --> 01:07:52,321
younger in the fucking cat attack me.
It was a feral cat.

1406
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,990
It was,
it was a white cat and it was,

1407
01:07:56,320 --> 01:07:58,480
it was abused.
Jesus Christ.

1408
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,230
It wasn't like,
you know,

1409
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:02,500
I was fucking with it a little bit like,
you know,

1410
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,840
that's scared rabbit.
It's neck and shit and like,

1411
01:08:04,841 --> 01:08:05,674
you know,
the back which skin and he fucking 

1412
01:08:08,441 --> 01:08:11,050
snapped and bit the shit out of me and 
scratched me.

1413
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:13,240
Jesus went nuts.
She would've stopped.

1414
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,460
Fuck man.
Right Randall?

1415
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:20,510
I slept with them.
I deserved it.

1416
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:23,590
They can be terrifying now.
It's,

1417
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:28,630
it's amazing how powerful a little cat 
is that ferocious there.

1418
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:30,410
Yeah,
it's nonstop.

1419
01:08:30,990 --> 01:08:31,823
The two quick,
you don't know what to do and you panic 

1420
01:08:34,551 --> 01:08:37,790
because like,
what the fuck is this fucking thing?

1421
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:40,190
He's attacking me.
What is this?

1422
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,560
Yeah,
it's not a human and they'll,

1423
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:45,560
they're going to go full bore.
Whereas you're gonna Kinda pull back.

1424
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:51,140
They're gonna.
I mean there's just such a better design

1425
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:55,460
as far as like killing things.
Their bodies are so well designed.

1426
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:58,730
When you watched that guy that was like 
jumping across those buildings,

1427
01:08:58,930 --> 01:08:59,990
cats would be like,
bitch,

1428
01:08:59,991 --> 01:09:01,790
I do that.
All the easy,

1429
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:04,880
easy.
They do that so gently around my house.

1430
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,560
You know,
they just leap.

1431
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:07,543
All of a sudden,
boom,

1432
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,070
they're on the couch.
Leap book there on the table,

1433
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:11,600
right.
Walk across leap.

1434
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:12,620
Boom.
They're on the ground.

1435
01:09:13,550 --> 01:09:16,400
They walk on railings.
Balancing Act on railings.

1436
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:17,710
What about those?
Um,

1437
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:21,320
I love watching those shows on national 
geographic.

1438
01:09:21,321 --> 01:09:25,610
Like when they make the kill then they 
drag it all the way up into the tree.

1439
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:26,740
Birds know,
like,

1440
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,800
you know,
like lepage,

1441
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:31,550
dragging it,
and a moose up into the fucking like,

1442
01:09:31,551 --> 01:09:33,950
you kidding me?
They're so scary.

1443
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,520
Gotcha.
That's a design.

1444
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,300
He grabbed them with their teeth.
Look at this level.

1445
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,160
This is the recent one.
Yeah.

1446
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:42,200
Oh my God.
This was in India,

1447
01:09:42,201 --> 01:09:44,960
right?
It got loose was just jacking people.

1448
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,390
Look at that.
Oh my God.

1449
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:50,420
I just jumped up and bit that guy.
Oh my God.

1450
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,450
Can you jump in the water?
Is that safe or no?

1451
01:09:53,820 --> 01:09:54,653
I can.
I swim.

1452
01:09:54,820 --> 01:09:56,820
I don't swim.
I think that.

1453
01:09:57,020 --> 01:09:59,390
Let's jump into woo man.
Oh my God.

1454
01:09:59,391 --> 01:10:00,620
Look at this thing.
Biting him,

1455
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:01,693
man.

1456
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:06,470
That guy got someone threw him a fucking
stick.

1457
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:11,120
You saw someone throw a mystic.
Jesus Christ as terrifying man.

1458
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:16,910
That is fucking terrifying.
That animals so powerful too.

1459
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:21,340
That's a big cat.
I think looked like it was 150 pounds.

1460
01:10:21,341 --> 01:10:26,341
At least.
Just imagine a 150 pound house cat.

1461
01:10:27,130 --> 01:10:32,130
Fuck yeah.
Fuck all that dude.

1462
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,920
You know,
Uhm,

1463
01:10:37,460 --> 01:10:38,293
were so poorly designed when it comes to
like being able to defend ourselves 

1464
01:10:41,841 --> 01:10:44,030
against something like that were so 
poorly designed.

1465
01:10:44,710 --> 01:10:45,543
It's amazing.
Other animals have such a way better 

1466
01:10:47,931 --> 01:10:52,931
shot athletically.
Even chimps.

1467
01:10:53,360 --> 01:10:56,300
Chimps are so much stronger than us.
They have a way better shot at surviving

1468
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,600
and Capitec fucking swinging from trees 
going nuts.

1469
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:01,120
That was one of the things.
They found them out,

1470
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:04,220
those big giant chimps in the Congo that
they nest on the ground,

1471
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:06,080
like gorillas,
gorillas,

1472
01:11:06,081 --> 01:11:08,330
nest in the ground because nobody wants 
to fuck with the gorilla.

1473
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,690
Cats don't want to fuck with the grill.
It's like too much work.

1474
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:15,450
You can easily get your jaw broke.
Your leg broke.

1475
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,460
Yeah.
They can't fuck with gorillas.

1476
01:11:17,461 --> 01:11:19,790
It's too hard.
They might catch a baby slipping,

1477
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:21,630
you know,
they might be able to catch a baby,

1478
01:11:22,010 --> 01:11:25,080
like you know something.
If it gets separated from his mom at the

1479
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,730
ripe,
you know that that's possible.

1480
01:11:26,731 --> 01:11:29,100
But like a regular size gorilla.
Good luck.

1481
01:11:29,550 --> 01:11:32,760
No fucking way.
They don't have to be stucking yeah.

1482
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:34,560
So they sleep in the ground where chimp 
sleeping,

1483
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:35,550
the trees,
chimps,

1484
01:11:35,551 --> 01:11:39,360
you still got to be careful,
but they found these big giant chimps in

1485
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:40,990
the Congo,
the column a,

1486
01:11:40,991 --> 01:11:44,790
the billy ape or the Bondo ape.
And um,

1487
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:48,420
they were just a legend for the longest 
time they were in that.

1488
01:11:48,550 --> 01:11:50,820
That book,
Michael Crighton's books that it was the

1489
01:11:50,821 --> 01:11:51,601
Congo.
Is that,

1490
01:11:51,601 --> 01:11:53,670
who wrote that?
Who are seeing the movie?

1491
01:11:54,040 --> 01:11:56,610
Was it quite in the road that you see 
that movie?

1492
01:11:56,611 --> 01:11:57,540
Congo?
Yeah.

1493
01:11:57,620 --> 01:11:58,530
It's kind of silly.
It was that.

1494
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,310
Yeah,
it was terrible.

1495
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:01,830
It was terrible.
But the guy with the accent,

1496
01:12:01,831 --> 01:12:03,480
you know,
the one is always in all those movies,

1497
01:12:03,481 --> 01:12:06,450
the Weirdo,
which guys are fucking weird guy.

1498
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:10,940
He was like,
the flavors,

1499
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:12,630
the guide,
he was terrible.

1500
01:12:12,631 --> 01:12:14,660
He's like,
I don't remember the,

1501
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:15,880
you'll see his face.
He was,

1502
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:17,620
fuck you guy.
It was just not a,

1503
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:19,860
not a very good movie.
That guy,

1504
01:12:19,861 --> 01:12:21,570
that's not a,
that's on him.

1505
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:23,790
But that was after the Congo.
Whereas the doctor,

1506
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:25,610
her.
Nah,

1507
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:26,670
this,
there's another one,

1508
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:29,240
the one who was looking for all areas.
What?

1509
01:12:29,460 --> 01:12:30,600
Who,
where he is.

1510
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,243
Timothy,

1511
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:35,270
that guy.
You've seen them.

1512
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:38,120
But that was great.
That's the guy from rocky horror picture

1513
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:38,954
show.
Exactly.

1514
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,070
As slugging.
Yeah.

1515
01:12:43,380 --> 01:12:46,160
Thank you.
Yeah.

1516
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:47,123
Yeah,
I like him.

1517
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,050
Well,
the movie dealt with.

1518
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:50,913
See that monkey up there.
The one picture that's supposedly what 

1519
01:12:54,311 --> 01:12:55,144
these giant chimps look like.
So in the movie they were these 

1520
01:13:00,431 --> 01:13:03,790
fictional animals that will look super 
smart and they were really big,

1521
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:09,250
but it is based on this thing.
This is a real one.

1522
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,760
Wow.
This is a real one that uh,

1523
01:13:12,070 --> 01:13:14,230
someone had killed,
like at the turn of the century,

1524
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,400
that's one that they shot in an airport,
uh,

1525
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:18,243
in Africa.
Look at the size of that thing in 

1526
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:20,704
comparison to those men.
You're talking about a chimp that could 

1527
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:26,320
get to be like 400 pounds.
There are enormous.

1528
01:13:26,350 --> 01:13:28,140
It is ridiculous.
And so they,

1529
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:31,330
they sleep on the ground just like 
gorillas do.

1530
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,510
And there's a small population of them.
They just recently found them.

1531
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,430
Well,
there's a Swiss,

1532
01:13:36,431 --> 01:13:37,264
I think for Swiss wildlife photographer 
named Carl or mom and he took some 

1533
01:13:40,991 --> 01:13:45,760
photos of them with a camera trap.
Put up a photo camera trap.

1534
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:47,020
Bondo.
Ape.

1535
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,440
I think I'm saying his name right.
Carl Armaun.

1536
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:51,790
But he,
um,

1537
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,650
yeah,
the upper left.

1538
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,320
That's it.
Th.

1539
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:56,530
Those photos.
Yeah,

1540
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:57,880
that's the same thing.
See,

1541
01:13:57,881 --> 01:14:00,100
I'm one of them.
What does it say,

1542
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,290
Carl?
What's also in,

1543
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,470
just for everybody,
it's a,

1544
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:07,450
excuse me,
Carl K,

1545
01:14:07,451 --> 01:14:08,284
a r l a m m a n n and he got these 
camera trap photos of them walking 

1546
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,673
upright

1547
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,433
and that's.
That was the most fucked up thing about 

1548
01:14:17,501 --> 01:14:18,180
it.
Really.

1549
01:14:18,180 --> 01:14:20,010
Shit.
I didn't even realize what I was looking

1550
01:14:20,011 --> 01:14:21,720
at.
A six foot,

1551
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,440
that's a six foot tall chimp that's 
walking upright.

1552
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:28,463
I mean they're really big.
They're way bigger than a regular champ 

1553
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:32,453
and it's.
They have a crest in their head like 

1554
01:14:33,601 --> 01:14:35,430
gorillas.
Do you know gorillas?

1555
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:37,890
Gorillas are one of the few primates it 
has.

1556
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:38,783
If you look at it skull,
they have a crest in the skull where 

1557
01:14:42,691 --> 01:14:43,524
these massive chewing muscles fighting 
muscles all sort of congregate on their 

1558
01:14:48,481 --> 01:14:49,314
head.
They have these huge jaw muscles and 

1559
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:52,584
these huge clampdown muscles and they 
have this cleft in the top of their 

1560
01:14:56,101 --> 01:14:58,800
head.
I pull up Bondo,

1561
01:14:58,801 --> 01:15:02,460
ape skull and they'll.
They had a.

1562
01:15:02,720 --> 01:15:05,730
They found the skulls of these things 
and at first they were like,

1563
01:15:05,731 --> 01:15:07,200
okay,
is this a hybrid?

1564
01:15:07,230 --> 01:15:09,990
Like what is this?
See it,

1565
01:15:10,410 --> 01:15:12,810
see how it has like crest at the top of 
the head.

1566
01:15:13,950 --> 01:15:15,990
So now that they know that it's a real 
animal,

1567
01:15:15,991 --> 01:15:16,451
they're like,
well,

1568
01:15:16,451 --> 01:15:19,730
this is the first chimp they've ever 
found that has a crest like this looking

1569
01:15:19,731 --> 01:15:20,010
at.

1570
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:22,380
And it's also,
it's,

1571
01:15:22,410 --> 01:15:24,570
they were thinking that it was some sort
of a hybrid.

1572
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:29,550
They were thinking like maybe it was a,
maybe it was parked gorilla part champ.

1573
01:15:29,551 --> 01:15:31,410
Is that possible?
But then the,

1574
01:15:31,411 --> 01:15:32,244
the genetics we have gotten,
I think from stool samples and some 

1575
01:15:36,391 --> 01:15:38,910
other,
some other methods of acquiring them.

1576
01:15:39,450 --> 01:15:40,110
They,
uh,

1577
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:40,943
they think that it's just,
it's own kind of chimp just to breed 

1578
01:15:45,071 --> 01:15:48,990
that only exist in this one area.
Pretty fucking crazy.

1579
01:15:50,310 --> 01:15:54,380
You think about it like they've only had
photos of this thing since the,

1580
01:15:54,450 --> 01:15:57,450
this Guy Carl Amman in the,
uh,

1581
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,400
I think the nineties he did that,
right?

1582
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,433
What does it say?
Four is when he first got the photos on 

1583
01:16:04,691 --> 01:16:05,524
it.
I guess it's apparently have been like 

1584
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:10,120
legend,
but the Congo is giant man.

1585
01:16:10,121 --> 01:16:12,550
It's like the United States.
It's huge.

1586
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,770
Like the Congo,
rain forest,

1587
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:17,270
if you look at it on a map in,
um,

1588
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,750
you know,
like they'll take like a,

1589
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,613
uh,
the actual size of the u s and put it 

1590
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:23,220
like in the Congo and he goes,
oh,

1591
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,410
well in the Congo you almost can.
It's pretty close.

1592
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:27,723
It's pretty close.
It's basically the size of the United 

1593
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:30,630
States give or take,
right.

1594
01:16:30,830 --> 01:16:32,230
I mean,
even if it was half the size,

1595
01:16:32,231 --> 01:16:34,470
it's fucking crazy.
Who the hell knows what's in there?

1596
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:35,571
Yeah,
exactly.

1597
01:16:35,571 --> 01:16:37,620
Like can never find everything that's 
there.

1598
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:41,520
But this one area where this thing lives
is a,

1599
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:42,573
of course they're probably like making 
cell phones out of there or something 

1600
01:16:45,731 --> 01:16:49,510
like that and pulling minerals out of 
the ground that they need for,

1601
01:16:49,511 --> 01:16:50,344
uh,
you know,

1602
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,470
the Iwatch or something.
So who knows,

1603
01:16:53,471 --> 01:16:58,471
I mean this is how big it is.
Two thirds the size of western Europe,

1604
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:03,280
two thirds the size of western Europe.
Jesus Christ.

1605
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:06,490
What does it look like in comparison to 
the United States?

1606
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:10,040
Had a picture

1607
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,160
of it and covered about half of you,
but I think it was the demand,

1608
01:17:13,370 --> 01:17:14,203
the Dr of the Congo.
So I'm not sure if it's a different 

1609
01:17:18,561 --> 01:17:21,050
side.
That's a fucking pretty heavy duty piece

1610
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:22,520
right there.
Oh my God.

1611
01:17:23,050 --> 01:17:24,350
You know,
Midwest.

1612
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,690
I definitely exaggerated,
but it's still unbelievably huge.

1613
01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:32,353
Just look at it goes from the bottom of 
the United States all the way up to 

1614
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:36,260
Canada.
Um,

1615
01:17:36,530 --> 01:17:40,880
but only I would say like,
like a third of the size.

1616
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:43,550
Slightly bigger than Alaska maybe.
Definitely.

1617
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,470
The last one is pretty big too.
How about how much is it?

1618
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,433
It's not really half.
Doesn't really have to me it looks more 

1619
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:49,904
like a third.
Like scroll down a little so we could 

1620
01:17:52,821 --> 01:17:54,740
see it better.
Yeah.

1621
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,200
Yeah.
That doesn't really live like half to me

1622
01:17:57,710 --> 01:18:00,470
does.
It looks like slightly.

1623
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:03,770
Yeah,
slightly less than half.

1624
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:05,660
Maybe 40 percent or something like that.

1625
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:07,393
And almost 80 percent of people have 
aids really sort of says 80 percent of 

1626
01:18:13,551 --> 01:18:18,551
the people in the Congo have aids more 
likely are likely to have HIV aids.

1627
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:20,180
Wow.
Heavy duty.

1628
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,060
If you go into the Condo,
the Congo where a condom,

1629
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,033
right?
Well we knew that you got to wear the 

1630
01:18:27,291 --> 01:18:29,630
full body condom,
like fucking naked gun.

1631
01:18:30,340 --> 01:18:31,173
It's just insane.
How to help diverse that part of the 

1632
01:18:35,331 --> 01:18:36,164
world is like the amount of different 
animals that exist in that one crazy 

1633
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:40,814
rain forest area.
They have all sorts of wild shit and 

1634
01:18:44,421 --> 01:18:46,490
there we were looking at videos that 
thing last night.

1635
01:18:46,491 --> 01:18:47,324
That shoe Bill Byrd,
that giant prehistoric looking dinosaur 

1636
01:18:50,901 --> 01:18:54,410
bird that lives in the Congo to the one 
with the long.

1637
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:56,660
Yeah.
Crazy long hatchet face.

1638
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:59,240
It's got like a.
like a long battle ax for face.

1639
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:03,470
It's like a five foot tall bird or scary
fucking things.

1640
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:05,870
Michigan chased down by one of those.
Yeah,

1641
01:19:05,871 --> 01:19:08,030
there it is.
Just two days in a row.

1642
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:12,320
The shoe bill is made a look at that 
fucking size of that thing.

1643
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:15,100
Oh,
that thing looks crazy.

1644
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:15,983
It just looks like he's demented.
One doesn't look nearly as tall as five 

1645
01:19:19,131 --> 01:19:21,050
feet.
It's five feet as big as they get.

1646
01:19:21,051 --> 01:19:26,051
Look at the fucking eyes in that thing.
Mesh is given him a rat like that.

1647
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,070
Stupid.
It is to idiot.

1648
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:31,820
It's so dumb.
Just a dumb old dinosaur.

1649
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:34,130
That's a dinosaur man.

1650
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,360
I mean for real.
What are we looking at?

1651
01:19:39,361 --> 01:19:42,060
Is this a real animal?
Are you fucking shitting me?

1652
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:46,200
This looks like Avatar.
This looks to be some Avatar Shit.

1653
01:19:46,230 --> 01:19:49,380
It really does.
The fact that that is a real animal.

1654
01:19:49,590 --> 01:19:53,490
This lady is feeding this animal rats 
it.

1655
01:19:53,570 --> 01:19:56,340
It's gulping down mice and fish and 
shit.

1656
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:58,590
Look at this.
The face on that thing.

1657
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:01,213
Look at Nice.
It's like fucking hatchet face from 

1658
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:05,000
crybaby.
It's fucking.

1659
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:09,150
It's like,
I don't believe that.

1660
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:13,950
You really can tell how intelligent 
someone is if you look into their eyes,

1661
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:17,550
but I do believe you can see when 
something's dumb as fuck.

1662
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,243
You know,
like you can't tell looking at somebody 

1663
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,870
how smart they are,
but you can definitely tell.

1664
01:20:24,871 --> 01:20:27,360
Looking at that thing,
there's not a whole lot going on.

1665
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:32,690
There's like some simple wiring,
fuck that thing,

1666
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,570
but Jesus Christ,
that's crazy.

1667
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:37,053
Oh,
Jamie just pulled up a photo of this 

1668
01:20:40,581 --> 01:20:43,280
bird has a pretty fucking amazing 
looking dude.

1669
01:20:43,281 --> 01:20:45,710
Someone needs to make a horror movie 
where these things just,

1670
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,913
you know,
someone that lets him out of a lab in 

1671
01:20:47,931 --> 01:20:52,040
Florida,
Florida University lab and they get out,

1672
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,890
they start breeding and they start 
talking to each other.

1673
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:59,030
That looks like one of those angry birds
from the things from the game,

1674
01:20:59,031 --> 01:21:01,280
right?
They use one of those.

1675
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,440
The eyes,
shit,

1676
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:06,440
those dead eyes,
those dead dinosaur eyes.

1677
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,680
Those eyes are the reason why.
That's fucking creepy.

1678
01:21:11,130 --> 01:21:13,510
Oh,
who the fuck out those eyes are?

1679
01:21:13,511 --> 01:21:16,970
The reason why we have houses and 
weapons was houses.

1680
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,720
The reason why we figured out fire and 
communication,

1681
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:22,780
it's we had to figure out how to knock 
it eaten,

1682
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:25,600
eaten by shit like that.
Look at that thing.

1683
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,463
Jesus fucking Christ.
Now imagine that this is in the same 

1684
01:21:30,281 --> 01:21:33,820
sort of vein as far as animals go,
is that Tara Byrd,

1685
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:34,953
except it's considerably smaller where 
that Tara Byrd was like seven feet tall 

1686
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,520
and lived in North America,
lived in North America while people were

1687
01:21:42,521 --> 01:21:46,270
alive.
These things were gi,

1688
01:21:46,271 --> 01:21:48,600
ent,
and they were running around like,

1689
01:21:48,601 --> 01:21:51,750
look at the photo of the soldier there.
Jamie.

1690
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:55,140
Look at this.
Look how big these fucking things were.

1691
01:21:55,320 --> 01:21:56,580
What?
Yeah,

1692
01:21:56,581 --> 01:21:59,820
what the fuck these things lived while 
people were alive,

1693
01:21:59,821 --> 01:22:00,710
right?
Gwen?

1694
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:05,720
Did these terror birds exist?
Fuck that thing.

1695
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:12,500
Just fuck that shit is crazy.
Look,

1696
01:22:13,790 --> 01:22:16,680
nine feet tall,
so nine foot tall,

1697
01:22:16,681 --> 01:22:20,430
giant fucking bird man.
And when did the thing live?

1698
01:22:24,020 --> 01:22:26,420
One point 5 million years ago.
Is that what it says?

1699
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:29,030
That's not that long.
Does it say what's this say Jamie?

1700
01:22:29,280 --> 01:22:30,290
Fifteen or one point five.

1701
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:34,990
Two point 5 million years.
Two point 5 million years ago.

1702
01:22:34,991 --> 01:22:35,591
All right,
well,

1703
01:22:35,591 --> 01:22:38,380
so that's definitely not people.
Someone was there.

1704
01:22:38,440 --> 01:22:40,570
Someone was there,
some silly monkeys.

1705
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,180
Something was there,
but what?

1706
01:22:43,330 --> 01:22:44,163
What year do you think monkey started 
figuring out how to start using weapons 

1707
01:22:48,671 --> 01:22:49,504
and shit.
Like what year was it that they figured 

1708
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:52,204
out how?
Like the very first sub human hominid 

1709
01:22:56,441 --> 01:23:00,070
that was smart as fuck.
That was figuring out how to like make a

1710
01:23:00,071 --> 01:23:00,904
weapon.
I would have to have been picking up 

1711
01:23:03,341 --> 01:23:06,310
some sort of branch or some sort of rock
and throwing

1712
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,143
it.
Maybe that's the first thought of using 

1713
01:23:08,801 --> 01:23:10,630
a weapon.
No rock.

1714
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:11,793
Maybe I would wonder if it would be that
or a stick to beat something with a 

1715
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:19,960
stick or to throw a rock like which 
would be the first one they figured out.

1716
01:23:20,860 --> 01:23:22,480
But what do you.
What year do you think?

1717
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:23,383
I mean,
I wonder how long it was ago that our 

1718
01:23:25,601 --> 01:23:28,570
ancestors first started developing a 
weapon,

1719
01:23:29,530 --> 01:23:33,400
like something to you to kill something 
to eat or something defend themselves.

1720
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,273
I'm looking a little farther.
There's some reports and from Uruguay 

1721
01:23:36,891 --> 01:23:41,891
saying that these might be dated to 
450,000 or 17,000 years ago.

1722
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:45,740
Seventeen thousand years ago.
Still being debated.

1723
01:23:45,890 --> 01:23:49,340
That's what I entered the realm.
That's what I had heard it was.

1724
01:23:49,341 --> 01:23:50,174
Um,
uh,

1725
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:54,620
I think I had heard it was like 35,000 
years ago.

1726
01:23:54,621 --> 01:23:57,200
They think that some of them were living
in North America.

1727
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:01,740
Well,
it's written in Spanish or something.

1728
01:24:02,250 --> 01:24:03,940
I can't get through that.
So

1729
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:05,313
it was all pre ice age either way 
because the ice age was 10,000 years 

1730
01:24:08,921 --> 01:24:09,754
ago.
This whole motherfucker was just frozen 

1731
01:24:11,591 --> 01:24:13,690
solid.
That's hard.

1732
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:16,930
That's hard to imagine.
Listen,

1733
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:19,390
I've,
I questioned everything.

1734
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:23,110
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
Who knows what's happening,

1735
01:24:23,740 --> 01:24:28,720
but I like watching ancient aliens.
I do too.

1736
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:31,810
I wish it was real.
I wish it was all real.

1737
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,733
I wish it was to the right.
I hope they're right about a lot of 

1738
01:24:34,841 --> 01:24:35,674
shit.
I would be so much more fun if aliens 

1739
01:24:38,891 --> 01:24:42,730
had been here and contradict,
contacted us and left information.

1740
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:43,623
It would be so much more fun to be 
incredible then to actually be alive to 

1741
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:50,770
find that out.
I think it's.

1742
01:24:50,980 --> 01:24:51,813
It's totally possible that something 
could get waste smarter than us and can 

1743
01:24:55,481 --> 01:24:56,314
travel from some other place is also 
totally possible that it's never 

1744
01:24:59,711 --> 01:25:00,544
happened yet.

1745
01:25:01,240 --> 01:25:04,240
It's totally possible that people were 
just full of shit.

1746
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:09,040
It's also totally possible that our 
experience on earth has been broken up a

1747
01:25:09,041 --> 01:25:09,874
bunch of times by huge disasters and I 
think that this is one of the things 

1748
01:25:14,021 --> 01:25:18,520
that this Guy Graham Hancock is trying 
to prove and is doing a fantastic job.

1749
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:19,393
Sort of documenting what the way he 
describes it that were a civilization 

1750
01:25:22,601 --> 01:25:25,660
with amnesia.
It's really interesting stuff,

1751
01:25:25,661 --> 01:25:26,494
man,
because he's.

1752
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:27,633
He's saying essentially what probably 
happened was human beings invented a 

1753
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:35,110
bunch of really cool shit,
developed a bunch of great technology,

1754
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:37,840
had made sophisticated societies and 
cultures,

1755
01:25:37,841 --> 01:25:41,920
and then boom,
a fucking rock from this guy comes down,

1756
01:25:41,950 --> 01:25:43,690
start over,
flattens everything,

1757
01:25:43,691 --> 01:25:47,920
kills a giant chunk of the people,
fucks up all the infrastructure,

1758
01:25:47,921 --> 01:25:51,700
chaos disorder,
and then things are fine for another few

1759
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:52,533
hundred years and boom,
a new one hits and they're all 

1760
01:25:54,851 --> 01:25:55,684
throughout Europe.
They've proven it now that this is 

1761
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:01,710
nuclear glass shit all throughout Europe
and in Asia as well.

1762
01:26:01,720 --> 01:26:04,910
Gentrification and it's all around 
10,000 years ago.

1763
01:26:05,150 --> 01:26:06,740
Crazy is that.
It's unexplainable.

1764
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:08,413
It's insane.
They think that that's what happened 

1765
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:13,160
that to 10 to 12,000 years ago they 
this,

1766
01:26:13,190 --> 01:26:15,560
all of Europe was like pelted with 
rocks.

1767
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,133
It's fucking nuts and that people had to
start over after that and that all of 

1768
01:26:22,491 --> 01:26:27,491
our stories about cataclysms and the 
dough in the arc and all that shit about

1769
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,410
keeping,
keeping societies alive,

1770
01:26:30,411 --> 01:26:31,244
whether it's like the epic of Gilgamesh,
all these different stories that are 

1771
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:36,290
real similar,
real similar tale of someone like trying

1772
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:40,550
to keep humanity alive.
Face of this chaotic disaster.

1773
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:41,443
All of those represent the same stories.
All those represents the things that 

1774
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:48,650
ended the fucking ice age rocks from 
this guy 10,000 years ago.

1775
01:26:48,651 --> 01:26:49,484
Jamie.

1776
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:52,580
Heavy Shit.
Too heavy for me.

1777
01:26:52,581 --> 01:26:56,960
You got me too high.
This fucking three joy's left.

1778
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:57,980
Well,
that actually is for.

1779
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:02,210
Oh we can't,
we can't keep going.

1780
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,510
We'll forget what we already talked 
about when we repeat ourselves.

1781
01:27:05,660 --> 01:27:08,240
We are a society with Amnesia.
Oh,

1782
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:09,620
definitely wouldn't smoke in this kind 
of.

1783
01:27:09,621 --> 01:27:14,450
We'd get all kinds of amnesia.
He says fire to know that about them.

1784
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:17,060
So when you go in on these,
um,

1785
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:17,983
these trips,
do you base these trips on like places 

1786
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:23,630
you want to eat and he bases trips on 
your already tour in there and you say,

1787
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:25,820
well fuck it.
Let's combine the two together.

1788
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,120
Yup.
Pretty much.

1789
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:27,983
You know,
like I get to go to cool places for 

1790
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,543
music.
I get to go to a lot of amazing 

1791
01:27:34,461 --> 01:27:36,020
countries.
I've been to Africa,

1792
01:27:36,021 --> 01:27:38,840
I've been pretty much on love and not 
yet,

1793
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:40,700
not Asia yet,
all over Europe,

1794
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:42,403
all over America.
And pretty much people want to take me 

1795
01:27:47,571 --> 01:27:49,970
out to these restaurants because they 
know I appreciate it.

1796
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:51,523
They know what I'm about.
They threw my lyrics and through seeing 

1797
01:27:54,741 --> 01:27:55,574
me and getting to know me on,
on that type of level where you almost 

1798
01:27:59,811 --> 01:28:00,950
feel like,
you know me,

1799
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:03,383
people feel like they,
they need to show me the right way in 

1800
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:08,970
their city.
I have to be taken care of,

1801
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:11,280
you know,
and it's only right.

1802
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:12,473
I like to be taken care of and you know,
I have an incredible team over advice 

1803
01:28:16,620 --> 01:28:19,920
and munchies and Viceland that uh,
you know,

1804
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:23,270
they get the job done.
They work well.

1805
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,740
Once you start doing the Charlotte this,
then people start hearing about it.

1806
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:26,603
Then you know,
you get all the people that are 

1807
01:28:27,751 --> 01:28:31,830
contacting you with great suggestions 
and it sort of makes itself like you,

1808
01:28:31,831 --> 01:28:34,050
you'll,
you'll figure it chart just based on all

1809
01:28:34,051 --> 01:28:36,120
these people trying to get you grow 
their spots.

1810
01:28:36,121 --> 01:28:36,420
Right?
Yeah.

1811
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:37,253
Well,
you know,

1812
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:40,410
a lot of is organic though.
People are genuinely fans with the music

1813
01:28:40,411 --> 01:28:41,910
and genuinely fans of the show.

1814
01:28:44,940 --> 01:28:47,160
A lot of the times they don't want to 
ask to be on it.

1815
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:48,630
You know,
I,

1816
01:28:48,950 --> 01:28:50,670
I,
I feel I see people,

1817
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:54,870
you know,
throwing the little hints like come come

1818
01:28:54,871 --> 01:28:55,704
by,
you know,

1819
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:56,963
bring the guys.
Is this something you planned out or is 

1820
01:28:58,531 --> 01:29:00,450
it just like something that Sorta came 
along?

1821
01:29:00,451 --> 01:29:02,100
It just seemed like a natural thing to 
do.

1822
01:29:02,140 --> 01:29:03,300
Yeah,
it just came along.

1823
01:29:03,301 --> 01:29:03,781
You know,
I was,

1824
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:04,614
I was filming,
I was getting filmed in the kitchen 

1825
01:29:06,391 --> 01:29:08,280
cooking and it was like,
it was kind of cool.

1826
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:10,580
I always,
you know,

1827
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:11,543
growing up watching these shows being 
fucking ever these dudes being rock 

1828
01:29:15,661 --> 01:29:17,250
stars now.
I was like,

1829
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:21,620
why can't I do that?
Look at fucking guy for Yeti theory.

1830
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:22,463
Yet I go with my bath guy theory.
I'm setting with the and fietti is that 

1831
01:29:27,601 --> 01:29:29,590
I suppose to say so,
right?

1832
01:29:29,930 --> 01:29:31,800
It's this little accent.

1833
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:33,840
Look at him.
Look at him.

1834
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:35,160
Look at him.
Look at him.

1835
01:29:35,780 --> 01:29:36,613
Look at him.
Look at him.

1836
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,070
Look at this guy.
What?

1837
01:29:39,330 --> 01:29:41,190
What else is he going to do besides 
nick?

1838
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,430
What he does?
He can be in nickelback.

1839
01:29:43,470 --> 01:29:46,380
He could be a nickelback.
He could be in a.

1840
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,230
What was the one?
I'm an all star.

1841
01:29:48,450 --> 01:29:49,283
He smashed me.
He looks like the lead singer of 

1842
01:29:53,791 --> 01:29:54,950
smashmouth.
No.

1843
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:55,591
Yeah,
yeah,

1844
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:56,424
yeah,
yeah,

1845
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,100
yeah.
Um.

1846
01:29:58,300 --> 01:29:59,850
Oh,
he's got it figured out.

1847
01:29:59,851 --> 01:30:02,580
His own spot.
Can you just scroll up for a second?

1848
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:08,390
Go to the one with the flames on his 
shirt to the right.

1849
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,580
Yes.
He actually,

1850
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:15,863
they were like,
get crazy while he was taking these 

1851
01:30:17,821 --> 01:30:20,850
pictures and he did that and that's 
forever.

1852
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:26,360
It's just hilarious in time that he's 
got such a crafted thing going on.

1853
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:31,290
He's a Rockstar Rockstar Cook.
God,

1854
01:30:31,560 --> 01:30:32,393
let me ask you something.
Do you think tega night sky that ain't 

1855
01:30:34,691 --> 01:30:35,220
no,
I.

1856
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,130
that's what I'm saying.
Do you think that this is a shtick?

1857
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:41,490
Like he's smart.
He decided to like make himself look.

1858
01:30:41,940 --> 01:30:42,773
You look at a guy like Donald Trump.
Everybody knows that he has this crazy 

1859
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,274
hair.
You don't think that Donald trump could 

1860
01:30:48,391 --> 01:30:49,440
get a better haircut?
Oh yeah.

1861
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:51,760
He plays into it for sure.
He's ridiculous.

1862
01:30:51,790 --> 01:30:52,623
It's part of his flair as that.
He's pulling it off with this goofy 

1863
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:56,113
haircut.
He's got billions of dollars and he's 

1864
01:30:58,020 --> 01:31:01,800
got this hair helmet.
Same with Don King.

1865
01:31:01,830 --> 01:31:04,630
So legendary here.
Don King Man.

1866
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:06,690
A lot of guys did that.
They looked.

1867
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:09,720
They had like sort of a wacky look on 
purpose.

1868
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,270
Right?
I thought of this yesterday.

1869
01:31:12,271 --> 01:31:13,104
Is there a chance donald trump's 
trolling and some sort of performance 

1870
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:18,190
piece for like A.
I think it's definitely.

1871
01:31:19,170 --> 01:31:20,003
I think Donald trump is a guy who has 
full belief in his ability to run this 

1872
01:31:25,591 --> 01:31:26,424
country.
Whether or not he can actually run the 

1873
01:31:28,981 --> 01:31:30,990
country.
I don't think it's an enact.

1874
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,540
I think he has full belief that he can 
do it.

1875
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:37,980
It's.
It is bizarre city because it's a.

1876
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:38,933
it's freaking people out,
but I think one of the more fascinating 

1877
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:44,430
things about this election is how people
are so freaked out that he's.

1878
01:31:44,670 --> 01:31:48,300
He's pretty much in command right now.
This thoughts,

1879
01:31:48,460 --> 01:31:52,530
there's like panic that he could.
That is a possibility.

1880
01:31:52,531 --> 01:31:53,760
It could be the president.
Oh,

1881
01:31:53,761 --> 01:31:57,150
it's very likely if you think that 
there's very likely.

1882
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:58,013
I think if,
if things keep going the way they're 

1883
01:31:59,981 --> 01:32:04,150
going right now,
it looks to me like he's going to be the

1884
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:07,240
president or the others putting their 
fucking foot in their mouth.

1885
01:32:07,270 --> 01:32:09,670
What is the issue?
Why is he shining?

1886
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:12,310
I don't understand.
Is it the Internet age?

1887
01:32:12,311 --> 01:32:17,230
Is that the social media age that's 
making this guy into this figure?

1888
01:32:17,260 --> 01:32:21,460
Almost like the Jordan face,
the Jordan,

1889
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:24,310
the meme.
It's like an iconic thing.

1890
01:32:24,311 --> 01:32:25,910
Do you know about to pull up the Jordan?

1891
01:32:27,940 --> 01:32:30,520
Donald trump is becoming the fucking 
Jordan face man.

1892
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:32,200
The crying Jordan.
Well,

1893
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:33,213
here's the thing.
When people looked for someone to be 

1894
01:32:34,871 --> 01:32:36,880
president,
whether it's rational or not,

1895
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:37,953
they look towards someone who they think
is going to be a leader of the crying 

1896
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:43,470
Jordan face.
Yeah.

1897
01:32:43,471 --> 01:32:44,610
That's like the,
Oh,

1898
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:48,250
they put it on everybody's,
if you fuck up,

1899
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:49,084
you get to crying Jordan face people 
look towards someone that they want to 

1900
01:32:52,421 --> 01:32:53,254
be a leader.
And the problem with Donald trump is 

1901
01:32:56,861 --> 01:33:01,861
that he said a bunch of ridiculous stuff
about like Mexicans and in some,

1902
01:33:02,410 --> 01:33:07,410
some stuff that like not measured stuff 
about Muslims coming into this country,

1903
01:33:07,870 --> 01:33:11,350
not measured and rational and,
and you know,

1904
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:16,560
it was way too showbizzy,
you know what I mean?

1905
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:20,740
He's the guy with the Mexicans.
They will shut the country down.

1906
01:33:21,400 --> 01:33:23,560
Restaurants will be closed.
It'll be over.

1907
01:33:24,050 --> 01:33:24,820
Yeah.

1908
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:27,520
Things will be done.
Yeah,

1909
01:33:27,850 --> 01:33:30,220
very likely.
Plus they're nice.

1910
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:31,623
They're great people.
We're not having a lot of problems with 

1911
01:33:33,761 --> 01:33:37,180
Mexicans.
Like this idea that Mexicans are causing

1912
01:33:37,181 --> 01:33:38,014
all these problems.
If they were really causing them any 

1913
01:33:39,011 --> 01:33:39,844
problems,
we would have a lot more problems 

1914
01:33:41,530 --> 01:33:43,960
because there's a lot of Mexicans all 
they ever do,

1915
01:33:43,961 --> 01:33:44,794
they just want to come over to the 
country so they can make money to send 

1916
01:33:47,291 --> 01:33:48,124
home to their family.
I worked with guys that literally slept 

1917
01:33:51,071 --> 01:33:53,860
and Shit,
hold rooms just so they could send their

1918
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:58,040
salary that $300,
$400 from washing dishes or fucking week

1919
01:33:58,810 --> 01:33:59,643
back home for their family,
their lives of the people that you want 

1920
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:04,570
to keep out of the country.
Like the,

1921
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:06,130
the,
the honest,

1922
01:34:06,131 --> 01:34:06,964
the working men riding his bike back and
forth to work every day in the fucking 

1923
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:12,970
snow,
rain,

1924
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,073
whatever.
You know.

1925
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:15,363
It's upsetting.

1926
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:17,170
I worked close with these guys.
You know what I mean?

1927
01:34:17,290 --> 01:34:18,520
Yeah.
Well you kitchens right,

1928
01:34:18,521 --> 01:34:19,380
and kitchens.
Yes.

1929
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:20,793
Mexican guys want to pee and chefs and 
incredible ones too and know that you 

1930
01:34:25,001 --> 01:34:29,330
could teach them any cuisine.
It's just um,

1931
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:30,723
it's just unfortunate that he would say 
things like that and that people will 

1932
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:37,600
respond the way they responded.
You know,

1933
01:34:37,601 --> 01:34:40,870
people got kind of excited that someone 
is filing a close the wall,

1934
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:42,003
you know,
close the borders and just fucking snow 

1935
01:34:44,181 --> 01:34:47,350
people out there.
They all come out when you know,

1936
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:48,980
the freaks come out at night.
Well,

1937
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:49,814
it's just this bad people in every group
and every group and the idea that these 

1938
01:34:56,261 --> 01:34:58,040
people,
because there

1939
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:02,510
are more poor and because they're,
they got stuck in this one spot,

1940
01:35:02,540 --> 01:35:03,373
they should be,
they should be trapped there forever 

1941
01:35:05,270 --> 01:35:07,670
even though it's connected to us by 
dirt.

1942
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:12,590
I mean there's like a clear path between
us and Mexico right there and we have to

1943
01:35:12,591 --> 01:35:15,710
stop people from walking across to get 
jobs.

1944
01:35:15,950 --> 01:35:16,783
Like imagine if Americans,
if you made them walk across the desert 

1945
01:35:20,091 --> 01:35:21,440
to get jobs.
Yeah,

1946
01:35:21,441 --> 01:35:22,274
right.
How few of us would be employed if you 

1947
01:35:25,371 --> 01:35:27,980
had a walk across the yard to get in the
river.

1948
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:31,000
He had a fucking way to cross the river.
It'd get to the other side,

1949
01:35:31,010 --> 01:35:34,720
holding your baby over the rapids and 
then once you get to the side you got to

1950
01:35:34,721 --> 01:35:35,554
climb a wall and then you've got to walk
across the desert and then you gotta 

1951
01:35:38,360 --> 01:35:40,010
find a job.
What?

1952
01:35:40,040 --> 01:35:41,540
You don't have a job for me when I get 
there.

1953
01:35:41,550 --> 01:35:42,260
No,
no,

1954
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:44,490
no.
You better know somebody too because you

1955
01:35:44,491 --> 01:35:46,520
know you can't speak their language.
What?

1956
01:35:47,070 --> 01:35:49,070
Yeah,
I'm going to live somewhere where they.

1957
01:35:49,140 --> 01:35:51,110
They don't speak my language.
Do you want money or not?

1958
01:35:51,710 --> 01:35:52,543
Okay,
I'll do it.

1959
01:35:52,610 --> 01:35:54,560
No one's going to do it.
No American do it.

1960
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:57,620
You know he's fucking kids coming out of
college today.

1961
01:35:57,980 --> 01:36:00,830
There's no jobs.
There's younger generations.

1962
01:36:00,831 --> 01:36:03,470
Fucked the wall.
Just got 10 feet higher.

1963
01:36:03,590 --> 01:36:07,490
Is this is new statement a couple of 
days ago after he wants something.

1964
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,130
Oh my God.
He's hilarious.

1965
01:36:10,580 --> 01:36:11,480
It's hilarious.

1966
01:36:15,910 --> 01:36:19,830
The president of Mexico yesterday,
or the experts prize,

1967
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:21,550
whatever,
whoever,

1968
01:36:21,551 --> 01:36:23,710
who cares?
He said,

1969
01:36:24,100 --> 01:36:27,100
we will not even consider paying for the
wall.

1970
01:36:27,101 --> 01:36:29,350
You have to understand because.
Okay,

1971
01:36:29,351 --> 01:36:31,870
you ready?
Who's going to pay for the wall?

1972
01:36:33,890 --> 01:36:34,723
Who?

1973
01:36:36,310 --> 01:36:41,310
Oh my God,
a hundred percent.

1974
01:36:42,250 --> 01:36:46,300
So I get a call from one of the 
reporters yesterday and they said,

1975
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:47,523
the president of Mexico said they will 
not under any circumstances pay for the 

1976
01:36:52,091 --> 01:36:53,680
wall.
They said to me,

1977
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:55,630
what is your comment?
I said,

1978
01:36:55,690 --> 01:36:58,090
the wall just got 10 feet higher.

1979
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:00,400
True,
true.

1980
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:04,560
He fucked it up with the.
It's true.

1981
01:37:04,561 --> 01:37:06,300
It's true.
He should have laid back on that.

1982
01:37:06,660 --> 01:37:08,160
Had a strong delivery.
It.

1983
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:09,513
He had a strong delivery.
Just panics while I was getting the 

1984
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:13,140
chairs.
He got hired.

1985
01:37:13,141 --> 01:37:17,310
That's how you can tell he's a fucking.
He's not presented prime for the spot.

1986
01:37:17,820 --> 01:37:19,620
What the fuck?
That's your hype right there.

1987
01:37:19,621 --> 01:37:20,454
When he heard the collapse.
That is crazy that a guy can say 

1988
01:37:22,651 --> 01:37:24,870
something like that.
Like that is so not measured.

1989
01:37:24,940 --> 01:37:25,990
Did you see that?
Uh,

1990
01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:28,310
please clap moment with Jeb Bush.
No.

1991
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,500
And it pretty much ruined him and he's 
now out of the race.

1992
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,280
Know what happened.
I'll show it to you.

1993
01:37:33,281 --> 01:37:35,080
He,
he's given a speech somewhere and,

1994
01:37:35,081 --> 01:37:35,914
and uh,
he gets this real riled up moment and 

1995
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:39,700
he's waiting for an applause break and 
it doesn't come.

1996
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:42,100
So he literally says to the crowd,
please clap.

1997
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,610
Oh my God.
Oh,

1998
01:37:44,611 --> 01:37:49,611
the poor bastard gracious.
Oh fuck.

1999
01:37:50,401 --> 01:37:51,960
He's probably so happy to be out of it.

2000
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:55,800
Have the back the military.

2001
01:37:56,130 --> 01:37:56,963
I won't trash talk.
I won't be a divider in chief or an 

2002
01:37:59,971 --> 01:38:02,340
agitator in chief.
I won't be out there.

2003
01:38:02,350 --> 01:38:05,970
Blow harden talking to big,
big game without backing it up.

2004
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,310
I think the next president needs to be a
lot quieter,

2005
01:38:08,430 --> 01:38:09,263
but send a signal that we're prepared to
act in the national security interests 

2006
01:38:12,421 --> 01:38:13,254
of this country to get back in the 
business of creating a more peaceful 

2007
01:38:15,901 --> 01:38:18,270
world.
Please clap.

2008
01:38:20,570 --> 01:38:22,080
Oh,
I thought that was humorous.

2009
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:26,450
I actually thought that was humorous.
It wasn't terrible.

2010
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:29,360
I thought that was humorous when the way
he did that,

2011
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:32,420
I thought he was like.
It was awkward.

2012
01:38:32,780 --> 01:38:36,800
I saw an older guy in a Yamaka,
so a bunch of really old people there.

2013
01:38:37,220 --> 01:38:39,050
Maybe they just didn't catch it at the 
time.

2014
01:38:39,350 --> 01:38:41,150
I thought he was being funny.
I mean,

2015
01:38:41,151 --> 01:38:42,790
I would think that that would be a good 
way to end it.

2016
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,270
You say please clap.
No,

2017
01:38:45,380 --> 01:38:49,040
but maybe I'm just optimistic.
He's definitely not the guy.

2018
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:52,220
You just.
You can't talk like that and be the guy.

2019
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:54,080
You know what focus is.
Fuck.

2020
01:38:54,350 --> 01:38:56,780
That seemed like.
I think he probably saw what happened to

2021
01:38:56,781 --> 01:38:57,614
his brother,
saw what happened to his dad and he was 

2022
01:38:59,031 --> 01:38:59,511
like,
fuck,

2023
01:38:59,511 --> 01:39:01,310
this will be different.
And they're trying to put.

2024
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:02,690
No,
I think they're trying to push them into

2025
01:39:02,691 --> 01:39:03,800
a job.
It doesn't really want.

2026
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,720
I don't think he really wanted to be 
president.

2027
01:39:06,670 --> 01:39:07,503
Just didn't seem like it to me.
Just to be a carpenter like Bernie 

2028
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,820
Sanders seems to want to be president.
I believe it.

2029
01:39:14,270 --> 01:39:16,340
I'm convinced Hillary Clinton wants to 
be president.

2030
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:19,340
I'm convinced trump wants to be 
president for sure.

2031
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,590
How about that Rubio guy?
Because he want to be president.

2032
01:39:23,900 --> 01:39:25,460
Chris Christie didn't want to be 
president.

2033
01:39:25,461 --> 01:39:26,940
No Way.
No fucking way.

2034
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:29,090
Just fucking scumbag.
Is He?

2035
01:39:29,120 --> 01:39:29,953
How dare you,

2036
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:32,910
Izzy?
I'm not really sure.

2037
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:37,800
This is what I hear.
I don't really know politics.

2038
01:39:37,801 --> 01:39:39,450
This is what I hear.
Yeah,

2039
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:43,440
that's all I need to know this.
The judge judges spoken.

2040
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:46,860
Yeah.
I just don't know.

2041
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:48,600
I don't know what's going to happen in 
this country.

2042
01:39:48,601 --> 01:39:51,150
If that guy wins,
that's going to be very weird.

2043
01:39:51,630 --> 01:39:52,463
If that guy wins,
like someone who could say shit like 

2044
01:39:53,731 --> 01:39:55,500
that winds.
Wow.

2045
01:39:55,890 --> 01:39:56,723
Who knows,
man.

2046
01:39:57,030 --> 01:40:01,440
What would happen if he got into office 
and then immediately gave like a calm,

2047
01:40:01,441 --> 01:40:06,000
sober presentation and explained that he
did what he had to do to win,

2048
01:40:06,030 --> 01:40:08,370
but he's absolutely serious about being 
the president

2049
01:40:09,860 --> 01:40:10,550
whenever,
whenever,

2050
01:40:10,550 --> 01:40:13,100
if that's possible.
America is pretty liberal.

2051
01:40:13,101 --> 01:40:14,720
I feel like.
Give him a shot.

2052
01:40:15,290 --> 01:40:16,970
He hit the wall.
Just got 10 foot higher.

2053
01:40:16,971 --> 01:40:18,580
Like what?
What?

2054
01:40:18,590 --> 01:40:21,710
Is this?
An episode of a movie as of a movie.

2055
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:25,070
He's a sick fuck.
Yeah,

2056
01:40:25,490 --> 01:40:26,750
he is.
He's a sick fuck.

2057
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:32,140
He says anything you sick like 100 
percent.

2058
01:40:32,661 --> 01:40:34,670
He has one of the littlest dicks in the 
world.

2059
01:40:34,671 --> 01:40:35,504
There's no doubt about that.
I can't believe what I'm hearing and 

2060
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:41,210
tell how he's talking.
First of all,

2061
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:44,060
say allegedly.
Allegedly.

2062
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:47,960
He has one of the tiniest.
Piney is a micro penis.

2063
01:40:48,200 --> 01:40:50,420
I don't think that's the case.
I bet he's got a giant hog.

2064
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:51,560
Think so.
I bet.

2065
01:40:51,561 --> 01:40:53,060
It's shocking.
That's why he's so confident.

2066
01:40:53,500 --> 01:40:58,500
I bet he pulls it out and when he bought
the fucky showing me and he bought it,

2067
01:40:58,930 --> 01:41:03,400
there's no doubt realistic nude painting
of Donald Trump will make you gouge your

2068
01:41:03,401 --> 01:41:05,200
eyes out.
Okay.

2069
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:06,910
I don't know what you're putting up 
there.

2070
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:09,310
Jamie came up.
I thought that's where he got it.

2071
01:41:09,640 --> 01:41:10,820
I don't know.
I just.

2072
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:13,500
Just by his actions,
by the way,

2073
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:14,610
he,
you know,

2074
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:18,130
he's fine.
He definitely has micro penis syndrome.

2075
01:41:18,770 --> 01:41:21,100
I bet he's got a giant hug.
I.

2076
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:27,370
He's too cocky,
but that's the thing.

2077
01:41:27,371 --> 01:41:29,310
If he has one,
he fucking bought it.

2078
01:41:29,660 --> 01:41:32,510
It was one of those where you have to 
fucking pump you're nuts,

2079
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:33,720
you know,
to,

2080
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:34,550
to.
True,

2081
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:35,100
true,
true,

2082
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:35,591
true,
true.

2083
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:36,800
It's like a Turkey.
Basically.

2084
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:41,650
You keep at puppet up.
Can you all the Mexican actors?

2085
01:41:41,651 --> 01:41:44,860
Got It from the soap operas.
All of them.

2086
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:45,753
That's what I heard.
I was looking into this for when I get 

2087
01:41:48,911 --> 01:41:49,744
older.
That was the liberace had the 

2088
01:41:52,201 --> 01:41:54,460
mechanical,
mechanical pump,

2089
01:41:56,450 --> 01:41:59,350
like the Reebok pump.
It was in the movie.

2090
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,110
Did you ever see that movie?
The Hbo Movie?

2091
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:02,930
Who?
Wait?

2092
01:42:02,930 --> 01:42:05,320
Who was he was.
It was?

2093
01:42:05,350 --> 01:42:08,350
No,
it was Michael Douglas and Matt Damon.

2094
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:12,760
It was called something that candle 
opera beyond beyond the candle opera.

2095
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:16,270
Is that what it was?
It was fucking amazing.

2096
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:19,880
Really.
Liberace was freak.

2097
01:42:20,290 --> 01:42:22,540
It was amazing.
It's so good.

2098
01:42:22,541 --> 01:42:25,090
First of all,
Michael Douglas can act as ass off,

2099
01:42:25,091 --> 01:42:25,960
man.
He's a good.

2100
01:42:25,970 --> 01:42:28,410
He's falling down.
Yeah.

2101
01:42:28,470 --> 01:42:29,710
Oh yeah.
One of my favorites,

2102
01:42:29,980 --> 01:42:31,300
but this one,
for whatever reason,

2103
01:42:31,301 --> 01:42:34,640
I think they made it for hbo or maybe 
they just sold the dates,

2104
01:42:34,660 --> 01:42:35,500
pof.
They made it.

2105
01:42:35,501 --> 01:42:37,360
They might've finance it themselves.
I don't know what happened,

2106
01:42:37,361 --> 01:42:41,850
but it was incredible behind the 
Candelabra Oh wow.

2107
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:44,410
It's so good,
man.

2108
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,740
I looked incredible,
so fucking good.

2109
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:51,400
And Matt Damon was his boyfriend and 
it's just like,

2110
01:42:51,460 --> 01:42:54,640
Holy Shit,
I'm going to have to watch this for sure

2111
01:42:55,420 --> 01:42:57,370
dude.
He was a freak.

2112
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,073
It's fucking great.
He made his boyfriend get surgery to 

2113
01:43:03,731 --> 01:43:06,940
look more like him.
How about that?

2114
01:43:07,240 --> 01:43:08,073
Wow.
His boyfriend was this handsome guy and 

2115
01:43:09,851 --> 01:43:13,590
he made his boyfriend and fuck his chin 
up to be like more like liberace.

2116
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:15,790
Chin.
Got It man.

2117
01:43:15,791 --> 01:43:16,720
I'm good.
His Chin done.

2118
01:43:16,721 --> 01:43:18,580
Dude.
That's fucking sick.

2119
01:43:18,581 --> 01:43:21,330
That's love it more.
No,

2120
01:43:21,340 --> 01:43:22,173
no,
I'm good.

2121
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:27,470
Just keep coughing.
You're in a constant state of marijuana.

2122
01:43:29,860 --> 01:43:32,680
I enjoy it pretty much all day.
Yeah,

2123
01:43:32,681 --> 01:43:35,380
for sure.
Do you take days off?

2124
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:38,530
Yeah,
but how many a year?

2125
01:43:38,531 --> 01:43:39,970
Not many.
Five Year.

2126
01:43:40,370 --> 01:43:41,220
No,
no,

2127
01:43:41,400 --> 01:43:42,490
I,
I don't know,

2128
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,930
less than a year,
man.

2129
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:49,950
Maybe not really sure.
I think this,

2130
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:52,380
this year

2131
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:53,213
I took off,
I think maybe to two days because I had 

2132
01:43:55,101 --> 01:43:57,560
surgery,
but then I was right back at it.

2133
01:43:58,550 --> 01:44:01,340
I would think that would probably be 
good for reducing inflammation.

2134
01:44:01,400 --> 01:44:04,430
Causes coughing is no good when you was 
stomach,

2135
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:06,110
you know,
so the coughing is.

2136
01:44:06,170 --> 01:44:07,260
Oh,
this is when you had hernia.

2137
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:09,290
Yeah.
That,

2138
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:12,410
that's a,
that's a super common injury man.

2139
01:44:12,620 --> 01:44:15,430
This shit happened in Alaska to.
Oh yeah,

2140
01:44:15,431 --> 01:44:16,264
it was crazy.
I was in Alaska doing a performance and 

2141
01:44:18,111 --> 01:44:22,880
um,
I was playing NBA Jam against my boy and

2142
01:44:22,881 --> 01:44:26,960
he was the supersonics and he just 
fucking dunked on me and I got upset and

2143
01:44:26,961 --> 01:44:30,950
I felt something in my stomach and jam.
The video game.

2144
01:44:31,220 --> 01:44:34,160
Tournament edition hernia playing NBA 
Jam.

2145
01:44:34,161 --> 01:44:34,994
The video game.
How fucking crazy you want to talk 

2146
01:44:38,061 --> 01:44:39,050
about?
Ironic.

2147
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:44,420
That's the layer I was the knicks.
He was the sonics that I wasn't happy.

2148
01:44:45,130 --> 01:44:49,880
That's wow.
Yeah,

2149
01:44:49,900 --> 01:44:50,733
it might be.
I might be the only one to ever get a 

2150
01:44:52,131 --> 01:44:54,860
hernia from playing a video game.
I doubt it.

2151
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:56,120
No,
Nah,

2152
01:44:56,510 --> 01:44:58,070
Nah,
I bet people have died.

2153
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:01,370
I bet.
I bet they've contorted themselves.

2154
01:45:01,371 --> 01:45:03,440
Slipped,
broken their head open on the coffee.

2155
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:05,840
Yeah.
People have died.

2156
01:45:05,870 --> 01:45:09,200
Played millions ways of dying.
Yeah.

2157
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:10,230
Getting a hernia,
Africans.

2158
01:45:10,231 --> 01:45:13,460
You're freaking out.
That's a slight injury in comparison to.

2159
01:45:13,461 --> 01:45:16,190
I'm sure some of the shit that people 
try avoid things.

2160
01:45:16,191 --> 01:45:21,191
They fall and fall out a window and fall
16 stores their death guarantee you shit

2161
01:45:22,191 --> 01:45:23,090
has happened.
You're right.

2162
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,800
I've heard about these things.
Yeah.

2163
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:25,850
People.
Ridiculous.

2164
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:30,410
I'm going to stay away from fucking 
windows.

2165
01:45:30,850 --> 01:45:31,683
Yeah.
Don't go near windows while you're 

2166
01:45:32,511 --> 01:45:34,850
playing video games.
Don't.

2167
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:35,960
Don't blow it.
Your Hernia.

2168
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:36,943
Now deaths please.
If you haven't had a hernia surgery and 

2169
01:45:38,961 --> 01:45:39,980
you're like,
Oh man,

2170
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,130
fuck.
I don't want to get it operated on man.

2171
01:45:42,131 --> 01:45:43,160
I'm scared.
It'll take me out.

2172
01:45:43,161 --> 01:45:46,520
How much does it take you out?
Takes you out for a couple of months.

2173
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:50,090
Does it mean you'll never feel?
I don't know.

2174
01:45:50,270 --> 01:45:54,200
I guess it's not like I could go back 
and start power lifting right now.

2175
01:45:54,440 --> 01:45:56,630
It's just not going to happen.
How long has it been since surgery?

2176
01:45:57,220 --> 01:45:58,550
Uh,
had in November.

2177
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:02,300
So a few months,
so I feel good and like now I feel good.

2178
01:46:02,780 --> 01:46:04,970
So now you're at the point where it 
feels normal.

2179
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:06,290
Yeah,
that's good.

2180
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:07,233
I feel normal.
So you would recommend it to someone 

2181
01:46:08,931 --> 01:46:10,910
that also has had a hernia.

2182
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,110
A hernia?
Yeah.

2183
01:46:12,111 --> 01:46:14,240
Just chill out.
Get that surgery.

2184
01:46:14,241 --> 01:46:15,110
Absolutely.
If you,

2185
01:46:15,170 --> 01:46:18,650
if you have the umbilical one in the 
stomach.

2186
01:46:18,910 --> 01:46:19,731
Yeah.
You hear that Doug?

2187
01:46:19,731 --> 01:46:22,250
Stand up,
get yourself stitched up,

2188
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,900
bitch.
You know,

2189
01:46:23,901 --> 01:46:24,734
you always fucking walking around,
pushing your stomach in and it's 

2190
01:46:26,541 --> 01:46:27,620
fucking.
It's not cute.

2191
01:46:28,100 --> 01:46:31,550
Especially if you have the other one.
Fucking your intestines go into your nut

2192
01:46:31,551 --> 01:46:34,400
sack.
It looks like you got elephant titus.

2193
01:46:34,520 --> 01:46:35,353
Yeah.
My friend Eddie had it and he used to 

2194
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:38,360
have to push down on his abdomen when he
would talk.

2195
01:46:38,450 --> 01:46:40,340
Like he was talking loud because it pop 
out.

2196
01:46:40,360 --> 01:46:42,250
Yeah.
It's one of the worst things ever.

2197
01:46:43,050 --> 01:46:46,160
Yeah.
For feel like if you're in a loud place,

2198
01:46:46,190 --> 01:46:47,480
you know,
Jack jackhammers going off,

2199
01:46:47,481 --> 01:46:48,314
he would literally have to push his hand
into his abdomen to like keep it 

2200
01:46:51,751 --> 01:46:53,370
compressed and go.
Not performed.

2201
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:54,630
Let's get the fuck out of here.

2202
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:55,883
I performed for three,
two or three years already with that 

2203
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,870
wiping out.
Oh my God.

2204
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:02,700
It was crazy.
I don't know how to fuck it.

2205
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:04,920
Oh,
so you waited a long time before you got

2206
01:47:04,921 --> 01:47:06,290
it fixed.
Now I got to fixing it.

2207
01:47:06,300 --> 01:47:07,830
It broke once.
Oh,

2208
01:47:08,100 --> 01:47:10,730
now to get it done again.
They put a plugin so you.

2209
01:47:10,740 --> 01:47:11,573
All right,
so say the.

2210
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:13,240
The cut is about.
I mean the,

2211
01:47:13,290 --> 01:47:15,510
the hole in your stomach is about an 
inch or whatever.

2212
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:16,853
They put an inch of Mesh over it.
It's obviously going to fucking burst 

2213
01:47:21,421 --> 01:47:22,254
again.
You have to cover it with a little bit 

2214
01:47:24,211 --> 01:47:27,360
bigger piece.
So that's what the Alaskan doctor did.

2215
01:47:28,650 --> 01:47:29,950
Oh,
so you had a shitty doctor?

2216
01:47:29,970 --> 01:47:31,890
I had a shitty doctor in Queens.
I love.

2217
01:47:31,960 --> 01:47:35,910
I tell this story all the time.
I'm in the fucking waiting room first.

2218
01:47:35,911 --> 01:47:38,160
I shit myself because I don't know what 
they gave me.

2219
01:47:38,490 --> 01:47:41,220
Second of all,
they made them clean me.

2220
01:47:41,790 --> 01:47:42,623
Third of all,
I'm on the operating room about to get 

2221
01:47:45,061 --> 01:47:49,800
put under fucking guy goes to doctor Yo,
you know who that is?

2222
01:47:50,250 --> 01:47:52,650
My Dick is so shriveled because I'm 
scared.

2223
01:47:52,651 --> 01:47:56,430
I'm scared that I'm holding the blanket 
above my stomach.

2224
01:47:57,120 --> 01:47:59,130
Obviously I'm going to get knocked out,
so I'm like,

2225
01:47:59,131 --> 01:47:59,964
ah,
fuck.

2226
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:02,970
I thought that they were going to take 
pictures of my shriveled Dick.

2227
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:05,940
That was the last store that I had 
before going under surgery.

2228
01:48:06,990 --> 01:48:09,750
Think about that.
How rude blew my mind.

2229
01:48:09,780 --> 01:48:10,680
How rude.
Debbie.

2230
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,230
Yeah.
Well you gotTa,

2231
01:48:14,370 --> 01:48:17,580
you know,
people could definitely do that.

2232
01:48:17,670 --> 01:48:20,850
I'm saying it were terrible people.
Whatever.

2233
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:21,793
If if they did that,
would I have grounds to sue for 

2234
01:48:26,641 --> 01:48:28,380
defamation of character?
Definitely.

2235
01:48:28,430 --> 01:48:30,240
Because I wasn't at my finest.
No.

2236
01:48:30,270 --> 01:48:32,400
Poor representation of your horse.
Exactly.

2237
01:48:32,460 --> 01:48:35,600
Joe was terrible.
Why know that people have.

2238
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:36,863
There's definitely been people that have
gotten in trouble for doing terrible 

2239
01:48:39,451 --> 01:48:40,284
shit to like dentists doing terrible 
shit to their patients when they're 

2240
01:48:42,661 --> 01:48:43,494
under.
I heard about that from the Jerky boys 

2241
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:46,523
years ago.

2242
01:48:48,970 --> 01:48:52,920
It pulled my bow,
wake up with my badge down.

2243
01:48:56,310 --> 01:48:58,350
That shit.
The jerky boys,

2244
01:48:58,710 --> 01:48:59,543
people forgot.
Forgot how funny some of those fucking 

2245
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:07,430
recordings where Frank Rizzo says little
chest.

2246
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:11,310
Those were funny man.
These young kids,

2247
01:49:11,311 --> 01:49:14,550
if you've never heard of the jerky boys 
go and listen.

2248
01:49:14,580 --> 01:49:17,370
They would call people up and pretend 
that things were going on.

2249
01:49:18,360 --> 01:49:21,750
Greg Fitzsimmons did some of those.
He did some of his own and he did one of

2250
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:22,584
them where he called this rental car 
company with like this heavy Boston 

2251
01:49:24,451 --> 01:49:27,260
accent.
It was telling them the card they rented

2252
01:49:27,300 --> 01:49:29,030
was on fire and he's getting

2253
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:34,410
cars on fire.
His fucking solly we went to the fucking

2254
01:49:34,411 --> 01:49:38,130
gas station.
His asshole didn't bring the fucking gas

2255
01:49:38,131 --> 01:49:38,964
tank.
So we had pots and pans filled with 

2256
01:49:41,131 --> 01:49:44,940
gasoline and the Qa people are going 
what?

2257
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:48,020
You had pots and pans filled with and 
the car that

2258
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:49,740
you listen,
the Kas on fire.

2259
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:51,303
You got to get over here.
Frank calls are always good Chinese 

2260
01:49:55,571 --> 01:49:57,130
restaurants,
wherever you could call.

2261
01:49:57,310 --> 01:49:58,570
What do you remember?
Um,

2262
01:49:59,740 --> 01:50:02,830
Jimmy Kimmel had a television show.
Cranky anchors.

2263
01:50:02,920 --> 01:50:03,730
Oh,
you remember that?

2264
01:50:03,730 --> 01:50:04,563
Yup.
And it was all prank calls done with 

2265
01:50:06,430 --> 01:50:09,570
sock puppets.
I remember it was funny as a flood,

2266
01:50:10,340 --> 01:50:14,680
it was funny you could,
you use to be able to do stuff like that

2267
01:50:14,681 --> 01:50:17,980
in Vegas.
Like Nevada had like a different rule.

2268
01:50:18,160 --> 01:50:21,250
Like you could use people's calls for 
something like that.

2269
01:50:21,251 --> 01:50:23,830
Whereas he can't in California,
you'd have to tell them,

2270
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,840
hey,
I'm going to use this,

2271
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:28,780
I'm going to record this call.
And then everything after that,

2272
01:50:28,781 --> 01:50:29,614
you could use anything before you said 
that you couldn't use it would be under 

2273
01:50:32,161 --> 01:50:34,240
admissible inadmissible.
Excuse me.

2274
01:50:34,260 --> 01:50:36,070
Inadmissible.
Inadmissible.

2275
01:50:37,030 --> 01:50:39,400
Yeah.
I mean,

2276
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:41,140
I know there's a lot,
you know,

2277
01:50:41,230 --> 01:50:42,063
I've been caught out there like baby 
mother trying to start drama with me 

2278
01:50:48,161 --> 01:50:48,994
over the phone,
have me on three way and I say some 

2279
01:50:51,941 --> 01:50:52,870
crazy shit.

2280
01:50:53,830 --> 01:50:56,790
And then like six of a fucking family 
members here,

2281
01:50:58,090 --> 01:50:58,923
boy,
that should be inadmissible in life to 

2282
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:05,350
set up.
You want the freedom to say crazy shit.

2283
01:51:05,410 --> 01:51:08,110
I mean at the end of the day,
like if you provoked me,

2284
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,740
it's funny because there's two ways of 
looking at it,

2285
01:51:11,741 --> 01:51:12,574
right?
So like you want the freedom freedom to 

2286
01:51:13,991 --> 01:51:14,824
say crazy shit.
She wants everybody to know how fucking 

2287
01:51:16,451 --> 01:51:17,980
crazy you really are.
That's true.

2288
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,110
So she wants to have people listening to
you.

2289
01:51:20,111 --> 01:51:25,111
You know how crazy this mother fucker is
screaming and yelling.

2290
01:51:25,690 --> 01:51:26,650
And she's like,
see,

2291
01:51:26,651 --> 01:51:31,470
I told you,
yeah,

2292
01:51:32,110 --> 01:51:33,400
I'm an asshole.
Well,

2293
01:51:33,430 --> 01:51:35,500
pretty much.
I'm a fucking asshole.

2294
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:37,390
Do you?
Would you want to change?

2295
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:39,900
Do you want to come to Jesus moment?
Uh,

2296
01:51:39,920 --> 01:51:40,631
no.
No.

2297
01:51:40,631 --> 01:51:43,630
You're happy with who you are.
I'm ecstatic.

2298
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:45,490
You don't seem like an asshole right 
now.

2299
01:51:45,540 --> 01:51:46,420
It seemed very friendly.

2300
01:51:46,510 --> 01:51:48,040
Thank you man.
Appreciate that.

2301
01:51:48,910 --> 01:51:50,830
Were high.
That helps.

2302
01:51:50,860 --> 01:51:53,650
But I wasn't when we came here and we 
started playing pool.

2303
01:51:54,100 --> 01:51:55,740
Very nice guy.
I was all right.

2304
01:51:56,080 --> 01:51:56,920
A nice guy.
Yeah,

2305
01:51:56,921 --> 01:51:57,754
I'm decent.
I'm,

2306
01:51:57,970 --> 01:51:59,780
I'm all right.
Once you get to know me,

2307
01:51:59,781 --> 01:52:02,380
you won't like me anymore.
No,

2308
01:52:02,530 --> 01:52:03,730
really?
Nah.

2309
01:52:03,880 --> 01:52:05,140
I'm a good guy.
No,

2310
01:52:05,141 --> 01:52:06,340
I think you're a good guy.
I am.

2311
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:08,830
How high are you right now?
I'm not that way.

2312
01:52:09,240 --> 01:52:10,440
I'm high,
but you know,

2313
01:52:10,450 --> 01:52:12,910
I'm like,
I'm normal level.

2314
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:15,760
I feel like we were getting trapped with
the first few sentence.

2315
01:52:15,820 --> 01:52:18,330
Three words of the sentences were saying
and they,

2316
01:52:18,331 --> 01:52:19,164
we're committed to these sentences and 
we don't know exactly what we're going 

2317
01:52:21,611 --> 01:52:22,444
to say when we started talking.
So we're making it up as we go along 

2318
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:27,730
that high.
That's how high we are right now.

2319
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:28,990
Shit.
All this about.

2320
01:52:29,110 --> 01:52:30,570
Good guy.
Bad Guy shed.

2321
01:52:30,580 --> 01:52:32,170
You don't even know what you're talking 
about and neither do.

2322
01:52:32,171 --> 01:52:35,560
I have no clue.
I have no idea what's going on.

2323
01:52:36,460 --> 01:52:38,410
So don't commit us to any of these 
quotes.

2324
01:52:38,411 --> 01:52:42,070
Latest Jello and that's my point.
Leave action alone.

2325
01:52:42,670 --> 01:52:44,770
He's not a bad guy.
I'm a great guy.

2326
01:52:45,620 --> 01:52:47,340
Good Pool player to man.
Not a play.

2327
01:52:47,341 --> 01:52:49,690
Some pool.
You got a good grip on the queue.

2328
01:52:49,810 --> 01:52:50,970
I'm decent.
I'd.

2329
01:52:51,060 --> 01:52:52,850
It used to be better.
I could tell.

2330
01:52:53,330 --> 01:52:54,950
I could tell.
He definitely,

2331
01:52:54,951 --> 01:52:55,581
uh,
have,

2332
01:52:55,581 --> 01:52:57,230
uh,
more than casual understanding of how to

2333
01:52:57,231 --> 01:52:59,530
play for sure.
I was still,

2334
01:53:00,240 --> 01:53:01,073
I was still,
I spent some time in pool halls and 

2335
01:53:03,231 --> 01:53:04,064
queens,
you know,

2336
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:07,970
stood on the wall.
Those places are important for sure.

2337
01:53:08,540 --> 01:53:09,373
That dying out stopped billiard fucking 
millennium billiards on Fannie Lou 

2338
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,090
Boulevard with the Asians,
with the fucking polo shirt,

2339
01:53:17,091 --> 01:53:22,091
with a collar,
popped Asians with the collar blue light

2340
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:27,701
blue motherfuckers having drag races on 
the Strip and the mustangs civics.

2341
01:53:29,960 --> 01:53:32,690
Acuras it.
Chelsea billiards in New York.

2342
01:53:32,691 --> 01:53:37,691
There was always a lot of like really 
strong Asian players that gambled a lot.

2343
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:39,171
Oh,
for sure.

2344
01:53:39,171 --> 01:53:40,004
Go in there talking mad shit.
There was a bunch of these dudes that 

2345
01:53:42,131 --> 01:53:46,010
were really colorful guys in the pool 
community that were these Asian cats,

2346
01:53:46,250 --> 01:53:47,540
Koreans,
uh,

2347
01:53:47,690 --> 01:53:49,400
one guy was like,
one guy was Chinese.

2348
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:52,590
It's one Korean dude though.
Gambled like crazy.

2349
01:53:52,591 --> 01:53:54,410
You need to come in and talking mad 
shit.

2350
01:53:54,411 --> 01:53:55,244
And he was just like that Polo shirt on 
looking preppy going right into the 

2351
01:53:58,491 --> 01:54:00,440
heart of the jungle and the pool 
culture,

2352
01:54:00,441 --> 01:54:02,030
which was Chelsea billiards.
Yup.

2353
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:05,660
That's crazy man.
They to find a culture.

2354
01:54:05,960 --> 01:54:07,150
It's,
I dunno,

2355
01:54:07,430 --> 01:54:08,263
Asians in general.
I feel like they're good at like 

2356
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:13,940
precision games.
Definitely good at pool.

2357
01:54:13,990 --> 01:54:14,823
Yeah.
Some of the best players in the world 

2358
01:54:15,771 --> 01:54:17,190
are Asian.
That,

2359
01:54:17,300 --> 01:54:18,650
that girl,
the black widow.

2360
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:20,460
Yup.
She's incredible.

2361
01:54:20,990 --> 01:54:23,660
There's a bunch of guys,
Kopi men,

2362
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:25,813
so I think he's from Taiwan,
a bunch of guys from Taiwan that are 

2363
01:54:27,771 --> 01:54:30,880
really good.
Lot of a lot of Asians,

2364
01:54:30,890 --> 01:54:32,900
especially Filipinos,
Filipinos.

2365
01:54:32,901 --> 01:54:33,734
That's pretty much the number one 
country of the United States have like 

2366
01:54:37,310 --> 01:54:39,250
the greatest pool players ever.
Really?

2367
01:54:39,560 --> 01:54:40,760
Yeah,
for one spot.

2368
01:54:40,850 --> 01:54:42,380
It's tough to fuck.
With the Philippines,

2369
01:54:42,381 --> 01:54:45,020
they have like some of the all time 
greatest just from one,

2370
01:54:45,200 --> 01:54:46,640
you know,
it's a bunch of islands.

2371
01:54:46,641 --> 01:54:48,230
I think it's like a thousand islands,
right?

2372
01:54:48,231 --> 01:54:49,280
Yeah.
Isn't it crazy?

2373
01:54:49,790 --> 01:54:50,623
But uh,
a gang of them come from the 

2374
01:54:52,581 --> 01:54:53,414
Philippines.
The US Gis apparently dropped pool off 

2375
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:58,910
over there when they were in like world 
war.

2376
01:54:59,060 --> 01:55:01,430
What was it to World War Two,
they were in the Philippines.

2377
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:03,793
They brought pool tables over to 
entertain the Gis and that's apparently 

2378
01:55:07,911 --> 01:55:08,744
how Filipinos got involved in pool.
That's allegedly the story that the 

2379
01:55:12,891 --> 01:55:15,230
pool,
the pool community a says,

2380
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:16,273
well in Vietnam seems like the Gis 
brought funk music to fucking Vietnam 

2381
01:55:23,811 --> 01:55:24,644
and Thailand and all those,
like wherever they were because there's 

2382
01:55:27,621 --> 01:55:28,454
some funky mother fucking music that 
comes from the seventies and in the 

2383
01:55:32,721 --> 01:55:33,554
Vietnamese like Vietnamese.
So music that sounds like motherfuckers 

2384
01:55:38,690 --> 01:55:40,130
from Harlem of playing,
you know.

2385
01:55:40,370 --> 01:55:41,930
Wow.
Incredible stuff.

2386
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:44,100
Wow.
And it's in their language,

2387
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:48,120
which is even crazier because it sounds 
amazing.

2388
01:55:48,330 --> 01:55:49,740
What is,
give me a name of something,

2389
01:55:50,010 --> 01:55:54,540
just look up Vietnamese or Thai.
Pop were Vietnamese funk.

2390
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:57,100
There's this one specific,
um,

2391
01:55:58,050 --> 01:56:01,080
album,
I think it's called Saigon Rock.

2392
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,253
It's pretty next level.
There's a picture of a woman on it on 

2393
01:56:07,381 --> 01:56:10,380
the cover.
I'm going to find that.

2394
01:56:10,570 --> 01:56:12,000
I find that.
I love.

2395
01:56:12,001 --> 01:56:13,620
There it is.
Bam.

2396
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:14,473
Jam on the ball.
Saigon Rock and managed to establish 

2397
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:19,683
some of those.

2398
01:56:22,040 --> 01:56:26,150
Oh my God.
Nineteen 68 to 19.

2399
01:56:29,010 --> 01:56:34,010
Holy Shit.
Wow.

2400
01:56:47,690 --> 01:56:52,690
Whoa.
Wow.

2401
01:56:57,930 --> 01:56:59,370
That's just.
Sounds crazy.

2402
01:57:01,010 --> 01:57:01,843
Wow.

2403
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:06,810
I was listening to,
uh,

2404
01:57:06,890 --> 01:57:07,620
this,
uh,

2405
01:57:07,620 --> 01:57:08,453
I don't speak Spanish and I don't.
Obviously I don't speak Vietnamese 

2406
01:57:11,261 --> 01:57:12,790
either,
so when I'm listening to that,

2407
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:14,510
it gives me this,
uh,

2408
01:57:14,860 --> 01:57:15,693
it gives you like a little extra kind of
cooled charge to it if you don't even 

2409
01:57:18,911 --> 01:57:20,650
know what the fuck they're saying and 
you're trying to,

2410
01:57:20,660 --> 01:57:22,570
you try to mimic it.
There's,

2411
01:57:22,571 --> 01:57:23,404
I'm just making noises that sound like.
What does Joey Diaz is band Jamie Cho 

2412
01:57:27,831 --> 01:57:29,800
ideas.
His nephew's ban or his,

2413
01:57:29,880 --> 01:57:32,970
his cousins band.
Is it x off?

2414
01:57:33,010 --> 01:57:34,330
I've got them on my,
uh,

2415
01:57:35,110 --> 01:57:37,450
my music here somewhere.
I'm trying to find it though.

2416
01:57:38,700 --> 01:57:39,610
Would they?
Um,

2417
01:57:40,900 --> 01:57:44,380

I'm a band out of Cuba.

2418
01:57:44,700 --> 01:57:46,780
Is Joey's families out of Cuba?
X,

2419
01:57:46,781 --> 01:57:50,600
Alfonso Mal Fonzo?
I think it's x though.

2420
01:57:50,680 --> 01:57:54,290
No Bueno Vista Social Club?
No.

2421
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:56,190
Well that's one of them.
But uh,

2422
01:57:56,191 --> 01:57:57,910
there's uh,
the um,

2423
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:00,360
the band that they're in is X.
Alfonso.

2424
01:58:00,790 --> 01:58:02,490
This is from his twitter is where I got 
that.

2425
01:58:02,820 --> 01:58:03,780
Oh,
that's his cousin.

2426
01:58:03,781 --> 01:58:06,510
Yeah.
The band that this I haven't seen,

2427
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:08,400
but there's a band that I was listening 
to.

2428
01:58:08,401 --> 01:58:13,401
It's called x Alfonso.
They are fucking bad ass dude.

2429
01:58:14,100 --> 01:58:15,780
Oh my God.
They're bad.

2430
01:58:15,781 --> 01:58:17,670
And I don't know what they're saying.
It's,

2431
01:58:17,720 --> 01:58:18,553
it's just,
it's really cool because when you're 

2432
01:58:19,711 --> 01:58:22,570
listening to it,
these are guess joe is cut.

2433
01:58:22,630 --> 01:58:24,580
His cousins may not loose

2434
01:58:24,820 --> 01:58:27,100
in the bottom and the bottom here you 
comments and I says,

2435
01:58:27,101 --> 01:58:28,960
all I know is xcel fonts,
so thank you.

2436
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:30,610
Oh,
okay.

2437
01:58:34,440 --> 01:58:35,273
Yeah.
Someone asked him what the name of his 

2438
01:58:35,661 --> 01:58:38,140
cousins rock band was.
All I know is xcel font.

2439
01:58:38,141 --> 01:58:39,670
So that's just a couple of years ago 
too.

2440
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:42,100
Okay.
Um,

2441
01:58:42,490 --> 01:58:44,950
so I guess that's his cousin,
but whatever,

2442
01:58:44,951 --> 01:58:46,840
man,
they're fucking bad ass.

2443
01:58:48,130 --> 01:58:48,963
They're cool too because I like 
listening to stuff like this when I 

2444
01:58:51,131 --> 01:58:53,470
write because I don't know what the fuck
they're saying.

2445
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:55,720
It's just cool.
You know,

2446
01:58:55,721 --> 01:58:56,554
I don't,
I don't have to like follow their 

2447
01:58:57,281 --> 01:58:59,800
narrative.
I get just enjoy it.

2448
01:58:59,860 --> 01:59:01,660
I can just enjoy the sound of it,
you know?

2449
01:59:01,780 --> 01:59:03,490
Absolutely.
I agree.

2450
01:59:16,220 --> 01:59:17,053
Yes.

2451
01:59:18,910 --> 01:59:19,743
This is a more of a traditional song,
like they have some crazy wild rock and 

2452
01:59:23,781 --> 01:59:25,870
roll shit.
See if you can find like,

2453
01:59:26,080 --> 01:59:27,910
I don't want to give people the wrong 
impression.

2454
01:59:27,911 --> 01:59:31,060
Like what kind of music they have 
because I fucking speak Spanish.

2455
01:59:31,061 --> 01:59:35,930
I understand what they're saying here.
See if he could find revert.

2456
01:59:35,940 --> 01:59:36,773
Yeah,
revert.

2457
01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:45,390
This is a really cool video to the is 
really amazingly shot,

2458
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:49,800
like really bright graphics and

2459
01:59:58,930 --> 02:00:01,900
so what they're doing is they're playing
this song forward and backward.

2460
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:10,930
Did you fast forward it to like deep 
into the song about 30 seconds.

2461
02:00:12,980 --> 02:00:13,880
Interesting.
Shit.

2462
02:00:14,720 --> 02:00:16,580
So this is Joey Diaz,
his cousins.

2463
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:20,510
So I guess it's fucking talent and 
mjeans.

2464
02:00:21,740 --> 02:00:23,480
Have you been to Cuba yet?
Nope.

2465
02:00:23,630 --> 02:00:25,250
Are you going to go?
I would like to.

2466
02:00:25,251 --> 02:00:27,410
I want to go there before it becomes a 
tourist trap.

2467
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:30,650
Yeah.
As soon as four g lte gets there,

2468
02:00:30,651 --> 02:00:31,790
it's over.
It's over.

2469
02:00:31,870 --> 02:00:35,540
I don't want to be able to use my phone.
Well,

2470
02:00:35,660 --> 02:00:36,493
you can use it in some spots apparently.
Apparently there's some spots where you 

2471
02:00:40,370 --> 02:00:44,450
can go where you could use your phone.
Fucking whack.

2472
02:00:44,510 --> 02:00:46,880
It's weird,
but I want them to have phones.

2473
02:00:46,881 --> 02:00:48,780
I'm torn.
You know,

2474
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:53,690
phones are phones won't work is if their
phones don't work.

2475
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:56,090
That's true.
So yeah,

2476
02:00:56,091 --> 02:01:01,091
they should have phones now that now 
that to my attention in that manner,

2477
02:01:01,760 --> 02:01:04,190
they should definitely have phones,
but there seem to be.

2478
02:01:04,370 --> 02:01:05,203
They did.
They put together a pretty amazing 

2479
02:01:07,131 --> 02:01:09,050
culture without it.
Shit.

2480
02:01:09,060 --> 02:01:10,370
No,
it's legendary.

2481
02:01:10,371 --> 02:01:11,204
It's classic.
Look at the architecture and all those 

2482
02:01:13,941 --> 02:01:18,941
colors and old cars.
The old cars.

2483
02:01:19,221 --> 02:01:20,800
Yeah,
just a musical.

2484
02:01:20,870 --> 02:01:21,703
If you watch that winter,
this social club stuff and that 

2485
02:01:24,231 --> 02:01:26,080
documentary,
it's really mind blowing.

2486
02:01:26,270 --> 02:01:30,650
It's is actually very beautiful.
The music that they make is unreal.

2487
02:01:30,651 --> 02:01:31,484
It's unbelievable.
And just the way it's shot is like 

2488
02:01:34,371 --> 02:01:35,450
magical.
Yeah.

2489
02:01:35,451 --> 02:01:36,284
They,
they definitely have a sound in the 

2490
02:01:37,851 --> 02:01:41,960
style of their own and to think that all
of that was taking place over the last,

2491
02:01:42,500 --> 02:01:44,420
you know,
50 or so years,

2492
02:01:45,320 --> 02:01:46,153
just 90 miles away from us.
We had no idea and on top of that 

2493
02:01:49,730 --> 02:01:52,390
they're like,
we weren't even allowed to visit for for

2494
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:53,233
50 years.
We were kept from going to a spot and 

2495
02:01:56,031 --> 02:01:56,864
with no reason that makes any sense were
kept from going where you could get in 

2496
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:00,854
trouble,
man.

2497
02:02:01,280 --> 02:02:03,380
Like in the 19 eighties,
if you traveled to Cuba,

2498
02:02:03,440 --> 02:02:04,273
you could get in fucking trouble.
The big daddy government told you where 

2499
02:02:07,431 --> 02:02:09,110
you could visit.
Think about that.

2500
02:02:10,220 --> 02:02:12,410
You could go to Africa,
you go to the Congo,

2501
02:02:12,590 --> 02:02:15,350
they wouldn't give you a hard time,
but if you go to Cuba,

2502
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:18,830
they could lock you up just for 
visiting.

2503
02:02:19,460 --> 02:02:22,640
I want to see what it's like over there.
I want to see some people not allowed.

2504
02:02:23,240 --> 02:02:25,820
You can't it?
That's the most ridiculous thing ever.

2505
02:02:25,850 --> 02:02:28,730
It's sick.
There's no reason like you,

2506
02:02:28,990 --> 02:02:29,823
it's not for your own safety because 
there's some super dangerous spots you 

2507
02:02:32,121 --> 02:02:33,940
can go visit right now.
You know?

2508
02:02:33,980 --> 02:02:34,813
No one,
no one's going to stop you from flying 

2509
02:02:35,841 --> 02:02:37,430
Iraq,
Nicaragua.

2510
02:02:37,730 --> 02:02:38,563
No one's going to stop you from flying 
to a lot of places in this world that 

2511
02:02:41,391 --> 02:02:46,391
are in terrible,
terrible state of civil unrest.

2512
02:02:47,420 --> 02:02:50,000
You could just go.
He can go a Cuba.

2513
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:50,920
No.
Yeah.

2514
02:02:51,070 --> 02:02:52,370
Can't go to Cuba,
but we can now.

2515
02:02:53,600 --> 02:02:56,240
It was Russia's fault.
Fucking Russia.

2516
02:02:57,290 --> 02:02:59,570
I like Russia.
That was there last year.

2517
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:00,553
They went hard at us to give it a shot.
It was really great to tell you the 

2518
02:03:04,311 --> 02:03:05,960
truth.
Yeah,

2519
02:03:06,080 --> 02:03:08,930
it was a fucking very great place.
But Gray,

2520
02:03:08,931 --> 02:03:13,070
like the Weatherman,
like the color with the weather,

2521
02:03:13,071 --> 02:03:14,660
like the way it looked outside.
Yeah,

2522
02:03:14,661 --> 02:03:16,640
like not nice.
Like No.

2523
02:03:16,700 --> 02:03:19,550
No sunshine you.
And it was,

2524
02:03:19,610 --> 02:03:22,010
it was sunny out and it was definitely 
not sunshine.

2525
02:03:22,500 --> 02:03:27,320
It was a hard place was you could tell 
there was hard times.

2526
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:31,670
They breed some hard fucking people.
Some fucking Joel has been that.

2527
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:36,680
Joe's a fucking defined some of the 
scariest MMA fighters ever fatal.

2528
02:03:37,700 --> 02:03:39,260
Yup.
And uh,

2529
02:03:39,290 --> 02:03:40,123
out of Dagestan Dagestan is another 
place where just developing these 

2530
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:44,980
killers,
this,

2531
02:03:45,050 --> 02:03:47,810
this guy kid his fights in the UFC kid.
Man.

2532
02:03:47,990 --> 02:03:50,090
Man Gentlemen,
Habib number got madoff.

2533
02:03:50,620 --> 02:03:52,990
He's an ad monster.
Monster Animals.

2534
02:03:53,330 --> 02:03:54,950
Ridiculously good.
Grappler.

2535
02:03:54,980 --> 02:03:58,640
Just just destroyer.
So fucking so good.

2536
02:03:58,910 --> 02:04:00,920
Think about the all fucking old men over
there.

2537
02:04:00,921 --> 02:04:01,754
Just fucking wrestling all day long and 
the bond and the fucking wet and the 

2538
02:04:05,271 --> 02:04:06,104
cold.

2539
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:12,373
So all told with this show,
do you have a deal to do it for a 

2540
02:04:15,951 --> 02:04:19,400
certain amount of time?
Are you just doing it for as long as you

2541
02:04:19,401 --> 02:04:20,234
enjoy it right now?
It feels like it feels like it could be 

2542
02:04:22,641 --> 02:04:24,530
going on for a long time.
If it hits,

2543
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:27,920
I feel like it's gonna.
People are gonna.

2544
02:04:27,921 --> 02:04:29,770
Enjoy it as entertainment.
You know what I'm saying?

2545
02:04:30,100 --> 02:04:30,933
Shit.
You're just to view if it's nearly as 

2546
02:04:33,741 --> 02:04:36,450
good as your instagram page with the 
photos of it.

2547
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:38,130
It's good.
What was

2548
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:40,350
the slight instagram pages?
Light work.

2549
02:04:40,410 --> 02:04:44,040
What was the steak that you ate that you
have in your instagram that like age for

2550
02:04:44,041 --> 02:04:46,470
seven months.
That was at my man.

2551
02:04:46,471 --> 02:04:47,304
Mario Batali steakhouse in Vegas where 
you need to go because you're there a 

2552
02:04:50,191 --> 02:04:51,690
lot.
Seven months,

2553
02:04:51,691 --> 02:04:54,630
seven months,
right in the Venetian.

2554
02:04:54,900 --> 02:04:56,640
That's insane.
Carnevalino,

2555
02:04:56,790 --> 02:04:57,623
how do you do that?
How do you age something for seven 

2556
02:04:58,831 --> 02:05:01,110
months?
He just leave it to you.

2557
02:05:01,111 --> 02:05:03,540
Just leave that shit there and it 
becomes blue.

2558
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:07,380
All that.
That was a good picture.

2559
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:11,310
Chris grow.
So my producer took that picture,

2560
02:05:11,311 --> 02:05:12,540
man.
Oh Shit.

2561
02:05:12,541 --> 02:05:13,374
So that's Ribeye.
That was 70 day aged in like what's the 

2562
02:05:17,551 --> 02:05:19,110
temperature when they know that?
Seven,

2563
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:21,630
that seven months,
seven months,

2564
02:05:21,810 --> 02:05:24,210
not 70 days.
That's a premature child.

2565
02:05:24,211 --> 02:05:25,980
I don't want believe it.
I don't want to believe it.

2566
02:05:26,340 --> 02:05:29,250
Seven months.
What's the temperature?

2567
02:05:29,251 --> 02:05:31,590
They put it out.
They fucking grill it.

2568
02:05:31,630 --> 02:05:32,550
Very,
very hot.

2569
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:34,710
No,
I mean to keep it to aging.

2570
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:35,840
The aging,
I would.

2571
02:05:35,870 --> 02:05:38,400
I think that it was.
They wouldn't tell you exactly,

2572
02:05:38,401 --> 02:05:42,210
but I would imagine it's in between in 
the forties,

2573
02:05:42,390 --> 02:05:47,390
really 30 to 40 has it not turned into 
just rot because there's so much fat cap

2574
02:05:48,901 --> 02:05:53,901
on it that the fat protects it and the 
meat just rots inside and all that fatty

2575
02:05:57,571 --> 02:05:58,404
tissue breaks down and just becomes 
nutty and unbelievably fucking 

2576
02:06:03,061 --> 02:06:03,930
delicious,
you know,

2577
02:06:03,931 --> 02:06:04,764
and deep and incredible depth of flavor 
and developing all this earthiness and 

2578
02:06:11,401 --> 02:06:14,640
it's this Umami flavor you can't really 
explain,

2579
02:06:15,030 --> 02:06:17,040
but when you eat it,
it just melts and it's like,

2580
02:06:17,041 --> 02:06:19,710
what the fuck is going on?
Whoa.

2581
02:06:19,830 --> 02:06:23,220
Yeah.
Seven months of rot.

2582
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:24,443
To me it's like that.
If that wasn't real and we found out 

2583
02:06:27,121 --> 02:06:28,550
that the Romans used to do that.
Oh,

2584
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:29,850
they didn't be like,
of course,

2585
02:06:29,940 --> 02:06:31,500
but I'm not with refrigeration.

2586
02:06:31,560 --> 02:06:33,300
If we just found out that they used to 
do it,

2587
02:06:33,301 --> 02:06:34,134
we'd be like,
what in the fuck are these assholes 

2588
02:06:35,730 --> 02:06:36,563
doing?
They would let them meet rot away for 

2589
02:06:37,741 --> 02:06:38,574
seven months so that they could slice a 
sliver off the inside and presented and 

2590
02:06:43,351 --> 02:06:44,240
present that.
I mean,

2591
02:06:44,241 --> 02:06:45,074
how much meat goes to waste when lot.
There's a lot of waste in like what 

2592
02:06:47,881 --> 02:06:48,714
percentage you think maybe 30 to 40 
percent of the product because the bone 

2593
02:06:53,911 --> 02:06:56,670
is huge and then the meat is just meat 
is like this.

2594
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:57,953
That's how much missed?
About five inches long and paused and 

2595
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:08,510
three inches wide out of the whole cow 
at the Ribeye.

2596
02:07:09,020 --> 02:07:12,180
That's that rebuts the fucking read.
It has the big ass bone.

2597
02:07:12,181 --> 02:07:16,880
It has that thick as fat.
They have to cut off so they must lose a

2598
02:07:16,881 --> 02:07:17,714
substantial amount of me.
That shit is like a fucking $200 an 

2599
02:07:20,911 --> 02:07:21,570
inch.

2600
02:07:21,570 --> 02:07:22,403
Wow.
So that's like the worst ecofriendly 

2601
02:07:26,040 --> 02:07:30,090
meet ever.
But it's sublime.

2602
02:07:30,920 --> 02:07:32,820
Sublime tasting.
It's like.

2603
02:07:34,020 --> 02:07:34,853
It's bizarre how far people will go out 
of their way to try to like rig the 

2604
02:07:39,101 --> 02:07:42,010
perfect steak.
Something like this where you're letting

2605
02:07:42,011 --> 02:07:42,844
some meat sit for seven months.
That means they had to take it up until 

2606
02:07:44,681 --> 02:07:47,560
like a year and then they back off.
We can't eat this shit.

2607
02:07:47,590 --> 02:07:51,990
Now there's this 12 months,
there is 12 month men.

2608
02:07:52,600 --> 02:07:54,370
How big is it?
They serve it to you.

2609
02:07:54,371 --> 02:07:55,204
It's,
it's,

2610
02:07:55,330 --> 02:07:55,840
it's.
Yeah.

2611
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:57,580
It's about the same thing.
It's a little.

2612
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:58,743
It's a little bit smaller than that,
but the last remaining cells that 

2613
02:08:01,241 --> 02:08:06,241
haven't turned to total shit,
exact area and the new aids runs rampant

2614
02:08:06,341 --> 02:08:11,341
through your cooler and that is the most
delicious bite of food on the planet.

2615
02:08:11,951 --> 02:08:13,520
Apparently.
God,

2616
02:08:13,540 --> 02:08:14,373
according to these motherfuckers and I 
just had that the seven month there's 

2617
02:08:18,150 --> 02:08:18,983
like food like you can't believe,
and so there's a big difference between 

2618
02:08:21,851 --> 02:08:24,070
the five,
the seven month and five months later.

2619
02:08:24,100 --> 02:08:25,690
One hundred percent are you fucking 
kidding me?

2620
02:08:29,620 --> 02:08:32,980
How much better is the one that's a year
you need to try it.

2621
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:35,800
I haven't tried that one yet,
but I feel that it's going to be very.

2622
02:08:35,801 --> 02:08:40,240
You can't have too much to the size of 
like a flip phone portion.

2623
02:08:43,260 --> 02:08:45,460
Not the smaller one.
The smaller one.

2624
02:08:45,490 --> 02:08:46,630
Oh,
smaller iphone.

2625
02:08:46,870 --> 02:08:49,150
But like I said,
they're going to give you like a quarter

2626
02:08:49,150 --> 02:08:51,580
inch or half finished piece because it's
too old.

2627
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:54,190
It's like eating a whole thing of blue 
cheese.

2628
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:56,620
White in one bite.
Oh,

2629
02:08:56,630 --> 02:08:58,750
it's like the amount of bacteria.
No,

2630
02:08:58,751 --> 02:08:59,920
no.
I'm saying like the taste.

2631
02:09:00,600 --> 02:09:01,630
I love blue cheese.
Almost.

2632
02:09:01,631 --> 02:09:04,450
Tastes like you're eating silver.
Oh yeah.

2633
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:07,060
You know what I mean?
Because it's fucking fungus.

2634
02:09:07,090 --> 02:09:08,050
Exactly.
That's,

2635
02:09:08,060 --> 02:09:10,750
and I love that shit.
I love that.

2636
02:09:10,751 --> 02:09:14,370
I love Funky Shit.
Cheese.

2637
02:09:14,380 --> 02:09:17,950
We were in Paris eating two year old,
three year old,

2638
02:09:18,670 --> 02:09:21,510
eight year old cheeses.
Boy She used.

2639
02:09:21,510 --> 02:09:23,560
That's been buried and shit.
Hey,

2640
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:27,790
all kinds of craziness.
You have the Paris folk.

2641
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:30,450
I've really figured out a way to make 
that stuff stink.

2642
02:09:30,750 --> 02:09:32,500
It stinks.
Love.

2643
02:09:32,530 --> 02:09:33,363
They love that stuff.
Know that was like one of the main 

2644
02:09:35,681 --> 02:09:39,790
ingredients we used to use on fear 
factor to make things smell worse.

2645
02:09:39,850 --> 02:09:41,500
Cheese,
expensive cheese.

2646
02:09:41,530 --> 02:09:42,160
Rarely.
Yeah.

2647
02:09:42,160 --> 02:09:46,420
They would go to um,
they would go to like a place in beverly

2648
02:09:46,421 --> 02:09:47,254
hills where they have like a,
just a giant selection of the grossest 

2649
02:09:54,491 --> 02:09:58,900
rankest fucking funkiest cheeses.
We opened the cart and you're like,

2650
02:09:59,770 --> 02:10:03,130
what the fuck?
And it's super expensive and that stuff,

2651
02:10:03,131 --> 02:10:03,964
I don't remember what it was called.
They would throw that stuff in the 

2652
02:10:05,081 --> 02:10:07,450
blenders to make like bugs smell worse.

2653
02:10:10,060 --> 02:10:14,800
No wonder they fucking threw up all the 
tabs there and just start throwing up.

2654
02:10:15,200 --> 02:10:17,530
Yeah.
The bugs itself was not nearly as bad as

2655
02:10:17,531 --> 02:10:21,600
bugs blended in with cheese,
a funky ass cheeks.

2656
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:22,673
The smell was just,
especially if you didn't know what 

2657
02:10:24,131 --> 02:10:26,950
you're doing,
like if you smell certain cheeses,

2658
02:10:27,130 --> 02:10:28,870
if you didn't know what you were eating,
you'd be like,

2659
02:10:28,871 --> 02:10:30,460
what the fuck,
get this out of here.

2660
02:10:30,700 --> 02:10:32,980
But because you know it as a pleasant 
taste to,

2661
02:10:33,110 --> 02:10:35,240
you know it's cheese.
Your brain goes,

2662
02:10:35,241 --> 02:10:36,350
yeah,
oh this smells funky.

2663
02:10:36,351 --> 02:10:38,670
Like you'll smell some.
Some really weird cheesy like,

2664
02:10:38,990 --> 02:10:40,160
oh wow,
yeah woo.

2665
02:10:40,220 --> 02:10:42,020
But then you eat it like,
whoa.

2666
02:10:42,080 --> 02:10:42,920
Oh,
you feel that,

2667
02:10:43,220 --> 02:10:46,850
that interesting flavors in your mouth.
So you associate with a good thing.

2668
02:10:47,030 --> 02:10:50,960
Even though it smells funky.
There's lot of cheese that had literally

2669
02:10:50,961 --> 02:10:55,020
smelled like six day old nut sack,
you know?

2670
02:10:55,670 --> 02:10:57,300
And but like fat,
nuts,

2671
02:10:57,301 --> 02:10:58,134
sag.
Like when you're overweight like mine 

2672
02:10:59,630 --> 02:11:03,260
and it's not pleasant and it's.
But once you get down to it,

2673
02:11:03,740 --> 02:11:05,900
taste is very sweet.
Yeah.

2674
02:11:06,650 --> 02:11:08,650
The task is my nut.
Sack of pattern.

2675
02:11:11,150 --> 02:11:14,240
How dare you.
I'm listening.

2676
02:11:14,241 --> 02:11:16,130
I got to get the fuck out of here.
Let's get outta here.

2677
02:11:16,220 --> 02:11:17,610
I gotta go eat something.
I,

2678
02:11:17,611 --> 02:11:20,390
I can't.
I have players going into Ketosis,

2679
02:11:20,420 --> 02:11:22,030
family stuff I have to do.
No wait,

2680
02:11:22,031 --> 02:11:23,930
when are you going into.
You're going into the other one.

2681
02:11:23,990 --> 02:11:25,510
What's the other way?
I don't want to go into it.

2682
02:11:25,511 --> 02:11:27,440
You don't want to know what the other 
one is one.

2683
02:11:27,441 --> 02:11:30,170
You don't want to go into whatever the 
one,

2684
02:11:30,230 --> 02:11:32,300
the Carbo one.
Psychosis.

2685
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:35,340
A Action Bronson.
Thank you very much sir.

2686
02:11:35,360 --> 02:11:36,930
Thank you.
It was fun.

2687
02:11:37,020 --> 02:11:38,990
It's cool hanging with you.
Grabbed one guy.

2688
02:11:39,050 --> 02:11:40,520
Good Times.
And uh,

2689
02:11:40,530 --> 02:11:41,930
your show.
If people want to watch it,

2690
02:11:41,931 --> 02:11:43,040
how can they catch it?
Fuck,

2691
02:11:43,041 --> 02:11:45,470

Action Bronson.
Google me.

2695
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:55,520
Action motherfucking Bronx.
February 29th.

2696
02:11:55,521 --> 02:11:59,660
Viceland launches were taking over 
history to channel.

2697
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:03,290
So we're going to be all over the place.
March,

2698
02:12:03,291 --> 02:12:05,270
Third Thursdays.
10 o'clock.

2699
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:07,790
Fuck.
That's delicious on cable.

2700
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:10,550
Every network possible.
You understand me?

2701
02:12:10,790 --> 02:12:12,350
I understand you.
Thank you sir.

2702
