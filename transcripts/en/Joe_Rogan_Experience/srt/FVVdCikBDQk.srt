1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,800
Four,
three,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,300
two,
one.

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,520
And we're live.
What's up bro?

4
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:14,290
I'm doing okay now.
Ten seconds ago around the area where I 

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,650
wanted it to be that way it's more 
natural sometimes,

6
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:21,470
like some of the best stuff gets said 
off Mike.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:25,400
So we figured now how to do it where 
people get in and as soon as,

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:27,530
pretty much as soon as we sit down,
we started talking.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,120
Um,
no complaints.

10
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,560
So you contacted us after the Leah 
Remini interview,

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,760
right?
And you wanted to get on and you have 

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,901
this book that you wrote called ruthless
with the correct pronunciation.

13
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:42,410
Is Cabbage,
miscavige,

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,940
miscavige,
Ms Dot Kavin.

15
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,630
The actual name of the book is rootless 
scientology.

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,740
My son David miscavige in me right now.
Let me,

17
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,260
let me just say this before we get 
started,

18
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:58,261
because scientology,
this is the first time I've ever been 

19
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:58,690
contacted.
They sent a,

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,790
uh,
an email to my publicist and they have a

21
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:08,791
rebuttal to what you wrote and their 
rebuttal is that a website?

22
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:14,550
Ron miscavige book dot Com.
And they want people to know about their

23
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:20,230
website,
which is scientology.org.

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:23,470
And they have a statement.
This is their statement,

25
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,930
Ron miscavige is seeking to make money 
on the name of his famous son,

26
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:31,360
David miscavige.
Oh,

27
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,510
David miscavige is taken care of his 
father throughout his life,

28
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:39,070
both financially and by helping him and 
even the most dire circumstances.

29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:44,430
Ron miscavige was nowhere around when 
David miscavige ascended to the 

30
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,751
leadership of the Church of scientology 
mentioned by and working directly with 

31
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:54,391
the religions,
founder l dot Ron Hubbard and entrusted 

32
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:57,781
by him with the future of the church and
he father exploiting his son in this 

33
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:03,481
manner is a sad exercise of betrayal.
Mr David miscavige has far reaching 

34
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:08,830
vision and unrelenting dedication.
Has brought the Church of Scientology to

35
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:12,250
where it is today,
guaranteeing it's future for generations

36
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:17,251
to come.
Scientologists worldwide love and 

37
00:02:17,251 --> 00:02:20,941
respect Mr.
Ms Dot for his tireless work on behalf 

38
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:20,941
of their religion.

39
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:25,600
So that's,
that's their statement that they wanted 

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,340
to say and I feel like it's only fair.
You know,

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,400
we had Leah Remini on and we have you on
and I've had a Louis Theroux on and look

42
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,980
at.
I feel like I don't know the story,

43
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:40,810
but anytime a father is so disconnected 
from his son,

44
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,440
they have to write a book about him.
It's a sad time.

45
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,930
Do you feel like that?
No.

46
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,470
You don't feel sad at all?
I don't feel that.

47
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,050
I just woke up one day and said I'd like
to write a book about scientology and if

48
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:58,300
I can give you a short encapsulated 
statement,

49
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,740
I think we could a nice

50
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,100
groundwork for the whole interview.
You mind if I do that?

51
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:03,800
Sure.
Okay.

52
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:08,980
I was a scientologist for 42 years.
Were you raised in it?

53
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,950
No.
I got my family in in 1970,

54
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,960
but I was in the church for 42 years.
The last 26 and a half years.

55
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,990
I worked at the international base in 
Hemet,

56
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:25,020
California.
I escaped from that base on March 25th,

57
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,160
2012.
You escaped?

58
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
Escaped.
That's right.

59
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,790
I had the plan that escape for six 
months.

60
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:35,791
We can go into this in more detail,
but just let me give you this short 

61
00:03:35,791 --> 00:03:36,430
story.
About a year and a half later,

62
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,060
there was a private and guest 
investigator caught by the name of 

63
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,121
Dwayne Powell,
who was around the corner from my house 

64
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:50,070
looking at a house to buy so he could 
spy on me from that house and they just 

65
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,660
know shit.
So a lady in the neighborhood som and 

66
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,720
she thought he was a drug dealer or up 
to no good.

67
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,720
So she called the West Allis police and 
Nick Pike came out and confronted the 

68
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,250
guy.
He gave nicky some shit and nick said,

69
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:04,750
hey listen man,
you're under arrest.

70
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,110
Do you mind if I look in your car?
So Nick went to the van and opened it 

71
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,360
up.
And then the trunk,

72
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:13,900
there were five license plates from five
different states.

73
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:17,020
There were two handguns,
a stun gun,

74
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,620
two rifles.
One fitted up with a silencer in 2000 

75
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,030
rounds of ammunition.
So they arrested the guy,

76
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,360
they took him in for interrogation.
And then his son came looking for him 

77
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:32,680
because his son was a partner in this 
business.

78
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,310
The father's name was Dwayne Powell and 
the sun was Daniel Powell.

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,610
Daniel came looking for his father.
And by the way,

80
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,550
if you want to hear these interviews,
they're on Tony Ortega's website,

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,880
Tony Ortega to underground bunker.
You can hear what I'm telling you.

82
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,960
Okay.
So Daniel is telling me,

83
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,900
you know,
how they operated.

84
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:54,901
They were getting paid $10,000
a week to follow me and report on my 

85
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:56,380
doings from 8:00
in the morning until 8:00

86
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,810
every night.
An incident happened

87
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,380
in Janesville,
Wisconsin.

88
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,030
What do you do?
Like what could you possibly do that 

89
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,580
would be worth studying?
Is it just a freak you out?

90
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,100
Like that's what I don't understand.
Like if you follow like if I fall,

91
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,100
Jamie,
you know what?

92
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,270
You know what I'm going to get.
I'm going to get Jamie looking at the 

93
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:16,270
Internet.
Jamie watching basketball.

94
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,350
Maybe Jamie goes to the gym.
Maybe Jamie goes for a run.

95
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,580
You.
Jamie goes on tinder and does a little 

96
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:23,580
right.
Right swiping right.

97
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Okay.
You could get out of watching them.

98
00:05:26,721 --> 00:05:28,880
It's not like you're out there burying 
bodies.

99
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,360
No kidding.
Anyway,

100
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,150
listen,
let me continue because it just goes on

101
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,350
show.
They're interrogating them.

102
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,150
That's Nick Pie.
And there was an alcohol,

103
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:38,490
tobacco and Firearms Agent,
Rick Warren Hankins,

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,970
and because they were concerned about 
that sort of theory that hey,

105
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:45,690
maybe they're out to hit me because I am
the father of the chairman of the board.

106
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,550
Right.
So then Daniel,

107
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:49,600
the son is being interrogated and he 
said they,

108
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,530
they followed me to a town called 
Janesville,

109
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:55,970
Wisconsin where I went shopping and all 
these grocery stores dark.

110
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,980
This is very

111
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,050
detailed.
I'm telling you this is what happened.

112
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:03,170
So I come out and I had bags of grocery 
and it was the summertime.

113
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:08,171
So I had a pocket tee shirt on.
I bent over to put the groceries in the 

114
00:06:08,171 --> 00:06:11,561
car.
I taught myself and was going to fall 

115
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:11,561
out.
I grabbed my left chest.

116
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:15,580
They're looking at me in the van,
which they had been following me and 

117
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,830
they saw me.
The father called his contact and said,

118
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:23,831
listen to.
It looks like the target is having a 

119
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:23,831
heart attack.
What should we do?

120
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:23,831
They refer to me as the target,
right?

121
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:24,580
Oh Jesus,
no shit.

122
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:27,260
And they get a silencer and fucking 2000
rounds of Ammo.

123
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,280
All right.
Okay.

124
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,530
So they called the guy,
Greg said,

125
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:32,660
listen,
let me call you back.

126
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,270
A couple minutes later,
a guy come on the phone,

127
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,870
identified himself as David miscavige 
and he said to them,

128
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:41,150
listen,
if it's his time to die,

129
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,820
let him die.
Don't do anything.

130
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,780
Don't intervene.

131
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,690
That's my son [inaudible].
Alright,

132
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,310
well it didn't just happen,
right?

133
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,120
I mean,
you didn't,

134
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,130
you didn't.
I want,

135
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,270
I don't want to interrupt your story.
You feel like it goes on,

136
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,660
but I mean,
your relationship with your son didn't 

137
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,450
just start there.
So it had to.

138
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,370
It had it go sour.
Who knows shit,

139
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,510
right.
Listen,

140
00:07:04,511 --> 00:07:07,900
my relationship with David when he was a
kid was incredible.

141
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,190
I mean,
we got along great.

142
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,150
He was

143
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,600
a snappy,
a little kid.

144
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,190
He was just very bright,
great sense of humor.

145
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,350
Uh,
just,

146
00:07:16,351 --> 00:07:19,080
I enjoyed his company,
but as he grew older,

147
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:21,390
as you got into scientology,
which I got him in,

148
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:22,920
by the way,
I can get into that.

149
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:27,921
How I got him in.
He then started acquiring power and I 

150
00:07:27,921 --> 00:07:31,800
think he went from Dr.
Jekyll and Mr Hyde as an example,

151
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:35,280
when I worked on staff,
he never referred to me as dad.

152
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,210
He called me run the base that I lived 
on in Hamot.

153
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,650
It got to the point where if you wanted 
to send a letter to somebody,

154
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,770
you had to write the letter,
put it in an unsealed envelope,

155
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,860
two security guards would read it,
see if there anything bad in there that 

156
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,880
I shouldn't be saying,
send it back and I would correct it when

157
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:58,881
it was okay.
Then they sealed the envelope and send 

158
00:07:58,881 --> 00:07:58,881
it out.
If I wanted them to call somebody on the

159
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,380
telephone,
I had to have somebody to listen

160
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,560
on the other extension and this is by 
his orders versus just how scientology 

161
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,320
notch,
not how scientology works it.

162
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:12,890
He is the undisputed dictator of 
scientology,

163
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,670
so this is is Antara doing.
That's the way he wanted it to run 

164
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,190
scientology in 1970 when I got in,
which totally different than what was it

165
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,650
then it was like for a free spirit,
you know,

166
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,890
just very lost a fair,
but you did courses.

167
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:32,980
You could come in and do things that 
would actually improve your ability to 

168
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,300
communicate,
to have better interpersonal relations.

169
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,960
I bought the book,
I bought dianetics and 1994 because I 

170
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,970
moved to California and I was really 
into self help books and stuff like 

171
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:44,970
that.
And I saw one of those,

172
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,760
a late night infomercial ads.
Yeah.

173
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,860
And I was like,
well,

174
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,810
this looks like,
you know,

175
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,210
the reactive mind,
hey,

176
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:53,780
I want to have control of the reactive 
mind and uh,

177
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,680
you know,
I got into it,

178
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:56,100
I read a little bed and I was like,

179
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,650
hm,
probably some good principles in here,

180
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,680
some decent ideas.
And I always associated scientologists 

181
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,300
with being positive people that got a 
lot of things done.

182
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,460
That's a very true statement and I'm 
telling you at what they call the bottom

183
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:16,020
of the bridge because the entire 
scientology experience would be a bridge

184
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:18,990
to total freedom.
You went to reading at a certain point,

185
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,570
you're given basic things,
basic courses,

186
00:09:21,571 --> 00:09:23,610
basic communication skills that you're 
taught.

187
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,330
And I'm telling you,
you go out on the street after you do 

188
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:29,330
this stuff and you're more effective in 
handling life.

189
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:32,330
So the early stages of it,
you feel I need it.

190
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,490
They're very effective.
I mean they were effective then they're 

191
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:37,680
effective today.
If you'll learn the proper communication

192
00:09:37,681 --> 00:09:40,950
formula that will improve your life 
alone.

193
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,320
Sure.
Just communicating correctly,

194
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,630
knowing there's component,
there's parts of it.

195
00:09:45,631 --> 00:09:46,740
It's not just,
hey,

196
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,110
you and the other guy says,
what do you want?

197
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,720
You know,
there's literally get the other person's

198
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:56,721
attention.
Make sure you're giving them a 

199
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,591
communication that he can understand.
You're not going to talk that somebody 

200
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:00,591
in French if he's English,
you know,

201
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:03,570
just all little details that you learn 
and you drilled these.

202
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,000
And then there's other things about,
uh,

203
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,580
interpersonal relationships with your 
wife or a group you'll learn to.

204
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:15,590
You're better off.
So they're essentially telling you how 

205
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:15,750
to be a better person in the beginning.
Yes.

206
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:20,751
And part of that you would then also 
become more positive just simply by 

207
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:21,390
having this,
these skills.

208
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,130
Well this sounds good.
It is good.

209
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,050
Where does it go bad?
Well,

210
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:27,330
here's where it goes bad.
Look,

211
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,370
the further on you get in the.
Let me back up a second.

212
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,040
Let's say you learn the component parts 
of communication and you say,

213
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:41,510
Hey,
you know what?

214
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,980
This is good shit,
right?

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:48,500
You agree to that.
That's the first step on taking you on 

216
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,990
this entire journey and then you may be 
a learn how you can divide your business

217
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,240
into seven parts so that you could 
monitor various parts of it or your life

218
00:10:57,241 --> 00:11:01,050
in the seven parts so you could manage a
how you're doing income wise,

219
00:11:01,051 --> 00:11:06,051
how education is your public relations.
These are all things you can easily 

220
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:10,431
agree to show.
Not a little later on there's a data or 

221
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:11,850
a fact introduced that doesn't quite 
make sense to you,

222
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,290
but you think,
you know what?

223
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,010
Everything they told me it was good so 
far.

224
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,140
I'm just going to accept this now you're
on the road.

225
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,100
Give me an example.

226
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,650
I'm like,
is it like Xenu type shit?

227
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,730
Well,
yeah.

228
00:11:26,731 --> 00:11:29,190
That would be a big example,
but the way down the line,

229
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,480
right?
That's way down the line,

230
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,510
but there's.
There's some early wackiness that gives 

231
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,360
you an indication that things might to 
something.

232
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:37,340
You know?
I think you're right.

233
00:11:37,341 --> 00:11:42,341
I think that's the one where you've 
agreed to so many things so far and all 

234
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:45,870
of the auditing you've gotten that 
that's helped you when it comes to that.

235
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,480
As an example,
when I got on that level,

236
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,640
I thought,
well,

237
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,740
wait a minute.
There's $150.

238
00:11:52,741 --> 00:11:57,741
Billion People on 76 nearby planets,
and they brought them here in spaceships

239
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,920
have,
fuck did to get everybody here.

240
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,220
I looked at it from a physical point of 
view from a point of view of logistics.

241
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,960
It's a lot of spaceships,
but I thought,

242
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,820
well,
I'll accept it.

243
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:14,821
I'll just do it.
One hundred and 50 billion people per 

244
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:14,821
planet.

245
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,410
That was the problem was overpopulation,
but do you see what I'm saying?

246
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,140
So at that point you've agreed to so 
many things that were.

247
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:20,830
Right,
right.

248
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,170
I understand it comes up to that.
You're not going to say,

249
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,690
hey,
you're out of your goddamn mind.

250
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,790
It's helping you give you a direction in
life.

251
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's making you more positive.
It's giving you better communication 

252
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,241
skills.
You have a structure that you could 

253
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:36,241
fall.
When you communicate with people,

254
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,320
it makes you more presentable.
So everything's good in the beginning.

255
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,140
Yeah.
Why doesn't somebody just take that part

256
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,810
and just like get rid of the rest?
Listen,

257
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,960
I tell in my book what we're looking at 
right here,

258
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,810
you know,
rootless scientology,

259
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:53,290
my son David miscavige and me I say at 
the very end if they would,

260
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:56,320
if they were to just to stick to the 
beginning things,

261
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,340
number one and number two have a general
amnesty where they forgive everybody who

262
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:05,320
they think has tried to determine the 
shit's gonna hit the fan,

263
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,620
but maybe at the end of it you'd get 
some people back and knock off the 

264
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:10,620
disconnection policy.

265
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,840
I think if they did that,
it could be one of the best self help 

266
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,781
groups ever.
But once you get up into those upper 

267
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:21,610
levels where they tell you you're going 
to become superhuman as an example,

268
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,490
you will be able to,
as a spiritual being,

269
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:28,420
leave your body and go some other place 
as an example.

270
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,460
And read a newspaper in Germany.
Huh?

271
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:34,030
That it's not like remote viewing.
Yes.

272
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,260
And I'm going to tell you,
Joe,

273
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,470
I was involved for 42 years.
He never went to Germany,

274
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,320
no,
never learned about in Portugal,

275
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,410
but you know,
like a fucking,

276
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:47,430
you know,
seriously though I never met one person 

277
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,270
that has ever achieved that.
Nor did I achieve it.

278
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,570
But you don't talk about it.
I understand.

279
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:56,320
One of the things that say you don't 
talk about your case to somebody else,

280
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,060
so that's compartmentalized.
So everybody who's done this,

281
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:03,130
his thinking and I never got it when 
maybe I'm the only one,

282
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:03,710
right?

283
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,640
So like maybe if I just keep working at 
this one day,

284
00:14:06,641 --> 00:14:11,641
I'm gonna pop through.
That's exactly when you go for the next 

285
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:14,981
slide today,
explain how you're going to do that as 

286
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:15,400
through meditation techniques.
Is it through some sort of hypnosis?

287
00:14:15,401 --> 00:14:20,401
Like how,
how are they supposed to go to Germany 

288
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,020
and read newspaper?
Well out of their body,

289
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,900
there's drills that you,
that you,

290
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,030
they have you do like in the earlier 
what they call ot levels,

291
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,150
operating Phaeton Phaeton his award they
use for spiritual being,

292
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,460
and one of the drills that you would do 
would be spot three objects outside of 

293
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,820
your body spot.
Three objects inside your body spot,

294
00:14:42,821 --> 00:14:45,160
three objects out,
judge your body spot,

295
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:50,161
three objects inside your body on a 
repetitive basis and that's supposed to 

296
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:51,800
let you out.
So is that an example?

297
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:55,880
So it's like a meditation.
So I guess it would be a spot.

298
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,730
Are you saying like envision?
Well,

299
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,330
I mean in the physical universe you 
spots like that Clark,

300
00:15:02,331 --> 00:15:07,331
this book,
and then inside your body just think 

301
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:09,140
about three blocks from and lungs and 
ribs.

302
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,550
Yeah.
Okay.

303
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:15,070
But then the other thing is like when 
you get to ot three and you're talking 

304
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:15,070
about body,
Satan's.

305
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,550
These are the alien beings that were 
brought here,

306
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,120
put on a nearby volcano,
a hydrogen bomb would shut off and they 

307
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:28,020
sent it for,
grabbed these people liquid.

308
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,510
You can look on the Internet and find 
it.

309
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,760
I've read it all unfortunately.
And what happens then is they are all 

310
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,620
latched to your body like a bunch of 
fleas damage and they're affecting your,

311
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,830
your thinking and your personality.
And the ID on these upper levels is to 

312
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:48,560
get rid of all of them and achieved 
this.

313
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Nobody's ever done it.
Like if there were three people who did 

314
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,040
it,
I'd say,

315
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,040
Hey,
you know,

316
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:54,620
maybe it can be right.

317
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,720
Not,
not a fucking one.

318
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,170
Excuse my French buddy.
No,

319
00:15:57,171 --> 00:15:58,280
you can swear away.
Okay,

320
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,500
listen,
I got my doctorate degree and swearing 

321
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:03,500
in the United States Marine Corps.
But you know,

322
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,840
so how did you go from that to this?
How do you go from the Marine Corps,

323
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,150
which is about as real as it gets to 
this?

324
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,730
Well,
you just looking to improve yourself.

325
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:12,400
Yes.
I was always look,

326
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:17,060
listen,
as a little kid in mountain carnival,

327
00:16:17,061 --> 00:16:18,830
Pennsylvania where I was born and 
raised,

328
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:21,700
I used to go up in our Garrett or the 
attic,

329
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,770
whatever you wanna call it and my dad 
had all these books there and I usually 

330
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:28,400
take books off the shelf and read them 
and try to find out about life.

331
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:33,401
I was always looking for something and 
I'm always looking to improve myself or 

332
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,730
find a better way to live.
And I had a friend back in the sixties.

333
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,220
I'm Nelson Sandy.
I'm a musician too.

334
00:16:40,221 --> 00:16:41,520
I don't know whether you knew that.
No,

335
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:42,170
I didn't.
Yeah,

336
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,800
I played professionally my whole life,
Nelson,

337
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:50,801
Sandy,
and also been in the sales business 

338
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,991
because I had four kids and you know,
you gotta pay the bills no matter what 

339
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,510
you do.
So Nelson was a friend of mine and sales

340
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:54,860
in one day he set them,
we run,

341
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,250
how would you like to make an extra 
$100,000

342
00:16:58,251 --> 00:16:59,500
a year?
So what the hell,

343
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,290
you know?
Great.

344
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,620
So he introduced me to something called 
holiday magic.

345
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:08,740
That's a marketing scheme,
you know what I mean by that,

346
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,330
right?
Yeah.

347
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,940
So what scheme pyramid scheme right here
made.

348
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,460
Yeah.
Yeah.

349
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,520
So I went to an opportunity meeting and 
I thought,

350
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:17,810
you know,
maybe I could do this.

351
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,850
So I bought in and I started doing it in
one day.

352
00:17:19,851 --> 00:17:24,410
We're at an opportunity meeting that we 
were running and there's a girl standing

353
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:26,960
next to me talking to a guy over here 
and I'm talking to this guy.

354
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,020
This guy says I'm a scientologist,
I just hang on a second.

355
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:35,260
What is that?
I pinned him down for about a half an 

356
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:35,390
hour and for whatever reason the name 
rang a bell.

357
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:42,130
So he told me that I could go visit 
somebody who was a scientologist and 

358
00:17:42,651 --> 00:17:46,490
they discuss it one day a week guy,
the name of Frank Ogle in Woodbury,

359
00:17:46,491 --> 00:17:48,110
New Jersey.
By the way,

360
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,170
you're from North Jersey,
don't you?

361
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,190
Yeah,
Newark,

362
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:51,030
Newark,
yeah.

363
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Okay.
So I go to this place and he would have 

364
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,190
little classes where he talk about 
communication and various things.

365
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,880
I went there for about four days in a 
month,

366
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,640
like for a month,
one day a week,

367
00:18:05,641 --> 00:18:06,360
and I thought,
okay,

368
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,020
I got it now.

369
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,740
Motor factor here.
David,

370
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,930
when he was born,
he was cursed with an asthma condition.

371
00:18:15,931 --> 00:18:20,931
That was the bane of his existence.
I mean as a little baby sometimes he 

372
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,630
turned blue.
He couldn't read out and it was horrible

373
00:18:24,631 --> 00:18:29,631
to watch this.
And I was the one who took care of that 

374
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:30,810
just about totally.
As matter of fact,

375
00:18:30,811 --> 00:18:35,811
when he would have these attacks,
I would take him to a pediatrician in 

376
00:18:35,811 --> 00:18:36,510
Burlington,
New Jersey called Dr Ziegler.

377
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,100
He'd give them a shot of adrenaline and 
I knew that given a little kid a shot of

378
00:18:41,101 --> 00:18:43,170
adrenaline was not great.
Okay.

379
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,310
So I would try all kinds.
They didn't,

380
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,600
they didn't have inhalers back then they
had inhalers,

381
00:18:48,601 --> 00:18:53,460
but that's handling the symptom,
not the cause.

382
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,660
And I didn't know what to do to handle 
the cause I to the new shit.

383
00:18:57,661 --> 00:19:01,440
Like one winter he's just in a full 
blown attack,

384
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,190
turning blue.

385
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,140
It's cold jersey,
you know,

386
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,730
gold.
Jersey winter.

387
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,730
I took them upstairs to the bathroom,
took off his clothes,

388
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,340
stuck off mine,
stood in the shower,

389
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,540
said David,
I'm not punishing man.

390
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,640
I'm with you.
I had the warm water on it,

391
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:19,650
turned it off.
That water is that coming out of there 

392
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,210
about 34 degrees.
He started breathing,

393
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,750
kicked it,
wiped them down with a Turkish towel 

394
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:26,750
that handled it for the moment.
I used to do shit like that.

395
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,071
Anything to handle them.
So now I found out about scientology 

396
00:19:31,071 --> 00:19:34,050
from this Nelson,
sandy and Frank Ogle was the guy.

397
00:19:34,051 --> 00:19:38,280
I took David Down one day and I said,
is there anything you can do for David?

398
00:19:38,281 --> 00:19:43,281
Would Scientology Auditing,
which is basically another word for 

399
00:19:43,281 --> 00:19:45,801
counseling.
He took David in and 45 minutes later 

400
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,400
dave comes out.
Isaiah was a gun and he says,

401
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:48,330
Dad,
I'm handled,

402
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,230
and he never had another severe attack 
and his entire youth,

403
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,460
he had some possible with communication,
with communication,

404
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:57,480
you can stop asthma.

405
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,650
You come to the point where you have a 
realization maybe where it started or 

406
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,400
how you could be contributing to it or 
maybe where it starts kicking in old.

407
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,450
Was He when you brought them in there?
I guess this was using about nine years 

408
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:11,450
old.
Wow.

409
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,650
Okay.
So like what?

410
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,870
What tools did they use to help him kick
asthma?

411
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,220
That communication,
that just communication like,

412
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:20,820
hi,
what's,

413
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:21,690
what's,
what's going on?

414
00:20:21,691 --> 00:20:26,691
He got asthma.
What communication do you mean by 

415
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:26,691
communication?
Okay.

416
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,060
He did you use what's called the 
creative processing,

417
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,240
which is something that they used to use
and what it is is you figure out how you

418
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:40,251
could be contributing to that and then 
you do a mental image picture of 

419
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:45,531
something that you think you're doing to
contribute to that and back and forth.

420
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:51,160
It's a little for me to try to explain 
it in a little session like this.

421
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,500
It's a little hard because.
Well,

422
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,350
it's a little hard to understand,
but if it did work on him,

423
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,500
so you're saying in some sense asthma 
may be psychosomatic and maybe in your 

424
00:21:01,781 --> 00:21:04,810
head for him it was to that degree.
Yes,

425
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,740
I am saying never got asthma again.
He never had a severe attack again.

426
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,670
He had my minor attacks,
but he was able to stop them with these.

427
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,580
He used to get so bad that it would 
debilitate them.

428
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:19,810
I mean,
he was out of school for a week one time

429
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,640
with an attack.
This is before we,

430
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,850
I ever took him to see Frank Ogle and 
um,

431
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:32,730
that impressed me.
The fact that this handle that for the 

432
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:32,730
moment.
Anyway,

433
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,950
so with that and some other things,
I decided I'm going to get my whole 

434
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,870
family and scientology because it look 
his whole life.

435
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,810
That was a problem for me to handle and 
this,

436
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:48,960
at least at that moment,
got into the point where he was like in 

437
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,390
charge of it.

438
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,530
It didn't happen to them again.
That severe.

439
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,350
Does that make sense?
It doesn't make sense.

440
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:59,351
Yeah.
So that's what persuaded you to begin 

441
00:21:59,351 --> 00:21:59,950
quite a bit.
So everything was good for awhile.

442
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,240
Right.
I got in.

443
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:05,560
I'll tell you how good it was.
I got in and my whole family got in.

444
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,890
I decided to take my whole family to 
England and in 1972 I moved there for a 

445
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:15,871
year and three months and it had the 
whole family studies scientology in 

446
00:22:15,871 --> 00:22:15,871
England.
Yeah.

447
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,180
Yeah.
And then came back for a little while 

448
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,370
and went over again in 1974 a study more
scientology when I was there that time I

449
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:29,881
got a recording deal with the polydore 
company solo album and I got a writer's 

450
00:22:30,071 --> 00:22:35,071
contract with the chapels publishing and
I got asked to plan BBC to all is in a 

451
00:22:35,071 --> 00:22:35,110
book.
By the way,

452
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:35,870
I'll give you the details.

453
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,610
This was all while l Ron Hubbard was 
alive while he was alive.

454
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,170
And you meet him.
Never met him.

455
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,850
No.
But your son did listen to my son joined

456
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:47,980
the sea organization when he was 16 
years old.

457
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,620
Within seven months he was working with 
l,

458
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:51,780
Ron Hubbard.
What is this?

459
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,450
The sea organization is explaining that 
to people.

460
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:00,630
Okay.
There are several different ways that 

461
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:03,100
you could do scientology.
The number one way would be as if you're

462
00:23:03,101 --> 00:23:07,420
a public person and you just go into an 
organization there called orgs.

463
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,280
You go in and you buy services,
but you live in the outside world.

464
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,320
You have a job,
you have a home,

465
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:17,350
you know all these things,
but you pay for a service.

466
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:23,190
That's number one.
Another level would be that you worked 

467
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,550
for an organization and you could sign a
two and a half year or a five year 

468
00:23:26,951 --> 00:23:31,180
contract to work there and you get to a 
billion year contracts to,

469
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,530
well now what you're getting ahead of 
it.

470
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,090
That's public,
that,

471
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,180
that's working for an organization on 
the level of a two and a half or five 

472
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:45,421
year contract.
The last step would be the sea 

473
00:23:45,421 --> 00:23:46,200
organization.
There you sign billion year contract.

474
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,280
In other words,
you're signing away your future lives to

475
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,040
get this scientology disseminated.

476
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,510
Um,
has anybody ever challenged one of those

477
00:23:55,511 --> 00:23:59,110
billion year contracts?
Like what does it mean?

478
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,200
Like do you listen to you?
You're getting the skinny and as hard as

479
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:10,180
this is to believe,
once you're in it for awhile and you see

480
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,670
that this is helping you and maybe your 
family,

481
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:16,960
the point of is that they want to get 
this disseminated to every man,

482
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:19,750
woman,
and child on the planet and improve life

483
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:24,751
for everybody.
So it's like you're on this crusade to 

484
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:28,471
get it disseminated.
So they believe they're doing this to 

485
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:28,471
help people.
Yes.

486
00:24:28,471 --> 00:24:28,670
It all sounds good,
right?

487
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,100
All sounds good in the beginning.
Well,

488
00:24:30,101 --> 00:24:32,440
it reads better than the lips.
It's not that way at all.

489
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,820
What will,
how is it?

490
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,860
How is it?
I'll tell you these days right now,

491
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,780
like,
sure.

492
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,580
They get people to donate money to 
what's called the International 

493
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,460
Association of scientologists or donate 
money to build an organization,

494
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,390
build a new church someplace and it give
you a piece of paper and commend you.

495
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,890
You know,
it's a nice business,

496
00:24:53,891 --> 00:24:54,820
low overhead,
you know,

497
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,100
so you give them money,
they give you paper,

498
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,410
they gave you a commendation or saying 
you're the devil,

499
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,170
right?
You're,

500
00:25:02,171 --> 00:25:03,250
you're,
you've achieved.

501
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,230
The thing is,
look,

502
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,730
they've opened a lot of new buildings,
but Joe,

503
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,280
there's not people in air.
There's air,

504
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,350
okay,
but they say we're expanding.

505
00:25:11,351 --> 00:25:13,120
They're expanding the real estate 
interest,

506
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,330
but they're not expanding.
The number of people in scientology was 

507
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:18,330
a,
well,

508
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,681
if you go on the Internet,
you can find out all the abuses they've 

509
00:25:22,681 --> 00:25:25,681
done,
like people going bankrupt because they 

510
00:25:25,681 --> 00:25:28,201
had to contribute so much money that you
get a second and third mortgage on her 

511
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:28,201
house,
give it to the church.

512
00:25:28,201 --> 00:25:30,190
They can't afford it after they've 
declared bankruptcy.

513
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,680
People being disconnected from their 
families.

514
00:25:32,681 --> 00:25:33,640
That.
Let's talk about that.

515
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Bill.
I want to go back to the sea org thing 

516
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:38,960
for a second,
but then let's talk about that.

517
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,840
Yeah,
so the sea org thing is your son joins 

518
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:42,840
the sea org when he's 16 years old.
Here's what happened.

519
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:48,030
I came home from work one day and he's 
laying on his in his room on his bed,

520
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,720
kind of like that with his head in his 
hands as they day.

521
00:25:51,721 --> 00:25:53,380
What's up man?
He says,

522
00:25:53,381 --> 00:25:58,381
Daddy,
I don't want to go to school anymore is 

523
00:25:58,381 --> 00:25:58,381
why not?
He said,

524
00:25:58,381 --> 00:25:58,750
listen,
all the kids are taking drugs,

525
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:03,780
they just,
they don't show the teachers any 

526
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,471
respect.
They're not willing to learn anything I 

527
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:07,471
want.
I want to join this year.

528
00:26:07,471 --> 00:26:11,050
I want to help l Ron Hubbard because by 
this time we've been to England twice.

529
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,560
He's trained to be an auditor.
An auditor is a person who applies this 

530
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,510
technology of scientology in auditing or
counseling.

531
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:21,170
Okay.
And he said,

532
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,010
this is what I want to do.
I thought to myself,

533
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:26,080
he's 15,
he's going to be 16.

534
00:26:26,081 --> 00:26:28,420
Shortly after that.
Look,

535
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,150
when I was 17,
I joined the marines.

536
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,320
My Dad had assigned for me because I was
only 17 and it probably was one of the 

537
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,170
best moves I ever made.
I mean,

538
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,470
the first night in bootcamp,
I said to myself,

539
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,250
this is the worst fucking mistake ever 
made in my life.

540
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,760
At that moment,
12 weeks later,

541
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,330
I said to myself,
I can make myself do anything,

542
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,220
and in that 12 weeks it turned me from 
an undisciplined civilian into a 

543
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,190
discipline marine and I've utilized 
that.

544
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,450
My whole life has helped me always.
I kind of looked at that and I thought,

545
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,460
well,
I was 17,

546
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,160
maybe it looked like I didn't know what 
the hell I was doing,

547
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:12,690
but I come out of winter and if David 
wants to do this and what is he going to

548
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:16,320
get out of going to school and he has no
desire to do anything else.

549
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,130
I said,
okay,

550
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,500
I'll help you.
So that was it.

551
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:23,460
So when he was 16,
the next day we put them on a plane.

552
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:26,660
He went down to the flag land base in 
Florida and they say,

553
00:27:26,661 --> 00:27:28,050
well then I think it was seven or eight 
months,

554
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:31,500
he was working right with l Ron Hubbard,
fornia the sea org.

555
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,780
Like,
is it a boat you're actually on a boat?

556
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,880
No,
the sea organization is a term used 

557
00:27:39,511 --> 00:27:44,511
because in 1967,
ron started what he called the sea 

558
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:50,121
project where he bought these,
the ship and invited people to come with

559
00:27:50,551 --> 00:27:55,551
him to contribute to this project saying
that his research could be done better 

560
00:27:57,931 --> 00:28:00,190
away from land masses.
I mean,

561
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,820
in fact the law was after him,
you know that,

562
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,020
right?
It was a tax thing,

563
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:04,830
right?
Yeah,

564
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:09,831
I mean they,
they were trying to snag them and when 

565
00:28:09,831 --> 00:28:10,830
you're out out in international waters,
they can serve you a subpoena,

566
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,710
but it was such an adventure story.

567
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,040
Right.
And people look over,

568
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,790
look at plus to get to where it 
captain's outfit.

569
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,380
No,
not everybody.

570
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,000
He goes,
Oh yeah,

571
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:24,660
admiral.
He give himself metals l,

572
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,710
Ron Hubbard.
Yeah.

573
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,270
You know,
I never saw that.

574
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,490
All I saw was that he was considered the
commodore,

575
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,060
but you remember the Peace Corps?
Yes.

576
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:38,350
All right.
That was an adventure and people would 

577
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:38,350
go on our,
but they actually were doing something.

578
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,270
Now.
What was the sea org doing?

579
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:42,390
Well,
the CEO was on this ship and they'd have

580
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:44,610
people come there for advanced level 
services,

581
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,120
get that and uh,
they would send missions out to various 

582
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:54,771
organizations to correct any out indices
in the way maybe they were delivering 

583
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:57,210
the technology or,
or fix something that was going wrong.

584
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:02,390
It was run like a military organization.
And then the sea org went ashore and 

585
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:07,260
they established the flag land base in 
clearwater,

586
00:29:07,261 --> 00:29:07,680
Florida.

587
00:29:09,630 --> 00:29:14,500
So that is still referred to as flag.
Yet,

588
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:19,740
when El Rey to Lr and Hubbard had the 
ships that was going to consider the 

589
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:19,740
flagship.
Okay.

590
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,060
Am I filling you in an definition?
So he joined that.

591
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,860
He ascended through the ranks.
He's working with l,

592
00:29:25,861 --> 00:29:27,630
Ron Hubbard,
and slowly.

593
00:29:27,631 --> 00:29:29,460
You guys get disconnected.
Is that what happens?

594
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,630
No,
as matter of fact,

595
00:29:30,631 --> 00:29:33,630
when he was doing that,
we were still in very good communication

596
00:29:33,631 --> 00:29:36,390
with each other like I'm telling you 
something.

597
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,260
We had a lot of great times together 
when he was growing up.

598
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:45,390
It no two ways about it and I can't say 
that it was like bad relationship in any

599
00:29:45,791 --> 00:29:46,120
way.

600
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,100
There was a guy by the name of Lord 
Acton.

601
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,730
He was a Britisher.
He was a member of parliament.

602
00:29:54,731 --> 00:29:59,731
He lived from 1834 to early 19 hundreds.
He's the one that made the observation.

603
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,410
Power tends to corrupt and absolute 
power corrupts.

604
00:30:05,411 --> 00:30:10,411
Absolutely,
and I think this is what happened to 

605
00:30:10,411 --> 00:30:11,800
David,
that when l Ron Hubbard died,

606
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,490
he saw a chance to move up and you got 
people out of the way who didn't want to

607
00:30:19,001 --> 00:30:24,001
cooperate.
Him Put people on various posts that 

608
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:25,810
would cooperate with them and he took 
over the ownership and the leadership of

609
00:30:25,811 --> 00:30:30,811
scientology and what contributed to that
was an incident where he had a severe 

610
00:30:31,391 --> 00:30:35,590
asthmatic attack and they had to take 
him to the emergency room of a hospital.

611
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:40,950
Paul Grady's a guy that took him there 
and when Paul pick them up after they 

612
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:43,420
did the stuff that the handle him,
he was okay.

613
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,880
They would set the Paul.
Listen,

614
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,660
I had a great realization when I was 
there and it's this power is not 

615
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,440
granted.
It is assumed.

616
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:58,780
So he assumed the leadership of 
scientology and heroes right to the top.

617
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,410
That's how that happened.
So how did you get disconnected from 

618
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:04,420
them?
Well,

619
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:09,930
look,
there was an event that he had none of 

620
00:31:09,931 --> 00:31:11,110
the event.
There's something that he did,

621
00:31:11,111 --> 00:31:16,111
which he'll always be admired for.
He got actually got the Church of 

622
00:31:16,111 --> 00:31:18,340
scientology tax exemption.
Alright.

623
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:24,030
He literally got the irs to grant the 
fact that this is a church you have now 

624
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,900
a tax exemption.
People contribute to it,

625
00:31:25,901 --> 00:31:29,140
can you deduct it?
That was a very,

626
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:32,620
very big win that then gave him power.
Okay.

627
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,060
I decided to join this organization in 
1985.

628
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,000
I wanted to contribute to doing whatever
I could to help him.

629
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,670
I joined the Sea Organization and I'm at
the Hamate base,

630
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,720
you know,
I'm coming out of the music studio 

631
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,091
because since I was a musician,
I worked in the music studio and we did 

632
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:54,091
films.

633
00:31:54,091 --> 00:31:57,990
I'd composed music for various technical
films we had or public relations films 

634
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:03,150
and I walked out of the studio one day 
and I saw him a little distance off the 

635
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,510
left with an entourage and I yelled out,
hey dave.

636
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,350
And he turned around and he looked at me
and I'm telling you,

637
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:13,351
Joe,
he gave me a look that I thought I 

638
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:15,481
better never do that again.
On that base I was then a staff member.

639
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:22,970
The fact that I was biologically his 
father and in fact his father,

640
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,120
he,
he referred to me as Ron when he spoke 

641
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,301
to me.
When he sent me a gift for my birthday 

642
00:32:30,301 --> 00:32:30,301
or Christmas or something.
He always had their dad,

643
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:34,810
but that was the beginning.
Now with further on down the road we got

644
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,260
the more it became,
I used to have to call him after a 

645
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:40,720
while.
Okay.

646
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:44,570
It became more and more me,
Ron Miscavige,

647
00:32:44,571 --> 00:32:47,900
the staff member,
and David is the leader of the church.

648
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:54,100
Once they started implementing the rules
at the base where you couldn't send a 

649
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:58,241
letter,
I without being checked where you 

650
00:32:58,241 --> 00:33:00,880
surrounded with barb wire pointing and 
pointing out you couldn't talk on the 

651
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,280
telephone without having somebody 
listen.

652
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,580
You couldn't drive off on your own to go
to a store to get a fucking pair of 

653
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,730
underwear.
You had to order it on the Internet.

654
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,690
If you got on the Internet,
there was a filter on it.

655
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,060
Were anything about miscavige for 
scientology?

656
00:33:14,061 --> 00:33:15,080
Come up,
you'd be blocked.

657
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,450
So now I'm living a sequestered life.
Waking up in the morning,

658
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,510
going to breakfast at 9:00,
9:30.

659
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,790
Having a muster,
you know to muster is no.

660
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,160
Okay?
You line up your account for everybody.

661
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:30,800
Alright?
Twelve o'clock,

662
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:34,430
go to lunch.
12 30 lineup for another muster.

663
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,190
Go to work in the afternoon,
5:00,

664
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:38,660
go to dinner,
5:30,

665
00:33:38,661 --> 00:33:41,240
go to another muster.
And then work the rest of the night,

666
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,370
or sometimes 9:30
or 10:00,

667
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,400
have another muster.
That was my life seven days a week,

668
00:33:46,401 --> 00:33:51,401
except on Saturday.
You'd work on the grounds to beautify 

669
00:33:51,401 --> 00:33:52,520
the base.
Doesn't sound good time,

670
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:54,350
Ron.
It's a great existence.

671
00:33:54,351 --> 00:33:58,040
Joe,
how would you like to live that way?

672
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,230
That doesn't sound good.
It wasn't good.

673
00:34:00,231 --> 00:34:02,150
Stuck.
Well,

674
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,450
here's the thing.
There were enough times when I did 

675
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:12,341
things that were good,
like we would do an album and it was a 

676
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,250
matter of fact.
Here's something that we didn't.

677
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,020
I first got in and there was a book that
came out called mission earth that l Ron

678
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:23,020
Hubbard wrote Edgar.
When you remember Edgar Winter Know 

679
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
Edgar Winter.
Johnny winters brother?

680
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,610
Yes.
She musician the musician.

681
00:34:25,611 --> 00:34:26,450
The Rock Guy?
Yeah.

682
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,090
Okay.

683
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,420
Edgar came to the base and we did an 
album.

684
00:34:29,421 --> 00:34:33,830
I played on the album with him.
Edgar winter just scientology was.

685
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,790
He probably still is.
Wow.

686
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,040
One of them's dead,
right?

687
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,350
John said Johnny's dead.
But Edgar,

688
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:45,100
I mean he was.
You have no idea how good he is until 

689
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,110
you see them operating a studio.
Anyway,

690
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,650
I played the trumpet parts on the album,
I played solos and some of this stuff,

691
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,920
the album,
that was what I did and it was great 

692
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:53,920
time.
Bust your ass working,

693
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,360
but that's a good time,
right Isaac Hayes.

694
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:59,660
I used to do gigs with him,
you know,

695
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:03,830
chase's great guy and those,
those were fun times.

696
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:06,170
There were other things that we did that
turned out good,

697
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,890
but then there's time in between where 
you're working sometimes days on end 

698
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,070
with when the okay a couple of days,
no sleep,

699
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:18,880
working your ass off and if you screwed 
up it was hell to pay and kind of work 

700
00:35:19,191 --> 00:35:19,850
is being done.

701
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,380
What does all the work.
Okay.

702
00:35:21,381 --> 00:35:26,381
I'll give you an example.
There's about six major events that are 

703
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:29,550
done by the church every year.
There's the a.

704
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,780
In new years there's a major event.
Okay.

705
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,620
And then in March you have l,
Ron Hubbard birthday and then in May you

706
00:35:39,061 --> 00:35:40,940
have dianetics.
Alright guys,

707
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,480
what do you guys do for Ellen's 
birthday?

708
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,270
Well,
there would be any event where you would

709
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,260
show him in various aspects of life,
improving life in some aspect and we'd 

710
00:35:51,381 --> 00:35:54,420
have a video on that and we would have 
to write music for that.

711
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,760
A city would have to shoot the pictures 
or take old pictures and produce these,

712
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:04,761
edit them.
We do music for it and we'd have a 

713
00:36:04,761 --> 00:36:07,581
product to.
I had an event when David's the one 

714
00:36:07,581 --> 00:36:09,591
event,
they could present this for when the 

715
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,460
anniversary of dianetics modern science 
of mental health.

716
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:12,330
That was another event.

717
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,580
Okay,
and then in your preparing for events,

718
00:36:14,581 --> 00:36:17,250
essentially all the time it was when 
you'd end one,

719
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,280
you'd have start the next one in June 
you have the anniversary of the maiden 

720
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,000
voyage.
That was something we did every year and

721
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:26,580
then there's auditor's Day in August.
All right,

722
00:36:26,581 --> 00:36:31,581
and then there's the international 
association of Scientology Event in 

723
00:36:31,581 --> 00:36:34,851
October.
So all this time you're just constantly 

724
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:34,851
working.
You're never hanging out with your son.

725
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:38,871
You don't.
You don't have any quality time 

726
00:36:38,871 --> 00:36:40,551
together.
Sometimes he would come to the base for 

727
00:36:40,551 --> 00:36:40,551
two months and wouldn't even give me a 
phone call.

728
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:42,500
Look,
Joe,

729
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,510
you got to understand,
I wish the fuck this didn't turn out 

730
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:47,510
this way.
Okay.

731
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:50,630
Just straight up.
So I will feel responsible in any way 

732
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:50,850
for bringing them in.

733
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:58,310
Well,
everybody deals with life the way they 

734
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,131
deal with it.
My other son isn't that way in my 

735
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:01,131
daughters aren't that way,
but it is your other son.

736
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:03,180
Scientology as well.
He's on a scientology now.

737
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,460
Did he quit with you?
He quit earlier than me.

738
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,380
And what about your daughters?
They're in.

739
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,760
They're in,
yes.

740
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:12,030
And if they were connected from them,
they're disconnected from me.

741
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,000
Right.
You're not allowed to.

742
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,630
They're not allowed to talk to you.
Here's what happens though.

743
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:20,660
If they were to talk to me,
they're friends would disconnect from 

744
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:23,901
them.
If you have a job with the scientology 

745
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:23,901
employer and they found out that you 
talked to me,

746
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:27,450
he would get fired that day.
It's insidious.

747
00:37:27,451 --> 00:37:32,280
It spreads out the penalty for talking 
to what's called a suppressive person,

748
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:36,930
which would be me like real life prick.
As an example,

749
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:42,230
when I was 70 years old,
David and my two daughters bought me a 

750
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,230
car.

751
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,980
Okay.
A car,

752
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:47,940
when I was 75 years old,
my daughter sent me 75 gifts.

753
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:53,690
Now I left.
Now I'm the worst father who's ever 

754
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:53,690
lived.
I'm a slimeball.

755
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,400
They character assassinate me and their 
hate sites.

756
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,460
They would give a card to somebody who 
was that bad.

757
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,570
Oh,
we made a mistake.

758
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:01,920
He really was a prick.
All the along.

759
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:06,030
It doesn't make sense,
so if you're trying to make sense out of

760
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:07,080
it,
it doesn't make sense.

761
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,870
But this is built into the policy of 
scientology.

762
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,900
Anybody who leaves could be in says 
anything about the church could be 

763
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:20,061
considered to be a suppressive person.
And was this always the case or is this 

764
00:38:20,061 --> 00:38:21,420
Polish exacerbated?
Well,

765
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,610
l Ron Hubbard wrote the policies while 
he was alive.

766
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,060
He also wrote more fiction than anybody 
that's ever lived.

767
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,120
Yeah.
Does everybody know that inside the 

768
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,120
church?
Uh,

769
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:32,460
they probably do.
Yeah.

770
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:35,740
But didn't they?
Does anybody make that connection?

771
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:36,110
No.

772
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,060
No.
The guy wrote more fake shit than any 

773
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,430
person that's ever walked the face of 
the earth.

774
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,320
But he also had the time to talk to the 
aliens to get all this data.

775
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,520
Yeah.
To write this real stuff that is just,

776
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,360
that is a,
that's,

777
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,410
that's a suspension of disbelief that 
defies logic.

778
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:03,490
Well,
as fries defies understanding,

779
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:07,030
as you said earlier,
just need to get to a higher otc.

780
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:11,040
What is it that it Ota level.
Operating level.

781
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:16,060
Okay.
But you got to understand most people 

782
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:18,010
who do it don't have rocks in your head.
They're not nuts.

783
00:39:18,011 --> 00:39:19,670
They're not stupid.
People know I've talked.

784
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,300
I had a neighbor who was a 
scientologist,

785
00:39:21,301 --> 00:39:22,550
a very nice guy.
Yeah.

786
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,080
And he sort of fit that bill that I was 
talking to get it earlier,

787
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:31,130
but he fit that bill that I was talking 
about earlier where he's a guy that's 

788
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:31,660
always improving himself.

789
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,680
He was healthy exercise dbs.
Well captiva was a nice neighbor.

790
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,950
It was a good guy.
And uh,

791
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,510
you know,
I was like,

792
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,160
all right.
I,

793
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:44,800
I sort of looked into scientology after 
I became friends with him,

794
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,140
you know,
I mean,

795
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,510
I got the book early on,
like I said,

796
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:51,550
but I never really did anything other 
than read the book.

797
00:39:51,551 --> 00:39:54,760
I never looked into.
This is before the Internet,

798
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:59,870
you know,
the internet sort of exposed all this 

799
00:39:59,870 --> 00:39:59,870
stuff.
So that was the end of it.

800
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:04,260
That literal use literally and tall.
And how much has it dropped off since 

801
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:04,260
then?
Well,

802
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,200
it's been estimated by people who would 
know that there's maybe 20,000

803
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:10,660
scientologists right now.
What was it at its peak?

804
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:12,540
I think it was in the early 90 
[inaudible].

805
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:14,230
About 100,000.
Wow.

806
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,880
Yeah,
20,000.

807
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,210
That's like a,
a good Louis ck concert.

808
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:25,290
Well,
the thing is most people I get that 

809
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:28,930
international base are people who have 
been around for 25,

810
00:40:28,931 --> 00:40:29,710
30,
35,

811
00:40:29,711 --> 00:40:30,400
40 years.

812
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,830
And you think,
okay,

813
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:35,020
how could you live this way?
Look,

814
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:36,550
most people are not going to do what I 
do.

815
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,550
I was [inaudible] 76 years old when I 
left.

816
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,700
Okay.
And you were 75 when they gave you 75 

817
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:44,700
gifts.
So you like this?

818
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,520
Not Enough.
I've got to get the fuck out of here.

819
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,900
I need.
No,

820
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,840
you mean not enough gifts?
I didn't get in [inaudible] 76.

821
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:52,080
Right.
Listen,

822
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:57,170
I always did.
Well actually I'll tell you something 

823
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,150
that happened and I brought this just to
show you and you'll have a little.

824
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,800
What is that?
Kindle.

825
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:02,350
Okay.
Are you allowed to have those in there?

826
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,420
No.
Really,

827
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,910
you can't have a kindle and I didn't 
know why.

828
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,990
I didn't know why.
What happened is David gave me this 

829
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:17,290
Kendall and the security guards were 
doing.

830
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,150
They're not trying to get it away from 
me,

831
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:24,310
but they wouldn't come and strong army 
because David is the man.

832
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:29,490
So David gave it to you in the security 
guards are trying to take it away from 

833
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:29,490
you.
Why?

834
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,490
Okay.
I didn't know.

835
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Did you tell them?
It was loaded up with l Ron Hubbard 

836
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:35,520
books where it was.

837
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,050
It was just fiction books that he put in
your family field earth?

838
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,480
No,
not battlefield or northern Michigan 

839
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:43,480
missionary,
but the other earlier fiction,

840
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,230
which I thought was pretty interesting,
but anyway,

841
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,090
they're trying to get the says,
Hey,

842
00:41:47,091 --> 00:41:48,560
fuck you man.
Dave gave me.

843
00:41:48,561 --> 00:41:49,610
This is mine,
you know?

844
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,390
Oh,
okay.

845
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:52,700
Rhonda did back off.
Now,

846
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:57,701
one day I'm reading something and 
there's a feature on here where you see 

847
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:00,410
this is the camera on that?
No.

848
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:02,720
Okay.
You see this little

849
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,990
switch that goes this way,
this way up,

850
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:14,310
down and in.
So if you got a word that you'd like to 

851
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:19,301
look up and get the meaning of,
you'd go to the library or not the 

852
00:42:19,301 --> 00:42:19,880
library,
the dictionary,

853
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:25,540
and you'd select the award and pressure 
to the right and it would say search 

854
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:30,730
store.
I accidentally held it a little bit too 

855
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,440
long and it went right past search store
to google.

856
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:38,570
I was on the Internet.
Will no filter with your kindle,

857
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,190
my kindle.
I.

858
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:45,191
What the fuck is this even know about 
the Google back then I knew about the 

859
00:42:45,191 --> 00:42:49,340
google,
but there was filter on a computer.

860
00:42:49,341 --> 00:42:51,800
Go through it with.
There's no filter on this.

861
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:55,430
That's why the security guards were 
trying to get it,

862
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,460
but they wouldn't tell me that.
Obviously they're not going to say,

863
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:03,461
well,
there's no filter so you can get on the 

864
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:03,461
Internet.

865
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:05,320
I mean these guys weren't that swift.
There aren't the sharpest knives in the 

866
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:05,320
drawer,
but.

867
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,220
But how did they know that?
How they know about that?

868
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:12,600
They're the ones who,
if you get a computer that you give it 

869
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:15,161
to them,
they put a filter on it and then I give 

870
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:15,161
it back to you.
Okay.

871
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:15,161
So they just know they've got some 
techno geeks do.

872
00:43:15,161 --> 00:43:19,931
I don't know how to do that shit,
but they had never done that to the 

873
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:19,931
kindle.
But they wanted to go.

874
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:24,761
They wanted to take it away from me.
Straight up googling stuff with your 

875
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:24,761
kindle.
I looked at Google now,

876
00:43:24,761 --> 00:43:29,630
uh,
the first time I've told that story 

877
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:31,830
about Joseph an exclusive UNICO.
Excited.

878
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,050
Yeah.
Well,

879
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:37,220
I'll tell you one of the things I looked
at as like l Ron Hubbard's war record.

880
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,870
He was not a hero.

881
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:43,610
You didn't have two purple hearts.
He's fucking made up story.

882
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:49,780
And there was a girl named Annie Tillman
who was with l Ron Hubbard when he died.

883
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,760
And tinman was a messenger with l Ron 
Hubbard since she was a little girl and 

884
00:43:57,681 --> 00:44:02,681
she was with him when he actually died.
So Annie was a long term loyal 

885
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:09,071
scientologists.
She's at the base where I lived in 

886
00:44:09,071 --> 00:44:12,761
Hamilton and she got lung cancer,
so they sent her to Los Angeles to get 

887
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:18,401
care and they sent a girl down to be 
like a personal servant to take care of 

888
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:19,370
her needs,
so she'd be okay.

889
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,260
So occasionally I would say to Martin 
who was the medical liaison officer.

890
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:30,430
In other words,
she took care of our health and she'd 

891
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,430
have us go to the doctors and stuff.
I said,

892
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:30,770
Martin,
how's Andy Doing?

893
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,590
Ohhh,
Ronnie.

894
00:44:31,591 --> 00:44:32,700
She's doing a great.
Yeah.

895
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:33,480
Okay,
good.

896
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,800
I'm on a kindle.
She died six months earlier,

897
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:44,180
never told anybody innovation.
Now we're living in these apartments on 

898
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:44,460
the base.
Is it?

899
00:44:44,461 --> 00:44:49,461
Several days later and there was a 
building called the laundry room where 

900
00:44:49,461 --> 00:44:51,540
you took your clothes to get cleaned and
pressed.

901
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:56,541
You picked up sheets,
little Amenia ds like that and there's 

902
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:57,420
two girls outside the laundry room and 
he said,

903
00:44:57,421 --> 00:44:59,340
Ronnie,
would you want to chip in for a birthday

904
00:44:59,341 --> 00:45:02,160
present for Annie?
I said,

905
00:45:02,161 --> 00:45:03,480
Nah,
I'm gonna Patch on it now.

906
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,760
Had Jesus Christ.
They either know and they're keeping up 

907
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:12,411
the ruse or they don't know and they're 
being used as she was shields to make 

908
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:21,501
sure,
make sure people think she's still 

909
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:21,501
alive.
Right.

910
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:21,501
Well,
that was a major thing for me.

911
00:45:21,501 --> 00:45:23,850
I then started to think I gotta get 
Outta here.

912
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:29,420
Mind you.
I thought earlier things were starting 

913
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:31,920
to go south and we would have.
I give you an example.

914
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:37,460
Here's what happened.
We're on the ship and we're playing for 

915
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:41,300
a show at one of these maiden voyages 
anniversary things and we have a guy 

916
00:45:42,661 --> 00:45:47,661
there who is not a rap artist,
but he's like a beat box,

917
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:49,380
you know,
you know,

918
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,290
he uses voice like that,
you know,

919
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,590
so now doug is up there and then you 
start saying,

920
00:45:55,591 --> 00:45:56,220
you know,
he says,

921
00:45:56,221 --> 00:46:01,221
I'll tell you,
my kid was picked up by the cops 

922
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:01,221
yesterday day,
but he's not really a bad kid.

923
00:46:01,221 --> 00:46:02,640
You know,
he's hanging out with the wrong guys and

924
00:46:02,641 --> 00:46:03,400
blah,
blah blah.

925
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:08,660
And these are all saying the shit that 
you don't say to this exclusive 

926
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,360
audience.
David hears that to handle this.

927
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:16,590
Me and the rest of the band were sent to
work in the bilge on the ship

928
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,480
because he fucked up.
We paid the price.

929
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:24,560
What I should've done was kicked into 
band because I was directing the band,

930
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,640
kicked into band and start playing music
and drowned them out.

931
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,960
You're going to build the temperature 
down there is between $125.

932
00:46:32,961 --> 00:46:35,660
One hundred and 30 degrees.
I'm in my sixties.

933
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:39,920
Doesn't matter.
Shit like that would go on.

934
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,410
So when things like that,
what happened at that?

935
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:43,640
Man,
we can't live this way,

936
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:46,790
but my wife Becky,
she is an eternal optimist.

937
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,870
She would always say run.
It's gonna.

938
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:50,930
Get better.
It can't keep on going this way.

939
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:56,650
And I'd say becky listening because she 
a boulder rolling down a mountain that 

940
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:58,400
boulder is not going to stop and start 
rolling up.

941
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,400
It's going to get worse.
If things are going bad,

942
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:03,590
they have a tendency to continue going 
bad.

943
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:09,070
It's just fantastic to me that you found
out all this information on Google.

944
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,050
Yeah.
And that you were shielded from all this

945
00:47:12,051 --> 00:47:12,680
stuff.
Yeah.

946
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,020
That's.
That's the craziest part.

947
00:47:15,021 --> 00:47:16,880
And you,
you were 75 at the time,

948
00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:20,530
somewhere in that ruined our vision at 
them.

949
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:23,030
I think it was two years later that we 
actually escaped.

950
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,460
So how did you escape?
Well,

951
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:30,461
first of all,
I used to run the music department and 

952
00:47:32,050 --> 00:47:37,050
when I say run it and I'd make sure that
we did all the jobs were supposed to do 

953
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,890
and I would compose music.
I worked with a guy by the name of Peter

954
00:47:38,891 --> 00:47:41,690
[inaudible] and uh,
we,

955
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,930
we had some nice shit that we did 
together.

956
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,240
So at this point you'd been in for how 
many years?

957
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:47,260
Forty years?
No.

958
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:52,290
No.
Industry Organization over 20 some 

959
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:54,451
years.
Twenty something years in the sea 

960
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:54,451
organization.
All in all.

961
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:54,451
Scientology.
Much more than that.

962
00:47:54,451 --> 00:47:57,250
Yeah.
Well I was in scientology for 42 years.

963
00:47:57,251 --> 00:47:59,200
This is your only source of income?

964
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:00,760
Yeah,
it's 50.

965
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:01,660
Well,
to begin with,

966
00:48:01,661 --> 00:48:04,210
when I got in,
we got 30 bucks a week.

967
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,290
And then journalists.
What's that generous?

968
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,970
When it went up to 15 year olds,
when you got paid,

969
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:18,390
when you get paid,
sometimes you'd go for months without 

970
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:22,501
getting paid at all.
Now the downside of that is you ain't 

971
00:48:22,501 --> 00:48:26,281
paying much into social security,
so if you leave like some of these 

972
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:27,010
people will leave.
They got shit for social security.

973
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:29,050
They may have no,
no place to go,

974
00:48:29,051 --> 00:48:32,320
no marketable skill,
a no car,

975
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:34,460
what are they going to do?
Right.

976
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:35,680
So that,
you know,

977
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:37,510
people say will stay.
They stay,

978
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:42,540
they gutted out.
And that's the position that you were 

979
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:42,540
in.
What?

980
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,000
What made you decide,
okay,

981
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,130
well just to Google information.
No,

982
00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:47,930
no,
no.

983
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,950
It was the treatment,
the way people were being treated and 

984
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:55,000
some of the shit that went down like so 
you would have been okay if they treated

985
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:58,610
you well and you still found out that a 
woman had been dead for six months,

986
00:48:58,611 --> 00:49:00,240
that l Ron Hubbard wasn't really a 
warning,

987
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:01,060
but I'll tell you why.

988
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:06,090
If they had been actually disseminating 
this information and people on this 

989
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,880
planet,
we're doing better and life was becoming

990
00:49:09,881 --> 00:49:14,881
better for large numbers of people.
I don't know if I still might be there 

991
00:49:14,881 --> 00:49:18,840
in other words.
So you could tell he was really being 

992
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,750
effective in doing what you thought it 
was supposed to do.

993
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,720
Precisely which has helped humanity.
Precisely.

994
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:28,020
Do you think that at the core that its 
potential to help humanity is still 

995
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:28,380
there?
You think that like,

996
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,990
like you were saying,
that the beginning stages of scientology

997
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:37,440
are beneficial and there was something 
like if they got all these beneficial 

998
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:37,670
things.
Yeah.

999
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:41,230
And just offer those,
the odds of that happening.

1000
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,680
The odds now we're talking about would 
be the same odds as me turning into a 

1001
00:49:48,101 --> 00:49:50,590
penguin right now.
It's not likely to act.

1002
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:52,840
So likely.
Not very likely.

1003
00:49:52,841 --> 00:49:54,550
Maybe you know,
and your son,

1004
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,080
he's going to be running it forever.

1005
00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:01,080
Does he?
Is there is absolutely nobody was gonna 

1006
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,401
take over.
Is it election like fucking election 

1007
00:50:03,401 --> 00:50:03,610
needs?
He runs it and that's the end of it.

1008
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,300
He's surrounded by people,
I guess you'd call them psycho fencers.

1009
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:08,810
Sycophants took offense.
Yeah.

1010
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:11,770
Who just pump him up all the time and if
he says,

1011
00:50:11,771 --> 00:50:13,260
you know what,
I would like to have such and such.

1012
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:16,570
Maybe he might want a different car.
Go,

1013
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:19,810
go out and get it from one of those 
people like what are the people like the

1014
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,810
surround him that enabled him to 
maintain this power.

1015
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,260
They feel that he's a power source and 
they support him a power because he's 

1016
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,020
the.
He runs the organization will.

1017
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:32,660
Yeah,
because he got his tax exemption a.

1018
00:50:32,661 --> 00:50:34,280
he'll do things.
He's tough.

1019
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,380
He's.
He's actually.

1020
00:50:36,381 --> 00:50:41,381
David is a very smart guy.
If it weren't for this streak in him 

1021
00:50:41,381 --> 00:50:44,240
where he obtained all this power and had
this shit going on in scientology,

1022
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:46,790
who knows?

1023
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:49,370
I think you could been successful at 
anything.

1024
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:52,040
I believe that as well.
I think anybody who gets to.

1025
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,100
I mean it's really unfortunate,
but it gets to any even a position of 

1026
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:59,690
being like a drug kingpin.
Pablo Escobar,

1027
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,110
I'm sure he could have been successful 
at other things here.

1028
00:51:03,111 --> 00:51:07,490
I decided to focus his mind in that 
direction here.

1029
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:09,020
Exactly right.
And that's how I feel.

1030
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:14,350
So you feel like your son just fucked up
in getting on a path that is in your 

1031
00:51:15,081 --> 00:51:20,081
eyes illegitimate versus you know,
him being the CEO of ibm or something 

1032
00:51:20,081 --> 00:51:24,551
like that.
You could say that you could say that 

1033
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:24,551
and I'll tell you,
I think it would be.

1034
00:51:24,551 --> 00:51:24,551
You would be correct not.
I think you would be.

1035
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:29,750
Does it?
Have you ever talked to him about 

1036
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:29,750
scientology that you.
You don't bring it up.

1037
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,560
You don't bring it up.
No.

1038
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,400
I mean,
look,

1039
00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:35,810
take anybody with that much power.
Do you think you can sit down and say,

1040
00:51:35,811 --> 00:51:38,540
now look what I think is what the fuck 
you talking to me about.

1041
00:51:38,541 --> 00:51:41,250
I'm running his fucking show and that if
it's your dad,

1042
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:44,150
I think I would think you would just sit
down and have that line with him.

1043
00:51:44,151 --> 00:51:45,240
I'm telling you,
no.

1044
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:50,950
Listen,
if you're a scientologist and you were 

1045
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:53,681
at that level,
you are of the belief that no spiritual 

1046
00:51:54,051 --> 00:51:59,030
being is another spiritual beings,
mother or father or daughter or sister.

1047
00:51:59,810 --> 00:52:04,810
You happen to be occupying a body that 
maybe was given to you by another 

1048
00:52:05,871 --> 00:52:10,871
person,
but in your heart you're actually an 

1049
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:12,440
independent thinking life unit.
An immortal one to boot.

1050
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:13,370
Okay.
Right.

1051
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,900
Okay,
but let me ask you this.

1052
00:52:15,110 --> 00:52:20,110
Do people really believed that or do 
they just kind of go along with it 

1053
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,340
because everybody else is going along 
with it as it deserving?

1054
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,850
Is there ever a time where you're alone 
with somebody else's sea org?

1055
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,580
Maybe you're setting up some video or 
something like that and someone goes,

1056
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:31,070
hey man,
this shit on the up and up.

1057
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:33,710
Very seldom.
Very seldom,

1058
00:52:33,711 --> 00:52:37,350
but what I'll tell you why though?
The walls have ears.

1059
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:39,500
Fuck No.
Well,

1060
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:44,830
you're telling this to somebody.
They might write a knowledge report on 

1061
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,501
you,
a knowledge report while you're in deep 

1062
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:47,501
shit and okay.
Jamie Dimon right into knowledge.

1063
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,260
Now,
as soon as we leave here.

1064
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,020
Okay,
listen.

1065
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,640
Okay.
I might laugh,

1066
00:52:52,641 --> 00:52:53,600
but boy,
when it's happened,

1067
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:55,400
listen,
I'm sure,

1068
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:00,670
and if it's found out later that he said
this to you and you didn't write a 

1069
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:05,141
knowledge report,
you are as culpable as he is for Shane 

1070
00:53:05,141 --> 00:53:08,651
and what happens to you?
Somebody writes a knowledge one for 

1071
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:08,651
interrogation.
Oh,

1072
00:53:08,651 --> 00:53:09,800
what do they do it talk to.
I see you down in a meter.

1073
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,030
Tells you why your crimes.
Wha.

1074
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:17,080
What?
What evil purpose do you have to word 

1075
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,900
David?
What evil purpose you have to El Ron 

1076
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:22,300
Hubbard.
What thoughts have you had about 

1077
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,981
leaving?
What thoughts have you had about 

1078
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:24,290
destroying the organization?
Anything of a harmful nature?

1079
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:25,200
They say,
man,

1080
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,630
fuck this place.
What dee?

1081
00:53:26,631 --> 00:53:27,930
Dee.
Did they kick you out?

1082
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,000
No.
So how's that work?

1083
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:31,290
What if?
What if you get there?

1084
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,970
What if someone writes a knowledge 
report and you go,

1085
00:53:32,971 --> 00:53:36,360
you know what man?
I been thinking I got on Google.

1086
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,210
I started reading a bunch of stuff.
I think it's all bullshit.

1087
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:40,530
I don't even want to be here anymore,
man.

1088
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,650
And Fuck,
fuck all this working for 50 bucks a 

1089
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:45,650
week.
This is stupid.

1090
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:46,650
I don't want to do this anymore.
Why are we all doing this?

1091
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:51,830
Why don't we just take the beginning 
parts of this and just get rid of all 

1092
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:54,981
the stupid shit about separating from 
your children and make this thing 

1093
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:54,981
better.

1094
00:53:54,981 --> 00:53:56,070
What do you say?
What would they do to you?

1095
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,810
Well,
first of all,

1096
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:03,530
you wouldn't dare do that if you were at
a place like I was at the international 

1097
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,290
base.
Okay.

1098
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:06,400
Which is Golden Arrow productions in 
Hemet,

1099
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:07,140
California.
Why?

1100
00:54:07,141 --> 00:54:12,141
What would they do to you?
They'd sees you and then went out and 

1101
00:54:12,141 --> 00:54:12,141
you'd be sequestered from the rest of 
the group,

1102
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:15,960
put it into a place where you weren't 
associated with the rest of the group.

1103
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:20,090
You'd go to lunch at a different time.
You'd have a security guard watching you

1104
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:21,060
morning,
afternoon,

1105
00:54:21,061 --> 00:54:22,170
and night,
and you can never leave.

1106
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:24,300
So I tried somebody to be like,
what if.

1107
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,980
What if you say,
I just want to go home.

1108
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,780
I want to get out of here.
I want to go get an apartment to do it,

1109
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,060
man.
You just can't do it.

1110
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,240
So they would just keep you at 
physically like,

1111
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:34,760
hold on,
hold you gotta,

1112
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,060
chill,
chill.

1113
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,210
And if the church,
well I'm sure they're going to hurt 

1114
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:41,210
dish,
but they can say,

1115
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:41,210
oh,
ron could have left anytime.

1116
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:41,820
You could.
That's bullshit.

1117
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:47,390
That's complete bullshit.
If I would have been caught what I was 

1118
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:47,390
trying to leave,
which I'm going to get into,

1119
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:47,390
I forget.
We were talking about,

1120
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,350
okay,
if I would have been caught,

1121
00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,210
they would have taken me and becky 
taking the keys to my car.

1122
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:57,690
I would've been sequestered from her.
She'd been to Western for me.

1123
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:02,540
We would have both been security checked
shit down with the hands on an emailer,

1124
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,840
which I'm sure you know.
What is your.

1125
00:55:03,850 --> 00:55:05,510
I did one of those ones.
Okay.

1126
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,890
I don't really think it works.
You don't think it works?

1127
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,440
Sometimes it does.
Okay,

1128
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,040
but that's not the point.
You'd sit down with that and be 

1129
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,580
interrogated and then you'd work maybe 
four or five hours away.

1130
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,770
It's a manual labor and when you weren't
doing that,

1131
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:22,100
you'd be back on the.
On the cans again as they say,

1132
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,370
what if you don't work?
What if you like,

1133
00:55:23,371 --> 00:55:28,371
fuck you.
I don't want to work like a difficult 

1134
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:28,371
bastard,
right?

1135
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:28,371
Yeah.
Like what's ever happened?

1136
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:29,610
What's that?
Has Anybody ever rebelled?

1137
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:31,770
And it's human nature to rebel against 
authority.

1138
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:37,150
Yeah,
but certain amount of human nature to 

1139
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:37,150
to,
to come.

1140
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,370
But when you're up at a place where you 
have three or 400 people who feel 

1141
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:42,300
differently,
you're not that brave.

1142
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:46,470
Does anybody ever have the gumption or 
the notion to go,

1143
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:48,420
hey,
what the fuck are we doing?

1144
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,360
Does that ever happen?
Okay,

1145
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:54,900
maybe we'll know what they do is they 
escape like I did.

1146
00:55:55,590 --> 00:55:59,620
That's it.
They don't speak up for.

1147
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,290
Right.
They know what they're in for.

1148
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:03,150
Who the F here?
There was a guy named Alex.

1149
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,900
he wanted a route out.
It took them four fucking years to route

1150
00:56:06,901 --> 00:56:08,050
out,
route out.

1151
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:13,280
That's what they call it when that's the
proper way to leave where you sit down 

1152
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,810
and you do this routing form.
It's basically security checking.

1153
00:56:15,811 --> 00:56:18,540
You kill your,
you know,

1154
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:23,660
for years.
Once you say if you sign a five year 

1155
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:23,660
contract.
Yeah,

1156
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,481
we just said a five year contract.
You would be at an outer org there.

1157
00:56:28,241 --> 00:56:31,780
You just walk out of the fucking place 
and people do that in outer org,

1158
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:35,260
but you can't do that at the sea org.
Well not at you.

1159
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:38,650
You could in Los Angeles,
but at the international base,

1160
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,680
you're living in a compound.
You're surrounded.

1161
00:56:41,681 --> 00:56:43,760
Would barbwire,
pointing in and pointing out.

1162
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:46,980
You're not going to jump that fence or 
you'll really screw yourself style,

1163
00:56:46,981 --> 00:56:51,981
but if you say,
say if you sign a five year contract 

1164
00:56:51,981 --> 00:56:52,360
when the fifth year's up,
you get to leave.

1165
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:57,690
Yeah,
they're going to try to get you to re 

1166
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:57,690
enlist.
Okay.

1167
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,530
But if you're at,
let's say you're working at one of the 

1168
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:01,540
organization Gianelli okay,
okay.

1169
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,580
You can walk out in the street and say,
hey,

1170
00:57:03,581 --> 00:57:05,170
see you later.
What are they going to do?

1171
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,480
Because you're,
you're in the free world.

1172
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:12,510
You're in the free world.
You're not running world at the 

1173
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:12,510
international base.
I understand.

1174
00:57:12,510 --> 00:57:16,610
All right,
so you had to plot some sort of an out 

1175
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:19,651
so you to think about it and then you 
had to work with the wife and you guys 

1176
00:57:19,651 --> 00:57:20,110
had to like hush hush.
Right?

1177
00:57:20,111 --> 00:57:22,300
And you asked me what led to that.
Well,

1178
00:57:22,301 --> 00:57:24,940
there's one major thing that led to it 
and that was this.

1179
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:28,840
We got a new music director.
I didn't want to have the post anymore.

1180
00:57:28,990 --> 00:57:33,990
I was getting old and got this young guy
and I would write melodies all day,

1181
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:38,410
all week months.

1182
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:42,730
Every melody I ever wrote was rejected 
by him and other words.

1183
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:45,370
Everything I was doing was a piece of 
shit,

1184
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:51,210
but I couldn't quit.
So this new guy was not fun to work 

1185
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:51,970
with.
Terrible.

1186
00:57:52,210 --> 00:57:53,110
It was terrible.
And yet,

1187
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:58,120
toes division,
I was the only one who had gotten a 

1188
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,030
recording contract on my own steam.
Nobody gave it to him.

1189
00:58:00,031 --> 00:58:05,031
I didn't have a rich daddy or a contract
with chapels publishing for my writing 

1190
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:10,980
and asked to play on the BBC.
Nobody had achieved that in that 

1191
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:15,330
department.
Now maybe my skills weren't up to how 

1192
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:15,330
the right modern music.
And I used to beg him.

1193
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:15,820
I said,
listen,

1194
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,980
what do you want as an acceptable 
particle?

1195
00:58:17,981 --> 00:58:20,120
I'm a trained musician.
Uh,

1196
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,470
let me give me some ideas what you want 
and I'll start writing that.

1197
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,510
Fuck you learn it.
Just like I did this.

1198
00:58:25,511 --> 00:58:27,040
I was treated well.

1199
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,650
It doesn't sound like a fun time.
So she'll wait a minute.

1200
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:30,910
Talk to your son and say,
Hey,

1201
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:33,040
kid listens.
Fucking new guy sucks.

1202
00:58:33,070 --> 00:58:33,970
Wait a minute.
I did that.

1203
00:58:33,971 --> 00:58:35,920
I called him and I would assume I wrote 
to him.

1204
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:36,490
I said,
Dave,

1205
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,570
you got to get together with me.
Right?

1206
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,870
So we got together and said,
look,

1207
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:43,960
I'm working all day long and nothing I'm
doing is being approved.

1208
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:46,150
You got to get me a different job.
I says,

1209
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:49,060
I don't care if you hit me a job washing
cars in multiple,

1210
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,480
but I want to do something.
So at the end of the day you can say,

1211
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:53,710
here's what he did.
Okay.

1212
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:55,690
He says,
I'll look into it.

1213
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:57,640
He never looked into it.
A couple months later,

1214
00:58:57,641 --> 00:58:58,240
I said,
Becky,

1215
00:58:58,241 --> 00:58:59,590
look,
we're getting the fuck out of here.

1216
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:04,980
Then we started planning.
So what was your plan as far as like 

1217
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,090
getting a job because you had been 
working there for 25 years?

1218
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,260
Well,
I'm a,

1219
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,010
I'm a good musician.
I'm not just a punk.

1220
00:59:12,011 --> 00:59:14,650
I mean I played quite a bit of jobs in 
Milwaukee.

1221
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:18,540
So you had skill and skills.
Good salesman too,

1222
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:19,830
you know.
Um,

1223
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,780
I also,
here's how I look.

1224
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:26,240
Okay,
I'm 76 years old.

1225
00:59:26,241 --> 00:59:29,430
I'll want to spend them at rest of my 
life suffering out everyday.

1226
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,000
Fuck this shit.
I'm getting Outta here.

1227
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:32,780
Right.
Got It.

1228
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,610
And becky finally says,
okay.

1229
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,780
And she saw the writing on the wall that
wasn't going to get better.

1230
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:44,470
So now we don't want to leave and leave 
everything behind because what little 

1231
00:59:45,741 --> 00:59:48,610
possessions we had was what we had.
All right,

1232
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:52,490
so we started,
by the way,

1233
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:57,491
I mentioned a little earlier that my 
daughter sent me 75 gifts gifts on 75th 

1234
00:59:57,491 --> 00:59:57,491
birthday,
right?

1235
00:59:57,491 --> 01:00:00,410
Yeah.
Becky came up with the idea.

1236
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,600
My mother is going to celebrate.
By the way,

1237
01:00:02,601 --> 01:00:03,560
my wife is younger than me.

1238
01:00:03,570 --> 01:00:08,570
My first wife,
I divorced him and married a much 

1239
01:00:08,570 --> 01:00:11,681
younger woman,
so her mother is going to have her 70th 

1240
01:00:11,681 --> 01:00:15,281
birthday.
So we decided to send her mother 70 

1241
01:00:15,281 --> 01:00:17,120
gifts.
Now in order to do this,

1242
01:00:17,121 --> 01:00:22,121
it has to go to the security guards.
So we would send her like a detail and 

1243
01:00:22,121 --> 01:00:26,921
kid for a car.
I mean her chances of detailing the car 

1244
01:00:26,921 --> 01:00:30,530
as a gift were nil to none.
But they saw that,

1245
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,150
okay,
we're sending her 70 gifts.

1246
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,060
So it got through them.
We sent her center,

1247
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:40,100
our l,
Ron Hubbard library books that we had 

1248
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,090
some of the things and we got a lot of 
stuff out of there that I couldn't fit 

1249
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,150
in the car when we were going.
Uh,

1250
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,130
you see what I'm saying?
Smart.

1251
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,450
And then after all was said and done,
we got everything out of there.

1252
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:54,080
We plotted it out and I did this on 
Sunday mornings.

1253
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,470
On Sunday mornings you had breakfast at 
9:00.

1254
01:00:58,010 --> 01:01:03,010
Now we lived on the southern side of the
base and we lived in rooms.

1255
01:01:06,410 --> 01:01:09,350
You couldn't have a refrigerator,
you couldn't have a coffeemaker there.

1256
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:13,760
But across the street on the north side,
I worked in the studio.

1257
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,580
There was a refrigerator there and I 
used to keep,

1258
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:19,800
like Italian Salami may be super sad.
Uh,

1259
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,310
some Parmesan cheese,
Romano cheese.

1260
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:27,670
So early Sunday morning at 9:00.
And I planned this out because there's 

1261
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:32,140
two gates.
There's one main gate where there's a 

1262
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,310
security guard sitting in a booth and in
down the road about 200 yards,

1263
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:37,700
there's another gate where there's a 
little camera and they see you coming.

1264
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:43,210
And they got used to me going across to 
the north side to go to the studio and 

1265
01:01:43,881 --> 01:01:48,410
I'd come back to the main gate and bring
the security guards a piece of cheese or

1266
01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:48,950
Salami.

1267
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:54,370
So they thought a Sunday morning he's 
going to get his goodies and that it 

1268
01:01:54,370 --> 01:01:55,310
wasn't feeding the watchdogs.
This is set up,

1269
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,010
right?
Right.

1270
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,020
So it comes a day.
We're going to leave March 25th,

1271
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:05,110
2012.
We get up real early and I had a little 

1272
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:06,230
notebook.
I must have checked it 20 times.

1273
01:02:06,231 --> 01:02:11,231
What I wanted to take,
what I wanted to leave behind like the 

1274
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:11,231
night before.
And by the way,

1275
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:16,211
my biggest cover on being able to get 
out of there was the fact that I was 76 

1276
01:02:16,211 --> 01:02:18,440
years old and I was the father of the 
chairman of the board.

1277
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:23,930
Nobody would suspect that I was going to
leave unauthorized it like alright,

1278
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:29,090
okay.
Shout them out with a mesh bag full of 

1279
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:29,090
shoes,
putting it in the car.

1280
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:33,300
And one of the security guards come by 
on his bicycle and Italian Guy Sal.

1281
01:02:33,690 --> 01:02:35,070
Hey Ronnie,
how are you doing that?

1282
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:35,550
Good.
You know?

1283
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:38,940
And he sees me putting this in,
but he justifies it in his mind.

1284
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,200
He'll,
he's putting stuff in his car.

1285
01:02:40,810 --> 01:02:44,820
Doesn't think twice why it.
Of course another guy's coming by an old

1286
01:02:44,821 --> 01:02:49,821
time,
scientologist I have a bag of clothes 

1287
01:02:49,821 --> 01:02:49,821
and putting in a car.
Ronnie.

1288
01:02:49,821 --> 01:02:49,821
How's it going?
Good deal.

1289
01:02:49,821 --> 01:02:50,220
Norm?
Yeah.

1290
01:02:50,430 --> 01:02:51,050
Alright.
You know,

1291
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,220
put it in the car.
So we got through all that.

1292
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,010
Okay.
So now Sunday morning,

1293
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,970
9:00
we get in the car,

1294
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,750
we're loaded up and we're driving down 
to get to that.

1295
01:03:03,751 --> 01:03:06,360
Second Gate is about a half mile down 
the road.

1296
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:12,380
We go there and I'm going past our mess 
hall where we would eat and this is 

1297
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:16,941
called Masco Canyon in or MCI.
It's where the crew would eat their 

1298
01:03:16,941 --> 01:03:21,000
meals and I see the chase car like on 
Sunday morning,

1299
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,310
there's only two security guards on 
duty.

1300
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:28,640
One is in the main booth and the and the
other one is in a car so he can rove and

1301
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:30,630
it's called the chase car.
Okay.

1302
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:34,110
So the chase car is parked outside of 
the mess hall.

1303
01:03:34,470 --> 01:03:39,470
I knew sal was in there.
So I go around another hundred yards 

1304
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:40,650
down the road,
get to the gate.

1305
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:46,190
And by the way,
at this point in my heart is in my 

1306
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:46,190
throat.
All right.

1307
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,100
Because if you,
when I hit that Buzzer,

1308
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,910
if you're going to have said come up to 
the boot,

1309
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:51,930
that was it.
I was fucked.

1310
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,820
Okay.
Hit the buzzer.

1311
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:57,170
Didn't say anything to gate opens.
I pulled out of the gate.

1312
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:02,200
This is becky returning left.
So I turned left jam to throttle and I 

1313
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,560
knew I had to make it them that he's.
There's three roads.

1314
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,740
One goes to route 60,
straight ahead rather.

1315
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,150
The other one goes to route 10 and if I 
turn,

1316
01:04:10,151 --> 01:04:15,151
unless they go into Hamot I knew by the 
time I'm going down a road and he would 

1317
01:04:15,730 --> 01:04:17,450
be on trying to get me into next.

1318
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:18,780
They'll run.
What the hell are you doing?

1319
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,170
They need called sal and sal get up to 
the booth pronto.

1320
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:24,660
I know sal would have to run out,
get in the car.

1321
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,570
I'd already be at those crossroads or 
the tree roads.

1322
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:33,050
So I knew in sal came,
he needed to turn right or go straight 

1323
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:33,480
ahead.
I turned left Winton to Hamot.

1324
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,390
We hit the boondocks and I was free.
Wow.

1325
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,730
So when did you do then?
We drove to Wisconsin.

1326
01:04:38,731 --> 01:04:39,960
To Jeff money on you?
Yeah,

1327
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:42,960
I had money on me and I paid for.
I paid for everything.

1328
01:04:42,961 --> 01:04:43,620
Cash.
Joe,

1329
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,810
you only get 50 bucks a week.
How long did you save money?

1330
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,360
While I was also getting social 
security,

1331
01:04:48,361 --> 01:04:51,240
so I would solve that away.
Very low amount by the way,

1332
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,600
because when we didn't get much money.
Yeah,

1333
01:04:53,650 --> 01:04:56,190
it's just bullshit.
But anyway,

1334
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:58,290
I paid for gas with cash.

1335
01:04:58,470 --> 01:05:01,500
We ate for cash.
We stayed in a motel.

1336
01:05:01,501 --> 01:05:06,501
Tonight's at paid cash.
Because you couldn't use your credit 

1337
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:06,501
cards too.
They'd be able to track.

1338
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:06,501
Yeah,
exactly.

1339
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:09,990
So when you finally surfaced hodges 
surface,

1340
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:14,000
I went to her mother's place and then 
what happens then does,

1341
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,080
do they try to get you?
Well,

1342
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:17,440
here's what happens.
No,

1343
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:19,840
believe me too.
They try to bring you back,

1344
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:24,040
you'll look big misunderstanding.
Or here's how it went.

1345
01:05:24,070 --> 01:05:29,070
About two weeks later we're sitting in 
her mother's house and it's a split 

1346
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:32,800
level where there's an upstairs and 
downstairs in the kitchen.

1347
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:35,230
The window is almost level with the 
ground.

1348
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,290
You know how it goes and I'm looking out
the window,

1349
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:43,291
we're having breakfast,
coffee and I see it's girl outside 

1350
01:05:43,291 --> 01:05:43,870
Marion and.
Fuck,

1351
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:44,740
okay.
They found me,

1352
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:50,170
so I went through the garage outside and
there's craig wool hair and he says,

1353
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:55,200
Oh Ronny,
I guess you're surprised it took us so 

1354
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:55,200
long to get here.

1355
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,320
Ha ha ha.
We thought you're going to go to 

1356
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:58,320
Laurie's place.
You never thought you'd come here.

1357
01:05:58,320 --> 01:05:58,660
Ha ha ha.
Like nothing happened,

1358
01:05:58,661 --> 01:05:59,410
you know?
Right.

1359
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,270
So he says,
okay.

1360
01:06:01,271 --> 01:06:01,990
So,
uh,

1361
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:02,830
I said,
Greg,

1362
01:06:02,831 --> 01:06:04,270
listen,
you're just wasting your time.

1363
01:06:04,271 --> 01:06:06,700
I'm not going back.
And he says,

1364
01:06:06,850 --> 01:06:08,110
Ron,
I said,

1365
01:06:08,111 --> 01:06:09,370
hey,
I don't want to live that life,

1366
01:06:09,371 --> 01:06:12,040
man.
It was a terrible fucking life.

1367
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:13,360
I'm not doing it again.
He says,

1368
01:06:13,361 --> 01:06:18,361
you blue.
That's a term they use if you leave 

1369
01:06:18,361 --> 01:06:19,480
without authorization.
And he pulled out this policy.

1370
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:23,170
It's called leaving and leaves and what 
it says,

1371
01:06:23,171 --> 01:06:27,460
even in leaves leaving and leaves,
that's the name of it.

1372
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:30,040
And what it says in there substantially 
is this,

1373
01:06:30,910 --> 01:06:35,910
the only reason a person leaves a group 
is because they have committed harmful 

1374
01:06:36,611 --> 01:06:40,480
acts against the group and they went to 
remove themself.

1375
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:44,050
So they don't keep on committing harmful
acts against the group.

1376
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:46,510
How convenient.
No Shit.

1377
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:48,160
You can't just leave because you want to
leave.

1378
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,940
You have to be aware to the fact that 
you know you're working maybe 12,

1379
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:56,941
14,
16 hours a day sometimes not going to 

1380
01:06:56,941 --> 01:06:57,310
sleep for three days.
You got that raise to 50 bucks a week.

1381
01:06:57,490 --> 01:06:59,350
I shouldn't have done it.
It's a nice raise.

1382
01:07:01,210 --> 01:07:02,090
So you've,
you,

1383
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:03,190
when you do,
then when they,

1384
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,150
when you say you're not going back,
while they try to convince me in,

1385
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,620
uh,
it got to the point and says,

1386
01:07:08,710 --> 01:07:10,720
guys,
you're wasting your time.

1387
01:07:10,721 --> 01:07:15,721
I am not going back.
And I went in town and I saw him a 

1388
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:15,721
couple times and they said,
come on,

1389
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:18,190
we'll take out to a nice place to eat.
We'll take you to a movie.

1390
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:21,430
Like they're going to schmooze me into 
going back to live that life.

1391
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,280
Greg says to me,
Ronny,

1392
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:25,330
look,
you can go to flag.

1393
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,940
You will have your own apartment.
You have a kitchen.

1394
01:07:27,941 --> 01:07:30,520
We know you like to cook and then you 
can train.

1395
01:07:30,521 --> 01:07:33,160
Some of the guys had it child.
You can play with the band down there.

1396
01:07:33,890 --> 01:07:35,150
Greg,
you out of your fucking money.

1397
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:36,970
You get me down or it's going to be the 
same thing.

1398
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:37,540
No,
it won't.

1399
01:07:37,541 --> 01:07:41,380
Runny and went on.
So do you think they were just trying to

1400
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,750
bullshit you like one?
Not Think.

1401
01:07:43,751 --> 01:07:44,710
Absolutely.
They.

1402
01:07:44,711 --> 01:07:46,720
So if you got there,
there'd be no apartment.

1403
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:49,060
They'd punish you,
write out a knowledge report.

1404
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:50,560
You can't do this.
Yeah.

1405
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:53,680
Do they want you to stay?
Why do they give a fuck if you leave?

1406
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:57,070
That's what they consider to be a 
sensitive particle.

1407
01:07:57,580 --> 01:08:00,360
Like these guys.
That was a Paul.

1408
01:08:00,370 --> 01:08:03,910
Here's what I mean by that.
Like Dwayne Powell and Daniel Powell,

1409
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,070
while I was a father of the chairman of 
the board.

1410
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:07,690
Right.
That's a blight.

1411
01:08:07,691 --> 01:08:12,691
I mean,
did you ever talk to your son after 

1412
01:08:12,691 --> 01:08:12,691
this?
I tried to call them once.

1413
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:17,730
I tried to call him after I found out 
the pis were following me and after I 

1414
01:08:17,781 --> 01:08:20,660
heard that you got on the phone and said
if he dies,

1415
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:22,010
let him die.
Don't intervene.

1416
01:08:22,011 --> 01:08:23,690
Don't do anything.
This is what you heard,

1417
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:25,910
right?
You can hear it to you.

1418
01:08:25,930 --> 01:08:28,340
You design according to your fingers.
Yeah,

1419
01:08:28,341 --> 01:08:29,980
absolutely.
Tony Ortega,

1420
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,060
underground bunker,
and you can hear these interviews.

1421
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:32,970
Okay?
Okay.

1422
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,170
There is public as you're going to get,
but you don't hear his actual words.

1423
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:41,480
Know that this guy would make up that 
story to make things up.

1424
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:44,300
Right?
While.

1425
01:08:44,301 --> 01:08:45,160
Okay,
let's put it this way.

1426
01:08:45,161 --> 01:08:47,570
I'm just playing devil's advocate.
You can play devil's advocate.

1427
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,670
The father was interrogated to begin 
with.

1428
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,580
He told the same story.
The son came in later,

1429
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,320
didn't have a chance to talk to his 
father.

1430
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:55,940
Told the same story.
Okay,

1431
01:08:57,410 --> 01:08:59,120
so you haven't had a chance to talk to 
your son.

1432
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:03,020
I called and uh,
an attorney got on the phone and said,

1433
01:09:03,021 --> 01:09:05,030
Ron,
David won't talk to you.

1434
01:09:05,031 --> 01:09:06,560
He doesn't feel he can trust,
you know.

1435
01:09:06,561 --> 01:09:07,670
Let me,
let me ask you this.

1436
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:10,460
As a father,
because I'm a father and your father,

1437
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:17,380
the idea of being estranged from your 
kids in that way where your kid hates 

1438
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:21,050
you and your kid doesn't want anybody to
save you.

1439
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:24,590
If you die,
do you feel any remorse?

1440
01:09:24,591 --> 01:09:26,840
Do you feel like in any way you fucked 
up?

1441
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:29,300
Do you ever look at your life and go,
how did I.

1442
01:09:29,630 --> 01:09:31,970
How did I lose my connection with my 
son?

1443
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,760
Listen,
it's written in policy to do what David 

1444
01:09:41,751 --> 01:09:43,060
did.
Letters,

1445
01:09:43,070 --> 01:09:44,450
a policy that says,
listen,

1446
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:47,630
somebody understand that entirely,
but I'm talking to you as a human being,

1447
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,370
as a human being,
as a human being.

1448
01:09:49,371 --> 01:09:51,920
I thought it was terrible because we had
a good life together,

1449
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:56,950
but do you feel any responsibility?
Do you feel like there's anything you 

1450
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:57,470
could've done differently?
Did you get them in scientology?

1451
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:02,530
That's it.
Can I feel like once he got into 

1452
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:02,530
scientology,
it's not your fault.

1453
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,240
He lives his life.
He's the one who got the power to do all

1454
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:06,320
these things.
I understand,

1455
01:10:06,321 --> 01:10:07,400
but you raised them,
right?

1456
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:12,430
I mean,
whatever connection and bond that you 

1457
01:10:12,430 --> 01:10:14,450
developed with great life together,
we that didn't carry forth in some way.

1458
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,250
You know what I'm saying?
I mean,

1459
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,270
obviously I'm not in scientology and 
obviously I was not in your situation,

1460
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,760
but I can't imagine that you must.

1461
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:27,790
You must have gone over it and looked at
your communications with him and 

1462
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:31,610
wondered if maybe if you extended 
yourself more,

1463
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:33,720
if you talked more,
if it was there,

1464
01:10:33,721 --> 01:10:36,380
something you could've done that 
would've prevented any of this.

1465
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:38,150
Joe,
you're dreaming.

1466
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,840
I don't mind telling you that.
Okay.

1467
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:41,900
I'm doing it with all respect.
Okay.

1468
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:43,620
Because you're,
you're,

1469
01:10:43,621 --> 01:10:45,710
uh,
you do good interviews.

1470
01:10:45,711 --> 01:10:47,260
I've showed you the other interviews and
I,

1471
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:49,460
I've,
I'm happy you got me on the show.

1472
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:54,940
No,
I couldn't have done anything different 

1473
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:54,940
except maybe not get them in 
scientology.

1474
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:56,750
So you've got the power.
Listen,

1475
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:01,860
there's policy that l Ron Hubbard wrote 
and David loved l Ron Hubbard,

1476
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:05,240
and he applies the policies.
We believe all that stuff.

1477
01:11:05,241 --> 01:11:08,840
Does he believe there's a politic game?
Are you familiar with that?

1478
01:11:08,870 --> 01:11:10,490
No.
What's the fair game?

1479
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:15,970
If somebody goes against the or talks 
out against the church and they're 

1480
01:11:15,970 --> 01:11:19,080
declared a suppressive person,
he can be lied to.

1481
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:22,680
Trick to and destroyed.
No punishment and the person who did it,

1482
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:27,890
but that's not what I mean is the really
crazy stuff like the stuff that sounds 

1483
01:11:28,921 --> 01:11:33,921
like science fiction about like the 
fatals and dropping them in a volcano 

1484
01:11:33,921 --> 01:11:35,170
and the hydrogen bomb and all that stuff
does.

1485
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:38,750
Does everybody believe that stuff?
I think a lot of people do believe it.

1486
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,360
Is it discussed?
No.

1487
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,940
You don't discuss that.
No one discusses.

1488
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:46,941
No one discussion.
So when we're sitting around the sea 

1489
01:11:46,941 --> 01:11:46,941
org,
but no,

1490
01:11:46,941 --> 01:11:50,331
let's get thing.
Get back to which pertinent to dish and 

1491
01:11:50,331 --> 01:11:53,000
that's the policy.
How to operate as a group that won the 

1492
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,570
fair game.
Policy is written and by the way,

1493
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:59,900
just to satisfy you,
I'll send you soft copies if you need 

1494
01:11:59,900 --> 01:12:00,270
me.
It's okay.

1495
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:02,460
Here's another one.
A,

1496
01:12:02,461 --> 01:12:07,461
if a person does this find or 
manufacturer data about the person.

1497
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:13,580
Okay.
So once you've become their enemy kind 

1498
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:13,580
of left alone,
you,

1499
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,460
you left them,
you're,

1500
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:19,490
you know,
you're the dad of the chairman of the 

1501
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:19,500
board.
You're a sensitive particle.

1502
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,960
You got a real problem.
That's right.

1503
01:12:22,020 --> 01:12:27,020
Okay.
Now you said they took out a bunch of 

1504
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:27,020
different website addresses.
Not a bunch,

1505
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:27,570
500.
In other words,

1506
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:31,170
they got 500 iterations or my name 
variations.

1507
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,450
So no matter what you put in,
by the way,

1508
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:35,320
I have a website,
which I did.

1509
01:12:35,370 --> 01:12:39,030
I just did it and it's called the real 
ron miscavige.com.

1510
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:43,980
You could see my website,
but if you put any other thing in there,

1511
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:48,390
you're going to get a hate site that 
tells you things about me that you think

1512
01:12:48,391 --> 01:12:51,240
I was the worst person who ever lived.
Did you write this book?

1513
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:53,850
What was the.
What was the motivation?

1514
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,460
Did you want to make money or natural 
loading?

1515
01:12:56,460 --> 01:12:57,420
Nine.
I wanted to help,

1516
01:12:57,450 --> 01:12:58,590
but you didn't make money,
right?

1517
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,850
You made some money.
Yeah,

1518
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:01,620
but that isn't the reason to write in a 
book.

1519
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,960
The reason that the only reason I'd 
write a book,

1520
01:13:04,350 --> 01:13:09,350
well not me,
the hundreds of families that are 

1521
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:12,390
disconnected from the kids.
I understand and I knew if I.

1522
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:15,540
by the way,
what led me to write it was not even him

1523
01:13:15,541 --> 01:13:17,370
saying if he dies,
let him die.

1524
01:13:18,180 --> 01:13:23,180
I then took a CD with these 
interrogations on Daniel Powell and 

1525
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,710
Dwayne Powell and my wife and I drove 
down to Florida that she,

1526
01:13:28,711 --> 01:13:33,711
my daughters and I was going to play 
these for them because now they're 

1527
01:13:33,711 --> 01:13:35,250
disconnected from me,
so I went to my daughter's daughter,

1528
01:13:35,251 --> 01:13:37,620
Laurie's place,
she's not home.

1529
01:13:37,621 --> 01:13:39,330
I went to denise's place.
Her husband,

1530
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:40,410
Jerry,
answered the door,

1531
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:43,200
answer the door about that far,
and he's talking to me.

1532
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:43,710
I said,
Jerry,

1533
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:45,360
I'd like to speak to denise.
Well,

1534
01:13:45,361 --> 01:13:47,730
you can't because she's not here.
I said,

1535
01:13:47,731 --> 01:13:48,630
well look,
where is she?

1536
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:50,640
Because I got to get in communication 
with her.

1537
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:51,480
He says,
no,

1538
01:13:51,481 --> 01:13:53,580
you have to go to the church and handle 
it with the church.

1539
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:54,630
I said,
Jerry,

1540
01:13:54,631 --> 01:13:58,320
for Christ sake and Jerry's as well,
of course they are.

1541
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,880
If your wife's in,
you have to be in.

1542
01:13:59,881 --> 01:14:01,290
Is that how it works?
Basically,

1543
01:14:01,291 --> 01:14:03,120
as you know.
And so he said,

1544
01:14:03,121 --> 01:14:04,140
no,
you've got to handle with them.

1545
01:14:04,141 --> 01:14:07,680
And he said it's a waste of time.
So I'm talking for about 20 minutes.

1546
01:14:07,681 --> 01:14:09,150
And I finally said,
Jerry,

1547
01:14:09,151 --> 01:14:10,290
what's up?
What does this mean?

1548
01:14:10,710 --> 01:14:11,130
He's.
Well,

1549
01:14:11,131 --> 01:14:15,220
I'll tell you why denise and I are 
through with you and becky forever.

1550
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:18,280
That was it.
You know what?

1551
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:23,281
Fuck you.
I'm going to do a book and I'm going to 

1552
01:14:23,281 --> 01:14:25,990
expose what you do to people because if 
I did a blog,

1553
01:14:26,350 --> 01:14:26,980
who am I?

1554
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:30,010
I'm going to get maybe a couple thousand
people to look at this blog,

1555
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:34,210
but a book I knew that I could get and I
was on 20 slash 20.

1556
01:14:34,211 --> 01:14:37,720
I was on the Megan Kelly show.
I was on late night with Seth Meyers,

1557
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:40,000
so we got a lot of exposure,
a lot of books.

1558
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:45,270
A lot of people are seeing what they did
and I'm just hoping enough people do 

1559
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:51,661
this so they're going to drop that 
disconnection policy because that's a 

1560
01:14:51,661 --> 01:14:55,711
killer.
So you think if they drop the 

1561
01:14:55,711 --> 01:14:57,901
disconnection policy,
maybe a lot of the other policies would 

1562
01:14:57,901 --> 01:15:01,201
be more tolerable.
I think if they dropped the 

1563
01:15:01,201 --> 01:15:02,260
disconnection policy and allowed you to 
talk to your family,

1564
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:07,320
listen,
if they wanted to do scientology and I 

1565
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:08,050
could still talk to them,
I wouldn't give a shit.

1566
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:09,510
I'd say,
fine,

1567
01:15:09,511 --> 01:15:11,320
do what you want to do.
Look,

1568
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,060
but wouldn't it bother you that they 
can't leave?

1569
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:18,830
No,
they're public because they're not in 

1570
01:15:18,830 --> 01:15:22,140
the car,
but you can't really leave if you're 

1571
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:22,140
public.
Like,

1572
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,130
was Leah Remedy in the Sea Org?
No,

1573
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:26,590
she's a public scientologist,
but when she,

1574
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:27,700
when she left,
she,

1575
01:15:28,540 --> 01:15:30,550
she took her whole family with her.
Right.

1576
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,490
So they didn't get a chance to pick them
out and say,

1577
01:15:33,491 --> 01:15:35,880
look,
you got to disconnect from lists.

1578
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:41,310
That is like one of the things that is 
like a hallmark operation of problematic

1579
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:42,850
organizations.
Right.

1580
01:15:42,851 --> 01:15:44,950
They separate,
separate you from your family?

1581
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I think it's terrible.
I think it's the worst thing you can do 

1582
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,151
to a person.
Look at them and 45 fucking years 

1583
01:15:54,151 --> 01:15:54,151
anymore.
Okay.

1584
01:15:54,151 --> 01:15:55,450
Right.
I'm 81 years old in January.

1585
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:59,130
I would like to see my family.
I would like to have something,

1586
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:03,460
just pictures of my great grandchildren 
on their facebooks.

1587
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,880
I've never met these kids.
I don't even know what their names are.

1588
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:09,010
Son of a bitch.
I mean.

1589
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:11,530
And you feel like your kids are going to
be in there forever?

1590
01:16:11,880 --> 01:16:16,880
Yeah.
They never expressed any 

1591
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:17,770
dissatisfaction.
Well,

1592
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:23,070
when I was in the sea org,
I was not around them and we only would 

1593
01:16:23,070 --> 01:16:26,020
only communicate through letters or they
would send each other gifts on birthdays

1594
01:16:26,021 --> 01:16:29,170
or Christmas or something.
I couldn't get leaves to see them.

1595
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:33,460
At one point my daughter Laurie went to 
see David and said,

1596
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:35,260
listen,
if dad can't come to see us,

1597
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,860
we would like to go to see him.
So he exceeded.

1598
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:43,861
Just imagine she had to ask him if it's 
okay to come and see me and they came to

1599
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:49,210
celebrity center and we up soon,
about four days together and just having

1600
01:16:49,211 --> 01:16:50,400
a good time.
Me Cooking,

1601
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:55,410
just enjoying their company and just the
whole scene is really bad.

1602
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,470
It's just not okay.
And it's the way it's set up,

1603
01:16:59,471 --> 01:17:03,160
it's built into the DNA as to how to 
control people.

1604
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:05,440
And you have a threat,
you have extortion,

1605
01:17:05,441 --> 01:17:07,120
you have leverage.
And that's what that is.

1606
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:09,980
That is why I wrote the book.
When you look back on your

1607
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:13,960
life joining this in the 19 seventies,
1976 70,

1608
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,450
when you look back on your life and you,
uh,

1609
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:23,260
you think about that move,
that initial move of joining,

1610
01:17:24,860 --> 01:17:25,910
what goes on in your head?

1611
01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:29,960
I don't think about it because there's 
nothing I can do about it,

1612
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:32,600
but I can tell you this.
I wouldn't have done it.

1613
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:36,140
In other words,
if I knew then what I knew now of course

1614
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:36,580
I say,
Hey,

1615
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:37,400
fuck you,
man.

1616
01:17:37,401 --> 01:17:38,920
I'm not doing this right.
What do you think?

1617
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:41,600
I'm nuts.
Did New people join all the time?

1618
01:17:43,550 --> 01:17:46,430
I can't imagine there's very many new 
people joining right now.

1619
01:17:46,431 --> 01:17:51,431
You know,
unless they're a shepherd or somebody 

1620
01:17:51,431 --> 01:17:53,771
like that,
or somebody who's never looked at the 

1621
01:17:53,771 --> 01:17:53,771
internet,
you can't possibly.

1622
01:17:53,771 --> 01:17:56,420
And this is what people do,
the checks up molecule googling.

1623
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:00,200
That's very common and you start looking
at anything.

1624
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:01,730
Oh,
what do I want to get involved in this?

1625
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:03,170
You know,
by the way,

1626
01:18:03,171 --> 01:18:08,171
in the book I give references to books 
that were written in the late 18 

1627
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,540
hundreds,
early 19 hundreds.

1628
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:15,170
The new thought movement and there's 
many,

1629
01:18:15,171 --> 01:18:20,171
many,
many datums about life that if you were 

1630
01:18:20,171 --> 01:18:21,980
a scientologist and you see these as,
wait a minute,

1631
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,170
l Ron Hubbard used to say this.
All right,

1632
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:28,700
talking about the reactive mind.
Remember that from dianetics.

1633
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:33,710
When Tim Atkinson,
I'm an amateur guys,

1634
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:37,670
they talk about the subconscious mind.
It records 24 hours a day.

1635
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,260
They're talking about the same thing.
He was.

1636
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:41,510
Well Lawrence where I talked about that 
and going clear,

1637
01:18:41,511 --> 01:18:46,511
he said that it seems like at least some
of what was going on was l Ron Hubbard 

1638
01:18:46,511 --> 01:18:50,480
trying to self medicate that he was 
writing things to try to cure zone ils

1639
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:51,460
probably.
Yeah,

1640
01:18:52,030 --> 01:18:57,030
but these people,
I mean you can go on the Internet and 

1641
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,460
get these books are ninety nine cents 
because it's past 75 years.

1642
01:18:57,461 --> 01:19:02,461
You can't.
You can't copyright them and of course 

1643
01:19:02,461 --> 01:19:03,130
you wouldn't know if you weren't a 
scientologist.

1644
01:19:03,131 --> 01:19:05,950
You wouldn't know which parts that he 
took out of that.

1645
01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:11,430
But I've run across many,
many things in the books that he just 

1646
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:16,411
lifted,
almost copied and pasted it and put it 

1647
01:19:16,411 --> 01:19:16,411
into what he called scientology.

1648
01:19:16,411 --> 01:19:18,200
Yeah.
Well,

1649
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:23,650
I mean if he's trying to get a great 
collection of work on how to work the 

1650
01:19:24,201 --> 01:19:25,520
mind,
the mind works

1651
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:29,470
and it worked then so he knew it would 
work now

1652
01:19:29,690 --> 01:19:33,800
and so there is something to some of 
some of the principles.

1653
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:38,890
That's not a question about it.
Then you think to this day that if you 

1654
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:39,740
could remove a lot of it,

1655
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:45,930
if you could filter it down to those 
things that are provably work workable.

1656
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,570
Do you think it's saveable do you think 
like let's say this,

1657
01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:56,230
what if you know your son listens to 
this podcast and he's like,

1658
01:19:56,231 --> 01:19:57,320
what the fuck?
This light,

1659
01:19:57,350 --> 01:20:00,940
this world,
who knows this life is not going to last

1660
01:20:00,941 --> 01:20:01,990
forever.
What am I doing?

1661
01:20:01,991 --> 01:20:04,330
I can't even talk to my dad.
Well maybe I've.

1662
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:07,060
Maybe I've lost my way.
Maybe I get together with.

1663
01:20:08,150 --> 01:20:09,400
We tried to figure this out.
Yeah.

1664
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:12,300
And he says,
what can we do to make this better?

1665
01:20:14,430 --> 01:20:17,440
I know I'm talking crazy,
but I know I'm talking to this guy.

1666
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:19,980
What the hell you know?
Let's just as an exercise,

1667
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:22,530
what would you do if he said,
let's talk it out.

1668
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:27,570
I talked to him,
I'll talk to anybody about anything new.

1669
01:20:27,571 --> 01:20:29,730
People are joining scientology,
we got a real problem.

1670
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:34,790
What do you think is the beneficial 
aspects of it that we should keep and 

1671
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:37,791
which will get rid of and I think he 
would come up with the things that I 

1672
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:41,301
come up with also.
So you have wrote about those in this 

1673
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:44,361
book.
I tell about four points you could do 

1674
01:20:44,361 --> 01:20:47,331
and you could sell Bj,
but the chances of that happening are 

1675
01:20:47,331 --> 01:20:50,390
just show remote.
I wouldn't bet to Shantanu will not even

1676
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:55,400
trying to bet on it,
but do you think that that is just what 

1677
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:55,440
happens with people they get into these 
positions?

1678
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:59,190
We created an ideology or you.
It's the power.

1679
01:20:59,191 --> 01:21:02,670
It's the acquisition of power and then 
in order to keep that power,

1680
01:21:02,671 --> 01:21:07,110
because I think power is almost like a 
drug that's almost like crack cocaine.

1681
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:09,750
You get hooked on it.
You don't want to let go of it right?

1682
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:12,460
And now you have things going to hell 
around you.

1683
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:17,780
You're going to do anything you can 
perceive to be beneficial to keep it 

1684
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:21,381
going and start implementing that and 
like buying new buildings and just 

1685
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:28,100
making him into these palaces for people
to come and do services and then you 

1686
01:21:28,100 --> 01:21:29,520
drive by them and there's nobody in 
them.

1687
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:35,480
Nobody in them.
Where are they getting all the money to 

1688
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:35,480
buy these buildings?
People donate it,

1689
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:36,510
but there's only 20,000
people.

1690
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,190
But you have whales,
man.

1691
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:42,300
There are people saying call.
Well,

1692
01:21:42,301 --> 01:21:44,290
I'm calling them a and as a matter of 
fact,

1693
01:21:44,291 --> 01:21:45,330
it's like a gambling term.

1694
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:50,600
It is.
It's somebody who goes to Las Vegas and 

1695
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:50,600
they got a lot of dope and they'll blow 
it all.

1696
01:21:50,600 --> 01:21:51,960
They get crazy.
Come on seven,

1697
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:53,130
right?
Yeah,

1698
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:54,480
it's a whale.
Yeah.

1699
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:58,440
Okay.
Well you have people in there and I feel

1700
01:21:58,441 --> 01:21:59,870
no need to mention their names.
I'll,

1701
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,950
I'll tell you off the air,
but okay.

1702
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:04,500
I don't want to throw them,
but there's a lot of very wealthy people

1703
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:06,670
and they donate a ton of tonic.
One Guy,

1704
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:09,780
he had a medical procedure.
He sold for something like two,

1705
01:22:10,140 --> 01:22:12,930
two point $4,000,000,000.
Who knows?

1706
01:22:12,931 --> 01:22:17,931
He probably gave about 50 or $60,000,000
to the church and the church would get 

1707
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:22,581
for that.
Do they take them around and one of 

1708
01:22:22,581 --> 01:22:23,040
those things like one of those old 
school king things,

1709
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,250
none of those things called the carry 
around wells carts.

1710
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,770
I don't get a bunch of dudes that cools.

1711
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:29,730
Yeah.
Do you remember?

1712
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:32,010
That'd be dope.
History of the world part one.

1713
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:33,790
Madeline Kahn was on it.
Yes.

1714
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:34,710
Yeah.
One of those.

1715
01:22:34,740 --> 01:22:37,140
What are those things called where they 
carry around?

1716
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:38,800
I don't know,
but I'll.

1717
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,740
I'll check it out and I'll send you an 
email.

1718
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,510
But anyway,
Jamie,

1719
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:42,330
you'll look it up.
Look,

1720
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:47,600
no,
they get a huge trophy trophy for like 

1721
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:53,150
six feet tall and you go on the stage 
and get your picture taken with David 

1722
01:22:53,150 --> 01:22:53,400
and he congratulated.
What about those?

1723
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:58,260
Like big dinner plate gold metals.
That was it called a litter wow.

1724
01:22:58,261 --> 01:23:02,340
Like how weird.
The litters of class of wheels vehicles.

1725
01:23:02,341 --> 01:23:06,190
A type of human power transport.
A simple litter often called

1726
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:09,730
a king carrier,
consists of a sling attached along.

1727
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,190
Two lengths of Poles are stretched 
inside a frame.

1728
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:13,270
Hmm.
Interesting.

1729
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:15,100
Now you call the.
I would've never guessed.

1730
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:16,990
I wouldn't have either.
How weird.

1731
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:22,260
Like what is Tom Cruise?
I have to get to get one of those giant 

1732
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:22,260
as gold metals.
It's bigger than the Olympics.

1733
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,940
Oh,
the medal of Valor Valor.

1734
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,650
Well,
that's a different situation.

1735
01:23:26,710 --> 01:23:28,590
Let me pay a shot and we tell them,
tell me something.

1736
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,270
When,
when you're a celebrity of his stature,

1737
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:33,790
there's no rules.
No rules.

1738
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:34,330
No.
You're,

1739
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:36,610
you're catered to celebrity of my 
stature.

1740
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:38,380
Like a minor league celebrity.
What?

1741
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:40,540
Kinda what kinda sweet perks could be 
pampered.

1742
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:42,180
You'd be pampered.
Yeah.

1743
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:44,710
Like good seats at a restaurant or 
something like that.

1744
01:23:44,910 --> 01:23:46,420
Well,
a good that an event.

1745
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,250
We'll get that juicy.
Gold metal.

1746
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,440
That's beautiful.
Yeah.

1747
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:50,440
I might join.
Just kidding.

1748
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:55,530
A nice metal stand in front of that big 
globe and I tell you that is put 

1749
01:23:58,151 --> 01:23:58,690
together.

1750
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:01,180
That takes a lot of work.
I bet.

1751
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:06,230
Looking at the hands of bastard.
Perfect cheeks could no structure 

1752
01:24:06,230 --> 01:24:06,580
because 55 years old,
it looks great.

1753
01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:07,490
Yeah.
What's the.

1754
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:10,750
What are they keeping him alive?
He looks great.

1755
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:13,120
Like he's a guy that doesn't look like 
he's aging.

1756
01:24:13,330 --> 01:24:13,780
I know.
No,

1757
01:24:13,781 --> 01:24:16,760
he'd be probably workshop.
I'm sure he works out.

1758
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:17,710
When,
when I,

1759
01:24:17,711 --> 01:24:18,490
uh,
rate actor,

1760
01:24:18,491 --> 01:24:20,950
right?
Admits he ends up tomorrow.

1761
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:22,600
Do you ever see that science fiction 
movie?

1762
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:24,610
No one ever didn't.
Great movie.

1763
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:25,930
That's what it's called,
right?

1764
01:24:25,931 --> 01:24:30,931
The edge of tomorrow.
The one when he keeps coming back to 

1765
01:24:30,931 --> 01:24:30,931
life again.
Yeah.

1766
01:24:30,931 --> 01:24:30,931
Live,
die,

1767
01:24:30,931 --> 01:24:34,021
repeat the county.
That's a fucking great movie that I 

1768
01:24:34,021 --> 01:24:34,330
think he so wacky that a lot of his 
movies,

1769
01:24:34,331 --> 01:24:37,120
they don't get the credit they deserve.
You know what I mean?

1770
01:24:37,121 --> 01:24:39,340
Because he's so wacky.
People are gross motherfucker.

1771
01:24:39,460 --> 01:24:39,910
Well,
no,

1772
01:24:39,911 --> 01:24:41,390
he's,
he's a dry.

1773
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,130
There's no two ways about it.
It's not what I'm saying.

1774
01:24:45,131 --> 01:24:50,131
What I'm saying is I think that people 
don't respect the movie is much like 

1775
01:24:50,131 --> 01:24:50,770
people that are real connoisseurs of 
film.

1776
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:55,890
That's a fantastic science fiction 
movies and which are called the edge of 

1777
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:55,890
tomorrow.
It's really good.

1778
01:24:56,290 --> 01:24:57,550
Three years ago,
maybe four,

1779
01:24:57,850 --> 01:24:58,960
something like that.
Wow.

1780
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:04,830
It's a great movie man.
But I feel like if someone with no 

1781
01:25:04,830 --> 01:25:08,281
controversy attached to them was the 
star of that movie would have been 

1782
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:08,281
critically acclaimed.
It's a,

1783
01:25:08,281 --> 01:25:09,640
it's an amazing film.
It doesn't have any holes in it.

1784
01:25:09,970 --> 01:25:10,900
It's a really good.
Well,

1785
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:12,880
I'll tell you,
there's controversy attached to him,

1786
01:25:12,881 --> 01:25:13,930
isn't there?
There's a little bit.

1787
01:25:14,050 --> 01:25:16,090
Yeah.
If you said there wasn't,

1788
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:18,880
you'd be Glib.
Don't be Glib.

1789
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:22,750
Well,
I know we worked out when he got a house

1790
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:26,950
in Beverly Hills.
I put the gym in,

1791
01:25:27,030 --> 01:25:29,460
I got the equipment for the gym in that 
House and uh,

1792
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:30,460
well he's a winner.

1793
01:25:30,610 --> 01:25:35,610
I mean he's just a winner and he 
attributes a lot of those winning 

1794
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:36,310
attitudes to scientology.
Yeah,

1795
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,020
I mean a lot of his,
uh,

1796
01:25:38,021 --> 01:25:40,210
his focus and the way he looks at 
things.

1797
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:45,010
That's what I was think of when I used 
to think of before I started researching

1798
01:25:45,011 --> 01:25:49,060
it and finding all the wacky stuff.
But before I knew what scientology was,

1799
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:53,830
I thought of it as being like a,
I thought of dianetics right.

1800
01:25:53,831 --> 01:25:57,250
I thought dianetics was sorta like 
Anthony Robbins unlimited power.

1801
01:25:57,251 --> 01:25:57,910
Like,
oh,

1802
01:25:57,911 --> 01:26:00,580
this is like a guideline for getting 
your shit together.

1803
01:26:00,581 --> 01:26:05,581
And Yeah.
And that's what I've always wanted to 

1804
01:26:05,581 --> 01:26:05,581
do.
My whole,

1805
01:26:05,581 --> 01:26:05,581
I've always felt like,
ah,

1806
01:26:05,581 --> 01:26:06,470
I wish I was more disciplined that wish 
I got my shit together more.

1807
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:08,110
Maybe I need to read more books and 
said,

1808
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:10,520
read Anthony Robbins,
and then I read dianetics.

1809
01:26:10,521 --> 01:26:13,280
I thought they were kind of the same 
thing back in the day.

1810
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:18,310
Well,
Anthony Robbins did steal some things 

1811
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,310
just from scientology.
There's no two ways about it.

1812
01:26:18,700 --> 01:26:21,560
And there's also another thing called 
[inaudible].

1813
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:24,590
Yes.
I've heard that used in that right now.

1814
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:26,630
Is that,
is that a cult too?

1815
01:26:26,970 --> 01:26:29,240
Is.
I mean they're a little bit more.

1816
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:30,490
Look,
I don't know to.

1817
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:35,500
I don't know too much about it,
but I know that there are some people 

1818
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:35,500
who've done it who felt they had a lot 
of good wins out of it.

1819
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:36,290
Okay.
Well that's the thing,

1820
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:41,291
right?
Like when you look at a guy like Tom 

1821
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:41,291
Cruise,
it's kind of undeniable that that guy is

1822
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:42,230
very successful,
very driven.

1823
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:43,760
Motivated,
right?

1824
01:26:44,330 --> 01:26:49,330
Yeah.
But don't forget it wasn't just 

1825
01:26:49,330 --> 01:26:50,060
scientology that did it for him.
He is a talented individual.

1826
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:55,061
I remember the first one he did about,
he was a kid at the valley forge 

1827
01:26:55,061 --> 01:26:55,061
military academy.
I forget what it's called.

1828
01:26:55,061 --> 01:26:56,540
That taps.
Taps.

1829
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:58,550
Yeah.
When I shot that at that man,

1830
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:01,490
I liked this guy ponyboy movie too,
right?

1831
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:05,720
The fuck was that called outsiders?
It's great actor.

1832
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:10,910
Yeah,
and he did one with Paul Newman where 

1833
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:10,910
he's a bull shark.
Remember the color of money?

1834
01:27:10,910 --> 01:27:11,750
One of my favorite movies.
No,

1835
01:27:11,751 --> 01:27:14,450
I mean there's no two ways.
Your body and individually.

1836
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:15,890
I mean,
I met him many times.

1837
01:27:15,891 --> 01:27:18,980
He's a nice guy,
so let us.

1838
01:27:19,070 --> 01:27:24,070
Does he have any knowledge of all this 
stuff when he sees all this 

1839
01:27:24,070 --> 01:27:25,490
disconnection and if he's a nice guy,
why does it need to step in and go,

1840
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:27,290
hey dave,
we got to fucking cut this shit.

1841
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:29,660
Listen,
I can't imagine that.

1842
01:27:29,661 --> 01:27:32,300
He doesn't know about it.
I can't imagine it.

1843
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:35,210
And so he just like a guy like you 
separated from your family.

1844
01:27:35,211 --> 01:27:37,880
It's beyond his control.
It's with lrap.

1845
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,370
Never do anything to go against.

1846
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:41,420
Dave,
why is that?

1847
01:27:41,810 --> 01:27:45,530
He continues to David to be the top 
spiritual being on this planet.

1848
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,670
Look at their.
Saluted each other.

1849
01:27:46,820 --> 01:27:48,410
Yup.
That's Jesus.

1850
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:51,440
That's at the event.
Are they in the military?

1851
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,210
Pardon me?
Are they in the military?

1852
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:58,040
Are they know why they knew each other?
Just curious.

1853
01:27:58,190 --> 01:28:01,010
Fuck's going on and when I see you in 
the morning,

1854
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:02,690
I want to.
We're saluting from now on.

1855
01:28:02,691 --> 01:28:04,340
We're going to salute each other.
Fuck it.

1856
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,130
If he could do it.
Yeah.

1857
01:28:06,290 --> 01:28:08,180
How does that work?
Could anybody salute anybody?

1858
01:28:08,181 --> 01:28:10,520
Is that rude?
Is it like cultural appropriation?

1859
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:12,890
Like a person walking around with the 
Pocahontas outfit on?

1860
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:14,510
People get mad at,
you know,

1861
01:28:14,511 --> 01:28:17,550
anybody can shoot another person.
You might see somebody going up from the

1862
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:18,350
plane and say,
hey,

1863
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:23,780
have a good trip.
But you would do it like almost a 

1864
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:23,780
throwaway Chica.
Yes.

1865
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:23,780
Yes.

1866
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:24,090
Hey,
you fucking way you.

1867
01:28:24,110 --> 01:28:25,010
I love you.
Okay.

1868
01:28:25,011 --> 01:28:30,011
So the,
the sheehy organization is a military 

1869
01:28:30,011 --> 01:28:33,820
type organization and you would solute 
in the middle of non-ironic,

1870
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:37,160
saluting outside of the military to 
seems awful.

1871
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:38,250
Odd.
Yeah.

1872
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:43,980
And you know,
well there's a lot of things John about 

1873
01:28:43,980 --> 01:28:47,741
it,
but for whatever reason it kept on 

1874
01:28:47,741 --> 01:28:50,231
going.
And while I think that's one of the 

1875
01:28:50,231 --> 01:28:50,510
reasons why that man right there,
Tom Cruise.

1876
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,190
Oh yeah.
People look at him and go,

1877
01:28:52,191 --> 01:28:53,410
this guy's in it.
And he's a winner.

1878
01:28:53,940 --> 01:28:56,910
Well now here's what l Ron Hubbard said 
that if you,

1879
01:28:57,010 --> 01:29:01,740
we should get a celebrity gin because 
they are opinion leaders

1880
01:29:02,280 --> 01:29:04,140
and what do you do with an opinion 
leader?

1881
01:29:04,410 --> 01:29:06,600
You want to be like that person.
Right?

1882
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:09,360
And if an opinion leader is a 
scientologist,

1883
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,840
I'm going to try this out.
I'm going to try what scientology was.

1884
01:29:12,841 --> 01:29:16,170
John Travolta like very nice guy.
Seems like a nice guy.

1885
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:21,830
He's literally a nice guy.
And so there's something those guys are 

1886
01:29:21,871 --> 01:29:23,460
getting out of it.
Yeah.

1887
01:29:23,461 --> 01:29:26,280
John Travolta and Kirstie alley and 
people like that.

1888
01:29:26,281 --> 01:29:31,281
They get,
they get auditing and they get pampered 

1889
01:29:31,281 --> 01:29:33,211
and enough to follow money rules.
So for them it's almost like they're a 

1890
01:29:33,211 --> 01:29:35,910
part of like a gang or something.
You're in a clinic,

1891
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:39,220
you're in a clergy.
Everybody kisses your ass is.

1892
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:41,760
Nobody wants to Piss you off if you get 
pissed off.

1893
01:29:41,761 --> 01:29:43,680
Like Leah.
Well with Leah,

1894
01:29:43,950 --> 01:29:48,950
she saw she had go on and shelly was not
there with David when you were at Tom 

1895
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:53,870
Cruise's wedding and she said to Tommy 
Davis where Shelly and Tommy Davis has.

1896
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,720
Listen,
you don't have the fucking ranked as 

1897
01:29:59,720 --> 01:29:59,720
that question.
Oh,

1898
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,630
you gotta get a higher rank.
I thought that was a figure of speech.

1899
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:03,480
That was a figure of speech.
If he would've said,

1900
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,240
look at Shelly's off doing a correction 
program.

1901
01:30:06,241 --> 01:30:10,260
That's why she's not here.
Leah might still be in scientology.

1902
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:12,810
So correction program was shelly fucked 
up.

1903
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:18,260
That's right.
And it and everybody in scientology 

1904
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:18,390
knows.
Sometimes sea org member isn't seeing if

1905
01:30:18,391 --> 01:30:18,840
you say,
well,

1906
01:30:18,841 --> 01:30:20,130
doing it,
doing a correction program.

1907
01:30:20,131 --> 01:30:20,640
They'd go,
oh,

1908
01:30:20,641 --> 01:30:22,830
okay.
That will be it.

1909
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:27,240
So they.
The mistake was they disrespected Leah.

1910
01:30:28,390 --> 01:30:31,430
She's very fiery,
not a little bit really fired.

1911
01:30:31,740 --> 01:30:33,630
She's from Brooklyn.
She's very fiery.

1912
01:30:33,660 --> 01:30:35,950
She's a great person.
She's.

1913
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:41,920
You know how I met Leah hundred meter.
I was in celebrity center in what's 

1914
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:45,960
called the president's office and I was 
there for some event many years ago.

1915
01:30:45,990 --> 01:30:48,090
Is there an election that.

1916
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:50,010
No.
So how does someone get to be president?

1917
01:30:50,490 --> 01:30:55,490
No,
it's just you're given the post of the 

1918
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:55,490
president of that organization.
Okay.

1919
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:59,410
It's just granted now Leah comes walking
out of this room and she said,

1920
01:31:00,780 --> 01:31:02,940
I got the part.
I said,

1921
01:31:02,941 --> 01:31:04,230
what do you mean you got the part?
She's,

1922
01:31:04,250 --> 01:31:06,640
I got the part.
It says,

1923
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:08,130
who are you?
She says,

1924
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:13,131
my name is Leah.
I got the part in this new show called 

1925
01:31:13,131 --> 01:31:13,131
the king of Queens.
Hey,

1926
01:31:13,131 --> 01:31:13,920
congratulations.
Your neighbor.

1927
01:31:13,921 --> 01:31:15,150
A hug.
That's how I met her.

1928
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:20,750
They,
she got the part and we've been good 

1929
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:23,451
buddies ever since.
I met her real close to that time as 

1930
01:31:23,451 --> 01:31:23,451
well.
Yeah,

1931
01:31:23,451 --> 01:31:24,990
I'm good buddies with Kevin James.
Oh.

1932
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,920
And Kevin James was obviously the leader
of the king queens and uh,

1933
01:31:28,980 --> 01:31:32,280
he's a standup comic.
We came up together and uh,

1934
01:31:32,370 --> 01:31:34,020
you know,
I'd always a.

1935
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:39,080
I was like,
what is he a scientologist or something 

1936
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:39,080
as a gas?

1937
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:39,470
It's all focused.
A little scientology.

1938
01:31:39,530 --> 01:31:40,920
Shitty goes on,
get fucking high.

1939
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:41,760
He goes,
yeah,

1940
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:43,470
but he's a funny man.
I use it very funny.

1941
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:44,910
Very funny.
Hilarious.

1942
01:31:44,970 --> 01:31:46,030
Yeah.
Um,

1943
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:47,120
and he just was like,
Ugh,

1944
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:49,140
I don't know what the fuck is going on.
That was it.

1945
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,270
We didn't talk about it.
She didn't talk about it.

1946
01:31:51,570 --> 01:31:52,300
I know.
And,

1947
01:31:52,460 --> 01:31:56,310
and the show went on no matter what.
A great show.

1948
01:31:56,910 --> 01:32:01,910
I enjoy it and I watch very little TV.
That was a show and I could pick it up 

1949
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:05,851
anytime and watch it.
Another thing I can watch is the eagles 

1950
01:32:05,851 --> 01:32:06,810
beaten the giant meltdown at the 
meadowlands.

1951
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,230
I don't really ever see that.
No,

1952
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:10,570
but eagles are down with three 
touchdowns.

1953
01:32:10,571 --> 01:32:12,670
They come back and winning the last 13 
seconds.

1954
01:32:13,150 --> 01:32:15,520
I'm originally from Pennsylvania.
Okay.

1955
01:32:15,521 --> 01:32:17,110
You're reminiscing now.
Is that what's going on here?

1956
01:32:18,270 --> 01:32:20,990
A little change of pace.

1957
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,560
You break the tension.
There's no tension.

1958
01:32:23,590 --> 01:32:24,730
I know that.
So listen,

1959
01:32:24,731 --> 01:32:26,440
Ron,
good luck with this book.

1960
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,290
It's called ruthless.
People can get it everywhere.

1961
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:32,860
You know?
I'm an eternal optimist and I would hope

1962
01:32:32,861 --> 01:32:37,861
that one day you'd be able to speak to 
your kids and one day he'd be able to 

1963
01:32:37,861 --> 01:32:37,960
speak to your son and everybody could 
work this out,

1964
01:32:37,990 --> 01:32:42,990
but I would hope for the same thing and 
I guess I'm starting to lose a hope on 

1965
01:32:45,701 --> 01:32:48,250
that matter because it's the years are 
going by now.

1966
01:32:48,251 --> 01:32:53,251
I've been out for like five years and I 
don't know what's going to change it 

1967
01:32:53,251 --> 01:32:56,320
other than maybe enough people speaking 
out and then dropping that disconnection

1968
01:32:56,330 --> 01:32:58,270
politic to Tom Cruise.
Tom Cruise.

1969
01:32:58,271 --> 01:33:00,160
Holler at me.
Let's do a podcast buddy.

1970
01:33:00,161 --> 01:33:02,410
Come on in here.
Let's trait in this whole shit out.

1971
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:03,850
Yeah.
Thank you Ron.

1972
01:33:03,851 --> 01:33:04,540
Appreciate it,
buddy.

1973
01:33:04,570 --> 01:33:05,590
Okay.
Thank you.

1974
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:06,820
Hey,
thanks a lot for having me.

1975
01:33:06,821 --> 01:33:11,821
My pleasure traded.
How long were we on.
