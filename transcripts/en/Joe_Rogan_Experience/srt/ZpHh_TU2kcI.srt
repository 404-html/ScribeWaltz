1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:05,070
You know, we're early. I
got a tweet this Brian,

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,400
because we're early.
So while we're on the air,

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,850
I'm going to tweet because
at the beginning of this
shit, no one's audit. Anyway.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:16,620
Who's the first sponsor? Uh, why don't you
talk about, uh, your, your, your website.

5
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:19,020
Why don't you plug desk
squad. Dot TV, Brian.

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,780
Okay, I'm doing this. Hey Desk. Got
that TV. We do a bunch of podcasts.

7
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,690
We did one with Kevin Pereira.
We deal with Dan Tiara, mine.

8
00:00:25,691 --> 00:00:29,650
We do it with a bunch of people and they
have different podcasts. Comic book,

9
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:32,710
podcast, video game podcast, and
you can find them all@deathsquad.tv.

10
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,700
We're also going to be at the Avn, uh,
next week with Sam Tripoli's Naddie show.

11
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,970
And that's Thursday night.
And you to get it in on that.

12
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:43,150
You just get one of the AVN passes
at that vinyl. It's a new nightclub.

13
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:43,984
It's going to be fun.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,050
We're gonna have a lot of people there
and we have live shows all the time.

15
00:00:47,051 --> 00:00:50,020
We have them almost every Friday here
at the ice house. Uh, we have, um,

16
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:53,800
we have a new one that's coming up at
an Improv later this month on Melrose.

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,620
And so good death squad. Dot. T,

18
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,300
lots of fun shows. Really funny
comics always. Um, if you,

19
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:02,450
if you see him on a desk squad show
for sure they're funny. And uh, the,

20
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:05,720
the t shirts that you see everybody
wearing those desk squad, cat tee shirts,

21
00:01:05,721 --> 00:01:09,660
those are also available on desk
squad diff. got.tv. I say that,

22
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:12,770
that goes Christ enough. Um, and uh,

23
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:15,050
so go there and support and uh,

24
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:19,250
also were brought to you by [inaudible]
dot com that's o n n I t don't go to oh

25
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:22,720
and it because it's a totally
different company and a, I dunno,

26
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,810
it's like they like cell banks or some
shit like that. But uh, what we sell,

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,960
we sell manly shit son. Okay.
Kettlebells, battle ropes,

28
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,330
extreme kettlebell Carrio DVDs,

29
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,150
hemp protein vitamins and supplements,

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:39,620
all essentially stuff that I use if we
find out there's anything really cool out

31
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:43,400
there, we tried to sell it.
Um, that's, that's a, I think
a good philosophy to have.

32
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,760
One of the newest additions
is the BLENDTEC blender.

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,520
So when you might've seen
online blending I iPhones,

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,270
you could literally can blend an iPhone
with this thing. It's, it's amazing. Uh,

35
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,430
but it's fantastic for a,
for shakes,

36
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,270
for protein shakes or Kale
shakes or for bulletproof coffee.

37
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,020
Neil degrasse Tyson does not know
about the bulletproof coffee.

38
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
We'll have to educate him. It was
very important stuff. But, uh,

39
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:10,790
all that stuff is available. Uh, like,
uh, the, uh, the, the upgraded coffee,

40
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,820
Dave Asprey's stuff we found out about it,
so we started carrying it.

41
00:02:13,821 --> 00:02:16,580
It's awesome. Killer bee
honey. Why killer bee honey?

42
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:19,640
Because it sounds cool to have
is the only reason to have,

43
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:21,500
I'm sure it's no better
than regular honey. In fact,

44
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,210
it's probably worse than regular honey,

45
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:26,720
but it sounds gangster as fuck to
have killer bee honey in your house.

46
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,970
So that's why I have it. And
that's why we sell it. And it's a,

47
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,730
a company that is a,

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,240
is as ethical as is possible
and still run a business.

49
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,190
There's an all the supplements,

50
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:41,960
there is a 100% money back guarantee
of the first 30 pills for 90 days.

51
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,850
After you buy it for 90 days,
you can try it,

52
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
try whether it's Alpha brain
or whether it's shroom tech.

53
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,950
You can read the science
behind all of this,

54
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,130
all of it and on it and if you have any
questions about it, there's, there's,

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,460
there's always someone who can answer
questions about that on, on, on forums,

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,580
but the most important thing is
if you don't feel like it works,

57
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,550
you get your back.
You don't even have to return the product.

58
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,720
No one's trying to rip you off.

59
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,190
Use a cone named Brogan and you'll
save 10% off any and all supplements.

60
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,230
All Right, that's o. N N.
I T. Brian. Cue The music

61
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,230
experience.

62
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,330
Without that it would not be official.
Neil Tyson,

63
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,360
thank you very much for coming on here,
man. This is an honor. This is a blast.

64
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,220
I think the universe is going to explode.

65
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:32,520
You are for sure the most requested
podcast guest ever in the history of this

66
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,701
podcast.

67
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:38,050
So Brian and I had been doing this for
three years and we have come full cycle

68
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,610
with your appearance here today.
I have,

69
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,750
I felt the magnetic force of your
fan base pulling me in. You share,

70
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,400
that wasn't what the
Mayans were talking about.

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,950
Should that wasn't the universe aligning.

72
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,140
I was so happy when I saw you do this.
Uh, I forget what the interview was,

73
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:56,680
but someone was talking
about the alignment of the
stars and the galaxies the

74
00:03:56,681 --> 00:04:00,310
first time and you're like, no, it happens
all the time. It happens every year.

75
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,090
I told my friend Eddie Bravo,
who's a beautiful human being,

76
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:08,050
but he loves himself a conspiracy theory.
He loves that. When I told him, I go,

77
00:04:08,051 --> 00:04:12,620
dude, Neil Tyson says it's bullshit. He
goes like this. Oh, okay. Well, yeah,

78
00:04:12,621 --> 00:04:13,454
probably bullshit.

79
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:18,630
I don't want the authority of my academic
pedigree to be what makes it bullshit,

80
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,030
right? I mean it's, it's, I want
you to, I want to give people,

81
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:26,920
I want to arm people intellectually so
that they can then deduce that there's

82
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:30,410
nothing to it. So when someone says
planets are going to align and earth,

83
00:04:30,411 --> 00:04:35,320
there's going to die, I want to encourage
them to ask, how often do planets align?

84
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:37,780
And then you get the answer every year.

85
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,650
So you don't even have to do the
calculation. It's that shallow.

86
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:46,651
I'm sort of a interest in a subject where
it only allows you to regurgitate the

87
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:50,940
really juicy shit you heard
about the planetary alignment is,

88
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,830
which is so dangerous because when people,
when people are bullshitting,

89
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,600
which is most of the
conversations we get into,

90
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,960
we don't get into serious
academic discussions with
people who've actually done

91
00:04:58,961 --> 00:05:02,620
the homework. He just bullshit with
a dude at work and he's like, yeah,

92
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:04,900
I heard the fucking planets
are gonna Align. And just like,

93
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,420
I don't even know what's going to
happen. And you're like, Whoa, what?

94
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,290
And you go back to your cubicle
shitting your pants, calling his eye.

95
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,460
The planet's gonna fucking
align to something going
to happen. That's gonna. I,

96
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,560
I tweeted recently that if you're
really successful at bullshitting,

97
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,950
it means you don't hang around enough
people who are smarter than you.

98
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:25,000
That's a very good point. That's
a very good point. Um, you know,

99
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:30,001
I think one of the cool things about you
and your approach to science is I think

100
00:05:30,611 --> 00:05:34,570
it's very refreshing that if
someone doesn't know something,

101
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,030
you're not condescending about it.
You're,

102
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:40,540
you're very enthusiastic about
distributing the information,

103
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,060
but you're not casting a
judgment while you do that.

104
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:48,061
And that is something that I think has
freaked a lot of people out about really

105
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:51,370
intelligent people or
scientists or someone who talks
about anything where they

106
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:52,420
have no experiences.

107
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,380
This is a sort of a condescending sort
of a caring of that knowledge that you

108
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:59,750
don't have. You make a really
important point. And I, you know,

109
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,020
there's the anti intellectual
movement in society and,

110
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,120
and I don't blame them
entirely for feeling that way
because we all know people,

111
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:12,260
I have many colleagues where you try
to hang out with them and they make you

112
00:06:12,261 --> 00:06:15,530
feel bad for not knowing what they know.
And if that's what, if that's your,

113
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,100
if that's how you interact with people,
why would anyone want to be that?

114
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,780
It's a problem of associating with
shitty characters. Like they're like,

115
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:27,650
they're not fun to be around and
unfortunately you're associating something

116
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:30,200
that's incredible. Like the, the,

117
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,780
the actual measurement
of the universe itself.

118
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,900
You're associating that
with annoying people.

119
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,050
You've got to detach the content from
the deliverer of the information.

120
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,940
I dated a girl and she loved,
uh, Duran Duran. Okay. What else?

121
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,670
In high school and uh, you know,
after the breakup, which always has,

122
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:49,130
and every high school relationship,
that was eight 80, very eighties.

123
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:53,000
I remember it was like, Fuck Duran
Duran, man taranda rents sucks.

124
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,470
I could not enjoy their music because I
associate it with this young, late, oh,

125
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,920
you know, psychologically
scarred. Fuck myself.

126
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:05,000
I couldn't enjoy hungry like the
wolf, bad boys, all those classics.

127
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,690
I removed them from the menu because
this one chick, but that, that,

128
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:12,800
that can happen with music that
you actually would enjoy. Well,

129
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,140
forget about like mathematics, right?
Right. If it, yeah, if it happens with,

130
00:07:16,141 --> 00:07:20,540
with that, it can happen with everything
up the ladder from there. Right, right,

131
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,810
right. You are your very important, I
don't know if you know how important,

132
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:27,660
like the cool guy scientist is.
I can't tell you how many times.

133
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,340
So I have evidence of
how important that is.

134
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,510
I can't tell you how many emails I've
gotten or like tweets or they say,

135
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:41,410
people say that there's a guy who's like
seriously geeked and his girlfriend is

136
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:47,780
not interested in him and he says what
he does and then shows her videos of me

137
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,380
celebrating the universe and she
says, Oh, is that what you do? Oh,

138
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,130
they resurrect the relationship because
she then sees the potential for watch

139
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:01,130
the guy can do. That's
fascinating. Wow. Yeah.

140
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:03,560
It's like by any means necessary,
whatever it takes,

141
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,400
whatever it takes every
takes to stimulate.

142
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:08,780
So I'm happy to glue people back
together if that's, if that's what it,

143
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,770
what matters here.
Well,

144
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:14,630
you were the very most important person
when it came to the 2012 movement,

145
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,320
because I was talking to Sony
knuckleheads. I had a guy on the,

146
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:19,710
remember Pinchbeck I was on the show,

147
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,930
it's something's
definitely going to happen.

148
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,450
It's like he's quoting all these reasons
why things are gonna happen. I'm like,

149
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:26,200
people love them. Some end
of the world. I mean that's,

150
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:31,910
I was at a party and the person learned
that I was an astrophysicist and walked

151
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:34,040
up to me and I hear you're
an astro fan. I said, yes is,

152
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,230
and tell me if this is
like a year ago, right? Uh,

153
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,610
here in the rule is going to end in
2012 and then I explained why it's not.

154
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:45,820
He walked away dejected
and I said to myself, what,

155
00:08:45,821 --> 00:08:49,250
what is like there's some people
are only happy when they're sad.

156
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,650
There's a thing where people are trying
to uncover mysteries and it becomes more

157
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:57,720
important, the actual mysteries
of the universe itself.

158
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:01,410
And you can do simple statistics on this.
So for example,

159
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,440
the world has been here for like billions
of years and you think it's going to

160
00:09:04,441 --> 00:09:08,040
end in your lifetime. That's
awfully humoristic of Youtube. Yeah,

161
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,440
that's pretty bold.
And even if it does,

162
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:13,410
your world's going to end eventually
anyway. I mean, you're really,

163
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,740
it's so silly to delink fixate on.

164
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,710
So what I think the most effective,
uh,

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,190
encouragement I gave people during the,
the,

166
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,590
the Mayan non catastrophe was I said,
all right,

167
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:28,590
between now and December
20th just convinced the,

168
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:33,090
your Mayan catastrophe people to sign
over all their assets into your name.

169
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:38,130
That's what's really crazy. Very
simple. If they don't do it,

170
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:39,690
they don't really believe
what they're saying.

171
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,600
They don't believe you
get fabulously wealthy.

172
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,540
They're not going to give you
that cash. Yeah, no one, well,

173
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:50,430
I'm sure some people did go nutty and
like set up shelters and the desert and go

174
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:53,860
underground and all that. There's a lot
of people that went nutty. Well, every, I,

175
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,700
I've, I did a little research
on this about every 10 years.

176
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,840
Somebody comes up with an end of the
world scenario and you keep in mind that

177
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:04,800
end of the world scenarios, no one says
the world's going to end in 150 years.

178
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,550
Right,
right.

179
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,240
It doesn't work because you can't get
gain adherence to your cult that you're

180
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:09,631
building.

181
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:13,800
It's got to be kind of immediate but
far enough in the future so that you can

182
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:17,310
prepare but near enough so that you're
not going to forget about it at any time.

183
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,940
And it's really good if you can base it
on some old shit and very few people can

184
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:24,570
read and everybody thinks that the old
folks really understood the universe when

185
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:27,000
in fact they did not. Well, they
understood the little bit of it.

186
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:30,240
But to say that they knew more about
the fate of the cosmos than modern day

187
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:33,390
astrophysics,
you must've flunked your math class,

188
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:36,660
your physics classes or
something to think that way.

189
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,790
I don't understand what goes,
what's going on in those mines.

190
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:42,660
It's the same sort of thinking that
the same thinking that wants to uncover

191
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:46,920
mysteries and conspiracies. There's uh,
there's, it's a weird excitement too,

192
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:51,320
like hidden things. Now you are a
moon guy for awhile. Listen, my,

193
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,210
my issues with not believing
that people went on the moon.

194
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,860
A lot of it had to do with a friend who
had an uncle who worked at Rocketdyne

195
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,680
and uh, this guy was convinced
that there was no way to do it.

196
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:05,160
He was an engineer and he said they were
so far away from doing it that the fact

197
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,930
that they did it and
they did it seven times.

198
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,850
But I since looking at it,
that the weight of all the evidence,

199
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,500
I reserve the possibility that some
things were horseshit based on a lot of

200
00:11:16,501 --> 00:11:20,190
photographic evidence that they did fuck
with. Well, here's the Gemini Photo,

201
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,080
but here it is here.
Here it is.

202
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,700
If you look at like the fuel that was
loaded up into the Saturn five rocket,

203
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,610
you can calculate where that
fuel could take that rocket.

204
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,900
It's to the moon and back.

205
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:35,640
So it's not going to the Piggly
wiggly in the Saturn five. No,

206
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:36,850
I'm a retard it. Listen, if,

207
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:40,830
if anybody has any real sense,

208
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,130
they would look at it and say,
there's no way that that was a hoax.

209
00:11:44,131 --> 00:11:46,230
There's no way,
but it would be harder.

210
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,460
You'd see people think it was actually
hard to get to the moon. Yes. It was hard.

211
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,640
It was hard, certainly. But it
would have been harder to hoax it.

212
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,080
Yes, it today. But the thing
about hoaxing things back then,

213
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:03,460
the thing that was so compelling to me
was that hoaxing things back then was

214
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,780
really sort of way they did it.

215
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,360
I mean that's how they got into the
Gulf of Tonkin. That the horror stories.

216
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,460
Yeah, there was a lot of fakery
going on back and you're faking news.

217
00:12:12,461 --> 00:12:15,670
The height of the Cold War when
there was a lot of reasons why I, I,

218
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,680
I thought some fuckery was afoot
not and especially all these goddamn

219
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,870
documentaries.
Okay,

220
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:25,420
so you say you felt justified just
because of the landscape in which other

221
00:12:25,421 --> 00:12:26,320
things had been happening,

222
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,620
Dan and visual stuff like that was the
decade where we lost confidence in our

223
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:31,870
government.
That was well for good reason.

224
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,010
I mean it was proven with Watergate
and it was proven over and over. No,

225
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,500
about the Gulf of Tonkin incident
over and over and over and over.

226
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:39,111
It was damaged.

227
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:44,050
And the idea that they were able to do
that in 1969 but haven't been able to

228
00:12:44,051 --> 00:12:45,240
repeat it since,
of course,

229
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,120
makes it even more delicious and it
makes him even more conspiratorial

230
00:12:49,121 --> 00:12:52,270
attractive. Um, and then
the fact that the, uh,

231
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,020
the rock that they had given to Holland
turned out to be a piece of petrified

232
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:59,600
wood. You know, there's
a lot of weirdness to,

233
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,470
to the moon landing conspiracy.
And there was a lot of,

234
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,850
not just the people that
were alike that admired it,

235
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:08,650
but it was almost like a religious thing.

236
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,730
My friend called it a technological
Jesus. He said that if you, if you,

237
00:13:12,731 --> 00:13:14,290
if anything is scientific,

238
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,810
you should be able to question it
and someone would give you an answer.

239
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,990
But there's a bit of a motion
and attachment and pride
with certain historical

240
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,340
accomplishments.
Like one of them being the moon landing,

241
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:28,740
that forbid people from actually
questioned went beyond science. It wasn't,

242
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:31,960
it was a cultural achievement.
Every Clinton's quote, what was it?

243
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,720
Clinton Clinton wrote a book.
Um, my life went in, man,

244
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,000
not George. Let's build a guy who was
the president, can George Clinton,

245
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:44,170
that's the other guy. That's his
opinion is equally valid by the two.

246
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:48,500
Very different Quinton's yeah.
Uh, I'll find it here for you.

247
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:52,090
Was it in his book? My Life? Yeah. I
was in his book and it was a, it was,

248
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,860
it was all on the, um, uh, the,

249
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:00,430
the time where when it happened he was
working with a carpenter. So, well,

250
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:01,450
why you looking at it? I, well,

251
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,390
the way I reflect on people who
say we didn't go to the moon,

252
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I say what a compliment it
is of our emerging culture,

253
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,810
technological culture,

254
00:14:10,811 --> 00:14:15,811
that they're members of our society that
are so impressed with what we achieved

255
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,240
that they can't believe it. Well, yeah,

256
00:14:19,241 --> 00:14:24,241
I take it as a compliment that people
stand dumbstruck Austrac that it be,

257
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,440
it is beyond their cat
capacity to believe it.

258
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,630
I don't think it's beyond
the capacity to believe it.

259
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,790
I think if you had shown
them, you know, uh,

260
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:37,050
documentaries that didn't have any of the
stuff that was in the shit that I saw,

261
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,210
whether it was we did the moon,
did we go where there's another one,

262
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:41,560
a funny thing happened
on the way to the moon,

263
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,630
whether his show over and over again,

264
00:14:43,631 --> 00:14:47,470
all this fucked up footage and it's
very confusing to a non scientifically

265
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:52,340
minded person. You can get on a long
downward spiral. And this Quinten Clo,

266
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
that Clinton quote,
this Fox with me,

267
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,420
just a month before Apollo 11 astronauts
buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong had left

268
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:02,650
their colleague Michael Collins,
uh,

269
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,990
aboard spaceship Columbia and walked
on the moon beating by five months.

270
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,260
President Kennedy's goal of putting a
man on the moon before the end of the

271
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:16,340
decade. The old carpenter asked me if
I believed it happened. I said, sure.

272
00:15:16,341 --> 00:15:18,800
I saw it on television and he disagreed.

273
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:21,260
He said that he didn't
believe it for a minute.

274
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,340
That those television fellers can make
things look real that weren't back then.

275
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,370
I thought he was a crank during
my eight years in Washington.

276
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,440
I saw some things on TV that
made me wonder if he wasn't
ahead of his time. Yeah.

277
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:37,940
Look a mess. It's horrible quote to hear
from the president of the United States.

278
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,750
If you're a confused young man and you
think we may be didn't land on the moon,

279
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,600
you read something like that and you go,
what the fuck does that mean?

280
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,000
People in total give the
government way more credit. Well,

281
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:53,960
for organized behavior then
they actually ever deserve.

282
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,320
So I think they believe the
government killed Kennedy.

283
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,320
And I think a lot of people believe that
if they did that they could kind of do

284
00:16:00,321 --> 00:16:03,800
a lot of things. Yeah. I
mean so, okay. But you know,

285
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,310
science is going to move on while
you're arguing that and so yeah,

286
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:10,370
that's what we, there's a point where you
just say, all right, I got to move on.

287
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:14,030
That's the other thing that makes a
conspiracy so juicy is that science didn't

288
00:16:14,031 --> 00:16:16,190
move on when it came to
man's space landings.

289
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,470
That was the end of the engineering of it.
Yeah.

290
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,150
It was the political will if money
at that level. Right. And, and,

291
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,200
and what's,

292
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,770
what all conspiracy theories have in
common is that there's a point where you

293
00:16:27,771 --> 00:16:32,771
have to bridge a gap in the absence of
actual data and assertion gets laced upon

294
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:39,380
it to satisfy the,
the claim that it's a con.

295
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:43,430
It's a conspiracy theory.
So you say, well, well, uh,
they say, well, this is true.

296
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,264
And that's true.

297
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,450
And the only way they can both be true
is if this is covered up in between. So,

298
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,180
so somebody always has to say
there's a coverup when it,

299
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,550
but when there's actual
knowledge about the world,

300
00:16:52,551 --> 00:16:54,590
nobody has to talk about
covered up information.

301
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,670
It's just there and writ large and
ready to be absorbed and embraced.

302
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,770
I agree with you.
The,

303
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:05,790
the reason why the moon theory is so juicy
for people is because there's so much

304
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,530
of this stuff that you could point to.

305
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:11,400
And so much of it that looks
like evidence of Fuckery,

306
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,200
you know, whether it's the,
we'll take for example, the,

307
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:17,400
the assertion that the photos
from the moon lunar surface,

308
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,550
since the moon has no atmosphere
than a daytime picture.

309
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,530
If you're there in the
daytime and the moon,

310
00:17:22,531 --> 00:17:27,450
you see a full night night sky of stars,
even with the sun in the sky as well.

311
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,530
You don't see stars in the daytime on
earth and not because they're not there,

312
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,880
but because the atmosphere is a glow
with scattered light from the sun.

313
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,670
If you take away the atmosphere,
the sun will still be there,

314
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,050
but the sky goes dark.

315
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,710
That's what the folks get when they go
to the edge of the atmosphere and the

316
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:46,410
calling that the edge of space. But when
you get to the edge of the atmosphere,

317
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,840
the atmosphere is no longer
between you and the rest of the,

318
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,800
and the stars revealed themselves
just as they would at night.

319
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,200
So everyone knew this,

320
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,840
so you'd see these photos from the moon
and there's Neil and buzz and the land

321
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,620
air and there are no stars in the sky.
It's just dark and they'll say,

322
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:09,120
see, it's fake butter and these are
people who never taken photography.

323
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:09,870
All right?

324
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:14,160
If you are exposed for the bright
reflective light of the astronauts and the

325
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:14,994
lunar surface,

326
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:19,860
that camera exposure even in the hassle
bladder that they carry to the moon and

327
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:24,861
youth is too short to take in the dim
light from the stars of the night sky.

328
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,450
If you turn the camera to the sky a much
longer exposure with sensitive film,

329
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:34,050
you'll get the stars. But then you
overexpose the stuff in the foreground.

330
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:38,130
So photography one o one
answers that question,

331
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,560
but huge websites given unto this.

332
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,770
And so what that told me was that people
simply wanted to believe that it was a

333
00:18:46,171 --> 00:18:51,171
hoax and then made all the information
fit that need without actually caring

334
00:18:52,711 --> 00:18:57,711
about the scientific truths that with
any evidence would disprove all of what

335
00:18:58,801 --> 00:19:02,700
they were thinking. So at that point I
said people just believe what they want.

336
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,380
And so my task was not to debate
wound hoaxers as an educator.

337
00:19:07,381 --> 00:19:11,550
My task is to get people thinking
straight in the first place so you're no

338
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:16,551
longer susceptible to the the kinds of
thinking where you become selective about

339
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:20,550
the data that you choose
to believe or you get.

340
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,110
You get duped by someone who's exploiting
the laws of physics for their own

341
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:29,610
financial gain. Excuse me.
They're exploiting your
ignorance of the financial,

342
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,220
of the laws of physics for
their own financial gain.

343
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:37,310
So I see science literacy as a kind of
vaccine against all of the world around

344
00:19:38,401 --> 00:19:41,220
you that would just simply
take advantage of your,

345
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,250
your goodwill and good
nature was certainly with,

346
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,270
with things that can be easily explained
like you're talking about the light and

347
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:51,560
the, the, the setting of the camera, all
that. That's what they lead with that.

348
00:19:51,561 --> 00:19:53,650
Then I explained that, oh well
then, okay, well then how about,

349
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,860
and they start going down a list and you
know, I'm done. Time to go to dinner,

350
00:19:56,861 --> 00:20:00,730
you know, so that that is a
huge problem where, you know,

351
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:05,410
and certainly when I watched my
first documentary on the Fox Moon,

352
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,820
the Fox one when the moon landing,

353
00:20:06,821 --> 00:20:10,600
it was a big with the moon did we go
and there was all sorts of compelling

354
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:12,130
evidence that was really weird,

355
00:20:12,131 --> 00:20:15,070
like photographs from
different spots in the moon,

356
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:18,910
but they had the same backdrop, you know,
and you know, and using the, you know,

357
00:20:18,911 --> 00:20:23,911
this idea that they had done these inside
some gigantic sound studio and when

358
00:20:23,921 --> 00:20:27,430
you see something like that on television,
you saw like Brian O'leary, who was a,

359
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,460
a an astro. And once again
it's on TV. Yeah. Of course.

360
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:34,870
Authority built into the medium and then
talking to this dude's uncle or a him

361
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:39,220
telling me is what his uncle
said. Actually it's just,
it was such a, you know, it,

362
00:20:39,221 --> 00:20:40,870
it's one of those things where you go,
okay,

363
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,300
we know they lied about
this and we know we lied.

364
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,520
They lied about that and they lie about
things. I'll get them in line. Yeah.

365
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,630
They'd have to,

366
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,240
the government have to lie as well as
10,000 scientists and engineers. I mean,

367
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:57,130
think about, think about
this. Just think about this.

368
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,940
We knew more of just if there were
ever a state secret that the government

369
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:06,874
wanted to keep,

370
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,650
it would be the behavior of
President Clinton's genitals.

371
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,290
Okay.
But that got out,

372
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:18,880
that got out and only
three people knew this.

373
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,740
Three.
All right.

374
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:25,570
You're going to hoax a moon landing by
telling 10,000 scientists and engineers

375
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:30,220
to keep it secret for 40 years. That's
not how humans behave. What was it?

376
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,740
Who's who was, was it
lemony Snicket who said, oh,

377
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:35,530
I forgot who the author was of
this quote. He said, the only,

378
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:40,030
the only way you can keep a secret between
two people is if one of them is dead.

379
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:42,910
But that's not true
militarily. I mean, we've,

380
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:46,330
we've kept kept big secrets for
long periods. You can keep sure,

381
00:21:46,331 --> 00:21:49,390
but really delectable secrets don't,
don't last you.

382
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,300
I can keep a secret that there's a
bunker that I'm going to run to. Sure.

383
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:57,520
But to keep a secret that like aliens
landed and there are DNA experimenting on

384
00:21:57,671 --> 00:22:01,230
it that would get out. That's
what people do. Stuff lesser,

385
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:04,030
less lesser stuff than that gets out.

386
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:09,400
Well you like when you hear things about
like area 51 and like the Robert Lasar

387
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,190
interviews. Have you ever
had any of that stuff? True.

388
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,450
Requires that you say someone is
keeping something a secret. So you know,

389
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:18,820
and I've lost buddies capable of keeping
secrets not on that level. Oh No.

390
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:24,130
Oh my gosh. I completely disagree. I
think that keep secret. Wait, wait.

391
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,240
Yes. I mean the one, the
quote with the one has to be
dead. That's an exaggeration.

392
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,590
But of course,
but beyond a certain number of people,

393
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,990
the conduct of human beings,

394
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:38,710
if the secret is really juicy and really,

395
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:42,040
really tantalizing, uh, I'd, I,

396
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:45,880
I think the 0% chance that that's likely,
I disagree.

397
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:49,240
There'd be diaries and there'd be like
people telling their families, you know,

398
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:52,870
like we didn't go to the moon and the no,

399
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:56,790
look at the secrets that get out. Yeah.
That they'll listen, listen to, I mean,

400
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,110
for sure. Most secrets get out. However,

401
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:02,620
I absolutely think it's completely
possible for people to keep secrets.

402
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,340
Actually that's a, it's an experiment
that you can't conduct, right.

403
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:10,600
To say cause make a fake. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no. The statement,

404
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,340
most secrets get out for all, you know,
that's 100% of the secrets it could go.

405
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:18,870
Yeah, you're right. It's just a
simple untestable fact. We'll do it.

406
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:21,520
Don't you have any secrets in your
past and you got away with, sure.

407
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:23,120
A lot of people got away
with some secrets. Yeah.

408
00:23:23,121 --> 00:23:26,350
But I didn't tell it to 10,000 people
and say keep it a secret. Well,

409
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,710
the idea is that if
you're talking about NASA,

410
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,900
the ideal about the moon landings where
they said it was compartmentalized and

411
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:35,430
you know, the, the, the big one is
that Stanley Kubrick was the, um,

412
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:38,110
there's actually a documentary,
a fascinating documentary. Again,

413
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,660
fucks with my head because
as I've always said,

414
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:43,120
it's terrifying when you too
stupid to know who's dumb.

415
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,130
And that is often where I find myself

416
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,030
when I'm watching these things.

417
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:51,740
And there was this documentary that
was a all about the different sort of,

418
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:55,190
uh,
techniques that Kubrick we used in 2001.

419
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,980
And how he changed pioneering.
Yeah.

420
00:23:57,981 --> 00:24:02,470
He had changed the way you
reshot gigantic scenes by, uh,

421
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:07,460
some new process called the,
something about front projection.

422
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,250
I think that was basically what, what
the, the, the name of the process.

423
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,610
And then he showed all the evidence of
front projection footage in the moon

424
00:24:13,611 --> 00:24:17,090
landings. And again, you're fucked
because you're sitting here and I don't,

425
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,480
you know, I'm looking at this, I'm like,
okay, well who's right here? Is this,

426
00:24:20,481 --> 00:24:24,350
what is, have you ever seen the video of
the astronauts on trampolines? No. No.

427
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,460
I never thought in my life that I
would be in the position to have a real

428
00:24:28,461 --> 00:24:31,220
astrophysicist watch a ridiculous video.

429
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,490
And so I want you to pull up astronauts
on trampolines. Bring this up. Okay.

430
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,580
He got to see it. It's beautiful.
I don't think I've seen it. Um,

431
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,170
it's astronauts and the,

432
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:46,040
the conspiracy is that they are either
on trampolines or they're on some sort of

433
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:50,240
a wire harness because of the way they're
moving and that they're moving behind

434
00:24:50,241 --> 00:24:51,980
the, uh, the Lunar Rover.

435
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,200
And that's to hide either the trampoline
or hide the, the movement of their feet,

436
00:24:57,201 --> 00:25:01,040
like the way the shot is positioned
and it's a motherfucker. I,

437
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:04,260
this one drives me bananas,
so shit playing.

438
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,620
I'm checking it out and watch this.

439
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
Doesn't that look bad guy?
He just got yanked up in the
air. Look, check this out.

440
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,580
380 pound guy.
That's pretty good.

441
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,160
This fell down.
Look at this.

442
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:41,563
Come on.

443
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,360
I mean obviously if you're a,

444
00:25:45,361 --> 00:25:48,930
a person who's not scientifically
inclined and you're prone to conspiracy

445
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,110
theories, guilty of both, and you
see something like that, you go,

446
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:55,440
what the fuck is going on there?
Is that really the moon?

447
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,420
Or they're really jumping around
like they're on trampolines.

448
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,870
It looks like it guys getting yanked
up by wires on the moon. Well,

449
00:26:00,871 --> 00:26:03,390
I'm just saying you look at the
trajectory of the Saturn five rocket,

450
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,950
so that's nice. That doesn't mean a
person was in it. When you watch that.

451
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:09,210
Doesn't that look weird though?

452
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,263
Well,

453
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,751
okay.

454
00:26:11,751 --> 00:26:14,180
You're saying if you don't know what the
laws of physics would be on the surface

455
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:16,430
of the moon, one, six gravity.
And when you're watching this,

456
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,040
doesn't that look weird to
you? Okay. So I understand. And

457
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,070
the, the house susceptible one can
be when you're confronted with,

458
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:28,240
uh, what is given as evidence.
Yes. Yes. And, and, and,

459
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:32,550
and if I don't otherwise come across that
way, I am sensitive to that, right. To,

460
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,860
to, to, uh, I'm, I'm, uh,

461
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,120
if you don't otherwise have the
tools to analyze information,

462
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,840
then then one is susceptible to all
manner of forces of thoughts that go on

463
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:53,070
around you. And like I say
that, but by then for me, it's,

464
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,740
I don't have the energy to
fight all of that, but I just,

465
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,840
I just teach people to how to think about
information and then I walk away and

466
00:27:00,841 --> 00:27:04,320
then they, they make a life of the
vote for, with it, whoever they want.

467
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:09,240
But they're there. They've got
intellectual defenses. And so,

468
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,930
uh, so that's how I, the other people
who take them on head to head, you know,

469
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:17,640
I like Michael Shermer big
skeptics and more power to him.

470
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,990
He's got the patience and the,

471
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:23,010
he's got good at analogies and goodwill
and he can present to you the evidence

472
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:26,090
that that psychological evidence
of why we're susceptible to this.

473
00:27:26,091 --> 00:27:29,430
He's got a whole book called why, why we
believe weird things. You know, I mean,

474
00:27:29,431 --> 00:27:30,610
that's uh, it's, it's,

475
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,390
you think it's weird to look at
the video and think it's looks odd.

476
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,660
It'd be weird if you otherwise
knew what it looked at.

477
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:43,911
A 33 story rocket filled with fuel
launch from Cape Canaveral took several

478
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:47,970
orbits around Earth,
went to the moon,

479
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:51,030
took pictures from the front side of
the moon, the backside of the moon,

480
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:55,230
images from the surface of the moon.
A week later it comes back.

481
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,460
An aircraft carrier goes into
the Pacific to pick up a,

482
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:04,290
a capsule out of the ocean.
People get out of the capsule,

483
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:07,050
get on the spacecraft.
The president meets them.

484
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:11,580
Life magazine writes profiles.
That's all emotional,

485
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,653
but it all built it.

486
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:16,290
Do you get to a certain plot just saying
it builds and then someone shows you a

487
00:28:16,291 --> 00:28:19,480
video and says, well maybe all of that
didn't, you know, that was all fake. Well,

488
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:23,210
you know, the idea is not even that at
all. Didn't happen. A lot of the, the,

489
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,360
the idea of proposing the
cubic documentary was that
the footage was fucked up

490
00:28:27,361 --> 00:28:30,570
and then they made a lot of extra
footage and then a lot of what you see is

491
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:33,720
faked footage where they were worried
that they weren't gonna be able to do it.

492
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,450
So they decided to fake it and
som to see if they could fake it.

493
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,240
That there was two schools of thought.
Okay, that's a whole other thing.

494
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,460
That's all I'm going to go.
But they just, but they,

495
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,930
they needed a movie director to
help out the, the view. Well,

496
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:48,870
they see, you ever see the,
the Michael Collins photos,

497
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:53,460
and these are really annoying, but I'll
show them to you where this was a Gemini,

498
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,870
Gemini 10 Joan, I tend spacewalk
but it wasn't really a space walk.

499
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,120
It was a simulation and they just blacked
out the background and used it as a

500
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,460
NASA uses it is like press clippings.

501
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:05,370
So when conspiracy people get
ahold of that, they go, ah,

502
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:09,090
it's probably just they needed a photo.
They didn't have one.

503
00:29:09,091 --> 00:29:11,880
The fucking guy really did
a space walk, uh, you know,

504
00:29:11,881 --> 00:29:15,130
and they just decided to just say,
just do a little fuckery. Just say,

505
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,280
say the guy's walking around space when
you closest photo on the shelf and then

506
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:23,690
pre Photoshop. So that's quite
a free photo. They painted
it. Right. So like you,

507
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:27,870
you see something like that with your
knowledge of physics and with your

508
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,660
understanding of vacuums in zero gravity,

509
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:34,080
that doesn't launch completely straight.
It's completely looks totally normal.

510
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,800
Well, yeah, it depends on how, how
quickly they return to the ground. I mean,

511
00:29:37,801 --> 00:29:42,790
these are, you have to sort
of judge that. And, uh, so,

512
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,080
uh, but you know, I'd want
to see more, I mean, it's,

513
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:50,260
this is a pretty tight shot and other
things wanted to look at how far away the

514
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:55,090
horizon is. The course earth is smaller,
the moon is smaller than earth. So,

515
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,920
uh,
I want to save dust was kicked up.

516
00:29:56,921 --> 00:30:01,120
And does the dust fall at the slower
rate that the astronaut falls?

517
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,360
I don't see the dust in this.
So I'd say this is not enough information.

518
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,990
If I thought it was cold presented
today, if somebody, because you can't,

519
00:30:07,991 --> 00:30:10,930
you can't put wires on dust.
Right, right. And, and, and,

520
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:15,150
and suspend the dust and have it descend
as slowly as an astronaut bounce. Right.

521
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:18,460
So you mean like the Lunar Rover
for dust? Well, yeah. Or what any,

522
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,440
every time they step the dust came up.
So,

523
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:25,500
so you'd look at all of these cues and
there's so many cues that would happen

524
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:30,660
naturally if it actually happened that
you'd have to think up and get perfectly

525
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:31,923
to,

526
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:36,290
to fool an expert who knows what
they're looking at if they know it.

527
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,110
That's why it had been easier to simply
go to the moon than to fake all of that.

528
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:44,320
That's my point. This is the one where it
looks like the guy gets yanked up by a,

529
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:47,410
why are we were seeing this? Check
this out. Oh, that's on the ground.

530
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,210
Yeah. He fell forward. And
just back up what people,

531
00:30:56,211 --> 00:30:59,990
I think especially, uh, people like myself
would have to wrap their heads around,

532
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,620
I guess is that this isn't just a vacuum,

533
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,650
but it's also a vacuum and one six earth
gravity side dealing with a completely

534
00:31:09,411 --> 00:31:13,450
alien environment. How much, so how much
do you weigh right now? One 91 nineties.

535
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:17,840
You packing it in there.
So how rude Neil Tyson,

536
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:20,420
just send them fat.
Don't let me show you my six pack on

537
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,550
the Budweiser on the side of
the table. How rude. Again,

538
00:31:26,330 --> 00:31:30,290
this is damaging to my
confidence. Uh, so yeah,

539
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:33,800
so you have muscles to accommodate
your hundred 90 pound. Fuck yeah, I do.

540
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:36,140
All right, so it's shit. So now,

541
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,790
so now let's add a 200 pound pack on.
You backpacked,

542
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,860
and now you weigh 400
pounds, right? Right. Well,

543
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,650
he said three 35 but I'll give
you that. Okay? Yeah, just round.

544
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,830
She sits around the set. Let's
get big round numbers. Okay.

545
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:52,940
So let's say you now weigh 420 pounds.

546
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:56,000
You're slugging your way. You're
sluggish here on earth, right?

547
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,230
I put you on the moon,

548
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,620
your muscles that normally are accustomed
to 190 pounds now are now are carrying

549
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,460
or maneuvering,

550
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:08,420
r, r, r, r, r, r,

551
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,100
uh, lighting, manipulating,
one sixth of 420 pounds,

552
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:18,430
which is 70 pounds,
right?

553
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,660
Imagine how awesome you would be, how
awesome you were. [inaudible] 70 pounds.

554
00:32:22,661 --> 00:32:27,340
If you have this musculature and you
weighed 70 pounds, you'd be superman.

555
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:28,870
You couldn't crack an egg dough.
You'd hit people,

556
00:32:28,871 --> 00:32:32,460
they'd laugh at you and you know,
you would be super,

557
00:32:32,461 --> 00:32:36,310
may have to have a really good tech. You
have pop up, you would just on your toes,

558
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:40,040
you'd, you'd jump to the
ceiling. So it's cool.

559
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,480
So what,
what I'm,

560
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,740
what I'm confusing is what would
happen in an earth's environment.

561
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,830
That's your life experience.
So this is the bias you bring to it.

562
00:32:48,831 --> 00:32:52,310
It's an understandable bias and that's
what makes the world that the moon and

563
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,480
other worldly place.

564
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,560
So 70 does down seats that literally you
literally could spring up as if you are

565
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,370
pulled by a court.
Good luck club.

566
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,250
You could swing better because the court
has to make you feel like you're 70

567
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:08,120
pounds, but now you are 70 pounds
so you just, you just do it.

568
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,970
I really enjoyed mythbusters
version of it. Um, they,

569
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:15,020
they went into depth about a flag waving
and I thought it was really fascinating

570
00:33:15,021 --> 00:33:15,830
to watch when the,

571
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:19,430
where they actually created a vacuum
and had the flag wave in a vacuum.

572
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,610
And it's a, it's weird
because it doesn't, you know,

573
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,240
we have an idea in our head of what
it looks like when a flag waves,

574
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:30,260
well that's obviously the wind moving
that flag, but there's wind here, there,

575
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:33,170
there's, there's nothing,
there's zero atmosphere.

576
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,090
Now when someone would run
by a flag in zero atmosphere,

577
00:33:38,091 --> 00:33:40,760
does it create any wind? Israel? Nothing.

578
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,470
So if a guy hops by a flag and
the flag blows in the breeze,

579
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,060
what's causing that? Is that a faked
footage? It depends. Video, yeah.

580
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:54,410
Yes. If you walk by a flag and no, it's
not, has nothing to do with zero g,

581
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:57,500
it has to do with no atmosphere.
Right. So you walk by a flag,

582
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:01,460
there is no breeze that, that is left
behind you in the work of your steps.

583
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,750
And uh,

584
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,780
depending on how much air you
displace things next to you might,

585
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,660
might respond to that. If
there's no atmosphere, no,

586
00:34:11,661 --> 00:34:15,410
there's no way to get that information
to the flag. So no that up, pull it up.

587
00:34:15,411 --> 00:34:17,840
Flag blowing in the breeze.
I'll, I'll tell you the video.

588
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:21,950
It is what you have here is with,
with the American flag that set up there,

589
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,470
there's sort of residual
stiffness to the flag.

590
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,650
There's residual stiffness to the,
to the,

591
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,920
to the beam that has to hold the flag
otherwise. Right. Hang Limp. Yeah.

592
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:34,970
It was a shaft through the
top of, exactly. There's a
famous quote by Arthur C.

593
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:36,230
Clarke who,
uh,

594
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,520
and at one point I had
tweeted this where he said,

595
00:34:40,521 --> 00:34:45,350
it's in space where there
is no air flag cannot wave.

596
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,690
So maybe space is not a place
where flags belong. Whoa.

597
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:55,760
Yeah. Apollo 15 is, this
is the, the one, um,

598
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:59,720
it's really fascinating because they
stick it into the ground and then the dude

599
00:34:59,721 --> 00:35:03,470
hops by it. And when he hops by
it, it wiggles in the breeze.

600
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,100
Like there you can see clearly that the
shaft is just stuck it in the ground.

601
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,280
Yeah, exactly. No, no. I'm saying
the shaft is in it and it's,

602
00:35:10,281 --> 00:35:14,090
it's in place and it's still sort of
reacting to the environment. Sure.

603
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,670
Now Watch what happens when
the guy gets behind it.

604
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,620
Now he's sort of moving along and he
gets in front of it and when he hops in

605
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:25,730
front of it, the flag follows him.
Like it, it goes in the breeze.

606
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,680
How long is this video? No, his
nothing touches anything and pull it,

607
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:35,630
pull it ahead. Well, if it does move,

608
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:40,020
the evidence would suggest that
something touched it. Right,

609
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,180
right. So something she is, how close his
foot is to the base where the video is.

610
00:35:45,181 --> 00:35:48,960
Keep going. Okay. Keep going. Get it
to the part where the guy goes around.

611
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,463
Yeah,

612
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:54,570
he's taking some pictures here.
Right. So here's the weird,

613
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,200
it would have been much
better if we queue this up.

614
00:35:56,201 --> 00:35:59,890
Clute queued up to like right there. Okay.
Okay. Okay. But I can go watch. Okay.

615
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:02,590
Then back it up. You missed it, you
back. It's announced. Where wiggling.

616
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,090
Just get it to right when
the guy hops in front of it.

617
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,093
Yeah.

618
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,490
Dude, you suck at Youtube. You really
sucky. You told him he just, he missed it.

619
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,640
I don't give a fuck. Jesus Christ.
The guy goes hopping in front of it.

620
00:36:19,641 --> 00:36:20,474
Here it goes.

621
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,360
I see a wiggle in the one nine.

622
00:36:23,361 --> 00:36:26,690
Miss [inaudible] can you do that stuff
on the screen there and an ad popped up?

623
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,420
Say that? Yeah. It looks like
a breeze. Blew it. Yeah. So
possible that that's fake.

624
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:39,770
Yes. So either either, uh,

625
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:44,800
all of this got faked or something
touched the flag that was not okay.

626
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:50,380
No, that's not true either.
It's not either. It could
have easily been that the,

627
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:53,830
some of the footage didn't come out
well or they fake some of the footage or

628
00:36:53,831 --> 00:36:57,280
that was phase two. That might not have
been even real Apollo footage. No, no, no,

629
00:36:57,281 --> 00:36:58,031
no, no. What? I mean,

630
00:36:58,031 --> 00:37:01,870
that might have been something that
someone made and then put it up as a goof

631
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:04,690
and then everyone like me is saying,
that's exactly. So here's my point.

632
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,800
So here's my point.
So there's a lot of fakery out there,

633
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,700
official and otherwise, right, right. And,

634
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:16,710
and the most susceptible
field of investigation to
fakery is euphology ology.

635
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,120
Right. Okay, sure. So, so
here's my point or ghosts. Okay.

636
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:26,410
You're looking at a picture
that's relatively low
quality that doesn't see the

637
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,380
entire zone around the flag that,
that you're,

638
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:34,540
you don't have full information.
So someone goes by and the flag wiggles.

639
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:40,140
Either this was faked and there is air
and the flag is responding to air or

640
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:45,820
there's something, uh, and, and the
whole Apollo 15 mission didn't happen.

641
00:37:45,821 --> 00:37:50,650
If you want to take it to an extreme to
extreme limit or there's something that

642
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:52,720
didn't make it into this photo.
Yes.

643
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:56,280
That's all. It's not, it's not going
to have been like as he jumped,

644
00:37:56,281 --> 00:38:00,510
maybe a piece of dust kicked
up and read it. Precisely.

645
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:04,170
But we don't see it because it's such
low rise or is equipment touches it?

646
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:06,920
He looks like he's pretty. Exactly. You
don't have far away from it. No. No.

647
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:10,410
You have no depth, depth cue. But look,
the things in the ground right there.

648
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:13,350
Let's see the guy go by
[inaudible] you do have have depth.

649
00:38:13,351 --> 00:38:16,450
If you watched the whole good, it's not
good to have then he's got a backpack.

650
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,330
Yeah, it's so, so I can't lose
sleep over that. Yeah. Yeah.

651
00:38:21,331 --> 00:38:23,910
I just, I no I don't, I'm
definitely not losing sleep over it.

652
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:27,750
I just wanted you to look at a guy
hopping in front of a flag blowing in the

653
00:38:27,751 --> 00:38:30,390
breeze. A atmosphere list. Moon. Yeah.

654
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,340
I mean these videos are
one of the reasons why so.

655
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,050
So I,

656
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,570
I sympathize with some of that.
Uh,

657
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,950
but it doesn't necessarily mean
that it did no one, I mean,

658
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,030
if some piece of footage is fake, it
doesn't mean the whole mission was fake.

659
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,620
I'm not only that,

660
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,540
but I would say that it is so hard to
fake every little thing that would need to

661
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:57,220
happen. It's just, it's, it's easier
to just go to the moon really.

662
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:57,881
Would it be,

663
00:38:57,881 --> 00:39:02,470
why would it be so hard to make video
footage and photography photographic

664
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:04,210
footage and then release it?

665
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,620
I'll give you another reason why you
can't put the sun for all intents and

666
00:39:08,621 --> 00:39:13,000
purposes in a photograph, is
that infinity, which means
all shadows are parallel.

667
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:14,350
All right?
So if you,

668
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,670
if you photograph them in the
correct way so that you don't have a

669
00:39:18,671 --> 00:39:23,620
foreshortening of an angle, you will see
that that shadows are, are parallel. Okay?

670
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,710
They point to one point,
they referenced one point at Infinity.

671
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,090
You can't fake that. In fact,
that's how I know in Hollywood,

672
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:34,630
if they've artificially lit a scene and
pretend that it's the sun because they

673
00:39:34,631 --> 00:39:38,190
can't actually put their light
source at infinity. And so I give,

674
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,190
I let it go because it's
Hollywood and they got,

675
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:43,720
it's the pretend that it's daytime when
they're filming at three o'clock in the

676
00:39:43,721 --> 00:39:47,230
morning when there's no traffic. That's a
hilarious statement though. I let it go.

677
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:50,990
I pretend, you know, I have to equate in
my head, the sun's that affinity, these,

678
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,340
these dire,
they want to bullshit people trying,

679
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:57,040
but you had to talk about suspension
of disbelief with me. I'm like, Eh,

680
00:39:57,041 --> 00:40:01,300
maybe she really couldn't kill that
dragon with a sword, but fuck it.

681
00:40:01,301 --> 00:40:06,210
I'm at the movies with you. It's
like, no, I'm, I'm, I look for,

682
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,900
you know,
they can't control the sun.

683
00:40:07,901 --> 00:40:11,290
So one part of the scene in the morning
and another part in the afternoon,

684
00:40:11,291 --> 00:40:13,990
the shadow is pointing in a different
direction and they want you to think of

685
00:40:13,991 --> 00:40:16,600
just happened 10 minutes later.
They can't control the sun.

686
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,950
So they fake the sun in a sound studio
and you, and they have the right color,

687
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,540
color temperature of the sun,

688
00:40:22,541 --> 00:40:26,680
so it feels like sunlight and it has
that sort of brightness. Then you get,

689
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,330
so I let that go. It's, there's so much
you'd have to fake. I'd swear to you.

690
00:40:31,331 --> 00:40:32,980
It's easier to just go to the damn moon.

691
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,790
That's how I understand
exactly what you're saying.

692
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:40,000
But it sounds crazy if you think that
people actually couldn't get to the moon,

693
00:40:40,001 --> 00:40:44,290
then know that if they actually
physically couldn't survive out in the

694
00:40:44,291 --> 00:40:47,950
atmosphere of deep space and couldn't
survive the, the what? The, the, the,

695
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,090
the talk is that the solar radiation,
any solar flares,

696
00:40:52,091 --> 00:40:54,430
any solar activity would be instant death.

697
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:57,820
And this has sort of been
kind of acknowledged by NASA
that they rolled the dice

698
00:40:57,821 --> 00:40:59,230
with with solar radiation.

699
00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:02,800
So the people that are believing that
it's impossible to get through the van

700
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,870
Allen radiation belts,
for you to say to them,

701
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:09,180
what's was that it would be just his
fault. It's just you could, yes. However,

702
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,390
I don't spend much time getting
through them. So radiation doses,

703
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,570
not simply is it there, it's how
much time. It's tiny exposure to it.

704
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:20,410
The intensity plus time gives
you total dose. Right? But these,

705
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,680
these people that believe that no humans
have ever done it before because the

706
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:25,420
only people that did it
with the Apollo astronauts,

707
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:26,920
and there's no one's
been able to do it since.

708
00:41:26,921 --> 00:41:29,890
And every single space station flight,
every space shuttle flight,

709
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,940
all of them are within what, 400
miles? Easily. I mean space station.

710
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:37,000
It's two something humble's a little
higher, right? But three, six,

711
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:39,170
eight miles the right.

712
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,130
But these are the only times where
human beings have ever been passed.

713
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:46,940
That was the Apollo program.
So for the conspiracy minded,

714
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,690
of course that comes up. Well, no,
you can't survive in deep space.

715
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:51,501
No one's ever done.

716
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,710
It accepts the people in the 60s
and no one believes that today.

717
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:58,820
And the reason why you can't get out
there is because of solar flares and

718
00:41:58,821 --> 00:42:03,290
radiation, all this jazz. So if they're
right, then it would be easier to fake it.

719
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,041
As you say,

720
00:42:04,041 --> 00:42:07,730
they're not right because van Allen says
it's safe to go through the belts and

721
00:42:07,731 --> 00:42:11,050
then they went through the top, the
doughnut hole. But realistically, when,

722
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,930
when people look at human beings that
have actually been through the last time

723
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:15,441
someone did,

724
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:19,370
it was 1972 there was the last time a
human being has been more than 400 miles

725
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,380
from the earth's surface.
That freaks people out.

726
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:26,150
Every single technological achievement
from 1969 is easier, cheaper,

727
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,410
and faster to reproduce today. Except,
well, no, it had its own trajectory.

728
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:34,760
I mean in 1969 the computer was
still half the size of the room. So,

729
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,880
and that's one thing, the same computer
that it's like not even an iPhone. Right,

730
00:42:37,881 --> 00:42:38,714
exactly.

731
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:43,070
Or the computing power that's in
a birthday singing birthday card.

732
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:48,310
So what Kubrick got wrong in 2001 in
the midst of all the rest that was

733
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:53,321
visionary was the assumption that
the future would be one big computer

734
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,490
controlling the one big ship.

735
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:59,720
The notion of distributed computing
where you would have the power of a

736
00:42:59,721 --> 00:43:02,890
mainframe sitting on
your hip was unimagined

737
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:07,930
at the time. So, so yeah,
things got systematically
more powerful, but that's uh,

738
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,840
I mean, uh, this was,

739
00:43:09,841 --> 00:43:12,510
that's a natural progression of
technology that's been going on since the

740
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:16,290
industrial revolution, right? That alone
doesn't, shouldn't surprise anybody. No,

741
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:17,190
that doesn't surprise anyone.

742
00:43:17,191 --> 00:43:20,820
The argument is that the up the man space
flight is the only thing that has an

743
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:25,380
advanced. If you watch these movies
for the 1970s, they talked about 2010,

744
00:43:25,381 --> 00:43:29,850
my God, who's going to be space stations
on the moon and there was space 1999.

745
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:31,500
You remember that show? Of course. Yeah.

746
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:36,660
But the reality is RFC man space ended.

747
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,450
I'll tell you why. Money. Uh,

748
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,200
yes, that's the, that's the clean,
that's the clean, clear answer.

749
00:43:44,201 --> 00:43:47,800
But there's a more subtle answer.
All right. When we went to the moon,

750
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:52,690
everyone assumed because of the way it
was marketed, there was the, the, the,

751
00:43:52,691 --> 00:43:56,470
the, the profiles and life
magazine of each of the astronauts.

752
00:43:56,471 --> 00:44:00,400
And you saw their families and it was,
the president said, we should do it. And,

753
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:03,670
and it was this grand mission from NASA,

754
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,210
a civilian space agency and, and, uh,

755
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:09,100
the world's fair in New York,

756
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:13,090
1964 was all about inventing a future.

757
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:17,800
So we were living that romance.
All right.

758
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,320
What we were not reminding ourselves is
that the only reason why we went to the

759
00:44:23,321 --> 00:44:26,830
moon is because we were at war
with Russia, with the Soviet Union.

760
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:28,690
That is the only reason.

761
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,980
Not at all.
If you don't carry

762
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,510
that motivation with you and you're only
thinking that this is simply the next

763
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,550
technological thing to do,

764
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,170
that when we learned that
Russia's not going to the moon,

765
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:47,400
therefore we have no reason
to continue and we stop you,

766
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:51,300
then you cry foul and you say, well,
wait a minute. How about the future?

767
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,700
How about Mars? And how
about the rest of that? Well,

768
00:44:53,701 --> 00:44:57,870
the rest of that was not ever in the
plan unless Mars had planned to, I mean,

769
00:44:58,350 --> 00:45:00,360
unless Russia had planned to do it.

770
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:05,840
And so it was not a natural flow of what
our technology would have done because

771
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:09,360
it didn't flow out of
our economic creativity.

772
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,390
It came out of our urge to not die.

773
00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:15,840
And so when you have that scenario,

774
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:19,740
of course we didn't go
past the moon after 1972,

775
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,940
we were no longer competing
with Russia to do that.

776
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,970
I understand what you're saying.
And uh,

777
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:30,570
if I was more conspiratorially binded,

778
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:35,790
I would argue that that's a, a
nice, convenient thing to say.

779
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:40,791
But the reality is we still kept up
as far as other avenues of military,

780
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:44,680
whether it's a building better
bombs or faster playing.

781
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,460
And it was all about military superiority.
Of course.

782
00:45:47,461 --> 00:45:49,770
Wouldn't we be the first to
set up a base on the moon?

783
00:45:49,771 --> 00:45:53,360
Wouldn't we'd be the first to, it's not
necessary unless Russia does. Right.

784
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,240
In fact, most of what we did in
space was reactive to Russia.

785
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:59,640
We were not the first in space.
Russia was,

786
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:02,880
we weren't the first ascent a
life form into space. Russia was,

787
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,800
Russia spent sent a dog. We weren't the
first humans in space. Russia's Russians,

788
00:46:07,801 --> 00:46:12,210
we're Russians even put the first
black person in space. It was a Cuban,

789
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:17,100
uh, acumen. Cosmonaut the
achievements in space or what we did,

790
00:46:17,101 --> 00:46:19,260
we got to the moon first
and then we say we win.

791
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:24,950
And so we have re painted that error
in our memory as we are the pioneers.

792
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:30,480
And we did it because we explore.
No,

793
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:32,670
we did it because that's a nice,

794
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,460
after the fact window dressing
you can put on that achievement.

795
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:38,820
But we did it because we were at war.
There's no,

796
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:43,560
once you understand that, it allows
you to understand why we stopped.

797
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,720
I completely hear what he Sam,

798
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:50,721
but you are fueling to conspiracy fires
and the people right now thinking Neil

799
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,510
Tyson is working for the man. This is
what's going on. He's come on this show.

800
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:58,140
It's tried to explain things and
I'm not authorized sickle way.

801
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:01,170
Look at him when it's
tricky facts and logic,

802
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:06,000
the muddying information
about history. Um, the,

803
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:10,580
I agree with you, but I still see Rome.
It still, it means the room for fucker.

804
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:14,160
It means Mars is not in our future unless,

805
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:18,450
unless one of two conditions
are satisfied either.

806
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:23,700
China says they want to put military
bases on Mars. We're on Mars nine months,

807
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,020
10 months after that, one month to
design, build and, and, and, and,

808
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,620
and launch a Mars worthy craft and
nine months to get there. All right,

809
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,370
that's a,

810
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:36,640
China says they want to put military
bases on Mars where they are tomorrow.

811
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,140
All right.
That's one way to get there.

812
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:43,141
Another way we find some economic
justification for doing it.

813
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:48,010
We're motivated by, I don't want to
die and I don't want to die poor,

814
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:51,550
but aren't there like massive
resources just on the moon? I mean,

815
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,800
haven't they found a titanium entirely?
So that's a frontier and space. Uh,

816
00:47:55,930 --> 00:47:58,810
what's the name of this new
venture space? Resources, space.

817
00:47:58,811 --> 00:48:01,600
Resources Incorporated there.
I think that's their name.

818
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:04,390
I think if I've got it wrong,
but they just do a Google on it,

819
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:07,210
you'll find it immediately.
This is a group of folks,

820
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:11,740
their astronauts and aerospace engineers
and scientists and entrepreneurs who

821
00:48:11,741 --> 00:48:12,640
say,
you know,

822
00:48:12,641 --> 00:48:17,641
an asteroid the size of size of a
football field has more minor bubble rare

823
00:48:20,561 --> 00:48:24,240
elements than have ever been mined in
the history of the world. And if you,

824
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:27,460
if you, if you tow that
thing to earth, there you go.

825
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,310
The size of a football field or less,
less size of a barn.

826
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,280
So there are platinum group there.
Ash.

827
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:38,570
See Nature already did the sorting of
the elements for us. All right there,

828
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:39,070
there were,

829
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:43,090
there was something called planetesimals
objects that didn't quite grow big

830
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:46,600
enough to become planets and then there
was susceptible to being shattered back

831
00:48:46,601 --> 00:48:48,790
into asteroids. Uh, [inaudible].

832
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,880
So when you make a planet
and it's still molten,

833
00:48:51,881 --> 00:48:53,640
the heavy stuff goes to the middle,
right?

834
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:57,970
Cause it sinks and the light stuff
floats. Well, what's heavy? Iron is heavy.

835
00:48:57,971 --> 00:49:01,480
Platinum is heavy, iridium
is heavy. Uranium is heavy.

836
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:05,290
All the heavy stuff is heavy.
So nature then sorts it,

837
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:07,930
the geologist calls it differentiation.
It sorts it.

838
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,320
Now you have this cosmic object
that later on gets shattered.

839
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:16,620
You now have asteroids made of crust and
asteroids made of core material and the

840
00:49:16,841 --> 00:49:20,170
core material has got all
the elements and all those,

841
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:25,020
all those rare earth metals that we value.
An industry that we value in,

842
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,690
in jewelry,
it is pre collected for us.

843
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:32,020
So if you get one of these
platinum group asteroids and,

844
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:35,900
and bring it back to earth, there
it is. It's a whole new marketplace.

845
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,480
Need like a wonder woman jet with a net,
some rolling.

846
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,800
She was the net shit and I remember that.

847
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,390
Or you corral the asteroid and use
it for other operations in space,

848
00:49:46,391 --> 00:49:49,580
which is a much more financially,
um,

849
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:55,090
a feasible thing to do would involve
deep space travel, deep space.

850
00:49:55,090 --> 00:49:59,890
Not only that space travel or robotic
way, be able to do it. You can do robots.

851
00:49:59,891 --> 00:50:01,840
Sure. If you, if we can perfect robot,

852
00:50:01,841 --> 00:50:05,330
let the robot look the best way to do
it anyway. You don't have to feed them.

853
00:50:05,331 --> 00:50:07,610
They don't, you know, they don't want
to come home after that. You, yeah.

854
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,000
Unless we flee this planet,

855
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:14,470
like unless we have to go all Battlestar
Galactica [inaudible] most likely we're

856
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:19,471
not going to need to send people to
explore things and we have something like

857
00:50:19,871 --> 00:50:23,560
the rover. Well, why take a
chance on human biological life?

858
00:50:23,830 --> 00:50:27,980
I want humans to go to Mars.
I think that's a good thing to do for uh,

859
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:31,340
because you build heroes that way.
There's no ticker tape parades for robots.

860
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,340
They're going to be heroes.

861
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:35,160
They go that far without jerking off
because you're on that thing for like nine

862
00:50:35,161 --> 00:50:38,820
months. Yeah, the air and back and they're
all being video camera the whole time.

863
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,280
We're going to find some real heroes,

864
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:45,300
see some real people that really weep
the first time to get into a tent.

865
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:48,420
What you might do just in couples and
then you'd get rid of that problem.

866
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:50,550
Then they fight.
Can't have that.

867
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:55,030
That's a terrible [inaudible] sex in
space and new couples, what does that,

868
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:57,510
what's the, that's even worse. You
don't have any history together.

869
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,190
What are the odds that
they're going to work out?

870
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,610
How many new couples stick around
for nine months? That's a hard one.

871
00:51:02,611 --> 00:51:06,120
That's a hard one. They have found
planets and our meat entirely of diamonds.

872
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:07,270
Diamond

873
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:08,650
is pure carbon. If, if the,

874
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:12,320
if anyone didn't remember that a diamond
comes in like carbonated compression,

875
00:51:12,321 --> 00:51:15,980
right? We have five or six varieties and
one of them is what's in your pencils?

876
00:51:15,981 --> 00:51:20,420
That graphite and very soft and, and,
and that's a diamond smooth. No, no, no,

877
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:22,730
but it's, it's carbon in a, uh,

878
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,080
the lattices is layered in
Vr in the smooth layers.

879
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:29,990
That's slide off one another.
That's why a pencil,

880
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,100
as you touch the pencil to
the page and drag it you,

881
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:37,520
what you're doing is you're dragging
layers of carbon lattice off of the

882
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:40,550
graphite and the thought of it that way.

883
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:45,230
It's actually pretty cool. That's very
cool. Yeah. It's almost essential, right?

884
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:46,800
Yeah.
Who layers of graph,

885
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,480
that's like a sculpture almost
laid to the page two d sculpture,

886
00:51:50,481 --> 00:51:53,900
obeying your every command allowing
you to communicate with other humans.

887
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:57,110
There is a pencil. What's,
what's going on inside.

888
00:51:57,111 --> 00:52:00,250
What we call the lead pencil lead is,
is just the,

889
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,370
the term for what the graphite that's
in a pencil has nothing to do with the

890
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,990
element led. So other forms of carbon,
uh, lately we discovered the Bucky Ball.

891
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:13,010
It's carbon 60, 60 carbon
atoms that are, that are,

892
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,160
that make a sheet that
has curved into a sphere,

893
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,230
the shell of the sphere.

894
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:21,500
And it's essentially the
lattice points of a soccer ball.

895
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,270
There's 60 of them if it's,

896
00:52:23,271 --> 00:52:26,930
if you do it right and then you get what
we call a Bucky ball because it, it's,

897
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:31,720
it's buckyballs named after
Buckminster Fuller and he, you know,

898
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,130
remember the geodesic dome.
You remember those? Okay.

899
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:38,300
So the lattice of this is,
um,

900
00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:40,340
uh,
is,

901
00:52:40,341 --> 00:52:45,050
is costs to image that
what that what the Bucky,

902
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,360
you say that again? Fall?
Yeah. So the, the, the, the,

903
00:52:50,870 --> 00:52:53,180
uh, the geodesic domes, which,

904
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:57,290
but Buckminster Fuller made popular,
I guess in the 1960s,

905
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,470
or they predated him by the way. He's
credited with inventing it, but he didn't,

906
00:53:00,471 --> 00:53:05,030
it was invented by Zeiss, the planetary
manufacturers in East Germany.

907
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,690
There were some engineers there. They
invented this. But this is an aside,

908
00:53:08,691 --> 00:53:10,130
but I think it's a pretty cool aside.

909
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,490
They invented a new way to
project stars on the ceiling,

910
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,540
the first optical projector and they put
it on their ceiling and say, you know,

911
00:53:17,541 --> 00:53:20,450
this would be cooler if the
ceiling were round, you know,

912
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:24,440
do we have any round ceilings? No.
Okay, well here's a couple of dollars.

913
00:53:24,441 --> 00:53:26,150
Go build one or invent one.

914
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:31,280
And they invented the geodesic dome just
for the purpose of showing a dome where

915
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:37,320
the stars would be. And this was in
1923 it was pretty cool. That's amazing.

916
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,790
So anyhow, so carbon carbon, so you put
the carbon atoms at the, at the lattice,

917
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:45,560
at the intersection points of a
geodesic dome and you'd basically get a

918
00:53:45,561 --> 00:53:48,390
something that resembles the Bucky ball.
It's a new form of carbon.

919
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:53,130
That's one of the forums. And one of them
is diamond and diamond. The lattice is,

920
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:55,710
is,
is very tightly bound.

921
00:53:55,711 --> 00:53:58,470
So no part of a diamond will
slide off of any other part.

922
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:01,500
And diamond is the hardest
natural substance known.

923
00:54:02,070 --> 00:54:03,810
And that's why you have diamond drills.

924
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,310
You have diamond anvils and a diamond.

925
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:11,250
Because it's transparent
and it's also very dense.

926
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,460
Light actually slows
down inside of a diamond.

927
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:19,740
It is only 40% as fast in a diamond
as it is in the vacuum of space.

928
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,120
And because of that,

929
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:26,300
it bends so severely in the cuts of
the diamond that you can get double and

930
00:54:27,151 --> 00:54:29,460
triple reflections inside.

931
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,700
So light from one direction comes
out in a different direction.

932
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,640
Making the diamond look like
it's radiant on your finger.

933
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,100
Ah,

934
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,250
pure carbon.

935
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,800
It is the same stuff that's in
coal except treated differently.

936
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,540
W there was a man who,
they,

937
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:51,320
they wrote an article about him in wired
magazine a few years back where he had

938
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:55,280
acquired some sort of technology from
the Soviet Union where they had figured

939
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:59,900
out how to make diamonds. They're making
them now. And I did a, I hosted Nova, uh,

940
00:54:59,901 --> 00:55:04,580
Nova Science. Now I don't anymore,
but in my, in my tenure as host, uh,

941
00:55:04,581 --> 00:55:05,211
we visited,

942
00:55:05,211 --> 00:55:08,930
they blindfolded me because they don't
want to de Beers to know about it and

943
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:12,330
took me to a secret factory w uh,
uh,

944
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:17,150
a manufacturing plant where they're
layering carbon onto a lattice.

945
00:55:17,151 --> 00:55:20,750
And just the way a diamond is created
and there just building diamond,

946
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,150
they blindfolded you.
Oh yeah.

947
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,590
In fact they took away my iPhone because
my iPhone has the track that the,

948
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,360
you know,
the inertial memory of where it has been.

949
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,660
So that had to be turned off and I was
blindfold and then we do the interview in

950
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:36,500
the, uh, in the factory and we
looked inside the, uh, you know,

951
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:41,060
the special patented
devices where they make it.

952
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,970
Now here's what's the real weird thing
about that. Oh, by the way, go ahead.

953
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,291
I'll wait.

954
00:55:45,291 --> 00:55:48,230
Then I took some of the
samples of diamonds that
they made and went on to 47th

955
00:55:48,231 --> 00:55:51,020
street in New York,
which is the diamond capital of the world.

956
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:54,860
And I showed it to the guys there and
they were pure than any of the diamond.

957
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:58,400
They had been hauled from Earth.
This is how ridiculous checks are.

958
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,150
The swelling gets home. My wife says
she wouldn't want one of those diamonds.

959
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,660
Why? Because cause
they're artificial. Well,

960
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:09,320
so I spoke to the morale crazy that
I spoke to the merchants and I said,

961
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:13,340
what are you going to do if there's a
flood of these diamonds on the market?

962
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:14,443
They said,

963
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:17,480
people are not going to want them the
time that he sounds like your wife.

964
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:17,961
Exactly.

965
00:56:17,961 --> 00:56:22,130
Because they want to know that it was
forged in the fires of the belly of the

966
00:56:22,131 --> 00:56:26,260
earth. Yeah. And not just
out of somebody's back lab.

967
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:29,440
And I said, okay, but you know,

968
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:32,170
these are pure diamonds than
anything earth is creating.

969
00:56:32,171 --> 00:56:36,100
Cause we can do a better job making
diamonds, dinner Cam. And so for me,

970
00:56:36,110 --> 00:56:38,070
I take the artificial diamonds,

971
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:44,490
some poor African kid doesn't have a chip
it out of a rock with his good points.

972
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:48,220
Very important. It's just technology
replacing human labor. Once again, please.

973
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:50,650
Not a winter. Good way.
Does it freak you out when,

974
00:56:50,651 --> 00:56:53,360
I mean obviously you're very
technologically minded, but when you,

975
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:56,950
you realize that where these
conflict minerals come from and the,

976
00:56:56,951 --> 00:56:59,500
the actual stuff that's in your iPhone,

977
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,130
someone might have dug it out of a
hill in a poor community in Africa.

978
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:06,220
I mean it's incredibly
ironic. Yeah. But it's the,

979
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:11,221
it's not uniquely poor as a community
that's exploited for some economic gain.

980
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:15,130
So, so my issue wouldn't be, oh,

981
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:18,280
I'm concerned about these minerals are
concerned about all the places where

982
00:57:18,281 --> 00:57:22,510
that's happening. So, so, uh,
you know, how many lights,

983
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:27,540
it is ironic that the most technologically
advanced shit we have needs to come

984
00:57:28,181 --> 00:57:31,550
that way. You know, that
that's where in 2012, you know,

985
00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:34,660
until they've started reforming these
areas, that's where it was coming from.

986
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,470
Getting to it. I wouldn't call a
diamond technologically advanced.

987
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,200
When I think of technology I
think is my conflict minerals.

988
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:44,450
I meant conflict and arrested
her and lithium ion. Oh yeah.

989
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,180
She had a cold and your cell
phones. Okay. Right, right,
right, right. Yeah. Yeah. So,

990
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,230
uh, so diamond, uh, so, so yes, getting
back to what started the diamonds,

991
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:58,090
getting back to what started this,
uh, carbon is a, is is the forthright,

992
00:57:58,430 --> 00:58:03,430
but fourth most co carbon is the fourth
most common ingredient in the cosmos.

993
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,980
And so in the cosmos is full of places
where there's high temperature and high

994
00:58:08,981 --> 00:58:12,910
pressure. And a lot of time and
we are not, we are delighted,

995
00:58:12,911 --> 00:58:16,390
but not entirely surprised that
there are places in the universe,

996
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:21,540
even entire planets where a large part
of their composition would be pure

997
00:58:22,331 --> 00:58:26,740
diamond. How long does it take to create
a diamond in the earth inside? I, I,

998
00:58:26,741 --> 00:58:30,970
I'm not up on the very, uh, because
the pressure matters here as well.

999
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:35,530
And that you can change one and that
affects what you'd need for the other.

1000
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:39,810
And I, I don't have that map memorized
in my head, but it takes a long time.

1001
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,100
Way longer than your
lifetime. So, uh, you, you,

1002
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:46,030
once you run out of diamonds in the earth,
you're not getting any more diamonds.

1003
00:58:46,031 --> 00:58:48,280
You're going to have to make them
yourself or find them elsewhere in the

1004
00:58:48,281 --> 00:58:51,070
university. And how long does it
take their machines to make them? Uh,

1005
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:54,160
you can make one in about a week. Whoa. Oh
yeah. You just lay it down. You're done.

1006
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,300
How big is it? Like a duck? It's hard to
make a big one. They make one. Um, yeah.

1007
00:58:58,301 --> 00:59:01,780
I'm not carrot fluent,
but the size of a BB, uh,

1008
00:59:01,781 --> 00:59:06,070
so one that could easily fit in
a, in a, in a, in a post earring.

1009
00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:08,410
So that's it.
They can't get a big fat,

1010
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:13,390
crazy charter type Blah and Elizabeth
Taylor. No, no, they're not there yet.

1011
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:16,000
No, no. They're not the
Kardashians. Those are rare. Anyway.

1012
00:59:16,001 --> 00:59:19,960
Those are extremely rare anyway. And the
most common diamonds are small. So yeah,

1013
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,830
they can certainly compete
in that marketplace.

1014
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:26,060
It doesn't DeBeers have like the rumor
is the conspiracy theory is we should

1015
00:59:26,061 --> 00:59:30,980
play that. Here's, here's of the theme
going throughout the podcast. The,

1016
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:34,550
um, uh, the, the theory is that
there's a warehouse that they keep,

1017
00:59:34,551 --> 00:59:38,720
there's so many diamonds that they,
they artificially inflate the price by,

1018
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,340
you know, slowly releasing them to
the market place. Is that true? Yeah.

1019
00:59:42,341 --> 00:59:46,600
I think there's not a pure market
in diamonds when, and I think in,

1020
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,880
in the lingo of economics,
if there's a market in something,

1021
00:59:49,881 --> 00:59:54,881
it means it is traded often enough so
that the price at any given moment is the

1022
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:58,040
actual price,
the actual valuation of that,

1023
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:00,170
that object in the world at that time.

1024
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:05,320
And it presupposes that there's a full
access to supplies and demand and nothing

1025
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:09,420
is being withheld. So, uh,

1026
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,300
yes de Beers is withholding if not to be
or someone else is withholding diamonds

1027
01:00:14,301 --> 01:00:16,700
from the marketplace to assure
a circuit certain price.

1028
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:19,390
If they flooded the market, the
price would drop. God dammit,

1029
01:00:19,410 --> 01:00:23,800
this is rogue and he listened to this
shit. You don't need a real diamond.

1030
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:24,950
Well here's the scary parts,

1031
01:00:24,951 --> 01:00:29,951
but the universe here we are killing
each other over resources buried in the

1032
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:34,070
ground and in the sands when
the including sources of energy,

1033
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:35,780
chemical energy in that case,

1034
01:00:35,781 --> 01:00:39,740
whereas in the universe has an
unlimited supply of everything.

1035
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,540
So why is it an energy?

1036
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:45,260
Why isn't that reflected in the budget
that we put in this space? Travel?

1037
01:00:45,261 --> 01:00:47,720
It seems ridiculous and
short sighted. And, I mean,

1038
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:50,810
it seems like you can take all this
military industrial money and say, listen,

1039
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:55,040
you fuckers want to get really rich. Let's
get crazy. Let's go space cowboy style.

1040
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:59,510
And it's go Lazu some rock. This space
resources company is doing exactly that.

1041
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,760
They're marketing face resources. They,
they, they're targeting asteroids for EC,

1042
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:05,900
economic exploitation.
How does that work?

1043
01:01:05,901 --> 01:01:09,830
Or does it look like his
space is eventually going
to be like the homesteaders

1044
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:13,250
back in the 18 hundreds where you would
move there and get a plot of land?

1045
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:16,610
Are you gonna be able to claim
plots of spanx currently space law,

1046
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,940
which is an interesting
frontier. And, and you know,

1047
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:24,590
and at the UN and in other places, space
law has certain rules and regulations.

1048
01:01:24,830 --> 01:01:27,650
One of them I think is unrealistic and
it has to do with the waging of war.

1049
01:01:27,651 --> 01:01:31,560
And I'll get to that in a minute, but
the other one is Leeann's space, Huh?

1050
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:36,630
No, it forbids a warfare, uh, uh,

1051
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,270
sort of forbid space from
serving as a platform for war.

1052
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:44,000
But I think that's completely
naive and unrealistic.

1053
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:46,530
And I'll tell you why in
a minute. But, uh, and,

1054
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:49,160
and people saying what space should
be peaceful, a peaceful place.

1055
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:52,520
I think that is naive.
That's naive bordering on stupid.

1056
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:57,340
They obviously haven't seen
thoust target cause yeah.

1057
01:01:57,450 --> 01:02:02,150
So, so, so, uh, in in
space. So the way the laws,

1058
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:05,540
the books now read that could
change with emerging consensus.

1059
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:10,280
The weight now reads is you
cannot own anything off the earth.

1060
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:12,313
However,

1061
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,150
no one can stop you from putting a
flag on it and no one can stop you from

1062
01:02:17,151 --> 01:02:19,260
mining resources from it.

1063
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:25,370
You just can't claim to own it and require
that someone else pay you to use it.

1064
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,080
Okay.
So in other words,

1065
01:02:28,081 --> 01:02:32,970
there's no private property and
there's no private objects in space,

1066
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:36,400
but if you do acquire an
object and you bring it pat,

1067
01:02:36,401 --> 01:02:39,960
can you use it for profit that hasn't
been fully explored legally yet? Yeah.

1068
01:02:39,961 --> 01:02:42,300
If you invested all the money,
I think the,

1069
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:45,420
the laws are going to go in the
favor of free market capitalism.

1070
01:02:45,450 --> 01:02:48,870
And this is why conspiracy
theories will step in and say it's,

1071
01:02:48,871 --> 01:02:51,240
that's why Obama's
moving towards socialism,

1072
01:02:51,570 --> 01:02:54,150
that trying to control all
the resources in space,

1073
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:57,600
they want to pull it all those
minerals and diamonds, et cetera.

1074
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:02,040
When the Jews and their marketplace
stranglehold on the diamond industry,

1075
01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:05,250
except the rate at which
Obama's plan to return to space,

1076
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,280
Disney slow is not commensurate
with that as a viable in less see,

1077
01:03:11,890 --> 01:03:16,890
take into account the conspiracy theory
to keep the elites alive forever and

1078
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:22,800
start killing off people with eugenics
and wars. There's a lot of people that,

1079
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:25,170
that's another very
fine conspiracy theory,

1080
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:27,900
crop circles and chem trails.

1081
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,700
I don't know if you're familiar
with either one of those.

1082
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,620
I don't know about chem trails,
but certainly crop circles.

1083
01:03:31,621 --> 01:03:34,420
Everybody knows about crop circles. I
mean, come on. I know about chem trail.

1084
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,540
I don't need to introduce
you to Eddie Bravo.

1085
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:42,730
What chem trails are is one of the
easily the silliest conspiracy theories.

1086
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,900
Um, there's a something, there's
validity to it. Unfortunately in there,

1087
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:52,050
first of all, cloud seeding
has been done in many cultures.

1088
01:03:52,051 --> 01:03:54,330
It's done on a regular open basis.

1089
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:58,560
In the United Arab Emirates and Abu Dhabi,
they made it rain 50 times last year.

1090
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:00,960
Like they're doing it every
week. They can. You can do it.

1091
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,060
We know that scientifically.
But what they're claiming is that the,

1092
01:04:05,061 --> 01:04:09,690
the government is spraying shit out of
planes and these are not regular planes

1093
01:04:09,691 --> 01:04:14,040
and those contracts that lasts forever.
Those are actually chem trails.

1094
01:04:14,041 --> 01:04:15,870
Those are fake clouds.

1095
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:19,050
And there's all sorts of different
things they're spraying that control the

1096
01:04:19,051 --> 01:04:23,040
populace through spraying.
What is it me? What is, how,

1097
01:04:23,041 --> 01:04:26,290
in what way is it controlling it? So what
is asked? What is the key? Too many fat.

1098
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:31,230
You've already gone too far with this.
I had to talk to a pilot. I said, okay,

1099
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:34,020
like this is driving me crazy. You know,
cause he was like, when we were kids, man,

1100
01:04:34,021 --> 01:04:36,780
those clouds in the sky,
when a pub plane would fly over,

1101
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,150
they would dissipate really quickly.
But now they stay forever.

1102
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:42,330
They're fucking spraying us with Shit,
man. This is how crazy people are.

1103
01:04:42,331 --> 01:04:45,990
So then I talked to a pilot and I said,
okay, what is, what, why is it, what's,

1104
01:04:45,991 --> 01:04:49,350
how come? Sometimes the clouds go away
and sometimes the persistence of contrail,

1105
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,590
it says it's amount of how
much atmosphere, how much
water's in the atmosphere,

1106
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:55,830
which varies. Yeah. Yeah. And I go,
thank you. That's all I need to know.

1107
01:04:55,890 --> 01:04:59,100
So when the jet engine flies through,
it makes it an artificial cloud.

1108
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:02,850
It really does. It spirals up the
water and the wind and in it's wake,

1109
01:05:03,030 --> 01:05:08,030
it leaves this temporary cloud and it
has to cool in order for the to condense.

1110
01:05:08,161 --> 01:05:10,230
And if you look immediately
outside of the engine,

1111
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:14,940
there's an interval where it is not
clouded, it's completely transparent.

1112
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:18,220
And then it cools reaching the
temperature of the surrounding air

1113
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:21,520
and then it condenses out. But the,
the levels of moisture at different,

1114
01:05:21,521 --> 01:05:22,420
at different altitudes.

1115
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:27,130
So a plane will not leave the same
contrail at all altitudes from near an

1116
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,160
airport up to 40

1117
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:32,760
exactly. Just as like some areas it
rains in some areas or desert. There's,

1118
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:36,390
there's areas of, and it
shouldn't be, it should be it,

1119
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,960
but people and people get really wacky
with that one. That's a weird one.

1120
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:44,220
When it's another one where there's
very little looking into the possible

1121
01:05:44,221 --> 01:05:47,880
answers. It's like they want
it to be, they want, you
want it to be, want it to be.

1122
01:05:47,881 --> 01:05:50,970
They want it to be cancer causing things
that the government sprang on us in

1123
01:05:50,971 --> 01:05:54,180
order to lower the population numbers
because there's too many of us. Right.

1124
01:05:54,181 --> 01:05:57,820
That's why there's lithium and the water
supply and Neil Tyson have you like I

1125
01:05:57,900 --> 01:05:59,190
had this conversation with someone,
I said,

1126
01:05:59,191 --> 01:06:02,120
did you know there's antidepressants
in the water supply? And I go,

1127
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:05,640
well that's cause people flush their
antidepressants and they might pick they

1128
01:06:05,641 --> 01:06:09,630
pee and some of it's, I go, but
the amount is so tiny. I go,

1129
01:06:09,631 --> 01:06:11,450
this is nothing that you could ever late.

1130
01:06:11,451 --> 01:06:14,580
It's not psychoactive amounts to kind of,
you know that man. How do you know that?

1131
01:06:14,581 --> 01:06:16,680
I'm like, I don't know
how to, you know, man,

1132
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:21,030
go get some water and bring it to a
fucking testing facility and you can test

1133
01:06:21,031 --> 01:06:24,510
this. Stop freaking me out. There's
enough real shit to freak me out.

1134
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:28,970
What drives me nuts is like end
of the world. People. I would, uh,

1135
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,790
I would have conversations with them and
they were convinced this mind thing and

1136
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,940
all societies all headed towards a
certain thing. It's really obvious.

1137
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:39,880
And I'm like, do you ever pay
attention to super volcanoes? Yeah.

1138
01:06:39,881 --> 01:06:41,880
The real issues to be contended with here.

1139
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,540
Some real shit going on in Yellowstone.
Yeah.

1140
01:06:44,700 --> 01:06:49,620
Like yellow stone every six to 800,000
years essentially kills half the

1141
01:06:49,621 --> 01:06:50,670
continent off.

1142
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:52,640
Do you know that? We were,
when we were growing up,

1143
01:06:53,060 --> 01:06:57,560
old faithful was called old faithful
and it was faithful to the clock.

1144
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:01,370
And then there was some geologic stuff
that happened and now it will still blow,

1145
01:07:01,371 --> 01:07:02,450
but it's not regular.

1146
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:09,160
I saw this some graph. I don't know if
they'd media. Yeah. Sometimes faithful,

1147
01:07:09,161 --> 01:07:13,270
you know. Well, he held it
together for a long time. Yeah.

1148
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:16,610
You got to get some credit.
They had, uh, yeah, the, um,

1149
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:20,140
there was a national geographic piece
on Yellowstone where it was right when

1150
01:07:20,141 --> 01:07:23,530
they sort of figured out that
Yellowstone was a called Damn volcano.

1151
01:07:23,770 --> 01:07:26,340
They figured out how large it was
and they were talking about the,

1152
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:31,410
the frequency of earthquakes and it
was over like a six month period or

1153
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:35,380
something like that.
There was 2000 earthquakes in Yellowstone.

1154
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:39,190
Trends are what your threshold is for
measuring an earthquake. Yeah. Most,

1155
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:42,490
most earthquakes in the world,
if they happen right under your feet,

1156
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:45,480
you wouldn't notice it.
And so because there's,

1157
01:07:45,660 --> 01:07:50,660
their energy level is so low that they
don't even get past the absorbers in your

1158
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:55,820
knee. You got new knees or new hips. What
did you get? Ligaments. Ligaments. Yeah.

1159
01:07:56,110 --> 01:07:58,240
Almost no matter the
condition of your knees,

1160
01:07:58,270 --> 01:08:00,790
you wouldn't feel an
earthquake up to two or three.

1161
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:05,650
And in New York City with a subway
rumbling under foot with where I live, uh,

1162
01:08:05,680 --> 01:08:10,600
that's like 4.5 on the Richter
scale. Yeah. It's something, in fact,

1163
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:14,520
when the World Trade Center
collapsed, uh, that triggered, I made,

1164
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:17,720
I was four blocks away when it
happened. Uh, that triggered,

1165
01:08:17,721 --> 01:08:20,090
I paid very close attention to
everything that was happening,

1166
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:23,180
including what kind of vibration
in the ground that caused.

1167
01:08:23,330 --> 01:08:27,470
And it was about like the a
train going 30 miles an hour, uh,

1168
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:30,380
just below your feet. So when the
train goes, you feel it. Oh yeah. Yeah.

1169
01:08:30,381 --> 01:08:33,830
And you don't, and you ignore it because
it's the normal vibrations of life.

1170
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,040
So that's city living. Yeah, it's
the three to three and four. So,

1171
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:40,490
and so you look at the
earthquake accounting,

1172
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:44,960
there are tons of these and so they
don't really matter until it can

1173
01:08:44,961 --> 01:08:49,600
structurally hurt something. And then you
talk about it becomes a news item. So,

1174
01:08:49,601 --> 01:08:51,560
so the count of earthquakes
is not interesting.

1175
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:53,540
You want the number of
earthquakes above seven,

1176
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:58,430
above six and a half above five.
They start getting interesting.

1177
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:02,660
Uh, but not lethal yet,
you know? So, uh, yeah.

1178
01:09:02,661 --> 01:09:05,330
You want it set your threshold
then give me the number.

1179
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,360
So are those earthquakes of
small ones like the Elson once,

1180
01:09:08,361 --> 01:09:11,210
are they going on everywhere? It's just
they're measuring it and Yellowstone.

1181
01:09:11,211 --> 01:09:14,180
Yeah. Well some, there's more. It
goes, some places are more GL active,

1182
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:15,800
geologically active than others.

1183
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:19,130
Places that are geologically active where
you get the occasional seven, eight,

1184
01:09:19,131 --> 01:09:23,030
nine or seven and eight on the Richter
scale or whatever the scale is called

1185
01:09:23,031 --> 01:09:26,720
today. Uh, those places you getting these
low ones practically all the time. Yeah.

1186
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:27,950
Oh, all the time. Okay.

1187
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,940
So freaking out about Yellowstone having
2000 earthquakes like really should

1188
01:09:31,941 --> 01:09:35,420
freak out about 2007.
Yeah, that's exactly right.

1189
01:09:35,630 --> 01:09:39,620
And this is another one of
these things where, uh, it's,

1190
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:44,650
it's partial information scaled up
into a catastrophe scenario that feeds

1191
01:09:45,381 --> 01:09:50,190
people's fears and that the kind
of fear that people delight in, uh,

1192
01:09:50,510 --> 01:09:51,291
people say, Oh, you don't,

1193
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:54,190
Manhattan has a fault line
running right down the middle.

1194
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:59,120
Manhattan were 3 million
people live and work and yeah,

1195
01:09:59,121 --> 01:10:02,600
it does.
And it's been dead for a million years.

1196
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:07,190
That's a geologically dead fault.
Okay. So it hasn't moved in a million.

1197
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:10,220
I don't know the number,
but it's, it's dead. I mean,
it's nothing happening there.

1198
01:10:10,270 --> 01:10:13,670
We've, we've got, you know, the
place swings on it. There's not,

1199
01:10:14,890 --> 01:10:18,440
and part of it is what created Harlem
Heights, which overlooks Harlem. In fact,

1200
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:22,470
when Columbia moved in, they renamed
it. It's, it's actually called, um,

1201
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,520
they call it, uh, Morningside heights,
but it's actually Harlem heights and uh,

1202
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:28,640
that's a raised part of Manhattan.

1203
01:10:28,940 --> 01:10:32,420
It's a well above the lower areas where
the rest of Harlem is. It's, it's,

1204
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:36,650
it's a cool, so at Manhattan's has
some remnant geologic features.

1205
01:10:36,651 --> 01:10:41,060
Not all of it has been a bulldoze over
to put skyscrapers. That's fascinating.

1206
01:10:41,061 --> 01:10:44,490
I didn't know that it was actually above
it because of, of Oh, because of a fault.

1207
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:46,120
It's a fault line.
Fascinating.

1208
01:10:46,121 --> 01:10:48,770
Fault line is some of that
was retained in central park.

1209
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:51,950
They left some geologically
interesting features there. Uh,

1210
01:10:52,100 --> 01:10:56,840
but the point is there
earthquakes down to level two.

1211
01:10:56,841 --> 01:10:58,190
What were measurable there.

1212
01:10:58,191 --> 01:11:02,690
It happens all the time in most places
and they ha they happen often in most

1213
01:11:02,691 --> 01:11:07,490
places and and practically continuously
where you are geologically active and

1214
01:11:07,491 --> 01:11:09,760
for folks don't know what we were talking
about earlier when we set a called

1215
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:13,310
Darryl volcano. Essentially what it
is is a volcano that when it blows,

1216
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:17,220
it leaves like almost like a crater.
It leaves like a gigantic,

1217
01:11:17,221 --> 01:11:19,890
I think it's 300 kilometers
wide in a super volcano.

1218
01:11:19,891 --> 01:11:23,640
You basically repave
major land areas of earth.

1219
01:11:23,740 --> 01:11:28,740
Do you know Venus has very few craters
on it and given its age and the fact that

1220
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:35,060
there is no rain or weather
systems that could erode them,

1221
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:39,330
you can ask,
well what's going on there?

1222
01:11:39,331 --> 01:11:44,331
And further analysis shows that Venus
completely repaved it's surface at regular

1223
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:49,410
intervals that if you
can pull enough lava,

1224
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:52,440
which is just liquid rock
right it liquid rock,

1225
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,620
you pull it out of the liquified layers
of the planet and put it on the surface,

1226
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,280
it'll spill out,

1227
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,340
spread around and cover up all craters
that might've been there before.

1228
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,410
Do you know what we see?
You know the sea of tranquility?

1229
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,960
What does that tell everybody?
Spot in the moon it's, it's,

1230
01:12:09,970 --> 01:12:10,890
it's a place on the moon.

1231
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:15,510
It's called a c because back before
we knew anything about the moon,

1232
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:19,890
it was a large dark area,
flat, dark area of the moon.

1233
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,580
And we imagined that maybe there's
water there and if there's water there,

1234
01:12:23,581 --> 01:12:26,790
and so we,
there's their regions called cs.

1235
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,910
You know what these actually are there.
They're volcanic basins.

1236
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:32,430
When the moon was geologically active,

1237
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,520
lava spilled out but spread all over the
surface of the moon as far as it could

1238
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:39,840
reach.
And these became what we,

1239
01:12:39,841 --> 01:12:44,340
today we call seeds and you know the
CS happened very late because they have

1240
01:12:44,341 --> 01:12:49,020
fewer craters then adjacent areas
where the lava did not spill in.

1241
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,910
So you could date the surface of the,

1242
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:55,680
of the moon based on how many craters
there are within a given area.

1243
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,600
Do you ever feel like,

1244
01:12:57,630 --> 01:13:01,530
you mean since your fascination is
space quite sensitive to finish that?

1245
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:05,970
So on Venus where there are
very few craters, when we
know there should be many,

1246
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:11,270
that tells us that the entire surface
suffers from fresh and volcanic flow.

1247
01:13:12,151 --> 01:13:15,590
Unlike the moon with the last
time it laid out, the CS is,

1248
01:13:15,650 --> 01:13:16,920
is billions of years ago.

1249
01:13:17,070 --> 01:13:20,370
So he's been is just constant
Superbowl constantly essentially. Yeah.

1250
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,950
When you see something like the moon,
which is completely covered in uh,

1251
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,540
in,
in meteor impacts,

1252
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:32,960
it's one of the things that really sets
into my mind or it gives me a reference

1253
01:13:33,121 --> 01:13:36,780
point for time because we've,
we out,

1254
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:39,570
we aren't seeing these big
impacts on a regular basis.

1255
01:13:39,571 --> 01:13:43,410
And in fact we've only recorded a few
of them. What the recent one in Jupiter,

1256
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:47,710
this massive one which was by yeah.
Which an amateur astronomer, right? Yeah.

1257
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,770
Caught it. And the, uh, the, the blonde,

1258
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,830
there's a flash of light on Jupiter
just by accident. Car. Yeah. Yeah.

1259
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:56,670
And then there was the other one, the one
that was observed and it was a 94. Yeah.

1260
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:01,140
The big one. Uh, when was that? Yeah, so
that one was commit shoemaker. Levy nine.

1261
01:14:01,420 --> 01:14:02,730
Yeah.
And that one,

1262
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:07,760
it was a comment that the tidal forces
of Jupiter on a previous pass had broken

1263
01:14:08,911 --> 01:14:12,430
that solid comment up into two smaller,

1264
01:14:12,431 --> 01:14:15,460
but still significant
chunks of content material.

1265
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:19,900
And it had a trajectory that was headed
straight for Jupiter and we were ready

1266
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:24,010
for it. And the Hubble telescope was
in place and everybody was aiming.

1267
01:14:24,220 --> 01:14:28,270
And each one of these blobs of
comment that fell into Jupiter,

1268
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,540
it plunged into the atmosphere and
exploded with more energy than all the

1269
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:38,170
atomic, all the bombs in the
American arsenal. And so the,

1270
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,430
the,
sorry,

1271
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:43,690
a better way to say that is it plunged
with more energy than the impact that

1272
01:14:43,691 --> 01:14:47,650
rendered the dinosaurs that rendered
the dinosaurs extinct on earth.

1273
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:51,880
And so to get a sense of the energetics
of the solar system is extraordinary.

1274
01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:52,470
And this,

1275
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:56,620
so the solar system to get to your point
is a shooting gallery and moon the moon,

1276
01:14:56,621 --> 01:14:58,450
which is sitting right
in front of our nose.

1277
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:03,870
It's our nearest neighbor that writ
large is the evidence of what earth plows

1278
01:15:05,561 --> 01:15:10,180
through daily. And we are protected
by our atmosphere from most of it.

1279
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,970
And, um, the, my other point was

1280
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:15,740
that when you see that and
you see all the impacts,

1281
01:15:15,741 --> 01:15:19,640
that there's so many impacts when you
try to wrap your head around how many

1282
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:24,620
years, a million years is how many
years a billion people have. It's, it's,

1283
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,740
it's one of the hardest possible.
Our brains are

1284
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:32,860
wired for understanding whether we'll
be eaten by a tiger or lion or right,

1285
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:35,780
or whether you know,

1286
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:40,781
the space and time our minds interact
with it in very terrestrial ways.

1287
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:48,320
With the advent of the telescope and our
understandings of the laws of physics,

1288
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:53,450
we've had to come to an understanding
of the depth of time and the expanse of

1289
01:15:53,451 --> 01:15:58,451
space that completely transcends what
it is natural for us to contemplate.

1290
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:04,610
And so you have to almost grow accustomed
to these facts rather than take them

1291
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:09,440
into your heart because they fall so far
beyond anything we've been trained to

1292
01:16:09,441 --> 01:16:10,274
think about.

1293
01:16:10,610 --> 01:16:13,830
And that's why it's so hard for anyone
to believe that you can go from micro

1294
01:16:13,831 --> 01:16:18,831
organism to a giraffe or a human being
over the billions of years in the cycle

1295
01:16:19,011 --> 01:16:23,530
of life. Do you believe in evolution?
I, it's not a matter of belief.

1296
01:16:24,170 --> 01:16:27,350
It's what the evidence shows. And,
and when I'm given the choice,

1297
01:16:27,351 --> 01:16:28,340
I'm going with the evidence.

1298
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:31,630
And that's silly.
That's a ridiculous way to live.

1299
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:37,690
Um, whatever the depth, the depth of time,

1300
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,100
just like a piece of rock, like the
moon, where you see all those impacts,

1301
01:16:42,101 --> 01:16:46,480
you think, how long is that? What
am I looking at? I mean, how much,

1302
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:50,830
how much time did it take for all those
rocks to fly at a space and hit that?

1303
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,080
And as a temporary organism,

1304
01:16:53,081 --> 01:16:58,081
you being a human being who has this
sort of terrestrial fascination,

1305
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:03,510
it's gotta be like almost like a mad
race to collect information and an imp.

1306
01:17:03,830 --> 01:17:06,130
Infinitely impossible universe.

1307
01:17:06,131 --> 01:17:10,190
We are like mayflies in the
cosmos. Yeah. And not even that.

1308
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:12,500
Think about it. A may fly.
Not even that. That's right.

1309
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:17,600
I think of what doesn't mayfly
know of a change of seasons. Yeah.

1310
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:18,800
For change of years.

1311
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:23,801
These are unfathomably long timescales
to the lifecycle of a mayfly generations.

1312
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:27,770
Yeah.
And so under moms and so here we are.

1313
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,870
We're not for the methods
and tools of science,

1314
01:17:29,871 --> 01:17:34,871
we would have no clue about the universe
of time and the universe of space that

1315
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:38,090
exists beyond the,

1316
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:42,140
the physical accessibility
of our biological form.

1317
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:46,790
So, uh, when you, so,

1318
01:17:46,791 --> 01:17:51,791
so interesting analogy to this I think
is when you look up at a puffy cloud to

1319
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:55,340
you, it's just a cloud sitting
there and it has a shape,

1320
01:17:55,850 --> 01:17:58,490
but we've all seen timelapse of clouds.

1321
01:17:58,510 --> 01:18:03,270
It's particularly rainclouds
that's a turbulent place. The,

1322
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:06,420
the bubbles of cloud and
particularly the Cumulonimbus,

1323
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:10,760
they're just gurgling up there boiling
up through the center and it keeps

1324
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:13,520
regenerating and rain is
coming out the bottom.

1325
01:18:13,820 --> 01:18:18,380
And that doesn't take much of a
time lapsed a video to capture,

1326
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:23,540
uh, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. But that's
not our understanding of clouds.

1327
01:18:23,541 --> 01:18:28,310
Our understanding is that there are just
these things peacefully floating there

1328
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:33,410
and that's just human perception
versus a 15 minute time lapse video.

1329
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:38,980
Imagine human perception versus the
billions of years of cosmic evolution than

1330
01:18:39,111 --> 01:18:44,040
it really is a shooting gallery. We
don't stand a chance when when you, you,

1331
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:46,760
you see the, you're
right on that fella. Yup.

1332
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:50,170
What happened when you see the potential,
uh,

1333
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,580
have hazards and catastrophes a space and
you think about the temporary lifespan

1334
01:18:55,610 --> 01:18:59,240
of the human being, does it,
does it frustrate you at all,

1335
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:02,900
miss it as if it does it seem like, God,
I'm going to miss a lot of shit. Well,

1336
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:04,460
there's several consequences.

1337
01:19:04,461 --> 01:19:09,020
One of them is we don't know
how to understand those dangers.

1338
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:12,860
If I say a killer asteroid is going
to come every hundred million years,

1339
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,520
you'll say, ah, don't worry
about it. But when it comes,

1340
01:19:16,521 --> 01:19:20,540
it'll render you extinct and we don't
know when it's going to come between now

1341
01:19:20,541 --> 01:19:21,980
and a hundred million years from now,

1342
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:26,090
do you even have the temerity to say,
well,

1343
01:19:26,091 --> 01:19:31,091
I'd better build a protection plan and
on the possibility that it comes in my

1344
01:19:31,491 --> 01:19:35,870
lifetime or in the lifetime of all my
loved generation generations that follow,

1345
01:19:36,220 --> 01:19:39,440
we, we don't know how to react.
We're not wired for some thought.

1346
01:19:39,650 --> 01:19:41,780
Let me tell you how badly we're
not wired for that thought.

1347
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:47,660
What happens after a hurricane devastates
a coastline where rebuild, we rebuild,

1348
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,860
oh, it's not going to happen to me. Oh,
this is stuff within your lifetime, right?

1349
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:55,940
This is the, the 20 year hurricane,
the 30 year hurricane, not the,

1350
01:19:56,150 --> 01:20:00,870
not the 200 year, 500,000
year hurricane. So are,

1351
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,260
unfortunately,
our brains aren't wired for this.

1352
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:08,560
So it's a good thing that we have methods
and tools that can compensate for this

1353
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:09,743
shortcoming.

1354
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:14,780
Do we have any sort of scientific plan
to handle asteroid impacts to a paper?

1355
01:20:15,810 --> 01:20:17,970
Oh yeah. We've got a total
solution. Worked out in paper.

1356
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,820
Completely unfunded at the moment.
And when you say on paper,

1357
01:20:20,821 --> 01:20:23,880
is it for like you can do the engineering,
you can do the engineering and,

1358
01:20:23,910 --> 01:20:27,900
and it's, it's, it'll work. What do they,
physics and engineering, what do they do?

1359
01:20:27,901 --> 01:20:31,500
They knock it out of orbit or something.
You know, if you're macho, if you're,

1360
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:37,410
if you're below the sucker out, that's
just the loan approach, I guess.

1361
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,890
I forgot it been hawking and we
came to an MMA guy here, right?

1362
01:20:40,891 --> 01:20:45,420
Or would it Jujitsu? So
though the different solutions
that the problem is, yeah,

1363
01:20:45,421 --> 01:20:49,770
we could conceivably blow the thing up.
But as Americans,

1364
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:54,420
we're really good at blowing stuff up
and we're less good at knowing where the

1365
01:20:54,421 --> 01:20:55,800
pieces land afterwards.

1366
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:59,700
So I don't want to blow this thing into
six pieces and still have all those six

1367
01:20:59,701 --> 01:21:03,270
pieces headed towards earth.
Right. All right, so the kinder,

1368
01:21:03,271 --> 01:21:07,980
gentler solution is to deflect it from
harm's way and there's something called a

1369
01:21:07,981 --> 01:21:10,470
gravitational tractor beam essentially.
I mean,

1370
01:21:10,471 --> 01:21:14,250
that's the poetic way to say the
Saifai way to say it, but really you,

1371
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:19,280
you put up a space pod out there that
has a gravitational field that attracts

1372
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:24,150
slowly, attracts the asteroid
into a slightly different orbit.

1373
01:21:24,151 --> 01:21:25,530
And if you get there early enough,

1374
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:30,120
you don't have to deflect
it by much because that
deflection accumulates and all

1375
01:21:30,121 --> 01:21:34,770
you needed to do is Miss Earth. Now it's
still out there to harm you another day.

1376
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:38,380
But if you get good at this, you just
have, you know, just like you have the,

1377
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:42,690
the block protection nighttime protection
force, you know, in the neighborhood.

1378
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:43,381
Well,

1379
01:21:43,381 --> 01:21:46,830
you'd have the asteroid protection for
us and that would be protecting earth

1380
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:50,460
from asteroids. And Jupiter protects
us from most asteroids. Right?

1381
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:54,930
Well for most of the things that haul
their way in from outside the solar system

1382
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,140
comets, most asteroids are
within the orbit of Jupiter.

1383
01:21:58,141 --> 01:22:02,850
So Jupiter doesn't need to protect us
from them. Well, we, we would want it to.

1384
01:22:02,851 --> 01:22:06,780
It just doesn't because they know their
orbits don't reach Jupiter for enough to

1385
01:22:06,781 --> 01:22:11,310
Jupiter to bat it into a new place.
But comments that come from far,

1386
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:15,690
far beyond the orbit of
Jupiter, Jupiter's, they,
when they come near Jupiter,

1387
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:20,960
they feel Jupiter's titanic gravitational
field and Jupiter basically bends them

1388
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:22,470
into a new orbit.

1389
01:22:22,471 --> 01:22:26,820
And so many of them don't even make it
past Earth's orbit on its way towards the

1390
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:27,870
Sun. I mean, they,

1391
01:22:27,930 --> 01:22:32,580
so these new orbits clears the space
for our survival here on earth.

1392
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,070
And so Jupiter is our
friend. It's, it's our,

1393
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:37,740
it's our friend that takes care
of the bullies in the school yard.

1394
01:22:37,770 --> 01:22:39,900
Do we know enough about,
uh,

1395
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,140
other solar systems to know whether
or not this is a typical setup?

1396
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:44,790
It was our urge,

1397
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,260
given what's called the Copernican
principle to say that we're not special,

1398
01:22:49,261 --> 01:22:54,261
where average and if we're average than
other solar systems should look like us

1399
01:22:55,110 --> 01:22:58,380
because the sun is kind
of average and you know,

1400
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:02,820
we're not on the little list planet or
the biggest planet you just so you make

1401
01:23:02,821 --> 01:23:04,350
some some assumptions.

1402
01:23:05,350 --> 01:23:08,740
As the star systems
came into the catalogs,

1403
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:13,600
as our techniques and methods to observe
other planets in the solar system arose,

1404
01:23:14,050 --> 01:23:16,930
we started to learn that our
solar system is not typical,

1405
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:18,760
that most solar systems,

1406
01:23:18,761 --> 01:23:23,050
most star systems have a Jupiter size
object much closer to their host star.

1407
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:26,050
Then our Jupiter is. So
then we say, well way,

1408
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:30,940
well then why is our star system different
from theirs? And so it's a frontier.

1409
01:23:30,941 --> 01:23:34,750
It's an active frontier and no one is
putting their bets on any one kind of

1410
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:38,170
solar system as being the most
representative. And, and we're,

1411
01:23:38,171 --> 01:23:40,300
we're building the catalog now.
So,

1412
01:23:40,330 --> 01:23:45,040
so the catalog that has
700 or so exoplanets in it,

1413
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:49,000
that's only 500 star systems met,
we're,

1414
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:54,270
we're now building the catalogs of the
secondary tertiary planets in the star

1415
01:23:54,311 --> 01:23:55,750
systems that we've already discovered.

1416
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:58,720
So that's quite a lot of binary
star systems as well, right?

1417
01:23:58,721 --> 01:24:02,950
Where there's more than one son. Oh, well
first, if you look up at the night sky,

1418
01:24:02,980 --> 01:24:06,130
almost half of all the
dots of light you see,

1419
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,210
if you pull out a telescope will reveal
themselves to be binary or triple star

1420
01:24:10,211 --> 01:24:11,270
systems.
It is a,

1421
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,440
it is as common as the breeze in the
universe with the challenge here is what

1422
01:24:16,781 --> 01:24:20,800
happens to a planet in orbit around
a binary or multiple star system.

1423
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:25,150
That's the challenge. And is the
atmosphere stable enough to support that?

1424
01:24:25,151 --> 01:24:27,340
That would be a concern no
matter where the planet is.

1425
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:32,400
But here's the challenge with a multi
star star system as the planet orbits,

1426
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:37,660
maybe it'll get really close to one
star and really far from another,

1427
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:42,990
and maybe the orbit is entangled between
the two of them trying to do figure

1428
01:24:43,481 --> 01:24:47,860
eights,
that if you have an unstable orbit,

1429
01:24:49,090 --> 01:24:53,020
you're likely to eject the planet
forever into interstellar space.

1430
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:54,273
And in fact,

1431
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:59,400
data are now showing that interstellar
space may have more rogue planets that

1432
01:25:00,071 --> 01:25:04,750
had been ejected at for having misbehaved
orbits from their star system than

1433
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:09,490
there are stars within planetary systems
themselves. Blew my fucking mind.

1434
01:25:09,491 --> 01:25:12,730
They're called rogue planets. No, no.
Let me, no, I didn't even know. No, I,

1435
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:14,620
I'm just beginning here.
So Watch.

1436
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:19,830
So we also know that many planets have
still retained their heat of formation

1437
01:25:20,051 --> 01:25:23,320
long after they, they've,
they've come into existence.

1438
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:28,330
Earth still has heat churning a source
of energy that is not traceable to the

1439
01:25:28,331 --> 01:25:32,590
sun. This is what creates the magma
that's sitting below Earth's crust.

1440
01:25:32,620 --> 01:25:36,220
The son didn't eat that.
That's heat generated within the earth.

1441
01:25:36,221 --> 01:25:37,930
Some is leftover from formation.

1442
01:25:38,230 --> 01:25:41,830
Others is created from
radioactive decay of elements.

1443
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:47,100
But we've got an energy source and our
biology books from decades ago said,

1444
01:25:47,291 --> 01:25:51,610
life needs sunlight. No, no,
no, no. Life needs energy.

1445
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:56,350
It doesn't care if it comes from the sun
and all Kanick vents at the bottom of

1446
01:25:56,351 --> 01:25:58,690
the sea with no sunlight.
For example,

1447
01:25:58,691 --> 01:26:02,110
the the Juan de Fuca
Ridge off of the coast of,

1448
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:07,410
of Washington is a vent in the bottom
of the ocean that is releasing the heat

1449
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:12,350
from below and it's an energy source.

1450
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,590
It's at the bottom of the ocean where the,
where the sun don't shine,

1451
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:19,790
where the sun don't reach,
and yet there's life form thriving.

1452
01:26:19,790 --> 01:26:23,330
Their existing on a form
of Geo chemical energy.

1453
01:26:23,630 --> 01:26:25,400
It's got nothing to do with the son.

1454
01:26:25,910 --> 01:26:30,910
The fact that we've discovered exotic
life on earth has broadened the net that

1455
01:26:31,521 --> 01:26:36,470
we have cast into space in our
search for life in the universe.

1456
01:26:36,590 --> 01:26:41,590
No longer do we need to look for the
72 degree pond in an oxygen atmosphere

1457
01:26:41,991 --> 01:26:44,120
planet in our search for life.

1458
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:47,960
It so this goldilocks zone where
everything had to be perfect.

1459
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,680
We've got life thriving in
places that would kill us.

1460
01:26:51,890 --> 01:26:53,570
And we are not the measure,

1461
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:58,720
the ultimate measure of what the
conditions that life requires to survive.

1462
01:26:59,540 --> 01:27:02,660
So now that we're looking
with this very broad net,

1463
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:05,930
we can say to ourselves
for these vagabond planets,

1464
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:09,020
if they still have their source
of energy churning within,

1465
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:13,130
maybe there's life there.
And if that's the case,

1466
01:27:13,460 --> 01:27:16,190
the galaxy could be teeming with life.

1467
01:27:16,490 --> 01:27:21,320
And the fact that we're focusing our
search on planets around stars may simply

1468
01:27:21,321 --> 01:27:24,680
be limiting all that we
can discover in the cosmos.

1469
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:30,250
So these planets could essentially be
spaceships filled with life forms headed

1470
01:27:31,311 --> 01:27:35,780
our way and they might even slam into
us. Well, metaphorical space ships. Yeah.

1471
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:38,990
And the problem is since they're,
they're homeless,

1472
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:41,150
there's nothing to eliminate them.

1473
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:44,670
So their pitch black fly into the galaxy.

1474
01:27:44,671 --> 01:27:47,030
And now if some of the
heat reaches the surface,

1475
01:27:47,120 --> 01:27:50,210
you can use infrared telescopes
that might pick them up.

1476
01:27:50,660 --> 01:27:54,740
But we don't, we wouldn't
even know where to look. Well,

1477
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,110
isn't that the thought about the,
uh,

1478
01:27:57,111 --> 01:28:01,580
the object that they believe is
somewhere outside of the Kuyper belt?

1479
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:04,370
Is that what I say it
wiper Kuyper. Yeah. Yeah,

1480
01:28:04,371 --> 01:28:08,990
so this is an astronomer and mid 20th
century who hypothesized that beyond the

1481
01:28:08,991 --> 01:28:09,950
outermost planet,

1482
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:15,220
they would be sort of the leftovers of
the solar system that didn't collect into

1483
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:18,770
a bonafide red blooded planet,
but it should still,

1484
01:28:18,771 --> 01:28:22,640
the residue should still be out there
because if you're a residue in an orbit

1485
01:28:22,641 --> 01:28:26,030
where red blooded planet exists,
you're going to collide with that planet.

1486
01:28:26,030 --> 01:28:29,420
Eventually you're going to merge with
the planet and make that planet even

1487
01:28:29,421 --> 01:28:30,254
bigger.

1488
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:35,380
This is one of the failed criteria
for Pluto being classified as a planet

1489
01:28:36,651 --> 01:28:40,520
because it is in a zone in the solar
system that has not cleared its orbit.

1490
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,530
It is in the Kuyper belt in
the inner edge of it. Yes,

1491
01:28:45,650 --> 01:28:46,730
but it is.
It is.

1492
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:51,350
It is joined by countless
thousands of other icy bodies.

1493
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:55,700
Earth. Yes, we plow through crap in
the, in our, in our orbit, but it's,

1494
01:28:55,850 --> 01:29:00,850
it is the ratio of the mass of the
stuff we plow into to mass is like gnats

1495
01:29:02,731 --> 01:29:06,210
flying into an elephant. All right?
It doesn't knock over the elephant.

1496
01:29:06,211 --> 01:29:07,860
It is of no concern to the elephant.

1497
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:13,050
Anything that could still possibly
collide with us earth won't even care,

1498
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:16,320
will care because it'll affect
the echo system. But Earth,

1499
01:29:16,321 --> 01:29:20,070
the planet is so much more massive than
anything we would ever collide with.

1500
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:22,110
From now to the end of the solar system,

1501
01:29:22,350 --> 01:29:26,340
we have basically cleared our orbit
of anything dangerous Pluto has not.

1502
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:31,700
So that was a damning fact in the ruling
that got demoted from planet to planet,

1503
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,820
that it doesn't have enough mass to
attract all the other objects that are

1504
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:39,240
nearby and neither does anything else.
And so it's just a swarm of comments.

1505
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:42,810
The Kuyper belt of comments.
So now if you go beyond the Kuiper belt,

1506
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:46,290
you're so far from the sun.
If you're going to talk to us,

1507
01:29:46,291 --> 01:29:50,330
it would be through reflected
sunlight. But he's so far away. Yeah,

1508
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:54,540
it's the [inaudible]. These things
are really dark objects to begin with.

1509
01:29:54,541 --> 01:29:56,610
So how do they find
them? Well, it'd be hard.

1510
01:29:56,611 --> 01:30:00,450
So it's possible you can have a big
object. Well beyond the Kuyper belt.

1511
01:30:00,451 --> 01:30:05,070
It would just be really hard to
find. Um, and I can say without,

1512
01:30:05,230 --> 01:30:09,540
without hesitation that if
there's a huge objects out there,

1513
01:30:09,690 --> 01:30:13,800
it's gravity is of no
consequence to anything that's
going on between us and the

1514
01:30:13,801 --> 01:30:14,620
Kuyper belt.

1515
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:18,420
I just thought it was fascinating because
the idea was that there was a Jupiter

1516
01:30:18,421 --> 01:30:22,470
sized planets so far outside of our solar
system or what we consider our solar

1517
01:30:22,471 --> 01:30:23,160
system,

1518
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,970
that it was causing some sort of a
gravitational effect on the Kuyper belt.

1519
01:30:26,971 --> 01:30:30,450
Knows what you might be remembering is,
uh,

1520
01:30:30,630 --> 01:30:35,040
the nemesis object. What does that, okay.
You didn't anybody remember him? Okay,

1521
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:38,760
now,
now I'm feeding your my doom and gloom.

1522
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:44,160
You're doing let the record show the
man's eyebrows moved up into his forehead.

1523
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:47,510
So,
um,

1524
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:51,780
there was an analysis of the extinction
episodes in the history of the earth

1525
01:30:52,350 --> 01:30:56,580
that suggested that perhaps
they were episodic or periodic,

1526
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,760
every sort of 20 million years or so.

1527
01:30:59,761 --> 01:31:04,400
There was a little dip in the
fossil record and we said,
well, all right, you know,

1528
01:31:04,410 --> 01:31:04,741
by the way,

1529
01:31:04,741 --> 01:31:09,741
geologists look for indicators in the
fossil record and in the rock record to

1530
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:16,020
demark where one error, one period,
one epoch begins. And another one ends.

1531
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:21,150
So for example, the dinosaurs
croaked at the beginning, Eh,

1532
01:31:21,180 --> 01:31:24,720
65 million years ago at the KT boundary,
it's got some other name lately.

1533
01:31:24,721 --> 01:31:28,350
I haven't kept up with that, but that
boundary, they knew it was a boundary.

1534
01:31:28,351 --> 01:31:32,170
So they dated, they called
that a different geologic, um,

1535
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:36,690
zone that which followed 65 million years
ago compared to that which came before

1536
01:31:36,691 --> 01:31:39,930
it and did they did that long before
they knew what the hell happened there.

1537
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:43,090
We would later learn that an asteroid
struck and there might've been there,

1538
01:31:43,091 --> 01:31:46,900
surely worse, some super
volcano activity, uh,

1539
01:31:46,930 --> 01:31:48,600
and it would've called the Deccan traps.

1540
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:52,050
And so there's a lot of bad stuff
going on in the earth at that time.

1541
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:53,940
So it was a hostile to life.

1542
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,350
We lost 70% of the world's life
species in that period of time,

1543
01:31:58,740 --> 01:32:02,560
right? 65 million years ago
was devastating. So, uh, the,

1544
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:06,430
the awesome for us because that's
how we hear, right? Yeah. In fact,

1545
01:32:06,431 --> 01:32:10,600
flowering plants, so asteroids are
a friend. They reset the world.

1546
01:32:10,630 --> 01:32:13,270
They had a fucked up environment.
It was a bad neighborhood.

1547
01:32:13,271 --> 01:32:17,110
Dinosaurs were everywhere. We
bad for us. We were just wrapped.

1548
01:32:17,111 --> 01:32:21,310
We were scurrying underfoot
as early rodents. Yes.

1549
01:32:21,610 --> 01:32:24,580
And we were just hors d'oeuvres
for t racks basically.

1550
01:32:24,581 --> 01:32:27,550
And you take them out
of the ecological niche,

1551
01:32:27,551 --> 01:32:32,010
we can then aspire to, to evolve to
something more interesting than a treat,

1552
01:32:32,011 --> 01:32:35,800
something that can consider the
Kuyper belt test. And so, so,

1553
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:39,820
so it was imagine that maybe there's
an object out there that's so far away,

1554
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:40,810
you can't see it,

1555
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:46,350
but it's on this huge looping orbit that
comes by the Sun every 20 million years

1556
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:52,720
because that's the cycle of
these extinction episodes.
And if that's the case, no,

1557
01:32:52,750 --> 01:32:56,620
it doesn't hit us.
It has to stay around for the next cycle.

1558
01:32:56,621 --> 01:32:57,760
So what does it do?

1559
01:32:58,180 --> 01:33:03,180
It has a gravitational field that perturbs
these outer comets and sends a reign

1560
01:33:03,731 --> 01:33:05,950
of comments down into
the inner solar system,

1561
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:10,180
creating impact extinctions on a
cycle of every 20 million years.

1562
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:14,980
This was proposed back in the 1980s but
it's not an object that anyone has ever

1563
01:33:14,981 --> 01:33:15,610
seen.

1564
01:33:15,610 --> 01:33:20,610
It's an object whose existence
was in inferred for or,

1565
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:26,240
or asserted based on the record of
extinction in the fossil record of further

1566
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:31,750
analysis of the fossil record doesn't
actually hold up this cyclical extinction

1567
01:33:31,751 --> 01:33:36,010
pattern. It's more, it's more erratic than
that. And so you can't really, so it's,

1568
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:39,130
it's evaporated as a, as an
idea, but it was clever and,

1569
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:41,560
and intriguing and got a lot
of headlines at the time.

1570
01:33:41,561 --> 01:33:45,580
I think it's the same thing that I'm,
what I read, what I read was from 2010,

1571
01:33:45,581 --> 01:33:49,780
it was something about the Oort cloud
who o r t cloud. Yeah. That's a,

1572
01:33:49,781 --> 01:33:54,781
that's a swarm swarm of comets and
not quite halfway to the nearest star,

1573
01:33:55,001 --> 01:33:56,920
but very far out there.

1574
01:33:57,250 --> 01:34:02,250
That is the sort of the outer reaches
of the gravitational grasp of the sun.

1575
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:05,260
This is the case.
If you go much beyond that,

1576
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,220
you're gravitational allegiances uncertain
and you could fall into the next star,

1577
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,940
uh, rather than fall towards
the sun. The guys were,

1578
01:34:11,941 --> 01:34:12,790
I don't know if you've
heard of these guys.

1579
01:34:12,791 --> 01:34:16,630
Astrophysicist John mattise and Daniel
Whitmore from the University of Louisiana

1580
01:34:16,631 --> 01:34:20,440
came up with a theory that said that
something smaller than a Jovian mass would

1581
01:34:20,441 --> 01:34:22,390
not be strong enough to perform this task.

1582
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:27,310
They believe that there's
something up to 25% of them.

1583
01:34:27,910 --> 01:34:28,300
Okay?

1584
01:34:28,300 --> 01:34:33,300
It's four times as big as Jupiter could
be responsible for sending these objects

1585
01:34:33,911 --> 01:34:37,830
in our direction. This is just a random
theory that these guys put together.

1586
01:34:37,831 --> 01:34:40,900
It wasn't completely accepted what they're
doing. What? No, no, no, no. There's no,

1587
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:44,020
there's no known such object what you,
what people are doing,

1588
01:34:44,021 --> 01:34:45,700
and I don't fault them for it.
It's creative.

1589
01:34:45,880 --> 01:34:48,610
It would make awesome science fiction.
Storytelling is,

1590
01:34:48,611 --> 01:34:52,570
there's something you need to explain
here on earth. Somebody went extinct.

1591
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,190
There were some wave of comments.

1592
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:58,160
There's some observation
that never repeated.

1593
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:01,190
There's some thing you got to
come up with and so you say, well,

1594
01:35:01,191 --> 01:35:06,140
we know the Oort cloud exists.
We know you can perturb those orbits and,

1595
01:35:06,141 --> 01:35:10,580
and send them careening down towards
the inner solar system and those,

1596
01:35:10,581 --> 01:35:13,190
that Jupiter doesn't bat
away like batting practice,

1597
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:18,260
those that get through Jupiter's
gravitational shield could wreak havoc on

1598
01:35:18,261 --> 01:35:21,970
earth. Yeah. Yeah. But
that's, it's, it's, it's,

1599
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:25,720
it's inventing a lot to explain
something you don't know. Right.

1600
01:35:26,030 --> 01:35:27,890
So it's inventing more
of what you don't know.

1601
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:33,610
That could be true to explain what you
don't write that which you don't have any

1602
01:35:34,611 --> 01:35:39,440
other evidence to support. So it's fun
speculation, fund speculation. Exactly.

1603
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:42,710
Beyond that to saying, oh, it's
real, it must be happening. No, no.

1604
01:35:42,711 --> 01:35:45,710
It's just let someone write
a good Scifi story on it.

1605
01:35:45,711 --> 01:35:48,440
Here's what's fun about it and
this is why I bring it up. Um,

1606
01:35:48,470 --> 01:35:52,340
most people I've talked to this
about this subject to many,

1607
01:35:52,341 --> 01:35:55,640
many people and, uh, I, myself
personally, I'm not immune to this.

1608
01:35:55,641 --> 01:35:57,440
I find it very fascinating.
However,

1609
01:35:57,441 --> 01:36:02,240
how much have I looked into the actual
planets that we absolutely know are real?

1610
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:03,463
Not that much,

1611
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:06,620
but I'm worried about this fucking
fake planet that may or may not exist,

1612
01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:08,300
do they might've found another planet.

1613
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:11,450
It's this idea of something
hidden and mysterious,

1614
01:36:11,451 --> 01:36:14,870
which is so compelling and attractive.
Nothing fascinating.

1615
01:36:14,871 --> 01:36:17,360
Psychological observation.
It's a weird thing.

1616
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:22,390
We want to believe there's something
mysterious that we don't understand and

1617
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:23,901
could be there,

1618
01:36:23,901 --> 01:36:27,140
but we don't know anything about yet
where there's plenty of things we do know

1619
01:36:27,141 --> 01:36:30,950
something about, but we want to know
more. Why don't you help? Yes. All right.

1620
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:32,390
And by the way,

1621
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:37,420
the universe is far more wondrous
than anything we can imagine.

1622
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:42,260
And so,
so to say,

1623
01:36:42,261 --> 01:36:46,490
I need your creativity
and you know, uh, to,

1624
01:36:46,520 --> 01:36:48,290
to keep your life interesting.
No,

1625
01:36:48,291 --> 01:36:53,291
we got black holes that are
flaying stars layer by layer.

1626
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:56,300
We've got, do you realize that
if you fall into a black hole,

1627
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:59,840
you will see the entire future of the
universe unfold in front of you in a

1628
01:36:59,841 --> 01:37:00,740
matter of moments.

1629
01:37:00,860 --> 01:37:05,240
And you will emerge into another space
time created by the singularity of the

1630
01:37:05,241 --> 01:37:08,420
black hole you just fell into.
He just broke the,

1631
01:37:09,340 --> 01:37:14,150
broke the Hogan and that right there.
So, so let's talk about that. All right.

1632
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:14,601
Yeah.
You know,

1633
01:37:14,601 --> 01:37:17,930
why are we wasting time talking about
whether the Saturn five rocket, I mean,

1634
01:37:18,200 --> 01:37:22,230
cause we're fascinated by shit that's
unproven, mysterious shit. Look,

1635
01:37:22,231 --> 01:37:26,000
I got a broken brain. Okay?
There's a reason for me. You
want some more cool stuff?

1636
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:26,480
All right.

1637
01:37:26,480 --> 01:37:31,480
Mars once had liquid running water
coursing on its surface unquestionably has

1638
01:37:31,910 --> 01:37:36,560
geologic Marzel logic.
Features that are, are, are,

1639
01:37:36,561 --> 01:37:38,780
are, are, are Vic,

1640
01:37:38,781 --> 01:37:42,350
the correspond in every way
to the geologic features.

1641
01:37:42,351 --> 01:37:45,140
You see when you fly over the
Mississippi River, you see,

1642
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:50,090
you see tributaries leading to larger
rivers. You see me hindering pathways.

1643
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:54,320
You See River deltas at the,
at the end of the river basin,

1644
01:37:54,470 --> 01:37:59,310
you see lake beds, you see all
of this. But Mars is bone dry.

1645
01:37:59,311 --> 01:38:00,690
Today something happened to the water.

1646
01:38:00,690 --> 01:38:05,460
We don't know what we're pretty sure
it's sunk down beneath the surface and a

1647
01:38:05,461 --> 01:38:06,720
kind of permafrost.

1648
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,960
My point is if anytime in the past
Mars had liquid running water,

1649
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:16,440
every place on earth, there's
liquid running water, there's life.

1650
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:21,620
There is evidence to think that Mara's
was habitable with liquid running water

1651
01:38:22,110 --> 01:38:26,520
before earth was. We'll see. Then you
just started up another conspiracy theory.

1652
01:38:26,521 --> 01:38:30,960
That's the Richard Hoagland
Group of people that believe
that there was pyramids

1653
01:38:30,961 --> 01:38:35,730
and a face on Mars and there
was civilization. I have
something better than that.

1654
01:38:35,810 --> 01:38:40,740
All right? That if Mars was
fertile for life before earth,

1655
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:43,050
something we learned recently
in the last 10 years,

1656
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:48,180
that asteroid impacts Panspermia.
There you go. I can be strong.

1657
01:38:48,181 --> 01:38:53,181
It can be violent enough that they can
fling surrounding rocks with escape

1658
01:38:53,701 --> 01:38:58,701
philocity into interplanetary space
where they will drift until they are

1659
01:38:59,551 --> 01:39:04,050
attracted by the gravity of some other
planet and they will then fall and land

1660
01:39:04,051 --> 01:39:05,070
on its surface.

1661
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:10,370
If Mars was fertile and
formed life microbial,

1662
01:39:12,661 --> 01:39:17,661
though it may only have been
it's microbial life that
can survive dehydration,

1663
01:39:19,530 --> 01:39:22,410
high radiation,
absence of con,

1664
01:39:22,530 --> 01:39:26,070
we have found what we call
extreme of files on earth. Like I,

1665
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:31,200
like I said a moment ago, that that thrive
under conditions that would kill us.

1666
01:39:31,260 --> 01:39:36,250
High pressure, low pressure,
high temperature, low
temperature, high radiation, uh,

1667
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:41,570
all of these conditions the microbes
would have encountered on Mars bidding,

1668
01:39:42,420 --> 01:39:46,590
thrust into space and
making that journey well,

1669
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:49,410
if that's possible.
And if that's the case,

1670
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:54,950
then life on earth could have been seeded
by life on Mars making every life form

1671
01:39:55,381 --> 01:40:00,060
on earth,
a descendant of Martians.

1672
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,040
More importantly,

1673
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:07,760
why do we have bacteria that could
survive high radiation in the first place?

1674
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:13,620
What business does that have here
beneath Earth's protective atmosphere?

1675
01:40:14,130 --> 01:40:17,280
Thriving in places where
there isn't high radiation,

1676
01:40:18,870 --> 01:40:21,990
we have life forms that can survive.

1677
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:25,710
What that trip through
space would have subject,

1678
01:40:25,740 --> 01:40:27,530
what a trip through space would would've,

1679
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:32,040
what it would have been subjected
to by a trip through space.

1680
01:40:32,190 --> 01:40:33,690
So you have it on now,
by the way,

1681
01:40:34,080 --> 01:40:37,560
life does not evolve the way
anyone typically thinks it does.

1682
01:40:38,280 --> 01:40:42,060
You're not some organism that then adapts
to a new environment. No, you just die.

1683
01:40:43,140 --> 01:40:48,140
The variation in organisms allows some
to thrive in conditions that would

1684
01:40:49,381 --> 01:40:53,740
otherwise kill you. And it's my
genetic offspring that continue.

1685
01:40:54,190 --> 01:40:56,470
Nobody adapted to anything.

1686
01:40:56,650 --> 01:41:01,650
Nature is selecting that subset of
the variation in a generation that has

1687
01:41:02,351 --> 01:41:06,760
survival properties for that
next assault in the environment.

1688
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:11,700
So if Mars is teeming with life and
microbes are flying into the atmosphere,

1689
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:16,720
flying into space as stowaways and
the nooks and crannies of rocks,

1690
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:24,240
then that population will be selected
for those microbes that can survive that

1691
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:25,750
journey through space.

1692
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:30,610
Does a planet need any sort
of an atmosphere in order
to support life or they

1693
01:41:30,611 --> 01:41:32,140
just need water?
Uh,

1694
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:36,580
all we know is what can support life
as we know it, right? All right.

1695
01:41:36,581 --> 01:41:40,180
I don't know if we're inventive enough
to invent other kinds of life form,

1696
01:41:40,690 --> 01:41:43,170
but life as we know,
it requires liquid water because that,

1697
01:41:43,240 --> 01:41:47,740
that is allows nutrients to move
through our vessel that we call our,

1698
01:41:48,130 --> 01:41:51,660
our bodies.
And right on down to microorganisms.

1699
01:41:51,670 --> 01:41:55,870
We all thrive and use liquid water
and we need a, a heat source.

1700
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:57,970
And more specifically a heat gradient.

1701
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:01,900
There has to be a place where there's
more energy in one place than somewhere

1702
01:42:01,901 --> 01:42:04,180
else.
When you have a gradient,

1703
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:08,020
then you can create and sustain
life as we know it. Without that,

1704
01:42:08,021 --> 01:42:09,430
there's no known way to do it.

1705
01:42:09,700 --> 01:42:14,110
So the entropy laws work
against you to make life so.

1706
01:42:14,290 --> 01:42:15,760
So your point is that these,

1707
01:42:16,210 --> 01:42:21,070
it's possible that organisms could
be growing even on asteroids then.

1708
01:42:21,310 --> 01:42:24,700
Oh, sorry. So your point was do
we need an atmosphere? Yeah. Well,

1709
01:42:24,730 --> 01:42:29,730
Le recent evidence suggests that possibly
more than half of the mass of biology,

1710
01:42:33,821 --> 01:42:38,821
the biomass of earth lives and
thrives beneath earth's surface,

1711
01:42:40,900 --> 01:42:45,340
not on its surface.
If that's the case,

1712
01:42:45,640 --> 01:42:48,850
what's going on in the atmosphere
is relatively irrelevant.

1713
01:42:49,390 --> 01:42:54,140
If you're thriving deep within a nook
and cranny of a rock my mile down, uh,

1714
01:42:54,190 --> 01:42:58,240
you know, don't they have
some air down? Yeah, yeah,
there's some air. But you know,

1715
01:42:58,270 --> 01:43:01,210
it's not cycling with what's
going on in our air, you know,

1716
01:43:01,460 --> 01:43:06,010
so the rules become broader or,
or,

1717
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:10,600
or altered from what you would
presume the life requires.

1718
01:43:11,050 --> 01:43:14,380
So to talk about a planet being habitable,

1719
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,920
we should no longer think only of what
the surface of that planet supplies.

1720
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:24,850
We need to think more broadly about what
could go on deep within its surface as

1721
01:43:24,851 --> 01:43:25,031
well.

1722
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:29,320
We're pretty sure there
are no large macroscopic
organisms lumbering around like

1723
01:43:29,321 --> 01:43:31,580
an journey to the center of the Earth,
uh,

1724
01:43:31,690 --> 01:43:36,370
of Jules Verne where they're
creatures down there, you
know, no hollow earth. Yeah.

1725
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,550
Hollow Earth. Now there's no
evidence that we have huge creatures.

1726
01:43:39,790 --> 01:43:44,790
The pressures and the behavior of
material doesn't allow there to be huge

1727
01:43:46,031 --> 01:43:50,260
cavities that haven't over the billions
of years completely been filled in.

1728
01:43:51,100 --> 01:43:55,670
When I say huge, I mean, you know,
uh, you know, hundreds of miles large,

1729
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:56,421
no,
the,

1730
01:43:56,421 --> 01:44:01,421
the system would collapse
into that rapidly and you
can get smaller cabinet like

1731
01:44:01,641 --> 01:44:05,360
Carlsbad caverns, that sort of
thing. But, but nothing, you know,

1732
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:10,420
a staggeringly large now when you consider
all the possibilities for life in the

1733
01:44:12,981 --> 01:44:16,460
universe, which are, you know,
almost infinite, right? Yeah.

1734
01:44:16,461 --> 01:44:20,540
They're probably more ways to make life
than we haven't thought of then the way

1735
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:23,510
to make life that is,
that we know of, you know,

1736
01:44:23,511 --> 01:44:27,940
here on earth w it would just not
imaginative. We just don't, uh,

1737
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:33,110
you know, I'm reminded of if
I get a little literate on
you for the moment, uh, in,

1738
01:44:33,150 --> 01:44:34,700
uh,
the late 18th century,

1739
01:44:34,910 --> 01:44:39,120
there's a book published
called Cosmo Pharaohs by um,

1740
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:41,300
a Christian Huggins.
And he was a,

1741
01:44:41,301 --> 01:44:45,140
he was a polymath that he was a great
in math and physics and biology.

1742
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:50,290
He wrote a book exploring what life might
be like on all the planets and listen

1743
01:44:50,371 --> 01:44:55,310
to this reasoning. This is, this is
hilarious. He said Jupiter, well,

1744
01:44:55,311 --> 01:45:00,311
it's clear it's got an atmosphere because
through a telescope you see bands of

1745
01:45:00,351 --> 01:45:04,460
gas moving across its surface.
Well, if it has an atmosphere,

1746
01:45:04,461 --> 01:45:07,660
then life forms,
they're a,

1747
01:45:07,670 --> 01:45:12,380
would probably exploit that atmosphere
the way we do because it has an

1748
01:45:12,381 --> 01:45:16,220
atmosphere. It means it probably has
rain because we get rain out of habit.

1749
01:45:16,280 --> 01:45:20,630
Our atmosphere, if it has rain, it
must have oceans. If it has oceans,

1750
01:45:20,631 --> 01:45:23,420
they must need a means for gathering,
for traveling.

1751
01:45:23,660 --> 01:45:27,230
So they would build ships with sales,

1752
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,000
and if those ships have sales, they would
need rope. So they probably have him.

1753
01:45:33,710 --> 01:45:38,040
Wow. So this was obviously
extrapolation to an extreme. Right.

1754
01:45:38,450 --> 01:45:40,940
But just it analyze that
for one split second,

1755
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:46,360
every supposition was founded rooted
in what we do as humans and there's no

1756
01:45:49,131 --> 01:45:53,540
greater hubris than to presume that what
we find somewhere else would be just

1757
01:45:53,541 --> 01:45:57,020
like us or act just like us
or have the same needs as us.

1758
01:45:57,530 --> 01:45:58,880
I always felt that way about,

1759
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:02,690
or even have the same
number of senses as us.

1760
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:05,930
They could have fewer,
they could have more. Hmm.

1761
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:09,680
Think about how much of
our lives are influenced,

1762
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:15,010
how much of our society is
built on services that bring
pleasure to our senses,

1763
01:46:18,140 --> 01:46:22,340
our sense of touch. We can go,
you go get a massage. Damn right.

1764
01:46:22,341 --> 01:46:27,050
You can know the right place.
Our, our sense of taste.

1765
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:32,240
There is food brought to x high
cuisine, right? Our sense of hearing.

1766
01:46:32,241 --> 01:46:36,500
Sure. We make beautiful music, our
sense of sight. We make great art.

1767
01:46:36,860 --> 01:46:41,120
So much of what we do is to satisfy
our five traditional senses.

1768
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:44,840
Imagine if we had 10 senses
or 20 I have a theory on that.

1769
01:46:44,841 --> 01:46:46,460
It's called the fart principle.

1770
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:50,100
I have no understanding of how that
principal could relate to this, but

1771
01:46:50,100 --> 01:46:51,910
I'm all yours. So this is why, um,

1772
01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:55,500
if you did not have a nose and you could
live your whole life without a sense of

1773
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:58,740
smell in the year 2012,
it's very possible if you,

1774
01:46:58,890 --> 01:47:02,910
if someone farted in front of you, you'd
have no idea that this terrible gas is,

1775
01:47:02,940 --> 01:47:06,430
you're inhaling, it's in your, no, you
wouldn't have that sense of smell. Okay.

1776
01:47:06,540 --> 01:47:10,950
So you could exist and not have any
idea because gas is invisible. Okay.

1777
01:47:11,160 --> 01:47:14,730
That's a bad example. And I'll tell you
why. It's okay. No, no. I'll tell you why.

1778
01:47:14,890 --> 01:47:19,800
Could be alien life form all around us
all the time that we don't have the sense

1779
01:47:19,940 --> 01:47:21,960
to like,
it's like worms can't see.

1780
01:47:24,430 --> 01:47:27,190
So two things. So first, uh, it's a,

1781
01:47:27,191 --> 01:47:30,970
it's a good example in the sense that
no pun intended in the sense of that

1782
01:47:31,510 --> 01:47:32,343
without,

1783
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:37,000
if who knows what senses were missing
and therefore who knows what there is to

1784
01:47:37,001 --> 01:47:40,510
measure in our world around us that we
are completely missing. Right. All right.

1785
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,680
I'll get back to that in a minute.
Regarding your FARC theory. Yes.

1786
01:47:44,710 --> 01:47:48,100
Here's the problem. All right. The my
theories of for peer review, right?

1787
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:51,160
That it is totally getting
peer reviewed. The good. Nice.

1788
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:54,820
It's the right thing to call it too.
It's a legitimate hypothesis. Thank you.

1789
01:47:54,910 --> 01:47:58,250
It's out on the table now. Here you
go. You Ready? It's my last, uh,

1790
01:47:58,390 --> 01:48:02,470
one of the active ingredients in the
smell of a fart is hydrogen sulfide.

1791
01:48:03,850 --> 01:48:08,850
It turns out hydrogen
sulfide is extremely lethal,

1792
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,930
is one of the most lethal
gasses that exists.

1793
01:48:16,540 --> 01:48:21,370
Well, why do we have such a
good sense of smell for that?

1794
01:48:22,840 --> 01:48:27,010
Why don't we smell other get, why don't
we smell nitrogen? [inaudible] well,

1795
01:48:27,670 --> 01:48:31,750
we don't need to smell nitrogen because
it's not going to kill us because it's

1796
01:48:31,751 --> 01:48:34,390
78% of what you breathe.
Anyway.

1797
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:39,220
[inaudible] we have
evolved a hypersensitive

1798
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:45,370
sense for the smell of hydrogen sulfide.
If,

1799
01:48:45,580 --> 01:48:49,690
if, if there was a gender, if you
gave birth to someone who said,

1800
01:48:49,691 --> 01:48:54,670
hydrogen sulfide smells beautiful
and let's smell more of it,

1801
01:48:54,700 --> 01:48:57,970
let's get canisters of it.
If you're dead 10 minutes later,

1802
01:48:58,180 --> 01:49:03,180
no longer able to propagate the gene
that liked the smell of hydrogen sulfide.

1803
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:06,640
We had to not like that smell.

1804
01:49:06,760 --> 01:49:10,420
Otherwise we would not have
survived the, uh, by the way,

1805
01:49:10,421 --> 01:49:15,250
hydrogen sulfide is a byproduct of the,

1806
01:49:15,460 --> 01:49:20,460
the digestive activity
of anaerobic microbes.

1807
01:49:21,490 --> 01:49:25,090
That's why it comes out of your lower
intestine with not only where the sun

1808
01:49:25,091 --> 01:49:29,020
don't shine, where oxygen doesn't exist,
the microbes to thrive down there,

1809
01:49:29,080 --> 01:49:33,400
they are an aerobic and hydrogen
sulfide is one of their byproducts.

1810
01:49:35,500 --> 01:49:40,500
It has been theorized that there have
been places and times on earth where the

1811
01:49:40,630 --> 01:49:42,550
ocean currents stopped.

1812
01:49:43,810 --> 01:49:48,810
And when ocean current stop oxygen at the
surface of the ocean never makes it to

1813
01:49:50,411 --> 01:49:51,244
the bottom.

1814
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:56,410
So you can't sustain oxygen
lifeforms at the bottom of the ocean.

1815
01:49:57,790 --> 01:49:58,540
There are no fish.

1816
01:49:58,540 --> 01:50:02,740
There wouldn't be any fishes down there
if the ocean currents stopped because

1817
01:50:02,741 --> 01:50:05,740
the ocean currents not only go from
one place to another in the world they

1818
01:50:05,741 --> 01:50:09,160
circle, they circulate
top to bottom. All right?

1819
01:50:09,161 --> 01:50:12,910
So it's a two dimensional thing going
on at three dimensions actually. So,

1820
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,440
so if something happens on earth
where you stopped the oceanic cycles,

1821
01:50:17,920 --> 01:50:21,700
you can create a condition
in the lower ocean.

1822
01:50:22,120 --> 01:50:25,330
We're anaerobic lifeforms thrive.
If they thrive,

1823
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:29,200
they out gas and one of the
out gases is hydrogen sulfide.

1824
01:50:29,320 --> 01:50:33,550
It will gurgle up from the bottom of
the ocean, rise up near the shores,

1825
01:50:33,700 --> 01:50:37,480
turning shorelines into
the smell of cesspools.

1826
01:50:37,750 --> 01:50:41,320
If you were alive at the time
and didn't run away from that,

1827
01:50:42,070 --> 01:50:43,840
you would have simply died from it.

1828
01:50:44,650 --> 01:50:47,690
That is all well and
good. Therefore, the nose,

1829
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:50,440
the nose theory that if
we didn't have a nose,

1830
01:50:50,441 --> 01:50:52,810
we could all just fart
and we didn't have a nose.

1831
01:50:52,930 --> 01:50:56,350
We wouldn't have noticed hydrogen sulfide
and humans would not have survived it

1832
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:59,860
and some other creature would be
having this interview right now.

1833
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:04,190
I agree with you and disagree with
you. At the same time, it's a,

1834
01:51:04,210 --> 01:51:09,210
here's why what you're saying involves
real people and real life adaptation to

1835
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:11,194
our environment.

1836
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:16,030
What I'm talking about is
aliens that are just like farts.

1837
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:20,950
That's why so you gave
me a crazy long winded,

1838
01:51:21,130 --> 01:51:24,130
really an in depth explanation,

1839
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:28,660
but you still don't discredit
the possibility that just
like the sense of smell.

1840
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:31,390
It exists,
but it is invisible.

1841
01:51:31,391 --> 01:51:34,210
There could be many things around
us that are also invisible,

1842
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:38,190
but we have not developed any
means to detect that. Okay.

1843
01:51:38,260 --> 01:51:42,510
You were being metaphor. She works
right? Wifi. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait.

1844
01:51:42,520 --> 01:51:47,170
So you're being metaphorical
with your father sang live.

1845
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:50,400
No one would have had to
have a known artist says,

1846
01:51:51,100 --> 01:51:53,070
I overanalyze you are a theory.

1847
01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,170
That was cool. It was cool. By the way,

1848
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:02,950
one global warming scenario
is the currents. Yes.

1849
01:52:02,980 --> 01:52:06,460
Did you see the day after tomorrow? Did
you see that? Unbelievably horrible. Yeah.

1850
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:09,880
That one was, was that went
to no clothes. So good.

1851
01:52:09,910 --> 01:52:13,360
It was bad when there was the cancer
baby and everybody else is dead outside,

1852
01:52:13,361 --> 01:52:16,090
but there she's surviving with the cancer
baby and she's going to stay there for

1853
01:52:16,091 --> 01:52:20,290
the kid. We, while 100 billion people
are dead. It's an awesome, awesome.

1854
01:52:20,291 --> 01:52:25,120
Let me get back to your nose. Your
partner is crazy. Okay, so now here's why.

1855
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:26,740
You're probably not right.

1856
01:52:27,680 --> 01:52:31,280
Well, I'm definitely not right.
Look, it's a ridiculous idea.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

1857
01:52:31,281 --> 01:52:32,600
no.
But there's a reason

1858
01:52:32,670 --> 01:52:37,380
why you're probably not. Right. Okay.
Because beginning in the 16 hundreds,

1859
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:42,630
we learned that our senses are not only,

1860
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:49,640
they not fool us,
they and occasionally don't work.

1861
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:55,600
They're not all that the
universe tells us they are not.

1862
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:03,580
They don't have the capacity to recognize
all that's going on in the universe

1863
01:53:04,580 --> 01:53:07,520
will certainly on a microscopic level.
Well, that's my point. That's my point.

1864
01:53:07,521 --> 01:53:11,780
So in the early 16 hundreds
to the important advances, uh,

1865
01:53:11,990 --> 01:53:13,160
actually late 1500,

1866
01:53:13,540 --> 01:53:17,000
you had the invention of the microscope
and you had the invention of the

1867
01:53:17,001 --> 01:53:17,834
telescope.

1868
01:53:18,620 --> 01:53:23,620
This is really the first steps to
enhance our senses beyond what our human

1869
01:53:27,081 --> 01:53:30,830
biology in doubt us with.
And upon doing so,

1870
01:53:31,280 --> 01:53:36,280
we discovered things about the world
that were previously oblivious to us.

1871
01:53:36,470 --> 01:53:40,210
We discovered knows farts.
When Lou, you wouldn't leave.

1872
01:53:40,260 --> 01:53:45,260
Windhoek brought his telescope of his
microscope to UB drop of pond water and

1873
01:53:47,181 --> 01:53:50,210
saw what we were called Anna macules.

1874
01:53:50,210 --> 01:53:52,160
What else were you going
to call the little things?

1875
01:53:52,820 --> 01:53:57,740
Paramecium had protozoa
thriving in a drop of water.

1876
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:02,810
That was a nose fart.
Good con keeping with your vocabulary.

1877
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:06,920
That was something that previously
no one had any idea was there.

1878
01:54:07,280 --> 01:54:12,280
And my point is beginning in 1600 and
with an ever improving march forward,

1879
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:18,440
the methods and tools of science
have served to enhance our senses,

1880
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:22,550
increase our senses,
increased the range of our senses,

1881
01:54:22,820 --> 01:54:24,020
but more importantly,

1882
01:54:24,170 --> 01:54:29,170
give us whole kinds of senses that
your five senses could have never even

1883
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:34,280
imagined that our human biology
couldn't even approximate.

1884
01:54:35,030 --> 01:54:39,140
So as so, so what's an example? Um,

1885
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:40,520
yeah.
Uh,

1886
01:54:40,580 --> 01:54:44,870
we don't have senses to
detect magnetic field at all.

1887
01:54:45,620 --> 01:54:49,640
That's why you can sit in a Mri
Chamber and sit there and you know,

1888
01:54:49,641 --> 01:54:53,870
whistle Dixie and you'll have no idea
the strength of the magnetic field that's

1889
01:54:53,871 --> 01:54:56,540
being cast across your body.
We don't have sensors for it.

1890
01:54:56,750 --> 01:55:01,450
You don't have sensors for radio?
Uh, we're radio waves. What the,

1891
01:55:02,660 --> 01:55:07,660
the difference there is we do have sensors
for one aspect of the electromagnetic

1892
01:55:07,941 --> 01:55:08,630
spectrum.

1893
01:55:08,630 --> 01:55:13,630
We have sensors for infrared visible
and a delayed sense for ultraviolet.

1894
01:55:15,640 --> 01:55:18,700
Does that mean, oh wow. Sorry. That's
pretty loud. And creative ringtone.

1895
01:55:18,830 --> 01:55:23,120
Just like mine aren't
dangerous. He goes, oh yeah.

1896
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:26,320
Uh, so, uh,

1897
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:30,710
so the point is the radio waves are part
of the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

1898
01:55:30,711 --> 01:55:34,610
We, we have access to some of that
and we call that for obvious reasons,

1899
01:55:34,670 --> 01:55:37,790
visible light.
But outside of the range of visible light,

1900
01:55:37,910 --> 01:55:42,770
you have ultraviolet x rays, gamma
rays, radio waves, microwaves. So yes,

1901
01:55:42,771 --> 01:55:44,040
we see radio waves,

1902
01:55:44,220 --> 01:55:48,990
but that would just be an extension of
our senses in the way Jordy and star

1903
01:55:48,991 --> 01:55:49,740
Trek,

1904
01:55:49,740 --> 01:55:54,030
the next generation had his visor
though that visor allowed him to see the

1905
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:58,490
entire go star track. I got it. I had
to go there just because I had, uh,

1906
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:03,600
and my sideburns or star Trek sideburns.
I don't know if he, uh, so he puts the,

1907
01:56:03,780 --> 01:56:07,800
well, he, that visor enabled him to see
the entire electromagnetic spectrum.

1908
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:09,450
If we were thusly equipped,

1909
01:56:09,690 --> 01:56:13,770
you'd walk down the street and the
microwave towers would be a blaze with

1910
01:56:13,771 --> 01:56:18,210
microwaves and you tune into
sort of ultraviolet. And if you,

1911
01:56:18,211 --> 01:56:21,750
you think twice about going to the beach
because that's the stuff that gives you

1912
01:56:21,751 --> 01:56:26,250
skin cancer, especially people
with lighter skin. If you, if, um,

1913
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:28,860
if you want to see, uh, what would it be?

1914
01:56:28,861 --> 01:56:31,140
A good example if you want to see if
there's a burglar entering your house,

1915
01:56:31,141 --> 01:56:34,710
just shift over to infrared.
If the burglar is warm blooded,

1916
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:39,030
they will show up even if all the lights
are out, like the Predator. Uh, exactly,

1917
01:56:39,090 --> 01:56:43,680
exactly. It's another way to
detect the light. So, so we have,

1918
01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:48,700
so science has broadened our senses and
given us senses that are human biology

1919
01:56:49,861 --> 01:56:52,620
could not have even
thought of or invented.

1920
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:58,070
So the notion at this day and age that
something is happening on this tabletop

1921
01:57:00,060 --> 01:57:02,160
that is eluding us,

1922
01:57:02,190 --> 01:57:07,080
I think is just simply unlikely because
we're so good now at finding things that

1923
01:57:07,081 --> 01:57:09,060
previously,
uh,

1924
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:12,450
escaped our notice right
in front of us right now.

1925
01:57:12,451 --> 01:57:16,920
That frontier is that the energy
extremes of the cern accelerator in

1926
01:57:16,921 --> 01:57:17,670
Switzerland.

1927
01:57:17,670 --> 01:57:22,410
That frontier is at the James Webb space
telescope where we're going to look at

1928
01:57:22,411 --> 01:57:25,950
the earliest formation of matter
in the history of the universe.

1929
01:57:26,130 --> 01:57:31,050
These are the extremes of our
measurements of nature today.

1930
01:57:31,410 --> 01:57:35,040
The biological limitations
of human beings, uh,

1931
01:57:35,280 --> 01:57:39,480
the birth and the death. You know, the
fact that we are all born and we all die.

1932
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:44,400
Do we apply those to the universe for
a reason or do we know that there was a

1933
01:57:44,401 --> 01:57:45,270
birth?
Is that,

1934
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:50,540
is that 100% sure that had
before the big bang there was no,

1935
01:57:51,490 --> 01:57:54,460
but there was something.
So do we know that? Yeah.

1936
01:57:54,461 --> 01:57:58,860
So we don't know. We don't know
what happened before the Big Bang.

1937
01:57:59,160 --> 01:58:03,150
So that's my first and
highest level answer to you.

1938
01:58:03,780 --> 01:58:06,690
That doesn't mean some people
don't have some creative ideas,

1939
01:58:06,990 --> 01:58:10,920
but the only real answer is we don't know.

1940
01:58:11,220 --> 01:58:13,860
And we have top people working on it.
All right,

1941
01:58:13,861 --> 01:58:16,860
so now some of the creative
ideas are quantum physics,

1942
01:58:16,861 --> 01:58:20,730
which is the most successful
theory of physics there ever was.

1943
01:58:20,731 --> 01:58:25,731
Quantum theory tells us that the early
universe may have been a fluctuation in

1944
01:58:28,591 --> 01:58:29,940
the laws of physics,

1945
01:58:30,930 --> 01:58:35,580
allowing other fluctuations at
the same time so that we are,

1946
01:58:35,640 --> 01:58:40,640
but one bubble of many comprising an
infinite set of bubbles deserving the

1947
01:58:43,270 --> 01:58:46,960
retrospectively obvious name multiverse.

1948
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:49,930
The multiverse theories
a scare the multiverse.

1949
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,750
And so if there's a multiverse then,

1950
01:58:53,350 --> 01:58:56,410
then we're just one bubble and this
multiverse is just churning them out.

1951
01:58:56,411 --> 01:59:01,150
Some of them by the way, who were on a one
way expansion trip. Other universities,

1952
01:59:01,151 --> 01:59:04,120
the laws of physics might be
slightly different with a condition.

1953
01:59:04,121 --> 01:59:07,930
The initial conditions might be slightly
altered from ours and it would expand

1954
01:59:07,931 --> 01:59:11,410
it and we collapse.
They'd have a big squeeze at the end.

1955
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:15,490
Some universities might might be
created without any matter at all.

1956
01:59:15,730 --> 01:59:18,280
So you have a universe with
no one to contemplate it.

1957
01:59:19,330 --> 01:59:24,330
We happen to have a universe with a
matter and energy within it assembled and

1958
01:59:24,941 --> 01:59:26,230
achieved consciousness.

1959
01:59:26,440 --> 01:59:30,040
So a universe where
there's no matter at all,

1960
01:59:30,160 --> 01:59:34,780
but it's infinite and self
comprised like it is the universe.

1961
01:59:34,781 --> 01:59:37,450
You can't get here from there.
And not that we know of,

1962
01:59:37,451 --> 01:59:42,340
but that could be a way we might be able
to invent the multiverse transport kit

1963
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:44,710
where you leave your universe
and enter another other.

1964
01:59:44,710 --> 01:59:48,010
But I don't recommend
that because if the laws,

1965
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:54,520
if the laws of physics are even slightly
different, the charge on the electron,

1966
01:59:54,790 --> 01:59:57,640
the,
the mass of the neutron,

1967
01:59:58,030 --> 02:00:02,680
if any of these are slightly different
than everything that holds you together,

1968
02:00:03,070 --> 02:00:07,120
all the physical laws that
come together to make you,

1969
02:00:07,870 --> 02:00:09,580
including all the forces of nature,

1970
02:00:09,850 --> 02:00:14,850
they would just completely collapse in
the existence if you stepped into the

1971
02:00:14,861 --> 02:00:18,490
zone of this other universe where they
take on some other form or shape that we

1972
02:00:18,491 --> 02:00:23,020
can't even imagine. So yeah, I
don't want to, I, I, you know,

1973
02:00:23,021 --> 02:00:26,260
that's when he flipped.
You send in a probe or something,

1974
02:00:26,261 --> 02:00:30,730
but you don't send yourself. So that's
why I joke about this half seriously,

1975
02:00:30,731 --> 02:00:32,170
that if an alien comes to visit,

1976
02:00:32,590 --> 02:00:36,070
I want to make sure in advance that
they're not made of anti-matter.

1977
02:00:36,460 --> 02:00:38,620
So I flipped a coin and that catch it.

1978
02:00:38,620 --> 02:00:42,790
If they don't explode together in
isolation, then I'll shake their hands.

1979
02:00:42,791 --> 02:00:46,010
So let him mad. I say welcome
to Earth. When they explode,

1980
02:00:46,020 --> 02:00:49,280
just touching the ground then. Ah,
yeah. Well they might have hover, hover,

1981
02:00:49,281 --> 02:00:51,820
glide or something, you
know, I don't lie. Well,

1982
02:00:51,821 --> 02:00:54,070
plus they're touching the
atmosphere, which is matter. So,

1983
02:00:54,071 --> 02:00:58,060
so if I meet him in space,
let's say [inaudible] and you shake hands,

1984
02:00:58,061 --> 02:01:01,450
everybody dies. You completely
an island. That's correct. Yeah.

1985
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:05,080
So that's what happens in
our own universe. Imagine,
uh, some other universe.

1986
02:01:05,081 --> 02:01:08,680
There's no telling. How are laws of
physics would interact with each other.

1987
02:01:08,800 --> 02:01:12,970
So you ask what's before the universe?
It may be the multiverse, but now,

1988
02:01:13,990 --> 02:01:16,870
now, now when you played
that thing, I get nervous.

1989
02:01:18,550 --> 02:01:20,480
So there's,
there's good,

1990
02:01:20,500 --> 02:01:24,610
there's cogent physics reasons to think
that there's a multiverse and quantum

1991
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:25,780
physics.
It takes us there.

1992
02:01:26,380 --> 02:01:29,650
There's also good philosophical reason
to think that there's a multiverse

1993
02:01:29,651 --> 02:01:33,550
because in our experience,
discovering the cosmos,

1994
02:01:34,990 --> 02:01:39,990
the universe never makes anything
in ones when we thought earth is it.

1995
02:01:40,760 --> 02:01:43,450
No earth is just one of many
other planet. Well, the sun is,

1996
02:01:43,470 --> 02:01:47,450
but no sun is one of 100 billion
stars in the galaxy. Well,

1997
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:48,560
the Milky Way,

1998
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:53,590
and I know there's 100 billion
other galaxies in the universe.

1999
02:01:54,950 --> 02:01:59,000
Well, the universe, well, we'd
been there before, right? Right.

2000
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:03,140
Am I going to say there's
one universe? I'm a little,
I'm all Stanley. Isn't there?

2001
02:02:03,141 --> 02:02:04,130
Just one university?

2002
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:07,820
We'll get verse consisting of billions
and billions of infant. I'm getting there.

2003
02:02:07,821 --> 02:02:11,240
So what's, so watch the vocabulary,
right? So we have this one universe,

2004
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:16,160
but I don't want to think there's one
universe because of the trend line says

2005
02:02:16,161 --> 02:02:19,700
differently. All right, so
maybe there's this multiverse.

2006
02:02:20,570 --> 02:02:23,960
Well that just continues to push
the question a little deeply.

2007
02:02:24,290 --> 02:02:27,290
If the universe never
makes, if the, if the,

2008
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:30,650
this entity never makes anything in ones,

2009
02:02:30,950 --> 02:02:35,330
then why would it only make one
multiverse takes us. So then,

2010
02:02:37,480 --> 02:02:38,270
so,

2011
02:02:38,270 --> 02:02:42,590
so maybe there are multiple multiverses.

2012
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:46,460
Okay, so that would, so,

2013
02:02:46,720 --> 02:02:50,510
and then it's turtles all
the way down as they say. So,

2014
02:02:50,750 --> 02:02:55,670
so we, like I said, we don't
have a handle on it yet,

2015
02:02:55,700 --> 02:02:56,241
but we have,

2016
02:02:56,241 --> 02:02:59,240
we've solved other origin problems because
what started this was your question

2017
02:02:59,241 --> 02:03:02,840
about birth and death. There's a time
and we didn't know how the earth began.

2018
02:03:02,841 --> 02:03:05,610
We have a good idea of that now and
how are the, how the moon foreign,

2019
02:03:05,611 --> 02:03:08,420
we've got that, how the sun
formed. We got that. No,

2020
02:03:08,421 --> 02:03:11,780
we weren't around 5 billion years ago
to watch it. But you don't need to be,

2021
02:03:11,930 --> 02:03:14,450
they're very clever ways to
know what happened in the past.

2022
02:03:14,600 --> 02:03:19,040
Geologist had been doing it, but you know,
ever since the field was born, you have,

2023
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:20,060
there's a,

2024
02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:25,060
there's a record writ for geologists
in the rocks telling you where they've

2025
02:03:26,171 --> 02:03:26,421
been,

2026
02:03:26,421 --> 02:03:29,690
what temperature they were exposed to
and how long they've been sitting there.

2027
02:03:30,200 --> 02:03:33,290
We look at the sun. No, we
can't go back in time with it,

2028
02:03:33,440 --> 02:03:37,010
but we can look at other stars.
We, we look out in the galaxy.

2029
02:03:37,011 --> 02:03:38,540
There's so many stars,

2030
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:42,140
but catching some being born
but catching others dying.

2031
02:03:42,320 --> 02:03:45,560
We're catching some in orbit around each
other and we're seeing some that don't

2032
02:03:45,561 --> 02:03:48,110
exist anymore because by the
time they're light reaches us,

2033
02:03:48,111 --> 02:03:51,600
they've already faded out. There'll be
some of them that in fact at this instant,

2034
02:03:51,770 --> 02:03:56,540
no longer exist and that information
has yet to reach us. That's insane.

2035
02:03:56,640 --> 02:04:00,200
And by the way,
that happens several hundred times a year.

2036
02:04:00,260 --> 02:04:04,340
We observe what are called supernovae
stars that ask you about stars that

2037
02:04:04,341 --> 02:04:08,240
explode. We watched them explode and we
date them from when we see them explode.

2038
02:04:08,720 --> 02:04:11,510
But hell, they'd exploded long
ago, depending on their distance,

2039
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:15,350
if there are thousand light years away,
they exploded a thousand years ago.

2040
02:04:15,400 --> 02:04:17,510
It was,
you had no knowledge of it until today.

2041
02:04:17,540 --> 02:04:22,100
There was a fantastic documentary on
hyper novas and it was so mind boggling

2042
02:04:22,101 --> 02:04:25,490
because they went back to the birth
of the discovery of hyper Novas.

2043
02:04:25,760 --> 02:04:30,440
And when they initially were theorizing
that it was warfare in space,

2044
02:04:30,890 --> 02:04:32,030
I'll tell you what that story was.

2045
02:04:32,031 --> 02:04:35,240
So in the 1970s after the
United States and Russia,

2046
02:04:35,241 --> 02:04:40,241
the Soviet Union signed a test ban
treaty where you couldn't test nuclear

2047
02:04:40,801 --> 02:04:44,910
weapons on her surface. Uh, we, you know,

2048
02:04:44,911 --> 02:04:49,680
there's the old military, uh, Credo
Trust, but verify. We said, all right,

2049
02:04:49,681 --> 02:04:52,560
we'll sign this treaty,
but we're gonna keep on eye on you.

2050
02:04:52,770 --> 02:04:56,850
So we got together the engineers
and the physicist and we may, my,

2051
02:04:56,940 --> 02:05:00,540
my brethren of the day,
uh, invented a telescope,

2052
02:05:00,690 --> 02:05:03,660
a kind of detector that was
sensitive to gamma rays.

2053
02:05:03,690 --> 02:05:06,300
That's one of these bands in
the electromagnetic spectrum,

2054
02:05:06,630 --> 02:05:11,520
the highest energy band for which we
have a word to describe it. Gamma rays,

2055
02:05:11,670 --> 02:05:15,090
by the way, that's what Dr Banner
was exposed to that made a, Oh,

2056
02:05:15,100 --> 02:05:17,340
don't you think I'm not
aware. Big, green and ugly.

2057
02:05:17,580 --> 02:05:21,130
So actually that's not actually what
would happen to you if you're exposed to

2058
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:25,890
Mac, but we'll give the comics of
the, the, the scientific latitude. So,

2059
02:05:26,010 --> 02:05:29,490
so you have this, um,
so, so, so what happens?

2060
02:05:29,580 --> 02:05:34,020
So they launched this detector
and you know, seven, eight, nine,

2061
02:05:34,021 --> 02:05:35,070
10 times a week,

2062
02:05:35,740 --> 02:05:40,740
this satellite with this detector on
board detects burst of gamma rays and the

2063
02:05:41,881 --> 02:05:45,000
Pentagon scrambled and they said,
you know, what's, what's going on?

2064
02:05:45,001 --> 02:05:48,660
Are they actually detonating these
weapons? And they looked at satellite,

2065
02:05:48,690 --> 02:05:51,690
other satellite, secondary,
tertiary information.

2066
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:57,090
So he union was silent. There was no
evidence of any nuclear testing at all.

2067
02:05:57,330 --> 02:06:02,330
And that was the birth that day to the
day of the publication of that paper that

2068
02:06:03,061 --> 02:06:04,860
reported on these daily bursts.

2069
02:06:05,070 --> 02:06:10,070
That was the birth of the field of
astrophysics called gamma ray astronomy.

2070
02:06:11,040 --> 02:06:14,640
And we now have other gamma ray
telescopes out there studying these.

2071
02:06:14,740 --> 02:06:17,730
They are explosions and they're
happening at the edge of the universe.

2072
02:06:17,820 --> 02:06:21,390
And these are the sorts, the, their
sources are of what you're hyper Novae.

2073
02:06:21,720 --> 02:06:23,910
We needed a word bigger
than supernovae and we,

2074
02:06:23,911 --> 02:06:26,130
these are the biggest explosions
known in the universe.

2075
02:06:26,370 --> 02:06:31,370
And so we call them hyper Novi and the
amount of power produced by a hyper Nova.

2076
02:06:31,770 --> 02:06:35,670
Oh yeah. It's extraordinary. What,
uh, what matters more than that,

2077
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:40,020
it's a lot of power is that it's very
focused. It comes out in two beams,

2078
02:06:40,350 --> 02:06:43,260
one in one direction and one in the other.
And if we happen to be in the beam,

2079
02:06:43,400 --> 02:06:45,800
that's, that's all she wrote. Yeah.

2080
02:06:45,810 --> 02:06:48,480
If there were a hyper Novi
anywhere in our galaxy,

2081
02:06:49,020 --> 02:06:52,590
everybody's done in the entire galaxy
and it was being towards earth.

2082
02:06:52,770 --> 02:06:57,240
We're toast, literal and figurative.
Literally around that kids,

2083
02:06:57,270 --> 02:07:01,950
there's $100 billion stars at least.
Right. And this galaxy. But most,

2084
02:07:01,951 --> 02:07:04,650
I mean a hyper, no, it was a very
special and rare kind of star.

2085
02:07:04,800 --> 02:07:09,540
And we times a day, we now well know
in the universe. Yeah. No, eight times.

2086
02:07:09,541 --> 02:07:12,810
Eight times a week. Eight times a week.
Yeah. Yeah. Between 75 times a week.

2087
02:07:12,811 --> 02:07:17,220
Once a day in the entire universe.
Wow. So, so, so that, that's,

2088
02:07:17,260 --> 02:07:18,750
but that tells you how rare it is.

2089
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:23,700
It takes 150 to 100 billion galaxies,

2090
02:07:24,180 --> 02:07:28,910
each with 100 billion
stars to give you hate.

2091
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:32,520
Are these a week? Yeah. So by the way,

2092
02:07:32,521 --> 02:07:35,530
there's an interesting way
that this will render us toast.

2093
02:07:35,620 --> 02:07:39,040
So the first rave of gamma rays,
we'll take out our ozone layer.

2094
02:07:39,190 --> 02:07:43,360
The ozone absorbs high, high
energy radiation. That's
what PR protects us from.

2095
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:48,010
Uh, it's what absorbed most of the
ultraviolet from the sun. Otherwise,

2096
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:51,610
ultra is hostile to life,
to life on the surface.

2097
02:07:51,611 --> 02:07:56,260
And we wouldn't be life as we know it
if without this ozone layer on earth.

2098
02:07:56,590 --> 02:08:00,280
All right? So, so if, but you
can overrun the ozone layer.

2099
02:08:00,640 --> 02:08:05,380
The ozone is oxygen. It's o three, right?
The air you breathe has o two in it.

2100
02:08:05,410 --> 02:08:10,410
The molecule [inaudible] ozone is both
three and ultra violet photon comes in,

2101
02:08:10,810 --> 02:08:14,470
slams into o three breaks
it apart into o plus o two.

2102
02:08:15,310 --> 02:08:19,240
There you go. It ups, it took the,
the ultraviolet light out of the,

2103
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:23,740
out of the picture, it's gone.
That's why protects us. Okay,

2104
02:08:24,070 --> 02:08:26,650
so if there's a gamma ray burst,

2105
02:08:27,130 --> 02:08:30,550
more high energy,
photons will hit us.

2106
02:08:30,580 --> 02:08:35,290
Then there are oh three
molecules in our ozone layer.

2107
02:08:36,700 --> 02:08:41,700
So they all hit and they break apart the
o threes and it's like the first wave

2108
02:08:43,910 --> 02:08:48,790
of, of, of a cat. What are the cavalry
who the first ones on the, in the battle?

2109
02:08:48,990 --> 02:08:52,960
Um, the first they get all shot up, right?
I mean in the old fashioned they run in,

2110
02:08:53,260 --> 02:08:56,740
they get shot up. Okay.
The first way it comes in,

2111
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:00,850
we'd protects us from some of it,
but in overruns, the ozone layer,

2112
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:04,750
the rest come in and basically
starts breaking apart the molecular,

2113
02:09:05,020 --> 02:09:07,450
the complex molecules that
exist on earth surface.

2114
02:09:07,451 --> 02:09:09,340
That's how high energy the light is.

2115
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:14,610
And generally we think of life as complex
chemistry and the most complex form of

2116
02:09:14,891 --> 02:09:18,370
chemistry we know,
and so we would not survive that.

2117
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:23,330
That would be an extinction episode
for all life on Earth and now what?

2118
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:26,470
Now if you, you could burrow
underground, that'd be cool. Go there.

2119
02:09:26,950 --> 02:09:30,700
I wouldn't want to,
I'd rather just stop.

2120
02:09:32,240 --> 02:09:35,560
It's just too much to ask to
survive something like grab a beer,

2121
02:09:35,590 --> 02:09:39,310
get out your lawn chair and watch it
come like anything you want to survive.

2122
02:09:39,820 --> 02:09:43,390
It seems like you have to sort of give
in to the reality that the greater good

2123
02:09:43,391 --> 02:09:44,650
of the universe will be fine.

2124
02:09:44,680 --> 02:09:48,190
It's time for the rats and roaches
to rise up in ourF or whatever.

2125
02:09:48,240 --> 02:09:52,690
Then it's like our own consciousness is
so strung up on the idea of staying in

2126
02:09:52,691 --> 02:09:57,520
this form, you know, physically
alive and keep this thing, whatever.

2127
02:09:57,521 --> 02:10:00,220
This is going right.
Because of our survival instincts,

2128
02:10:00,221 --> 02:10:05,080
it really sort of confuses and it dilutes
the whole idea of perception that the

2129
02:10:05,081 --> 02:10:10,060
universe itself is not just infinite,
but infinitely fractal. Yeah.

2130
02:10:10,061 --> 02:10:10,840
Well No.

2131
02:10:10,840 --> 02:10:15,340
The average life expectancy of a mammal
species is about 3 million years,

2132
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:19,090
and I'm sure there's some of us out there
who are thinking that we'll live for

2133
02:10:19,091 --> 02:10:22,150
billions of years and and
planet hop and star hop,

2134
02:10:22,630 --> 02:10:25,090
and then there are people are saying,
well,

2135
02:10:25,091 --> 02:10:29,530
we better learn how to terraform Mars
because earth is about to be completely

2136
02:10:29,531 --> 02:10:34,040
messed up. And those folks I
think are misguided in their, in

2137
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:36,030
their thinking. Can I tell
you why? Sure. Please.

2138
02:10:36,070 --> 02:10:40,110
It's not who doesn't want to
terraform Mars. Okay, that's
they did. They did it on.

2139
02:10:41,900 --> 02:10:46,640
I got kids, another planet to visit.
That'd be fun. Vacation, vacation spot.

2140
02:10:46,641 --> 02:10:50,570
I have no issues, but don't do that. Be
Close. You want another place to live,

2141
02:10:50,690 --> 02:10:54,260
to escape the fact that we're
destroying our own earth. All right?

2142
02:10:54,290 --> 02:10:56,510
Did the environment and the
oceans and the atmosphere.

2143
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:58,520
Here's why is every very simple argument.

2144
02:10:59,690 --> 02:11:04,690
If we have the power to convert Mars
into something that looks like earth,

2145
02:11:06,080 --> 02:11:10,220
then we have the power to fix our oceans,
our oceans, and our own atmosphere,

2146
02:11:10,960 --> 02:11:14,330
right? If you see if you have
the power of geoengineering,

2147
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:16,100
you don't have to leave the planet,

2148
02:11:16,101 --> 02:11:20,840
your arm turn another one into earth
and move there. The fixer earth. Yes,

2149
02:11:21,210 --> 02:11:24,650
thank you. It seems like just a
step in the stage of innovation.

2150
02:11:24,650 --> 02:11:26,690
As long as human beings
have access to energy,

2151
02:11:26,691 --> 02:11:29,930
we're going to figure out how to get
energy from pollution and get energy from

2152
02:11:30,140 --> 02:11:35,140
this going to be with the massive amounts
of progress that have been made just

2153
02:11:35,270 --> 02:11:36,530
in the last 200 years.

2154
02:11:36,740 --> 02:11:39,260
I always like to describe to people if
they really have a hard time wrapping

2155
02:11:39,261 --> 02:11:42,260
their head around it that 200 years ago
if you wanted a picture of something you

2156
02:11:42,261 --> 02:11:46,580
had to draw it. I'll just stop and
look at that. Great, great observation.

2157
02:11:46,581 --> 02:11:51,320
It's such a small amount of time that a
massive amount of stuff has happened and

2158
02:11:51,321 --> 02:11:54,650
if you stop and think about what
we're capable of like [inaudible] man,

2159
02:11:54,651 --> 02:11:57,800
who knows? I mean, I don't know
the answer to overpopulation.

2160
02:11:57,801 --> 02:11:58,551
I don't know the answer,

2161
02:11:58,551 --> 02:12:01,970
but I do know that I would've never
figured out why Phi on my own.

2162
02:12:02,720 --> 02:12:05,480
I would've never figured out
how to send a satellite signal.

2163
02:12:05,570 --> 02:12:09,650
Who the fuck even understands what's
going on. When you get online,

2164
02:12:09,680 --> 02:12:14,060
it's just think about what's
going on in your car's gps. Right?

2165
02:12:14,061 --> 02:12:19,061
So it's talking to a satellite and mixing
your location on earth surface with

2166
02:12:20,030 --> 02:12:23,360
information that's in the later
versions of it on your car,

2167
02:12:23,390 --> 02:12:28,390
updated from the Internet
about what direction the
traffic flows on a street you

2168
02:12:29,691 --> 02:12:34,550
happened to be driving on and whether
the Dunkin donuts is open late. Yeah.

2169
02:12:34,551 --> 02:12:37,580
As long as there's money
in fixing the environment,

2170
02:12:37,581 --> 02:12:39,500
we're going to fix the environment.
Well that's the challenge.

2171
02:12:39,501 --> 02:12:44,330
The trick is to make it so that people
can actually find some benefit in a

2172
02:12:44,331 --> 02:12:48,410
capitalist economy. That's,
that's the driver of it all. Yeah.

2173
02:12:48,411 --> 02:12:50,790
It pushes things and it also,
you know,

2174
02:12:50,791 --> 02:12:54,800
it leaves a lot of bullshit in its wake
and a lot of pollution and problems that,

2175
02:12:55,480 --> 02:12:59,540
I mean, I hope we figure it out before
we eat up the rain forest. I really do.

2176
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:02,750
But if we don't, we could probably
make a new rain forest one day.

2177
02:13:02,751 --> 02:13:05,220
We could probably figure
it out. Yeah. Yeah. I mean,

2178
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:09,470
it's a fucked up way to look at things
like, well figure it out, don't worry.

2179
02:13:09,680 --> 02:13:13,520
But I think the doom and gloom
analysis of we're doomed.

2180
02:13:13,521 --> 02:13:15,890
There's no way we're going to,
uh, we're gonna run out of food.

2181
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,200
I think that's kind of a
silly way to look at it too.

2182
02:13:18,201 --> 02:13:22,010
I think it seems to me that if you
fly over just the United States alone,

2183
02:13:22,011 --> 02:13:24,320
God is a lot of space to do
shit. Yeah, that's correct.

2184
02:13:24,410 --> 02:13:27,200
And if you wanted to do some
shit on the moon or on Mars,

2185
02:13:27,380 --> 02:13:31,140
he could kind of do it in Nevada as well.
You know, you could find some spots,

2186
02:13:31,230 --> 02:13:32,520
Utah and nobody's

2187
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:35,580
there and you could put up a
dome and grow some vegetables.

2188
02:13:35,630 --> 02:13:37,050
What happened is earth keeps warming.

2189
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:41,700
So the news that last year was by far
the longest that the warmest year ever by

2190
02:13:41,701 --> 02:13:46,550
far a 2012 the warmest year on earth.
So if that want warm as here for,

2191
02:13:46,570 --> 02:13:50,130
since when, uh, I, well,

2192
02:13:50,131 --> 02:13:53,430
I didn't read the full depth
of the article, but certainly
the warmest on record,

2193
02:13:53,590 --> 02:13:56,980
right? Is that we've been keeping records
now warm. The earth has been, but, uh,

2194
02:13:58,020 --> 02:14:01,500
not since like Jurassic, right, right. No,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2195
02:14:01,670 --> 02:14:05,430
In any time that, that it would
have been concerned about this.

2196
02:14:05,730 --> 02:14:10,590
And so if that's unstoppable
for whatever reasons,

2197
02:14:10,591 --> 02:14:13,020
political, cultural, economic, whatever,

2198
02:14:13,140 --> 02:14:18,140
what that will do is simply redraw the
map of what does Arabelle and what is not

2199
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:22,950
in the world. So we'll live in
Antarctica, it'll read, distribute,

2200
02:14:23,310 --> 02:14:28,110
uh, where, where we think of as
the heartland and the, the wheat,

2201
02:14:28,170 --> 02:14:30,030
you know, well, we know about the,

2202
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:34,080
we know now about Greenland and underneath
all that ice there. Yeah. Stuff that,

2203
02:14:34,850 --> 02:14:38,130
the climate that once was, I
mean, there's a day when, uh,

2204
02:14:38,190 --> 02:14:42,330
earth had no ice poles and no, no ice
caps at all. Well, there was a day,

2205
02:14:42,331 --> 02:14:46,470
just 15, 16,000 years ago that half
of North America was covered in ice.

2206
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,300
I liked the way he said,
just 15,000.

2207
02:14:48,310 --> 02:14:52,980
I'm Craig Lawson in the version of the
universe that was silly lives. And,

2208
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:57,210
uh, there's good evidence to say
that Earth had the early earth had,

2209
02:14:57,240 --> 02:15:02,070
was complete snowball where the ice caps
were so large that the north ice cap

2210
02:15:02,071 --> 02:15:06,050
met this south ice camp at the equator
and it's called snowball earth.

2211
02:15:06,090 --> 02:15:09,350
When was this? Very cool. I forgot the
exact time that they've been. It's,

2212
02:15:09,351 --> 02:15:12,830
it's geologist plus, you know, some, uh,

2213
02:15:13,060 --> 02:15:16,470
w if you look at the history of the
sun or the sun wasn't always the same

2214
02:15:16,471 --> 02:15:16,951
temperature.

2215
02:15:16,951 --> 02:15:20,610
So you have to fold that into what's
going on on earth at the time and what the

2216
02:15:20,611 --> 02:15:22,920
Greek, the state of the
greenhouse effect is on earth.

2217
02:15:23,040 --> 02:15:27,210
Because that also influences the,
the, the tracking, the, the, uh, how,

2218
02:15:27,240 --> 02:15:32,240
how high the temperature is versus
what earth is doing with the energy it

2219
02:15:32,281 --> 02:15:35,880
received. When you're a
snowball, most of earth,

2220
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:39,450
the Sun's light is reflected
rather than absorbed. See that.

2221
02:15:39,451 --> 02:15:42,210
And so that's how you can get
a runaway snowball, right?

2222
02:15:42,211 --> 02:15:45,540
So the ice caps grow a little
bit and they said, we are,

2223
02:15:45,541 --> 02:15:49,760
this is like global climate change. And
the other direction, the way worse, right?

2224
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:54,800
It grows a little bit and
then less sunlight gets
absorbed by the earth because

2225
02:15:55,710 --> 02:15:59,730
ice is white. And so it
freezes up a little more. Oh.

2226
02:15:59,790 --> 02:16:04,770
And then even less sunlight gets kept
and then it freezes up a little more.

2227
02:16:04,771 --> 02:16:09,060
So you can have a runaway ice ball just
as you can have a runaway greenhouse.

2228
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:11,770
That's incredible. That's,
that's interesting that,

2229
02:16:11,771 --> 02:16:14,370
that these two possibilities exist.

2230
02:16:14,370 --> 02:16:18,750
And the glacier is when they melt and
they create water and the water acts as a

2231
02:16:18,751 --> 02:16:22,010
reflector and the light goes to the
water and melting glaciers quicker.

2232
02:16:22,011 --> 02:16:23,100
And so for example,
if their,

2233
02:16:23,490 --> 02:16:27,780
if their greenhouse gas is dissolved in
the rocks are in the oceans and they're

2234
02:16:27,781 --> 02:16:29,530
happy and nobody's disturbing them,

2235
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:33,970
then you maintain your atmospheric
temperature and the energy balance of

2236
02:16:33,971 --> 02:16:37,690
sunlight hitting the earth. Some
getting absorbed, others getting other,

2237
02:16:37,870 --> 02:16:42,370
other parts getting reflected.
But if you tip that balance,

2238
02:16:42,670 --> 02:16:46,360
by the way, that can shift, that's not
a like a razor edge balance. I mean,

2239
02:16:46,361 --> 02:16:50,230
there's no slop in there.
Uh, restorative forces exist.

2240
02:16:50,470 --> 02:16:54,220
But if you go outside of what a
restorative force can give you,

2241
02:16:54,640 --> 02:16:59,640
then you overrun the capacity to bring
you back to any place where you once were

2242
02:16:59,980 --> 02:17:01,570
and then you get a runaway phenomenon.

2243
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:06,160
And so you heat and when you heat
something, it out gases, right?

2244
02:17:06,160 --> 02:17:10,120
If you heat your soda, the Co two
comes out of it. It doesn't stay in.

2245
02:17:10,420 --> 02:17:13,660
That's why we'd like drinking
cold carbonated beverages.

2246
02:17:13,810 --> 02:17:17,800
So if you heat earth then
and greenhouse gases are,

2247
02:17:18,070 --> 02:17:20,170
are dissolved within it,

2248
02:17:20,440 --> 02:17:24,100
then you start releasing those greenhouse
gases that makes earth retain even

2249
02:17:24,101 --> 02:17:24,341
more.

2250
02:17:24,341 --> 02:17:28,690
Heat makes it hotter and it makes it
hotter even more greenhouse gas has come

2251
02:17:28,691 --> 02:17:32,740
out. And so you can imagine a situation
where you have a runaway greenhouse where

2252
02:17:32,741 --> 02:17:37,660
everything goes really hot. Is that
where we're at? No, it's everybody do.

2253
02:17:38,870 --> 02:17:39,221
We're not.

2254
02:17:39,221 --> 02:17:44,221
Runaway Earth has been this hot before
and has recovered from it over time as

2255
02:17:45,070 --> 02:17:48,940
much longer than anybody's life lifetime.
That's another problem here. Right?

2256
02:17:49,090 --> 02:17:50,290
Earth has been much harder than this.

2257
02:17:50,530 --> 02:17:54,150
It just was much hotter before
humans are much more stream. Yeah.

2258
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:58,000
Before human history. Yeah. And so,
and we have great evidence for this.

2259
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:00,010
So the issue is not will earth survive.

2260
02:18:00,011 --> 02:18:05,011
It is whether we as we have set up culture
and civilization and economies and,

2261
02:18:05,320 --> 02:18:10,320
and it's all been set up assuming a
certain constancy of the conduct of nature

2262
02:18:12,040 --> 02:18:16,330
and if we now become a force
in that in nature's equation,

2263
02:18:16,840 --> 02:18:21,250
creating a cycling of phenomenon that
would normally have taken 10,000 or

2264
02:18:21,251 --> 02:18:24,640
100,000 years and we're doing
it on a scale of centuries,

2265
02:18:25,150 --> 02:18:29,140
then we better be prepared
to face those consequences.

2266
02:18:29,320 --> 02:18:32,740
Much like your analogy of the
clouds in a timelapse fashion,

2267
02:18:32,980 --> 02:18:37,000
the idea of living by the beach
would be so fucking ridiculous.

2268
02:18:37,001 --> 02:18:41,610
If you ever saw the, the actual
like Pangea change into continental.

2269
02:18:41,611 --> 02:18:44,530
Send me the last bit. Yeah. Cause that's
like why would you live near the water?

2270
02:18:44,531 --> 02:18:48,290
What are you crazy? But that's 80% of our
population. Right? Exactly. Yeah, yeah,

2271
02:18:48,320 --> 02:18:50,950
yeah. On because cities are
based typically near water,

2272
02:18:50,951 --> 02:18:54,030
soft water sources on river mouths or,

2273
02:18:54,060 --> 02:18:58,660
or were transportation was useful in the
days before we live in New York City,

2274
02:18:58,840 --> 02:18:59,890
in Manhattan,
lower Manhattan.

2275
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,630
Are you concerned about like sandy and
the impact that it had that this might

2276
02:19:03,631 --> 02:19:07,960
flood zone a and zone Aa was four
blocks from me, from my zone,

2277
02:19:07,961 --> 02:19:11,480
which was zoned. See, I walked four
blocks, five blocks away and oh,

2278
02:19:11,500 --> 02:19:14,860
should tire underground
parking garages were flooded.

2279
02:19:14,950 --> 02:19:19,810
Cars were bobbing out, up, out of the
exit doors of these parking garages.

2280
02:19:19,811 --> 02:19:24,120
Have you thought about Utah or maybe
perhaps not Colorado mountains to stay

2281
02:19:24,520 --> 02:19:28,250
because if you plan for the end of the
world, I'm going where you're going.

2282
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:29,660
I'm going to call you up.
Dude.

2283
02:19:29,960 --> 02:19:31,910
You better be straight with
me telling me where to. Hi,

2284
02:19:32,380 --> 02:19:35,350
tell you a cute story. A friend
of mine, Rick Binsel, who's, uh,

2285
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:38,220
who's at a planetary astronomer,
uh,

2286
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:43,320
he also created the risk scale for judging
the likelihood of an asteroid that's

2287
02:19:44,081 --> 02:19:45,820
recently,
recently been discovered.

2288
02:19:46,090 --> 02:19:49,600
He created the risk scale that will
tell you the likelihood of that hitting

2289
02:19:49,601 --> 02:19:53,590
earth. Okay. Now he and I like to
drink wine when we're together.

2290
02:19:53,860 --> 02:19:58,630
So he has, so if, if he's thinking
that an asteroid is gonna come one day,

2291
02:19:58,750 --> 02:20:00,730
what's the first thing you ask
him about his wine collection?

2292
02:20:01,450 --> 02:20:03,620
What's the first thing you ask him?
Uh, what are you going to drink?

2293
02:20:03,710 --> 02:20:07,180
Exactly what bottle of wine and you have
that you're going to pull out the day,

2294
02:20:07,181 --> 02:20:08,470
you know,
the asteroid's coming.

2295
02:20:08,710 --> 02:20:11,800
So he was thinking maybe
he could attach a little,

2296
02:20:12,010 --> 02:20:15,610
a little a sensor behind that bottle.
Okay.

2297
02:20:15,611 --> 02:20:18,120
And it goes into my place
and other friends of his, so

2298
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:23,190
pose that bottle out, I'm red
light starts flashing and you know,

2299
02:20:23,370 --> 02:20:25,110
cause he would be the first to know this.

2300
02:20:25,390 --> 02:20:29,550
It's his calculation if it gets sent to
the media that gets sent to the press.

2301
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,000
Oh, okay. Um, speaking of calculations,

2302
02:20:33,030 --> 02:20:37,430
I have to talk to you
about the conversation that
you had was his, the men,

2303
02:20:37,490 --> 02:20:40,680
the man's named Claude Shannon
was that the guy knows talky,

2304
02:20:40,770 --> 02:20:43,380
but what is the name Claude? Well,
I'm trying to remember what the, uh,

2305
02:20:43,381 --> 02:20:46,400
the scientist's name that
was discovering or that, uh,

2306
02:20:46,440 --> 02:20:51,390
was talking to you about
the discovery of computers.

2307
02:20:51,510 --> 02:20:53,820
A computer. Oh, Jim Gates. Gym. Yup.

2308
02:20:53,900 --> 02:20:56,660
Professor, uh, Jim, uh, Jim Gates. Oh,

2309
02:20:56,730 --> 02:21:00,050
there's a professor of physics
at the University of Maryland

2310
02:21:01,060 --> 02:21:06,060
in College Park Correcting Computer Code
found in the computations of quantum

2311
02:21:06,761 --> 02:21:07,200
physics,
physics.

2312
02:21:07,200 --> 02:21:10,960
What the fuck does that
mean? Yeah. So he found an,

2313
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:15,780
I don't claim expertise in everything
he said. I had him on a panel. Uh,

2314
02:21:15,781 --> 02:21:20,430
we have an annual, uh, an annual, uh, uh,

2315
02:21:20,431 --> 02:21:22,590
event at the American
Museum of natural history.

2316
02:21:22,591 --> 02:21:27,330
That's my day job there as director
of the Hayden Planetarium. Uh, and,

2317
02:21:27,650 --> 02:21:27,810
uh,

2318
02:21:27,810 --> 02:21:32,790
once a year we have this panel and I
bring on my colleagues who are active on

2319
02:21:32,791 --> 02:21:37,620
the bleeding frontier of some topic
and I put them on stage and we all just

2320
02:21:37,621 --> 02:21:41,820
fight about who's right or is there
enough data where and where is,

2321
02:21:42,300 --> 02:21:43,830
should I believe you should I not?

2322
02:21:44,040 --> 02:21:48,890
And so it's the annual Isaac Asimov
panel debate and it's designed to, uh,

2323
02:21:48,990 --> 02:21:53,790
to expose an aspect of science
that the public hardly ever sees.

2324
02:21:53,791 --> 02:21:58,791
They usually see that the
perfectly written paper and
the news report on it and

2325
02:21:59,071 --> 02:22:00,720
everything is tidally discovered.

2326
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:05,790
They don't see the bloody bleeding edge
where the fisticuffs. Um, come out.

2327
02:22:06,060 --> 02:22:10,500
And so on this particular
case, he, uh, Jim Gates,

2328
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:11,100
uh,

2329
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:16,100
discovered that there's a certain in
our representation of the universe.

2330
02:22:18,270 --> 02:22:21,480
Quantum theory, yes, yes. Uh, in, in, in,

2331
02:22:21,540 --> 02:22:25,320
in the way we have come to understand
the universe and our methods and tools

2332
02:22:26,010 --> 02:22:31,010
deep down within that is necessary a
code rit in Zeros and ones that is a s a

2333
02:22:36,361 --> 02:22:40,590
particular kind of error checking,
uh,

2334
02:22:40,650 --> 02:22:45,180
algorithm that we invoke daily and the
movement of data from one system to

2335
02:22:45,181 --> 02:22:48,810
another and it's called a checksum. Or
you might've seen that in an error code.

2336
02:22:49,260 --> 02:22:52,800
If anytime an error dump happens
on your screen, go look in there,

2337
02:22:52,801 --> 02:22:54,810
you'll see the word checks
on him in multiple places.

2338
02:22:54,990 --> 02:22:57,840
It's one word checksum and it's a way to,

2339
02:22:57,870 --> 02:23:02,370
it's like the idiot check on did this
bulk of data get through this portal.

2340
02:23:02,810 --> 02:23:05,250
All right,
so you know,

2341
02:23:05,670 --> 02:23:09,000
you're looking at that sort of the
gross thing you can check for, you know,

2342
02:23:09,001 --> 02:23:11,970
how many total bits were there?
I don't know if they're the right bits,

2343
02:23:12,270 --> 02:23:15,630
but I know how many total bitch
should've come. So let me check for that.

2344
02:23:15,770 --> 02:23:17,710
So that's the kind of thing
you do in a check sum.

2345
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:22,850
So he asserts that this exists deep
within what we need to represent the

2346
02:23:23,551 --> 02:23:28,350
operations of nature at its deepest,
most fundamental levels.

2347
02:23:29,160 --> 02:23:33,810
It is the matrix re deep and so,

2348
02:23:33,900 --> 02:23:35,860
so all right.
So that's so I,

2349
02:23:35,861 --> 02:23:40,620
so I was astonished by this and I paused
and actually there's a youtube video of

2350
02:23:40,621 --> 02:23:44,130
me in gas.
I'm interrogating him and,

2351
02:23:44,460 --> 02:23:48,330
and now I don't know that it's seen
peer review yet. I've got a [inaudible],

2352
02:23:48,331 --> 02:23:51,560
he's a friend of mine so I
can just call him up. But uh,

2353
02:23:51,810 --> 02:23:56,640
for before you start getting excited
about it or bent out of shape about it or

2354
02:23:56,641 --> 02:23:57,870
disturbed about it,

2355
02:23:58,230 --> 02:24:03,230
you wanted to see peer review and that
the level of expertise in that analysis

2356
02:24:04,260 --> 02:24:05,580
is above my pay scale.

2357
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:10,110
So it's got to go to peers who do exactly
that kind of mathematical physics.

2358
02:24:10,290 --> 02:24:12,570
And if they come out with
a consensus and they agree,

2359
02:24:13,020 --> 02:24:14,430
then I'm good to go and I'll,

2360
02:24:14,431 --> 02:24:16,920
and I'll invest more energy
and coming to understand it.

2361
02:24:17,370 --> 02:24:19,950
But for every correct idea
of how the universe works,

2362
02:24:19,951 --> 02:24:21,450
there's hundreds and in some cases,

2363
02:24:21,451 --> 02:24:26,451
thousands of ideas that end up in
the trash bin of creative thinking.

2364
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:31,470
And so, so I, I have to
allocate my energies and my, my,

2365
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:34,920
my budget of time.
And so it's intriguing and um,

2366
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:36,960
and I'm happy to know that it exists,

2367
02:24:37,230 --> 02:24:41,190
but to take it beyond that and wax
philosophically poetic about it.

2368
02:24:41,700 --> 02:24:44,130
Maybe over a beer at a bar, but no, not,

2369
02:24:44,190 --> 02:24:48,600
not in an actual setting where I'm
talking about science. So it's,

2370
02:24:48,840 --> 02:24:50,970
or maybe when you're hot,
you know, it's great.

2371
02:24:50,971 --> 02:24:55,970
It's great fodder for conversation when
you think you're being deep, right?

2372
02:24:56,170 --> 02:24:58,250
When you get done with your
chem trails talk, that's,

2373
02:24:58,390 --> 02:24:59,910
I'm talking about computer simulation.

2374
02:25:00,870 --> 02:25:04,110
The universe is on a hard drive.
The multiverse is on a backup drive,

2375
02:25:04,111 --> 02:25:08,700
like a raid drives. Oh, the, all
the backup drives of the multiverse.

2376
02:25:09,090 --> 02:25:12,450
That's why it doesn't have
all the information as the
same universe because it

2377
02:25:12,451 --> 02:25:15,640
only takes the base so it can like back.
He's going to make you dumb.

2378
02:25:15,740 --> 02:25:20,160
If you keep going to him, he will propose
some things that will ruin your brain.

2379
02:25:21,500 --> 02:25:24,250
The computer simulation has been

2380
02:25:24,250 --> 02:25:26,290
bandied about in a bunch
of different forms.

2381
02:25:26,320 --> 02:25:30,550
And the idea being that one day we'll
have infinite amounts of processing power

2382
02:25:30,551 --> 02:25:34,360
and we will be able to create a reality
that is indiscernible from this reality.

2383
02:25:34,630 --> 02:25:37,900
And once that is done,
how will we know when we're in it?

2384
02:25:38,110 --> 02:25:39,490
And could we be in it right now?

2385
02:25:39,491 --> 02:25:43,390
And this is sounds like more
high horse shit nonsense,

2386
02:25:43,540 --> 02:25:46,840
but this is being bandied about by some
of the smartest people on the planet.

2387
02:25:47,080 --> 02:25:50,350
Yeah, I remain unconvinced.
I mean of what I've read.

2388
02:25:50,470 --> 02:25:54,790
And you're talking about basically
Kurt's while in the singularity, no,

2389
02:25:54,791 --> 02:25:56,710
not necessarily, but it's, it folds in,

2390
02:25:56,711 --> 02:26:01,711
so sort of requires the acceptance that
the day will come where our computing

2391
02:26:02,351 --> 02:26:06,670
power in our storage power because it's
growing exponentially with Moore's law.

2392
02:26:06,671 --> 02:26:11,671
It doubles every 18 months or
so in capacity and speed and,

2393
02:26:11,690 --> 02:26:14,830
and all the metrics that
matter when you're doing. Uh,

2394
02:26:14,850 --> 02:26:16,540
and when you're an information technology,

2395
02:26:16,930 --> 02:26:20,950
the hypothesis that one day we can
just upload our entire brain into her

2396
02:26:20,951 --> 02:26:25,150
computer or a computer can simulate
your brain in some fundamental way.

2397
02:26:25,151 --> 02:26:27,940
Then what do we need you for
if we can now just simulate it.

2398
02:26:28,270 --> 02:26:29,890
I mean the here in La,

2399
02:26:29,891 --> 02:26:34,090
the actor's version of that is they've
just digitize your body in every angle,

2400
02:26:34,091 --> 02:26:35,980
doing everything.
What do we need you for

2401
02:26:36,090 --> 02:26:39,840
exactly what they don't and we
need to get rid of most actors.

2402
02:26:41,520 --> 02:26:45,330
They need to be outsourced. I don't
think the actor's union is happy about,

2403
02:26:45,331 --> 02:26:48,870
they can suck it. They're
unnecessary humans for the most part.

2404
02:26:48,990 --> 02:26:51,570
Some of them are beautiful and
they're the, for every Samuel Jackson,

2405
02:26:51,571 --> 02:26:56,430
you got a million Douche bags. That's
reality. So that flawed institution

2406
02:26:58,530 --> 02:27:01,890
would you say buddy? He said blue,
blue cigarettes. I'll Stephen Dorff.

2407
02:27:02,280 --> 02:27:05,190
You ever seen those ads?
No. Proof of this. All La.

2408
02:27:05,340 --> 02:27:08,670
There's a broad spectrum of intelligent
life on this planet itself and you need

2409
02:27:08,671 --> 02:27:10,290
to see the ad for blue cigarettes.

2410
02:27:10,291 --> 02:27:14,460
It's a black and white ad where Stephen
Dorff is telling you how cool it is to

2411
02:27:14,461 --> 02:27:15,960
smoke electronic cigarettes.

2412
02:27:16,530 --> 02:27:19,830
It's the second douchey is
commercial that's ever existed.

2413
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:23,520
The first is Brad Pitt's Chanel
number five commercial. Have you seen,

2414
02:27:23,730 --> 02:27:25,180
I've only seen the stills and all of that.

2415
02:27:25,230 --> 02:27:26,920
You want to become a dumber
person for a few more.

2416
02:27:26,921 --> 02:27:28,410
I can show you that can make you dumber,

2417
02:27:28,440 --> 02:27:32,310
not just slightly dumb or like
1000000th of 1% dumber. Oh,

2418
02:27:32,311 --> 02:27:35,460
we're running out of time. Just let's
show him that we'll end with stupidity.

2419
02:27:35,730 --> 02:27:37,890
Listen, man, you're,
you're a brilliant person.

2420
02:27:37,891 --> 02:27:41,510
Thank you very much for not just being
here, but for what you do. You know,

2421
02:27:41,730 --> 02:27:44,850
even Mrs Rogan was excited that
you were on the podcast today.

2422
02:27:45,690 --> 02:27:48,450
It's a big on science as you can tell.
She wants a real diamond.

2423
02:27:49,490 --> 02:27:53,580
Tell I'll word mixed animal, smuggle
one out under blindfold for, let's see,

2424
02:27:53,581 --> 02:27:55,400
what else would I can do?
Your,

2425
02:27:55,410 --> 02:27:59,370
your passion for knowledge and your
passion for distributing it. And it's,

2426
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:01,380
it's so infectious and
it's so fascinating.

2427
02:28:01,381 --> 02:28:06,210
And I got a lot of Twitter messages today
about you coming on and a lot of them

2428
02:28:06,360 --> 02:28:11,010
were from people who said that you
ignited their passion for science and you

2429
02:28:11,011 --> 02:28:15,710
made them pursue specific career goals.
And I got to do,

2430
02:28:15,740 --> 02:28:17,610
sent me this message
about who's an engineer.

2431
02:28:17,611 --> 02:28:19,630
I became an engineer because
listening to you, I'm

2432
02:28:19,630 --> 02:28:20,950
deeply appreciative of,

2433
02:28:21,200 --> 02:28:24,980
but let me pose that and let me analyze
that in a slightly different way.

2434
02:28:25,040 --> 02:28:29,660
I already know that the universe
is an extraordinary place,

2435
02:28:29,930 --> 02:28:31,430
but not everyone else does.

2436
02:28:31,850 --> 02:28:36,850
So part of what I do is serve as a conduit
between the curiosity in our culture

2437
02:28:38,990 --> 02:28:41,600
that is embedded there,
even if you forgotten it,

2438
02:28:41,810 --> 02:28:45,290
because I know it's within us all because
it's there in all of us when we're

2439
02:28:45,291 --> 02:28:48,170
children, Aka, you're a bad motherfucker.

2440
02:28:49,630 --> 02:28:54,630
I do is park the curtains for people
to recognize the awesomeness of the

2441
02:28:56,541 --> 02:29:00,410
universe that is there with or without me.
Well,

2442
02:29:00,411 --> 02:29:03,500
you have a beautiful way of looking at
it and I really appreciate your humility

2443
02:29:03,501 --> 02:29:06,140
in that, in that respect. Um, but it,

2444
02:29:06,141 --> 02:29:10,820
that perfect storm of personality
and knowledge is very rare and I just

2445
02:29:10,821 --> 02:29:12,560
appreciate you for being who you are.

2446
02:29:12,561 --> 02:29:15,380
And I thank you very much for being on
the can I just say, you know why I'm out?

2447
02:29:15,430 --> 02:29:16,940
I'm in la now because we're,

2448
02:29:16,970 --> 02:29:21,720
we're beginning to shoot the old things
through the applause in the corner. We,

2449
02:29:21,760 --> 02:29:25,490
we are, we are creating
the next generation cosmos.

2450
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:28,060
A Cosmos for the 21st century.
Yes.

2451
02:29:28,100 --> 02:29:31,730
The Carl Sagan time
with them all over that.

2452
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:35,900
But that was from 1980 it's been 33 years.

2453
02:29:36,140 --> 02:29:39,830
So we're doing it now. It's gonna
be another 13 episodes. It's cosmos,

2454
02:29:39,860 --> 02:29:42,500
a spacetime Odyssey. Is it
PBS as well? No, it's not.

2455
02:29:42,501 --> 02:29:47,120
PBS would have a hugely larger market
exposure because it's going to appear

2456
02:29:47,570 --> 02:29:51,050
likely in primetime, but we're not sure
that yet, but it's going to air on Fox.

2457
02:29:51,051 --> 02:29:55,220
Holy Shit on Fox. A strong. That is,

2458
02:29:55,250 --> 02:29:58,880
that's amazing. God, that's going to
be so good. We've got Seth macfarlane,

2459
02:29:58,910 --> 02:30:02,710
who's our, it's sort of broker,
he, he brought us to Fox. I had,

2460
02:30:02,711 --> 02:30:06,770
I became latter day friends with him and
he's a fan of Cosmos and he loves Carl

2461
02:30:06,770 --> 02:30:10,140
Sagan. He's a fan of my work.
He's a fan of wheat to hubs.

2462
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:14,060
The lead, a powerful Seth
Macfarlane, the council.

2463
02:30:14,061 --> 02:30:17,960
Those conversations I've had with him
that perhaps some counselors conversation

2464
02:30:18,040 --> 02:30:22,430
of, he came to it, Neil, I got to
talk to you. I said, let's have lunch.

2465
02:30:22,431 --> 02:30:22,881
We have lunch.

2466
02:30:22,881 --> 02:30:26,180
He asked me all these questions about
the big bang and the cosmic microwave

2467
02:30:26,181 --> 02:30:30,200
background and the early universe and
I said, okay, you're, you're good now.

2468
02:30:30,201 --> 02:30:34,290
He said, yeah, I'm good. And then three
months later there's an episode with Stu.

2469
02:30:34,291 --> 02:30:38,420
We went back to the big bang and I
get a full card credit at the end.

2470
02:30:38,421 --> 02:30:42,860
His science advisor, no, I was like
lunchtime entertainment for her,

2471
02:30:42,861 --> 02:30:45,110
but it was like a science advisor episode.

2472
02:30:45,140 --> 02:30:48,710
One of the greatest things about creating
this podcast has been the opportunity

2473
02:30:48,711 --> 02:30:51,590
to have these kinds of conversations.
I could've never corralled you and said,

2474
02:30:51,591 --> 02:30:52,940
hey man. Yeah, I know the conversation.

2475
02:30:52,941 --> 02:30:56,060
The guy who hosts the UFC and fear factor
wants to sit down with you for three

2476
02:30:56,061 --> 02:30:58,850
hours. He'd be like, yeah, tell
that dude, I got shit to do.

2477
02:30:59,510 --> 02:31:01,980
But the fact that I could
pick your brain for this low,

2478
02:31:01,981 --> 02:31:05,780
the fact that you even have this curiosity
and it's and you've nurtured it in

2479
02:31:05,781 --> 02:31:08,870
your fan base is great. So great to be
on your show. Thank you. So I really,

2480
02:31:08,871 --> 02:31:11,540
really appreciate it.
And you can follow Neil on Twitter.

2481
02:31:11,541 --> 02:31:15,950
It's a n e I l Tyson on Twitter.
And follow him,

2482
02:31:15,951 --> 02:31:20,070
you Fox and let them show them some
love please. Uh, thank you very much

2483
02:31:20,070 --> 02:31:20,581
for being here.

2484
02:31:20,581 --> 02:31:25,110
Thanks everybody for all the messages
on Twitter and Facebook and all the

2485
02:31:25,140 --> 02:31:29,430
various comedy shows, speaking of
which this weekend, this Friday night,

2486
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:32,600
two shows, uh, here at
the Ice House in Pasadena,

2487
02:31:32,670 --> 02:31:37,290
eight 30 and 10 30 with a Ari Shaffir.
You comment, you want to, you want it.

2488
02:31:37,370 --> 02:31:40,510
I might not be around my
house and posting lined up,

2489
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:45,960
but I'm me and Ari will be there and
we'll probably have some other local guys,

2490
02:31:45,961 --> 02:31:49,410
whoever's in town, I think Callans and
towel. I'll get him to come by. But uh,

2491
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:51,640
we're here. We're going to
have a good fucking time. Um,

2492
02:31:51,690 --> 02:31:55,470
thank you very much for coming
by and watching our podcast.

2493
02:31:55,500 --> 02:31:57,180
Thanks to on it for sponsoring it.

2494

they're going to be there and what,

2499
02:32:16,660 --> 02:32:19,920
what shows they have coming up as
well. Always great comics, great.
