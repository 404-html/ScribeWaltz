1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:03,260
Her low freak bitches way.

2
00:00:03,261 --> 00:00:06,090
Most people think that
if you don't use it,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:07,170
you're an like,

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,303
if you don't,

5
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:08,980
it will save.

6
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,350
You Do,

7
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:10,230
do something every day.

8
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:14,340
Like I had a friend who was a longshoreman
and he worked with this guide that

9
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:16,650
would shoot heroin every day at lunch.

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,400
And that always freaked me out because
the guy showed up for work everyday on

11
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:21,150
time.

12
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,470
He was a responsible guy,

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,370
he was married,

14
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:26,100
he had children and this
guy would get heroin.

15
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:27,660
He would cop every morning.

16
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,070
He would go there and he would sit in
his truck and he would shoot up and you

17
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:32,400
know,

18
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,180
whatever,

19
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,190
however long that lasts,

20
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:35,341
you know,

21
00:00:35,341 --> 00:00:38,310
he gets an hour lunch break and
they would come back and go to work.

22
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:40,290
And I would like every
day he goes every day.

23
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,400
Like I did it every day.

24
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:41,881
Well,

25
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:42,211
you know,

26
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:42,410
I,

27
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,530
this past summer,

28
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,760
the past three months or so,

29
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,060
I,

30
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,450
I,

31
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,640
I was in Geneva,

32
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,210
just got back in the states.

33
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,080
Um,

34
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,030
and I was working in a heroin clinic
where they administer heroin every day,

35
00:00:54,031 --> 00:00:55,080
seven days a week,

36
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,370
twice a day to people who meet
criteria for heroin addiction.

37
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,980
And when I say day administer heroin,

38
00:01:01,981 --> 00:01:04,320
I don't mean like small doses,

39
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:07,770
I mean doses that they'll
up to like a gram a day,

40
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,420
a thousand milligrams a day,

41
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:12,660
a lot more than what people use
here in the states typically.

42
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,980
And these people who are
getting heroin every day,

43
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,220
a large percentage of
them also go to work.

44
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,450
A large percentage of them have families
and they're taking care of their

45
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,560
responsibilities.

46
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,891
They are,

47
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,950
this is their treatment and this
is a treatment that works for them.

48
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:34,370
But their treatment include two
daily doses of intravenous heroin,

49
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,560
seven days a week,

50
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,161
you know?

51
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:38,760
And,

52
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,530
and so like when I think about,

53
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,540
well one of the reasons I went there,

54
00:01:42,541 --> 00:01:46,080
and I did this because of the way
we think of heroin in this country,

55
00:01:46,081 --> 00:01:48,120
we think of it as such as evil drug.

56
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,300
And that's just a American mythology.

57
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:51,430
And,

58
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,680
and that's just wrong.

59
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,670
And that's ignorance and,

60
00:01:53,671 --> 00:01:57,930
but that's how many including drug
experts in this country think of heroin.

61
00:01:57,931 --> 00:01:58,764
But that's just,

62
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,590
we have all of this great technology,

63
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:04,620
but we're so ignorant when it
comes to many of these drugs.

64
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So heroin administered
intravenously a daily basis is not,

65
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,520
it's not devastating.

66
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,893
No.

67
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,561
In fact,

68
00:02:13,561 --> 00:02:16,220
some people would do better
about having a daily doses,

69
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,900
a daily dose of heroin or another opiate.

70
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,160
Um,

71
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,660
no,

72
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,600
it's not devastating.

73
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,280
I didn't see even me.

74
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,330
I would go,

75
00:02:24,331 --> 00:02:25,021
fuck man,

76
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,040
that's got to fuck you up.

77
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,660
Like taken heroin every day.

78
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:28,481
Yeah.

79
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:28,811
And it's,

80
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:29,070
it's,

81
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,630
it's been this whole journey.

82
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:30,831
Men,

83
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,040
since I saw you last time,

84
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,050
I've been all over the world and this
whole journey to see what people do with

85
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,560
drugs or with drugs they're
using and how they do it.

86
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,540
It's been so eye opening,

87
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,351
even for me,

88
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:47,850
someone who has spent their life studying
drugs and I'm learning so much more

89
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:48,290
now.

90
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:48,430
And,

91
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,910
but the Switz experience of,

92
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,160
uh,

93
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,660
the Dutch also do this.

94
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,060
There are some parts of
Germany that does this.

95
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:55,460
They have small programs in,

96
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:56,191
in the UK,

97
00:02:56,191 --> 00:02:57,360
they had small program.

98
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,171
There are other countries,

99
00:02:58,171 --> 00:03:01,450
but the Swiss by far have the biggest
program and they've been the most

100
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:01,961
successful.

101
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,120
They've been doing this
for more than 20 years now.

102
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,630
And he started doing this in response to,

103
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,680
um,

104
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,040
uh,

105
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,240
HIV concern.

106
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,520
People worried about folks getting HIV.

107
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,830
So they had to do something,

108
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,950
had to have clean needles,

109
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,740
we had to make sure that
the drugs were pure.

110
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,250
Um,

111
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,660
so they're worried about death,

112
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,530
HIV,

113
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,370
all of those things.

114
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:25,300
And this was the rational response
where they put it in a medical community

115
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,250
where people got treatment and,

116
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:27,640
and,

117
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,060
um,

118
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,720
along with their heroin and they
have no plans of going back,

119
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,471
nor should they,

120
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,640
because it works.

121
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,660
The mind is such a motherfucker,

122
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:40,520
like if you could just get your mind
to do what your heart wants to do,

123
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,810
life would be so much easier.

124
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,540
Like there are so many
times I'm in the cage,

125
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,600
right.

126
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,733
And

127
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,160
I don't know if my brain knew
what my heart was trying to say,

128
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,530
but that's what I wanted to do.

129
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:54,861
You know?

130
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:55,694
And it's so,

131
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,653
and then you

132
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,910
fuck,

133
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,260
I can't even put words on it,

134
00:04:00,261 --> 00:04:00,531
you know,

135
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,330
it's crazy.

136
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,750
Do you do any mental training?

137
00:04:02,751 --> 00:04:05,350
Do you do any meditating
or any visualization?

138
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:07,840
Fucking high school Budweiser
rather than talking about,

139
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,150
God dammit fucking fight is a fight,

140
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,470
but I probably maybe should,

141
00:04:12,471 --> 00:04:13,760
I mean seminars,

142
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:14,640
but you're a,

143
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,150
because of your style and
because of nick style,

144
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,310
you guys are both really well loved.

145
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,870
Like if something like
that happened with you,

146
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:23,620
you could go do seminars and
make a few grand every weekend.

147
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:23,931
Maybe.

148
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,890
Maybe not in Dublin.

149
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,763
I don't have to go anywhere.

150
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,870
Once you guys fought,

151
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,843
you could do it.

152
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,480
If you and Connor fought and duked it out,

153
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,660
had an epic contest,

154
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:33,410
then you could do it.

155
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,130
You know,

156
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,440
I'm just a big stick in the mud.

157
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,570
If you beat him a couple times decisively,

158
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:40,610
you'd have to beat them to
where they have to just give in.

159
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,511
They'd have to say,

160
00:04:41,511 --> 00:04:41,930
all right,

161
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,763
you had to beat him,

162
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:43,850
beat him.

163
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:47,830
But if you're fucking cut down
to one 45 you had nailed it.

164
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,650
Torch him.

165
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,750
Fucking Connor exam.

166
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,140
Man,

167
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,660
I appreciate the fuck out of that guy.

168
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,543
That guy's doing.

169
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,950
He's getting eyes on the sport.

170
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:55,880
Yeah,

171
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,713
he met Ron.

172
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,650
He really pisses me up.

173
00:04:57,651 --> 00:04:59,720
I feel like to tell him when
he was in the fucking pressure,

174
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,310
but I wanted to rip him so bad.

175
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,820
Of course.

176
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,700
Wanted to kill my own bag.

177
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,880
You know what car you can blow
me like a cup of hot soup.

178
00:05:04,881 --> 00:05:07,520
You son of a bitch but low
me on like a cup of hot soup.

179
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,423
How's that work?

180
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,310
You blow on a cup of hot soup.

181
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,144
Is that what it is?

182
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,630
Yeah.

183
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,463
Okay.

184
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,753
I don't,

185
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,470
but if he just blows you like that.

186
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,210
That's why it's confusing.

187
00:05:17,211 --> 00:05:18,590
The vernacular is really odd.

188
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,880
Like blow jobs.

189
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,860
I don't understand why that

190
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:25,460
blow me like a cup of hot soup first time.

191
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,211
First Time.

192
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:27,044
There you go.

193
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,401
Yeah.

194
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:28,250
I've never heard that one before.

195
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,084
I've been around

196
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,580
the uphill

197
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,060
battle because the way it's
being treated presently.

198
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:36,930
Um,

199
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,450
if you look,

200
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,780
the literature from 2012,

201
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:44,781
410,000 servicemen came
back as veterans and,

202
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,270
um,

203
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,520
were diagnosed with PTSD.

204
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,020
Now a post traumatic stress disorder
is usually perceived as being a

205
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:53,040
psychological,

206
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,143
um,

207
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,770
psychologically precipitated event
where they witnessed something that was

208
00:05:57,771 --> 00:05:58,790
horrifying to them.

209
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,500
A death of a friend,

210
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,860
loss of a limb or whatever the situation
might have been to stimulate it.

211
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,720
And that immediately opened him
up to simple treatment here,

212
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:11,510
take this packet of antidepressants
and you'll get better.

213
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:11,811
Well,

214
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:15,110
they didn't get better so they didn't get
better because they were having what's

215
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,000
called treatment resistant depression,

216
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,120
which now we find is due
to hormonal deficiency.

217
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,250
If you look at the civilian population,

218
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:26,480
people with hormones with
treatment resistant depression,

219
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,920
you check them out and they testosterone
deficient or estrogen overdose or low

220
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,740
progesterone or low pregnenolone,

221
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,270
other chemicals that are in our brain.

222
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,100
And um,

223
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,060
these individuals have been the,

224
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,953
um,

225
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:46,990
the foundation of what I do in trying
to find a simple way to replenish them.

226
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:51,320
What you have to do is test
them and that's not being done.

227
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,190
It's so much easier just to hand a
packet and say you have PTSD when the

228
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,380
majority of them are
traumatic brain injury.

229
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,730
And um,

230
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:03,730
I was on Dr drew show with one of our
patients who was a army corpsman and he

231
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,310
didn't have a single scratch on his body.

232
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,850
But within two years of leaving
a separating from the service,

233
00:07:10,851 --> 00:07:12,980
he started developing depression,

234
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:13,671
mood swings,

235
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:14,990
explosive personality.

236
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:19,310
He ends up coming into our program and
we find out he has two and a half hormone

237
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:20,090
deficiencies,

238
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,030
and the pattern is indicative
of having had head trauma.

239
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,470
Well,

240
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:27,860
it turned out he would walk
behind Abramson tanks as
they were discharging their

241
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:28,371
shells,

242
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:28,821
and he said,

243
00:07:28,821 --> 00:07:29,091
man,

244
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:30,140
my body would shutter,

245
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,330
and it was around javelin missiles.

246
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:34,460
He was around repetitive gunfire.

247
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,140
He personally didn't
have a scratch on him.

248
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,131
That's incredible.

249
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:38,240
That just the recoil,

250
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,700
just the Bucharest does the sonic boom,

251
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:42,590
the impact that that,

252
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,010
you know,

253
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,611
shocking.

254
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:44,900
His body can do that too,

255
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,773
right?

256
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,680
[inaudible].
