1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,601
Trey,

2
00:00:00,601 --> 00:00:03,750
my daddy Joe Rogan
podcast by night all day.

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,740
Like I would love to watch Tyron
Woodley versus Damien Maia.

4
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,640
Love it.

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,720
I would love to watch it.

6
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,440
That would be that.

7
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,210
That to me is maybe one of the
most interesting fights on,

8
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,480
on the horizon for me so far,

9
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:18,600
Damien Maia has been able to take
down wrestlers that exact 70.

10
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,250
He's been able to take them all down.

11
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:20,580
Yeah.

12
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,110
Like easy and just the
beautiful technique and uh,

13
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:27,000
but can you do that to
Woodley and you've got to go?

14
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:27,450
No.

15
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,010
You got to go through the storm,

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,250
the storm of fucking meteors coming.

17
00:00:32,251 --> 00:00:33,870
Your way that Woodley drops on you.

18
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:37,950
Cause he's the most dangerous
in that first round.

19
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:38,551
When you're,

20
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:39,900
you're trying to take him down,

21
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:42,990
you're closing the distance on them and
you haven't like figured out how fast he

22
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,400
is yet because he's not,

23
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,390
he doesn't just hit hard.

24
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,710
He's fucking fast.

25
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,611
I saw some,

26
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,300
uh,

27
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,320
just rumor,

28
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:49,771
I'm sure,

29
00:00:49,771 --> 00:00:51,420
but a Brisbane was talking about it.

30
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,510
Him and Woodley a grand
a Superfight at one 80.

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,130
Really?

32
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,630
Bisbing being Woodley real.

33
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,580
When did they agree to this?

34
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,050
Uh,

35
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,550
I was talking to my
brothers sworn he was like,

36
00:01:02,551 --> 00:01:05,370
you see Woodley and Bisbing want
to do that catch weight at one 80.

37
00:01:05,371 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm like,

38
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,930
that's an interesting fight.

39
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,240
First of all convincing,

40
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,360
make that healthy.

41
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,650
That's what I was thinking.

42
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,540
Cause five's a tough cut for,

43
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,720
I remember when he used to
fight 2:05 PM two oh five.

44
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,440
Yup.

45
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:16,920
Wow,

46
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,790
that's an interesting fight.

47
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,710
Well I think what,

48
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,500
what would they want is that big payday?

49
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,010
He's like,

50
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:21,843
let's not,

51
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,290
yeah,

52
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,730
I mean he's campaigning for it.

53
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:24,300
Look at this.

54
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,620
Mike Bisbee and Tyrone
Woodley agree to catch weight.

55
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,780
This is legit.

56
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,110
So it's just happened
today on the Internet.

57
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,650
What is the name of the,

58
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:32,950
um,

59
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,350
the Internet low kick,

60
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,460
mma.com.

61
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,413
Interesting.

62
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,020
That's Bisbing through
Instagram and shirt.

63
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,980
Very interesting.

64
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:41,843
Very interesting.

65
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,490
So a gangster weight as
Chael Sonnen calls it.

66
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,031
Yeah,

67
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:45,864
I like it.

68
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,973
I like it.

69
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,300
But like to your point,

70
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:51,120
Woodley just wants a big
fight for lucrative payday.

71
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:51,961
That's all he wants.

72
00:01:51,961 --> 00:01:53,490
The biggest name possible to get paid.

73
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:53,821
Yeah.

74
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,271
Smart.

75
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:57,270
That's the name of the
game and the Anderson back.

76
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:57,630
Uh,

77
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:02,040
and that has been still been calling for
a rematch with a Bisbing to cause his

78
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,080
fight with Bisbing was so
fucking close in England.

79
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:05,040
He feels like he beat him.

80
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,130
That was one of the craziest situations.

81
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:07,830
Several years.

82
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,120
He hits him with that flying neat.

83
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:09,954
Kaos awesome.

84
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:10,471
I mean,

85
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:11,304
Bisping was out.

86
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,271
He went out,

87
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:15,300
he dropped and Anderson does
a walk off K on they go,

88
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:15,780
Eh,

89
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,530
not so quick.

90
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,730
It was so weird.

91
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,223
So weird.

92
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,780
Nope.

93
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,260
Oh why does that make get a video of that?

94
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,350
Cause remember Bisbing takes a break
cause his mouthpiece falls out and he's

95
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:26,800
like talking to the ref and Anderson goes,

96
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:28,890
oh that's right.

97
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,500
That's right.

98
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:29,750
He,

99
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,830
he was trying to get the referees at
tension and Anderson Flying Nita and the

100
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,440
ref like coming in to stop it
than Ashton did that flying knee.

101
00:02:37,441 --> 00:02:38,251
That's why the ref was like,

102
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:38,671
hold up.

103
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:38,821
No,

104
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:40,020
that doesn't look at that.

105
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:42,270
That's very weird.

106
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,230
Cities being boxed his fucking face off.

107
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,810
Like he's saying something.

108
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,640
It's herb dean.

109
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,121
Look,

110
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:48,751
he's like right there.

111
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,170
Right there.

112
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,950
Boom.

113
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,360
Oh Jesus.

114
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,890
That was also the end of the round two,

115
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:53,161
right?

116
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:53,700
Yeah.

117
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,540
Oh my God,

118
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:54,991
Jesus,

119
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:55,824
look at this again.

120
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,670
He's like,

121
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:56,851
Hey,

122
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:58,080
let me get my mouth PC.

123
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,820
Oh Shit.

124
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,830
Oh boy.

125
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,550
So look at this.

126
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,510
Boom.

127
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,270
That is such a crazy drop
to the way you get hit,

128
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,480
you know,

129
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,130
thrown the knee regardless whether
he looked to the side or not,

130
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,570
I think he would have
thrown it regardless.

131
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,030
And it wasn't like Bisbing
put his hands down.

132
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:16,901
He looked over,

133
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:18,010
but he was still covered up.

134
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,980
Here's the crazy thing that I think he
was a little distracted there for sure.

135
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,000
Here's the crazy thing.

136
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,460
Bisbing comes back and wins
that fucking fight face off.

137
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,910
How'd you in that actually comes out that,

138
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,960
I think that was the third round,

139
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:29,171
right?

140
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:32,830
He comes out that fourth
round and his face off crazy.

141
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,320
Like a fucking kangaroo crazy recovery.

142
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,120
That means unbeliefs.

143
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,290
Cardiovert insane.

144
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,471
Yeah,

145
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,000
because most people get hit like that.

146
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,511
That's it,

147
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,344
man.

148
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,271
I mean,

149
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,580
his body shut off and he dropped.

150
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:45,761
No,

151
00:03:45,761 --> 00:03:49,060
the power would give us
a second and we're back,

152
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:51,790
but partially blind in
one eye or completely.

153
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,460
Partially.

154
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:52,750
Yeah.

155
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,700
But he could still see,

156
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,590
he can see enough where
they let him fight.

157
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,783
Mm.

158
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:57,911
Yeah.

159
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,530
I mean he does those dye tests.

160
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:00,430
They have to do I test.

161
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,230
Apparently what they did is they put
some kind of oil in his eye and that oil

162
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,270
like protects his retina
somehow or another.

163
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,530
And that's why it looks so crazy.

164
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,090
And once he's done fighting,

165
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,110
then they'll fix it.

166
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,770
But the problem is like if he gets it
fixed now and then he goes and fights

167
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,180
again and tears it even worse.

168
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,590
And then the other thing is,

169
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,330
the more time he waits,

170
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:22,060
the more advanced all the
stem cells shit is getting.

171
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:22,840
Like they write,

172
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,230
they brought someone's vision
back with stem cells applying guy.

173
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,400
Someone was blind and they injected stem
cells in this guy's eye and brought his

174
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,870
vision back there.

175
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,250
And that's today,

176
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,890
2017 what's it going to be like five,

177
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:36,131
six,

178
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:37,200
seven years down the line.

179
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,640
And this may be retired by then.

180
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,600
I would hope be be retired three or four.

181
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:40,961
I mean,

182
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:42,370
I think he's 39 now,

183
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,204
right,

184
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,253
Michael?

185
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,010
Uh,

186
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:45,390
yeah.

187
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,690
I might not be that old.

188
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:47,141
I might be,

189
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,610
I might be a up in them up a bit.

190
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,910
36 it might be (373) 063-0730 seven I
don't think he has three years left.

191
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,201
Well,

192
00:04:56,201 --> 00:04:56,871
he might say,

193
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:57,071
look,

194
00:04:57,071 --> 00:04:57,341
she's like,

195
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:57,511
God,

196
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:58,720
it's so fucking game.

197
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,290
You know,

198
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,130
Michael Bisbing does not have
any extraordinary physical
attributes and not that

199
00:05:03,131 --> 00:05:03,911
he's not a great athlete.

200
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,600
He certainly is not.

201
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,411
He's done a very good fighter.

202
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:05,910
He certainly is,

203
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:06,580
but cardio.

204
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,230
But if you look at a guy like rumble,

205
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,240
extraordinary physical attributes,

206
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:10,960
John Linacre,

207
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,790
extraordinary physical attributes.

208
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,970
Well Michael Bisping
has is just toughness.

209
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
Just game as Foc,

210
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,903
toughness,

211
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:19,811
knock 'em out.

212
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:22,260
He comes back and he
just keeps coming back.

213
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,960
There's no quit and there's not any,

214
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,341
is great.

215
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:25,630
Cardio is no quick,

216
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,830
amazing cardio.

217
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,510
Ryan Parson says in the gym,

218
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,160
he said he's never seen a guy that hates
getting tapped and hates losing more

219
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,460
exchanges more.

220
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,690
I've never seen anything like it.

221
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,770
Even even just,

222
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:37,510
you know how you do like
your normal warm up,

223
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:38,470
like if you're doing under hook,

224
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:41,350
just he's going 100% nonstop.

225
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,370
Like how the foot that slowed down on him.

226
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:45,310
The title man fucking title.

227
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,240
He's a hall of fame.

228
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,560
Better and better.

229
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:49,510
Even watch him improve.

230
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:51,880
Fight to fight his boxing,

231
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,920
his boxing's ridiculous man.

232
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:59,130
It's [inaudible] Silva
knocked out Rockhold Luke
Rockhold Lotoja disdainful in

233
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:01,190
that fight.

234
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,431
Like,

235
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:01,641
like,

236
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:02,151
come on man.

237
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,070
What are you gonna get pissed.

238
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:03,890
Yeah,

239
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,371
he's busy.

240
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,204
It's show up for that flood.

241
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,451
Yeah.

242
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:07,970
He was like disdainful that
that was his challenge.

243
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,233
He got marked.

244
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,510
Oh and Bisbing was shooting
triple x 19 in Toronto was like,

245
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,100
AH,

246
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,271
yeah,

247
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,840
I'll be down in four days to swirl champ.

248
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,150
What a great fucking story.

249
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,150
It's the best for 10 years.

250
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:22,760
Best store.

251
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,630
I fucking love.

252
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:27,920
Bisbing and then beats Dan Henderson in
a close decision for this talk was all

253
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:28,790
fucking fight.

254
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,920
You forget about that fight when
we talk about fights of the year.

255
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,370
Oh yeah.

256
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,810
That fight was so good.

257
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:33,644
So good.

258
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,161
And again,

259
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,840
his cardio.

260
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,120
Yeah,

261
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,040
he got he,

262
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,910
he landed h bomb twice.

263
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:38,330
Yeah,

264
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,950
landed it that Zombie Mod back
and just start fucking boxing.

265
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,660
That's fucking crazy.

266
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,680
Got nothing but hard.

267
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,190
That much harder to tell you something.

268
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,090
I had a funny feeling about Luke Rockhold.

269
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,170
Luke was taking it seriously.

270
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,480
I didn't that you think
your days and I'm like this.

271
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,050
He already beat them as
being too for fucking years.

272
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,270
All he needs is one shot,

273
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,100
but business name a knockout artists like
the bedding art for him to knock Luke

274
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,850
Rockhold on the first round.

275
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:08,521
I don't have no,

276
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:09,171
let me tell you something.

277
00:07:09,171 --> 00:07:13,430
If my daughter catches you in one of
those swinging overhand punches and clips

278
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:14,390
that tip your chin,

279
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,453
you got a problem.

280
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,723
Hey Brian.

281
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,480
Brian told me he would just new blocks
in gym and the guys that came mind if

282
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,290
this girl,

283
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,450
he's going to kill me
for telling the story.

284
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,130
You might have this girl jumps in there
and swap some rounds and Brian's like,

285
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,353
sure.

286
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,351
He starts to move around.

287
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:31,340
This bitch is dead serious and
shit's him with the right hand.

288
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:31,940
Brian was like,

289
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,380
Oh shit.

290
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,050
He said he's like a little wobble.

291
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,400
I'm like,

292
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,560
Bro,

293
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,670
if anyone catches you flush man.

294
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,050
Yeah,

295
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,350
you mean for a long night?

296
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,640
But actually the point of the Chan,

297
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:45,080
the way La Rockhold caught and Bisbing
Bisbing swung it over the shoulder.

298
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,460
It was a beautiful left hook.

299
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,010
He stepped in with it and
just whipped it over the top.

300
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,750
And it was something that him and Perillo
had seen in rock holds game per Lowe's

301
00:07:52,751 --> 00:07:53,360
coach of the year.

302
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,110
Very good code.

303
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,070
Hands down coach of the year.

304
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,500
Very good.

305
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,840
Could be Tito teases coach.

306
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:57,853
He still is.

307
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,993
Yeah.

308
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,230
He worked with Bj.

309
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,310
He's worked with a lot of guys.

310
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,050
Bj,

311
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:02,570
uh,

312
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,403
Tito,

313
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,920
cris Cyborg and Michael Bisping.

314
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,690
He's a quiet guy in terms of what,

315
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,900
he's not out there trying
to get a lot of publicity.

316
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:10,370
He's not a attention whore.

317
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:12,680
Is this an excellent boxing coach?

318
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,000
Really knows his shit.

319
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:23,570
Yeah.
