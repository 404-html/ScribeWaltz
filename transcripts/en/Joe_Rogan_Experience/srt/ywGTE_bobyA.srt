1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,770
Thank you to whoever gave me this
this weekend at the Ice House.

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:08,220
Some dude gave me hunter s Thompson
is the rum diary on nice paper back.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:10,890
Just one of the things that God did,

5
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:11,910
his share of drugs,

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,280
psychedelics.

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,750
Have you done your share yet?

8
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:16,290
No,

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:16,731
not yet.

10
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:19,170
As much as I took a four hour
shower on mushrooms once.

11
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,393
Nice.

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,490
And then I was hiking in big whiskey
mountain on mushrooms with my buddy.

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,230
We decided to take a back route,

14
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:25,831
which you never do.

15
00:00:25,831 --> 00:00:27,030
I was climbing up a landslide.

16
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:28,350
That's smart and I was like to my buddy,

17
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:28,501
I go,

18
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:29,220
dude.

19
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,431
He goes,

20
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:29,551
what?

21
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:29,880
I go,

22
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,050
you got to move with the mountain.

23
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,340
You're not moving with the mountain.

24
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,570
He's like,

25
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:33,901
okay.

26
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:34,800
He's a real mountain mine.

27
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,511
So he's climbing.

28
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:35,671
I go,

29
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:35,930
it's done.

30
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,763
I'm over in the mountain.

31
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,620
Okay,

32
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,820
I'm going to stay here
and talk to this rock.

33
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,700
And I had to have a conversation
with a rock and then as he tells it,

34
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:43,020
we're on top of whisky mountain,

35
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,610
which is a very big mountain.

36
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,240
Okay.

37
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,270
Luckily it was in the summer as well.

38
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:47,630
I was with,

39
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,940
I was dating patty back in the day and
they were waiting downstairs and he turns

40
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:55,470
back around and I'm not
wearing any clothes and I mean,

41
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,543
no clue.

42
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,530
And I'm up on top of a mountain that,

43
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,660
that takes like a really
long time to climb up.

44
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,710
And I'm naked.

45
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:02,910
What'd you do with the clothes?

46
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,140
We never found my clothes.

47
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,990
No,

48
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:06,630
but I did stop and need
a lot of blueberries.

49
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,990
And by the time we asked,

50
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:10,161
took a,

51
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:13,380
she had squatting and then
as I was doing that naked,

52
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:18,120
my buddy moved some branches pretending
it was a bear jumped up and started to

53
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,150
run and uh,

54
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:20,310
that caused a problem.

55
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,400
And then I came back down the mountain,

56
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,270
all scratched up,

57
00:01:24,271 --> 00:01:27,260
no quotes and I can stop
and eat blueberries.

58
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,920
My buddy who got you
stop eating blueberries.

59
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:29,940
I had a blue mouth,

60
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,731
a shit.

61
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:31,530
You walked,

62
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,640
you walked barefoot.

63
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:33,750
That's right.

64
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,200
My food.

65
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,420
I'll cut up my going to take,

66
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,020
I don't know,

67
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,400
a day and a,

68
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,234
I literally,

69
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:39,730
literally,

70
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,630
literally probably four
hours or something,

71
00:01:42,631 --> 00:01:43,464
like a five hour.

72
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,520
We're up at any point in,

73
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,354
during the war.

74
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,201
When I finally got down,

75
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,560
I had a blue mouth from
eating blueberries and,

76
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,610
and I was all cut up and patty was like,

77
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,871
what are you doing?

78
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:52,111
I was like,

79
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,430
I need to did my ass in the lake.

80
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:55,440
I've shit ass cause I didn't have,

81
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,190
I couldn't walk,

82
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,023
wipe it.

83
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,571
So,

84
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:58,110
uh,

85
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,880
yet another one of my shit stories.

86
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:00,714
Thank you.

87
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,621
So,

88
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,221
so she was like,

89
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:02,431
wow,

90
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:03,241
that's attractive.

91
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:03,511
You're a,

92
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:04,250
you're my man.

93
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,170
Well I'll take the skinny guy with
the blue mouth and a shit in his ass.

94
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,690
It was coming down off mushrooms.

95
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,440
So that was my experience with marsh.

96
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,630
How much did you take?

97
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,160
Did I heat?

98
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,310
My buddy gave me just a handful,

99
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,330
handful,

100
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:18,960
it goes eat them.

101
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,793
I was like,

102
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,700
okay,

103
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,140
I want to have an experience.

104
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,900
You got to eat him on an empty stomach.

105
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:25,321
I hadn't eaten.

106
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:25,651
Of course.

107
00:02:25,651 --> 00:02:26,484
That's really good.

108
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:27,990
And we're climbing man.

109
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,480
And I just started literally
just hallucinating.

110
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:30,600
I,

111
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,190
you're better off that
you didn't eat anything.

112
00:02:32,191 --> 00:02:34,220
If he had eaten it something
you'd probably throw the problem.

113
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,060
I took a shower one time,

114
00:02:36,061 --> 00:02:37,200
I wouldn't get out of the shower.

115
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,940
Patty was banging on
the door and I was like,

116
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:39,451
I'll be there.

117
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,800
I'm trying to figure something out.

118
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,700
And then,

119
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,060
nope.

120
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,960
It's hard to explain.

121
00:02:42,961 --> 00:02:46,350
But I believe I kept seeing my profile
and the first thing I was like,

122
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:46,950
as I kept saying,

123
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,491
oh I fuck,

124
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:48,690
I wish I was barrel chested.

125
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,710
I'm not barrel chested.

126
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,450
My grandfather's barrel chested.

127
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:54,060
I know I have a sunken chest.

128
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:54,900
This is horse shit.

129
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:55,900
And I was,

130
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,431
I was like,

131
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,450
that's a terrible profile.

132
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,620
So then I resolved,

133
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,500
resolved.

134
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,400
I was in the shower to just spend
the entire summer on a bench press.

135
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:04,480
I was going to hire a coach,

136
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:05,350
just a bench,

137
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,850
which that never happened.

138
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,230
And then I came out of the shower and
then I had this experience of somebody

139
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,570
standing like watching me and judging me.

140
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,360
And I felt like it was the devil
telling me that I was a phony.

141
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,010
So I was like,

142
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:17,091
oh,

143
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:17,741
I'm a phony.

144
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:18,850
I'm a skinny phony.

145
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,960
He was the devil.

146
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:20,823
I don't fucking know.

147
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,780
I just felt I saw this.

148
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,600
That just felt like
that's what it was like.

149
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,740
It was just the truth and
so me and I was so raw.

150
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,300
I came out one thing,

151
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,370
God maybe,

152
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,750
maybe or was it just felt like the devil
because he didn't want to admit the

153
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,081
truth.

154
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:35,621
Exactly.

155
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:36,160
That's what the,

156
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,080
that's what the bank that is bro.

157
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,240
I can always tell people,

158
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:40,930
you can just see,

159
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,000
it's so interesting to watch how people,

160
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,950
like I was thinking
about this the other day,

161
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:49,420
how people basically as adult like I
would call it to adulthood and what they

162
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:54,421
call maturity is the slow acceptance
of what you will never be.

163
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,320
That's kind of what it is.

164
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,070
So what happens is you so much things.

165
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:58,740
I was like,

166
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,460
you see little girls
dressed like princesses,

167
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:01,020
right?

168
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,290
And,

169
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,410
and that's their ideal.

170
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:03,430
They grow up with these ideas.

171
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,000
We still,

172
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,470
we stick these ideals and children.

173
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:08,620
Like you're going to marry a prince and
he's going to be pimped prince charming

174
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,780
and that shit gets whittled away.

175
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,720
You start settling for
simulation and simulation.

176
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,170
It.

177
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,310
Basically your life becomes,

178
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,850
I'll take what I can get until finally
you're dating some guy with hair on his

179
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:19,950
ears and a potbelly,

180
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:20,231
well,

181
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,550
at least he pays a fucking bills,

182
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,870
which is when I had to get them.

183
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:23,530
By the way,

184
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,330
I like to get them when they're
just going through a divorce,

185
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:27,250
had their heartbroken to 300 times.

186
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:29,140
They're 40 they work out way too much.

187
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,960
That anger and frustration is combined
into this fucking wood creates like a

188
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,070
freaky that I can really work with.

189
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,560
Hotel 39 year old.

190
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,490
Crazy wall.

191
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,143
Yes.

192
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,261
Yes.

193
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:45,041
Look at my ass.

194
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,060
I'd work out all the time.

195
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,073
That's house.

196
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,930
Yeah.

197
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,140
I like them old,

198
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,993
not even old,

199
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,893
old.

200
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:53,823
That's young for me.

201
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,980
So when you're coming down the hill,

202
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,300
you're totally naked.

203
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,830
You're high as a kite on mushrooms.

204
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:00,341
Do whatever.

205
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:00,941
Any point.

206
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:04,720
Realize like you starting to
sober up at any point in time,

207
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,480
like what's what's happening
as you're sobering up,

208
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:06,731
what,

209
00:05:06,731 --> 00:05:07,360
what was happening?

210
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,110
As I was sobering up and because I'm such
a freak because I had read a lot about

211
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:15,220
how when you can be on a mountain in the
summer or a winter storm can brew up,

212
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,331
right.

213
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:17,200
They can keep up,

214
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,390
you can get caught in hail storms,

215
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,370
freeze to death actually sometimes,

216
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,180
you know.

217
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,841
And so,

218
00:05:22,841 --> 00:05:23,230
uh,

219
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,070
I was like,

220
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,120
I was like I got to get the phone and
I'd read about k two and I don't know if

221
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:29,770
you've ever read about climbing k two.

222
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,390
It's one thing to climb Mount Everest.

223
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,340
It's quite another thing to can't climb.

224
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,210
K Two I believe there's only
one side of k two one can climb.

225
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,340
And for a while I believe in,

226
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:42,280
you can check this on
factcheck one in four people,

227
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:42,700
uh,

228
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,780
wouldn't make it,

229
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,690
uh,

230
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,850
on k two people died all the time
because before people would make it like

231
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,630
didn't survive.

232
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,530
Can you do fact check?

233
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:52,530
Cause I believe that was
the case for quite awhile.

234
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:53,580
She's crashed.

235
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,440
And so what happened was it was the holy
grail of mountain still is cause uh,

236
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,130
cause um,

237
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,730
what happens is storms whip
up really fucking fast.

238
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,250
Like really fast and a,

239
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,084
and you die.

240
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:05,980
Yeah.

241
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,381
So,

242
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:07,940
so what happened was I,

243
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,570
um,

244
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:11,720
I started thinking of storm might
whip up and I suck in the cold.

245
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:12,590
Whoa.

246
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,780
What does it say on fact check?

247
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,741
Um,

248
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,970
it's just talking about there was a,

249
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,800
there's been a bunch
of disasters up there.

250
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,011
Oh,

251
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,550
a lot of people have died on Kaytoo.

252
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:20,940
Yeah.

253
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,741
You don't climb k,

254
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:22,970
two very few people.

255
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:25,280
Client when you meet a
mountain climber and they said,

256
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,870
I got to the top of k two.

257
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,150
That dude is on the all star team.

258
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:29,750
Wow.

259
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,490
That's a very rare dude.

260
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,440
And you have to go through Pakistan,

261
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,910
I think on the Pakistan side.

262
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,423
Yeah.

263
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
No bodies and you pass
bodies all the time.

264
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:48,960
Okay.
