1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:02,860
Freak bitches,

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,120
like I remember when I lived in Aspen,

3
00:00:05,121 --> 00:00:10,121
they have the Esi body guard academy
and aspect that stand that I don't know,

4
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:18,371
but the guy supposedly was in a room six
by 12 room where he killed 12 Mexicans

5
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,330
at knife point with his bands.

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,420
So he opens up this uh,

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,380
Esi thing and it's,

8
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:24,741
you know,

9
00:00:24,741 --> 00:00:25,820
it's 20 g's,

10
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:26,271
you know,

11
00:00:26,271 --> 00:00:26,531
it's,

12
00:00:26,531 --> 00:00:31,531
it's a summer long program and you learn
how to adjust up at the high altitude

13
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:34,400
and drive and evasive
driving and shooting.

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,420
Then they have a course on maritime,

15
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:39,770
how to defend people out on
the ocean and all that stuff.

16
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:40,910
But uh,

17
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,300
she aspen and all those
places like Woody Creek,

18
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:46,010
where you went to his home,

19
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:51,550
to the baddest retired soldiers in the
world and you don't know who they are.

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,060
You just think that dude over there with
the American flag is mowing the lawn.

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,970
That guy killed 80 people
want to add them because got,

22
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,320
just got endeavor that I know.

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,120
I'm telling you,

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,150
I'm Colorado,

25
00:01:02,151 --> 00:01:03,200
is where they put them.

26
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,760
Why,

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,593
why they put them.

28
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,550
Because the mountain is to keep them
away from civilization for these people

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,340
just in case they get
Chinese music somewhere else.

30
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,620
Don't ever want that to happen.

31
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,360
Break glass in case of war.

32
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,590
And there was a guy that came in that
was the marine that bro Joe know anybody

33
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:19,610
comes in with stories.

34
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:21,470
I know one thing when I see it,

35
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:22,304
I believe it.

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,990
The motherfucker used to get picked up
at Aspen and put in the helicopter job

37
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,751
like they said,

38
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:31,610
like a helicopter with two guys jumping
out for guys around them and he would

39
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:32,680
just wave and uncle joey.

40
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:36,050
I was 19 and he would
tell me stories about,

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,900
you know,

42
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,900
the green berets and all these guys were
sitting around the thing cooking chili

43
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,510
and it was telling how
many people they killed.

44
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,600
Killed 18.

45
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:47,660
I killed 22.

46
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,480
Meanwhile he was stirring the
soup with his big over the fire.

47
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,111
You know what I'm saying?

48
00:01:53,111 --> 00:01:56,420
Like that's the type of
stories this guy would tell me.

49
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,200
He had me all fucked up in their
head and I asked him once I go,

50
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:01,460
should I go to that Esi?

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,361
And he goes,

52
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,020
listen,

53
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,900
I go in there and smack
them all with my left hand,

54
00:02:05,901 --> 00:02:06,734
and he goes,

55
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,550
first of all,

56
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,550
you can't teach what you need to learn
over there because four years of Charlie

57
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:17,120
and the Bush is a lot
better than 12 weeks.

58
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:20,720
Are you hanging out with some white dudes
which suits shooting people targets in

59
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:21,020
the mind?

60
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:21,980
It's not real.

61
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,090
It's not until there's real concert
six that is a big part of what the,

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,200
uh,

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,670
election was about talking me.

64
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,550
You making a say and think things
or just letting things be real.

65
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:34,851
Well,

66
00:02:34,851 --> 00:02:36,260
it goes in cycles.

67
00:02:36,261 --> 00:02:37,610
We go one way and we go the other way.

68
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,683
That's what it is.

69
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,510
It's just like we got tired of
people going so hard politically.

70
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:41,781
Correct.

71
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:43,850
But you see how there's progress now.

72
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:45,370
Like we were talking about school.

73
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:45,771
Yeah,

74
00:02:45,771 --> 00:02:46,311
exactly.

75
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:46,521
I mean,

76
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:47,354
you can't,

77
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,590
I mean that's good.

78
00:02:48,591 --> 00:02:50,420
People would walk into our schools,

79
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,450
kids would walk up to other
kids that were kind of slow.

80
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,360
What are you retarded
like right to their face.

81
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:56,781
Look at him.

82
00:02:56,781 --> 00:02:57,561
He was a sped.

83
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:59,950
He's retarded that exist anymore.

84
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,450
And I think it still exists,

85
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,080
it just exists less and not where your
kids go to school in comparison to where

86
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,914
you go to school.

87
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:08,710
I mean a bit of La unified and
you're hanging out in compton.

88
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,900
I bet you see some bad shit in school.

89
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,163
Probably.

90
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,760
This is probably some bad shit's
still going on in a lot of schools.

91
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,300
A lot of kids are getting bullied and
people understand the consequences of that

92
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:19,601
now.

93
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:22,330
Like you're scared to go to class
cause someone's going to hit you,

94
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,380
scared to go to class.

95
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,214
Someone's beat new.

96
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,070
But bullying was just part
of life isn't bullying.

97
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,360
It was just life back then.

98
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,670
But it was just bullying and
it did ruin people's lives.

99
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:30,851
Did.

100
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,810
But nobody called it out.

101
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:33,340
No adult would help you out with it.

102
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,790
No,

103
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,870
it's just the way it went.

104
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,310
You have to learn how
to take care of Shit.

105
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,800
And everyone was being
bullied by somebody else.

106
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,130
It was a,

107
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,390
it was dog eat dog.

108
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,253
It was.

109
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,190
Yup.

110
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,023
You know,

111
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:43,790
I don't know.

112
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,310
I think that you're right.

113
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,810
I mean the politically correct thing.

114
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,070
There's it swings that way and you're
left with some good stuff and everybody

115
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:54,850
adjusted and then it goes too far and
you start to go after things that don't

116
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,930
affect a lot of people.

117
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,260
Yeah,

118
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,550
and then people get fed up.

119
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,270
I will those.

120
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,900
The thing is those people that go
too far that go too far with all that

121
00:04:01,901 --> 00:04:02,890
politically correct stuff,

122
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,920
they're almost always
emotionally unbalanced,

123
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,310
so given enough time they will reveal
themselves to be either crazy or power

124
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:18,851
hungry or like really like a big part
of that whole social justice warrior

125
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:21,890
movement is really about shaming people,

126
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,780
like expressing anger,

127
00:04:23,781 --> 00:04:25,070
attacking people,

128
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,061
gaining power,

129
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:28,340
punching people that disagree with you,

130
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,091
like punch,

131
00:04:29,091 --> 00:04:30,170
fascist punch,

132
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,690
punch Nazis like aggressive about it,

133
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,690
and that somehow know that this is a
good thing as if because there's so

134
00:04:35,691 --> 00:04:40,160
delusional on so detached from real
physical violence and they had this idea

135
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,520
that you're just going to go out there
and push these people and take back.

136
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:42,861
No,

137
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:44,030
they're going to show up with guns.

138
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:47,480
You fuck like this is how
wars get started to escalate.

139
00:04:47,481 --> 00:04:48,410
You try to control people.

140
00:04:48,411 --> 00:04:49,161
You pushed too far.

141
00:04:49,161 --> 00:04:50,210
You're not kind.

142
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,980
Instead you're shaming people,

143
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,320
you're creating bad
feelings and aggression,

144
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,420
like they've got this juvenile idea
about confrontation that it just goes out

145
00:04:59,421 --> 00:05:00,800
there and it never comes back to you.

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,010
It always comes back with luck.

147
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,923
Yeah.

148
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,040
It comes back.

149
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,820
It comes back.

150
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,480
Yeah.

151
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,950
I mean,

152
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,531
as much as,

153
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:06,811
as,

154
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:08,940
as the son was to walk
into his father's shoes,

155
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:09,720
uh,

156
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,760
it's just not worth it,

157
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,430
man.

158
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,710
It's really nice and you're
probably not going to be as good.

159
00:05:13,711 --> 00:05:14,580
That's just how,

160
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,530
what have you kid wanting to fight?

161
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,750
Like a bar,

162
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,400
like box?

163
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:18,700
Yeah,

164
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,031
boxer,

165
00:05:19,031 --> 00:05:19,864
kick boxer.

166
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,590
I wouldn't advocate that either.

167
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,710
You wouldn't let them do that.

168
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,890
I'm pushing them to go
towards like a education.

169
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,600
I want them to be scientists.

170
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,070
Like if I had to do it over again,

171
00:05:29,071 --> 00:05:30,330
I wouldn't have never played football.

172
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,081
I really,

173
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:31,231
yeah,

174
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:31,891
it'd be a scientist.

175
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:32,161
Not even.

176
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:33,270
You would start from the beginning,

177
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:36,150
like if you could go back to college
and knowing what you know now.

178
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,250
Wow.

179
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:41,580
Not even close and just because
of the damage to your body.

180
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,110
Well that and uh,

181
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,410
so it's,

182
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,243
it's a weird,

183
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,010
it's a weird thing.

184
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:47,311
So like,

185
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:48,144
you're,

186
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,170
you're in your prime physically as a,

187
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,751
as a man,

188
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,271
but you're,

189
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:54,150
you're in your infancy mentally,

190
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:54,740
right?

191
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,020
Right.

192
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,490
And so like I'm just now figuring out
who am and what kind of man I want to be

193
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,140
and you're,

194
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,500
you're,

195
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,280
while you're in your prime,

196
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,350
that's when you're in the public eye,

197
00:06:02,351 --> 00:06:06,410
so you have to deal with all of that on
top of figure so you're figuring out who

198
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:07,150
you are,

199
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,600
uh,

200
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,433
in a fishbowl.

201
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,830
And it's a really weird,

202
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:10,820
really weird thing.

203
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:12,890
So I don't even want to deal like,

204
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,610
like any kind of
recommendation or any kind of

205
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,060
fame or whatever people want to call it.

206
00:06:20,061 --> 00:06:20,894
Like I don't,

207
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,621
I don't like it,

208
00:06:21,621 --> 00:06:22,454
I don't want it.

209
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,250
I feel like the best to me,

210
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,273
the best uh,

211
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,450
society would be a artist and a scientist.

212
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,030
That would be a ideal society to me.

213
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:32,831
Wow,

214
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:34,240
that's an interesting take on things.

215
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:37,030
Considering how successful
you've been playing football,

216
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,201
playing football,

217
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:41,680
obviously it was very financially
rewarding to you made you famous.

218
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,180
Sure.

219
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,450
I mean if just some regular dude went
on twitter and start talking about I can

220
00:06:46,451 --> 00:06:47,200
take a wool farmer.

221
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,033
I know that he killed,

222
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,151
nobody will care and be like,

223
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:49,451
shut up,

224
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,400
stupid that anybody cares anyway,

225
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,263
but it's

226
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,290
fucking my twitter bloated.

227
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,960
But I said you were coming on

228
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,633
school

229
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,020
was going to kill us.

230
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,600
I don't know man.

231
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,080
Um,

232
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,800
it's,

233
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,131
it's a,

234
00:07:09,131 --> 00:07:09,851
it's a weird.

235
00:07:09,851 --> 00:07:11,530
I'm like,

236
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,490
once you get to that,

237
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:16,360
to that financial summit that everybody
strives for that American dream.

238
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:19,870
You realize that there is no there
and if you ain't happy with $10,

239
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:21,520
you're not gonna be happy with a million.

240
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,490
It's just not happening.

241
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,530
Um,

242
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,750
now granted there are
some things that you need,

243
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,100
you need monetary,

244
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,730
a value in the society to,

245
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,990
to a certain extent.

246
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:32,741
I think they did a study.

247
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:35,500
It's like after $75,000 a year,

248
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,790
money can't buy happiness.

249
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,670
So everything else out
there is kind of just,

250
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,523
it's just luxury.

251
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,050
And really if you put a perspective,

252
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:43,390
I think like 35 percent.

253
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,121
I mean if,

254
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:44,471
if you,

255
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:44,780
if you,

256
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,330
if you make $35,000 a year,

257
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:48,070
you're in the top one percent
of wealth in the world.

258
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:48,730
Yeah,

259
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,451
something like that.

260
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,000
So,

261
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,740
um,

262
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,910
it's all about perspective,

263
00:07:51,911 --> 00:07:52,181
man.

264
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:52,840
And once,

265
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,200
once,

266
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,770
once I,

267
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,210
it took me to get to that financial
summit to understand that unfortunately,

268
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:01,570
but the weird thing about it is once you
tell people that and you're on top of

269
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:04,090
this financial summit for you to say,

270
00:08:04,091 --> 00:08:04,391
I'm like,

271
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:05,020
all right,

272
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:05,750
of course.

273
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,460
Yeah.

274
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,940
Yeah.

275
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,721
Easy for you to know.

276
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:08,930
A lot of miserable millionaires.

277
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,911
Yeah.

278
00:08:09,911 --> 00:08:10,540
I was on a,

279
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,670
on a concord with Mohammed Ali,

280
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,540
uh,

281
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,373
and um,

282
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,341
the,

283
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:16,174
uh,

284
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,321
and he,

285
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:17,500
uh,

286
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:17,951
had his,

287
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:18,730
uh,

288
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,200
Angelo Dundee is that the guy?

289
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,690
He had his entourage with him.

290
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,020
And uh,

291
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,621
the uh,

292
00:08:23,621 --> 00:08:24,760
he was very nice man.

293
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:25,623
Very nice.

294
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,110
I only met him that one time and uh,

295
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,231
that's not true.

296
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:33,460
I was in the cotton club in 1978
cotton club black nightclub used to be.

297
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,140
And um,

298
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:35,951
the,

299
00:08:35,951 --> 00:08:36,071
uh,

300
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:41,071
there was a black comedian and I was
trying to a red a Red Fox Fox and I'm the

301
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:45,100
only white guy in the audience.

302
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,350
And he said something about white people.

303
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,960
So I had been tuned up pretty good.

304
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,010
And in back in [inaudible] 78,

305
00:08:51,011 --> 00:08:51,970
I thought it was pretty tough.

306
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,520
I stood up and I said
something back to them.

307
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,060
Now this went over like
a Turd in a punch bowl.

308
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,300
I mean all these people
that are around me,

309
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,800
all the color of Fox and so fox is,

310
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:05,101
hey,

311
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,030
you don't want to come up here.

312
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,660
And so I go.

313
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:11,660
And then Mohammed Ali was sitting about
six tables over and he protected me.

314
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:12,670
He said,

315
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,250
we've got to let this white boy alone.

316
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:14,891
I mean,

317
00:09:14,891 --> 00:09:15,000
no,

318
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,110
we don't want a problem here.

319
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:16,940
So then I say,

320
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,640
well,

321
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:17,840
yeah,

322
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,860
you don't have to protect me.

323
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,470
I just was up 80 young.

324
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:21,951
Yeah.

325
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:22,440
Yeah.

326
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,380
And I tried to pay the
bill in Muhammad Ali says,

327
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:25,770
no,

328
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,120
your money's no good here.

329
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:29,460
The money's not a great job.

330
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,383
Oh No.

331
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:30,901
Yeah.

332
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:31,260
They didn't,

333
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,260
not forcibly but,

334
00:09:32,261 --> 00:09:33,250
but they essentially.

335
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:34,763
Yeah.

336
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,220
Yeah.

337
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,010
Then I take care.

338
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,930
Get out of here with your life.

339
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,793
You're correct.

340
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,580
Correct.

341
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,413
But anyway,

342
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:39,981
so,

343
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:40,051
uh,

344
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:40,830
but um,

345
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,310
yeah,

346
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,270
I had a big mouth.

347
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,811
Listen,

348
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:43,330
Dan Pena.
