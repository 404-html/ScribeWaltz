1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,650
The joe rogan experience.

2
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:02,523
Give me that shit.

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:04,163
Did you uh,

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,550
did you check out my,

5
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:05,910
um,

6
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,740
special bombing episode that I earned?

7
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,071
No,

8
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:08,851
you told me about it.

9
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,440
We were talking about
it before the podcast.

10
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:10,711
We,

11
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,960
it's funny where I'll almost
three hours then we were going to,

12
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,480
we really mention it or two hours in.

13
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:16,620
Um,

14
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,453
what the fuck happened?

15
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,370
You were up in Winnipeg as a Winnipeg.

16
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,443
I was um,

17
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,240
doing this club that I've
done many times called rumors.

18
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:24,961
It's the old club.

19
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,961
It's a good club and it was a Saturday
night and instead of like regular comedy

20
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:33,654
club crowd,

21
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:37,180
it happened to be like private events.

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,910
People like a group of 80 was
doing their corporate party,

23
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:42,481
you know what I mean?

24
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,320
So it wasn't like,

25
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,470
it wasn't individuals
buying one and two tickets,

26
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,330
which was a giant group,

27
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,270
giant groups.

28
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,430
There was like three groups.

29
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,680
One was like 81 was 60.

30
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,933
So you don't like,

31
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,560
it's more like you're doing a corporate,

32
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,700
like you're doing a private event,

33
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:57,743
you know,

34
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,100
and I talk,

35
00:00:59,101 --> 00:01:00,210
I break it down if you,

36
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,680
if you want to listen to,

37
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,070
it's episode one 72 of your mom's house
and I play the audio from this thing

38
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,800
falling off the rails.

39
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,750
And I mean it is like,

40
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:14,700
there was a lady who worked at the club,

41
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,070
she's been there 20 years and she told me,

42
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,281
she goes,

43
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,330
I've never seen shit like that.

44
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,520
Even close to that before what happened?

45
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:21,270
It was,

46
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,000
I mean I think it's like a,

47
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,870
a combination of things happening to them.

48
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,460
They fall apart that way.

49
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,660
Basically.

50
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,520
I went up there,

51
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,780
I had one guy in the
front row who I fucking,

52
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:36,981
you know,

53
00:01:36,981 --> 00:01:40,650
when he'd just hate somebody and you
fixate on them because like this one guy

54
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,330
who was like kinda mumbling,

55
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:42,930
talking,

56
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:43,591
tagging my,

57
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,280
everything I saw no.

58
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:45,541
He's like,

59
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:45,721
yeah,

60
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,620
I bet you'd like that.

61
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,101
And you're like,

62
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:47,340
what?

63
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,180
What did you just say?

64
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,950
One of those guys who I fucking
absolutely lost my shit.

65
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,610
I didn't lose my shit on them,

66
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:59,460
but I kind of tried to
straighten them out.

67
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,220
And then there was one of the groups,

68
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,310
one of the groups of like 50 50 60 people
was like being super loud and like the

69
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:10,410
first like really talking about
when I went to talk to them,

70
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,060
they were kind of like dis
like kind of shitty about it.

71
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:16,230
And the thing is like,

72
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,400
it's different when you,

73
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,770
when you do a regular show and you,

74
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:22,020
let's say you go after somebody
or you go after a table,

75
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,040
you're just working on five people,

76
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:28,080
maybe write a group that like,

77
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,260
but then everybody else in that
room has nothing to do with them.

78
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,070
Right.

79
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,000
In this case it was more like mob
mentality where when I was like,

80
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,270
hey,

81
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,380
go fuck yourself.

82
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,070
Then the group is like talking to us.

83
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:41,971
Not you're not,

84
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:42,751
you're not just talking to them.

85
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,810
You're talking to my group
of 80 so then it was like,

86
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:46,021
no,

87
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,120
fuck you like,

88
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,020
but in in unison there's all
of them and then it just went.

89
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,120
Then I tried to put it back on the rails,

90
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:54,541
which I was like,

91
00:02:54,541 --> 00:02:55,620
I'm sure I can,

92
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,420
I've done this a thousand times.

93
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,070
Let me put this back together.

94
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,150
Fuck you man.

95
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,013
Like it was like,

96
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:03,460
dude,

97
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,350
they were booing in unison
for like 1520 minutes.

98
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,870
The 80 people at this point,

99
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,090
it was more than their groups.

100
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:13,780
So it was probably 200 people doing that.

101
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,913
All my God.

102
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,980
So is their group and then other
groups chimed in and Saria Boeing.

103
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,330
You two unrelated groups?

104
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,050
Yes.

105
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,410
Yes.

106
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,190
Wow.

107
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,090
It was pretty crazy.

108
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,740
And then they're like,

109
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,700
bring back the,

110
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
I had a black feature act to
like bring back the Black Guy,

111
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,130
like screaming that screaming it man.

112
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,840
And it went and I,

113
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,441
here's the thing,

114
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:35,230
I resigned to the fact
that it was so crazy.

115
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,240
It was less emotional.

116
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,520
I talk about this on that episode.

117
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:41,800
Then your standard bombing,

118
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,660
you're bombing an irregular bond where
it's just not going your way and you

119
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,920
start to sweat and you're like,

120
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,101
man,

121
00:03:48,101 --> 00:03:49,060
this fucking sucks.

122
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,560
Shoeing Dick's up here.

123
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,000
But like,

124
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,631
and that and that,

125
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,980
like emotionally affects you.

126
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This was different in that I felt like
their response to me was so outrageous.

127
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,410
Like I felt like it was unwarranted.

128
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:08,080
How upset they were that
it affected me less.

129
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,100
Like I was just standing up there.

130
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:09,934
I was like,

131
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:10,901
all right guys,

132
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:12,910
here we are ready for some more
jokes as they're booing me,

133
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,421
you know,

134
00:04:13,421 --> 00:04:14,410
like not as,

135
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,600
I wasn't as flustered as
I've been during a reg.

136
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:18,281
Real bomb.

137
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:18,670
Yes.

138
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,520
So you were just dealing with
a giant group of Conc yes.

139
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,510
A school of cons.

140
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,230
Yes.

141
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,550
Swimming through your pond.

142
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,270
Yeah,

143
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,500
exactly.

144
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,120
Why did the club do something about that?

145
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:28,540
That's,

146
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,270
that's the only part I
bikes I take responsibility,

147
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,880
I of that I tried to
make it clear on that,

148
00:04:33,881 --> 00:04:38,881
on that episode that like I'd take
responsibility for yelling at a guy,

149
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,840
for insulting people.

150
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,531
Like I'm saying,

151
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,410
I put it on myself that I
made things go downhill.

152
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,770
The club takes responsibility for kind
of not really policing and they like the

153
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:53,470
one part is I tried to,

154
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,820
I told a guy that he had to go.

155
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,241
I was like,

156
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:55,960
you have to go,

157
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,793
you're gone.

158
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,443
See you later.

159
00:04:59,020 --> 00:04:59,680
And you know,

160
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,610
I've done that before.

161
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,780
Sometimes you have to do that.

162
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,621
You're out of here,

163
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:02,890
man.

164
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,640
Right.

165
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,140
And then they were like,

166
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,520
the club came and taught and they're like,

167
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:07,630
just give him another chance.

168
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:08,530
He's going to be good now.

169
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,493
When I was like,

170
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,480
I've already thrown them out.

171
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,843
Like there's no,

172
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,910
we're not negotiating now.

173
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,510
Right.

174
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,430
So the club asked to keep the guy there.

175
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,293
Yes.

176
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,290
So that they do that.

177
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,860
I don't know.

178
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,940
But they,

179
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,310
they now realize that that was fucked up.

180
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,350
Like I've talked to
them and they were like,

181
00:05:23,351 --> 00:05:23,680
that was,

182
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,690
that was all some people you
can give a second chance.

183
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:25,871
I've,

184
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:27,400
I've most likely,

185
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,170
most of the time I've asked
clubs to leave people alone.

186
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,001
They're okay.

187
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:31,834
They're okay.

188
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,750
They're just not do that again.

189
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:34,810
And he'll say that.

190
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:35,051
I'm like,

191
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:35,320
yeah,

192
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,260
you can't yell shit out.

193
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:36,720
Just too,

194
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,570
too confusing.

195
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,070
I've done that a bunch of times.

196
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,060
Like he's okay.

197
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,480
Right.

198
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,150
But this time,

199
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,240
the difference was this time I was saying,

200
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,380
get them out of him out.

201
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,640
What was he saying to you?

202
00:05:45,641 --> 00:05:45,791
Well,

203
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:46,624
this is going on.

204
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,530
He was,

205
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,700
it was the fucking,

206
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,560
he was the Mumbler the the tower like,

207
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:54,190
so we had our first interaction,

208
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,600
we had another interaction,

209
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,660
I think the third I said something to him,

210
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,411
I was like,

211
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,460
what the fuck did you say?

212
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,380
I forget exactly what he said.

213
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,371
And then I was like,

214
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,210
oh you're a tough guy.

215
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,091
And he's like,

216
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:07,610
do you want to step outside and find out?

217
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,243
And I was like,

218
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,540
you can go outside cause
you're out of here.

219
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,463
You're done.

220
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,520
Get out of my fucking show.

221
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,133
It's my show.

222
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,033
You're Outta here.

223
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:16,941
And they were like,

224
00:06:16,941 --> 00:06:17,680
what?

225
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,260
And His table.

226
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,681
He goes,

227
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:19,281
we all go and go,

228
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,390
great and have a great night.

229
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,560
Get the fuck Outta here.

230
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,603
I don't need you here.

231
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,460
That's when the crowd was the problem.

232
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,190
We felt like we were
discussing what happened.

233
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,480
I was talking about it with the club.

234
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:34,481
The guy is that a lot of people in that
room didn't hear what he was saying.

235
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,340
He thought I was just
attacking a guy for no reason.

236
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,174
Right.

237
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,290
That makes sense.

238
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:42,750
But I still,

239
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:43,130
I take,

240
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,800
I was an asshole that night.

241
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,740
That's,

242
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,161
you know,

243
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,720
the guy was clearly,

244
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,680
he was instigating it.

245
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:48,981
Yeah.

246
00:06:48,981 --> 00:06:49,910
He was a fucking cunt.

247
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:52,760
He was a real concept of guy
and I didn't like him at all.

248
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,133
And you know,

249
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,300
I don't think that like,

250
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,590
like I always say,

251
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,320
I don't have to be like
pleasing to the different,

252
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:03,831
like I,

253
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:04,101
you know,

254
00:07:04,101 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm there doing comedy.

255
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,030
You came to see my standup if you want,

256
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:08,811
if you're not liking it,

257
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:09,590
that's cool.

258
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,020
But if you tried to take over the room,

259
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,040
no.

260
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,540
Well it's not just taking over the room.

261
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:15,320
It's interfering.

262
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,501
Yeah.

263
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:15,971
It's interfacing,

264
00:07:15,971 --> 00:07:18,320
interfering with the performance and it's,

265
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,830
there's hundreds of other people that
have to deal with the fact that you have

266
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:22,680
to deal with this guy.

267
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:23,680
It just,

268
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,050
it's,

269
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,710
it's all in how to do it and not lose
your cool and when you lose your cool.

270
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:28,011
Yeah.

271
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:30,150
So it's a fucking bad scene.

272
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:31,400
It's a terrible feeling too.

273
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,301
It's crazy.

274
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:34,160
And the audio is insane.

275
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:34,580
I mean,

276
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,210
you've probably not
heard alarming like that.

277
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,511
Yeah,

278
00:07:38,511 --> 00:07:39,111
it's a different,

279
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,000
it's not like a standard bombing.

280
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:41,780
I mean there's,

281
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,260
there's a lot of aggression from,

282
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,360
from the crowd on it.

283
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:45,200
And how does it end?

284
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,251
Well,

285
00:07:46,251 --> 00:07:47,150
the best part and the only,

286
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:49,340
cause I also was bummed at myself for not,

287
00:07:49,341 --> 00:07:49,731
I was like,

288
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:49,850
I,

289
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,540
you know,

290
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:50,720
Yo,

291
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,100
you always look at
moments where you're like,

292
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
I wish I had said something funny or here,

293
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:54,860
right.

294
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,990
This was an opportunity to be funny.

295
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,440
I really,

296
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,100
you know,

297
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,611
so I was like,

298
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,091
a lot of it,

299
00:07:59,091 --> 00:07:59,511
I was like,

300
00:07:59,511 --> 00:07:59,920
I was like,

301
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,170
ah,

302
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:00,380
you know,

303
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:00,830
I really,

304
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:01,401
they won.

305
00:08:01,401 --> 00:08:02,750
Like they defeated me.

306
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:03,531
I was like,

307
00:08:03,531 --> 00:08:05,150
but the only funny
thing I'd said was like,

308
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:09,560
at one point the manager came up
to this stage and he was like,

309
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:10,010
are you okay?

310
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,720
Like he was checking,

311
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,020
he came on stage and was like,

312
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,340
cause it was so crazy.

313
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,711
And then he's like,

314
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:13,771
Yo,

315
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:14,604
all right.

316
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,201
I was like,

317
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:15,720
yeah.

318
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,041
He's like,

319
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:16,731
do you want to keep you long?

320
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:17,001
I was like,

321
00:08:17,001 --> 00:08:17,834
yeah.

322
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,120
And he's like,

323
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,433
okay.

324
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,330
So he leaves and they're like,

325
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:23,511
yeah,

326
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:24,051
that's right.

327
00:08:24,051 --> 00:08:26,490
Get the f because they think
he's telling me get off stage.

328
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:27,860
And I go,

329
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,341
I go,

330
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:33,140
he asked me if you guys wanted
me to bring back the other guy.

331
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:33,501
And they go,

332
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:34,190
yeah,

333
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,210
I think they scream yes.

334
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:35,541
And I go,

335
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,410
I told him,

336
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,350
you guys want more of me so
here I am for more jumps.

337
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:40,184
And they're like,

338
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,730
so they go so crazy at that point.

339
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:46,010
He's a Canadians too.

340
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,281
Yeah,

341

342
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,550
But in the very end,

343
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,520
the lady who was running the,

344
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,140
one of the private events that night,

345
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:55,500
like she brought her group there,

346
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,870
she was in tears,

347
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,160
she was crying and they
brought her on stage.

348
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,650
They were like,

349
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,270
she wants to say something.

350
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:03,840

351
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:03,941

She gets up there and she's like,

360
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,820

372
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,700
It's like someone was beating her up.

373
