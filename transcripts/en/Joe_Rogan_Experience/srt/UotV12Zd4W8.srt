1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:03,480
Hello Freak bitches like,

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:03,601
ah,

3
00:00:03,601 --> 00:00:03,781
yeah,

4
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,750
you pulled the string back and
then you let the Arrow fly.

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,830
Pretty straightforward,

6
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:11,760
like I think that's most
people's idea of what archery is,

7
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,090
but then when you really pay attention
to the technical aspects of all the

8
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:21,270
different stuff that's going on and all
the different things you think about and

9
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:25,920
how you literally can not have anything
on your mind other than all the

10
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:26,461
technique,

11
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,080
involve your foot placement,

12
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:28,891
your technique,

13
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:29,730
and standing,

14
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:32,460
your breathing where how
you're drawing it back,

15
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:33,990
the position of your front shoulder,

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,910
the position of your rear elbow,

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,870
how you're pulling,

18
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,240
where it,

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,490
how,

20
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:37,860
what do you,

21
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,690
how do you respond after
the arrows released?

22
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,590
There's so much going on that like
when you put it all together like it,

23
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,211
it has.

24
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:47,940
It leaves no room for homework.

25
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:50,190
There's no room for relationship bullshit.

26
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:51,450
There's no room for taxes.

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,440
There's no room in there.

28
00:00:52,441 --> 00:00:52,890
Man.

29
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,600
If you want to make a nice shot like that,

30
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,710
like I guarantee you,

31
00:00:55,711 --> 00:01:00,690
if we could have a brain scan of your
head the second you release that Arrow at

32
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,940
a hundred yards to go
in that two inch gap,

33
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,140
there would be nothing in
there other than what you did.

34
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:08,550
There would be no other.

35
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,170
No other cells would be fired up.

36
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:10,840
No,

37
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,171
no.

38
00:01:11,171 --> 00:01:11,951
That's one thing.

39
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:16,420
And actually like yesterday
when we were shooting there,

40
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:18,190
towards the end of the day,

41
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:21,190
you got to the point where you're almost.

42
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:22,510
Your mind was clear.

43
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:24,160
It's almost like for me,

44
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:24,910
you know,

45
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,290
your family came home,

46
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,940
like things are winding down.

47
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,780
You knew that like work was over
and it was like right before dark.

48
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:32,531
And like for me,

49
00:01:32,531 --> 00:01:36,850
I love shooting it at first light and
it lasts light because it seems like

50
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:38,470
that's what I'm not really worried about.

51
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,360
Someone texting me or calling me.

52
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:45,361
I'm not worried about problem at home and
I shoot with a clear mind and I am way

53
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:49,480
more efficient in my practice
and it is a form of meditation.

54
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:49,781
I mean,

55
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:51,370
it's like you said,

56
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:55,930
it's an art and if
you're clouded than you,

57
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,180
it will reflect that on the target.

58
00:01:58,181 --> 00:02:02,050
I mean it's like if your
arrows are in one spot,

59
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,640
then you know you have a single focus and
it's almost like the more those arrows

60
00:02:06,641 --> 00:02:07,331
are spread,

61
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:12,331
that's a representation of how many
other thoughts and distractions you have

62
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,570
going in your mind.

63
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:13,811
I mean,

64
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:16,150
and I look at it that way when I shoot,

65
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,910
I'm trying to narrow everything down
to just a movement and you look at good

66
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:22,720
golfers,

67
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,190
the ones that swing easy and it
just literally looks like flow.

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,900
There's such good strikers and there's
so much more efficient when you see

69
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,090
people that are trying to be robotic and,

70
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,910
and almost like hack something.

71
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
Then it's like too systematic.

72
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,731
You know,

73
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:43,030
you see someone like that does
professional karate or something.

74
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:44,740
If they're in a forms competition,

75
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,230
if they're like real rigid going around.

76
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,120
It's just not what it's meant to be.

77
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:50,980
I mean it's supposed to be a dance.

78
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,010
It's supposed to be like literally a
mental musical that's planned and if your

79
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,180
mind is clear,

80
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,043
then it's.

81
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,270
It's a form of meditation.

82
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,080
Is it?

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,530
Do you ever have male instincts to like
buy a girl's neck when you're having sex

84
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:06,350
with her like that?

85
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:09,550
That kinda seems like you'd be somebody
that would be like a neck bite or you'd

86
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,250
be really into it and just
do not want you beaten off.

87
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,270
Thinking about how I felt,

88
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,210
so I will stop this
conversation right here.

89
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:18,670
It's.

90
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,230
You know what?

91
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,560
It's different with different girls,

92
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:21,403
right?

93
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,121
With different girls.

94
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:22,954
You dated.

95
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,030
Some girls get choked.

96
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,290
They just do.

97
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,100
I hit all that.

98
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,050
When a girl tells me to
slap them or choke them,

99
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:29,884
that's the worst.

100
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,873
I can't do it.

101
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,870
I'm not going to beat you up.

102
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,700
You're going to have to get
that from somebody else.

103
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:35,790
You're going to have to call Ari.

104
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,780
Do you think the daddy thing?

105
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:38,411
There's something there.

106
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:39,250
When girls are like,

107
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:39,971
fuck me harder,

108
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,451
Daddy,

109
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:41,590
when it's the whole daddy thing,

110
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,610
do you think there's more to it?

111
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:43,560
It's a dirty,

112
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,320
dirty,

113
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,830
dirty.

114
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:45,970
They don't mean their dad.

115
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
They mean you.

116
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,960
They want you to be their
daddy in that moment.

117
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:51,220
Not even like a father,

118
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:52,210
but like,

119
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,490
like the data that's given the Dick,

120
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,690
you know,

121
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,820
they don't even think it's
like a different word.

122
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,040
It's a different use of the word Daddy,

123
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:00,820
you know?

124
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,080
It doesn't mean the same thing.

125
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:04,090
It's like when you call
someone kept him sub captain.

126
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,070
You don't really think
that guy has a boat,

127
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,600
but what if they're following?

128
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:07,871
Yeah,

129
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:08,610
I totally know.

130
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:12,640
But they say there's one girl says it as
a kid though and she doesn't talk like

131
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:17,200
a kid in any other times except when
she's having sex and she said that she

132
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:17,590
goes,

133
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,990
she regresses into like tolerable.

134
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,070
Yeah.

135
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,130
Well she's dating you.

136
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,003
Yeah,

137
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,390
some dark shit happened Bro.

138
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,260
Yeah,

139
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:26,561
but see,

140
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:27,550
I go deeper in it.

141
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,060
I was like,

142
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,340
yeah.

143
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,760
He like,

144
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,910
daddy stayed late for school

145
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,230
while you're fucking her
seat leave for school.

146
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,310
I mean like I'm going to
try to go down that path.

147
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:40,031
If she brings it up,

148
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:41,310
I'll see if she plays along.

149
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:41,980
If she plays along,

150
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,551
it's like fun.

151
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:45,880
It's like trying to learn more
about this person that I'm fucking,

152
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,241
you know,

153
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:47,800
what's even more disturbing saying,

154
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,320
are you late for school
because that means morning sex.

155
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,550
Like the dad doesn't even have the
excuse of being drunk guy his coffee and

156
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,340
fucks his daughter.

157
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,560
That is God.

158
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,843
Yeah.

159
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,040
Just homework.

160
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:02,500
Yeah.

161
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,640
You need to find better people,

162
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,690
but you know,

163
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,860
you gotta work on yourself,

164
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,510
right?

165
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,000
I know.

166
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,220
Get your own shit in order
and you'll attract people.

167
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,390
I don't make a noise.

168
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,230
I just don't know.

169
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,260
Breathe.

170
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,700
I slobbered in their hair and I

171
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,453
don't do anything.

172
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
I remember just being in awe and there
was a bunch of other comedians that were

173
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:20,951
at the,

174
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:21,280
uh,

175
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,480
east side comedy club member,

176
00:05:22,481 --> 00:05:24,070
east side in Long Island.

177
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,150
Richard Mydomain.

178
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,530
Yep.

179
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:25,961
Richard Miller.

180
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:26,350
Vini.

181
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:27,760
Me and Kevin James.

182
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,010
We're sitting around after
the show and we're shaking.

183
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:30,731
Her head were like,

184
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,181
God damn,

185
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:31,900
he's good.

186
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,710
God dammit.

187
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,040
He apparently did two different
hours on a Friday night.

188
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,800
He did two shows in eight and a 10
to two completely different hours,

189
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,980
completely top to bottom.

190
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,790
And they were like,

191
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,050
both of them were slaughtering his,

192
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,150
just a destroyer,

193
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,140
brilliant writer.

194
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,520
I remember feeling like what he,

195
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,180
he could take premises that you didn't
think there was anything there and you

196
00:05:52,181 --> 00:05:53,920
can turn them into like
one of your favorite bits,

197
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,440
like you did a premise about buying a
corvette and the guy trying to talk them

198
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,940
into all sorts of stuff in the corvette.

199
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,890
And I remember thinking
while he was doing this.

200
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:01,450
Wow,

201
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,020
how is this Guy gonna make this funny?

202
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,291
Yeah.

203
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,770
It's talking about buying an expensive
sports car and he's going to figure out

204
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:08,120
how to make this funny number.

205
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,691
The ref thing.

206
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,310
He did.

207
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,380
I had a bunch of the football,

208
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:10,871
well,

209
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,370
you know,

210
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,680
we have problems seminar.

211
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,950
And it really was because
of him and let's say.

212
00:06:15,951 --> 00:06:19,080
And they couldn't it
because he's dead now.

213
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,600
But what happened was we were getting
different things at the same time,

214
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,110
you know,

215
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,000
like different competitive
with each other.

216
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,810
Well he was competitive with me and I
think because people pitted us against

217
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:32,240
each other purely because
we're short Italians.

218
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:32,731
Well,

219
00:06:32,731 --> 00:06:33,950
I'm a short Italian as well,

220
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,090
but you've never been
anything but supportive.

221
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,973
Nice.

222
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,813
Joseph,

223
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,570
but I mean,

224
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,750
not one time I said to him,

225
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,950
because somebody was struggling.

226
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,201
I said,

227
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:43,460
why don't we go out on the road together?

228
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,001
Oh yeah,

229
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:44,960
we'll fill up theaters.

230
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:45,381
And he goes,

231
00:06:45,381 --> 00:06:46,340
why would I want to do that?

232
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,420
I said,

233
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:47,820
I don't know.

234
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,040
Make money to have fun.

235
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,521
You know,

236
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,930
he didn't understand the concept.

237
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,830
Yeah.

238
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,760
He said to me one time,

239
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:53,040
he goes,

240
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,530
Montreal comedy festival.

241
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:55,970
You think I should go there?

242
00:06:55,971 --> 00:06:56,750
I said,

243
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,330
go with the idea that you're
going to meet beautiful girls.

244
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:01,310
Go to great restaurants and
if you happen to get a deal,

245
00:07:01,311 --> 00:07:02,144
you do,

246
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:02,961
but have fun.

247
00:07:02,961 --> 00:07:03,800
And he was fun.

248
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,461
He looked at me like,

249
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:04,591
what?

250
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:05,424
What do you mean for fun?

251
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,181
This isn't fun.

252
00:07:06,181 --> 00:07:07,014
This just,

253
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,023
he was tortured.

254
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,043
Wow.

255
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,640
He never enjoyed it,

256
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,090
you know?

257
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,080
That's the saddest part of it.

258
00:07:12,081 --> 00:07:15,140
He was seeing never knew how good he
was or he never enjoyed how good he was.

259
00:07:15,230 --> 00:07:16,610
I first met him in Montreal.

260
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:17,450
Yeah.

261
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,460
I first met him in like,

262
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:18,671
well,

263
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:19,870
isn't that where I met you for?

264
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,590
Yup.

265
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,423
Yup.

266
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I met him in 94 just so we were both
passing each other and in the front doors

267
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,531
just said,

268
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:27,980
hi,

269
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,341
hey man,

270
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:28,970
nice to meet you,

271
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,361
blah blah blah,

272
00:07:29,361 --> 00:07:29,511
blah,

273
00:07:29,511 --> 00:07:30,050
blah.

274
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,730
What shows you doing that kind of thing.

275
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,270
Just,

276
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:32,930
you know,

277
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,900
and it seemed to me like he just was a,

278
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,280
just a brilliant,

279
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,400
brilliant mind thinking,

280
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,590
but just always its own
had maybe almost too much.

281
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,820
I saw him on a plane.

282
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:44,654
I was getting.

283
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,950
I was flying back.

284
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,230
Remember they had three cabins and the
American knows in first class he was in

285
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,230
coach with Lenny.

286
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,570
Lenny Clarke.

287
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:52,781
No,

288
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:53,630
law clerk.

289
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,680
Linny Africanus.

290
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:55,514
Lenny Shoultz.

291
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,230
Crazy one.

292
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,770
Crazy one.

293
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:57,921
No,

294
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,754
not that crazy land.

295
00:07:58,970 --> 00:07:59,591
More pigs.

296
00:07:59,591 --> 00:08:00,320
More Shit.

297
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,260
Somebody fucking Lenny's in common.

298
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,070
But what are lenny,

299
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:04,970
you,

300
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,200
Dave Hawthorne's friend.

301
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,063
You wouldn't know them.

302
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,520
Okay.

303
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,130
But anyway,

304
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,420
uh,

305
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,253
he spent like,

306
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,730
I walked back to say hi.

307
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,691
And he goes,

308
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:12,140
you know,

309
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,670
I usually play by myself.

310
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,930
I'm compliant him.

311
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:15,470
I said,

312
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:15,950
it's okay.

313
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,783
I said,

314
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,913
I went,

315
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,351
it's all right.

316
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:18,831
I didn't fly.

317
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,960
ABC flew me and he
didn't like that either.

318
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:21,291
I'm thinking,

319
00:08:21,291 --> 00:08:21,810
I didn't know.

320
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:24,500
Do I have to rub it in and
then I probably said to him,

321
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:24,800
rich,

322
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,633
what do you want me to do?

323
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:26,660
You want my cookie?

324
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,170
I'm just in first class.

325
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,420
Not a big fucking deal.

326
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,530
You guys are so Italian.

327
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,783
That's such an attack.

328
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,990
My is.

329
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,170
Doesn't even have the
good Salami over there.

330
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,431
Fucking Salamis.

331
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:38,360
Get tonight treads.
