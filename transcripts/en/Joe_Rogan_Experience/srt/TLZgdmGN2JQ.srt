1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,020
It's like old school,
Russian

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,190
three to do something I like about the 
fact that you could smoke in here.

3
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:15,110
I liked the people can be relaxed.
I had to find a comedy club to shoot our

4
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:15,944
special word that.

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,600
Where'd you go?
Comedy cellar.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,640
The underground.
The underground.

7
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:22,910
They let you smoke.
Well,

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,753
but I left.
It was just like a rule where if you're 

9
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:31,120
a performer you can get away with 
because it's a part of your routine that

10
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,330
you get like a cabaret old still on the 
books.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,870
To don't take my word for that.
I believe I learned that from dice while

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,470
he was onstage.
Yeah,

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,160
I think you read that in the dice.
Chappelle manual.

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:44,770
Yeah.
Well they can get away with it,

15
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,101
right?
Yeah.

16
00:00:45,101 --> 00:00:47,110
Dave's always smoking on stage.
No,

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,760
I don't.
I don't smoke anymore.

18
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:52,200
But I'll tell you one thing that that 
year in between like,

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,010
well,
you're not allowed to smoke on stage.

20
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:54,844
That was a tough year because he used to
like smoking in the crowd smoke and you 

21
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,440
know,
it was kind of a fun thing.

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,040
A punchline enhancer to Dave.
You do smoke on stage.

23
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:05,890
Not all the time,
like towards the end of it,

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,650
maybe not only that,
but when we were on the road and we'd do

25
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,484
like an hour and a half,
he'll pretend he's getting a phone call 

26
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,720
or something.
Go smoke.

27
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,930
Lead me on stage by myself.
Really?

28
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:16,764
Yeah,
but it gives you a chance to like open 

29
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,590
up a long form bit.
Now you're hearing it,

30
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,424
Joe.
Now you're really hearing the whole 

31
00:01:22,241 --> 00:01:25,810
story behind the bumping mic.
When you behind the bumping Mike,

32
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,800
what do you get out of here?

33
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,550
Smoking onstage.
It just fulfills the nicotine fix.

34
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,770
Or does it actually give you something?
Because they say,

35
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,963
I've smoked a cigarette.
I smoked one at Tony Hinchcliffe 

36
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:36,424
cigarettes a couple of times before I 
went onstage and you get like a pick me 

37
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:41,710
up.
There's a little something.

38
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,270
You get an enhancement.

39
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:44,280
All right,
Jay.

40
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:46,130
I,
I'll say it right now.

41
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:49,200
It definitely is a weakness that like,
you know,

42
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,053
now I don't drink,
don't do anything but like coffee and 

43
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,780
cigarettes.
It's like it's breathing for me,

44
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,000
but a onstage.
It does focus.

45
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,960
It helps focus you.
They

46
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,850
said it's legitimately,
they say new nicotine is actually a good

47
00:02:00,851 --> 00:02:04,630
nootropic yeah.
It actually enhances cognitive function.

48
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:08,950
Like if you do a test without nicotine,
then do a test with nicotine nonusers.

49
00:02:08,951 --> 00:02:09,784
Yeah,
it makes me nauseous if I accidentally 

50
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,430
smoke a blunt and not just straight weed
or tobacco.

51
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:19,090
Like snoop handed me something the other
day and I thought it was all pop,

52
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:21,760
but there was tobacco and those things 
are the shit.

53
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,980
There's a back and deal with it on the 
paper champion.

54
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:28,810
Once you get these,
where were they at this company?

55
00:02:28,811 --> 00:02:32,110
Hollywood's for.
I don't know the stores these days.

56
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,690
These are my favorite.
I'll check them out.

57
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,793
It's a Charlie Murphy got me into these 
things back in the day because he would 

58
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,670
roll them himself.
He would get those swisher sweets and he

59
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:45,480
would tear them apart and then he put 
the weed inside of it and roll it out.

60
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:46,314
Oh yeah.
Old School and then a Chappelle got me 

61
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:50,164
into it again because I smoked one with 
him one day at the back of the comedy 

62
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:54,281
store.
I was like,

63
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,750
damn,
this is a weird high.

64
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,620
What is the like you get a buzz,
it's like you're a little high,

65
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:00,220
but you're also

66
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,950
a little bit buzzy from love from the 
tobacco.

67
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,620
Well,
I want to get my fan,

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,690
whatever it takes to make the jokes fly,
bro.

69
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,320
Whatever they were.
When they made your jacket,

70
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,283
they will smoke a cigarette and I'll 
take like one hit of weed right before 

71
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:23,461
we go on and we meet in the middle.
One hits good one hip before you've gone

72
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,550
too much before?
No,

73
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,950
no,
not in a long,

74
00:03:26,951 --> 00:03:27,461
long,
long,

75
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,550
long time.
You feel like I'd like one more,

76
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:32,950
but Ooh,
that's a dangerous dangerous decision.

77
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:33,843
Yeah.
You want to stay a little quick coffee 

78
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,004
though?
I need coffee before red bull will make 

79
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:39,334
me too like jumpy and nervous,
but coffee will get my brain work and 

80
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:44,320
just a little bit quicker than the 
audiences.

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,850
Did you guys do this one time as a goof 
and then start touring with it?

82
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,270
Or did you just put the idea together?
Like what?

83
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,400
What made you decide to work together 
like this?

84
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,323
You know,
it all started out just late night at 

85
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:58,210
the comedy cellar where,
you know,

86
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:59,044
I'd be on stage and I would just see 
jeff in the room and I would bring them 

87
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:03,120
up and then we would just,
you know,

88
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,770
like throw down basically and have a 
great time.

89
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,880
And we kept doing it and doing it and 
people actually,

90
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,810
you know,
like they wanted to see it.

91
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,480
It became like this Kinda like,
are you guys going to go up together?

92
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:15,370
They would always ask us,
how are you guys going up together?

93
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,530
We would get the next mic go,

94
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,511
you know,
that kind of thing.

95
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:22,430
How it really when I was living in la or
not even when I started,

96
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:24,560
but in the last few years I'd come back 
to New York.

97
00:04:24,561 --> 00:04:28,430
I have an apartment in Greenwich village
near the comedy cellar and you know,

98
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:30,020
it's like cheers.
I mean with knows your name,

99
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:30,854
you,
you land,

100
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,720
you go sort of go into my empty 
apartment.

101
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:33,554
I'll go,
let's see who's at the seller and get 

102
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,460
something to eat.
And I started booking my flights where I

103
00:04:37,461 --> 00:04:40,580
land around midnight day.
When would inevitably have the 1:00

104
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,413
AM spot and I would,
I just wanted to get my yas out and he 

105
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,284
would just bring me up and he'd sit by 
the piano and I would goof off or I'd 

106
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,483
sit by the piano and he would tell jokes
when we started setting each other up 

107
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,923
and it organically,
our friends started popping up with us 

108
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:56,923
or people from the audience or whatever,
Bachelorette party and we just started 

109
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
making an act out of it without even 
realizing it.

110
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:03,710
Yeah.
Wow.

111
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,543
It was like a,
it was a lot of fun like in the 

112
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:08,940
beginning especially because it was 
like,

113
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,460
you know,
he really kept me on my toes.

114
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:13,500
Like listening is like the hardest thing
listening on stage,

115
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,400
you know,
because once you're up there alone,

116
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,330
locked in,
you know,

117
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:20,330
like you control all,
like facets of,

118
00:05:20,331 --> 00:05:21,164
of the performance.
But when there's another president up 

119
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:24,140
there,
especially jeff and I,

120
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:24,974
we have so many different skill sets.
So like it was really cool to work off 

121
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:30,050
of him.
A brought up my game a bit.

122
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,240
It definitely made me quicker and faster
and funnier to have to like,

123
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,560
you know,
really pretty much roll with it,

124
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,291
you know,
and I,

125
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,150
I think that the crowd dug that too.
It was like a different energy than just

126
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,840
straight up like a showcase,
you know,

127
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,083
the one thing that you would do on a 
podcast so you wouldn't normally do on 

128
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:47,174
stage which is look at someone else and 
it took me a long time and I think I 

129
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,983
could

130
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:56,240
a million arguments on looking at each 
other like sports.

131
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,100
If you look at you're

132
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,730
never going to not catch that ball,
but when you're wondering what the other

133
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,200
guy's doing and you're kind of going 
like this,

134
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:04,034
but when I,
it's like w we connect now and instead 

135
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,140
of doing like in tandem one at a time 
jokes,

136
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,340
we do jokes together.

137
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,390
That's how like that's a weird thing.
We're twins,

138
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,440
we're twins will do an act and one guy 
will do the setup and the other guys and

139
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:21,080
then they do a double punch line to 
gather.

140
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,950
We're hoping for that one day to 
coordinated.

141
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,440
I feel like it's one plus one equals 
three.

142
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,590
You know,
two headliners get together by choice,

143
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,550
not by necessity,
but then,

144
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,610
and then Dave,
you know,

145
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,444
I,
I,

146
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,150
it took a lot.
Dave did not want to go to Montreal.

147
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:41,090
We went up to the comedy festival and I 
basically begged him.

148
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,133
Yeah,

149
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,670
do it together.
Yeah.

150
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,504
I just,
I saw it mostly it's just like a fun 

151
00:06:45,681 --> 00:06:47,460
thing to do.
Seller.

152
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,160
Yeah.
Like it was just like a cool,

153
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:50,000
like,
you know,

154
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:50,834
basically like just let it all hang out.
But Jeff saw like I guess the next step 

155
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,094
to it.
So

156
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,450
I always just thought it was something 
that if the comics wanted to see it that

157
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,284
bad and then more and more comics corner
to come on stage with us and then more 

158
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:08,131
and more like Jim Carrey came to one of 
our big shows in Montreal and,

159
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:09,300
and,
and,

160
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,153
and,
and all the headlines are sort of 

161
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:15,160
popping up with us and I thought Oh,
this is more than just us as a hobby.

162
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:17,860
Like this is something that no one else 
is really doing.

163
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,263
Yeah.
I got really into it really quick and I 

164
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:22,720
tried to call it clumping mix and Dave 
was like,

165
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:23,554
no,

166
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,240
it's like it's too on the nose.
That's good for a title.

167
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,270
We don't have any other structure to our
show.

168
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,260
By the way.
We don't rehearse.

169
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,273
He has a flip phone.
I can't even talk to him before the 

170
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:37,750
show.
We don't have any plan.

171
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,880
What's stressful job?
Why do you have a flip phone?

172
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,250
Why?
I'm trying to stay off the grid.

173
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,123
Dude,
you saw me with a sword in front of the 

174
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:46,780
flag.
I'm ready to go.

175
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,310
I'm ready.
I'm ready to be activated.

176
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,691
No,
I'll tell you.

177
00:07:49,691 --> 00:07:52,200
This is the best

178
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,493
title for it.
Jeff is really a good producer and all 

179
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,280
those different things.
All the same skillsets.

180
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,760
I don't have like he's produced 
producer.

181
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:01,330
He know show busy,
all those different things.

182
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,040
But like I was like we should have like 
really like workshops.

183
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:10,130
Some other names like,
like to Castello's looking for an Abbott

184
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Nichols

185
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,370
and May I

186
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,430
teams out there.
I'm not going to say there aren't,

187
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,470
but the thing is that like we're not 
really a team,

188
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,333
like we both have our separate stuff,
but when we get together it's like this 

189
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,390
kind of like almost like,
um,

190
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,360
you know,
like within 48 hours we're a team again,

191
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,010
you know,
it's only really difficult,

192
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,410
but I think we rock out in certain 
situations.

193
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,244
Like I want to go through it with you 
because you've done every venue now 

194
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:36,790
you've an outdoor,
you've done theater,

195
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:37,624
you've done casino.
I think we are one of the best casino 

196
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:40,730
acts I'll say.
Right.

197
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:41,943
I think we really are.
I think at a casino we take it to the 

198
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:47,050
level that needs to be.
Especially in a d level casino.

199
00:08:47,051 --> 00:08:49,570
I'm talking like,
like you're like hoping.

200
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,551
Yeah,
yeah,

201
00:08:50,551 --> 00:08:52,660
exactly.
They're hoping for like a,

202
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,523
you know,
like one of those electric poker thing 

203
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,130
like

204
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,963
that kind of the woods yet.
Well Fox would we do rock the casinos 

205
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:05,470
because I guess they let them smoke my 
people.

206
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:06,843
That's true about casinos,
but it's also a very body audience and 

207
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:11,394
you can say anything.
You don't have to hold back at all and 

208
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,240
you know,
we just fearless.

209
00:09:15,241 --> 00:09:16,300
Um,
I have a filter up,

210
00:09:16,301 --> 00:09:18,430
but he is fearless.
He really has actually been changed.

211
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,890
Is that place in Temecula,
right?

212
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,500
That place is actually nice.
What am I thinking of?

213
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,993
I'm thinking of what's the plan?
What's the fucking place on the five 

214
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,933
playboy one marina.
You sell the hustler because that would 

215
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:35,970
be great if we just do one like that.
Planned Pa.

216
00:09:35,971 --> 00:09:38,070
That's our best one too.
I love that one.

217
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,510
The other one,
it's an old steel mill,

218
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,940
but now it's a casino in deadline.
The,

219
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:44,340
I think it is Bethlehem.
We always have our best shows.

220
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,770
They're so excited.
Man.

221
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,750
First roadshow.
Very.

222
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,893
Yeah.
Those weird road gigs and the one we 

223
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,054
were going to cancel it,
but we never canceled and like Utah or 

224
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,320
something.
Uh,

225
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,590
we did the Oklahoma,
right?

226
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,493
One.
Oklahoma.

227
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,020
Yeah.
You guys did in Oklahoma run.

228
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,163
Well he did.
I did a one casino that I drove through 

229
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,210
like this crazy storms in the next one.
Oklahoma.

230
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,070
Man,
you can drive as fast as you want.

231
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,020
Fuck.
They don't care.

232
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,720
Montana hidden even have dry.
They didn't have no speed limits.

233
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,583
Isn't that cool?
They just had to impose speed limits 

234
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:18,120
within the last decade or two because of
the federal government.

235
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:18,541
They said,
look,

236
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,374
we're not going to fix your fucking 
Rhodes to tell people that can't go 150 

237
00:10:22,051 --> 00:10:23,390
miles an hour.
I love it.

238
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,150
That's a Montana though,
you know,

239
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,920
burst says that Oklahoma's fucking 
amazing.

240
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,020
It was fantastic.
Yeah.

241
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,640
I want to play there for sure.

242
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,730
But I was playing the casinos and then I
met Jeff at this one.

243
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,990
That's like right on the border of Texas
and uh,

244
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,960
you know,
Seinfeld plays there fact Kerrville.

245
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,650
Yeah.
Seinfeld plays there.

246
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,870
Kerrville.
Townson.

247
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,763
Yeah.
And it was like a rough roughly 

248
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,540
Toquerville yeah.
But he's got it down to a science man,

249
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:49,440
you know,
fly in,

250
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,820
fly out,
that kind of thing.

251
00:10:50,821 --> 00:10:51,654
You know,
we're in bed,

252
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:52,923
we're in bed at night,
I guess if you have a nice life in a 

253
00:10:55,771 --> 00:10:56,604
nice house.
But I like going and looking around the 

254
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,970
local places and eating the local fair.
I still kind of love that.

255
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,913
Well,
he's in that weird place to where I 

256
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,750
don't think he can go places.
Yeah,

257
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,290
that's true.
We can't rely on the street.

258
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,150
You're like,
Holy Shit.

259
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,850
It's held.
It's gotta be weird,

260
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:12,923
Joe.
That's what we do at this show because 

261
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,610
we're both a little older now.

262
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,440
We,
we really eat.

263
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,390
That's what we do.
We really enjoy it.

264
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:20,340
What's your like?
Do you like steaks and stuff?

265
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,713
Oh Dude,
you should hang with us because we eat 

266
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,960
cow steaks.
He likes to eat like steak and shit.

267
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,430
Like game of thrones giving kids their 
breakfast.

268
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,460
Kids eat elk.
They really do well.

269
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,730
Well it's delicious.
I wish I,

270
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,110
I need to set up a kitchen here and cook
for you guys.

271
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,040
Oh,
that will be great.

272
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,800
Fucking fantastic.
Kids eat for breakfast.

273
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,520
If you ate it,
you'd want to get it more.

274
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,650
Really.
What does it taste like?

275
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:54,010
Meat scale.
Like a bison like him a little bit

276
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,940
more.
Uh,

277
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,420
unusual.
Better than venison.

278
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,560
Deer.
Venison slowly on a pellet grill.

279
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,480
And then I sear it on the outside of the
end.

280
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,900
Oh yeah.
So your thanksgiving Mr.

281
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,200
out of control.
Well,

282
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:08,961
this year.
No,

283
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:11,020
I'm just here.
We just did the normal Turkey thing,

284
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:12,800
Turkey in a deep.
Uh,

285
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,050
but he caught it with his own hands.
That's true.

286
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:20,080
Roof of the studio.
We did the peanut oil thing.

287
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,990
We deep fried peanut law makes it 
better.

288
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,820
Yeah.
But it's like it's a scam.

289
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,410
How do all this stuff?
He's like,

290
00:12:26,411 --> 00:12:28,420
every time I meet you have like two 
other skills,

291
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:30,310
like how do you do this stuff?
You're pretty busy.

292
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,480
I need things to occupy my brain.
I just have one of those brains.

293
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:35,314
The only way I'm at peace as if I have a
bunch of difficult shit that I do all 

294
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:39,820
the time and constantly challenging 
themselves.

295
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:42,010
I have to.
That's how my brain works.

296
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,590
You know,
everybody has their own weird kink.

297
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,380
Kink is I need to be exhausted just for 
your brain itself.

298
00:12:50,531 --> 00:12:52,920
It needs to be fed.
My brain's needs.

299
00:12:52,921 --> 00:12:55,270
Shit.
Do it needs things to concentrate on.

300
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,363
If I,
if I don't have things to concentrate 

301
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,690
on,
the things that are really difficult.

302
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,090
I uh,
I started playing tricks on myself.

303
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:02,170
I mean,
mental or physical?

304
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:03,220
Both.
Both.

305
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,680
Mental and physical.
Yeah.

306
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,093
I'd have to have both.
How do you handle the time management 

307
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,034
with family and career and get up early.
Get up early this morning I was up at 

308
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,720
6:30
kids.

309
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:16,150
Go to school there.
They're leaving the house by seven.

310
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,640
Take the dog running.
I'm gone for two hours.

311
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,623
Then I come back,
get a bunch of shit done at the house 

312
00:13:21,521 --> 00:13:24,180
then come over here.
Then you know,

313
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,870
hang out with you guys for a few hours.

314
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,520
Then I'm going to lift and then I'm 
going to go to the store and uh,

315
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,813
do couple sets.
I have a good time doing like a 16 hour 

316
00:13:33,491 --> 00:13:34,180
day there.
Right?

317
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,013
Well yeah,
but the thing is like the way it works 

318
00:13:36,461 --> 00:13:39,730
really good with me with families that 
most of the stuff I'm doing either while

319
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,670
my kids are at school or while my kids 
were asleep.

320
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,400
So by the time I leave I have a 10:00
spot at the store.

321
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,130
Dirty asleep.
They'd go to bed at like 8:30.

322
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,740
How old are they now?
The youngest ones are eight and 10.

323
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,310
Oh,
okay.

324
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,143
Yeah.
So it's,

325
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,610
it's a,
they'd go to bed,

326
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,540
get up at like 6:30,
they go to bed at like 8:30.

327
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,140
So that's perfect time for me.
Then you got your own.

328
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,753
When's the last time you just quit?
Something in the middle was like fuck 

329
00:14:06,071 --> 00:14:07,060
it,
I can't figure this out.

330
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,940
Like what?
A bit of a team.

331
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,923
Sometimes bits.
You just got abandoned them and come 

332
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:13,414
back to them and a couple of weeks or a 
couple months or a couple of years 

333
00:14:15,581 --> 00:14:16,414
sometimes.
Yeah.

334
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,810
Everybody has that one like great 
beginning of a bit.

335
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:21,280
And they're like,
where does this go?

336
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,110
And then you just keep throwing it out,
thrown it out,

337
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:23,944
thrown it out.
That's the cool thing with jeff is that 

338
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:26,230
like,
um,

339
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,540
you know,
we both bring material up on stage,

340
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,750
but at the end of the day it's the stuff
that just comes to us like that,

341
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,010
you know,
in the moment stuff,

342
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:35,740
especially with the audience.
That's the stuff that I really think,

343
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,120
uh,
you know,

344
00:14:37,121 --> 00:14:37,954
we should give a shout out to Andrew,
the director of core capturing all that 

345
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,500
Jeff's friend who is now a one of the 
best directors out there.

346
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:45,370
Man,
he really,

347
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,330
uh,
he really,

348
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,193
you know,
once again it was jeff's choice and he 

349
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,860
did the job and then some.
I mean,

350
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:52,010
it's so good the

351
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:53,440
way he put it all together,
you know,

352
00:14:53,441 --> 00:14:54,120
when you guys have,

353
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,400
it's more than just you guys going 
onstage.

354
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,840
There's a bunch of other stuff 
happening.

355
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,270
There's a bunch of people are dropped by
three,

356
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,990
three episode series.
Oh,

357
00:15:01,991 --> 00:15:03,950
really?
Docu series.

358
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:08,750
So I don't know if you saw the jinx on 
Hbo about Robert Durst electrode wires,

359
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,623
that phenomenal documentary.
I heard my buddy Andrew directly 

360
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,883
directed that he also directed capturing
the Freeman's years ago was an Oscar 

361
00:15:17,311 --> 00:15:19,470
nominated documentary.
What was that about?

362
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,543
That was about a family of convicted,
actually child molester math science 

363
00:15:25,861 --> 00:15:27,710
teachers in Long Island.
Oh,

364
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:31,860
father son member.
The based on a short that he did about a

365
00:15:31,861 --> 00:15:36,861
party clown who's family wound up being 
implicated in this crazy controversy.

366
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,101
Oh,
that's right,

367
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,120
that's right.
Oh,

368
00:15:39,121 --> 00:15:39,870
that was him,
Huh?

369
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,770
Yeah.
Wow.

370
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:45,540
Andrew and I are tight and Dave and I 
were sort of going back and forth on who

371
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:46,374
could sort of direct us who had no our 
moves but yet had the experience and 

372
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,470
doesn't like anybody that's too hip.

373
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,060
I just want,
I want,

374
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,330
I like it straight ahead of Andrew.
I liked it straight ahead and I,

375
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,480
and I also think some of these comedy 
specials or over directed,

376
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,140
so I didn't want to fall into this whole
like,

377
00:16:02,141 --> 00:16:04,150
you know,
instead of like lighting the stage,

378
00:16:04,151 --> 00:16:07,100
you guys hold lanterns,
that kind of thing.

379
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
Know bumped lanterns and then we'll 
have,

380
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,750
you know,
like that kind of thing.

381
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,120
Like,
you know,

382
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,780
that'll be the essence of the humor that
could happen to.

383
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,860
Exactly.
So.

384
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,003
But he really,
he really was cool and he really was 

385
00:16:17,651 --> 00:16:21,660
patient and he really brought a lot of 
things outside of my wheelhouse.

386
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,990
You know,
it's a collaboration,

387
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,570
which is another thing you're not used 
to doing when you do your own special,

388
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:26,021
like,
you know,

389
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:26,441
you're like,
Hey,

390
00:16:26,441 --> 00:16:27,274
I want to do it this way.
I've been doing it this way and I want 

391
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,450
it that way,
but we have other voices in the room and

392
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:32,284
uh,
you know,

393
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,640
other ideas.
Then,

394
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,523
you know,
you've got to like pretty much mesh 

395
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,960
together into something that,
you know,

396
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,033
pretty much I guess captured the spirit 
of it and also like hopefully the 

397
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,810
funding of it,
you know,

398
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:44,963
well,
if you've got that guy as your director 

399
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,970
mean,
that's fucking incredible.

400
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,090
It looks cool.
And he also understood our personalities

401
00:16:51,091 --> 00:16:52,700
and our friendship.
You know,

402
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,553
I've been chasing Dave my whole career.
I always just an open mic or I would go 

403
00:16:57,571 --> 00:16:58,970
watch dave or,
you know,

404
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,813
I always thought like,
if no one's gonna make it in our crew 

405
00:17:02,371 --> 00:17:05,100
until Dave makes it.
Dave was always the one that everybody,

406
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,033
even when Ray Romano was popping on TV,
he would call it down to watch Dave 

407
00:17:11,341 --> 00:17:12,320
attell,
you know,

408
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,193
riff and you know,
my first tv spot was a seven hour train 

409
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:20,780
ride with Dave to Canada.
You know,

410
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:23,310
when we were really young and I've heard
three versions of the story.

411
00:17:23,311 --> 00:17:25,020
Joe,
what's the first version?

412
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,780
No,
it's like,

413
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,610
it's like Canada or Syracuse.

414
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,583
No,
it was candidate,

415
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,410
it was,
it was a Hamilton,

416
00:17:32,411 --> 00:17:33,101
Canada,
whatever.

417
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:34,480
We took a train from the.
Anyway,

418
00:17:34,481 --> 00:17:36,940
I'm just saying Hamilton.
It's called.

419
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,310
Isn't that an Ontario?
I guess so,

420
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,070
but uh,
I'm just saying I've been.

421
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,230
Dave.
Dave is my favorite comic.

422
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,420
I didn't know that until we really 
started working together.

423
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:50,940
I consider it consider contemporary 
weird you out and he's like,

424
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,140
you're his favorite comic.
I'm a little bit and know,

425
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:54,993
be honest.
Yeah.

426
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:56,581
But no,
I,

427
00:17:56,581 --> 00:17:59,310
I see,
I see jeff is like beyond unique,

428
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,144
like there's nobody like him and what he
does and what he is able to do is 

429
00:18:03,601 --> 00:18:04,770
really,
it's really,

430
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,960
it's not only fun to watch but it's 
really like,

431
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,190
you know,
you're a self starter.

432
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:11,310
He's a self starter.
Like it's great to see self starters who

433
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,173
find success because it really is 
difficult to like take something and 

434
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:19,050
like make it not only financially 
successful but also like something that,

435
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,330
that we all respect and love,
you know.

436
00:18:21,331 --> 00:18:22,320
And that's,
you know,

437
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,400
I'd say the roasting thing that Jeff 
really pretty much has rebranded into,

438
00:18:26,401 --> 00:18:27,234
like,
you know,

439
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,590
every,
every,

440
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,520
every possible way you can do it is 
always good because he's behind it,

441
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,710
you know,
when it's not,

442
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,700
when it's not really with him,
then you're like,

443
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:37,710
I'm not so sure.
There's other people who are really good

444
00:18:37,711 --> 00:18:39,310
at it too.
But I'm just saying that like,

445
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,373
you know,
that is when we're on the road and 

446
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:46,470
people will scream out the car door.
It's the roast master.

447
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,460
I mean like,
you know,

448
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,730
I had my insomniac time,
but he like 20,

449
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,860
30 times that in terms of like,
recognition.

450
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,750
I mean it's just amazing.
It is.

451
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,320
We're the year.
You're synonymous with roasts.

452
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,250
Yeah.
You know,

453
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,890
people say roast,
they think Jeff Ross,

454
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,070
I earned it because when people laughed 
at me and thought,

455
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:05,240
oh,
that's a dead art.

456
00:19:05,241 --> 00:19:07,130
It's a lost art.
It's antiquated.

457
00:19:07,131 --> 00:19:08,600
It's Corny.
It's old guys.

458
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,250
I stuck by it and said,
no,

459
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,010
it's alternative comedy.
No one's doing it.

460
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,023
I get to,
I get to hang with legends like Buddy 

461
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,260
Hackett and Milton Berle,
you know,

462
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:21,620
and I stuck to it because it was a lot.
There was a,

463
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,710
there was a time where I was like 
embarrassed,

464
00:19:24,711 --> 00:19:25,011
like,
oh,

465
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,960
I'm going to be pigeonholed as the roast
guy.

466
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,700
Were you embarrassed?
Not In my,

467
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,080
I don't know if embarrassed is the right
word,

468
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,390
but uncomfortable.
Yeah,

469
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,480
because you're like,
well,

470
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,970
I want to be more than that.
When was this around?

471
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:38,930
This was probably 10 years ago,
and I was in Vegas,

472
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,250
Chappelle,
again,

473
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,240
words of wisdom.

474
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,140
He's like,
dude,

475
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,483
that's your lane.
Make that a five lane highway and ride 

476
00:19:47,241 --> 00:19:48,074
it.
And that's kind of what we started when 

477
00:19:49,461 --> 00:19:50,294
I started doing sort of really owning it
and loving it and to the credit of the 

478
00:19:54,501 --> 00:19:57,320
world as we became more pussies in the 
world.

479
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:00,740
Like roasting became more and more 
potent and important.

480
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,153
Yeah.
And the world needs to develop thick 

481
00:20:04,431 --> 00:20:07,700
skin and I think roasting honors people 
and it's done with love,

482
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:10,610
but it also kind of toughens us up a 
little bit.

483
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,673
Well,
I think it's of the time when I came 

484
00:20:13,851 --> 00:20:14,684
back to the comedy store,
first thing I came back to watch was 

485
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,260
roast battle.
Yeah.

486
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,020
And uh,
I hadn't really known I'd heard,

487
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:24,560
but I didn't really know where it was.
And I remember that night.

488
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:27,200
I remember that night really well 
because I remember thinking,

489
00:20:27,201 --> 00:20:28,970
Holy Shit,
this is so mean.

490
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,810
It is.
Sometimes I'll be like woke,

491
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,780
you guys go deep,

492
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,100
but really good.
We were at the other club,

493
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:36,970
the Improv.
Sure.

494
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,820
Thanks.
That's a great tobacco though.

495
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,090
I'll take a,
I'll take a real leaf.

496
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:44,250
The leaf,
I can deal with it,

497
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,080
deal with it.
Doesn't have any inside.

498
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:48,100
Is My company going crumble because of 
this.

499
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,100
I'm not going to get audited by NASA.
Pumped him up.

500
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,140
He went down with,
he went back up,

501
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,040
Tesla went down and then it went out.
Really went down six percent.

502
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,903
Then it went up.
Nine studios still smells a little 

503
00:20:59,111 --> 00:21:03,400
Muskie,
but that night when I walked in there,

504
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,470
I remember thinking,
this is a joke writing thing.

505
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,010
This isn't just a simple as um,
the art of the insult.

506
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:09,760
Yeah,
it's,

507
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,540
but it's,
it's,

508
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,373
it's a joke writing and one of the 
things I love about roast battle is how 

509
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:17,200
Moses makes everybody hug at the end of 
it.

510
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,183
It's very cool sort of judging it and 
people were pushing each other and 

511
00:21:23,141 --> 00:21:23,980
screaming at each other.

512
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,090
And I wrote the rules of roast battle,
original material only.

513
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,990
Um,
no physical contact.

514
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,100
Yeah,
that's scary.

515
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,700
And every battle went to the hug.
I've seen that with them.

516
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,810
Rap battles guys punch each other in the
face.

517
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,980
Rap battles also like the way more mean 
version of roast battle.

518
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:44,860
Those fucking guys I've seen some just 
horrible,

519
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,053
horrible shit.
People say to each other and Moses like 

520
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,410
he owns that,
that,

521
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,510
that,
that circus.

522
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:57,280
You've got to admire the fact that he 
can week after week make that work.

523
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,830
One of the reasons why it works,
he's so likable.

524
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,730
Like Brian is such a nice guy.
He's such a,

525
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,100
he's such a good,
good hearted,

526
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:09,280
sweet person.
We were at the Improv that night.

527
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:10,383
You hadn't been at the comedy store and 
years and years and years and years and 

528
00:22:12,401 --> 00:22:13,234
I don't know all the details and it 
never really was part of part of my and 

529
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,133
you were asking me about Roche Pat or 
somebody started asking me about it in 

530
00:22:22,511 --> 00:22:25,720
front of you and I saw you getting 
curious and you get more curious and you

531
00:22:25,721 --> 00:22:27,790
were maybe a little homesick for the 
comedy store.

532
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,560
Who knows?
And I said,

533
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:31,720
come on,
let's go jump in my car and you're like,

534
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:32,554
I'll meet you there.
And you sat up on the balcony where the 

535
00:22:36,251 --> 00:22:39,940
judges sit and you hadn't been in the 
belly room in five years maybe.

536
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,590
Who knows?
Seven,

537
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,713
seven years and you're sitting there and
Moses does a double take and he's too 

538
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,870
afraid.
He doesn't know what to do.

539
00:22:46,871 --> 00:22:48,880
He doesn't really know you.
You haven't been back there,

540
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,253
you haven't been in the store.
And finally I say comedy store legend 

541
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,383
back after a long time,
say hi to Joe wrote real low key intro 

542
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,820
and I've been in that room a lot for 
roast battle.

543
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:01,654
I'd never heard anything like place 
reverberated like I thought we were 

544
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:08,830
going to fall into the main room and it 
was it.

545
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:12,340
That was it you even back everyday since
I had to go back to.

546
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,820
Because Ari was filming his comedy 
central specials tonight.

547
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,210
It's one of the reasons why I had to go 
to Rosebud and I loved him.

548
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,433
I really love them.
There's no way I was going to miss a 

549
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:23,080
special.
I was like a half to go there.

550
00:23:23,081 --> 00:23:25,390
I don't want to go there the night of 
his special.

551
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:29,080
Let me just go there a day early.
So I went there a day early and you,

552
00:23:29,081 --> 00:23:29,914
uh,
you end up judging roast battle on 

553
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,730
comedy central and Dylan.
Oh,

554
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,520
you're part of our,
your,

555
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,393
your royalty over there.
Earl Skakel came out shirtless with a 

556
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,943
gold chain with a code on this day.
That was one of the greatest entrances 

557
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,190
I've ever anybody take

558
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,240
onstage and he fucking murdered.
He was on fire on fire.

559
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:54,863
It's like the art of the insult.
You might not be the strongest 

560
00:23:57,091 --> 00:23:59,640
headlining act,
but if you can put five jokes together,

561
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:01,320
you can take somebody down.

562
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,163
But here's the question,
why is it that so many people excel at 

563
00:24:05,171 --> 00:24:05,710
that,
like,

564
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:06,543
especially young comics,
but they can't seem to figure out a way 

565
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,740
to generate that kind of energy during a
regular set

566
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,270
different?
I think they don't get stage time.

567
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,810
I think that's really what it is.
There's a lot of that for sure that this

568
00:24:17,811 --> 00:24:19,340
is their moment.
So they throw all in.

569
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:22,970
But can I say as an outsider since I 
never was really a west coast,

570
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,740
you know,
comic like you guys,

571
00:24:24,741 --> 00:24:25,574
uh,
is that the comedy store from back in 

572
00:24:27,471 --> 00:24:28,304
the day to before the roast battling to,
to the roast Batak like an amazing 

573
00:24:32,811 --> 00:24:33,644
difference.
I remember walking in there and it was 

574
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:36,320
like,
it was like a haunted house,

575
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:36,921
you know,
you're like,

576
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,450
where is everybody?
What's going on?

577
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:40,040
Sam Kennison played here,
you know,

578
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:40,880
and then like,
you know,

579
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:42,560
you go onstage and it was like,
you know,

580
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,440
12 tourists in the room and then a bunch
of comics in the back.

581
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,780
And then after the rose petal,
I like the energy.

582
00:24:47,781 --> 00:24:51,590
You could just see it just went out like
through the roof of just like it was the

583
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:52,424
place to hang and like it became like 
when you're in town you want to go by 

584
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:58,610
the store and just check it out and like
go on stage and you know,

585
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,743
the crowds there became way better and I
think that you were part of that have 

586
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,260
really helped reenergizing that club

587
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:07,250
hundred percent.
That's what I felt when I went back,

588
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:08,480
I was like,
this is a different place.

589
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,853
Even Lil rel howery said there's no 
other comedy competition where other 

590
00:25:14,391 --> 00:25:15,224
comics come to watch true 100 percent 
cheer on their friends or kind of roll 

591
00:25:19,581 --> 00:25:20,414
their eyes at the ones that they don't 
want to win and there's a fraternity 

592
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:23,714
there.
I feel like comedians and I feel like 

593
00:25:25,611 --> 00:25:29,270
we're a cult in a weird way sometimes I 
feel like I'm a comedian before I'm even

594
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:30,104
an American,
like comedians from all over the world 

595
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,583
and I feel like I know them my whole 
life and roast battle is now 

596
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,290
international.
Yeah,

597
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,313
so that's a great story.
It really is a movement like that where 

598
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:45,350
it was sort of a corny thing that nobody
really understood the roasting.

599
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,710
I couldn't even try out roast jokes when
I first started.

600
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,113
It was like so mean.
If I would stand there with a piece of 

601
00:25:51,441 --> 00:25:53,840
paper and read 10 William Shatner jokes 
people.

602
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,320
You were doing that one night at the 
Improv.

603
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,690
I'm trying to remember who you were 
practicing for.

604
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:07,270
People have the same people that would 
be at the roast.

605
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,543
It'd be dying.
It's hard to put yourself in that roast 

606
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,583
mindset.
Like when you go to see the gross 

607
00:26:12,611 --> 00:26:14,130
mindset,
it's like going to see a fight.

608
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,240
Say if you went to see a fight and you 
knew you're going to go see a fight,

609
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,010
you can handle the fact that the fight 
was going on,

610
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,140
but if you just show up at the movies to
people,

611
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:27,141
start head start.
We can agree to to horrific shit.

612
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,430
If we just know it's going to take place
in advance

613
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,060
as part of that and it,
and it is a sport.

614
00:26:38,061 --> 00:26:40,070
Roasting has 100 percent of a sport.

615
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,150
It's definitely a game because there's 
strategy.

616
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,190
It's not just

617
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,023
jokes,
it's like you're trying to disarm 

618
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:47,994
someone's material towards you.
Maybe like sometimes guys will go at 

619
00:26:51,421 --> 00:26:56,421
themselves first and then go out the 
their opponent like in the same joke,

620
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,040
but they go,
they're already sort of there.

621
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,273
It's very smart.
People are being clever with because 

622
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,210
they've been doing it for a few years 
now,

623
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,970
so they've seen people bomb,
they've seen people murder

624
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:10,340
other strategies like any other sports 
and you punch back and you have your,

625
00:27:10,341 --> 00:27:11,174
you have your a retort ready and you 
know there's all kinds of other little 

626
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:16,620
things like,
you know,

627
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:20,090
maybe don't mention the obvious thing 
till the end and then you're going to.

628
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,990
Sure,
yeah,

629
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,993
yeah.
I don't want to give too many secrets 

630
00:27:23,601 --> 00:27:26,590
away,
but better roast battle battlers.

631
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,110
We'll study the game tape if you will,
and figure all this stuff out.

632
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:32,300
And you know,
five jokes.

633
00:27:32,301 --> 00:27:35,210
I mean it's not easy.
No,

634
00:27:35,211 --> 00:27:37,490
it's not easy.
If you trip or stumble,

635
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,750
can you recover?

636
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,510
Tony Hinchcliffe that goddamn assassin.
If that shit,

637
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:45,920
that motherfucker.
He's an assassin at roasts.

638
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,933
He's got an evil little black spot in 
his heart and he likes to open up 

639
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,390
whenever those roasts come at.
Those jokes are vicious and clean,

640
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,060
tight.

641
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,610
But I,
I've generationally,

642
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,080
it doesn't,
it's not unfortunately do off the top of

643
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,600
our head.
I mean if you can do that also,

644
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,840
but tony takes it seriously and it's 
like,

645
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,650
like I say,
the,

646
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,890
it's an art.
Yes.

647
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:09,743
That's also the skill of joke writing,
which is like in today's world of more 

648
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:15,280
storytelling and all that kind of stuff 
that it's,

649
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,413
it's,
it's few and far between where you 

650
00:28:18,391 --> 00:28:19,224
actually see like someone who can put 
together a couple of jokes in a row and 

651
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:22,051
you're like,
wow,

652
00:28:22,051 --> 00:28:23,330
that was a great run.
You know,

653
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,410
like everybody has one good joke and 
then like,

654
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:26,244
you know,
maybe a couple of tags but like to 

655
00:28:27,721 --> 00:28:30,050
actually have a great run.
You know,

656
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,893
that's the thing that always excites me 
about comedy and when he'll tell you 

657
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,493
like when work together,
he'll go what new stuff they have and 

658
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:39,150
like we'll just throw it up there and 
like I'll try and um,

659
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,120
you know,
basically work it out on stage because I

660
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:44,880
know it's not like one of my own bits,
like a form bit yet.

661
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:47,670
It's like something that I can work with
him and that's fun too.

662
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:48,504
That also like opened your mind to a 
whole other world of like joke writing 

663
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,910
and I'm sure especially you're doing it 
right next to another comic.

664
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,260
Yeah,
we started,

665
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,133
we wrote it is difficult.
We always start by talking about each 

666
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:01,110
other.
They looked like an umpire during a rain

667
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:01,944
delay.
I'm actually wearing the same stuff 

668
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,270
right now,
especially jeff mixes it up a bit.

669
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,820
It's easier for me.
Makes a statement.

670
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,090
Let is a very clear David tail outfit.
This is,

671
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:14,400
it makes a statement.
Flip phone.

672
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:15,180
What?
What's,

673
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,160
what is it?
I know how to delete a hard drive.

674
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,170
I do.
I do.

675
00:29:19,171 --> 00:29:23,220
Creep it up.
Why do you still didn't answer about the

676
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:24,780
flip phone?
Why do you have a flip phone?

677
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,733
Well,
I like the flip phoney like you don't 

678
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:30,060
get distracted with the web because it 
takes forever to get the web on there.

679
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:31,710
But uh,
it's just,

680
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:33,960
I don't know.
I don't really like technology.

681
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:35,640
I don't like the web.
I feel like,

682
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,260
um,
you know,

683
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,183
there's something about the virtual 
experience and the live experience that 

684
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:41,004
like we're,
we're really in that world now of like 

685
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:45,580
coming to see someone live is getting 
harder and harder,

686
00:29:45,581 --> 00:29:48,340
but like they'll know all your clips on 
Youtube,

687
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:50,000
you know?
So I don't know.

688
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,020
I think more people are going to CB 
beloved than ever before.

689
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,070
Well Joe,
not me.

690
00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:00,790
If there's any reason for that at all,
it's definitely not your,

691
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,683
your act because he's got to be content.
It's your lack of connection with the 

692
00:30:05,201 --> 00:30:06,034
Internet.
If you are connected more with the 

693
00:30:07,391 --> 00:30:09,040
Internet,
more people would be going to see you.

694
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,170
I'm not a good promoter.
I know that I ever sent,

695
00:30:11,171 --> 00:30:13,350
believed that 100 percent believe that 
because you're,

696
00:30:13,351 --> 00:30:14,184
you're,
it's hard to talk complimentary about 

697
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,200
someone there.
Right in front of you.

698
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,700
You're,
you're brilliant.

699
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,810
As a joke,
right?

700
00:30:19,811 --> 00:30:20,644
Are you one of the most prolific?
I know one of the most clever that I 

701
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,990
know,
but you're also the.

702
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,390
You have less ego than anyone I've ever 
met in my life.

703
00:30:28,391 --> 00:30:32,830
You're like some weird fucking Tibetan 
monk dude that's been sitting up in some

704
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,040
cave somewhere mean you one of the best 
comics ever in my opinion.

705
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:40,030
You're so.
You're so low key.

706
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:41,680
It freaks people out sometimes.

707
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,291
I,
I,

708
00:30:42,291 --> 00:30:44,710
I'm all about the.
I really love the hang.

709
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:46,930
Like he was saying like the cult of the 
comics,

710
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:48,930
like us hanging in,
like coming from you dude.

711
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,910
That's like extra special.
So thank you.

712
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,490
To get recognized.
I don't like any of that stuff,

713
00:30:54,491 --> 00:30:57,580
but why I think I've,
I think there's a correlation.

714
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,690
You're my own self hate more bandwidth 
for what you're doing.

715
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:04,580
Your stand up,
don't.

716
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,553
You're looking at.
It's a good mixture because you've 

717
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:09,514
obviously you've obviously been really 
successful with like staying in this 

718
00:31:12,761 --> 00:31:15,640
group particularly after you stopped 
drinking and everything.

719
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:19,150
You're,
you're in this tight group present.

720
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,213
That's what I can say.
But you're sat at the Improv that I saw 

721
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:24,340
was about like six months.
We were at the Improv together,

722
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,800
something like that.
Six months.

723
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:27,700
God Damn.
That was funny shit.

724
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,100
But all the fun.

725
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,920
You know,
it's funny like when you talk about like

726
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:31,853
I love,
there's no harder fan now than your 

727
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:36,120
fans.
I mean like they know comedy,

728
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:36,954
they know a lot of things and they 
totally respect the art form and like 

729
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,650
the craft of it and that's thanks to you
and you're out there doing it.

730
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,460
It's not like,
you know,

731
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,450
it's like back in the day I was a comic.
You're out there every night to when you

732
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:51,480
go on the road.
So it's like you're talking from now,

733
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:54,360
now from the past and you get it.
How like,

734
00:31:54,361 --> 00:31:55,420
um,
I,

735
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,323
I feel like the web,
the web stuff helps and hurts comedy to 

736
00:31:59,761 --> 00:32:00,594
some degree,
but it probably helps more than I'm 

737
00:32:02,071 --> 00:32:04,860
giving it credit because it really did 
connect to people.

738
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,250
It really did connect with more people.
You know?

739
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:07,340
I

740
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,173
think it helps or hurts.
I think there's always been shit comedy 

741
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,980
and there's always people that are doing
really well,

742
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:15,950
but there's always been inspiring people
and there's always been thieves.

743
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:19,970
There's always been all the bad things 
that exist now and now it is.

744
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:24,050
It's like way more people can find you 
and those people.

745
00:32:24,051 --> 00:32:24,884
It does translate into clubs and seats 
it they do want to come out and the 

746
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,374
thing about the show,
the reason why this works is because we 

747
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:35,900
can all talk about it in a way that a 
person doesn't do it,

748
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:38,060
can still understand it and then go,
oh,

749
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:39,730
there's these guys like this is what

750
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,720
you could be into.
Whatever the fuck it is.

751
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,210
Rebuilding muscle cars,
playing chess,

752
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,830
whatever the fuck it is that you're 
into.

753
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:49,550
When people get really into something is
a very similar thing that happens.

754
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,103
Will you get together with other people 
that are also really into it and really 

755
00:32:53,361 --> 00:32:54,560
good at it and he'd go,
well,

756
00:32:54,561 --> 00:32:56,260
how are you?
I'm always asking like,

757
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,130
do you write it out?
Like what do you do?

758
00:32:58,131 --> 00:32:58,964
Do you just work it out on stage d?
How much time do you spend alone with 

759
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:04,820
the bit and how much time do you spend?
How much do you love?

760
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,910
Just because a lot of guys don't like to
do anything outside of,

761
00:33:07,911 --> 00:33:08,744
right little tiny bullet points and then
let it all express itself naturally on 

762
00:33:12,451 --> 00:33:13,700
stage.
Some of the best guys ever.

763
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,693
Right.
So it's hard to say what's right or 

764
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:16,310
what's wrong because

765
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,380
there's a lot of work to comedy that 
people don't get which is the writing,

766
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:23,070
but it's also the listening to yourself 
like a taping and listening.

767
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:26,190
That's the thing I have been doing.
I have not been doing lately.

768
00:33:26,191 --> 00:33:29,340
We worked on this thing.
I'm working on other stuff and it's like

769
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,410
data is the thing where when I go back 
and go like,

770
00:33:31,411 --> 00:33:33,720
you know,
when I was really hardcore into the,

771
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,100
into like,
you know,

772
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:35,963
material turning an hour,
that was the thing where it's like you 

773
00:33:38,221 --> 00:33:40,350
almost have to like,
like you telling me you have that tank,

774
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:41,653
that's where like go in there with your 
act like especially like a hard show on 

775
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:44,610
a Friday,
late,

776
00:33:44,610 --> 00:33:45,443
late show and like listen to it.
That to me is like a form of torture to 

777
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,180
like all the bits that don't work late 
on Friday.

778
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:52,350
Right.
I disagree.

779
00:33:52,351 --> 00:33:55,440
I believe he's very optimistic.
I'm very pessimistic.

780
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,310
Optimistic.
We'll.

781
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,090
He really like.
He really is like super optimistic.

782
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,410
Friday,
late shows.

783
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,550
He loves everybody.
I like the active audience.

784
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,583
It fuels me.
I feel like a lion tamer up there and 

785
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,794
when Davis beside me,
I'm indestructable what's probably a 

786
00:34:10,921 --> 00:34:12,140
really good man.

787
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,020
So for people that don't want to be 
quiet to don't want to yell out.

788
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,380
Yeah,
get rowdy and drag people onstage.

789
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,833
We go into the crowd.
We do all those different things that 

790
00:34:21,831 --> 00:34:22,850
like,
you know,

791
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,490
I'll say it,
I'll say it.

792
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:25,324
There's a lot of things that we do are 
like old school comedy in terms of like 

793
00:34:27,531 --> 00:34:30,350
old school hockey,
like it's just no longer done.

794
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:33,440
It's like you could say it's,
it might be a little cheesy,

795
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,820
a little this,
a little of that,

796
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:37,220
but at the end of the day it's just 
inappropriate,

797
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:38,360
fun,
silly.

798
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,850
Like move to the next bit.
Like remember,

799
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:42,380
we were looking into the edit and I go,
hey,

800
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,660
I got to tell you there's like a hundred
punchlines in this thing.

801
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,400
So even if like,
you know,

802
00:34:46,401 --> 00:34:49,310
the law of averages like turtle swimming
into the ocean,

803
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,323
if only like seven or great,
that's still a lot for an upper netflix 

804
00:34:53,241 --> 00:34:53,871
special.
I mean,

805
00:34:53,871 --> 00:34:56,480
honestly I'm not,
I'm not patting ourselves on the back,

806
00:34:56,481 --> 00:34:58,070
but that's pretty good.

807
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,970
Our show is the episodes or three 
episodes of Friday.

808
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,690
Well the first one's called Friday or 
Saturday and Sunday there three nights.

809
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,460
Oh Wow.
And I love that Friday crowd.

810
00:35:08,461 --> 00:35:11,090
And we had like Nikki Glaser,
Amy Schumer,

811
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:12,950
Rachel Feinstein,
Michelle Wolf.

812
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:13,843
You're talking about all the people that
showed because we really like jeff 

813
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,220
called in these amazing people.
Shut up.

814
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,060
Gilbert was hilarious.
Gilbert was,

815
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,610
he completed us.
You know what I'm talking about?

816
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,990
Like he was the third piece of this,
like ancient,

817
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:28,010
like scroll.
Once we found out,

818
00:35:28,011 --> 00:35:29,660
I was like,
where's he been?

819
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,890
Gilbert is the thing.
Because you can give us like,

820
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:36,410
yeah,
that is the best one to savage.

821
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,070
Yeah.
I mean he's.

822
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:40,710
What do you think of Gilbert?
Like if okay,

823
00:35:40,711 --> 00:35:41,544
like your kids or whatever.
Now I'm trying to think of like if you 

824
00:35:44,071 --> 00:35:46,830
were like 16 years old,
what would you think of guilt?

825
00:35:46,831 --> 00:35:48,500
Like he's so out of there,
like,

826
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,270
like wheelhouse in terms of like,
what is that?

827
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,400
I mean I think he's classic.
I think he's like nobody else.

828
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:55,950
Tim,
I think I probably thought he was really

829
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:57,810
funny when I was 16,
when I was 16.

830
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:00,180
I was really getting into standup.
Oh No.

831
00:36:00,181 --> 00:36:03,720
My parents took me to see live in the 
sunset strip when I was 14.

832
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:06,990
I guess it was a movie theater.
When I first discovered Gilbert,

833
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:10,080
he was like on the MTV awards imitating 
dice.

834
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:11,603
So to me he was like not hero comic.
He was the guy that made fun of the 

835
00:36:16,201 --> 00:36:17,070
hero.
Right.

836
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,270
He had the,
you know,

837
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:19,860
he was,
he was always like,

838
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,950
people would talk about him in 
interview.

839
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,900
So it was always revered by other 
comedians.

840
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:26,550
You know,
he's a guy that's always been like,

841
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,740
he's a wild man,
like a legit wild man.

842
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,040
He murdered in our show,
like standing.

843
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:32,883
Oh,
we got a standing o w lately have like 

844
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:35,933
friends from our life in the audience,
my aunt and his family and like Bruce 

845
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,160
Willis is there and he does a bit with 
this,

846
00:36:41,161 --> 00:36:41,994
but I had my friend Craig Moss from high
schools in the audience with his wife 

847
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:46,314
and kids and Dave starts walking around 
the village underground looking for my 

848
00:36:50,401 --> 00:36:51,060
guest list.

849
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,750
Craig Moss,
where's Craig Moss?

850
00:36:52,751 --> 00:36:55,350
So finally,
like they started goofing on,

851
00:36:55,351 --> 00:36:56,184
this guy was just in the audience.
So that was a long jump in and go and I 

852
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,470
jump in and go,
Oh,

853
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,131
you know,
Craig,

854
00:37:02,131 --> 00:37:05,070
when my parents died,
craig was my best friend in a new town.

855
00:37:05,071 --> 00:37:05,530
He was,
you know,

856
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:09,420
so I'm explaining to the audience and 
Dave who this guy is and how much he did

857
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:11,730
for me as a young man.
And uh,

858
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,260
and then Gilbert jumps up out of the 
audience and just screams,

859
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:16,740
doesn't even need a microphone.
He was like,

860
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:20,630
when my parents were alive,
Greg came over and

861
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,050
killed them and says,
perfect timing.

862
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,310
He never,
he does.

863
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,560
He's just his delivery.
He's an animal.

864
00:37:30,561 --> 00:37:33,320
No filter with him.
And that's the beauty of him,

865
00:37:33,321 --> 00:37:33,740
like,
you know,

866
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,501
I'm always like,
ah,

867
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,630
I don't know what,
how they're going to take.

868
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,770
He's like,
boom,

869
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,220
that's it.
I think I'm going to say three times.

870
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:42,980
You know,
the kids who love comedy would love him,

871
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,460
but I was 16.
I mean,

872
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:46,294
I,
I,

873
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,793
I would listen to everything.
I always like a mix of different types 

874
00:37:51,711 --> 00:37:53,300
of comics.
Like that episode,

875
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,283
Bob Saget and Hassan Minhaj or the other
guests at one point were all up there 

876
00:37:57,921 --> 00:37:58,754
together and you,
these are guys who might not even know 

877
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:01,694
each other in real life,
but the comedy kind of brings it 

878
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:05,660
together.
That's awesome.

879
00:38:05,661 --> 00:38:08,990
It's like a party mixed with a roast 
mixed with A.

880
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,510
I don't even know Dave.
No,

881
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,790
it's really cool because Jeff's family,
like wherever we would go on the road,

882
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,030
just family,
you know,

883
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,880
it'd be like,
can I get your comps?

884
00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:17,541
Because I,
you know,

885
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:18,374
I've got like three third cousins.
I didn't know there were Jews in 

886
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:21,734
Oklahoma,
but evidently there were five distinct 

887
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:27,830
23 and me people out there for me.
And I was like,

888
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,050
it was funny to see because I'm really a
lone wolf,

889
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:31,520
like I'm on the road alone,
you know,

890
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:34,460
I go out there,
I do my thing and jeff really does like,

891
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,690
he's very with his family,
so I give him a lot of credit for that.

892
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:38,410
Like,
you know,

893
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,243
they're all invited to come hang out in 
the green room and all that kind of 

894
00:38:42,251 --> 00:38:43,510
stuff.
So that's cool.

895
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:45,400
And he brought that on stage with your 
aunt.

896
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,590
I thought that was like one of the best 
moments of the whole show.

897
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,240
You know,

898
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,730
we bring up my aunt is the first episode
is,

899
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,610
is my aunt Bruce Willis,
Michelle Wolf.

900
00:38:53,611 --> 00:38:54,960
Amy Schumer,
Nikki Glaser,

901
00:38:54,961 --> 00:38:57,600
Rachel.
So it's like a weird mix of.

902
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,663
But you know what for,
for just to say one more thing about 

903
00:39:01,711 --> 00:39:04,860
Dave and the flip phone and like how the
process works.

904
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,290
Dave is also the most,
like you say,

905
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,153
president,
but also informed like he knows all the 

906
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:12,600
references,
he knows what's going on in the world.

907
00:39:12,601 --> 00:39:15,750
So he's not like he's living in a cave 
man under the,

908
00:39:15,751 --> 00:39:17,930
under the eye.
I keep my eye out there.

909
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,830
So what do you do?
Do you read newspapers?

910
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:21,953
I have a raven sent me,
sent me the most important news from 

911
00:39:25,171 --> 00:39:27,760
Westeros isn't,
uh,

912
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,020
by uh,
he's in the back reading and like really

913
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:31,854
like getting in touch with the world and
the audience and he's the first one to 

914
00:39:34,891 --> 00:39:35,611
say,
Oh,

915
00:39:35,611 --> 00:39:37,170
we're in Vegas.
Let's talk about this.

916
00:39:37,171 --> 00:39:39,230
That's going on in Vegas.
Let's talk about that in Vegas.

917
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:39,820
You know,
it.

918
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:40,653
He'll say an unstaged to me.
Like he'll bring up all this relevant 

919
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,000
stuff where like,
I'm the son of a caterer.

920
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:48,270
I'm more about this live experience.
Who's in the audience?

921
00:39:48,271 --> 00:39:49,104
Who is here

922
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:51,760
keeping it to like,
that's that show.

923
00:39:51,761 --> 00:39:53,080
And I think you agree with it.
It's like,

924
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,470
Yo agree with it too is like each show 
is its own thing,

925
00:39:56,471 --> 00:39:57,520
right?
So it's like,

926
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,533
you know,
the fact that it's always like some guy 

927
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:00,580
taping in the back,
you're like,

928
00:40:00,581 --> 00:40:01,870
dude,
why are you doing that?

929
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:03,700
Because this is your experience right 
now.

930
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,500
And you know,
you know,

931
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,700
like Stan Hope,
who is my favorite comic,

932
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,843
Doug Stan hope is like,
he was the first guy that like we both 

933
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:13,960
talked about like this whole thing of 
like why do people think that like,

934
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:17,020
you know,
capturing this show is like important.

935
00:40:17,021 --> 00:40:17,770
And like,
you know,

936
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,570
they're also disposable.
It's like beautiful,

937
00:40:19,571 --> 00:40:20,620
like fireworks,
you know,

938
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:21,630
it's like,
it's never gonna.

939
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,350
It's never gonna happen again.
Like that,

940
00:40:23,351 --> 00:40:25,480
you know,
so you might as well just soak it all in

941
00:40:25,481 --> 00:40:26,620
instead of trying to capture it.

942
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:30,520
And I think when,
when we talk about like topical stuff,

943
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,620
I do that for like as a joke raggedy 
thing,

944
00:40:32,621 --> 00:40:33,454
but also as a,
keeping the act alive because I feel 

945
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,020
like my job in this team is to push it 
forward.

946
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:38,441
Like,
you know,

947
00:40:38,441 --> 00:40:39,610
it's like,
Okay Jeff,

948
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,650
what else is happening?
Like to keep moving it.

949
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,970
Otherwise we can't.
We can always get into a loop of like,

950
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:45,813
you know,
just putting each other down or like 

951
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,510
working the crowd.
So I like to move it forward.

952
00:40:49,511 --> 00:40:51,040
And I think that the,
uh,

953
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,110
the cool thing about that is that like 
it does,

954
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:55,280
it does move forward to an end,
you know,

955
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:56,183
people are making those videos,
they're not making those videos to look 

956
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:01,080
back on them to making those videos so 
that other people could see it.

957
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,240
Right.
But the difference between today and the

958
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,740
past,
are you for that or you are against it?

959
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,410
I'm not,
I'm neither.

960
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,303
I think your,
your personal experience is going to be 

961
00:41:10,321 --> 00:41:13,830
better if you just watch it,
but I'm not,

962
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:15,020
you.
Maybe you,

963
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,893
maybe you just get more of a jolly off 
of filming a clip and putting that clip 

964
00:41:19,681 --> 00:41:21,600
on facebook and they're getting a 
million downloads.

965
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,290
Yeah,

966
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:24,870
I just know that like when I go to a 
place and I'm working on new material,

967
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:28,170
I want it to be figured out and then 
then put it on the way I want it.

968
00:41:28,171 --> 00:41:29,790
But I totally understand what you're 
saying,

969
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:30,624
which is like,
you know,

970
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:31,681
the uh,
you know,

971
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:32,730
like it's,
it's a,

972
00:41:32,731 --> 00:41:34,220
it's an open,
it's an open

973
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:38,690
world now and it's just like the idea of
controlling is like an antiquated idea.

974
00:41:38,691 --> 00:41:41,870
But I think that for me,
at least as the joke writer,

975
00:41:41,871 --> 00:41:42,704
it's like I just want it to where it's 
where it's going to be and then get it 

976
00:41:45,321 --> 00:41:46,190
out.
You understand?

977
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:48,740
They're not going to completely agree.
I think we,

978
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:51,500
if we established an etiquette,
you know,

979
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:54,110
and most comedy clubs say you can't 
film.

980
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,820
There's a reason.
Yeah.

981
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,193
I don't know what,
like I have a bit right now that I'm 

982
00:41:58,461 --> 00:41:59,294
working on and I've only done it twice 
and it's all over the fucking place in 

983
00:42:02,871 --> 00:42:05,300
the.
If I somehow or another released it,

984
00:42:05,301 --> 00:42:08,690
like if I had to do a Netflix special 
tomorrow and it had to do that bit,

985
00:42:08,691 --> 00:42:10,520
I'd be fucked.
I'd be like,

986
00:42:10,521 --> 00:42:15,521
what is this?
This malformed gelatinous preposterous.

987
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,230
Yeah.
You're working on if a joke yet,

988
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:19,070
but sick.

989
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,300
I know for a fact that six months from 
now there's fruit in this.

990
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,293
I know the subject is,
there's something to it to figure out 

991
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:26,624
what that something is and it's gonna 
take a while and it's going to be a lot 

992
00:42:28,401 --> 00:42:29,450
of missteps.
Yeah.

993
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:32,930
There's just no way around it.
And the only way for us to do this,

994
00:42:32,931 --> 00:42:37,430
it's like if you are a musician,
I'm sure it feels awesome to practice in

995
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:40,190
front of a crowd,
but you can practice at home.

996
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:43,730
Like you can actually get the band 
together and play the whole song.

997
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:44,840
Right?
We can't do that.

998
00:42:44,841 --> 00:42:48,320
I'm glad you brought that up because 
people always bring music as like,

999
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:49,790
you know,
it's kind of like music.

1000
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,530
I'm like,
it's Kinda not like music,

1001
00:42:51,531 --> 00:42:53,120
the audience.
It's not like music at all.

1002
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,320
If anything I really,
you know,

1003
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,230
talk about like self hate for a long 
time.

1004
00:42:57,230 --> 00:42:58,320
I'm like,
how come like,

1005
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,310
my bits don't rock like within six 
months.

1006
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:02,280
And I'm like,
you know,

1007
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:06,630
then I started like,
like directors and writers and when I,

1008
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:07,843
everybody has first drafts,
everybody has it and like the best 

1009
00:43:10,371 --> 00:43:11,204
people have multiple drafts and it's the
same thing with a joke where it's like 

1010
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:14,293
it'll work and then it won't work.
And then you'll change a line and then 

1011
00:43:16,641 --> 00:43:18,890
it'll work better and they won't.
And you're feeling it out.

1012
00:43:18,891 --> 00:43:19,724
You're feeling out that you and your 
head are filling in the holes that you 

1013
00:43:22,611 --> 00:43:23,444
only can see because it's,
you're the creator and I love that 

1014
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:28,280
process,
but it also is terrifying.

1015
00:43:28,281 --> 00:43:29,114
You know,
it really is like where is it going to 

1016
00:43:29,601 --> 00:43:31,430
go?
But basically saying,

1017
00:43:31,431 --> 00:43:32,264
okay,
that's finished now because it got like 

1018
00:43:32,961 --> 00:43:33,920
a little laugh.
You're like,

1019
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,370
I'm not satisfied.
There's something.

1020
00:43:35,371 --> 00:43:35,670
Yeah.

1021
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,620
Yeah.
But you have a,

1022
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,040
you have a real issue with this because 
they will get a joke,

1023
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:42,013
you know,
I'm sure he's the creator and he knows 

1024
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,830
where the destroyer are.
Go ahead.

1025
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:51,120
But no one is more connected to him.
Then me watching the process,

1026
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,980
right.
He's on tour and doing like,

1027
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,440
you know,
a week of shows.

1028
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,403
I know,
we know each other's moves and we see 

1029
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:00,270
how it develops.
He'll finally get a joke,

1030
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,020
not where it's killing,
where it's like a showstopper,

1031
00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:04,203
like killing,
like what do we do now where I run 

1032
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:08,094
around a circle,
like the jokes hitting so hard that we 

1033
00:44:10,471 --> 00:44:12,300
have to do something while there are 
laughing,

1034
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,150
you know,
take a sip or some will just roll around

1035
00:44:15,151 --> 00:44:19,460
on the floor and I'll destroy it.
And then the next night I'll go,

1036
00:44:19,830 --> 00:44:21,660
Dave,
what's your workout routine like?

1037
00:44:21,661 --> 00:44:25,530
I'll give him a softball layup to go 
like this joke.

1038
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,573
And he'll look at me like I'm speaking 
another language because I'm already 

1039
00:44:28,771 --> 00:44:31,240
just be like in his eyes.
Fuck you joe.

1040
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm not repeating

1041
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:32,993
myself night today.
And he'll deconstruct and completely 

1042
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,280
rearrange the same joke.
I will.

1043
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,460
I will turn that funny until like a 
boring couch.

1044
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:46,680
Ikea that joke into a snooze fest.
Isn't that so the mindset that keeps you

1045
00:44:46,681 --> 00:44:47,514
present while bit and keeps him present?
It keeps me like I really am letting 

1046
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,210
down the team.
They're like,

1047
00:44:54,211 --> 00:44:54,961
feed me,
feed me.

1048
00:44:54,961 --> 00:44:56,010
And I'm like,
no.

1049
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,030
But,
uh,

1050
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:01,160
I think that's the full of it.
I also like have a problem with it.

1051
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:03,600
If a joke works continuously somewhere,
I'm like,

1052
00:45:03,601 --> 00:45:06,220
there's something wrong with that.
Attacks goes wrong.

1053
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:09,560
Netflix special.
And you're not using your aim material.

1054
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,510
No,
dude,

1055
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,353
I,
I had,

1056
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:12,811
uh,
you know,

1057
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:14,970
I think of the jokes is children.
I gave up a lot of my,

1058
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:15,600
uh,
you know,

1059
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:20,600
my first born there or the ugly ones,
my pharmacist joke,

1060
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:21,473
my homeless joke.
It's because it's so important to have 

1061
00:45:27,301 --> 00:45:29,790
that mindset to be a great club comic.
Right?

1062
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,370
Because the show has to be its own 
thing,

1063
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,683
you know,
that's,

1064
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:35,240
that keeps you like,
restart

1065
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,980
for every show.
There's nothing worse.

1066
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,843
There's nothing worse than seeing 
somebody go over and over and over 

1067
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:41,690
there.
Same thing every year.

1068
00:45:41,691 --> 00:45:42,920
You see them.
It's terrible.

1069
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,690
That's sad.
Well,

1070
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,840
because it could be so much better.
That's what you like as a person who's a

1071
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:49,610
comic.
You understand what they're doing.

1072
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,350
They just don't want to take any 
chances.

1073
00:45:51,351 --> 00:45:53,320
But as a person who's,
you know,

1074
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,383
also you know how good it feels to write
something new and eventually get it to 

1075
00:45:58,431 --> 00:46:02,210
the point where you could say it,
Gilbert Gilbert live this hilarious,

1076
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,340
right?
So like,

1077
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,080
but for years,
like he's gotten out of it now,

1078
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:09,470
but for years he wouldn't update as 
material and I took him,

1079
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,660
my sister and my brother in law and John
Stamos,

1080
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,750
we all went to see him at Caroline's 
when Gilbert's up there.

1081
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,770
Let's just like three years ago doing 
like Calista flockhart

1082
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,320
can you not even update and we're just

1083
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:24,383
dying.
And by the way like stainless is 

1084
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:27,690
criticizing him.
He's like whispering in my ear.

1085
00:46:27,691 --> 00:46:29,490
I heard that five years ago,
I heard that tenure.

1086
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:32,430
I go,
you're on Broadway doing Chicago

1087
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,190
30 or 40 50 year old play,
what are you talking about?

1088
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,820
But.
So I defended Gilbert,

1089
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,020
but I did like I did talk to Gilbert and
Dara and like,

1090
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,100
like Gilbert,
you're too funny to,

1091
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:48,870
to not evolve like your first hitting 
your prime as a comedian.

1092
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,970
And now to his credit he's like on 
another level he's just,

1093
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:53,283
that's great though,
that you've inspired them to start 

1094
00:46:54,221 --> 00:46:55,054
running again.
I embarrassed him to start writing 

1095
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:58,120
again.
That's fucking great.

1096
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,340
But he,

1097
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,710
when he's with us,
like when that thing I said to Jeff,

1098
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:02,850
I go,
if we ever tour again,

1099
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:06,300
we have to bring him on some of these 
cakes because he really does like he was

1100
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,134
the third element of this,
this whatever chemistry of the thing 

1101
00:47:11,731 --> 00:47:12,564
that really did for me at least I always
knew that like if it wasn't going 

1102
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:18,060
anything with me and Jeff and that's the
truth of it too.

1103
00:47:18,061 --> 00:47:19,650
And people will see that in the show 
that there's,

1104
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:20,663
you know,
there's a couple of bits that go 

1105
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:22,704
nowhere,
but we left them in to show people that 

1106
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:25,910
it's real and all that kind of stuff.
But what about getting norm?

1107
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:26,823
Did you guys do anything with Doris?
I wish we could do something with norms 

1108
00:47:28,571 --> 00:47:29,860
kind of thing on Netflix.
Yeah.

1109
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,070
But

1110
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:31,120
he was in the,
in La.

1111
00:47:31,121 --> 00:47:35,910
We were in New York and another dude,
he's so God damn,

1112
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:40,150
I wish you would normally stand up.
I'm not saying we will,

1113
00:47:40,151 --> 00:47:42,460
but if we ever do this again,
this pumping MC state,

1114
00:47:42,461 --> 00:47:45,190
we should get norm.
Did you see his tweets,

1115
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,480
his Thanksgiving tweets?
No.

1116
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,150
No.
Once again,

1117
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,860
on my flip phone friends,
I retweeted it.

1118
00:47:51,250 --> 00:47:52,780
He's just so ridiculous,
man.

1119
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,940
So funny.
There's something about norms,

1120
00:47:54,941 --> 00:47:56,850
just like his ability to,
uh,

1121
00:47:56,890 --> 00:47:58,360
you know,
I have this thing about timing.

1122
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,253
I don't know what you think about it,
but it was like there's something about 

1123
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:02,700
that timing that like,
you know,

1124
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,410
I know in today's world that people 
don't care about that.

1125
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:07,090
It's more about identity and all that 
stuff,

1126
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,680
but like norm is a master of timing.
He really is like a master of timing and

1127
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:14,290
this whole thing that he's trying to do 
is finding these classic jokes.

1128
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,640
I love that.
No,

1129
00:48:15,641 --> 00:48:16,750
he's genius.
He's,

1130
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,250
he's one of the road gigging

1131
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:24,750
opening for norm.
Really probably road gig ever.

1132
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,450
Nineteen 91.
Maybe.

1133
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:33,150
I'm a catch Princeton somehow.
I talked my way into an MC spot and rich

1134
00:48:34,071 --> 00:48:39,071
vos was the middle and norm was normally
normally the only famous for doing a few

1135
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,390
late night shows whatever.
Wasn't Letterman at the time.

1136
00:48:43,391 --> 00:48:44,350
What was the other one?
Uh,

1137
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,890
was it thick of the night or something?
Or Bob Costas?

1138
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:48,760
No,
it was,

1139
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,760
it was a leader with Bob costs.
It wasn't as cool as that.

1140
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:52,594
Even bill boggs,
it was going to give you some some show 

1141
00:48:55,841 --> 00:48:57,280
you'll remember in a few minutes and you
go,

1142
00:48:57,281 --> 00:49:01,510
oh yeah,
like syndicated whatever it was,

1143
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:02,753
but like I meet norm and he's catch 
prints them and he'd do an hour to 45 

1144
00:49:07,871 --> 00:49:12,871
minutes every show.
He either destroyed or he got zero lasts

1145
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:15,670
for 45 minutes and whenever he got zero 
laugh,

1146
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,230
he would stand by the door and say 
goodbye to people as they left.

1147
00:49:20,820 --> 00:49:21,730
Oh,
that's great.

1148
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:22,564
And if he killed,
he would go back up to the room with 

1149
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:27,220
Boston and we would play poker like he 
was.

1150
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:31,830
He was still up for us.
And then while we were there last,

1151
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:35,260
he got booked on Letterman for the first
time and I had a jeep.

1152
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:36,123
My sister bought me a jeep,
but the money she got from a car 

1153
00:49:37,751 --> 00:49:42,010
accident and I drove to norm the best.
Hi Robin.

1154
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,113
And I drove.
I drove norm to his letter taping his 

1155
00:49:46,061 --> 00:49:47,740
first letter.
That's incredible.

1156
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,180
Cool.
I learned a lot that week.

1157
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:53,320
That's what a great guy to have.
The first guy opened for them.

1158
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,150
It was so funny.
That's amazing.

1159
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,810
Todd Barry was so obsessed with norm.
He came out and flipped on my bed.

1160
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,870
First Guy I ever opened for was a guy 
named Warren.

1161
00:50:04,871 --> 00:50:08,500
Mcdonald's is really funny,
like old school veteran Boston comic,

1162
00:50:08,501 --> 00:50:10,660
but the second guy opened for was Lenny 
Clarke.

1163
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:12,333
Atlanta Clark gave me advice that was 
totally contrary to his brother's 

1164
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,150
advice,
but he's Mike Clark,

1165
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:18,410
who's the best,
nicest guy.

1166
00:50:18,411 --> 00:50:19,860
I love Mike.
He helped me.

1167
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,270
He's.
He's fucking awesome.

1168
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,950
My book me back when nobody would book 
me when I was just starting out,

1169
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:28,270
but he

1170
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:30,350
was.
When I opened for lenny goes,

1171
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:31,491
he goes,
kid,

1172
00:50:31,491 --> 00:50:33,740
you have funny,
but you're too fucking dirty.

1173
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,100
He said,
yeah,

1174
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:37,990
you just told me like,
yeah.

1175
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:41,120
He was like,
you should kind of clean your act up,

1176
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,400
and then Lenny Clarke came off stage.
He goes,

1177
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:47,180
whatever you do,
don't clean your act up until them kid.

1178
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,850
He gave me great advice.
That's strong.

1179
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:54,140
Those two guys than Isis there.
So Boston too.

1180
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,230
When I was going to be used into the 
core and when I.

1181
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:02,260
When I was preparing a roast of the 
Boston cops and Mike really helped me,

1182
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:04,814
like warm up,
got me a bunch of local gigs in the 

1183
00:51:07,191 --> 00:51:08,960
Boston flavor.
Oh beautiful.

1184
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:11,120
For the Irish people,
Italian people,

1185
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,100
it's a good place to do comedy,
man.

1186
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,620
That is definitely of the two towns I'm 
thinking right now.

1187
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:18,800
Boston and Philly are the two towns that
have changed dramatically.

1188
00:51:19,070 --> 00:51:21,380
Comedically.
And also just in terms of like,

1189
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:24,650
like when you walk around in Boston now 
you're not like,

1190
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:25,880
Hey,
I'm going to get jumped,

1191
00:51:26,030 --> 00:51:27,470
you know,
because I'm wearing a Yankee,

1192
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,050
you know,
if anything it's like,

1193
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:30,884
you know,
everybody here is so like metro and you 

1194
00:51:32,971 --> 00:51:33,804
know,
someone's gonna invite me to like a 

1195
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,460
poetry reading at a,
at a wine bar or something like that.

1196
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,680
It's very metro and the comedy there was
still good,

1197
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:43,040
but it's funny,
that old Boston was such a challenge.

1198
00:51:43,041 --> 00:51:44,990
It really was like,
especially the outsiders.

1199
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:47,030
What year did you start going,
going into next?

1200
00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:49,590
In their nineties,
you know,

1201
00:51:49,591 --> 00:51:51,530
and every time it dreaded it.
Yeah,

1202
00:51:51,531 --> 00:51:53,030
they really were.
They were,

1203
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,230
they were battles every time

1204
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:57,770
and they had local headliners that could
destroy you.

1205
00:51:57,830 --> 00:51:59,750
The greatest comics ever offstage.

1206
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,860
It was,
it was definitely one of those things.

1207
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,110
You were terrified what you would hear 
just like,

1208
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:05,041
hey,
you know what,

1209
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:08,220
I'm a Giana.
I don't know what to tell you about.

1210
00:52:08,221 --> 00:52:13,221
Um,
Gavin might come down like he just wants

1211
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:14,700
to do a few minutes.
Yeah.

1212
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,130
They would go on stage just to fuck with
you.

1213
00:52:17,131 --> 00:52:18,090
Yeah,
absolutely.

1214
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:19,693
Yeah.
And I,

1215
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,380
back then,
I don't know if it's still like that for

1216
00:52:22,381 --> 00:52:24,600
people starting out,
but comics were me,

1217
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:26,370
but that was their town and they and 
they,

1218
00:52:26,371 --> 00:52:29,430
and they saw you coming into their town 
and they were like,

1219
00:52:29,431 --> 00:52:30,061
you know,
you better,

1220
00:52:30,061 --> 00:52:31,170
you better prove it.
You know,

1221
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:33,470
it's like before step up revolution,
you had a,

1222
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,110
you had to own and never hold grudges.
I don't know why.

1223
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:39,420
I'd never people who were Douchey to me 
in the beginning,

1224
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:40,560
I'm like,
I don't know.

1225
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:41,580
It wasn't ready for your response.

1226
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,080
Respect.
I'll learn it eventually.

1227
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:46,930
That's a great attitude.
But Hackett to that,

1228
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:47,813
to me once,
he said,

1229
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,540
when you're holding a grudge together,
guys out dancing,

1230
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,650
it's a great piece of waste energy.
You know,

1231
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,790
there was a horrible Hackett though 
going on.

1232
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:03,480
What was going on back then was a famine
mentality and I don't think we have that

1233
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:04,314
anymore.
I think that famine mentality is gone 

1234
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:09,660
because now everybody realizes that with
the Internet there's,

1235
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:10,933
there's literally an unlimited amount of
viewers and people that could come to 

1236
00:53:15,181 --> 00:53:20,181
your gigs and it's way more beneficial 
for them to know that you,

1237
00:53:21,690 --> 00:53:24,270
if you're talking about someone that's 
really good for them to know,

1238
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:25,980
you have good.
Like

1239
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:26,671
if Dave says,
oh,

1240
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:27,504
you gotta.
See Jeff Ross is fucking hilarious 

1241
00:53:28,381 --> 00:53:29,310
comedian.
And I go,

1242
00:53:29,311 --> 00:53:30,330
well,
I love Dave,

1243
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,400
so he must be right.
You know what I'm saying?

1244
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:35,640
And this is,
this is,

1245
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,760
this is the not having a famine 
mentality.

1246
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,820
That's the thing that fucked us back in 
the early days,

1247
00:53:41,821 --> 00:53:42,654
like in Boston,
it was before my time because when I 

1248
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:46,620
came along,
they had already started.

1249
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,010
Steven Wright had been on,
was he on Letterman?

1250
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,990
Jay Leno had already taken off and he 
was on Letterman all the time.

1251
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:57,630
Those guys had already broken through to
tv,

1252
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:00,060
but there was a sense that some of them 
had that like,

1253
00:54:00,061 --> 00:54:01,290
where's mine?
Like,

1254
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:02,720
how come I didn't salute?
Yeah,

1255
00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:03,583
there was a tiny amount of slots.
It's not like Steven Wright couldn't go 

1256
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:07,080
on Letterman.
He'd say,

1257
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,820
Hey,
you think I'm funny?

1258
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:11,330
You got to see this Guy Lenny Clarke,
or you gotta.

1259
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,100
See this Guy Don Gavin are you got to 
see Steve Sweeney.

1260
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:17,520
All these murders that he came up with 
and they were all like,

1261
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,890
where's mine?
Like,

1262
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:19,883
what the fuck

1263
00:54:20,770 --> 00:54:23,900
you just like in my head to have too few
spots,

1264
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:28,320
but also like we're of the generation 
and that's not to make this like a whole

1265
00:54:28,321 --> 00:54:29,960
like trip to the museum,
a comedy,

1266
00:54:29,961 --> 00:54:34,730
but we're of the generation where we 
actually saw people who crush a room,

1267
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,110
like crush room.
Like today.

1268
00:54:36,111 --> 00:54:36,531
I was like,
oh,

1269
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:37,400
you killed it.
You crushed it.

1270
00:54:37,401 --> 00:54:39,560
But like seeing Richard Jenny at his 
height,

1271
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,560
like,
hey caroline's,

1272
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,370
or something like that.
Crushed that room.

1273
00:54:43,371 --> 00:54:46,990
People leaving exhausted where it's like
two hours in.

1274
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:47,781
You're like,
oh,

1275
00:54:47,781 --> 00:54:50,720
he hasn't even hit his this thing yet,
and he's like,

1276
00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:51,860
he'll get off the stage.
He's like,

1277
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,120
ah,
what did you think of that tag?

1278
00:54:53,121 --> 00:54:53,810
I'm like,
which?

1279
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:54,441
I'm like,
dude,

1280
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:56,570
you like throw like a million jokes up 
there.

1281
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,730
I would watch that and be like,
oh my God,

1282
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,870
that's terrifying to see.
It was like watching a wave come at you,

1283
00:55:02,871 --> 00:55:06,200
and it was like what people consider now
killing a room or crushing a room.

1284
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:09,260
Like I never got to see Sam Kennison or 
any of those people live,

1285
00:55:09,261 --> 00:55:12,200
but I assume that was the same thing of 
where people could not breed.

1286
00:55:12,201 --> 00:55:13,940
They leave the room,
like just going like,

1287
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,290
Oh man,
I'm just like exhausted.

1288
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:16,213
I got to see Kennison.
But I didn't get to see him until after 

1289
00:55:18,051 --> 00:55:21,710
he released his HBO special and after he
released his hbo special,

1290
00:55:21,711 --> 00:55:22,544
all that material was gone.
Like what I would've wanted to see was 

1291
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:25,903
that because that was like a culmination
of 10 years of doing standup and then 

1292
00:55:29,361 --> 00:55:31,280
boom,
he does that hbo special and it's just,

1293
00:55:31,281 --> 00:55:34,970
I'm a murderous nuclear missile that's.
But I saw him after that.

1294
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:35,863
What year was that?
He did the HBO because I wonder what 

1295
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:42,320
year when I saw,
I think it was either 85 or 86.

1296
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,580
I think it was 86,
so five plummet.

1297
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:49,910
Rascal for the sold out show and I was 
in college and I knew how funny he was.

1298
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:53,540
He was probably already famous old.
Was He at rascals?

1299
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,210
Wouldn't be doing a bigger venue by the 
guests.

1300
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:56,053
You're right,
because I remember it felt like a 

1301
00:55:57,081 --> 00:55:57,950
special event.

1302
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,280
I saw him at theaters.
I saw him at a couple of big places.

1303
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:03,440
I saw him at one place down the Cape.
It was,

1304
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:07,790
I want to say it was like if I had a 
guest today,

1305
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:12,350
I would say somewhere around 2000 seats 
and I saw him at great woods,

1306
00:56:12,351 --> 00:56:13,184
which is considerably larger than that 
and that's right after his hbo special 

1307
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:20,150
and this is 80.
This is 86.

1308
00:56:20,151 --> 00:56:21,380
80 seven.
Wow.

1309
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:24,250
It's like a work of great words.
Did you shut the fuck up?

1310
00:56:24,251 --> 00:56:25,990
I was.
I worked for Wbur,

1311
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:30,130
the the public radio station and I would
record classical music concerts as a.

1312
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,720
As a.
As an engineer.

1313
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:36,030
They called it Tanglewood or something.
What'd they call?

1314
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,710
Great Woods.
You have a great woods and Mansfield.

1315
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,563
Yeah.
Yeah.

1316
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,880
I was a security guard there that have 
been weird.

1317
00:56:42,881 --> 00:56:46,300
If you're better than linkedin.
How did you guys.

1318
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,613
I was reluctant security guard because I
would always bring a Hoodie with me and 

1319
00:56:51,011 --> 00:56:51,844
if shit went down I'd cover up my 
security jacket and get the fuck out of 

1320
00:56:54,251 --> 00:56:56,500
dodge that you'd throw in.
I brought,

1321
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,413
brought a Hoodie with me.
I have to like my first couple of days 

1322
00:56:58,811 --> 00:57:00,850
in the job,
the first day on the job,

1323
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,400
there's a dude named alley cat.
He was a dude who ran the security.

1324
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,710
They caught some drunk kid who stole a 
golf cart,

1325
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:08,050
so they chased him down,
tackled him,

1326
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,500
and he was beating him in the face with 
a walkie talkie.

1327
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:14,800
That was day one and I was like,
oh right.

1328
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:19,810
It's one of these jobs and it was a.
and I'm not a big person.

1329
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:24,190
I'm five foot eight outside the fight 
looking in.

1330
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:26,680
Yes,
exactly.

1331
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:27,543
Right.
So and back then I was competing so I 

1332
00:57:29,921 --> 00:57:31,960
was only like 160 pounds.

1333
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:32,793
I was really lightens,
I was not getting any tangles with some 

1334
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:37,270
big giant drunk dudes.
I'm like,

1335
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:39,460
fuck for 20 bucks an hour or whatever 
I'm getting,

1336
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:40,523
so it just bring a Hoodie with me and 
when Shit went down it would zip up and 

1337
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:47,690
one day shit went down a neil young 
concert and they wow.

1338
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,813
During the Neil Young concert,
the back area is all grass and they 

1339
00:57:51,161 --> 00:57:51,994
started bonfires.
These fucking crazy neil young fans 

1340
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,780
through a bunch of shit on the ground.
Just started fires and then they started

1341
00:57:58,781 --> 00:57:59,614
trying to break up these fires and 
people were pushing security guards and 

1342
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:03,364
then my friend Larry,
who was like the nicest guy in the 

1343
00:58:04,661 --> 00:58:05,494
world,
punch this guy in the stomach and I'm 

1344
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:07,210
like,
okay,

1345
00:58:07,630 --> 00:58:09,640
that's it.
If Larry's punching people,

1346
00:58:09,641 --> 00:58:12,760
like he's the nicest guy,
but like these people are crazy.

1347
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,680
I put the fucking Hoodie on and I'm out.

1348
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:20,350
I just walked straight to my car and 
drove the fuck home.

1349
00:58:20,351 --> 00:58:21,970
I didn't realize paycheck,
nothing.

1350
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,840
I'm like,
I'm out.

1351
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:24,843
Full blown riot.
Two dudes were throwing down and piles 

1352
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:29,560
of people beating the shit out of each 
other.

1353
00:58:29,561 --> 00:58:31,420
There was fires,
they canceled the concert,

1354
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:34,180
they shut the concert in the middle of 
what's happening for Nila.

1355
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,790
Who is the opener?
That was the problem.

1356
00:58:36,791 --> 00:58:37,624
It was the,
it was,

1357
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:38,523
there was two problems sometimes when 
you were in the back area where the 

1358
00:58:41,681 --> 00:58:43,780
grass was,
the acoustics weren't so good.

1359
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,660
So like when people went to see comics 
it was bad.

1360
00:58:46,870 --> 00:58:49,900
It's not good.
Like maybe they fixed the sound,

1361
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:50,734
but back then it was a big issue you had
inside the canopy to hear what the fuck 

1362
00:58:54,581 --> 00:58:55,830
was going on.
What do you think

1363
00:58:55,970 --> 00:58:59,050
a odd ball in like outdoor comedy,
what do you think of that?

1364
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,680
I've done some outdoor things.
I did a big outdoor place in Kansas City

1365
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:05,530
this year and it was really fun.
It was really an awesome.

1366
00:59:05,531 --> 00:59:06,940
Yeah.
But it was a summer night,

1367
00:59:06,941 --> 00:59:08,080
you know,
it was beautiful.

1368
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:10,720
We got lucky with the rain.
There was no rain or anything

1369
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,540
when Jeff and I did,
uh,

1370
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:14,040
the odd ball,
like we went on together.

1371
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:14,993
That was my most fun doing the odd ball 
thing and I always thought it was a 

1372
00:59:16,441 --> 00:59:19,050
great.
Like jeff was a super cool to comics and

1373
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:21,170
everything like that.
Like the only guy I've ever seen,

1374
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,440
like actually looked like he's having a 
great time with Chappelle doing it.

1375
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,900
Like I really like.
He's so comfortable everywhere.

1376
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:28,550
But like in the outdoor venue,
you know,

1377
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,490
he's taking his time and there's a club.
Yeah.

1378
00:59:31,491 --> 00:59:32,120
Like I,
I,

1379
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:36,260
it's just amazing to watch them do it.
But the outdoor thing with the kid never

1380
00:59:36,261 --> 00:59:37,290
here,
you know,

1381
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,710
like the joke going off into outer 
space.

1382
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,900
That definitely is,
is,

1383
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,620
is something that um,
you know,

1384
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,870
even the theater in the round,
which is one I saw Rodney Dangerfield,

1385
00:59:45,871 --> 00:59:48,890
they when I was like 17 and that was 
another situation where this guy is just

1386
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:50,210
like crushing,
crushing,

1387
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:52,940
crushing and the room cannot breathe,
that kind of thing.

1388
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,070
And I was like,
this isn't in the round,

1389
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:55,671
you know?
I was like,

1390
00:59:55,671 --> 00:59:56,451
wow,
that's weird.

1391
00:59:56,451 --> 00:59:57,201
You know,
I was 17.

1392
00:59:57,201 --> 00:59:57,740
I was like,
wow,

1393
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:58,840
is this how it goes?
Like,

1394
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,550
you know,
why is he circling around like that?

1395
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:01,760
Is that,
is that part of it?

1396
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,653
You know,
I didn't understand that it was in the 

1397
01:00:03,621 --> 01:00:04,454
round,
you know,

1398
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,383
but that,
but now I realize that that's another 

1399
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:09,260
like really hard venue to play is the 
round,

1400
01:00:09,290 --> 01:00:09,860
you know?

1401
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,390
Yeah.
I've only done a few of those.

1402
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:12,111
Uh,
did the,

1403
01:00:12,111 --> 01:00:13,640
uh,
that place in Phoenix.

1404
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:15,650
That one's in the round Hollywood 
theater.

1405
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,020
That's a,
that's a great.

1406
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:17,953
Oh,
I know that you did one of his hps was 

1407
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,580
there and because George Carlin did one 
right?

1408
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,630
I think so,
yeah.

1409
01:00:23,930 --> 01:00:26,510
He did so many of them,
like I did them everywhere.

1410
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:30,500
I mean every year that is bananas.
That's one of the craziest places ever.

1411
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,390
And talk about someone who did it 
totally differently.

1412
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,410
He would basically write a monologue.
Right.

1413
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:36,130
You know,
it's,

1414
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:37,580
take us out,
work at it at all,

1415
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,130
not working out,
kind of tightened it up on stage.

1416
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:40,910
They would say,
you know,

1417
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:41,743
as you know,
the bits as you would just keep doing 

1418
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,840
them and figure out a better way to do 
them,

1419
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,300
but write it,
write the whole thing.

1420
01:00:47,301 --> 01:00:48,134
Yeah,
that's right.

1421
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,030
Yeah.
And he did it every year.

1422
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:51,043
Wow.

1423
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,700
That was like at the height of that hbo 
comedy thing,

1424
01:00:53,701 --> 01:00:55,480
you'd like tune in specific just to see

1425
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:56,543
national.
Well he was in a different place than 

1426
01:00:58,651 --> 01:01:03,070
anybody else because of how prolific he 
was and some some would say like,

1427
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,193
yeah,
but some of it wasn't my favorite stuff 

1428
01:01:05,881 --> 01:01:06,714
and like listen,
it is impossible to write an hour every 

1429
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:13,800
fucking year and have it your best 
version of that hour.

1430
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,280
You need more time a lot of the times.
But he had an honor.

1431
01:01:17,281 --> 01:01:19,380
That commitment of getting the special 
right,

1432
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,243
but what he did was he did something 
that was slightly different than comedy 

1433
01:01:23,461 --> 01:01:26,910
either because it was even because it 
was like a lot of it was like a state of

1434
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:29,840
the union,
a state of civilization.

1435
01:01:29,841 --> 01:01:34,841
The state wasn't just comedy.
It's like here's a really wise old guy.

1436
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:36,413
He was super smart but he has some 
really good points and he's going to do 

1437
01:01:39,331 --> 01:01:40,790
this every year.
So it was,

1438
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:42,060
it was,
it was different.

1439
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,520
It was more that it wasn't like he never
worked out in clubs.

1440
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:45,453
Like I went to see him once and he was.
He had this whole bit about fuck 

1441
01:01:48,391 --> 01:01:50,640
everything.
It was like basically fuck this and fuck

1442
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:52,950
that,
and part of it was comedy clubs.

1443
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,060
He's like,
they say,

1444
01:01:54,061 --> 01:01:54,960
George,
you got to work out.

1445
01:01:54,961 --> 01:01:57,090
You're shitting comedy.
He fuck comedy clubs.

1446
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:57,953
Really?

1447
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,460
I saw him years later the store.
I mean it was just fucking around.

1448
01:02:03,180 --> 01:02:04,013
That's when I knew I'd made it.
I was at the Improv back in the day and 

1449
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:10,020
I was probably going on at 2:00
AM and I still have it.

1450
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:14,940
It was a schedule that had George Carlin
going on 30 for like five hours later.

1451
01:02:14,941 --> 01:02:18,900
I went onto the prom show or something,
but Carlin came into the Improv.

1452
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,980
I got to say hi to

1453
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:21,780
him in the back patio.
The store just.

1454
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:23,040
Hi,
how you doing?

1455
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:24,890
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

1456
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:26,130
I was like,
wow.

1457
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,570
I saw him at the Aspen comedy festival 
with comics.

1458
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,510
Oh sorry.
Yeah,

1459
01:02:29,511 --> 01:02:29,871
no,
no,

1460
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,010
he,
he definitely.

1461
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:33,770
So hang on with comics necessarily.
Right?

1462
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,440
I remember once like he kinda like just 
the friars club.

1463
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:39,140
He's like,
I don't want to hang with the older guys

1464
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:40,490
I want to.
It was weird.

1465
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,060
I saw them at the Aspen comedy festival 
and he was like,

1466
01:02:43,061 --> 01:02:44,460
not doing anything,
like,

1467
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,890
you know,
he had like substance stuff going on and

1468
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:50,140
it was like he was treated himself to 
one glass of wine a day,

1469
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:52,690
but you know,
how like up to the brim,

1470
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:55,190
like it's one of those where it's like,
hey,

1471
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,410
you see like sipping on it,
you know,

1472
01:02:57,411 --> 01:02:59,050
like,
and he's looking at me like,

1473
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,430
hmm,
you know,

1474
01:03:00,431 --> 01:03:01,210
like,
he's like,

1475
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:02,080
oh,
he's a new comic.

1476
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:02,740
He's a big,
you know,

1477
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:03,371
I'm like,
hello,

1478
01:03:03,371 --> 01:03:04,450
Mr Carlin.
And he's like,

1479
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,323
hmm.
And back to the sipping on this one 

1480
01:03:06,461 --> 01:03:08,440
glass of wine a day.
I love that.

1481
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,030
Well he,
he,

1482
01:03:10,031 --> 01:03:13,240
he got injured right hand the pain pill 
problem.

1483
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,640
Oh Daddy.
So many fucking people,

1484
01:03:15,641 --> 01:03:18,630
man.
He was a hardcore guy too.

1485
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:19,390
Well,
yeah,

1486
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:22,120
he did a lot of that back in the day.
But I think the uh,

1487
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,900
pain pills was later on in his life and 
he just said,

1488
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,340
reached a point where he realized I've 
got an issue.

1489
01:03:27,341 --> 01:03:29,460
I've got to stop this.
But he,

1490
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:30,313
he,
I respect that he really committed to 

1491
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:32,974
his craft and you know,
maybe he was trying to do other stuff 

1492
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:37,930
here and there because he did a few 
acting things,

1493
01:03:37,931 --> 01:03:41,830
but that was not his thing.
His thing was hbo specials every year.

1494
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:42,560
Well,
no,

1495
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,310
no one else was doing there.
You figure out what your thing is.

1496
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:48,060
Lucky happened.
Yeah.

1497
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:50,380
Well his thing was always,
you know,

1498
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:54,190
having a brilliant social point with 
humor attached to it.

1499
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:55,353
That was his thing.
Like some of his best bits were just 

1500
01:03:58,031 --> 01:03:58,864
like really good points about hypocrisy 
and the ridiculousness of our 

1501
01:04:02,801 --> 01:04:05,950
civilization with like really good 
punchline.

1502
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,870
He would write to a subject.
Does that too.

1503
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,750
He also like a religion.
He was like the first guy to really like

1504
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,170
him and Bill Hicks I always thought were
like,

1505
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,380
you know,
that was so cool.

1506
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:18,060
Their takes on religion,
you know?

1507
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:18,941
Yeah.
Well,

1508
01:04:18,941 --> 01:04:19,774
you know,
Lenny Bruce obviously opened that door 

1509
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,953
that opened the door and it was a pain 
in the ass to get used to Tommy about 

1510
01:04:26,621 --> 01:04:28,300
lenny bruce.
And he was just a pain in the ass.

1511
01:04:28,301 --> 01:04:30,220
They got everybody in trouble all the 
time.

1512
01:04:30,221 --> 01:04:32,360
There'd be cops,
comedy clubs and Shit.

1513
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:36,010
You can't be that guy unless you're a 
pain in the ass.

1514
01:04:36,011 --> 01:04:38,230
I mean,
he was arrested multiple times.

1515
01:04:38,231 --> 01:04:41,240
So what do we have that bad words like?
I like.

1516
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:42,103
Yeah,
yeah.

1517
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:43,363
I think.
I don't think we need a guy like him in 

1518
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:48,310
a sentence like crowded,
difficult guy if you live today,

1519
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,330
right?
You know,

1520
01:04:49,331 --> 01:04:52,330
I mean if he was alive today,
he would just be a great comic.

1521
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,990
He wouldn't,
he wouldn't have to do all the shit that

1522
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:57,850
he had to do.
Like if there was,

1523
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:01,450
it's hard for us to.
Whenever you go back and listen to stuff

1524
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:05,500
like lenny bruce,
it's really almost impossible unless you

1525
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,470
live through it that time yourself in 
that time to put it.

1526
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,350
That's why like I can kind of put myself
back in the eighties.

1527
01:05:11,351 --> 01:05:15,040
I can kind of remember vaguely.
I have a sense of what it was like.

1528
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:17,980
I can kind of tell you,
I don't have goddamn clue as

1529
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,070
to what it was like in the sixties and 
so when he was doing this,

1530
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,770
we have to put it in context that there 
was no,

1531
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:27,160
there was no freedom.
You couldn't say certain words,

1532
01:05:27,161 --> 01:05:29,020
you couldn't talk.
Yeah,

1533
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:30,783
I mean really crazy restrictions on the 
way people talked and they brought him 

1534
01:05:34,571 --> 01:05:37,870
into court over and over and over again.
Essentially bankrupt them.

1535
01:05:38,180 --> 01:05:39,013
He couldn't work anymore and by the end 
he just died of heroin on the fucking 

1536
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:42,994
bathroom floor and then he became a mess
and a lot of him bms was him dealing 

1537
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:48,064
with his court cases like he's got.
There's recordings of him where he's 

1538
01:05:50,141 --> 01:05:50,974
going on stage with his legal papers.
Just reading the diversity of the 

1539
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:55,450
audience.
He lost his fucking mind,

1540
01:05:56,210 --> 01:05:59,180
but we also came up in a club system and
I consider myself a club comic.

1541
01:05:59,181 --> 01:06:00,800
Like that's what I do.
That's what I'm supposed to do.

1542
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,260
But like these guys were before,
like you say,

1543
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,750
Hackett and all these guys way before 
the club system,

1544
01:06:05,751 --> 01:06:08,510
they played the catskills.
They played some,

1545
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:10,430
you know,
a Jewish camp somewhere,

1546
01:06:10,431 --> 01:06:11,264
you know,
they did that kind of thing that was 

1547
01:06:11,931 --> 01:06:12,764
there,
like proving ground and I'm sure that 

1548
01:06:13,731 --> 01:06:17,600
was probably the hardest of the hardest 
gigs to do.

1549
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:18,434
You know,
it's like,

1550
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,210
it's an all ages show.
It's,

1551
01:06:20,211 --> 01:06:21,044
you know,
there may be a late show where they get 

1552
01:06:22,161 --> 01:06:23,730
to be a little saucier,
but you know,

1553
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:26,630
it really is a tough thing and it's the 
same crowd for a whole week.

1554
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,980
I mean honestly,
you know,

1555
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:29,090
that's crazy.
Yeah.

1556
01:06:29,091 --> 01:06:29,924
So like I give it up to those guys like 
Joan rivers who I think also is like an 

1557
01:06:32,841 --> 01:06:35,030
unsung hero comedy.
Like she,

1558
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:36,523
she's like,
crosses over that thing from like TV 

1559
01:06:39,711 --> 01:06:44,030
comedies becomes like a big deal.
Like where you see them on like a Johnny

1560
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:44,830
Carson,
all that kind of stuff.

1561
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,740
Like I love her sets.
I watched them one.

1562
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,010
Yeah,
she really was a great joke writer.

1563
01:06:49,040 --> 01:06:49,830
She was really young.
Savage

1564
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:51,360
to.
She'd go after it.

1565
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,253
Well,
who else stayed relevant and they're at 

1566
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:55,740
80 years old.
Who else had new material at 80?

1567
01:06:55,741 --> 01:06:58,140
No,
but it's really just those two.

1568
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,330
Just Carlin and her.
I guess so,

1569
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:01,223
right?
I mean,

1570
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,273
who else?
And she died trying to improve her 

1571
01:07:04,291 --> 01:07:05,400
voice.
Her instrument,

1572
01:07:05,401 --> 01:07:08,820
like she was still staying in it.
Sad one.

1573
01:07:09,350 --> 01:07:11,190
I was at her funeral.
It was a really amazing.

1574
01:07:11,191 --> 01:07:14,190
It was like a king died.
She was the greatest.

1575
01:07:14,250 --> 01:07:15,083
She had some serious fucking horsepower 
when it came to like her ability to 

1576
01:07:19,531 --> 01:07:23,190
deliver punchlines and one of the best 
books I ever read.

1577
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:24,053
Young comics out there read,
enter talking by Joan rivers about her 

1578
01:07:27,151 --> 01:07:27,984
early days in stand up and acting.
It's really don't read ladies and 

1579
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:35,760
gentlemen,
Lenny Bruce will start putting foil over

1580
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,400
your windows and shooting up.
I,

1581
01:07:38,401 --> 01:07:39,780
I,
I did read that.

1582
01:07:39,781 --> 01:07:40,614
It's a great book.

1583
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:41,523
So I started,
I took a comedy class in New York who 

1584
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:46,410
was teaching Lee Frank,
buddy of mine.

1585
01:07:46,411 --> 01:07:47,244
He's asking his writing and I was fat 
loser living in New Jersey with my 

1586
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,880
grandfather and my buddy said,
hey,

1587
01:07:53,881 --> 01:07:56,070
take this comedy class.
I think you'd be good at it.

1588
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:57,450
I go,
what?

1589
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:58,051
They think,
yeah,

1590
01:07:58,051 --> 01:07:59,400
I think you'd be good at it.
And I thought,

1591
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,593
well,
it's near the bus station where I would 

1592
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:02,513
go to work.
And then go visit my grandpa and take 

1593
01:08:04,231 --> 01:08:05,064
care of him.
He was sick and and I would just go to 

1594
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:11,190
this class for three hours.
It was like a way to socialize really.

1595
01:08:11,191 --> 01:08:14,580
I didn't have a desired.
I didn't even know what stand up was,

1596
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:15,913
but the first assignment was to memorize
a comedian's act and do it just for the 

1597
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:21,464
class.
Just to get a sense of timing and what 

1598
01:08:22,701 --> 01:08:23,534
it was like.

1599
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:26,930
We understood it wasn't our material.
It wasn't about that at all.

1600
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,420
And I didn't.
I had heard Lenny Bruce was the coolest.

1601
01:08:29,421 --> 01:08:31,670
So I went to the springfield public 
library.

1602
01:08:31,671 --> 01:08:34,910
I took out a lenny bruce that live at 
Carnegie Hall Double Album.

1603
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:35,744
I still have it and I remember I had 
this routine and I didn't get it the 

1604
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:44,480
that the class didn't get it.
And I realized like God,

1605
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:46,580
context is everything.
It just didn't make.

1606
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:50,420
It just wasn't funny.
It didn't hold up at all.

1607
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:53,900
It made almost no sense to me.
So I realized that it really is,

1608
01:08:53,901 --> 01:08:55,340
like you were saying before,
Dave,

1609
01:08:55,341 --> 01:08:58,970
like the moment the tide isn't the 
experience of being there.

1610
01:08:59,030 --> 01:08:59,863
People were so restricted back then in 
terms of their access to information in 

1611
01:09:03,201 --> 01:09:06,650
terms of the way they talk to each other
that anything outside of the norm,

1612
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:07,813
anything being broadcast,
and we have to also remember that 

1613
01:09:09,561 --> 01:09:12,390
broadcasting itself was only like 40 or 
50 years old,

1614
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,720
so this is a fairly new medium.
Right,

1615
01:09:15,320 --> 01:09:16,153
and anything that was even remotely just
outside of what the ics excepted 

1616
01:09:23,691 --> 01:09:24,524
standard operating were behaving was was
considered decadent and racy enlists 

1617
01:09:30,260 --> 01:09:31,300
dirty lenny.
They would.

1618
01:09:32,110 --> 01:09:35,030
He would talk about things that you're 
not supposed to talk about that.

1619
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:36,340
Yeah,
the taboo subjects,

1620
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:39,170
but today that same stuff has already 
been.

1621
01:09:39,171 --> 01:09:41,870
He opened the door,
Richard Pryor kicked it down,

1622
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:42,853
lit it on fire.
Eddie Murphy nuclear bombed it and then 

1623
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:47,900
it kept going on Kennison and Hicks and 
it's those.

1624
01:09:48,110 --> 01:09:48,943
There's nothing there anymore.
There is no shame in any of these 

1625
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,920
subjects anymore.

1626
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,740
You can't.
There's no built in weirdness to it that

1627
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:55,574
he experienced back then and he would've
never been able to do comedy any 

1628
01:09:58,851 --> 01:09:59,684
differently.
I think that's also what we need to 

1629
01:10:00,681 --> 01:10:01,514
understand as if like Eddie Murphy went 
back to 1960 and did his same kind of 

1630
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,110
material that he did in Ra,
they wouldn't take,

1631
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:10,850
it wouldn't,
everybody would be like,

1632
01:10:10,910 --> 01:10:13,340
he's yelling at us like,
what is he doing?

1633
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:14,413
This is not comedy.
Like they wouldn't be ready for it 

1634
01:10:16,510 --> 01:10:19,010
there.
There's these stages that have to happen

1635
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:20,053
and I think you kind of have to have a 
guy like lenny who's a spelling it out 

1636
01:10:23,721 --> 01:10:24,554
for people and then a guy like Carlin 
takes it to a different place and then 

1637
01:10:27,241 --> 01:10:28,074
uh,
and then they just keep going and prior 

1638
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:32,780
comes along and introduces this 
incredible honesty to it.

1639
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:33,833
It's like each comic had one less layer 
of exposition in there as almost like 

1640
01:10:38,131 --> 01:10:39,210
they opened for each other

1641
01:10:39,460 --> 01:10:41,620
decade or by five years most.
Right.

1642
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,720
So interesting.
And Kennison,

1643
01:10:43,721 --> 01:10:44,554
when kinison came around,
it was the first time that I'd ever saw 

1644
01:10:46,181 --> 01:10:47,410
something and went,
oh,

1645
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,870
well,
that the comedy can be anything.

1646
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,823
Yeah.
Because I thought that comedy was these 

1647
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,800
guys who would go on the tonight show 
because that's mostly what I'd see where

1648
01:10:55,801 --> 01:10:57,820
they would go to.
You ever notice and they will be talking

1649
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:00,910
about stuff they noticed and I loved it.
I would love standup comedy,

1650
01:11:00,911 --> 01:11:01,744
but I never.
I never thought that standup comedy was 

1651
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:04,533
anything like Kennis.
And when I saw Kenneth for the first 

1652
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,930
time I was like,
oh,

1653
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:08,764
this is a totally different thing.
Like this guy's doing a totally 

1654
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:14,650
different thing.
Like this is crazy.

1655
01:11:14,651 --> 01:11:15,484
He's still going to enter anxious 
monologue when he was standing in front 

1656
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:20,010
of a guy going,
you know,

1657
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:21,830
you look at this face,
you didn't marry.

1658
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:26,070
Look at this stage.
I was married twice.

1659
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:29,500
I was married for two fucking years old.
No,

1660
01:11:29,510 --> 01:11:31,770
but nobody had ever done anything like 
that before.

1661
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:34,050
And I remember thinking at that time 
like,

1662
01:11:34,051 --> 01:11:34,884
wow,
comedy is really fascinating because it 

1663
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:37,800
can be so many different things,

1664
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:41,650
but you also want it to be a rockstar.
So rockstar,

1665
01:11:42,160 --> 01:11:42,993
but that.
But when you see all those great things 

1666
01:11:44,711 --> 01:11:46,420
that he could do,
like his staged craft,

1667
01:11:46,421 --> 01:11:47,980
I guess you would call it,
the things he could do,

1668
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:48,903
he could really hold the stage.
And in today's world where it's pretty 

1669
01:11:50,711 --> 01:11:51,544
much everyone's located,
that's Kinda like the new style of like 

1670
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:57,800
low key whatever like that.
That to me always was like,

1671
01:11:57,930 --> 01:11:59,840
he was like a force of nature.
That's what I was like.

1672
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:00,723
It was like this guy.
Like somebody opened the door in a 

1673
01:12:01,931 --> 01:12:03,310
hurricane came in.
She knows.

1674
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:04,090
I love that.

1675
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:06,730
He has something very seriously in 
common.

1676
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,800
Roseanne,
yeah.

1677
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,700
They both experienced significant head 
injuries at a young age.

1678
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:17,780
From then on became this new person.
Roseann had the exact same story.

1679
01:12:17,781 --> 01:12:20,200
She got hit by a car that she got fucked
up.

1680
01:12:20,201 --> 01:12:22,100
She was in a mental hospital for nine 
months.

1681
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,320
I mean really bad.
So when,

1682
01:12:24,321 --> 01:12:27,130
when people talk about Roseanne and say 
bad things about him,

1683
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:31,270
like you really are doing,
I didn't know that everyone a disservice

1684
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:32,313
by expressing this the way you're doing 
it because you're not even taking into 

1685
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:38,170
consideration everything she does.
You should take into consideration.

1686
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:39,033
She had a significant brain,
a massive trauma to the brain when she 

1687
01:12:43,391 --> 01:12:44,660
was 15 years old,
right.

1688
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:48,100
Her head bounced off of the fender of a 
fucking car.

1689
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:51,010
She was laid out.
She was in a coma.

1690
01:12:51,011 --> 01:12:54,340
She was in a mental institution for nine
months after that.

1691
01:12:54,820 --> 01:12:59,620
Like this is like asking someone who has
broken legs to not limp.

1692
01:12:59,860 --> 01:13:01,700
Even when you are asking.
Even when you.

1693
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:05,430
I heard you talked to her about it.
She almost like skipped over it as if it

1694
01:13:05,431 --> 01:13:07,030
was something she didn't really want to 
address.

1695
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:09,330
And you were like backtracked.
She had I,

1696
01:13:09,700 --> 01:13:13,290
I had to get it out of her because this 
is what I know about her and she,

1697
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:17,530
she knows that I'm a giant fan.
Like she knows.

1698
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,520
I always say if you have to list like 
top 20 comics of all time,

1699
01:13:21,700 --> 01:13:22,533
Roseanne is 100 percent in there and 
probably one of the most important ones 

1700
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,840
because what she did when she first got 
on Hbo,

1701
01:13:28,841 --> 01:13:30,880
when she first,
when people first start,

1702
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:31,780
she would,
first of all,

1703
01:13:31,781 --> 01:13:35,890
she would fucking murder domestic on it.
She would murder and she.

1704
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,750
She had a totally different style.

1705
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,720
Her,
she didn't give a fuck like when she was

1706
01:13:40,721 --> 01:13:41,554
up there as a first time you saw a woman
who was like aggressive and insulting 

1707
01:13:45,371 --> 01:13:48,940
and didn't give a fuck.
Didn't give a fuck what she looked like,

1708
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,610
didn't give a fuck what you thought 
about what she looked like.

1709
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:55,220
She was just there to be funny and she 
knew that I had that,

1710
01:13:55,420 --> 01:13:57,760
that opinion ever when she did the show.
So it helped.

1711
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:58,953
It helped.
Like I'm not trying to hurt you in any 

1712
01:14:00,941 --> 01:14:02,980
way and I just want people to understand
who you are.

1713
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:06,040
She's a fucking bunch of different psych
medicines,

1714
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:06,874
man.
They've got her on all kinds of crazy 

1715
01:14:08,231 --> 01:14:09,064
shit trying to move it around.
And then on top of that she's taken and 

1716
01:14:11,741 --> 01:14:12,574
she's drinking and like everybody relax.
Leave that poor lady alone like you're 

1717
01:14:17,141 --> 01:14:21,040
going after when she's in her sixties 
for a fuck up on twitter.

1718
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,180
You thinks that that lady looks black is
lying.

1719
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:28,990
You're either full of shit.
Like if you didn't know if I said okay,

1720
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:31,780
you don't know anything about her,
what's the ethnicity?

1721
01:14:32,080 --> 01:14:32,701
You'd be like,
Oh,

1722
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:33,570
a boy,
right.

1723
01:14:34,130 --> 01:14:34,620
You know,
I've got,

1724
01:14:34,620 --> 01:14:35,453
I,
I saved the picture on my phone in case 

1725
01:14:36,731 --> 01:14:38,980
I get into conversation with people 
about it because it's such a.

1726
01:14:39,010 --> 01:14:39,843
because it's one of those things where 
nobody wants to look like they are in 

1727
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,400
any way racist,
right?

1728
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:45,860
No one wants to look at their racist.
Right?

1729
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:48,040
I don't want to,
but you also have to be honest,

1730
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,353
doesn't mean you're racist.
If you look at that and go thought that 

1731
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:53,380
was saying that Herman,
she could be a lot of things.

1732
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,930
She could be a lot of things.
She has long,

1733
01:14:55,931 --> 01:14:57,580
straight hair or not long,
short,

1734
01:14:57,610 --> 01:14:59,620
straight hair like she can be a lot of 
things.

1735
01:14:59,621 --> 01:15:01,720
This is not obvious for you.
Say that.

1736
01:15:01,721 --> 01:15:02,554
It's obvious you're being disingenuous.
I can't talk to you because you're not 

1737
01:15:05,321 --> 01:15:07,030
being.
You're not realistic.

1738
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:08,043
This is not obvious.
It shouldn't be tweeting about politics 

1739
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:12,640
and middle of the night on ambient.
Well,

1740
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:15,700
she also shouldn't be tweeting about 
lizard people or any other crazy shit.

1741
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:18,610
She tweets about trails and right

1742
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,533
before her Cheryl,
when she went from comedy to her show 

1743
01:15:21,101 --> 01:15:23,190
and once again it was uh,
you know,

1744
01:15:23,191 --> 01:15:24,024
uh,
like her act was her show and like that 

1745
01:15:27,161 --> 01:15:30,490
was one thing that like since her,
everybody was always like,

1746
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:31,523
you know,
you got to like throw out in your act 

1747
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:36,580
like 20 minutes about like what you are 
and who you think the sitcoms should be.

1748
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:37,563
And it was like,
it didn't work as well for anybody else 

1749
01:15:40,031 --> 01:15:42,040
except for her because that really was 
her life.

1750
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:43,163
And it was her thing like Ray Romano was
another guy was really good at that 

1751
01:15:46,181 --> 01:15:47,560
where he would put up,
you know,

1752
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:49,660
his act.
He's really great joke writer too.

1753
01:15:49,661 --> 01:15:50,494
He was like totally like had these great
jokes about his family and his wife and 

1754
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:57,700
the expectations of their relationship.
And then that became the essence of that

1755
01:15:57,701 --> 01:15:59,800
show so that you see,
like everybody,

1756
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:02,800
you remember that it was definitely a 
decade of like agents going like,

1757
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:03,880
hey,
you gotta get like,

1758
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:04,780
you know,
you know,

1759
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,550
did you have a dog growing up?
Do a joke about that you.

1760
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:09,350
And get a sitcom going on there.

1761
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,373
I went through all that shit when they 
were trying to do sitcoms around people 

1762
01:16:12,631 --> 01:16:13,464
and they would try to get you to put 
together like some sort of a theme and 

1763
01:16:15,451 --> 01:16:16,284
do it on stage for a sitcom.
I'm seeing guys specifically craft and 

1764
01:16:20,101 --> 01:16:22,320
act that they thought was going to get 
12 minutes.

1765
01:16:22,380 --> 01:16:23,340
Yup.
Yes.

1766
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:25,170
People got seriously into it,
man.

1767
01:16:25,171 --> 01:16:27,480
It became like a different thing.
It's like a goal.

1768
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:30,120
The goal was the Sitcom.
The Lachlan was another one.

1769
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:32,550
Did you like those days acting?
I got lucky.

1770
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,020
Okay.
I got super lucky.

1771
01:16:34,021 --> 01:16:36,510
I got super lucky first of all,
I'd never had my own show.

1772
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:38,070
All right.
So never had to carry anything.

1773
01:16:38,280 --> 01:16:40,020
And then two,
I did a really shitty one.

1774
01:16:40,021 --> 01:16:42,360
First a one that should have been really
funny,

1775
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:43,223
but then too many people got involved 
and it got too convoluted and fucked up 

1776
01:16:46,081 --> 01:16:46,914
and it just didn't work.

1777
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:47,843
And that show got canceled.
And then I got lucky that I got on a 

1778
01:16:49,741 --> 01:16:52,100
show that was already.
They already did the pilot,

1779
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:52,953
when I came onto news radio,
Ray Romano was supposed to do the 

1780
01:16:54,931 --> 01:16:57,060
pirate,
the pilot rather he gets fired.

1781
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:58,073
They hired a new guy and then they 
filmed the pilot and then after they 

1782
01:17:00,901 --> 01:17:01,734
filmed the pilot,
they got rid of the new guy and then I 

1783
01:17:03,301 --> 01:17:05,230
came in that.
So there was a,

1784
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:06,323
there was a lot of steps.
So you jumped the hard part of jumped 

1785
01:17:09,651 --> 01:17:12,950
off it and I.
But I mean creatively,

1786
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:15,230
there's no way you found that 
fulfilling.

1787
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:16,363
Maybe at the time of news radio was 
unusually free in how much you could 

1788
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:22,670
create.
You could constantly.

1789
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:28,250
Paul sams is a genius and the nicest guy
in the world and he would let you,

1790
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:30,630
like,
he would just use no ego whatsoever.

1791
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,513
The Best Shit.
Like he would let Dave Foley was 

1792
01:17:33,741 --> 01:17:37,600
constantly rewriting jokes and 
constantly introducing new punchlines.

1793
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:38,300
So he,
he,

1794
01:17:38,300 --> 01:17:39,680
he was like,
you know,

1795
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,673
probably one of,
if you look at all the punchlines that 

1796
01:17:42,421 --> 01:17:44,900
had ever been on the show,
I'll like a percentage of them you would

1797
01:17:44,901 --> 01:17:47,360
attribute to date photo,
like a significant percentage.

1798
01:17:47,410 --> 01:17:48,980
It's genius,
but they would let them do it.

1799
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:49,823
They wanted everybody to do that.
They wanted only job where you want to 

1800
01:17:51,801 --> 01:17:54,790
do more than you're supposed to do and 
you're like mad if he did all that.

1801
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,320
Well,
there was eight people in the show too.

1802
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:58,363
It's a lot of human beings to be talking
for 22 minutes and of course Phil was 

1803
01:18:01,311 --> 01:18:02,690
the star.
Phil Hartman was.

1804
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:05,460
He was so talented.
That guy super talented.

1805
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:09,020
He.
He was also super professional.

1806
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:10,790
I would prepare.
You would have.

1807
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:12,760
He would have a clipboard,
right,

1808
01:18:12,970 --> 01:18:17,970
or a notebook with all of his scenes in 
there with different colors for the tabs

1809
01:18:18,410 --> 01:18:19,800
and he would practice them.
You'd be.

1810
01:18:19,801 --> 01:18:22,490
You'd see him sitting there by himself 
just going over his lines,

1811
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:24,690
moving his head back and then after.
Yeah.

1812
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:27,620
I mean he was a fucking meticulous 
professional.

1813
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:28,783
Like I said,

1814
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,930
I'm just saying.
I'm just saying about like some guys,

1815
01:18:32,990 --> 01:18:34,810
especially the comics where they go and 
they get that,

1816
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,110
that microphone.
Oh,

1817
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:36,944
sorry about the comics.
They get the Sitcom and then they ride 

1818
01:18:40,461 --> 01:18:41,294
it as long as they can and then then 
they go back to stand up and we've seen 

1819
01:18:43,701 --> 01:18:44,390
that,
you know,

1820
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:45,223
you can throw a dart at like a schedule 
anywhere in the country and you'll see 

1821
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,760
that guy and I'm on.
I'm always like,

1822
01:18:49,761 --> 01:18:50,594
you know what?
Isn't it sad that you didn't keep doing 

1823
01:18:52,221 --> 01:18:55,250
the standup because now you're kind of 
right back to where you started in terms

1824
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:56,084
of standup.
Like he didn't get to grow that way 

1825
01:18:57,610 --> 01:18:58,570
apart.
Yeah.

1826
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:02,150
And I don't do it for years and like 
everybody's always like,

1827
01:19:02,151 --> 01:19:02,984
you know,
this is the best touring time when you 

1828
01:19:03,591 --> 01:19:05,690
have a sitcom,
but most people don't want to go on tour

1829
01:19:05,691 --> 01:19:06,470
like that,
you know?

1830
01:19:06,470 --> 01:19:07,610
To me I would be like,
yeah,

1831
01:19:07,611 --> 01:19:08,660
you're right.
Let's get out there.

1832
01:19:08,661 --> 01:19:09,850
You know,
but well you,

1833
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:12,680
you could do it for a few months,
but yeah,

1834
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,320
the schedule

1835
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:16,380
you're filming,
you're going to be stuck at in La.

1836
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:17,423
And then on top of that,
especially back then when you start out 

1837
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:20,874
a sitcom,
you're doing 12 hour days until you 

1838
01:19:22,051 --> 01:19:23,340
figured out how to do it.
True.

1839
01:19:23,490 --> 01:19:26,520
Once the show had been figured out by 
like season three or four,

1840
01:19:26,521 --> 01:19:29,970
we were down to like three days a week,
sometimes four days a week.

1841
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,270
Mostly.
Mostly for very rarely five,

1842
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:38,540
unless there was some significant crazy 
semination make we did 98 I think.

1843
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:41,530
Wow.
We just did three,

1844
01:19:44,020 --> 01:19:45,870
maybe [inaudible] 99,
something like that.

1845
01:19:45,871 --> 01:19:46,530
But,
um,

1846
01:19:46,530 --> 01:19:49,680
I did a hundred and 48 fear factors.
Wow.

1847
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:54,690
Then I did six more than we did when,
when it came back six or seven more.

1848
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:57,640
I think we did seven but 48.
Yeah.

1849
01:19:57,660 --> 01:20:00,150
That was preposterous.
That was when I was losing my mind.

1850
01:20:00,151 --> 01:20:02,130
Wasn't even one a day or was it less 
than.

1851
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:04,560
Well,
no one took three days.

1852
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,800
Sometimes you could bang out one,
two days.

1853
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:11,070
Like you could have the beast on early 
in the day and at night,

1854
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,330
like the final stone at night.

1855
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:16,290
Um,
you know,

1856
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,760
again,
very fortunate.

1857
01:20:17,761 --> 01:20:20,760
It was a great gig.
Plenty of money and it was all good.

1858
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:24,510
It definitely helped my standup because 
it gave me fuck you money too.

1859
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:25,433
It gave me the ability to not worry 
about like having money in the bank 

1860
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,110
because I'm not,
I don't have like extravagant tastes.

1861
01:20:31,111 --> 01:20:31,944
I'm not too ridiculous with money,
but I like feeling like I don't have to 

1862
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:36,414
worry.
Like as soon as you don't have to worry 

1863
01:20:37,201 --> 01:20:37,651
about it.
Okay,

1864
01:20:37,651 --> 01:20:39,180
good.
Don't think about that anymore.

1865
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:40,310
Now think about other things.
So it,

1866
01:20:40,311 --> 01:20:41,144
it really helped me there and also the 
apostrophe of it was a boundless source 

1867
01:20:45,211 --> 01:20:48,120
of material.
We just such a ridiculous show that

1868
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,900
I hosted a spinoff that didn't get 
picked up.

1869
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:53,570
What was it called?
Say uncle her.

1870
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:55,290
Her.
What's his show too?

1871
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:56,493
It wasn't and I was right on the man 
show and that's how I knew David 

1872
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:03,770
Horowitz who was producing fear factor 
and they had a show called say uncle.

1873
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:06,680
They try later paranoid in the De Niro 
movie.

1874
01:21:06,681 --> 01:21:11,030
I wrote the comedian called like stop 
uncle or whatever it was.

1875
01:21:11,210 --> 01:21:12,740
But anyway,
the big,

1876
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:13,783
one of the big things was a guy,
a contestant got in a Turkey pen and we 

1877
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,260
put maple syrup all over when he rolled 
around in these like birds,

1878
01:21:21,261 --> 01:21:23,210
like pecked at him.
And He,

1879
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,193
his family's there watching and he 
starts bleeding and she and I stopped a 

1880
01:21:27,351 --> 01:21:30,350
thing and the producers were mad like,
you can't stop in the middle of like the

1881
01:21:30,351 --> 01:21:34,220
guy's crying.
I go and it was just a total disaster.

1882
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:35,690
You could tell it was going to be a big 
hit,

1883
01:21:35,691 --> 01:21:36,524
but it was risky.
And then I remember going to Jimmy 

1884
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:42,230
Kimmel's like Premiere Party for Jimmy 
Kim alive.

1885
01:21:42,530 --> 01:21:44,480
And uh,
I saw the head of ABC,

1886
01:21:44,481 --> 01:21:45,314
they're a.
and I'd never done this in my entire 

1887
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:48,650
life.
It was like getting a drink.

1888
01:21:48,651 --> 01:21:51,350
And I walked over and I said,
please don't pick it up.

1889
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:54,470
It's rough.
It's going to be,

1890
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:58,610
it's going to be too hard to stand 
behind really torturing people.

1891
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:00,523
Didn't pick it up,
but he just kinda looked at me and 

1892
01:22:02,901 --> 01:22:04,100
smiled.
And there's this,

1893
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:06,320
this would've been 2003.

1894
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:07,903
Yeah,
that was right after fear factor was 

1895
01:22:10,070 --> 01:22:11,490
first launched.
When,

1896
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:12,373
when those shows what happens is you get
used to one thing and so you have to do 

1897
01:22:16,251 --> 01:22:18,650
something that's bigger and better than 
next year.

1898
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:19,753
And so when we came back,
I felt uncomfortable with a lot of the 

1899
01:22:23,001 --> 01:22:23,834
shit they know how to do it,
like these guys are top of the food 

1900
01:22:26,181 --> 01:22:27,080
chain.
They.

1901
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:27,943
But they were doing some sketchy shit.
Like one of them we had these people 

1902
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:32,383
chained to a tree with a bungee cords 
that were attached to a helicopter and 

1903
01:22:37,821 --> 01:22:38,654
they had to figure out the right locks 
to unlock the bungee cord that they're 

1904
01:22:41,801 --> 01:22:44,870
the straps to keep them to the tree.
And then as soon as they do,

1905
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:45,853
they undo the strap and they go fucking 
shooting out into space into the center 

1906
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:55,430
of this giant Canyon and they're 
bouncing underneath this helicopter.

1907
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:58,380
And I remember thinking like,
this does it.

1908
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:01,010
We could do this a thousand times.
One of them,

1909
01:23:01,011 --> 01:23:02,990
someone's going to die.
Of course one of them,

1910
01:23:02,991 --> 01:23:04,690
someone's going to die and it might be 
the next one.

1911
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,610
It never.
We got lucky dude.

1912
01:23:06,611 --> 01:23:08,440
I really feel like we got lucky.
I really,

1913
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:11,770
really honestly,
100 percent feel like we got lucky.

1914
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:13,960
There was a few things.
First of all,

1915
01:23:14,250 --> 01:23:15,083
there's a certain amount of risk that 
you take whenever you're doing anything 

1916
01:23:16,481 --> 01:23:18,610
like jump your car off of a building 
roof,

1917
01:23:18,611 --> 01:23:22,510
which we did.
We had people fly cars across a train,

1918
01:23:22,511 --> 01:23:23,890
a moving train.
Okay.

1919
01:23:23,891 --> 01:23:25,690
There's risk involved in that.
Right?

1920
01:23:26,050 --> 01:23:28,810
But the one that scared the shit out of 
me the most was bull riding.

1921
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:29,913
We had people ride bulls.
I was the only time I had told 

1922
01:23:31,241 --> 01:23:32,410
contestants,
don't do it.

1923
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,161
I'm like,
if you,

1924
01:23:33,161 --> 01:23:35,650
if you want to ask me,
I would say don't do it on air.

1925
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:36,850
No,
no,

1926
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:37,271
no,
no.

1927
01:23:37,271 --> 01:23:40,750
Before we go on air.
I mean I gave them the standard,

1928
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:43,930
but when I would talk to them I'd say,
look,

1929
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,030
it's up to you,
right?

1930
01:23:46,031 --> 01:23:48,220
I mean if you want to go on me,
people do know how to ride bulls,

1931
01:23:48,221 --> 01:23:49,054
but you don't know how to ride a bull.
We're not teaching you how to ride a 

1932
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:52,180
bull.
You're not going through classes.

1933
01:23:52,181 --> 01:23:53,014
You don't have to.
Slowly but surely building up your 

1934
01:23:54,941 --> 01:23:57,130
techniques.
You're just going to go ride a bull.

1935
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,650
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

1936
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:01,510
That's what I would say.
And we had this girl,

1937
01:24:01,511 --> 01:24:02,344
she was like 98 pounds.
She got launched off the back of this 

1938
01:24:04,151 --> 01:24:04,984
bowl and she'll do this.
These people went fucking flying that 

1939
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:11,540
things kicking fall.
Bear.

1940
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:14,020
Yeah.
Barely misses them when it's kicking.

1941
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:15,730
I mean they're wearing helmets and shit.
But look at this.

1942
01:24:15,730 --> 01:24:16,670
Look at this,
look at it.

1943
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:17,710
I mean,
come on man.

1944
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:20,590
Look at this.
I mean that's,

1945
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:23,350
that fall.
The way she felt like that.

1946
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,320
That is like getting hit in the back of 
the head with the world.

1947
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:27,253
Yeah.
So like my personal feelings about 

1948
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:32,920
trauma and about what's dangerous and 
shit like this.

1949
01:24:32,921 --> 01:24:35,230
This is a no,
no.

1950
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:38,410
Especially for a 90 pound woman.
Like this poor lady.

1951
01:24:38,590 --> 01:24:40,720
Oh my goodness.
You got up cute little fellow.

1952
01:24:40,721 --> 01:24:42,190
I was back then.
Yeah,

1953
01:24:42,191 --> 01:24:42,941
she got up,
man.

1954
01:24:42,941 --> 01:24:44,500
She was tough as shit.
But everybody.

1955
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:47,110
I feel like in that one I feel like we 
got lucky.

1956
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:50,350
I feel like we've rolled the dice 
because if they stop you,

1957
01:24:50,510 --> 01:24:52,670
they,
they lacerate livers and crushed.

1958
01:24:53,210 --> 01:24:55,690
Crushed.
They can stump you.

1959
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:59,590
The funny thing was those stunk.
Guys are so fucking tough.

1960
01:25:00,010 --> 01:25:00,843
Those guys are so used to putting their 
ass on the line that they don't think 

1961
01:25:03,941 --> 01:25:07,210
anything about someone doing something 
risky to them.

1962
01:25:07,211 --> 01:25:09,610
That's what you do.
You show up for work and

1963
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:12,990
that's definitely a different in your 
head like Alpha something.

1964
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:16,450
Animals have to do that to be a fight,
to crave that.

1965
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:21,610
Like a wonder what the family's saying.
Does it keep them from having a family?

1966
01:25:21,611 --> 01:25:22,444
There's a wall.
Who's going to marry you if you're 

1967
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:27,910
throwing your life in the line unrelated
to war or famine.

1968
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,540
I think there's a certain allure to 
remember that TV show.

1969
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:34,000
The fall guy.
How about evil knievel?

1970
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,190
Women loved him.
Women loved evil knievel.

1971
01:25:36,191 --> 01:25:38,320
If that's a good point.
We may love risk takers.

1972
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:39,154
They like bmx,
guys that do those flips and shit and 

1973
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:42,243
those guys or those guys really shit.
And now they have the park core guys 

1974
01:25:45,371 --> 01:25:47,440
were there,
like climb up a building with no.

1975
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:48,221
Any,
any,

1976
01:25:48,221 --> 01:25:49,300
uh,
any kind of.

1977
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:55,090
So you could smoke.
You could do park Parkour on a iron iron

1978
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:56,710
grid.
Do you exercise at all day?

1979
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:58,210
I do the kettlebells,
yeah.

1980
01:25:58,211 --> 01:25:59,980
You were telling me that.
I'm still doing that.

1981
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:01,540
I can I,
you know,

1982
01:26:01,550 --> 01:26:03,990
because I wanted to ask you this off.
The microphone

1983
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:06,610
is like I seem to be getting more out of
pull ups and,

1984
01:26:06,650 --> 01:26:09,120
and just regular calisthenics and am out
of the,

1985
01:26:09,250 --> 01:26:12,350
out of the Kettlebell experience.
I think it's because like maybe I'm just

1986
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:13,550
more into it now,
you know.

1987
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:14,633
Well there's definitely no better 
exercise for you then pull ups and push 

1988
01:26:18,001 --> 01:26:19,990
ups.
That to me is if I,

1989
01:26:20,240 --> 01:26:21,780
if somebody had to save for the rest of 
your life,

1990
01:26:21,990 --> 01:26:24,540
you gotta pull up bar and no weights.
Yeah.

1991
01:26:24,630 --> 01:26:26,220
You know you're going to be okay.
I'd be like,

1992
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:29,310
I'll take that over.
Not having a pull up bar because I think

1993
01:26:29,340 --> 01:26:30,173
there's certain amount.
There's certain kinds of workouts when 

1994
01:26:32,671 --> 01:26:35,710
you manipulate your own body to pushups.
I think too,

1995
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:36,683
because you could vary your pushup 
widths and you could do so many things 

1996
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:41,430
just with Chin ups and pushups and then 
with bodyweight,

1997
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:43,710
like single leg squats and things like 
that,

1998
01:26:43,711 --> 01:26:46,770
you can get a tremendous workout in with
just a chin up bar.

1999
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:47,793
Yeah.
Body weight and then there's something 

2000
01:26:49,901 --> 01:26:51,820
about like that.
Do 100 of them,

2001
01:26:51,821 --> 01:26:54,400
like I can't even do like 10,
like 10 would be great for me.

2002
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:57,520
But like the guys who can do 100,
it's so hard.

2003
01:26:57,521 --> 01:27:00,160
It's almost like torture to do ups.
Chin ups.

2004
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,800
You can do 100 chin ups is a fucking 
sap.

2005
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:03,550
Yeah.
Like I,

2006
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:05,440
I,
I mean that definitely is the goal.

2007
01:27:06,990 --> 01:27:07,350
Do.
Um,

2008
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:10,500
I'll do 100 in two sets.
Yeah.

2009
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:11,443
I don't do it though.
I do sets of 10 and I don't do any more 

2010
01:27:14,461 --> 01:27:17,190
than 10 and I do them multiple times a 
day.

2011
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:18,173
Like I have a chin up bar in my house so
I'll walk in and I'll just jump up and 

2012
01:27:20,931 --> 01:27:21,764
do 10,
10 and I've found that like the one 

2013
01:27:23,941 --> 01:27:24,774
thing that's helped my squeeze with 
Jujitsu and with being able to pick my 

2014
01:27:28,381 --> 01:27:30,360
body and just move around better.
It's just,

2015
01:27:30,361 --> 01:27:32,550
just do them randomly throughout the 
day.

2016
01:27:32,551 --> 01:27:34,820
I do chin ups all the time,
like whenever,

2017
01:27:34,850 --> 01:27:35,683
like those bars in the back,
I'll do a show here and then I'll go 

2018
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:39,380
back and do tension.

2019
01:27:39,470 --> 01:27:43,900
I'm like that with masturbation so I can
have sex any time you're ready to go,

2020
01:27:43,970 --> 01:27:45,130
ready to go.
But

2021
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:46,403
if I had to pick one thing,
it would be that it'd be a chin up bar 

2022
01:27:48,121 --> 01:27:50,850
and then bodyweight stuff,
you could do that for sure.

2023
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:52,290
That's not into the kettle bells

2024
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:53,290
on the,
on the road.

2025
01:27:53,300 --> 01:27:54,750
It's hard to do,
you know,

2026
01:27:54,760 --> 01:27:57,400
like I don't like go into the hotel gym 
or anything like that.

2027
01:27:57,401 --> 01:27:58,234
I like to keep it in the room so 
sometimes you jump rope or something 

2028
01:28:01,061 --> 01:28:01,894
like that.
But I would say I've gotten in better 

2029
01:28:03,851 --> 01:28:05,740
shape,
but I still feel like,

2030
01:28:05,741 --> 01:28:06,670
you know,
um,

2031
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:08,230
you know,
crap most of the time.

2032
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:10,870
But uh,
when I was a kid when I was a kid,

2033
01:28:10,871 --> 01:28:13,630
like it was all that stuff like pushups 
and sit ups and all that kind of stuff.

2034
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:15,070
And now that I'm back to it,
I'm like,

2035
01:28:15,071 --> 01:28:16,750
you know,
I forgot how great this is.

2036
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:17,710
You know,
it's really cool.

2037
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:18,573
You know,
what's a great thing for the pull ups 

2038
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,210
afterwards?
Those trx things.

2039
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,440
Oh yes.
Now my trainer was

2040
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:26,013
to the door of the hotel room and you 
could do all these crazy exercises and 

2041
01:28:29,331 --> 01:28:31,720
it's real small.
You can just tuck it in your bag.

2042
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:33,730
I love that.
I love the hotel room.

2043
01:28:33,731 --> 01:28:36,850
Like we've all seen that in the movie,
the assassin doing a couple,

2044
01:28:36,890 --> 01:28:38,770
a couple of very slow pushups.

2045
01:28:39,810 --> 01:28:40,643
Sometimes if I go down to a gym and 
there's nothing that I want to do in 

2046
01:28:42,631 --> 01:28:43,890
there,
I'll work out my hotel room.

2047
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:45,580
You,
you never were like a runner.

2048
01:28:45,581 --> 01:28:46,414
Were you like a run now?
But it's only been over the last couple 

2049
01:28:48,730 --> 01:28:49,563
of years really.
But even when you were like doing a 

2050
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:51,993
taekwondo,
right?

2051
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:54,380
Never had much.
I thought that was part of their thing.

2052
01:28:54,430 --> 01:28:56,320
They had like a military kind of feel to
it.

2053
01:28:56,630 --> 01:28:56,970
Definitely

2054
01:28:56,970 --> 01:28:59,270
a military feel to it and some,
some different.

2055
01:28:59,300 --> 01:29:01,100
Uh,
they would call it Dojo gangs.

2056
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:02,040
You know,
Jeff's a black

2057
01:29:02,040 --> 01:29:02,800
bow tie.

2058
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,940
No,
we are actually on the show.

2059
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:07,700
He pulls out the nunchucks.
That's not a part of it,

2060
01:29:07,701 --> 01:29:08,534
but that's okay.

2061
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,660
You know,
I'm rusty.

2062
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,390
I have to admit I need to get back to 
you exercise these days.

2063
01:29:14,450 --> 01:29:15,283
I've been doing a little bit of Yoga but
honestly I've been doing a lot of not 

2064
01:29:19,221 --> 01:29:21,800
exercising lately.
Like feel good.

2065
01:29:22,340 --> 01:29:25,940
Like I'm going a place now where I need 
to start exercising again.

2066
01:29:26,210 --> 01:29:27,860
We talked about this in the parking lot 
the other day.

2067
01:29:27,861 --> 01:29:30,500
Right.
But on a standup hiatus and when I'm not

2068
01:29:30,501 --> 01:29:31,334
performing I don't care as much about my
instrument and I've been editing and 

2069
01:29:35,571 --> 01:29:36,404
writing and producing so I don't know.
I've gotten a little not late I guess 

2070
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:44,321
lazy and I don't feel as good.
Like I know I recognize it in my body so

2071
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:47,490
I need to snap out of it.
I think he needs,

2072
01:29:47,510 --> 01:29:49,090
it's like a,
like a,

2073
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,550
like a group or like people to hang with
because you know,

2074
01:29:52,551 --> 01:29:54,650
that would make it more fun going out by
myself.

2075
01:29:54,710 --> 01:29:55,670
Yeah.
If there was like a.

2076
01:29:55,671 --> 01:29:56,990
If there was like a group of guys,
you know,

2077
01:29:56,991 --> 01:29:58,220
come on man,
don't let us down.

2078
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:01,750
You could find like a crossfit class to 
join or some shit like that.

2079
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:03,520
I mean they always have those kinds of 
things.

2080
01:30:03,521 --> 01:30:08,521
There's all sorts of different classes 
that you know is awesome.

2081
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:14,560
I've done one of those high intensity 
interval training things at a yoga place

2082
01:30:14,561 --> 01:30:17,440
to whether you do some yoga and some 
like really light weights,

2083
01:30:17,441 --> 01:30:20,600
but all these crazy little exercises.
That's fun too.

2084
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:24,250
You got a dancer pose.
We doing.

2085
01:30:24,251 --> 01:30:29,251
Let me see me say.
Oh,

2086
01:30:30,071 --> 01:30:31,540
you trying to do that?
Don't hurt yourself.

2087
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,150
Yes.
Oh that is that what it's called?

2088
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:35,583
Standing bow thing.
It's called standing bow and there's 

2089
01:30:38,591 --> 01:30:41,140
this one.
Keep it going.

2090
01:30:41,740 --> 01:30:44,740
What are you going?
No one can see you.

2091
01:30:46,870 --> 01:30:48,790
You're supposed to grab both legs,
but that's okay.

2092
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,200
Do it.
Grab that other leg.

2093
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,280
Bet You got it.
Nope.

2094
01:30:51,410 --> 01:30:55,490
This is really do.
Come on son.

2095
01:30:56,030 --> 01:30:57,370
Here he goes.
Nice.

2096
01:30:57,380 --> 01:30:59,390
And the headphones on.
Take it to the new level.

2097
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:03,560
It's like a NASA mission called again,
a cry for help.

2098
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:08,650
The crab.
So when you,

2099
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:11,150
when you say you do yoga,
like how often do you do it?

2100
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,130
What I would go,
I would go to hot yoga.

2101
01:31:13,131 --> 01:31:13,964
You go a couple times a week are now I 
just kind of do it in my backyard to 

2102
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:18,290
stretch out after a long flight or 
something.

2103
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:19,213
That's good.
Anything kind of like you had the tank 

2104
01:31:21,411 --> 01:31:24,550
like that's a time to think about life.
To think through it.

2105
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:26,930
Think through a mission that you're 
working on.

2106
01:31:26,931 --> 01:31:29,240
Some family issue.
It's like quiet.

2107
01:31:29,290 --> 01:31:30,470
You're.
It's about you.

2108
01:31:30,980 --> 01:31:31,611
For me,
Yoga,

2109
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:36,611
it's like giving yourself a massage.
It's more gratifying than going to glory

2110
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:38,120
awaits and stuff.

2111
01:31:38,570 --> 01:31:40,490
Stretch out before sets.
You ever do that?

2112
01:31:40,690 --> 01:31:43,340
Stretches before you go do set feels 
real good.

2113
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:45,470
There's something about that that's very
relaxing.

2114
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:47,870
Puts you in a good.
I think you carry around.

2115
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:48,733
When you're tight,
you carry around a lot of tension that 

2116
01:31:51,471 --> 01:31:52,490
you don't necessarily want.

2117
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:55,050
Pigeon pose.
That's where all the tension is.

2118
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:57,140
Pigeon pose.
That's the one where your.

2119
01:31:58,850 --> 01:32:00,070
Where your leg comes under

2120
01:32:00,070 --> 01:32:03,640
your.
I want to ask what the fuck is he doing?

2121
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:05,940
Oh Wow.
Jeff,

2122
01:32:05,950 --> 01:32:06,401
that.
Oh,

2123
01:32:06,401 --> 01:32:07,810
I've seen this one.
Yeah,

2124
01:32:07,811 --> 01:32:10,570
I've seen that one.
That's called a hip opener.

2125
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:12,120
Yeah.
Good.

2126
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:13,420
Good.
That good hips,

2127
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:15,550
Bro.
It looks so sad.

2128
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,810
That's one.
Like if you go to your yoga,

2129
01:32:20,050 --> 01:32:20,883
people will do that pose and start 
crying because there's so much emotion 

2130
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:26,140
and anxiety release from the hitch.
That's not real job.

2131
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,350
You're just crying because someone tells
you you should cry.

2132
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,113
Sit.
Do you want to be a part of this group 

2133
01:32:31,990 --> 01:32:32,823
cry nonsense.
They always want to say that this is 

2134
01:32:34,901 --> 01:32:37,480
opening up your colon.
You don't have any fucking.

2135
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:41,140
There's no diagrams.
You don't know where the colon is like,

2136
01:32:41,141 --> 01:32:41,974
you better stop.
You better stop saying that you don't 

2137
01:32:43,361 --> 01:32:47,470
have any fucking.
There's tension in the hip.

2138
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:49,390
Cat Scans.
What's that stuff called?

2139
01:32:49,391 --> 01:32:51,740
Magnetic residence Mris.
You don't have that Brown.

2140
01:32:51,810 --> 01:32:53,810
You don't have any real evidence.
There's emotion.

2141
01:32:54,070 --> 01:32:55,400
Who should lead a bowl of me?

2142
01:32:57,290 --> 01:33:00,600
What?
I was just thinking about my dad much

2143
01:33:01,810 --> 01:33:03,640
get the fuck out of here with that shit.
You're not.

2144
01:33:03,880 --> 01:33:06,520
You don't have any memories specifically
and people say,

2145
01:33:06,521 --> 01:33:06,881
no,
no,

2146
01:33:06,881 --> 01:33:07,714
no,
but when I'm in that position and they 

2147
01:33:09,311 --> 01:33:12,040
tell you that it's an if emotions come 
out here,

2148
01:33:12,041 --> 01:33:13,870
you just let them like what emotions

2149
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:14,933
cut out.

2150
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:17,993
You've been hypnotized.
Someone told you our mission to be 

2151
01:33:21,781 --> 01:33:23,700
emotionally vulnerable.
Yes,

2152
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:24,593
that that in hypnosis and you don't get 
that eating lunch at a deli or working 

2153
01:33:28,741 --> 01:33:31,110
out with the boys in the gym.
If you're at a quiet,

2154
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:35,850
dark yoga place with other people that 
are staring at their own at the floor,

2155
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,520
right.
You can relax a little emotionally.

2156
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:39,473
That's a logical definition.
That's a logical way of explaining 

2157
01:33:42,511 --> 01:33:43,900
what's really going on.
I'm going to stay.

2158
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:46,650
It's just good to hear.
Let me ask you a question.

2159
01:33:47,310 --> 01:33:49,680
Do you eat before you go on stage?
No.

2160
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:54,010
Me Neither.
This guy has to eat like he asked.

2161
01:33:54,011 --> 01:33:56,580
He eat before he goes on stage like 
right before,

2162
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:57,823
like pretty much right before.
I mean I don't think there's anything 

2163
01:33:59,851 --> 01:34:02,190
wrong with eating some fruit right 
before you go up on stage,

2164
01:34:02,191 --> 01:34:03,120
but for me,
I don't want to.

2165
01:34:03,660 --> 01:34:07,200
There's a certain amount of resources 
your body is going to use for digestion.

2166
01:34:07,201 --> 01:34:08,034
That's just a fact.
There's a reason why fighters don't eat 

2167
01:34:10,681 --> 01:34:12,270
a fucking car.
You can mash potatoes,

2168
01:34:12,271 --> 01:34:14,370
right?
I hate that fight because your body will

2169
01:34:14,371 --> 01:34:16,200
be like,
fuck you dude.

2170
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,080
We got to digest this stuff and it 
sloshed around your stomach.

2171
01:34:19,081 --> 01:34:20,460
It gets in the way.
I hate it.

2172
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:22,920
Obviously this.
I know plenty of people who have to eat.

2173
01:34:23,750 --> 01:34:26,820
Sometimes I in that first episode of our
show,

2174
01:34:26,821 --> 01:34:27,654
I eat during the show,
I ordered Mozzarella sticks to the 

2175
01:34:30,781 --> 01:34:31,614
stage.
That's how hungry I was by the late 

2176
01:34:33,391 --> 01:34:34,224
show.
There's nothing wrong with that meant 

2177
01:34:34,890 --> 01:34:35,723
it's not.
Not to say that you can't do it and for 

2178
01:34:36,901 --> 01:34:37,734
you you're so casual,
like you're probably better off feeling 

2179
01:34:40,051 --> 01:34:44,980
good then you are like being,
having more mental alertness.

2180
01:34:44,981 --> 01:34:47,520
Slightly out.
Also like being hungry.

2181
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:48,420
Hunger.
I liked it.

2182
01:34:48,421 --> 01:34:51,060
There's annoying.
I ate in the car.

2183
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:55,040
Coming to your studio today and the 
first thing I said to Jeff Atlanta,

2184
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:55,883
the door,
was there anything to eat around here 

2185
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,010
because it's

2186
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:58,843
like it's an anxiety thing too,
like before you're going to perform and 

2187
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:06,290
I remember reading years and years and 
years and years ago that David letterman

2188
01:35:06,291 --> 01:35:08,330
would eat pineapple right before he went
on,

2189
01:35:08,331 --> 01:35:11,090
so I always ask for pineapple in my 
writer's.

2190
01:35:11,091 --> 01:35:14,140
Hi Stacy Pineapples,
a good stacy marketing sales.

2191
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:18,080
He'd also would do a fasting and then he
would pick out.

2192
01:35:18,260 --> 01:35:19,630
That was his thing.
Let him in.

2193
01:35:19,760 --> 01:35:20,593
That's what I heard,
that he would like not eat for like two 

2194
01:35:22,581 --> 01:35:25,700
or three days and then he would do that 
and that's how my friend Russ does it.

2195
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:29,900
Like that kind of thing of like where 
you like just basically spartan,

2196
01:35:29,901 --> 01:35:30,800
like nothing.
Nothing,

2197
01:35:30,801 --> 01:35:31,634
nothing.
And then like you get to eat whatever 

2198
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:33,104
you want.
I believe for sure that people eat too 

2199
01:35:34,341 --> 01:35:36,900
much food and me included,
I eat too much meat

2200
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:40,090
and when I,
when I fast like especially intermittent

2201
01:35:40,091 --> 01:35:42,670
fast,
I do like 16 hours at night when I do do

2202
01:35:42,671 --> 01:35:43,720
that.
I feel way better.

2203
01:35:43,930 --> 01:35:44,570
Way Better.

2204
01:35:44,570 --> 01:35:45,403
Wait.
What fascinates between dinner and the 

2205
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:49,910
next time I eat is 16 hours.
Jeff,

2206
01:35:49,911 --> 01:35:51,450
can you imagine that?
No.

2207
01:35:52,260 --> 01:35:55,490
Could you just decide in,
do you go to bed?

2208
01:35:55,500 --> 01:36:00,500
Would have to be getting a colonoscopy 
or you just look,

2209
01:36:00,900 --> 01:36:02,890
you eat dinner,
you'd done it eight.

2210
01:36:03,260 --> 01:36:04,970
You go to bed or do whatever the fuck 
you do,

2211
01:36:04,971 --> 01:36:07,100
but just know more.
How do you.

2212
01:36:07,820 --> 01:36:08,930
What are you talking about?
He can't.

2213
01:36:08,931 --> 01:36:10,790
Yeah.
You have to eat to come on at 10.

2214
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:13,430
The last thing I want to do is eat any 
later than eight.

2215
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:19,850
I go right to the cookies in the back of
the comedy store.

2216
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:20,240
Cookies

2217
01:36:20,240 --> 01:36:21,590
are different though.
That's quick.

2218
01:36:21,591 --> 01:36:23,540
Carbs.
That actually is not a bad idea.

2219
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:26,390
I see.
That's not a bad idea at all.

2220
01:36:26,540 --> 01:36:28,940
Like you don't need that stuff to you.
I'll eat that stuff.

2221
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:34,150
When I was doing this sober October 
fitness challenge with Ari and Tom Seger

2222
01:36:34,191 --> 01:36:35,810
and Bert Kreischer,
I eat everything in sight.

2223
01:36:35,811 --> 01:36:36,644
I ate pizza and cookies.
I eat everything because it's just one 

2224
01:36:38,780 --> 01:36:39,613
calories,
but the problem with cookies and stuff 

2225
01:36:42,081 --> 01:36:43,310
like that,
it's like you can eat them,

2226
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:44,413
but you just can't make a habit of 
eating them all the time or will fuck 

2227
01:36:46,461 --> 01:36:47,960
you up.
It's just gonna fuck you up.

2228
01:36:48,540 --> 01:36:51,340
When you go on stage,
not a bad idea.

2229
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:53,030
Got a little pick me up.
Energy,

2230
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:53,993
quick carbs.
Your body's going to break down those 

2231
01:36:55,251 --> 01:36:58,670
carbs.
No Sugar and glucose is a very good fuel

2232
01:36:58,671 --> 01:37:00,800
for the brain.
Really works.

2233
01:37:00,890 --> 01:37:01,520
Yeah.
Yeah.

2234
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:02,353
Carbs are good for the brain,
especially in like if your body's carb 

2235
01:37:05,091 --> 01:37:05,600
adapted.

2236
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,433
If you eat carbs all the time and you 
can eat some carbs right before you go 

2237
01:37:09,171 --> 01:37:11,090
onstage,
that'll give you like a little energy.

2238
01:37:11,270 --> 01:37:12,790
I feel so much better.
Even lift.

2239
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:13,430
Yeah.
Really,

2240
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:14,263
like if you wanted to have a cookie or 
maybe even a snickers bar and then lift 

2241
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:17,474
weights,
I wouldn't.

2242
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:18,343
I wouldn't say don't do that.
Say that'll give you some fucking sugar 

2243
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:22,064
to burn off.
Like it's not the best food for you in 

2244
01:37:23,541 --> 01:37:24,374
the world,
but you're asking for it for a very 

2245
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,410
specific reason.
Like after it's over,

2246
01:37:27,411 --> 01:37:28,244
I'd say yeah,
go have some salmon and some vegetables 

2247
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:33,320
and eat healthy,
but right before you want to work out.

2248
01:37:33,321 --> 01:37:34,154
Like you could drink a coke,
like you could drink a coca cola and if 

2249
01:37:37,190 --> 01:37:38,570
you're going to lift for an hour,
okay,

2250
01:37:38,590 --> 01:37:39,500
go ahead.
Drink a coke.

2251
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:40,453
Who gives a shit.
You got to burn that shit off and it's 

2252
01:37:41,731 --> 01:37:43,620
just going to be fueled.
That you use is.

2253
01:37:43,650 --> 01:37:46,010
I wouldn't suggest you do it all the 
time,

2254
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:48,500
but it's not going to have a negative 
effect on you.

2255
01:37:48,501 --> 01:37:51,680
It's really a cumulative thing with 
people in diets.

2256
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:52,753
It's eating too much sugar or too much 
bullshit for too many days in a row and 

2257
01:37:56,461 --> 01:37:58,290
not giving your body a chance to relax.

2258
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:00,770
So when I,
when I don't eat,

2259
01:38:00,771 --> 01:38:02,750
I never considered like,
oh,

2260
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:04,220
that's lightheadedness.
I'm like,

2261
01:38:04,221 --> 01:38:05,690
I'm probably having a stroke.
Right?

2262
01:38:07,490 --> 01:38:09,400
This is it.
I should find a place to lay down.

2263
01:38:10,590 --> 01:38:12,330
I think that's awesome.
Well listen,

2264
01:38:12,331 --> 01:38:14,160
food is fucking phenomenal,
right?

2265
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:14,994
And you're lucky you live in New York 
City and then you come to la so you're 

2266
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:19,164
in both places and you're in two spots 
that have some of the greatest 

2267
01:38:22,381 --> 01:38:25,770
restaurants on the planet earth.
And if you're like a Foodie,

2268
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:28,680
Foodie,
some cash,

2269
01:38:28,681 --> 01:38:30,870
Jeff Ross,
you can go wherever the fuck you want.

2270
01:38:30,871 --> 01:38:31,704
I do order a nice bottle of wine and 
have a fucking beautiful steak with the 

2271
01:38:37,051 --> 01:38:40,650
right accoutrements and you know,
why wouldn't you?

2272
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:42,980
I mean it's,
it's a beautiful pleasure and evaluate a

2273
01:38:42,990 --> 01:38:46,460
stake.
Some red meat fucker fight.

2274
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:47,820
It's like I'm either on

2275
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:54,190
as soon as I eat a steak and I don't 
need them as much as I used to,

2276
01:38:54,380 --> 01:38:57,550
but a lot on the tour.
Maybe it was you,

2277
01:38:57,551 --> 01:38:59,350
me and Monica.
That was a great.

2278
01:38:59,351 --> 01:39:00,370
What was.
What were you guys having?

2279
01:39:00,371 --> 01:39:01,204
They're like a porter house,
you know the thing where like not only 

2280
01:39:03,581 --> 01:39:05,980
at the ribs still there,
but the hubs like that kind of thing.

2281
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,680
That really basically like a do it 
yourself,

2282
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:11,000
do it yourself kind of steak bone in 
real.

2283
01:39:11,020 --> 01:39:11,910
We really went to.
Yeah,

2284
01:39:11,950 --> 01:39:15,340
we went to town on that.
She'd eat more that I love a good steak.

2285
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,540
I don't think there's anything wrong 
with it.

2286
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:17,403
I think what's wrong with steak?
What would people think was wrong with 

2287
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:21,133
Ron?
With red meat is all the stuff you eat 

2288
01:39:21,941 --> 01:39:24,640
with it.
All the sugar and bullshit and bread and

2289
01:39:24,641 --> 01:39:28,270
pasta and then alcohol and sedentary 
life.

2290
01:39:28,271 --> 01:39:29,104
There's a bunch of things,
but I think if you're a healthy person 

2291
01:39:30,701 --> 01:39:33,790
who exercise all the time,
I don't think stakes bad for you at all.

2292
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:35,710
I don't even think a little bit.
I think it's good for you.

2293
01:39:35,860 --> 01:39:37,180
I think it's the opposite of bad for 
you.

2294
01:39:37,181 --> 01:39:40,660
I think all of our preconceived notions 
about what's healthy,

2295
01:39:41,200 --> 01:39:44,350
all of them vary because some people 
that really don't do good with red meat.

2296
01:39:44,351 --> 01:39:46,750
Some people don't do well with fish.
People have weird,

2297
01:39:46,750 --> 01:39:48,970
but I don't eat fish.
I don't like it either.

2298
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:50,350
Do you eat it?
Love it.

2299
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,680
You do that right away,
like steps up your whole game,

2300
01:39:53,710 --> 01:39:54,790
right?
That's for sure.

2301
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:55,930
It's a lifesaving thing.

2302
01:39:55,980 --> 01:39:56,771
Well,
if you get it,

2303
01:39:56,771 --> 01:39:59,850
a lot of those essential fatty acids 
that you can get from like an oily fish,

2304
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:00,740
like a salmon,
there's.

2305
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:01,970
They're so good for you,
man.

2306
01:40:01,980 --> 01:40:05,070
So good at reducing inflammation.
Do you take fish oil at all?

2307
01:40:05,910 --> 01:40:08,010
One of the best things you can take fish
oil,

2308
01:40:08,011 --> 01:40:08,844
Krill oil and anything.
Getting those essential fatty acids 

2309
01:40:11,431 --> 01:40:13,260
which so many people are missing from 
their diet.

2310
01:40:13,560 --> 01:40:15,930
Just getting a good healthy supply of it
everyday.

2311
01:40:15,960 --> 01:40:17,250
It's just good for everything,
man.

2312
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,200
It's good for your skin.
It's good for your brain.

2313
01:40:19,201 --> 01:40:21,600
Good for muscle development.
Oil.

2314
01:40:21,690 --> 01:40:22,770
Yeah.
Official is phenomenal.

2315
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:25,500
It's good for inflammation and if you 
have joint aches and stuff like that,

2316
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:28,080
officials have a burger.
I feel like I have a booger,

2317
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:29,403
you know,
how you like touch your nose and it 

2318
01:40:30,841 --> 01:40:32,580
feels moist and you're like,
what's happening here?

2319
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:34,980
Do you have a cleaner?
What's going on here?

2320
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,210
We're good.
I think you're clean.

2321
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:37,700
You're good.
But officials,

2322
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:38,910
just one of the best things,
man.

2323
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,490
So good for you.
What does it,

2324
01:40:40,890 --> 01:40:41,723
what is fish oil?
Oil extracted from fish and the fish a 

2325
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:47,150
little bit of calm.
They,

2326
01:40:47,190 --> 01:40:48,660
they,
they excelled.

2327
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:53,410
Merge booth at the Joe.
So because like David,

2328
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:54,060
have you ever

2329
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:55,320
caught it?
Caught like a what?

2330
01:40:55,321 --> 01:40:56,560
What is it like a sport?
Fish,

2331
01:40:56,561 --> 01:40:57,820
you know,
like a big one or anything like that.

2332
01:40:57,821 --> 01:40:59,380
And then you would make steaks out of 
that too.

2333
01:40:59,770 --> 01:41:01,140
Um,
I've done that with the,

2334
01:41:01,230 --> 01:41:06,230
the most delicious thing I think I 
caught was a Wahoo other names for it.

2335
01:41:07,480 --> 01:41:08,313
So we're,

2336
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:11,440
we caught in Hawaii.
It was phenomenal man,

2337
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:12,274
because big we brought it.
We were staying at a hotel and we 

2338
01:41:13,871 --> 01:41:15,030
brought it to the,
uh,

2339
01:41:15,130 --> 01:41:15,963
the waiter or the chef in the hotel 
would cook stuff for you and you would 

2340
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,640
just bring them to the,
uh,

2341
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:23,320
the fish and,
you know,

2342
01:41:23,350 --> 01:41:24,640
he would go,
how do you guys think,

2343
01:41:24,641 --> 01:41:26,530
do you want to prepare this?
And so we said,

2344
01:41:26,531 --> 01:41:26,980
I don't know,
like,

2345
01:41:26,980 --> 01:41:28,510
what do you think?
It's like,

2346
01:41:28,690 --> 01:41:30,160
what would you do if somebody brought 
you this?

2347
01:41:30,161 --> 01:41:30,994
He goes,
I would prepare a bunch of different 

2348
01:41:31,721 --> 01:41:32,554
ways because there's a huge fish so I 
can make you guys a little bit of 

2349
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:36,510
[inaudible],
a little bit of Sushi.

2350
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,890
My perfect.
So it was,

2351
01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:41,800
he cooked it six hours after it was 
dead.

2352
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:45,010
I mean we caught it and then six hours 
later we're eating it for lunch.

2353
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:46,690
It was insane.
It was so good.

2354
01:41:46,780 --> 01:41:47,780
That is cool.
Oh,

2355
01:41:47,950 --> 01:41:49,690
that's it right there.
Wow.

2356
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:51,310
That's what it looks like.
There's another name for it.

2357
01:41:51,311 --> 01:41:53,080
And the Hawaii,
they call it an oh no.

2358
01:41:53,140 --> 01:41:54,010
Oh no,
that's right.

2359
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,490
That's right.
It's still licious.

2360
01:41:55,630 --> 01:41:56,380
It's so good

2361
01:41:56,380 --> 01:41:58,240
fishes looking at the camera too.
Oh wait,

2362
01:42:01,070 --> 01:42:05,020
that's crazy.
But yeah,

2363
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:06,460
it's.
You like fishing over hunting?

2364
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:08,110
No,
fishing is harder.

2365
01:42:08,350 --> 01:42:09,640
I like them.
Both you do

2366
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:13,700
is way more intense and I feel way worse
for the animal.

2367
01:42:14,020 --> 01:42:15,370
Like I don't feel bad for them.

2368
01:42:15,390 --> 01:42:16,440
Fish.
Yeah,

2369
01:42:16,650 --> 01:42:17,483
exactly.

2370
01:42:17,770 --> 01:42:19,460
For whatever reason,
I'm just being honest,

2371
01:42:19,461 --> 01:42:21,740
like if I catch a big salmon and I'm 
like,

2372
01:42:21,741 --> 01:42:23,330
sorry dude,
right,

2373
01:42:23,331 --> 01:42:24,920
but this is what I'm here for.
Like,

2374
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:26,860
but when I shoot a deer,
um,

2375
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:29,210
there's always a little part of me and 
it's like,

2376
01:42:31,180 --> 01:42:32,370
oh,
you know,

2377
01:42:32,540 --> 01:42:33,650
this is what I,
you know,

2378
01:42:33,651 --> 01:42:36,620
I eat and I know that if I don't do 
this,

2379
01:42:36,621 --> 01:42:37,454
they're going to die of starvation or 
disease or they're going to be ripped 

2380
01:42:40,041 --> 01:42:41,840
apart.
Asshole first by coyotes.

2381
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:44,360
Like this is not a good end for them no 
matter what.

2382
01:42:44,361 --> 01:42:45,194
And me shooting them,
it's probably the best end they're ever 

2383
01:42:46,401 --> 01:42:48,800
going to get all those justifications 
aside.

2384
01:42:48,830 --> 01:42:51,920
It's a different feeling when you see 
like an elk down.

2385
01:42:52,190 --> 01:42:56,120
Then when I catch a salmon salmon,
it's 100 percent happiness.

2386
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,630
But what about when you pull the 
trigger?

2387
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:02,790
I'm seeing the animal downs one thing,
but what about knowing it's coming?

2388
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:05,490
It's hard to keep your shit together.
That's a hunter.

2389
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:07,140
That's the hunting.
You get emotional.

2390
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:08,130
No,
you don't.

2391
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:10,500
You get nervous.
You don't want to fuck it up.

2392
01:43:10,530 --> 01:43:13,320
You don't want to injure anything.
So there's a lot of anticipation in that

2393
01:43:13,321 --> 01:43:14,154
moment.
It's sort of,

2394
01:43:14,390 --> 01:43:15,223
it's very intense and uh,
whatever amount of meat you get from 

2395
01:43:20,281 --> 01:43:21,840
that animal,
whenever you eat it,

2396
01:43:21,841 --> 01:43:24,720
you're going to think about that moment.
You think about that moment.

2397
01:43:24,721 --> 01:43:28,080
Every time I eat,
let slip while you think about it.

2398
01:43:28,081 --> 01:43:28,914
Like this is,
this was a intense life or death moment 

2399
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:35,910
in life,
like this circle of life chain moment in

2400
01:43:35,911 --> 01:43:39,450
life that I participated in it and now 
I'm eating it so I know exactly what the

2401
01:43:39,451 --> 01:43:44,451
food is as opposed to going to Morton's 
get a nice steak and mashed potatoes.

2402
01:43:44,461 --> 01:43:46,080
I don't know where the fuck they grew 
that potato.

2403
01:43:47,150 --> 01:43:47,983
I get that feeling when I opened the can
of pringles went on Monday when I'm in 

2404
01:43:51,891 --> 01:43:51,980
the

2405
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,880
refrigerator.
Creamsicles do you think,

2406
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:57,913
do you like fishing at all?
I used to fish as a kid and the Hudson 

2407
01:44:00,650 --> 01:44:01,483
River with my grandfather.
We would catch bass and I really loved 

2408
01:44:03,411 --> 01:44:05,120
it.
I haven't done it since I was a kid.

2409
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:06,380
Really.
It's fun.

2410
01:44:06,381 --> 01:44:08,030
It's a fun thing to do.
It's a passion.

2411
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:08,913
Yeah.
With just if you could find like if 

2412
01:44:10,791 --> 01:44:11,624
you're doing a gig and you could find a 
spot that has like a party boat 

2413
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:16,170
especially,
and they.

2414
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,053
They'll take out and everybody dunks a 
line and people pulling fish left and 

2415
01:44:19,371 --> 01:44:20,204
right.
Nobody's laughing and people drinking 

2416
01:44:21,021 --> 01:44:23,060
beers.
It's fucking fun,

2417
01:44:23,061 --> 01:44:24,230
man.
It's fun.

2418
01:44:24,290 --> 01:44:26,060
Yeah,
but that was a big thing in New England.

2419
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:30,470
We do party boats for bluefish and just 
go to a spot and everybody dropped their

2420
01:44:30,471 --> 01:44:32,520
line and they'd be pulling these fish up
and then,

2421
01:44:32,530 --> 01:44:33,890
you know,
you cook them later that night.

2422
01:44:33,890 --> 01:44:35,990
It's fantastic.
Wow.

2423
01:44:36,330 --> 01:44:40,370
Just makes you think about what a fish 
is too and how weird it is.

2424
01:44:40,371 --> 01:44:43,580
We got this alien world connected to us.
We pull these things out,

2425
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:45,380
cut their fucking heads off and cook 
them up.

2426
01:44:46,470 --> 01:44:47,303
Well,
you've been to Japan and all those 

2427
01:44:47,991 --> 01:44:50,150
places.
I've been to Japan,

2428
01:44:50,151 --> 01:44:52,850
but I fucked up when I was there and I 
didn't go to the fish market.

2429
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:57,110
The fish market in Tokyo is one of those
like a million fish.

2430
01:44:57,111 --> 01:44:58,720
We don't even know about that.
They liked it.

2431
01:44:58,780 --> 01:45:01,510
It's crazy,
but it's so,

2432
01:45:01,790 --> 01:45:04,130
so interesting to see like,
you know,

2433
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:05,810
we're so used to,
like you said,

2434
01:45:05,811 --> 01:45:07,070
bread and all that stuff.
It's like,

2435
01:45:07,071 --> 01:45:08,330
you know,
is it a meal without bread?

2436
01:45:08,331 --> 01:45:11,720
It's like these people like go months 
without seeing a piece of bread.

2437
01:45:11,721 --> 01:45:13,070
Yeah.
They're not in the bread and they're all

2438
01:45:13,071 --> 01:45:14,110
thin.
Yeah.

2439
01:45:14,111 --> 01:45:14,944
It's hilarious.

2440
01:45:15,110 --> 01:45:17,690
They're their noodles.
A lot of times they're rice noodles.

2441
01:45:17,691 --> 01:45:18,830
It's very different.
You know,

2442
01:45:18,831 --> 01:45:20,510
there's wheat noodles there too though,
right?

2443
01:45:20,990 --> 01:45:22,730
They just,
they eat different than us.

2444
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:25,990
They have a completely different style 
of eating in just.

2445
01:45:26,230 --> 01:45:28,970
It's one of the coolest things about 
Tokyo man,

2446
01:45:29,180 --> 01:45:31,940
is that it's almost like an alternative 
country.

2447
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:33,500
It's,
Oh,

2448
01:45:33,501 --> 01:45:36,230
you mean this city because it's so 
different.

2449
01:45:36,231 --> 01:45:37,930
Like say if you're in Los Angeles,
right?

2450
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:38,803
You'll leave from Los Angeles and you 
know you're here in 2018 and you drive 

2451
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:43,544
it around.
This is the way people live over here 

2452
01:45:44,720 --> 01:45:45,553
and this is how people were in traffic 
and this is how people are when they 

2453
01:45:47,721 --> 01:45:49,250
come to the comedy store,
all these different places,

2454
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,660
and then you go to Tokyo,
you go,

2455
01:45:50,690 --> 01:45:51,523
oh,
wow.

2456
01:45:51,670 --> 01:45:55,610
Is also people in 2018 to live in at the
exact same time,

2457
01:45:55,611 --> 01:45:56,900
but they're doing it totally 
differently.

2458
01:45:57,140 --> 01:45:59,690
Like everybody's super polite as you 
walked on the street.

2459
01:45:59,691 --> 01:46:02,540
There's no people bumping into anybody.
Nobody's yelling at anybody.

2460
01:46:02,541 --> 01:46:05,600
They're very polite,
but they're also very Japanese,

2461
01:46:05,630 --> 01:46:06,463
right?
The majority of people you see are 

2462
01:46:07,281 --> 01:46:10,490
Japanese homogeneous,
lightly integrated,

2463
01:46:10,491 --> 01:46:11,091
right?
I mean,

2464
01:46:11,091 --> 01:46:12,690
there's some,
you see some Africans there.

2465
01:46:12,710 --> 01:46:16,160
See some people like us there,
but it's mostly Japanese people.

2466
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:16,840
It's,
uh,

2467
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:17,673
it's interesting to see it.
Have you seen this TV show on Amazon 

2468
01:46:19,671 --> 01:46:21,910
called the man in the high castle now?
What is it?

2469
01:46:22,660 --> 01:46:25,310
It's a future.
It's basically America.

2470
01:46:26,210 --> 01:46:27,043
If the Nazis won the war and they 
partner with the Japanese and the 

2471
01:46:31,851 --> 01:46:35,150
Japanese owned California,
Northern California,

2472
01:46:35,540 --> 01:46:38,400
and the Nazis on the rest of the country
and the Midwest,

2473
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:41,480
sort of a no man's land.
So New York is Nazi,

2474
01:46:41,481 --> 01:46:42,680
New York.
They split it up.

2475
01:46:42,681 --> 01:46:44,870
The but,
but Japanese.

2476
01:46:46,090 --> 01:46:50,070
Whoa.
It's third season

2477
01:46:50,070 --> 01:46:52,710
and I'm obsessed with it.
Philip Dick is the,

2478
01:46:52,711 --> 01:46:54,010
uh,
is the PSI writer.

2479
01:46:54,011 --> 01:46:56,130
So he's classic.
It's one of his books.

2480
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:59,100
He's the mayor,
he's gracious guy.

2481
01:46:59,180 --> 01:47:01,050
That guy has been in a lot of stuff,
was really good.

2482
01:47:01,260 --> 01:47:03,360
What is his name?
I forgot it.

2483
01:47:03,361 --> 01:47:08,360
The actor's name,
Rufus Rufus.

2484
01:47:08,410 --> 01:47:09,243
See?
Well,

2485
01:47:09,480 --> 01:47:10,710
is that I say it.
Yeah,

2486
01:47:10,980 --> 01:47:13,740
it's really good looking place.
The governor of New York.

2487
01:47:13,741 --> 01:47:17,250
Let's see,
food for the Arbor group in proofers.

2488
01:47:17,251 --> 01:47:20,070
The governor of New York pure is the 
governor of New York.

2489
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:20,500
Yeah.

2490
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:21,333
But it's a very interesting show.
Basically New York cops wearing Nazi 

2491
01:47:24,671 --> 01:47:26,710
armband.
So there's still New York cops like,

2492
01:47:26,900 --> 01:47:27,733
hey,
the furious says I got give you a 

2493
01:47:28,820 --> 01:47:29,501
ticket.
You know,

2494
01:47:29,501 --> 01:47:30,334
it's like that.
And it's fascinating how they do the 

2495
01:47:33,101 --> 01:47:33,934
show.
But what's interesting about Japanese 

2496
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:37,300
culture and the show is you see the,
the,

2497
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:40,090
the,
the fancy class,

2498
01:47:40,091 --> 01:47:40,600
the,
the,

2499
01:47:40,600 --> 01:47:41,433
the,
the aristocratic class of Japanese of 

2500
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:44,130
Japan,
uh,

2501
01:47:44,290 --> 01:47:46,740
runs essentially,
um,

2502
01:47:47,020 --> 01:47:50,410
San Francisco.
And you see how they're very snobby and

2503
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:55,320
particular in and they don't really like
to mix with the Americans.

2504
01:47:55,740 --> 01:47:57,330
Wow.
With the Anglos.

2505
01:47:57,390 --> 01:47:59,070
It's fascinating.
Really.

2506
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,110
That Guy Philip k,
Dick,

2507
01:48:02,150 --> 01:48:03,700
you know,
am I saying his name right?

2508
01:48:04,720 --> 01:48:06,760
He really is.
He's really a,

2509
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:10,300
he's really super cool.
Like in terms of the Scifi stuff and um,

2510
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:10,970
you know,

2511
01:48:10,970 --> 01:48:11,970
what else has he written?
I've,

2512
01:48:11,971 --> 01:48:14,300
I've seen there was another movie that I
saw his,

2513
01:48:14,301 --> 01:48:19,301
like within the last two years.
Could you,

2514
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:21,330
could you bring up his,
uh,

2515
01:48:21,390 --> 01:48:25,610
his books because I would know what 
other movies that you do or did they,

2516
01:48:25,611 --> 01:48:30,470
do they adapt of his movies?
What do we got here?

2517
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:34,100
So this guy wrote that show scanner 
darkly.

2518
01:48:34,370 --> 01:48:35,630
Wow.
That's right.

2519
01:48:36,770 --> 01:48:38,570
Damn.
He wrote a lot of shit.

2520
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:40,100
The adjustment team.
Isn't that a movie,

2521
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:42,350
Tim?
That's bureau.

2522
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:43,873
Yeah.
Okay.

2523
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:45,500
Interesting.
Yeah,

2524
01:48:45,501 --> 01:48:50,450
the art direction is really cool.
The idea of not so fine America.

2525
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:51,313
You know what's interesting too is you 
can still do that in a movie where you 

2526
01:48:54,891 --> 01:48:59,510
can still play Nazis as long as they're,
you know,

2527
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:05,110
the bad people and some historical thing
or some something that's going on now.

2528
01:49:05,961 --> 01:49:08,600
That's really the only way you could 
portray Nazis.

2529
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,300
Like you're not allowed to be a Nazi for
Halloween.

2530
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:13,960
Sorry.
Right.

2531
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:18,500
Like people have said like people have 
tried it and you get called out for it.

2532
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:20,480
Like there's rules now.
You can't be

2533
01:49:21,470 --> 01:49:22,840
get on that show.
What are your.

2534
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:24,710
What did your kids go for Halloween?
Did they,

2535
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:26,440
do they do that or do they even.

2536
01:49:27,560 --> 01:49:29,060
It was very adorable.
They were Mermaids,

2537
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:34,250
but when you're,
if you're dressing up for Halloween,

2538
01:49:34,251 --> 01:49:35,084
you could be so many terrible things.
He could be vampires and werewolves and 

2539
01:49:38,751 --> 01:49:40,310
demons and everybody's.
Okay,

2540
01:49:40,311 --> 01:49:41,144
cool.
Cool.

2541
01:49:41,550 --> 01:49:43,760
I went to a plastic straw.
Kingus Khan.

2542
01:49:43,761 --> 01:49:45,380
You can be kingus Khan.
Can't be Hitler.

2543
01:49:45,450 --> 01:49:47,980
It could be Saddam Hussein and people 
will laugh if yes,

2544
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:49,870
sit down was saying we got them,
we got that guy.

2545
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,300
But if you dress Mengele,
you've ruined the party.

2546
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:58,450
You dress as Osama bin Laden.
That might get your ass kicked,

2547
01:49:59,290 --> 01:50:02,320
you might get your ass kicked for that 
one or that was too soon,

2548
01:50:02,860 --> 01:50:07,020
but if you dress like you could probably
dress like a.

2549
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:10,240
The president of Iran.
What's that dude's name?

2550
01:50:10,330 --> 01:50:12,990
That dude came over here and set a bunch
of crazy shit.

2551
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:15,270
Gay People Boucher,
Boucher,

2552
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:15,540
blah,
blah,

2553
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,060
blah.
No,

2554
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:18,670
I'm talking about.
Let's just talk about it for a second.

2555
01:50:18,910 --> 01:50:19,743
I remember when people were offended 
that there was an Anne Frank Halloween 

2556
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:24,484
costume.
Now if the point of talking about the 

2557
01:50:27,521 --> 01:50:28,354
Holocaust or something like that is 
never forget and a 14 year old in a non 

2558
01:50:33,191 --> 01:50:37,030
mocking way wants to embody and frank,
why is that offensive?

2559
01:50:37,031 --> 01:50:38,800
I don't understand that,
but they're never going to do it.

2560
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:39,630
Non Mocking.
Right?

2561
01:50:39,630 --> 01:50:42,220
Every time you're making a halloween 
costume,

2562
01:50:42,230 --> 01:50:43,990
you're almost always trying to be silly.
Right?

2563
01:50:45,150 --> 01:50:46,980
Frank?
He's hiding in the attic.

2564
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:51,100
Halloween Halloweena cost,
but I don't know.

2565
01:50:52,660 --> 01:50:53,950
It all depends on,
to me,

2566
01:50:54,010 --> 01:50:55,660
your intentions.
One hundred percent.

2567
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:57,340
You should be able to wear whatever the 
fuck you want.

2568
01:50:57,640 --> 01:50:58,473
I never understood when that Prince 
Harry got all this shit for dressing 

2569
01:51:00,101 --> 01:51:02,110
like a Nazi.
It was like,

2570
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:03,730
I don't know,
maybe wait,

2571
01:51:03,731 --> 01:51:06,100
did he dress,
like announcing he was dressed for,

2572
01:51:06,101 --> 01:51:09,600
it was a costume party to veterans.
So like what,

2573
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:11,200
what would you do?
Why would you do that?

2574
01:51:11,740 --> 01:51:12,573
You know,
because it doesn't mean he's glorifying 

2575
01:51:14,321 --> 01:51:15,220
it,
does it?

2576
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:17,020
I guess if he's the prince,
right.

2577
01:51:17,021 --> 01:51:21,240
But you could be a Mongol,
you can be one of the Mongol hoards tour

2578
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:24,250
through Europe,
but he's also a symbol unto itself.

2579
01:51:24,251 --> 01:51:26,370
He's assemble the English royalty and 
all that kind of,

2580
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,690
I guess because it's hundreds of 
thousands of years later.

2581
01:51:29,020 --> 01:51:29,853
But he grew up all right.
He got out of it that motherfuckers 

2582
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,780
living under a microscope though when he
can get away with,

2583
01:51:34,781 --> 01:51:37,990
but pretty much no one can get away with
being a Nazi anymore.

2584
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:42,100
There was a guy from North Carolina or 
something like that recently.

2585
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:45,130
Him and his son were Nazis for,
for Halloween.

2586
01:51:45,131 --> 01:51:45,964
One person that could get away with it 
and I can't say too much because we 

2587
01:51:48,371 --> 01:51:49,740
haven't released it yet.
But uh,

2588
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:53,180
Gilbert godfried so he can get.
I know it.

2589
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:54,670
If you're a Jew you can get away with 
it.

2590
01:51:54,960 --> 01:51:56,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

2591
01:51:56,410 --> 01:51:57,243
You can,
yeah.

2592
01:51:57,370 --> 01:51:58,290
Everybody's,
everybody's,

2593
01:51:58,600 --> 01:52:00,310
you know,
everyone seems to.

2594
01:52:01,330 --> 01:52:03,970
Yes.
Go ahead and put your right.

2595
01:52:04,180 --> 01:52:06,340
I mean remember when she did that?
She dresses a Nazi.

2596
01:52:06,360 --> 01:52:08,290
Yeah.
I always think that stuff's funny.

2597
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:12,760
When I was a 13 year old kid and he was 
school or grade school,

2598
01:52:12,761 --> 01:52:15,750
learning about the first amendment,
this,

2599
01:52:15,790 --> 01:52:16,623
one of the reasons I became a comedian 
was because I used to just draw 

2600
01:52:19,470 --> 01:52:24,470
swastikas on my notebooks just because,
just because I knew I was like,

2601
01:52:24,900 --> 01:52:27,370
they would teach us about dictatorships,
so I would go,

2602
01:52:27,460 --> 01:52:28,293
wow.
So in any other country they can't do 

2603
01:52:29,801 --> 01:52:30,634
this and I would just do it,
make myself smile and then cross it out 

2604
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:36,160
and I go in any other country,
I'd get my tongue cut out.

2605
01:52:36,490 --> 01:52:37,323
I go,
that's the beautiful thing is that you 

2606
01:52:39,251 --> 01:52:43,210
can say fucked up terrible.
You can dress like an asshole.

2607
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:45,600
Like bad taste is not a crime.
Right?

2608
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,350
Yeah.
And that was what one of the,

2609
01:52:48,530 --> 01:52:51,410
you remember the Yale uprising a couple 
of years back,

2610
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:56,860
there was a guy,
I'm Nicholas Greek name and his wife,

2611
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:59,143
they were at Yale and the wife sent out 
an email saying that we need to stop 

2612
01:53:04,070 --> 01:53:07,370
policing people's costumes.
It's Halloween costume.

2613
01:53:07,590 --> 01:53:08,423
She got fired and you can have a 
politically incorrect ca halloween 

2614
01:53:12,141 --> 01:53:15,270
costume like we should relax.
And people started freaking out.

2615
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:18,780
They cornered him in the square or 
screaming and nick,

2616
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:21,980
here it is,
Chris Christakis,

2617
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:23,190
Christakis,
I don't wanna fuck up.

2618
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:25,210
So Nicholas Christakis.
So uh,

2619
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:26,113
he's a Greek American sociologist and a 
physician and he was teaching at Yale 

2620
01:53:31,070 --> 01:53:31,903
and these kids were,
they confronted them and they were 

2621
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:36,710
screaming at him like,
this is our safe place.

2622
01:53:36,711 --> 01:53:37,544
You fucking ruined our play.
It was so bizarre and strange and 

2623
01:53:41,331 --> 01:53:42,164
hostile.
And he was just trapped out there with 

2624
01:53:44,211 --> 01:53:49,211
these nonsensical kids screaming at him 
that he's racist and this whole thing is

2625
01:53:49,761 --> 01:53:53,210
racist and he shouldn't be able to wear 
whatever costume you want.

2626
01:53:53,211 --> 01:53:56,210
Like no one even specified like what 
we're talking about.

2627
01:53:56,590 --> 01:53:58,460
It was,
it was ethnic costumes that they,

2628
01:53:58,540 --> 01:54:00,910
that's supposed to appropriate another 
culture.

2629
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:02,890
Even even though like,
you know,

2630
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:03,753
it's just for the party.
I got Adam and people are just looking 

2631
01:54:07,211 --> 01:54:09,970
for a reason to be upset.
It doesn't have to make any sense.

2632
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,990
But,
but the whole idea of like this thing,

2633
01:54:13,410 --> 01:54:17,310
this woke a thing like my niece and my 
niece and nephew are going to call,

2634
01:54:17,340 --> 01:54:20,800
you know they're going to get ready to 
go to college and I'm like Oh God,

2635
01:54:20,801 --> 01:54:22,490
this is going to be so difficult,
you know,

2636
01:54:22,570 --> 01:54:25,090
because they're going to come out of 
this machine,

2637
01:54:25,240 --> 01:54:27,280
you know,
pretty much looking at me as like,

2638
01:54:27,281 --> 01:54:28,114
you know,
pretty much I'm already not that 

2639
01:54:28,811 --> 01:54:29,644
relevant but like just like all of my 
references and stuff like that and just 

2640
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:34,690
going to be so you know,
inappropriate.

2641
01:54:35,860 --> 01:54:36,693
And it's like when you go to college 
it's supposed to go to the open your 

2642
01:54:38,681 --> 01:54:42,010
mind not to really focus your opinion 
that you already have.

2643
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:46,540
So that's what I felt was like,
I felt like everybody's like,

2644
01:54:46,541 --> 01:54:47,374
I don't want to play college show and 
we're all dreading the day when we have 

2645
01:54:50,021 --> 01:54:52,360
to play a show like that where,
you know,

2646
01:54:52,630 --> 01:54:54,580
everybody there has that group think,
you know,

2647
01:54:54,581 --> 01:54:57,440
you have to adapt and you do a dot.
I know,

2648
01:54:57,470 --> 01:55:00,070
you know,
I'm hoping to tap tap fine,

2649
01:55:00,071 --> 01:55:00,904
but I'm just saying like playing a 
college and now you probably could do 

2650
01:55:02,831 --> 01:55:03,850
it,
but I don't think I could.

2651
01:55:03,880 --> 01:55:05,480
Of course she could.
Uh,

2652
01:55:05,860 --> 01:55:07,990
yeah.
You adapt in terms of doing a set.

2653
01:55:07,991 --> 01:55:09,280
You can,
you hate yourself,

2654
01:55:09,281 --> 01:55:11,170
that ride home,
you won't want to do that.

2655
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:12,213
What you'd want to just be able to do 
whatever you want to do and it would 

2656
01:55:13,991 --> 01:55:15,360
make you want to do it.
So,

2657
01:55:15,370 --> 01:55:18,400
so you're not gonna go push it.
Not Offensive or mean.

2658
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,170
Yeah.
You're not a bad person.

2659
01:55:20,170 --> 01:55:23,380
So they don't take that into account.
It's the words coming out of your mouth.

2660
01:55:23,381 --> 01:55:25,660
They taking them literally.
That's why we're in this state,

2661
01:55:25,661 --> 01:55:27,310
that we're in that.
Exactly.

2662
01:55:27,311 --> 01:55:28,144
That's what I'm saying.
I'll see the irony or the sarcasm in 

2663
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:30,703
that.
The sense of humor in this country has 

2664
01:55:31,391 --> 01:55:34,480
never been lower and I can say that as 
like what Jeff's talking about,

2665
01:55:34,481 --> 01:55:35,314
like when we were little kids like 
blazing saddles and a young 

2666
01:55:37,241 --> 01:55:40,270
Frankenstein,
these movies that everybody was watching

2667
01:55:40,271 --> 01:55:41,104
them enjoying them and stuff like that.
Now they have all these hidden and 

2668
01:55:43,501 --> 01:55:44,010
people look

2669
01:55:44,010 --> 01:55:45,480
into that and I'm like,
you know,

2670
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:49,740
it was just a fun time.
It was just like a fun experience.

2671
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:50,833
It was.
It wasn't like that was like the 

2672
01:55:51,991 --> 01:55:54,900
template for how to live.
You can bounce back,

2673
01:55:54,901 --> 01:55:55,734
but I think what's happening now is 
there's a certain number of people that 

2674
01:55:59,161 --> 01:55:59,994
want to be able to change the way other 
people talk and what they talk about 

2675
01:56:03,540 --> 01:56:04,373
because they are ultra sensitive so they
have this giant reaction to things that 

2676
01:56:08,161 --> 01:56:11,130
may or may not be relevant and it's a 
debate whether or not it's relevant.

2677
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:12,420
Some things we've changed,
right?

2678
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:16,140
Like certain words that used to be able 
to say easily just a few years ago,

2679
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:20,220
way hard to get away with saying now 
because the culture is shifting in a way

2680
01:56:20,221 --> 01:56:21,054
that's becoming more sensitive.
So probably that's good as long as they 

2681
01:56:23,551 --> 01:56:28,551
understand context and intent context 
and Mel Brooks,

2682
01:56:29,881 --> 01:56:32,340
because he used the n word 50 times in a
movie.

2683
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:33,480
Of course not.
Of course not.

2684
01:56:33,481 --> 01:56:35,640
It's a different time.
When my uncle Murray said,

2685
01:56:35,810 --> 01:56:36,740
you know,
I brought,

2686
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:43,060
when I brought a Chinese girlfriend home
to my pop jack and he's like,

2687
01:56:43,290 --> 01:56:46,770
east is east and West is west and never 
the two shall meet.

2688
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:49,740
We didn't kick my grandfather out of the
family.

2689
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:51,870
We just said character mine into 
Congress.

2690
01:56:51,960 --> 01:56:55,510
Listen,
guy grew up like we're watching.

2691
01:56:55,511 --> 01:56:58,290
We're that guy grew up in world war two.
Of course.

2692
01:56:58,291 --> 01:57:02,670
I mean that this no one could ever.
There's no way we're going to understand

2693
01:57:02,770 --> 01:57:05,550
that.
The difference in the way people saw the

2694
01:57:05,551 --> 01:57:08,640
world that had to deal with an actual 
world war two,

2695
01:57:08,641 --> 01:57:11,070
this soft pampered ass life we're 
living.

2696
01:57:11,580 --> 01:57:12,413
I don't condone racism,
but I understand why people hold 

2697
01:57:15,151 --> 01:57:15,984
grudges.
Right?

2698
01:57:16,770 --> 01:57:17,603
If you went over to Vietnam and lost 
half your fucking friends and you came 

2699
01:57:20,191 --> 01:57:22,320
back over here and you're fucked up 
still because of it.

2700
01:57:23,220 --> 01:57:24,053
I don't condone racism,
but I think that anytime you're forced 

2701
01:57:26,861 --> 01:57:30,510
into a situation where your country is 
at war with another side,

2702
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:33,090
it's probably really hard for people to 
forgive people.

2703
01:57:33,110 --> 01:57:33,931
Right.
You know?

2704
01:57:33,931 --> 01:57:34,440
I mean,
how.

2705
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,273
How hard is it?
That was one of the things that someone 

2706
01:57:36,361 --> 01:57:39,690
said about the Japanese and not really 
too thrilled with Americans and I said,

2707
01:57:39,691 --> 01:57:40,524
well,
how?

2708
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,433
How do you think you'd feel if you were 
showing up 40 years after someone had 

2709
01:57:45,511 --> 01:57:46,344
literally nuked your country twice,
just annihilated hundreds of thousands 

2710
01:57:51,931 --> 01:57:53,680
of people with one bomb.
I mean,

2711
01:57:53,690 --> 01:57:54,523
mean,
made shadows on the concrete of where 

2712
01:57:56,341 --> 01:57:59,100
someone's body used to be.
Just vaporize them.

2713
01:57:59,101 --> 01:58:00,000
Women,
children,

2714
01:58:00,001 --> 01:58:00,900
babies,
grandma,

2715
01:58:00,901 --> 01:58:02,220
grandpa,
everybody gets it.

2716
01:58:02,490 --> 01:58:03,930
Boom.
I mean,

2717
01:58:03,931 --> 01:58:05,520
who the fuck is going to be nice after 
that?

2718
01:58:05,680 --> 01:58:08,400
It takes a long time to forget that 
shit.

2719
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:11,130
Who is that baseball?
The Japanese baseball guy.

2720
01:58:11,630 --> 01:58:12,600
How are you?
Oh yeah.

2721
01:58:12,601 --> 01:58:13,434
That got to negotiate that into the 
contract and you've got to give me a 

2722
01:58:15,631 --> 01:58:20,631
little extra for Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Reparation little things.

2723
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:21,803
They did it twice.
America doesn't give itself enough shit 

2724
01:58:23,581 --> 01:58:27,360
for having the interment camps here.
I had been on one of those.

2725
01:58:27,361 --> 01:58:30,930
There's one up on a Washington state on 
Bainbridge island,

2726
01:58:31,510 --> 01:58:33,000
right?
There's one on Bainbridge island.

2727
01:58:33,001 --> 01:58:34,800
Really?
Bainbridge is beautiful.

2728
01:58:34,860 --> 01:58:37,470
I can't believe you to determine camp 
there,

2729
01:58:37,500 --> 01:58:41,980
doesn't Jesus?
We're not all and we got into that

2730
01:58:41,980 --> 01:58:42,880
war late,
man.

2731
01:58:42,881 --> 01:58:44,800
We don't give ourselves enough shit for 
that either.

2732
01:58:46,810 --> 01:58:47,960
Yeah.
Does it once in.

2733
01:58:48,200 --> 01:58:52,430
I'm the guy from Star Trek.
Yeah,

2734
01:58:52,490 --> 01:58:53,480
isn't,
wasn't he?

2735
01:58:53,510 --> 01:58:54,343
It was his name.

2736
01:58:54,770 --> 01:58:56,430
George George.
George Guy.

2737
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:59,680
He's a survivor.
He lived in a Japanese internment camp.

2738
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:04,220
It was a little kid and for FDR was 
president for four terms.

2739
01:59:04,370 --> 01:59:05,203
Isn't it crazy?
What's he really president for four 

2740
01:59:07,970 --> 01:59:08,803
term?
He died in a year and it was fourth 

2741
01:59:10,041 --> 01:59:11,380
term.
How can you share about that?

2742
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:12,223
Was it for three?
But it definitely was more than three 

2743
01:59:13,611 --> 01:59:15,530
and then he got elected and they stopped
after that.

2744
01:59:15,531 --> 01:59:17,050
They will like.
It can only be two,

2745
01:59:17,470 --> 01:59:18,410
but I bet you that are going to.

2746
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:21,280
Yeah.
That's amazing.

2747
01:59:21,310 --> 01:59:25,450
If you had a great president though,
like I want to keep doing this job.

2748
01:59:26,280 --> 01:59:28,690
Did that awesome.
CEO of Google,

2749
01:59:29,120 --> 01:59:31,870
like kicking ass.
Now you got to step it down,

2750
01:59:31,871 --> 01:59:33,520
Bro.
Only eight years,

2751
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:36,150
right?
It's like the only gig where when you're

2752
01:59:36,160 --> 01:59:37,960
really.
It has so much power.

2753
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:40,030
Really.
You just can't keep running this.

2754
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:43,120
You got to give up the reins.
Like everybody has to give up the reins.

2755
01:59:43,210 --> 01:59:45,340
We'd never let the best person to run it
forever.

2756
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:48,550
You would think once Clinton got ahead 
of steam under him,

2757
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,840
you know,
just feed is carnal desires and just

2758
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:54,420
quarterback.
You know,

2759
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:56,950
you're only gonna have a few good years.
Seasons.

2760
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:57,873
Right?
But how many years do you think the 

2761
01:59:59,231 --> 02:00:00,064
public would have kept him in?
Like say if you had a guy like Barack 

2762
02:00:02,890 --> 02:00:04,420
Obama,
how many years,

2763
02:00:04,450 --> 02:00:07,390
if they just let them go until he 
doesn't want to do it anymore,

2764
02:00:07,391 --> 02:00:08,830
until we don't want them to do it 
anymore.

2765
02:00:08,950 --> 02:00:10,720
How many years you think you keep doing 
it?

2766
02:00:10,990 --> 02:00:11,823
Man,
he might be able to do it for four or 

2767
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:13,713
five terms maybe more easily.
Especially if it showed that his 

2768
02:00:16,691 --> 02:00:17,524
policies were working.
Because you know a lot of these 

2769
02:00:18,641 --> 02:00:20,290
policies,
economic policies,

2770
02:00:20,291 --> 02:00:23,380
they take years in order to see real 
world benefits.

2771
02:00:23,940 --> 02:00:24,773
Look,
if you take the actual campaigning out 

2772
02:00:26,521 --> 02:00:27,360
of it,
you know,

2773
02:00:27,570 --> 02:00:28,403
they're really only president for two 
years because it's like they're 

2774
02:00:29,791 --> 02:00:30,624
campaigning on the way in and then the 
campaigning on the way out and it's 

2775
02:00:32,821 --> 02:00:33,481
like,
you know,

2776
02:00:33,481 --> 02:00:34,314
that's for all of our government and 
like we're all like I guess victims of 

2777
02:00:37,351 --> 02:00:38,930
that so sad,
but calender,

2778
02:00:39,060 --> 02:00:42,820
trying to explain it the other day about
the amount of time that a congressman or

2779
02:00:42,821 --> 02:00:43,654
senator or any politician spends raising
money versus the amount of time that 

2780
02:00:47,291 --> 02:00:49,960
they spend actually doing their job.
It's like it's not even close

2781
02:00:50,140 --> 02:00:52,750
and it's so humbling that their job is 
awesome.

2782
02:00:52,780 --> 02:00:53,613
We see them on cspan banging a gavel and
making a point and handing out a metal 

2783
02:00:57,791 --> 02:00:58,624
to a soldier and then you go see an 
actual political fundraiser and it's 

2784
02:01:02,191 --> 02:01:03,024
like boring.
It's like cory booker standing on a 

2785
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:06,273
basement floor at canter's on a Sunday 
morning and there's no glamor to it at 

2786
02:01:11,711 --> 02:01:12,420
all.
Now.

2787
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:16,970
They have the worst gig ever.
If I took you to,

2788
02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:18,263
if we were,
the three of us had to show up where 

2789
02:01:21,340 --> 02:01:23,350
politicians have to show up to raise 
money.

2790
02:01:23,530 --> 02:01:25,930
You'd be screaming at your age and 
going,

2791
02:01:25,931 --> 02:01:28,030
are you fucking kidding me with this 
microphone?

2792
02:01:28,031 --> 02:01:28,864
And there's no.
There's no lights and no one could hear 

2793
02:01:30,371 --> 02:01:33,950
me and I'm fucking talking to a wall.
There's no food.

2794
02:01:33,980 --> 02:01:36,140
Wouldn't starve.
That's like the worst.

2795
02:01:37,490 --> 02:01:42,490
That is a could see why anybody would do
this fricken job of,

2796
02:01:45,460 --> 02:01:48,470
of trying to.
I'm going to try to help people.

2797
02:01:48,590 --> 02:01:50,150
Fuck you.
We're going to expose.

2798
02:01:50,151 --> 02:01:53,130
You are going to beat you up.
We're going to go at all your busy,

2799
02:01:53,450 --> 02:01:54,283
you know.
But trump was the only one that did it 

2800
02:01:55,911 --> 02:01:58,580
with a built in giant audience right 
from the jump.

2801
02:01:59,140 --> 02:01:59,973
Like right from the jump.
He had a giant audience going crazy 

2802
02:02:02,541 --> 02:02:05,840
tours on our dime.
If Hillary right now,

2803
02:02:05,870 --> 02:02:09,770
real housewives instead of the Senate,
she would've been president.

2804
02:02:10,840 --> 02:02:13,130
She had just feed.
You mentioned seeing Hillary bill around

2805
02:02:13,131 --> 02:02:13,964
the house.

2806
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,760
Famous for just being a lady sort of 
being a politician.

2807
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:21,253
That's true.
She probably would have and in some 

2808
02:02:22,701 --> 02:02:23,241
ways,
right?

2809
02:02:23,241 --> 02:02:26,450
She was almost like hindered by the fact
that she was Bill Clinton's wife.

2810
02:02:27,050 --> 02:02:27,883
If she was just a,
a senator by herself with a lawyer who 

2811
02:02:31,491 --> 02:02:32,324
became a senator,
she probably would have way more of a 

2812
02:02:34,101 --> 02:02:36,020
shot of winning.
Same Person.

2813
02:02:36,650 --> 02:02:37,910
Right?
People always say,

2814
02:02:38,260 --> 02:02:39,290
you know,
what did bill,

2815
02:02:39,610 --> 02:02:42,650
what did trump do for the working man?
He entertained them.

2816
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:47,060
Like show is great.
People love that show.

2817
02:02:47,360 --> 02:02:52,340
It's true.
Don't you click on the stories first?

2818
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:53,980
You don't go to,
you know,

2819
02:02:54,030 --> 02:02:55,710
you're not reading about the,
the,

2820
02:02:55,870 --> 02:02:58,550
the genocide in Rwanda.
You're,

2821
02:02:58,560 --> 02:02:59,393
you're reading the trump,
like accidentally spelled something 

2822
02:03:02,151 --> 02:03:02,970
wrong.
Right?

2823
02:03:02,970 --> 02:03:04,710
From top news story.
That's our.

2824
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:05,553
Yeah.
Lately there's all these new charges 

2825
02:03:08,241 --> 02:03:09,074
have been brought up that I didn't know 
about and new people are getting 

2826
02:03:12,531 --> 02:03:14,150
arraigned and it's like,
it's a crazy.

2827
02:03:14,151 --> 02:03:16,850
It's like watching a crazy separate.
We have very short attention

2828
02:03:16,860 --> 02:03:19,560
that man in this country and like we,
we expect results,

2829
02:03:19,590 --> 02:03:20,423
you know?
And that's why in the new cycle the way 

2830
02:03:22,141 --> 02:03:23,070
it is now,
it's like,

2831
02:03:23,350 --> 02:03:24,090
you know,
you.

2832
02:03:24,090 --> 02:03:25,490
Have you ever been in a hotel where 
you'll watch,

2833
02:03:25,650 --> 02:03:26,483
like for some reason you're caught in 
like the three or four hour news cycle 

2834
02:03:30,001 --> 02:03:31,560
where you see the same story,
whatever,

2835
02:03:31,680 --> 02:03:32,513
and then there's like one more detail 
and then they'll start it up again and 

2836
02:03:35,521 --> 02:03:36,570
you're like,
wow,

2837
02:03:36,790 --> 02:03:37,623
you know,
I'm going to get a phone call because 

2838
02:03:39,031 --> 02:03:40,830
now I could be a panelist.
I know everything,

2839
02:03:40,831 --> 02:03:44,010
you know,
like we figured it out.

2840
02:03:44,011 --> 02:03:44,844
He was wearing shoes,
but I still watch TV news shows though 

2841
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:53,640
online.
Dave knows every show I love.

2842
02:03:53,641 --> 02:03:55,720
I love,
I like the um,

2843
02:03:55,950 --> 02:03:58,470
I,
I liked watching the whole day cycle,

2844
02:03:58,530 --> 02:03:59,460
you know,
like I,

2845
02:03:59,461 --> 02:04:00,294
I just think it's,
especially when it's something like an 

2846
02:04:02,161 --> 02:04:04,620
event that's happening and you get to 
see,

2847
02:04:04,860 --> 02:04:05,693
you know,
them figuring it out because they can't 

2848
02:04:07,231 --> 02:04:08,064
wait for,
to know this whole story now because he 

2849
02:04:09,211 --> 02:04:10,770
has to be immediate.
So you get,

2850
02:04:10,970 --> 02:04:12,570
you get to see them,
like started,

2851
02:04:12,630 --> 02:04:13,620
you know,
and it's like,

2852
02:04:13,710 --> 02:04:14,543
it's really like,
it's like going to journalism school 

2853
02:04:15,631 --> 02:04:16,231
almost,
you know,

2854
02:04:16,231 --> 02:04:16,830
like,
okay,

2855
02:04:16,830 --> 02:04:17,663
something bad happened here.
And then like they're working on their 

2856
02:04:19,801 --> 02:04:20,810
bits.
Yeah,

2857
02:04:21,060 --> 02:04:21,710
exactly.

2858
02:04:21,710 --> 02:04:24,320
They have to introduce them like right 
where breaking news,

2859
02:04:24,410 --> 02:04:25,243
breaking news.
We'd been told they don't know exactly 

2860
02:04:27,381 --> 02:04:28,280
what the fuck's going on.

2861
02:04:28,390 --> 02:04:29,680
That's definitely like,
you know,

2862
02:04:29,710 --> 02:04:30,543
my mom,
she has some memory issues and stuff 

2863
02:04:32,081 --> 02:04:34,000
like that,
but like waiting till 6:00

2864
02:04:34,001 --> 02:04:35,980
to find out what happened in the world,
you know,

2865
02:04:35,981 --> 02:04:38,010
like that's those days over.
Can you imagine if

2866
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:39,870
we did that?
Like that's a new rule,

2867
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:42,240
you know,
those days are over like a guy.

2868
02:04:42,290 --> 02:04:43,890
I remember when the.
I'm like,

2869
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:45,990
how did we get through the whole day?
Right.

2870
02:04:46,050 --> 02:04:48,450
How did we get to the door?
I remember when the challenger blew up,

2871
02:04:48,451 --> 02:04:50,520
what they used to do back in the day,
they would interrupt.

2872
02:04:50,760 --> 02:04:52,560
Yes.
And that was exciting.

2873
02:04:52,680 --> 02:04:53,670
Yes.
Big.

2874
02:04:54,060 --> 02:04:57,330
We have some terrible news and the world
of entertainment.

2875
02:04:57,331 --> 02:05:00,510
We have to pause the game.
Just to Howard.

2876
02:05:00,570 --> 02:05:01,403
I was sitting on the bed with my dad 
watching Monday night football and 

2877
02:05:04,261 --> 02:05:08,700
cosell just changes mood.
All of a sudden the music,

2878
02:05:08,970 --> 02:05:12,900
Beatles legend John Lennon and I thought
he said John,

2879
02:05:12,990 --> 02:05:16,710
Jack Lemon,
you know,

2880
02:05:16,740 --> 02:05:19,980
John Lennon was assassinated outside his
apartment.

2881
02:05:19,981 --> 02:05:21,080
And that's like,
yeah.

2882
02:05:21,110 --> 02:05:21,943
You remember broadcasting Howard cosell 
announcing something or when the moon 

2883
02:05:25,351 --> 02:05:29,150
launch took off.
There's no moment now where you're like,

2884
02:05:29,730 --> 02:05:32,170
oh,
I remember a certain members,

2885
02:05:32,210 --> 02:05:34,710
certain broadcast are announcing a 
certain thing.

2886
02:05:35,050 --> 02:05:36,150
No,
no.

2887
02:05:36,160 --> 02:05:39,180
You hear one version of it.
Then you hear so many versions of it.

2888
02:05:39,181 --> 02:05:40,014
You forget which one you heard first.
Like I remember when I saw that fell 

2889
02:05:43,750 --> 02:05:45,790
when I saw it the first time I saw it on
television.

2890
02:05:45,791 --> 02:05:47,890
I didn't know.
I don't know who said it.

2891
02:05:47,891 --> 02:05:50,200
I don't know who was giving the news 
cast.

2892
02:05:50,201 --> 02:05:52,090
It didn't,
doesn't even register.

2893
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:54,160
Just have to.
You just have to be believable.

2894
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:55,291
That was.
Yeah,

2895
02:05:55,291 --> 02:05:56,124
that was definitely a local news moment 
because I was in New York and my mom 

2896
02:05:58,051 --> 02:06:00,420
goes,
turn on the TV and then we could see the

2897
02:06:00,421 --> 02:06:02,080
coverage right there.
So was like,

2898
02:06:02,430 --> 02:06:05,040
that was before the web where you could 
go like,

2899
02:06:05,041 --> 02:06:06,840
okay,
I'm going to get deeper into this.

2900
02:06:06,841 --> 02:06:09,990
It was like waiting on the next bit of 
information.

2901
02:06:10,080 --> 02:06:10,913
So I was,
I was laying in bed in New York and I 

2902
02:06:13,291 --> 02:06:16,920
found out from the great newscaster,
Ralphie May,

2903
02:06:16,950 --> 02:06:17,280
who was

2904
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:19,770
screaming into my Edward,

2905
02:06:23,100 --> 02:06:26,180
he knew I was flying out of New York 
that day and he had,

2906
02:06:26,240 --> 02:06:28,750
he had,
he was in la and he's trying to,

2907
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:31,580
he's like Toronto and it was just him 
yelling to my answering machine.

2908
02:06:31,581 --> 02:06:32,414
It was like entered my dream and I kinda
heard sirens in the back of my dream 

2909
02:06:35,350 --> 02:06:36,183
cars.
They'll look ambulances running down 

2910
02:06:37,851 --> 02:06:42,110
Broadway and I turned it on just to see 
the second tower fall down.

2911
02:06:42,140 --> 02:06:45,440
And Ralphie,
he was my Walter Cronkite,

2912
02:06:46,380 --> 02:06:47,600
Ralphie,
ms dot that guy.

2913
02:06:48,580 --> 02:06:51,730
We lost a lot of good ones this year.
Sean rouse?

2914
02:06:52,330 --> 02:06:53,163
Yes.
Do you know Joe is a great opener of 

2915
02:06:55,031 --> 02:06:56,170
mine.
He was so funny,

2916
02:06:56,230 --> 02:06:57,280
man.
Great Guy.

2917
02:06:57,340 --> 02:07:00,400
I only saw them in weird places with 
Dave.

2918
02:07:01,490 --> 02:07:02,620
Like guys,
we're pals.

2919
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:03,790
Yeah,
he was really good.

2920
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:05,710
And um,
you know,

2921
02:07:06,130 --> 02:07:09,040
right out of Texas and uh,
he was such a good guy.

2922
02:07:09,250 --> 02:07:11,740
He was out of the Houston area,
Houston.

2923
02:07:11,770 --> 02:07:12,603
He was such a good,

2924
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:18,430
a lot of that old laptop in river oaks.
There was a lot of great comics.

2925
02:07:18,620 --> 02:07:19,453
Those local guys,
they had quality local comics like you 

2926
02:07:21,921 --> 02:07:22,754
would,
you would do a set there and the guys 

2927
02:07:23,951 --> 02:07:25,030
would open for you.
You'd be like,

2928
02:07:25,060 --> 02:07:26,560
Holy Shit,
you guys are funny.

2929
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:30,620
And do you remember like the whole myth 
of the Texas outlaws?

2930
02:07:30,630 --> 02:07:32,490
Like I used to eat that up.
I was like,

2931
02:07:32,491 --> 02:07:33,324
tell me another story.
I want to hear another story that was 

2932
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:36,850
Hixon Kennison

2933
02:07:36,910 --> 02:07:38,910
really low.
And,

2934
02:07:38,970 --> 02:07:39,730
and,
uh,

2935
02:07:39,730 --> 02:07:41,500
Jimmy Pineapple,
the pineapple.

2936
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:44,500
I worked with Jimmy Pineapple first time
I ever did that club there.

2937
02:07:44,530 --> 02:07:46,180
Great Guy.
Funny Dude too.

2938
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:48,480
Yeah,
those guys like Jefferson,

2939
02:07:48,570 --> 02:07:50,350
Jimmy,
Joe.

2940
02:07:50,720 --> 02:07:51,553
I never thought it could be pineapple.
I don't think I even heard of him until 

2941
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:55,210
funny dude.
He was one of the outlaws.

2942
02:07:55,230 --> 02:07:56,063
Early outlaws will shoot Schubert.
Schubert used to go on the road with 

2943
02:07:58,061 --> 02:07:59,270
them too.
You know,

2944
02:07:59,290 --> 02:08:02,650
Marin Marin was one of the guys that was
with them in town.

2945
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:03,693
I didn't know that.
I to become one of the Texas comedy 

2946
02:08:05,561 --> 02:08:07,180
outlaw.
How deep it was.

2947
02:08:07,181 --> 02:08:09,710
Like a group of these wild comics down 
in area.

2948
02:08:09,830 --> 02:08:11,870
There was Jimmy Pineapple looking guy.
Gloria,

2949
02:08:11,871 --> 02:08:15,340
small springish on microphone.
Funny Dude though.

2950
02:08:15,700 --> 02:08:17,290
I don't want to put in new stuff out 
there.

2951
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:20,640
Get a good guy though too.
I've worked with them.

2952
02:08:20,660 --> 02:08:22,390
Was Really Nice.
James sign up.

2953
02:08:22,780 --> 02:08:25,240
That was when I first worked at club.

2954
02:08:25,930 --> 02:08:26,763
I love that club.
That was one of the greatest rooms of 

2955
02:08:28,151 --> 02:08:28,984
all time,
man.

2956
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:29,980
I did my,
uh,

2957
02:08:30,010 --> 02:08:32,350
warner brothers cd there in 1999.
Wow.

2958
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,690
Yeah.
That fucking club was so hot.

2959
02:08:34,720 --> 02:08:36,940
It was packed.
Tight ceiling.

2960
02:08:36,941 --> 02:08:39,100
Wild motherfuckers,
Texas people.

2961
02:08:39,700 --> 02:08:43,270
Wild Texas Pete.
Just chaos.

2962
02:08:43,300 --> 02:08:45,340
Drinking good times.
Fun.

2963
02:08:45,341 --> 02:08:46,480
Nice.
People that are smart,

2964
02:08:46,810 --> 02:08:49,070
but they're also like to get fucked up.
Absolutely.

2965
02:08:49,090 --> 02:08:52,030
You in Texas this weekend?
I don't know where I am yet.

2966
02:08:52,120 --> 02:08:52,953
You don't know where you.
I'm waiting to hear on my schedule 

2967
02:08:56,110 --> 02:08:58,230
because you have a phone.
Exactly.

2968
02:08:58,240 --> 02:08:59,320
Yeah.
It's buffering.

2969
02:08:59,750 --> 02:09:02,380
But I actually took dave to a phone 
store.

2970
02:09:02,410 --> 02:09:03,520
Yeah.
You know,

2971
02:09:03,550 --> 02:09:07,570
we were preparing for the tapings and he
never texted me back and I'm like,

2972
02:09:07,870 --> 02:09:11,170
we're walking by this and I'm like,
just come in and look.

2973
02:09:11,560 --> 02:09:16,560
And he literally looks at the iphone 
like it's the enemy of the people.

2974
02:09:16,890 --> 02:09:20,710
It's the stain.
You have an iphone also.

2975
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:22,900
I got the guy goes,
you could do anything on this.

2976
02:09:22,901 --> 02:09:24,370
You could text,
you can make a point,

2977
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:27,040
you could do anything,
you can record your shows.

2978
02:09:27,370 --> 02:09:29,110
And Dave goes,
should we really play?

2979
02:09:29,111 --> 02:09:32,500
God?
I had a couple of good lines,

2980
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:35,740
but uh,
I don't go past an iphone too.

2981
02:09:35,900 --> 02:09:36,750
I feel like,
you know,

2982
02:09:36,850 --> 02:09:38,890
that's pushing it because now it's like 
up to 10,

2983
02:09:38,950 --> 02:09:40,360
right?
You have an iphone too,

2984
02:09:40,480 --> 02:09:41,140
like,
yeah.

2985
02:09:41,140 --> 02:09:45,010
How many are,
how many articles compared to Jv burst?

2986
02:09:45,130 --> 02:09:47,860
How many iphones compared to how many 
rocky movies are there?

2987
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:51,143
Rocky movies are there now.
[inaudible] name is Hobie rockies 

2988
02:09:54,250 --> 02:09:57,310
because now we have d dos creeds.
The second thing act now,

2989
02:09:57,360 --> 02:10:01,300
like I say it is because it's working 
off of the actual narrative of rocky.

2990
02:10:01,610 --> 02:10:04,210
Do you hear Michael b?
Jordan is talking about boxing.

2991
02:10:04,211 --> 02:10:05,710
Roy Jones Jr.
Yeah.

2992
02:10:05,711 --> 02:10:07,870
I thought that was a cool kind of hope.
It's a joke.

2993
02:10:07,871 --> 02:10:09,580
Just straight up boxing and not like a 
meu moitai.

2994
02:10:09,700 --> 02:10:11,500
Listen,
don't do that michael.

2995
02:10:11,590 --> 02:10:14,950
Just don't do that.
I'm sure he's a great athlete.

2996
02:10:15,010 --> 02:10:17,260
He's a beautiful kid.
Has got a great bodY.

2997
02:10:17,261 --> 02:10:19,390
It looks like he knows how to box when 
he throws punches.

2998
02:10:19,391 --> 02:10:21,160
It looks like you really actually knows 
how to box.

2999
02:10:21,161 --> 02:10:23,770
I'm sure he's a really good athlete and 
it's built like a brick shithouse,

3000
02:10:23,800 --> 02:10:27,330
but boxing.
Roy jones jr is a pastor.

3001
02:10:27,370 --> 02:10:32,170
Someone that had to get hit upside.
You'll never work again or you'll become

3002
02:10:32,171 --> 02:10:32,721
a box.
Yeah.

3003
02:10:32,721 --> 02:10:34,010
You hang in there with them and you

3004
02:10:34,010 --> 02:10:35,530
look like your hero.
Me.

3005
02:10:35,531 --> 02:10:37,820
You clip them and hurt him.
I mean it is.

3006
02:10:38,330 --> 02:10:40,650
It is a humanly possible thing,
right?

3007
02:10:40,670 --> 02:10:41,503
Like when two people throwing punches at
each other that one of them could hit 

3008
02:10:43,311 --> 02:10:47,430
the other guy,
but the downside is ruined.

3009
02:10:47,510 --> 02:10:48,343
Boy jones is one of the greatest boxers 
of all time and still to this day knows 

3010
02:10:55,221 --> 02:10:59,090
how to box.
it's not like he forgot he's pushing 50,

3011
02:10:59,390 --> 02:11:00,420
49.
Yeah,

3012
02:11:00,740 --> 02:11:03,330
he's pushing 50.
If you think somebody,

3013
02:11:03,570 --> 02:11:07,370
someone who's like deal with it.
I think it was just talking shit.

3014
02:11:07,371 --> 02:11:10,790
He was just probably being asked like 
who would you like to box?

3015
02:11:10,791 --> 02:11:14,090
Who is your hero and how many rounds to 
go certain amount.

3016
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:16,100
What exactly happened?
He said he would.

3017
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:18,260
He asked them,
who would you want to fight today?

3018
02:11:18,261 --> 02:11:19,280
And he said,
Roy Jones,

3019
02:11:19,281 --> 02:11:22,630
he would probably beat me in his prime,
but I'd probably find them today.

3020
02:11:22,820 --> 02:11:25,040
It's probably just like that is an 
outrageous thing to say.

3021
02:11:25,100 --> 02:11:27,560
Just an asshole thing to say.
George foreman.

3022
02:11:27,590 --> 02:11:28,423
Listen,
he probably would kill you in his prime 

3023
02:11:30,920 --> 02:11:34,070
when the idea that he would just beat 
you mean Roy Jones jr.

3024
02:11:34,071 --> 02:11:37,010
When he was in his prime,
you would Just waiting to see.

3025
02:11:37,011 --> 02:11:37,844
He was a nas song.
they said Roy Jones is in the new mike 

3026
02:11:41,091 --> 02:11:43,070
tyson's Roy Jones.
It's in.

3027
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:47,990
This is like in the 19 nineties.
People forgot how good Roy Jones jr was.

3028
02:11:48,080 --> 02:11:51,110
He was putting his hands behind his back
and then knocking people out.

3029
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:53,900
He was doing ridiculous shit.
Knocked out light heavyweight champion.

3030
02:11:53,901 --> 02:11:57,980
Virgil hit with a body shot to hear it 
so we can hear the context.

3031
02:11:58,020 --> 02:11:59,170
Okay,
sure.

3032
02:11:59,740 --> 02:12:00,573
Let's listen to it.

3033
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:03,980
I heard that you,
after all your training for the creed,

3034
02:12:04,620 --> 02:12:07,400
you can hold your own in a fight thing a
little bit.

3035
02:12:07,470 --> 02:12:09,310
You know what?
I've been working out with rocky,

3036
02:12:09,311 --> 02:12:10,240
but we're going out with like,
you know,

3037
02:12:10,241 --> 02:12:11,600
saying like apollo creed.
I'M going to go up.

3038
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:13,233
Absolutely.
So now who all time would you want to 

3039
02:12:15,551 --> 02:12:17,110
step into the rooM with?
But there's a boxer,

3040
02:12:17,120 --> 02:12:20,200
a wrestler by Roy Jones,
bro.

3041
02:12:20,860 --> 02:12:23,820
That's my dude.
I can do my thing a little bit.

3042
02:12:23,821 --> 02:12:24,491
Yeah,
that whoLe monthly.

3043
02:12:24,491 --> 02:12:26,110
Right now it's prime now.
Hip hop.

3044
02:12:26,111 --> 02:12:28,060
It knocked my esl,
but like right now I can do one thing.

3045
02:12:28,920 --> 02:12:29,753
Why answer that question?
He was a show where you funnier than 

3046
02:12:33,701 --> 02:12:38,590
george carlin and his prime.
Can you just answer that right now?

3047
02:12:38,591 --> 02:12:39,424
Since he did?
I know you've had a few drinks and the 

3048
02:12:40,571 --> 02:12:44,340
restaurant and take some right now.
I'm on coke.

3049
02:12:44,550 --> 02:12:46,930
Coke.
Let me answer some questions.

3050
02:12:47,970 --> 02:12:52,690
Roy jones jr said he was trading with 
rocky.

3051
02:12:52,750 --> 02:12:54,230
That was the best part.
And apollo creed,

3052
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:57,100
you know their names and he doesn't know
that old dude.

3053
02:12:57,101 --> 02:12:58,300
The old dude,
the black guy,

3054
02:12:58,301 --> 02:13:01,690
the black guy.
Black panther too.

3055
02:13:01,750 --> 02:13:03,460
He's awesoMe.
Plays a good superhero.

3056
02:13:03,490 --> 02:13:05,380
He's a great guy.
I love his movies.

3057
02:13:05,560 --> 02:13:07,770
He was a good bad guy in that movie.
But you know,

3058
02:13:07,850 --> 02:13:08,683
it's like,
just shouldn't answer that just made a 

3059
02:13:11,411 --> 02:13:12,550
mistake,
you know,

3060
02:13:12,760 --> 02:13:13,780
young,
cocky,

3061
02:13:14,230 --> 02:13:15,530
full life.
Look,

3062
02:13:15,590 --> 02:13:18,070
everything's going well now.
and again,

3063
02:13:18,250 --> 02:13:21,310
built like a goddamn superhero.
Probably thinks he could box the world.

3064
02:13:21,880 --> 02:13:24,670
There's Just a different thing that's 
going to be happening if you're standing

3065
02:13:24,671 --> 02:13:26,860
in front of Roy Jones jr,
it's a different thing.

3066
02:13:26,950 --> 02:13:27,440
He's,
yeah,

3067
02:13:27,440 --> 02:13:32,040
he's got a computer that's many,
many times more robust

3068
02:13:32,070 --> 02:13:34,770
than yours when it comes to box,
it's just taking the punishment.

3069
02:13:34,771 --> 02:13:35,521
It's not like,
you know,

3070
02:13:35,521 --> 02:13:36,151
it's like,
okay,

3071
02:13:36,151 --> 02:13:36,984
that's enough.
It gives you a concussion and you never 

3072
02:13:39,901 --> 02:13:41,370
act again.
What's the upside for?

3073
02:13:41,371 --> 02:13:44,160
You can tee up on the way a 50 year old 
boxer.

3074
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:46,200
It looks at this actor,
pretty boy.

3075
02:13:46,201 --> 02:13:47,340
And it's like,
uh,

3076
02:13:47,490 --> 02:13:49,050
when they bought that,
when they broke,

3077
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:50,730
um,
what's his name?

3078
02:13:50,731 --> 02:13:52,350
Out of the box and pulp fiction.

3079
02:13:52,730 --> 02:13:54,410
Yeah.
I mean he's jack though.

3080
02:13:54,411 --> 02:13:58,430
Look at them to them seriously.
But see,

3081
02:13:58,431 --> 02:13:59,264
the thing is like,
there's such a giant difference between 

3082
02:14:02,061 --> 02:14:04,780
learning how to box and being a good 
athlete.

3083
02:14:04,910 --> 02:14:07,490
He clearly is.
And being Roy Jones jr,

3084
02:14:07,680 --> 02:14:10,250
the,
the gap is so wide.

3085
02:14:10,280 --> 02:14:14,030
It's so,
it's like if I did a movie about playing

3086
02:14:14,031 --> 02:14:16,590
basketball and then I wanted to,
you know,

3087
02:14:16,610 --> 02:14:18,370
play a one on one versus coby.
Brian,

3088
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:19,630
you'll have been planning this movie for
a couple of.

3089
02:14:21,020 --> 02:14:24,720
I'm feeling good even though I never did
any competitive basketball player.

3090
02:14:25,050 --> 02:14:27,410
You were in the white shadow.
It's like He got beat up.

3091
02:14:27,411 --> 02:14:30,100
It's like he's,
he's a movie star brown.

3092
02:14:30,140 --> 02:14:33,290
He's got fake blood on his whelks that 
was in the movie.

3093
02:14:33,580 --> 02:14:35,290
I'm sure he knows how to throw his 
hands.

3094
02:14:35,291 --> 02:14:37,150
I'm sure he does.
He looks good in the movies.

3095
02:14:37,151 --> 02:14:38,380
He looks like he really knows what he's 
doing.

3096
02:14:38,770 --> 02:14:41,980
but Roy Jones jr is one of the greatest 
of all time.

3097
02:14:42,190 --> 02:14:43,023
He was a female.
He knows how to box in a way that you 

3098
02:14:46,301 --> 02:14:49,420
never going to understand.
So how long has he been simply boxed?

3099
02:14:49,510 --> 02:14:50,343
Ten years.
I mean Roy Jones had a fight within the 

3100
02:14:52,061 --> 02:14:55,900
last two years.
I think his last fight was,

3101
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:58,120
I wanna say it was two less than two 
years ago.

3102
02:14:59,020 --> 02:15:01,570
I think he retired.
He had a bunch of fights over in Russia.

3103
02:15:01,571 --> 02:15:05,530
He actually became a russian citizen.
Is that it?

3104
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:08,110
This year?
Jesus christ place some of it.

3105
02:15:08,700 --> 02:15:11,530
Play.
He's a retired boxer.

3106
02:15:11,810 --> 02:15:14,890
Challenging a box.
Fucking Roy Jones jr.

3107
02:15:14,891 --> 02:15:17,830
All right.
Just this is a different thing.

3108
02:15:17,831 --> 02:15:18,664
It's one thing if you're like a top 
level pro right now and you feel like 

3109
02:15:21,941 --> 02:15:23,850
you would have got knocked out by ryan 
is probably,

3110
02:15:23,851 --> 02:15:25,270
but you can give them a goal right now.
Okay.

3111
02:15:25,271 --> 02:15:26,310
that I.
That is.

3112
02:15:26,430 --> 02:15:28,980
That's believable.
You're a professional boxer.

3113
02:15:28,990 --> 02:15:32,800
You've been honing your craft in the gym
for years and years.

3114
02:15:32,950 --> 02:15:34,960
You've been sparring and work with high 
level coaches.

3115
02:15:34,961 --> 02:15:37,570
Look at him.
He's still Roy Jones jr.

3116
02:15:39,280 --> 02:15:41,610
Still Roy Jones jr.
Even though he's 40,

3117
02:15:42,410 --> 02:15:46,180
it doesn't matter if he's boxing one's a
boxer,

3118
02:15:46,810 --> 02:15:50,260
but Roy Jones is in a boxing match here 
and he's looking good.

3119
02:15:50,890 --> 02:15:51,723
I mean,
he's obviously not fighting a guy who's 

3120
02:15:53,200 --> 02:15:54,033
the best.

3121
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:56,920
Roy jones jr.
Do you call your your agent right now?

3122
02:15:58,470 --> 02:16:00,060
Serious.
What's the money?

3123
02:16:00,370 --> 02:16:01,920
He's already been doing all these 
interviews.

3124
02:16:01,930 --> 02:16:02,381
Just said,
look,

3125
02:16:02,381 --> 02:16:04,090
I don't want to get out of bed early in 
the morning,

3126
02:16:04,091 --> 02:16:06,070
but if you know,
if he wants to really do this,

3127
02:16:06,071 --> 02:16:06,904
we could do this.
I think it'd be a wonderful opportunity 

3128
02:16:10,511 --> 02:16:11,920
to show people what boxing is.
Oh,

3129
02:16:11,921 --> 02:16:14,170
let me see what he said.
I would love to see that here.

3130
02:16:14,290 --> 02:16:17,710
Let's see what roy says.
Of course I saw the video.

3131
02:16:18,680 --> 02:16:23,180
Birthing is a duct to fight in my life.
NothIng right now.

3132
02:16:24,470 --> 02:16:29,470
Hurricane to come down here so ain't 
nobody real content

3133
02:16:31,240 --> 02:16:34,950
and we will make happen.
You got my number.

3134
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:38,480
He can cut you and get my number.
So there's no question about high.

3135
02:16:42,770 --> 02:16:43,820
No.
From tmc.

3136
02:16:44,040 --> 02:16:44,873
The list may happen

3137
02:16:44,930 --> 02:16:46,400
right now.
He said in the video,

3138
02:16:46,401 --> 02:16:49,250
he said,
I think he would probably have killed me

3139
02:16:49,251 --> 02:16:53,170
back in his prime.
That's true though.

3140
02:16:53,660 --> 02:16:57,550
Do you actually many kids beat you now 
even though you are 49 boy.

3141
02:16:58,610 --> 02:17:01,400
No,
you can't beat me still because I mean I

3142
02:17:01,401 --> 02:17:03,410
know he's probably a better condition 
because he's younger.

3143
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:06,680
He probably think he can go longer and 
probably thinks he might be able to even

3144
02:17:06,681 --> 02:17:10,640
at working now,
but I'm a bit old.

3145
02:17:11,030 --> 02:17:15,210
School ain't going out like that to me.
I love you.

3146
02:17:15,220 --> 02:17:17,830
Understand me.
So opened unstable box.

3147
02:17:17,880 --> 02:17:18,713
We'll just take them out right away 
because then you don't get the 

3148
02:17:21,051 --> 02:17:23,900
experience with box.
I'm a professional like I am,

3149
02:17:24,320 --> 02:17:26,570
and I know you big and strong because 
you've got strong for the movie.

3150
02:17:26,990 --> 02:17:28,670
Then I should be able to avoid all of 
that.

3151
02:17:29,350 --> 02:17:30,183
Take them into deep water so you 
understand what a boxing match release 

3152
02:17:32,720 --> 02:17:34,430
comes out.
He don't want to say,

3153
02:17:34,431 --> 02:17:35,120
oh,
I've got.

3154
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:36,360
No,
no,

3155
02:17:36,490 --> 02:17:36,801
no,
no,

3156
02:17:36,801 --> 02:17:39,500
no.
I'm a nice five,

3157
02:17:39,501 --> 02:17:40,334
six rounds.
So I want you to see how it really 

3158
02:17:41,691 --> 02:17:42,524
feels.
So that's why I'm talking like that now 

3159
02:17:43,900 --> 02:17:46,490
because I think he can really match my 
skills.

3160
02:17:46,491 --> 02:17:48,230
I really don't even that for tonight.

3161
02:17:48,310 --> 02:17:51,760
How long would you need to get right to 
where you could step in there?

3162
02:17:51,761 --> 02:17:52,594
Like,
what's the soonest we could make this 

3163
02:17:53,291 --> 02:17:54,124
fight happen?

3164
02:17:54,740 --> 02:17:55,573
Uh,
probably for him about four or five 

3165
02:17:58,531 --> 02:17:59,364
weeks.

3166
02:18:02,270 --> 02:18:03,800
Michael,
please listen to me.

3167
02:18:03,980 --> 02:18:05,840
Don't do this.
Someone called stubhub.

3168
02:18:05,870 --> 02:18:07,110
Just don't do this,
do this.

3169
02:18:07,170 --> 02:18:09,770
This is not gonna work out well,
especially if they're,

3170
02:18:10,160 --> 02:18:12,380
I would assume both of them are not 
going to be drug tested.

3171
02:18:13,940 --> 02:18:16,100
I don't think either one of them wants 
to pee in a bucket.

3172
02:18:16,930 --> 02:18:21,930
If they just let roy,
they let roy go to dr feelgood,

3173
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:24,800
pump them up with hormones.
This is going to be a route.

3174
02:18:24,830 --> 02:18:28,790
This would be terrifying.
I imagine getting a call from his agent,

3175
02:18:28,820 --> 02:18:30,530
hey,
we have an offer for you to do this,

3176
02:18:30,531 --> 02:18:32,720
like new superhero movie.
It's gonna be amazing,

3177
02:18:32,760 --> 02:18:33,920
and michael is like,
ah,

3178
02:18:34,010 --> 02:18:37,520
I'm booked that whole five weeks,
five weeks.

3179
02:18:37,521 --> 02:18:39,200
I got to train for Roy Jones jr,
like,

3180
02:18:39,201 --> 02:18:40,034
don't do it,
but this is a new genre of tv show of 

3181
02:18:43,161 --> 02:18:43,994
the real guy versus the guy playing.
Want to see doctors against guys who 

3182
02:18:48,711 --> 02:18:52,750
played a dr alessi astronauts against 
guys who was picked or an astronaut.

3183
02:18:52,820 --> 02:18:55,270
I want to see it all.
Navy seals,

3184
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:58,840
navy dinosaur versus chicken.
I want to say it.

3185
02:18:58,841 --> 02:18:59,674
Isn't that what mark walberg side,
if he was on the plane with five versus 

3186
02:19:03,081 --> 02:19:04,460
city,
did he really say that though?

3187
02:19:04,850 --> 02:19:08,060
That's what everybody says.
I never heard him say the things.

3188
02:19:08,220 --> 02:19:09,670
Think a crazy thing.

3189
02:19:09,740 --> 02:19:10,573
Thank you.
Know who knows what the fuck you would 

3190
02:19:13,521 --> 02:19:16,100
do if you thought that you were just 
going to land somewhere.

3191
02:19:16,860 --> 02:19:17,693
Now that's the idea is that you knew 
what was gonna happen before it 

3192
02:19:19,401 --> 02:19:20,810
happened.
Nobody knows about.

3193
02:19:20,811 --> 02:19:21,621
Well,
that shit's going down.

3194
02:19:21,621 --> 02:19:24,110
Someone's got box cutters.
They were holding the waitress.

3195
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:25,790
They're holding a stewardess by the 
neck,

3196
02:19:25,791 --> 02:19:27,950
like you know,
you don't know what fuck's happening.

3197
02:19:27,980 --> 02:19:31,260
You have no idea what's going on.
You're afraid to move and you know,

3198
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:33,230
I'm sure that a lot of people would step
up,

3199
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:36,350
but you know,
it could potentially cost that person in

3200
02:19:36,351 --> 02:19:40,700
their life and then when the plane 
lands,

3201
02:19:40,970 --> 02:19:43,670
that person's dead when they may be.
If you don't know,

3202
02:19:43,730 --> 02:19:45,200
right?
You don't know the actual scenario.

3203
02:19:45,201 --> 02:19:48,410
Now obviously we know was a horrible 
thing and you should do whatever you can

3204
02:19:48,411 --> 02:19:50,750
to stop them because they're going to 
kill everybody no matter what.

3205
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:52,670
But back then you didn't know what I 
mean.

3206
02:19:52,671 --> 02:19:55,460
If someone just took the plane and 
landed in the stewardess,

3207
02:19:56,280 --> 02:19:58,460
he would be like,
glad I didn't do anything.

3208
02:19:58,490 --> 02:20:01,100
She jumped up and he cut her face off.
You know,

3209
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:05,540
it's like in those moments when you 
don't know what's going to happen to.

3210
02:20:05,750 --> 02:20:07,730
I was on that plane.
Okay.

3211
02:20:08,230 --> 02:20:11,150
With my kids,
the window went down like it did.

3212
02:20:11,590 --> 02:20:14,720
That would have been a lot of blood in 
that first class cabin.

3213
02:20:14,721 --> 02:20:15,860
Then me saying,
okay,

3214
02:20:15,861 --> 02:20:18,230
we're going to land somewhere safely.
Don't worry.

3215
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:22,660
Know that.
See I,

3216
02:20:22,970 --> 02:20:24,710
I see where he's coming from.
Right?

3217
02:20:24,770 --> 02:20:26,810
He's got a.
He's got kids that he loves.

3218
02:20:26,811 --> 02:20:29,060
He's got a family that he loves.
He wouldn't have said still.

3219
02:20:29,150 --> 02:20:30,290
That's what he's saying.
Yeah.

3220
02:20:30,800 --> 02:20:31,633
That's what you're saying.
And then in his mind he probably has 

3221
02:20:32,961 --> 02:20:33,794
that conviction.
Even if it meant the thing that winning 

3222
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:38,470
everybody's life,
would you know,

3223
02:20:38,480 --> 02:20:40,720
would it work if it didn't work?

3224
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:42,590
Like what do they have?
Do you know what they have?

3225
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:43,420
You know,
they don't know.

3226
02:20:43,420 --> 02:20:45,260
You don't have a box cutter.
They have anything else?

3227
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:47,380
How many of them are there?
You don't know.

3228
02:20:48,080 --> 02:20:50,330
Is anybody going to back you up?
Does anybody else know how to fight?

3229
02:20:51,320 --> 02:20:52,640
You know,
you could get fucked up.

3230
02:20:52,641 --> 02:20:53,474
You could.
You could step up thinking you'Re billy 

3231
02:20:54,981 --> 02:20:55,814
bad ass and this guy is some train the 
trainers who smashes your face in and 

3232
02:21:01,070 --> 02:21:03,920
cuts you up with a box cutter that could
happen to.

3233
02:21:03,921 --> 02:21:06,740
It still pulls his belt off the planet.
You could.

3234
02:21:06,950 --> 02:21:10,100
Who the fuck knows matt the.
That's why there's professionals,

3235
02:21:10,101 --> 02:21:11,570
right?
That's where there's professional.

3236
02:21:11,571 --> 02:21:15,920
Those air marshals can assess the 
situation and figure out and obviously,

3237
02:21:15,950 --> 02:21:16,783
you know,
they weren't either they weren't there 

3238
02:21:18,411 --> 02:21:19,730
on that plane or they couldn't help.

3239
02:21:19,940 --> 02:21:22,220
I was thinking about if I was in that 
position,

3240
02:21:22,230 --> 02:21:23,030
I'd,
you know,

3241
02:21:23,030 --> 02:21:24,020
how could you.
I mean,

3242
02:21:24,021 --> 02:21:25,760
who the fuck knows what you would do?
Well,

3243
02:21:25,761 --> 02:21:29,910
since I look like I'm on the other team,
I would've said my friends.

3244
02:21:34,410 --> 02:21:38,540
Fuck,
come on,

3245
02:21:38,541 --> 02:21:39,570
get up and do your.
I'm like,

3246
02:21:39,571 --> 02:21:42,020
I'm not part of the team.
Do your foreign guy.

3247
02:21:43,010 --> 02:21:45,650
Fuck man.
Yeah.

3248
02:21:45,651 --> 02:21:46,620
You'd be,
you know,

3249
02:21:46,880 --> 02:21:49,520
I've never been so scared that you're 
frozen instance for a second.

3250
02:21:50,110 --> 02:21:50,891
Oh yeah,
yeah.

3251
02:21:50,891 --> 02:21:51,724
I mean you,
you can't know what the right thing to 

3252
02:21:54,111 --> 02:21:57,230
do is in the wrong thing.
Could be so catastrophic.

3253
02:21:57,231 --> 02:21:58,064
Right.

3254
02:22:00,930 --> 02:22:01,763
As far as to say that he's making 
announcements on the plane and this is 

3255
02:22:05,471 --> 02:22:09,340
all happening like brittle landing safe,
like he's now the pilot in the movies,

3256
02:22:11,020 --> 02:22:12,880
right?
That's true movie.

3257
02:22:12,881 --> 02:22:15,010
You get to grant the intercom at the end
and go,

3258
02:22:15,011 --> 02:22:16,980
thanks for flying solo and solera.

3259
02:22:17,050 --> 02:22:17,883
Sometimes you say things like that 
because that's how you feel and you 

3260
02:22:19,871 --> 02:22:21,640
don't think about how other people are 
going to perceive it.

3261
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:23,380
That's what I would assume that 
statement is.

3262
02:22:23,381 --> 02:22:25,230
It's kind of how he felt like,
fuck that.

3263
02:22:25,231 --> 02:22:28,440
I'm landing this fucking plane.
I'm killing the fucking terrorists.

3264
02:22:28,490 --> 02:22:28,990
Yeah,

3265
02:22:28,990 --> 02:22:30,520
that's what he told his kids one night.

3266
02:22:30,690 --> 02:22:31,523
The problem is you're saying that to 
billions of people and billions of 

3267
02:22:33,961 --> 02:22:35,310
people hear that and they go,
what?

3268
02:22:36,040 --> 02:22:38,700
And then all these people get to assess 
your.

3269
02:22:38,701 --> 02:22:41,670
Your statement whether or not it has any
makes any sense.

3270
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:43,320
Like what are you going to do?
You can kick everybody's ass.

3271
02:22:43,820 --> 02:22:45,630
Okay,
sure.

3272
02:22:47,480 --> 02:22:48,313
I know a lot of dudes who,
if they were there and you try to do 

3273
02:22:50,221 --> 02:22:51,450
that,
you'd get smashed.

3274
02:22:51,770 --> 02:22:55,140
Like they're scary people in this world 
than weapons on him.

3275
02:22:56,430 --> 02:22:58,230
I would assume.
If you're ready to die like that,

3276
02:22:58,231 --> 02:22:59,064
you have a very strange kind of 
conviction to if you know you're ready 

3277
02:23:02,311 --> 02:23:06,180
to die and you know how to fight like 
woo Jesus.

3278
02:23:06,830 --> 02:23:08,490
I don't mean who knows,
but it's

3279
02:23:09,810 --> 02:23:10,643
Just

3280
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:12,770
the idea that you would have to think 
about it.

3281
02:23:13,040 --> 02:23:14,690
That's what's really terrifying.
What do you mean?

3282
02:23:14,720 --> 02:23:16,730
The idea that you would have to think 
like,

3283
02:23:16,731 --> 02:23:18,980
what do I do if something is someone 
does.

3284
02:23:18,981 --> 02:23:19,520
Hi,

3285
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:20,860
don't we all think that?
Yeah.

3286
02:23:21,110 --> 02:23:21,943
Every,
every situation now there's what we do 

3287
02:23:24,720 --> 02:23:25,553
do.
Do.

3288
02:23:26,170 --> 02:23:27,003
Do you hear people run and they survive 
and people run and get shot down and 

3289
02:23:30,611 --> 02:23:35,420
they go to the wrong way.
Anytime a tragedy like that happen,

3290
02:23:35,490 --> 02:23:36,323
like what the fuck?
Horrific random Set of sequences and 

3291
02:23:40,601 --> 02:23:41,710
you're in the wrong spot.

3292
02:23:42,610 --> 02:23:44,080
You can do the right.
Heroic.

3293
02:23:44,110 --> 02:23:47,320
How about how many people must do the 
heroic thing and then you die anyway.

3294
02:23:47,321 --> 02:23:48,910
You never know about it.
Oh,

3295
02:23:48,911 --> 02:23:49,744
for sure.
I wonder what uncle steve did in that 

3296
02:23:51,491 --> 02:23:52,360
situation.
Yeah.

3297
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:55,230
Wow.
Yeah.

3298
02:23:56,770 --> 02:23:57,603
That's a lot of.
It seems like those fucking things are 

3299
02:24:00,431 --> 02:24:04,400
happening more and more lately.
It is.

3300
02:24:04,580 --> 02:24:08,410
Is the rate more accelerated now than 
it's ever been before,

3301
02:24:08,411 --> 02:24:10,750
as well as the numbers of these 
shootings and shit.

3302
02:24:13,710 --> 02:24:14,850
Sorry,
what is happening?

3303
02:24:14,970 --> 02:24:17,550
Like what the fuck is going on that this
keeps happening?

3304
02:24:17,560 --> 02:24:20,820
If they happened like every couple of 
days there's like a little one,

3305
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:22,440
like a two or three people.
One,

3306
02:24:22,710 --> 02:24:24,150
she's like not that big a deal anymore.

3307
02:24:24,630 --> 02:24:27,540
Well that's what it was when it was 
about knives and swords.

3308
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:31,260
People would go on a killing spree,
but now it's,

3309
02:24:31,500 --> 02:24:36,450
You kill more people and you know,
not everybody would die with a knife.

3310
02:24:39,590 --> 02:24:41,450
London.
And as a bunch of knife attacks,

3311
02:24:42,200 --> 02:24:44,410
london has so many knife attacks that 
their uh,

3312
02:24:44,810 --> 02:24:45,643
their,
their murder rate exceeded New York 

3313
02:24:47,841 --> 02:24:50,190
city's murder rate with just knives.
Wow.

3314
02:24:50,800 --> 02:24:52,330
Oh,
google that.

3315
02:24:52,370 --> 02:24:54,260
Make sure that true.
The machete attack,

3316
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:57,650
the fucking president or the mayor of 
president,

3317
02:24:57,651 --> 02:25:01,070
the mayor of london saying something 
that they won't tolerate knives anymore.

3318
02:25:01,400 --> 02:25:04,400
Can't have knives.
Sounds sounds better.

3319
02:25:04,490 --> 02:25:05,440
I know,
but everybody's like that

3320
02:25:05,830 --> 02:25:06,663
in New York know knives.
You have a guy who's a off his meds and 

3321
02:25:09,281 --> 02:25:11,410
he's just like walking around with a 
hammer.

3322
02:25:11,440 --> 02:25:12,790
you know.
So it could happen,

3323
02:25:12,820 --> 02:25:14,560
it doesn't really matter what the weapon
is.

3324
02:25:15,020 --> 02:25:15,853
Okay.
London has overtaken New York for 

3325
02:25:17,121 --> 02:25:18,800
murders for the first time in modern 
history,

3326
02:25:18,801 --> 02:25:21,830
after a surge of knife crime's across 
the capital verdict,

3327
02:25:21,831 --> 02:25:24,070
though selective of statistics

3328
02:25:24,070 --> 02:25:26,680
from the start of 2018 appeared to bear 
this out.

3329
02:25:26,681 --> 02:25:30,250
But the reality is that New York still 
appears to be more violent than london.

3330
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,550
Yes,
that was written.

3331
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:35,770
It was written by a new yorker,
New York,

3332
02:25:35,771 --> 02:25:36,990
and back.
Right now,

3333
02:25:36,991 --> 02:25:38,520
man,
New York is on fire.

3334
02:25:38,550 --> 02:25:40,020
It's great.
We love it.

3335
02:25:40,021 --> 02:25:43,470
It's great.
I haven't been there as much in the last

3336
02:25:43,470 --> 02:25:44,303
few weeks,
but when I'm there and all summer I was 

3337
02:25:45,091 --> 02:25:46,320
there.
It's,

3338
02:25:47,180 --> 02:25:50,340
you're a freedom guy.
I love the way you're living your life.

3339
02:25:50,341 --> 02:25:52,470
You just fly here,
fly there.

3340
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:54,500
Have you been to his houses or have you 
been to?

3341
02:25:54,690 --> 02:25:57,930
I've seen photos of the pool.
The la one is awesome.

3342
02:25:57,931 --> 02:25:59,460
The New York one is like,
um,

3343
02:25:59,670 --> 02:26:01,500
I dunno,
dump he.

3344
02:26:01,980 --> 02:26:03,690
You could tell like he doesn't live 
there,

3345
02:26:03,870 --> 02:26:06,480
you know,
it's like a crash pad,

3346
02:26:06,481 --> 02:26:07,660
but it's a,
it's a,

3347
02:26:08,210 --> 02:26:09,930
it's a nice place.
I'm not saying it isn't,

3348
02:26:10,290 --> 02:26:13,020
but it's an old school,
New York building with the elevator with

3349
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:16,250
the guy has to use the elevator operator
gold.

3350
02:26:16,290 --> 02:26:20,610
Fancy snobby fifth avenue.
Co up Mr.

3351
02:26:20,610 --> 02:26:23,130
Ross.
Snobby.

3352
02:26:23,131 --> 02:26:23,964
But like,
you know,

3353
02:26:24,120 --> 02:26:28,170
I had to go through a co op interview.
Buddy hackett wrote my recommendation.

3354
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:32,370
That's hilarious.
York.

3355
02:26:32,371 --> 02:26:34,290
It's all rules.
So many permits.

3356
02:26:34,291 --> 02:26:34,890
Um,
you know,

3357
02:26:34,890 --> 02:26:37,650
out god is tricky.
There's shootings,

3358
02:26:37,651 --> 02:26:39,990
there's fires.
That's why the caravan turn back.

3359
02:26:40,930 --> 02:26:41,763
Does that one,

3360
02:26:42,480 --> 02:26:43,313
do you see the photos of people like 
running towards the border and gas 

3361
02:26:47,331 --> 02:26:48,164
coming out?
Him and the whole idea of like knowing 

3362
02:26:50,661 --> 02:26:53,000
that there's a big group of people 
headed towards the border.

3363
02:26:53,001 --> 02:26:53,960
I'm like,
what is this?

3364
02:26:54,410 --> 02:26:55,370
Like,
what's going on here?

3365
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:57,470
What?
What's people are flinging?

3366
02:26:57,900 --> 02:27:00,740
They're terrified.
Imagine what they are leaving to come to

3367
02:27:00,741 --> 02:27:01,910
that.
Oh,

3368
02:27:01,911 --> 02:27:02,860
for sure.
Yeah.

3369
02:27:03,210 --> 02:27:04,610
No,
I imagine what's at home,

3370
02:27:04,790 --> 02:27:08,390
but it's always playing that it's all 
this planned out event.

3371
02:27:08,630 --> 02:27:11,210
Like everybody's watching the migration 
board.

3372
02:27:11,320 --> 02:27:13,410
The board this ever happened before.
Yeah.

3373
02:27:13,450 --> 02:27:18,450
There was something that someone posted 
about obama in 2013.

3374
02:27:19,070 --> 02:27:19,903
The deal during the obama administration
wasn't like obama was fucking tear gas 

3375
02:27:22,971 --> 02:27:23,804
over the fence,
but somebody during that administration 

3376
02:27:28,110 --> 02:27:32,510
appeared to have used a tear tear gas on
an illegal immigrant as well,

3377
02:27:33,110 --> 02:27:35,930
but it wasn't.
I don't think it was this kind of thing.

3378
02:27:35,931 --> 02:27:37,270
This kind of thing seems

3379
02:27:37,760 --> 02:27:40,730
like the cuban boatlift,
like that's what I felt like about it as

3380
02:27:40,731 --> 02:27:42,380
like they're fleeing,
you know,

3381
02:27:42,381 --> 02:27:45,290
like a dead spot or you know.
Yeah.

3382
02:27:45,470 --> 02:27:47,000
It's political and economic.

3383
02:27:47,340 --> 02:27:48,173
It's everything mean we,
they want to come to the promise land 

3384
02:27:49,861 --> 02:27:52,350
like all of our ancestors did.
That's why we're here.

3385
02:27:52,560 --> 02:27:53,620
But then we got to a point where

3386
02:27:54,440 --> 02:27:57,650
I don't think it's just about just about
they want to come here,

3387
02:27:57,651 --> 02:28:00,400
it's about what's at home.
That they got to get away from this.

3388
02:28:00,420 --> 02:28:01,253
Yes.
And now with the internet and 

3389
02:28:02,031 --> 02:28:03,650
information,
they go,

3390
02:28:03,651 --> 02:28:06,920
wow,
maybe we don't have to be in this gang.

3391
02:28:07,880 --> 02:28:08,713
Sure.
Maybe I can get my kid out when he's 

3392
02:28:09,590 --> 02:28:12,320
three instead of watching them die at 
15.

3393
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:14,360
Yeah.
And have opportunity.

3394
02:28:14,480 --> 02:28:16,280
I mean,
that's what everybody wanted.

3395
02:28:16,281 --> 02:28:18,680
The came here in the first place.
It's just at this point,

3396
02:28:18,681 --> 02:28:20,780
if you're a poor person from Guatemala,
I mean,

3397
02:28:20,781 --> 02:28:23,570
how is it to immigrate to America if you
don't have any skills,

3398
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:24,673
you have a very short education.
It's got to be really fucking hard to 

3399
02:28:28,461 --> 02:28:32,060
become a us citizen.
Probably super difficult.

3400
02:28:32,690 --> 02:28:33,523
You got to be super brave.
I would go to learn another language to 

3401
02:28:36,271 --> 02:28:40,080
really figure out how to get through all
the other countries and the new America.

3402
02:28:40,081 --> 02:28:42,510
You don't have to learn it,
but it certainly helps.

3403
02:28:42,511 --> 02:28:45,060
If you want to thrive.
I would go to Costa Rica.

3404
02:28:45,360 --> 02:28:46,560
Have you been down there?
Love it.

3405
02:28:47,010 --> 02:28:48,570
Yeah,
like everybody I know who's been there,

3406
02:28:48,571 --> 02:28:49,740
they're like,
this is the place.

3407
02:28:49,741 --> 02:28:51,810
Like I'm going to move here after I 
retire,

3408
02:28:51,811 --> 02:28:54,360
so that might be like a good second 
place.

3409
02:28:54,700 --> 02:28:55,533
Guy offered me.
We'd girls and coke in front of my 

3410
02:28:57,371 --> 02:28:59,230
daughter while I was holding her hand.
I was like,

3411
02:28:59,260 --> 02:29:00,910
damn.
And surf lessons.

3412
02:29:00,940 --> 02:29:01,773
It's like everybody.
There was a professional surfer on the 

3413
02:29:03,161 --> 02:29:03,994
beach,
man,

3414
02:29:04,670 --> 02:29:05,630
girls,
you want coke?

3415
02:29:05,650 --> 02:29:06,071
You want.
I'm like,

3416
02:29:06,071 --> 02:29:06,904
yo bro.
Holding up five-year-old's hand is 

3417
02:29:09,850 --> 02:29:13,730
outraged.
She's like discount.

3418
02:29:14,530 --> 02:29:17,410
I'm like,
what dude is offer me cocaine like right

3419
02:29:17,411 --> 02:29:18,820
there.
What you need to.

3420
02:29:19,030 --> 02:29:20,170
Monkeys are everywhere,
man.

3421
02:29:20,420 --> 02:29:21,450
Everywhere you go,
monkeys.

3422
02:29:22,070 --> 02:29:24,070
Fucking date.
They eat oreos.

3423
02:29:24,071 --> 02:29:25,930
They open them up and chew the white 
part first.

3424
02:29:26,590 --> 02:29:27,423
Yeah.
They eat so many that they know how to 

3425
02:29:28,661 --> 02:29:31,320
pop them up and they chew that white 
shit show.

3426
02:29:31,420 --> 02:29:32,320
Yeah.
We were concerned.

3427
02:29:32,321 --> 02:29:33,154
We were like,
should we really give the monkey a 

3428
02:29:33,881 --> 02:29:36,460
cookie and cookies are toxic.
It's all sugar.

3429
02:29:36,580 --> 02:29:38,290
We gave them monkeY.
The monkey took that thing.

3430
02:29:38,291 --> 02:29:43,291
Pop the tYpe stuff probably lives on a 
steady diet of oreos.

3431
02:29:45,870 --> 02:29:46,703
Oreos are the minibar.
That hotel and the monkeys right there 

3432
02:29:49,600 --> 02:29:51,370
give have a oreo man.
I don't want to see them.

3433
02:29:51,371 --> 02:29:54,550
They have no fear of.
People just have a little bit of fear.

3434
02:29:54,670 --> 02:29:57,270
There's a little bit of apprehension.
There's a there.

3435
02:29:57,271 --> 02:29:58,104
They'd be definitely size you up because
I'm sure they run into dickhead humans 

3436
02:30:02,110 --> 02:30:05,230
and they're fucking dangerous man.
I mean if they decide to fuck you up,

3437
02:30:05,290 --> 02:30:07,800
they can hurt you.
They can call your face apart,

3438
02:30:07,830 --> 02:30:10,130
can.
They can really do damage if there,

3439
02:30:10,390 --> 02:30:12,100
especially this side of the act as a 
group,

3440
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:16,600
but they just seem to be a monkey 
swinging at me once on a tv set and I'll

3441
02:30:16,601 --> 02:30:18,700
never.
I'll never go to another one.

3442
02:30:18,770 --> 02:30:19,603
Suite your face.

3443
02:30:19,700 --> 02:30:21,010
Yeah,
I dunno.

3444
02:30:21,760 --> 02:30:22,593
I was holding his hand.
We were entering it like we were 

3445
02:30:27,341 --> 02:30:28,174
entering.
I was hosting a gong show pilot a 

3446
02:30:30,760 --> 02:30:34,540
million years ago and I was entering 
with a fucking gym pole in his hand.

3447
02:30:34,541 --> 02:30:35,374
We were in champ matching tuxedos and I 
got along with them all day rehearsals 

3448
02:30:39,671 --> 02:30:40,504
and then whatever.
When that band kicked in and the lights 

3449
02:30:42,071 --> 02:30:43,920
were in the role and the audience he 
cherished,

3450
02:30:45,250 --> 02:30:46,083
he really.
I don't know if he was asking for more 

3451
02:30:47,021 --> 02:30:47,854
money or.

3452
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:52,390
Oh,
that makes sense,

3453
02:30:52,391 --> 02:30:53,770
man.
It probably hurt his ears.

3454
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:54,753
Probably so confused.
All the people there doesn't speak your 

3455
02:30:56,891 --> 02:30:57,724
language.
Doesn't know what the fuck you're 

3456
02:30:57,941 --> 02:30:58,840
saying.
Right,

3457
02:30:58,930 --> 02:31:00,040
right.
Wow.

3458
02:31:00,230 --> 02:31:02,840
I have a good monkey story.
Nobody has any good one.

3459
02:31:02,841 --> 02:31:06,410
I do like where I was on another tv show
and the.

3460
02:31:06,790 --> 02:31:09,110
They had the Monkey and they go,
hey,

3461
02:31:09,111 --> 02:31:10,540
like whatever,
clara,

3462
02:31:10,620 --> 02:31:13,850
belle,
whatever your name is there like this is

3463
02:31:13,851 --> 02:31:17,240
dave,
shake hands and the monkey a didn't even

3464
02:31:17,241 --> 02:31:19,590
stop hugging the person,
just let

3465
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,813
the foot come up and I shook their foot 
because their feet are like hands and I 

3466
02:31:23,731 --> 02:31:25,170
was like,
how cool is that?

3467
02:31:25,171 --> 02:31:26,550
I couldn't get over it.
I was like,

3468
02:31:26,850 --> 02:31:30,240
if You could shake hands with your feet,
like when did you do it?

3469
02:31:30,241 --> 02:31:31,290
All the time.
It's like,

3470
02:31:31,291 --> 02:31:32,124
oh hey,
what's up?

3471
02:31:32,220 --> 02:31:33,960
Okay.
So I can keep doing my other stuff.

3472
02:31:34,670 --> 02:31:35,503
Yeah.
Like,

3473
02:31:36,610 --> 02:31:37,650
yeah.
I was like,

3474
02:31:37,651 --> 02:31:38,850
that's really cool.
I just shook.

3475
02:31:38,910 --> 02:31:40,800
Feed him versatile.
Yeah.

3476
02:31:40,801 --> 02:31:42,180
All right.
Maybe it's not that great a story,

3477
02:31:42,181 --> 02:31:45,090
but I still think that's a good monkey 
story.

3478
02:31:45,091 --> 02:31:47,310
That's a win for both.
I like communication,

3479
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:49,583
but then you know parrots,
of course we can talk about it all 

3480
02:31:51,421 --> 02:31:51,970
night.

3481
02:31:51,970 --> 02:31:52,803
People who keep parents his pads and 
then they die because parents lived to 

3482
02:31:55,301 --> 02:31:56,134
be 90 days.
She gets some old lady's parents still 

3483
02:31:58,271 --> 02:31:59,500
got 60 years left in it.

3484
02:31:59,710 --> 02:32:01,090
Yeah.
And they're racIst.

3485
02:32:01,140 --> 02:32:03,280
Who wants them?
Full fucking tank.

3486
02:32:03,290 --> 02:32:05,860
That parents get a full tank to take 
that thing.

3487
02:32:09,220 --> 02:32:11,560
take your pills,
take your pills.

3488
02:32:11,561 --> 02:32:15,120
You always want attentIon.
they're weird.

3489
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:16,353
Yeah,
they want to sit right on your shoulder 

3490
02:32:17,171 --> 02:32:20,110
or hidden in your hand.
They want you to open up the cage.

3491
02:32:20,140 --> 02:32:22,450
Talk to them.
They want to be around you all the time.

3492
02:32:22,720 --> 02:32:23,830
Parents are smart,
man.

3493
02:32:23,831 --> 02:32:24,664
They do not like to get just left alone.
If you think you're going to be some 

3494
02:32:26,441 --> 02:32:28,530
asshole as acute bird sitting in the 
cage,

3495
02:32:28,550 --> 02:32:29,850
the middle of your living room.
Oh,

3496
02:32:29,860 --> 02:32:31,360
that's my parent.
I'm interesting.

3497
02:32:31,390 --> 02:32:32,320
No,
that parent needs you.

3498
02:32:32,360 --> 02:32:33,193
Hey.
Hey.

3499
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:37,990
They want attention,
like come on mother fucker.

3500
02:32:37,991 --> 02:32:40,210
I don't want to just sit in this case.
Let me out.

3501
02:32:40,480 --> 02:32:41,680
Let me out.
Let's walk around.

3502
02:32:41,850 --> 02:32:43,530
Let me sending your shoulder,
but I don't know.

3503
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:47,190
See what's on tv.
Come on.

3504
02:32:47,230 --> 02:32:49,780
Fucking board.
Parents are smart,

3505
02:32:49,781 --> 02:32:51,700
man.
The reason why they are not smart,

3506
02:32:51,940 --> 02:32:54,790
they live that long.
They live all long time.

3507
02:32:54,930 --> 02:32:57,850
A long time.
I think smarter or dumber than out

3508
02:33:00,200 --> 02:33:01,033
davis theory.
I'm always in search of the next 

3509
02:33:02,970 --> 02:33:05,230
algebra.
That's my big thing.

3510
02:33:05,780 --> 02:33:07,760
Well,
we know that ravens are really smart.

3511
02:33:07,910 --> 02:33:10,010
There's a super smart,
they solve puzzles and shit,

3512
02:33:10,011 --> 02:33:11,520
like scientists set up all these 
puzzles.

3513
02:33:11,650 --> 02:33:13,040
Ravens with they'll,
yeah,

3514
02:33:13,041 --> 02:33:16,850
they'll take a stick and then use the 
stick to get a longer stick and then use

3515
02:33:16,851 --> 02:33:19,070
that stick to get the,
get the food out,

3516
02:33:19,100 --> 02:33:21,710
like multistep,
like problem solving.

3517
02:33:21,740 --> 02:33:24,140
Ravens can do weird shit.
But uh,

3518
02:33:24,410 --> 02:33:25,243
and we know that a bunch,
a bunch of other different birds are 

3519
02:33:28,011 --> 02:33:29,630
pretty fucking smart,
but I don't know,

3520
02:33:29,660 --> 02:33:32,660
my hawks,
my hawks hawks in my neighborhood,

3521
02:33:33,020 --> 02:33:33,853
they're smart who fly right over my 
house all the time and they're 

3522
02:33:36,710 --> 02:33:39,590
fascinating to watch.
They really like to show off.

3523
02:33:39,640 --> 02:33:40,473
Yeah.
I would assume that all those predators 

3524
02:33:42,021 --> 02:33:43,280
have to be smart.
I mean they just,

3525
02:33:43,390 --> 02:33:45,320
they have to be ruthless and smart,
you know,

3526
02:33:45,380 --> 02:33:48,260
to get along if you're out there picking
up squirrels and rats and shit,

3527
02:33:48,261 --> 02:33:49,094
like they are doing digital firebomb and
out of the sky snatching things up from 

3528
02:33:52,521 --> 02:33:53,354
angles that only they understand.
My friend tom was in his backyard 

3529
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:57,373
sitting down having a cup of coughing 
and he saw dove landed on top of his 

3530
02:34:01,101 --> 02:34:06,101
fence and then out of nowhere this hawk 
just chucked at da boom.

3531
02:34:06,111 --> 02:34:06,944
He said it was like a big explosion of 
feathers that the hawk just swooped in 

3532
02:34:10,191 --> 02:34:14,450
going like 150 miles an hour glass,
snatch the dove right off it and it took

3533
02:34:14,451 --> 02:34:17,200
off and he was just sitting there with 
his coffee and his like,

3534
02:34:17,201 --> 02:34:18,220
what the fuck?

3535
02:34:18,270 --> 02:34:20,170
Wow.
Goes Like 10 yards from my head.

3536
02:34:20,450 --> 02:34:22,490
It just thought it was dove.
I would have kicked.

3537
02:34:24,930 --> 02:34:25,763
Fucking landed safely.
Would've landed safely back on your 

3538
02:34:30,521 --> 02:34:35,521
buddy friend told everybody if I was a 
dove,

3539
02:34:36,731 --> 02:34:41,731
would kids kids have to do with the 
plane?

3540
02:34:43,110 --> 02:34:44,720
Well that would make them motivated.
He's a,

3541
02:34:44,730 --> 02:34:45,740
he's a,
you know,

3542
02:34:45,741 --> 02:34:47,050
I'm protected.
I see.

3543
02:34:47,260 --> 02:34:49,360
Yeah.
Don't give him that.

3544
02:34:49,690 --> 02:34:51,250
He probably does have to fight a little 
bit too.

3545
02:34:51,310 --> 02:34:52,800
It looks like he does.
He does.

3546
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:54,520
He does.
In the movie play.

3547
02:34:54,550 --> 02:34:56,650
Micky ward.
Looks like he knows how to box.

3548
02:34:56,651 --> 02:34:57,910
He definitely knows how to throw 
punches,

3549
02:34:58,860 --> 02:35:00,850
you know.
This is michael b.

3550
02:35:00,850 --> 02:35:01,683
Jordan.
Thanks fascinating to me because he'll 

3551
02:35:02,431 --> 02:35:03,430
listen.
He made money on it.

3552
02:35:03,460 --> 02:35:05,470
I hope it does.
Someone will tell them I'm looking.

3553
02:35:05,530 --> 02:35:06,363
I'm sure he's a smart guy and I'm sure 
he's a great athlete and I'm sure he 

3554
02:35:09,701 --> 02:35:13,510
probably knows how to box a little bit,
but if you kind of box guy like roy,

3555
02:35:13,511 --> 02:35:14,344
jonah,
you know what you do,

3556
02:35:14,590 --> 02:35:15,423
you started the amateurs and you learn 
how to box and then you become a 

3557
02:35:17,651 --> 02:35:22,410
professional and then one day you box 
Roy Jones newman and the race cars.

3558
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,020
So yeah,
you're not going,

3559
02:35:25,120 --> 02:35:26,590
you're not getting hit.
See,

3560
02:35:26,600 --> 02:35:30,580
the very unique thing about combat 
sports is you're getting hit,

3561
02:35:30,990 --> 02:35:32,650
so it's not like someone's dunking on 
you.

3562
02:35:32,680 --> 02:35:34,330
Like if you played basketball with coby 
bryant,

3563
02:35:34,331 --> 02:35:36,400
you're going to get lit up,
you're going to look like a fool,

3564
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:38,740
but you're not going to get hit a few 
boxes.

3565
02:35:38,741 --> 02:35:39,574
Roy jones jr.
You're gonna get you're gonna get 

3566
02:35:42,010 --> 02:35:42,843
dinged.
Michael Jordan got knocked out during 

3567
02:35:45,371 --> 02:35:49,360
decreed,
filming acts by with an accidental punch

3568
02:35:49,361 --> 02:35:50,640
that landed where they.
Yeah,

3569
02:35:50,710 --> 02:35:51,543
where they were hitting him and he tried
to like turn his head at the last 

3570
02:35:53,710 --> 02:35:54,910
minute,
but they didn't turn it quick enough and

3571
02:35:54,911 --> 02:35:55,744
he got clipped and dropped.
Maybe that's why he knows he can take a 

3572
02:35:58,661 --> 02:35:59,810
punch now.
Well,

3573
02:35:59,811 --> 02:36:01,420
I mean maybe that's given him the 
confidence.

3574
02:36:01,450 --> 02:36:02,650
He did it on purpose.
He was.

3575
02:36:02,660 --> 02:36:04,010
I think it just.
I think,

3576
02:36:04,090 --> 02:36:04,923
you know,
the way it was like you take the punch 

3577
02:36:06,821 --> 02:36:07,654
then turn your habit.

3578
02:36:07,660 --> 02:36:09,520
It looked like he took the punch just a 
little too hard.

3579
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:10,443
That's real,
right?

3580
02:36:10,710 --> 02:36:13,630
That looks good,
but it isn't really real gloves there.

3581
02:36:13,631 --> 02:36:15,670
Then I use them regularly.
They're using boxing gloves.

3582
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:18,423
Could it be bullshit?
I love those korean movies and they see 

3583
02:36:21,411 --> 02:36:22,244
something like this.
You don't know if it's like some thing 

3584
02:36:24,760 --> 02:36:26,290
they do for a publicity stunt.
Like,

3585
02:36:26,291 --> 02:36:29,230
watch this,
see that they're practicing like this.

3586
02:36:29,590 --> 02:36:31,630
See right there.
Now see that's real dude.

3587
02:36:31,631 --> 02:36:32,800
Yeah,
that's real.

3588
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:36,040
See the way his head snaps in his eyes.
Go play that again.

3589
02:36:36,480 --> 02:36:39,130
That's real.
I know what a real knockout looks like.

3590
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:42,160
I've seen a thousand of them in person.
That's a real knockout.

3591
02:36:42,161 --> 02:36:43,480
Watch.
This look at this,

3592
02:36:43,870 --> 02:36:48,580
he fucked up and he's out cold dude.
He's out cold.

3593
02:36:48,581 --> 02:36:49,750
One hundred percent.
Watch this.

3594
02:36:53,430 --> 02:36:56,670
He ran right into the punch.
His head snapped Back,

3595
02:36:56,671 --> 02:36:59,380
his eyes rolled behind his head and he 
wants conscious yet,

3596
02:36:59,550 --> 02:37:04,550
but that is 100 percent legit knockout.
But that punch was not even a punch.

3597
02:37:04,730 --> 02:37:05,200
What,
what,

3598
02:37:05,200 --> 02:37:07,500
what he was hit with.
He even had a mystery behind it.

3599
02:37:07,650 --> 02:37:08,483
He didn't have any power behind it.
So he was basically knocked out Just by 

3600
02:37:12,001 --> 02:37:13,090
coincidence.
No,

3601
02:37:13,120 --> 02:37:14,690
no.
There's definitely power behind it.

3602
02:37:14,691 --> 02:37:15,920
If they say yes,
yes,

3603
02:37:15,921 --> 02:37:16,200
yes,

3604
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:17,330
yes.
Listen,

3605
02:37:17,360 --> 02:37:19,950
you could kao someone easily just doing 
that easily.

3606
02:37:20,090 --> 02:37:20,923
That was perfect punch.
It was a perfect punch that landed on 

3607
02:37:23,031 --> 02:37:25,550
his jaw as he was moving forward.
That's the key.

3608
02:37:25,700 --> 02:37:26,533
The key is that he was turning his head 
into it and he didn't think it was 

3609
02:37:29,241 --> 02:37:33,770
coming in and he took it right on the 
jaw if you want play it because I didn't

3610
02:37:33,771 --> 02:37:36,390
see.
What he's doing is he's there.

3611
02:37:36,391 --> 02:37:37,224
They're choreographing how the sequence 
is going to go and somewhere along the 

3612
02:37:40,251 --> 02:37:41,084
line,
either as a miscalculation or a mistake 

3613
02:37:42,921 --> 02:37:44,820
was made.
So this will be Jordan,

3614
02:37:44,840 --> 02:37:45,890
what's this?
What's this?

3615
02:37:45,891 --> 02:37:49,400
Right here?
See that he fucked up and they turned in

3616
02:37:49,430 --> 02:37:53,350
to do it and that guy is throwing like.
I mean,

3617
02:37:53,390 --> 02:37:55,610
even though it's not the most powerful 
punch in the world,

3618
02:37:55,611 --> 02:37:58,820
it's faster than I thought and he knows 
how to punch.

3619
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:00,860
Okay.
So his weight is behind that.

3620
02:38:01,010 --> 02:38:04,190
His shoulders behind that.
That's a guy who's punched people in the

3621
02:38:04,191 --> 02:38:06,290
face before he knows exactly how to do 
it.

3622
02:38:06,410 --> 02:38:08,720
So even though he's only doing it like 
this,

3623
02:38:09,020 --> 02:38:09,853
even though he's only doing that.
So you'll run into it and he catches it 

3624
02:38:12,370 --> 02:38:13,970
on the chin.
You're going out of course.

3625
02:38:14,160 --> 02:38:15,230
and that's what happened.
So why,

3626
02:38:15,290 --> 02:38:16,123
why did that get a leak?
She didn't know if it got leaked or if 

3627
02:38:17,991 --> 02:38:18,824
they put it out on perfect,
they put it out to show that they 

3628
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:20,913
probably probably put it out to show you
this is hard training they're doing for 

3629
02:38:23,241 --> 02:38:23,990
this.
And you know,

3630
02:38:23,990 --> 02:38:25,970
there was an accident on the set and he 
got knocked out.

3631
02:38:26,090 --> 02:38:28,910
I will be not the clip I'd want out 
there if I was him,

3632
02:38:29,130 --> 02:38:32,580
but it turns into a site that was.
He was younger than.

3633
02:38:32,660 --> 02:38:34,760
He's bigger and stronger now.
He's older.

3634
02:38:34,761 --> 02:38:36,740
His body's more mature,
but either way.

3635
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:38,990
Oh,
I want a box.

3636
02:38:38,991 --> 02:38:42,440
Roy jones.
The first one you got to become a career

3637
02:38:42,441 --> 02:38:43,630
boxer.
I mean,

3638
02:38:44,030 --> 02:38:46,830
unless he's like so old,
you can't take a punch.

3639
02:38:47,010 --> 02:38:47,843
It's not going to do it.
Or he would never have given up his 

3640
02:38:49,461 --> 02:38:51,830
strategy like that.
I need them five,

3641
02:38:51,831 --> 02:38:55,640
six rounds.
That's just shit talking.

3642
02:38:56,020 --> 02:38:56,853
Anything did that his whole career.
Exactly how he was going to beat guys 

3643
02:39:01,930 --> 02:39:03,530
this whole career choice.
Really.

3644
02:39:03,700 --> 02:39:06,020
He's still Roy Jones jr.
This is crazy.

3645
02:39:06,021 --> 02:39:08,870
Talk like him saying just played dumb 
and be like,

3646
02:39:09,820 --> 02:39:11,180
he's good.
I'll do it.

3647
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:12,830
That's not what he would do.
He would say,

3648
02:39:12,831 --> 02:39:15,080
this is how I'm going to do it,
and then he would go out and do it.

3649
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:16,850
Say,
I'm going to need you to get tired out.

3650
02:39:16,920 --> 02:39:18,440
See what it feels like to be in a real 
fight.

3651
02:39:18,510 --> 02:39:19,550
It take a beating.
Yeah,

3652
02:39:19,570 --> 02:39:20,060
man,
look,

3653
02:39:20,060 --> 02:39:22,550
if I can tell was junior just gets you 
into the third,

3654
02:39:22,551 --> 02:39:25,010
fourth and fifth round and you're all,
your adrenaline dump.

3655
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:25,873
Dump is gone because you're not used to 
boxing a worldclass boxer in a 

3656
02:39:29,451 --> 02:39:32,930
professional matches on paper view that 
millions of people are watching not used

3657
02:39:32,931 --> 02:39:35,120
to that experience.
So that experIence is taxing.

3658
02:39:35,300 --> 02:39:37,550
It's nerve racking.
You're going to have all this adrenaline

3659
02:39:37,551 --> 02:39:40,550
rush through your body.
Even if you're the the chillest of chill

3660
02:39:40,570 --> 02:39:42,320
dude,
you're going to be just a little bit too

3661
02:39:42,321 --> 02:39:43,040
amped up,
right?

3662
02:39:43,040 --> 02:39:45,110
So then around that second round comes,
then he started,

3663
02:39:45,290 --> 02:39:48,280
he even and you can't breathe that good 
and you just kinda like,

3664
02:39:48,430 --> 02:39:50,780
we're always just kind of boxing.
You just boxing you.

3665
02:39:50,781 --> 02:39:52,430
he's not hurting you.
He just boxing you.

3666
02:39:52,431 --> 02:39:53,264
Occasionally you get stung a little bit.
Then the third round moves in and he 

3667
02:39:55,971 --> 02:39:59,390
starts moving left and right and come in
and stinging.

3668
02:39:59,391 --> 02:40:02,540
You hard the jab,
stepping in with a lead hand,

3669
02:40:02,570 --> 02:40:04,650
upper cut and you're like,
oh fuck yeah.

3670
02:40:04,670 --> 02:40:07,310
Now you're getting teed off on and now 
he's talking,

3671
02:40:07,340 --> 02:40:08,173
he's dancing,
he's moving around and then he's just 

3672
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:10,153
charged stolen bombs on you and you 
can't defend them because you're 

3673
02:40:12,321 --> 02:40:13,154
exhausted and he hooks you to the liver 
and drops you hunted around trying to 

3674
02:40:16,201 --> 02:40:19,320
get away from get away.
He's too good.

3675
02:40:19,321 --> 02:40:20,880
he's been doing it for too long.

3676
02:40:21,030 --> 02:40:22,510
Joan said that.
He says,

3677
02:40:22,840 --> 02:40:23,673
yeah,
he probably can go long and hard on me 

3678
02:40:24,551 --> 02:40:25,384
because he's all trained up,
but do you think he would come and I'm 

3679
02:40:26,981 --> 02:40:27,814
like full tilt in the first round or two
and just like really like take them to 

3680
02:40:30,851 --> 02:40:31,401
school.
You know,

3681
02:40:31,401 --> 02:40:32,740
like the speed downs.

3682
02:40:33,280 --> 02:40:36,010
Dangerous because when you get real 
aggressive is when you get hit.

3683
02:40:36,160 --> 02:40:38,800
Because when you get real aggressive,
say if I know you're coming at me,

3684
02:40:38,801 --> 02:40:39,700
I'm,
you're running at me,

3685
02:40:39,701 --> 02:40:40,534
you're running at me.
All I have to do is figure out how much 

3686
02:40:42,941 --> 02:40:43,774
time and space I need to get something 
off as You're coming at me because I 

3687
02:40:46,991 --> 02:40:47,824
know where you're going.
It's dangerous when you don't know if 

3688
02:40:49,631 --> 02:40:51,400
someone's coming and going when 
someone's not.

3689
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:52,570
When you don't know if they're coming to
going,

3690
02:40:52,571 --> 02:40:55,030
that's when a fight is weird.
So the beginning of every fight,

3691
02:40:55,270 --> 02:40:56,103
people are feeling each other out.
They don't know if someone's coming to 

3692
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:59,830
going.
If I know that you're just running at me

3693
02:41:00,010 --> 02:41:00,843
and I'm Roy Jones jr,
I'm going to step back and I'm going to 

3694
02:41:02,471 --> 02:41:03,304
time it and I crack you and I'm going to
crack you in a way that you probably 

3695
02:41:05,861 --> 02:41:06,640
don't see coming.

3696
02:41:06,640 --> 02:41:08,320
You probably don't see it in the gym too
much.

3697
02:41:08,500 --> 02:41:10,390
I'm just going to stiff arm you with a 
jab,

3698
02:41:10,420 --> 02:41:12,610
pop you in place,
step to the left.

3699
02:41:12,611 --> 02:41:13,444
Boom,
he's going to drop out right hand on 

3700
02:41:14,321 --> 02:41:15,520
your chin.
He's goIng to fuck you up,

3701
02:41:15,580 --> 02:41:16,413
and then he's going to turn around.
He's going to be behind you and he's 

3702
02:41:18,131 --> 02:41:18,964
gonna.
Look at you to see if you're still okay 

3703
02:41:19,960 --> 02:41:21,940
and then he's going to do it again and 
he's going to keep doing it.

3704
02:41:22,030 --> 02:41:24,330
If you keep chasing after him,
you're going to still get fucked.

3705
02:41:24,370 --> 02:41:27,730
You're going to get fucked up and going 
to get your face punched in.

3706
02:41:27,910 --> 02:41:30,790
So the only other thing is to do is like
you've got a buxom,

3707
02:41:31,270 --> 02:41:32,103
so okay,
now you're boxing one of the greatest 

3708
02:41:33,221 --> 02:41:34,054
boxers of all time and he just,
and he's just going to just figure you 

3709
02:41:36,251 --> 02:41:36,460
out.

3710
02:41:36,460 --> 02:41:38,080
Like what do you go,
what do you do when I do this?

3711
02:41:38,230 --> 02:41:41,140
What happens when I do this?
What happens here?

3712
02:41:41,830 --> 02:41:42,820
Could I have punched you?
Oh,

3713
02:41:42,821 --> 02:41:43,654
I could have.
And then he's going to figure out when 

3714
02:41:45,161 --> 02:41:45,994
to move and when you're going to get 
tired and he's going to start dropping 

3715
02:41:47,771 --> 02:41:49,210
bombs on you,
it's going to be awful.

3716
02:41:49,320 --> 02:41:50,950
Which you have respected it.
If he said,

3717
02:41:51,070 --> 02:41:51,910
oh,
you know,

3718
02:41:51,970 --> 02:41:55,240
I want to box a few matches first and 
then get to roy.

3719
02:41:55,880 --> 02:41:57,900
I think he's just talking shit.
He was just having a good time.

3720
02:41:58,130 --> 02:41:59,710
Probably didn't expect anybody to run 
with it.

3721
02:41:59,711 --> 02:42:01,950
He didn't expect people to analyze it.
That's the guy who you know.

3722
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:03,640
And that video.
This guy,

3723
02:42:04,210 --> 02:42:05,760
he's an real boxer,
huh?

3724
02:42:06,310 --> 02:42:07,510
Oh yeah.
You're knocked out.

3725
02:42:07,511 --> 02:42:09,790
David haye before.
His name is tony bellew.

3726
02:42:09,910 --> 02:42:10,790
Oh dude,
that,

3727
02:42:10,800 --> 02:42:13,170
that's,
that guy is a legit boxer.

3728
02:42:13,180 --> 02:42:17,830
he just got stopped by that bad ass 
russian motherfucker on a well look what

3729
02:42:17,831 --> 02:42:19,300
he's doing.
Tv really recently,

3730
02:42:19,301 --> 02:42:20,160
lIke his guy.
that's it.

3731
02:42:20,210 --> 02:42:23,500
These are top flight boxer.
So for him to knock him out,

3732
02:42:23,501 --> 02:42:26,680
of course it was just.
He's so good man.

3733
02:42:26,800 --> 02:42:29,950
So for him to do it accidentally makes 
complete total sense.

3734
02:42:31,090 --> 02:42:32,580
Well look at the.
Yeah,

3735
02:42:32,840 --> 02:42:36,700
that guy is a beast man.
That's like a legit top flight boxer.

3736
02:42:36,701 --> 02:42:37,534
so he's in there even just accidentally 
getting punched in the face by to see 

3737
02:42:41,141 --> 02:42:41,974
the movie.
I'll tell you tHat Michael Jordan 

3738
02:42:44,200 --> 02:42:48,000
talking shit to recover and get back to 
training and,

3739
02:42:48,001 --> 02:42:48,834
and,
and

3740
02:42:49,110 --> 02:42:52,140
filming after that.
In the heavyweight class,

3741
02:42:52,141 --> 02:42:54,760
you never saw abs until the movies.
You never.

3742
02:42:54,840 --> 02:42:56,230
It was always like,
I know,

3743
02:42:56,231 --> 02:42:56,790
right.
You know,

3744
02:42:56,790 --> 02:42:57,623
they were like,
they were like basically punching bags 

3745
02:43:00,380 --> 02:43:01,590
now.
Now it's like they have to be.

3746
02:43:01,591 --> 02:43:01,980
So

3747
02:43:01,980 --> 02:43:04,230
tyson.
You saw abs when he came out of prison.

3748
02:43:04,320 --> 02:43:07,350
Remember that?
I guess when you fought peter mcneely,

3749
02:43:07,380 --> 02:43:08,880
dude,
he was prison jacked.

3750
02:43:09,330 --> 02:43:11,630
That was like maybe the scariest tyson 
ever.

3751
02:43:11,631 --> 02:43:12,340
Like they finally

3752
02:43:12,340 --> 02:43:14,660
released him and all he'd been doing in 
jail.

3753
02:43:15,270 --> 02:43:19,090
I don't think he could box in jail,
so I think he was just lifting weights.

3754
02:43:19,410 --> 02:43:22,330
You remember he was super,
super jacked when he got out of jail.

3755
02:43:23,180 --> 02:43:24,220
He was.
Yeah.

3756
02:43:24,340 --> 02:43:26,150
See,
go to tyson.

3757
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:28,750
Pei.
That's tyson versus peter mcneely.

3758
02:43:28,960 --> 02:43:31,150
That was in 1995.
It looks good.

3759
02:43:31,170 --> 02:43:35,380
They're terrifying.
That was the most terrifying movie tyson

3760
02:43:35,381 --> 02:43:36,214
ever.
He just looked like he was made out of 

3761
02:43:37,211 --> 02:43:40,850
steel.
Just a tank of a man,

3762
02:43:41,350 --> 02:43:42,183
and I'll never forget the fucking way in
or the stare down rather because during 

3763
02:43:45,191 --> 02:43:46,024
the steer down,
peter mcneely signed up for that fight 

3764
02:43:48,280 --> 02:43:51,430
knowing that he's a tough guy who's 
going to take a fucking vicious beating.

3765
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,010
That's what he signed up for.
He knew what he was doing.

3766
02:43:54,040 --> 02:43:57,940
He knew he going to give it his all,
but he knew if you had to bet,

3767
02:43:58,150 --> 02:44:00,010
most people were not betting on Peter 
Mcdonald.

3768
02:44:00,011 --> 02:44:00,844
Yeah,
but you could see it in tyson's face 

3769
02:44:02,291 --> 02:44:04,660
when he's staring them down.
There's this crazy.

3770
02:44:04,750 --> 02:44:07,570
He's following him everywhere.
He goes like a predator dude.

3771
02:44:08,020 --> 02:44:12,040
It's like a predator who can't wait to 
get the green light to let the genie out

3772
02:44:12,041 --> 02:44:13,570
of the bottle.
Watch this.

3773
02:44:14,860 --> 02:44:15,693
This is tysons first fight like peter is
kind of looking down and you look over 

3774
02:44:19,601 --> 02:44:20,440
time.
So we'll get his eyes.

3775
02:44:21,150 --> 02:44:22,840
Dad is fucking terrifying

3776
02:44:23,120 --> 02:44:28,120
if you're looking at that and you know,
smiling and trying to like,

3777
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:32,900
he's trying to like make light of it.
Oh my god.

3778
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:35,280
He looks just like a prison guard dude.
He.

3779
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:36,790
Oh yeah,
he does.

3780
02:44:38,570 --> 02:44:41,400
That's really guard here.
After the green mile hair,

3781
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:44,353
I sat next.

3782
02:44:51,140 --> 02:44:51,973
I sat next to tyson at after the,
at the charlie sheen roast and made a 

3783
02:44:55,871 --> 02:44:58,900
lot of jokes about him and uh,
afterwards dice call me.

3784
02:44:58,901 --> 02:45:00,430
I didn't really know.
Dice at the time,

3785
02:45:00,620 --> 02:45:02,290
called me like a couple of weeks later,
he's like,

3786
02:45:02,830 --> 02:45:04,300
jeff dice.
He's like,

3787
02:45:04,870 --> 02:45:06,370
he's like,
he's like,

3788
02:45:07,440 --> 02:45:08,273
he's like basically said that he 
couldn't believe I said those things to 

3789
02:45:11,561 --> 02:45:13,900
Mike Tyson.
Like he was offended and I go,

3790
02:45:13,901 --> 02:45:15,160
what do you mean?
He's like,

3791
02:45:15,400 --> 02:45:19,210
do you have any idea what that animal 
could have done

3792
02:45:20,810 --> 02:45:22,110
two feet away.

3793
02:45:23,930 --> 02:45:26,690
We've been friends ever since,
but I didn't,

3794
02:45:27,810 --> 02:45:31,130
I didn't think about tyson.
He seemed like a pussy cat at the time,

3795
02:45:31,160 --> 02:45:33,890
at the time.
But if that was tyson from like 1986,

3796
02:45:33,891 --> 02:45:36,140
I think if I watched an old fight.

3797
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:37,083
Yeah,

3798
02:45:38,250 --> 02:45:40,700
by the end of the night.
I'm literally like laughing and it was a

3799
02:45:40,701 --> 02:45:41,534
lap.

3800
02:45:42,380 --> 02:45:43,870
Well once loved it.
Yeah.

3801
02:45:43,871 --> 02:45:45,530
Yeah.
He loves jokes.

3802
02:45:45,590 --> 02:45:47,270
He could take jokes.
Oh yeah,

3803
02:45:48,170 --> 02:45:49,340
but you wouldn't want to be

3804
02:45:49,560 --> 02:45:50,393
that.
Imagine if I said I don't want to piss 

3805
02:45:51,301 --> 02:45:53,610
you off mike,
if you would do that to your face,

3806
02:45:53,611 --> 02:45:54,444
imagine what you would do to

3807
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:01,550
basically the only celebrity to ever 
pull off a face mask.

3808
02:46:02,380 --> 02:46:03,210
Face tats.
I thought.

3809
02:46:03,210 --> 02:46:04,110
No.
Who else has done it?

3810
02:46:04,510 --> 02:46:05,680
What?
Celebrity feud.

3811
02:46:05,790 --> 02:46:07,200
Charles manson.
Well,

3812
02:46:07,201 --> 02:46:08,940
those,
those mumble rapper dudes.

3813
02:46:08,990 --> 02:46:10,220
Yeah.
Like postman

3814
02:46:10,220 --> 02:46:13,250
alone loan type characters to kashi.
Sixty nine.

3815
02:46:13,310 --> 02:46:14,143
But he was the first by a long stretch 
and you're being pulled off as if he 

3816
02:46:19,701 --> 02:46:20,810
pulled that off.
Still.

3817
02:46:20,811 --> 02:46:22,120
Mike tyson not good.
You know what I mean?

3818
02:46:22,380 --> 02:46:23,270
Hope gucci mane.
Oh,

3819
02:46:23,271 --> 02:46:24,770
that's right.
He had the ice cream cone.

3820
02:46:24,860 --> 02:46:27,480
Was that first though?
I feel like wow,

3821
02:46:27,510 --> 02:46:28,790
close.
Probably same time.

3822
02:46:28,820 --> 02:46:31,190
Wow.
That's a commitment that got.

3823
02:46:31,580 --> 02:46:34,010
Has that on his face anymore.
This new pictures.

3824
02:46:34,011 --> 02:46:35,020
It looks like.
Get that off.

3825
02:46:35,360 --> 02:46:38,080
That'll get you removed.
Yeah,

3826
02:46:38,090 --> 02:46:39,620
they live.
They can lead you that shit off,

3827
02:46:39,800 --> 02:46:40,633
but I haven't,
but it looks like somebody carved into 

3828
02:46:42,051 --> 02:46:43,820
his face.
It doesn't even look like a tat.

3829
02:46:43,880 --> 02:46:47,150
well that's because it's fresh because 
that's like right after it got made.

3830
02:46:47,510 --> 02:46:50,630
It's still.
They're not as a bright.

3831
02:46:50,750 --> 02:46:51,583
Let me see.
That man's got an ice cream cone on his 

3832
02:46:54,050 --> 02:46:55,520
face,
but now it's yogurt.

3833
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:57,680
It's just different time.
Is that today though?

3834
02:46:57,681 --> 02:46:59,360
He's got more tests to.
Oh,

3835
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:02,150
so they're all over the place.
That dude's always smiling.

3836
02:47:02,510 --> 02:47:03,343
Ever since you got out of jail.
He seems like the happiest guy in the 

3837
02:47:04,641 --> 02:47:08,390
world for real.
He's got a beautiful good on him.

3838
02:47:08,391 --> 02:47:09,590
They looked.
The tattoos look good.

3839
02:47:09,591 --> 02:47:10,424
I said,
but why is there ice cream like right 

3840
02:47:11,301 --> 02:47:12,134
there?
Like does he have a tongue where he's 

3841
02:47:12,560 --> 02:47:13,131
like,
hey look,

3842
02:47:13,131 --> 02:47:15,010
I can look ice cream.
No,

3843
02:47:15,020 --> 02:47:17,120
because then we don't want to be able to
lick the bottom part.

3844
02:47:17,900 --> 02:47:18,733
He Wouldn't even get the real ice cream 
cone somewhere else and he's got a lot 

3845
02:47:21,681 --> 02:47:22,550
of tattoos.
Yeah.

3846
02:47:22,920 --> 02:47:23,753
It looks good though.

3847
02:47:25,790 --> 02:47:26,623
But the pearls takes him the mean out of
the highest tattoo you have to your 

3848
02:47:29,391 --> 02:47:30,670
face.
Oh,

3849
02:47:30,680 --> 02:47:32,480
it goes up to my shoulder.
Both arms.

3850
02:47:32,570 --> 02:47:34,760
Basically the same.
So you can see all your tattoos.

3851
02:47:34,850 --> 02:47:35,670
Yeah.
Yeah.

3852
02:47:35,670 --> 02:47:37,010
Don't have any other ones.
Just these.

3853
02:47:38,360 --> 02:47:39,193
No tattoos.
Jeff.

3854
02:47:39,740 --> 02:47:44,200
I'm thinking of getting a tramp stamp.
Dave and I are going to get them to say.

3855
02:47:44,780 --> 02:47:46,610
Come on.
Mine says free wifi.

3856
02:47:47,580 --> 02:47:51,230
Mine's going to say too legit to shit.
I'm going.

3857
02:47:51,250 --> 02:47:52,970
I'm going with watch out.
Terrible ahead.

3858
02:47:54,730 --> 02:47:57,100
Fear has keep on trucking.
Tattoo side.

3859
02:47:59,180 --> 02:48:03,740
In hebrew it's the only tattoo.
It's preposterous.

3860
02:48:03,800 --> 02:48:05,720
Keep on trucking.
Yeah.

3861
02:48:07,090 --> 02:48:08,630
Jamie?
Yeah,

3862
02:48:08,631 --> 02:48:09,860
he's gotta.
Keep on trucking.

3863
02:48:09,861 --> 02:48:13,760
Tattoo.
I'm right about this.

3864
02:48:13,761 --> 02:48:15,640
Right.
I was looking for,

3865
02:48:15,850 --> 02:48:16,683
it says keep on trucking.
Who used to have it was tony danza you 

3866
02:48:18,551 --> 02:48:19,910
said of like keep on trucking.

3867
02:48:21,550 --> 02:48:23,000
I was like a thing that people used to 
say.

3868
02:48:24,120 --> 02:48:28,820
I'm sure I had to keep on trucking patch
or tee shirt and a hat.

3869
02:48:29,420 --> 02:48:32,250
Like what was that?
What was going on to keep on trucking?

3870
02:48:32,280 --> 02:48:33,500
Hang in there,
baby.

3871
02:48:33,980 --> 02:48:36,020
That was one.
Keep on trucking.

3872
02:48:36,090 --> 02:48:37,280
Nobody had hanging.
Blah.

3873
02:48:37,310 --> 02:48:39,440
I'm sure people got hang in there.
Baby tattoos,

3874
02:48:39,650 --> 02:48:40,700
right?
What am I saying?

3875
02:48:40,701 --> 02:48:45,020
Nobody should have done it when he got.
This is a bumping my cat.

3876
02:48:45,080 --> 02:48:46,490
Shut the fuck up.
Is that mine?

3877
02:48:46,520 --> 02:48:47,353
Yeah.
You can put it near your dave's whole 

3878
02:48:48,781 --> 02:48:52,490
porn hat that I don't even have one of 
these.

3879
02:48:53,380 --> 02:48:54,171
Yeah,
you do.

3880
02:48:54,171 --> 02:48:56,330
I've given you two of them.
That show was fun.

3881
02:48:56,960 --> 02:48:57,860
That was a good one.
Joe.

3882
02:48:58,040 --> 02:48:59,660
You really rocked that show.
It was fun.

3883
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:01,580
That was a great show.
That should never take that off.

3884
02:49:01,581 --> 02:49:03,800
The air bumping mix.
Yeah,

3885
02:49:04,610 --> 02:49:08,170
but I hope it's not a.
I hope it's not a bad light.

3886
02:49:08,190 --> 02:49:09,023
I give him always a hat from every show.
He always helps me out and they go 

3887
02:49:11,911 --> 02:49:12,990
nowhere.
The shows.

3888
02:49:13,500 --> 02:49:15,230
That's not true.
Now this one's a hit.

3889
02:49:16,290 --> 02:49:18,960
I'm hoping this is our moment in that 
kind of jinxes.

3890
02:49:19,290 --> 02:49:21,960
This is our moment.
This is the talking flip phone.

3891
02:49:22,020 --> 02:49:24,230
If you're worried about gypsy curse,
don't give up.

3892
02:49:25,190 --> 02:49:28,140
You talk about your last special.
Took a long time to get together.

3893
02:49:28,141 --> 02:49:31,700
This tickled took us a couple years ago.
Not even.

3894
02:49:31,770 --> 02:49:35,430
It came together pretty quick from 
montreal to a year later we shot it,

3895
02:49:36,210 --> 02:49:37,043
but like I feel like it's also like 
about our friendship or whatever you 

3896
02:49:43,141 --> 02:49:45,500
wanna call it for 25 years,
so it kind of puts,

3897
02:49:45,501 --> 02:49:48,120
uh,
puts a nice button on it.

3898
02:49:48,710 --> 02:49:50,220
Oh,
it's the first button maybe.

3899
02:49:50,280 --> 02:49:52,350
What are you doing over there?
You're mixing up.

3900
02:49:52,460 --> 02:49:54,630
Do I just don't want to leave my asHes 
here?

3901
02:49:55,560 --> 02:50:00,560
Dave has a lot of weird cigarette coffee
kind of straw so you're letting me smoke

3902
02:50:01,091 --> 02:50:01,430
in here.

3903
02:50:01,430 --> 02:50:02,370
was like,
thank you.

3904
02:50:03,330 --> 02:50:05,130
I'm glad it worked.
It works great.

3905
02:50:06,180 --> 02:50:10,890
If tHere's any like low spectrum people 
watching our show,

3906
02:50:10,891 --> 02:50:12,780
you can wish.
Watch dave and just cigarettes.

3907
02:50:13,350 --> 02:50:16,560
You'll learn a lot.
In my weird phobias.

3908
02:50:16,650 --> 02:50:19,390
Dice was the reason why I put it in my 
dyson.

3909
02:50:19,440 --> 02:50:22,620
How much is he smoking now?
He doesn't smoke as I haven't.

3910
02:50:22,621 --> 02:50:25,230
I haven't seen him in quite a while.
But last time you did the podcast,

3911
02:50:25,260 --> 02:50:26,093
was he.
Did he smoke the last time or a time 

3912
02:50:27,121 --> 02:50:28,830
before that?
He takes time off.

3913
02:50:28,831 --> 02:50:31,440
I think for awhile he would just bring 
them on the smoking.

3914
02:50:31,530 --> 02:50:33,610
He's smoking smoking a lot.
I saw him.

3915
02:50:33,710 --> 02:50:36,850
I came on his new podcast recently and 
um,

3916
02:50:36,920 --> 02:50:37,460
it's uh,
I'm,

3917
02:50:37,460 --> 02:50:38,820
I'm over here.
He made me,

3918
02:50:38,850 --> 02:50:42,840
he made me pretend he was half an hour 
late even though I was 10 minutes.

3919
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:44,453
He had a whole bit work that where I had
to go in the studio and just wait and 

3920
02:50:47,701 --> 02:50:51,390
talk to myself basically that he has to 
come in pretending he's late.

3921
02:50:52,320 --> 02:50:56,130
that was the only direction for an hour 
and a half.

3922
02:50:56,430 --> 02:50:57,450
It's so funny,
man.

3923
02:50:57,480 --> 02:51:00,270
That's,
he cracks me up so much my first time.

3924
02:51:00,540 --> 02:51:01,373
So my second time headlining was opening
for ray romano in poughkeepsie and dice 

3925
02:51:06,211 --> 02:51:09,570
is at the height of his fame.
I've dressed like I'm like,

3926
02:51:09,571 --> 02:51:13,520
you had to be to even get work.
And it's like I'm a jersey comic,

3927
02:51:13,530 --> 02:51:15,930
1990,
91 and dices at the,

3928
02:51:16,470 --> 02:51:17,190
at the,
uh,

3929
02:51:17,190 --> 02:51:20,130
poughkeepsie civic center right next 
door to the comedy club.

3930
02:51:20,670 --> 02:51:25,350
And uh,
and our hotel,

3931
02:51:25,830 --> 02:51:29,140
we heard dice was staying there.
People were pulling the fire alarm.

3932
02:51:29,170 --> 02:51:31,270
It's like it was like the biggest base 
of rockstar.

3933
02:51:31,290 --> 02:51:32,370
Yeah.
Pulling fire alarms.

3934
02:51:32,371 --> 02:51:35,160
Try to get everybody evacuated so dice 
would come out.

3935
02:51:35,161 --> 02:51:36,610
Right.
Fine.

3936
02:51:36,930 --> 02:51:39,390
Finally our show on his shows on 
saturday,

3937
02:51:39,420 --> 02:51:40,253
friday night.
Now ray romano was headlining at 

3938
02:51:41,731 --> 02:51:45,390
poughkeepsie whenever closed the 
bananas.

3939
02:51:46,230 --> 02:51:46,740
Oh yeah.

3940
02:51:46,740 --> 02:51:48,120
I remember that place.
And just,

3941
02:51:48,250 --> 02:51:49,083
I'm up there.
I'm doing my 10 slash 12 minute opening 

3942
02:51:50,941 --> 02:51:51,774
and through the darkness,
this guy I kind of recognized from like 

3943
02:51:55,650 --> 02:51:56,483
news articles was a club soda.
Kenny comes through the darkness with a 

3944
02:51:59,971 --> 02:52:00,804
note friday night and uh,
the note just says please welcome the 

3945
02:52:05,740 --> 02:52:09,690
king of comedy day.
So as I read it and the place was fine,

3946
02:52:10,640 --> 02:52:11,760
right?
Like so nice.

3947
02:52:11,930 --> 02:52:13,540
WAlks on stage,
he does whatever,

3948
02:52:13,541 --> 02:52:16,240
like a 15 minute guests at the crowd 
goes crazy.

3949
02:52:16,241 --> 02:52:18,520
They loved it.
And then I learned a lot.

3950
02:52:18,521 --> 02:52:19,354
Actually.
Ray romano came up as the headliner who 

3951
02:52:21,761 --> 02:52:22,594
was not known at all.
He wasn't on tv yet and killed raising 

3952
02:52:26,750 --> 02:52:28,660
crops,
but I Really learned like,

3953
02:52:28,690 --> 02:52:30,700
oh,
you know what the audience will follow.

3954
02:52:30,701 --> 02:52:32,710
We'll watch a great comic.
No matter what.

3955
02:52:32,711 --> 02:52:35,740
Just happened.
Ray was in his prime back then too

3956
02:52:36,350 --> 02:52:40,400
for read jimmy's comedy,
allie queens and ray was.

3957
02:52:40,430 --> 02:52:43,010
That was when ray was just.
He had done,

3958
02:52:43,400 --> 02:52:47,390
hbo had done something on hbo,
but he was just a machine man.

3959
02:52:47,420 --> 02:52:51,060
People like people didn't realize how 
mean he is a great time.

3960
02:52:51,070 --> 02:52:51,903
Those guys that people don't talk about 
when they talk about great standup 

3961
02:52:54,920 --> 02:52:55,753
comics because he hasn't put a lot of 
stuff out there in a long time ever 

3962
02:52:59,151 --> 02:53:00,290
since.
Everybody loves raymond.

3963
02:53:00,910 --> 02:53:02,390
A lot of stuff.
As far as the standup,

3964
02:53:02,600 --> 02:53:03,433
he just shot a netflix special at the 
seller so that should be coming out 

3965
02:53:06,291 --> 02:53:07,400
soon.
But you're right,

3966
02:53:07,401 --> 02:53:11,330
he hasn't put out anything until.
I think this is like his first real our.

3967
02:53:11,410 --> 02:53:13,730
So he.
I know he was working with Kevin James.

3968
02:53:13,731 --> 02:53:16,010
He did a bunch of gigs together.
Some I'm friends with kevin.

3969
02:53:16,420 --> 02:53:19,310
He goes on the road but he still murders
was my point.

3970
02:53:19,311 --> 02:53:20,950
That's right.
He's still merge

3971
02:53:21,330 --> 02:53:22,163
comic.
He was always so funny and you could 

3972
02:53:23,521 --> 02:53:24,354
always.
Someone wants to describe it like you 

3973
02:53:25,381 --> 02:53:27,540
could airdrop him anywhere and his go 
kill.

3974
02:53:27,600 --> 02:53:28,433
Yeah,
like anywhere in America before people 

3975
02:53:29,650 --> 02:53:31,530
relatable.
We're all kinda the same,

3976
02:53:31,590 --> 02:53:33,450
like we all kind of lift into the same 
stuff now,

3977
02:53:33,451 --> 02:53:36,030
but he's another guy like,
couldn't be a nicer guy.

3978
02:53:36,300 --> 02:53:37,133
One of the best.
He's always been really cool to me and 

3979
02:53:39,420 --> 02:53:40,253
you know,
like do the height of his fame never 

3980
02:53:41,551 --> 02:53:42,384
changed for a second.
[inaudible] never kind of weird how the 

3981
02:53:44,350 --> 02:53:47,910
asshole sort of disappear eventually.
You don't even know where they evaporate

3982
02:53:47,930 --> 02:53:50,960
too when I'm still here.
You know,

3983
02:53:51,020 --> 02:53:54,510
you're talking to,
you're talking about you're a comedIan.

3984
02:53:55,110 --> 02:53:58,950
You almost before you were an american.
That's when.

3985
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,430
And that doesn't mean I don't love my 
car.

3986
02:54:00,440 --> 02:54:03,620
I'm not trying to act like I'm very 
aware.

3987
02:54:04,000 --> 02:54:04,860
Of course.
Of course.

3988
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:09,300
You're so attached to being a comedian 
that's in my blood in a way that,

3989
02:54:09,690 --> 02:54:10,900
well,
do you feel more comfortable

3990
02:54:10,960 --> 02:54:11,793
comics and how devastating would it be 
if the other comics didn't want you 

3991
02:54:14,891 --> 02:54:19,390
around that man without a country 
that's,

3992
02:54:19,410 --> 02:54:22,450
that's where it gets fucking dark man,
right?

3993
02:54:22,540 --> 02:54:23,620
Yeah.
That's where it.

3994
02:54:23,670 --> 02:54:28,390
So anybody who falls into that group,
like if you fucked up,

3995
02:54:28,450 --> 02:54:30,900
like the whole thing is to be friends 
with the comedian.

3996
02:54:30,990 --> 02:54:32,750
Hang is what it's about,
you know,

3997
02:54:32,780 --> 02:54:33,230
the hang.

3998
02:54:33,230 --> 02:54:34,850
So how did you feel?
Let me ask you,

3999
02:54:34,851 --> 02:54:37,990
how did you feel when you were in self,
um,

4000
02:54:38,750 --> 02:54:39,720
you know,
you,

4001
02:54:39,760 --> 02:54:42,650
you pulled yourself out of the world at 
a comedy store where you started,

4002
02:54:42,651 --> 02:54:43,484
did you feel like on a desert island by 
yourself or did you find community at 

4003
02:54:47,481 --> 02:54:48,560
the other clubs or.

4004
02:54:48,700 --> 02:54:50,240
I never found the same thing,
uh,

4005
02:54:50,260 --> 02:54:54,250
but I just kept working and I always was
working with ari and joey and dunkin.

4006
02:54:54,251 --> 02:54:56,200
I still kept working with those guys.
So I was like,

4007
02:54:56,530 --> 02:54:57,363
I was working with most of the same 
comics and I was just doing practice 

4008
02:54:59,831 --> 02:55:03,530
sets at the ice house and at the improv 
I remember all that.

4009
02:55:03,600 --> 02:55:05,690
It's just,
to me it was more,

4010
02:55:05,900 --> 02:55:07,210
it was,
you know,

4011
02:55:07,280 --> 02:55:08,113
the hang was on the same.
I would do my psets the improv and just 

4012
02:55:10,641 --> 02:55:12,890
get the fuck out of there.
There's no place to hang out.

4013
02:55:12,970 --> 02:55:15,230
It's not like the same how you get to do
fun for sure.

4014
02:55:15,260 --> 02:55:17,930
You got to do stand up on the spot,
roast battle,

4015
02:55:17,931 --> 02:55:18,764
made room a oh are and whatever.
You'd figured out in the parking lot 

4016
02:55:22,101 --> 02:55:24,380
without him and then a podcast in the 
basement.

4017
02:55:24,381 --> 02:55:26,870
You could literally,
you can put a gym in there.

4018
02:55:26,870 --> 02:55:30,770
You'd probably never leave everything in
that place.

4019
02:55:30,860 --> 02:55:32,340
You could do three.
I've done three shows.

4020
02:55:32,360 --> 02:55:33,193
No,
I've done four shows in a night because 

4021
02:55:34,251 --> 02:55:36,260
one night I did two sets in the main 
room,

4022
02:55:36,261 --> 02:55:39,270
one set and the belly room and one set 
in the or because it was to show.

4023
02:55:39,271 --> 02:55:41,910
That's crazy to follow this 
motherfucker.

4024
02:55:41,911 --> 02:55:45,050
So many times everything I ever taped 
with you on the show,

4025
02:55:45,170 --> 02:55:47,690
I developed funnel having to try to 
follow him.

4026
02:55:47,710 --> 02:55:51,740
Wow.
Like steam rolling like civilization.

4027
02:55:51,770 --> 02:55:55,880
Everything from harvey weinstein to like
his own inner fucking craziness.

4028
02:55:56,070 --> 02:55:58,370
That's,
that's all in 20 minutes.

4029
02:55:58,371 --> 02:56:00,950
So it's like the,
the crowds,

4030
02:56:00,980 --> 02:56:01,580
you know,
like uh,

4031
02:56:01,580 --> 02:56:02,413
like a get spoiled when they see so many
great acts like just come by and just 

4032
02:56:06,200 --> 02:56:07,850
for like 10 bucks,
20 bucks,

4033
02:56:07,851 --> 02:56:09,770
whatever.
They get to see chris rock,

4034
02:56:10,600 --> 02:56:11,301
you,
joe.

4035
02:56:11,301 --> 02:56:13,070
and like,
just like people dropping by and working

4036
02:56:13,071 --> 02:56:14,160
on stuff they like.

4037
02:56:14,190 --> 02:56:16,400
Is it like this all the time?
Like you don't even get it.

4038
02:56:16,401 --> 02:56:19,040
You just saw a $500 show for like two 
drinks.

4039
02:56:19,041 --> 02:56:19,874
You know what?
I always say that to the people at the 

4040
02:56:21,030 --> 02:56:24,270
cellar to if you're a fan of comedy,
it's time.

4041
02:56:24,290 --> 02:56:26,090
That's what missing new year's right 
together.

4042
02:56:26,091 --> 02:56:29,420
And I attribute all this to the thing 
that you hate the web.

4043
02:56:29,450 --> 02:56:30,283
The internet did all this.
That's the reason why everybody's aware 

4044
02:56:32,451 --> 02:56:34,610
of how fun it is to go to a live comedy 
show.

4045
02:56:34,940 --> 02:56:35,773
How fun it is to watch guys.
Like they'll go to see you at the store 

4046
02:56:39,140 --> 02:56:41,000
and then they go to see you again six 
months later and go,

4047
02:56:41,030 --> 02:56:41,863
oh,
that fucking comedy central and hbo and 

4048
02:56:44,721 --> 02:56:45,554
showtime and netflix and all the ones 
that comedy central definitely made it 

4049
02:56:50,271 --> 02:56:52,010
for sure.
Comedy central for sure.

4050
02:56:52,011 --> 02:56:53,690
All those things definitely attribute to
it.

4051
02:56:53,720 --> 02:56:56,660
But what about evening at the improv 
tube is one of the biggest factors.

4052
02:56:56,900 --> 02:56:58,850
The fact that people can watch,
stand up on youtube,

4053
02:56:58,851 --> 02:56:59,684
that's a giant factor.
The amount of people that are watching 

4054
02:57:00,981 --> 02:57:04,310
youtube is off the charts and the fact 
that they can Just type in right now,

4055
02:57:04,460 --> 02:57:05,293
Jeff Ross,
standup comedy poom and instantaneously 

4056
02:57:07,161 --> 02:57:10,070
get it and a lot of those clips come 
from comedy central,

4057
02:57:10,940 --> 02:57:12,710
hbo and all those other places,
which is great.

4058
02:57:12,740 --> 02:57:14,480
It's like it's all.
It all contributes.

4059
02:57:14,481 --> 02:57:19,040
Not one thing that did it,
but I think the one big important factor

4060
02:57:19,041 --> 02:57:22,100
was this new channel of distribution and
that's the internet,

4061
02:57:22,130 --> 02:57:22,963
whether it's netflix,
which is probably one of the biggest 

4062
02:57:24,591 --> 02:57:27,110
thing right now for stand up comedy 
specials ever.

4063
02:57:27,460 --> 02:57:28,293
RiGht.
And there's never been a thing like 

4064
02:57:29,241 --> 02:57:30,074
netflix,
well look what we're doing three 

4065
02:57:31,790 --> 02:57:32,980
episodes.
It's like,

4066
02:57:33,140 --> 02:57:34,490
exactly.
Who else would let you do that?

4067
02:57:34,640 --> 02:57:38,090
Well will take the pressure oFf like one
shiny special,

4068
02:57:38,180 --> 02:57:39,200
you know,
like you can do,

4069
02:57:39,210 --> 02:57:42,620
be more creative with how you present 
your art.

4070
02:57:42,920 --> 02:57:43,753
Oh yeah.
Well if you wanted to do a two parter 

4071
02:57:45,350 --> 02:57:46,183
next time,
you could narrow it right already did 

4072
02:57:49,030 --> 02:57:49,863
with.
That was not the one that he's working 

4073
02:57:52,101 --> 02:57:52,934
on right now,
but the last one that's right in the 

4074
02:57:54,321 --> 02:57:55,330
same place.
Yeah.

4075
02:57:55,760 --> 02:57:56,520
Yeah.
That red,

4076
02:57:56,520 --> 02:57:57,920
so good man,
he's out there.

4077
02:57:57,950 --> 02:58:01,920
Our review was harping on was Like the 
comedy is

4078
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:05,520
completely reinvented lately,
but do it as a series.

4079
02:58:05,550 --> 02:58:08,130
You could do whatever you want that as a
comedy fan,

4080
02:58:08,131 --> 02:58:11,130
netflix is perfect because you know you 
don't have to.

4081
02:58:11,710 --> 02:58:14,020
You get to control what you see,
you know,

4082
02:58:14,040 --> 02:58:17,700
and you can watch it and stop it and 
watch it more and even stop it.

4083
02:58:18,050 --> 02:58:20,250
I was watching her show when it came out
last night.

4084
02:58:20,251 --> 02:58:21,084
I was just laying in bed watching our 
new show because I was by my sister and 

4085
02:58:24,061 --> 02:58:26,280
like when it gets to the end of the 
episodes,

4086
02:58:26,310 --> 02:58:31,310
you've got nowhere.
That remote is try to get you to binge.

4087
02:58:32,940 --> 02:58:34,610
Come on,
you don't understand.

4088
02:58:34,620 --> 02:58:36,880
It's like,
oh man.

4089
02:58:38,180 --> 02:58:43,080
Another episode for this episode ends 
with dave just looking in the camera and

4090
02:58:43,081 --> 02:58:45,330
being like,
our next episode starts at five,

4091
02:58:45,360 --> 02:58:46,193
four,
three.

4092
02:58:47,070 --> 02:58:47,890
I heard that you

4093
02:58:47,890 --> 02:58:50,080
god.
See the new mike judge,

4094
02:58:50,310 --> 02:58:54,340
an animated show about country music 
called the band.

4095
02:58:54,341 --> 02:58:55,174
What is it called?
Road stories from something that sounds

great.

That guy posted down the nominal.
My love,

podcast.

4100
02:59:05,200 --> 02:59:06,033
What is it called?
Tales from the tour bus from the tour 

4101
02:59:08,141 --> 02:59:08,974
buses supposed to be insanely funny.
It's about George Jones and all those 

4102
02:59:12,341 --> 02:59:13,174
guys,
but it's all like gunplay and drugs and 

4103
02:59:15,791 --> 02:59:17,470
chaos,
country music stuff,

4104
02:59:17,471 --> 02:59:19,900
and then they animate like the story.
It's really cool.

4105
02:59:19,930 --> 02:59:21,550
He really is a talented guy.
Man.

4106
02:59:21,551 --> 02:59:25,900
Funk music creates this one.
Uh,

4107
02:59:26,200 --> 02:59:27,033
yes,
that's it.

4108
02:59:27,190 --> 02:59:30,550
Here's one of the ways I thought it was 
all country guys.

4109
02:59:30,551 --> 02:59:31,780
Yeah,
I thought so too.

4110
02:59:31,781 --> 02:59:32,614
But there's a different maybe separate 
seasons or something that the highway 

4111
02:59:36,791 --> 02:59:41,620
man click on highway man.
So that's with Willie Willie Nelson.

4112
02:59:41,680 --> 02:59:43,000
Willie nelson.

4115
02:59:50,350 --> 02:59:51,880
That's just a song.
highway been.

4116
02:59:52,210 --> 02:59:55,550
So that's the song.
The highwaymen when they all got song,

4117
02:59:55,710 --> 02:59:57,340
that mega group.
Yeah,

4118
02:59:57,341 --> 02:59:59,830
but that's not an episode of the show 
is.

4119
02:59:59,940 --> 03:00:03,510
This is a playlist of songs.
Oh.

4120
03:00:03,920 --> 03:00:05,400
Oh,
confusion.

4121
03:00:05,630 --> 03:00:07,600
So I went to their webpage here and.
Oh,

4122
03:00:07,601 --> 03:00:08,434
I get it.
This must be a new season whether they 

4123
03:00:10,060 --> 03:00:11,290
use in the seventies,
people.

4124
03:00:11,350 --> 03:00:13,730
Do you know that song highwayman?
Yeah,

4125
03:00:14,030 --> 03:00:19,030
that's star stars across the universe to
vive and when I reached the other side,

4126
03:00:20,830 --> 03:00:22,540
that's a creepy song,
right?

4127
03:00:22,541 --> 03:00:26,080
It's about reincarnation and you never 
fade away.

4128
03:00:26,290 --> 03:00:29,800
Yeah.
People built this country.

4129
03:00:30,070 --> 03:00:31,350
Yeah,

4130
03:00:31,430 --> 03:00:33,220

But getting them all together.

4131
03:00:33,221 --> 03:00:35,380
I wonder what that was like.

4132
03:00:35,400 --> 03:00:36,010
