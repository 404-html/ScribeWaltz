1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
You're saying how,
how promotions work?

2
00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:04,530
Yeah.
Here we go.

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,520
Four,
three,

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,480
two,
one.

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,760
So Tom pop and I are sitting here.
USA.

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:13,110
Do you,
did you see the fight on Saturday night?

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,180
And he said,
the guy that got knocked down,

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,890
mental health,
mental health guy,

9
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,750
the guy got up for everyone with mental 
health.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,060
But you said no,
I didn't see the fight.

11
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,370
Like I only saw.
I only saw that.

12
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,730
How narratives work.
Yeah.

13
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:28,050
You know what I mean?
Like in this day and age especially,

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,840
there's way too much information out 
there,

15
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:31,674
right?
Like there's no way you could see every 

16
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,520
television show or watch every sporting 
event or,

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,290
or no,
every scandal.

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,500
So when something happens,
like the blurb,

19
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,230
the,
the little summary that I have absorbed,

20
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,360
my,
my one buddy watched it on instagram,

21
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:46,194
he posted a thing and it was very 
heartfelt that he got up for all the 

22
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,800
people with mental health.

23
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,093
And uh,
I read that and I feel like I 

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,910
experienced the whole thing.
But,

25
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:54,481
you know,
it's funny,

26
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:56,800
I don't know if he won or lost.
I know he got to draw,

27
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:58,320
draw,
draw.

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,700
Okay.
And uh,

29
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,593
I don't have a firm opinion on whether 
or not the draw was justified because I 

30
00:01:05,161 --> 00:01:09,810
only watched it once.
I thought I thought that Tyson fewer one

31
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,710
most of the rounds except the two that 
he got knocked down in tysons.

32
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:15,530
The anti mental health guy.
No,

33
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,360
he's the white guy who,
he's the white guy that got knocked down

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,360
and Deontay wilder.
He's.

35
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,763
Is he strange in that?
He has like the most freaky punching 

36
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,290
power I think I've ever seen ever.
That's what I heard too.

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:32,280
Big Guy.
I mean for a heavyweight.

38
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:34,800
He's 212 pounds.
He looks pretty big though.

39
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:37,020
He's Jack.
He shredded.

40
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:38,440
He has no fat on them whatsoever.

41
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,100
Back is where all the power is.
And that's where I was.

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,930
His muscle is like,
you see his back.

43
00:01:42,931 --> 00:01:45,780
It's just fucking,
just a bundle of snakes.

44
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,963
But I saw the clip.
He knocked him out and then backed up 

45
00:01:49,351 --> 00:01:51,060
and dance.
Iceland got up.

46
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,200
Yeah.
That guy.

47
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,480
Fuck that guy.
Wilder punches so hard.

48
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,490
And that was in the twelfth and final 
round.

49
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,010
That was a fight where he was mostly 
losing.

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,640
He was mostly getting boxed up.
It was mostly getting out boxed,

51
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,720
but then he would land and he landed 
real hard and like,

52
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,610
what was it,
like the eighth or the ninth,

53
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,510
something like that,
something like that.

54
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:12,500
He dropped him,
but that wasn't a big knockdown.

55
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,120
He knocked him down,
but he got up pretty quick and he was.

56
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,103
He was okay,
but in the twelfth he fucking blasted 

57
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:21,240
him.
He hit him with a right hand and then as

58
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,074
he was falling,
he hit him with a left hook on the chin 

59
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:24,324
as he was going down,
like any laid flat on his back with his 

60
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:27,210
arms down.

61
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,580
He looked unconscious.
Yeah,

62
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,414
he really did.
And then he rose like Lazarus and he 

63
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:34,830
looked pretty sharp when he got on his 
feet,

64
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,470
one of the rest of the round,
he wanted to rest around the stung him.

65
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,960
He stunned.
Deontay wilder.

66
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,090
It was crazy because of the mental 
health kids.

67
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,103
Yes.
He was doing it for the mental health 

68
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:44,784
people.
You think that's really what he was 

69
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:47,610
thinking when you're getting up off the 
canvas?

70
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,800
I'm doing it for the kid.
I would never doubt him.

71
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,990
Yeah,
he.

72
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,550
He really does.
He's,

73
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,480
he's in a very unusual guy and he 
donated his entire purse to charity.

74
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,490
It like $8 dollars.
Really?

75
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,091
Yeah.
Yeah.

76
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:03,550
He donated all of it to charity.
Holy Cow.

77
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,940
That's great.
These are fucking really unusual guy.

78
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:07,930
He was.
He's been in here.

79
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:11,260
He was in the podcast when he was 
gearing up for the fight,

80
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,780
so I should call them the super nice 
mental health guy.

81
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,710
He's a very nice guy.
Very nice guy.

82
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,440
Big giant six,
nine,

83
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,430
sixth.
So he was sitting here.

84
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:21,320
You feel like he's shoes?
A giant,

85
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,670
super sweetheart.
Friendly Guy.

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,040
Geez.
You're really well spoken.

87
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,860
He's got that heavy travelers accent.
He's a traveler.

88
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,850
Had He made money before?
Oh yeah.

89
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,330
He's a world champion,
so he's like,

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,390
he was a world champion bank and almost 
killed himself in a Ferrari,

91
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,450
almost committed suicide and he was 
headed towards a bridge.

92
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:40,284
He was going gonna fucking either 
slamming into the bridge or drive off 

93
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,920
the bridge.
That was his.

94
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,020
Yeah,
he was going 60 miles an hour,

95
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:48,300
like headed towards the bridge and you 
change his mind.

96
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,870
That's what he looked like before he 
started his comeback.

97
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,000
Yeah,
he was 300 pounds,

98
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,330
300 plus,
right.

99
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:59,760
How much they say it was safe for 85,
but yeah,

100
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:03,470
something crazy because he's saying 300 
kilograms.

101
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:07,560
So that's like,
what is it?

102
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,110
Close to 400 pounds.
Oh my God.

103
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,993
He's.
So he was champion and he fell off and 

104
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,420
became that Chubby.

105
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,373
Well,
what happened was he beat Vladimir 

106
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,120
Klitschko who was a long time 
heavyweight champion.

107
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,460
I mean flooded Makoto was there,
remember champ forever.

108
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,893
And he out boxed him like soundly 
outboxed him and beat him and then was 

109
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:29,904
like now what?
And went into a depression and start 

110
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,850
drinking hard,
partying,

111
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:33,684
hard.
A lot of cocaine and just fucked his 

112
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:38,370
life up just as he achieved what he 
wanted to achieve.

113
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,890
I mean he's calling it mental health,
you know,

114
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,360
because of depression and all those 
things.

115
00:04:42,361 --> 00:04:45,810
But part of me wants to say that a lot 
of that is.

116
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,980
I mean,
I don't know,

117
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,810
obviously I've never been inside of his 
head,

118
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,900
but when you're doing that much coke and
drinking that much,

119
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,070
that is got to be a major factor in why 
you feel like shit.

120
00:04:56,071 --> 00:04:56,904
And then the let down of this incredible
achievement becoming the heavyweight 

121
00:05:00,751 --> 00:05:03,810
champion of the world,
beating this guy who hadn't been beat in

122
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,460
a long time,
many,

123
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,420
many,
many years,

124
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,243
and then you know,
just partying too hard and then getting 

125
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:14,040
into a horrible funk and deciding to 
come back.

126
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,330
So is that part of it where you know,
you know,

127
00:05:17,331 --> 00:05:18,164
that you have that.
There are those personalities and 

128
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,490
there's genetics involved and he gets 
you into the drugs,

129
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,773
but then the drugs start going to work 
on your brain and then it becomes 

130
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:27,914
something different.
It becomes no longer your own 

131
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:32,144
consciousness that's working.
It's this sponge that just absorbs all 

132
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:39,400
of these toxins and who knows what's 
misfiring,

133
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,810
what's happening at that point.
We say that as we drink wine.

134
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,490
Cheers.
Happy holidays.

135
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:47,890
Thank you for heroin in the holidays.
Whatever little fucking meth.

136
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,280
I was going to bring you some wine 
today.

137
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:52,160
This was nice you to open this.
This is good stuff.

138
00:05:52,161 --> 00:05:54,050
Whatever this is.
I don't know Jack Shit about one.

139
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,800
I learned a great method for 
Thanksgiving wine.

140
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:00,350
What's the.
I went to this place in la.

141
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:04,130
It's called a 2020 wine.
It's like this.

142
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,350
It looks like right here.
This is the last dark.

143
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:07,420
It's on the,
on the four.

144
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:10,700
Oh five.
And you just walk in and just wine.

145
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:14,600
This huge room racks and stuff.
It's so elegant.

146
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:17,180
It's just like this great place to be.
It's cool.

147
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,043
It's like temperature wise,
it's like it's great and it's 

148
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,350
intimidating because they have,
you know,

149
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:24,650
I don't know that much about wine I want
to,

150
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,513
but.
And I realized this was my strategy and 

151
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:28,814
it worked out perfectly.
I went to the guy who works there and I 

152
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,690
said,
look,

153
00:06:32,691 --> 00:06:35,330
I have 12 people coming over for 
thanksgiving.

154
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,830
Show me a $20 bottle of wine or less 
that I can buy a bunch of for my friends

155
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,060
that's going to blow everyone away.
And he lit up like a Christmas tree.

156
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,180
It's like,
this is what he wants to do.

157
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:50,901
It's like,
yeah,

158
00:06:50,901 --> 00:06:53,840
there's 200 bottles,
dollar bottles of wine.

159
00:06:53,841 --> 00:06:54,674
We know what that is.
I'm going to come with me and there it 

160
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:57,884
is.
And he took me into the back and he 

161
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:01,094
found these.
He's like,

162
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,220
this one's from Spain,
$18.

163
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:07,040
No one knows it exists.
The best wine I've had all year,

164
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,780
another one and this Italian Barolo that
nobody knows about it,

165
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,623
and look at this,
it's only $12 a bottle because nobody 

166
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,460
knows we have an extra cases.
It became like his.

167
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,980
Of course,
that's what a wine guy wants to do.

168
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,023
Turn you on.

169
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,420
Is the wine thing that a name is just as
important as how good it is?

170
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,500
Sure,
yeah.

171
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,870
Like when people,
you know,

172
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:31,950
an opus one or a famous or like,
we all know that because that's like the

173
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,870
Mercedes of wines.
Cigars are like that as well.

174
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:36,240
I know more about to go.
I don't know much about cigars,

175
00:07:36,241 --> 00:07:37,074
but I know more about cigars that I know
about wine and like everybody wants a 

176
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:44,341
Cuban cute Cohiba oh,
wants something that's

177
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,420
hard to get.
Yeah.

178
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,980
But this was.
I was like,

179
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,330
Oh,
this is how you should do it.

180
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:51,164
Find a good wine shop and go to the guy 
who's waiting to be asked that question 

181
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:58,610
and he so excited to show you what he 
learned and he works in a wine shop.

182
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,400
So he's not spending $500 for a bottle 
either.

183
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,413
Me and my shit.
My Buddy Mark Telegraph and I were in 

184
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:05,414
Florida.
We're eating this very nice time 

185
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:08,000
restaurant with a bunch of people from 
the UFC.

186
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,640
We just said,
let's get a nice bottle of wine.

187
00:08:10,641 --> 00:08:12,440
You're have a nice bottle of wine.
I'm like,

188
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,393
I've had good bottles of wine,
but this place had like bought bottles 

189
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,400
wine from the seventies.
Right.

190
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,141
So I said,
all right,

191
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,710
let's go fucking crazy.
I bought a bottle of wine from 1974.

192
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,800
Oh my God,
this is better.

193
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:25,510
This is better.
This one's better.

194
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,410
It was like,
it was weird.

195
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,013
I guess if you're a real connoisseur,
like part of it is like Roberto Duran 

196
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:37,500
was the champ when this will bottled 
stuff and stuff about.

197
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,870
It was in the third grade,
something Mrs Mcmillan.

198
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,420
It was like,
it felt like it had less alcohol.

199
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,640
And I think that's,
uh,

200
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,873
one of the things that maybe happens,
the flavor sorts starts to morph and 

201
00:08:53,931 --> 00:08:55,620
change.
It just felt less

202
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,920
potent,
almost more watered down.

203
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,920
It wasn't that good.
I enjoyed it,

204
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,090
but I didn't love it.
Right.

205
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,163
And that,
you know,

206
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,510
and you probably paid a lot for.
It was like a thousand dollars.

207
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,160
I'm not joking.
Yeah,

208
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,710
I think it was a thousand dollar bottle 
of wine.

209
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,970
I'm telling you,
this Thanksgiving we had it.

210
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,260
It was $18 bottles of wine.
It's probably way bigger.

211
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,310
Heads off.
Yeah,

212
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,820
probably way better.
So great.

213
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,620
They're there,
you know,

214
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,454
I try and learn about them and there are
certain wines they say like there's 

215
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,604
certain Brunellos that like those should
age and those you can go like 20 years 

216
00:09:27,271 --> 00:09:28,104
and you know,
they'll get even better at 30 and then 

217
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:32,640
there's other wines at that same amount 
of time.

218
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,570
They'll go sour and they'll get funky.
So it's so hard to tell.

219
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,090
Yeah.
APP that I have,

220
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:41,520
I've never fucking opened at.
Once I had downloaded it.

221
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:42,523
It's like Vino Vino,
we almost went down with that write on 

222
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:47,130
the board.
Oh,

223
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:48,360
it's got a power ballad.
Nice.

224
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,580
Because that was headed towards the 
board team.

225
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,690
Same.
He's not even drinking.

226
00:09:51,691 --> 00:09:53,730
I don't fuck with laptops in front of me
anymore.

227
00:09:53,731 --> 00:09:57,030
I've learned my lesson.
I was doing a show on Saturday.

228
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,893
My friend had a laptop,
she had a glass of water and a salad on 

229
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,630
the keyboard.
I'm like,

230
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,320
what are you having a gun in your baby's
head?

231
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,350
Rest your head on the gun separated now,
but this was,

232
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,263
this was such a great way to do it.
I mean there's so you can focus in on 

233
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:18,354
one kind of wine and really kind of 
learn it and that's a lot like that 

234
00:10:21,481 --> 00:10:22,314
would be a lot of studying to learn all 
of wine and like go into a fancy 

235
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,260
restaurant and be like,
I'm just going to pick from you.

236
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,980
Can,
you know?

237
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:33,000
It's one of those things where you have 
to.

238
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,280
You really have to talk to someone who's
putting the time.

239
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,930
Yes,
totally.

240
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,711
That's,
yeah,

241
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:40,020
my keys.
Here's something that I know a lot about

242
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,243
pool cues,

243
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:42,770
right?
I know a lot about pool,

244
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,330
so if you come to me and you say,
Hey,

245
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm thinking about buying this pool cue,
what do you think of?

246
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:51,590
Okay,
well here's what you need to know.

247
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,663
Like that's a.
that's a very expensive pool cue and 

248
00:10:54,171 --> 00:10:55,004
it's expensive because it's a 
collector's item because the guy who 

249
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:57,800
makes it as dead.
However,

250
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,693
in terms of like how it plays,
it does not play any better than a pool 

251
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:01,934
cue that crossed one small fraction of 
what that costs and then I could turn 

252
00:11:05,121 --> 00:11:10,121
you onto a bunch of custom pool cue 
makers that make a really good cue for a

253
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:11,724
fraction of what you would pay for that 
cue and I'm telling you like you would 

254
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,730
play with this queue and be happy with 
it for the rest of your life,

255
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,040
but it will cost you $500 as opposed to 
there's cues that are $15,000,

256
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,380
$20,000
and up.

257
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,960
It's a really ornate and beautiful

258
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,063
and this is a lifetime.
Your adult lifetime of learning about 

259
00:11:30,501 --> 00:11:31,300
this.
Oh Man,

260
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:31,980
I've been immersed.

261
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,980
I started playing pool in 1990,
91.

262
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:37,860
90,
91.

263
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:39,450
That's when I probably bought my first 
pool cue.

264
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,740
What's a good.
What's a good pool cue for bumper pool?

265
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,473
My neighbors,
my neighbors had a bumper pool table 

266
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:49,130
when I was a kid.
It was bad ass.

267
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,060
It's pretty stupid.
So stupid and dumb game.

268
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,753
The

269
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,743
older brother Mark,
he was the dominant one because he was 

270
00:11:57,671 --> 00:12:00,970
able to jump over the bumpers and get on
the other side.

271
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,410
Cheating.
Cheating.

272
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,383
Yeah.
The jumping is a very controversial 

273
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,140
thing in the world of pool.
You're not allowed to jump.

274
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,123
Well,
you can butt attack jumping and then 

275
00:12:11,321 --> 00:12:13,060
there's bar table jumping.
Right?

276
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:13,894
Like when you play with people on a bar,
they think they're jumping in the pool 

277
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:16,923
cue,
but what they're doing is they're 

278
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,490
scooping under the cue ball with their 
tip,

279
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,120
like they go under it and it sort of 
makes the cue ball pop up in the air.

280
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:26,110
It's really like.
Yeah,

281
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,190
Ms Dot cueings.
What?

282
00:12:27,191 --> 00:12:28,024
It's like the way you're supposed to 
jump a ball has shoot down on it and 

283
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,930
make it hop over.
Let's imagine,

284
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,200
have you seen this before?
Yeah,

285
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:36,910
that's an expense.
That's a Mcdermott.

286
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,913
Um,
it's called the excalibur or some shit 

287
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:40,000
like that.

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,470
That's a pool cue.
Shit is,

289
00:12:41,471 --> 00:12:43,900
but it isn't.
It's foolish.

290
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,320
It looks like a sickle that the grim 
reaper comes to do away with.

291
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,293
Well,
this was a cute that was made a long 

292
00:12:49,931 --> 00:12:51,940
time ago.
It was made back in the fucking nineties

293
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:52,774
or something,
but that's not the most expensive pool 

294
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:55,150
cue in the world.
Does that whole thing?

295
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:55,984
The q says it sold for $150.
That's not the most expensive shoe in 

296
00:12:58,631 --> 00:12:59,440
the world.
No,

297
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,273
no.
The most expensive cue in the world is 

298
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:02,103
Gina.
Gina Q is actually right here in north 

299
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:05,974
Hollywood.
That's,

300
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,810
they call it the most expensive in the 
world.

301
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:08,890
It's that whole thing.
The Queue.

302
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,740
That's nonsense.
That's not to stand in a queue seat.

303
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,390
It's a acute,
that whole,

304
00:13:13,391 --> 00:13:16,330
all the blades and everything like that.
What would you do with nonsense?

305
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,530
It's nonsense.
I'm telling you.

306
00:13:17,531 --> 00:13:19,330
It's nonsense.
It's nonsense.

307
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,790
It's like having a car and you decided 
to glue diamonds on it.

308
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,760
It's fucking stupid with calling the 
wall.

309
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,310
Fuck up.
That cue weighs nine and a half pounds.

310
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,980
You know what a real cute ways.
A very heavy q,

311
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,120
very heavy is 21 ounces.
Like if you play with it,

312
00:13:37,121 --> 00:13:39,730
like you find out that a pro plays with 
20 miles could be like,

313
00:13:39,731 --> 00:13:42,010
wow,
that's rarely a guy will play with it.

314
00:13:42,011 --> 00:13:43,450
Twenty four rounds Cuban.
You're like,

315
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,650
wow,
that guy's crazy.

316
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,573
What was that thing?
Thing is nine and a half pounds a piece 

317
00:13:48,341 --> 00:13:49,380
of shit.
It's like the.

318
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,720
The women that get the gigantic hippity 
hops for boobs getting bigger than that.

319
00:13:57,131 --> 00:14:01,510
When you're like triples the boobs.
That's just not a real pool.

320
00:14:01,511 --> 00:14:03,310
Cute.
What's the one in North Hollywood?

321
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,900
Well,
he makes.

322
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,540
His name is Ernie Cortez and he makes 
all sorts.

323
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,870
I have one of his cues that's earning 
right there.

324
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,510
Makes.
I mean he wasn't married to share.

325
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,010
No,
that's Sonny Bono.

326
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,630
You're an asshole.

327
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,590
I got in this podcast now I'm.
Ernie is A.

328
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,980
I mean he's like a real innovator in the
world of pool cues.

329
00:14:26,981 --> 00:14:28,200
He makes beautiful,
beautiful.

330
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:29,034
That is beautiful.
But he had one that he made that was 

331
00:14:31,451 --> 00:14:33,220
filled with.
Like I thought,

332
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,030
I don't want to say what the material 
was by believing the handle.

333
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,133
The handle was made out of solid ivory 
and I'm thinking it had a gold and all 

334
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:44,170
sorts of other shit in it,
but it went for half a million dollars.

335
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,233
It's worth a half million dollars,
but I think the deal is that he won't 

336
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,340
sell it.
He's very wealth.

337
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,960
Whereas really well that offer.
Making sure.

338
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:52,180
Yeah.

339
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,880
Yeah.
His,

340
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,780
his pool cues like in Japan and also all
throughout Asia.

341
00:14:56,781 --> 00:14:58,490
They're,
they're really revered,

342
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,343
like he sell his stuff anywhere.
His accuser very expensive on the 

343
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,430
aftermarket too.
It makes them all by hand.

344
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,540
Like that kind of thing.
Well,

345
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:10,310
he designs them all and then he uses a 
computer controlled machines.

346
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:13,640
They're called CNC machines to put 
everything together and piece it so that

347
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:14,930
everything's perfect.
Wow.

348
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:15,823
Yeah.
But they're all like his designs and 

349
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,310
that like three d printing.
No,

350
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,211
no.
It's,

351
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,800
um,
it's what it is,

352
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:26,030
is like you have a design and you put it
into this computer and you put the spa,

353
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,940
I don't know,
on 100 percent of the process,

354
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:29,774
but you put your specifications like how
wide you want in lays to be and they 

355
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:41,351
make them exactly the same size and the 
points fit exactly the same way.

356
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,140
Wow.

357
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,570
Yeah.
It's all super complicated stuff.

358
00:15:44,571 --> 00:15:45,404
But the point is like if you were a guy 
who wanted to buy a pool cue and you 

359
00:15:49,641 --> 00:15:51,080
just,
you know,

360
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:53,140
went to a website,
right?

361
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,470
You're,
you're lost.

362
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,020
You're lost.
Like me trying to buy one shot.

363
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,880
Yeah.
The fuck I'm looking at.

364
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,840
Right,
exactly.

365
00:15:59,841 --> 00:16:00,674
Yeah.
It's weird.

366
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:01,970
Yeah.
This is good.

367
00:16:01,971 --> 00:16:06,971
Wine though is good.
This is a scissors to big news.

368
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,110
I didn't know you spoke French to do we,
we see fit.

369
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:15,890
Paris is going crazy right now given 
having these crazy riots know what's up.

370
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:16,963
Every time I think about visiting Paris,
there's some new shit that goes down 

371
00:16:20,181 --> 00:16:21,080
over there.
I know.

372
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:25,310
It's kind of feels like a little like a,
like a jewel box is about to explode.

373
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,820
All good man.
It's not good.

374
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,680
Is it workers?
What kind of riot?

375
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,320
Well,
the weird thing is everyone is riding is

376
00:16:33,321 --> 00:16:37,160
wearing those reflective vests,
like see that?

377
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,223
Yeah.
They're wearing these yellow reflective 

378
00:16:40,971 --> 00:16:43,550
vests and lightened things on fire and 
smashing store.

379
00:16:43,551 --> 00:16:44,384
So like who is Gucci?
And these protestors have been going to 

380
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,870
scroll back up.
So we got silent,

381
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:52,220
says 17 pictures.
Oh,

382
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,260
it's terrible.
And it keeps getting worse.

383
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:55,783
It keeps getting worse.
I mean it started November 17th when 

384
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:01,190
French driver supporting yellow vests 
led a demonstration apparently has to do

385
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:05,510
with oil prices rising.
Rising fuel prices 280,000

386
00:17:05,511 --> 00:17:06,980
people.
Four people have died,

387
00:17:06,981 --> 00:17:07,814
hundreds have been injured,
thousands of dollars with the property 

388
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,880
has been damaged.
The protest started November 17th.

389
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:15,890
French driver sporting yellow vest led a
demonstration of 20,000

390
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:16,724
people across the country to push back 
against the rising taxes on gas and 

391
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:23,060
diesel.
A French President Emmanuel,

392
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,573
I love a nice microphone as part of his 
many economic reforms and announced the 

393
00:17:29,421 --> 00:17:33,290
gas taxes early this year to minimize 
Francis reliance on fossil fuels.

394
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,890
That's a fucking shitty way she handle,
you know,

395
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,350
reliance on fossil fuels.
You do the opposite.

396
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,170
You cunt face,
you don't charge people money.

397
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,283
You know,
you don't charge people extra money and 

398
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:45,074
make it more expensive than they'll use 
it unless you give them subsidies for 

399
00:17:48,111 --> 00:17:49,740
electric cars.
You stupid prick.

400
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:50,330
Yes.

401
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,440
Once you understand the American way,
you piece of shit.

402
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,330
I love talking about things.
I know nothing about.

403
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,643
What does it say?
Scroll back to where it was a the price 

404
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,260
of fuel.
That's it.

405
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,180
Thirty cents a gallon.
They went crazy.

406
00:18:06,181 --> 00:18:07,620
Thirty cents a gallon trying to kill 
people.

407
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:10,750
Gas already costs about $7 per gallon.
What?

408
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,233
Fuck that.
So it's just going to break people's 

409
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:14,934
backs and they drive you to.
The Bush was leaving office and they 

410
00:18:19,351 --> 00:18:22,830
jacked the fucking price of gas.
Way Up Dude.

411
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,050
But there's people that were panicking.
Yeah.

412
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,750
September 11th.
There's like lines everywhere because we

413
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:28,280
thought,
Ryan,

414
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,113
I just empty the price.
Didn't I don't think the price rattling 

415
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,853
you went up.
Some places were charge like 25 bucks a 

416
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:40,950
gallon they should go to jail.
But that's,

417
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:43,980
that's kind of insane that people used 
to have riots like that when,

418
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,860
when we would spike and people couldn't 
eat this,

419
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,680
they like,
oh my God,

420
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,180
that's a shitty little car.

421
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,013
Anyway,
I probably wanted to lie that empire 

422
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,940
finally.
He's not even part of the protests.

423
00:18:56,941 --> 00:19:01,941
He's just talking to me about this.
Somebody was telling me about this.

424
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,550
I was at a little kids.
Pardon me.

425
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:07,530
I was talking to one of the dads and he 
was telling me about this,

426
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,200
uh,
thing that happened,

427
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:13,620
this,
I think it was in northern California.

428
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,900
It was a fire,
fucking might not have been.

429
00:19:15,901 --> 00:19:18,890
Northern California was a fire.
And um,

430
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,530
initially they thought it was just a 
fire,

431
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,740
but then the CEO and his vice president,
we're both of their houses caught fire.

432
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:32,063
So then they thought it was like an 
attack on both people and then they 

433
00:19:35,161 --> 00:19:35,994
realized no,
it was a murder and one of the guys 

434
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:42,630
killed the guy and his family and then 
lit his house on fire and then went back

435
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:43,464
to his house and lit his own house on 
fire to make it look like they were 

436
00:19:46,111 --> 00:19:46,620
going after.

437
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,650
Both of them and he's the only one that 
survived.

438
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,760
Yeah.
Whoops.

439
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,430
This happened in New Jersey,
a guy in New Jersey.

440
00:19:53,431 --> 00:19:54,630
Maybe that was.
It got murdered.

441
00:19:54,631 --> 00:19:56,970
His whole family.
His own family.

442
00:19:56,971 --> 00:19:59,250
Yeah.
And then lit the house on fire.

443
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,223
Maybe that's it.
Maybe I'm getting fucked up version of 

444
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:02,400
the story.
I get drunk.

445
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:03,780
A kid parties to.
Oh,

446
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,813
it's the only way to go by family 
massacred disguises a massive fire in 

447
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:08,641
New Jersey.
Yeah,

448
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:09,930
that's it.
This is the story.

449
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,380
So make that a little larger police.
It says,

450
00:20:13,381 --> 00:20:14,214
uh,
there was more of a brotherly bond 

451
00:20:14,731 --> 00:20:16,230
between Paul and Keith.
Yeah,

452
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:17,064
that's right.
Part of New Jersey on vacation together 

453
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,490
and settled about 11 miles from each 
other in the suburbs of New Jersey.

454
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,990
But two days before thanksgiving,
a horrific chain of events would forever

455
00:20:27,991 --> 00:20:29,140
tear them apart.
Oh,

456
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,270
his brother.
Yeah.

457
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,253
That's what it is.
So I'm just getting a really fucked up 

458
00:20:33,091 --> 00:20:35,910
version of the story.
Paul,

459
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,920
how do you say that name?
Kenario.

460
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,340
Kenny.
Kenny.

461
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:40,590
Kenny.
Kenny.

462
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,053
Kenny.
Arrow became brothers killing his 

463
00:20:43,831 --> 00:20:46,680
youngest brother,
his sister in law and their children.

464
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,010
Oh,
this is

465
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:49,720
what's fucked up.
Like what?

466
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,943
What?
How does a guy go from never killing 

467
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:54,274
anybody to killing a wife and daughter?
So he killed his brother and his 

468
00:20:58,631 --> 00:21:01,420
brother's whole family.
Oh my God.

469
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:02,254
I thought he killed his own.
Then he said his own home on fire with 

470
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:05,524
his wife and daughter inside.
Tried to make it look as if the whole 

471
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,720
family have been targeted.
His family got out of the home safely.

472
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:12,023
Can you imagine the panic?
Like what the fuck just murdered these 

473
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:16,670
people.
You don't scroll,

474
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,441
Scroll,
go back,

475
00:21:17,441 --> 00:21:18,274
go back.
You light your own house on fire and 

476
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,670
you're like,
can you imagine like while your lighting

477
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:26,530
your house on fire thinking like the 
intensity of this is gonna work.

478
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,830
I'm going to get out of this,
this,

479
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,150
this is where the plan goes and Poof,
it's really fun.

480
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,250
How does a person kill?

481
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,010
I mean,
I understand you're mad at a guy and you

482
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:37,390
fucking hate each other.
Fuck you.

483
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:39,610
Fuck you.
And you start fighting and then you wind

484
00:21:39,611 --> 00:21:42,850
up killing each other.
How do you kill his wife and daughters?

485
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,890
How do you do that?
What?

486
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,680
What switch goes on?
Like is he just trying to.

487
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:49,980
Yeah,
because he's just walking around.

488
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,030
We'll go back up.
It says it's killed.

489
00:21:52,031 --> 00:21:56,830
His sister in law had said he's accused 
accused of killing his younger brother,

490
00:21:56,831 --> 00:21:59,980
his sister in law and their children.
Like how many children?

491
00:21:59,981 --> 00:22:02,470
Like who he killed kids?
Yes.

492
00:22:02,471 --> 00:22:05,050
So this is a guy who's never murdered 
anybody just walking around.

493
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:06,880
Colts Neck Township,
New Jersey.

494
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,260
Yeah.
He's a businessman.

495
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,280
Probably never done anything really 
major in his life.

496
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,510
Probably like,
was it a,

497
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:14,344
uh,
like a business meeting like two days 

498
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:18,340
before with some guy.
What the fuck man?

499
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,950
Just living his life,
talking about the giants.

500
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,080
Like what the fuck?
What is that?

501
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,890
His wife and his two daughters.
Oh,

502
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,560
several twists in the case of that he 
then allegedly said his own home on fire

503
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,860
with his wife and his daughters inside.
Did you not hear me say that?

504
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,890
I thought you were talking about his,
his brother's family?

505
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:39,550
No.
No.

506
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,790
He killed his brother and his family.
Set the house on fire on fire.

507
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:45,670
Then lit his own house on fire to make 
it look like he was being targeted.

508
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,080
I knew that,
but I didn't know his.

509
00:22:47,081 --> 00:22:50,350
He had kids in his wife and his 
daughters were inside.

510
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,243
Oh my God.
To try to make it look as if his whole 

511
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,670
is being targeted.
His brother and him.

512
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,790
Oh my God.
His family got out of the home safely.

513
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,020
Wow.
Fucking unbelievable.

514
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:03,970
Think about his kids right now.
We're like,

515
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:04,804
what did that?

516
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,260
What?
What?

517
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,350
Jesus Christ he.
Oh my God.

518
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,570
What am I just killed before sunrise?
Scroll up there.

519
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,540
Somewhere between midnight and 5:00
AM,

520
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,853
Paul.
Kenny Arrow was walking around his 

521
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:21,760
brothers.
One point $5,000,000

522
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:22,660
colts,
neck home,

523
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:27,640
armed with a knife,
and a gun has been in front of the white

524
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,250
man's deadly confrontation.
Unfolded.

525
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,743
Paul fired multiple shots.
Striking Keith fucking when you got mad 

526
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:37,180
at me for not following the story 
clearly.

527
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:38,890
Did you feel like you could kill me?
No,

528
00:23:38,891 --> 00:23:41,440
not yet.
I need more.

529
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,100
Need more than Jesus Christ.
He walked inside,

530
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:49,250
found his wife's,
found Keith's wife Jennifer.

531
00:23:49,251 --> 00:23:52,220
He shot and stabbed her and then stabbed
their children.

532
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,290
Jesse.
Eleven and Sophia eight.

533
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,603
What the hell?
Then he took some documents instead of 

534
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:01,610
fire in the basement.
What were they doing?

535
00:24:01,611 --> 00:24:04,490
Like the fucking stabbed an eight year 
old dude,

536
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,443
an eight year old girl in her sleep.
How to how to fuck to someone it would 

537
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,920
say in her sleep.
Well,

538
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:13,820
it was 5:00
AM.

539
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,420
Doesn't matter man.
He's.

540
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,020
There's gunshots in the house.
The kids had gotten up.

541
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,590
Oh my God,
good Lord.

542
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,840
What a monster.
A monster.

543
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,913
What was this guy like the month before?
Like what the hell is that normal 

544
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:29,384
looking house shit.
That is the normalist looking normal 

545
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:32,324
house ever.

546
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,633
Do you believe that there isn't always a
presence of good and evil in the world 

547
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,540
like that.
It's not just evil deeds.

548
00:24:43,541 --> 00:24:44,374
What this guy did was evil,
but do you believe that there is a real 

549
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,213
presence of evil?
That it's like a thing that takes over 

550
00:24:56,471 --> 00:24:58,390
people or takes over.
You know what I mean?

551
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,370
Like,
like,

552
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,180
like,
like good and evil.

553
00:25:01,181 --> 00:25:05,830
Is that more than just people's actions 
or is it like a force of nature?

554
00:25:05,831 --> 00:25:06,664
Is there a good force of nature and an 
evil force of nature that is constantly 

555
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,890
using people and using things as as a 
catalyst or as a

556
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:17,120
okay instrument.
Let's break this down.

557
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:17,983
I don't think nature's the right way to 
approach it because I don't think 

558
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:20,444
there's good or evil in nature.
I think nature nature is actually far 

559
00:25:23,571 --> 00:25:28,340
more moral than humans are because 
nature is just about survival.

560
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,150
Predators and prey and they kill things 
and eat things,

561
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,223
but when animals in nature kill,
like with the called surplus killings 

562
00:25:37,011 --> 00:25:40,400
were wolves will kill like 18 elk and 
not not eat them.

563
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,190
They're just.
They're just going on their instincts.

564
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,430
These things are there to be killed and 
they can get them because they can't run

565
00:25:46,431 --> 00:25:47,264
away.
Maybe it's fixed now or something like 

566
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,430
that,
so they just can't help it.

567
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:54,431
They just tear them apart because their 
instincts are drive them to kill because

568
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,960
that's how they survive.
That's other family survives.

569
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,063
They're killing and eating these elk and
this is just what they do and even if 

570
00:26:01,281 --> 00:26:03,290
they kill a bunch of them where they 
can't eat them,

571
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,900
their instinct is to kill because that's
how they survive.

572
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:10,170
It's natural.
It's normal with humans will.

573
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:13,850
It's very different because with humans 
there's consequences,

574
00:26:13,851 --> 00:26:16,610
right?
And there's law and there's other humans

575
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:19,690
finding out.
So there's deception and then there's,

576
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,823
there's selfishness and there's the fear
of getting caught and then there's your 

577
00:26:25,221 --> 00:26:28,910
own your own survival instincts in terms
of like,

578
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:29,744
you don't want to get locked up in jail.
You don't want to get caught for 

579
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:32,534
something.
So I think if I had a guess that this 

580
00:26:35,481 --> 00:26:36,314
guy didn't think he was going to kill 
this guy's wife and family probably 

581
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:39,950
didn't even think he was going to kill 
this guy.

582
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:42,720
They probably got into a heated argument
and they,

583
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,900
they're stupid and he,
you know,

584
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,110
he's a Guinea.
He's,

585
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,240
that's my people.
They do stupid.

586
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,060
Your people to Ganny era.
They do stupid shit.

587
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:51,661
You know,
they're,

588
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:53,610
they're fiery people.
And those,

589
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,473
those fiery people.
I swore off Italian girls when I was 21 

590
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,130
Italian girl.

591
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,900
Take a swing at me when I was 21,
I was like,

592
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,280
that's it for me.
I'm done.

593
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,553
I'm like,
I'm not hitting one back to fucking 

594
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:10,160
cookie sum some look at some men and 
some women are fucking crazy and I,

595
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,140
I believe in epigenetics and I see our 
wacky.

596
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:15,860
My fucking own kids are.
What's epogen genetics?

597
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,280
Epigenetics.
Willis.

598
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,910
Let's Google it.
So I don't bust up the,

599
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:21,270
uh,
the actual definition,

600
00:27:21,271 --> 00:27:22,104
but essentially it's a bill.
The way I'm using it is that there's 

601
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,890
certain traits that are not just 
environmental traits,

602
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,890
they're inherited traits and that you 
hear it,

603
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,760
we'll pull it up.
Right?

604
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,953
The study,
the changes in organisms caused by the 

605
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,084
modification of gene expression rather 
than the alteration of the genetic code 

606
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:40,434
itself.
This better was better words in that 

607
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,900
there's better a better definition than 
that.

608
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,740
The study of heritable changes in gene 
expression.

609
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:53,160
There you go.
Active versus inactive genes that do not

610
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,740
involve changes to the underlying DNA 
sequence.

611
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,920
A change in the phenotype without a 
change in the Geno type,

612
00:27:58,921 --> 00:28:03,180
which in turn affects how cells read the
jeans a great.

613
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,200
Now I know less about it.

614
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,940
I think there's traits,
and this is,

615
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,310
this is a very,
um,

616
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,450
this is a very controversial yet I'm 
very,

617
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,300
a fascinating field of study because 
what they're doing is they're,

618
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:24,301
they're finding out that children that 
are twins that are separated by,

619
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,940
you know,
when they're babies,

620
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:30,360
they go into different foster homes and 
they're raised by different families,

621
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,510
have incredibly,
remarkably similar characteristics.

622
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:39,540
Lives,
loves and desires,

623
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:44,220
like what they're interested in,
incredibly simple and they're suspecting

624
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,610
that a lot of the,
like you,

625
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,140
we are a combination of nature and 
nurture.

626
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:54,141
I think that's safe to say and I think 
that there you certainly a lot of things

627
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:59,040
happen to kids when they're young that 
shaped their life,

628
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,903
whether it's physical or sexual abuse,
whether it's exposure to violence or 

629
00:29:02,611 --> 00:29:06,990
whether it's positive things like love 
and encouragement and inspiration,

630
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,393
but there's certain information I think 
that's transferred from the parent to 

631
00:29:12,631 --> 00:29:15,670
the child while the child is in the womb
and when,

632
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,730
during,
during the conception of the child.

633
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:20,670
I think there's traits that come from 
the father and traits that come from the

634
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,050
mother.
Biological,

635
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:22,943
biologically.
And I think this is undeniable across 

636
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:27,870
species.
And I think this is why dogs like my dog

637
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:31,680
has no fucking idea who his parents are.
He doesn't give a shit.

638
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,440
He's like,
he's not looking for.

639
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,580
Is that on 23 dot?
Exactly.

640
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,160
I grabbed that leash and he's like,
we run into there and his.

641
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,420
What are you doing,
Jay Movie?

642
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:47,440
Watched it yet?
The three identical strangers.

643
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,560
No,
I haven't,

644
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:51,070
but it's about this exact thing,
right?

645
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,193
Yeah.
Um,

646
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,193
did you watch it?
I've started to like watch the trailers 

647
00:29:54,821 --> 00:29:55,654
and stuff,
but it was a good waiter to come on 

648
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,310
Netflix.
It's on Netflix.

649
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,200
Yeah.
Your dog's not like wonder what my dad's

650
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:04,000
doing now.
Why did he leave me?

651
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,953
Yeah.

652
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,900
Awesome.
Hopes gathering in the woods.

653
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,150
No,
but he's got certain instincts,

654
00:30:10,151 --> 00:30:12,090
like you lifts up his leg to Piss on 
things,

655
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,490
smells things like the end.
And he chases squirrels.

656
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,230
Like there's,
there's things that are in.

657
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,250
He's a retriever,
right?

658
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,230
He's a golden retriever.
So he brings things back.

659
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,160
I mean if I had pit bulls before and 
they'll bring things back,

660
00:30:24,161 --> 00:30:26,630
you got to teach them.
They don't want to bring things back and

661
00:30:26,631 --> 00:30:27,464
they definitely don't want to let go,
but they want to do is play tug of war 

662
00:30:29,351 --> 00:30:30,184
with shit like.
But he lets things go and it's natural 

663
00:30:32,501 --> 00:30:33,610
for him.
That soft mouth.

664
00:30:33,611 --> 00:30:35,530
Yes.
I have a black lab.

665
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,463
Does the same thing.
They hold things gently because they're 

666
00:30:38,111 --> 00:30:41,620
used to retrieving ducks and animal and 
pheasants that people shoot.

667
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:43,030
That's what they were raised for.
Yeah.

668
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,250
So he brings things back.
Like when I get him up in the morning,

669
00:30:45,251 --> 00:30:46,084
right?
He stays in this little room and when I 

670
00:30:48,491 --> 00:30:51,700
get up in the morning at seven to take 
my kids to school and all that stuff,

671
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,760
when I open up the door he whines like 
crazy.

672
00:30:54,761 --> 00:30:56,140
He gets crazy,
wags his tail.

673
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,710
So.
But the first thing he does is pick up a

674
00:30:59,711 --> 00:31:00,544
toy.
He picks up stuff to him when it comes 

675
00:31:02,171 --> 00:31:03,910
to me with a stuffed animal in his 
mouth.

676
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:04,870
Like this

677
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,650
is not something that we taught him,
but this is something.

678
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,980
And Golden retrievers all around the 
world doing the same exact thing.

679
00:31:10,981 --> 00:31:11,950
Yep.
All around the world.

680
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,500
All around the same exact thing.
There's certain traits.

681
00:31:14,501 --> 00:31:15,334
Yeah,

682
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:18,750
and I believe that Italians,
my,

683
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,660
my people,
my people.

684
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,070
I'm not saying this about.
Yeah.

685
00:31:22,071 --> 00:31:23,660
And Yours too.
I'm mostly Italian.

686
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,590
They're savage folk.
This is just a fact,

687
00:31:27,591 --> 00:31:28,760
man.
Just a fact.

688
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,020
There's,
there's a streak,

689
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,090
a streak.
It goes back to the Romans.

690
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,830
That's what I really,
absolutely 100 percent believe that.

691
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,723
Um,
I think there are certain civilizations 

692
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,640
that have a longer history of being 
civilized and,

693
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,270
and less violence.
And I think when you are,

694
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,273
were you dealing with folks that have in
a real history of violence in their 

695
00:31:51,531 --> 00:31:52,364
culture and that this translates 
generation to generation and transfers 

696
00:31:56,871 --> 00:32:00,860
down to the children.
And I think this guy is part of that.

697
00:32:00,861 --> 00:32:01,694
I mean it's like there's not,
it's not a coincidence that the Italian 

698
00:32:04,551 --> 00:32:06,080
mob,
so ruthlessly brutal.

699
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,800
What did the Russian mob.
So yeah,

700
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,230
sleep brutal.
Excuse me,

701
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,050
know for sure.
There's definitely that part of it.

702
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,370
And then there's the other part of it 
that,

703
00:32:13,371 --> 00:32:14,660
like you said,
there's a,

704
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:16,123
there's the nurture part of it.
Who knows what was going on in this 

705
00:32:19,551 --> 00:32:21,220
guy's life that you know.
Okay,

706
00:32:21,221 --> 00:32:24,410
so here we have two Italian brothers,
right?

707
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,790
Yeah.
Raised the same way.

708
00:32:25,791 --> 00:32:27,840
Italian hot streak.
All those things together.

709
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,670
One brother decided to burn the house 
down and slow to the family.

710
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,673
The other,
an Italian guy didn't have that in his 

711
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:35,020
to do list,

712
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,470
but not necessarily because I don't know
if they planned it out or if he did just

713
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:40,270
because.

714
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,260
I mean he had a knife on him and a gun.
Maybe there's one of those crazy asshole

715
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,660
that brought a knife and a gun 
everywhere.

716
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,883
Who the fuck knows?
But they were in business together and 

717
00:32:48,741 --> 00:32:49,574
you know,
people in business together and it's 

718
00:32:50,231 --> 00:32:51,064
not.
They get crazy and they get real 

719
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:52,724
resentful and you know,
they think one person's not doing their 

720
00:32:54,951 --> 00:32:58,130
fair share.
One person fucks up a deal or one person

721
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,800
costing them money.
And now who knows?

722
00:33:00,801 --> 00:33:03,790
But how the fuck did he kill each other?
So there's no.

723
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,633
I have a baby man.
How do you stab an eight year old 

724
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:06,711
daughter?
Well,

725
00:33:06,711 --> 00:33:08,590
you take it in your hand.
Yeah,

726
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:11,230
I have no idea.
But the Italians also like wine,

727
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,123
more wine,
please soon as drunk give you one of 

728
00:33:15,691 --> 00:33:19,920
these zero percent alcohol Heineken's.
He's supposed to be the most delicious.

729
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,780
I've never had it.
And we'll try one of these.

730
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:25,000
I supposed to be the most delicious,
nonalcoholic beer.

731
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,980
Not recommended.
They said that if you want to try,

732
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,140
I'll try nonalcoholic beer.
That doesn't suck.

733
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,020
Get this a Heineken zero.
Zero.

734
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,540
So Heineken's zero.
Zero.

735
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,620
It's supposed to be the shit.

736
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,173
Hmm.

737
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:46,370
Tastes like Heineken does.
There's literally no difference.

738
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,260
Pretty damn good for nonalcoholic beer.
Doesn't have that weird.

739
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:51,980
I'm lying to myself.
Funk to it.

740
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,913
Yeah.
It doesn't have that a weird after 

741
00:33:55,091 --> 00:33:56,740
taste.
If I was a junkie,

742
00:33:57,650 --> 00:34:01,600
I would not want to try great opiate.
Free heroin.

743
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,670
It tastes just like.
It just seems like it'd be a smart move,

744
00:34:08,791 --> 00:34:12,060
but alcoholics will drink nonalcoholic 
beer.

745
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,780
Walk into a liquor store by this non 
alcoholic guy.

746
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:19,500
But you literally at the gate of Hell 
and the,

747
00:34:19,501 --> 00:34:20,334
the,
the fucking demons are reached and 

748
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:24,261
you're like,
no,

749
00:34:24,261 --> 00:34:24,601
no,
no,

750
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:25,434
no.
Thank you.

751
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:31,140
Zero zero.
Let me just test myself or clean or cool

752
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:34,770
with taking cbd.
Like is that a good question?

753
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,870
Well,
the marijuana thing is different because

754
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,240
I think for the vast majority of human 
beings,

755
00:34:39,241 --> 00:34:41,100
obviously there's a lot of biological 
diversity,

756
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:44,040
but for the vast majority of human 
beings,

757
00:34:44,041 --> 00:34:46,500
I do not think that marijuana is 
physically addictive.

758
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,500
I think it's entirely possible that for 
some people it is,

759
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,790
but I think for the vast majority of 
people it is not physically addictive.

760
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:56,580
It's more psychologically addictive.
So I think it's a different thing.

761
00:34:56,581 --> 00:34:58,830
So if they're taking cbd,
what they're.

762
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:01,910
I mean it depends on how they're taking.
If they're rolling up a CBD joint,

763
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,970
CBD,
which is a little extra,

764
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,843
do they do that for sure,
but doesn't some cbd have a little bit 

765
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:13,110
of thc to go with that?
Some of it.

766
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,393
Well,
this shed has the tiniest amount of 

767
00:35:16,261 --> 00:35:18,480
alcohol,
his alcohol free,

768
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,420
but I think it's like what are the 
calories?

769
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,670
Zero,
zero point zero,

770
00:35:23,671 --> 00:35:27,720
four alcohol free beer with natural 
flavoring.

771
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,583
Do you know a Heineken's one of the few 
beers that you can drink if you are a 

772
00:35:31,441 --> 00:35:33,360
celiac?
It does not.

773
00:35:33,361 --> 00:35:35,730
Have wheat,
it's not a wheat based beer,

774
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,270
so if you're gluten you can drink 
heineken,

775
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,040
eh,
maybe not if you're Celiac,

776
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,250
but definitely if you're gluten free,
that's not bad.

777
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,510
Yeah,
I like it.

778
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,490
That's not bad at all.
It's not bad,

779
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,730
but calories of standard.
Half the calories of a standard beer.

780
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,940
So those other calories,
just pure alcohol I guess.

781
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,440
Yeah,
right.

782
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,720
I wonder if there's like a,
you know,

783
00:35:57,721 --> 00:36:01,470
um,
there's one episode of the Opiod,

784
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:05,010
Anthony Show.
I remember this.

785
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,170
Oh my God,
I forgot about this.

786
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:11,280
We gave this gal who she had this.
Uh,

787
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,440
I think it was her name was stocker 
patty.

788
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,720
I think that was.
I remember we gave this crazy.

789
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,090
You know how radio shows have these 
regulars that always come to the studio?

790
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,033
Yeah,
yeah.

791
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:25,110
Well they gave this one gal,
I'm a breath strip,

792
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,140
like a standard listerine breast trip 
and this was back in the day when I used

793
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:36,381
to get pot breath strips that would,
they would fuck you up so hard.

794
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,183
I remember I gave a half a one to 
Thompson girl and we flew to Florida do 

795
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:42,870
gigs together and by the time we landed 
it's like,

796
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:43,704
dude,
I want to tell you something I almost 

797
00:36:44,671 --> 00:36:45,180
didn't make.

798
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,510
It was almost telling these people to 
turn this flight around.

799
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,040
Started freaking out half of a breast 
job.

800
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,740
We'll put you in an alternative 
dimension.

801
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:56,603
It was so strong,
so we gave this gal a regular breast 

802
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,160
trip.
There's a video of it online.

803
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,210
It's like an hour long.
They don't vet had no.

804
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,783
I had no wheat and no red.
Gave her this breath strip and then he 

805
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,360
proceeded to like to talk to her and she
was talking about hi.

806
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:19,110
She was and she's so funny.
She couldn't go anywhere,

807
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:23,040
but we all knew that she was sober.
She was.

808
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,870
When you're a person who's like a whack 
pack or from this high,

809
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,840
there's something is an issue that's not
being resolved.

810
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:31,723
Yes.
That makes it hard to listen to frankly 

811
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:38,040
is not a widow and actualized human 
being.

812
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,240
That would be the table.
This is not an actualized human being.

813
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,760
Someone who's got their shit together 
though,

814
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,673
they're reading self help books and 
fucking getting up at five and doing 

815
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:46,820
yoga.
No,

816
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,510
no,
no.

817
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,250
It just trying to get through the day.
They're barely getting through.

818
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,550
I found this thing that makes them.
That they cling to.

819
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:57,390
Yeah.
Those characteristics are fascinating to

820
00:37:57,391 --> 00:37:59,700
me because you see,
you find them in other things.

821
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:00,873
Would you be those characteristics of 
these people that find something to 

822
00:38:04,201 --> 00:38:07,620
belong to and then they become a thing.
They become a part of that thing.

823
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,530
You would find those people at pool 
halls.

824
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,900
You'll find those people at martial arts
places.

825
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:14,880
You find those people that hang out at 
comedy clubs.

826
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:18,660
It's like they're a little off,
but they find a thing.

827
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,523
Yeah.
That becomes the thing that they do all 

828
00:38:21,571 --> 00:38:23,760
the time.
Even if they're not like the comedian,

829
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:27,870
they'll hang out at the comedy so we 
know those folks for sure,

830
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,460
and I don't.
I totally get it.

831
00:38:29,461 --> 00:38:30,570
I mean,
that's community.

832
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:32,220
Yes,
like just wanting to belong somewhere.

833
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:33,054
We all want that thing.
Just that's where I go and I know those 

834
00:38:35,711 --> 00:38:36,160
faces

835
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,560
and they know me and maybe I'm not 
totally a part of it,

836
00:38:38,561 --> 00:38:42,800
but I can go to the pool hall and yes,
feel like I went,

837
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:43,870
I was wanted

838
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:44,923
close.
The pool hall was a perfect place for 

839
00:38:46,181 --> 00:38:50,800
that because it was a hangout like a lot
of people weren't playing,

840
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,800
so if you had like three or four tables 
going there,

841
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,930
so three or four tables would be like a 
six or eight people playing pool,

842
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,050
but there might also be five or six 
people just hanging out.

843
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:02,884
Maybe playing cards,
maybe be just buying coffee and maybe 

844
00:39:05,861 --> 00:39:08,200
ordering a sandwich or something like 
that and just sitting there eating.

845
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:11,570
It's important.
I was reading a whole article about that

846
00:39:11,571 --> 00:39:12,404
by David Brooks the other day and he was
saying that that's economically we're 

847
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:21,260
richer than we've ever been as a country
and even in the last couple of years,

848
00:39:21,261 --> 00:39:22,094
like poor people,
like everyone's standard of living has 

849
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:27,530
gone up.
Which I wasn't really clear on.

850
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,810
I thought that only the rich people were
doing.

851
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,673
We're were getting Richard,
but everybody was kind of being lifted 

852
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:36,650
up,
but we're unhappier than ever before and

853
00:39:36,651 --> 00:39:37,484
the life expectancy is lower than ever 
before and we're killing ourselves at 

854
00:39:39,921 --> 00:39:44,450
rates that are higher than ever before,
and he was saying that it's that lack of

855
00:39:44,451 --> 00:39:47,960
community that we don't go to church 
anymore.

856
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,990
We don't belong to those things that 
gave us meaning everyday in our town and

857
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,350
used to go to church and you'd go to the
pool hall.

858
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,203
You go to that,
you need that sense of belonging and 

859
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,313
work is a big part of it and people now 
are in this gig economy and they're 

860
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,830
working uber,
they're working seamless,

861
00:40:06,831 --> 00:40:08,420
they're doing different things.
They're isolated,

862
00:40:08,421 --> 00:40:11,510
they're by themselves and I'm working 
with other people and it's.

863
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:12,344
He really believes that it's that lack 
of community and that lack of 

864
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:19,220
institutions is why we're very,
very unhappy as a,

865
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,330
as a country right now.

866
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,600
It makes sense to me.
It makes sense to me as a person who's a

867
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:27,230
part of a vital community.
As a comedian.

868
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,463
I was talking to Jeff Ross was here the 
other day with Dave attell and one of 

869
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:32,000
the things that he said that really 
struck with me,

870
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,133
he said,
I almost feel like I'm a comedian more 

871
00:40:34,491 --> 00:40:37,190
than I'm an American.
Am I going to comedian first?

872
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,320
American second?
I was like,

873
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,700
yeah,
you,

874
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:41,673
if you were at the airport and you know,
you run into Dave attell or whoever it 

875
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:46,370
is,
like,

876
00:40:46,371 --> 00:40:50,720
it's like there's a light upon them.
It comes down from heaven.

877
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,360
Exactly.
Hey,

878
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,020
just embrace them.
That's why I always,

879
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,350
I would always get suspicious of comics 
who didn't embrace me.

880
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,150
Like as soon as you home,
like I was like,

881
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,140
there's something weird with it.

882
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:03,913
Yeah.
Something like horror comics that don't 

883
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,700
have any comic friends.
Yeah.

884
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:08,613
It's very weird.
Fucking real strange and they're always 

885
00:41:10,371 --> 00:41:11,500
super selfish.

886
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,191
Okay.
It's,

887
00:41:12,191 --> 00:41:13,024
yeah.
I can't even figure out exactly what it 

888
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:15,604
is,
but I'm just like,

889
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,080
I know that's not one of the good ones.

890
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:18,043
Yeah.
Especially if someone's like a 

891
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,434
successful comedian that's really weird.
Like you have the opportunity to hang 

892
00:41:21,931 --> 00:41:23,720
out with some of the most fun people in 
the world.

893
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,700
You're a peer of theirs and you give 
them a pass.

894
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:27,960
It's like family.
It's like,

895
00:41:27,961 --> 00:41:28,620
no.
Oh,

896
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:29,453
I did this gig in,
in Colorado once and just by chance it 

897
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:34,184
was like this corporate thing.
And there was another comic on the bill 

898
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,430
who I won't mention.
And I was like,

899
00:41:37,431 --> 00:41:38,001
oh,
that's cool.

900
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:38,834
We're in the middle of like nowhere.
And at least there's another comedian 

901
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:44,060
here.
He did his set split.

902
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,910
Didn't talk to me just like there was 
no.

903
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,410
I was like,
I was like,

904
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,460
your dog,
like,

905
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,151
Hey,
let's play.

906
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:53,350
Let's just split.
I was like,

907
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:55,150
all right,
that guy's weird that guys,

908
00:41:55,151 --> 00:41:57,470
there's something and I am.
It's true.

909
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,310
It's common now than it was back in the 
day.

910
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,510
And this was another thing that I talked
about with the,

911
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,410
with jeff and Dave as we were talking 
about comradery,

912
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,040
that there's,
um,

913
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,330
there's less competition now than there 
ever was before.

914
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:14,660
Because before there was only a limited 
number of tonight's show slots.

915
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,810
There was a limited number of sitcoms it
could be on.

916
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:20,750
And that's what everybody wanted.
Everybody wanted their own Sitcom.

917
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,520
Everybody wants to be on the tonight 
show.

918
00:42:22,521 --> 00:42:23,354
And there are very few of those very few
and everybody was competing for these 

919
00:42:26,061 --> 00:42:29,530
very limited slots and there's very few 
hbo specials there was,

920
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:30,413
was not,
there wasn't a lot and there was a lot 

921
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,120
of us and so it led to a lot of like 
jealousy,

922
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:39,650
a lot of clawing and scratching.
You can see thanks to many things.

923
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,484
Thanks to the Internet,
thanks to youtube initially then 

924
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:46,580
podcasts and then Netflix.
It seems like the world is our oyster.

925
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:49,520
There's so much you have to do is put 
out good content.

926
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:51,760
Totally.
And you could have your own audience and

927
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,633
he could have his own audience.
She could have hers and all exist 

928
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:58,680
without having to poach each other's 
audiences.

929
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,543
Yeah.
And

930
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,550
Leno.
I promote.

931
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:03,760
Look in the beginning of.
If you're listening to this on youtube,

932
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:04,594
it's not on it because it's something 
that I do in the beginning of the audio 

933
00:43:06,911 --> 00:43:07,750
version of it,
but I.

934
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,593
I'm always talking about people's 
specials that are out like the now the 

935
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,210
bumping mic special.
Would Dave and Jeff Ross is out now.

936
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,193
They're not paying me to say that 
Netflix is not the me to say that the 

937
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,430
special with the Christina [inaudible] 
special,

938
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,030
they're not paying me to say that I'm 
saying that because these people are all

939
00:43:25,031 --> 00:43:28,630
my friends and I want them to prosper 
when everybody knew I want them to.

940
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:29,613
I think they're great and I want 
everybody to know that this is great 

941
00:43:31,751 --> 00:43:33,820
stuff and if you.
If you're a fan of comedy,

942
00:43:33,821 --> 00:43:34,654
I want to help you find.
It's like I want to be that guy in the 

943
00:43:36,461 --> 00:43:37,450
wine store going,
hey,

944
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,140
you want to see an $18 bottle of wine?
They'll knock your digging in the dirt.

945
00:43:41,141 --> 00:43:41,974
It's Joey.

946
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:48,110
Nobody knows about,
but you're going to love it.

947
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:48,973
Well,
more people know about joey now than 

948
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:51,820
ever before.
Enough.

949
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:52,880
Not Enough.
Yeah.

950
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,650
No,
I know he's the best ever.

951
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:55,753
I've never.
I've never seen anybody that makes me 

952
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:57,980
laugh harder.
I don't know if I.

953
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:59,383
If I enjoy him as much as I want,
as much as I enjoy how much you enjoy 

954
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:07,580
him,
it really is such a great thing.

955
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,300
Just watching you guys when he's going 
off and you're laughing at him,

956
00:44:11,301 --> 00:44:13,700
it's just,
it's like I could watch that all day.

957
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,050
I feel so thankful.
He's so real.

958
00:44:18,051 --> 00:44:19,220
He's such A.
I mean,

959
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:20,054
he's just one of those.

960
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:22,680
So real.
Especially if I have a buzz.

961
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:25,500
I got about a couple of drinks.
Smoke a little weed.

962
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:27,420
Now Watch Joey.
I'm so thankful.

963
00:44:27,421 --> 00:44:29,670
I'm so thankful.
There's a guy like that out there.

964
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,833
In my opinion,
he's leader of the charge because he's 

965
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:37,650
the most reckless and wild and and even 
more so now.

966
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,180
Now that he did that,
Netflix special,

967
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:40,350
all my God.
Go,

968
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,640
go see him.
People.

969
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:45,330
He is a fucking monster right now.
He's like,

970
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:46,463
he's peaking.
He's better than he was before and he 

971
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:48,930
was the best before.

972
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:50,880
No,
it's such a great thing.

973
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:51,714
Like when you go to any club and then 
you come in and you just see whatever 

974
00:44:55,051 --> 00:44:56,670
random people are there.
You know,

975
00:44:56,671 --> 00:44:57,504
my wife was a comedian before we had 
kids and the first thing she wants to 

976
00:45:01,801 --> 00:45:03,400
ask,
she asked when I come back as who?

977
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:05,220
Who was there?
Who did you say?

978
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:06,241
And it's like,
oh,

979
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:07,920
he's so Steve Byrne,
I saw the whatever,

980
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:08,520
and she's like,
oh,

981
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,290
she wants,
because she doesn't,

982
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,030
she's not part of the community like she
is,

983
00:45:12,031 --> 00:45:12,864
but she doesn't get the visit.
So it's like she misses that sense and 

984
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,383
we're very lucky to have that as grown 
men to be able to like walk into this 

985
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:22,710
very fun community that you're a part 
of.

986
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,791
It gives you,
meaning,

987
00:45:23,791 --> 00:45:26,250
it gives you a sense of,
of belonging.

988
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,890
And that's what a lot of people don't 
have nowadays.

989
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:30,200
It's very,
uh,

990
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,913
according to David Brooks,
that's the reason for everybody's 

991
00:45:33,331 --> 00:45:34,680
malaise,
I think.

992
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:35,863
Let me something too though.
I think it's weird living in places 

993
00:45:38,601 --> 00:45:41,810
where you don't know your neighbors.
That's fucking weird.

994
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:42,650
I mean,
yeah,

995
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:43,693
Norton was telling me that he lives in 
this big apartment building in New York 

996
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:49,250
City and I think he,
I mean,

997
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,330
it's got to be hundreds of people living
in that building,

998
00:45:51,470 --> 00:45:52,790
these huge,
huge building.

999
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,624
Yeah,
no worries.

1000
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:55,240
No anybody.
We're here.

1001
00:45:55,241 --> 00:45:56,360
It says no,
it doesn't know anybody.

1002
00:45:56,361 --> 00:45:57,620
He says he tried to say hi to his 
neighbor.

1003
00:45:57,621 --> 00:45:59,150
They looked at him like he's a fucking 
murderer.

1004
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,320
Nobody's friendly to anybody.
So weird.

1005
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:05,930
They're like,
you're too loud.

1006
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,330
Stop making noise.
That's what everybody does to people.

1007
00:46:08,331 --> 00:46:10,070
Bang on the door,
banging on the floor,

1008
00:46:10,071 --> 00:46:11,300
banging in the room.
Conflict.

1009
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:14,090
Yeah.
It's a weird thing and it's weird,

1010
00:46:14,091 --> 00:46:15,760
you know,
my,

1011
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,400
my youngest wants to go to church and 
how old?

1012
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:24,130
13.
And because friends what does,

1013
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:29,090
maybe she has more of a,
she's more of a sensitivity and like she

1014
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,730
knows there's something other than 
there's something spiritual going on.

1015
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,593
Mushrooms,
I think that might've been what kicked 

1016
00:46:35,801 --> 00:46:38,760
the whole thing on.
And uh,

1017
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,273
and she's just,
she's searching a little bit and she 

1018
00:46:42,471 --> 00:46:44,990
wants that.
She likes being able to sit someplace in

1019
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,730
a and we go and it's not like when I was
a kid,

1020
00:46:49,731 --> 00:46:52,220
like when I was a kid and we were 
Catholic,

1021
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,860
the place was packed.
Like you couldn't find parking.

1022
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,770
It's like,
it was like,

1023
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,860
it was a big deal that my father would 
be like,

1024
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,420
we're going early,
come on,

1025
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:01,640
get out of the house.
We got to get a spot.

1026
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,440
I'm not walking from the back.

1027
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,230
And it was like a big thing.
Now it's like you kind of roll up,

1028
00:47:06,231 --> 00:47:09,620
it's half full and there's nobody there 
and it's,

1029
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:10,454
you know,
of course the Catholic Church has a lot 

1030
00:47:12,141 --> 00:47:15,320
of problems and.
But every but every.

1031
00:47:15,321 --> 00:47:16,154
What do you mean by problem?
But all these religions have had a 

1032
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:19,790
little,
a little kerfuffle.

1033
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,380
Have a lot like the Catholic church.
No,

1034
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,460
the Catholic church is the worst.
It's the worst.

1035
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,170
But the.
I know,

1036
00:47:27,171 --> 00:47:28,820
but don't let me get sides.
But the,

1037
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:30,283
the thing is we know so much now and 
we're able to see that all these 

1038
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:36,160
institutions are flawed,
that there's problems with all of them.

1039
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:37,570
We used to be,
people used to think,

1040
00:47:37,571 --> 00:47:40,710
my grandmother just thought churches the
best and this is the best one.

1041
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,563
They didn't ask questions.
Now we know everything and we know that 

1042
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:45,064
all these institutions are flawed.
And I think we're making the mistake 

1043
00:47:48,071 --> 00:47:50,590
that you can't be a part of a political 
party.

1044
00:47:50,591 --> 00:47:53,620
You can't be a part of a community.
You can't be a part of the thing if it's

1045
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,050
not perfect,
but that's not a way to live.

1046
00:47:56,051 --> 00:47:59,290
You gotta kind of be a little ignorant 
if you're going to show up,

1047
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,370
you got to kind of not be ignorant,
but allow things to be flood

1048
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,530
or start a new one,
go on.

1049
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:07,783
I mean the the right way to address the 
issues of a flawed institution and not 

1050
00:48:13,161 --> 00:48:13,994
just accept them,
but to try to create a new institution 

1051
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:18,350
that doesn't have as many flaws.
I mean that's what we.

1052
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:21,290
That's not what we did,
but our founding fathers did.

1053
00:48:21,291 --> 00:48:23,540
When they established the United States 
of America,

1054
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:24,403
the idea was to establish a place where 
you have an experiment in self 

1055
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:32,870
government and that's never existed 
before in the world and this is what the

1056
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:35,330
United States represents to the rest of 
the world outside of us.

1057
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,300
I mean this is what we,
again,

1058
00:48:38,301 --> 00:48:39,740
I keep saying we,
it's not we,

1059
00:48:39,741 --> 00:48:40,574
but with the people that established the
United States did was they broke the 

1060
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:49,421
mold as to how a world superpower or a 
country.

1061
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,473
It wasn't a super power that exists,
but how a country could exist and then 

1062
00:48:52,611 --> 00:48:53,444
that country.

1063
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:54,403
I mean,
I don't think it's a coincidence that 

1064
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,333
Adam just a couple hundred years that 
country emerged the greatest superpower 

1065
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,333
of the world's ever known.
I think that freedom allows 

1066
00:49:02,031 --> 00:49:05,510
unprecedented activity in terms of 
innovation,

1067
00:49:05,511 --> 00:49:06,344
in terms of creativity and not being 
suppressed and not being in total fear 

1068
00:49:10,101 --> 00:49:12,530
for your life,
for any form of descent.

1069
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,870
So any,
and this is.

1070
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,900
This goes back to not just religion but 
any sort of any group,

1071
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,681
any,
any,

1072
00:49:21,681 --> 00:49:25,760
any group that's in control of any sort 
of a situation.

1073
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,550
As soon as you suppress all the other 
people,

1074
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:29,923
you limit their ability to contribute 
and this is what is existed all 

1075
00:49:34,851 --> 00:49:37,610
throughout Europe and would existed all 
throughout Asia,

1076
00:49:37,611 --> 00:49:39,320
all throughout the rest of the world.
Yeah.

1077
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,620
When the United States came along and 
then when the United States came along,

1078
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:46,670
all the sudden you have this 
unprecedented development and growth and

1079
00:49:46,671 --> 00:49:48,770
this one place where people are allowed 
to be free.

1080
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,933
Where we support free expression.
We we support free religious freedom of 

1081
00:49:55,161 --> 00:49:59,270
religion and we separate church and 
state and this is one of the reasons why

1082
00:49:59,271 --> 00:50:00,104
these things are so important.
So when you get like religious 

1083
00:50:01,611 --> 00:50:05,150
fundamentalists Wackos that say this 
country was founded on Christian values,

1084
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:06,703
that doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter if you're a peaceful 

1085
00:50:08,661 --> 00:50:11,240
Muslim,
if you're a peaceful Buddhist,

1086
00:50:11,241 --> 00:50:14,000
if you're a peaceful mormon,
whatever the fuck it is,

1087
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:14,983
we should all embrace each other.
We should allow each other 100 percent 

1088
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:18,464
freedom.
And as soon as someone starts 

1089
00:50:19,071 --> 00:50:22,970
restricting that freedom and restricting
people's ability to express themselves,

1090
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,013
you run into real problems because then 
you don't let these things play out in 

1091
00:50:26,931 --> 00:50:27,764
their order.
You don't let ideas play out where 

1092
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:32,690
people get to examine those ideas and 
change.

1093
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:33,703
Like look,
if you look at some of the more 

1094
00:50:34,581 --> 00:50:35,414
suppressive areas of the Middle East,
the real problem is that these people 

1095
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:39,743
live not just as many real problems,
but one of the real problems is these 

1096
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:42,734
people live in fear.
So there's no real freedom of 

1097
00:50:44,511 --> 00:50:45,344
expression.
And there's also this real desire for 

1098
00:50:48,831 --> 00:50:53,690
conformity is real desire to establish 
that you are a part of the group that is

1099
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:54,943
one of the good ones that's going to 
abide by the rules and you are going to 

1100
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:01,340
show everyone else that you were a part 
of this group,

1101
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,353
whether it means throwing gay people off
buildings or throwing rocks at women's 

1102
00:51:06,050 --> 00:51:07,220
shelters,
all that stuff.

1103
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:10,190
I was just gonna say like your life 
actually depends on you conforming.

1104
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:12,530
Yes.
I was with my friend the other day who's

1105
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,520
gay and he was saying that he just 
stopped the chest one.

1106
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,440
Just come on,
come on,

1107
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:21,320
shout it out.
And it really,

1108
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,900
how close is close?
Comes over your house.

1109
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,490
So close.
Whoa.

1110
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,490
I didn't realize he can't go to half of 
the planet as an open gay man.

1111
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,170
Oh yeah.
He can't go to Russia.

1112
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:36,740
He can't go to all of the Middle East.
There's parts of age like they will kill

1113
00:51:36,741 --> 00:51:38,960
you if you're gay in those areas.
Yeah,

1114
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:41,180
I mean talk about.
I mean,

1115
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:42,853
what's going to make a city flourish 
then gay people coming in with bold 

1116
00:51:47,601 --> 00:51:49,390
ideas and let's go.
I mean,

1117
00:51:49,391 --> 00:51:52,310
I saw them change parts of New York like
it was nobody's business.

1118
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,260
Well,
and also I think that like the,

1119
00:51:54,270 --> 00:51:57,380
the.
What's great about gay folks is when gay

1120
00:51:57,381 --> 00:51:59,810
folks are embraced and they're allowed 
to be themselves,

1121
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:01,490
oh my God,
I can express that,

1122
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,010
and then you get to see that,
like there's a.

1123
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,093
there's such a giant spectrum of the way
people behave and think and the things 

1124
00:52:08,541 --> 00:52:11,630
that they love,
and if you don't allow people to express

1125
00:52:11,631 --> 00:52:14,660
their position on that spectrum,
then you don't even know it exists.

1126
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,003
Then you create all sorts of deviance 
because you're forcing them into some 

1127
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,473
unnatural pattern,
which is one of the things that I think 

1128
00:52:22,311 --> 00:52:23,144
about the Catholic church.
I think part of the problem is that 

1129
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:29,030
these people are suppressed sexually,
like incredibly suppressed,

1130
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,893
not just suppressed in terms of their,
whether they're homosexual or 

1131
00:52:32,451 --> 00:52:34,430
heterosexual,
but there's no sex.

1132
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:35,910
You're not allowed to have any sex,
right?

1133
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:38,400
Yeah.
So how's it going to come out?

1134
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,430
It's fucking insane.
It's insane

1135
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,060
denial of the fact that you need to 
drink water

1136
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:48,150
and it's so upsetting because I'm really
kind of searching a little bit because I

1137
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:52,310
was raised Catholic and I did like going
to have what she has.

1138
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:53,144
I did like going and sitting in the Pew 
on Sunday was different from the other 

1139
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,093
days and I asked,
I got to hear people talk about being 

1140
00:52:59,991 --> 00:53:00,824
nice to each other and I got to see the 
people from my town who you saw running 

1141
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,274
around,
but now they're just sitting there 

1142
00:53:04,551 --> 00:53:05,384
quietly and praying.
There was goodness to it and they went 

1143
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:09,704
out and fed the homeless.
There was good stuff that came from it 

1144
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,000
and she wants that.
I get that.

1145
00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:16,410
And now you're sitting in an institution
though the,

1146
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:18,860
you know,
the backstory of what's going on.

1147
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,590
It's,
you know,

1148
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,160
how do you sit there?
How do you sit there said

1149
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,840
to her last night,
maybe we should just go to yoga,

1150
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:34,470
satisfy your spiritual side with wacky 
to men.

1151
00:53:34,490 --> 00:53:35,550
I know.
Look,

1152
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:39,090
I go to a Bikram Yoga,
I go to hot yoga,

1153
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,430
hot yoga,
and that guy,

1154
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:43,590
I don't think he's allowed to come in 
this country.

1155
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:44,863
No,
he's not.

1156
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:49,970
The guy who made big room now know that 
guy not think he's best case.

1157
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,050
He.
He got a little rapey.

1158
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,280
Well,
he definitely got a little.

1159
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:01,370
He took advantage of his privilege,
his position,

1160
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:02,640
our.
Well,

1161
00:54:03,230 --> 00:54:04,860
yeah,
I guess you could say power,

1162
00:54:04,861 --> 00:54:07,170
but the reverence that people had 
towards him,

1163
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,430
they felt like he was a guru and so he 
would get these girls alone and he would

1164
00:54:11,431 --> 00:54:15,470
make them suck tank or whatever,
but I think per seat,

1165
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,930
now this,
I'm getting this very dangerous waters,

1166
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:23,850
but I was having a conversation with a 
woman who is a.

1167
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,790
she's actually an instructor and she 
said,

1168
00:54:26,791 --> 00:54:29,460
listen,
that guy is definitely creepy,

1169
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:30,623
but let me tell you something.
A lot of those girls not only knew what 

1170
00:54:34,861 --> 00:54:37,230
he was about,
but they wanted to be with him.

1171
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:38,483
They want him to be with him because of 
his power and because he represented 

1172
00:54:41,221 --> 00:54:42,054
something special to them and then when 
he just shot a load in their mouth and 

1173
00:54:45,901 --> 00:54:46,734
kicked him to the curb,
then they became angry and decided they 

1174
00:54:49,051 --> 00:54:49,884
were molested.

1175
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,053
They went into it willingly.
I do not know if she's accurate or 

1176
00:54:53,521 --> 00:54:56,130
inaccurate.
I was not there and I'm not a woman,

1177
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,400
but I do know that people have like a.
I remember women throwing,

1178
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:07,620
throwing themselves,
but making it very clear that they were.

1179
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:12,030
They had deep admiration for my martial 
arts instructor when I was,

1180
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:15,120
when I was a young kid and I was a 
practicing taekwondo.

1181
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,313
I remember these women.
They were so in awe of my martial arts 

1182
00:55:19,501 --> 00:55:20,334
instructor because he represented a 
master of something that they were 

1183
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:24,773
deeply enamored by it and I think that's
also what happens with these yoga 

1184
00:55:28,021 --> 00:55:28,510
people.

1185
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,070
Yeah,
it's seductive.

1186
00:55:31,090 --> 00:55:34,930
It's seductive,
and also with something like that,

1187
00:55:34,931 --> 00:55:37,330
it's very physical and mental and 
spiritual.

1188
00:55:37,331 --> 00:55:40,330
It's sexual,
sexual like it is.

1189
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:41,250
Look,
I don't.

1190
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,660
I've never had any sex with anybody in 
my class,

1191
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,170
but I'm telling you when everybody's in 
there sweating and,

1192
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,023
and almost naked,
I'm wearing these little fucking shorts 

1193
00:55:50,531 --> 00:55:52,110
and the girls were wearing these little 
shorts and,

1194
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,820
and the teacher goes around and she like
calls you out.

1195
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:55,421
It's like,
oh,

1196
00:55:55,421 --> 00:55:56,430
she likes me.
Yes,

1197
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:57,420
I can undo

1198
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:58,253
Stan.
How some of those people get intimate 

1199
00:56:00,151 --> 00:56:02,230
with each other after this is all over 
because they're,

1200
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,200
they're so close to being naked

1201
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:07,250
wedding together and your friend is 
right.

1202
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,420
Uh,
in that,

1203
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,570
there were some women I'm sure who 
wanted to be with him,

1204
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,720
but he's not dismissing any rap shit 
either,

1205
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:15,583
but it's his responsibility because he 
has the power and knows what he's 

1206
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:20,240
wielding like in a workplace kind of 
thing.

1207
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:23,000
It's up to you to be the one who puts 
the brakes on it.

1208
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,340
That's where it gets interesting.

1209
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,083
He does not seem to think that he does 
have any responsibility at all for the 

1210
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:32,260
people that are working for him teaching
these classes.

1211
00:56:32,261 --> 00:56:35,180
And like he was,
he did this hbo documentary.

1212
00:56:35,181 --> 00:56:38,200
It was fucking,
they did this hbo interview about him.

1213
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,690
It was so ridiculous.
This is the big guy.

1214
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,320
Yeah.
Yeah.

1215
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,770
He goes,
the other women that will pay $1,000,000

1216
00:56:44,771 --> 00:56:49,060
for one drop of my sperm.
He says this tv,

1217
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:51,130
you can find the video.
So he's fully aware.

1218
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,680
He's fucking crazy.
He's fully aware of his crazy.

1219
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:57,850
Yeah,
he was.

1220
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:03,240
He was dismissing the idea that he would
ever sexually assault anyone.

1221
00:57:03,850 --> 00:57:04,683
He's like,
why would I do that when these women 

1222
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:09,600
that will pay $1,000,000
for one drop of my.

1223
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:12,010
Well,
it wasn't.

1224
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:15,460
Why wasn't?
Yeah,

1225
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,080
it wasn't brought.
Bryant Gumbel wasn't there.

1226
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,660
I think they're discussing it.
We're discussing this comment.

1227
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,790
You go on to see the guy because he 
looks like a.

1228
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:29,260
because he said the comment to a woman 
and she was like this.

1229
00:57:29,261 --> 00:57:30,094
She was like,
what in the fuck did you say hbo shows 

1230
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:37,830
various crammer breaks down million 
dollars.

1231
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,840
Sperm Interview Interview Shit that you 
said.

1232
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:48,880
There's some shit that you say where 
people go,

1233
00:57:48,881 --> 00:57:50,030
wait,
what the fuck?

1234
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,920
Holy Shit.
Yeah.

1235
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:57,640
There's some things that are calling it 
that you would call beyond the Pale.

1236
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,730
Well,
I love.

1237
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:01,630
I love just seeing pictures.
You hear these stories,

1238
00:58:01,631 --> 00:58:02,680
then you see him,
he's like,

1239
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:05,320
you're like grandpa.
He's like,

1240
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:06,280
oh,
loose skin,

1241
00:58:06,281 --> 00:58:09,490
and he's balding and.
But that's the thing.

1242
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:12,730
It's like when you're in a power of a 
powerful position like that,

1243
00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:17,910
he's very spiritual and people will pay 
$1,000,000.

1244
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,150
What does it say from being circumspect?
A real sport?

1245
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,133
Uh,
the 70 year old went off on a rant 

1246
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:28,960
claiming 500 women a day wanted to sleep
with him for,

1247
00:58:28,961 --> 00:58:33,961
have committed suicide over his charms,
and people would pay $1,000,000

1248
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,000
for a drop of his sperm.
CNL Irish.

1249
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:38,863
If you lived in that world,
I would just shoot loads every day and 

1250
00:58:40,541 --> 00:58:41,770
then retire.
If you,

1251
00:58:41,771 --> 00:58:44,230

1252
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,600

00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:50,860
Celery.
Yeah.

1254
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,920
Is that Vegan nonsense propaganda pieces
adds to the pop.

1255
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,020
Who tells you that?
The salary people.

1256
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,210
That's like some fucking salary lobby.
No,

1257
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,620
it's true.
Salary does.

1258
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:06,770
How do you know?
I read,

1259
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,260
I read something.

1261
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,480
Salary was Jamie got here.

1263
00:59:16,961 --> 00:59:19,570
famous,
rich women in the world.

1264
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,990
If have to sleep with women and have to

1265
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,823
sleep,
you know,

1266
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,660
by thousand garden every day she tells 
in women a day one to sleep with,

1267
00:59:26,661 --> 00:59:30,190
you commit suicide.
Four of them.

1268
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:32,053
You're saying that for different women,
for different ornament each killed 

1269
00:59:34,641 --> 00:59:36,520
themselves because you wouldn't have sex
one time.

1270
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:42,140
Why I am doing it.
Women People's been $1,000,000

1271
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:47,320
for one drop of my sperm million dollar 
in day.

1272
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,703
Every drop.
That idiot or dumb to believe those 

1273
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,950
trash to women or the trash.
Yeah.

1274
00:59:57,050 --> 01:00:00,380
I begged him pump trash and give them 
life.

1275
01:00:01,010 --> 01:00:03,470
Oh my God.
Seventy years old.

1276
01:00:03,471 --> 01:00:08,471
He looks pretty good for a 70 year old 
selling all that loads.

1277
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,880
Oh my God.
I don't last very long.

1278
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,600
I gotta to get it dry up real quick.
Yeah,

1279
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:18,410
they get gross.
Do you know man?

1280
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:19,220
Oh Man.
Yeah.

1281
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,180
So that spiritual thing like that,
but that's.

1282
01:00:23,210 --> 01:00:24,120
Yeah.
Yeah.

1283
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,580
It's like the problem with it is you're 
still an animal,

1284
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,490
right?
So the animal.

1285
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,910
It's like we were talking about before 
with the wolves gone,

1286
01:00:32,930 --> 01:00:36,840
these surplus kills and they kill all 
these elk and they don't eat them again.

1287
01:00:36,860 --> 01:00:38,240
Wyoming.
There was a recent issue,

1288
01:00:38,241 --> 01:00:39,074
there was 18 elk that were killed by 
wolves in these surplus killings is a 

1289
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:43,550
real tragic.
Yeah.

1290
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,610
These walls can't help themselves.
It's just their instincts.

1291
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:51,200
So his instincts as a man,
he has instincts to procreate,

1292
01:00:51,201 --> 01:00:52,034
right?
His instincts to respond to women that 

1293
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:57,910
are sexually attracted to him,
and he teaches these classes in front of

1294
01:00:57,990 --> 01:01:01,280
hundreds and thousands of people and 
everybody loves and adores him.

1295
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:02,413
Soon he fucked up twisted brain.
Everything that he said there made 

1296
01:01:05,091 --> 01:01:07,430
sense.
My favorite part of it was that woman,

1297
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:08,420
Andrea,
when she,

1298
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:10,960
when she clarified.
So you're saying,

1299
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:14,600
you're saying that for women have 
committed to it like,

1300
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:17,810
I want this motherfucker has to be clear
on this nonsense.

1301
01:01:17,811 --> 01:01:21,000
I like how she's there is.
She doesn't even change her expressions.

1302
01:01:21,001 --> 01:01:22,580
She's just like.
So you're saying?

1303
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:23,391
Yeah.
I mean,

1304
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:24,224
look at that girl right now.
He's standing on top of a woman's hips 

1305
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:30,440
as she's bent over backwards.
That girl is like,

1306
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:33,350
he wants me.
He standing over me.

1307
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,470
I've taken a lot of yoga classes.
Nobody ever stood on my hips.

1308
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,180
Now,
hey bro,

1309
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,433
but I do like it when you're doing yoga 
and they come over and they like push 

1310
01:01:41,271 --> 01:01:43,100
your legs down and you're like,
yeah,

1311
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:44,630
well it's a little depressing.
Oh Shit.

1312
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:47,450
I just spilled assistant.
I spelled wine.

1313
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:49,040
Leave it there bro.
Let it sink in.

1314
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,650
That's good for the,
the Patina.

1315
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,960
I'm learning those,
those terms,

1316
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:56,640
the Patina.
So there.

1317
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,960
So when you're in the church,
the Church of Yoga,

1318
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:04,070
home or real and you're abusing your 
power,

1319
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:08,270
that's a different animal because you're
dealing abusing with children.

1320
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:10,013
It's a totally different animal and then
we've taken six year olds and abusing 

1321
01:02:12,801 --> 01:02:13,820
them.
It's a different animal.

1322
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,033
You know what I mean?
Like it's like there's levels to this 

1323
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:16,851
shit,
right?

1324
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:19,110
Like the guy killing his brother is 
horrific to me.

1325
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:20,040
The guy killing his

1326
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:20,873
brother's wife,
more horrific guy killing his brother's 

1327
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,870
wife and then kids.
Impossible.

1328
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:27,360
Demonic.
It's like what you were saying earlier,

1329
01:02:27,361 --> 01:02:30,390
like do you believe in good or evil?
I don't know if I believe in it,

1330
01:02:30,391 --> 01:02:31,224
but if it did exist,
it exists in the minds of men exist in 

1331
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:35,940
that time,

1332
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,760
you know,
it's a no or.

1333
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,600
Yeah,

1334
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,433
but you know what I,
I had this bit that I did on my last 

1335
01:02:41,331 --> 01:02:42,164
special and it was about men's rights 
groups and I was trying to figure out a 

1336
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:52,010
way to say this and make it be funny,
but it's so true that I said men commit.

1337
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:57,340
Most of the murderer men commit.
Most of the rape men cause all the war.

1338
01:02:58,070 --> 01:02:58,903
This is,
these are facts like the most horrific 

1339
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:02,540
things in our life,
our war,

1340
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,130
murder,
rape,

1341
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,023
those are the most horrific things in 
all of life means death pales in 

1342
01:03:08,211 --> 01:03:11,300
comparison and I think men steal more 
than women too,

1343
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:14,570
but that that's the evil.
This is.

1344
01:03:14,571 --> 01:03:15,404
If there was a demon and the demon came 
down to earth and there's only three 

1345
01:03:17,691 --> 01:03:20,120
things that it could get you to do,
it would get you to rape,

1346
01:03:20,121 --> 01:03:21,630
murder and caused war.
Right?

1347
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:24,590
So if a demon was real demon would be 
men.

1348
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:26,050
I get,
I,

1349
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:28,340
I said this as a joke that I get 
feminists,

1350
01:03:28,390 --> 01:03:29,450
like in the special.
I was like,

1351
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:30,770
I get it.
If I was a feminist,

1352
01:03:30,771 --> 01:03:32,120
I'd be one too.
I'm like,

1353
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:34,160
I can't be one as a man because they're 
not real,

1354
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,310
because like male feminists,
like they're just tricksters.

1355
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:40,760
They're just like,
show me a male feminist that can pick up

1356
01:03:40,761 --> 01:03:45,380
heavy things and run really fast.
You don't exist this,

1357
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,740
you have a limited parameter where 
you're allowed to be a male feminist,

1358
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,000
but yeah,
but I get it,

1359
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:53,750
but when I look at the actions of men,
if you're an objective person,

1360
01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:57,050
you take yourself out of the human race 
and you look at all,

1361
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:01,850
all human beings and you look at the 
horror that meant not that women haven't

1362
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,713
done awful shit and falsely accused 
people and killed their kids and women 

1363
01:04:06,531 --> 01:04:07,700
have done all those things.
Sure.

1364
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:08,543
Some women,
some.

1365
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:12,100
But the vast majority of horrors I've 
been

1366
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:14,090
had been committed by men.
Yeah,

1367
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,220
I know.
I know.

1368
01:04:16,221 --> 01:04:17,790
It's a very primitive,
uh,

1369
01:04:18,010 --> 01:04:18,843
a way to look at the world that there's 
good and evil and it exists in these 

1370
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,900
certain ways.
That's good.

1371
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,060
That's all good.
All right.

1372
01:04:25,061 --> 01:04:26,550
But hit it.
That Toki crazy.

1373
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:29,030
I'm worried that I won't be funnier 
after I do this.

1374
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:30,470
Let's see me pick up the slack.

1375
01:04:33,290 --> 01:04:35,120
Did you like Elon Musk?
You're a Goddamn parent.

1376
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:35,983
Pioneer.

1377
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:38,920
Jamie's going to go deeper.

1378
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,260
Jamie's going for three,
I think is that Jamie has hip problem.

1379
01:04:43,270 --> 01:04:43,950
If you,
uh,

1380
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:48,950
if you see a video of the floor,
she hits the wrong button.

1381
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,640
Like biggie smalls over there in a cloud
of.

1382
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,253
What's amazed.
Amazing to me is that this is now a 100 

1383
01:04:56,911 --> 01:04:59,730
percent legal here.
It's still not federally.

1384
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,870
Right?
Well,

1385
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,290
that's what was funny about the Eland 
thing when Elan smoked it here.

1386
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:07,500
It was like,
it's totally legal.

1387
01:05:07,501 --> 01:05:08,334
It's totally okay.
But in everyone's minds they're still 

1388
01:05:09,991 --> 01:05:10,501
like,
no,

1389
01:05:10,501 --> 01:05:12,180
it's not.
Yeah.

1390
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:13,990
Well they need to let it go.
And this is why.

1391
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:14,150
No,
I didn't

1392
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:15,740
need to let it go.
We're on your side.

1393
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:16,470
You know,
I'm,

1394
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:19,850
I'm on,
I'm on like the,

1395
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,820
the,
the good people of government,

1396
01:05:22,030 --> 01:05:24,240
law enforcement,
fire department,

1397
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:25,420
military,
the good people.

1398
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:26,650
If I'm on your side,
man.

1399
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,820
Yeah.
And I'm a stoner.

1400
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,073
I'm on your side.
I'm on your side a thousand million 

1401
01:05:31,061 --> 01:05:31,640
percent.

1402
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:32,473
And making it legal actually helps all 
that because now you don't have to go 

1403
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,220
out and fight these phony war is against
it.

1404
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:38,093
It doesn't just do that.
It makes people more compassionate and 

1405
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:41,713
it makes people look.
It's like everything else you can abuse 

1406
01:05:44,851 --> 01:05:46,050
beating off.
You know,

1407
01:05:46,051 --> 01:05:49,760
I remember when I was a million dollars 
a drop $1,000,000

1408
01:05:50,350 --> 01:05:52,490
for one drop of my sperm.
You know,

1409
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:55,770
if you're a person that gets obsessed 
with masturbation,

1410
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,980
like you could ruin your life.
Yeah.

1411
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:02,610
There's people that are legitimate porn 
addictions where they watch porn eight,

1412
01:06:02,611 --> 01:06:04,450
10 hours a day and they can't stop.
Right.

1413
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:05,850
This is like everything.
Yeah.

1414
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:08,820
I think you can ruin yourself with 
sugar.

1415
01:06:08,821 --> 01:06:11,510
You can ruin yourself with food.
You can ruin yourself with,

1416
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,080
with laziness.
You can.

1417
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:15,480
You can get into a habit where you just 
can't get up.

1418
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:16,373
Yeah.
You know,

1419
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,710
you can get into a comfort zone.
We just want to take baths.

1420
01:06:19,711 --> 01:06:22,370
All right.
People do shit like.

1421
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,011
Yeah.
No,

1422
01:06:23,011 --> 01:06:24,030
I know.
Exactly.

1423
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:24,953
Yeah.
There's.

1424
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:28,020
Did Roseanne say she did that after all 
of her bullshit went down,

1425
01:06:28,021 --> 01:06:30,000
she has gotten the bath all the time.
Drank wine.

1426
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:34,230
Was that this is their safe space.
I apologize,

1427
01:06:34,231 --> 01:06:35,064
I wasn't

1428
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,020
so um,
so anyway,

1429
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:40,290
I know it's a very basic way.
I mean we've been talking about good and

1430
01:06:40,291 --> 01:06:44,820
evil since the time of the men were able
and women were able to,

1431
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,000
you know,
write and philosophize and.

1432
01:06:47,490 --> 01:06:48,780
But it,
I don't know,

1433
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:49,614
it just seems to me lately like I've see
it feels to me like evil and good is 

1434
01:06:54,451 --> 01:06:58,950
actually a force that we're struggling 
with and I know there's,

1435
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:03,720
I know like some people would say that's
kind of a primitive way of thinking,

1436
01:07:03,721 --> 01:07:06,410
but I do kind of feel like,
uh,

1437
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:11,960
it actually is a very real,
tangible thing.

1438
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:14,760
And that.

1439
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,330
What makes you think this,
your personal feelings?

1440
01:07:18,331 --> 01:07:21,810
Is it based on like your intuition?
Like what is it?

1441
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:23,560
I,
yeah,

1442
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,510
it's intuition.
It's like a vibe.

1443
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:26,433
It's like a,
it's just like a maybe because I'm 

1444
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:32,440
showing up at church and kind of like 
searching a little bit.

1445
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:33,363
Myself and I,
I am very much about good people doing 

1446
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:40,030
good things and I've just been kind of 
conscious of it,

1447
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:44,920
but then there's always like these,
this rise of evil that comes up like all

1448
01:07:44,921 --> 01:07:45,754
of a sudden white supremacists are.
These riots are these horrible things 

1449
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,980
against people in different parts of the
world and it's.

1450
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:54,280
It seems like it's an ongoing struggle

1451
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:55,133
look almost like why hasn't caught up 
yet to the way you look at the world 

1452
01:07:57,880 --> 01:08:01,070
where a lot of people look at the world.
A lot of people look at the world like,

1453
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:03,540
like if Tom Papa,
if you were in charge,

1454
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:04,374
and if you had to push all the buttons,
that would sort of decide how people 

1455
01:08:07,801 --> 01:08:09,810
behaved.
If that was a possible thing.

1456
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,673
Of course you'd have one of the first 
thing you do is eliminate all the 

1457
01:08:12,031 --> 01:08:14,640
violence and all the horrors of the 
world.

1458
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:15,880
Yeah.
And if.

1459
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,690
And then also,
I'm sorry to cut you off,

1460
01:08:17,691 --> 01:08:18,524
but you also see the.
All those hires are done by these men 

1461
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:25,280
and stuff.
Who when you sit in like kind of analyze

1462
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:26,114
them and they've been the victims of a 
lot of things and there's like genetic 

1463
01:08:28,941 --> 01:08:33,170
victimization and social and it's like,
so where's that coming from?

1464
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,033
Why are these,
this kid that could have been okay ends 

1465
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:37,604
up in this life of crime and ended up 
murdering somebody and where's that 

1466
01:08:40,131 --> 01:08:40,964
coming from?
Is this just a genetic mutation or is 

1467
01:08:42,801 --> 01:08:45,980
there like a force of good and evil?

1468
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:47,373
I think we're still.
We're still dealing with the echoes of 

1469
01:08:49,661 --> 01:08:50,494
the past.
That's what I really firmly believe and 

1470
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:53,613
I think also the way maybe you and I are
having this conversation the way a lot 

1471
01:08:56,951 --> 01:08:59,860
of people are having these conversations
today just like us,

1472
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:01,013
but basically the same sort of rational 
people sitting around with no agenda 

1473
01:09:05,651 --> 01:09:06,910
going,
why does this exist?

1474
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:09,460
Why does all the horrors of life?
Why?

1475
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,870
Why is all this injustice?
Why is that there?

1476
01:09:11,900 --> 01:09:14,790
Yeah.
I think this is it.

1477
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:19,710
We haven't been here that long.
I just really think that that's real and

1478
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,120
I think we need to absorb that much 
better.

1479
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:23,153
Our time spent in modern civilization 
versus the time of life on earth is a 

1480
01:09:28,391 --> 01:09:29,920
joke.
The time on life,

1481
01:09:29,921 --> 01:09:32,920
on earth and in relationship to the time
of the universe is a joke.

1482
01:09:32,921 --> 01:09:34,480
Right?
The numbers are insane.

1483
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:35,533
I can't understand that.
We literally were monkeys just a couple 

1484
01:09:38,531 --> 01:09:39,400
of weeks ago.
Right.

1485
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:44,350
But the bit that I have my act about the
United States being founded in 1776,

1486
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:49,390
that's three people go behind her.
That's three people go really is.

1487
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:50,141
Yeah.
That's nothing.

1488
01:09:50,141 --> 01:09:50,974
So three people go.
People were these creatures that had to 

1489
01:09:56,081 --> 01:10:01,081
make fire to stay warm.
They didn't have electricity.

1490
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:03,080
They didn't have engines.
Yeah,

1491
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:03,963
they.
They made boats at a trees and they use 

1492
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:06,634
the wind to drift across the ocean while
staring at the stars with the fucking 

1493
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,900
gigantic harp looking thing.
Right.

1494
01:10:11,901 --> 01:10:13,180
What was the thing?
A sextant?

1495
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:14,053
Yeah.
That thing that they use to figure out 

1496
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:19,030
where the other ones are.
She had a trust that these motherfuckers

1497
01:10:19,031 --> 01:10:21,130
had mapped out the universe.
Well,

1498
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:23,950
that was.
You could make it across the ocean and a

1499
01:10:23,951 --> 01:10:25,750
lot of people died of scurvy along the 
way.

1500
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:28,110
Like fuck man,
that's crazy.

1501
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:31,290
Not long ago,
so God damned recent.

1502
01:10:31,350 --> 01:10:32,183
Yeah.
When I was listening to Dan Carlin's 

1503
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:37,180
hardcore history,
one of the best podcasts ever to be,

1504
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:38,043
I don't know if you're so good,
but he has this thing on the mon goals 

1505
01:10:41,591 --> 01:10:42,424
called the wrath of the cons and what 
freaked me out is not just how crazy 

1506
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:46,654
that world was back then and what 
unbelievable damage and destruction the 

1507
01:10:50,951 --> 01:10:51,784
Mongols created and how they just 
conquered empires just moved across the 

1508
01:10:55,241 --> 01:10:57,310
world,
killed millions and millions of people,

1509
01:10:57,430 --> 01:11:01,870
but it was really fucked up was I think 
Google does to make sure I'm not wrong.

1510
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:06,900
I think that was only like 1200 BC.
I don't think that was that long ago.

1511
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:08,690
Right?
Yeah.

1512
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:13,060
It's really recent.
That's really recent.

1513
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:18,090
I think Gingiss Kahn died in the $1,200,
if I remember correctly.

1514
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,710
100 add add.
Oh,

1515
01:11:20,711 --> 01:11:22,720
well did I say BC?
I actually met a day.

1516
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,043
I said BC,
but it really did mean a dj in the more 

1517
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:27,870
recent 800 years.
I'm a little stone.

1518
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:31,710
Folks are a lot more recent,
but that 1200,

1519
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:32,401
well,
1200,

1520
01:11:32,401 --> 01:11:35,040
so c would still be still be pretty 
fucking recent,

1521
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,320
but 1,280,
which is what I meant to say.

1522
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,700
Right.
So recent.

1523
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:43,770
That's just not that long ago.
We're starting to make wine and sour.

1524
01:11:43,830 --> 01:11:47,340
Does it go the other way?
Other way?

1525
01:11:47,610 --> 01:11:48,443
Seven Ninety two 70 to 792 years ago a 
guy killed 50 million people during his 

1526
01:11:55,381 --> 01:11:57,320
lifetime with his actions.
Right.

1527
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,640
They changed the carbon footprint of the
world.

1528
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:02,960
I mean they,
I mean they,

1529
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:05,170
they.
So then you're saying it's,

1530
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:07,453
you're saying it's more surprising that 
we're doing this kind of stuff and that 

1531
01:12:10,021 --> 01:12:10,854
we have electric cars and medicine and 
all this other kind of like it's more 

1532
01:12:13,231 --> 01:12:14,064
surprising that we're doing that than it
is that people are running around 

1533
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:18,540
killing each other.

1534
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:19,770
Well,
Nazi Germany,

1535
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,710
that was 19 forties.
It's crazy.

1536
01:12:23,100 --> 01:12:25,850
That's maybe crazier than anything.
You know,

1537
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:28,240
if you and Carla and has some great 
stuff on that too,

1538
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:30,270
in the history of World War One and 
World War Two,

1539
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:31,670
but if you're,
you're,

1540
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:37,050
you're watching a documentary on that 
and you watch those people move around.

1541
01:12:37,051 --> 01:12:38,520
Especially that one that you showed me,
Jamie,

1542
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:41,490
that's been digitally remastered when 
you see it in color,

1543
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,440
is that Ken?
Is it Ken Burns it to that?

1544
01:12:43,441 --> 01:12:44,280
Yeah,
I think so.

1545
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:45,683
They digitally remastered some footage 
from World War One and you get to watch 

1546
01:12:48,421 --> 01:12:51,320
these people move around,
like in real time you realized like,

1547
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,390
Oh,
these are just people.

1548
01:12:53,420 --> 01:12:56,910
They're just just like you.
I know and this is 100 years ago,

1549
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,133
years ago were involved in this crazy 
ass war and then a few years later 

1550
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,870
involved another crazy ass war.
Yeah.

1551
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:06,060
So why can't we figure it out?
Dude,

1552
01:13:06,220 --> 01:13:06,990
I'm telling you.

1553
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:08,910
Will is present.
I don't know.

1554
01:13:08,911 --> 01:13:09,744
I think.
I think it used to be the only way that 

1555
01:13:11,371 --> 01:13:12,204
people got by,
I think killing each other and I think 

1556
01:13:15,031 --> 01:13:15,864
from going from small groups of people 
which like in these small groups of 

1557
01:13:19,471 --> 01:13:22,830
people,
they would have interpersonal conflicts.

1558
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:25,470
They would have fights with members in 
the tribe,

1559
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:29,400
but they would sort it out and there 
would probably be some sort of rule that

1560
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:30,234
they would all try to live by,
but then they would get invaded by 

1561
01:13:32,851 --> 01:13:33,684
people that didn't have anything and 
we'll look for your stuff and they came 

1562
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:39,240
over the top of the hill and they killed
and they raped and they.

1563
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:42,750
They stole women and they just did that 
for a long ass time.

1564
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:45,420
Man.
They did that for a long ass time.

1565
01:13:45,620 --> 01:13:48,960
This was the history of the steps like 
that.

1566
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:52,470
Dan Carlin maps out in this wrath of the
con thing makes you go,

1567
01:13:52,770 --> 01:13:53,431
Jesus,
Chris,

1568
01:13:53,431 --> 01:13:58,431
imagine being born.
Just imagine how crazy that meant.

1569
01:13:59,041 --> 01:13:59,874
Being a baby.
It seeing arrows flying around and 

1570
01:14:02,490 --> 01:14:03,323
people call it open to people were 
lighting people on fire and launching 

1571
01:14:06,391 --> 01:14:11,391
them onto roofs with catapults.
This is the footage for world war one,

1572
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:12,070
so

1573
01:14:12,070 --> 01:14:16,180
look how they digitally remastered it 
and Peter Jackson movie,

1574
01:14:16,181 --> 01:14:17,620
I believe,
or a documentary.

1575
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:18,454
That's the craziest thing.
When you look at history and you think 

1576
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:20,411
that,
well that was.

1577
01:14:20,411 --> 01:14:21,250
Then it's like,
no,

1578
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:23,130
they're just us.
Just happened to be there.

1579
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:25,040
Really no different than you and me,
dude,

1580
01:14:25,180 --> 01:14:28,750
we haven't been here this long.
We haven't been here this long.

1581
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:32,140
This is the thing like people that 
looked like this,

1582
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:36,160
that awaring like uniforms and that are,
you know,

1583
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:39,970
have like decent stuff,
nice wheels to their wagons.

1584
01:14:41,370 --> 01:14:43,380
That's real recent man.
No,

1585
01:14:43,390 --> 01:14:44,223
I know it's recent as fuck.
And there's been a bunch of different 

1586
01:14:46,811 --> 01:14:48,810
ways that people have done it,
you know,

1587
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,420
but even if you go back to Egypt,
so it isn't the act of like,

1588
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:53,403
okay,
so we know like that guy who lit his 

1589
01:14:54,851 --> 01:14:55,684
house on fire,
we know that is a just instinctually we 

1590
01:15:00,011 --> 01:15:02,800
know and have known during even all this
history,

1591
01:15:03,130 --> 01:15:05,680
we've known that that is evil like,
right.

1592
01:15:05,890 --> 01:15:08,050
You know what I mean?
Like it's insanely selfish.

1593
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:09,213
It's not like we went from having to 
like eat each other and that we're 

1594
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:13,210
trying to get our act together.
You know what I mean?

1595
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:15,670
There is a,
we all know that.

1596
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:18,850
That is such a evil,
evil thing.

1597
01:15:20,710 --> 01:15:22,480
I think it exists.
I think we have to fight it.

1598
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:23,200
Well,
it's,

1599
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,290
it is evil,
but it's ego that's causing that,

1600
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:28,030
right?
That guy didn't want to go to jail.

1601
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:28,893
It didn't want to shoot himself,
didn't want to kill himself and didn't 

1602
01:15:31,601 --> 01:15:32,434
want to go to jail.
So he decided he was gonna kill a bunch 

1603
01:15:34,421 --> 01:15:36,750
of people to make up a story.
He,

1604
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:39,460
he had a plot and this plot was to save 
himself,

1605
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:40,733
you know,
and that's when people get trapped in a 

1606
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:47,410
situation where they're allowed to make 
decisions and they're allowed to,

1607
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:51,940
if not allowed to,
but if they choose to make decisions and

1608
01:15:51,941 --> 01:15:52,774
those decisions are horrific and then 
they have to somehow or another justify 

1609
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:57,940
those decisions because they never look 
at their own behavior.

1610
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:58,803
They always judge other people.
This is a pattern that people fall into 

1611
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,520
when they're always looking for other 
people to always be wrong.

1612
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:05,200
Right.
And they never grow.

1613
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:06,423
And so like a guy like that,
if you so psychotic that he could kill 

1614
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:10,384
somebody and then he has this decision 
to make this decision is to kill the 

1615
01:16:13,601 --> 01:16:16,570
wife and the kids still like he's just 
always got to be right.

1616
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,160
You know what I'm saying?
Like he's always,

1617
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,650
he's got it,
he's trying to cover his tracks,

1618
01:16:20,651 --> 01:16:21,484
he's trying to lie,
always like this is the type of person 

1619
01:16:24,781 --> 01:16:26,260
that could do something like that.
Again,

1620
01:16:26,261 --> 01:16:27,094
this is a horrific pattern of thought 
and it might have been triggered by the 

1621
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:30,004
murder itself,
so it's just a chemical flip in his 

1622
01:16:31,421 --> 01:16:33,250
brain that says,
now I can kill people.

1623
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:34,193
Like he hasn't done it as whole life and
he's just going into the subway and 

1624
01:16:36,521 --> 01:16:37,354
getting a sandwich with all the stuff on
it and just be like watching the Monday 

1625
01:16:41,621 --> 01:16:43,810
night football and then the next week 
he's like,

1626
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,120
something flips in his brain is like,
no,

1627
01:16:46,121 --> 01:16:46,954
now I can kill.
I don't think it's the people that I 

1628
01:16:49,151 --> 01:16:51,850
know and love.
I think in a fit of rage,

1629
01:16:52,420 --> 01:16:54,580
in a fit of rage if does something 
horrific.

1630
01:16:54,670 --> 01:16:55,503
And then I think he's one of those 
people that tries to justify his 

1631
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:58,444
actions.
So it just tries to figure out a way 

1632
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:02,253
where he can justify it.
They're going to be in hell anyway 

1633
01:17:06,131 --> 01:17:08,140
because the guy's dead.
You know,

1634
01:17:08,150 --> 01:17:09,250
they,
they'd probably

1635
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:13,580
been thinking that deep.
He could.

1636
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:15,230
You think we're crazy?
Man,

1637
01:17:15,231 --> 01:17:17,420
they come up with justification,
but we came from,

1638
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:20,570
like we said before,
this is an Italian dude like us,

1639
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:23,330
but he could've also,
we don't know if he's medicated.

1640
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:27,230
Do we know that that's a brain 
chemistry.

1641
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:29,720
We don't know what he was doing,
you know what I mean?

1642
01:17:29,721 --> 01:17:31,920
He could have been on something which,
uh,

1643
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:34,160
you know,
makes people do horrific things.

1644
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:35,810
Do you think,
do you believe in Karma?

1645
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:42,410
I think for sure that when you put 
energy out there,

1646
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:43,703
it affects things around you in terms of
the way people interact with you and 

1647
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:51,120
that in turn affects the way they will 
interact with other people as well.

1648
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:52,800
And I think there's,
there's,

1649
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:53,940
there's a certain amount,

1650
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:55,660
there's an energy you put out,
it's,

1651
01:17:55,780 --> 01:17:56,613
you could call it that,
but that makes it sound like you've got 

1652
01:17:57,851 --> 01:17:59,980
a crystal in your pocket,
right?

1653
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:02,000
Not really.
Energy.

1654
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:06,040
Real energy is a real thing.
There's a real right.

1655
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:06,874
If I was,
if I was a murderer and came and sat in 

1656
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:11,233
here,
there'd be a different vibe than what 

1657
01:18:12,431 --> 01:18:13,850
you're feeling from me.
Yeah,

1658
01:18:13,851 --> 01:18:14,990
for sure.
You know what I mean?

1659
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,380
For sure.
Yeah.

1660
01:18:16,540 --> 01:18:17,373
A chronic masturbator well,
it's also people that are off and then 

1661
01:18:22,571 --> 01:18:25,270
struggling with the fact that they've 
done something awful.

1662
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,740
Right.
There's like an energy to that.

1663
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:29,530
It's like constantly being on edge 
energy.

1664
01:18:29,590 --> 01:18:31,570
Yeah.
Every crime and punishment.

1665
01:18:32,020 --> 01:18:34,210
That's still CFC.
I'd never read that.

1666
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,140
Oh,
you should read it.

1667
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:40,020
It's so he kills someone in the East 
carrying the guilt.

1668
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:43,450
Latest description of the Gulf.
Just carrying that thing.

1669
01:18:43,870 --> 01:18:45,670
Now that guy is going to admit and 
energy,

1670
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:47,253
but you don't think there's Karma just 
for like you do something bad and 

1671
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:50,490
something bad will happen.

1672
01:18:50,490 --> 01:18:54,060
I think a genuinely believe,
and this is no crystals in my pocket,

1673
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:58,350
I genuinely believe that if you do 
something that you know to be awful,

1674
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,470
that that has an equal effect coming 
back at you,

1675
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:06,003
like whatever bad that you've put out in
terms of like doing something evil to a 

1676
01:19:10,951 --> 01:19:11,784
person,
the way you feel personally about 

1677
01:19:14,491 --> 01:19:17,970
yourself,
you will take an equal blow.

1678
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,970
I really believe that.
And where does that come from?

1679
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:24,150
I think comes from your own 
introspective thinking.

1680
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,790
I think.
And worse,

1681
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:28,320
you know,
you might even feel worse than that per.

1682
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:29,303
You'd say something rude to a person 
just because you're tired and then you 

1683
01:19:31,771 --> 01:19:33,060
realize you said some rude,
annoying,

1684
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:35,830
right.
Why did I do that?

1685
01:19:35,831 --> 01:19:36,664
I didn't mean.
And then they could be like Tom Papa's 

1686
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:39,330
not really.
Not.

1687
01:19:39,331 --> 01:19:41,000
I just am so tired,
you know?

1688
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:42,540
And you'd just asked me something 
stupid.

1689
01:19:42,541 --> 01:19:43,750
I'm sorry.
It's like,

1690
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,000
it's hard to turn that around.
Yeah.

1691
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:49,950
So you might hate yourself more than 
they even get mad at you.

1692
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,010
So Karma is really,
you're dealing with the energy.

1693
01:19:53,011 --> 01:19:55,800
It's not the universe saying now 
something bad's going to happen to you.

1694
01:19:56,010 --> 01:20:00,060
You're kind of creating it with your own
actions and your own stuff.

1695
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:01,233
I think it's real dangerous when we 
pretend that we have any sort of real 

1696
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:06,093
understanding of the patterns,
all the events that take place in the 

1697
01:20:09,391 --> 01:20:11,700
world.
So when you start to say like someone,

1698
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,770
something happened to someone because of
Karma.

1699
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:15,323
That's okay.
The problem with saying that is what 

1700
01:20:17,431 --> 01:20:20,460
about babies?
What about babies with leukemia?

1701
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:22,950
Were they bad babies?
What happened?

1702
01:20:22,980 --> 01:20:25,200
Why did they get cancer?
Why they die young?

1703
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:27,700
Why did they die in car accidents?
Why?

1704
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:31,460
That doesn't make any sense.
They've never done anything bad there,

1705
01:20:31,730 --> 01:20:36,290
but that's where you could say that bad 
shit happens to us all,

1706
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:38,570
but can you create more bad shit

1707
01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:40,663
possible co two and it's also entirely 
possible that you're creating more bad 

1708
01:20:44,511 --> 01:20:45,344
shit but feeling bad about yourself 
because you've done bad shit so you 

1709
01:20:48,441 --> 01:20:51,170
create more of this negative energy that
you carry around with you.

1710
01:20:51,290 --> 01:20:55,340
I think that's entirely possible too.
But I think that we also have this weird

1711
01:20:55,370 --> 01:20:57,530
need to define things,
you know,

1712
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:02,770
and I think that we're looking to this 
thing that we're calling Karma and we're

1713
01:21:02,961 --> 01:21:03,794
saying that this is like,
this is definite correlation between 

1714
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:07,064
action and reaction and between the good
you put out there and the good that 

1715
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:14,711
comes back and my take is that I think 
there's definitely something going on,

1716
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:16,123
but I don't think we should define it 
yet because I don't think we really 

1717
01:21:18,291 --> 01:21:19,124
know.
And I think as soon as we box it up and 

1718
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:25,160
say it's this thing and this is the 
absolute reaction that the world has.

1719
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:27,050
When you put good out there,
good comes back.

1720
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,990
Good people die all the time,
folks.

1721
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,100
Good people die.

1722
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:34,850
I think there's.
I think there is an energy.

1723
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:36,400
Yeah,
and you know,

1724
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:38,900
we know it from the work that we do.
I think it's both.

1725
01:21:38,901 --> 01:21:39,734
When you stand on stage,
there's an energy in that room that 

1726
01:21:42,351 --> 01:21:43,184
transference between you and the people 
that are out there and you're playing 

1727
01:21:45,651 --> 01:21:49,010
with it and it's a real thing.
It's a very real thing.

1728
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:50,160
It's like hypnosis,
right?

1729
01:21:50,161 --> 01:21:50,994
Yeah,
yeah,

1730
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:52,010
yeah.
It is.

1731
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:55,670
And and then they can.
They can reverse hip,

1732
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:56,863
hypnotize you.
They could bring this other energy the 

1733
01:21:58,431 --> 01:21:59,264
other way so that there is this energy 
of all of us out there and running 

1734
01:22:03,111 --> 01:22:03,944
around.
It's not that far to think then there 

1735
01:22:06,801 --> 01:22:10,820
couldn't be good energy and there's bad 
energy and there's an.

1736
01:22:10,821 --> 01:22:11,654
Is that ultimately good and evil?
Maybe it is all generated from human 

1737
01:22:15,921 --> 01:22:16,754
beings.
Maybe if you educated everyone and they 

1738
01:22:18,111 --> 01:22:18,944
could all be kind and try and come at it
that way we could actually feel that 

1739
01:22:21,621 --> 01:22:22,454
there was more good,
but that's just more good coming from 

1740
01:22:24,171 --> 01:22:25,130
people I don't know.

1741
01:22:25,150 --> 01:22:25,983
Well,
if you want to get really spacey with 

1742
01:22:26,921 --> 01:22:29,020
this really,
really spacey,

1743
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:32,410
it's the holidays you go,
okay,

1744
01:22:32,411 --> 01:22:34,990
well what?
What exactly are people doing?

1745
01:22:35,350 --> 01:22:37,840
That's what you do here.
What are people doing?

1746
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:39,040
What are they doing?
Like,

1747
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:43,150
what's our purpose to be being here?
Look at us from an outside perspective,

1748
01:22:43,151 --> 01:22:43,984
like pretend you're not a person.
You're looking at all the people like 

1749
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,880
what are they doing?
They're moving really fast.

1750
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:49,723
They're spending most of their time 
doing things they don't want to do and 

1751
01:22:51,701 --> 01:22:52,534
they're buying stuff bustling around 
because they're throwing all this money 

1752
01:22:55,091 --> 01:22:57,220
at stuff.
The stuff keeps getting better,

1753
01:22:57,221 --> 01:22:58,054
so every year the stuff keeps getting 
more complex and more capable and more 

1754
01:23:01,361 --> 01:23:04,720
high tech and more space age.
This is bananas,

1755
01:23:04,721 --> 01:23:05,554
man.
I to watch her and call me fucking Dick 

1756
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,540
Tracy man,
right?

1757
01:23:08,770 --> 01:23:09,603
Yeah,
and that as people keep going on and on 

1758
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:12,190
and on and on with this stuff.

1759
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:13,473
This is where we need some sort of 
energy behind this innovation and a lot 

1760
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:22,720
of the energy is conflict.
Conflict and resolution.

1761
01:23:22,721 --> 01:23:25,570
Conflict and resolution.
Conflict and victory,

1762
01:23:25,571 --> 01:23:26,404
victory and defeat and the defeat makes 
your work harder and and there's all 

1763
01:23:29,561 --> 01:23:33,940
these interacting forces that are 
constantly moving together.

1764
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:35,860
I'm with you,
ended this.

1765
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:37,323
A lot of it is expressed.
The success of this little game has 

1766
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:44,230
expressed in material possessions.
The success in this game is expressed in

1767
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:48,760
Hamptons mansions and private jets and 
bentleys and Pam.

1768
01:23:48,761 --> 01:23:49,594
I'm winning this fucking crazy game.
OPS and there's a lot of value and 

1769
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:55,054
winning the crazy game who stopped so we
let these people acquire all this stuff 

1770
01:23:58,061 --> 01:24:01,830
and you've got all these diamonds and 
fuck yeah,

1771
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:03,943
this is.
This is forcing more stuff to be made 

1772
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:09,940
better and more innovation,
which will eventually,

1773
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,790
and this is where it gets spacious of 
all waiting for this part.

1774
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,253
This is going to be what people become.
People are going to become some sort of 

1775
01:24:16,661 --> 01:24:17,494
symbiotic organism.
Something that's tied into electronics 

1776
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:21,483
and that it's happening now.
It's happening slowly and we're making 

1777
01:24:24,911 --> 01:24:26,800
it with stuff and as we keep making 
stuff,

1778
01:24:26,801 --> 01:24:27,634
it's eventually going to get to a part 
that was the thing you would like to do 

1779
01:24:29,681 --> 01:24:33,310
more than anything is have enhanced your
experience on earth.

1780
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:35,560
Right.
I want to be able to take pictures.

1781
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:36,041
Yes.
Yes.

1782
01:24:36,041 --> 01:24:37,480
I want to be able to email people.
Yes,

1783
01:24:37,481 --> 01:24:38,110
yes.
Yeah,

1784
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:41,200
but I also want to.
I want it to make my experience on earth

1785
01:24:41,201 --> 01:24:42,034
better.
Well then we're going to have to 

1786
01:24:43,391 --> 01:24:44,650
integrate with your circuitry,
Tom,

1787
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:46,270
papa,
and then live forever.

1788
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:48,243
Maybe.
Maybe that's what the organisms are 

1789
01:24:49,091 --> 01:24:49,924
trying to do.
We're trying to get rid of the monkey 

1790
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:54,970
that wants to start the wars all the 
time.

1791
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:56,913
Right.
It's enlightenment that towards the end 

1792
01:24:59,050 --> 01:24:59,883
of our goofy ass system,
evil living there would be a great 

1793
01:25:04,121 --> 01:25:04,954
science fiction movie,
but if this is the future and they 

1794
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:07,624
probably were already made it,
but if only some people went on board 

1795
01:25:10,750 --> 01:25:13,240
with a new enlightenment that you get 
from these headsets.

1796
01:25:13,570 --> 01:25:18,460
Like remember the dude from Star Trek,
the blind guy from sesame street.

1797
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:20,470
Remember he was used to be on sesame 
street,

1798
01:25:20,471 --> 01:25:20,870
right?
Yeah,

1799
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:23,600
that he was the uh,
Lavar Burton Rainbow Boulevard.

1800
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,620
Yeah.
Reading Rainbow,

1801
01:25:24,820 --> 01:25:25,451
Lavar,
Burton,

1802
01:25:25,451 --> 01:25:25,920
Barbara,
yeah.

1803
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,910
Yeah.
We all have those things on it.

1804
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,133
There's only like 10 of them for what if
no one bought into most people bought 

1805
01:25:32,951 --> 01:25:37,630
into it and those things completely cure
you of any evil.

1806
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:41,800
It just moving along.
I think that uh,

1807
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,080
I don't know.
I mean there was,

1808
01:25:44,350 --> 01:25:46,810
maybe there is no purpose to us being 
here,

1809
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:52,040
but you got that shit for pep boys.
That's a filter.

1810
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:55,503
That's a really good,
cool air filter at the top of the 

1811
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,950
muscle,
isn't it?

1812
01:26:00,190 --> 01:26:02,860
Come on.
That's a 69 chevy.

1813
01:26:02,930 --> 01:26:03,763
Yeah.
You bought,

1814
01:26:04,270 --> 01:26:07,100
you bought that at the auto parts store 
and put it in your dose.

1815
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:09,310
Yoda Corola dope old ones,
man.

1816
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:14,311
When they fucking unscrew the chrome 
hubcap filter down.

1817
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:20,140
I always liked a good wing man and 
people don't remember man.

1818
01:26:21,021 --> 01:26:23,150
These people today,
you don't remember what gas smells like.

1819
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:25,040
Oh Man.
You could fix your own car.

1820
01:26:25,070 --> 01:26:28,700
You could open it up and with a 
screwdriver and a high school education,

1821
01:26:28,701 --> 01:26:29,534
fix your automobile.
I was never smart enough or 

1822
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:34,760
knowledgeable enough to fix my own car,
but I could do little things.

1823
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:38,360
I can change my oil.
Changed to a lot of things with old.

1824
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,410
Exactly.
Did the brakes once I did the brakes,

1825
01:26:42,411 --> 01:26:44,000
hit the brakes.
That's a bold move.

1826
01:26:44,001 --> 01:26:45,530
What if you're wrong?
I was poor.

1827
01:26:46,790 --> 01:26:49,550
I didn't have money.
I've just been buying brake pads.

1828
01:26:49,551 --> 01:26:51,370
Was a lot cheaper than having some 
guidance.

1829
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:53,960
Did you put it up on a Jack?

1830
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:54,793
How'd you put it up on a jack and a 
cinderblock that held it underneath and 

1831
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:00,770
yeah,
it was nice.

1832
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,520
It was a light little car.
Little pads.

1833
01:27:02,930 --> 01:27:03,763
Put them in.
I probably had to get it fixed after 

1834
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:05,954
that,
but.

1835
01:27:06,230 --> 01:27:07,610
But yeah,
you could fix stuff.

1836
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:09,290
There was like a time when you could 
actually.

1837
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:11,900
And you felt good about it,
but.

1838
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:13,303
But yeah,
if you had to choose between one of 

1839
01:27:15,531 --> 01:27:16,364
those fucking rickety ship boxes,
that's like a rhinoceros on roller 

1840
01:27:19,311 --> 01:27:23,790
skates versus your Tesla.
Yeah.

1841
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:25,560
No,
there's no way things can go.

1842
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,690
Fuck.
No,

1843
01:27:26,691 --> 01:27:27,524
and I wouldn't put.
I wouldn't put my kids in one of those 

1844
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:31,310
that we're driving around in those death
traps.

1845
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:34,880
Do like no steering.
No airbags.

1846
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:37,830
Hydroplane at the drop of a hat.
Exactly.

1847
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:40,430
Just spinning around.
So engine heavy.

1848
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:44,120
Remember it was a big ass engine's in 
the front.

1849
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,240
They didn't know what I'm asking.

1850
01:27:45,290 --> 01:27:46,123
Would just slide all over the place.
It was so easy to slide your car back 

1851
01:27:48,621 --> 01:27:50,870
then.
It was totally beat with your friends.

1852
01:27:50,871 --> 01:27:55,580
Just like spinning out and they figured 
out how to balance them.

1853
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:57,680
That's like,
that's the big deal.

1854
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:01,040
Like if you take a tesla or anything,
you buy a fucking camry.

1855
01:28:01,041 --> 01:28:01,874
Okay.
That camera handles better than a 69 

1856
01:28:05,181 --> 01:28:06,980
Camaro.
Fuck it.

1857
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:12,590
I wouldn't like to see what the death 
rates are better a on the roads now with

1858
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,990
like new cars.
It's got to be.

1859
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:17,970
It's probably much better.
I mean they're.

1860
01:28:18,010 --> 01:28:22,460
They're much safer,
but they're also much faster too.

1861
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:23,743
Yeah,
but you don't have to drive very fast 

1862
01:28:24,851 --> 01:28:27,620
for it to be fatal.
I didn't know how to make stuff.

1863
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:31,000
Everything was glass just filled with 
gasoline.

1864
01:28:31,010 --> 01:28:35,540
That and fucking sparks and fumes.
Fumes were everywhere.

1865
01:28:36,350 --> 01:28:38,700
Driving be getting high from the fumes,
right?

1866
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,530
I remember when I was working,
uh,

1867
01:28:40,670 --> 01:28:41,503
for a fireplace company in the summer in
New Jersey and it was in a truck and 

1868
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:45,883
we're in this truck and traffic of the 
New Jersey turnpike right by Newark 

1869
01:28:48,261 --> 01:28:51,740
airport and just the fumes from 
everything from the city,

1870
01:28:51,741 --> 01:28:52,574
from a car.
And it was just arinze in the humidity 

1871
01:28:55,161 --> 01:28:56,570
of New Jersey.
I was like,

1872
01:28:56,571 --> 01:28:59,180
if I get cancer,
this is gonna be the day that it,

1873
01:28:59,270 --> 01:29:01,160
that it hit me.
And it makes people crazy.

1874
01:29:01,290 --> 01:29:02,123
It's like,
it's like

1875
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:06,690
throwing alcohol and fire.
So freedom that dust all day.

1876
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:07,583
So disgusting.
Pull up a video of the sound of the 

1877
01:29:09,991 --> 01:29:10,824
exhaust of a 1969 Camaro.
There is something to somethings the 

1878
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:20,820
smell of gas is a good smell slot.
Just that man,

1879
01:29:20,821 --> 01:29:23,760
if that sound,
there's a sound.

1880
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:24,960
Oh,
how about this one?

1881
01:29:24,990 --> 01:29:27,310
Even better.
Nineteen Sixty Chevelle,

1882
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:29,640
1970 Chevelle.
Ss

1883
01:29:38,590 --> 01:29:43,590
America doesn't evil about that sound.
That is a drive.

1884
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:53,150
One of those mother fuckers around was 
very cool.

1885
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:54,953
I mean,
the bumper cars is preposterous as they 

1886
01:29:57,571 --> 01:29:58,404
are

1887
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:01,190
present a lot of ways.
What's great about America?

1888
01:30:01,610 --> 01:30:03,120
Yeah,
the excess.

1889
01:30:04,550 --> 01:30:06,440
Exactly.
Not giving a shit.

1890
01:30:06,441 --> 01:30:08,390
It's just so outrageous.
Let's go.

1891
01:30:08,391 --> 01:30:09,224
Let's have a good time.
Fucking giant metal explosion contained 

1892
01:30:12,501 --> 01:30:14,510
in the front of the hood.
That's all it is.

1893
01:30:14,511 --> 01:30:15,344
A giant ass

1894
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,900
explosion box.
Look at this.

1895
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:19,400
Who?
That's the 69.

1896
01:30:21,280 --> 01:30:26,280
Sixty nine.
Oh my God.

1897
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:38,320
This guy gloriousness.
You see heaven on earth,

1898
01:30:39,621 --> 01:30:40,020
right?

1899
01:30:40,020 --> 01:30:40,980
Oh,
19.

1900
01:30:40,981 --> 01:30:44,250
Sixty nine Chevelle.
Look how pretty that car is,

1901
01:30:44,251 --> 01:30:46,440
man.
If this guy is across the street from me

1902
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:47,274
and I'm looking at with my coffee out of
my window and he comes pulling out with 

1903
01:30:49,621 --> 01:30:51,390
that because Saturday morning,
you know what I'm saying?

1904
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,890
What?
This guy's an asshole.

1905
01:30:53,430 --> 01:30:55,140
Do you hear her be with his new car?

1906
01:30:55,470 --> 01:30:56,390
Do you know what?
There are midlife.

1907
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,233
You say that

1908
01:30:57,470 --> 01:30:58,303
you say that,
but I guarantee you if you were next 

1909
01:31:00,291 --> 01:31:02,570
door and he just walked over and looked 
at it,

1910
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:07,840
it would catch you in its bell would 
cross the street.

1911
01:31:09,191 --> 01:31:11,420
It's just rack it.
Jesus Christ.

1912
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:13,520
Why is your car after be so loud?
Yeah,

1913
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:15,050
but if you're right next to it,
you're like,

1914
01:31:15,051 --> 01:31:18,110
wow,
1969 and you'll start walking around.

1915
01:31:18,111 --> 01:31:21,020
It's pretty bad,
so it's beautiful.

1916
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:22,753
It's not.
You can't make a car like that today 

1917
01:31:24,171 --> 01:31:26,210
because it's not even remotely 
aerodynamic.

1918
01:31:27,380 --> 01:31:29,510
Hammock.
Fuel efficient.

1919
01:31:29,511 --> 01:31:32,240
It's not safe.
There's a pitiful man.

1920
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:33,103
They nailed it.
They hit the sweet spot in art and 

1921
01:31:35,391 --> 01:31:36,224
engineering.
That is the one part of the American 

1922
01:31:38,271 --> 01:31:40,160
experience.
Recklessness.

1923
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:45,200
That's what drives everything that there
is that element of balls to the wall.

1924
01:31:45,201 --> 01:31:46,034
Let's see what happens.
Let's discover and you could get good 

1925
01:31:47,721 --> 01:31:48,680
things out of it.
Right?

1926
01:31:48,681 --> 01:31:53,090
But imagine this,
imagine something that's far inferior to

1927
01:31:53,091 --> 01:31:53,924
the modern alternative but makes you 
feel in a way the modern alternative 

1928
01:31:58,220 --> 01:31:59,740
isn't capable.
Feeling

1929
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:05,520
like if you see in 1969,
like done up Mustang Gt.

1930
01:32:07,830 --> 01:32:08,260
What?
What?

1931
01:32:08,260 --> 01:32:11,480
What was the like the big one that year 
one.

1932
01:32:11,620 --> 01:32:14,260
Was it a mock one?
What the fuck was the 1970?

1933
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:16,540
Was it a boss?
That's what it was.

1934
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:17,733
[inaudible].
Sixty nine was like a boss and then 

1935
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:20,373
earlier than that they made those 
eleanor cars for that gone in 60 

1936
01:32:23,141 --> 01:32:24,280
seconds.
I think those were 19,

1937
01:32:24,281 --> 01:32:25,690
67,
so really not there.

1938
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:26,533
That body style,
like if you looked at one of those next 

1939
01:32:29,621 --> 01:32:34,210
to a 2018 mustang,
the 2018 mustangs look fucking great.

1940
01:32:34,330 --> 01:32:35,920
They look great.
That's it right there.

1941
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:37,090
That's a mock one.
Yeah,

1942
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:37,871
that's it.
Oh,

1943
01:32:37,871 --> 01:32:40,840
that's right.
It's John Rice dude.

1944
01:32:41,350 --> 01:32:44,200
There's a company that's making these 
now too.

1945
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:45,473
They're called classic recreation's and 
they're making these brand new versions 

1946
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:53,260
of that car they take.
They take 19,

1947
01:32:53,261 --> 01:32:57,050
69 mustangs and they rebuild them,
but they give him like real break,

1948
01:32:57,051 --> 01:33:01,870
so they stopped good modern suspension.
They make it so you can drive it around.

1949
01:33:02,500 --> 01:33:04,570
That's what I'm interested in.
That.

1950
01:33:04,571 --> 01:33:05,404
That makes sense.

1951
01:33:06,210 --> 01:33:07,043
That makes a lot of sense because 
they're just pretty mustang bad ass 

1952
01:33:11,551 --> 01:33:12,990
tires,
but that's when you at

1953
01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:15,210
that.
How beautiful is that?

1954
01:33:15,810 --> 01:33:18,180
It doesn't look like anything that you 
can buy that's modern.

1955
01:33:18,230 --> 01:33:20,730
Like there's nothing remotely close.
No.

1956
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:23,910
That's like vinyl.
They just right there.

1957
01:33:23,911 --> 01:33:26,580
They just nailed it.
Whatever the fuck they did

1958
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,110
all these years later,
we're like,

1959
01:33:29,111 --> 01:33:30,220
God damn it.
They nailed it.

1960
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:32,650
Right.
But they nailed it for,

1961
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:34,050
you know,
certain,

1962
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:39,120
a lunkhead from New Jersey that doesn't 
do that for you.

1963
01:33:39,850 --> 01:33:41,770
Yeah,
it does.

1964
01:33:42,010 --> 01:33:42,843
But I don't know.
I don't know if you don't know if young 

1965
01:33:48,281 --> 01:33:49,960
people would like that.
I don't know.

1966
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:54,610
They're like to start arresting them.
If they don't like young boys don't look

1967
01:33:54,611 --> 01:33:55,444
down Mustang and say good God credible.
If they don't do that then they should 

1968
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:02,140
probably go to jail somewhere that is 
pretty hot.

1969
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,460
That's incredibly good looking.
But it's stupid.

1970
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,750
But it's also stupid.
Wow.

1971
01:34:07,751 --> 01:34:08,584
So sir,
it's just metal right in your chest 

1972
01:34:10,721 --> 01:34:11,890
cavity.
No,

1973
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:15,520
no airbag.
You need to do more push of last just in

1974
01:34:15,521 --> 01:34:18,370
your face.
It's probably a little bit of that.

1975
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:19,793
No,
I know a chunk in a car accident and 

1976
01:34:20,831 --> 01:34:23,830
drive carefully and it's a wonderful 
thing to behold.

1977
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:24,753
Yeah.
My buddy had his bad mustang when we 

1978
01:34:26,941 --> 01:34:27,774
were in high school,
but if you saw something like that but 

1979
01:34:29,471 --> 01:34:31,030
it had airbags,
he'd be cool with it then.

1980
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:31,901
Yeah.
No,

1981
01:34:31,901 --> 01:34:32,890
I'm cool with it.
Anyway,

1982
01:34:32,891 --> 01:34:33,724
I'm just busting Paul's,
but I think it's a look at that little 

1983
01:34:35,831 --> 01:34:37,630
orange thing in the middle that looks 
closer to what?

1984
01:34:37,780 --> 01:34:40,360
I had.
A 76 Toyota Corolla.

1985
01:34:40,361 --> 01:34:41,194
Call that up.
Call up in 1976 Toyota Corolla with a 

1986
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:50,770
with a a racing stripes along the side.
Look at that bad boy.

1987
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:52,300
Look at that orange one in the second 
row.

1988
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:55,870
That was it.
I had a 1984 Honda accord.

1989
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:01,050
80 four Honda accord with stuttering 
spark.

1990
01:35:01,220 --> 01:35:03,590
That's the 79.
You need the 76.

1991
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:07,340
Those are cool little cars though.
That's.

1992
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:10,580
I could fix that car at those.
That's what I was doing the brakes on.

1993
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,800
Yeah,
it looks like one of those.

1994
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:14,570
Something like that.
It was white.

1995
01:35:15,050 --> 01:35:17,680
Nice little shitty carbon legend.
Oh,

1996
01:35:17,700 --> 01:35:21,380
it's just like this.
Oh know what man?

1997
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:25,010
Here's the thing.
Those fucking cars drive forever.

1998
01:35:25,070 --> 01:35:26,330
Yeah,
exactly.

1999
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,200
Yeah,
they are.

2000
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:30,230
It's amazing how reliable Honda's are.

2001
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:31,620
Oh yeah,
they're so insane.

2002
01:35:31,621 --> 01:35:33,630
Toyota Toyota's.
Oh my God.

2003
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:36,780
Just go forever.
Just having that crummy car.

2004
01:35:37,370 --> 01:35:39,150
It was a good thing.
But.

2005
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:41,400
So you think back to your,
uh,

2006
01:35:41,460 --> 01:35:45,840
your point of view of the,
what are these people doing here?

2007
01:35:46,230 --> 01:35:47,820
So they're building.
I liked where you were going,

2008
01:35:48,720 --> 01:35:50,200
making stuff for what,
what'd,

2009
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:51,034
because everything's electronically 
based and is this all instinct is or is 

2010
01:35:53,791 --> 01:35:54,624
it being steered by something?
We just finding our way in the dark and 

2011
01:35:58,201 --> 01:36:01,170
this is what's coming out or is there 
some plan?

2012
01:36:02,250 --> 01:36:03,810
Well,
that's a heavy question.

2013
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:06,880
It's really hard to know if there was a 
plan.

2014
01:36:07,030 --> 01:36:07,960
Yeah,
I get,

2015
01:36:08,020 --> 01:36:10,300
I get why some would be suspicious that 
there would be,

2016
01:36:10,930 --> 01:36:14,620
but if you just see the whole nature 
right,

2017
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:18,580
with the starting off of the tribal 
behavior and the invasions of the others

2018
01:36:18,581 --> 01:36:20,770
and the wars that have taken place sort 
of nonstop,

2019
01:36:20,771 --> 01:36:21,430
right?
Yeah.

2020
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:26,430
You get this hyper competitive team 
oriented thing broken into countries.

2021
01:36:27,880 --> 01:36:28,713
Well,
I think that with that and this like 

2022
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:33,790
constant competition in this constant 
and then inside your country,

2023
01:36:33,791 --> 01:36:34,624
this constant competition economically 
and everybody just striving to achieve 

2024
01:36:38,081 --> 01:36:40,600
and do better and get crazier and 
bigger.

2025
01:36:40,601 --> 01:36:41,434
And this is all leading to us just 
continuing to buy stuff like everybody 

2026
01:36:45,911 --> 01:36:50,000
that is involved in this as buying the 
newest iphone or the newest macbook,

2027
01:36:50,080 --> 01:36:52,590
the newest,
this news.xbox.

2028
01:36:52,610 --> 01:36:56,370
Fucking.
How many x boxes have been now for?

2029
01:36:56,900 --> 01:36:57,790
Let's just say four.

2030
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:58,660
Four.
Yeah.

2031
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:00,080
Yeah.
Going to keep going,

2032
01:37:00,240 --> 01:37:02,140
keep going.
They're going to go xbox five.

2033
01:37:02,141 --> 01:37:03,430
They're going to.
They're going to keep going.

2034
01:37:03,460 --> 01:37:05,320
It's what everybody does.
They want better shit.

2035
01:37:05,321 --> 01:37:06,430
You Want Vr?
We want.

2036
01:37:06,490 --> 01:37:09,460
I will not hyper realistic Vr.
I want vr with no gear.

2037
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:10,593
I want you to be able to give me a pill 
and that pill releases a bunch of 

2038
01:37:13,181 --> 01:37:16,350
nanobots that go through my circulatory 
system and find my,

2039
01:37:16,380 --> 01:37:19,210
my brain and juice it up.
But some artificial memory.

2040
01:37:19,560 --> 01:37:21,380
I mean that's what I want.
And I share them out later.

2041
01:37:21,780 --> 01:37:24,590
Like buck shots and right clink.
Yeah,

2042
01:37:25,420 --> 01:37:27,010
kidney stones.
You Shit it out.

2043
01:37:27,011 --> 01:37:30,190
Like buckshot like little babies coming 
out in your poop.

2044
01:37:30,430 --> 01:37:32,120
This is mean.
Look,

2045
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:36,440
beings always try to find safety,
right?

2046
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:37,820
That's what they want more than 
anything.

2047
01:37:37,821 --> 01:37:39,260
They don't want to get killed.
They want to.

2048
01:37:39,350 --> 01:37:41,780
They want to be safe and exist,
eat whatever,

2049
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:44,030
but they just want to be.
They want that safety,

2050
01:37:44,031 --> 01:37:44,864
so maybe our safety is going to come 
when we're out of the woods were out of 

2051
01:37:47,361 --> 01:37:52,361
the wild where out of the 20th century 
and we're just these insular things that

2052
01:37:52,521 --> 01:37:56,040
never have to go out and about and 
forever and

2053
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,873
just be [inaudible] could be.
Maybe that's what all this push of 

2054
01:38:00,151 --> 01:38:02,100
technology is,
is aiming towards.

2055
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,900
Yeah.
It could be right.

2056
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:07,620
Just to protect ourselves in these 
little cocoons and and be.

2057
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:10,043
Yeah.
I mean if the ultimate threats always 

2058
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:13,270
violence and war,
right.

2059
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:14,333
That's the ultimate threat to the 
organism and the organism can commit 

2060
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:20,520
violence and war against each other,
which is why we make doors and gates and

2061
01:38:20,970 --> 01:38:23,010
stuff to keep those things at bay.
Yup.

2062
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:24,233
Yeah,
but it's the most fascinating things 

2063
01:38:27,391 --> 01:38:29,310
that people don't address.
Like what would,

2064
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:33,480
what would cause a person to snap?
There's no real concrete,

2065
01:38:35,310 --> 01:38:36,143
no concrete answer.
What do you think is the difference 

2066
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:41,513
between,
and I'm asking this honestly killing 

2067
01:38:45,690 --> 01:38:48,450
when you're hunting and killing a human 
being.

2068
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:51,470
I think it would be a giant difference 
terms of where you fell.

2069
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:53,070
Yeah.
How could you articulate it though?

2070
01:38:53,370 --> 01:38:53,940
I don't know.

2071
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:56,510
I've never killed a human being,
but I would,

2072
01:38:56,550 --> 01:38:58,640
I would imagine that it would be,
um,

2073
01:38:58,820 --> 01:39:03,510
I mean it would have to be some horrific
situation where you're battling for your

2074
01:39:03,511 --> 01:39:06,150
life,
which people do that.

2075
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:07,630
It does happen,
you know,

2076
01:39:07,730 --> 01:39:12,730
we were all aware of it.
The worst possible scenario we would all

2077
01:39:12,781 --> 01:39:13,614
like to think that everybody that we 
meet that's of sound mind should be our 

2078
01:39:18,931 --> 01:39:19,764
brothers and sisters.
I mean we should all get along whether 

2079
01:39:22,531 --> 01:39:23,364
you agree or disagree about certain 
political issues or certain social 

2080
01:39:27,241 --> 01:39:28,074
issues,
like we should be able to talk through 

2081
01:39:28,951 --> 01:39:29,784
that as a community.
But like always hold at the top that 

2082
01:39:33,181 --> 01:39:36,690
we're all in this together and if I 
think that's possible,

2083
01:39:36,720 --> 01:39:37,553
I think that's possible and I think we 
could still satisfy this fucked up 

2084
01:39:40,591 --> 01:39:42,690
desire that we have to constantly 
compete.

2085
01:39:43,200 --> 01:39:44,033
We can temper that with what I think is 
the most important thing is finding 

2086
01:39:47,581 --> 01:39:50,640
something that you're passionate at 
because I think you and I are really,

2087
01:39:50,641 --> 01:39:54,120
really lucky that we found stand up and 
through stand up.

2088
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:54,953
We found this thing that we're 
passionate at and we have a good time 

2089
01:39:56,970 --> 01:39:59,700
and we have fun.
Some people don't have that,

2090
01:40:00,090 --> 01:40:00,923
so like if I.
If you were offered a job as a 

2091
01:40:03,610 --> 01:40:06,480
stockbroker and this is a guaranteed 
job,

2092
01:40:06,481 --> 01:40:08,580
you have a guaranteed contract for the 
next 20 years,

2093
01:40:08,581 --> 01:40:10,770
you're going to make five times as much 
as you make doing stand up.

2094
01:40:10,771 --> 01:40:13,620
You can't do standup anymore.
He would never take that.

2095
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:14,923
You'd be like,
wow.

2096
01:40:15,570 --> 01:40:18,570
So even though you're a guy who does 
well,

2097
01:40:18,571 --> 01:40:19,404
you're not a business person.
You're a guy following your passion and 

2098
01:40:22,231 --> 01:40:25,050
it's allowed you to live a nice life,
but that doesn't.

2099
01:40:25,350 --> 01:40:26,183
It's not the same as a lot of people 
with a lot of people are doing is just 

2100
01:40:29,701 --> 01:40:30,534
chasing the money so the,
the passion doesn't exist and they can 

2101
01:40:33,031 --> 01:40:36,630
manufacture that passion.
When it comes to like some desire to see

2102
01:40:36,631 --> 01:40:37,464
their,
their team kick ass because their 

2103
01:40:39,241 --> 01:40:40,530
companies,
number one,

2104
01:40:41,530 --> 01:40:42,363
it could be,
could be really that they are into 

2105
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:46,010
succeeding in the business world and 
that's their passion.

2106
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:47,700
They liked a lot of people that like 
that,

2107
01:40:48,210 --> 01:40:49,043
but it's not the same as a guy like 
David Cho who's like a professional 

2108
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:55,360
artist who's making.
He's.

2109
01:40:55,420 --> 01:40:58,720
He just follows his passion.
He does what he wants.

2110
01:40:58,900 --> 01:41:02,590
There's a different kind of achievement.
There's a feeling that he has the way he

2111
01:41:02,591 --> 01:41:03,424
interfaces with what he does for a 
living that's different than what a lot 

2112
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:07,024
of people do.
So I would imagine that artists would 

2113
01:41:08,591 --> 01:41:09,424
probably be less inclined to go crazy 
and spend all their money on stuff and 

2114
01:41:13,571 --> 01:41:14,404
buy things that make them look better or
make them feel better about the fact 

2115
01:41:17,201 --> 01:41:19,370
that they work because they're not 
trying to fill a hole that.

2116
01:41:19,770 --> 01:41:20,950
Right.
But if you're just,

2117
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:24,460
you have a job for a company that you 
don't really give a fuck about.

2118
01:41:24,461 --> 01:41:26,950
You don't really give a fuck about 
styrofoam coolers.

2119
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:28,263
You know,
you really don't give a fuck about 

2120
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:29,900
fucking,
you know,

2121
01:41:30,010 --> 01:41:33,030
those rubber bands that people buy when 
they have causes.

2122
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,900
You don't give a fuck about this 
company,

2123
01:41:34,901 --> 01:41:37,070
right?
You're just a fucking guy who does it.

2124
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:38,800
Your Business and you're there at,
okay,

2125
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:39,201
well,
well,

2126
01:41:39,201 --> 01:41:40,034
you know,
we can give them to you for 1796 if we 

2127
01:41:41,291 --> 01:41:44,010
can work this through Bob.
We're talking about a thousand bucks.

2128
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:46,440
Want to be there?
Like,

2129
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:47,283
I want to be fishing.
The guy wants to be doing something 

2130
01:41:49,121 --> 01:41:49,954
else.
Yeah,

2131
01:41:50,080 --> 01:41:51,060
you don't.
You,

2132
01:41:51,061 --> 01:41:54,190
you're insanely fortunate that you don't
have that in your life.

2133
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:54,650
No,

2134
01:41:54,650 --> 01:41:57,530
but I think,
I don't think those people look.

2135
01:41:57,800 --> 01:41:59,990
A lot of people have jobs that they're 
not into,

2136
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,770
but the reason we're lucky is that our 
job is our passion.

2137
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:06,740
A lot of people have the job that 
they're maybe not into,

2138
01:42:07,070 --> 01:42:09,620
but they love this other stuff that they
do.

2139
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:14,660
They love being with their family and 
keep teaching soccer or they love skiing

2140
01:42:14,661 --> 01:42:16,790
or whatever.
Their passion is something else.

2141
01:42:17,070 --> 01:42:20,540
It like.
We're lucky that our passion is our work

2142
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,480
to combine those things.
That is a very,

2143
01:42:23,780 --> 01:42:24,710
very unique thing.

2144
01:42:24,820 --> 01:42:25,653
It's the most insanely lucky thing ever,
but I think that for people that are 

2145
01:42:30,101 --> 01:42:32,980
like hyper competitive,
that don't find a thing that they really

2146
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:34,690
love,
then it really,

2147
01:42:34,720 --> 01:42:38,890
for many of them becomes about pursuing 
the best stuff.

2148
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,170
Yeah,
and you.

2149
01:42:40,270 --> 01:42:45,270
This is what fuels so many people for 
like these status symbols or like if you

2150
01:42:45,431 --> 01:42:46,264
have an iphone eight,
if a kid sees you with an iphone eight 

2151
01:42:48,641 --> 01:42:52,740
and they got an iphone 10 period,
you weird.

2152
01:42:53,050 --> 01:42:55,270
They can basically do the exact same 
thing.

2153
01:42:56,120 --> 01:42:59,050
Has a fucking killer camera.
Iphone eight,

2154
01:42:59,051 --> 01:43:02,840
you know,
with the battery's pretty similar to our

2155
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:06,670
tiny amy,
but for status seeking people,

2156
01:43:06,950 --> 01:43:09,040
it's very important that you have the 
latest stuff.

2157
01:43:09,041 --> 01:43:09,874
Like you can't be walking around with,
like David tells the other day with an 

2158
01:43:11,531 --> 01:43:15,820
iphone to burst out laughing 
immediately.

2159
01:43:16,060 --> 01:43:17,650
He got on.
Twitter is hilarious.

2160
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:19,710
You know,
there's nothing about a tell.

2161
01:43:19,710 --> 01:43:21,690
It is a searching for status.
None.

2162
01:43:22,280 --> 01:43:22,810
No.
He's like,

2163
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:24,670
I was saying that.
He's like a monk you that way.

2164
01:43:24,790 --> 01:43:25,740
He is.
Yeah,

2165
01:43:26,090 --> 01:43:27,520
you're right.
He's smart.

2166
01:43:28,170 --> 01:43:29,620
He's very smart,
brilliant guy.

2167
01:43:29,621 --> 01:43:30,454
He knows.
He knows what's healthy for them and 

2168
01:43:31,601 --> 01:43:33,970
what's not.
So other than the cigarettes.

2169
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,300
Yeah.
He put all his other stuff.

2170
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:38,233
He stopped drinking and didn't know.
He cleaned himself up really well and 

2171
01:43:41,380 --> 01:43:43,660
the cigarettes and the only vice.
He has cigarettes and coffee.

2172
01:43:43,661 --> 01:43:45,680
He was saying that's his vice.
He's a.

2173
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:47,810
he's a poet amongst us.
Like he's.

2174
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:51,010
He's somebody that he's special.
He really.

2175
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:52,100
And he's a really good

2176
01:43:52,100 --> 01:43:52,911
guy.
Yeah.

2177
01:43:52,911 --> 01:43:53,744
Now he's so kind.
He's so kind of just being around his 

2178
01:43:56,931 --> 01:43:59,840
orbit.
I love New York.

2179
01:44:00,340 --> 01:44:02,000
I love the two of them together.
Yeah.

2180
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:02,834
No,
it's really.

2181
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:05,750
It's so funny.
I never would have seen that coming when

2182
01:44:05,751 --> 01:44:07,670
I was,
when we were all young in New York.

2183
01:44:07,700 --> 01:44:08,180
I know,
right.

2184
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:10,430
I never would have saw those two.
Yeah,

2185
01:44:10,431 --> 01:44:11,241
right.
Doing it.

2186
01:44:11,241 --> 01:44:13,310
I don't know what.
Not for any real reason,

2187
01:44:13,311 --> 01:44:14,144
but it just never saw them intersecting.
I never would've saw any of us doing 

2188
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:18,630
something like that.
Yeah.

2189
01:44:18,860 --> 01:44:23,000
You doing live shows together.
Great idea.

2190
01:44:23,030 --> 01:44:25,130
It is a great idea.
Like some of those shows.

2191
01:44:25,131 --> 01:44:27,290
You see those pictures for the comedy 
cellar?

2192
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:28,700
Yeah,
like 1:00

2193
01:44:28,701 --> 01:44:31,010
in the morning.
Like Dave Chappelle's onstage with Chris

2194
01:44:31,010 --> 01:44:32,060
Rock and fucking around,
you know,

2195
01:44:32,061 --> 01:44:34,210
there's always like three guys on stage.
That's crazy.

2196
01:44:34,211 --> 01:44:35,044
I know.
Never,

2197
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:37,940
I never understand that either.
But being around it's hell.

2198
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:39,103
Like watching him all through the years.
He would always surprise you like when 

2199
01:44:42,441 --> 01:44:44,750
someone's father died or something,
have a towel.

2200
01:44:44,751 --> 01:44:47,990
Was always front and center,
like helping out,

2201
01:44:48,020 --> 01:44:48,853
giving people money.
Like there's this kindness to them 

2202
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:51,560
gentlemen.
Con Guy.

2203
01:44:51,620 --> 01:44:52,453
Yeah.
And another force of good real force of 

2204
01:44:55,191 --> 01:44:57,080
good.
And a guy who uh,

2205
01:44:57,120 --> 01:45:01,490
like comics should really appreciate,
like if you're a fan of the art form,

2206
01:45:01,491 --> 01:45:02,324
like David tells really someone to 
appreciate it because was always 

2207
01:45:04,881 --> 01:45:06,270
creative.
It's,

2208
01:45:06,310 --> 01:45:11,310
it's like it's never do she always 
skanks for the memories as one of my all

2209
01:45:12,501 --> 01:45:15,350
time favorite.
That shit is hilarious.

2210
01:45:15,620 --> 01:45:18,440
That is so funny.
Is a hilarious cd man.

2211
01:45:18,620 --> 01:45:20,650
I think he did that in Denver,
you know?

2212
01:45:20,670 --> 01:45:22,100
Yeah.
He did that at the comedy works.

2213
01:45:22,130 --> 01:45:23,160
Oh yeah.
Wendy's put.

2214
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:24,020
Oh,
very cool.

2215
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:26,700
Yeah,
that's very cool.

2216
01:45:28,630 --> 01:45:30,290
Yeah.
That fucking in Denver,

2217
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:31,640
that CDs brilliant.

2218
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,800
Yeah.
He's amazing.

2219
01:45:34,190 --> 01:45:35,900
He's so good.
Yeah.

2220
01:45:35,901 --> 01:45:37,580
I mean to answer what you're saying.
Yeah,

2221
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:38,414
your face here and it's so silly.
I think that was when he was doing 

2222
01:45:45,111 --> 01:45:46,400
insomnia too,
right?

2223
01:45:46,740 --> 01:45:49,040
Yeah.
That was the partying days.

2224
01:45:49,190 --> 01:45:51,530
Yeah.
He says he's just such a smart guy.

2225
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,260
Like he just decided one point,
hey,

2226
01:45:54,261 --> 01:45:58,340
this is fucking me up.
No more drinking to no more drinking,

2227
01:45:58,341 --> 01:46:01,250
no more show.
You're not going to do this thing.

2228
01:46:01,251 --> 01:46:05,900
That's attracting negativity to my shows
and setting me up as a guy.

2229
01:46:05,901 --> 01:46:07,980
It's going.
Drank himself into oblivion.

2230
01:46:08,210 --> 01:46:09,910
Know he was smart.
He pulled the uh,

2231
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:11,290
pull the cord.
Yeah,

2232
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:11,931
those,
those.

2233
01:46:11,931 --> 01:46:13,400
You're,
you're the party guy.

2234
01:46:13,460 --> 01:46:17,240
You're the life of the party guy.
It's hard to sit back down.

2235
01:46:17,330 --> 01:46:18,490
Yeah.
What the fuck?

2236
01:46:18,730 --> 01:46:22,250
What's Zen game?
Or it talked to Ron White.

2237
01:46:22,280 --> 01:46:23,113
He's,
he's doing it with us and Ron White on 

2238
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:24,970
white.

2239
01:46:24,970 --> 01:46:25,803
Stop faking.
I'll tell you exactly what Ron White's 

2240
01:46:26,841 --> 01:46:28,700
doing.
He's riding a fucking boat.

2241
01:46:28,701 --> 01:46:32,780
Riding into the rock is.
He doesn't give a fuck and he's doing it

2242
01:46:32,781 --> 01:46:35,050
with a Tequila company.
Cheers.

2243
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:37,580
Happy holidays.
Cheers.

2244
01:46:37,581 --> 01:46:39,950
My friend,
I set up my train under my tree.

2245
01:46:41,300 --> 01:46:44,990
Knew what does it numero won is that is 
a Tequila company.

2246
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:50,570
I just said I set my train up under my 
tree and you still chose onto Keelan.

2247
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:55,070
Did you have photos or videos of this 
train on your tree?

2248
01:46:56,010 --> 01:46:57,810
I think I didn't put anything on the 
instagram.

2249
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:02,430
Probably wouldn't be real if it wasn't.
It's hard stuff in your life.

2250
01:47:02,490 --> 01:47:03,323
My kids are getting older.
There's like 16 and 13 and they were at 

2251
01:47:06,961 --> 01:47:07,794
school and I'm setting up the village 
under the tree and the train tracks and 

2252
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:11,514
all the people like shopping around the 
village and that was doing it on my own 

2253
01:47:15,121 --> 01:47:18,450
because they don't have time to really 
do it and I was like,

2254
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:19,613
this is how people become the guy in the
neighborhood is like bringing your 

2255
01:47:22,561 --> 01:47:25,890
children around.
Look at my train set because your family

2256
01:47:25,891 --> 01:47:28,650
leaves and you're like,
are there any children around?

2257
01:47:28,750 --> 01:47:33,060
They want to look at my train set.
I could totally see myself doing that at

2258
01:47:33,061 --> 01:47:34,920
some point.
Totally.

2259
01:47:35,260 --> 01:47:36,093
Well there's those dudes that they go 
wall close encounters of the third kind 

2260
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:42,030
make that giant one in the middle of the
living room.

2261
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,330
You're funny reference.
Yeah,

2262
01:47:46,331 --> 01:47:49,490
because they had the plywood number,
horse,

2263
01:47:49,770 --> 01:47:54,770
like the extra in the middle of his 
house.

2264
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:57,130
His wife divorced him.
Yeah.

2265
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,051
That guy.
Yeah.

2266
01:47:58,051 --> 01:48:00,670
You make a train around that.
It's not that far from that.

2267
01:48:03,440 --> 01:48:06,060
I can't remember his name.
Richard Dreyfus course.

2268
01:48:06,061 --> 01:48:08,010
Jesus Christ.
Richard Dreyfus.

2269
01:48:08,110 --> 01:48:09,510
A great movie.
Well,

2270
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:11,550
Daca,
he's been great in so many things.

2271
01:48:12,100 --> 01:48:14,220
Always.
The unassuming guy.

2272
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:15,930
Jaws.
Yeah,

2273
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:18,560
man,
he was.

2274
01:48:18,630 --> 01:48:22,440
He was Spielberg's alter ego.
Really be so good.

2275
01:48:22,441 --> 01:48:23,930
Yeah.
He's so good in everything.

2276
01:48:23,940 --> 01:48:26,460
He looks so young.
There was man,

2277
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:27,420
man.
Oh Man.

2278
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:31,530
What a fucking movie this was because I 
wanted to believe so bad.

2279
01:48:31,590 --> 01:48:34,890
Oh yeah.
I so wanted to believe they got me.

2280
01:48:35,070 --> 01:48:36,590
Hey,
did you talk about that Berg?

2281
01:48:36,690 --> 01:48:39,330
Did you talk about that alien craft that
came into her?

2282
01:48:40,110 --> 01:48:44,040
What happened to our galaxy?
It did very well with the Hawaiian name.

2283
01:48:44,070 --> 01:48:44,903
Oh,
so it's over.

2284
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:47,280
You didn't hear about that one.
The one that looks like a joint.

2285
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:50,620
Yeah,
because we're a big piece of poop that a

2286
01:48:51,170 --> 01:48:53,430
big duty copter.
It's just a weird rock.

2287
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:56,130
I think now they said that,
uh,

2288
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:56,993
some like legit people said that it 
changed speed and went in different 

2289
01:49:00,271 --> 01:49:01,180
directions.
People,

2290
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:03,510
legit people.
Scientists.

2291
01:49:03,570 --> 01:49:06,060
Oh,
them guys said that it was a,

2292
01:49:06,630 --> 01:49:08,730
it could be something.
Could be.

2293
01:49:10,200 --> 01:49:13,710
What does Neil Degrassi say about it?
He's not talking right now.

2294
01:49:15,780 --> 01:49:18,000
I'm a little bit of a kerfuffle.
Kerfuffle.

2295
01:49:18,540 --> 01:49:22,370
What's his gym?
Harvard scientists say aliens.

2296
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:25,410
Makes Bizarre.
Interstellar object.

2297
01:49:25,710 --> 01:49:26,790
Yeah.
I saw that.

2298
01:49:26,791 --> 01:49:29,570
And then I saw someone refuting 
scientists.

2299
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:32,040
Harvard.
No one wants to believe more than me,

2300
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:33,890
bro.
Come on Joe.

2301
01:49:33,891 --> 01:49:34,800
It's real.
Well,

2302
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:37,830
if I was going to mask my spaceship to 
fly through the galaxy,

2303
01:49:37,831 --> 01:49:39,450
I would definitely make it look like a 
big rock.

2304
01:49:40,010 --> 01:49:41,340
Big Asteroid.
Right?

2305
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:45,090
Why wouldn't you driving through space?
May.

2306
01:49:45,230 --> 01:49:46,440
Maybe what they were like,
look,

2307
01:49:46,441 --> 01:49:47,950
if we just make this thing

2308
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:52,170
drive by them and don't change speeds,
they'll have no idea.

2309
01:49:52,230 --> 01:49:54,550
Just destroyed.
There'll be psyched that we missed them.

2310
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:55,793
Okay.
Good call.

2311
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:58,750
Good call.
Someone just hits the gas.

2312
01:49:58,751 --> 01:50:01,840
I'm tired.
I don't want to fucking taking too long.

2313
01:50:04,290 --> 01:50:07,780
You got the fucking cops are behind.
Is Dave Shit.

2314
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:08,830
Goddammit.
Dave.

2315
01:50:08,831 --> 01:50:11,440
You're not supposed to.
Just take all told you 65.

2316
01:50:11,550 --> 01:50:12,383
Fuck,
let's start throwing this weed out the 

2317
01:50:14,561 --> 01:50:15,394
window.
Why would it be so hard to believe a 

2318
01:50:17,230 --> 01:50:20,170
space rock traveling through space?
That would be the move,

2319
01:50:20,171 --> 01:50:20,831
right?
I mean,

2320
01:50:20,831 --> 01:50:23,530
if they're so advanced they can travel 
through galaxies.

2321
01:50:23,531 --> 01:50:25,660
They can make this shit look like 
anything they want it to.

2322
01:50:25,890 --> 01:50:29,590
Why wouldn't you doll it up?
Radiation pressure.

2323
01:50:29,650 --> 01:50:32,020
The only thing celebrating floors would 
be.

2324
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:34,420
Well,
there's no air and space,

2325
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:37,090
right?
So it wouldn't be aerodynamics.

2326
01:50:37,091 --> 01:50:38,140
What would it be?
Momentum.

2327
01:50:38,260 --> 01:50:39,400
No,
go down a little bit.

2328
01:50:39,590 --> 01:50:40,423
I think it answers your question.
If radiation pressure is the 

2329
01:50:42,311 --> 01:50:43,144
accelerating forest,
then own moma represents a new class of 

2330
01:50:48,431 --> 01:50:51,250
thin interstellar material.
Whoa.

2331
01:50:51,490 --> 01:50:53,680
It has a different thing that it's using
for energy.

2332
01:50:54,910 --> 01:50:58,990
But as to what may have produced this 
previously unseen material,

2333
01:50:58,991 --> 01:50:59,824
it could have emerged naturally from the
debris of the planet forming disc in a 

2334
01:51:02,831 --> 01:51:06,070
distant solar system going through yet 
an unknown process.

2335
01:51:06,820 --> 01:51:07,653
They've got a whole nother way to make.
We went from Toyota Corollas to this 

2336
01:51:10,211 --> 01:51:11,044
thing.

2337
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,590
Imagine if that's what we find.
The only thing though,

2338
01:51:15,650 --> 01:51:16,910
that's what it does.
The,

2339
01:51:16,911 --> 01:51:17,520
um,
the,

2340
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:18,353
like a rock a rock is not smooth,
but it doesn't necessarily need this 

2341
01:51:21,471 --> 01:51:22,304
where I'm stupid.
This is one of many places where I'm 

2342
01:51:25,371 --> 01:51:26,204
stupid,
but it doesn't necessarily need to be 

2343
01:51:27,531 --> 01:51:28,460
aerodynamic.
Right,

2344
01:51:28,461 --> 01:51:31,160
because it's not going through air.
The vacuum of space.

2345
01:51:31,190 --> 01:51:32,450
Right?
Exactly.

2346
01:51:32,510 --> 01:51:35,270
So I'm not wrong there.
It could actually look like a rock.

2347
01:51:35,360 --> 01:51:36,193
It comes.
The only issue would be getting it into 

2348
01:51:37,101 --> 01:51:37,791
space.
Right?

2349
01:51:37,791 --> 01:51:38,624
The aerodynamics.
Assuming that you shooting it from a 

2350
01:51:40,701 --> 01:51:42,890
planet with an atmosphere.
Again,

2351
01:51:42,920 --> 01:51:45,230
gravity not be talking about this way 
too stupid.

2352
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:48,733
If you shot,
if you're launching it from Earth into 

2353
01:51:51,111 --> 01:51:51,621
space,
right?

2354
01:51:51,621 --> 01:51:52,454
Yeah.
What if you had it encased in like this 

2355
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,400
outer area?
Sort of like the space shuttle is,

2356
01:51:58,820 --> 01:51:59,653
but then once you get to a place you 
could jettison the outside of it just 

2357
01:52:02,901 --> 01:52:05,540
like they get rid of those booster 
rockets,

2358
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:08,210
they just fall into the bucket,
integrate land on people,

2359
01:52:08,211 --> 01:52:13,211
whether fishing.
That has to happen.

2360
01:52:13,450 --> 01:52:14,283
Right.
Getting killed by a booster rocket flat 

2361
01:52:15,870 --> 01:52:18,810
space that you in the face.
I didn't integrate,

2362
01:52:19,550 --> 01:52:20,383
but then they could do that.
They could release the shell and then 

2363
01:52:22,161 --> 01:52:22,994
they would just have the rock and the 
rock would move through space and it 

2364
01:52:25,371 --> 01:52:27,430
didn't matter what shape it was because 
it's in the vacuum

2365
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,440
or just get it up into orbit,
orbit the space station.

2366
01:52:31,441 --> 01:52:34,500
Go and build it in pieces and then 
launch it for sure.

2367
01:52:34,870 --> 01:52:35,703
Do you remember when that commander,
Chris Hadfield gentleman was on the 

2368
01:52:38,171 --> 01:52:39,004
podcast and he was talking about some 
kind of magnet that they have that 

2369
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:45,220
collects subatomic

2370
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:47,143
out there in the galaxy and that we only
know five percent of what the universe 

2371
01:52:50,841 --> 01:52:52,220
is made out of.
Oh my God.

2372
01:52:52,290 --> 01:52:55,010
Talking about things like dark matter 
and he was five percent.

2373
01:52:55,011 --> 01:52:55,844
It's the guys scientists space,
a real legit astronaut coming back from 

2374
01:52:59,930 --> 01:53:04,280
six months in space or whatever the fuck
he was there for and telling us this.

2375
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,143
Really,
wow what we've talked about that like 

2376
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:11,240
you can hang with those guys for a 
little while and then you're like,

2377
01:53:11,241 --> 01:53:14,010
I don't understand what's happening now.
It's also the.

2378
01:53:14,450 --> 01:53:16,520
I mean,
it's amazing what we do know,

2379
01:53:16,610 --> 01:53:17,443
amazing that they can send a guy to 
space and have them fly around the ISS 

2380
01:53:20,931 --> 01:53:21,711
or.
Yeah,

2381
01:53:21,711 --> 01:53:22,544
I mean we'll talk about what you were 
saying about why are we here and what 

2382
01:53:25,281 --> 01:53:27,920
are we doing like we haven't developed 
yet.

2383
01:53:27,980 --> 01:53:32,540
Something that you can go the speed of 
light we haven't,

2384
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:35,660
but if we do then the whole universe is 
open to us.

2385
01:53:36,050 --> 01:53:36,883
Maybe that's what it is.
Maybe the struggle of developing all 

2386
01:53:38,631 --> 01:53:42,320
this stuff is to get to a scientific 
level where we can really go.

2387
01:53:42,500 --> 01:53:45,380
I don't think they think the speed of 
light is even good enough.

2388
01:53:45,500 --> 01:53:46,420
Really?
Yeah.

2389
01:53:46,450 --> 01:53:47,320
I think,
dammit,

2390
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:48,163
that was my goal.
I think that like if you wanted to have 

2391
01:53:53,120 --> 01:53:56,240
options available as to what planet 
you're gonna colonize,

2392
01:53:56,770 --> 01:53:59,210
you gotta have to.
Who knows what?

2393
01:53:59,211 --> 01:54:00,044
If you land on a planet,
what did he land on a planet and it's 

2394
01:54:02,271 --> 01:54:02,631
like,
Hey,

2395
01:54:02,631 --> 01:54:04,460
it's 74 degrees out guys.
Guys,

2396
01:54:04,700 --> 01:54:07,070
it's all oxygen and nitrogen.
It's just like earth.

2397
01:54:07,250 --> 01:54:08,480
Come on out here.
Come on out here.

2398
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:13,430
But it's only been like that for 10 
years and then cycle is really fucked up

2399
01:54:13,431 --> 01:54:16,670
like 30 years from now.
It's going to be a nice age.

2400
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:17,783
It will be for all the people have moved
there and they're going to freeze to 

2401
01:54:19,581 --> 01:54:20,980
death is going to be no food at all.

2402
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:22,143
Planet doesn't give a fuck.
Like that's all our science led us to 

2403
01:54:25,851 --> 01:54:28,100
that I don't even know if we can 
predict.

2404
01:54:28,520 --> 01:54:29,353
Here's my question.
Can they accurately predict the 

2405
01:54:32,721 --> 01:54:33,554
atmosphere and the conditions and what 
the temperature would be if a planet is 

2406
01:54:37,341 --> 01:54:38,174
from a son,
like did they have a calculation where 

2407
01:54:39,381 --> 01:54:40,214
they say,
oh this sun is this amount of big and 

2408
01:54:42,291 --> 01:54:43,124
this planet is this far away.
So it's definitely going to stay within 

2409
01:54:45,381 --> 01:54:47,660
a certain temperature range for the 
entire time that the planet.

2410
01:54:47,690 --> 01:54:50,240
Did they know that like within like a 
death range?

2411
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:55,040
I think they must.
Death range is 40 degrees bro.

2412
01:54:55,470 --> 01:54:56,690
Yeah.
You get to 140.

2413
01:54:56,691 --> 01:54:57,311
That's a wrap.
Yeah.

2414
01:54:57,311 --> 01:54:58,190
You're done.
Yeah.

2415
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:00,860
So like $100.
One hundred 40.

2416
01:55:00,861 --> 01:55:02,450
Everyone's dead,
right?

2417
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:04,940
You live in a sauna,
you're going to run out of water.

2418
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:06,440
I just don't think we're going to make 
it.

2419
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:07,443
We're not,
we're definitely not figuring it out 

2420
01:55:09,470 --> 01:55:13,040
because we're saying this amount of big,
we're not even helping.

2421
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:16,970
We're confusing the pro,
but seriously think about that just as a

2422
01:55:16,971 --> 01:55:19,190
concept.
Like maybe that is it.

2423
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:22,590
Maybe it's baby all this like you keep 
thinking,

2424
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:23,543
you know,
you talked a lot about all the robots 

2425
01:55:24,741 --> 01:55:26,000
and the things that are moving us 
forward,

2426
01:55:26,001 --> 01:55:26,781
but why?
But why?

2427
01:55:26,781 --> 01:55:29,690
But why?
And I had the cocoon theory before,

2428
01:55:29,691 --> 01:55:33,080
but maybe that's not it.
Maybe it's so we can really go.

2429
01:55:33,140 --> 01:55:33,973
Yeah.
I've had the cocoon theory for quite a 

2430
01:55:35,171 --> 01:55:36,004
while where I think that we are like 
some sort of an electronic caterpillar 

2431
01:55:41,540 --> 01:55:43,950
that's building some cocoon

2432
01:55:44,070 --> 01:55:46,670
and then a butterfly is going to emerge 
because when,

2433
01:55:47,170 --> 01:55:49,950
when as a collective like will all be 
part of this.

2434
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:55,140
I mean just the innovation and the 
computers and the Ai and our integration

2435
01:55:55,141 --> 01:55:55,974
with them that eventually it's just 
going to get smarter and crazier and 

2436
01:55:57,991 --> 01:56:01,770
weirder.
I mean it's only a matter of time before

2437
01:56:01,771 --> 01:56:04,110
they make something that resembles a 
person.

2438
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:09,930
It sounds to a insular.
No,

2439
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:13,800
it sounds too insular that it would just
be for us to stay here on earth.

2440
01:56:14,280 --> 01:56:15,113
The universe is so vast that there may.
I think it's more likely that we're 

2441
01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:24,240
going to go out of this.
That's a very good idea.

2442
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:26,850
This is the sense.
It's kind of a sewer.

2443
01:56:26,900 --> 01:56:27,840
Oh,
but is it though?

2444
01:56:27,841 --> 01:56:28,770
It's amazing.
Well,

2445
01:56:28,771 --> 01:56:29,840
it's beautiful.
There's parts that.

2446
01:56:29,850 --> 01:56:30,301
Come on,
man.

2447
01:56:30,301 --> 01:56:31,134
We have a lovely life.
You ever been to Utah to skip or you 

2448
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:35,660
look at the stars or look at the 
beautiful,

2449
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:38,280
beautiful clouds in the sky on a day 
like today.

2450
01:56:38,340 --> 01:56:40,610
Oh my lovely.
You go outside.

2451
01:56:40,630 --> 01:56:41,463
This clouds float around,
just gives you a just right amount of 

2452
01:56:43,141 --> 01:56:45,740
sun.
A little bit of contrast is the best.

2453
01:56:45,750 --> 01:56:46,980
Lovely.
Like why would,

2454
01:56:47,010 --> 01:56:47,843
how could you say this is a sewer?
Because so many parts that are 

2455
01:56:50,221 --> 01:56:54,150
disgusting.
There's so many parts,

2456
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:55,560
not,
not,

2457
01:56:55,560 --> 01:57:00,180
not so many parts because we still have 
this evil,

2458
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:01,103
this other stuff that's clog at each 
other and knocking each other and it's 

2459
01:57:03,511 --> 01:57:04,740
still filled with.
Right,

2460
01:57:04,741 --> 01:57:06,510
but a murder.
Not right here.

2461
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:09,690
Not right here.
It's only in certain spots.

2462
01:57:09,720 --> 01:57:10,553
So this is the other thing that we tend 
to do because we have 7 billion people 

2463
01:57:13,801 --> 01:57:16,300
on the planet and cameras on all of 
them.

2464
01:57:16,650 --> 01:57:17,483
Yeah.
And everybody's got a camera and we're 

2465
01:57:18,240 --> 01:57:19,073
exchanging these stories.
You're catching stories from an an 

2466
01:57:23,880 --> 01:57:26,540
unimaginable number of humans.
Right?

2467
01:57:26,550 --> 01:57:28,650
And so even if we're looking at just our
country,

2468
01:57:28,710 --> 01:57:30,270
there's so many people just to La.

2469
01:57:30,270 --> 01:57:31,520
So many people.
It's $20,

2470
01:57:31,530 --> 01:57:32,760
million people.
It's insane.

2471
01:57:32,790 --> 01:57:37,790
What's really amazing that's really 
amazing is not just how far human beings

2472
01:57:38,551 --> 01:57:42,090
have come over the last hundred,
200,

2473
01:57:42,091 --> 01:57:45,270
300 years.
But what's really amazing is if you just

2474
01:57:45,271 --> 01:57:48,690
look at the actual numbers of times that
people interact with each other,

2475
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:51,000
how few of them are violent.
Yeah.

2476
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:54,420
Especially in a place like America in 
2018.

2477
01:57:54,930 --> 01:57:57,540
I think about that on the freeway.
All so many people because it just.

2478
01:57:57,590 --> 01:58:01,230
You're right.
And they're all pretty much acting in an

2479
01:58:01,231 --> 01:58:04,110
orderly fashion to preserve themselves 
and others.

2480
01:58:04,170 --> 01:58:05,040
Yeah.
Yeah.

2481
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:06,433
You ever,
every now and then you have someone 

2482
01:58:07,591 --> 01:58:09,930
that's just crazy,
just violates all the rules.

2483
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:11,093
Just weaving in traffic drive at 150 
miles an hour in a residential 

2484
01:58:13,951 --> 01:58:16,410
community.
Maybe it's just a mutation.

2485
01:58:16,830 --> 01:58:18,810
Maybe that's just a mutation,
you know,

2486
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:19,673
I think it is.
I think it is in the same way those 

2487
01:58:21,781 --> 01:58:25,230
things exists in like a biological 
system,

2488
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:25,470
right?

2489
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:27,660
You can get these little diseases,
a little bugs.

2490
01:58:27,690 --> 01:58:29,500
It's little things that are off,
you know,

2491
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:31,260
and then you have an immune system.
The battles,

2492
01:58:31,280 --> 01:58:32,280
the bugs.
Yeah.

2493
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:33,473
Like when you see stuff about 
chimpanzees are and there's like 

2494
01:58:37,051 --> 01:58:38,790
everyone's getting along trying to do 
their thing,

2495
01:58:38,791 --> 01:58:41,100
their struggles,
but then there's a real mutation.

2496
01:58:41,320 --> 01:58:42,153
Like there's someone that,
there's one that kills the rest of them 

2497
01:58:43,901 --> 01:58:45,810
and won't be part of the thing,
you know,

2498
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:46,673
that's what we have.
We have these kind of like renegade 

2499
01:58:50,410 --> 01:58:51,243
mutations run by evil swipe.
We should all go back to what's 

2500
01:58:54,160 --> 01:58:56,530
interesting is done in large groups,
right?

2501
01:58:56,531 --> 01:59:00,190
And all of us together,
like the way we interact with each other

2502
01:59:00,400 --> 01:59:01,233
is generally nonviolent.
Whoever these large groups will decide 

2503
01:59:06,730 --> 01:59:07,960
by whatever,
you know,

2504
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:11,800
whoever's in charge to attack other 
large groups.

2505
01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:16,300
And this is where the big death comes 
from,

2506
01:59:16,301 --> 01:59:16,570
right?

2507
01:59:16,570 --> 01:59:19,630
This is where the real toll comes from 
in war.

2508
01:59:19,750 --> 01:59:20,740
Right?
So,

2509
01:59:20,741 --> 01:59:21,574
but if you looked at the actual 
communities of people from one side or 

2510
01:59:25,001 --> 01:59:28,240
the other,
like the groups themselves together,

2511
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:31,000
how much are they really in conflict 
with those other people?

2512
01:59:31,300 --> 01:59:32,133
Probably not nearly as much as the 
people that are in charge would want 

2513
01:59:34,841 --> 01:59:35,800
them to be,
which.

2514
01:59:35,810 --> 01:59:37,540
Right.
Which is that.

2515
01:59:37,720 --> 01:59:38,553
It's almost like the mutation is in 
charge because you take two groups that 

2516
01:59:42,161 --> 01:59:42,994
are at war and you put them together.
They're just hanging out drinking beer 

2517
01:59:44,591 --> 01:59:46,000
together.
We're all the same age.

2518
01:59:46,001 --> 01:59:47,950
There was probably have a great time 
together.

2519
01:59:48,040 --> 01:59:51,040
They're leaders.
Talk them into leaders or the mutation.

2520
01:59:51,041 --> 01:59:51,874
That's when things get scary.
Whether it's the Hitler leader or you 

2521
01:59:54,670 --> 01:59:57,420
know,
North Korea do whatever the Russians do,

2522
01:59:57,580 --> 01:59:58,413
dating places.
They're talking people into invading 

2523
02:00:00,191 --> 02:00:01,024
places.

2524
02:00:03,060 --> 02:00:05,440
That's some slip.
Every justification.

2525
02:00:05,441 --> 02:00:06,120
Yeah.
No,

2526
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:07,810
that's where the world gets very 
strange.

2527
02:00:07,811 --> 02:00:12,100
And I think it's interesting that those 
people in those groups,

2528
02:00:12,490 --> 02:00:13,323
you know,
all come from all over the world or all 

2529
02:00:14,771 --> 02:00:16,940
over the country list all these 
different place in,

2530
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:18,730
they're brought together.
Right?

2531
02:00:18,731 --> 02:00:19,564
But look how we've progressed.
There's fewer of those kinds of 

2532
02:00:21,431 --> 02:00:23,590
conflicts now than ever before.
Right.

2533
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:24,424
But you and I,
and I think a lot of other people would 

2534
02:00:26,111 --> 02:00:27,640
like it to be zero amount,
right?

2535
02:00:27,670 --> 02:00:28,570
Yeah.
But Donald,

2536
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:30,010
I don't know if that's ever gonna 
happen,

2537
02:00:30,011 --> 02:00:30,844
man.
That's a weird thing to say because you 

2538
02:00:32,680 --> 02:00:33,513
would,
would like everybody to be in a good 

2539
02:00:34,661 --> 02:00:36,530
place in this world,
but you'll,

2540
02:00:36,630 --> 02:00:37,463
I almost wonder if like many things,
it's just like this push of good things 

2541
02:00:41,591 --> 02:00:43,690
happening in band things positive and 
negative,

2542
02:00:43,691 --> 02:00:44,524
and that this battle between the two of 
them is what creates all this momentum 

2543
02:00:47,801 --> 02:00:48,634
and all this movement.

2544
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,400
That's the good and evil.
We're back to the good and evil.

2545
02:00:51,401 --> 02:00:53,260
So maybe we should go back to church.
Look,

2546
02:00:53,970 --> 02:00:57,370
the priests did some weird stuff,
but maybe we.

2547
02:00:57,480 --> 02:00:59,800
It's good people in there more than evil
people.

2548
02:00:59,950 --> 02:01:00,783
Well,
the problem is with that church in 

2549
02:01:03,041 --> 02:01:03,874
particular,
they're still shielding the people that 

2550
02:01:06,011 --> 02:01:07,550
have done terrible things.
Yeah.

2551
02:01:07,720 --> 02:01:09,960
Yeah.
There's just no denying that there's.

2552
02:01:10,090 --> 02:01:10,923
If you look at the facts,
if you look at everything that's come 

2553
02:01:13,181 --> 02:01:14,650
out,
there's no denying that.

2554
02:01:14,820 --> 02:01:18,580
That's super unfortunate because I think
the vast majority of the people that are

2555
02:01:18,581 --> 02:01:22,270
involved in the religion that aren't the
people that are pedophiles,

2556
02:01:22,660 --> 02:01:25,630
I think they're very good people that 
probably think about it the same way.

2557
02:01:25,631 --> 02:01:27,280
Maybe your daughter would like to think 
about it,

2558
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:31,780
that some place where people can get 
together and they exchange affection and

2559
02:01:31,781 --> 02:01:32,614
comradery and uh,
and this acceptance of something higher 

2560
02:01:35,261 --> 02:01:38,650
than them that holds them to a certain 
standard and wants to be good people.

2561
02:01:38,651 --> 02:01:40,100
And that's for everybody.

2562
02:01:40,130 --> 02:01:40,963
Good for everybody.
But if it wasn't for all that kid 

2563
02:01:42,681 --> 02:01:45,860
fucking oh,
that kid fucking just ruined all that.

2564
02:01:45,890 --> 02:01:47,060
It just.
Yeah,

2565
02:01:47,280 --> 02:01:49,910
it really is.
It's such a sad,

2566
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:51,470
sad thing.
Google this,

2567
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:52,304
because I've said this many times and 
I've never bothered looking at it up 

2568
02:01:56,040 --> 02:01:58,660
there.
The reason why we can get another bottle

2569
02:01:58,680 --> 02:02:02,040
that if you want to get fucked up the 
holidays.

2570
02:02:02,070 --> 02:02:03,130
Okay,
so holidays,

2571
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:06,240
um,
shit,

2572
02:02:06,290 --> 02:02:08,270
lot of sediment in that.
What were we just talking about?

2573
02:02:09,020 --> 02:02:09,853
Good and evil and the priests and the 
why they're ruining your own use to go 

2574
02:02:13,611 --> 02:02:14,510
get that video.
Look.

2575
02:02:14,511 --> 02:02:15,860
Something up.
You haven't looked before.

2576
02:02:15,890 --> 02:02:17,450
Reason why.
Oh,

2577
02:02:17,510 --> 02:02:18,430
that's it.
Thank you.

2578
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:20,203
Thought that was gone forever.
I voted the reason why they forced 

2579
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:27,710
priest to be celibate because what I had
heard.

2580
02:02:28,090 --> 02:02:29,510
Oh,
was it?

2581
02:02:30,080 --> 02:02:30,913
This is not no scholarly work of my own.
I don't remember even reading the 

2582
02:02:34,821 --> 02:02:35,120
article.

2583
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:39,300
I think somebody told it to me that 
priests were banging too many chips.

2584
02:02:40,980 --> 02:02:42,710
Bravo.
He might've said it in that way.

2585
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:44,770
Too many chicks,
man.

2586
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:46,760
They made a mess out of it.
Which I think.

2587
02:02:46,940 --> 02:02:48,620
I don't think that was it.
What do you think it is?

2588
02:02:48,621 --> 02:02:52,160
I think it was property.
I think that when priests,

2589
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:57,430
priests owned property and if they were 
married and he died,

2590
02:02:57,740 --> 02:02:58,573
she would keep the property.
If there was no woman involved and he 

2591
02:03:02,031 --> 02:03:02,864
owned the property and he couldn't be 
with a woman and he swore that he was 

2592
02:03:06,141 --> 02:03:09,500
just with Jesus when he died,
the property went to the church.

2593
02:03:10,970 --> 02:03:12,590
Yeah.
Yeah.

2594
02:03:13,070 --> 02:03:13,730
That's,
you know,

2595
02:03:13,730 --> 02:03:15,740
which is not much of.
I mean,

2596
02:03:15,800 --> 02:03:18,170
that's crazy.
It's wow.

2597
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:19,123
That whole other part of Catholicism is 
the other thing that bumps me all the 

2598
02:03:21,531 --> 02:03:22,640
time.
When you go to the Vatican,

2599
02:03:22,650 --> 02:03:23,510
it's like,
wow,

2600
02:03:23,511 --> 02:03:26,000
this is beautiful,
but what were they?

2601
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,550
Get all this art.
Where'd they get all these bills?

2602
02:03:29,180 --> 02:03:34,180
The pillaging of fuck of religions where
the shit stolen from a time where people

2603
02:03:35,121 --> 02:03:39,800
are starving in the streets.
I know this is how powerful religion is.

2604
02:03:39,801 --> 02:03:40,634
This is how powerful this pull is to 
search for good and to be a part of 

2605
02:03:43,560 --> 02:03:48,560
something is in light of those things 
that you see the wealth.

2606
02:03:49,160 --> 02:03:49,993
It's like going into like a pirate ship 
and seeing all the shit that they got 

2607
02:03:52,700 --> 02:03:54,950
and then knowing what they do with these
children,

2608
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:59,450
both those things are.
You should just say,

2609
02:03:59,990 --> 02:04:01,040
fuck this.
I'm not going to be.

2610
02:04:01,070 --> 02:04:02,390
I'm not going to be a part of this at 
all,

2611
02:04:03,110 --> 02:04:04,170
but the,
the,

2612
02:04:04,430 --> 02:04:08,570
the other part of it is so strong that 
you actually will kind of say,

2613
02:04:08,571 --> 02:04:09,171
well,
yeah,

2614
02:04:09,171 --> 02:04:09,890
yeah,
yeah,

2615
02:04:09,890 --> 02:04:11,510
but I'm still going to go to mass on 
Sunday.

2616
02:04:11,810 --> 02:04:12,560
I think,
you know,

2617
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,260
what that means is you think that even 
if a priest is bad,

2618
02:04:15,261 --> 02:04:17,940
that the religion is still good.
You know,

2619
02:04:18,240 --> 02:04:18,590
the,
the,

2620
02:04:18,590 --> 02:04:19,423
the,
the idea is that this is like a bad guy 

2621
02:04:21,111 --> 02:04:21,944
who lost his way.
That's sort of human beings that are 

2622
02:04:24,980 --> 02:04:25,813
flawed.
Got a lot of them are drunk two men who 

2623
02:04:30,530 --> 02:04:32,630
read my grandma's.
Oh,

2624
02:04:32,890 --> 02:04:34,730
my grandma's eulogy.
No,

2625
02:04:34,790 --> 02:04:37,250
her name was Josephine.
He kept calling her Geraldine.

2626
02:04:37,640 --> 02:04:38,473
No,

2627
02:04:38,700 --> 02:04:40,220
they had to correct them.
It's Josephine,

2628
02:04:40,240 --> 02:04:41,073
like he was.
He was saying all these great things 

2629
02:04:42,301 --> 02:04:43,134
about her.
He didn't know who he was and he had 

2630
02:04:45,151 --> 02:04:46,260
those Jim Blossoms.
Oh,

2631
02:04:46,261 --> 02:04:47,650
Jamie brought it into the bottle of 
wine.

2632
02:04:47,670 --> 02:04:48,750
Oh,
Mike savage,

2633
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:49,740
savage,
Jamie,

2634
02:04:49,860 --> 02:04:51,900
Jamie.
But,

2635
02:04:51,901 --> 02:04:52,530
uh,
the,

2636
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:53,610
I think,
you know,

2637
02:04:53,611 --> 02:04:54,444
you take a guy and you put them in that 
position where he can't have a 

2638
02:04:56,341 --> 02:04:59,400
companion.
Like you're not allowed to have a love.

2639
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,800
He can't have a wife or a husband or 
whatever.

2640
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:02,634
You can't have that.
You're not allowable thing fighting 

2641
02:05:04,620 --> 02:05:05,453
nature.
There was a kid that I went to high 

2642
02:05:06,751 --> 02:05:08,460
school with that,
uh,

2643
02:05:08,760 --> 02:05:10,790
became a priest.
We all knew.

2644
02:05:11,970 --> 02:05:15,180
We all knew like it was.
It was like a thing you knew like,

2645
02:05:15,210 --> 02:05:16,500
oh,
this is why it's going to be a priest.

2646
02:05:16,530 --> 02:05:17,311
We get it.
Right.

2647
02:05:17,311 --> 02:05:18,580
Well,
that's what a lot of people say.

2648
02:05:18,580 --> 02:05:19,413
It's like that the church,
the other side of the church doesn't 

2649
02:05:22,081 --> 02:05:22,914
create pedophiles that like the 
institution attracts them because they 

2650
02:05:26,671 --> 02:05:28,350
know they'll be safe there.
Well,

2651
02:05:28,351 --> 02:05:29,184
it's possible,
but it's also possible that so many of 

2652
02:05:31,231 --> 02:05:32,064
them that are active in the church,
and I don't know what this guy's story 

2653
02:05:34,111 --> 02:05:35,310
was,
I barely knew him,

2654
02:05:35,850 --> 02:05:38,850
but that he could have been molested.
I mean is not.

2655
02:05:39,120 --> 02:05:43,140
It's not a small number of kids that 
were molested to very large,

2656
02:05:43,150 --> 02:05:43,983
large,
and you would never mean who the fuck 

2657
02:05:46,231 --> 02:05:47,064
understands what that would be like to 
be a young boy to have that happen to 

2658
02:05:51,001 --> 02:05:51,834
you and then get groomed and 
indoctrinated into being a part of this 

2659
02:05:55,111 --> 02:05:57,330
thing that does that other young boys in
the future.

2660
02:05:57,610 --> 02:06:00,420
So your whole reality,
which has to be with some of them are,

2661
02:06:00,630 --> 02:06:03,770
and they're all doing this under the 
blanket of this thing called the church.

2662
02:06:03,790 --> 02:06:04,623
Then when the church finds out about it,
the church moves people to all these 

2663
02:06:06,781 --> 02:06:07,614
different various places and they,
they get these new victims and this 

2664
02:06:11,821 --> 02:06:13,350
happens over and over and over again.
You know,

2665
02:06:13,360 --> 02:06:16,740
this was one of the things that they 
were saying about benedict about.

2666
02:06:16,741 --> 02:06:19,220
I'm the one who before.
Cool.

2667
02:06:19,880 --> 02:06:22,650
Yeah.
He had actively done that.

2668
02:06:22,680 --> 02:06:24,260
He adapted.
He was stolen people.

2669
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:26,070
Yeah.
It was a part of that.

2670
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:28,440
So bad,
so bad,

2671
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:33,260
and it's such a shame.
It was married Catholic priests there.

2672
02:06:33,270 --> 02:06:37,230
Perhaps 120 in the US already.
Here's how well it was this a new thing.

2673
02:06:38,540 --> 02:06:40,620
The other article I found that there's 
about 200.

2674
02:06:41,190 --> 02:06:43,440
Wow.
As of 1980,

2675
02:06:43,441 --> 02:06:48,441
there was a rule change or an adoption 
of a rule change that allowed it.

2676
02:06:48,540 --> 02:06:50,460
Why does it say,
does it say eastern only?

2677
02:06:50,490 --> 02:06:51,323
Is that what it's saying?
Was something in the story of the video 

2678
02:06:53,161 --> 02:06:54,790
that was going to just kind of pause it 
there.

2679
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:57,390
Why is he eastern Catholic like East 
Coast,

2680
02:06:57,391 --> 02:06:58,830
east coast,
west coast?

2681
02:06:58,831 --> 02:06:59,664
Not,
but Mexicans are not by the Catholic 

2682
02:07:04,441 --> 02:07:08,070
homes.
Bullshit.

2683
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:11,760
Brooklyn married in the house.
Huh?

2684
02:07:11,990 --> 02:07:16,650
One hundred and 20 Catholic priest 
married in the United States.

2685
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:17,513
Wow.
That would be great to policy change by 

2686
02:07:19,771 --> 02:07:20,604
Pope John Paul the second in 1980,
which offered a path for married 

2687
02:07:23,430 --> 02:07:24,263
Episcopal priest to continue their 
ministry after converting to 

2688
02:07:26,941 --> 02:07:28,740
Catholicism.
Oh,

2689
02:07:28,741 --> 02:07:32,970
so you have to be a priest already.
Episcopalian,

2690
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:36,460
and then you're allowed to have a wife 
and kids if you're Episcopalian,

2691
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:37,330
right?
Yeah,

2692
02:07:37,330 --> 02:07:40,570
for sure.
A convert to Catholicism right there.

2693
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:45,600
Like Cat Catholicism is the only one 
that doesn't allow them to have sex.

2694
02:07:45,850 --> 02:07:46,630
Right?
Yeah.

2695
02:07:46,630 --> 02:07:49,540
It's the only one with this littered 
with kid fucking right.

2696
02:07:49,730 --> 02:07:51,430
I mean,
coming up,

2697
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:52,953
cut the shit we were at,
we are actually at mass and he was 

2698
02:07:55,421 --> 02:07:56,254
talking about there was one thing from 
the gospel that was talking about being 

2699
02:07:59,921 --> 02:08:01,360
married,
being with a woman,

2700
02:08:01,690 --> 02:08:04,540
and then he finishes his answer.
Cheers.

2701
02:08:04,720 --> 02:08:06,940
Happy holiday.
He finishes the,

2702
02:08:06,941 --> 02:08:08,920
uh,
he finishes the,

2703
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:10,093
a sermon and then the reading,
then he goes into a sermon all about 

2704
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:17,680
being with a woman and this is a man 
that doesn't come close to that.

2705
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:18,923
This is a man that has no experience.
It would be so much better for the 

2706
02:08:21,791 --> 02:08:24,010
church if he wasn't married man with 
children.

2707
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:26,980
And then he could really talk about 
being in a family like,

2708
02:08:26,981 --> 02:08:27,814
who are you?

2709
02:08:27,860 --> 02:08:30,610
You know,
nothing about what we're dealing with on

2710
02:08:30,611 --> 02:08:31,900
a daily basis.
Yeah.

2711
02:08:32,230 --> 02:08:34,960
I never went to the Catholic Church when
I was an adult,

2712
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:39,760
but I would be curious to be there to be
a husband and wife sitting there in this

2713
02:08:39,761 --> 02:08:40,594
fucking church.
Listen to this dude who is supposed to 

2714
02:08:43,931 --> 02:08:44,764
be celibate drone on about how you 
should live your life and what kind of 

2715
02:08:47,471 --> 02:08:49,170
relationship you should have already 
pitched.

2716
02:08:49,180 --> 02:08:50,013
You're dressed like a fucking jeanie did
advice to giant scarf on like a wizard 

2717
02:08:56,501 --> 02:08:59,440
son as his posture is.
What are you doing?

2718
02:08:59,441 --> 02:09:03,040
What's that thing on your shoulders for 
white dress like that on silk.

2719
02:09:03,130 --> 02:09:03,963
You have underwear on.
It's really weird that we let people 

2720
02:09:05,441 --> 02:09:06,720
dress like that because yeah,

2721
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:07,673
like if you didn't.
If he just stood up there and had to be 

2722
02:09:09,631 --> 02:09:10,464
held accountable.
If the volume of his words were all he 

2723
02:09:13,621 --> 02:09:14,454
had,
like if you just made all priests and I 

2724
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:16,914
mean all preached across all religions.
If they all had to stand on a flat 

2725
02:09:23,490 --> 02:09:28,490
regular stage with nothing behind them 
and they had a dress like a,

2726
02:09:29,280 --> 02:09:32,070
like a regular person like you're 
addressing right now and no point.

2727
02:09:32,071 --> 02:09:34,110
He had no pointy hat.
No,

2728
02:09:34,111 --> 02:09:38,000
no fucking giant insane artwork behind 
you too.

2729
02:09:38,010 --> 02:09:42,450
Confusing up pedestal.
All that stuff fucks people up.

2730
02:09:42,451 --> 02:09:45,780
You go there and you see the like you've
been around,

2731
02:09:45,781 --> 02:09:46,390
right?
Yeah.

2732
02:09:46,390 --> 02:09:48,080
St Peter's Basilica.
See that?

2733
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:49,740
Yeah.
When you go in there,

2734
02:09:49,741 --> 02:09:52,410
I mean you almost can't believe that 
your eyes are working.

2735
02:09:52,411 --> 02:09:52,981
Correct?
Right,

2736
02:09:52,981 --> 02:09:54,240
exactly.
You're almost like,

2737
02:09:54,241 --> 02:09:56,370
this can't be something that someone 
actually made.

2738
02:09:56,371 --> 02:09:57,540
Yeah.
This is insane.

2739
02:09:57,541 --> 02:10:01,380
With no machines,
just their hands and thousands of people

2740
02:10:01,530 --> 02:10:02,363
like that that if you're in that thing,
you're going to be so humbled and so 

2741
02:10:05,791 --> 02:10:08,610
they're going to get away with a lot 
more shit than if you were in some weird

2742
02:10:08,611 --> 02:10:09,444
conference room.

2743
02:10:13,620 --> 02:10:17,900
Tiny little,
little bullshit ass cups of coffee.

2744
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:18,853
You know how you get a coffee machine 
and they have little tiny bullshit ass 

2745
02:10:21,070 --> 02:10:23,980
cops,
White Styrofoam Cups,

2746
02:10:23,981 --> 02:10:25,640
a handle on it.
The paper handle,

2747
02:10:25,641 --> 02:10:29,570
the folds out and you're dressing Joseph
a bank once in the handle.

2748
02:10:29,571 --> 02:10:32,630
It not that bad because they have to be 
a certain size to have a handle.

2749
02:10:32,720 --> 02:10:34,160
It's the that are.
They're little

2750
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,230
white ones.
A little white styrofoam ones.

2751
02:10:36,231 --> 02:10:37,610
Those are bullshit.
Yeah,

2752
02:10:37,640 --> 02:10:41,090
but they were putting the plastic,
the little triangle,

2753
02:10:41,091 --> 02:10:45,350
and nobody's going to buy your fucking 
connection during that place.

2754
02:10:45,770 --> 02:10:47,420
You have to.
You have to sell it.

2755
02:10:47,530 --> 02:10:48,980
You're not.
They're not just going to buy it.

2756
02:10:49,140 --> 02:10:49,973
If I allowed to dress like a wizard and 
you stand up and I'm a golden podium 

2757
02:10:52,761 --> 02:10:53,594
with a giant,
huge sculpture of Jesus nailed to a 

2758
02:10:56,421 --> 02:10:59,690
cross behind you and there's organ music
playing,

2759
02:11:00,100 --> 02:11:04,250
you know that's it's.
That's your act.

2760
02:11:04,310 --> 02:11:05,143
That's a good act.
That's an act that's going to look at 

2761
02:11:06,531 --> 02:11:07,364
that.
You know what,

2762
02:11:07,370 --> 02:11:08,203
man,
they should make that shit illegal the 

2763
02:11:08,871 --> 02:11:11,450
same way they made advertising booze 
illegal,

2764
02:11:14,330 --> 02:11:16,490
but you know what?
Look at how pretty that is though.

2765
02:11:16,640 --> 02:11:17,960
It's gorgeous.
So pretty.

2766
02:11:18,200 --> 02:11:22,340
Wouldn't be a better Christmas mass or 
some bunch of belly dancers up there and

2767
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:24,633
do this plan.
Bongo drums and people passing around 

2768
02:11:26,061 --> 02:11:26,894
joint.
Just a big ole cannabis infused loving 

2769
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:32,300
when that'd be better than this 
bullshit.

2770
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:33,173
Well,
these are all just grown adults and we 

2771
02:11:33,921 --> 02:11:36,380
can get all those grown adults just 
passing out.

2772
02:11:36,381 --> 02:11:38,330
We'd singing songs together.
Well,

2773
02:11:38,331 --> 02:11:40,460
what was it in New York was at the 
limelight?

2774
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:42,980
It wasn't church that turned into a 
club.

2775
02:11:48,860 --> 02:11:51,290
People in the church singing together 
with that.

2776
02:11:51,320 --> 02:11:52,040
Come on,
man.

2777
02:11:52,040 --> 02:11:53,780
That's possible too.
But you know what?

2778
02:11:53,781 --> 02:11:56,930
Those people that are in those pews that
looked like a thousand people,

2779
02:11:56,931 --> 02:11:57,980
right?
That's a big crowd.

2780
02:11:58,490 --> 02:12:01,370
Those people that are sitting there,
they are kind of high.

2781
02:12:01,610 --> 02:12:02,990
They're checking their watch right now 
and go,

2782
02:12:03,110 --> 02:12:08,110
when does enough of this guy drone?
And he's glad as sees fucking drunk.

2783
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:14,313
Yeah.
Where they go asking this for money 

2784
02:12:15,141 --> 02:12:17,180
again.
Those gin blossoms all over the face.

2785
02:12:17,181 --> 02:12:20,030
He looks like WC fields.
Fucking guys just getting drunk.

2786
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:21,830
Shit.
Put Shit in the basket.

2787
02:12:21,860 --> 02:12:23,720
Now they're coming out twice with the 
basket.

2788
02:12:23,721 --> 02:12:27,050
Screw this guy here.
You stop it.

2789
02:12:27,200 --> 02:12:31,550
God is going to hear you kind of going 
for his doctor's appointment tonight.

2790
02:12:31,551 --> 02:12:32,384
What if God's can I hear you?
But as the value of them having a place 

2791
02:12:35,001 --> 02:12:36,830
to go on that Sunday,
even though they hate it.

2792
02:12:36,950 --> 02:12:38,450
Important.
The limelight is a gym.

2793
02:12:38,451 --> 02:12:42,360
Now you have the limelight.
Was a fishbone at the line.

2794
02:12:42,510 --> 02:12:45,590
Hold on.
So the limelight does the dance club?

2795
02:12:45,591 --> 02:12:47,510
Yes.
Is now a fitness.

2796
02:12:47,930 --> 02:12:50,510
It was a church.
I can't tell what it was a market too.

2797
02:12:50,511 --> 02:12:52,790
It was a church.
It was a rock club,

2798
02:12:52,910 --> 02:12:53,743
so it doesn't last.
They started selling shit and sell that 

2799
02:12:55,851 --> 02:12:56,461
shit.
Imagine that.

2800
02:12:56,461 --> 02:12:57,171
It's your house,
Tom.

2801
02:12:57,171 --> 02:12:58,004
Papa.
It's that would inspire you to get your 

2802
02:12:59,691 --> 02:13:01,250
party rolling.
Live in a church.

2803
02:13:02,030 --> 02:13:03,560
It's the gym now.
Do.

2804
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:05,540
I would work out and that church all 
day.

2805
02:13:07,160 --> 02:13:09,380
That would be my spot.
Even if I had a gym at my house,

2806
02:13:09,470 --> 02:13:12,830
I would definitely go to that gym just 
to feel the juice.

2807
02:13:13,700 --> 02:13:16,020
Like I tell people,
I say I tell people all the time,

2808
02:13:16,040 --> 02:13:19,430
she always like,
I like working out like at my studio,

2809
02:13:19,431 --> 02:13:20,264
but I like going to places too because 
when you go to a place like there's a 

2810
02:13:24,321 --> 02:13:27,260
certain amount of juice,
you know you're in a new spot.

2811
02:13:28,040 --> 02:13:30,050
People around you that you don't know.
Yeah,

2812
02:13:30,051 --> 02:13:32,880
you're right.
We're out and it's also as a comic,

2813
02:13:32,881 --> 02:13:37,881
I think social interaction is one of the
least respected ingredients to our weird

2814
02:13:40,470 --> 02:13:44,340
sort of a stew of things that come 
together and make a bit.

2815
02:13:44,400 --> 02:13:46,800
You got to fill the well with,
with those experiences.

2816
02:13:46,801 --> 02:13:47,920
Yeah.
You got to talk to people.

2817
02:13:48,290 --> 02:13:50,940
It's like reading or just being out in 
the world.

2818
02:13:51,060 --> 02:13:52,180
It's important.
Yeah,

2819
02:13:52,230 --> 02:13:52,660
it's,
it,

2820
02:13:52,660 --> 02:13:55,920
it just all like all those things,
like reading is one thing you needed to,

2821
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:58,170
but I think like interacting with 
people,

2822
02:13:58,171 --> 02:14:00,420
it's just too goddamn gigantic.
So important.

2823
02:14:00,450 --> 02:14:02,580
I do this.
I am the,

2824
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:06,480
I do a monologue each week.
I'm out in America on live from here,

2825
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:10,620
which is the new prairie home companion.
And Are you allowed to say that?

2826
02:14:10,840 --> 02:14:11,960
Yeah.
Yeah,

2827
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:13,490
it's the new.
It's the new prairie home.

2828
02:14:13,810 --> 02:14:17,130
Did anybody else call you that or did 
you decide to call yourself that?

2829
02:14:17,290 --> 02:14:18,123
What?
The new prairie home companion it is 

2830
02:14:19,511 --> 02:14:22,470
that it was prairie home.
So you're actually doing this thing.

2831
02:14:22,471 --> 02:14:23,304
When I first got hired,
it was prairie hall and then they 

2832
02:14:25,051 --> 02:14:27,210
changed it when garrison keillor got in 
trouble.

2833
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:28,770
You got an unannounced called live from 
here.

2834
02:14:28,771 --> 02:14:30,270
He had a couple.
I was confused.

2835
02:14:30,290 --> 02:14:30,631
Yeah,
yeah.

2836
02:14:30,631 --> 02:14:31,860
Yeah.
And uh,

2837
02:14:32,100 --> 02:14:34,050
and uh,
I do a monologue each.

2838
02:14:34,051 --> 02:14:37,890
We call the out and America long.
Have you been doing this about a year?

2839
02:14:37,930 --> 02:14:41,670
And don't tell me a,
it's an NPR.

2840
02:14:42,150 --> 02:14:46,120
I figured you would know.
I figured all things considered gross.

2841
02:14:46,410 --> 02:14:48,600
I follow all the shit you do.
A,

2842
02:14:48,601 --> 02:14:50,890
I didn't know how you follow the Shit I 
do and I'm like,

2843
02:14:50,920 --> 02:14:51,753
yeah,
it's weird,

2844
02:14:53,700 --> 02:14:57,510
but my point is I do this model called 
out in America and it's me,

2845
02:14:57,810 --> 02:14:58,643
it's me,
it's me glasses shining a light on all 

2846
02:15:01,171 --> 02:15:02,520
the good people in America.
Right?

2847
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:05,280
And I do it every week on NPR.
Wear that suit like you own it,

2848
02:15:06,870 --> 02:15:08,850
but the reason I bring it up is not to 
plug it,

2849
02:15:09,420 --> 02:15:14,420
but to say it made me when I'm out on 
the road talking to people,

2850
02:15:15,060 --> 02:15:18,240
I would get in the car and throw my,
my headphones on.

2851
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:22,110
I wouldn't talk to people on flights.
I didn't talk to the person driving.

2852
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:24,690
Stay in my room,
do my shit as a comic,

2853
02:15:24,740 --> 02:15:25,573
just go and you kind of.
You're isolated and because I have to 

2854
02:15:27,451 --> 02:15:29,880
write this monologue each week,
I need inspiration.

2855
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:33,300
I really want to shine a light on the 
good people out in the country.

2856
02:15:34,230 --> 02:15:37,200
I started talking to everyone.
I don't take my headphones out.

2857
02:15:37,260 --> 02:15:38,093
I talked to the driver,
I talked to the people next to me if 

2858
02:15:39,751 --> 02:15:43,830
they want to talk,
and it is talking about filling the well

2859
02:15:43,831 --> 02:15:45,760
for your comedic,
you know,

2860
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:49,140
toolbox.
It's the greatest thing in the world.

2861
02:15:49,490 --> 02:15:52,590
There's billions of people.
They all are unique.

2862
02:15:52,591 --> 02:15:56,040
They all have a story to tell.
It's foolish.

2863
02:15:56,070 --> 02:15:57,910
Let's be as a comedian,
not to talk to these.

2864
02:15:57,940 --> 02:16:00,180
Be Harsh here,
but not all

2865
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:02,110
have a story to tell.
Some of them,

2866
02:16:02,111 --> 02:16:03,910
they might have a story to tell,
but you don't want to hear it.

2867
02:16:04,240 --> 02:16:05,140
Well,
some are bad,

2868
02:16:06,040 --> 02:16:11,040
some are disgusting.
Fucking story has a story.

2869
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:14,860
Got a deal that you're going to get a 
lot of stories.

2870
02:16:14,890 --> 02:16:16,720
They're going to be coming your way.
They do though.

2871
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:18,820
I mean honestly,
even like the biggest slug,

2872
02:16:18,821 --> 02:16:19,654
you'll find.

2873
02:16:20,510 --> 02:16:22,850
You talked to them about their family,
about their childhood,

2874
02:16:22,851 --> 02:16:24,480
about where they're growing,
grew up with.

2875
02:16:24,990 --> 02:16:26,180
There is a story there.

2876
02:16:26,290 --> 02:16:27,123
Here's his way to look at it.
You take the biggest loser that ever 

2877
02:16:30,131 --> 02:16:33,790
existed on planet earth and if you 
discovered him on Mars,

2878
02:16:33,820 --> 02:16:38,820
it's the biggest store in human history.
Holy Cow.

2879
02:16:40,670 --> 02:16:41,503
This true.
Some guy wearing a doggy mass jerking 

2880
02:16:45,281 --> 02:16:46,114
off with a bathrobe on on Mars.
It would be like the most important 

2881
02:16:48,821 --> 02:16:51,940
thing that's ever happened.
It's on the CNN fuck out.

2882
02:16:51,941 --> 02:16:56,190
They'd be like,
this can't be real closer.

2883
02:16:56,240 --> 02:17:01,240
I show you I'm real old man with donkey 
ass beaten off.

2884
02:17:02,200 --> 02:17:03,033
Right?
But if you found an old man with a 

2885
02:17:03,911 --> 02:17:08,911
donkey mask beaten off in Venice,
I'm still impressed.

2886
02:17:09,010 --> 02:17:13,390
I'm still shocked.
Like if I said Tom Papa,

2887
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:17,530
get your life savings.
Do you say yes or no?

2888
02:17:17,590 --> 02:17:18,423
There is currently a man with a donkey 
mask on wearing a bathrobe jerking off 

2889
02:17:23,560 --> 02:17:25,150
in Venice.
Yeah.

2890
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:26,890
You might.
You might want to lean.

2891
02:17:26,891 --> 02:17:27,740
Yes,
you might.

2892
02:17:28,450 --> 02:17:30,880
If they're bringing it to you,
I'd be super suspicious.

2893
02:17:30,881 --> 02:17:32,080
They'll be like,
that's your question.

2894
02:17:32,440 --> 02:17:33,840
Favorite.
Not An underdog on that.

2895
02:17:35,020 --> 02:17:36,790
My question.
My question is,

2896
02:17:36,791 --> 02:17:39,340
do you think that it ever happened?
Oh yes.

2897
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:40,953
Everything you can think of is that 
confident that someone has jerked off 

2898
02:17:43,510 --> 02:17:47,530
with a donkey mask on 100 percent.
Like a hotel bathrobe.

2899
02:17:47,590 --> 02:17:49,450
Especially in Venice.
It's all about masks.

2900
02:17:49,630 --> 02:17:51,910
In Venice,
I'm 100 percent confident that I can say

2901
02:17:51,911 --> 02:17:53,800
historically,
yes.

2902
02:17:54,010 --> 02:17:55,720
Everything you can think of as having a 
speech,

2903
02:17:55,721 --> 02:17:56,441
not Venice,
Italy.

2904
02:17:56,441 --> 02:17:57,710
Right.
Venice beach.

2905
02:17:57,711 --> 02:17:58,320
Right,
right,

2906
02:17:58,320 --> 02:17:58,780
right,
right.

2907
02:17:58,780 --> 02:17:59,613
No Venice.
Oh,

2908
02:17:59,630 --> 02:18:02,580
Venice,
Italy with all the bright.

2909
02:18:02,660 --> 02:18:04,870
With all the Catholic stuff.
Yeah.

2910
02:18:05,650 --> 02:18:07,480
And Post the water.
Get nine people panic.

2911
02:18:08,610 --> 02:18:10,360
Um,
can I ask you guys a question?

2912
02:18:10,690 --> 02:18:13,300
Sure.
Uh,

2913
02:18:13,620 --> 02:18:14,453
backed away at the beginning of the 
podcast when I was talking about wine 

2914
02:18:16,661 --> 02:18:20,380
and trying to learn about it and stuff.
The one thing I don't know about wine is

2915
02:18:20,381 --> 02:18:22,810
when I do drink it.
I never feel that drunk.

2916
02:18:23,710 --> 02:18:26,950
And we've had a bottle and a half now.
Do I seem drunk?

2917
02:18:27,190 --> 02:18:28,240
Yeah,
you seem pretty fucked up.

2918
02:18:28,241 --> 02:18:29,440
Don't tell me anything you don't want to
tell me.

2919
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:35,830
Do I seem that different from before?
I mean you were also fucked up too,

2920
02:18:35,831 --> 02:18:37,060
but.
No,

2921
02:18:37,090 --> 02:18:38,350
you seem fun.
Yeah.

2922
02:18:38,440 --> 02:18:40,870
Yeah.
Because I always get home and I'm like,

2923
02:18:40,880 --> 02:18:44,620
I have to say I was kept my shit 
together pretty good.

2924
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:46,480
And then I wake up the next morning,
I'm like,

2925
02:18:46,481 --> 02:18:47,314
Nah,
I was,

2926
02:18:47,320 --> 02:18:48,610
I shouldn't have done that.
Well,

2927
02:18:48,611 --> 02:18:51,850
sometimes you'll hear yourself like on a
podcast if you get really lit.

2928
02:18:52,030 --> 02:18:54,100
Like when we did that,
a sober October podcast,

2929
02:18:54,101 --> 02:18:56,320
I saw one of the clips realized that 
truck.

2930
02:18:56,330 --> 02:18:57,490
We were words.
I saw the clip.

2931
02:18:57,491 --> 02:18:58,600
I was like,
oh my God.

2932
02:18:58,601 --> 02:19:00,970
We were blasted.
We're in orbit.

2933
02:19:00,971 --> 02:19:02,130
Oh really?
Oh,

2934
02:19:03,330 --> 02:19:05,860
I was listening to myself talk.
You're so hammered.

2935
02:19:06,390 --> 02:19:07,223
It's so stupid because I want to be like
a gentleman that can drink and alcohol 

2936
02:19:10,571 --> 02:19:12,310
and be like,
sir,

2937
02:19:12,400 --> 02:19:13,810
if that is your goal,
you have achieved it.

2938
02:19:13,870 --> 02:19:14,703
Cheers.
Cheers.

2939
02:19:14,950 --> 02:19:16,480
Happy holidays.
He was certainly a.

2940
02:19:16,580 --> 02:19:18,740
because you don't seem and you did more 
than I did.

2941
02:19:20,940 --> 02:19:22,960
And you see them exactly the same as 
when we started.

2942
02:19:23,020 --> 02:19:24,460
Um,
I think you're projecting.

2943
02:19:24,550 --> 02:19:26,950
There was one point when after you 
smoked a lot,

2944
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:29,000
you were going to need.
That's what I did more than you.

2945
02:19:29,060 --> 02:19:31,260
I can tell it was a bit of a body high.
Well,

2946
02:19:31,261 --> 02:19:36,261
that weight is strong as fuck.
I think there's benefit to it.

2947
02:19:38,090 --> 02:19:38,923
I don't think there's like,
I don't think you should do everything 

2948
02:19:40,401 --> 02:19:41,900
all the time,
but I think there's benefit.

2949
02:19:42,180 --> 02:19:44,150
I don't think you should exercise all 
the time either.

2950
02:19:45,050 --> 02:19:45,883
I'll tell you this.
When I was flying back from New York 

2951
02:19:47,301 --> 02:19:50,750
yesterday and knew he had this when I 
was on the flight,

2952
02:19:50,751 --> 02:19:53,210
I was thinking it would be so nice to 
bring a bottle of wine,

2953
02:19:53,490 --> 02:19:56,480
just chill with the guys and this.
That would be so happy.

2954
02:19:56,481 --> 02:19:58,310
And now that we're in that moment.
Yes.

2955
02:19:58,400 --> 02:19:59,233
So happy.

2956
02:19:59,720 --> 02:20:02,240
So happy.
It's a good place.

2957
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:04,970
I'm worried about Jamie's hips,
Jamie's hips,

2958
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,310
so bugging,
you know that.

2959
02:20:06,320 --> 02:20:07,153
So the soul right actually helped a lot.
Really slant on it and breathe in and 

2960
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:11,751
yeah.
You know,

2961
02:20:11,751 --> 02:20:13,840
I have not used that yet.
I bought two of them.

2962
02:20:13,841 --> 02:20:15,650
I bought one for the House and one for 
the gym,

2963
02:20:15,950 --> 02:20:16,783
but that it's a,
it's called a so right for your so ass 

2964
02:20:19,390 --> 02:20:20,223
muscle.
So you lay on it and have it like 

2965
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:25,970
massage your inner gut area and works 
well.

2966
02:20:25,971 --> 02:20:29,810
Apparently that's like a muscle that 
gets knotted up on people and I had,

2967
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:32,940
I definitely got it get knotted up on me
when I was a.

2968
02:20:32,990 --> 02:20:33,823
I was running a little too often,
was running like four or five days a 

2969
02:20:37,701 --> 02:20:39,050
week.
It was starting to not up.

2970
02:20:39,830 --> 02:20:42,830
That's it.
It's like a foam roller,

2971
02:20:42,831 --> 02:20:43,664
but like if you could have an elbow on 
that phone and you lay on it on your 

2972
02:20:49,251 --> 02:20:51,200
back,
but a couple of different spots too.

2973
02:20:51,200 --> 02:20:53,210
They have like a spot in your shoulders 
in the front.

2974
02:20:53,211 --> 02:20:54,370
But yeah.
I don't know.

2975
02:20:54,380 --> 02:20:55,790
Whatever.
My pelvis area.

2976
02:20:55,880 --> 02:20:57,310
Yeah,
that looks nice but it helped.

2977
02:20:57,311 --> 02:20:58,190
Right?
You feel good?

2978
02:20:58,250 --> 02:20:59,660
That looks good.
Yeah,

2979
02:20:59,661 --> 02:21:00,890
you got to.
It's weird.

2980
02:21:00,930 --> 02:21:04,520
The human bodies all manipulatable 
malleable.

2981
02:21:04,580 --> 02:21:06,440
That's why yoga is so good.
Oh yeah.

2982
02:21:06,500 --> 02:21:08,480
Stretching in general like all that 
shit.

2983
02:21:08,900 --> 02:21:09,733
So good.
But it's just so weird how like deep 

2984
02:21:11,331 --> 02:21:12,164
tissue massage and all that stuff works 
and how your body's like pliable stuff 

2985
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,150
loose.
It's weird.

2986
02:21:19,151 --> 02:21:21,500
Some things up and someone is really 
good at it.

2987
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:23,450
If you get a Gao and knows how to use 
them.

2988
02:21:23,451 --> 02:21:27,910
Elbows and you needed a man fuck you up.
Uhm,

2989
02:21:28,310 --> 02:21:30,980
I started running with my dog,
with my lab.

2990
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:32,330
Yeah.
And uh,

2991
02:21:32,360 --> 02:21:35,570
but I run on the road and the sidewalk 
is um.

2992
02:21:35,930 --> 02:21:37,130
Do you feel like,
uh,

2993
02:21:37,640 --> 02:21:38,473
I feel so guilty sometimes that it's got
a little paws out just running on the 

2994
02:21:41,721 --> 02:21:42,554
road.

2995
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:45,380
I'm like,
is it hot?

2996
02:21:45,410 --> 02:21:49,160
You worried about like the hurt.
I know it's the hardness of it.

2997
02:21:49,980 --> 02:21:51,620
Which streets?
Maybe.

2998
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:53,180
I never thought.
It doesn't seem unhappy.

2999
02:21:53,210 --> 02:21:54,770
She seems like she's having a blast,
but.

3000
02:21:54,771 --> 02:21:56,660
Well it's definitely not as good as 
running the dirt.

3001
02:21:57,170 --> 02:21:57,860
Right?
No,

3002
02:21:57,860 --> 02:21:59,560
I mean probably for us either.
No,

3003
02:21:59,870 --> 02:22:00,950
it's definitely not.
Yeah,

3004
02:22:00,980 --> 02:22:02,330
it's definitely not.
It's weird.

3005
02:22:02,610 --> 02:22:03,443
You know,
there's not as much give and whenever I 

3006
02:22:04,491 --> 02:22:06,590
see people running in the cities,
I go,

3007
02:22:06,591 --> 02:22:08,360
I get it.
You want to exercise?

3008
02:22:09,170 --> 02:22:11,180
You decided to make this whole world 
your gym.

3009
02:22:12,590 --> 02:22:15,410
That's a weird thing.
I saw her the other day.

3010
02:22:15,590 --> 02:22:17,990
He was crossing Wilshire.
It's just no shirt on.

3011
02:22:18,310 --> 02:22:19,580
Tee Shirt.
Air Buds.

3012
02:22:19,970 --> 02:22:20,803
Just one of them.
One of those dudes is doing this at the 

3013
02:22:22,860 --> 02:22:27,570
fucking taking his pulse and he just 
runs across.

3014
02:22:27,571 --> 02:22:30,410
As soon as the light turns green,
he just using the street.

3015
02:22:30,670 --> 02:22:31,503
This was like 4:30
in the afternoon rush hour and he's 

3016
02:22:33,991 --> 02:22:36,320
using this place as his gym.
Amen.

3017
02:22:36,570 --> 02:22:37,403
That's why I like robbing though.
That's why I like running because as 

3018
02:22:39,151 --> 02:22:39,984
soon as you go out,
you're doing it and the other nice body 

3019
02:22:41,701 --> 02:22:44,940
to.
We wanted to let bitches know he did.

3020
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:47,430
He was slim and fit.
I don't get the.

3021
02:22:47,460 --> 02:22:49,050
That's what it was about.
Probably more than any of the.

3022
02:22:49,051 --> 02:22:51,600
Totally through Wilshire Peacock move.
Yeah.

3023
02:22:51,660 --> 02:22:52,493
No shirt on and just run around.
Do you do yoga with your shirt off or 

3024
02:22:58,460 --> 02:23:00,710
on?
Off?

3025
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:03,840
Off with all the gals there.
They don't give a fuck.

3026
02:23:03,841 --> 02:23:06,180
Do their suffering.
Everyone's suffering.

3027
02:23:06,230 --> 02:23:07,063
Yeah.
I always keep my shirt on because I 

3028
02:23:08,521 --> 02:23:10,920
always feel like as a man,
I'm not supposed to be there,

3029
02:23:10,921 --> 02:23:15,000
so it should just make it less as a man.
You're not supposed to be there.

3030
02:23:15,001 --> 02:23:17,200
Even after you the remarks you heard by 
[inaudible].

3031
02:23:17,400 --> 02:23:18,233
I'm confused.

3032
02:23:20,570 --> 02:23:23,070
Well,
if a man is supposed to be there.

3033
02:23:24,910 --> 02:23:27,180
All right everybody.
Look,

3034
02:23:27,181 --> 02:23:29,280
it's just too fucking hot.
It's too hot.

3035
02:23:29,281 --> 02:23:32,760
You don't want to have a shirt on.
Know that wet fucking hot thing.

3036
02:23:33,210 --> 02:23:36,750
Smothering you want to work from.
I do the regular.

3037
02:23:36,810 --> 02:23:39,350
I don't do the hot hot one.
I want to see you in a jog prop,

3038
02:23:39,351 --> 02:23:40,184
bro.
Why can't a wear something that just 

3039
02:23:43,081 --> 02:23:47,430
like like a like covers this nigga sweat
band for your tits?

3040
02:23:51,660 --> 02:23:52,850
Tits,
tits.

3041
02:23:53,260 --> 02:23:55,130
I mean,
I'm not saying I want a bra.

3042
02:23:57,820 --> 02:24:00,570
You sound okay for a guy to wear a 
bracelet.

3043
02:24:00,571 --> 02:24:03,800
Will kind is some bracelets,
but it's okay for you to wear with them.

3044
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:06,150
Tennis risk things.
Yeah.

3045
02:24:06,210 --> 02:24:08,130
It was like,
like a real band.

3046
02:24:08,150 --> 02:24:09,500
Yeah.
Those headbands for your risks,

3047
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:11,700
those risks,
those ones red,

3048
02:24:11,701 --> 02:24:15,330
white and blue.
Remember those in your head?

3049
02:24:15,390 --> 02:24:17,660
I thought I was the coolest fucking dude
on earth.

3050
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:20,850
I had a those wristbands with red,
white and blue on them.

3051
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:24,210
Like that's right.
Tube socks pulled up to the knee all the

3052
02:24:24,211 --> 02:24:26,280
way up.
Yeah.

3053
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:29,050
What were those things called?
What'd you call the bands?

3054
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:30,620
Like tennis wristbands?
Yeah,

3055
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:34,020
the headband and the wristband and they 
probably had a headband to.

3056
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:36,750
I had A.
I had one that was pretty bad ass.

3057
02:24:36,840 --> 02:24:38,880
You know what was a big.
It wasn't too though.

3058
02:24:38,881 --> 02:24:40,440
You just go the one.
You just go on the left.

3059
02:24:40,441 --> 02:24:42,210
That was the cool move.
There was a time.

3060
02:24:42,270 --> 02:24:44,580
I don't remember what the time was,
but there was a time when.

3061
02:24:44,970 --> 02:24:49,970
That's it right there.
Sock towered over two pieces.

3062
02:24:50,851 --> 02:24:54,400
Large son.
We're going to or those as soon as you.

3063
02:24:55,410 --> 02:24:57,030
I'm going to work next time.
Tom.

3064
02:24:57,031 --> 02:24:58,520
Papa.
I do a podcast somewhere.

3065
02:24:58,540 --> 02:25:00,690
Then red,
white and blue wristbands.

3066
02:25:01,150 --> 02:25:02,700
Kids.
That'd be awesome.

3067
02:25:02,701 --> 02:25:05,890
I literally had that fresh,
very fresh.

3068
02:25:05,940 --> 02:25:07,350
Felt cool.
Yeah.

3069
02:25:08,490 --> 02:25:09,720
Cool.
Don't.

3070
02:25:09,850 --> 02:25:11,030
Aren't those popularity?

3071
02:25:13,610 --> 02:25:16,710
I was going to say something.
A wristband.

3072
02:25:17,100 --> 02:25:19,590
Oh God damn it.
Son of a whore.

3073
02:25:19,950 --> 02:25:20,783
Marijuana combination of it being 
allowed to wear him a for a guy working 

3074
02:25:24,311 --> 02:25:26,350
out.
Sweat boobs.

3075
02:25:27,460 --> 02:25:28,293
Thrown a lot of information.
Why is it okay for a man to walk around 

3076
02:25:32,891 --> 02:25:35,650
with no shirt on and women can't?
Was that what you're going to say?

3077
02:25:35,800 --> 02:25:36,190
Well,
there's.

3078
02:25:36,190 --> 02:25:38,430
That's obvious.
We women because it.

3079
02:25:38,431 --> 02:25:40,480
There'll be a template.
They definitely can,

3080
02:25:41,100 --> 02:25:44,950
but I've talked about this before.
I think I said I would just.

3081
02:25:45,130 --> 02:25:47,410
I wouldn't recommend it to a friend will
be like,

3082
02:25:47,440 --> 02:25:49,300
don't go out there.
Ted saying,

3083
02:25:51,070 --> 02:25:51,903
if a friend tried to ask me if they 
think that they should exercise that 

3084
02:25:56,261 --> 02:25:58,050
right to freedom and be like,
well,

3085
02:25:58,060 --> 02:25:58,893
I don't want to get harassed.
You don't want to get harassed like I w 

3086
02:26:01,090 --> 02:26:01,923
would you wear like Bikini underwear?
Walked through a gay neighborhood on 

3087
02:26:06,011 --> 02:26:07,840
Saturday night at 10:30
PM.

3088
02:26:08,110 --> 02:26:08,943
When the ecstasy just kicked in to dad.
You're a piece of meat to how good do 

3089
02:26:15,761 --> 02:26:20,140
you think you'd feel walking through 
like a super duper gay neighborhood with

3090
02:26:20,141 --> 02:26:25,141
like little bikini briefs on sandbars 
Santa and for whatever reason,

3091
02:26:25,841 --> 02:26:28,000
you obviously shave your chest.
It's funny.

3092
02:26:28,030 --> 02:26:32,260
Maybe your chest is smooth as baby but.
But your back has hair on it.

3093
02:26:32,290 --> 02:26:35,320
It's funny because you're setting it up 
as a predatory kind of scenario,

3094
02:26:35,321 --> 02:26:38,810
but all I'm thinking is would they think
I was okay with like,

3095
02:26:39,170 --> 02:26:40,003
would they like me?

3096
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:43,570
Would you be pumped?
Her disgusted?

3097
02:26:43,690 --> 02:26:45,730
You'd know you'd be.
You didn't want the hassle.

3098
02:26:45,850 --> 02:26:47,360
That's what I tell my.
Yeah.

3099
02:26:47,370 --> 02:26:48,203
I mean,
I understand that there's like a cool 

3100
02:26:51,430 --> 02:26:56,430
movement now and it's a time when women 
should be able to go out there and dress

3101
02:26:56,721 --> 02:26:58,180
the way you want to dress.
It's not their problem.

3102
02:26:58,181 --> 02:27:00,610
It's the guy's problem.
Let's correct the guys rather than us.

3103
02:27:00,730 --> 02:27:01,690
Right.
I love that,

3104
02:27:02,110 --> 02:27:04,600
but there's a lot of guys that hadn't 
been corrected yet.

3105
02:27:04,810 --> 02:27:08,200
Who are going to hassle you and follow 
you in the parking lot.

3106
02:27:08,470 --> 02:27:09,640
Yeah,
that's the problem.

3107
02:27:10,030 --> 02:27:12,550
Those guys aren't woke once.
Everyone's all.

3108
02:27:12,551 --> 02:27:13,130
Whoa,
whoa.

3109
02:27:13,130 --> 02:27:13,963
It'll be dangerous word to use.
I feel like people are going to market 

3110
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:18,100
in the future.
Woke woke.

3111
02:27:18,160 --> 02:27:18,993
Yeah.
I feel like using woke now like 

3112
02:27:20,411 --> 02:27:23,920
unironically super slippery.
I see a trap coming.

3113
02:27:24,100 --> 02:27:24,933
You do.
Did you Jitsu practitioner in me is 

3114
02:27:26,231 --> 02:27:27,370
like,
I don't like this move.

3115
02:27:27,850 --> 02:27:29,560
This is a.
I know where this leads.

3116
02:27:32,110 --> 02:27:33,540
Right?
That's how I feel.

3117
02:27:33,541 --> 02:27:34,810
Yeah,
I see that woke thing.

3118
02:27:34,811 --> 02:27:35,920
I'm like,
what are you woke?

3119
02:27:35,921 --> 02:27:38,200
What the fuck does that even mean?
Woke up.

3120
02:27:38,530 --> 02:27:40,030
You woke up.
What do you 12?

3121
02:27:40,450 --> 02:27:42,490
Well,
it comes from my 16 year old,

3122
02:27:42,491 --> 02:27:44,500
so yeah,
it's kids today,

3123
02:27:45,220 --> 02:27:48,340
but what is being.
It means your brain is open.

3124
02:27:48,341 --> 02:27:50,470
You're open to stuff.
Your problem is.

3125
02:27:50,471 --> 02:27:54,850
There's no real quantification.
There's no real.

3126
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:58,300
There's no test you take to show that if
you're woke.

3127
02:27:58,560 --> 02:27:59,300
Right?
Right.

3128
02:27:59,300 --> 02:28:00,133
Like if you want to be a mathematician,
you have to fucking show that you know 

3129
02:28:03,370 --> 02:28:05,470
how to do math.
The professor said,

3130
02:28:05,680 --> 02:28:08,110
check your work like you get through 
like,

3131
02:28:08,111 --> 02:28:09,460
yes,
congratulations Tom.

3132
02:28:09,461 --> 02:28:11,610
Papa,
you are a mathematician,

3133
02:28:11,920 --> 02:28:14,830
phd in mathematics.
It says right here on the paper.

3134
02:28:14,840 --> 02:28:15,591
You're like,
God damn it.

3135
02:28:15,591 --> 02:28:17,380
I'm going to put that shit on my walls.
You understand?

3136
02:28:17,530 --> 02:28:19,360
I know how this stuff works.

3137
02:28:19,420 --> 02:28:21,160
Yeah,
but wokeness,

3138
02:28:21,500 --> 02:28:23,480
anybody can claim to be a master of 
wokeness.

3139
02:28:23,510 --> 02:28:27,080
It's like Kung Fu without fighting.
It's very dangerous.

3140
02:28:27,110 --> 02:28:27,943
Yeah.
No one's defined what's woke and what's 

3141
02:28:29,541 --> 02:28:31,960
preposterous.
No one's defined what's,

3142
02:28:32,020 --> 02:28:35,060
what's just not racist and sexist and 
not homophobic,

3143
02:28:35,061 --> 02:28:39,860
but open minded and aware of the 
failings and the misgivings of all sides

3144
02:28:39,960 --> 02:28:42,190
of us and with no bias.
Right?

3145
02:28:42,290 --> 02:28:42,800
Is that.
Well,

3146
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:44,600
because it doesn't seem like it is.
Isn't that woke?

3147
02:28:44,630 --> 02:28:45,463
I don't know,
I don't think.

3148
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:47,540
I think you just described what I 
thought it was.

3149
02:28:47,541 --> 02:28:49,610
I would like that,
but too many people could jump in.

3150
02:28:49,820 --> 02:28:50,653
There's no.
There's no real clear understanding of 

3151
02:28:53,571 --> 02:28:56,960
like what makes it constitutes someone 
being like,

3152
02:28:56,990 --> 02:28:57,823
yeah.
How many of those boxes do you have to 

3153
02:28:58,671 --> 02:29:00,830
check it?
Like stopped Tom?

3154
02:29:00,831 --> 02:29:03,950
Papa had a woke academy and you took 
these people.

3155
02:29:04,810 --> 02:29:08,990
It would just been to you like bread or 
not like bread claiming wokeness.

3156
02:29:09,350 --> 02:29:13,610
Super slippery.
What's his 62 New York Times magazine or

3157
02:29:14,190 --> 02:29:19,190
being woke crazy.
Dig It.

3158
02:29:19,430 --> 02:29:20,320
Look,
if you're woke,

3159
02:29:20,370 --> 02:29:21,203
dig it.
Oh,

3160
02:29:21,240 --> 02:29:23,060
that's the perfect definition right 
there.

3161
02:29:23,850 --> 02:29:25,310
If you're woke,
you dig it.

3162
02:29:25,311 --> 02:29:29,450
That is insane.
That was my Fox man and you were copying

3163
02:29:29,451 --> 02:29:34,310
my taste and grit.
We don't jump salty on me.

3164
02:29:34,550 --> 02:29:36,350
Whoa.
Look how they talked back.

3165
02:29:36,351 --> 02:29:40,820
Then they were trying to talk people 
into talking the way that made them seem

3166
02:29:40,821 --> 02:29:41,654
more interesting.
I'm going to say it the way I would say 

3167
02:29:43,461 --> 02:29:44,294
that if I lived back then hey,
could make it bigger so I can see why 

3168
02:29:46,940 --> 02:29:48,900
you'd be the guy on the left.
Jimmy.

3169
02:29:49,630 --> 02:29:50,240
No,
no,

3170
02:29:50,240 --> 02:29:51,080
no.
Scrolling,

3171
02:29:51,081 --> 02:29:52,940
so we could read what they were.
Six comments.

3172
02:29:53,690 --> 02:29:54,680
What he's saying.
Up Top.

3173
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:55,220
Yeah.
Okay.

3174
02:29:55,220 --> 02:29:57,740
That was,
that was my facts man.

3175
02:29:59,240 --> 02:30:03,710
And you were that grace and grit.
So how would you say that now?

3176
02:30:04,410 --> 02:30:08,970
Um,
that was my fox man cop in my tastes.

3177
02:30:08,971 --> 02:30:10,540
And of course it's girl boy,
girl.

3178
02:30:10,541 --> 02:30:13,910
And you were saying no,
that's what they said.

3179
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:14,870
Oh,
we'll use.

3180
02:30:14,870 --> 02:30:16,400
What words would you use today?
Yeah,

3181
02:30:16,401 --> 02:30:17,234
yeah.
He would say the fuck he doing with my 

3182
02:30:18,921 --> 02:30:22,040
girlfriend dickhead.
And he said,

3183
02:30:22,041 --> 02:30:24,530
don't jump salty on me.
I would say,

3184
02:30:24,870 --> 02:30:26,570
hey,
we're cool.

3185
02:30:26,780 --> 02:30:28,370
No worries,
no worries.

3186
02:30:28,760 --> 02:30:30,590
Stop being such a bitch.
It's all good.

3187
02:30:30,640 --> 02:30:31,760
It's all good.
Yeah.

3188
02:30:31,780 --> 02:30:32,990
And then it'd be like,
what?

3189
02:30:33,560 --> 02:30:36,350
Someone's a bitch.
And then next thing you know,

3190
02:30:36,351 --> 02:30:40,760
people will be hitting each other.
That's a darkened snowman with these two

3191
02:30:40,761 --> 02:30:43,280
gentlemen to the left,
it says Noah Webster.

3192
02:30:43,281 --> 02:30:45,230
I think that might be like the webster's
dictionary.

3193
02:30:45,280 --> 02:30:49,800
A Guy Peter,
Peter in the dictionary.

3194
02:30:49,801 --> 02:30:54,260
This squirly the letters are all 
blurred.

3195
02:30:54,261 --> 02:30:55,400
Right?
I love that.

3196
02:30:55,590 --> 02:30:57,620
I love that.
If you're woke,

3197
02:30:57,890 --> 02:30:58,830
you dig it.
Yeah.

3198
02:30:58,840 --> 02:30:59,960
If you're woke,
you dig it.

3199
02:31:00,290 --> 02:31:01,580
That's,
that sums it up,

3200
02:31:01,581 --> 02:31:03,110
man.
If you're woke,

3201
02:31:03,140 --> 02:31:05,600
you dig it after a.
how'd you find this?

3202
02:31:05,601 --> 02:31:07,020
Jamie?
Come back to that typed in.

3203
02:31:07,560 --> 02:31:10,250
It's like know your meme.
Oh Wow.

3204
02:31:10,310 --> 02:31:13,220
So the meme of the word woke.
Wow.

3205
02:31:13,970 --> 02:31:15,920
Look at that little image though.
Scroll back up.

3206
02:31:15,921 --> 02:31:17,960
So it again.
That's so strange.

3207
02:31:17,961 --> 02:31:20,130
Like I'm bad.
Shift was contemporary.

3208
02:31:20,470 --> 02:31:23,100
Like if that was your world,
like imagine if hipsters all of a sudden

3209
02:31:23,101 --> 02:31:24,840
started wearing tails.
So their jackets,

3210
02:31:27,390 --> 02:31:32,390
they just decided this is the next level
of bow ties and those tails.

3211
02:31:32,980 --> 02:31:36,720
It wouldn't be surprising because that's
all about just doing what you guys don't

3212
02:31:36,721 --> 02:31:40,080
do.
So what a weird look though.

3213
02:31:40,250 --> 02:31:41,700
It is.
It is so weird.

3214
02:31:42,270 --> 02:31:44,010
That's a look that like,
okay,

3215
02:31:44,100 --> 02:31:47,460
so like the guy in the center,
it's like those two guys,

3216
02:31:47,461 --> 02:31:49,950
both of Gods in the center.
Those guys will fly today.

3217
02:31:50,190 --> 02:31:52,560
Oh totally.
The guy in the left that looks like he's

3218
02:31:52,561 --> 02:31:54,930
dressed like he's a.
That looks like me on the road,

3219
02:31:56,640 --> 02:31:57,473
but he looks like he's an acquaintance 
Tarantino movie or something like he's 

3220
02:32:00,030 --> 02:32:02,280
reservoir dogs.
That's totally normal.

3221
02:32:02,281 --> 02:32:04,530
Really blend the matrix.
Black suit tie,

3222
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:05,633
that'll door.
I can go to any restaurant anywhere and 

3223
02:32:07,741 --> 02:32:09,300
no one would even bat an eye.
They go,

3224
02:32:09,301 --> 02:32:11,310
Whoa sir,
can I help you?

3225
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:12,233
Boom,
right in with the gun image guy next to 

3226
02:32:14,641 --> 02:32:16,770
him.
But those two guys on the end,

3227
02:32:17,100 --> 02:32:18,540
like,
what in the fuck are they?

3228
02:32:18,570 --> 02:32:19,403
He's got a coat with tails and those 
pants that are like flat across your 

3229
02:32:24,031 --> 02:32:25,950
crotch where it looks like you have no 
privates.

3230
02:32:25,980 --> 02:32:30,090
Here's a good way to look at it.
Imagine if you're dating a gal and a guy

3231
02:32:30,100 --> 02:32:32,300
come over and you're like,
you're really gonna.

3232
02:32:32,320 --> 02:32:34,050
Love my dad.
He's an amazing guy.

3233
02:32:34,350 --> 02:32:39,350
He's real old school and dressed like 
that with coat tails.

3234
02:32:41,311 --> 02:32:43,380
Yeah,
and you start feeling like you're like,

3235
02:32:43,381 --> 02:32:44,214
you're in the movie.
Get out and he's got a handlebar 

3236
02:32:46,441 --> 02:32:48,330
mustache.
He's got tails.

3237
02:32:48,360 --> 02:32:49,260
Yeah.
Weird,

3238
02:32:49,290 --> 02:32:51,300
weird pants with the going to funny 
shoes.

3239
02:32:51,301 --> 02:32:52,134
You see.
Get Out.

3240
02:32:52,370 --> 02:32:53,203
Yeah.
I finally watched it during sober 

3241
02:32:54,451 --> 02:32:55,141
October.
Oh,

3242
02:32:55,141 --> 02:32:56,640
you did?
Fucking fantastic.

3243
02:32:56,670 --> 02:32:57,503
Yeah,
that's.

3244
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:00,570
But that's what you'd be thinking if 
that guy was dressed like that,

3245
02:33:00,730 --> 02:33:01,563
but the daughter was going to lead you 
to something and you have to run for 

3246
02:33:03,091 --> 02:33:03,924
your life.
But it is weird how like that suit has 

3247
02:33:07,531 --> 02:33:11,430
lasted a long time.
Well this was 1960,

3248
02:33:11,431 --> 02:33:15,240
so I'm assuming that it was mocking the 
style of old.

3249
02:33:15,270 --> 02:33:16,103
So by the time 1960 rolled around,
the guys in the middle where trust 

3250
02:33:18,271 --> 02:33:20,110
contemporary,
but the guys at the end,

3251
02:33:20,111 --> 02:33:22,590
they're like making fun of people the 
way they used to dress.

3252
02:33:22,680 --> 02:33:24,900
Yeah.
Kind of in a way or at least that's what

3253
02:33:24,901 --> 02:33:26,820
represents those people.
Yeah.

3254
02:33:26,950 --> 02:33:27,783
It just defines their time.
That guy was probably around the 18 

3255
02:33:30,001 --> 02:33:33,090
hundreds.
Where were those other guys are?

3256
02:33:33,900 --> 02:33:36,690
Do you know who those guys are?
I believe Noah Webster.

3257
02:33:36,720 --> 02:33:38,470
Webster.
Webster dictionary.

3258
02:33:38,471 --> 02:33:40,650
That's why it's got the pen and he's 
scratching his head.

3259
02:33:40,651 --> 02:33:44,980
Is that guys putting out his slang?
His slang is making websites.

3260
02:33:45,270 --> 02:33:46,580
What the fuck?
He's like,

3261
02:33:46,650 --> 02:33:47,483
that's not how you really say it.
So it would be like the urban 

3262
02:33:49,441 --> 02:33:50,310
dictionary,
like,

3263
02:33:50,320 --> 02:33:52,650
oh,
Jamie and I sometimes get confused.

3264
02:33:52,651 --> 02:33:53,484
We have to pull up the urban dictionary 
and find out what the real word of a 

3265
02:33:55,640 --> 02:33:57,570
word means.
So let's pull up woke.

3266
02:33:58,090 --> 02:34:00,090
Yeah,
represented today.

3267
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:04,470
You know what?
No disrespect.

3268
02:34:04,680 --> 02:34:05,513
No cultural appropriation intended.
The fact that it was invented actually 

3269
02:34:10,110 --> 02:34:11,400
in the sixties.
It was really weird.

3270
02:34:11,510 --> 02:34:14,010
It was just making a comeback,
looking around when I typed in,

3271
02:34:14,011 --> 02:34:15,980
like what is woke to see if there's 
anything and she,

3272
02:34:15,990 --> 02:34:18,110
if you dig it,
you was saying

3273
02:34:18,160 --> 02:34:18,993
were knowledgeable about your community 
in the world with the willingness to 

3274
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:26,640
access and critique systems of 
oppression a.

3275
02:34:26,830 --> 02:34:30,310
well that part.
Exactly,

3276
02:34:30,311 --> 02:34:33,490
yes.
I mean for sure if it really is a system

3277
02:34:33,491 --> 02:34:34,324
of oppression,
but how do we decide what's the system 

3278
02:34:36,461 --> 02:34:40,330
of oppression and what is sounds like 
you need Jordan Peterson,

3279
02:34:40,331 --> 02:34:45,331
weird human behavior that represents 
that interact with each other on a grand

3280
02:34:47,291 --> 02:34:48,910
scale.
I mean that's just,

3281
02:34:48,911 --> 02:34:49,744
like I say,
there are some legitimate systems of 

3282
02:34:53,591 --> 02:34:54,660
oppression,
right?

3283
02:34:54,661 --> 02:34:55,360
Yeah.
For Real.

3284
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:58,510
It's like figuring out which one it is.
Yeah.

3285
02:34:59,320 --> 02:35:00,490
Before,
but putting that in,

3286
02:35:00,820 --> 02:35:01,653
that's what woke is like how do you do?
How do you define what the system's 

3287
02:35:06,330 --> 02:35:07,000
like?
Where does,

3288
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:08,770
where does the line get drawn?
Right?

3289
02:35:08,910 --> 02:35:13,910
It was the line like,
why do women have certain jobs?

3290
02:35:15,701 --> 02:35:16,534
White men have certain jobs.
How much of that is because of 

3291
02:35:18,341 --> 02:35:19,670
influence?
How much of that,

3292
02:35:19,750 --> 02:35:20,583
because of their choices,
how much of that is just because of 

3293
02:35:22,181 --> 02:35:25,870
natural proclivities towards certain 
things?

3294
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:26,933
Well then you're talking about people 
that are coming after the hierarchy and 

3295
02:35:30,481 --> 02:35:31,314
if they're coming up to the hierarchy,
who's to say that those people are in 

3296
02:35:33,871 --> 02:35:36,300
part of the problem?
I love Jordan Peterson.

3297
02:35:36,301 --> 02:35:38,070
The.
It's just like hammers.

3298
02:35:38,071 --> 02:35:38,770
Just.
Yeah.

3299
02:35:38,770 --> 02:35:40,620
Well then what do you want?
What are you saying?

3300
02:35:41,160 --> 02:35:45,100
Who are you?
What are you buying into the hierarchy?

3301
02:35:45,260 --> 02:35:48,800
You're loved like the exasperations in 
his ways.

3302
02:35:49,060 --> 02:35:49,950
No,
but it's true.

3303
02:35:49,980 --> 02:35:53,190
It's like then this true that that woke 
definition was like,

3304
02:35:53,220 --> 02:35:53,881
oh,
I'm with you.

3305
02:35:53,881 --> 02:35:54,714
This is all about being nice and kind.
And then at the end it's about 

3306
02:35:56,461 --> 02:35:57,420
attacking.
Right?

3307
02:35:57,421 --> 02:35:58,380
But here's the bad crazy.

3308
02:35:58,380 --> 02:36:01,320
The thing is the end part about 
attacking is where it gets weird because

3309
02:36:02,700 --> 02:36:05,310
Jordan Peterson is the guy who gets 
regularly attacked,

3310
02:36:05,800 --> 02:36:07,050
misrepresented,
like.

3311
02:36:07,090 --> 02:36:07,923
Especially in terms of like that.
He is somehow or another a racist 

3312
02:36:10,440 --> 02:36:12,990
because some racist like him.
I've heard that argument.

3313
02:36:13,020 --> 02:36:14,730
It's crazy.
Argument doesn't make any sense.

3314
02:36:15,150 --> 02:36:17,220
He's not a racist by any stretch of the 
imagination.

3315
02:36:17,280 --> 02:36:19,250
He believes in individuals.
I mean,

3316
02:36:19,320 --> 02:36:23,550
he's more Ian Rand then it.
I never say that.

3317
02:36:23,551 --> 02:36:25,140
Right.
I know her name's Ian Rand,

3318
02:36:25,141 --> 02:36:26,370
but I always say I grind

3319
02:36:26,830 --> 02:36:30,210
really like a natural instinct to fuck 
it up,

3320
02:36:30,360 --> 02:36:31,193
but it really is like.
His thing is it's like the power of the 

3321
02:36:33,721 --> 02:36:36,900
individual and responsibility and doing 
your thing and he's.

3322
02:36:36,970 --> 02:36:37,790
He's understanding.

3323
02:36:37,790 --> 02:36:39,660
Of course during this time,
of course he's under attack,

3324
02:36:39,800 --> 02:36:42,590
but he's also under celebration.
Yeah,

3325
02:36:42,650 --> 02:36:45,420
he's under.
He's been celebrated as well as attack,

3326
02:36:45,440 --> 02:36:46,273
but much more celebrated.
It's under celebration more that he's 

3327
02:36:48,111 --> 02:36:49,070
under attack.
He.

3328
02:36:49,071 --> 02:36:53,000
It's nice to hear that viewpoint 
articulated in such a clear,

3329
02:36:53,450 --> 02:36:56,420
concise way.
He's a genuine sweetheart of a guy.

3330
02:36:56,810 --> 02:36:58,490
I mean,
I think if people knew him.

3331
02:36:58,580 --> 02:36:59,413
I think part of the thing is some of his
views are very powerful and polarizing 

3332
02:37:04,041 --> 02:37:09,041
to some folks who have a specific idea 
of how things are and what things should

3333
02:37:09,380 --> 02:37:12,950
be and what would.
What represents Transphobia,

3334
02:37:13,010 --> 02:37:15,010
what represents sexism,
and you know,

3335
02:37:15,020 --> 02:37:15,853
these are all fascinating discussions as
long as everybody's just being rational 

3336
02:37:19,431 --> 02:37:20,140
and.
Yeah,

3337
02:37:20,140 --> 02:37:21,830
and being honest about it,
but yeah,

3338
02:37:22,220 --> 02:37:23,350
it's good.
It's moving,

3339
02:37:24,090 --> 02:37:24,923
it's moving the discussion forward.
It's like you should hear all sides and 

3340
02:37:27,291 --> 02:37:29,870
you should hear what he's saying is,
you know,

3341
02:37:29,960 --> 02:37:33,910
in a lot of ways is very true and very 
real and it's like,

3342
02:37:34,040 --> 02:37:34,873
right,
but the presentation of it in these 

3343
02:37:35,871 --> 02:37:36,704
times,
it's like he's very brave because he 

3344
02:37:39,801 --> 02:37:44,090
knows that anything he says there's 
going to be a shitstorm in response.

3345
02:37:44,300 --> 02:37:46,430
Well,
he's very brave in that respect,

3346
02:37:46,431 --> 02:37:47,264
but it's also very brave in that he's 
done a tremendous amount of research on 

3347
02:37:51,591 --> 02:37:52,424
all these different subjects he was 
talking about and when he talks about 

3348
02:37:54,921 --> 02:37:55,754
something from a scientific perspective,
he's not talking about it because it 

3349
02:37:57,741 --> 02:37:58,574
aligns with his beliefs and he will in 
fact highlight things that don't align 

3350
02:38:01,731 --> 02:38:05,480
with his beliefs and show that he has a 
hole in some of his thinking.

3351
02:38:05,510 --> 02:38:06,110
He'll,
he'll,

3352
02:38:06,110 --> 02:38:08,450
he'll pause in midsentence and goes,
well,

3353
02:38:08,451 --> 02:38:11,210
I guess I'm wrong.
Then he does.

3354
02:38:11,450 --> 02:38:13,730
He has a hundred percent of intellectual
honesty.

3355
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:15,110
Yeah,
he's just,

3356
02:38:15,500 --> 02:38:16,333
he's not scared to take on this system 
of the way people think and behave and 

3357
02:38:23,870 --> 02:38:27,020
this system works both for really 
progressive,

3358
02:38:27,050 --> 02:38:27,883
open minded people that support most of 
the things that you and I probably 

3359
02:38:31,401 --> 02:38:32,234
support and it also.
The system is also in place for people 

3360
02:38:34,491 --> 02:38:35,324
that have more stringent conservative 
viewpoints and we have to look at 

3361
02:38:38,841 --> 02:38:39,260
everybody.

3362
02:38:39,260 --> 02:38:40,093
Honestly,
if you want to debate whether someone's 

3363
02:38:41,901 --> 02:38:43,830
opinions or one thing or the other.
Yeah,

3364
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,650
absolutely.
I'm with you 100 percent.

3365
02:38:45,740 --> 02:38:46,573
The problem is when you start calling 
someone a racist and calling someone a 

3366
02:38:49,131 --> 02:38:49,964
racist because you think that racists 
like him or calling someone the sexist 

3367
02:38:52,910 --> 02:38:57,050
because you think that sexist like him 
or because he say's says things that you

3368
02:38:57,051 --> 02:38:57,884
don't agree with.
If you don't agree with them and you 

3369
02:38:59,751 --> 02:39:04,340
just dismissed them at this as this 
really shallow sexist opinion.

3370
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:06,650
The problem is other people got to read 
what you're saying.

3371
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:07,693
They're going to look into it and it's 
going to seem silly because the guy has 

3372
02:39:10,760 --> 02:39:15,440
volumes and volumes and volumes that you
could read and that he has books.

3373
02:39:15,441 --> 02:39:18,200
He has all these different lectures 
where he discusses these things,

3374
02:39:18,410 --> 02:39:21,230
podcast,
we're discussing these things and really

3375
02:39:21,231 --> 02:39:24,530
complex and well thought out ways that 
you can't.

3376
02:39:24,680 --> 02:39:26,810
You can't say his race and what's 
fortunate.

3377
02:39:26,811 --> 02:39:29,510
What's unfortunate is that he presents 
this stuff.

3378
02:39:30,230 --> 02:39:33,970
We should then our responsibility is to 
deal with the stuff,

3379
02:39:34,190 --> 02:39:38,210
deal with the ideas,
not what does it matter who he is,

3380
02:39:38,211 --> 02:39:41,180
how he talks,
what he is and who cares,

3381
02:39:41,210 --> 02:39:44,870
but the problem is the idea is what we 
should all then,

3382
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:46,130
oh,
thank you.

3383
02:39:46,220 --> 02:39:47,053
Take it whether you like it or not,
take it and then wrestle that idea and 

3384
02:39:50,181 --> 02:39:51,014
move it for 100 percent,
but we also have to be aware that 

3385
02:39:53,061 --> 02:39:53,894
there's a real problem and calling 
someone a monster is not a monster 

3386
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:58,850
because then when real monsters come 
along,

3387
02:39:59,360 --> 02:40:00,840
you already used that word up,
right?

3388
02:40:01,180 --> 02:40:02,013
That's this is like you have to be 
careful because there's real racist in 

3389
02:40:04,641 --> 02:40:06,020
the world.
There's real bad people,

3390
02:40:06,410 --> 02:40:09,080
so calling someone a bad person just 
because you don't agree with them,

3391
02:40:09,320 --> 02:40:10,153
you fall into a very slippery 
ideological trap and a lot of times 

3392
02:40:12,681 --> 02:40:14,070
people it just to get attention.

3393
02:40:14,370 --> 02:40:15,720
They want to throw their hat into the 
ring.

3394
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:17,050
They want their,
their,

3395
02:40:17,080 --> 02:40:18,640
their,
their say they want,

3396
02:40:18,680 --> 02:40:20,940
they want to get it out,
they want to make an impact.

3397
02:40:20,941 --> 02:40:22,140
They want that love.
Yeah.

3398
02:40:22,150 --> 02:40:22,983
They want to be part of that.
I want to be part of the discussion and 

3399
02:40:24,541 --> 02:40:27,360
they might have very strong beliefs that
they think are correct,

3400
02:40:27,540 --> 02:40:29,760
but I guarantee if you,
if that,

3401
02:40:29,810 --> 02:40:32,040
those strong beliefs are that Jordan is 
a racist,

3402
02:40:32,490 --> 02:40:35,480
you don't know him well,
there's no way you could write in.

3403
02:40:35,610 --> 02:40:36,443
There's no way you're really familiar 
with a lot of the things that he says 

3404
02:40:38,731 --> 02:40:41,100
about race because he doesn't say 
anything racist.

3405
02:40:41,101 --> 02:40:42,890
He talks in terms of.
I mean,

3406
02:40:42,960 --> 02:40:45,870
he,
he always emphasizes individuals.

3407
02:40:47,250 --> 02:40:48,270
The most important thing

3408
02:40:48,270 --> 02:40:49,770
that's,
that Ian ran thing.

3409
02:40:49,990 --> 02:40:51,600
It's not about that.
It's,

3410
02:40:51,601 --> 02:40:52,434
uh,
it's about the person you responsible 

3411
02:40:55,141 --> 02:40:55,974
for,
you doing you despite whatever comes at 

3412
02:40:58,141 --> 02:40:59,970
you because everything's always going to
come at you.

3413
02:41:00,060 --> 02:41:00,450
Yeah.
It's an.

3414
02:41:00,450 --> 02:41:03,690
And it's not a denial of racism.
Racism is fucking horrible.

3415
02:41:03,691 --> 02:41:04,530
But what it is,
is,

3416
02:41:04,531 --> 02:41:05,364
is saying that we can all,
we can all figure out a better way to 

3417
02:41:08,401 --> 02:41:12,750
navigate this.
Then the shitty way that racists and bad

3418
02:41:12,751 --> 02:41:14,000
people have done in the past.
Right.

3419
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:16,420
You know,
it was kind of racist.

3420
02:41:17,260 --> 02:41:18,093
I was.
I wanted to put African Americans in my 

3421
02:41:20,740 --> 02:41:22,520
Christmas village.
Good.

3422
02:41:22,840 --> 02:41:27,840
And you go online and try and look up 
African American figurines for whatever.

3423
02:41:30,280 --> 02:41:31,990
It's.
It's not good.

3424
02:41:33,100 --> 02:41:37,640
They haven't not yet woke.
You've got there are.

3425
02:41:38,070 --> 02:41:41,440
There are prisoners.
There's prisoners.

3426
02:41:41,620 --> 02:41:42,453
There's like worker,
like there's not a lot of like just 

3427
02:41:44,711 --> 02:41:46,970
regular families.
There's definitely a lot.

3428
02:41:47,490 --> 02:41:48,600
Wait a minute.
White people.

3429
02:41:48,790 --> 02:41:49,630
Okay,
let's,

3430
02:41:49,631 --> 02:41:50,464
let's get this.
Let's get this before we look it up 

3431
02:41:52,440 --> 02:41:54,240
because this might be one of the 
untapped things.

3432
02:41:54,241 --> 02:41:59,241
If you've got to get outraged about.
Is it possible that you can buy ceramics

3433
02:42:00,550 --> 02:42:01,383
slave?

3434
02:42:02,790 --> 02:42:04,440
Yes.
You think so?

3435
02:42:04,980 --> 02:42:07,590
Well through a store,
maybe not on the Internet.

3436
02:42:07,710 --> 02:42:09,560
Ebay for sure.
Really?

3437
02:42:09,710 --> 02:42:13,410
Yes.
You know how much stuff was put out into

3438
02:42:13,411 --> 02:42:14,244
the culture of like a Alfalfa kind of 
representations of kids and slave 

3439
02:42:21,601 --> 02:42:23,160
children.
And how about that?

3440
02:42:23,190 --> 02:42:24,023
There was,
I mean I went through my grandmother's 

3441
02:42:26,070 --> 02:42:26,903
like keepsakes at one point,
like a shoe box of stuff and she just 

3442
02:42:29,881 --> 02:42:30,714
had a postcard from her friend.
It was to like black kids eating 

3443
02:42:33,661 --> 02:42:35,770
watermelons and I was like,
grandma,

3444
02:42:36,060 --> 02:42:37,920
what the hell is this?
I was like,

3445
02:42:37,921 --> 02:42:38,754
you know,
15.

3446
02:42:38,940 --> 02:42:39,691
She's like,
oh,

3447
02:42:39,691 --> 02:42:43,260
it's just a joke.
But she wasn't it.

3448
02:42:43,740 --> 02:42:45,690
I only bring it up because that was 
circulated,

3449
02:42:45,691 --> 02:42:48,540
that was being pumped out all the time 
in the culture.

3450
02:42:48,541 --> 02:42:53,080
So there's definitely stuff you can get 
second hand on.

3451
02:42:53,470 --> 02:42:54,303
Jamie's got a big smile on his face,
a lot of different slave stuff like 

3452
02:42:58,191 --> 02:43:01,460
Roman slaves,
slaves that like put long as their white

3453
02:43:01,461 --> 02:43:02,294
slaves were good there.
You pay me some Roman slaves that 

3454
02:43:04,821 --> 02:43:08,780
address like there were in that girl at 
gladiator movie,

3455
02:43:08,950 --> 02:43:09,783
right?
Yeah,

3456
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:12,130
yeah.
You have to fight

3457
02:43:12,510 --> 02:43:13,960
and I got some here.
Okay.

3458
02:43:13,961 --> 02:43:16,810
So this is non,
it's not American.

3459
02:43:17,080 --> 02:43:19,600
So all those slaves.
So like that's isn't an interesting.

3460
02:43:19,930 --> 02:43:23,360
Like it can't be like it's got to be 
like I didn't do it out.

3461
02:43:23,480 --> 02:43:24,313
Can put them guys.
None of my people made them people 

3462
02:43:27,070 --> 02:43:28,390
slaves fucked up,
bro.

3463
02:43:29,560 --> 02:43:32,050
Right.
Like you have to have Middle Eastern,

3464
02:43:32,890 --> 02:43:34,630
ancient starts getting a little 
squirrely.

3465
02:43:34,660 --> 02:43:36,380
100 BC.
Oh,

3466
02:43:36,710 --> 02:43:40,320
the rowers.
But those are white people that gray,

3467
02:43:40,330 --> 02:43:42,130
three d printed that haven't been 
painted.

3468
02:43:42,131 --> 02:43:44,860
They look like Henry Fonda or up to the 
person who buys them,

3469
02:43:44,861 --> 02:43:47,040
you know,
to make them as accurate as they write.

3470
02:43:47,170 --> 02:43:49,900
It looked like Henry Fonda,
Kirk Douglas,

3471
02:43:49,960 --> 02:43:52,570
they had some white ass features.
So white hair,

3472
02:43:52,630 --> 02:43:54,730
they've got white people hair,
you know?

3473
02:43:54,820 --> 02:43:57,510
I mean just put up racist dot.

3474
02:44:00,980 --> 02:44:05,980
Seems like an easy search.
Just stumble across actually.

3475
02:44:08,210 --> 02:44:08,920
Yeah,
you're good.

3476
02:44:08,920 --> 02:44:10,340
Good call.
Good call.

3477
02:44:10,720 --> 02:44:13,330
Yeah.
You just don't want certain things typed

3478
02:44:13,331 --> 02:44:14,770
in now.
Exactly.

3479
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:16,050
You know,
it's like that.

3480
02:44:16,090 --> 02:44:18,130
Like the Alexa thing.
Do you have an Alexa at home?

3481
02:44:18,700 --> 02:44:21,550
Lex is listening right now.
I know that bitch.

3482
02:44:21,580 --> 02:44:23,260
My friend told me like,
you really should.

3483
02:44:23,730 --> 02:44:25,600
You really should take that off.
And I'm like,

3484
02:44:25,601 --> 02:44:26,590
why?
I'm like,

3485
02:44:26,591 --> 02:44:27,880
it's only when I talk.
She's like,

3486
02:44:27,881 --> 02:44:29,140
no,
they listen all the time.

3487
02:44:29,141 --> 02:44:29,974
There was another murder case and they 
confiscated the Alexa because they know 

3488
02:44:33,850 --> 02:44:37,750
the Alexa will have information from the
last four days up to the murder.

3489
02:44:37,810 --> 02:44:39,280
That's crazy.
Yeah,

3490
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:41,860
that's crazy.
But it still plays my music,

3491
02:44:41,861 --> 02:44:43,360
so I'm keeping it.
You don't care.

3492
02:44:43,420 --> 02:44:45,130
You're not killing anybody,
so this is.

3493
02:44:45,131 --> 02:44:47,530
What is this a doll that you could make 
a slave?

3494
02:44:47,560 --> 02:44:50,770
It says it's like say like,
it's not like play,

3495
02:44:50,771 --> 02:44:54,160
play mobile or something to push the 
Lego rip off.

3496
02:44:54,161 --> 02:44:56,110
He's got lego hands chain around his 
neck.

3497
02:44:56,111 --> 02:44:58,000
I'd be mad if I bought that.
I thought it was a Lego.

3498
02:44:58,300 --> 02:45:01,210
That's funny.
Like even if you were a kid,

3499
02:45:01,240 --> 02:45:02,290
your parents,
like you said,

3500
02:45:02,291 --> 02:45:03,940
I want Lego's and your parents brought 
you that.

3501
02:45:03,941 --> 02:45:04,421
You're like,
bitch,

3502
02:45:04,421 --> 02:45:08,680
this is not legos.
Wack ass.

3503
02:45:08,930 --> 02:45:09,763
It's supposed to represent a pirate who 
was formerly a slave in historical 

3504
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:13,633
context.

3505
02:45:16,150 --> 02:45:16,983
It's easy to write that sentence.
Then to make a new lego was a former 

3506
02:45:21,311 --> 02:45:24,490
slave in a historical context on that 
is.

3507
02:45:24,491 --> 02:45:25,324
What does that mean?
I don't know if that means present a 

3508
02:45:27,311 --> 02:45:31,150
pirate who was a former slave in a 
historical context.

3509
02:45:31,151 --> 02:45:33,400
That means he escaped.
I know,

3510
02:45:33,401 --> 02:45:35,610
but it's a weird way to put it,
isn't it?

3511
02:45:36,100 --> 02:45:41,100
Isn't that weird?
It's so ridiculous.

3512
02:45:42,730 --> 02:45:45,280
Racist Toi instructions.
That's the news title.

3513
02:45:46,570 --> 02:45:49,510
The question mark that was fucking 
misleading.

3514
02:45:49,511 --> 02:45:53,320
News titles,
racist toy instruction to them after the

3515
02:45:53,321 --> 02:45:56,770
break and he made a fairly light notice 
how conservative they were.

3516
02:45:57,730 --> 02:45:58,563
You know,
they didn't make them super dark even 

3517
02:46:02,060 --> 02:46:05,160
they knew that was the.
We could get away with that.

3518
02:46:05,470 --> 02:46:09,220
We can make them kind of brownish.
That guy looked like he had a tan.

3519
02:46:09,280 --> 02:46:11,270
It looks like he was a,
like a Spaniard.

3520
02:46:11,600 --> 02:46:12,530
Yeah.
You know,

3521
02:46:12,540 --> 02:46:15,470
like the Nigga Montoya,
you killed my father.

3522
02:46:15,470 --> 02:46:17,450
Prepare to die.
Like that's what he looked like.

3523
02:46:17,451 --> 02:46:18,284
It is.
Like if he looked like a spanner on a 

3524
02:46:21,351 --> 02:46:24,500
holiday where they caught a nice tan.
Are you saying even the racist toy maker

3525
02:46:24,501 --> 02:46:25,221
was like,
no,

3526
02:46:25,221 --> 02:46:27,140
dude,
don't go too dark.

3527
02:46:27,700 --> 02:46:30,020
Yes.
I'm just saying the racist toy maker was

3528
02:46:30,021 --> 02:46:30,621
like,
you know what,

3529
02:46:30,621 --> 02:46:33,360
we just gotta we gotta play it safe.
Go with,

3530
02:46:33,920 --> 02:46:35,170
go with this color.
Yeah.

3531
02:46:35,600 --> 02:46:39,080
Go shoot for Guatemala.
That's it.

3532
02:46:39,170 --> 02:46:41,990
That's all I'm looking for.
Do you go to mass on Christmas?

3533
02:46:42,170 --> 02:46:43,680
No.
No.

3534
02:46:43,700 --> 02:46:44,533
Mass at all.
I go to Willy Wonka's golden chocolate 

3535
02:46:47,091 --> 02:46:48,110
factory.
Wow.

3536
02:46:48,111 --> 02:46:49,910
It's all nonsense.
Why would I do that?

3537
02:46:50,570 --> 02:46:52,650
I'm just asking tradition because he 
grew up there.

3538
02:46:52,670 --> 02:46:53,360
I.
No,

3539
02:46:53,360 --> 02:46:56,360
I never grew up that way.
You did church when you were a kid?

3540
02:46:56,361 --> 02:46:56,901
Yeah,
we did,

3541
02:46:56,901 --> 02:46:59,900
but it was for a very short amount of 
time to say I grew up that way.

3542
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:03,260
It would be hard because it was.
I was out by the time I was out of first

3543
02:47:03,261 --> 02:47:04,850
grade.
Oh yeah.

3544
02:47:04,851 --> 02:47:07,130
We're talking about putting me back in 
for second grade,

3545
02:47:07,131 --> 02:47:11,800
but we moved from New Jersey to San 
Francisco and uh,

3546
02:47:11,960 --> 02:47:15,590
we didn't find a Catholic school on a 
scale of Catholic schools.

3547
02:47:15,591 --> 02:47:18,050
Cost money to went to public school 
after that.

3548
02:47:18,380 --> 02:47:20,780
But I was just done.
I hated it.

3549
02:47:21,560 --> 02:47:23,900
I was in fear of those fucking crazy 
people.

3550
02:47:23,930 --> 02:47:26,090
And your parents didn't take you to 
church or make you go?

3551
02:47:26,180 --> 02:47:27,013
They did a little bit.
I think the idea was back then that if 

3552
02:47:29,061 --> 02:47:31,340
you had kids,
you wanted kids go to Catholic school,

3553
02:47:31,610 --> 02:47:33,560
you know,
there's a lot of people that did that in

3554
02:47:33,561 --> 02:47:34,880
that neighborhood.
When I was little,

3555
02:47:34,881 --> 02:47:38,180
it was just a normal thing you did and 
they were more strict and too.

3556
02:47:38,181 --> 02:47:40,760
Dude,
one thing that was for sure though,

3557
02:47:41,010 --> 02:47:44,210
like I had a conversation with my mom 
bought at once.

3558
02:47:44,510 --> 02:47:45,201
She was like,
you know,

3559
02:47:45,201 --> 02:47:47,540
your grades were way better when you and
you're a Catholic school.

3560
02:47:47,570 --> 02:47:48,141
And I was like,
yeah,

3561
02:47:48,141 --> 02:47:50,990
because it was fucking terrified to get 
wrong.

3562
02:47:51,020 --> 02:47:52,700
They beat the shit out of you want to 
live like that.

3563
02:47:52,701 --> 02:47:54,980
They never beat me.
Then I definitely threatened me.

3564
02:47:55,100 --> 02:47:55,761
Really?
Yeah.

3565
02:47:55,761 --> 02:47:57,560
They threatened to make me sit on a 
nail,

3566
02:47:58,140 --> 02:48:00,220
going to have to sit on a nail and the 
uh,

3567
02:48:00,230 --> 02:48:02,180
in the closet.
Stay here all night.

3568
02:48:02,181 --> 02:48:03,014
I hope you brought your blanket.
They're like really mean when you're 

3569
02:48:05,001 --> 02:48:06,860
like a little six year old kid,
like,

3570
02:48:06,861 --> 02:48:08,660
that's fucked up.
It's just a weird,

3571
02:48:08,960 --> 02:48:09,793
oh,
we stuck with these people for nine 

3572
02:48:11,271 --> 02:48:16,160
months and to also for me it's like my 
parents were splitting up at the time,

3573
02:48:16,520 --> 02:48:20,900
so it was very confusing and then I 
wanted things to have order to them,

3574
02:48:20,901 --> 02:48:22,670
so I wanted God to make sense.

3575
02:48:23,060 --> 02:48:26,800
I remember annoying people with that,
like six years old.

3576
02:48:27,120 --> 02:48:29,390
I didn't know any people talking about 
what God wants.

3577
02:48:29,990 --> 02:48:30,823
What do you mean?
Like you,

3578
02:48:31,010 --> 02:48:32,750
God says this,
God wants that.

3579
02:48:32,770 --> 02:48:33,470
Like I would say that,
Oh,

3580
02:48:33,470 --> 02:48:34,303
you would bug six years old because I 
was a little kid who's dealing with my 

3581
02:48:37,401 --> 02:48:40,390
parents splitting up and there didn't 
seem to be any order in the world and it

3582
02:48:40,391 --> 02:48:41,630
was very nervous.
Right?

3583
02:48:42,050 --> 02:48:44,960
So when I find when I went to Catholic 
school,

3584
02:48:44,961 --> 02:48:46,060
when I first got there,
I was,

3585
02:48:46,110 --> 02:48:48,350
I was happy that I was going to go to 
Catholic school,

3586
02:48:48,560 --> 02:48:53,560
but then as I experienced it at six 
years old,

3587
02:48:55,970 --> 02:48:57,290
I started going,
this is ridiculous.

3588
02:48:57,291 --> 02:48:58,540
This doesn't make any sense.
I'm like,

3589
02:48:58,550 --> 02:49:00,140
first of all,
these people are so mean.

3590
02:49:00,570 --> 02:49:02,930
They're,
they're obviously being mean and nasty.

3591
02:49:02,931 --> 02:49:03,764
They're not comforting.
And I was seeking as a six year old 

3592
02:49:05,751 --> 02:49:07,740
comparing them to weigh like my was.

3593
02:49:07,750 --> 02:49:08,583
My mother was like,
these are these ladies were nasty being 

3594
02:49:11,590 --> 02:49:12,720
so mean and I'm like,
these,

3595
02:49:12,721 --> 02:49:14,340
they don't represent God.
And I was like,

3596
02:49:14,341 --> 02:49:15,174
this is crazy.
And then you could see kids getting in 

3597
02:49:18,301 --> 02:49:19,134
trouble because their parents hadn't 
paid for their lunch or these and there 

3598
02:49:21,580 --> 02:49:22,413
was like this really,
you tell your father to get that money 

3599
02:49:24,901 --> 02:49:25,734
in.
Like there was a weirdness to it that 

3600
02:49:27,061 --> 02:49:27,894
just didn't seem loving or it didn't 
seem like what I thought of when I 

3601
02:49:30,781 --> 02:49:31,530
thought of,
you know,

3602
02:49:31,530 --> 02:49:34,500
Christ and when I thought of it seemed 
to me like,

3603
02:49:34,530 --> 02:49:37,170
oh no,
this is a dark little trap.

3604
02:49:37,890 --> 02:49:38,723
Get sucked into.
So that's what's remarkable about that 

3605
02:49:41,371 --> 02:49:45,420
is not just the age but that you went 
from a really,

3606
02:49:45,421 --> 02:49:46,254
really meeting it in a very real way 
because what was happening with your 

3607
02:49:48,271 --> 02:49:53,010
family to like normally you wouldn't 
turn that quickly.

3608
02:49:53,150 --> 02:49:55,950
Like within a year.
It sounds like by the time I was.

3609
02:49:56,500 --> 02:49:57,333
Yeah,
it was over by the time I was out of 

3610
02:49:58,771 --> 02:49:59,604
there.
Usually that change doesn't happen for 

3611
02:50:01,290 --> 02:50:02,123
15,
20 years outside of beating me or doing 

3612
02:50:06,091 --> 02:50:07,510
something sexual to me,
the,

3613
02:50:07,520 --> 02:50:09,990
this,
the mind fuck of dealing with those mean

3614
02:50:09,991 --> 02:50:13,380
nasty ladies.
Scared the shit out of me were crying.

3615
02:50:13,381 --> 02:50:15,300
They were calling me a baby because I 
was crying.

3616
02:50:15,710 --> 02:50:16,800
I was like,
Whoa,

3617
02:50:16,920 --> 02:50:17,753
just not knowing how to deal with human 
being when you're a six year old and 

3618
02:50:20,191 --> 02:50:22,620
this is going down and you're like,
what have I done?

3619
02:50:22,621 --> 02:50:23,454
Yeah.
Like I went from always being with my 

3620
02:50:24,991 --> 02:50:27,840
mom or being with my grandma,
my grandfather.

3621
02:50:27,841 --> 02:50:28,674
I was like,
everything was cool and then all the 

3622
02:50:29,461 --> 02:50:31,800
sudden you go in school and this is what
you're doing in school.

3623
02:50:31,910 --> 02:50:34,010
I didn't go to kindergarten.
I went to first grade.

3624
02:50:34,010 --> 02:50:34,843
It was the first thing I went to,
so all of a sudden the first grade is 

3625
02:50:37,231 --> 02:50:40,170
like instantaneously being connected to 
these crazy ladies.

3626
02:50:40,260 --> 02:50:41,220
Jesus.
I was like,

3627
02:50:41,250 --> 02:50:42,830
oh no,
poor.

3628
02:50:42,870 --> 02:50:43,703
And then I would think about them.
I don't think we'll kind of like 

3629
02:50:48,250 --> 02:50:49,083
thinking about why this will mean.
I remember being six years old thinking 

3630
02:50:51,061 --> 02:50:52,520
this right.
I'm just like,

3631
02:50:52,590 --> 02:50:54,510
nobody probably loves them.
Like they don't get.

3632
02:50:54,600 --> 02:50:57,900
They don't have a family.
You have a boyfriend.

3633
02:50:58,620 --> 02:51:00,120
I didn't think at the time they don't 
have a girlfriend,

3634
02:51:00,121 --> 02:51:03,540
but maybe they do Holla,
but for sure they didn't.

3635
02:51:03,870 --> 02:51:06,540
The whole thing was that they didn't 
know.

3636
02:51:06,630 --> 02:51:09,240
They didn't have anything.
No connection with another human being.

3637
02:51:09,430 --> 02:51:12,990
What would it be?
Lonelier or more angered inducing.

3638
02:51:13,440 --> 02:51:14,460
Yeah.
It was just dark.

3639
02:51:14,550 --> 02:51:16,200
There weren't.
There weren't loving people.

3640
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:19,410
You know any of your children.
They ask about it.

3641
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:20,910
They didn't even bring it up.
We,

3642
02:51:20,990 --> 02:51:24,970
we've talked about God and I.
My.

3643
02:51:25,040 --> 02:51:29,460
My basic take is Jordan Peterson said 
something really lovely.

3644
02:51:29,820 --> 02:51:34,820
He said he behaves as if God is real.
He behaves as if God exists.

3645
02:51:35,790 --> 02:51:36,623
Interesting.
Not that he believes God exists because 

3646
02:51:38,010 --> 02:51:41,490
that's sort of a.
it's a bit of an intellectual trap where

3647
02:51:41,630 --> 02:51:43,020
you say,
do you believe God exists?

3648
02:51:43,021 --> 02:51:43,780
Like,
okay,

3649
02:51:43,780 --> 02:51:46,500
define God.
Then you're in the weeds.

3650
02:51:46,540 --> 02:51:48,240
Yeah.
Because do you think that.

3651
02:51:48,241 --> 02:51:50,040
I think that there's a city in the 
clouds.

3652
02:51:50,130 --> 02:51:51,620
No,
I don't right now.

3653
02:51:51,640 --> 02:51:54,390
I don't do.
What do you think that there's an energy

3654
02:51:54,391 --> 02:51:55,224
like we were talking.
Is it possible that there's something 

3655
02:51:57,451 --> 02:51:58,650
bigger than all of this thing?
Well,

3656
02:51:58,651 --> 02:52:01,980
this bigger than everything.
Like if you talk to an aunt and said,

3657
02:52:01,981 --> 02:52:03,000
hey man,
do you think their cities,

3658
02:52:03,001 --> 02:52:04,550
its skyscrapers and airplanes,
like,

3659
02:52:04,560 --> 02:52:06,170
what are you fucking moron?

3660
02:52:06,200 --> 02:52:07,001
Get out of here,
bitch.

3661
02:52:07,001 --> 02:52:07,834
I'm trying to drag this dead bug around 
talking anyway for your fucking galaxy 

3662
02:52:12,191 --> 02:52:13,024
talk universe talk.
Get the fuck out of here with your five 

3663
02:52:15,401 --> 02:52:18,190
g pitch at a time.
Dragging this bug.

3664
02:52:19,690 --> 02:52:20,523
I mean in our perspective,
when we're talking about things like 

3665
02:52:25,600 --> 02:52:26,920
we're.
We're so small,

3666
02:52:27,240 --> 02:52:31,570
we're the way we interface with reality.
So crude even though it's amazing.

3667
02:52:32,110 --> 02:52:32,943
Yeah,
but I liked the idea of the not going 

3668
02:52:35,381 --> 02:52:38,680
into the whole intellectual discussion 
about God,

3669
02:52:38,681 --> 02:52:40,420
but just like just,
you know,

3670
02:52:41,140 --> 02:52:43,180
who knows,
just kind of act like he does exist.

3671
02:52:43,210 --> 02:52:44,620
It's a great way to do it.
Does make you.

3672
02:52:44,621 --> 02:52:47,830
It does make you act a little kinder.
Yeah.

3673
02:52:48,140 --> 02:52:49,900
It's like a parent figure.
It's like,

3674
02:52:49,930 --> 02:52:50,763
okay,
we're not going to do this because it's 

3675
02:52:52,301 --> 02:52:53,410
going to make them unhappy.

3676
02:52:53,670 --> 02:52:58,080
I try to do what are the,
like when I'm at my best,

3677
02:52:58,170 --> 02:53:00,630
I try to treat people as if they're me 
living another life.

3678
02:53:01,110 --> 02:53:03,140
Treat.
Treat people as if they're just,

3679
02:53:03,300 --> 02:53:06,540
you know,
don't think people as a bother or don't.

3680
02:53:06,570 --> 02:53:08,010
And it's hard to do.
It's hard to do,

3681
02:53:08,011 --> 02:53:08,844
especially when you're busy or when you 
have your kids with you or when you're 

3682
02:53:11,091 --> 02:53:13,710
trying to get something done.
It's hard to do.

3683
02:53:14,010 --> 02:53:14,843
I try and walk,
walk around thinking everybody is 

3684
02:53:17,550 --> 02:53:19,970
drowning it insecurity,
right?

3685
02:53:20,430 --> 02:53:25,430
That really kind of makes me give people
a pass in the biggest and smallest ways.

3686
02:53:27,900 --> 02:53:32,010
Everybody when you see people hustling,
do whenever businessman,

3687
02:53:32,330 --> 02:53:33,163
businesswoman,
looks like she's on top of her game 

3688
02:53:35,430 --> 02:53:36,750
person,
like on the subway,

3689
02:53:36,751 --> 02:53:37,584
who was obviously going someplace.
They don't want to go with no money in 

3690
02:53:39,511 --> 02:53:40,344
their pocket.
If you realize we're all just drowning 

3691
02:53:44,041 --> 02:53:44,874
and insecurity,
it just makes you just give them a 

3692
02:53:47,821 --> 02:53:52,800
little bit of a a pass that that's been 
where my head's at,

3693
02:53:52,801 --> 02:53:53,634
been at lately.
That's a great place to keep your head 

3694
02:53:55,920 --> 02:53:58,710
because we all are.
Everyone's balled up everyone.

3695
02:53:58,711 --> 02:54:01,170
Even the person you admire the most is 
like,

3696
02:54:01,190 --> 02:54:02,700
ah Ha.
Well,

3697
02:54:02,740 --> 02:54:03,573
you know we were talking about earlier 
about the traps that you fall into is 

3698
02:54:05,920 --> 02:54:06,753
you're trying to achieve and do things.
You're also fall into traps even when 

3699
02:54:09,611 --> 02:54:13,730
things that you love and you can get so 
caught up in a,

3700
02:54:13,860 --> 02:54:14,693
you know,
the things that you love that you kind 

3701
02:54:16,811 --> 02:54:21,460
of forget to keep your,
you know,

3702
02:54:21,470 --> 02:54:22,240
you're,
you're,

3703
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:23,110
you're,
you're,

3704
02:54:23,170 --> 02:54:24,003
when you're at your best.
What feeling or keep that in close 

3705
02:54:26,561 --> 02:54:27,500
range.
Yeah.

3706
02:54:27,560 --> 02:54:28,393
I feel like getting away from you 
because you're too tired because you're 

3707
02:54:30,581 --> 02:54:33,460
working too much because he pulled that 
back.

3708
02:54:33,540 --> 02:54:34,210
Yeah,
keep.

3709
02:54:34,210 --> 02:54:37,390
Keep it at close range where you are 
operating at your best,

3710
02:54:37,420 --> 02:54:39,310
but be respectful of that.
Right,

3711
02:54:39,311 --> 02:54:41,470
and I think this is something that I've 
been guilty of in the past.

3712
02:54:41,830 --> 02:54:45,850
I wasn't respectful of the energy that's
required to be at your best.

3713
02:54:46,400 --> 02:54:49,210
I just figured I'll just do all these 
other things.

3714
02:54:49,230 --> 02:54:50,710
Yeah,
but you only.

3715
02:54:50,800 --> 02:54:51,633
I really firmly believe you only have so
much bandwidth in a day and this is 

3716
02:54:54,760 --> 02:54:57,610
coming from a person who pushes their 
bandwidth too hard all the time.

3717
02:54:58,060 --> 02:55:01,660
I think you only have so much in a day 
and when you get to a certain state,

3718
02:55:02,590 --> 02:55:03,423
you up diminishing a lot and then I 
think you want up diminishing a lot of 

3719
02:55:07,791 --> 02:55:09,230
the.
All the other things that you do,

3720
02:55:09,350 --> 02:55:11,420
like if you.
If you have like seven things cooking in

3721
02:55:11,421 --> 02:55:13,940
the background on your phone,
it's not going to move as fast.

3722
02:55:14,230 --> 02:55:16,850
Allegedly actually does work that were 
some computers,

3723
02:55:17,390 --> 02:55:19,640
but people do that too.
You have too many things.

3724
02:55:19,641 --> 02:55:20,474
Cooking.

3725
02:55:20,490 --> 02:55:21,990
Yeah.
We all do all the time.

3726
02:55:21,991 --> 02:55:26,370
All the time and then you take 20 
minutes of transcendental meditation and

3727
02:55:26,371 --> 02:55:31,371
take your nervous system and put it on 
restart to and just let it wash out.

3728
02:55:33,060 --> 02:55:34,720
You hypnotize me Bro.
This thing in hand,

3729
02:55:34,721 --> 02:55:36,840
it's freaking me out.
Let it wash out.

3730
02:55:37,140 --> 02:55:38,400
Twenty minutes.
Okay.

3731
02:55:38,490 --> 02:55:40,440
Because we're all under that all the 
time.

3732
02:55:40,441 --> 02:55:41,274
One hundred percent frazzled.
No matter how hard you're pushing or 

3733
02:55:44,400 --> 02:55:48,090
just coasting.
Three o'clock in the afternoon,

3734
02:55:48,091 --> 02:55:49,110
2:00
in the afternoon,

3735
02:55:49,111 --> 02:55:50,340
4:00
in the afternoon.

3736
02:55:50,610 --> 02:55:52,260
That nervous system is shot,
right?

3737
02:55:52,450 --> 02:55:54,040
We're all the same.
How do you.

3738
02:55:54,070 --> 02:55:55,590
Twenty minutes,
what do you do?

3739
02:55:55,980 --> 02:55:56,813
Talk me through it.
You take your nervous system and it's 

3740
02:55:58,830 --> 02:55:59,663
the result of it is you come out and 
you've rebooted the system and you can 

3741
02:56:04,321 --> 02:56:07,350
now have a good part of the second part 
of your day.

3742
02:56:07,420 --> 02:56:09,670
Do you have a technique used?
Do you use an APP?

3743
02:56:09,810 --> 02:56:10,950
You know,
I went to.

3744
02:56:12,050 --> 02:56:15,300
I went to a transcendental meditation 
teacher.

3745
02:56:15,430 --> 02:56:19,410
Oh,
and in without the hippy dippy.

3746
02:56:20,250 --> 02:56:24,420
That's the biggest part of it.
It literally makes you realize just what

3747
02:56:24,421 --> 02:56:25,254
you said.
We're all just frazzled and running out 

3748
02:56:26,791 --> 02:56:28,080
of steam.
At a certain point,

3749
02:56:28,680 --> 02:56:29,513
your nervous system is shot.
All that stuff that's happened just 

3750
02:56:32,551 --> 02:56:35,010
between 7:00
and 3:00,

3751
02:56:35,011 --> 02:56:35,844
whatever would happen.
You're that nervous system has been 

3752
02:56:37,921 --> 02:56:40,620
dealing with a ton of stimulus all day 
long.

3753
02:56:41,670 --> 02:56:46,670
That meditation gives you a reboot and 
you can it.

3754
02:56:47,100 --> 02:56:51,960
It's like a needed thing that's better 
than sleep that you.

3755
02:56:52,150 --> 02:56:57,150
You're actually a yearns for.
I'm telling you,

3756
02:56:57,180 --> 02:57:02,180
since I really started dialing it in and
did it in the best way I can describe it

3757
02:57:03,211 --> 02:57:06,780
as that.
It added another four hours to my day.

3758
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:08,340
Whoa.
Yeah.

3759
02:57:09,570 --> 02:57:10,403
How so?
Because I would just be limping across 

3760
02:57:13,171 --> 02:57:14,970
the finish line.
I'd be exhausted,

3761
02:57:14,971 --> 02:57:19,860
I'd be trying to do and with motivation 
and I work really hard.

3762
02:57:19,861 --> 02:57:20,694
I would push through and get to maybe 
two hours more of what I needed to 

3763
02:57:25,950 --> 02:57:26,783
accomplish.
When you do this effortlessly without 

3764
02:57:31,020 --> 02:57:34,440
struggle,
I'm able to just sell like I did between

3765
02:57:34,680 --> 02:57:37,100
nine and 12 that day.
Really?

3766
02:57:37,200 --> 02:57:39,150
Yes.
A hundred percent.

3767
02:57:39,340 --> 02:57:40,173
Do you think by using this practice your
alleviating tension so you're more 

3768
02:57:45,821 --> 02:57:48,610
efficient with your energy,
like what makes you?

3769
02:57:48,690 --> 02:57:50,220
That's part of it,
but it really is.

3770
02:57:50,880 --> 02:57:51,713
It really is taking this nervous system 
that is dealing with the outside world 

3771
02:57:55,530 --> 02:58:00,530
all the time and just giving it a real 
practical way to shut down flat line and

3772
02:58:05,731 --> 02:58:07,020
then come back on the grid.

3773
02:58:07,410 --> 02:58:10,170
Yeah.
Yeah,

3774
02:58:11,590 --> 02:58:16,420
and it it like your physical body needs 
a rest.

3775
02:58:16,450 --> 02:58:17,283
Your things need to be rebooted.
Your nervous system is kind of this 

3776
02:58:21,251 --> 02:58:24,280
thing that operates all the time that 
we're not really that conscious of.

3777
02:58:24,310 --> 02:58:25,143
We're not really that aware of that.
How hard it's working and this is a way 

3778
02:58:27,941 --> 02:58:31,960
to pay attention to it and give it a 
chance to regenerate.

3779
02:58:32,080 --> 02:58:33,850
That's interesting and it's going to 
been doing this,

3780
02:58:34,200 --> 02:58:37,270
you know,
I meditated for like since college,

3781
02:58:37,271 --> 02:58:42,271
just out of reading books and then 
probably about three years ago,

3782
02:58:43,690 --> 02:58:44,523
uh,
my friend said who always did 

3783
02:58:47,320 --> 02:58:49,300
transcendental meditation.
He said,

3784
02:58:49,330 --> 02:58:51,430
go,
just see if it dials you in.

3785
02:58:52,080 --> 02:58:55,000
It actually the stuff you are doing,
the way you talk about meditating,

3786
02:58:55,001 --> 02:58:55,834
it sounds more laborious.
It sounds like you're doing too much 

3787
02:58:58,181 --> 02:59:00,430
work.
Just go talk to this guy.

3788
02:59:00,460 --> 02:59:03,160
And I did for like three,
four sessions.

3789
02:59:03,160 --> 02:59:03,993
I went and talked to this guy here in la
who was a transcendental meditation 

3790
02:59:07,181 --> 02:59:12,181
teacher and he just explained it,
dialed me in on it.

3791
02:59:12,520 --> 02:59:15,580
And for the last three,
four years I've been just,

3792
02:59:15,610 --> 02:59:18,880
I haven't missed a day and three or four
years.

3793
02:59:18,900 --> 02:59:19,670
Yeah,
every day.

3794
02:59:19,670 --> 02:59:21,520
Every day.
Seven days,

3795
02:59:21,580 --> 02:59:23,080
seven days,
no cheat day.

3796
02:59:23,490 --> 02:59:24,910
Cheat Day.
How long?

3797
02:59:24,911 --> 02:59:25,744
No need for me.
It's the opposite of what you want from 

3798
02:59:27,761 --> 02:59:29,470
a cheat day.
It's like 20 minutes.

3799
02:59:29,740 --> 02:59:32,080
Where if you can get to in,
that's the best.

3800
02:59:32,081 --> 02:59:34,420
If you can get one in the morning and 
one in the afternoon,

3801
02:59:34,990 --> 02:59:36,970
then you're like superman.
Wow.

3802
02:59:37,210 --> 02:59:40,210
But if you can get one in,
I'm telling you,

3803
02:59:40,240 --> 02:59:42,090
start to finish how long?
Twenty,

3804
02:59:42,150 --> 02:59:43,390
20 minutes.
20.

3805
02:59:43,391 --> 02:59:45,130
And you do this everyday.
Everyday.

3806
02:59:46,040 --> 02:59:48,010
Everyday.
Maybe that makes sense man.

3807
02:59:48,220 --> 02:59:50,110
Because a,
it's the things that people remark about

3808
02:59:50,111 --> 02:59:52,570
you is how easy going you are.

3809
02:59:52,630 --> 02:59:54,190
Like the like people have said,
dude,

3810
02:59:54,191 --> 02:59:56,910
I love and Tom Papa was on your podcast 
because it's so easy.

3811
02:59:56,930 --> 02:59:58,990
Go like did you guys Gel so well 
together?

3812
02:59:59,140 --> 03:00:04,140
Flow together.
If you're tuned into president together,

3813
03:00:04,600 --> 03:00:06,070
we're just,
we're both,

3814
03:00:06,340 --> 03:00:10,360
you know,
you're kind of not struggling and that's

3815
03:00:10,361 --> 03:00:13,960
what it teaches you.
You just see this is a big roaring river

3816
03:00:14,950 --> 03:00:16,870
and it lets you just kinda go 
underneath,

3817
03:00:16,871 --> 03:00:18,850
catch your breath and then come back up 
into it.

3818
03:00:19,420 --> 03:00:20,253
Do you feel that way when you exercise?
Do you feel like when you exercise you 

3819
03:00:23,051 --> 03:00:26,140
get into like a zone and you reset your 
brain?

3820
03:00:26,170 --> 03:00:27,850
For sure.
I feel less.

3821
03:00:28,300 --> 03:00:33,300
I feel less depressed when I exercise.
Like if I'm in a funk and I'm like and I

3822
03:00:33,400 --> 03:00:34,690
go for a run,
I'm like,

3823
03:00:34,750 --> 03:00:36,280
my day's different.
Yeah,

3824
03:00:36,281 --> 03:00:37,490
it's weird.
It's almost like a.

3825
03:00:37,550 --> 03:00:39,850
That funk is trying to hold on to 
control too.

3826
03:00:39,851 --> 03:00:40,930
It's weird.
Yeah.

3827
03:00:41,080 --> 03:00:42,890
It's like it's tricking your brain.
Yeah.

3828
03:00:42,910 --> 03:00:44,380
Do you feel like shit.
Today I was like,

3829
03:00:44,410 --> 03:00:46,450
let me just put these God damn shoes on 
and go run.

3830
03:00:46,570 --> 03:00:47,630
Yeah.
You know,

3831
03:00:47,770 --> 03:00:50,080
you feel so good,
but the meditation is different.

3832
03:00:50,650 --> 03:00:54,580
The meditation is like,
the run will give me energy.

3833
03:00:54,581 --> 03:00:56,120
I won't feel so shitty.
I'm like,

3834
03:00:56,340 --> 03:00:57,760
I'm okay.
I feel good.

3835
03:00:57,761 --> 03:00:59,950
I feel alive,
whatever,

3836
03:01:00,310 --> 03:01:01,143
but the meditation in a very subtle way,
five hours later when you're faced with 

3837
03:01:07,601 --> 03:01:08,434
a stressful situation,
you don't feel as stressed as you 

3838
03:01:10,631 --> 03:01:15,100
normally would because it's just you're 
near your nervous system,

3839
03:01:15,101 --> 03:01:17,860
which is very powerful.
Has Been rebooted,

3840
03:01:17,880 --> 03:01:20,410
is now able to go and deal with another 
situation.

3841
03:01:21,970 --> 03:01:23,440
You should go see him.
Okay,

3842
03:01:24,010 --> 03:01:25,480
I'll do it.
I'll give you the name of the guy.

3843
03:01:25,481 --> 03:01:27,130
He's amazing.
I mean,

3844
03:01:27,131 --> 03:01:28,840
he's not amazing.
It's not a guru.

3845
03:01:28,990 --> 03:01:32,200
It's not the one sperm guy.
It is not about him.

3846
03:01:32,201 --> 03:01:34,150
One minute.
It's not about a religion.

3847
03:01:34,151 --> 03:01:34,984
It's not about a people drop of Mush.
Sperm dot does will not give you his 

3848
03:01:38,771 --> 03:01:42,100
sperm.
He's just delivering the message of this

3849
03:01:42,101 --> 03:01:44,110
little practice,
which is very.

3850
03:01:44,130 --> 03:01:47,380
It's not hippy dippy.
It's very practical.

3851
03:01:47,410 --> 03:01:49,510
Practical and can use it.
Yeah.

3852
03:01:49,630 --> 03:01:51,340
It's,
that's the best part of it.

3853
03:01:51,910 --> 03:01:52,743
Would you,
have you tried the tank before in the 

3854
03:01:54,191 --> 03:01:55,300
float tank now?

3855
03:01:55,510 --> 03:01:56,770
Would you be interested in doing it?
You know,

3856
03:01:56,771 --> 03:01:58,540
we have one here.
You can use it anytime you want.

3857
03:01:58,650 --> 03:01:59,483
I would like.
I'd like to hear what your take on it 

3858
03:02:00,701 --> 03:02:01,180
is.
Yeah.

3859
03:02:01,180 --> 03:02:01,871
Especially.
Yeah.

3860
03:02:01,871 --> 03:02:04,900
Especially if you wanted to practice 
those techniques in there.

3861
03:02:04,970 --> 03:02:06,490
Yeah,
I think that'd be really interesting.

3862
03:02:06,870 --> 03:02:08,050
It's crazy environment,
man.

3863
03:02:08,170 --> 03:02:09,010
That would be great.
Yeah,

3864
03:02:09,011 --> 03:02:10,060
you should do it.
I'll do it.

3865
03:02:10,210 --> 03:02:11,230
Yeah,
for sure.

3866
03:02:11,231 --> 03:02:12,340
Not Today.
I'm drunk.

3867
03:02:12,360 --> 03:02:14,240
No,
but there's a,

3868
03:02:14,280 --> 03:02:15,300
there's also,
you know,

3869
03:02:15,310 --> 03:02:17,140
there's a bunch of big places around 
two.

3870
03:02:17,141 --> 03:02:17,974
There's the float lab down in Venice and
they have one at Westwood and then 

3871
03:02:20,990 --> 03:02:21,823
what's the big place that's in Pasadena 
has the biggest one in the world and 

3872
03:02:25,421 --> 03:02:28,400
people that come in like a gym.
Yeah.

3873
03:02:28,520 --> 03:02:31,780
He sign up,
go in there and float password.

3874
03:02:31,930 --> 03:02:33,350
Got a giant.
Just flew.

3875
03:02:33,430 --> 03:02:35,480
Yeah,
just float in Pasedena shoot.

3876
03:02:35,530 --> 03:02:36,363
They don't.
They have like 40 fucking float tanks 

3877
03:02:37,571 --> 03:02:40,930
with some crazy shit.
I don't know how many they have,

3878
03:02:40,990 --> 03:02:43,330
but I think they use all float lab stuff
too.

3879
03:02:43,480 --> 03:02:46,900
That would be cool.
What's another interesting thing?

3880
03:02:47,350 --> 03:02:50,230
If you get the morning one in,
you know how sometimes you wake up,

3881
03:02:50,920 --> 03:02:52,630
you've slept,
you went to bed at 11,

3882
03:02:52,770 --> 03:02:54,190
right?
You're up at seven,

3883
03:02:54,760 --> 03:02:57,670
but you're exhausted because your 
night's sleep is restless.

3884
03:02:57,671 --> 03:02:59,920
You've got up to pee a couple times.
Who knows?

3885
03:03:00,730 --> 03:03:03,430
You look back at your bed.
It was just a disaster.

3886
03:03:05,020 --> 03:03:09,280
You do those 20 minutes before you go 
about your day,

3887
03:03:09,430 --> 03:03:12,100
just before the kids get up,
just get 20 minutes in.

3888
03:03:12,910 --> 03:03:16,540
It's like a you.
It was more valuable than what you tried

3889
03:03:16,541 --> 03:03:17,374
to accomplish in that eight hours 
spinning around in the sheets like 

3890
03:03:21,670 --> 03:03:23,290
especially for someone like you,
right?

3891
03:03:23,291 --> 03:03:25,690
Who's job is to create things.
Yeah.

3892
03:03:25,720 --> 03:03:26,553
Right.
To put your mindset and to put into a 

3893
03:03:27,911 --> 03:03:32,020
particular place is super beneficial if 
you're just creating things all on time.

3894
03:03:32,110 --> 03:03:34,540
Totally,
but it's for everybody.

3895
03:03:34,630 --> 03:03:35,021
Right?
Right,

3896
03:03:35,021 --> 03:03:36,520
right.
It's literally like,

3897
03:03:36,610 --> 03:03:37,443
yeah,
we're all just human beings just 

3898
03:03:39,221 --> 03:03:40,054
struggling everyday going out,
doing all this stuff and it's like you 

3899
03:03:43,001 --> 03:03:47,740
could be a single mom living in the 
city,

3900
03:03:47,860 --> 03:03:50,140
taking the bus to work after dealing 
with your kids and go.

3901
03:03:50,920 --> 03:03:54,170
Her nervous system is being bombarded.
Yeah,

3902
03:03:54,910 --> 03:03:57,980
20 minutes just kind of sit in there

3903
03:03:57,980 --> 03:03:58,813
on the bus.
You could do it on the bus by your with 

3904
03:04:00,951 --> 03:04:05,420
all this other.
It's not a a pristine thing.

3905
03:04:05,450 --> 03:04:08,570
It's not a hippie thing.
It's not an.

3906
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:12,170
I was gonna say elegant,
but it is kind of elegant.

3907
03:04:12,171 --> 03:04:17,171
It's not a special thing.
It really is just like a,

3908
03:04:17,500 --> 03:04:21,590
like a controlled that in a way and 
it'll.

3909
03:04:21,770 --> 03:04:25,670
It just gives you more to go on.
We're all,

3910
03:04:25,730 --> 03:04:27,170
everybody,
no matter what you're creating,

3911
03:04:27,171 --> 03:04:31,070
no matter what you're doing.
We're all under assault all the time,

3912
03:04:31,730 --> 03:04:32,563
right?
Yeah.

3913
03:04:32,690 --> 03:04:33,720
I mean not,
you know,

3914
03:04:34,570 --> 03:04:35,403
don't equate it to war,
but there's like bombardments of energy 

3915
03:04:37,551 --> 03:04:39,410
and stuff that's coming after you all 
the time.

3916
03:04:39,830 --> 03:04:42,380
You have to kind of tend to the system 
that's dealing with it

3917
03:04:42,490 --> 03:04:47,490
that I think anything that gives you a 
perspective reshift or reboot is great.

3918
03:04:47,800 --> 03:04:48,633
Yeah.
Anything,

3919
03:04:48,990 --> 03:04:52,820
whether it's going for a swim in the 
ocean and whatever the fuck it is.

3920
03:04:53,180 --> 03:04:55,460
Something that gives you a perspective 
reboot.

3921
03:04:55,480 --> 03:04:57,860
We,
we get caught in some pretty gross ruts.

3922
03:04:59,270 --> 03:05:01,190
Perspective.
Reboot is a cool way to say it.

3923
03:05:01,250 --> 03:05:02,480
Yeah.
I think um,

3924
03:05:02,900 --> 03:05:07,900
we have these views of the world sort of
we have this,

3925
03:05:09,031 --> 03:05:09,740
um,
these,

3926
03:05:09,740 --> 03:05:12,380
these patterns that we sort of recognize
and we see them,

3927
03:05:12,590 --> 03:05:13,423
they're out there and we get locked into
them and we're just visiting the same 

3928
03:05:16,731 --> 03:05:20,330
websites and seeing the same people and 
doing the same things every day.

3929
03:05:20,750 --> 03:05:22,730
And sometimes you need something 
different.

3930
03:05:23,210 --> 03:05:24,920
Some.
Yeah.

3931
03:05:24,940 --> 03:05:25,773
The knock you out.
You need something that gets you to 

3932
03:05:27,441 --> 03:05:29,980
think about other stuff,
you know,

3933
03:05:29,990 --> 03:05:32,900
maybe it's going to a place that.
This is why I travel so good.

3934
03:05:33,080 --> 03:05:34,790
I used to never get traveled when I was 
a kid.

3935
03:05:34,980 --> 03:05:35,840
Yeah.
That's like,

3936
03:05:35,841 --> 03:05:37,850
what the fuck wants to travel.
I like being home,

3937
03:05:38,330 --> 03:05:39,680
but one of the,
I do like being home,

3938
03:05:39,681 --> 03:05:40,514
but one of the things about travel is it
allows you to experience the feel of 

3939
03:05:43,071 --> 03:05:43,904
someone's culture in real life.
Like you're walking through the streets 

3940
03:05:45,921 --> 03:05:47,210
of Cologne,
Germany,

3941
03:05:47,450 --> 03:05:48,410
like you're like,
wow,

3942
03:05:48,411 --> 03:05:50,420
this is how these people live.
It's crazy.

3943
03:05:50,740 --> 03:05:53,270
We walked through the streets of Rome.
It takes you to of yourself.

3944
03:05:53,300 --> 03:05:54,680
Yeah.
It gives you this.

3945
03:05:55,130 --> 03:05:55,963
First of all,
it gives you this appreciation that 

3946
03:05:57,591 --> 03:06:00,050
there's different rules over here,
but these are still people.

3947
03:06:00,051 --> 03:06:03,880
Modern people just like you and then 
some of your ancestors came from here,

3948
03:06:04,490 --> 03:06:06,080
but here they are where there's 
different rules.

3949
03:06:06,140 --> 03:06:08,780
Millions of millions of them,
and then they got people that are coming

3950
03:06:08,781 --> 03:06:11,180
into them from Africa and it's like,
whoa.

3951
03:06:11,181 --> 03:06:14,420
Like this is crazy.
I guess this whole thing is fascinating.

3952
03:06:14,421 --> 03:06:16,550
This is a.
and then were around,

3953
03:06:16,551 --> 03:06:17,384
you know,
Pompei and you've seen the ruins that 

3954
03:06:19,670 --> 03:06:22,220
mount vesuvius erupted,
killed all these people,

3955
03:06:22,221 --> 03:06:23,870
and you're wandering through all this 
stuff.

3956
03:06:23,871 --> 03:06:25,280
Like this is fascinating.
Yeah.

3957
03:06:25,281 --> 03:06:25,440
Yeah.

3958
03:06:25,440 --> 03:06:26,273
It's a long way from thinking about the 
three apps that you sit on your phone 

3959
03:06:30,121 --> 03:06:30,954
every day and get your news and get your
thing and check your instagram and 

3960
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:33,793
facebook.
That's a whole nother whole nother 

3961
03:06:35,131 --> 03:06:35,964
mindblower Oh my God.
It's a whole universe of other stuff to 

3962
03:06:38,131 --> 03:06:40,830
think about.
That's why I love walking in New York,

3963
03:06:41,100 --> 03:06:41,933
like you have your routines of like 
where you're walking on the other side 

3964
03:06:44,431 --> 03:06:46,380
of the street and go the other 
direction.

3965
03:06:46,500 --> 03:06:48,630
You're a wild man.
It's a whole nother world,

3966
03:06:52,230 --> 03:06:57,230
but really it's just literally like when
you're your run with your dog and you if

3967
03:06:57,541 --> 03:07:01,470
you just look the other way from when 
you normally are like doing your thing.

3968
03:07:02,010 --> 03:07:05,070
It's a whole nother perspective.
It's a whole nother world.

3969
03:07:05,071 --> 03:07:06,470
It's crazy,
right?

3970
03:07:06,630 --> 03:07:08,790
But literally just looking the other 
way,

3971
03:07:08,791 --> 03:07:11,880
running the other direction.
It's this true,

3972
03:07:12,120 --> 03:07:12,953
but look,
it's not a small thing because we liked 

3973
03:07:15,691 --> 03:07:20,370
the order we like that provides calm and
safety.

3974
03:07:20,850 --> 03:07:22,710
If you're just going that same route all
the time,

3975
03:07:23,160 --> 03:07:25,470
but then there's a limit I guess,
and you end up.

3976
03:07:26,190 --> 03:07:29,400
It starts acting negatively on your life

3977
03:07:29,840 --> 03:07:30,673
and your height.
If you're just a constant vagabond 

3978
03:07:31,880 --> 03:07:34,210
traveling around the globe,
that's probably not.

3979
03:07:34,240 --> 03:07:35,480
Not Positive either,
right?

3980
03:07:35,570 --> 03:07:36,830
Yeah.
Always going on.

3981
03:07:37,180 --> 03:07:39,140
Never having a home.
I love home.

3982
03:07:39,440 --> 03:07:40,490
Yeah.
I love home too.

3983
03:07:40,700 --> 03:07:44,270
I love home,
which is so weird in a.

3984
03:07:44,270 --> 03:07:47,840
In a career where we have to travel so 
much.

3985
03:07:48,370 --> 03:07:49,203
Yeah,
but one thing that I love to say like 

3986
03:07:52,220 --> 03:07:53,053
equated to good knievel,
but that there's some weird sort of 

3987
03:07:55,271 --> 03:07:56,104
balance in this life and that we do 
really have to experience negative 

3988
03:07:59,501 --> 03:08:01,960
things to appreciate positive things for
what they really are.

3989
03:08:02,290 --> 03:08:05,020
If everything is positive,
if you're the lottery winner when you're

3990
03:08:05,021 --> 03:08:08,170
five and you win that golden power 
ticket,

3991
03:08:08,171 --> 03:08:09,550
$500 million.
Jamey.

3992
03:08:09,551 --> 03:08:11,530
When you're five years old and it's all 
made,

3993
03:08:12,070 --> 03:08:14,500
then you don't have to imagine that you 
growing up,

3994
03:08:14,530 --> 03:08:15,490
it ruin your life.
Like,

3995
03:08:15,560 --> 03:08:16,570
listen,
little Tommy,

3996
03:08:16,571 --> 03:08:18,540
you never have to work again.
It would ruin your life.

3997
03:08:18,550 --> 03:08:21,220
Talking about grandpa bought a lottery 
ticket when you were five.

3998
03:08:21,880 --> 03:08:23,620
If you'd be so nice to give us some of 
that money,

3999
03:08:23,621 --> 03:08:26,440
that would be nice.
But if you have $790,

4000
03:08:26,441 --> 03:08:27,850
million dollars,
like what?

4001
03:08:28,510 --> 03:08:29,031
GRANDPA?
Yeah,

4002
03:08:29,031 --> 03:08:31,540
GRANDPA put it in a trust and it's all 
yours and you can have it.

4003
03:08:31,710 --> 03:08:32,950
Yeah,
when you turn 18,

4004
03:08:32,980 --> 03:08:35,930
but you could give us some of it now and
just sign right here.

4005
03:08:36,340 --> 03:08:39,250
Come on Bailey.
Be fucked.

4006
03:08:39,280 --> 03:08:41,950
Imagine growing up being like richie 
rich.

4007
03:08:42,750 --> 03:08:44,080
Yeah,
you'd be a mess.

4008
03:08:44,110 --> 03:08:45,250
You'd be like,
what the fuck?

4009
03:08:45,300 --> 03:08:46,133
Be a massive,
a face full of cocaine chasing this 

4010
03:08:48,241 --> 03:08:51,780
feelings that you can't get just from 
practical everyday work.

4011
03:08:51,840 --> 03:08:52,560
Cute.
Imagine.

4012
03:08:52,560 --> 03:08:54,480
Remember that fucking commercial?
The cartoon.

4013
03:08:54,481 --> 03:08:55,700
Richie rich.
Oh yeah.

4014
03:08:56,220 --> 03:08:58,560
Comic books everyday.
The day.

4015
03:08:58,950 --> 03:09:01,290
Every year at the Jersey shore.
I get his comic books.

4016
03:09:01,291 --> 03:09:02,190
He always had new ones.

4017
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:04,960
That's got to be one of the weirdest 
cartoons of all time.

4018
03:09:05,260 --> 03:09:08,140
A really rich kid.
Really when all the money in the world,

4019
03:09:08,530 --> 03:09:10,390
all the poor kids would read it and go,
fuck,

4020
03:09:10,391 --> 03:09:11,950
I wish I was richie rich,
man.

4021
03:09:11,951 --> 03:09:13,950
This guy's gotta.
Go Cart.

4022
03:09:14,230 --> 03:09:16,210
It will get them seeing their Scott 
Bachelor's.

4023
03:09:16,211 --> 03:09:20,200
He's got a Sunday chocolates.
I want my little dear boy.

4024
03:09:20,230 --> 03:09:24,280
Comfy while he takes a nap t and he 
says,

4025
03:09:24,310 --> 03:09:26,260
oh,
well thanks mom.

4026
03:09:26,380 --> 03:09:30,400
Thanks candy.
And there's a butler dressed like that.

4027
03:09:30,401 --> 03:09:33,040
Dude with the tailcoat coincidentally,
but look at it,

4028
03:09:33,180 --> 03:09:34,500
but look at it,
look at the name of it.

4029
03:09:34,501 --> 03:09:37,050
It's richie rich,
the poor little rich boy,

4030
03:09:37,440 --> 03:09:38,430
right.
That's what it was.

4031
03:09:38,520 --> 03:09:39,730
The poor little rich boy because he's.

4032
03:09:41,020 --> 03:09:43,540
Because he's not happy like he's really 
said,

4033
03:09:43,541 --> 03:09:44,374
well,
first of all,

4034
03:09:44,440 --> 03:09:48,390
look at the size of his ankles.
Kids got gout.

4035
03:09:48,530 --> 03:09:50,860
He's got the gap.
Check out for sure,

4036
03:09:51,190 --> 03:09:54,010
but the dude who's got the Ice Sundae,
he's the

4037
03:09:54,010 --> 03:09:56,210
same.
Dressed the same as.

4038
03:09:56,260 --> 03:09:57,093
Go back to the picture please.
The dude with the ice cream Sundae is 

4039
03:10:00,560 --> 03:10:01,640
the very top.
Yeah.

4040
03:10:01,930 --> 03:10:06,930
He's wearing the same clothes that were 
mocking him and he's wearing the tails.

4041
03:10:08,050 --> 03:10:10,340
The whole dot.
James got the whole getup.

4042
03:10:10,530 --> 03:10:12,340
The 18 hundreds get up.
See?

4043
03:10:12,490 --> 03:10:13,323
I used to think about a guy like that,
like in the shining or something like 

4044
03:10:15,791 --> 03:10:16,624
that.
Then there's some Butler and I would 

4045
03:10:17,801 --> 03:10:18,221
think of,
oh,

4046
03:10:18,221 --> 03:10:19,054
that's a proper man.
That's a man that he's the guy from the 

4047
03:10:21,881 --> 03:10:25,420
shining and he's just gonna come over 
and be proper.

4048
03:10:25,460 --> 03:10:26,950
But yeah,
normal normal.

4049
03:10:26,951 --> 03:10:29,840
But then as I got older I realized,
oh no,

4050
03:10:29,841 --> 03:10:30,674
no,
no,

4051
03:10:30,730 --> 03:10:31,563
that's a guy.
But it's just a guy and this guy has 

4052
03:10:33,551 --> 03:10:34,384
this fucked up job.
Whereas to dress like he lives in 

4053
03:10:36,881 --> 03:10:39,860
another time period and the weight on 
all these rich white people.

4054
03:10:39,861 --> 03:10:40,694
Like what?
In the.

4055
03:10:40,990 --> 03:10:45,990
It's a tortured man right there.
If you were a serious black rapper,

4056
03:10:46,600 --> 03:10:48,790
like one of them guys with diamond 
teeth,

4057
03:10:49,330 --> 03:10:52,210
wouldn't you get a diamond white 
servant?

4058
03:10:52,870 --> 03:10:54,560
Like that guy?
Yeah.

4059
03:10:54,561 --> 03:10:56,840
That's good.
Cut All white Butler's.

4060
03:10:56,860 --> 03:10:59,980
Yes.
I'll wipe Butler's just like super,

4061
03:11:00,730 --> 03:11:03,270
super high end guys from England.
Yeah.

4062
03:11:03,310 --> 03:11:05,100
Professionals.
It's true.

4063
03:11:05,110 --> 03:11:08,980
I don't think he's a professional boxer.
Hilarious.

4064
03:11:09,070 --> 03:11:12,040
I love diamond teeth.
Yeah.

4065
03:11:12,290 --> 03:11:13,061
Little Richie.
Rich.

4066
03:11:13,061 --> 03:11:16,570
He wasn't happy.
Was Cadbury Cadbury?

4067
03:11:16,600 --> 03:11:19,450
Perfect.
He had perfect butler.

4068
03:11:21,640 --> 03:11:24,690
Cadbury was his butler.
Oh,

4069
03:11:25,130 --> 03:11:26,170
perfect.
Butler.

4070
03:11:26,230 --> 03:11:28,360
Bring over that Sunday.
Look at that other poor kid.

4071
03:11:28,361 --> 03:11:32,290
He's all deformed and shit.
He looks like he's evolving.

4072
03:11:32,680 --> 03:11:36,700
Another kid looks like his grandparents 
were Australia.

4073
03:11:36,710 --> 03:11:38,600
Pithy.
Kiss enriched.

4074
03:11:38,770 --> 03:11:39,311
Rich.
Just like,

4075
03:11:39,311 --> 03:11:40,144
oh,
let's show you what it's like to be 

4076
03:11:40,800 --> 03:11:41,291
rich,
rich,

4077
03:11:41,291 --> 03:11:41,810
rich,
rich,

4078
03:11:41,810 --> 03:11:42,643
rich.
I never had these neanderthal looking 

4079
03:11:45,281 --> 03:11:47,520
fella.
I never sat at a table before.

4080
03:11:48,130 --> 03:11:49,470
Blow that picture.
That kid again out.

4081
03:11:49,570 --> 03:11:51,760
Tell me.
It doesn't look me into tall as he is.

4082
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:54,400
He has a monkey face.
Straight up does.

4083
03:11:54,850 --> 03:11:57,190
He does.
He's got totaled neanderthal things.

4084
03:11:57,191 --> 03:11:59,500
Lawyers are real low,
isn't quite big enough,

4085
03:11:59,530 --> 03:12:02,380
but they definitely gave him some odd 
features.

4086
03:12:03,190 --> 03:12:04,580
He does look terrible.
Yeah.

4087
03:12:04,590 --> 03:12:06,420
He's got a bald patch in the back of his
head.

4088
03:12:06,430 --> 03:12:11,430
We'll see you in a bulletproof scalpel 
or a little guy or a little fellow.

4089
03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:12,753
Who was his name.

4090
03:12:12,820 --> 03:12:13,653
Oh,
no,

4091
03:12:13,810 --> 03:12:16,030
fuck face.
It's really rich.

4092
03:12:16,090 --> 03:12:21,090
Cadbury and his friend.
Fuck face girlfriends.

4093
03:12:21,941 --> 03:12:25,580
He's going to get all the girls.
Yeah.

4094
03:12:25,780 --> 03:12:28,000
That is hilarious.
At the bills I.

4095
03:12:28,200 --> 03:12:29,620
So it was one of them.
His mom,

4096
03:12:29,680 --> 03:12:31,390
the lady with the blonde hairs.
His mom,

4097
03:12:31,660 --> 03:12:33,080
right?
Oh,

4098
03:12:33,100 --> 03:12:34,720
but the girl with the blonde hairs,
his mom.

4099
03:12:34,750 --> 03:12:36,920
Right?
Little Auto Lot.

4100
03:12:36,930 --> 03:12:41,500
A lot of their names are written down.
Little Lotta little glow.

4101
03:12:41,590 --> 03:12:42,423
Christ.
They're all his girlfriend's little lot 

4102
03:12:43,781 --> 03:12:44,900
of get it.
She's big.

4103
03:12:45,370 --> 03:12:46,360
Get it.
I'm not.

4104
03:12:46,420 --> 03:12:47,650
I'm.
I swear to God.

4105
03:12:47,651 --> 03:12:50,440
I'm having flashbacks from every summer 
as a child.

4106
03:12:50,770 --> 03:12:51,603
I'd go to this bookstore and their big 
comic books and I buy these little rich 

4107
03:12:56,210 --> 03:12:58,400
richie rich comic books and go home and 
read them.

4108
03:12:58,570 --> 03:13:03,320
Lucky he's looking at his shadow is a 
dollar symbols for shadow.

4109
03:13:04,480 --> 03:13:06,360
When did,
when he's got a girlfriend,

4110
03:13:07,070 --> 03:13:09,280
when is a bad ass rapper?
Gonna.

4111
03:13:09,290 --> 03:13:12,260
Recreate this picture for the covers 
album.

4112
03:13:12,410 --> 03:13:14,540
I think that would be perfect for like 
Gucci Mane.

4113
03:13:15,020 --> 03:13:15,980
Richie rich.
Yo.

4114
03:13:16,070 --> 03:13:19,920
Come on and tell me that wouldn't be 
having them walk away cause he's.

4115
03:13:20,090 --> 03:13:20,923
Oh,
he might've already done it because it 

4116
03:13:22,221 --> 03:13:23,930
takes a lot of pictures with his lovely 
wife.

4117
03:13:24,320 --> 03:13:25,153
There'll be a perfect picture for Gucci 
Mane and his wife honey dollar bill 

4118
03:13:29,331 --> 03:13:31,280
behind them.
Hollow dollar bail.

4119
03:13:31,281 --> 03:13:35,480
Y'all check.
It's so weird.

4120
03:13:35,481 --> 03:13:36,314
Right?
What a crazy idea for a comic strip bay 

4121
03:13:38,481 --> 03:13:40,040
area rapper named Richie rich.
So.

4122
03:13:40,130 --> 03:13:40,963
Oh,
there you go.

4123
03:13:41,090 --> 03:13:41,923
Yeah.
And I don't remember it being like the 

4124
03:13:43,101 --> 03:13:46,690
weren't really sending a message.
Just like money isn't important.

4125
03:13:47,150 --> 03:13:49,620
It really literally is awesome when you 
want to be Richie.

4126
03:13:52,070 --> 03:13:54,140
He could get ice cream whenever he 
wanted.

4127
03:13:54,150 --> 03:13:56,660
It was always the thing too.
They're always getting ice cream.

4128
03:13:57,530 --> 03:14:00,950
Cadbury,
the Butler frightfully fit.

4129
03:14:01,160 --> 03:14:03,620
Oh yeah.
This is a rich one.

4130
03:14:03,621 --> 03:14:07,170
Should keep fit.
I exercise a whole lot of time.

4131
03:14:07,550 --> 03:14:08,870
Interesting.
Cadbury,

4132
03:14:09,970 --> 03:14:12,350
that's literally the lines.
That's the comedy.

4133
03:14:12,610 --> 03:14:15,680
The size of her arms.
They're like Ham hocks.

4134
03:14:15,910 --> 03:14:19,450
She just mounts you and just wrapped 
your head up and those arms and smothers

4135
03:14:19,460 --> 03:14:21,080
you to death.
You try to chew your way out,

4136
03:14:21,230 --> 03:14:23,570
but you run out of air.
You run on an air.

4137
03:14:23,710 --> 03:14:24,810
Oh,
interesting.

4138
03:14:25,530 --> 03:14:29,310
Those meet flaps.
Kitobah here.

4139
03:14:29,380 --> 03:14:31,040
God battery.
And if she's ever in trouble,

4140
03:14:31,041 --> 03:14:33,350
she could literally leap off a building 
with those things.

4141
03:14:33,410 --> 03:14:38,410
Just glide to safety.
Jabber is Cadbury fucking Jack.

4142
03:14:38,811 --> 03:14:40,880
He takes off his look at them on the 
left.

4143
03:14:41,290 --> 03:14:46,290
He's going into a hot tub.
He's got a towel on and no shirt.

4144
03:14:46,790 --> 03:14:48,920
He's ripped.
When did Cadbury?

4145
03:14:48,921 --> 03:14:51,080
We came and looked at him.
What a butler.

4146
03:14:51,081 --> 03:14:52,630
Well,
homoerotic.

4147
03:14:52,760 --> 03:14:56,240
Ah,
what a but so strange.

4148
03:14:56,660 --> 03:14:59,330
Wait a minute.
You're putting your.

4149
03:14:59,390 --> 03:15:00,800
Oh God.
Look what he says there.

4150
03:15:00,860 --> 03:15:03,020
Gosh,
I've been keeping you from your bath.

4151
03:15:03,021 --> 03:15:04,850
Cadbury.
I'm sorry.

4152
03:15:04,851 --> 03:15:07,840
Please go.
No need for apology.

4153
03:15:07,841 --> 03:15:08,674
So some day I shall relate the story of 
how I was once lost all my clothes at 

4154
03:15:14,061 --> 03:15:18,530
the South Pole and they says what a 
Butler as he's walking them,

4155
03:15:18,531 --> 03:15:21,500
walk away with his tiny little towel 
around his junk.

4156
03:15:21,770 --> 03:15:22,603
Look,
a little of that town was where do you 

4157
03:15:23,031 --> 03:15:23,864
even find a towel?
That little that makes it way all the 

4158
03:15:25,371 --> 03:15:26,470
way around your ass.
Yeah.

4159
03:15:26,550 --> 03:15:31,550
He's going outside and you got to make a
choice.

4160
03:15:32,840 --> 03:15:34,660
You covered your Dick.
Are you covering your asshole?

4161
03:15:34,760 --> 03:15:35,593
But you definitely not covered in both.
With what kind of strange snake like 

4162
03:15:39,740 --> 03:15:43,910
towel or you possessing six inches 
across 12 feet long.

4163
03:15:44,660 --> 03:15:47,020
Yeah.
Cadbury gun on the Jews started lifting.

4164
03:15:47,090 --> 03:15:48,980
Got a fitness coach.
It's so funny.

4165
03:15:48,990 --> 03:15:51,240
That was very homoerotic.
It was weird.

4166
03:15:51,690 --> 03:15:53,310
They were allowed to do weird stuff back
then.

4167
03:15:53,430 --> 03:15:57,420
Imagine if you had that cartoon today.
Fucking feds show up at your door.

4168
03:15:57,720 --> 03:15:58,531
Hey Tom,
papa.

4169
03:15:58,531 --> 03:16:01,440
Let's see your fucking hard drive.
Another one of the pedophile conspiracy.

4170
03:16:01,470 --> 03:16:06,470
Creepy Shit.
Fuck he been up to Tom.

4171
03:16:06,841 --> 03:16:11,040
Popular podcasts is five hours long.
How long have we gone to?

4172
03:16:11,310 --> 03:16:16,310
Three hours in a half at least right?
15 Tom Papa,

4173
03:16:17,340 --> 03:16:19,770
so easy to talk to my friend.
Do you have anything?

4174
03:16:19,771 --> 03:16:21,960
You're selling to the wine.
My pleasure.

4175
03:16:22,740 --> 03:16:24,600
Stick around for a while.
I don't want you to drive it anywhere.

4176
03:16:24,780 --> 03:16:26,550
They could listen to my podcast.
Okay,

4177
03:16:26,670 --> 03:16:28,140
come here.
Come to papa.

4178
03:16:28,230 --> 03:16:31,470
And what is this other thing to npr?
Did a pre live from here?

4179
03:16:31,680 --> 03:16:33,240
It's called live from here.
From here.

4180
03:16:33,270 --> 03:16:34,980
Every week.
Six o'clock.

4181
03:16:35,910 --> 03:16:39,240
Six o'clock east on your national public
radio.

4182
03:16:39,241 --> 03:16:40,600
Whatever.
And uh,

4183
03:16:40,650 --> 03:16:42,630
when are you going to be at the lovely 
comedy store next?

4184
03:16:42,720 --> 03:16:44,550
Probably tomorrow.
Oh Shit.

4185
03:16:46,120 --> 03:16:48,440
You got to work out some stuff.
Sold out.

4186
03:16:48,450 --> 03:16:50,460
Show in the main room.
Yeah.

4187
03:16:50,461 --> 03:16:52,020
Okay.
Tomorrow PM show.

4188
03:16:52,320 --> 03:16:55,470
I'm there folks.
We just made a booking.

4189
03:16:56,790 --> 03:16:57,730
I'm on.
All right,

4190
03:16:58,260 --> 03:16:59,400
thank you everybody.
Bye.

4191
03:16:59,430 --> 03:17:00,263
Bye.

4192
03:17:03,830 --> 03:17:04,663
Great.
