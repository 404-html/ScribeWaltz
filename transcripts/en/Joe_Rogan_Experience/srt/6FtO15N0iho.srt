1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:01,680
Hello

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,050
Freak bitches speaking and dying.

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:06,360
Tell me about any culture.

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,890
Oh yeah,

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:09,540
that's what I'm dealing with all day.

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,260
So the sand culture situation and
Coulter was at the roasted rob Lowe.

7
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,390
It wasn't live right
and I was on last night,

8
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,500
but when did it,

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,400
when did they film it?

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:18,563
Last Saturday.

11
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,261
Last Saturday.

12
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,340
So we'll only a week away.

13
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:20,970
Yeah.

14
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:22,950
So what happened?

15
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,160
Well,

16
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:24,993
you know,

17
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,750
this is the sixth roasts that I've
written for the third one that I've been a

18
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:30,070
staff writer on.

19
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,820
And it's always interesting
when someone gets booked,

20
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,450
you know,

21
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:35,261
what's going to happen,

22
00:00:35,261 --> 00:00:35,461
blah,

23
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:35,690
blah,

24
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:35,990
blah.

25
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,990
And Ann Coulter was one of the last
bookings that we had and I was excited to

26
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:41,680
help her.

27
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,760
And she,

28
00:00:42,761 --> 00:00:43,450
uh,

29
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,283
she didn't want,

30
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,830
she didn't want to do anything
that the writers told her,

31
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,700
you know,

32
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,800
that she sorta had to do like to be funny.

33
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:51,873
And she's like,

34
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,680
she didn't think anything was funny.

35
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,150
So she rewrote everything.

36
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,540
Like the script that we
originally wrote anyway,

37
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,980
she bombed really bad.

38
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,930
She bombed really bad.

39
00:01:00,931 --> 00:01:02,100
But what was she trying to avoid?

40
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,220
Like when you said she didn't want
to do what they wanted her to do?

41
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:05,901
Well,

42
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:06,920
we wanted her to write,

43
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,340
we won.

44
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,200
We had stuff in her voice,

45
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:12,800
like with her angle and a little
bit of self deprecating at the top.

46
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,641
You know what I mean?

47
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,410
Like it was supposed to be like,

48
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:15,711
Hey,

49
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:16,640
I'm Ann Coulter.

50
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,600
You know,

51
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,600
you might be wondering why I'm
here at the Rob Lowe Roast.

52
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:24,620
It's because it's the first time that I'm
not the most hated person in the room.

53
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,071
You know,

54
00:01:25,071 --> 00:01:29,600
like sorta like put it on her lender
and you got to acknowledge who you are.

55
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,190
But instead she's like,

56
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:31,701
Nah,

57
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,331
I don't like that.

58
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:32,870
I'm not going to,

59
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,100
not going to play.

60
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,370
I'm not going to sell from,

61
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,020
am I going to shit on myself as sub rose?

62
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:38,930
Why would I do that?

63
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:39,260
You know?

64
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,420
There's no way there's no,

65
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:41,860
I mean that's,

66
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,980
those were her exact words,

67
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:45,680
but she just said she wasn't going to
do that and she would just cut out.

68
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:46,100
You Go,

69
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,600
you go back and forth via emails and then
all of a sudden all the good stuff is

70
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:53,450
cut out and there's bad stuff and
some of the stuff's rewritten.

71
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,740
Did you meet her in real life?

72
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:55,310
Yeah.

73
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:58,430
Did you meet her in real life before
the actual roast or the day of?

74
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:58,791
Uh,

75
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,421
the day of,

76
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:02,330
I talked to her on the
phone five days out,

77
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,360
which she was okay on that.

78
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,810
She's like laughing at the script,

79
00:02:05,811 --> 00:02:07,250
but then once it's an email,

80
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:07,550
you know,

81
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,780
she rewrote it and it was bad.

82
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,140
But you really think that
she's less hated and Rob Lowe?

83
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,520
No.

84
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:13,881
No,

85
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:14,480
not at all.

86
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,380
Everyone looks rob Lowe,

87
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,100
who was the most hated person in the
room besides her was the joke about rob

88
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:22,550
Lowe.

89
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,061
Yeah.

90
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,350
The choke is like,

91
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:24,711
yeah,

92
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:25,101
no,

93
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:27,380
she's saying that she's hated.

94
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,080
She's acknowledging exactly it.

95
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,980
Then she's saying the Rob Lowe's hated.

96
00:02:30,981 --> 00:02:31,814
So it's a joke,

97
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,730
but it's not really,

98
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:35,120
that part doesn't need to be funny though.

99
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,180
We just needed her to acknowledge that
she's a piece of shit and she didn't want

100
00:02:40,341 --> 00:02:41,090
to do that.

101
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:44,060
Instead she came out and literally it's
like you might be wondering loyal I'm

102
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:47,900
here or it couldn't possibly
be to promote my new book.

103
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:52,930
And she leans down all awkwardly and
pulls out her shitty book in Trump.

104
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,220
We trust he pluribus awesome.

105
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:55,851
And she says,

106
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:56,320
I like it

107
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,070
plural.

108
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:57,461
Wait a minute,

109
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:57,851
wait a minute,

110
00:02:57,851 --> 00:02:58,360
wait a minute,

111
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,140
wait a minute.

112
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,190
Her new book

113
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,390
is in Trump.

114
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:02,224
We trust.

115
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,260
Yeah.

116
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:03,940
Wait for it.

117
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:04,960
E pluribus.

118
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,853
Awesome.

119
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,720
That's like the tag of the book.

120
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,661
Wow.

121
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,720
And she said it and just the roar,

122
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,120
this crowd book,

123
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:18,010
she loves Trump and on that
Trump shit money she wrote,

124
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,720
that is her 11th book.

125
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,610
She's written 11 books.

126
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,800
He's worth good amount of money.

127
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:25,340
Jesus Christ.

128
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,880
What was the purpose of having
her on the roast to begin with?

129
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,650
It seems like the roads
have always had like,

130
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:31,550
I kind of like a goat,

131
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,140
you know like Jersey shore.

132
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:37,610
They had the situation on tron
roast and hold that back up.

133
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,590
I want to read this
description but pull up,

134
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,851
make it smaller.

135
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:41,221
So yeah,

136
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,020
here we go.

137
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,700
Donald Trump isn't a politician.

138
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:46,940
He's a one man wrecking ball against
our dysfunctional and corrupt

139
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:47,750
establishment.

140
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:52,220
We're about to see the deluxe version of
the left's favorite theme volt for us,

141
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,990
or we'll call you stupid.

142
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,760
It's the working class against this
smirking class now Ann Coulter with her

143
00:03:58,761 --> 00:03:59,810
unique insight,

144
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,670
candor and sense of humor,

145
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,700
who makes the definitive case for why
we should all join his revolution.

146
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,231
Wow.

147
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,450
She just bent over.

148
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,230
She bent over for the man who might

149
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,173
be king.

150
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,440
Yeah,

151
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,921
she was.

152
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:18,750
She know she wants to play that character,

153
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:21,630
but well if he wins and
she wrote a book like that,

154
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,650
she's in deep,

155
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:22,951
deep,

156
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:23,311
deep,

157
00:04:23,311 --> 00:04:23,641
deep,

158
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,450
deep.

159
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:27,810
She be the one to defend him every
time there's any sort of a public,

160
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:28,770
you know,

161
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:30,300
he doesn't like her by the way.

162
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,230
He doesn't like her.

163
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,190
It doesn't like to see in.

164
00:04:32,191 --> 00:04:36,990
One of the really funny things is that
he changed his immigration policy,

165
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,380
like tweak the tone of it the
day before that book came out.

166
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,950
And it's sorta like
mess things up because,

167
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,001
yeah,

168
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,660
because he's sorta like a office
books like all about like,

169
00:04:48,661 --> 00:04:48,871
yeah,

170
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,780
don't let anybody in his zero immigration.

171
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:52,860
And he was sorta just like,

172
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:53,641
you know,

173
00:04:53,641 --> 00:04:55,830
he visited Mexico like outta nowhere.

174
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,440
Like the day before her book
came out and she's like,

175
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:58,940
ah,

176
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,191
you know,

177
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:02,280
it just wasn't good press
for back to Ann Coulter.

178
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:02,940
Yeah.

179
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,900
So silly bitch.

180
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,250
So what does she try to do?

181
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,740
She tries to write her own jokes then.

182
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,930
Yeah,

183
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,450
there's,

184
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,230
you know,

185
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:13,860
like I worked with Martha Stewart for
the Bieber roast and she crushed it.

186
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,843
Crushed it.

187
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,620
First thing she said to me,

188
00:05:16,621 --> 00:05:16,810
it was,

189
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,360
I want to kill as hard as I can.

190
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,160
So Hook it up and I'm like,

191
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:21,330
Stuart's done time.

192
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,530
That's what I want you to do.

193
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:22,801
Yeah.

194
00:05:22,801 --> 00:05:23,760
She's the best ever.

195
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,860
She's been in the pokey.

196
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,030
She understands shit.

197
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,600
And at a level and Coulter where they're
privileged lifestyle of white people

198
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,740
everywhere she goes.

199
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,083
Correct.

200
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,840
And so Ann Coulter basically says that,

201
00:05:35,841 --> 00:05:36,141
you know,

202
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:37,220
she doesn't like this joke.

203
00:05:37,221 --> 00:05:38,240
She doesn't like that joke.

204
00:05:38,241 --> 00:05:39,051
She writes this,

205
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:40,850
she puts a pitch for a book at the top.

206
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,560
First off,

207
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,720
she was like a third to last.

208
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:45,410
She was second.

209
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,400
So Rob Lowe,

210
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,271
when Ann Coulter,

211
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:47,901
Jeff Ross,

212
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:48,470
Rob Lowe,

213
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,250
and to show,

214
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:49,641
right.

215
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:52,100
So all these people in
before Ralph Machio,

216
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:53,211
Nikki Glaser,

217
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,290
Pete Davidson,

218
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,520
Jimmy Carr,

219
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,260
uh,

220
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:56,430
blah,

221
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:56,581
blah,

222
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:56,710
blah,

223
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:56,831
blah,

224
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:57,560
blah.

225
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,393
Anyway,

226
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,340
and she got lit up and I mean big time,

227
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,330
Peyton Manning,

228
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:02,930
jewel,

229
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,800
everybody,

230
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,810
they'd hit everybody
on the day as you know,

231
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,450
cause you always make fun of
everybody at a roast of course.

232
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:10,730
And then you get the main
target at the end of your thing.

233
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,220
But when people went in on Ian Coulter,

234
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,540
they went in hard,

235
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,700
very hard like Jimmy Card,

236
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,471
this one joke,

237
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:19,101
which I loved,

238
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:20,900
which I'm going to completely,

239
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,093
you know,

240
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,700
destroy right now because I
don't know exactly how he set up,

241
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:30,701
but it was something like Ann Coulter
was here and you ugly ratchet faced piece

242
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:31,820
of shit,

243
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,800
scum buckets,

244
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,800
like something like that.

245
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,371
Just like that.

246
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:35,810
Five insulting words,

247
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,560
just Cag,

248
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,400
Cag in a gang.

249
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,660
And he goes,

250
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:41,780
you are one of the most insufferable
human beings on the planet,

251
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,250
but it's not too late.

252
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,480
You can change,

253
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,340
you could kill yourself.

254
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:48,620
And the crowds about him,

255
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:48,951
I mean,

256
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,690
just everybody hated her.

257
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:52,640
So she was great to have on the Deus.

258
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,563
Wow.

259
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,250
She could have killed me.

260
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:56,420
And Mike Lawrence,

261
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,910
who's a huge pro wrestling
fan and Sarah Tiana,

262
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:01,160
who's an old school pro wrestling fan,

263
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,690
we looked at her like,

264
00:07:02,691 --> 00:07:02,931
wow,

265
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:04,670
we can write her as a heel,

266
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:05,940
she'll own it,

267
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,130
it'll be great.

268
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,910
We're all going to look like superstars
because we were able to make Ann Coulter

269
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:11,744
funny.

270
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:15,080
But instead halfway through
the week we realize like,

271
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:15,771
oh no,

272
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:19,700
she doesn't get it and she wants to do
this and you don't want to scare away

273
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:21,230
from not being on the roast.

274
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:21,650
You know what I mean?

275
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,401
You don't want to be like,

276
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:22,701
hey,

277
00:07:22,701 --> 00:07:27,500
you're going to hear going to do terrible
cause then there's a chance that you

278
00:07:27,501 --> 00:07:28,011
might not do it.

279
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:31,850
And we wanted it there cause you know
you going to show she's going to do good,

280
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:32,270
great.

281
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,380
Everybody's gonna Shit on her.

282
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:34,214
But also,

283
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:34,850
you know,

284
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,730
worst comes to worse.

285
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,870
People love a train wreck
and this was a train wreck.

286
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,300
Super trainer was like,

287
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,170
no,

288
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,150
this was like a Gif of a train wreck.

289
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,590
It just got to watch it.

290
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,160
Boom,

291
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,700
boom.

292
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,600
She was terrible.

293
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,480
And the one thing comedy central did do,

294
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,950
which is hilarious,

295
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:57,010
is the reaction shots that they chose
for her jokes like when she was on stage,

296
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,263
uh,

297
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,650
are hilarious.

298
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,970
Like it just cuts to just,

299
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:04,850
people just started just studying.

300
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:05,130
Well,

301
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:05,410
yes,

302
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:05,950
he made

303
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,930
her bones in the safest,

304
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:09,100
softest world,

305
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,820
which is the world of like political
commentary where there's five different

306
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:15,520
people and everybody's shouting over
everybody and you don't have to say

307
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:16,720
anything that's really relevant.

308
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:16,931
Right.

309
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:17,681
And especially her,

310
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:18,970
because she's just a button pusher.

311
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,171
She's a white lady,

312
00:08:20,171 --> 00:08:23,200
button pusher and she gets up there and
she says crazy things like if Canada

313
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:24,550
doesn't like it will invade them.

314
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,060
Yeah.

315
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,410
She says stupid shit like that,

316
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:27,430
that she doesn't even mean,

317
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:27,971
you know,

318
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:29,050
and like this is what she does.

319
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,790
She pushes buttons and Bill Maher calls
or his friend and they laugh together.

320
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,980
Hahahahaha and she
lives in the soft world.

321
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,020
That world that she stepped into is
not just one of the hardest worlds,

322
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,990
but for a person like her to go on after
someone like Jimmy Carr and get Kirra

323
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,740
washed and then attempt to plug
her book and all that Jazz.

324
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:56,110
Like I bet she has no idea what the
average person's perception her is because

325
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:57,990
she's dealing with that bubble,

326
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,110
that fucking talk show
and two d c crazy idea.

327
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,310
It's,

328
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:01,500
yeah.

329
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,310
But that weird bubble where she's kind
of legitimate in that bubble and you

330
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:05,551
know,

331
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:06,570
she's the button pusher.

332
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:08,940
I'll hear it was come crazy an yeah.

333
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,421
You know,

334
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,560
she thinks she's wacky.

335
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,000
And another thing is,

336
00:09:12,001 --> 00:09:12,181
you know,

337
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:15,270
one of the main things that are
roast is when you get made fun of,

338
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,470
you should laugh.

339
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,120
Yeah.

340
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,620
Cause it shows that you
have a sense of humor.

341
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,610
That's like the main thing.

342
00:09:20,611 --> 00:09:21,830
That's why Trump did it.

343
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,100
Now he's could be president.

344
00:09:23,101 --> 00:09:24,150
Charlie Sheen did it.

345
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,730
Pro Trump can be president
because he did a roast.

346
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,753
Hey

347
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Justin Bieber's the number one
artist in the world most blah.

348
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,551
Oh,

349
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,570
it's all gross.

350
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:42,720
Yeah.
