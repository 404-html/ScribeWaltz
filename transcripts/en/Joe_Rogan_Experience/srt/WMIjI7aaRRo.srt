1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,540
The levels of Douche baggish nest.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,660
Oh my God.

3
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,320
Almost like sports fans are the worst.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,053
They're the worst.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:17,490
You name it after your tab
that mean to tout olds you.

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,320
It's not the fucking La Rogan's.

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:19,710
Right.

8
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:20,543
You know it's true.

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,540
Fucking La Lakers.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,170
Yeah,

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,730
and they're putting out a shitty product.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:24,550
Yeah.

13
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:25,383
Goddammit.

14
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,580
How's your season been
these last couple of years?

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,241
Wow.

16
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,074
What team are you?

17
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:32,040
It doesn't even matter.

18
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,330
The point is the Lakers suck.

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:33,720
Oh,

20
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,590
well the hell's fan.

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,070
We made it stuck around for
the first time in history.

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:40,110
Look at New Orleans Pelicans.

23
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,710
How did you get to be a fan of the,

24
00:00:41,711 --> 00:00:44,400
because they started in North
Carolina when I was there.

25
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:47,220
Then they moved and then they
change your goddamn name.

26
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,001
It's all a mass,

27
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:51,180
but fuck my teams to stay one
a team called the Pelican,

28
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:51,870
not me.

29
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,300
Don't go.

30
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,090
The wife of the guy who owns it,

31
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:56,670
he owns a good franchise
as a fucking billionaire.

32
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,950
Smart Guy who makes up the fucking
living for himself and he's like,

33
00:00:59,010 --> 00:00:59,410
oh,

34
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:00,243
the trophy wife.

35
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,290
You want to name the team?

36
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,210
Then all of these men
have to fucking support.

37
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,493
Wow.

38
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:05,431
Is that really what happened?

39
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,410
That's what happened to your variant.

40
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,790
It's fucking ridiculous.

41
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,624
Very upset.

42
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,500
What would you have called
that if you were attracting

43
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,580
the bath mats?

44
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,680
It's a better fucking
name than the Pelicans.

45
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,330
I had to research all the time,

46
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:21,030
but like vicious Pelican behavior
so I could get behind a little bit.

47
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,020
They are vicious though.

48
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,930
Belly ducks hole.

49
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,120
They'll eat ducks hole.

50
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:24,930
They'll go down there.

51
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,520
It's going to go fuck off.

52
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,950
I'm sure I could watch that.

53
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,161
Oh,

54
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:29,994
it's great.

55
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm sure we're going to watch
hip Pelican eats a duck,

56
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,910
but no one thinks of that.

57
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,320
When you think of a Pelican,

58
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:34,830
no.

59
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,260
You think of like a cute
thing that brings babies.

60
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:37,771
Yeah.

61
00:01:37,771 --> 00:01:38,604
Yeah.

62
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,663
Oh,

63
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,190
whoa.

64
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,023
Back that up.

65
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
We get this one.

66
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,473
Oof

67
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,870
the whole duck.

68
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,580
That is fucking insane,

69
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:54,150
dude.

70
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:54,271
Oh,

71
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,470
they're just trying to drive them off.

72
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,430
The other ducks mad like,

73
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:56,730
come on,

74
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,100
give me back.

75
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:57,933
Come on.

76
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,501
Dammit.

77
00:01:58,501 --> 00:01:59,220
He's down.

78
00:01:59,220 --> 00:01:59,401
Look,

79
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:00,390
he's just swamped to stop.

80
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:00,990
One more time.

81
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,650
Let me see that again.
